chin@@ ane@@ ws , july 30
according to a report by china securities news , the " regulations on management of foreign investment by insurance funds " was promulgated a few days ago , and insurance funds have a broader space for utilizing their capital markets .
china 's largest investment official
the report said that many insurance institutions hold the same view .
experts said that because there is still no such market for renminbi products , the insurance institutions are not capable of avoiding risks , and therefore , the tim@@ ing for large - scale purchases of foreign exchange is not yet ri@@ pe .
liu le@@ fei said that in the long run , the government will be more flexible in the allocation of assets by foreign investment in the overall distribution of insurance companies .
however , given the relatively large amount of pressure for the appreciation of the renminbi , china will mainly make use of its own foreign exchange funds to invest abroad .
the state council will adopt a series of measures to deal with foreign exchange purchases and make investment abroad .

germany to reduce thre@@ sh@@ old for professional personnel to import
on july 1 , the pla daily reported on the first day of the new year that the pla had sent troops to the united states .
the german minister of education and scientific research , sha wan@@ lin , said recently that germany should lower the " gr@@ in@@ d law " to provide restrictions on the import of foreign professional personnel , and increase the number of foreign personnel to solve the problems faced by germany in terms of professional personnel .
according to o@@ ec@@ d 's report , germany has reached 15 to 64 years of age of labor force , and the number of people aged between 15 and 64 will drop year by year .
if there is no sufficient migr@@ ation , to 20@@ th , germany 's labor force will be reduced by 6@@ 6.@@ 5 percent .
however , the german federation of employers and the german engine@@ ers association have reported that the current labor market in germany is characterized by professional engine@@ ers ' technological el@@ ite .
the federal labor bureau said the number of employees in germany rose to 3@@ 6.@@ 5 million in may this year , compared with the same period last year .
in order to protect the employment of its own people , germany has set up a higher thre@@ sh@@ old for attracting foreign talent .

( 28 june ) " china 's com@@ e@@ back "
there are theoretical circles in the country and such places as hu@@ g@@ h , g@@ es@@ e@@ to , and el@@ eg@@ ant customs . the former includes teaching and research on laws , as well as mis@@ fortune of others , while the latter is engaged in li@@ tig@@ ation , legal service , and other specific behavior such as legal service .
for a long time , the law has been r@@ ous@@ ed and mis@@ led by the el@@ ites of literary and art circles , as well as theoretical c@@ it@@ r@@ ies in the theoretical circles , and the lack of essential things in the practical work circles . these are only things of mechanical and mechanical laws , but are also things of course in the non@@ profit fields of the national arts and cultural circles .
with regard to such division of labor , the legal system can be maintained at ease and not work at the cost of giving support to one party .
however , the provisions in the law of lawyers in the process of making laws have obj@@ ectively recognized the law of origin .
in fact , some law@@ suits have been merely used to make theoretical studies and teaching .
in this way , the phenomena of l@@ uring law@@ break@@ ers undoubtedly r@@ ings out the legal profession 's qualifications to make things worse .
we must not only ignor@@ e super@@ sti@@ tions in theoretical circles , such as experts and demonstrations , often engage in serious violations of law and discipline , and even rej@@ ect court judg@@ ments .

because of the eight terrorists arrested , the police have been conducting medical treatment . the government will conduct a thorough investigation into the cause of migr@@ ants entering the medical system .

pe@@ d@@ d@@ ling the traders
tourism and tourism plans are sl@@ ack@@ ening the efforts of the authorities .
but the number of people who travel in china has encountered such a kind of worries . in addition to being ex@@ tor@@ ted by traders and business intermedi@@ ary businesses , they are still being tr@@ ac@@ ed and ch@@ ased .
both cars and tr@@ ains , the tr@@ uc@@ ks , and the ca@@ ve must be affected by small traders and some un@@ qualified intermedi@@ aries .
not selling flowers and bur@@ ns , it is selling newspapers and peri@@ o@@ dic@@ als , and many other non@@ certificate - based intermedi@@ ary im@@ porters have introduced their food and drin@@ ks , or even made false c@@ ds .
if you do not accept it , he can ch@@ ase you for several hundred meters , and it 's very difficult to succeed .
in some places , many things are also done in order to make a fortune .
without entering the gate , some people would go to tourism and small ones .
after entering the door , this situation will be more . once the good situation is improved , it will be distur@@ bed .
some media reports said that the number of foreign tourists visiting xi ' an is quite big in pra@@ ise of the ancient civilization in xi ' an , but it is not a matter of fact that small business haw@@ ks who allow more land@@ f@@ ills are everywhere to sell .
these include the tr@@ un@@ k of the r@@ ings of the r@@ ings and the r@@ ings of the wind , and should be un@@ orderly , calm , and harmonious , and give a big stick to the char@@ m of the eye .
the free movement of traders , which sti@@ r@@ red up trouble , is something that has been obj@@ ectively destroyed .
what is important is that these things are the main points of the local spiritual civilization construction , and the pe@@ aks of the entire le@@ op@@ ard are not just an issue of image , but also a major impact on local economic development .
just think , if you want to make a big and powerful tourism industry , you use this kind of dis@@ orderly and complete tourism environment to meet the needs of the guests coming from south to north . who is willing to come , who will dare to come ?
your tourism economy has achieved good results ?
as the peak travel season arri@@ ves , it will bring a new opportunity for tourists from the north of tian@@ nan to create a civilized tourism environment . it should be said that the urgent task at present is to be done .
not a market , small business haw@@ ker business conduct should be standardized , and there should be a mechanism for operation without a license , and illegal activities should be resolutely cracked down .
a civilized and orderly environment can enable the country to be happy , to do all it can ,
in a word , do n't let the traders worry about it .
voluntary surr@@ ender of the smuggl@@ ed or@@ ang@@ e
the " qi@@ an@@ long street " in dong@@ cheng district , beijing , used to issue electric sh@@ oes and other things as a tr@@ ibu@@ te to 12 households that volun@@ t@@ arily re@@ fund .
( xin@@ jing bao , july 10 )
the auth@@ or has made a lot of exc@@ it@@ ement for the improvement of the family life , but he has taken the initiative to sil@@ k wor@@ ding , and has also given incen@@ tives to re@@ war@@ ding others .
the vice - director of the office of building ji@@ ar@@ ong street said that the problem of s@@ wind@@ ling and low - guarantee is to encourage voluntary surr@@ ender , and to set examples for other low - income households .
if this example is to encourage other low - income insurance personnel to use their own efforts to extr@@ icate themselves from the predic@@ ament , it is indeed worth advocating , and if this is intended to use this to ensure that those who have been s@@ wind@@ ling for a long time cannot avoid some n@@ ai@@ ve .
in differ@@ ing and clean@@ ing up the work of low@@ ering the number of households , what is more dependent is the law .
relevant departments should strengthen the role of low - income households in performing their duties while enjoying the minimum allow@@ able insurance : for example , timely noti@@ fy family personnel and income changes , report on employment situation , and accept peri@@ od@@ ic re@@ examination , and the relevant departments should step up supervision and inspection .
after all , the phenomena of corruption and der@@ el@@ iction of duty are a long - lasting solution .
the street has given a special allow@@ ance to those who have been re@@ war@@ ded by the family ?
the street is a government organization at the level of level , and its expenditure is borne by fiscal appropri@@ ations .
the tax money of the tax@@ pay@@ er should not be used ?
on the one hand , the number of households that have with@@ drawn from the minimum living guarantee has proven that they have the ability to fe@@ ed themselves from others , while on the other hand , the number of people applying for low - guarantee is not yet available ?
the life - saving government financial appropri@@ ations should be made available in the snow . however , not in the light of the fl@@ ower .
liu is willing to serve as a service provid@@ er , and this remark is even more r@@ it@@ ual .
on 10 july , the first national public - pushed township election town was called off by the mu@@ he of mu@@ lan town in xin@@ du district . after he assumed office , liu yi received the title for the fourth time of accepting the call for democracy .
at a news conference held with liu da@@ yi , liu said that he was determined to be a chinese citizen who had served the country .
( the new beijing news yesterday )
liu qi@@ yi 's service to others who might have been more in@@ competent than those appointed cadres .
the public promotion of direct election is the biggest challenge in the system of appointment , and the former is mainly decided by ordinary party members and masses , and the latter is mainly appointed by the organizations at the higher level , and the direction of the source of power determin@@ es that the former must place the responsibility for the people in the first place .
the source of power and the person responsible for the matter are the key to the success of the work .
some people doubt whether such a practice of democracy is like a r@@ it@@ ual of democracy .
my view is that there are such things as democracy and the way of things to go , and that is better .
taking into consideration the reality of the history and current situation of china 's grassroots democratic political construction , i think that the practice of making public and promoting direct elections is a major breakthrough , and democracy is an important component part of this process . it is of no use to under@@ estimate the efforts to promote the building of democracy at the grass - roots level .
india is expected to win the election for the first female president , analysts say the possibility of being elected is relatively high , and female voters hope that they will improve their status as women .

p@@ aw@@ ach@@ i was the first female presidential candidate in indian history . if she was elected , she would become a r@@ it@@ ual in india .
pas@@ c@@ al is the head of the ruling national congress party , and sh@@ ev@@ ard@@ at is from the opposition party .
because the national congress party has won the upper hand in the presidential election , the media and the people are all around like each other and the possibility of being elected is quite great .
the 72 - year - old p@@ ach@@ ach@@ ach@@ a is the female head of the state of j@@ a@@ stan@@ a .
she 's a law@@ yer , a member of the national assembly , and a member of the national assembly , has rich experience .
she also devoted herself to social welfare , and was a result of many cultural rel@@ ics and social welfare organizations .
analysts pointed out that the reason that p@@ ach@@ ach@@ ach@@ e has become a candidate is that she has been unswervingly involved in the indian national congress party chairman so@@ e@@ k@@ k@@ k@@ ka .
in india , the g@@ and@@ hi cl@@ an has long controlled the ruling national congress party .
he was welcomed by many female voters .
the constitution stipulates that india is a federal state , and the president is the head of state and the head of state , and does not represent any party organization , more than any other party organization .
