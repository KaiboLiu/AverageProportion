the " 2004 china international convention on national defense " says that china firmly supports the path of peaceful development . china has implemented a defensive national defense policy .
china 's past and present are not so strang@@ e in the future .
so far , china has not established diplomatic relations with any other country .
professor li yi@@ ping , professor at the beijing university institute of international relations , said : china and the united states should establish a channel to increase communication and exchanges and enhance understanding and mutual trust and comprehensively promote the development of sino - us constructive and cooperative relations in the new century and jointly promote the maintenance of world peace and development .

( international ) chinese president calls hamas to step up efforts to break new israeli - palestinian conflict
xinhua news agency , l@@ as veg@@ as , february 9 ( reporter ) the hamas organizing committee of the hamas government to seek a breakthrough in the cabinet of hamas in the hope of a breakthrough in the palestinian - israeli peace process
xinhua news agency , beijing , april 22 ,
the palestinian islamic resistance movement ( hamas ) has won the approval of the legislative council after the victory of the election .
hamas will promote what kind of new policy it will implement directly affect the peace process 's next step .
at the same time , the united states and israel have been even more disgu@@ sted with the hamas government 's future .
at present , all parties in palestine are stepping up consultations to hold discussions on the issue of forming a cabinet to discuss the difficulties and sensitive points of future development .
( sub@@ head )
hamas won the election of the cabinet . the outside world was worried that hamas 's prime minister might be in touch with the current top leader ab@@ b@@ as .
moreover , just as the egyptian president mu@@ barak , who is currently visiting egypt , stressed that the hamas leadership is formed by hamas , and that the new palestinian government will not recognize israel . this tough signal also aggrav@@ ates the international anx@@ ie@@ ty .
the united states and israel have explicitly expressed their ref@@ us@@ al to accept a hamas government that controls real power and threatened to suspend the palestinian economy .
however , this does not mean that hamas is making a flexible policy decision .
according to reports , in order to make the greatest international recognition , the chinese government recently gathered in egypt 's hamas leaders to decide to select the independent candidate , c@@ apr@@ a islamic ta@@ ya school board chairman , j@@ ay@@ er j@@ ay@@ ak@@ ar@@ i , to become the new prime minister .
this is a fact that has not yet been approved by the parties concerned .
the palestinian analy@@ st , hus@@ se@@ in , said that no matter how high the prime minister 's post is , the key is that the candidate of the prime minister should be as much as possible to play down hamas 's hard - line t@@ one . only in this way can we ensure the success of the cabinet .
( sub@@ head )
from inside to the point of view , hamas is facing the biggest challenge .
the palestinian " sun@@ sh@@ ine newspaper " analyzed that the palestinian government has been trying to get the palestinians to get rid of the palestinian people by means of social welfare projects .
hamas has won the election after the election and has proposed establishing a political alliance with fat@@ ah , which has jointly formed a national coalition government . however , fat@@ ah has not given a positive response to this issue .
the french government has also decided to provide a comprehensive response to the question of whether to enter the cabinet , and one faction is in favor of participating in the new government , thus making it possible for another faction to rej@@ ect hamas 's invitation . it is willing to make positive efforts in legislation , which is actively carried out in opposition , and the opposition , which is active in the legisl@@ ature .
according to the informed sources ,
even though it is true that hamas and fat@@ ah have also been holding talks on the cabinet 's distribution of power .
in addition , another one is that the establishment of the legislative committee framework is out of the consideration of the political parties .
according to reports , hamas also designed a new plan to build a clean expert .
in view of the fact that the united states and israel have a technical expert style , the government has no choice but to reduce external pressure .
according to the basic law of palestine , the right to vote on the new government of palestine on 16 february will be nom@@ inated by the prime minister and forming the cabinet after the new legislative council was inaug@@ ur@@ ated on 16 february .
( sub@@ head )
hamas has a very important role in establishing a new government .
the united states and israel have a very tough attitude and are firmly demanding hamas to give up violence and rej@@ ect its armed forces in political affairs .
hamas leader ma@@ ha@@ th@@ ir said on 9 july that the armed resistance was the main cause of the organization 's strategy of co@@ oling its own hands .
the issue of armed forces is in fact a question of legi@@ tim@@ acy of weapons and the rule of armed forces .
hamas has also made a new choice through democracy and freedom .
hamas has proposed that it should send all armed forces to the palestinian national authority .
the palestinian people have 6@@ 0,000 palestinians , and the number of palestinians is only 4@@ 0,000 .
moreover , the french government has also made some organization relations s@@ ong@@ de .
the delegation is led by hamas , which is responsible for forming a cabinet , to discuss how to manage these armed forces that are running their own government and ration@@ ally distribu@@ te the right to manage security .
according to local media , the ab@@ b@@ as inten@@ ds to be in charge of security and intelligence troops , police and civil defense organizations , which are composed of the interior ministry of the new government .
however , all parties have also reached consensus on this sensitive issue .
