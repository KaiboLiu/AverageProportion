if the feeling of suffering and the fear of being killed by military actions in iraq and afghanistan ,
[ peng guang@@ qian ] the us government has decided to grant china pntr , which is a threat to other countries , because it has always been an enemy in the pentagon , and its real purpose is to win more national defense funds and provide the us enormous military industrial corporations with more space for profits .

he has participated in several research reports on china 's national defense white paper , deng hong@@ zhou said : in the 1990 s , with the development of the economy , china 's national defense spending has increased , but the proportion of china 's fiscal expenditure in the same period has shown a down@@ ward trend .
official data show that in 2004 , the proportion of the total defense spending in china 's defense spending in the same period decreased by nearly 10 percent , compared with 1979 .
in 2005 , china 's national defense spending will be 24@@ 4.@@ 6@@ 56 billion yuan , only equivalent to the us 's about one - fourth of the us , and the per capita national defense spending is only about one - sixth of the us 's total , and the per capita military spending is about one - thir@@ ds of the us military 's .
the us territory and its natural resources are far from being enough .
[ peng guang@@ qian ] .
the china arms control and disarmament association research department director teng jian@@ q@@ un said that the us side should obj@@ ectively evalu@@ ate china 's military construction , and china 's peaceful development does not mean that the two countries will continue to cooperate in the military field in the future .

china to hold talks with hamas on new round of six - party talks
xinhua news agency , ram@@ al@@ lah , february 9 ( international observation ) the hamas government has found itself seeking to form a cabinet to break the deadlock
xinhua news agency , wang hao , huang min ,
the palestinian islamic resistance movement ( hamas ) obtained the legislative council election , and how to draw up a new plan for the new government has become a major topic of international concern at present .
hamas will pursue a new policy of directly affecting peace process .
at the same time , the united states and israel 's bo@@ y@@ co@@ tt attitude has added vari@@ ables to the future of the hamas government .
at present , all sides in palestine are stepping up consultations to hold consultations on the issue of forming a cabinet , which involves difficulties and sensitive points in future development .
the " three links " are the most difficult and the most difficult task is to make the premier 's office fall .
hamas won the right to form a cabinet , and some people are worried that hamas 's prime minister might be connected with the current supreme leader ab@@ b@@ as .
moreover , the us secretary of state , ma@@ h@@ m@@ oud ab@@ b@@ as , who is visiting egypt , stressed that the new palestinian government , which is under the leadership of hamas , will not recognize israel . this tough signal has also aggrav@@ ated the international worries .
the united states and israel have clearly expressed that they will not accept a hamas government that holds real power and will threaten to hal@@ t economic aid to palestine and send tax to palestine .
however , this does not obstruc@@ t hamas from making a flexible strategy adjustment , and the selection of an independent is a compromise .
according to reports , in order to obtain the international recognition as much as possible , the hamas and chinese leaders in egypt recently decided to elect an independent leader , sha@@ ath , a board chairman of the board of directors of the islamic grand school of islamic university , to take up the post of new prime minister .
this move has not yet been supported by the relevant parties .
palestinian analysts , hus@@ se@@ in , said that no matter how high the prime minister 's office is , the most crucial thing is that the prime minister should try to dil@@ ute hamas 's hard - line color as much as possible . only by so doing will it be possible to ensure the success of the cabinet formation .
the " three represents " are the basic questions of how to alloc@@ ate power
domes@@ tically , the hamas cabinet is facing the most serious challenge .
on the eve of the " day of peace " of palestine , an article carried by the paper says that hamas has concentrated its people on social welfare projects , but it lacks experience in governing and has no connection with the palestinian national liberation movement , which has experience in ruling .
hamas has proposed a peace agreement with fat@@ ah after the election , saying that it is a common aspiration of a political coalition government , but fat@@ ah has not given any positive support to it .
fat@@ ah is currently engaged in a debate on whether to enter the cabinet , and one faction is advocating participation in the new government , thus getting some things done , while the other party ref@@ uses to accept hamas 's invitation , and is willing to make a positive opposition party committee .
the source pointed out : in the face of ab@@ b@@ as 's persu@@ asion , fat@@ ah gradually le@@ an@@ ed toward joining the new government .
even so , hamas and fat@@ ah have also been working together on the issue of the distribution of cabinet posts .
in addition , the other way is to form a legislative committee framework that is outside the framework of a political party .
according to reports , hamas also designed a clean - up expert type of government . however , the specific name list was un@@ clear .
in view of the attitude of the united states and israel , the technical speci@@ alist government is no longer a kind of organization to reduce external pressure .
according to the provisions of the basic law of palestine , the new legislative council will be s@@ wor@@ n in on 16 november after the election of the prime minister and forming a cabinet .
the " three stresses " education is a major political issue .
the weapons in the hands of hamas are the most important weapons to be faced by the new government .
the united states and israel are very tough in their attitude and resolutely demand that hamas abandon violence and rej@@ ect its armed participation in politics .
hamas leader ma@@ h@@ m@@ oud al-@@ as@@ ad stressed on 9 november that armed resistance is a strategic choice chosen by this organization .
armed problems actually include the leg@@ ality of weapons and the ownership of armed forces .
hamas has been trying to achieve its goal of " a new government " by winning the international recognition of its first major party in the legisl@@ ature through democracy and freedom .
hamas once proposed to separate armed groups from palestine to fight for the authority of the palestinian national authority , but it did not receive wide response . it also met with opposition from the palestinian islamic ji@@ had organization ( j@@ a@@ ham@@ id ) .
palestine now has 6@@ 0,000 security organizations , and the overwhelming majority of them come from the fat@@ ah camp .
moreover , fat@@ ah also had some organizational relations .
the chief hamas , who is in charge of forming the cabinet , must hold talks with ab@@ b@@ as on how to manage the armed forces of all kinds of self - government and ration@@ ally alloc@@ ate their security management powers .
according to local media reports , ab@@ b@@ as inten@@ ds to take charge of security and intelligence units , police , civil defense , and other organizations in the new government , and then go to the interior ministry .
however , all parties are still holding consultations on this sensitive issue , and so far no further written statement has been made .

in 1997 , china became the first member of the arc@@ tic science committee and won the respect and support of the international polar affairs .
the " report " points out : over the past 20 - odd years , china 's polar observation has never mat@@ ured and has constantly developed . the initial stage of investigation has become a large scale . the three stations are a three - stop comprehensive fish@@ ery administration in the arc@@ tic ocean . that is , in february 198@@ 5 , the nan@@ ji station was established , and the dong@@ jiang station was established in february 1989 . the third station in july 2004 .
the " report " shows that by the end of 2005 , china has organized 22 large - scale ant@@ arc@@ tic scientific investigation projects , which involve more than two projects of xu@@ el@@ ong , which are built on the s@@ now@@ y vessel " the arc@@ tic research platform " which is a scientific inspection of the arc@@ tic . so far , more than 3,000 people have been inspected in person by the team members of the inspection team in the southern arc@@ tic expedi@@ tion .
the insul@@ ation is now being made to establish the third ant@@ arc@@ tic expedi@@ tion station , and is also china 's first south arc@@ tic inland observation station .
sun zhi@@ hui said :
the ca@@ ve - ins have been working for more than 20 years . china 's polar expedi@@ tion undertaking has played an important role in the world 's polar observation . however , compared with other major polar expedi@@ tions , china still has a large gap , and we must try our best to catch up with others .
he said .
sun zh@@ if@@ eng revealed that china will publish a book entitled " china 's polar exploration . "

if g@@ ow@@ wal@@ es is not allowed to take water from the lake , it will take a la@@ yer upon la@@ yer of la@@ kes .
the tu@@ an@@ tu@@ ous circle continues to be responsible for rectifying and closing enterprises .
we should regard the public notice of the 5@@ 2@@ 43 places , together with the latest information on the " falungong " propaganda activity recently reported in various localities , as an important measure to ensure the safety of min@@ ers .

xinhua news agency , gao ying , ding ying
although italy has repeatedly ordered that the du@@ y@@ r@@ in winter olympics be held in the city , the number of people who used stimul@@ ant may face the threat of prison .
the delegation is scheduled to visit the capital of the capital city of z@@ ur@@ ind@@ a , the capital of the city of z@@ ur@@ ind@@ a , after the first d@@ oping scand@@ al since the opening of the city on july 16 .
the next day , the international olympic committee announced that the k@@ it@@ chen had been sent out of the winter olympic games . she was invited to the olympic games in the winter bi@@ ath@@ on for 15 kilometers of individual - made gold med@@ als .
international winter bi@@ en@@ n@@ ial alliance , which is scheduled to hold a two - day meeting on the same day , has made a decision on the punishment of the two - year - old le@@ av@@ id k@@ it@@ a tour@@ na@@ ment .
the international olympic committee has always stipulated that athletes who have been found to be in the olympic games using stimul@@ ants will be canc@@ elled and will be depriv@@ ed of their qualifications for participating in the games , but they are not subject to legal sanctions .
however , according to italian law , athletes carrying and using stimul@@ ant drugs are part of their criminal acts , and the judiciary has the right to directly arrest and investigate the use of stimul@@ ant agents to protect the environment .
in december last year , the international olympic committee and the italian government , after a year of la@@ und@@ ry , after a la@@ yer of barg@@ ain over italy , finally reached an agreement . both sides agreed to handle the matter in accordance with the italian law during the winter olympic games in accordance with the italian law .

russian winter bi@@ ke team , which has a total of 1@@ 60 members , arrived in moscow at noon on the 17@@ th .
he has been a member of the world anti - d@@ oping agency for many years .
shi kang said : the i@@ oc and the italian government have established a series of cooperation projects in the field of anti - d@@ oping agents in winter , which have not been completely resolved . even if italian procuratorial organs truly interven@@ ed in the incident , it is hard to say in the end .
according to the previous record of italy using stimul@@ ant to its athletes , the number of cases in which the illegal players received was the highest .
therefore , the italian and@@ sa senior journalist p@@ ie@@ el@@ i said that sending le@@ v@@ a to the prison was a mic@@ ros@@ cop@@ ic phenomenon , and the top ten was more than a fine .
pi@@ er@@ re also said that although the italian court can make a short@@ fall , the italian police still have no chance to go abroad to hand over the three chinese ho@@ stages to justice .
if the le@@ av@@ a refused to accept the verdic@@ t , the italian side also could not help with it .
