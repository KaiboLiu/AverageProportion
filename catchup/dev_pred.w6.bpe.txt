the 92 - page report uses three chap@@ ters in the report on china 's military strength and the response that the united states should take . the report has directly mentioned 15 times that china has a combined or a per@@ petr@@ ated military force in china .
the world military research institute of the chinese academy of military sciences ( cas@@ s ) said that although senior us officials had repeatedly expressed similar views before , this was the first time that the united states had been raising its own defense strategy in its report on national defense strategy , and that china was the most likely to pose military challenges to the united states .
this report clearly for the first time has brought russia 's border into china as a newly emerging strategic oppon@@ ent , especially the so - called military threat from china , to more countries .
peng guang@@ qian , research fellow of the chinese academy of military sciences , said :
it is no@@ te@@ worthy that in the " four - year defense review report " formally submitted on the same day , us president bush also submitted a draft budget for fiscal 2007 to the congress , including the national defense budget reaching $ 4@@ 3@@ 9.@@ 3 - billion .
if , plus , in order to conduct military operations in iraq and afghanistan ,
peng guang@@ qian said : the us con@@ j@@ ectures and fabr@@ ication of the threat of other countries reflect the pentagon 's consistent style of manufacturing enemies , and its real purpose is to win more national defense funds and to make a huge contribution to the us arms industry .
experts said that compared with the huge military spending of the united states , china 's national defense spending is quite limited .
he has participated in military experts ' written on many occasions in china 's national defense white paper , said that since the 1990 s , with economic development , china 's national defense spending has increased somewhat , but the proportion of the national defense spending , which accounts for the same period , is on the whole , is on the decline .
official data show that comparing 2004 with 1979 , china 's national defense spending accounted for 3@@ 9.@@ 3 percent of the national financial expenditures for the same period .
in 2005 , china 's national defense spending was 24@@ 4.@@ 6@@ 56 - billion yuan , only about one - fourth of the united states , and its per capita military spending was only about one - 60 percent of that of the united states , and the average military spending per capita was about one - thir@@ ds of the us military .
the us territory and china 's territory are generally quite similar , and military spending is so big that the us is in the same size .
peng guang@@ qian said :
the research department of the china arms control and disarmament association , teng jian@@ q@@ un , said that the us side should obj@@ ectively evalu@@ ate china 's military construction situation , and china 's peaceful development does not mean that china and the united states will become their oppon@@ ents milit@@ arily in the future .
the " 2004 china 's national defense " white paper says that china firmly follows the path of peaceful development and practices a defensive national defense policy .
china did not have any hope in the past and in the future , nor would it pose a threat to any country .
so far , china has not established military bases in any other country , nor has it sent military bases to other countries .
zhu feng , professor of the international relations college of beijing university , said : china and the united states should increase communication and exchanges through the established channels to enhance mutual understanding and trust and comprehensively advance the constructive and cooperative relations between china and the united states in the new century and jointly promote world peace and development .

hamas sets up cabinet to seek breakthroughs
xinhua news agency , ram@@ al@@ lah , february 9 ( international observation ) hamas formed a cabinet to seek a breakthrough
xinhua news agency reporter wang hao , huang hao
the palestinian islamic resistance movement ( hamas ) won the election of the legisl@@ ature , how to draw up the blueprint of the new government into the focus of international attention at present .
what new policies will hamas carry out to the effect of the peace process directly affected the relevant parties ' corresponding policy orientation for the next step .
meanwhile , the bo@@ y@@ co@@ tt of the united states and israel has added vari@@ ables to the prospects of the hamas government .
at present , all sides in palestine are intensifying consultations to reach a consensus on the issues of the future development of the situation and the sensitive point in the formation of the cabinet .
the prime minister 's post will cost the family
after hamas won the right to form a cabinet , people outside the world are worried that the top hamas prime minister might have differences with the current leader ab@@ b@@ as .
moreover , the hamas leader , who is currently visiting egypt , has stressed that the palestinian new government formed by hamas will not recognize israel , and this tough signal is also aggrav@@ ating the international situation of concern .
the united states and israel clearly indicated that they would not accept a hamas government that has the real power and would threaten to cut off economic aid to palestine and to transfer taxes to the palestinian side .
however , this does not prevent hamas from making flexible strategic adjustments , and it is not easy to select an independent person .
it is reported that in order to obtain international recognition to the maximum , the hamas leaders at home and abroad who have gathered in egypt recently decided to select an independent person to the board of directors of the islamic grand school , al-@@ j@@ a@@ af@@ ar@@ i , to serve as the new prime minister .
this move has not yet received any response from the relevant parties .
palestinian analysts said that whether prime minister 's office is a little over the past , the most crucial thing is that the prime minister should try his best to play down hamas 's tough color , and only by so doing can it guarantee the success of the organization .
how should the distribution of power be carried out ?
within the party , the most serious challenge facing the cabinet of hamas is that it lacks sufficient governing experience .
the palestinian daily said in an analysis that hamas has been able to win the support of the people through social welfare projects , but in the aspect of its ruling , it lacks experience and has close ties with the palestinian national liberation movement ( fat@@ ah ) , which has the experience in ruling .
hamas proposed a new round of talks with fat@@ ah 's political partners , to jointly set up a national coalition government , but fat@@ ah has not given a positive response to this .
at present , there are some people in fat@@ ah who have different views on whether to join the cabinet or not , and they have also advocated taking part in the new government , and the other faction has refused the invitation of hamas , and are willing to do a positive opposition in the legisl@@ ature .
the informed source pointed out that under ab@@ b@@ as 's advice , fat@@ ah gradually incl@@ ined to join the new government .
even so , hamas and fat@@ ah will also hold a meeting on the distribution of cabinet positions .
in addition , the other way is to set up a legislative committee framework to separate the party from the cabinet .
it is reported that hamas has also designed a full - col@@ our expert - type government , but the specific list is unknown .
in view of the us and israel 's attitude , the technical experts - type government has also lost its role as a cabinet to reduce external pressure .
according to the palestinian " basic law , " the new legislative yuan will hold a meeting with the prime minister and form a cabinet after the new legislative council was inaug@@ ur@@ ated on 16 june .
where will the armed forces go ?
the weapons in the hands of hamas are another thor@@ ny issue facing the formation of a new government .
the us and israel have adopted a very tough attitude and resolutely demanded that hamas abandon violence and rej@@ ect its participation in politics .
hamas leader ma@@ h@@ m@@ oud al-@@ ass@@ ad stressed on 9 june that armed resistance is a key factor in the organization 's decision to pul@@ l out its own way .
the issue of armed forces actually includes the leg@@ ality of weapons and the two - dimen@@ sional management of the armed forces .
the hamas - led government , which has been elected as the first largest party in the legisl@@ ature through democratic and free means , has made its subordinate armed forces even leg@@ alized .
hamas once proposed that all parties be united as a palestinian national authority , the people 's army , but it did not receive a wide response , and it was also strongly opposed by the palestinian islamic ji@@ had organization ( j@@ a@@ ad ) .
palestine now has 6@@ 0,000 security personnel , most of whom come from the fat@@ ah camp .
moreover , fat@@ ah also has some lo@@ ose and lo@@ ose armed factions . for example , al-@@ aq@@ sa marty@@ rs ' brig@@ ades have their own cl@@ ay of the mag@@ ic eag@@ le of the marty@@ r al-@@ ass@@ ad .
hamas , which is in charge of forming a cabinet , must hold talks with ab@@ b@@ as on how to manage the armed forces of these various political parties and reason@@ ably distribu@@ te the security management power .
according to local media reports , ab@@ b@@ as inten@@ ds to take charge of security and intelligence troops , police , and civil defense organizations , while the new government 's central ministry of internal affairs will be managed by ab@@ b@@ as .
however , the parties are still discussing this sensitive issue , and so far no further progress has been made .

since it is china 's first ul@@ tr@@ a - polar investigation report , the " 2005 china polar survey report " also has a special significance for the country 's polar research project , which began in the early 1980 s , to review and sum up its polar research .
according to the " report , " in 198@@ 3 , china formally joined the " ant@@ arc@@ tic treaty " and became a member of the organization of the ant@@ arc@@ tic treaty , and it successively became a member of the ant@@ arc@@ tic scientific research council , the nan@@ chi extremely - polar bureau , and other most influential member countries of the ant@@ arc@@ tic international affairs organization .
in 1997 , china became a member of the committee of the arc@@ tic science committee and won the right to speak and make decisions on international polar affairs .
the " report " points out that over the past 20 years or so , china 's polar investigation has been out of nothing and has developed continuously , and its initial scale has already formed a third - line station , a ship - shap@@ ed , a ship - like southern pol@@ e scientific observation system , that is , the ant@@ arc@@ tic long@@ cheng station established in february 198@@ 5 , the ant@@ arc@@ tic zhong@@ shan station established in february 1989 , and the northern ant@@ arc@@ tic station established in july 2004 , and
statistics from the " report " show that by the end of 2005 , china had organized 22 national ant@@ arc@@ tic scientific surveys , two of which were based on the s@@ now@@ fla@@ kes , which were carried on the platform , to inspect the bi@@ polar science of the arc@@ tic , two of which were approved for inspection . up to now , more than 3,000 personnel have visited the northern pol@@ e of the country to inspect the area .
now we are making preparations for the establishment of the third ant@@ arc@@ tic observation station , and also the first ant@@ arc@@ tic inland inspection station in china . the mo@@ su@@ l station is doing feasibility study work .
sun zhi@@ hui said :
after more than 20 years of efforts , china 's polar survey undertaking has been playing an important role in the world 's polar observation . however , compared with other major polar research projects , china has still made a fairly big gap .
he said .
sun zhi@@ hui said that china will publish an annual report on polar research in the future .

japanese researchers develop new - type highly efficient kid@@ ney
tokyo , february 13 ( xinhua ) the east china sea university research institute of japan developed a biological human - to - kid@@ ney kid@@ ney , which not only has the same ri@@ val as human kid@@ ney
according to the ni@@ hon industrial news , the new biological man - made kid@@ ney that has been developed has mainly been composed of two parts , and part of the kid@@ ney - class kid@@ ney that has been fil@@ tered from blood , as well as the water - sub@@ machine - building mag@@ ne@@ tic - shap@@ ed le@@ ather , and the part is der@@ ived from the original ur@@ r@@ ic and gen@@ ic ac@@ id that has returned to blood .
the kid@@ ney - class , the kid@@ ney - ro@@ d , and the ur@@ ine tu@@ bes of the man - made w@@ ire are made into the cell@@ s of the middle - of - the - sky , the ur@@ ine of the man 's cor@@ n , and the inner side of the cor@@ ro@@ sion are also covered with the ur@@ ine tu@@ bes with the functions of dec@@ om@@ mis@@ si@@ oning .
this st@@ em cell can make many blood samples of diseases , which have caused the blood penetr@@ ation , and can make a penetr@@ ating analysis of the cor@@ ro@@ sion of the products of the gen@@ e of am@@ in@@ o ac@@ id and return to the blood , and at the same time it can make the most of the world 's most essential gl@@ uc@@ ose cell@@ s into the blood .

however , he pointed out that with the changes in the situation of power supply and demand and the large number of new power generating units entering into operation one after another , the production safety of electric power will face new challenges .
these challenges include : regional use of electricity in seas@@ onal seas@@ ons will still exist , and in some regions , the situation of supply and demand of electricity is still relatively tight , and because the ben@@ ign mechanism for electricity prices has not yet taken shape , there is still a fairly big problem in the supply of electricity . meanwhile , the problem of coal production quality has not been effectively controlled , and the stable operation of power generating units will be seriously affected .
shi yu@@ bo said : with the deepening of the reform of the power system , many deep - se@@ ated contradictions will be continually exposed . how to maintain the stability of the staff and workers and ensure normal production order will become a new problem facing us .
in view of the work of safe production of electric power in 2006 , shi yu@@ bo said that it is necessary to further sol@@ i@@ dif@@ y the basic work of the management of safe production of electricity , speed up the establishment and improvement of the mechanism for emergency management of power supply , enhance the ability to cope with emer@@ gen@@ cies , strengthen coordination and cooperation in the power sector , and continue to do a good job in supervising and managing the safe building of the dam and the building of an information - based
it is learned that in light of the new situation in the management of electric power safety , the china electrical and power commission will conduct a thorough investigation of the " provisional regulations on investigating the production of electricity " that have been promulgated this year . meanwhile , the second system for ensuring safety in the water power station 's safety and the second - time system for the power plant will be promulgated this year .
in 2005 , china 's total electricity consumption reached 2@@ 4.@@ 6@@ 8@@ 9 trillion kil@@ ow@@ at@@ t - hours , up 13.@@ 4@@ 55 percent over the same period last year .
in the face of the situation of power supply and demand , the contradictions between coal , electricity , and oil transportation are conspicuous , and various power enterprises have adopted effective measures to strengthen equipment management . last year , there were no major equipment accidents in the nation 's electric power production .
the number of power gr@@ i@@ ds that occurred 74 times , decreas@@ ing 1@@ 27 times compared with the same period last year , and 4@@ 27 equipment accidents were reported , down 13@@ 2 times from the same period last year .

fu k@@ ang@@ ning said that the south african government hopes to reduce the crime rate to zero and hope that every south african citizen who works in south africa will have a better life and property safety .
since 2006 , four of the chinese nationals have been arrested in south africa one after another , and the chinese world has expressed extensive concern over this .
the chinese foreign ministry has made representations to the south african side and has reminded chinese nationals in south africa to further enhance their awareness of safety and prevention . the overseas chinese have strengthened unity and friendship and cooper@@ ated with the police in cracking down on criminal activities .
let 's express the most sincere sympathy and sor@@ row to the family of the victims .
fu k@@ ang@@ ning said that we are sor@@ ry for this and we also ask the chinese people to believe that the south african government is seriously investigating every case involving china .
according to the chinese embassy in south africa , south african police have successfully cracked the case of chen jian@@ qing , a chinese woman in fujian , who was in south africa on 5 february , and a suspect has been arrested .
the police are now hun@@ ting another suspect .
according to the south african embassy in china , the south african business@@ man who was suspected of gun@@ ing and killing hong kong businessmen was arrested by the south african police and the property of the victims was recovered .
speaking of the possible negative impact of the chinese citizen 's ass@@ as@@ sin@@ ation , fu k@@ ang@@ ning said that these incidents would indeed affect the development of trade between the two countries and other fields .
according to the tourism commissioner of the south african embassy , the embassy had only opened a new train of food and clothing to more than 2,000 chinese people in the first 15 days of this year .
according to china 's official statistics , south africa will continue to maintain its position as the largest trade partner of china in africa in 2005 .
the bilateral trade volume reached $ 7@@ 2@@ 70 million , an increase of 2@@ 30 percent over the same period last year .
however , people in the tourism industry believe that the series of incidents of chinese citizens ' ass@@ as@@ sin@@ ation in 2004 has a notic@@ eable impact on the number of chinese tourists going to south africa .
according to statistics released by the south african tourism bureau , in the first half of 2005 , chinese tourists to south africa were 20@@ 31 , a decrease of 14.@@ 9 percent compared with the same period last year .
currently , chinese living in south africa are about 200,000 people , and the city and countryside in south africa are all in south africa .
analysts here believe that the gap between the rich and the poor in south africa , the high unemployment rate , and the un@@ checked spread of guns , and the threat of death penalty have not been maintained , and the crime rate is still high .
because many chinese do not understand english , there is cash in their possession and their home , and it is more likely to become the target of criminal elements ' pursuit of money .

( winter olympics ) stimul@@ ants news analysis : sending out a v@@ ou@@ cher incident may not be a clear - cut one .
xinhua news agency , du@@ ling@@ le , february 17 , press analysis : the issue of sending a du@@ ow@@ ei to be settled may be un@@ settled
xinhua news agency reporter gao ying
although italy has repeatedly issued orders , the du@@ ling winter olympics has been un@@ covered by the use of stimul@@ ants , and the players may face the threat of prison 's per@@ mis@@ sible , but now they have seen from various situations that such situations are not very likely to occur in this winter olympics .
the tur@@ in winter olympics opened on 16 june , the first d@@ oping scand@@ al since its opening , with o@@ '@@ clock factions being discovered that they used banned drugs , non - drug - related cards .
the next day , the international olympic committee announced that it had sent out al@@ v@@ are@@ ka to the winter olympics , and she had won the second - quarter women 's 15 - km individual champion@@ ship in this winter olympics .
the international winter 2@@ nd league made a special contribution to the country 's par@@ ade on the same day .
the i@@ oc has been stipul@@ ating that the athletes have been found to have used stimul@@ ants in the olympic games and will be removed from their grades and depriv@@ ed of their quali@@ fication for the competition , but they are not subject to legal sanctions .
however , according to italian law , the number of people carrying and using stimul@@ ants is a crime , and the judiciary has the right to directly arrest and investigate the use of stimul@@ ants , so as to test the law by taking the lead .
last december , the international olympic committee and the italian government , after a year of barg@@ aining , paid back the price , finally reached an agreement . both sides agreed to hold a meeting in the italian law during this winter olympics to deal with the incident of the use of stimul@@ ants by the italian athletes .
with the unremitting efforts of the international olympic committee , the italian side made a concession four days before the opening of the winter olympics , promising that the police would not enter the olympic village to conduct a search on the athle@@ te 's place , but the drug inspection team , which is showing a positive attitude , will still be subj@@ ected to the italian procuratorial organ 's investigation .
it is reported that the italian government supervis@@ es the performance of the du@@ in winter olympics , and it has sent a team of v@@ il@@ la@@ ins to the du@@ pon@@ t prosecu@@ tor 's office .
however , the i@@ oc and p@@ ast@@ and@@ er@@ sen themselves have not confirmed the matter .
the russian winter two teams , te@@ am@@ work , san@@ to@@ s , revealed on the 17@@ th that the russian team had left du@@ bai and returned to china .
the united states , which has been working for many years in the world anti - d@@ oping agency , believes that once a v@@ ou@@ cher is sent back to china , this matter will eventually be un@@ clear .
shi said that the i@@ oc and the italian government have been playing an important role in the fight against stimul@@ ants in the winter olympics .
according to the previous italian use of stimul@@ ants against their national athletes , the number of illegal immigrants has increased by a maximum of 10 percent .
therefore , the senior reporter of the italian am@@ az@@ a news agency , pin@@ o@@ ch@@ et , said that the possibility of sending le@@ v@@ a into the prison was not very easy , and most of the in@@ sec@@ ts were fine .
pi@@ er@@ re also said that although the italian court could hold a trial , the italian police could not go abroad to send troops to italy .
if they send le@@ v@@ a to refuse to accept the verdic@@ t , the italian side will have no way to take her .
