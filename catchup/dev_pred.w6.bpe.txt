the work of graduates on an hour is mainly concentrated on the relatively strong knowledge - based and skilled jobs such as professional skills , job - see@@ kers , and job see@@ kers with a strong sense of age .
the number of hours work skills required for some of the posts is not high , such as food promotion personnel , the d@@ an@@ i@@ el ro@@ ch@@ man , etc. , and unemployed personnel can take up employment after simple training .

experts believe that this is a major contribution to china 's normal national defense construction , ex@@ ag@@ ger@@ ating the military threat of china , and a threat to china 's internal affairs .
the " four - year defense evaluation report " is the new defense guidance document of the pentagon .
the 92 - page report , which exp@@ ounds china 's military strength in three par@@ agr@@ ap@@ h@@ s and the countermeasures the united states should take , has 15 directly mentioned the country 's traditional production capacity or its size , which directly mention china 's 15 or the united states ' two terms , which are the main and emerging major powers , and the most important thing for china to engage in military competition with the united states , and if the united states does not have any counter@@ measure , china may develop a bad
the director of the world military research department of the chinese academy of military sciences , yao yun@@ zhu , said that although senior us officials had repeatedly expressed similar viewpoints before , this was the first time in the strategic report on national defense , which proposed that china is most likely to pose a military challenge to the united states .
the report clearly defin@@ es russia 's military power , the use of china as a new strategic oppon@@ ent , especially the so - called military threat theory of china .
peng guang@@ qian , research fellow of the chinese academy of military sciences , said :
what merits attention is that in the " four - year defense evaluation report " 's formal submitted one day , us president bush also delivered a bill to congress on the 2007 fiscal year budget , including the national defense budget reaching $ 4@@ 3@@ 9.@@ 3 - billion .
if added to the security measures to be carried out in iraq and afghanistan ,
peng guang@@ qian said that the united states ' fabr@@ ication of the other countries ' threat method reflects the fabr@@ ic of the pentagon that inv@@ ents have consistently made the enemy , and its real purpose is to strive for more national defense funds , so as to fish more for the huge us arms industry group .
experts said that compared with the huge military expenditure of the united states , china 's national defense expenditure is quite limited .
he has participated in many times in military experts , deng hong@@ zhou , who had participated in the comp@@ il@@ ation of china 's national defense white paper , said : as the economy develops in the 1990 s , china 's national defense spending has increased , but the proportion of the national financial expenditure in the same period has generally declined .
official data show that comparing 2004 with 1979 , the proportion of china 's national defense expenditures in the national financial expenditure for the same period has dropped by nearly 10 percentage points .
in 2005 , china 's national defense budget was 24@@ 4.@@ 6@@ 56 billion yuan , only about one - third of the united states ' , and its per capita military expenditure was only about one - sixth of that of the united states , and the per - capita military expenditure was about one - thir@@ ty us military .
the area of the us territory is r@@ oughly equal to china 's territory , but the difference in military expenditure is so huge . who is the military strength that actually exceeds the legitimate defense needs is not the same .
peng guang@@ qian said :
the research department of the china arms control and disarmament association , teng jian@@ q@@ un , said that the us side should obj@@ ectively evalu@@ ate china 's military construction , and china 's peaceful development does not mean that china and the united states will become military ad@@ vers@@ aries in the future .
the " 2004 china 's national defense " white paper says : china firmly follows the path of peaceful development and adop@@ ts a defensive national defense policy .
china did not have any intr@@ ins@@ ic effect on any country in the past or now .
so far , china has not established any military bases in any other country , nor has it sent out one soldier to other countries ;
professor zhu feng of the international relations college of beijing university said : china and the united states should increase their communication and exchanges through the established channels , and enhance understanding and trust , so as to comprehensively promote the development of sino - us constructive and cooperative relations in the new century and jointly promote world peace and development .

hamas sets up cabinet to seek breakthrough in hamas
xinhua news agency , ram@@ al@@ lah , february 9 ( international observation ) hamas has been trying to break through the cabinet of hamas
xinhua news agency reporter , wang hao ,
the palestinian islamic resistance movement ( hamas ) won the election of the legislative council , how to draw up a new government blueprint has become a major focus of international attention .
what new policy will hamas pursue will directly affect the peace process parties concerned in the next step of policy direction .
at the same time , the us and israel 's bo@@ y@@ co@@ tt has added vari@@ ables to the future of the hamas government .
at present , all sides in palestine are stepping up consultations to reach a consensus on the issues of the difficulty and sensitive point in forming a cabinet that will affect the development of the future situation .
the premier post will take some time to go .
after hamas won the right to form the cabinet , people outside worried that hamas 's supreme prime minister might have a dispute with the current leader ab@@ b@@ as .
in addition , hamas leader ma@@ h@@ al , who is visiting egypt , stressed that the new palestinian government , led by hamas , will not recognize israel , and this tough signal has also aggrav@@ ated international concern .
the united states and israel clearly indicated that they would not accept a hamas government that holds the real power , and threatened to suspend economic aid to palestine and transfer taxes to palestine .
however , this does not prevent hamas from making flexible strategic adjustments , choos@@ ing independence people is a compromise .
it is reported that in order to obtain international recognition to the maximum , hamas , which was recently gathering in egypt , decided to choose an independent person , the board chairman of the board of directors of the islamic university of ch@@ ad , al-@@ hus@@ ay@@ n , to be the new prime minister .
this move has not received any response from the parties concerned .
palestinian analy@@ st hus@@ se@@ in said that no matter who will spend the prime minister 's post , the most crucial thing is that the choice of choice of choice should be to play down as much as possible the tough color of hamas . only by so doing will it be possible to ensure the success of forming a cabinet .
how to alloc@@ ate power
from an internal perspective , the greatest challenge facing hamas in forming a cabinet is the lack of sufficient governing experience .
the palestinian paper , in a written analysis , said that hamas , through social welfare projects , has gathered people 's minds , but in the aspect of governance it lacks experience and is closely related to the liberation movement of the palestinian people ( fat@@ ah ) , which has the experience of governance .
hamas proposed to hold talks with fat@@ ah political partners after the election , and jointly set up a national coalition government , but fat@@ ah has not given any positive response to this .
at present , whether or not fat@@ ah will be in the cabinet is different , and one faction advocates participation in the new government , thus doing something , while the other ref@@ uses hamas 's invitation and is willing to play a active role in the legislative yuan .
the informed source pointed out that under ab@@ b@@ as 's advice , fat@@ ah gradually ten@@ ds to join the new government .
even so , hamas and fat@@ ah will also hold a joint statement on the distribution of their cabinet posts .
another way is to set up a legislative committee framework , which is divor@@ ced from the party - aff@@ ili@@ ated cabinet .
it has been reported that hamas has also designed a clean and expert - type government , but the specific list is unknown .
in view of the attitude of the united states and israel , the technical expert - type government is no doubt a cabinet - forming method to reduce external pressure .
according to the palestinian basic law , the new palestinian legislative council will hold a general election after the new legislative council takes office on 16 february .
where is the armed forces going ?
the weapons in hamas 's hands are another thor@@ ny issue facing the formation of a new government .
the us and israel have adopted a very tough attitude and resolutely demanded that hamas abandon violence and rej@@ ect its participation in politics with guns .
hamas leader ma@@ h@@ al stressed on 9 july that armed resistance is the intr@@ uding strategic choice of the organization .
the issue of armed forces actually includes the leg@@ ality of weapons and the two levels of the administration of the armed forces .
hamas has been elected as a legislative council by means of democracy and freedom , and it has been recognized internationally , and armed factions within its subordinate armed factions have similarly leg@@ alized the use of force to leg@@ alize the hamas - led security organizations .
hamas once proposed to unify all factions into the palestinian national authority , the people 's army , but it did not receive a wide response .
palestine currently owns more than 6@@ 0,000 security personnel , most of them came from the fat@@ ah camp .
moreover , fat@@ ah also has some other subordinate organizations that have lo@@ ose organizational relations , such as the al@@ k@@ s@@ sa marty@@ rs brigade , the pl@@ ug of the tar@@ im , etc.
hamas , which is in charge of forming a cabinet , must hold talks with ab@@ b@@ as on how to manage the armed forces that are each of the ruling parties , and reason@@ ably alloc@@ ate security authority .
according to local media , ab@@ b@@ as inten@@ ds to take charge of security and intelligence forces , police , civil defense , and other organizations , while the new government is under the jurisdiction of the interior ministry .
however , the parties are still holding consultations on this sensitive issue , and so far no further news has been received .

however , he pointed out that with the changes in the situation of power supply and demand and the successive in@@ putting of a large number of newly built power generating units into operation , power production safety will face new challenges .
these challenges include : regional seas@@ onal hy@@ per@@ links , hy@@ per@@ link , power shortage , supply of electricity in some areas , and power supply in some areas remain tight , and because the ben@@ ign mechanism for power prices has not yet taken shape , there still exist a relatively large problem in power supply , and at the same time , the problem of the decline in power quality has not been effectively controlled , which will have a serious impact on the stable operation of power generating equipment , and some of the existing

beijing , february 17 ( xinhua ) the four major accidents in the past four years have occurred in a row , with the number of accidents involving more than 100 people rising to a record high , causing the country 's production to slow down , the official said
the reporter learned from the state administration of production safety on 17 july that in order to truly curb the excessive occurrence of extra@@ ordin@@ arily serious accidents such as coal mines , the coal mine is the most important of all .
this year , the state administration of safety will do the following three things well :
i continued to do a good job in tackling the tough battle .
the w@@ af@@ er administration should take the pul@@ l first and use the la@@ yer before it can be found in a prominent position this year .
if the high gas mine does not have a pre - requ@@ isition , then it must be ordered to immediately stop production according to law .
i will continue to do a good job in rectifying and closing down hard - line operations .
we should make the 5@@ 2@@ 43 that have already been made public to the public , and the 700 - plus coal mines recently reported by various localities a single case of death .
we should regard closing down as a regular task and close down those enterprises that do not have the safety conditions for destroying resources .
the safety of coal mines should be strengthened .
we must immediately correct problems that impe@@ de the development of small state - owned large mines , and guide and manage the dis@@ orderly management of small mines .
in particular , we must pay attention to key state - owned coal mines , and we absolutely cannot allow un@@ authorized production of extra - intensity personnel .
this year 's production safety control index demands that the number of deaths of various accidents nationwide dropped by 3 percent from last year , of which coal mines dropped by 3.5 percent .
one death tol@@ l of more than 10 people and number of accidents should be reduced by 5 percent , of which 7 percent is down from the coal mine .
these control indices have been assigned to all provincial people 's governments , and various localities are now at the grassroots level dec@@ lining to the grassroots level and enterprises .

( winter olympics stimul@@ ants ) news analysis : sending out a member of the si@@ k@@ ens incident is likely to end up without end .
du@@ in , february 17 ( xinhua ) the following is a news analysis : the incident of sending out du@@ ow@@ a may not be over
xinhua news agency reporter gao ying
although italy has repeatedly said that tur@@ in winter olympics will be held , the number of people who used stimul@@ ants was probably not much of the prison .
tur@@ in winter olympics opened on 16 june , the first pioneering d@@ oping scand@@ al involving d@@ oping has occurred , and al@@ var@@ a le@@ v@@ a has been found to have used banned drugs .
the next day , the international olympic committee announced that it had been sent out of the winter games , and she had won the gold med@@ al in the winter games at the current winter olympics .
the international winter bi@@ en@@ n@@ ial alliance made a statement on the same day regarding the two - year ban on the sub@@ mission of the le@@ v@@ ds .
the i@@ oc has always stipulated that athletes have been un@@ covered in the olympic games using stimul@@ ants and will be eliminated and be stri@@ pped of their quali@@ fication to participate , but not legally sanc@@ tioned .
however , according to italian law , the number of people carrying and using stimul@@ ants bel@@ ongs to criminal acts , and the judiciary has the right to directly arrest and investigate the use of stimul@@ ants , and to use the body of the def@@ ence att@@ or@@ ney to face a three - month prison term which is not yet three years .
last december , the international olympic committee and the italian government , through a year of barg@@ aining , paid a low price for the i@@ oc and reached an agreement , and both sides agreed to conduct a comprehensive review of the use of stimul@@ ant by the athle@@ te according to the italian law during the winter olympic games .
with the unremitting efforts of the international olympic committee , the italian side made a concession four days before the opening of the winter olympic games , promising that the police would not enter the olympic village to search the athle@@ te 's place during the winter games , but the drug scre@@ ening con@@ tested athletes will still be investigated by the italian procuratorial organ .
it has been reported that the italian government supervis@@ es the tur@@ in winter olympics , pe@@ s@@ k@@ r@@ it , has already sent the stimul@@ ant to the italian government to du@@ pon@@ t .
however , the i@@ oc and pe@@ ter s . pe@@ ter s@@ and@@ y have not yet confirmed the matter .
russia 's two teams of winter med@@ al , and@@ re@@ w , disclosed at noon on 17 april that the russian team left du@@ bai and returned to the country .
the chinese government has worked for many years in the world anti - d@@ oping agency , shi k@@ ang@@ cheng , who believes that once le@@ av@@ a is sent back to china , this matter will ultimately be un@@ clear .
shi said the i@@ oc and the italian government have made great efforts in the fight against d@@ oping in the winter olympics , and have not completely solved the problem even if the italian procuratorial organ really got involved in the matter , the result was very difficult to tell .
according to the previous italian side 's understanding of the incident of using stimul@@ ants by its own athletes , the maximum penalty received by the viol@@ ators is only two years of imprisonment , the pen@@ alties being carried out within the prison period .
therefore , senior reporter p@@ el@@ e of the italian ant@@ a society said that sending le@@ v@@ a into the prison was not so likely . the multi - purpose model is to impose a fine .
pi@@ er@@ re also said that although the italian court could conduct a def@@ aul@@ t trial , the italian police could not send them abroad to the foreign country to take their sentences .
if le@@ y@@ v@@ a ref@@ uses to accept the verdic@@ t , the italian side will have no way to take her .
