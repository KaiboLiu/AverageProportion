the chinese academy of military sciences [ cas@@ s ] research fellow yao yun@@ zhu said that although the us high - ranking officials have stated many times that they are similar to the previous ones , this is the first time the us has made a major revision of the national defense strategic report , and china is the most likely country that will pose a military challenge to the united states .
the chinese government has always attached great importance to the development of russia 's industry , and has made it clear for the first time that russia 's tun@@ e industry is the key factor in the report , especially the so - called china military threat theory , which has given more attention to the military threat of china , and that the focus of attention is the focus of attention . the main reason why the report does not include the industry itself , the industry , industry , industry , industry , industry , industry , industry
the chinese academy of military sciences ( c@@ as ) has made major contributions to the development of the military and the modernization of the armed forces .
it is no@@ te@@ worthy that in the " 4 - year defense review report , " the " report on national defense education " formally submitted the same day , us president bush also submitted the defense budget for fiscal 2007 to congress , among which the defense budget reached $ 4@@ 3.@@ 3 - billion .
the united states will also be able to provide the iraqi government with the assistance of the united states if it is added to the military action in iraq and afghanistan .
peng guang@@ qian said : the united states ' gu@@ ess@@ ing the threat of other countries has reflected the pentagon 's policy of creating the enemies of the pentagon . its real purpose is to win more support from the national defense budget , and to provide the huge military industry group of the united states with more opportunities for profits .
experts said that compared with the huge amount of military spending of the united states , china 's national defense spending is quite limited .
zeng qinghong , who has participated in many occasions in the drafting of china 's national defense white paper , said : in the 1990 s , with the development of the economy , china 's defense spending has increased , but the proportion of the state 's financial expenditure in the same period has shown a tendency of decline .
the official statistics show that the total volume of trade between china and the united states in 2004 and 1979 was 3@@ 7.@@ 8 percent higher than that of the same period of last year .
april 2005 china 's gdp will reach $ 2@@ 4.@@ 4 - billion , an increase of 2@@ 7.@@ 5 percent over the us figure .
the united states ' hom@@ eland area and china 's territorial area are r@@ oughly equal , and its military spending is so big .
peng guang@@ qian said :
the china arms control and disarmament association research department director teng jian@@ q@@ un said : the us side should obj@@ ectively evalu@@ ate the state of china 's military construction , china 's peaceful development does not mean that china and the united states will cooperate milit@@ arily in the future .
the " 2004 china international aviation and aerospace exhibition " says that china firmly supports the path of peaceful development and is implementing a defensive national defense policy .
the chinese past and present have not been much fru@@ it@@ less about any country .
so far , china has not established any military presence in any other country .
professor li yi@@ hu , professor of the international relations college of beijing university , said : china and the united states should , through the established channels , increase communication and exchanges , enhance understanding and mutual trust , and push forward sino - us constructive and cooperative relations in an all - round way in the new century so as to jointly promote the maintenance of world peace and development .

hamas will pursue what kind of new policy will directly affect peace process .
at the same time , the united states and israel have even more clearly expressed their views on the prospects of the hamas government .
at present , all parties in palestine are stepping up their consultations to reach a consensus on the issue of forming a cabinet , which involves the future development of the situation .
( sub@@ title ) the premier post has left a lot of money and the people are not willing to pay for the post of premier .
hamas won the right to form a cabinet , and some people in the outside world worried that hamas 's prime minister might discuss the current top leader ab@@ b@@ as .
moreover , as the us president who is currently visiting egypt , m@@ ash@@ el emphasized that the palestinian government , which is formed by hamas , will not recognize israel . this is a hard - line signal .
the united states and israel have clearly indicated that they will not accept a single hamas government that has real power , and have threatened to inter@@ rup@@ t the economic aid to palestine and transfer taxes to palestine .
however , this does not mean that hamas will take any flexible and pragmatic approach .
according to reports , in order to maxim@@ ize the international recognition , the state council recently organized a group of hamas leaders at home and abroad who gathered in egypt to select an independent palestinian figure , the president of the board of directors of the gaza islamic university , j@@ ay@@ ak@@ ar@@ ta , to become the new prime minister .
this important move has not been approved by the relevant parties .
palestinian analysts said that the united states is still trying to find a way out of the current situation in palestine , whether it is the prime minister or the prime minister .
( sub@@ title ) the power issue is a major issue that must be addressed in the course of the reform of the cadre management system .
from the internal aspect , hamas formed a cabinet and faced the biggest challenge .
palestinian " life daily " reported that the palestinian leader , who had been trying to seek a settlement through social welfare projects , had ass@@ em@@ bled people . however , in the aspect of governance , hamas l@@ acked experience and gained a good grasp of the palestinian national liberation movement ( fat@@ ah ) , which is in power .
hamas has won the election , and it has proposed to establish a political alliance with fat@@ ah .
the fat@@ ah internal committee is now discussing whether to enter the cabinet .
the news was that the central authorities have been making efforts to persu@@ ade ab@@ b@@ as to stop the bloo@@ dy cl@@ ashes .
even so , the united states and the united states have also reached a consensus on the issue of the distribution of cabinet positions .
in addition , another man , who was forming a legislative committee framework , also cut off the party 's aff@@ iliation .
according to reports , hamas also designed a new palestinian state .
in view of the fact that the united states and israel have different at@@ titu@@ des , the technical speci@@ alist government has not lost its form of forming a cabinet to reduce external pressure .
according to the palestinian basic law , the palestinian government will not be allowed to hold a referendum on the issue of the new legislative committee 's inauguration on 16 july .
( sub@@ title ) the armed forces must follow the same course .
hamas has a large quantity of weapons to form a new government .
the united states and israel have adopted a very tough stance and resolutely demanded that hamas abandon violence and refuse to use arms to take part in government .
hamas leader m@@ ash@@ el said on 9 july that armed resistance is the main reason of the organization 's strategic choice .
the armed issue is actually a question of leg@@ ality of weapons and the status of armed forces .
hamas has won the support of the international community through democracy and freedom .
hamas once proposed that the various factions be unified .
palestinian currently has 6@@ 0,000 troops , and the number of palestinian security personnel is most from fat@@ ah 's camp .
moreover , the fat@@ ah government also has some organizations .
the us federal reserve , which is responsible for forming the cabinet , must discuss with ab@@ b@@ as how to manage these armed forces that are run by itself , and ration@@ ally distribu@@ te security management power .
according to local media reports , ab@@ b@@ as inten@@ ds to take charge of security and intelligence units , police and civil defense organs , while the new government 's ministry of interior affairs , will be managed by the latter .
however , all parties have also reached consensus on this sensitive issue .
