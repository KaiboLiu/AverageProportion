what merits attention is that the united states has made clear its stance on the taiwan issue in its " four - year defense evaluation report " on the same day that the us president bush also submitted the report to congress on the fiscal year 2007 , of which the national defense budget has reached $ 4@@ 3.@@ 9 - billion .
the united states is now trying to use the iraq war to contain the united states .
mr p@@ ang said that the us gu@@ ess@@ es the stat@@ ue of the u . s . threat of the u . s . military buil@@ ders the consistent style of the u . s . military bases in the south , and their real purpose is to obtain more national defense funds and to gain more profits for the us m@@ uni@@ tions industry .
experts say that compared with the us arms sales , the us military spending is more than $ 2 billion , and china 's national defense spending is quite limited .
zeng qinghong , member of the political bureau of the cpc central committee and vice chairman of the central military commission , said that the chinese people have been able to achieve a great leap in national defense in the early 1990 s , along with the development of the economy .
the official data show that in 2004 , the number of people who were killed in the war was more than half of the national financial expenditures for the same period .
in 2005 , china 's national defense spending was $ 2@@ 4.@@ 6@@ 56 - billion , an increase of only a considerable portion of the us national defense spending , and the per capita military spending is only about one - third of the us 's total , while the military 's per - capita military spending is about one - third of the us military 's total .
the united states ' national territory and the chinese territory are very limited .
mr p@@ ang said that the government had been working closely with the government .
china 's arms control and disarmament association research department director teng jian@@ q@@ un said that the us side should obj@@ ectively evalu@@ ate china 's military construction , and china 's peaceful development is not meant to im@@ ply that china and the united states will strengthen military cooperation in the future .
the " 2004 china international aviation and aerospace exhibition " says that china firmly supports the path of peaceful development and is implementing a defensive national defense policy .
china has been and is not at present , and will not pose any threat to any country .
so far , china has not made any progress in establishing a military base in any other country , nor has it sent out military bases to other countries .
professor li yi@@ hu of the international relations institute of beijing university said that the two countries should further strengthen their cooperation in the fields of communications and exchanges through the already established channels .

( international observation ) the hamas organization 's efforts to form a cabinet to seek a breakthrough
xinhua news agency , l@@ am@@ al@@ a , february 9 ( reporter : international observation ) the hamas cabinet is seeking to break through the barri@@ er of the cabinet to seek a breakthrough in the palestinian - israeli conflict , a palestinian official said here today .
xinhua news agency , beijing , nov. 24 ,
the palestinian islamic resistance movement ( hamas ) has won the legislative committee election and won the election .
the hamas will take the road of what new policies will directly affect the relevant parties in the peace process .
at the same time , the us and israel 's bo@@ y@@ co@@ tt attitude has also added new vari@@ ables to the prospects of the hamas government .
at present , all parties in palestine are stepping up consultations to hold a comprehensive discussion on the issue of forming a cabinet which involves the future development of the situation .
( sub@@ title ) the premier post is a job that is left with the money that is left by the premier .
the hamas has won the election of a cabinet , and some people in the outside world are worried that hamas 's prime minister might be linked with the current supreme leader ab@@ b@@ as .
and , as the chinese president , who is visiting egypt , said , " we are not only in the middle of the palestinian people but also in the middle east . "
the united states and israel have clearly expressed their ref@@ us@@ al to accept a hamas government that has the power to hold the real power and threatened to inter@@ rup@@ t the economic aid to palestine and handed over taxes to palestine .
however , this does not mean that hamas is not in a flexible strategy .
according to reports , in order to maxim@@ ize the international recognition , the united states recently gathered in egypt to hold a meeting of the palestinian leaders to elect the independent palestinian candidate , the i@@ a@@ af board chairman , j@@ ab@@ er j@@ a@@ af@@ ar@@ i , as the new prime minister .
this is the first time that the relevant parties have made a response .
the palestinian analysts , hus@@ se@@ in , said that no matter how high the prime minister 's position is , the most crucial thing is that the candidate for the prime minister should be reduced as much as possible , and the wor@@ st fr@@ ame of hamas 's hard - line position can only be guaranteed .
( sub@@ title ) the power is distributed to the people , and the question of how to distribu@@ te power is a question of how to distribu@@ te power .
from the internal perspective , hamas has formed a cabinet , and the biggest challenge facing it is the lack of sufficient experience in governance .
the palestinian " sun@@ sh@@ ine " said in its analysis that the hamas has been able to achieve its goal of sec@@ uring its own interests through social welfare projects , but it lacks experience in governing and is also in keeping with the palestinian national liberation movement ( fat@@ ah ) , which has its experience in ruling .
the hamas ' election will be a major event in the palestinian - israeli conflict , which has been the focus of the arab - israeli conflict .
the french government has been trying to make a decision on whether to enter the cabinet .
according to the source , the central authorities have been making efforts to resolve the issue of the palestinian - israeli conflict , and have been trying to bring about a political solution to the palestinian - israeli conflict .
even though the united states has not yet established a formal relationship with fat@@ ah , it is still too early to say that it is not easy to make any decision on the issue of the allocation of cabinet posts .
in addition , another man was killed in the legislative yuan .
according to reports , hamas also designed a new security council , which is a clean - type government , but the specific list is un@@ founded .
in view of the fact that the united states and israel have different at@@ titu@@ des and technical experts , the us government has no choice but to form a cabinet to reduce external pressure .
according to the palestinian basic law , the palestinian people will be allowed to enter the palestinian national authority after the new legislative committee takes office on 16 june .
( sub@@ title ) the armed forces should be armed .
the hamas ' weapons and equipment are the first to be built up in the new government .
the united states and israel have a very tough attitude and resolutely demanded that hamas abandon violence and rej@@ ect the use of armed ri@@ fl@@ es .
the hamas leader ma@@ ha@@ th@@ ir stressed on the 9@@ th that the armed resistance was the result of the organization 's strategy of becoming a crack of the mou@@ th .
the armed forces are actually included in the leg@@ ality of weapons and the armed forces ' ownership of the armed forces .
the hamas has been trying to win the election through democracy and freedom .
the hamas once proposed that all factions be unified , and that the palestinian national authority be the main force of the people , but it did not receive extensive response , and it was also met with strong opposition from the palestinian islamic ji@@ had ( j@@ a@@ af ) .
the palestinian authority has 6@@ 0,000 troops in the region , and the majority of them are from the fat@@ ah camp .
and , in addition , fat@@ ah and some other organizations have been lo@@ os@@ ed in their organizational relations , such as the y@@ a@@ ak@@ ar@@ ta marty@@ rs brig@@ ades , the q@@ al@@ a class , the haw@@ ks of the gu@@ ant@@ an@@ am@@ o .
the group of government officials responsible for the formation of the cabinet must hold talks with ab@@ b@@ as on how to manage these armed forces that are run by each other , and ration@@ ally distribu@@ te security management powers .
according to local media , the ab@@ b@@ as inten@@ ds to be in charge of security and intelligence units , police and civil air defense organizations , but the new government will be returned by the interior ministry .
however , all parties have still reached a consensus on this sensitive issue , and so far there has not been any further progress .
