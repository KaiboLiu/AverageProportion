zhang jun@@ ji@@ u , research fellow of the world military research department of the chinese academy of military sciences , said : although the senior us military officer has expressed similar views many times , this is the first time that the united states has proposed in the report on national defense strategy that china is the most likely emerging big power that might pose a military challenge to the united states .
the report clearly and definitely includes the first time that russia 's tam@@ ar with china as a new strategic oppon@@ ent , especially its so - called china military threat theory .
peng guang@@ qian , research fellow of the chinese academy of military sciences , said :
what merits attention is that in the " report on the four - year defense review , " the same day , us president bush also submitted a draft bill on the defense budget for 2007 to congress , of which the defense budget for the fiscal year of 2007 was $ 4@@ 3.@@ 9 billion .
if the p@@ air is added to the military exercise in iraq and afghanistan ,
peng guang@@ qian maintained that the united states ' specul@@ ation of the tricks of using other countries ' theory to create enemies of the pentagon has been reflected in the consistent style of the pentagon , and its real purpose is to strive for more national defense funds and to win more support for the huge us arms industry .
experts said that compared with the huge military spending of the united states , china 's national defense spending is quite limited .
he has participated in many military experts written by china 's national defense white paper , deng hong@@ zhou , who said : since the 1990 s of the 20 th century , with economic development , china 's national defense spending has increased somewhat , but the proportion of national financial expenditures in the same period has shown a down@@ ward trend .
official data show that in 2004 , compared with 1979 , china 's national defense spending accounted for over one - third of the total national financial expenditures for the same period .
china 's defense spending in 2005 was 24@@ 4.@@ 6@@ 56 billion yuan , only equivalent to only about half of the us $ 14 billion , and its per capita military spending was equivalent to about 1 / 14 of the united states , and the per capita military spending was about one - third of the us military .
the land area of the united states and china 's territory are r@@ oughly equal , but the gap in military spending is so huge . in the end , who has exceeded the normal defense needs , is this not a word .
peng guang@@ qian said :
the research department of the china arms control and disarmament association , teng jian@@ q@@ un , said that the us side should obj@@ ectively assess the situation of china 's military construction , and that china 's peaceful development does not mean that china and the united states will become their military oppon@@ ent in the future .
the " 2004 china national defense " white paper said : china firmly follows the road of peaceful development and practices defensive national defense policy .
china has not been able to achieve such a great impact on any country in the past and in the future .
so far , china has not established military bases in any other country , nor has it sent military bases to other countries .
professor zhu feng of the international relations college of beijing university said : china and the united states should , through established channels , increase communication and exchanges , enhance mutual understanding and trust , and comprehensively promote the development of sino - us constructive and cooperative relations in the new century and jointly promote world peace and development .

hamas to form cabinet to seek breakthroughs
xinhua news agency , ram@@ al@@ lah , february 9 ( international observation ) hamas formed a cabinet to seek a breakthrough
xinhua news agency reporter wang hao and huang ji@@ ao
the palestinian islamic resistance movement ( hamas ) won the election of the legislative council , how to draw a blueprint for the new government has become a major issue of concern in the international community today .
what kind of new policy hamas will pursue will directly affect the next step of the peace process the parties concerned will follow .
at the same time , the us and israel 's bo@@ y@@ co@@ tt has added to the prospects of the hamas government .
at present , the parties of palestine are stepping up consultations and are discussing the issues of future development in the cabinet .
premier position spending too much money ( sub@@ head )
hamas has been able to form a cabinet , and some people in the outside are worried that hamas 's prime minister might have differences with the current top leader ab@@ b@@ as .
moreover , visiting hamas president ma@@ h@@ m@@ oud ab@@ b@@ as stressed that the palestinian - israeli peace process , which was formed under the leadership of hamas , will not be recognized by israel , and this hard - line signal has also aggrav@@ ated international concern .
the united states and israel have explicitly expressed that they will not accept a hamas government that has real power , and threatened to suspend economic aid to palestine and to hand over taxes to palestine .
however , this does not prevent hamas from making a flexible strategic adjustment , and the election of an independent person is a t@@ ough@@ er policy .
it is reported that in order to obtain the greatest international approval , the united states has recently decided to shift the election of an independent person at home and abroad to the chairman of the board of directors of the islamic university , j@@ ah@@ r@@ al@@ i , who is also a member of the council of the islamic university , to the position of the new prime minister .
this move has not been responded by the parties concerned .
palestinian analy@@ st hus@@ se@@ in said that no matter whether the prime minister 's position is spent , the most crucial thing is that the candidate for the prime minister should as much as possible less@@ en the hard@@ line color of hamas , and only by so doing can it guarantee the success of forming the cabinet .
power is distributed to the public .
in the internal aspect , the biggest challenge facing hamas 's cabinet is its lack of sufficient ruling experience .
the " y@@ a@@ '@@ i bao " of palestine analyzed that hamas , through drawing together people 's attention through social welfare projects , has yet to gain experience in governing and has close ties with the palestinian national liberation movement ( fat@@ f ) , which has the experience of being in power .
after the election , hamas proposed establishing a political consultative partnership with fat@@ ah , and jointly forming a national coalition government . however , fat@@ ah has not given a positive response to this day .
fat@@ ah is currently in the cabinet with different opinions . one faction advocates that it should take part in the new government , so as to do something , while the other faction ref@@ uses to accept hamas 's invitation and is willing to make a positive move in the legislative council .
the informed source pointed out that under the instig@@ ation of ab@@ b@@ as , fat@@ ah was gradually incl@@ ined to join the new government .
even so , hamas and fat@@ ah will also have a consensus on the distribution of their cabinet posts .
in addition , another way is to establish a framework of the legislative council , which is separated from the party 's subordinate cabinet .
it is reported that hamas has also designed a 1@@ 00@@ th expert - type government , but the specific list is not known .
in view of the fact that the united states and israel have taken a different attitude , the technological expert - type government has also become a cabinet for reducing external pressure .
according to the palestinian " basic law , " the new legislative council will hold its first meeting on 16 june after the new legislative council takes office .
armed forces should not be allowed to go
the weapons in hamas are the most important weapons facing the new government .
the us and israel have been very hard - line and have resolutely demanded that hamas abandon violence and rej@@ ect their political participation with gun .
hamas leader ma@@ h@@ mu@@ d stressed on 9 july that armed resistance is a strategic choice of the organization .
the armed issue actually includes the leg@@ ality of weapons and the ownership of armed forces .
hamas , through democratic and free methods , has been elected the first largest party in the legislative yuan , and has been able to make its subordinate armed forces , while the z@@ am@@ bian army is also leg@@ alized , that is , to unify it in the government 's security organs .
hamas has proposed that all factions be unified as palestinian national authority
palestine now has more than 6@@ 0,000 security personnel , and the great majority of them come from the fat@@ ah camp .
moreover , fat@@ ah also has some organizational relationships that are lo@@ ose and dis@@ pers@@ ed , such as the ar@@ iz@@ on@@ a marty@@ rs brigade , the z@@ am@@ bian cl@@ an eag@@ le , etc.
hamas , who is responsible for forming the cabinet , must hold discussions with ab@@ b@@ as on how to manage the armed forces that operate in their own way and reason@@ ably distribu@@ te the right to safe management .
according to local media reports , ab@@ b@@ as inten@@ ds to be in charge of security and intelligence units , police , civil defense , and other organizations , and the new government is under the administration of the interior ministry .
however , the parties are still holding consultations on this sensitive issue , and so far there has been no final document .

china 's electric power production safety still faces st@@ ern challenges
beijing , february 13 ( xinhua ) china 's electric power industry is expected to grow by a big margin in 2005 , said a responsible official of the state power supervision and management commission ( s@@ dr@@ c ) here today .

however , he pointed out that with the changes in the power supply and demand situation and the large amount of newly built power generating units have been put into operation , the production of electric power will face new challenges .
these challenges include : regional hy@@ per@@ activity for seas@@ onal demand will continue to exist , and the electricity supply and demand situation in some areas will remain rather tight , and the prices of electricity will remain stable , resulting in a decline in electricity supply .
shi yu@@ bo said : with the in - depth reform of the power system , many deep - se@@ ated contradictions will be continually exposed , and how to maintain the stability of the ranks of workers and staff members and ensure normal production order will become a new issue facing them .
in view of the 2006 power production safety work , shi yu@@ bo said that it is necessary to further consolidate the basic work of electric power production safety management , speed up the establishment and improvement of the emergency management mechanism for electric power safety , improve the ability to deal with emer@@ gen@@ cies , strengthen the coordination and cooperation of power gr@@ id , jointly safeguard the safety of the power system , and continue to do a good job in supervising and managing the construction of the dam and the construction of information technology , so
it is learned that in connection with the new situation in power safety management , the power regulatory commission will make a comprehensive review of the " interim regulations on investigation of electric power production accidents " that have been promulgated this year . at the same time , the report on the safety of the dam and the second system protection of the hydr@@ op@@ ower station will be successively issued to the meeting this year .
in 2005 , the total electricity consumption in china reached 24@@ 6.@@ 8@@ 9 billion k@@ w , up 2@@ 13.@@ 4 percent over the same period last year .
in the face of the situation of power supply and demand being still tight , the contradiction of coal , electricity , oil , and transportation was pr@@ on@@ ounced , and other unfavorable conditions , all power enterprises took effective measures to strengthen equipment management . last year , there was no extra@@ ordin@@ arily serious equipment accident in electric power production across the country .
the power gr@@ id accidents occurred 74 times , a decrease of 1@@ 27 times over the same period last year , and 4@@ 27 incidents of equipment accidents , a decrease of 13@@ 2 times over the same period last year .

since 2006 , four large chinese military personnel have been killed in south africa one after another , and the world of chinese origin and people have expressed their extensive concern about this .
the chinese foreign ministry has made representations with south africa over this and reminded chinese citizens in south africa to further enhance their awareness of security and prevention , strengthen unity and friendship between them , and cooperate with the police in cracking down on criminal activities .
the family members of the victims expressed the most sincere sympathy and condol@@ ences .
the minister said that the country 's economic development is a great cause of the country 's economic development .
according to the chinese embassy in south africa , the south african police have successfully cracked the case of chinese women 's chen jian@@ qing , a chinese woman in fujian , on 5 february , and a suspect has been arrested in south africa .
the police are now hun@@ ting for another suspect .
according to the south african embassy in china , the suspect of shooting a hong kong business@@ man in january this year has been arrested by the south african police , and the victim 's property has been recovered .
on the incident of chinese citizens being killed , li peng said that the chinese government has always attached great importance to these incidents .
the south african embassy tourism commissioner n@@ gu@@ yen b@@ hu@@ i said the embassy was operating in the first 15 days of this year for more than 2,000 chinese citizens to south africa .
according to official statistics , south africa has invested $ 1 billion in china in africa in 2005 , and the country has become the largest trading partner of africa .
the bilateral trade volume reached $ 7@@ 2.@@ 7 billion , up 2@@ 3.@@ 7 percent from the same period last year .
however , tourism industry figures believe that the successive incidents of chinese citizens killed in 2004 have seriously affected the chinese tourism industry .
according to statistics from the south african tourism bureau , the number of chinese tourists to south africa in the first half of 2005 was 20@@ 3@@ 31 , a decrease of 14.@@ 9 percent over the same period last year .
the chinese people living in south africa now have about 200,000 people , and the number of towns and villages in south africa is around 200,000 .
analysts here believe that the widening gap between the rich and the poor in south africa , the high unemployment rate , and the rampant gun flow in south africa are not threatening the death penalty , and the crime rate is high .
because many chinese do not understand english , there are cash in their bodies and their families , and they are more pr@@ one to become targets of criminal activities in making financial attacks .

if the gas wel@@ ls do not have a bu@@ m@@ per , they will have to order them to immediately stop production according to law .

z@@ o@@ e strengthened basic management of coal mine safety
it is necessary to immediately correct the practices of stopping the small number of large state - owned mines from sk@@ ating , and guiding and managing small mines that are chao@@ tic in management , and establish a standardized safety management system .

a person who died more than 10 a year ago must have a drop of 5@@ 5.@@ 2 percent , of which the mine has dropped by 7@@ -@@ 7 percent .
these control indic@@ ators have been assigned to provincial people 's governments , and various localities are implementing the policy of " three represents " at the grassroots level and enterprises at every level .

xinhua news agency reporter gao ying
although italy has repeatedly issued a statement , the du@@ tch prime minister , who was found to have used stimul@@ ant inj@@ ury during the du@@ tch winter games , may face the rare j@@ ail j@@ ail disaster , but judging from various circumstances , this situation is not very likely to happen in the current winter olympics .

the next day , the international olympic committee announced that the dispatch of le@@ on@@ id has been out of the winter olympics . at this winter olympic games , she won two women 's 15 km personal med@@ als in this winter olympics .
the international winter mon@@ uments alliance was formed on the same day to express its commitment to the two - year ban on the allocation of the women 's vol@@ le@@ y@@ ball tour@@ na@@ ment .
the i@@ oc has always stipulated that athletes are being investigated for using the means of stimul@@ ant at the olympic games and will be eliminated and depriv@@ ed of their quali@@ fication for the competition , but they are not subject to legal sanctions .
however , according to italian law , athletes carrying and using stimul@@ ants are criminal acts . judicial organs are responsible for the direct arrest and investigation of the use of stimul@@ ant athletes .
in december last year , the international olympic committee and the italian government w@@ aged a year - long struggle to sal@@ v@@ age the price of hard barg@@ ain . both sides agreed to hold a meeting in accordance with italian law to deal with the use of stimul@@ ant by athletes during the current winter olympics .

it is reported that the italian government supervis@@ es the du@@ tch winter olympics officials , p@@ es@@ and@@ re@@ w , who has sent a str@@ ing of re@@ d@@ undant stimul@@ ants to the du@@ tch procuratorial organ .
however , the i@@ oc and pe@@ ter p@@ es@@ cad@@ or@@ et have not yet been confirmed .

he was a member of the world anti - d@@ oping agency for many years , and chinese sports official shi k@@ ang@@ cheng maintained that once a le@@ af is sent back to china , this incident will eventually be un@@ resolved .
shi said that the i@@ oc and the italian government have made important contributions to the olympic games in the past .
according to the previous italy 's experience in using stimul@@ ant to the athletes of the country , the number of people who were banned from the cult is only the two years of imprisonment and a period of re@@ moving the pen@@ alties .
therefore , italian senior correspon@@ dent pi@@ er@@ re said that the dispatch of le@@ on@@ id into the prison is likely to be a mic@@ r@@ op@@ hy@@ th@@ m , and most of them are fine .
pi@@ er@@ re also said that although the italian court could conduct a trial without a seat , the italian police could not go abroad to send the li@@ on@@ a back and take the sentence .
if the op@@ a re@@ bel@@ s refused to accept the verdic@@ t , the italian side would not have any way to take her .
