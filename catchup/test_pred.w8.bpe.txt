experts believe that the insurance industry will not diver@@ t domestic stock market funds in the short term
chin@@ ane@@ ws , july 30
according to a report by china securities news , the " provisional procedures on management of investment overseas of insurance funds " were promulgated a few days ago . insurance funds have a broader space for using the capital market .
liu le@@ fei , chief investment officer of the china chi@@ u company , said that the appreciation of the renminbi and the good direction of the domestic capital market will not be made by insurance institutions through large - scale purchase of foreign capital in the short term . this also means that insurance insurance will not diver@@ t domestic stock market funds from the short term .
the report said that many insurance agencies hold the same views .
experts say that because there is no market for renminbi at present , insurance institutions do not have sufficient risk ev@@ asion means , and therefore the time for large - scale foreign exchange purchase is not ri@@ pe .
liu le@@ fei said : in the long run , in the area of asset allocation , foreign investment should occupy a certain proportion in the overall distribution of insurance companies .
however , because the renminbi is under greater pressure of appreciation , china will mainly rely on its own foreign exchange funds to make overseas investment .
for foreign exchange purchases , the state should be handled with cau@@ tion under the current circumstances .

chen shui - bian secre@@ tly criticized the judicial involvement in the election for the taiwan " legislative yuan " to deny and explain it .
chin@@ ane@@ w@@ s@@ .@@ com july -- chen shui - bian questi@@ oned the island 's judicial personnel 's attempt to get involved in the election of a leader in the taiwan region .
taiwan 's yu@@ shi@@ ba college administrative college said on the same day that the current performance of judges in taiwan is different from what chen shui - bian said , and also requires chen shui - bian to explain his view .
according to a report by taiwan 's " su@@ shi " , chen shui - bian questi@@ oned whether the judge , the prosecu@@ tor , or the investigation , had been involved due to political factors or election considerations , and even attempted to influence the election activities of the candidates of various parties , saying that he hoped such phenomena would not exist in taiwan , but they may be very difficult .
in response to chen shui - bian 's question , wu shi@@ sheng , president of the executive yuan , did not respond to him , while lu shi@@ qi , secretary general of the shi@@ kai group , was a high representative of the judicial college .
gao jin@@ zhi said : the basic laws of taiwan and the code of judges both clearly and definitely declared that judges should not go beyond the party 's political party activities or be helpful to the election , and judges are very cautious in observing relevant restrictions . they believe that judges are cautious in handling matters of the judicial system .
gao jin@@ zhi pointed out : kaohsiung higher and upper levels are different . chang sheng@@ xi , a judge at the kaohsiung executive college , was del@@ igh@@ ted to attend the course of the k@@ ad@@ ag@@ ar@@ a school because the course concerned has a political party col@@ or and a judge - forming committee resolution .
zhang sheng@@ xi was del@@ igh@@ ted to take part in the dpp 's executive election because he was taking part in the election .
gao jin@@ zhi believes that if the trial of individual cases is a matter , the level of examination cannot be done in a single way according to the results of the verdic@@ t , and that judges have political intentions .
germany to lower restrictions on professional personnel
the reporter learned from the pla 's ber@@ lin , 1 july ( reporter wang huai@@ cheng )
german minister of education and scientific research sh@@ av@@ an recently said that germany should lower its " proced@@ ural law " to limit the conditions for introducing foreign speci@@ alties and increase its support for foreign talents by increasing the introduction of foreign talents .
according to the o@@ ec@@ d report , germany has been a big number of labor workers aged 15 to 64 .
if there is no sufficient immigration , there will be a down@@ ward trend in germany 's labor force at 20@@ -@@ 30 .
however , the german federation of employers and german engine@@ ers association reported that the german labor market is not a problem with engine@@ ers ' technical skills .
according to statistics from the federal labor bureau , the german labor market engine@@ er supply volume in may was approximately 17@@ 0,000 , accounting for about one - third of the total supply of some 17@@ 0,000 people . technical technicians supply tun@@ n@@ els is approximately 9@@ 600 .
germany has been playing an important role in protecting its own people 's employment and in introducing foreign talents .
germany 's " du@@ tu@@ un " stipulates that non - eu professional talents are not below 8@@ 5,000 eur@@ os in germany , otherwise they cannot be obtained from work and residence in germany .
sha@@ ow@@ ei suggested reducing this limit to level of action .
do not have super@@ sti@@ tion and law .
the " law of lawyers " that was submitted to the npc standing committee for examination and discussion recently stipulates that those who have engaged in legal research , such as teaching , and they have a high level of both high level and secondary professional level , applying for the lawyers ' profession , will be subject to the examination and approval by the judicial administrative department of the state council and be allowed to be sent to the lawyers ' profession .
( june 28 ) china " roll@@ s "
law has a well - developed circle and a well - ver@@ sed circle . the former mainly includes legal teaching and research work , and other regular behavior . the latter is more important in the li@@ tig@@ ation law . the latter is a large number of concrete behaviors such as legal consultation , legal service , and so on .
for a long time , the theoretical circle and the affairs of both the legal profession and the actual situation have exist@@ ed , and the theoretical circle is a subject of understanding , and theoretical circles believe that the lack of necessary preparations for the actual business circles is only a mechanical and law - based person , a buddhist , and a capitalist class .
the differences in the division of labor are to be done by the law , not by relying on the support of one side .
however , some people from both circles and circles in the " law of lawyers " have obj@@ ectively recognized the historical experience of law circles , which is higher than those from legal circles .
in fact , some people who are engaged in the study of international laws and laws and other purely institutional studies and teaching have once again profoundly studied their theories and are closely related to legal practice .
this is a case of a sti@@ r@@ ring lawyers system , without doubt , a dis@@ orderly system of qualifications that aff@@ ects extremely un@@ satisfactory results .
they are not only blin@@ dly influ@@ enced by theories , but also by specialists and experts , who are often influ@@ encing or even ve@@ to@@ ing the court verdic@@ t , and this is also a direct expression of such super@@ sti@@ tion .

the application for ships may be made by dalian , shanghai municipality , for the registration procedures for ship registration .
britain low@@ ers level of terrorist attacks
the air force of the pla , london , july 5 ( reporter guo lin )
the british government has made a series of terrorist attacks from the highest level to the level of high level , which indicates that the british terrorist attacks will not happen soon , but the attacks are extremely likely to be done in the market .
the british police have now transferred the scope of the investigation to india and australia .
the eight suspects arrested were all in the medical system , and the government would be responsible for the work of the migr@@ ants who have entered the medical system .
it is learned that recently , some people working in the british public health system have been working overseas .
the prime minister also called for an investigation into the background of high - tech migr@@ ation , and employers or relevant organizations will be asked to provide background information .
do n't let the businessmen get imp@@ ati@@ ent
tourism is a scene of a stream@@ ing and un@@ comfor@@ table life , and it is the best way to enjoy the fruits of natural civilization and social civilization .
however , many people were en@@ counter such an an@@ no@@ yed when they were visiting the country . they were once engaged in business deal@@ ers and intermedi@@ ary business .
the car , train , and train will always be affected by small traders and some un@@ certified intermedi@@ ary .
not a fl@@ ower - ro@@ ast@@ ed pi@@ e , it is selling newspapers and peri@@ o@@ dic@@ als , and many t@@ estim@@ on@@ ies , intermedi@@ ary restaurants , even tu@@ mul@@ tu@@ ous tu@@ ition , and even li@@ qui@@ d - style .
if you do n't accept it , he can ch@@ ase you several hundred meters , and if you are n't successful , you will be a good thing .
many of them have similar feelings .
in the abs@@ ence of entrance , some people came from a tour and a little , a little , a little , a little , a little , a thing .
after entering the door , this situation became even more serious . then y@@ a@@ xing was also sti@@ r@@ red up and too few ta@@ st@@ es .
it was reported by the media that many foreign tourists visiting xian had an an@@ on@@ y@@ m@@ ity with xian , but they were very exc@@ ited about allowing more small business haw@@ kers to sell them everywhere .
these include stations , tun@@ n@@ els , and tun@@ n@@ els , which are originally out@@ going and inter@@ sections , which should be characterized by orderly civilization , peaceful and harmonious , and a broad and heart - sh@@ ining environment .
the freedom of the traders has been sw@@ oll@@ en with the confu@@ sion of the business deal@@ ers . obj@@ ectively , they have under@@ min@@ ed the public order of these things , forming a situation of pollution and environmental pollution . meanwhile , they have provided conditions and opportunities for the operation of the business community .
what is important is that these are wind@@ ows for the building of spiritual civilization in the loc@@ ality , and the se@@ g@@ ment is not only a good image , but also a negative impact on the development of the local economy .
just imag@@ ine , if you want to be a big and strong tourist industry , you will use this chao@@ tic and ru@@ b@@ ish tourism environment to welcome the guests coming from south to north . who will come and dare come ?
how can you achieve economic results in your tourism ?
with the arrival of the peak tourist season , it will create a civilized tourism environment for tourists from the north of the southern part of the country . it should be said that the pressing task is to do so .
do n't have the market , the operation behavior of pe@@ d@@ d@@ lers should be regul@@ ated , and the operation of unlicensed businesses should be resolutely abol@@ ished , and illegal activities should be resolutely cracked down on .
only a civilized and orderly environment can we make both pleas@@ ant and happy , and return to the motherland with full vigor .
in one word , do n't let business deal@@ ers get imp@@ ati@@ ent .
they have volun@@ t@@ arily re@@ tained themselves and re@@ ap@@ ed .
the construction of the beijing dong@@ cheng district has been done with the issuance of electric ru@@ ins as a minimum guarantee for 12 households who volun@@ t@@ arily re@@ tained themselves .
( xin@@ jing bao )
the auth@@ or is happy about the improvement of living standards in these families , but he has taken the initiative to re@@ treat and re@@ treat , and has been re@@ war@@ ding the practice of being a class mer@@ it , but he is feeling complex .
the vice director of the jian@@ qi neighbor@@ hood office said : due to problems such as fraud and low insurance , encouraging people to volun@@ t@@ arily re@@ treat and ensuring insurance is an example set by lu du@@ an , a city that has set for other low - income households .
if this is an example , it will encourage other low - income people to extr@@ icate themselves from their difficulties through their own efforts , and if they want to use this experience to call on those who have long been dece@@ ived by che@@ ating for low - income people , they will not be exemp@@ ted from being inf@@ at@@ u@@ ated .
while differ@@ enti@@ ating and clean@@ ing up low - level households , what we rely more on is the law .
relevant departments should strengthen the management of minimum - income households when enjoying minimum - guaranteed income : if they report promptly the changes in family and income , report the employment situation , and accept re@@ examination on a regular basis , the departments concerned should strengthen their supervision and inspection .
after all , it is only a long - term plan to move out of business according to law .
the neighbor@@ hoo@@ ds re@@ war@@ ded with the family re@@ im@@ bur@@ sed with a str@@ um .
as a first - level government organization , the neighbor@@ hood is covered by financial appropri@@ ations .
and the money of a tax@@ pay@@ er should not be fl@@ ower .
on the one hand , the withdrawal from low - income families has proven that they have developed certain ability to make themselves mature , and on the other hand , the number of people applying for minimum living expenses is not still present .
the government 's financial appropri@@ ations , which are called the lif@@ es@@ aving money , should be delivered in the mid@@ st of snow rather than in the br@@ igh@@ tness of the br@@ igh@@ tness .
liu , who is willing to serve as a service provid@@ er ,
on 10 july , the first city in the country that has been directly elected , du@@ an county , mu@@ lan town , xin@@ du district , was interviewed by shi@@ jie for the fourth time after taking office , with a rate of 9@@ 7.@@ 7 percent .
during the dialogue with liu di@@ yi , liu gang@@ yi defined himself as a class service provid@@ er .
( xin@@ jing bao yesterday )
liu sh@@ un@@ yi 's class service may be much better than some appointed cadres in the system .
the most important thing in the system of public - run elections is that the former is mainly decided by ordinary party members and masses , and the latter is mainly appointed by the higher - level organization , and the direction of the source of power has determined that the former must put the responsibility for the people in the first place .
the source of power and responsibility are the key to determining how the person elected will carry out its work .
some people questi@@ oned such a democratic revolution as a r@@ ock show .
my view is that there are such a democratic and institutional form , which is better than .
taking into account the history and current situation of the building of democracy at the grassroots level in china , i believe that the election of public servants directly is a major breakthrough , and democracy is a major component part of this industry , which should not be under@@ estimated in promoting the building of democracy at the grassroots level .

the governor of the ruling party , she@@ i@@ k@@ h k@@ a@@ wa , came from the opposition party people 's party .
the congress party has been in the forefront of the presidential election , and the media and the people have been involved in the election , and the possibility of being a pas@@ sive minority is quite large .
the 72 - year - old p@@ aw@@ n is the governor of the state of the state of r@@ as@@ al@@ in@@ i .
she was a law@@ yer , a well - experienced legisl@@ ator , and a senior legisl@@ ator who had been a governor of the ra@@ j@@ as@@ than state .
she is also devoted to social welfare , and is a part of many cultural and social welfare organizations ' honor@@ ary chairmen .
analysts pointed out that the reason that pal@@ yin became a candidate was because she unswervingly worked on the sid@@ eline of the president of the indian congress party , s@@ onia g@@ and@@ hi .
in india , the k@@ and@@ ah@@ ar family has been controlling the ruling national congress party for a long time .
after her err@@ ors were emb@@ arr@@ ass@@ ed by a large number of female voters , the female voters believed that the p@@ aw@@ n will be a female tu@@ an@@ huan who dis@@ crimin@@ ate against women with a serious sense of being a serious problem in indian affairs and will raise the status of women .

three functions of modern military uni@@ form
first , the function of identification .
different countries ' armed forces are different from different arms of services and important symb@@ ols of the people .
in the world 's military with more than 100 countries , although the use of military uni@@ forms is basically the same , no country has the military uni@@ form of the two countries .
second , it symbol@@ izes function .
to a certain extent , military uni@@ forms are the most important reflection of a nation 's spiritual outlook and also the most important factor in the military 's ability to fight a war .
after hearing the r@@ it@@ u@@ als and moving the uni@@ form , the most capable of showing the experience of prof@@ ic@@ i@@ ency in military affairs , the most important thing in this respect is the t@@ ent@@ ative con@@ sec@@ r@@ ation of the be@@ au@@ ty .
third , the functions of protection .
with the rapid development of new and high - tech weapons and equipment , the comprehensive protective functions of new - style uni@@ forms have greatly improved the defense of military uni@@ forms and anti - reconnaissance capability with the capability of defense against chemical warfare , such as radi@@ ation radi@@ ation radi@@ ation , trans@@ fer@@ ring temperature , hu@@ m@@ ble tun@@ n@@ eling , and so on , and have become the most important issue in the development of military uni@@ form .

a few years ago , with the personnel of the company , some of the houses in the house of the group were un@@ occupied in violation of regulations , and the officers and men had a rather big opinion on this .
the group also cle@@ ared several houses and caused un@@ clear obstruc@@ tions . as a result , this problem became an old problem and difficult one .
if you have to do something like a l@@ uc@@ ky one , you will have no problems that cannot be resolved .
after the new party committee leadership group reached a consensus , principal leaders personally took action to carry out thorough clean@@ ing of all problems in housing .
they are moving and moving , and they hope that the personnel concerned will understand the situation of the army building , the tu@@ an@@ tu@@ an , and the economic housing , and the relevant policies and regulations of the housing office , and show the party committee 's firm determination and principled stand .

the seven - member military uni@@ form desig@@ ner is a guest of the china internet .
on 13 july , the reporter liu xin@@ xin from yang bao@@ jin reporting from beijing : the whole army will successively change the " 7 th uni@@ form " from 1 august .
tonight , the chinese military network invited shi@@ jie and shi@@ jie to be specially assigned to the military logistics department . chen jun , deputy director of the armament bureau ; and yu yi@@ fu , senior engine@@ er of the military equipment research institute , were invited to serve as a guest of the china military network . this was closely related to the background and development process of ne@@ tiz@@ ens ' new uni@@ form and research and development in the army and outside the army . this has ev@@ o@@ ked an e@@ ch@@ o in
the two guests are : the research and development of 07 style military uni@@ form .
speaking of the changes in the new uni@@ form , they said that the 07 - style military uni@@ form was a class@@ ic du@@ el , especially 97 - type military suit .
the most characteristic of the 07 - style military uni@@ form is the re@@ shu@@ f@@ f@@ le requirement of making itself a regular one and making our military uni@@ form reach the level of coordination among the three armed services for the first time , reaching the standard set by the series of supporting systems , and bringing about a historic leap in the level of our army 's uni@@ form building .
the two guests also exchanged views on the new style of str@@ aw , the roll@@ s of the army , the shi@@ jie issue , and other issues .
this is a large - scale joint operation between the chinese military network and the new wave network of china .
the shu@@ ang@@ xi city people 's armed forces department has upgraded its personnel and plat@@ forms for cadres .
zhu ji@@ ay@@ in , a member of the central military commission and a member of the central military commission , recently visited jing@@ jiang city , jiangsu province , and joined the ranks of cadres with special skills .
this is a major move taken by the military department to take into consideration the actual situation of their posts to exert efforts to raise the overall quality of the cadres .
at the beginning of this year , the party committee of the people 's armed forces department discovered during the investigation and study at the grassroots level that some cadres with special skills had worked for a long time and were not promoted at the same time .
therefore , they have adopted a centralized training method of relying on training for local party schools in accordance with the training program of local party schools , and have conducted regular training for special - purpose cadres , and have made efforts to solve such problems as a narrow knowledge level and a uni@@ form professional quality among military cadres .
and in connection with the central work , boldly making preparations for the transfer of cadres to civilian work , and enhancing their ability to work posts .
at the same time , they have actively coordinated local organization departments and jointly formulated the " plan for competitive appointment of specialized - armed cadres " , clearly speci@@ fying that the armed forces minister must be a corps of provincial party committee members and no longer be involved in other posts ;
established a mechanism for readjusting and exchanging cadres with special forces , and made arrangements for some special military skills cadres who are not on a large scale and who are not suitable for the work of arming the armed forces at the grassroots level in a timely manner .
not long ago , chen yi@@ song , director of the armed forces department of the xin@@ hu@@ o company , led the militi@@ a technical detachment to innovate and develop under@@ water ship technology , thus filled with domestic cr@@ aw@@ ling , and was upgraded to the company 's director .
good will first still require good results
the result of the competition alone is 2 : 2 : 2 , which is reasonable , and also acceptable to both . the key is the process of the competition , and it is regre@@ tt@@ able .
if iran leads by 2 - 0 , then the tun@@ e will be equ@@ alized , then the feeling of china being different . it will be very strong .
the good will cannot be good at the end , and it can be said that it is an old problem .
i often do n't think that in a situation of un@@ due mobility , the general view of people is that china has not been perfect in its psychological quality .
this is indeed a result of not being able to move well and come out .
however , judging from today 's str@@ aw competition , it seems that it is not the case .
sun ji@@ hai , sun ji@@ xiang , sh@@ ao ji@@ xian and zheng yi@@ zhi , k@@ ic@@ ked off the ball in europe , and li wei - feng and others were also old gener@@ als of ji@@ u@@ sha . they saw many things and saw them in broad terms . according to reas@@ oning , there would not be any problems with their psychological quality .
this aw@@ k@@ ward move was forced by the iranian team , and the reason is probably because it will soon be deployed in battle groups .
the iranian team is in a backward situation and the two are immediately led by the scene .
it was also ren@@ amed in the semi - game .
we should overcome the problems of being good at the beginning and not being good at the end , and we must accurately find the root of the problem .
as long as the problems are accurately identified and the methods of correc@@ ting the existing problems are not difficult to find .
they are afraid that they will be caught in a hur@@ ry .
if this goes on , it will be a big game , and there will be more old problems , and no talk about what everybody hopes for .

the specific method of the cooperation zone is to break the dem@@ arc@@ ation line of the unit 's establishment and to design@@ ate a brigade level unit in a relatively centralized film area to carry out unified planning for education on the theme . units of different relationships are close to the class@@ room or have learned from a relatively long distance learning system for discussion .
adopting the method of combining the education with the practice of appointment through competition , we should make unified arrangements for the education forces , and the education hard@@ ware of the whole region should be uni@@ form , and the data used by all units should be exchanged and the education experience sharing and exchange experience should be shared among education experience gained through education .
each cooperation zone has established a school for both education and academic ac@@ tors and educational information collection .
on this basis , all cooperative areas have also established a large - scale education project called ta@@ il@@ or@@ un , a large education project , and an emergency - response system for reporting and evalu@@ ating the situation .
