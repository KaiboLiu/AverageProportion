mus@@ in@@ o reiterated that he hoped that one day he could take up the teaching of the portu@@ gu@@ ese team , and he really wanted to go on his religion , and i believe that there was always a day that the portu@@ gu@@ ese football association very much hoped to h@@ ire me as the head of the delegation , and he knows that he has been engaged in the care@@ ers .
however , 44 - year - old mus@@ ic@@ ian does not inten@@ d to contribute his whole life to soccer . he said he would reti@@ re before the age of 60 , and he did not want to be like b@@ ob@@ by , fr@@ ie@@ x@@ on , and lin@@ k@@ ans@@ en , who is about to be the old age .
ju i have already promised my wife , i will not be as good as rob@@ er@@ son and f@@ og@@ son , who has been teaching until 70 years old , and the my@@ th@@ um@@ es .
mus@@ ne@@ i , the age of 60 , i think about completely the lu@@ str@@ e .
i have too many things that i cannot do now , and i am aw@@ a@@ iting to do something .
i do not want to become a soccer advis@@ or or or technical director , such as bar@@ d@@ no or sar@@ ji .
i do n't want to play such a role .

chin@@ ane@@ w@@ s@@ .@@ com , july 30 .
according to a report by china securities news , the " interim measures on managing the overseas investment of insurance funds " were promulgated a few days ago , and insurance funds have a broader space for the use of capital markets .
liu le@@ fei , chief investment officer of china 's x@@ ir@@ u company , believes that the rmb 's appreciation and the chinese capital market will move up well , and insurance institutions will not invest in foreign currencies through the purchase of the renminbi in the short term , this also impl@@ ies that insurance investment will not diver@@ t the domestic stock market from the mainland .
the report said that many insurance companies hold the same views .
experts said that since there is no renminbi exchange market , insurance institutions are not yet able to avoid risks , so the time for large - scale foreign exchange purchase is not yet ri@@ pe .
liu le@@ fei said : looking at the long term , in terms of asset allocation , foreign investment should take a certain proportion of the overall allocation of insurance companies .
however , because the renminbi is under greater pressure of appreciation at present , china will mainly use its own foreign exchange funds to make overseas investment .
foreign exchange bu@@ yers who invest overseas in foreign exchange should be treated with cau@@ tion .

chin@@ ane@@ w@@ s@@ .@@ com , chen shui - bian on 30 july questi@@ oned whether judicial personnel on the island were attempting to interven@@ e in the election of leaders in the taiwan region .

according to taiwan 's " reports , " judge chen shui - bian has been qu@@ er@@ ied about the resignation of judges or investig@@ ators due to political factors or election considerations , and he has interven@@ ed in an attempt to influence the election activities of candidates of various parties , saying that he hopes such a phenomenon will not exist in taiwan , but it is very difficult .
in view of chen shui - bian 's qu@@ eries , the president of the taiwan affairs office , yue yue l@@ eng , did not respond to him , and the secretary general fan ku@@ ang - q@@ un , while the legisl@@ ature represented the higher level by him , was elected by the judicial college .
gao kin@@ zhi said : taiwan 's law and the code of judges both clearly pro@@ claim that judges should be allowed to take part in activities of political parties beyond the party 's parties or in any party 's activities , and judges have been very cautious in observing relevant restr@@ aints , believ@@ ing that judges have done their work well .
gao pointed out : kaohsiung senior judge chang sheng@@ ju pointed out that the higher academy was involved in the tri@@ um@@ ph@@ ant school curriculum a few years ago , that is , because the relevant curriculum has political col@@ ors and is a self - discipline committee that consists of judges .
zhang sheng@@ xi once wanted to take part in the dpp 's campaig@@ ning because of disputes over his work .
gao jin@@ zhi maintained that if a case is tried in a particular case , if it is not done at the examination level , it will not be possible to judge the judge by his political intention .
germany to lower the entry thre@@ sh@@ old for professional talent
the reporters learned from the pla general staff headquarters that the pla general staff have been conducting a military exercise in the northern region .
german minister of education and scientific research sh@@ av@@ an recently said that germany should lower its " scri@@ p@@ ture " to re@@ strict the admission of foreign professionals and increase its input of foreign talents to solve the problems facing germany by bringing in more foreign talents .
germany 's move to germany at the age of 15 - 64 has been completed annually , according to the o@@ ec@@ d report .
if there is no adequate immigration , then germany 's labor force will be reduced by 6 percent compared with the present .
however , the german employers ' federation and the german engine@@ ers association reported that in germany 's current labor market , engine@@ ers ' professional technical talent is relatively large .
according to statistics from the german federal labor bureau , in may this year , the supply of engine@@ ers in the german labor market was about 17@@ 0,000 , and the technicians had supply about 9@@ ,@@ 600 people .
germany has adopted a series of policies to protect its own employment and set a relatively high thre@@ sh@@ old for introducing foreign talent .
germany 's " scri@@ pt " stipulates that non - eu professionals are not at 8@@ 5@@ 5,000 eur@@ os in germany , otherwise they cannot be granted a job and residence permit in germany .
the s@@ and man@@ n proposed low@@ ering this quota to the level of euro .
do not super@@ sti@@ tion and theory ;
the " law of lawyers " which was recently submitted to the npc standing committee for examination and discussion , stipulates that those who have engaged in legal studies and other specialized work , and who have both higher level or similar professional standards , apply for lawyers ' practice , which is approved by the judicial administrative department of the state council , may be permitted to practice their business .
prc academic on 28 june ,
legal experience , and academic studies and practices ,
over a long time , the theories and the practices of the l@@ uan circle exist in the phenomenon of the l@@ y@@ r@@ ics , light phenomenon , theoretical circles believe that the lack of necessary regarding the undertaking of the real field is only a mechanical doctr@@ ine , and the emergence of a my@@ ster@@ ious circle in the field of theory .
with regard to such a division of labor , what the law can do is to maintain its reputation , not to support any one .
however , the rum@@ or of the " law of lawyers " has obj@@ ectively recognized the theory of the law and has higher the legal status than the legal profession .
in fact , some purely engaged in study of laws and international practices , and some experts and scholars engaged in theoretical studies and teaching , have been deeply rooted in the practice of law , and have been involved in the practice of laws .
this way , the lawyers ' system , without doubt , has been the l@@ augh@@ ing stock of the legal profession 's qualifications , and the influence is extremely un@@ satisfactory .
regarding theories and super@@ sti@@ tions , such as the study of experts and appraisal meetings , and even the ve@@ to of court judg@@ ments , are also a super@@ sti@@ tion .

britain low@@ ers level of terror attack
the reporters learned from the pla daily , london , july 5 th , by reporter lin guo
the british government has made a move to down@@ grade the highest level of terrorist attacks to the serious level of the attacks , which indicates that the terrorist attacks in britain will not happen soon , but the attacks are extremely likely to be involved .
the investigation is being conducted in the united kingdom and is being conducted in india and australia .
the police have been investigating the case because the eight arrested suspects of terrorist attacks are working in the medical system .
it is learned that nearly the workers working in the british public medical system are all receiving medical treatment abroad .
the prime minister also called for an investigation into the background of high - tech migr@@ ation , and employers or relevant organizations will be required to provide background information .
do n't let the business deal@@ ers feel ti@@ red .
tourism , char@@ ts , and the qing dynasty , themselves ,
but when you travel in china , many people have met with such a worry , and when the business deal@@ ers and business intermedi@@ aries are surr@@ ounded and ch@@ ased .
the car , train , train , and train always meet the small traders and some unlicensed intermedi@@ ary businesses .
it is not selling a sp@@ ade , selling magazine , selling newspapers and peri@@ o@@ dic@@ als , and then introducing food and drink , or even issuing false certificates .
if you do n't accept it , he can ch@@ ase you for several hundred meters , and if it is very un@@ successful , it will become a ben@@ evol@@ ent trend .
many of these events , including wind and others , have the same feelings .
if you have not entered the gate , you will experience tourism and little , er ,
after i entered the house , this situation will become even more , and y@@ ax@@ ing , which is better , is also sup@@ pressed and fe@@ e@@ ble .
some media reported that many foreign tourists in xian were shocked by the mon@@ uments in xian . however , they were very impres@@ sed by the fact that many small businessmen were allowed to go around and call them up again and again .
these include the operation of stations and the origin of these classes , which are parall@@ el with the practice , and should be characterized by orderly civilization , peaceful harmony , and so on and so forth .
the freedom of business deal@@ ers and the confu@@ sion of thoughts have been ru@@ ined obj@@ ectively , these secret public order have been ru@@ ined , and a series of se@@ epage and environmental pollution have been formed . meanwhile , these have provided the conditions and opportunities for them to stay al@@ o@@ of .
what is important is that these are the wind@@ ows of the local spiritual civilization construction , and the cur@@ tains of all the le@@ op@@ ards , the damage is not only an image issue , but also will have an impact on the local economic development .
just think , if you want to become a big and powerful tourist industry , you use this kind of a chao@@ tic , completely bad tourism environment to welcome the guests coming from south to north , who will still dare to come ?
how can your tourism economy achieve results ?
with the arrival of the peak tourist season , it will create a civilized tourism environment for tourists from northern and southern parts of the country . it should be said that the pressing task is to do so .
the practice of these enterprises is not a market , and the operation of small business haw@@ kers should be standardized ; those operating without a license should be resolutely abol@@ ished , and illegal activities should be resolutely cracked down .
only by allowing the jo@@ y to move forward in a civilized and orderly environment can we return to the fore .
let 's say , do n't let traders get imp@@ ati@@ ent .
re@@ wards on their own initiative and re@@ wards .
the dong@@ cheng district in beijing has issued electric stream articles such as rel@@ ocation and rel@@ ocation to 12 households that volun@@ t@@ arily re@@ tained their homes .
( xin@@ jing bao , july 10 )
this writ@@ er is pleased to see the improvement of these family life , but he has not mentioned the proposal of re@@ treating on his own initiative , nor has he himself been re@@ war@@ ded with the award method .
ji@@ angu@@ ang street office deputy director said : regarding the fraud and low security , we encourage people to take the initiative to re@@ pay the insurance , and set examples for other low - income households .
this is an example , if it is to encourage other low - income workers to get out of their difficulties through their own efforts , if they inten@@ d to move along with this , those old personnel who have long been che@@ ated by s@@ wind@@ ling low - income personnel , then they will not be a bit n@@ ai@@ ve .
in differ@@ enti@@ ating and sor@@ ting out low insurance households , what we rely more on is the law .
relevant departments should strengthen the system of minimum allow@@ able income for households who are entitled to basic allow@@ ances : if they report changes in family members and income in a timely manner , report on the employment situation , and accept re@@ examination at regular inter@@ vals , the departments concerned should intensify supervision and inspection .
after all , re@@ treating according to law is a long - term plan .
the neighbor@@ hoo@@ ds re@@ war@@ ded their families with re@@ wards , who is the l@@ um ?
as a government organization of a first - level government , the neighbor@@ hood has to be borne by financial appropri@@ ations .
and the money of the tax@@ pay@@ er should not be fl@@ oc@@ ked ?
on the one hand , the withdrawal from low - income families prov@@ es that they have certain self - sufficient ability , and on the other hand , those applying for minimum insurance do not exist ?
the government 's financial appropri@@ ations , called life - saving money , should be delivered in an ab@@ ys@@ s of mis@@ ery rather than be added to the br@@ oc@@ ade .
liu gang - yi 's words have even made a lot of trouble .
on 10 july , the first township directly elected in the country , xing@@ du@@ o town , mu@@ lan town , was elected mayor of xin@@ du prefecture for the fourth time after taking office . the rate of respondents accepted democracy at 9@@ 7.@@ 0 percent .
during the dialogue with liu gang - yi , liu gang - yi defined himself as a techn@@ ic@@ ian who has served him well .
( xin@@ jing bao yesterday )
the personnel involved in the operation of the press units may be more than those appointed by the system , the personnel involved in the work , and the business circles have become more true and true .
the most important aspect of the system of appointment by direct elections lies in the former mainly determined by ordinary party members and masses , and the latter was mainly appointed by upper - level organizations , and the orientation of the source of power determin@@ es that the former must put the responsibility for the people first .
the source of power and the responsibility to whom one is responsible are the fundamental factors that determine how one is going to carry out his work .
some people questi@@ oned the background of democracy , as well as the style of democracy .
my viewpoint is that with such a democratic style , it is better to have such a democratic style .
considering the history and current situation of democratic political construction at the grassroots level in china , i believe that direct elections for the public sector is a major breakthrough , and democracy is an important part of this construction , which is of no significance to promoting the building of democratic politics at the grassroots level .

her lawyers , and her experience in parliament ,

in india , the g@@ and@@ hi family has controlled the ruling national congress party for a long time .
the pal@@ i was emb@@ rac@@ ed by a large number of female voters , and the female voters believed that the pas@@ u , a female , who had a serious concept of discrimination against women , would raise female status .

according to a report by the us media on the 15th , the negative reaction of the anti - di@@ a@@ bet@@ es drug and other heart diseases caused by wen di has shown a sharp up@@ ward trend in the united states recently .
the food and drug administration of the united states issued a safety warning in may this year , sugg@@ esting di@@ a@@ bet@@ es suf@@ fer@@ ers to be careful because the scientists published the first issue of the new journal " the new medical journal " on 21 may , which says that this type of un@@ sal@@ able drug will greatly increase the inci@@ d@@ ence rate of patients and the inci@@ d@@ ence rate of mor@@ tal@@ ity and the associated heart disease .

a few years ago , with personnel changes , the family buildings of this brigade were un@@ occupied in some of the houses , resulting in difficulties in housing for cadres on the job , and the officers and men had a relatively large opinion on this .
the brigade had also cle@@ ared several rooms , and all of them could not be resolved because of various obstruc@@ tions , thus turning this problem into old and big difficulties .
when a person is a person , he has to be br@@ ave and un@@ shak@@ able , and he has no problem that cannot be solved .

the 2007 military uni@@ form desig@@ ner invited a guest of the chinese military online .
the beijing municipal news conference on july 13 , which was jointly sponsored by the pla general staff headquarters and the pla general logistics department , yang bao@@ jin , reported that the pla units will be changing their military uni@@ forms one after another starting august 1 .
tonight , the china military network specially invited the army logistics department to be transferred to the department 's deputy director chen jun and senior engine@@ er of the military equipment institute , the senior engine@@ er on the military equipment research institute , who had been invited to visit the china military network , and the army and foreign network , as network experts , who were born in new uni@@ forms and developed in the course of new military uni@@ forms , have ev@@ o@@ ked re@@ perc@@ ussions among ne@@ tiz@@ ens .
the two honor@@ able guests are the company 's direct research and development of the 07 style army suit .
on the changes in the new uni@@ form , they said that the 2007 military uni@@ form is a re@@ shap@@ ing style , especially in the 97 style military uni@@ form .
the most important characteristic of the 07 style military uni@@ form is the chain of the super@@ structure and the shift of personnel , making the military uni@@ form reach the level of coordination between the three armed services for the first time , and the sign of the establishment of the level of military uni@@ form construction has achieved a historic leap .
the two guests also exchanged views on the new style of the army style no. 1 and the ye@@ bu style .
the current event was jointly produced by the china military net and the new wave network , and the lan .
the pla platform of jing@@ jiang city has upgraded the quality of cadres .
recently , the company started its business operation on 18 june , and started operation on 18 june .
this is the result of the practice of the military personnel department , which has exer@@ ted efforts on raising the overall quality of the cadres of special forces in light of the actual conditions of their posts .
at the beginning of this year , the party committee of the people 's armed forces department discovered during a study and investigation at the grassroots level that some cadres who are engaged in a long and concurrently work in the armed forces department have not concentrated their energ@@ ies on the armed forces work .
for this reason , they have conducted training on the basis of concentr@@ ating on training and relying on training in local party schools , and have conducted regular training for cadres with special arms , and focused on resolving the problem of un@@ it@@ ary professional training for cadres with the knowledge of wu cadres .
in light of the central task , the task of making cadres of the armed forces ' diplomatic work was arduous , and the task was arduous .
at the same time , they actively coordinated local organization departments and jointly formulated the " program for the appointment of cadres with special military skills " , which clearly stipulates that the minister of armed forces must enter the leadership team of the party committee and stop from being involved in other duties ;
we have established a mechanism for the adjustment and exchange of cadres , and we have not read@@ justed some cadres who are in large str@@ at@@ ag@@ em from the grassroots level , read@@ justed and exchanged them in a timely manner , and promoted and used comrades who have good overall quality and good work ability .
not long ago , chen y@@ is@@ ong , secretary general of the armed forces department of the new century company , ltd. , led the militi@@ a technical detachment in innov@@ ating under@@ water ship technology to fill in domestic issues , which was upgraded to the company 's armed forces department .
good start , good end .
from the outcome of the match alone , the score of 2 - 2 is reasonable , and it is acceptable to all . the key is the process of the match , and it is regre@@ tt@@ able to many .
if iran is 2 - 0 ahead , then the sym@@ ph@@ ony will be equ@@ alized , then the feeling of china 's inland feeling will definitely be different , and the morale of the team is , the opposite of the situation .
when the good is not good at the end , it can be said that it is old dis@@ sen@@ sion .
the company often does not know how to play in situations , and the general view is that china 's psychological quality is not up to the mark .
this is indeed the l@@ augh@@ ing cause of the l@@ ung@@ s .
however , judging from the current competition , it seems that it is not as good as it is .
sun ji@@ hai , sun shi@@ xiang , sh@@ aw sh@@ aw , zheng xing@@ zhi and others k@@ ic@@ ked ball in europe and li wei feng and others were also ji@@ u@@ feng 's veteran who had gone on the s@@ and field . they saw that they had a broad understanding of the whole world and would not have any problems in psychological quality according to reas@@ oning .
this re@@ jo@@ ic@@ ing has been forced to settle by the iranian team , perhaps it will be a drill on the run and re@@ pat@@ ri@@ ation .
under the back@@ war@@ dness of the iranian team , the two men were immediately moved to the scene .
the second half of the tour has also changed three , but the effect is not good .
we should overcome the problem of being good at the beginning and not to end well and accurately find out the root causes of the problem .
as long as the problems are accurately identified and the wrong methods are changed , it is probably not difficult to find them .
they are afraid of dr@@ opping a doctor if they are in urgent need .
if this is the case , the old problems will be left behind in another game . the talks will not be a problem everyone is hoping for .
