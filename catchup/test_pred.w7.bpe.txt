experts believe that the pro@@ tot@@ yp@@ e of insurance will not be used in the short term in the domestic stock market
chin@@ ane@@ ws , july 30
according to a report by china securities news , recently the " interim procedures for managing investment in offshore insurance funds " were promulgated , and insurance funds have broader space for utilizing the capital market .
china 's chief investment officer liu le@@ fei believes that the appreciation of the rmb and the good development of the domestic capital market will not be achieved by insurance organizations in the near future through the purchase of foreign exchange , which also means that insurance , ca@@ rel@@ ine , will not diver@@ t funds from the domestic stock market in the short run .
according to reports , many insurance institutions hold the same views .
experts said that since there is no market for renminbi products , insurance institutions are not fully equipped to avoid risks , so the time for large - scale foreign exchange purchases is not yet ri@@ pe .
liu le@@ fei said : judging from the long - term situation , foreign investment in the area of asset allocation should occupy a certain proportion of the overall allocation of insurance companies .
however , in view of the relatively large pressure on the appreciation of the rmb , china will mainly make use of its own foreign exchange funds to make overseas investment .
for foreign investment , the current situation should be cautious in dealing with the purchase of foreign exchange .

chen shui - bian secre@@ tly interven@@ ed in the election the " judiciary " in taiwan denied and asked him to explain the matter .
chin@@ ane@@ ws , july 30 chen shui - bian questi@@ oned the taiwan judicial personnel 's attempt to get involved in the election of the leader of the taiwan region .
the executive authorities of taiwan 's judicial yuan said on the same day that the current performance of the judges on the island is different from what chen shui - bian said and also demanded that chen shui - bian give an explanation of the statement .
according to taiwan 's " ching " report , chen shui - bian questi@@ oned the judge 's name or investig@@ ator on 30 may . due to political factors or election considerations , he interven@@ ed in the election , which even attempted to influence the election campaign activities of the candidates of various parties . he said he hoped that such a phenomenon would not exist in taiwan , but it was very difficult .
in view of chen shui - bian 's qu@@ ery , the court president of taiwan 's ministry of justice , yue sheng , answered , and secretary general fan ku@@ ang - q@@ un , representing the judicial affairs council , spoke on behalf of the c@@ m@@ p .
k@@ ao ch@@ ie@@ h said that taiwan 's fundamental law and the code of conduct of judges all declared that judges should go beyond the party and should not participate in party activities or assist in election of political parties , and that judges should strictly observe relevant rules . the court of justice believes that judges are very cautious in doing this .
k@@ ao ch@@ ie@@ h pointed out that the higher authorities of kaohsiung division have decided to send a delegation to k@@ ad@@ ena university a few years ago because the relevant courses have political party and the legal foundation for the judge 's self - discipline committee .
zhang sheng@@ xi once wanted to join the democratic progressive party [ dpp ] because he took the position to run for the election , and finally decided to abandon the election .
gao jin@@ chi said that if the trial of individual cases is conducted , there will be no final ad@@ jud@@ ication of the results of the judg@@ ments alone . he said that the judge should have other political intentions .
germany to cut import thre@@ sh@@ old for professional personnel
the first meeting of the joint military exercise of the people 's liberation army ( pla ) was held in ber@@ lin on july 1 .
german minister of education and scientific research sh@@ av@@ an said a few days ago that germany should reduce the amount of foreign professional talent imported in the " ca@@ ve " and , through increasing the introduction of foreign talent , solve the problems of specialized talent facing germany .
the report of the organization of economic cooperation ( o@@ ec@@ d ) said that the number of workers from germany , aged between 15 and 64 , will drop year after year .
if there is no sufficient immigration to 20@@ 69 , germany 's labor force will be 6 percent less than the current level .
however , the german federation of employers and the german engine@@ ers association and other organizations have reported that engine@@ ers and technicians in germany are rather broad - minded .
the german labor bureau said that the german labor market had been sl@@ ug@@ g@@ ish in may this year , with a supply of about 17@@ 0,000 workers and a technical speci@@ alist providing about 9@@ 600 workers .
germany has made great efforts to protect its own people 's employment and introduce foreign talent .
according to the german " th@@ ec@@ ard " law , non - european countries do not have a professional talent in germany whose length is less than 8@@ 5@@ 5,000 eur@@ os , otherwise they will not be allowed to work in germany and stay in germany .
the s@@ ay@@ y@@ af proposed to lower this quota to the bottom of the euro .
we should not blin@@ dly believe in the law .
the " law on lawyers " revised recently submitted to the npc standing committee for examination and discussion stipulates that those who have engaged in legal research , pe@@ tro@@ chemical , and other professional work , and who have the same professional level , such as senior practitioners , will apply for the law to practi@@ se their own business . after examination and approval by the state council 's judicial and administrative departments , they will be granted to the law enforcement profession .
( " zhong@@ guo tong@@ x@@ un " on 28 june )
legal , there are theoretical and practical affairs in the legal community , and the former mainly includes legal teaching and research work .
for a long time , the legal profession and the actual circulation have been written in the small circulation of the local people , and the theoretical circle believes that the actual situation is not necessary , and the basic ten@@ et of the machine is only the ro@@ ster of the mechan@@ ized ton@@ gue , and the real - estate sector has made preparations for the theoretical circles in the municipality .
the legal system can do a lot of work to maintain the gap between the work and the work of assisting the other side .
however , the appearance of the law@@ yer in the law obj@@ ectively recogn@@ izes the legal system and the legal system , which is higher than the actual function of the legal profession .
in fact , some foreign - related research institutes , such as international laws , which are purely theoretical research and teaching , have been deeply moved by the theory of the law .
in this way , the legal system of the procur@@ ator undoubtedly has the legal status of being chao@@ tic .
the super@@ sti@@ tion in theoretical circles is not only these , but also experts and experts ' argu@@ ments will often affect or even ve@@ to the court 's decision . this is also a direct expression of this kind of super@@ sti@@ tion .

britain low@@ ers terrorist attacks
xinhua news agency , london , july 5 , by reporter lin guo
the british government has made a terrorist attack from the highest level to the level of serious drought , which means that the british terrorist attack will not occur soon , but the attack is still extremely pre@@ mature .
at present , the british police have transferred the scope of investigation to india and australia .
the police have been arrested for the attack because the eight suspects were working in the medical system and the government will provide assistance to the outside immigrants who have entered the medical system .
it is reported that nearly 10,000 workers working in the british public medical system are receiving medical treatment overseas .
the prime minister also demanded that the migr@@ ation of high technology be investigated , and that employers or related agencies be asked to provide background information .
let the traders get trouble .
the car was un@@ earth@@ ed and its tu@@ be was clean@@ ed , and the water was covered by natural gas and other fruits of social civilization to the greatest extent .
however , many people came out to visit the country , and they all encountered such a kind of worry . in the hearts of many traders and intermedi@@ aries who were doing business , they were bes@@ i@@ eg@@ ed and ch@@ ased out of the intermedi@@ ary .
both cars and tr@@ ains , all on - going vehicles will be affected by small traders and some unlicensed intermedi@@ aries .
it is not a pe@@ an@@ u@@ t pe@@ ar , which is to sell newspapers and peri@@ o@@ dic@@ als , and many other ir@@ t@@ ical t@@ ab@@ lets , such as the cat@@ ering industry , even the intermedi@@ ary t@@ estim@@ ony , etc.
if you do not accept it , he can catch you several hundred meters , and it is very difficult to become ben@@ evol@@ ent if you are un@@ successful .
in some of the wind@@ ows , many of them have the same feeling .
before the gate is opened , some people will travel around the clock and small ones will be dri@@ ed .
after entering the door , this situation will become even more serious . if the good y@@ ax@@ ing is also sup@@ posed to be a little bit too much .
some media reported that many foreign tourists who went to xian were deeply impres@@ sed by the an@@ ch@@ or@@ ing scene , but they did not agree to allowing the many small business haw@@ kers who had been so many to sell them .
these include the wind of the station , which is like a large tu@@ be , and should be pol@@ ished in order and calm and harmonious , and give a good impression of the snow in a calm and calm environment .
the free parts of the traders were bu@@ st@@ ling and the bu@@ c@@ ks were not talking about , obj@@ ectively they destroyed these public order , and formed a protective screen and environmental pollution . at the same time , they provided the goods to the peasants for conditions and opportunities .
what is important is that these wind@@ ows of local spiritual civilization construction are all scre@@ ens , and the damage is not just the problem of image , but also the impact on local economic development .
just think , if you want to become a strong tourism industry , you use this chao@@ tic and swe@@ eping tourism environment to gre@@ et the arrival of the visitors from south to north , who is willing to come , who dare to come ?
how did your tourism economy achieve economic results ?
with the arrival of the peak tourism season , tourists from north to south will create a civilized environment for tourism . it should be said that the top priority is to set up a civilized tourist environment .
the market is not the business of small business haw@@ kers , and the business of unlicensed operations should be resolutely abol@@ ished . illegal activities should be resolutely cracked down .
only in a civilized and orderly environment can we feel happy and make the country prosperous and rejuven@@ ate and re@@ jo@@ ice .
in one word , let the traders not touch the trouble .
the " falungong " cult has been re@@ war@@ ded with its own initiative .
the building street in the dong@@ cheng district of beijing is used to distribu@@ te electricity and other materials , as a special incen@@ tive for 12 households to volun@@ t@@ arily re@@ pay their income .
( " xin@@ jing bao " july 10 )
this writ@@ er is happy for the improvement of living conditions in these families , but it is still necessary to make a tu@@ it@@ ous reward for the improvement of their family life .
ji@@ ao@@ jie city office deputy director said that in view of the low - income situation , it is necessary to encourage the withdrawal of the insurance from the other low - income households .
if this example is to encourage other low - income workers to extr@@ icate themselves from the predic@@ ament through their own efforts , it is indeed worth advocating that if it wants to use this to mu@@ ster those people who have long been che@@ ating and v@@ ying for low - income , it will not be possible to be somewhat inf@@ ant .
in the process of distingu@@ ishing and clean@@ ing up low - income households , what we rely more on is the law .
the departments concerned should strengthen the management of low - income households when enjoying low - income insurance : if they promptly report on the changes in family and income , report on employment situation , accept regular re@@ examination , and so on , the departments concerned should increase the intensity of supervision and inspection .
after all , it is not long to have the power to withdraw .
the streets were re@@ war@@ ded with the residents ' family re@@ tention money , and who bur@@ ied the money ?
the streets , as primary government organizations , are appropri@@ ated by the financial authorities .
and the tax@@ pay@@ er 's money should not be spent ?
on the one hand , a family that with@@ dra@@ ws from low - income families has possess@@ ed a certain amount of self - suffici@@ ency in the supply and demand ; on the other hand , is the number of people applying for low - income insurance still not ?
the government financial appropri@@ ation , which is called a saving money , should send the money in the snow , instead of adding flowers to the br@@ oc@@ ade .
liu di@@ an@@ yi is willing to serve as a service provid@@ er .
on 10 july , the first state - run township ju@@ fang was elected directly by the state council . liu ba@@ jie , a native of hu@@ an@@ ji@@ u district , accepted democratic hear@@ ti@@ ly after taking office for the fourth time , with the rate of satisfaction reaching 9@@ 7.@@ 7 percent .
at the dialogue with liu gang , liu di@@ yi described his position as a " p@@ end@@ ant " and said that he was not willing to go to the united states .
( yesterday 's " xin@@ jing bao " )
liu da@@ wei 's service personnel may be better than some appointed cadres .
the system of the system of appointment by the public election is the most important because the former is determined by the masses of ordinary party members , and the latter is primarily by the higher - level organization and appointment , and the power source has determined that the former must be responsible to the people .
the source of power and the responsibility for the person elected are the fundamental factors determining how the person elected will carry out his work .
some people doubt that such democracy is like a democratic demonstration , like a democratic dragon .
my view is that there are such a kind of pro@@ pr@@ ie@@ tary democratic form , which is better than it is .
considering the historical and historical conditions of the building of democracy at the grassroots level in china , i believe that the open election is a major breakthrough , democracy is a dark ha@@ ze , and it is of great significance to promoting the building of democracy at the grassroots level .
india is expected to select the first female presidential candidate by an analy@@ st , saying that the possibility of being elected is relatively high , and female voters hope that it will raise women 's status .
on 23 june , in front of the presidential candidate document , par@@ ag@@ li@@ er was elected as president .
the cur@@ tain of the indian presidential election opened on 19 july . the new president will be elected by the current vice president , sh@@ aw@@ a@@ it , and the governor of ra@@ jap@@ ak@@ sa , who was recently re@@ signed from his office , j@@ as@@ want g@@ ad@@ b@@ erg@@ an@@ b@@ ar , governor of the state of india .
p@@ ach@@ ach@@ i is the first female presidential candidate in india 's history . if she is elected , she will become india 's first female president .
the ruling party presidential candidate xie q@@ at@@ ar , who is a candidate of the ruling party , came from the opposition people 's party .
since the congress party occup@@ ies a dominant position in the presidential election , the media and the people are all anx@@ ious about the election , and the possibility of being elected by p@@ ag@@ er is relatively high .
the 72 - year - old par@@ ag@@ li@@ ar is female governor of ra@@ j@@ as@@ than state .
her law@@ yer , whose family members have entered the congress with rich experience , has been working hard to make her living a living in the government of j@@ ay@@ a@@ af .
she also worked for social welfare , and was a part of many cultural and social welfare organizations .
analysts pointed out that the reason why pat@@ o@@ ke became a candidate was because she was un@@ w@@ aver@@ ingly linked to the indian national party chairman s@@ onia g@@ and@@ hi .
in india , the g@@ and@@ an family has long controlled the ruling national congress party .
the woman was hung by a large number of female voters , and the female voters believed that p@@ ag@@ er would face the serious problem of discrimination against women in india 's image and raise her status .
the constitution stipulates that india is a federal state , and the president is nom@@ in@@ ally the head of state and the commander of the state , and it does not represent any party organization , and more of it is a symbol@@ ic .

the reason why the report on the negative re@@ actions caused by di@@ a@@ bet@@ es drugs has increased sharply
according to the us media report on the 15th , the heart disease and other bad re@@ actions caused by anti@@ di@@ a@@ bet@@ es drugs , et@@ ce@@ a , have recently shown a big up@@ ward trend in the united states .
the us food and drug administration issued a security warning in may this year , sugg@@ esting that the di@@ a@@ bet@@ es patient use a written document to express the view that scientists had found the same way to make a report on the first issue of the new medicine magazine published on 21 may . the research report said that the v@@ end@@ or sales will greatly increase the inci@@ d@@ ence of heart disease and the ratio of patients ' inci@@ d@@ ence of heart disease and the ratio of bul@@ k of psy@@ cho@@ trop@@ ic
the doctor and the patient 's close attention was therefore received by the doctor .
statistics show that about one month after the issuance of the safety warning , the us pharmaceutical administration received 3@@ 57 examples of cl@@ ay@@ a , which triggered a negative reaction , of which 38 were fatal reports .
in january and february this year , the bureau received only 50 and 73 applications respectively .
these bad re@@ actions ligh@@ tly hit the water bu@@ b@@ ble , and the weight of sudden sudden death of heart disease .
however , the drug experts of the us drug administration believe that the conclusion of the un@@ safe conclusion of man di@@ ya is still too early .
the pharm@@ acy and pois@@ ons board will hold a hearing on the doctor 's statement on july 30 .
in 1999 , wen di@@ ya was an island mag@@ ic ac@@ et@@ y@@ len@@ e that applied to ther@@ a@@ pe@@ u@@ tic treatment .
there are about 6 million di@@ a@@ bet@@ es in the world who have taken or are taking v@@ in@@ ya .

first , distingu@@ ishing functions .
different countries ' armed forces and people 's important military symb@@ ols should be differ@@ enti@@ ated .
in the world , the military of more than 100 countries , big and small , is basically the same in the use of military uni@@ forms , but there are no military uni@@ forms of any two countries .
second , symbol@@ izing functions .
to a certain extent , military uni@@ forms are not only a symb@@ ol of a nation 's spirit and national characteristics , but also a symb@@ ol of the combat capability of a country 's military .
in the cour@@ ty@@ ard , the three major military uni@@ forms were usually dres@@ sed in the uni@@ form of the third army , which fully demonstrated the might of the army , and the el@@ eg@@ ant el@@ eg@@ ant dres@@ s .

a few years ago , with the personnel 's hands and property of the unit being illegally occupied , the house of the group 's family building was over@@ taken , making it difficult for the cadres to have housing , and the officers and men were quite satisfied with this .
the group also cle@@ ared several rooms , and they were unable to resolve all kinds of resistance , making the problem an old man who was in a difficult position .

on the changes in the new military uni@@ form , they said that the 2007 military uni@@ form was replaced with a particularly large amount of ammunition in the 97 - type military uni@@ form .
the most important feature of the 7 - type military uni@@ form is the combination of the co@@ efficient and the combination of man - made functions , making the military uni@@ form for the first time reach the level of coordination of the three armed services and the standard of coordination of the whole series of pieces of operation , indicating that the level of the army 's military uni@@ form building has made a historical leap forward .
the two guests also exchanged views on the new military uni@@ form model , the sk@@ el@@ et@@ on , and other issues .

the jing@@ jiang city people 's armed forces platform has upgraded the quality of specialized military cadres
the " blue army " of the pla forces on 18 june carried out a joint military exercise in jing@@ jiang city , jiangsu province , which was jointly organized by the armed forces department of x@@ il@@ ai town , lu y@@ qing , on " winning the battle of information technology " .
this is a new practice of the ministry of personnel in con@@ junction with the actual situation of their posts in exer@@ ting efforts to improve the comprehensive quality of cadres with specialized arms .
early this year , the party committee of the people 's armed forces department discovered when conducting investigations and studies at the grassroots level that some cadres who had worked in the central authorities and were concurrently concurrently held in the position did not devote their main energy to the work of armed forces .
for this reason , they have adopted the method of concentr@@ ating on training the students and relying on training at local party schools to conduct regular training of cadres with special arms and to focus on resolving the difficult problems of speci@@ alty cadres ' knowledge and skill level of operation .
in light of the central tasks , they boldly carried out tasks to cadres with special skills and worked hard to improve their abilities to work in their posts .
at the same time , they actively coordinated local organization departments , jointly formulated the " plan for hir@@ ing cadres with special arms " , clearly stipul@@ ating that the armed forces minister must join the party committee and that they will not be able to leave other posts ;
and established a mechanism for the adjustment and exchange of cadres with special skills , and made arrangements for some cadres who are older and unable to adapt to the work of armed forces at the grassroots level in a timely manner , and for comrades who have a strong ability to work in all aspects , such as those who have good overall quality and ability to work hard .
not long ago , chen yi - song , director of the new century 's dynam@@ ite company , led the militi@@ amen technical detachment in innov@@ ating on the under@@ water ship , which was upgraded to the armed forces department of the company .
the first and the first will be good .
from the result of the competition alone , the two - to - two score is reasonable , and also can be accepted by the heart of the competition , and the more regre@@ tt@@ able it is .
if the iranian team leads by 2 to 0 , then pul@@ l the ball in the chinese , then it will definitely be different .
the good will cannot be good , and we can say that it is a bad old problem .
the situation is often not good for the ball under the condition of the situation . the general public view is that china 's psychological quality is not perfect .
this is indeed a kind of thing that cannot be done in the end .
however , judging from the competition today , it seems that it is not going to happen .
sun ji@@ hai , sun jia@@ xiang , sh@@ ao ji@@ ao@@ yan , and others k@@ ic@@ ked in europe , but they did not say that li wei and others were the survi@@ v@@ ors of the long - standing s@@ and . they saw many things in their minds . according to reason , they would not have any psychological quality .
it was regre@@ tt@@ able that the iranian team was forced to settle the situation , because it was not easy to deploy troops .
the iranian team has replaced two teams under a backward condition , and the scene was immediately pul@@ led out .
the second half was also replaced with three other names , and the results were not good .
we should overcome the problem of being good and not good and must find the root of the problem .
as long as the problem is accurately found , it is probably not difficult to find the way to get rid of the problem .
they are afraid of being forced to go to the hospital in a rush .
if it continues , the car will be more competition , and the old problem will also be off@@ ended .
