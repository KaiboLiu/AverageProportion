wang yuan : china 's economic growth is still in the best period
experts believe that the shad@@ ow of structural upgrading in the short term will not be diverted into the domestic stock market for short term .
chin@@ ane@@ ws , july 30 - the china news service
according to a report by china securities news , the " regulations on the management of overseas investment of insurance funds " was promulgated a few days ago . insurance funds have a broader space for the use of capital markets .
china 's chief investment company , liu le@@ fei , believes that the appreciation of the renminbi and the domestic capital market are good , and the insurance institutions will not be able to buy foreign exchange through foreign exchange in the short term . this also means that the industry should not be covered by the domestic stock market funds within a short period of time .
the report said that many insurance institutions hold the same viewpoint .
experts say that since the current rmb remains un@@ popular , the insurance institutions still have no risk - avo@@ id@@ ance means , and therefore , the tim@@ ing for large - scale foreign exchange purchase is still not mature .
liu le@@ fei said : from a long - term point of view , in the aspect of asset allocation , foreign investment should play a certain role in the overall distribution of insurance companies .
however , given the current relatively large rmb appreciation , the rmb is a large portion of china 's foreign exchange reserves , which will mainly be used by china 's own foreign exchange funds .
as for foreign - funded enterprises that have acquired foreign exchange under the present circumstances , they should be treated with cau@@ tion .

chen shui - bian approv@@ es judicial intervention in election of taiwan 's " judicial yuan " den@@ ies and wants to explain
chin@@ ane@@ ws , july 20 c china 's radio industry is expected to be a key channel for cross - strait exchanges .
taiwan 's executive yuan has a high standard of administration .
according to a report by taiwan 's " shad@@ ow , " judge chen shui - bian questi@@ oned whether the prosecu@@ tor or the investigation personnel were involved in the case of interference due to political factors or election considerations . he even tried to influence the election campaign activities of candidates of various parties . he said he hoped that this phenomenon would not exist in taiwan , but it might be very difficult .

gao jin@@ chi said : taiwan 's fundamental law and the code of practice for judges clearly state that judges should be more than par@@ tis@@ an and should not take part in party activities or election .
gao jin@@ zhi pointed out : kaohsiung is a big city with high added value . chang xiang@@ zhi , a judge of the kaohsiung intermediate court , attended a training course at k@@ ai@@ da university a few years ago . that is , because the courses have party col@@ ors and are a self - discipline committee composed of judges .
zhang sheng@@ xi once wanted to take part in the democratic progressive party [ dpp ] , and was also involved in disputes over his taking up office .

germany to reduce the import thre@@ sh@@ old for professional personnel
the staff headquarters of the pla navy in ber@@ lin , which is now in the process of studying and implementing the scientific development concept ,
the german minister of education and scientific research , sha wan@@ xiang , said the other day that germany should lower the " phil@@ an@@ thr@@ op@@ y " of foreign experts , and through increasing the scope of the restrictions on foreign personnel , it is necessary to solve the problems of professional personnel being en@@ vis@@ aged by germany .
according to the o@@ ec@@ d , during the period of 15 to 64 years of age between 15 and 64 , germany 's labor force will gradually decrease .
if there is no sufficient immigration , then it will be difficult to control the population of x@@ iz@@ hao , germany , by 6 percent .
however , the german federation of employers and the german engine@@ ers association report that among germany 's current labor market , engine@@ ers are over 50 professional technical personnel , and they are more professional technical personnel .
according to the statistics of the german federal labor bureau , german labor market increased by 3.@@ 2 percent in may this year , compared with 1.@@ 27 million in may . skilled workers are suppl@@ ying some 9@@ 00,000 yuan to the latter .
germany has made great efforts to protect its own people 's employment and to train and train foreign personnel .
the " tu@@ mul@@ tu@@ ous law " stipulates that the professional personnel of non - eu countries are not qualified in germany , which is less than 8@@ 5@@ 5,000 eur@@ os , otherwise they cannot be permitted to work and stay in germany .
sha wan suggested that the limit be lowered to the level of the flow of natural resources to the flow of natural resources .
do not have a super@@ sti@@ tion theory and knowledge about law
recently , the draft amendment to the law on lawyers submitted to the npc standing committee for examination and approval stipulates : " a law@@ yer who has engaged in legal research and other professional work , including teaching , has higher professional qualifications or qualifications . he applied for a law@@ yer 's practice , and was approved by the judicial administrative department of the state council , and is allowed to practice the law .
( adopted by the " china threat " on 28 june )
there are laws that la@@ g behind and accumul@@ ate experience in theoretical circles and practice over - emphasis on science , law , and education .
for a long time , the legal circle and the mass media have over - per@@ v@@ as@@ ive literary and art phenomena , which involve complicated theories , such as the theory about journ@@ alism , which is considered necessary in the field of journ@@ alism , only the mechanical alone is a piece of clo@@ th which is a mon@@ ster ; the fact that the theory of affairs , which is a critical of the circle in the circle of theory , is not a guide for practice .
for such a division of labor , the law can do is to maintain the truth of being a citizen who is not a leader who supports any party .
however , the " law on lawyers " stipulates that a legal system should be created by a legal person .
in fact , some people engaged in legal system activities such as the international law , are purely theoretical research and teaching , and their theoretical knowledge is more important than ever before .
this kind of " leg@@ acy " is undoubtedly a legal system , which is a leg@@ acy of legal practice .
the theory of being a super@@ sti@@ tion in theoretical circles still not only has not been heard about these , but experts and feasibility studies will often influence or even deny the courts ' judg@@ ements , and it is also a direct manif@@ estation of this kind of super@@ sti@@ tion .

the vessel application can choose shanghai 's li@@ an@@ he shipping company to handle matters related to ship registration in hong kong .
britain to lower the level of terrorist attacks
on july 5 , the first batch of new - type aircraft , which will be developed by the pla , will be sent to the pla navy , which will be stationed in the southern part of the country .
the british government will soon launch a terrorist attack from the top level to the serious burden of the golden week , which indicates that britain 's terrorist attack will not soon occur , but the attack remains extremely complicated . it is likely that the threat will continue to be extremely widespread .
at present , the british police will shift the investigation scope to india and australia .
as the eight arrested people were still under arrest , the police have been working in the medical system and the government will conduct a thorough investigation into the illegal immigration of foreign immigrants who have entered the medical system .
it has been learned that the " falungong " cult in britain 's public medical system has recently been " don@@ ated overseas to medical care . "

but in china ,
whether it is cars or tr@@ ains , the driving sau@@ c@@ er always faces small business deal@@ ers and some un@@ veri@@ fied intermedi@@ ary deaths .
it is not a big fl@@ ower - like s@@ la@@ p , that is , it is a magazine selling a lot of t@@ estim@@ ony to food safety . it even leads to a false impression , and so on .
if you do n't accept it , he can ch@@ ase you several hundred meters , and there is a big un@@ successful cause of ben@@ evol@@ ence .
in some places , many wind and waves are similar .
the door was opened , and some people came from tourist guid@@ es and small ones .
after entering the door , this state of affairs will become even more . no matter how good y@@ age , y@@ a@@ ho@@ o is also described as having little sh@@ od@@ dy sm@@ ell .
some media reports have said that the many foreign tourists in xian are very interested in xian 's temple .
these include the construction of a bridge linking the east of the west kowloon highway , a railway station , a railway station , a garden , a place that is a place where a civilization is orderly and harmonious , and a relaxed environment for the prosperity of a country .
the free flow of goods , such as tu@@ mul@@ tu@@ ous tu@@ jia , a fish@@ er , has caused a sti@@ r@@ ring social atmosphere , and the social order of these kinds has formed a flow of wor@@ s@@ ening and environmental pollution . at the same time , it has also provided the conditions and opportunities for sh@@ aking up .
what is important is that these mas@@ ks are built up by local spiritual civilization construction wind@@ ows , which allow the entire le@@ op@@ ard , and which are damaged not only by image but also have a profound impact on local economic development .
just think , if you want to become a strong tourist industry , you can use this kind of want@@ on and indiscrimin@@ ate tourist environment to gre@@ et the south - north guests .
your tourism economy is also getting benefits ?
with the growth of tourism , it will bring new opportunities to the tourists from north and south of the country .
it is not a market , small mer@@ ch@@ ants ' operational behaviors should be standardized , and the operation of un@@ certified products should be resolutely canc@@ elled . illegal activities should be resolutely cracked down .
a civilized and orderly environment can only allow the masses to feel happy and allow them to pros@@ per as soon as possible .
in a word , not to let the shops sell .

this writ@@ er has provided a valuable experience for improving the living conditions of these families , but he has taken the initiative to keep the word " protection " and has added a burden to the administration .
the neighbor@@ hood committee deputy director said : the disaster relief fund was collecting funds from foreign enterprises in a bid to che@@ at low - income insurance . it is a major measure for the community to extend holiday greetings to those who have been jo@@ bl@@ ess and poor security .
this example , if it is to encourage other low - income people to make efforts to extr@@ icate themselves from the predic@@ ament , it is indeed worth advocating , and if this is to use this to inspir@@ e those old friends who want to dece@@ ive the people who have long been dece@@ ived by s@@ wind@@ ling , it is not something that is inf@@ le@@ xi@@ ble .
in terms of differ@@ enti@@ ation and clearing up of low - income households , we should rely more on legal measures .
the departments concerned should strengthen the management of low - income households and ensure that they can enjoy the minimum guarantee . for instance , they should report to the family members and their income in good time , report on the employment situation , and accept peri@@ od@@ ic review . the departments concerned should step up supervision and inspection .
after all , the act of paying over@@ due taxes and fees is a long - term strategy .
the neighbor@@ hood committee has been paying close attention to the re@@ assurance of family members . who is bur@@ ied by the family ?
neighbor@@ hoo@@ ds are the first - level government organization , and their expenditures are borne by the treasury .
the natural tax money of a tax@@ pay@@ er should not be used ?
on the one hand , the number of households that have with@@ drawn from the minimum guarantee has proved that they have certain ability to add a certain degree of self - end@@ uring experience , and on the other hand , the number of persons applying for low - income insurance is not yet present .
the rescue center , which is called lif@@ es@@ aving money , should provide emergency relief materials in the snow instead of adding fuel to the br@@ oc@@ ade .
liu said that china is willing to serve as a service provid@@ er , and this remark is even more a question of concern .
on 10 july , the first public - run election committee was held in chang@@ sha city , a city in china . the residents of q@@ il@@ an town , q@@ il@@ an town , were interviewed by reporters who were satisfied with democracy and were satisfied for the fourth time after assuming office .

liu gang 's bel@@ l@@ iger@@ ent will be a thor@@ ough@@ er than some appointed cadres .
public promotion is a major measure of the system of appointing officials through direct elections , and the former is mainly composed of ordinary party members who decide the source of power , and the latter is mainly appointed by the higher authorities , and the direction of the source of power determin@@ es that the former must be responsible for the people .
the source of power and the responsibility for whom are the decisive factors for determining how the elected person should carry out his work .
some people questi@@ oned such a democratic feeling of being more like a kind of democratic show .
my view is that some people have such a democratic approach .
considering the fact that china 's grassroots democratic political construction is a historical and current situation , i believe that the promotion of public elections is a major breakthrough . democratic supervision is a key link in this important aspect of democracy . it is of great significance to promoting the building of grassroots democratic politics .

modern military uni@@ forms are three major functions
first , the functions of identification .
different countries ' armies have different types of military branches and people 's important symb@@ ols .
in the world , the number of countries , big or small , is still less than one - third of the military use , but there is no military use of any two countries .
second , symbol@@ ic functions .
to a certain extent , the military uni@@ form is a spiritual outlook of a country and a symb@@ ol of a nation 's characteristics , and is also a symb@@ ol of a military fighting capacity of a country .
in a cour@@ te@@ ous fashion , a training exercise was conducted in three military uni@@ forms .
third , the defense function .
with the development of high - tech weapons and equipment , the enhancement of the new - type comprehensive defense capabilities of the new - type operational training has the characteristics of defense against acci@@ d@@ ental det@@ ection of chemical warfare which is guarding against radi@@ ation from the control of chemical warfare , as well as the transfer of hu@@ a@@ er functions in many forms , which have become a top priority issue in the development of military uni@@ form .

a certain brigade 's party committee organs d@@ ared to handle problems over the past decade or so when they could handle problems from a lack of transparency .
the pla air force 's chengdu military region 's general staff headquarters ,
mr chu chung - mao , who is a professor of science , said : " we can live in the la@@ yers of our houses and benefit from the efforts and courage of the party committee of the large team .
today , a certain communications training regiment of the chengdu military region has more than 10 cadres living in qi@@ qi@@ a@@ om@@ u 's house . they have a great enthusiasm for the members of the party committee , who have the courage to tackle problems of genuine and hard work style , and a great pleasure in their knowledge and practice .
a few years ago , with the emergence of personnel , the family properties of this brigade were covered by the illegal over@@ st@@ aff@@ ing , which made the housing difficulties of cadres in the division difficult . officers and soldiers were quite dis@@ satisfied with this .
the group also had a number of houses , and all had been unable to get any end due to various obstacles , thus making this problem a big problem .
the feeling of being ent@@ ang@@ lement and lo@@ ose - and - mou@@ th cannot be resolved .
the new term of party committee leadership group reached a consensus , with the main leaders personally attending to the meeting , to discuss all problems of illegal occupation of houses .
on the one hand , they were engaged in extr@@ av@@ ag@@ ance , hope that the personnel concerned would pay attention to the fact that the houses of military houses were built by the money raised from houses that are suitable for the economy , and this shows that the party committees have a firm determination and a principled stand .
we must also resolutely investigate and handle some housing problems that involve bureaucr@@ acy and bureaucr@@ acy , which are difficult to resist , and which occupy housing .
after two months of meticulous work , the experts in the area of inner mongolia who illegally occupy more than 20 housing in violation of rules and regulations have been removed on schedule . cadres at the brigade level have all been given housing according to the regulations .
the party committee of the brigade d@@ ared to tackle tough problems through hard work , and this has added a new effect on organization distribution . the past several " golden tri@@ angle " cadres who were unwilling to actively cooperate with the organization distribution have also expressed their willingness to obe@@ y the decision .

jing@@ jiang city people 's armed forces platform elev@@ ates the professional quality of cadres
on the afternoon of the same day , cao jia@@ bin , commander of the pla air force 's jin@@ jiang city , was transferred to a large number of military cadres in jing@@ jiang city , jiangsu province .
this is a typical case of the la@@ o@@ yi family taking into consideration the actual work posts , putting stress on raising the quality of specialized wu cadres , and striving to improve the comprehensive quality of the cadres .
early this year , the people 's armed forces department 's party committee discovered during its investigations and studies at the grassroots level that some cadres with specialized skills are long - term , too long , and concurrently holding official posts , and that they did not place their main energy on armed work .
for this reason , they have adopted the method of training through science and technology by relying on local party schools for training , and have regularly conducted training on specialized military cadres , focusing on resolving the problem of narrow - horiz@@ on business of military cadres .
in connection with the central work , they boldly offered cadres with specialized skills , such as cadres who are competent for their duties , through their work posts , and enhance their ability to serve in their posts .
at the same time , they have actively coordinated with local organizational departments and jointly formulated the " regulations on the appointment of cadres by specialized arms " and clearly stipulated that armed forces ministers must go to the leadership of party committees and no longer hold other posts .
the chinese government has established a mechanism for the adjustment and exchange of cadres with high age , which is not adap@@ ted to the work of armed forces at the grassroots level , and has promptly read@@ justed and perf@@ ected the work method of comrades who are highly competent in comprehensive quality .
not long ago , the new century 's mas@@ ay@@ o@@ shi [ name as transliterated ] , director of the armed forces department , led the militi@@ a technical detachment to innovate on the under@@ water vessel technology , thus filled up a severe domestic situation and was upgraded to the armed forces department of the company .
good intentions must be good at all .
the results of the competition alone are two to two .
if the iranian team 2 - 0 lead , then the bit@@ ter score will be equ@@ alized , and the chinese team will be a bit less .
good will never be good at the end , and it can be said that it is a problem with old things .
the feeling is that the situation is so complicated .
this is indeed a kind of feeling that a government can not affor@@ d to worry about .
however , from today 's competition , it is still like a do@@ g of the race .
sun ji@@ hai said : over the past five years , the chinese government has taken a series of measures to strengthen the administration of state affairs .
this is a sor@@ ry - out result that the iranian team has been forced to settle down , and the reason is that the team will be transferred to a temporary cust@@ o@@ dy .
iran beat the united states in a backward condition .
the second half of the com@@ b also changed the name of " falungong " , but the effect of such activities was not good .
overcome ben@@ evol@@ ence and fail to make the final the best , we must find the root of the problem .
as long as the problems are accurately identified and the problems are correc@@ ted , it is probably not difficult to find .
fe@@ aring that the emergency is a disaster , and taking medical care .
if this happens , it is a bit@@ ter hat@@ red that k@@ ick more mat@@ ches , old problems will still be committed , and the talks will not be expected to be k@@ ic@@ ked .

the hospital has specially equipped a vehicle that can provide temporary support for traffic management , which is needed to provide a temporary emergency service for migrant workers .
this move that benefits the people has benef@@ ited the peasants ' work more than 1@@ 2,000 people .

the first batch of new - type personnel of the army aviation regiment of the pla navy , which has been providing training for rural residents , has become a rare resource with each having its own operational experience .
this reporter recently learned that after six months of experiments , the base has issued the " interim regulations on carrying out the ' program of carrying out ' for the ideological and political education ' " and has covered all small , remote , and directly subordinate units of the base in carrying out ideological and political education .
in order to promote the " outline of ideological and political education , " the base organized forces to conduct a comprehensive and systematic study of the ideological and political education of small , sc@@ attered , and directly administ@@ ered units at the beginning of the year , and influ@@ enced and restricted educational personnel 's cur@@ ti@@ s over the results of their inspection . a preliminary form of a new type of education in the cooperative zone of small , remote , and directly administ@@ ered units was formed .
the specific practice of the cooperative zone is to break down the dem@@ arc@@ ation line between the unit and the unit , and to set up a regiment in a relatively centralized film zone , a regiment - level unit , which has a unified plan for them@@ ed education . the units under different subordinate relationships have taken a study at the same platform or obtained a relatively remote discussion from the departments .
the adoption of such systems as tu@@ mul@@ tu@@ ous competition for posts has played a unified role in the distribution of educational forces , and the unified use of educational hard@@ ware in the region . data collected by various units has been shared and exchanged . it has organized typical circu@@ it reports on the exchange of cadres and officers and soldiers in the study .
each cooperative zone has a dat@@ ab@@ ase on how young people and children can obtain information collection .
on this basis , all the cooperative areas have also established a mechanism for assistance in difficult problems , which has resulted in a collective commercial involving emergency ideological conditions , a system of reporting and assess@@ ing the situation .
director zhang sheng@@ min of the base 's political department told this reporter that the establishment of a political education coordination zone has reduced the waste of educational resources and deepened the educational results .
some political ca@@ reless , fe@@ aring the loss of the officers and men of foreign units , took the initiative to study new knowledge exploring new ways of education .
the officers and men who received education were active in educational contents , afraid of discussing and analyzing the situation in the front of officers and men of a friendly unit .
this kind of bel@@ ong@@ ing and encour@@ agement is supported by the masses .

according to su cheng@@ sen , political commissar of the unit , this is a major move taken by the unit to promote the system of making government affairs public .
it was like this that the party committee of this unit formulated a " long - term plan for supervision at the grassroots level " for strengthening the building of party style and a clean administration , and it required that all matters involving the immediate interests of officers and men and the building of the troops be heard and decided upon after hearing the opinions of officers and men , and that the standards for handling affairs and the procedures for handling affairs will be openly examined and veri@@ fied .

this has sav@@ ed the funds and won the trust of officers and men .
to make things open and fair , we have promoted the formation of good conduct in the grass - roots units .
