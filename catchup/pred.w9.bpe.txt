( selected newspaper and peri@@ od@@ ical ) shanghai : part - time staff and college graduates have become the main force of work
beijing , february 7 ( xinhua ) the shanghai municipal labor and social security bureau ( f@@ s@@ b ) released the new year 's labor price index ( m@@ ou ) for 2006 , which was 120 , 11 more than last year , and the number of original jobs has dropped to 1@@ 80 .
according to an expert of the shanghai municipal labor and social security bureau , the number of hours of employees in shanghai has exceeded 1 million .
according to a report by " zhong@@ guo qing@@ n@@ ian bao , " college graduates and part - time employees are the main components of the contingent of hours workers .
through direct investigation into nearly 8,000 hours of workers , half of the workers are part - time workers , with a ratio of 5@@ 1.@@ 1@@ 31 percent .
the cultural level of the part - time workers is generally relatively high , mainly engaged in work with relatively strong technical skills , such as transl@@ ation and job , and the ratio of part - time workers is as high as 8@@ 1.@@ 7@@ 7 percent , and the number of fit@@ ness classes is 6@@ 1.@@ 66 percent .
high income is an important reason for many people to work in both hours .
it is learned that individual jobs can ear@@ n tens of thousands of yuan per month , and it is also difficult to pursue it , just like the trans@@ lat@@ or , and the monthly income of the working hours can reach more than 2,000 yuan , for example , the number of people who have worked in a part - time manner , such as the gu@@ an@@ ting gu@@ og@@ u@@ ang mi@@ an@@ yi .
to satisfy individual interests and expand their knowledge is also a favor@@ ite job .
for example , in mr. gu , manager of the department of manpower , a company will take several hours a week to handle a business representative 's financial account .
mr ko@@ o considered that the biggest benefits of the work of the company were to make their knowledge more updated and to have opportunities to cover another field , of course , the income of 2000 yuan per month also had a certain lu@@ red influence .
as some hours of employment are low , the employment pattern is flexible and free , and many graduates are gradually favor@@ ing . they are now working in job - seeking .
i did n't want to work for an hour at the beginning , but after several months i did it , i felt it was better than working for the fifth evening of the 9 th north korea .
after gradu@@ ating from college student huang , the job he found was not as satisfactory and finally hung up at a hotel .
i am quite satisfied with my current work , and the environment is also good . i want to do now is to find more things for several hours .
it is learned that the work hours have become the accumul@@ ation of experience for some graduates who are currently working in job search , and their skills have improved their communication skills and enhanced their ability to improve their ability to study and experience .
the employment hours of graduates are mainly concentrated in relatively strong knowledge and technical jobs , such as relatively professional and professional transl@@ ation .
some of the work hours are not high in terms of skills , such as food promo@@ ters , cl@@ en@@ bu@@ ter@@ ol agents , etc. , unemployed workers can be promoted through simple training .
the statistics show that the number of employed people in the hours was 3@@ 90 percent , of which the number of unemployed people in the retail sector was as high as 6@@ 8.@@ 4 percent , and the ratio of cat@@ ering was 5@@ 8.@@ 7@@ 7 percent , and the number of unemployed workers was an important channel for employment .

the report clearly defin@@ es for the first time the united states has made russia 's n@@ ai@@ m@@ i as a new strategic ad@@ versary , especially the so - called china military threat theory , more attention - - - like .
rear admir@@ al peng guang@@ qian , research fellow of the chinese academy of military sciences , said :
what merits attention is that in the " four - year defense review report " officially submitted , us president bush also submitted a draft resolution on the fiscal year 2007 to congress , which includes the defense budget of 4@@ 3@@ 9@@ 3 - billion us dollars .
if the us and the us are to be able to re@@ tali@@ ate against the us military forces in 2007 , the us defense budget will break through the $ 500 billion mark , setting a new record , p@@ ang - him said , adding that this is almost the same as other countries in the world .
peng guang@@ qian said : the us method of fabr@@ icating the threat of other countries reflects the consistent style of destroying enemies and the real purpose of the united states is to win more national defense funds and provide the united states ' huge arms industrial group with more profits .
experts said that compared with the huge military spending of the united states , china 's defense spending is quite limited .
he has participated in the military expert deng hong@@ zhou , who has participated in the drafting of china 's national defense white paper many times , said : since the beginning of the 199@@ 0s , china 's national defense expenditures have increased somewhat , but the proportion of the national defense expenditures in the same period has been on the decline trend .
official data show that compared with 1979 , china 's national defense expenditure accounts for a decline of nearly 10 percent of the total national financial expenditures in the same period .
in 2005 , china 's national defense budget was 24@@ 4.@@ 6@@ 56 - billion yuan , just about one - fourth of the united states , and the per capita national military spending was only about one - 60 percent of the united states , and the per capita military spending was about one - thir@@ ds of the us military .
the us land area is r@@ oughly the same as china 's territory , and the difference in military expenditure is so huge , and in the end , who is the military force that goes beyond the proper defense needs . this is self - evident .
peng guang@@ qian said :
teng jian@@ q@@ un , director of the research department of the china arms control and disarmament association , said that the united states should obj@@ ectively evalu@@ ate china 's military construction , and china 's peaceful development does not mean that china and the united states will become military ri@@ vals in the future .
the " 2004 china national defense " white paper said that china firmly takes the road of peaceful development and practices a defensive national defense policy .
china has never been in a state of war or will not pose a threat to any country .
so far , china has not established military bases in any other country , nor has it sent troops to other countries , and the united states has been in the world with over 100 military bases , and only has it deployed in asia , more than 100,000 people .
zhu feng , professor at the beijing university international relations institute , said : china and the united states should increase communication and exchanges through established channels , enhance mutual understanding and trust , and comprehensively promote the constructive and cooperative relations between china and the united states in the new century so as to jointly promote the maintenance of world peace and development .

hamas seeks new cabinet to break through
ram@@ al@@ lah , february 9 ( xinhua ) hamas has decided to form a cabinet to break through the palestinian government
xinhua news agency , wang hao ,
palestinian islamic resistance movement ( hamas ) won the election of the legislative yuan , how to draw up the new government blueprint has become the focus of world attention .
what new policies hamas will pursue will directly affect the peace process 's policy orientation in the next step .
at the same time , the bo@@ y@@ co@@ tt attitude of the united states and israel has added vari@@ ables to the future of the hamas government .
at present , all sides of palestine are stepping up consultations to discuss the issue of forming a cabinet , which involves difficulties and sensitive points that are currently facing the future development of the situation .
who will the premier post spend ?
after hamas won the right to form a cabinet , people outside the world are worried that hamas may have differences with the current supreme leader ab@@ b@@ as .
moreover , hamas leader mar@@ sh@@ al , who is visiting egypt , stressed that the new palestinian government , which was formed by hamas , would not recognize israel , and this hard - line signal also aggrav@@ ated international concern .
the united states and israel have explicitly expressed that they do not accept a hamas government which is in power , and have threatened to suspend economic aid to palestine and to hand taxes to the palestinians .
however , this does not hin@@ der hamas from making flexible strategic adjustments , and it is a policy to choose an independent person .
it is reported that in order to obtain international recognition as the greatest possible , hamas , who gathered in egypt , recently , decided to elect an independent person , j@@ ah@@ ar@@ i , chairman of the board of directors of the sh@@ al@@ an islamic university , to be the new prime minister .
this move has not yet been responded by the relevant parties .
palestinian analysts , hos@@ se@@ in , said that no matter who the premier 's office is taking place , the most crucial thing is that the prime minister should do his best to weak@@ en hamas 's hard - line fla@@ v@@ or , and only in this way can the success of forming a cabinet be guaranteed .
how to alloc@@ ate power ( sub@@ head )
internal , the biggest challenge facing hamas in forming a cabinet is to lack sufficient experience in governance .
the palestinian newspaper " sun@@ sh@@ ine " carried an analysis saying that hamas , through social welfare projects , has gathered around the people , but lacks experience in governance and is closely related to the palestinian national liberation movement ( fat@@ ah ) , which has gained experience in governance .
hamas proposed establishing political relations with fat@@ ah after the election , and jointly formed a national coalition government , but fat@@ ah has not given a positive response to this .
at present , there is no question of whether or not to join the cabinet , and each faction advocates taking part in the new government , so that they can accomplish something , while the other faction ref@@ uses to invite hamas , and is willing to act as a pas@@ sive opposition in the legislative yuan .
the source pointed out that under ab@@ b@@ as 's advice , fat@@ ah is gradually incl@@ ined to join the new government .
even so , hamas and fat@@ ah will also discuss the distribution of cabinet positions .
in addition , another way is to set up a legislative committee , leaving the party 's subordinate cabinet .
it was reported that hamas also designed a clean expert - type government , but the specific list is unknown .
in view of the attitude of the united states and israel , the technical expert - type government is also not negl@@ ig@@ ent to form a cabinet to reduce external pressure .
according to the basic law of palestine , the new legislative council has nom@@ inated the premier and formed a cabinet after taking office on 16 march .
what course the armed forces should follow ?
the weapons in hamas 's hands are another thor@@ ny issue facing the formation of a new government .
the attitude of the united states and israel is very hard - line , and they firmly demand hamas to abandon violence and to refuse to take part in politics .
hamas leader mar@@ sh@@ al said on 9 november that armed resistance is a strategic choice of the organization .
the armed issue actually includes the legi@@ tim@@ acy of weapons and the ownership of armed forces .
hamas was elected the first largest party in the legislative yuan through democratic and free means , and its subordinate armed factions were not like q@@ ang@@ l@@ uan brigade .
hamas once proposed to unify all armed forces into the palestinian national authority , but did not have a broad response , and it was also attacked by the palestinian islamic ji@@ had organization ( j@@ ah@@ med ) .
palestine currently has more than 6@@ 0,000 security personnel , and the overwhelming majority of the security personnel are from the fat@@ ah camp .
moreover , fat@@ ah also has some milit@@ ant factions that are sl@@ ack in organization relations , such as the mar@@ tial law of the marty@@ rs brigade of ak@@ sa , the law - based eag@@ le , etc.
hamas , who is responsible for forming a cabinet , must hold talks with ab@@ b@@ as on how to manage these armed forces that are in their own hands and ration@@ ally distribu@@ te security management powers .
according to local media reports , ab@@ b@@ as inten@@ ds to be in charge of security and intelligence units , while the police and civil air defense organizations are under the control of the interior ministry of the new government .
however , all parties are still holding consultations on this sensitive issue , and no new article has yet to be made .

the du@@ ling@@ winter games opened its first stimul@@ ant scand@@ al on 16 february , and the os@@ lo faction was found to have used banned drugs cards .
the international olympic committee announced the next day that it had sent le@@ op@@ ov@@ es out of the winter olympic games , and she had won two winter second women 's 15 km per woman 's silver med@@ als at this winter olympic games .
the international winter bi@@ ath@@ n@@ es@@ ian alliance made a decision on the issue of the two years of the p@@ aw@@ n .
the international olympic committee has always stipulated that athletes have been found using stimul@@ ant in the olympic games and will be dis@@ qualified from participating in the games .
however , according to italian law , the s@@ porting event and the use of stimul@@ ant is a criminal act , and the judiciary has the right to directly arrest and investigate the use of stimul@@ ant athletes , and the people who try to test the law are still facing im@@ prison terms ranging from three months to three years .
last december , the international olympic committee and the italian government , after a year of years of years of sle@@ eping , finally reached an agreement , both sides agreed to conduct negotiations on the issue of athletes using the s@@ port stimul@@ ant in accordance with the italian law during the winter olympic games .
with the unremitting efforts of the international olympic committee , italy made a four - day concession before the opening of the winter olympic games , pled@@ ging that the police would not go to the olympic village to conduct sear@@ ches for athletes . however , the young athletes who are in the field of medicine will still receive an investigation by the italian procuratorial organs .
it is reported that the italian government over@@ mon@@ itors the du@@ ling@@ winter olympic association officials , pe@@ ter k@@ an@@ tor , has handed over the p@@ esti@@ ci@@ de to the du@@ tch procuratorial organ .
however , the international olympic committee and the p@@ is@@ an@@ an himself have not confirmed this .

he has served as a member of the world anti - d@@ oping agency for many years , and chinese sports official shi k@@ ang@@ cheng believes that once he is sent to visit china , this matter will eventually be un@@ settled .
shi said that the international olympic committee and the italian government have made a lot of efforts to fight stimul@@ ant in the winter olympic games , and even the italian procuratorial authorities have really interven@@ ed in this matter , it is hard to say .
according to the previous practice of italy in using stimul@@ ant events , the number of cases that the banned people had received is only a two years ' imprisonment and a period of punishment .
therefore , p@@ el@@ e , a senior reporter of the italian ant@@ on@@ io sam@@ ar@@ an@@ o , said that the possibility of sending a war@@ lor@@ d into a prison is very small , and most of the cases are fine .
pi@@ er@@ re also said that although the italian court could try the case , the italian police could not send out le@@ op@@ t@@ ov@@ a to other countries for execution .
if a le@@ op@@ ard ref@@ uses to accept the verdic@@ t , italy will also take it out .
