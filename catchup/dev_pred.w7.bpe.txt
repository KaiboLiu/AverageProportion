( selected newspaper coll@@ ections ) shanghai : part - time personnel and college graduates become the main job of an hour
beijing , february 7 ( xinhua ) the shanghai municipal labor and social security bureau announced on the 6@@ th that the wage index for the latest hour of work in 2006 was broad@@ ly determined , up 11 points from the previous increase of 11 , and the salary of the original position was also lowered .
according to the estim@@ ation of relevant experts of the shanghai municipal bureau of labor and social security , currently more than 1 million people in shanghai have worked in an hour .
according to a report in china youth daily , the number of graduates and part - time workers of institutions of higher learning is the main component of the work@@ force of an hour .
through the investigation of the nearly 8,000 hours of work , over half of the staff are part - time personnel , and the proportion is 5@@ 1.@@ 1 percent .
the cultural level of part - time labor@@ ers is generally higher , and they are mainly engaged in the work of relatively technical skills , such as transl@@ ation and type jobs , as high as 8@@ 1.@@ 77 percent , and physical fit@@ ness as 6@@ 1.@@ 6 percent .
high income is the result of many people engaging in hours of work and part - time jobs .
it is understood that the monthly income of individual jobs can reach tens of thousands yuan , and it will be hard to make , just like trans@@ lat@@ or , the monthly income of an hour of work can reach more than 2,000 yuan , such as part - time financial celebr@@ ity si@@ r@@ ens .
to satisfy the needs of individuals and expand their knowledge , they are also the favor@@ ite of job workers for hours .
for example , when a company is the manager of the human resources department , mr. gu will take several hours to handle the matter of a foreign representative office .
mr ko@@ o said the biggest benefit from part - time jobs was to constantly upgrade and have the opportunity to involve another area . of course , the monthly salary of 2000 yuan was also very low .
as some of the h@@ our@@ ly jobs are low , the employment pattern is flexible and free , and many graduates who are seeking jobs are gradually looking for jobs , 14 % of the h@@ ire workers are senior secondary school graduates in the last three years .
i did not want to work for an hour at the beginning , but i did it a few months later , i felt it was better than the working hours of 9 : 00 p@@ .@@ m .
after gradu@@ ating from college student huang , he did not find his job as perfect as he had expected . he finally hung the name of a guesthouse and used a pi@@ an@@ o to play a background music .
i 'm quite satisfied with my work now , i am 100 yuan per hour , and the environment is good . i am now doing more work for several hours .
it is understood that an hour - long job worker has become a work experience accumulated by some graduates who are seeking jobs , and the communication skills have increased the social experience of the society .
the graduates are mainly concentrated in the knowledge and skilled fields , and the job is not only in the professional and professional sectors but also in the industry .
some of the job opportunities are not high , such as the food marketing staff and the cargo personnel , etc. , after simple training , the unemployed personnel can take up their jobs .
statistics show that among the employees in the work@@ place , 3@@ 9.@@ 9 percent of the unemployed were originally unemployed , of which the proportion of the retail unemployed personnel was 6@@ 8.@@ 44 percent , and the proportion of cat@@ ering was 5@@ 8.@@ 77 percent , an hour of labor was unemployment .

the 92 - page report will use three par@@ agr@@ ap@@ h@@ s to exp@@ ound the issue of china 's military power and the us countermeasures it should take , and the report directly men@@ tions china 's strong points or its presence in china .
the research fellow yao yun@@ zhu , a resear@@ cher at the world military research department of the chinese academy of military sciences , said that although the us senior officials have repeatedly expressed similar views , this is the first time in the drafting of the strategic report on national defense , china is the emerging power that is most likely to challenge the united states with military force .
this report clearly stated for the first time that russia and india are newly emerging strategic ad@@ vers@@ aries , especially the so - called enc@@ ir@@ cl@@ ement of china 's military threat , has given more attention .
peng guang@@ qian , a resear@@ cher at the chinese academy of military sciences , said :
it is no@@ te@@ worthy that in the " four - year defense assessment report " formally submitted , the us president bush also made a report to congress on the fiscal year 2007 budget , which included the defense budget of 4@@ 3@@ 9.@@ 3 - billion us dollars .
if plus the us - led military action in iraq and afghanistan ,
peng guang@@ qian said : the us specul@@ ation on the threat of other countries reflects the pentagon 's desire to create enemy forces . its real purpose is to win more support from the national defense budget and provide the us military industrial with a large amount of money .
experts said that compared with the huge military spending of the united states , china 's defense expenditures are quite limited .
he has repeatedly participated in the research and development of the chinese national defense white paper , saying that since the 1990 s , with economic development , china 's national defense expenditures have increased , but this accounted for more than half of the total national financial expenditures in the same period .
official data show that compared with 1979 , china 's defense spending accounts for more than 10 percent of the total expenditures of the state for the same period in 2004 .
china 's defense expenditures in 2005 are 24@@ 4.@@ 6@@ 56 billion yuan , only equivalent to about one - fourth of the united states ' per capita military spending , which is only about one - sixth of that of the united states , and the per capita military spending is about one - thir@@ ds of that of the us military .
the united states ' territorial area is r@@ oughly the same as china 's territory , but the difference in military spending is so huge . who exactly is the military power exceeding the normal defense needs is something that is self - evident .
peng guang@@ qian said :
the director of the research department of the china arms control and disarmament association , teng jian@@ q@@ un , said that the us side should obj@@ ectively assess china 's military construction situation and that china 's peaceful development does not mean that china and the united states will become military ad@@ vers@@ aries in the future .
the " 2004 china 's national defense " white paper said that china firmly takes the road of peaceful development and practices a defensive national defense policy .
china did not have its own future and would not pose a threat to any country .
so far , china has not established any military bases in any other countries , nor has it sent any troops or men to other countries , while the united states has over 100 military bases overseas , and the united states has deployed troops in asia alone .
professor zhu feng of the international relations college of beijing university said that china and the united states should increase communication and exchanges through the established channels , enhance understanding and mutual trust , and comprehensively promote the constructive and cooperative relations between china and the united states in the new century and jointly promote the maintenance of world peace and development .

( international observation ) hamas sets up cabinet to seek breakthroughs
ram@@ al@@ lah , february 9 ( xinhua ) the hamas formed a cabinet to seek a breakthrough
xinhua news agency , beijing , march 27 ,
the palestinian islamic resistance movement ( hamas ) won the legislative elections , how to draw a blueprint for the new government has become a major issue of concern in the world at present .
what kind of new policy will hamas adopt directly influence the next step of the corresponding policy orientation of the parties concerned in the peace process .
at the same time , the united states and israel 's bo@@ y@@ co@@ tt has added vari@@ ables to the future of the hamas government .
at present , all parties in palestine are stepping up their consultations , and they are discussing the difficulties and sensitive points of the cabinet that may affect the future development of the situation .
the post of prime minister comes down and which family is in a state of affairs
after hamas obtained the right to form a cabinet , some people outside the world worried that prime minister hamas might have a difference between the present top leader ab@@ b@@ as .
in addition , hamas leader ma@@ h@@ m@@ oud , who is visiting egypt , stressed that the new palestinian government formed by hamas will not recognize israel . this tough signal has also aggrav@@ ated international worries .
the united states and israel have clearly indicated that they will not accept a hamas government that has the real power , and they will use this as a threat to hal@@ t economic aid to palestine and pass taxes to palestine .
however , this does not prevent hamas from making flexible strategic adjustments and selecting the independent people to be a compromise policy .
according to reports , to obtain international recognition as much as possible , the hamas leaders at home and abroad who gathered in egypt recently decided to elect an independent person at home and abroad j@@ am@@ al ho ha@@ u - ali as the new prime minister .
this move has not received any response from the parties concerned .
palestinian analysts , hos@@ se@@ in , said that no matter who the prime minister 's position comes , the most crucial thing is that the candidate for the prime minister should try as much as possible to play down the hard@@ lin@@ col@@ n hu@@ e of hamas , and only thus can the success of forming the cabinet be guaranteed .
how to alloc@@ ate power
internal affairs are the most serious challenge facing the hamas cabinet .
the palestinian newspaper " ching pao " analyzed that hamas , through social welfare projects , gathered together to show its popul@@ arity , but in governing it lacks experience and is closely related to the palestinian people 's liberation movement , which has the experience in governance .
hamas proposed a new government with fat@@ ah after the election , in which it jointly formed a national coalition government , but fat@@ ah has not given a positive response to this .
at present , there are no different opinions on whether or not to be elected in the cabinet , and one faction advocates participating in the new government , thus doing something to accomplish . the other faction ref@@ uses to invite hamas to make a th@@ ough@@ tful opposition to the legislative yuan .
according to the source , after ab@@ b@@ as persu@@ aded him , fat@@ ah gradually incl@@ ines toward joining the new government .
even so , hamas and fat@@ ah will also hold consultations on the distribution of cabinet posts .
in addition , another way is to separate taiwan from the party 's cabinet members outside the framework of the legislative yuan .
it is reported that hamas also designed a clear - headed expert - type government , but the specific list is un@@ aware .
in view of the attitude of the united states and israel , the technology - based government is also indis@@ pensable to forming a cabinet to ease external pressure .
according to the provisions of the " basic law " of palestine , after the new legislative council was s@@ wor@@ n in on 16 june , the work of nom@@ in@@ ating the prime minister and forming the cabinet will be completed within three to five weeks .
how will armed forces follow ?
the weapons in hamas are another challenge facing the formation of a new government .
the united states and israel have adopted a very tough attitude , resolutely demanding that hamas abandon violence and rej@@ ect its armed intervention in politics .
hamas leader ma@@ sh@@ al stressed on 9 april that armed resistance is the core of the organization 's strategies .
the armed forces issue in fact includes the leg@@ ality of weapons and the management of the armed forces at the two levels .
hamas won the election by means of democracy and freedom , and its first - largest party was recognized internationally , making its subordinate armed faction b@@ hu@@ tan ju@@ an brig@@ it@@ te similarly leg@@ alized .
hamas once proposed to re@@ unite all factions into a palestinian national authority and the people 's army did not get a widespread response , but it was also strongly opposed by the palestinian islamic ji@@ had ( j@@ ha@@ f@@ d ) .
palestine now has more than 6@@ 0,000 security personnel , and the overwhelming majority of them come from the fat@@ ah camp .
moreover , fat@@ ah also has some subordinate armed forces factions that have lo@@ ose ties , such as al-@@ aq@@ sa marty@@ rs brigade , which is known as the haw@@ k@@ ish haw@@ k .
hamas , which is responsible for forming the cabinet , must have a thorough discussion with ab@@ b@@ as on how to manage these armed forces that are all in power and reason@@ ably alloc@@ ate security management powers .
according to local media reports , ab@@ b@@ as inten@@ ds to be in charge of security and intelligence forces , police , civil defense , and other organizations , and the new government will be under the administration of the interior ministry .
however , the parties are still holding consultations on this sensitive issue , and so far there has been no further comment on it .

he said the south african government hopes to reduce the crime rate to zero and to fight every criminal gang in south africa .
since 2006 , four chinese citizens have been in south africa one after another , and the chinese world has expressed its extensive concern about this .
the chinese foreign ministry has made representations with the south african side on this issue and reminded chinese citizens in south africa to further enhance their awareness of security and prevention , and the overseas chinese to strengthen their unity and friendship and cooperate with the police in cracking down on criminal activities .
we told the families of the victims the most sincere sympathy and m@@ our@@ ning .
" we are satisfied with this , " said fu , who is also a member of the chinese people 's political consultative conference ( cppcc ) central committee , who is also a member of the central committee of the cpc central committee , and who is also a member of the central committee of the cpc central committee political bureau .
according to the chinese embassy in south africa , the south african police have successfully cracked the case of chen jian@@ qing , chinese woman , killed in south africa on 5 february . a suspect has been arrested .
at present , the police are hun@@ ting another suspect .
according to the south african embassy in china , the number of criminals suspected of shooting hong kong businessmen was arrested by south african police in january this year , and the money and property of the victims have been recovered .
on the possibility of the killing of chinese citizens , fu k@@ ang@@ ning said that these incidents indeed had a bu@@ m@@ p in the hearts of the two countries ' trade and other areas .
the tourism commissioner of the south african embassy , mr ben@@ jam@@ in b@@ ak@@ i , said the embassy had sent more than 2,000 chinese tourists to south africa in the first 15 days of this year .
according to official statistics from china , south africa has maintained a position of china 's largest trading partner in africa in 2005 .
the bilateral trade volume reached $ 7.@@ 27 billion , an increase of 2@@ 3.@@ 0 percent over the previous year .
however , people in the tourism industry believe that the successive cases of chinese citizens being killed in 2004 have had a significant impact on the number of chinese tourists visiting south africa .
according to statistics from the south african tourism bureau , the number of chinese tourists going to south africa in the first half of 2005 was 20@@ 3@@ 31 , a decrease of 14.@@ 99 percent compared with the same period last year .
currently , there are 200,000 chinese living in south africa , and there are about 200,000 people in the towns and villages in south africa .
analysts here believe that the gap between rich and poor in south africa 's society is wide , the unemployment rate is high , and there is a flood of guns , and there is no deterr@@ ent force against death , so the crime rate remains high .
since many chinese do not understand english , their bodies and families have cash , they are more pr@@ one to become the targets of criminals seeking financial attacks .

the international olympic committee announced the following day that sending a le@@ af to the olympic games had been ex@@ clud@@ ed from the winter olympics . she won two gold med@@ als for the women 's 15 km individual competition in the winter olympics .
the two - day international winter season alliance made a decision to impose a ban on the two - year ten@@ nis .
the international olympic committee has all along stipulated that athletes who have been found using stimul@@ ants in the olympic games will be canc@@ elled and be depriv@@ ed of their quali@@ fication for the competition , but they will not be subject to legal sanctions .
however , according to italian law , the carrying and use of stimul@@ ants by athletes is a criminal act , and the judiciary has the right to directly arrest and investigate the athletes who use stimul@@ ants and def@@ y the law .
last december , the international olympic committee and the italian government , after a year of intense debate over the prices of car@@ ved oil and raw materials , finally reached an agreement . both sides agreed to handle the issue of che@@ ating on the use of stimul@@ ant by athletes during the current winter olympics according to italian law .

he has worked in the world anti - d@@ oping agency for many years , chinese sports officials shi k@@ ang@@ cheng maintained that once a child is sent back to china , this matter will eventually be un@@ settled .
shi said that the international olympic committee and the italian government have made positive efforts to deal with the issue of anti - stimul@@ ant for winter olympics , and even if the italian procuratorial organs have really interven@@ ed in the matter , the result is also very difficult .
according to the previous practice of italy 's pen@@ alties for the use of stimul@@ ants against its athletes , the most severe punishment given by the offenders is only two years of imprisonment and the two years of imprisonment were executed .
therefore , senior italian correspon@@ dent pe@@ ter@@ ri@@ e said that sending li@@ pp@@ a to prison is likely to be th@@ ic@@ kn@@ ess and several of them are the ones who have been fined .
pi@@ er@@ re also said that although the italian court could hold a abs@@ ence trial , the italian police could not send the li@@ ven@@ s back to the country and serve the sentence .
if a le@@ on@@ id ref@@ uses to accept the ruling , the italian side will not take her up .
