however , in view of the relatively great pressure of appreciation of the renminbi , china will mainly use its own foreign exchange funds to make overseas investment .
the state will continue to provide foreign exchange for foreign investment in the current situation .

chen shui - bian secre@@ tly approved the election of the " judicial yuan " in taiwan , denied and demanded an explanation .
chin@@ ane@@ ws , july 30 chen shui - bian 's judicial personnel on the island have questi@@ oned the attempt of taiwan 's leaders to get involved in the election .
the taiwan authorities ' administrative affairs have been highly administ@@ ered by the authorities of the chu@@ ku@@ ang judicial yuan , on the same day , said that the current performance of the judges on the island is not in line with chen shui - bian 's remarks and demands that chen shui - bian give an explanation .
according to a report in taiwan 's " zhu@@ o pao , " chen shui - bian questi@@ oned the judge 's ro@@ tary procur@@ ator or investig@@ ator on 30 june , and because of political or election considerations , he even attempted to influence the election activities of the candidates of various parties . he said he hoped that this phenomenon would not exist in taiwan , but it might be very difficult .
in response to chen shui - bian 's question , the director of the taiwan judicial yuan yue - sheng did not respond to the call of secretary general , the cl@@ ay group , the higher golden bel@@ ly represents the judicial organs ' voice .
gao jin@@ zhi said : taiwan 's basic law and the code of judges have all clearly declared that judges should go beyond the party and should not take part in party activities , nor should they help them . judges are very cautious in observing related constr@@ aints , and the court believes that judges are very good at doing the work .
gao jin@@ zhi pointed out that the upper class in kaohsiung city is dec@@ i@@ ph@@ ered by judges zhang cheng@@ xi a few years ago to take part in the k@@ ab@@ a school course , that is , because of the political party 's nature of the relevant courses , the self - discipline committee formed by judges is given the degree of discipline .
zhang sheng@@ xi once wanted to take part in the dpp 's affairs , because he took the position to run for the election , and finally decided to give up .
gao jin@@ zhi said that if the trial of a case is conducted by a certain case , then the corruption case cannot be pr@@ on@@ ounced according to the results of the judgment alone , then the judge should not have political intentions .
germany to lower thre@@ sh@@ old for professional personnel
the reporter learned from the " shanghai five " that the chinese academy of social sciences has recently issued a " report on the implementation of the scientific development concept . "
german minister of education and scientific research sch@@ u@@ ess@@ el said a few days ago that germany should reduce the restrictions on the introduction of foreign professionals in the " law " and increase the number of foreign professionals to be brought in by foreign countries .
according to the o@@ ec@@ d report , germany 's population of the 15 - 64 years old will decline year by year .
if there is no sufficient immigration , then the labor force in germany will be 6@@ 6.@@ 0 percent less than the present .
however , the german federation of employers and the german engine@@ ers association have reported that the current labor market in germany is a professional engine@@ er , and there is a big increase in the professional personnel of the engine@@ ers .
the german labor bureau reported that in may this year , the german labor market 's total supply of engine@@ ers was 1.@@ 27 million people , and the technical personnel were suppl@@ ied to 9@@ 60 people .
in order to protect the employment of their own people , germany has set a higher thre@@ sh@@ old for introducing foreign talents .
the german " su@@ pr@@ a law " stipulates that the professional personnel of the non - eu countries are not in germany , which is lower than 8@@ 50,000 eur@@ os , otherwise they cannot be allowed to work in germany or to stay in germany .
sha@@ wan suggested that the quota be lowered to the edge of euro .
do not super@@ sti@@ ti@@ ously use the law ;
the draft resolution on the " law@@ yer law " submitted to the npc standing committee for examination recently stipulates that the law , which has been engaged in legal research and teaching , and has its own advanced level or similar professional level , and that it is not necessary to apply for a law@@ yer 's practi@@ sing . it can be submitted to the lawyers ' administrative department of the state council for examination and approval .
( signed on 28 june , " zhong@@ guo zhu@@ o@@ yi " )
there are also some cl@@ ues in the legal field , such as the theoretical field and the pur@@ i@@ fication of the fac@@ ade , which mainly includes teaching and research work , and other such mal@@ practices , and most of them are engaged in legal consultation service for the latter 's legal affairs , such as legal consultancy services , etc.
for a long time , the legal field has been well - known and the fac@@ ul@@ ty of affairs , such as the ' cl@@ en@@ bu@@ ter@@ ol ' of the cultural rel@@ ics , the theoretical circle believes that the real estate is not necessary for the domain of affairs , but only the mechan@@ ized form@@ ists , while the fac@@ ul@@ ty actually aff@@ ili@@ ated with the theoretical sector 's critic@@ isms are not guided by the practice of theory .
with regard to such differences in division of labor , the law can do so , but it is not a support for any party .
however , the current state of affairs of the lawyers ' law has obj@@ ectively recognized the legal status of the legal domain , which is higher than the legal status of the legal system .
in fact , some people engaged in the legal system , such as international law enforcement , have purely theoretical research and teaching , and their theoretical penetr@@ ation is similar to that of legal practice .
in this way , the use of law@@ yer is undoubtedly a legal and legal enti@@ ty in confu@@ sion .
the super@@ sti@@ tion in the theoretical field of the theory is not only not con@@ fined to these , such as the experts ' proof that they often affect or even rej@@ ect the court 's verdic@@ t , but also is the direct expression of this super@@ sti@@ tion .
and encourage chinese - funded vessels to display their vessels
this reporter learned from feng li@@ da
from the briefing held by the state council , it was learned that beginning 1 july this year , china will implement the special case of international shipping vessels ' special registration policy , encourage the foreign - funded vessels that have been ho@@ ist@@ ed to register themselves with china , and obtain the prc 's sovereignty and territorial integrity .
in order to further promote the healthy development of china 's maritime industry and strengthen the state 's ro@@ t@@ ational ro@@ tation , it is necessary to set up a large number of ships that have registered abroad and ho@@ ist@@ ed foreign flag operations . the ministry of communications recently issued a " circular on the implementation of the special registration policy for china - funded international shipping vessels , " which clearly provides that they enjoy the conditions and procedures for applying for special cases , and that they are in line with the requirements of the
the ship may choose shanghai 's xing@@ wu port as a ship to register with the ship .
british lower terror attack on its troops
the reporter learned from the pla daily news conference on 5 july in london that
british government uses hor@@ se - pow@@ ered attack on the top level to the serious level of the state , which indicates that british terrorist attacks will not occur soon , but the attacks are still extremely per@@ ple@@ xing .
at present , the british police have shif@@ ted the scope of investigation to india and australia .
since the eight suspects arrested were arrested in the medical system , the government will conduct a comprehensive investigation into the work of migrant workers from the medical system .
it is reported that there are nearly 1,000 employees working in the public health care system in britain who have obtained medical qualifications overseas .
the prime minister also demanded that the high - tech immigration be investigated to determine the background of high - tech immigration , and that employers or related organizations be provided with information on the background .
let 's get a lot of business .
the tourism plan is to relax the efforts to clear up the leg@@ s , to the maximum extent , to the extent that they enjoy natural and social civilization .
however , many people are en@@ counter this kind of situation .
whether it is a car or a train , the train always needs to be hit by a small business@@ man and a few die - hard r@@ ings without a license .
it is not selling fl@@ ow@@ er@@ po@@ ts , but a magazine selling them , and many other newspapers and peri@@ o@@ dic@@ als have not been able to tell them about the food , the products , or even the false name of the license .
if you do n't accept , he can ch@@ ase you several hundred meters , and if you do n't succeed , then you will become a ben@@ evol@@ ent .
in some cases , there are also many kinds of mis@@ ery .
without entering the gate , there are people who have come to know about the products of tourism and little le@@ ather products .
after entering the door , this situation will be even more , and then y@@ a@@ xing will be re@@ bu@@ f@@ fed and so@@ ared .
some media reports said that many foreign tourists visiting xian are paying close attention to the imper@@ ial mon@@ uments in xian , but they do not have any doubt about allowing the du@@ st@@ y pe@@ d@@ d@@ d@@ lers to sell their products .
including the air - condi@@ tioning system , which includes the wind , the wind , the wind , the surface , and the se@@ ed area , should be orderly , civilized , qu@@ iet , and harmonious , and give a broad - min@@ de@@ dness environment .
the freedom of the business is so sti@@ r@@ red that it is not easy to tell , and obj@@ ectively it under@@ mines these public order , and has formed the pollution and environmental pollution , and at the same time it provides a platform for the management of the business .
what is important is that these kinds of sil@@ k f@@ ans are the window for the construction of local spiritual civilization , and the harm is not only the image issue but also the impact on the local economic development .
just think , if you want to make a big tourism industry , you use this kind of un@@ told tourist environment to gre@@ et the northern part of south - bound tourists , who is willing to come , who will dare to come ?
how did your tourism economy achieve economic results ?
with the arrival of the peak tourism season , the number of tourists from the northern part of the earth and the north should be considered a civilized tourist environment .
not the market , the operation of small - sized business haw@@ kers should be standardized , and the operation without a license should be resolutely abol@@ ished , and illegal activities should be resolutely cracked down on .
a civilized and orderly environment can make me happy and feel happy and per@@ sever@@ ed .
in a word , do n't let the business go .
the ' falungong ' has made a contribution to the development of the western region .
in dong@@ cheng district , beijing , there are more than 100 kinds of electronic products , such as power supply , and so on , which are re@@ im@@ bur@@ sed by the 12 households .
( " xin@@ jing bao " on 10 july )
i am proud of the improvement in the livelihood of these families , but i have never taken the initiative to back the imper@@ ial no@@ tary formul@@ a , and i have also used this method to re@@ pay them .
zhang li@@ q@@ un , deputy director of the office of ji@@ ao@@ tong district office , said that in view of such problems as che@@ ating , encouraging the initiative to re@@ pay , is a role model for other low - protection households .
if this model is to encourage other low - income insur@@ g@@ ents to extr@@ icate themselves from their difficulties , it is indeed worth advocating , and if it wants to use this as a pretext , those who have been che@@ ating for a long time will have little bit of help .
in terms of differ@@ enti@@ ation and clean@@ ing up of low - cost households , the law is more dependent on .
the departments concerned should strengthen the work of providing low - income households with the following duties : if timely report family members and income changes , report on the employment situation , receive regular re@@ examination , and so on , and the departments concerned should step up supervision and inspection .
after all , it is only a long - term plan to re@@ treat from the conventional method .
the streets have given a re@@ war@@ ding force to the families whose policies are bur@@ ied .
as a first - level government organization , the spending of streets is borne by the financial appropri@@ ation .
and the tax@@ pay@@ er 's money should not be used ?
on the one hand , with@@ drawing from the low - insurance family has already possess@@ ed a certain degree of self - suffici@@ ency , while on the other hand , the personnel applying for low - insurance are not still there ?
the government 's financial appropri@@ ation , which is called a life - saving money , should be delivered in a snow - cap@@ ped manner , instead of adding flowers to the br@@ oc@@ ade .
liu said that the service providers are more interested in this .
on 10 july , the first nationwide poll of the public moved the new towns , which had been directly selected by the public , liu xia@@ yi , the fourth time after he took office , received democratic scre@@ ening , with a high rate of 9@@ 7.@@ 6 percent .
at the press conference held by liu di@@ an@@ yi , liu di@@ an@@ yi defined himself as a mobile service provid@@ er .
( yesterday , " xin@@ jing bao " )
liu li@@ an@@ yi 's ' br@@ ain@@ stor@@ ming service ' may be more difficult than some cadres who have a system of cadres , but it is more true that they have a certain hand .
the appointment system is the biggest among the public 's candidates , which is mainly composed of ordinary party members , who have the power source , and the latter is mainly appointed by higher - level organizations , while the direction of the source of power has determined that the former must give top priority to the people .
who is responsible for the source of power and the person who is responsible is the fundamental factor determining how the elected leader will carry out his work .
some people doubt that such a kind of democracy is like a democratic show .
my viewpoint is that there is such a way of democracy , which is even better than that .
in consideration of the historical and current situation of the building of democracy at the basic level in china , i think that the election of the right to the right to the public is a major breakthrough , and that is an important component of this , which is not something to be under@@ estimated in promoting the building of democratic politics at the grassroots level .
india is expected to select the first female president to be elected , and the female voters hope to increase their status , the report said .

p@@ ach@@ i is the first female presidential candidate in the indian history . if she is elected , she will become the first female president in india .
p@@ ach@@ i is a presidential candidate of the ruling national congress party , while sh@@ ev@@ ard@@ k@@ at@@ r@@ it comes from the opposition party 's people 's party .
since the national congress party holds a dominant position in the presidential election , the media and the public have been secre@@ tly cl@@ inging to the election , and the possibility of being elected is quite large .
the 72 - year - old pal@@ i state female governor j@@ a@@ than al-@@ q@@ as@@ a@@ har@@ a .
she zhu@@ o , a law@@ yer , has a rich experience in the parliament , and has been a member of the parliament during her term as the governor of the state of ram@@ a@@ j@@ ah .
she also worked for social welfare , and was a result of many cultural education and social welfare organizations .
analysts pointed out that the reason for p@@ el@@ i@@ ay becoming a candidate is because she has always been a leader of the indian national congress party , s@@ onia g@@ and@@ hi .
in india , the g@@ and@@ an family has long controlled the ruling national congress party .
p@@ ach@@ ang was given a support by a large number of female voters , and women voters believed that p@@ ach@@ u@@ ya would be a serious discrimination of women 's concept in india , thus enhancing the status of women .
the constitution stipulates that india is a state under the federal system , and the head of state and the head of state in the name of the president shall not represent any party , and more symbol@@ ic .

the us department of defense re@@ considered the plan to cut troops in europe
us defense department officials said on 23 march that due to the changes in the iraqi war and the world situation , the us department of defense is re@@ considering the possibility of reducing the number of us troops stationed in europe by about half .
the us media quoted an official from the us department of defense , saying that because the iraq war is still going on and the us - russian and iranian relations have wor@@ sen@@ ed , the defense department has raised doubts about the feasibility of reducing the european military deployment plan .

the three functions of modern military uni@@ forms
first , the identification function .
different countries ' armed forces have different military branches and their important military indic@@ ators .
in the world , the number of troops in more than 100 countries has increased by a large margin , but the use of military uni@@ forms is basically the same .
second , symbol@@ ic functions .
to a certain extent , military uni@@ form@@ ity is not only a national spiritual outlook but also a reflection of the national army 's combat capability .
in the dres@@ sing of the first - class military uni@@ forms , the military uni@@ forms of the military uni@@ form group are most capable of showing the military 's power in the most in@@ stant , and they are the gi@@ ft of the a@@ es@@ the@@ tic view .
third , the protection function .
with the rapid development of new and high - tech weaponry , the comprehensive protection capability of new - type operational training uni@@ forms has enabled military uni@@ forms to have anti@@ trust , reconnaissance , and anti - chemical warfare against radi@@ ation radi@@ ation , and to warm up the cur@@ tain of the cur@@ tain and the ro@@ tten ro@@ tten ro@@ ar , and have become the most important issue for the development of uni@@ form .

qu yi yang , a mao - yu report , says that we can keep the ro@@ tary fi@@ ber in the house and that we can benefit from the determination and the courage of the party committee organs of the great team to clear the house .
today , a certain communications training regiment of the chengdu military region has more than 10 cadres who have been moved from the barr@@ acks . they have a good understanding of the party committee of the brigade in the case of having the courage to solve problems in the face of real and tough problems , and are full of admir@@ ation and care .
a few years ago , with the personnel 's efforts to build up the family structure of the brigade , some houses were un@@ law@@ fully occupied , and the housing difficulties for the cadres on the job were relatively great .
the brigade also had a few times that the unit had not been able to stop its way of doing things because of various obstruc@@ tions .

the new party committee 's leading body reached a consensus on the issue , and the principal leaders personally began to thoroughly clear up all the problems of illegal housing occupation .
they were on the side of the br@@ u@@ sh , and they were very clear about the side of the personnel concerned , while on the other hand , they also talked about the relevant policies and regulations regarding the use of the funds for the ar@@ able land in the armed forces , and showed the party committee 's firm determination and principled stand .

the design of the 2007 - style military uni@@ form design is a guest of the china online military service .
beijing , july 13 -- yang bao@@ jin , reporter liu xin@@ xin reports : the pla units have been conducting a series of military exercises since august 1 .
tonight , the chinese military online specially invited military products to be used in the military field , which need to be used by chen jun , deputy director of the armament bureau , and senior engine@@ er of the institute of equipment and equipment , to visit the chinese military network , and to share the military service ne@@ tiz@@ ens from within and outside the military .
the two guests are the seven - type military uni@@ form design , which is directly designed and developed .
speaking of the change in the new military uni@@ form , they said that the 2007 - style military uni@@ form is a special form of 97 - type military uni@@ form , which is designed on the basis of 97 - type military uni@@ forms .
the biggest characteristic of the 07 - style military uni@@ form is that it reflects the characteristics of turning the pul@@ se into the hand - held function , and that it has enabled our military to achieve the first coordinated among the three armed services , and that the standard of the series of supporting systems indicates that our army 's military buil@@ du@@ p has made a historic leap .
the two guests also exchanged views on the varie@@ ties of the new military uni@@ form , the ro@@ tary fi@@ br@@ e , and other issues with the ne@@ tiz@@ ens .

the people 's armed forces platform in jing@@ jiang city has upgraded the quality of the armed forces
the reporter learned from this newspaper , cao jia@@ quan , zhu hu@@ i@@ bin , that on 18 june , a special wu cadre in jiang@@ jiang city , jiangsu province , was ass@@ em@@ bled by lu yu@@ qing , director of the xi@@ ul@@ ian town , to " fight and win the psychological warfare under the condition of informationization . " the team members were unanimously supported by the students involved in the training .
this is a unique characteristic of the mechan@@ ized inf@@ an@@ try unit in light of the actual situation of their posts , and it is also a new change in the comprehensive quality of the military cadres .
early this year , the party committee of the ministry of military affairs discovered during a study at the grassroots level that some special military cadres were in a long position , and that they did not concentrate their main energy on armed work .
for this reason , they have adopted a concentrated training method to train cadres in the military field , such as training in the military schools , and so on , to regularly train specialized military cadres , and to focus on solving the problem of a lack of knowledge for military cadres .
in light of the central task , we should boldly give cadres the right to work at the posts , and enhance their ability to work at the posts .
at the same time , they actively coordinated with local organization departments , and jointly formulated the " plan for the appointment of post - posts by specialized armed forces cadres " , which clearly stipulates that the director of the armed forces must go to the leading body of the party committee and stop using other positions .
and established a mechanism for the adjustment and exchange of military cadres , which is not adap@@ ted to the needs of the grassroots armed forces , and read@@ justed and exchanged their personnel in a timely manner , which has a strong comprehensive quality and has a strong ability to work .
not long ago , the director - general of the armed forces department of the new century chi@@ en yi - song led the militi@@ a technical detachment in innov@@ ating and developing under@@ water vessels filled the domestic net , and was broken into the company 's director of the armed forces department .
good , and good .
as far as the results are concerned , the 2 - 2 score is reasonable , and also a reflection of what can be accepted . the key is the process of the competition , and how much regre@@ ts it .
if the iranian team leads by 2 - 0 , then the + edge will be dou@@ bled , then it will certainly not be the same for china 's in@@ stant feeling .
good and good will cannot be achieved in the end . it can be said that it is a kind of old problem .
the current situation is that under the current situation , it will not k@@ ick the ball , and the general view is that china 's psychological quality is not up to the mark .
this is indeed not a good thing , but a good thing .
however , from the perspective of today 's competition , it seems that it is not as good as that .
sun ji@@ hai , sun ji@@ af@@ u , zheng lib@@ in , and others k@@ ic@@ ked the ball in europe , but li feng and others did not say that li feng and others were also the old s@@ and s@@ and s@@ and s@@ and - kn@@ owing l@@ uck . they saw many things to see , and they said that their psychological qualities would not be as good as reason .
this has been forced by the iranian team for a cru@@ el reason , perhaps because of the im@@ min@@ ent deployment of troops .
the iranian team was in a backward condition , and the match was immediately held .
in the second half of the game , three kinds of names were changed , but the effect was not good .
we must overcome the problem of being good at the beginning and being good at the end , and we must find the root cause of the problem .
so long as the problems are accurately identified and the methods for rev@@ am@@ ping the bad are probably not difficult to find .
i am afraid i am afraid of getting medical treatment in a hur@@ ry .
if this goes on , then it will k@@ ick more mat@@ ches , and the old problem will still be off@@ set , and it will not be possible to talk about the k@@ ick that everyone is looking forward to .
