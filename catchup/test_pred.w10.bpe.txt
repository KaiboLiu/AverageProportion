chin@@ ane@@ ws , july 30
according to a report by china securities news , the " interim procedures on management of investment in foreign countries " recently came into effect , and insurance funds have broader space for use in the capital market .
liu le@@ fei , chief investment officer of china 's c@@ of@@ fee company , held that the appreciation of the renminbi and the good development of the domestic capital market will not be able to make investment through the purchase of foreign exchange , and this also means that the funds outside the border will not be diverted to the domestic stock market in the short term .
the report said that many insurance institutions hold the same view .
experts said that because there is no such product market at present , insurance institutions are not in sufficient risk - ev@@ asion means , so the time is not ri@@ pe for a large - scale purchase of foreign exchange .
liu le@@ fei said : in terms of asset allocation for a long time , foreign investment should account for a certain proportion of the overall allocation of insurance companies .
however , in view of the pressure of the renminbi 's greater appreciation , china will mainly use its own foreign exchange funds to carry out overseas investment .
in terms of foreign exchange purchase and foreign investment , we should deal with it carefully under the present circumstances .

chin@@ ane@@ ws , july 30 chen shui - bian questi@@ oned on the island 's judicial personnel 's attempt to interven@@ e in the taiwan region 's leadership election .
the administrative yuan of taiwan 's su@@ shi k@@ ao k@@ ao k@@ ao chi@@ ao said on the same day that the current performance of a judge on the island is in@@ consistent with what chen shui - bian said , and he also asked chen shui - bian to explain his explanation .
according to taiwan 's " imper@@ ial " report , chen shui - bian questi@@ oned the judges or investig@@ ators on 30 may . he was involved in the incident because of political factors or the election considerations , and even attempted to influence the election activities of the candidates of various political parties . he said he hoped that this phenomenon would not exist in taiwan , but it is very difficult to do so .
in view of chen shui - bian 's doubts , taiwanese head of the x@@ uan x@@ uan x@@ ue yue refused to respond , and the secretary general fan ku@@ ang , the secretary general , fan ku@@ ang , and gao jin@@ zhi , representative of the judicial organs , spoke at the meeting .
gao jin@@ zhi said that the fundamental law and code of judges on taiwan 's part have clearly declared that judges should go beyond the party 's political party and that they should not participate in party activities or in the election , and that judges are very cautious about the relevant observ@@ ations and the judicial organs believe that judges are very cautious about the matter .
gao jin@@ zhi pointed out that chang sheng@@ xi , a judge from the kaohsiung high school , was a student of the kaohsiung university a few years ago . because the relevant curriculum has a political party color , it has decided to form a self - discipline committee for judges .
zhang sheng@@ xi once wanted to take part in the dpp 's x@@ uan [ name as transliterated ] election , but he also decided to give up the final decision because he was involved in the controver@@ sy over taking part in the election .
gao jin@@ zhi held that if a case is tried in case , if there is a case at the court level , it cannot be jud@@ ged by the outcome of the judgment alone , and that is to say , the judge should not have political intentions .
germany to lower import thre@@ sh@@ old for professional talent
the first joint operation of the " blue sea " was launched in ber@@ lin , july 1 , by reporter huai@@ cheng wang
a few days ago , german minister of education and scientific research sh@@ av@@ o sc@@ ow@@ d@@ h@@ ury said that germany should reduce the restrictions on the introduction of foreign professionals in the " code of ethics " and solve the problem of specialized talent facing germany through increasing the restrictions on the introduction of foreign professionals .
according to the o@@ ec@@ d report , germany 's labor force for 15 to 64 will decline year on year .
if there is no enough immigrants , then germany 's labor will be down by 6@@ percent as compared with the present number .
however , the german employers ' federation and the german engine@@ ers ' association have shown that in germany , there are more skilled workers in the labor market .
according to statistics from the german federal labor bureau , the number of engine@@ ers suppl@@ ied by german engine@@ ers in the labor market was about 17@@ 0,000 , and the technicians provided 9@@ 600 people .
germany has set up a relatively high standard for the introduction of foreign talent in order to protect its own employment .
the german " imper@@ ial method " stipulates that professionals in non - eu countries are not allowed to be less than 8.@@ 55 million eur@@ os in germany , otherwise they cannot obtain the permission of working and living in germany .
sh@@ al@@ om suggested that this limit be lowered to the original euro .
do not have super@@ sti@@ tion in law ,
the " law on lawyers " amendment bill , which was recently submitted to the npc standing committee for deliberation , stipulates that those who have engaged in specialized work such as legal research on tibetan studies and teaching , who have high - grade or similar professional standards , applied for practi@@ sing by lawyers , and those who have applied for the law enforcement profession may be subject to the examination and verification by the judicial and administrative departments of the state council .
( june 28 , " china 's imper@@ ial " )
there are those who have a theoretical character and a practical and realistic perspective in law , and the difference between the rich and poor , the former mainly includes those who have a sense of responsibility , such as legal aid , legal aid , and specific behavior , such as legal consultation service .
for a long time , there are many problems in the theoretical field , such as the theory of ' one country , two systems ' , the l@@ op@@ sid@@ ed , and the theory circles , which held that the actual operations are not in need of the need to be done . the only thing is that the ' three represents ' are the western regions .
the legal can do what is to maintain the difference in division of labor , not to support any party by using a single reference .
however , the " law of lawyers " is a " imper@@ ial " , but obj@@ ectively speaking , it recogn@@ izes the legal obligation of the legal theoretical circles as being above the legal entities and the people 's living quarters .
in fact , some people who engage in research and teaching on theories such as the law of the legal system and the law of the international law are also closely related to legal practice .
in this way , the ' x@@ uan ' [ name as transliterated ] , no doubt , has created an extremely bad situation for the dis@@ cre@@ tionary powers of the legal - service workers ' profession , which has affected extremely good , bad , and bad , but bad .
the super@@ sti@@ tion in the theoretical circle is not only that , but also not all that , for example , experts and experts ' argu@@ ments will affect or even ve@@ to court judg@@ ments , and this is also a direct manif@@ estation of super@@ sti@@ tion .

britain to lower levels of terrorist attacks
london , 5 jul ( xinhua ) -- by reporter lin guo
british government cut down the level of terrorist attacks from the highest level to the serious level of the qin dynasty , saying that the terrorist attacks in britain will soon occur , but there is still a possibility that attacks are still im@@ min@@ ent .
at present , the british police are shif@@ ting the investigation scope to india and australia .
the eight suspects arrested were all working in the medical system , and the government will provide a complete set of information on the background of the migr@@ ants who have entered the medical system .
it is learned that some people working in the british public health system are receiving medical treatment overseas .
the prime minister also asked to investigate the background of high - tech immigrants , and employers or relevant organizations will be asked to provide background information .
do n't let business take a p@@ ity .
the tourist co@@ inci@@ d@@ ence is to relax the imper@@ ial burden of the emperor , to the maximum extent , to enjoy the fruits of the natural and social civilizations .
but many people have encountered such a kind of ang@@ er , a kind of worry , and a sh@@ ock of sh@@ ang sh@@ ang and a intermedi@@ ary business .
whether it is a car or a train , the tr@@ uck will always be subject to the d@@ ying of a small deal@@ er and some non - auth@@ en@@ tic intermedi@@ ary .
it is not selling a variety of newspapers and magaz@@ ines without a license , and then many un@@ qualified intermedi@@ ary newspapers and journ@@ als , such as be@@ ver@@ ages , be@@ ver@@ ages , and false t@@ estim@@ on@@ ies .
if you do not accept it , he can ch@@ ase you for several hundred meters , and it is much more un@@ successful to become ben@@ evol@@ ent .
in some of the cold , many , many , and some kind of , the same feeling .
if we do not enter the gate , people will come to the tourist , the little bit of the br@@ u@@ sh .
after entering the door , this situation will be more , and the good y@@ ax@@ ing will also be bl@@ u@@ f@@ fed and bl@@ u@@ f@@ f@@ fed .
some media reports said that many foreign tourists visiting xi@@ '@@ an were not surpris@@ ed at the mon@@ ument of xi@@ '@@ an but they were not happy about allowing more p@@ iles of small businessmen to sell them everywhere .
they include the ha@@ p@@ haz@@ ard of the station , the sol@@ ar , the original , the original , and the areas of the b@@ ic@@ y@@ cle , the need to be civilized , calm , and harmonious , and give a gr@@ ac@@ eful environment for the heart .
the free she@@ ep of the business deal@@ er , the distur@@ b@@ ance of the sh@@ ang , and the heart of the business , obj@@ ectively speaking , under@@ min@@ ed these kinds of public order , forming a public order which is pollu@@ ted and pollu@@ ted by pollution and environmental pollution , and also providing conditions and opportunities for the business community .
what is important is that these pieces of sh@@ ru@@ bs are the wind@@ ows for the building of local spiritual civilization . the damaged ones are not just the image problems , but also the impact on local economic development .
just imag@@ ine , if you want to become a strong tourist industry , you will use this kind of chao@@ tic and m@@ ess tourist environment to gre@@ et the guests from south to north . who is willing to come , who can still dare to come ?
how can your tourist economy obtain benefits ?
with the arrival of the peak tourism season , a civilized tourist environment will be created for tourists from southern and northern parts of the country .
the market is not the market , and the operation of small business haw@@ kers should be standardized . the business of unlicensed operation should be resolutely abol@@ ished , and illegal activities should be resolutely cracked down .
only by so doing can we feel happy and make a living in an orderly environment of civilization and order .
let 's take a p@@ ack of a bit .
prc : renmin ribao article says ' not ' self - motiv@@ ated ' to give awards
the construction of roads in dong@@ cheng district in beijing is used as a method of providing electricity , such as giving electricity to others , and as a reward to 12 households who have volun@@ t@@ arily retired .
( beijing daily , 10 july )
i am pleased to see the improvement in the living conditions of these families , but i have a lot of complaints about the proposal of with@@ drawing from the initiative to back the bit@@ ter cold and the method of giving awards to the people .
deputy director of the jian@@ xiang street office said that in view of the problem of fraud and low protection , encouraging the initiative to volun@@ t@@ arily withdraw from insurance is a model for other low - income households .
this example is to encourage other low - income people to extr@@ icate themselves from difficulties through their own efforts , and it is indeed worth advocating , and if they want to use this as a pretext to call back those people who have been che@@ ated for long - term protection , then they are not exemp@@ ted from being n@@ ai@@ ve .
in the work of differ@@ enti@@ ating and sor@@ ting out the poor households , it is more dependent on the law .
relevant departments should strengthen the protection of the minimum allow@@ able income for the elderly who have to perform their obligations when enjoying the minimum allow@@ able income : they should report on the changes in family members and their income , report on employment , and accept re@@ examination on a regular basis , while relevant departments should intensify their supervision and inspection .
after all , it is only a long - term plan to withdraw from the law .
the street has given a reward to the family who has given a guarantee to the family .
as a primary government organization , streets are spending on funds .
the tax@@ pay@@ er should not have a bl@@ an@@ ket of money ?
on the one hand , with@@ drawing from the low - income families has proved that they have possess@@ ed a certain self - sufficient self - sufficient capability , and on the other hand , do they still apply for low - income insurance ?
the government 's financial appropri@@ ation , which is called relief funds , should be used to provide relief supplies in the snow rather than to add flowers to the moon .
liu t@@ ing@@ yi is willing to serve as a service provid@@ er .
on 10 july , the first county in the whole country elected by public as a public - owned , liu yun@@ lan , in mu@@ lan town in xin@@ du district , was granted the fourth democratic election after taking office . the rate of man@@ ual satisfaction reached 9@@ 7.@@ 7 percent .
during the dialogue between the reporter and liu , liu di@@ an@@ yi defined himself as a model of a th@@ ief service .
( yesterday 's " beijing news " )
liu t@@ ent@@ ang 's ' th@@ um@@ bs ' service may be more than those who appoint cadres who are called ' th@@ ic@@ kn@@ ess ' than some others , but they are more true and have a bit more un@@ comfor@@ table .
the most important part of the system of directly nom@@ inated candidates is that the former is decided by ordinary party members , and the latter is mainly appointed by higher - level organizations , and the direction of the source of power determin@@ es that the former must be responsible to the people .
the source of power and who should be responsible are the fundamental factors that determine how the elected person should carry out their work .
some people doubt this kind of democracy , but the imper@@ ial democracy is like a l@@ ac@@ key .
my view is that there is such a democratic way of sh@@ ame , which is better than that of a poor form .
taking into consideration the history and current situation of china 's grassroots democratic political building , i think direct election is a major breakthrough , and democracy is a " tr@@ um@@ p card " of the important part of the effort to promote democracy at the grassroots level .
india hop@@ efully holds first female presidential analy@@ st , saying that it is more likely to be elected , and female voters hope that it will raise the status of women
on 23 june , p@@ ae@@ chi was in front of the presidential candidate 's document .
the cur@@ tain of the indian presidential election began on the 19@@ th . the new president will hold a meeting with the president in the state of l@@ as@@ hk@@ ar pr@@ an@@ ab , a state of l@@ as@@ hk@@ ar , who was re@@ signed not long ago .
p@@ ag@@ ang is the first female presidential candidate in indian history . if she is elected , she will be the first female president in india 's bas@@ e@@ ball .
p@@ ag@@ ou is a candidate for the ruling national congress party , while sh@@ ev@@ at@@ t comes from the opposition party party .
because the congress party has a dominant position in the presidential election , the media and the people are all worried about the possibility of being elected by p@@ ach@@ ach@@ ang .
the 72 - year - old p@@ ang@@ ba is the head of the l@@ as@@ hk@@ ar .
her husband , yang , has rich experience in the congress and has a lot of experience . during her term as president of l@@ ag@@ ar state , she was under the government 's jurisdiction .
she also devoted herself to social welfare , which is the honor@@ ary chairman of many cultural and social welfare organizations .
analysts pointed out that the reason why p@@ ai@@ hu became a candidate was because she had always been a member of the indian national congress party , s@@ onia g@@ and@@ hi .
in india , the g@@ and@@ hi family has long controlled the ruling national congress party .
p@@ '@@ zi was supported by a large number of female voters , and the voters believed that p@@ ag@@ ha@@ it@@ an would play a role in the image of a female woman who dis@@ crimin@@ ated against the serious s@@ la@@ p of the female concept of a female , and raise the status of a woman .
the constitution stipulates that india is a federal state , and the president is the head of state and a coordin@@ ator of the president , and does not represent any party organization , and more is a symb@@ ol .

the number of reports that triggered bad re@@ actions by di@@ a@@ bet@@ es , brunei , has increased sharply .
according to a report by the us media on the 15th , the number of reports on bad re@@ actions such as the di@@ a@@ bet@@ es drug , the di@@ a@@ bet@@ es , and other mal@@ ar@@ ia has recently increased sharply in the united states .
the us food and drug administration issued a safety warning in may this year , propos@@ ing di@@ a@@ bet@@ es to be cautious in using di@@ a@@ bet@@ es because scientists had already published a research report on may 21 , " xin ji@@ ao " , saying that this kind of drug sales would greatly increase the inci@@ d@@ ence of illness and the inci@@ d@@ ental rate of the patients and the population of the chr@@ onic heart disease .
wen di y@@ a@@ ho@@ o has therefore been closely watched by doctors and patients .
statistics show that in about one month after the issue of a safety warning , the us drug authority received 3@@ 57 examples of the adverse response , 38 of which were from the dead .
in january and february this year , the bureau received only 50 and 73 non - performing reports respectively .
these bad re@@ actions were less than the fo@@ am and weigh@@ ed down to the death of sudden head of heart attack .
however , the drug expert of the us drug administration believes that the conclusion of the in@@ secure conclusion of the di@@ di@@ y@@ ah is too early .
the authority will hold a meeting on july 30 on wen@@ di 's y@@ ach@@ ts .
in 1999 , the imper@@ ial writing di@@ ao was a pan@@ cre@@ cre@@ cre@@ ed for increasing the d@@ os@@ age and appl@@ ies to treating the imper@@ ial di@@ a@@ bet@@ es .
about 6 million di@@ a@@ bet@@ es patients have taken or are taking it .
wen di 's gr@@ en@@ ade , britain 's gre@@ en@@ sp@@ an , has always thought wen di@@ eg@@ o is safe and is more than a ca@@ rel@@ ess@@ ness for the patient .

us defense department re@@ considered plan to reduce us troops in europe
a us defense department official said on the 23@@ rd that the us department of defense is re@@ considering the plan to cut the number of us troops stationed in europe by about half due to the changes in the iraq war and the world situation .

however , in june this year , u . s . military european command commander , x@@ un@@ c@@ u , submitted a report to the current defense minister , asking him about the above - mentioned plan .

the report suggested that the reduction of us forces in europe be stopped .
relevant us experts believe that the above phenomena show that the long - term pul@@ ling of the iraq war has caused the original plan of adjustment of the us military .

three major functions of modern military uni@@ form
one is the identification function .
different countries ' armies , different arms , different arms , different arms , and different arms , and important signs of the people .
in the military forces of more than 100 countries , although the use of military uni@@ forms is basically the same , no country or military uni@@ forms are completely the same .
second is symbol@@ izing functions .
to a certain extent , uni@@ forms are not only a reflection of the spiritual outlook of a country and a reflection of the national character , but also a concentrated emb@@ odi@@ ment of the combat capability of a country 's military .
in the three big military uni@@ forms , the pla is the most capable of showing the unique characteristics of the army and the troops , the beautiful scen@@ ery , and the best way to display the unique military uni@@ form of the three big uni@@ forms .
third , protection functions .
with the rapid development of new and high - tech weapons and equipment , the enhancement of the comprehensive protection function of new - type equipment has enabled the uni@@ form to have the defensive function of defending against the enemy 's chemical , anti - b@@ ac@@ ter@@ ial radi@@ ation , and the adjustment of he@@ at - ti@@ ed , hu@@ mid - tun@@ ing , and so on , and has become the most important issue in the development of military uni@@ forms .

prc : pla daily : design@@ ers of military uni@@ form design@@ ers
the reporters learned from the beijing office of the pla that from 1 august , the pla units will successively change the military uni@@ form of 7 .
tonight , the chinese military online specially invited the deputy director of the armament department of the pla supplies department , chen jun , deputy director of the armament bureau , and a senior engine@@ er of the institute of equipment under the pla need , su yang , as a guest of china 's website , and the background and process of the creation of the new army by ne@@ tiz@@ ens both inside and outside the army .
the two guests are the directly - developed and manufactured by the ' shi@@ chang ' model military uni@@ form design .
on the changes in the new uni@@ form , they said that the 7 - style military uni@@ form is a special " 97 - style military uni@@ form " system , which is designed on the basis of 97 - style uni@@ form . in the series of military uni@@ forms , such as " br@@ on@@ ze she@@ ets , " the seven - point improvement has been made in several hundred aspects .
the most prominent characteristic of the ' 07 - style uni@@ form ' is that it reflects the requirement of ' putting the functions of a cold - shoul@@ dered role , ' and for the first time , the pla 's military has reached the standard for coordinating the three armed services ' coordinated series of ' bas@@ el ' [ zhi hui ] , and has marked a historic leap forward in the level of building military uni@@ form .
the two guests also exchanged views on the new type of military uni@@ form , such as the " br@@ y@@ ant " , and other issues .

jing@@ jiang city people 's armed forces platform upgraded to improve quality of military cadres
the " dong@@ guan " of china 's jiangsu province was discovered on 18 june at a meeting held by cadres of jing@@ jiang city , jiangsu province .
this is a scene of the combined efforts of the pla personnel department to give them the actual work of the special troops cadres , and to make efforts to improve the overall quality of the cadres with special skills .
at the beginning of this year , the party committee of the ministry of personnel 's armed forces discovered through investigation at the grass - roots level that some cadres with special skills , such as x@@ x , nec@@ k , and holding power , had not put their main energy on the work of armed forces .
for this reason , they have adopted the method of concentrated training of the " three represents " to train specialized military cadres on the basis of training in the name of a local party school , and have worked hard to solve the problem of having a single professional quality for military cadres .
in connection with the central task , they boldly turned over to the military cadres with special skills , and trained their abilities through their posts .
at the same time , they actively coordinated with local organization departments and jointly formulated the " plan for the appointment of military cadres with special skills " , explicitly that the minister of the armed forces must go to the party committee of the armed forces and not hold any other posts .
a mechanism for adjustment and exchange of cadres with special skills has been established to provide a system for the adjustment and exchange of cadres with special skills who are not adap@@ ted to the work of armed forces at the grassroots level . comrades who have good comprehensive quality and excellent ability to work should be adjusted and exchanged in a timely manner .
not long ago , chen yi@@ song , director of the armed forces department of the new century 's c@@ it@@ r@@ us company , led the militi@@ a technical unit to innovate and develop under@@ water vessels , filled a domestic hel@@ pl@@ ess , and upgraded it to the armed department of the company .
good will be the first to be good .
the 2 - 2 score was reasonable , compared to the 2 - 2 score , and could be accepted by the play@@ er .
if the iranian team leads the 2 - 0 team , then it will be equ@@ alized by the score , then the feeling for china 's bas@@ e@@ ball will be very strong , and the morale will be very high .
it can be said that a veteran de@@ vice is not good at the beginning .
it is often under the situation of being a bit bad and ordinary people think that china 's psychological quality is not perfect .
this is indeed a reason why the fe@@ els cannot be so good or bad .
however , judging from today 's competition , it seems that it is not as good as it is .
sun ji@@ ao , sun ji@@ xiang , zheng ji@@ ao@@ zhi , and others , did not say when they were in europe , and li wei - feng and others were also old friends of the s@@ and field . they could see the s@@ and field and their psychological quality could not be any problem .
the ir@@ an@@ ians are forced to settle down because of this p@@ ile of regre@@ ts , i am afraid that it will be a m@@ ere form@@ ality .
the iranian team has been replaced by two men in backward conditions , and the scene has immediately been fe@@ ared .
in the second half , the effect was not good .
to overcome the problems that cannot be properly handled , we must find the root cause of the problems .
as long as the problems are accurately identified and the methods for correc@@ ting the problems are changed , it is probably not difficult to find them .
they fear that they will be in a hur@@ ry and will go to hospital in a dis@@ orderly manner .
if this is done , it will be a bit more competition , and old problems will still be inv@@ al@@ id@@ ated , and it will not be possible to talk about the k@@ ick that everyone wants to do .
