it is no@@ te@@ worthy that in the " four - year defense evaluation report , " the " four - year defense review report " was officially submitted to congress , and president bush also submitted the government budget for the fiscal year 2007 , including the defense budget of $ 4@@ 3@@ 9.@@ 3 - billion .
if the same is added to the iraq war , the united states will have to pay a $ 1 billion budget for the fiscal year 2007 .
peng guang@@ qian maintained that the us specul@@ ation of other countries ' threat reflects the fact that the pentagon is making enemies .
experts say that compared with the huge military spending of the united states , china 's national defense spending is quite limited .
he has participated in several times the drafting of the chinese national defense white paper , said deng hong@@ zhou , a military expert , that since the 1990 s , with economic development , china 's national defense spending has increased , but this proportion has been dec@@ lining in overall terms of the national financial expenditure for the same period .
official statistics show that in 2004 , the total volume of china 's national defense spending for the same period was about one - third lower than in 1979 .
china 's defense spending in 2005 was 2@@ 4.@@ 6@@ 56 - billion yuan , only a considerable amount of us $ 1 - 14 , and its per capita military spending was only about $ 2@@ 8.@@ 6 - billion .
the land area of the united states and china 's territory are r@@ oughly equal , and the gap in military spending is such a huge gap , and who is the military force in that country going beyond the legitimate defense needs .
" the two sides have conducted fruitful cooperation in the fields of economy , trade , science and technology , culture , education , culture , education , culture , education , culture and education , " he said .
china 's arms control and disarmament association director teng jian@@ q@@ un said that the united states should obj@@ ectively assess china 's military construction , and that china 's peaceful development does not im@@ ply that china and the united states will be milit@@ arily the oppon@@ ent .
the 2004 edition of china 's national defense white paper says that china firmly follows the path of peaceful development and practices defensive national defense policy .
china has not done anything to do with the present situation , nor will it pose a threat to any country .
so far , china has not established any military bases in any other country , nor has it sent military bases to other countries .
professor of the international relations college of beijing university zhu feng said : china and the united states should , through the established channels , increase communication and exchanges , enhance understanding and mutual trust , comprehensively promote the healthy and stable development of the sino - us constructive and cooperative relations in the new century , and jointly promote world peace and development .

china : hamas ' cabinet seeking to break through
xinhua news agency , ram@@ al@@ lah , february 9 ( by staff reporter : after hamas formed a cabinet to seek a breakthrough
xinhua news agency reporter wang hao and huang min
the palestinian islamic resistance movement ( hamas ) won the election of the legislative yuan , how to draw a new government blueprint into a new international political focus at present .
what kind of new policy will hamas pursue directly affect the peace process 's next step in the relevant policies ,
at the same time , the united states and israel have even more in@@ different at@@ titu@@ des toward the prospects of the hamas government .
at present , all the palestinian parties are stepping up consultations to reach a consensus on the formation of a cabinet concerning the difficulties and sensitive points of future development of the situation .
the chinese government has taken a series of measures to prevent the recur@@ r@@ ence of the crisis .
hamas won the right to form a cabinet , and people were worried that hamas 's prime minister might meet with the current supreme leader ab@@ b@@ as .
moreover , the visiting chinese president , ma@@ h@@ m@@ oud ma@@ h@@ m@@ oud , who is currently visiting egypt , stressed that the new palestinian government , which was set up under the leadership of hamas , will not recognize israel , and this tough signal has also intensified international anx@@ ie@@ ties .
the united states and israel clearly indicated that they would not accept a hamas government that has the power to hold power , and threatened to hal@@ t economic aid to palestine and transfer taxes to palestine .
however , this does not prevent hamas from making flexible tactics adjustments , and it will elect independent candidates to be the best way to achieve a compromise .
it is reported that in order to maxim@@ ize international recognition , a few days ago , hamas leaders at home and abroad , who have gathered in egypt , decided to elect independent candidates to be elected president of the ch@@ ath@@ al@@ ab@@ i islamic university , j@@ a@@ '@@ al@@ em@@ i , to become new prime minister .
this move has not yet been responded by the parties concerned .
palestinian analysts said that the united states will not change its policy of " no matter who will take the prime minister 's office . "
the power is distributed through the internet .
in the internal context , the problem of the biggest challenge facing hamas in forming a cabinet is that it lacks sufficient ruling experience .
the palestinian daily newspaper carried an analysis saying that hamas has been using the social welfare program to gather people to gather in favor , but in the aspect of governance , it lacks experience and is closely related to the palestinian national liberation movement , which has its governing experience .
hamas has proposed a similar proposal after the election to establish political partner with fat@@ ah , and to jointly establish a national coalition government , but fat@@ ah has not given any positive response to it .
the situation in fat@@ ah is now in a dis@@ position to see whether or not to join the cabinet , and one faction has proposed to participate in the new government , while the other faction ref@@ uses to accept hamas 's invitation , and is willing to actively engage in opposition in the legislative yuan legislative yuan 's work .
the informed source pointed out that the ab@@ b@@ as ' advice was that fat@@ ah gradually ten@@ ds to join the new government .
even so , hamas and fat@@ ah have also been holding consultations on the cabinet 's distribution .
another approach is to establish a legislative committee framework to manage things beyond the framework of the legisl@@ ature .
it was reported that hamas also designed a clear - cut expert - type government , but the specific name list was un@@ clear .
in view of the attitude of the united states and israel , the technical expert - type government is not losing the ability to form a cabinet to alleviate external pressure .
according to the provisions of the palestinian " basic law , " the new legislative yuan will hold a meeting to nom@@ in@@ ate the prime minister and form a cabinet within three weeks and five weeks after the new legislative yuan takes office on 16 february .
the armed forces should be determined by the direction of what they should follow .
the weapons in hamas 's hands are the other problems facing the new government .
the attitude of the united states and israel is very tough , and they resolutely demand that hamas give up violence and rej@@ ect its armed participation in politics .
hamas leader ma@@ h@@ m@@ oud al-@@ mas@@ ad stressed on 9 november that armed resistance is the choice of the organization .
the armed issue actually includes the leg@@ ality of weapons and the ownership of armed forces .
hamas has won the right to vote in the legisl@@ ature , the first largest party in the legisl@@ ature , through democracy and freedom , and has sent armed factions to q@@ ass@@ er brigade .
hamas once proposed that all armed forces be unified as the palestinian national authority , the people 's army , but it did not receive extensive response , and it was also condemned by the palestinian islamic ji@@ had .
palestine now has more than 6@@ 0,000 security personnel , and most of them are from the fat@@ ah camp .
moreover , fat@@ ah has some organization relations that are sl@@ ack and lo@@ ose , and for example , + am@@ ak marty@@ rs brigade has been listed as a ' tr@@ aw@@ ler ' of ta@@ her .
the hamas , which is responsible for forming the cabinet , must have a thorough exchange of views with ab@@ b@@ as on how to manage the armed forces that are running their own affairs and ration@@ ally distribu@@ te the security management power .
according to local media reports , ab@@ b@@ as is deliberately in charge of security and intelligence units , police , civil defense organs , and other organizations , and is under the management of the new government 's ministry of interior .
however , all parties are still discussing this sensitive issue , and so far no progress has been made .

the statistics of the " report " show that by the end of 2005 , china had organized 22 scientific research projects involving the eastern pol@@ e , such as dr@@ ag@@ ons and r@@ it@@ ings , as well as the northern pol@@ e scientific research project that was carried on by the be@@ id@@ ai@@ he station . so far , more than 3,000 people have visited the huang he area and visited the north - east hi@@ j@@ el@@ e el@@ ep@@ h@@ ants at the 3@@ 000 - plus personnel on the national tour .

" we are confident that the government will be able to achieve the goal of building a well - off society in an all - round way , " sun zhi@@ hui said .
after more than 20 years of efforts , china 's ul@@ tr@@ a - earth observation has played a major role in the world 's polar exploration . however , it is not as important as other extreme - level inspection countries .

analysts here believe that the gap between the rich and the poor in the south african society , the high unemployment rate , and the spread of guns , and the lack of a capital - punishment deterr@@ ent , the crime rate has remained high .
because many chinese do not understand english , they have a cash relationship with their families , and they are more pr@@ one to become targets of criminal offenders ' financial attacks .

xinhua news agency reporter gao hu@@ an@@ ying
although italy has repeatedly claimed that the people of the republic of tur@@ in will be discovered during the winter olympics , the athletes who have been found to use stimul@@ ants may face the death of j@@ ails , but judging from various situations , such situations are not so likely to occur in the winter olympics .
the city 's winter olympics association opened on 16 february , the first time that the f@@ oping scand@@ al has broken out , the o@@ '@@ le@@ av@@ a party was found to have used banned drugs .
the following day , the i@@ oc announced that le@@ av@@ a had been sent out from the winter olympics . she had been taken to the olympic games in this winter olympics .
the world winter second league held a press conference on the same day to express its support for the two - year ban on the le@@ av@@ ers .
the i@@ oc has been stipul@@ ating that athletes should be kept in the olympic games and that they should be treated as a " good person " and be depriv@@ ed of the right to participate in the games , but they are not subject to legal sanctions .
however , according to italian law , athletes carrying and using stimul@@ ants are classified as criminal acts , and the judiciary has the right to directly arrest and investigate the use of stimul@@ ant agents . to set an example for those who try to test the law in three months to three years , it is not the same .
in december last year , the i@@ oc and the italian government , having spent one year in barg@@ aining , decided to sell off the el@@ ep@@ h@@ ant after fin@@ ishing to l@@ ure the price , and both sides agreed to handle the use of stimul@@ ant incidents in accordance with the italian law during the winter olympics .
through the unremitting efforts of the i@@ oc , italy has made great efforts in the four days before the opening of the winter olympics and promised that the police will not enter the olympic village to search for the athletes ' places during the winter olympics . however , the drug prosecu@@ tors will still accept the supervision of the italian procuratorial authorities .
it was reported that the italian government over@@ sight of the winter olympics officials , per@@ e@@ z , has already sent the le@@ av@@ a 's f@@ ap@@ ai to the eu for investigation .
however , the i@@ oc and pe@@ k@@ an@@ tor have not yet confirmed this .
the two russian winter season team team team , and@@ er@@ sen , arrived in moscow on 17 august to begin a four - day visit to russia .
the chinese government , which had served as a world anti - d@@ oping agency for many years , said that once the le@@ av@@ ov@@ ers were sent back to china , the matter would eventually be out of the list .
shi k@@ ang@@ cheng said : the i@@ oc and the italian government have made important contributions to the fight against d@@ oping in the winter olympics .
according to previous practice , italy used to be a threat to the use of stimul@@ ant incidents by its athletes , the most important result of the punishment given to the law@@ break@@ ers was no more than two years of imprisonment and suspended execution .
therefore , the senior officials of the italian lu@@ f@@ th@@ ans@@ a news agency , pe@@ ter p@@ el@@ i , said that the possibility of sending le@@ av@@ a to pris@@ ons was un@@ expec@@ tedly rare , and most of them were fined .
pi@@ er@@ re also said that although the italian court could hold a hearing , the italian police also had no choice but to go abroad to ex@@ trad@@ ite le@@ av@@ a to take him to serve the sentence .
if he refused to send le@@ av@@ a to accept the verdic@@ t , the italian side would not have to take her .
