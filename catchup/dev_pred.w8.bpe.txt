experts believe that this is an unreasonable accus@@ ation of china 's normal national defense construction , and it is a serious prov@@ ocation against china 's internal affairs .
the " four - year defense assessment report " is a new national defense guidance document of the pentagon .
the 92 - page report used three par@@ agr@@ ap@@ h@@ s to explain china 's military power and the countermeasures that the united states should take , and the report directly mentioned the issue of dealing with china 's affairs or the chinese - tun@@ e foreign exchange , and said that as a major and newly rising country , the chinese nation 's most powerful military power is the most capable of compe@@ ting with the united states , and that if the united states does not have any anti - system measures , it is very likely
professor yao yun@@ zhu , research fellow of the world military research department of the chinese academy of military sciences , said that although senior us officials have repeatedly expressed similar views , this is the first time in the " report on national defense strategy " that the united states has proposed in the " report " that china is the most likely new large country that may constitute a military challenge to the united states .
this report clearly defin@@ es russia 's move to india as a newly emerging strategic competi@@ tor , especially the so - called ' ax@@ is ' military threat from china .
major general peng guang@@ qian , a resear@@ cher of the chinese academy of military sciences , said :
what merits attention is that in the " four - year defense assessment report , " the us president bush also submitted a report to the congress on the results of the 2007 fiscal year , including the defense budget of $ 4@@ 3@@ 9@@ 3 - billion .
if the situation is added to the military action in iraq and afghanistan , the us fiscal year 2007 will be a new one .
peng guang@@ qian maintained that the united states has fabr@@ icated the un@@ war@@ ran@@ ted practices of other countries , reflecting the consistent style of the pentagon that created an enemy and created a situation , and its real purpose is to strive for more defense spending and to obtain more profits from the us m@@ uni@@ tions industry group .
experts say that compared with the huge military spending of the united states , china 's defense expenditure is very limited .
he has been involved in many military experts in china 's defense white paper , deng hong@@ zhou said : since the 1990 's , with the development of the economy , china 's defense spending has increased somewhat , but the overall proportion of the national financial expenditure has declined .
official data show that compared with 1979 , china 's defense spending accounted for 2@@ 8.@@ 2 percent of the national financial expenditure in the same period .
in 2005 , china 's defense spending was 24@@ 4.@@ 6@@ 56 billion yuan , only about one - fourth of the united states ' per capita , and the national military expenditure was only about one - 60 percent of that of the united states . the per capita military expenditure was about one - thir@@ ds of that of the us military .
the size of the us territory is r@@ oughly equal to that of china 's territory , but the difference in military expenditure is so huge , and who is the military strength going beyond the legitimate defense needs , this goes without saying .
peng guang@@ qian said :
zhang yan , director of the research department of the china arms control and disarmament association , said that the us side should obj@@ ectively assess china 's military construction and that china 's peaceful development does not mean that china and the united states will become military oppon@@ ents in the future .
the " 2004 china 's national defense " white paper says that china firmly takes the path of peaceful development and practices a defensive national defense policy .
china has never been in the past and will not pose a threat to any country in the future .
so far , china has not established any military bases in any other country , nor has it sent a single soldier or a single p@@ aw@@ n to other countries , and the united states has more than 100 military bases overseas , and has deployed more than 100,000 troops in the asian region alone .
professor zhu feng of the international relations college of beijing university said : china and the united states should increase communication and exchanges through the established channels , enhance mutual understanding and trust , and comprehensively promote the constructive and cooperative relationship between china and the united states in the new century so as to jointly promote world peace and development .

( international ) hamas seeks breakthrough in cabinet
ram@@ al@@ lah , february 9 ( xinhua ) hamas formed a cabinet to seek a breakthrough
xinhua news agency reporter wang hao - huang
the palestinian islamic resistance movement ( hamas ) has won the legislative elections , how to draw up a blueprint for a new government has become a focus of international attention .
what new policy will hamas adopt directly affect the next round of the relevant policies of the peace process .
at the same time , the resistance attitude of the united states and israel has added vari@@ ables to the prospects of the hamas government .
at present , all the palestinians are stepping up their consultations to reach an agreement on the formation of a cabinet that involves the difficulties and sensitive points in the future development of the situation .
the premier 's post has left the premier 's family
after hamas obtained the cabinet , people are worried that prime minister hamas may be linked with the current top leader ab@@ b@@ as .
in addition , hamas leader ma@@ h@@ al , who is visiting egypt , stressed that the new palestinian government , which was formed by hamas , would not recognize israel , and this hard - line signal has also aggrav@@ ated international worries .
the united states and israel clearly expressed their dis@@ approval of a hamas government that holds real power and threatened to inter@@ rup@@ t economic aid to palestine and to send tax to the palestinians .
however , this does not hin@@ der hamas from making flexible strategic adjustments and elec@@ ting an independent person is a compromise .
it is reported that in order to obtain the greatest international approval , the hamas leaders at home and abroad , who gathered in egypt , recently decided to elect the chairman of the board of directors of the sha@@ h@@ in islamic university , ah@@ mar , and ho@@ h@@ ard , as the new prime minister .
this move has not received any response from the relevant parties .
palestinian analy@@ st hos@@ se@@ in said that no matter who is left with his post , the most crucial thing is that the candidate for the prime minister should try his best to play down the t@@ ough@@ est of hamas ' hard - lin@@ ear fla@@ v@@ or , and only thus can he ensure the success of the cabinet formation .
how to alloc@@ ate power
in terms of internal affairs , the biggest challenge facing hamas in forming a cabinet is that it lacks sufficient experience in governance .
the palestinian " sun@@ ni bao " analyzed that by means of social welfare projects , hamas has gathered the people 's morale , but lacks experience in governance and has the same experience in governing the palestinian national liberation movement ( fat@@ ah ) , which has the experience of governing .
after the election , hamas proposed establishing a political partnership with fat@@ ah and jointly forming a national coalition government . however , fat@@ ah has not given a positive response to this .
the question of whether to enter the cabinet is different from the fat@@ ah 's internal opinion , and one faction advocates participation in the new government , so that it can do something , while the other faction ref@@ uses to invite hamas to be active opposition groups in the legislative yuan .
the source pointed out that , with ab@@ b@@ as 's persu@@ asion , fat@@ ah gradually incl@@ ined to join the new government .
even so , hamas and fat@@ ah will also hold consultations on the distribution of cabinet positions .
in addition , the other way is to set up a legislative committee , which is separated from a political party cabinet .
it is reported that hamas has also designed a clean government , but the specific list is unknown .
in view of the attitude of the united states and israel , the technology - speci@@ alist government has no choice but to form a cabinet system to reduce external pressure .
according to the provisions of the basic law of palestine , after the new legislative council was s@@ wor@@ n in on 16 february , the work of nom@@ in@@ ating the premier and forming a cabinet will be completed within three to five weeks .
the question of what course to follow in the armed forces
the weapons in hamas are another thor@@ ny problem facing the establishment of a new government .
the us and israel have adopted a very tough attitude and resolutely demanded that hamas give up violence and refuse to use a gun to participate in government affairs .
hamas leader ma@@ h@@ al stressed on 9 november that armed resistance is a strategic choice of the organization .
the armed forces issue in fact includes the leg@@ ality of weapons and the ownership of the armed forces .
hamas elected the first member of the legislative council through democratic and free means , and its subordinate armed factions are not du@@ shi x@@ an@@ ju .
hamas once proposed to unite all factions into the palestinian national authority , but it did not receive extensive support .
palestine now has more than 6@@ 0,000 security personnel , and most of them come from the fat@@ ah camp .
moreover , fat@@ ah has some lo@@ ose - aff@@ ili@@ ated armed factions , such as shi@@ ite al-@@ aq@@ sa marty@@ rs brig@@ ades , shi@@ jie shi@@ ji@@ az@@ i , and others .
hamas , which is responsible for forming a cabinet , must hold talks with ab@@ b@@ as on how to manage these armed forces that are all responsible for their own affairs and reason@@ ably distribu@@ te security management powers .
according to local media reports , ab@@ b@@ as is incl@@ ined to take charge of security and intelligence units , police and civil defense organizations , and other organizations are managed by the interior ministry of the new government .
however , the parties are still holding consultations on this sensitive issue , and so far there is no further report .

the digital television is gradually becoming the mainstream in the united states
new york , february 12 ( xinhua ) with the rapid growth of the number of digital television sets ( from chi@@ u yu ) , the price of the high resolution digital resolution television sets continues to decline and the market continues to expand , the us television broadcasting agency has also stepped up its introduction of the corresponding high - definition television programs .
the us - style super@@ hu@@ o - r@@ ow@@ ling tour@@ na@@ ment , which has just been set off , has become a hot - standing match for the american broadcasting industry to gre@@ et the era of t@@ v@@ b .
according to a recent report in the financial times , the us congress recently passed a bill requiring the us broadcasting industry to provide the broadcasting industry with the right to fully stop broadcasting the existing simul@@ ated television signals on 17 february 200@@ 9 and only broadcast the digital signals .
this means that the comprehensive dig@@ iti@@ zation of the us tv program has already set a clear timetable .
the popul@@ arization of high resolution digital television on the one hand depends on consumers to buy television sets , and on the other hand , it depends on the manufacturing sector to provide high - resolution digital programs .
although digital television has been mentioned repeatedly in the past few years , it has never become a reality .
this problem has taken a turn for the better this year .
according to the us consumer electronics association 's forecast , the number of digital television sets to be sold in the united states for the first time this year will exceed that of traditional television sets , and 8@@ 5.@@ 5 % of the digital television sets are high resolution products .
japanese researchers develop new highly efficient kid@@ ney
tokyo , february 13 ( xinhua ) the japanese government has been studying the development of a bi@@ om@@ ass - based kid@@ ney by researchers of the east china sea university , which is not only in the same way as human kid@@ ney , but also has the ability to retain its functions of material elements , and its size is small and easy to trans@@ plant . with the in - depth study , it is expected that the kid@@ ney disease will bring the ful@@ l@@ est voice of the patient .
according to a recent report by the ni@@ hon industrial news , the newly developed bi@@ om@@ ass - based kid@@ ney mainly consists of two parts , and some are fil@@ tr@@ ation and water in blood . according to the reports of the sen@@ i@@ ors who built the kid@@ ney of xie x@@ ur@@ u , part of the new@@ born bab@@ y was re@@ produced from the used components of the original water , the t@@ ent@@ ative components , and the rel@@ ics were re@@ used to the blood trans@@ fu@@ sion .
the tu@@ an@@ yuan and tu@@ an@@ tu@@ an are all managed by the middle and the sil@@ k line .
this kind of sk@@ in cell can cause many trans@@ gen@@ ic diseases caused by the in@@ st@@ inc@@ t of my@@ ster@@ y of di@@ an@@ ds , and the tu@@ ber@@ cul@@ os@@ is of the trans@@ fu@@ sion of material into hydr@@ az@@ ine ac@@ id and return to blood , and at the same time , it can also make the tur@@ ni@@ as necessary for body health , such as mel@@ e@@ du@@ es and mineral sub@@ stances , and enter the blood again .
in the past , the difference between human kid@@ ney and the degree of weight of the se@@ epage is fil@@ tr@@ ation , and cannot be completely removed , and there is no need for the re@@ entry of ther@@ ap@@ y of hydr@@ oc@@ ar@@ ic ac@@ id and other elements to return to the blood .
researchers used the mountain she@@ ep to carry out biological human kid@@ ney trans@@ pl@@ ant@@ ation experiments , and the w@@ alls inside the m@@ ud@@ dy c@@ in@@ em@@ a of human kid@@ ney were used in pi@@ g 's ne@@ ys .
two weeks later , researchers confirmed that human kid@@ ney is capable of performing its functions .
at present , they are developing biological human kid@@ ney for the use of human kid@@ ney cell@@ s and will work to clin@@ ical research after verification of their safety .
china 's power industry safety faces severe challenges
beijing , february 13 ( xinhua ) the state power regulatory commission ( s@@ g@@ ac ) said on the 13@@ th that although the overall situation of power safety in 2005 remained stable , the safety of electricity production was still faced with severe challenges .
shi yu@@ bo , vice chairman of the state power regulatory commission , made the above remarks at the fifth meeting of the national power safety production committee held here today .
however , he pointed out that with the changes in the situation of power supply and demand and the successive operation of a large number of new power generating units , power safety production will face new challenges .
these challenges include : regional he@@ at - time power shortage phenomena will still exist , and power supply and demand in some areas will remain tight , and the coal price mechanism has not yet been formed , leading to coal supply still exists .
shi yu@@ bo said : with the deepening of the reform of the power system , many deep - rooted contradictions will be continually exposed , and how to maintain the stability of the ranks of workers and staff members and ensure normal production order will become new problems facing them .
in view of the work of safe production of electricity in 2006 , shi yu@@ bo said that it is necessary to further sol@@ i@@ dif@@ y the foundation for the management of power safety , speed up the establishment and improvement of the mechanism for emergency management of power safety , enhance the ability to deal with unexpected incidents , strengthen coordination and cooperation in power plants and networks , jointly safeguard the safety of the power system , continue to do a good job in supervising and managing the building of the dam , and ensure the safety
it is learned that in connection with the new situation in the management of power safety , the power industry supervision commission will promulg@@ ate the " interim regulations on investigating power production accidents " this year . meanwhile , the relevant power plants will be able to ensure the safety of the dam and the safety of the second power system . the documents will be successively promulgated this year .

south african envoy to china said there are no organizations in south africa that are directed against chinese citizens
beijing , february 13 ( xinhua ) the south african government has decided to grant china a visa to the chinese government for the first time in a meeting with a delegation of the south african embassy in china , said a spokesman for the office of the south african embassy in beijing on tuesday .
he also said that the south african government will do its best to crack down on all forms of criminal activities .
v@@ in@@ in said the south african government hopes to move the rate of crime down to zero , and hopes that every foreign business@@ man in south africa will have a safe and safe operation of the local law and the citizens .
since 2006 , four chinese citizens have been killed in south africa , and the world of chinese people has expressed extensive concern over this .
the chinese foreign ministry has made representations to south africa and reminded chinese citizens in south africa to further enhance their awareness of security and prevention , and the overseas chinese have strengthened their unity and friend@@ liness and cooper@@ ated with the police in cracking down on criminal activities .
i sincerely express our sympathy and sor@@ row to the family members of the victims .
fu k@@ ang@@ ning said : i am sor@@ ry for this , and i also invite the chinese people to believe that the south african government is seriously investigating every case involving china .
the south african police have successfully cracked a case of the chinese woman chen jian@@ qing , who was killed in south africa on february 5 , and a suspect has been arrested .
at present , the police are hun@@ ting for another suspect .
the south african embassy in china revealed that the number of criminal suspects involved in the shooting of hong kong businessmen in january this year has been arrested by south africa 's police and the victims ' property has been recovered .
speaking of the possible impact of the incident of chinese citizens ' ass@@ as@@ sin@@ ation , fu k@@ ang@@ ning said that these incidents indeed have a negative impact on trade between the two countries , tourism , and exchanges in other fields . however , in the long run , the impact of the impact should not be a big stream from a long - term perspective .
the south african embassy tourism commissioner , n@@ ian ben@@ xi , said the embassy had provided more than 2,000 chinese tourists in the first 15 days of this year .
according to chinese official statistics , south africa will continue to maintain its largest export market in africa by 2005 .
the bilateral trade volume reached $ 7.@@ 27 billion , up 2@@ 3.@@ 0 percent year on year .
however , people in the tourism sector believe that the continuous incident of chinese citizens ' ass@@ as@@ sin@@ ation in 2004 has a significant impact on the number of chinese tourists to south africa .
according to statistics from the south african tourism bureau , in the first half of 2005 , china tourists visiting south africa were 20@@ ,@@ 3@@ 31 , down 14.@@ 9 percent compared with the same period last year .
at present , about 200,000 chinese living in south africa are sc@@ attered in urban and rural areas in south africa .
analysts here believe that the gap between the rich and the poor in south africa is wide , the unemployment rate is high , and gun is rampant , and there is no death penalty deterr@@ ent , so the crime rate is still high .
because many chinese do not know english , and they have cash in their bodies and at home , it is more likely to become targets of criminals ' financial attacks .

according to the previous practice of the italian government in using stimul@@ ant cases , the number of illegal immigrants obtained was also the most severe punishment it had been two years ' imprisonment . it was only a short period of two years ' imprisonment .
therefore , the italian mat@@ sa news agency 's senior correspon@@ dent pi@@ er@@ re said that the possibility of sending a le@@ af to a prison is quite inter@@ esting , and the top is fine .
