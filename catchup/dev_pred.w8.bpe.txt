as long as the safety assessment organization meets the relevant requirements and requirements , even if it has not been determined by the cred@@ enti@@ als of the c@@ br@@ c , the financial institution can also h@@ ire it to carry out an electronic banking safety assessment , but it should manage it in accordance with the relevant regulations .

shanghai : part - time personnel and college graduates become h@@ oll@@ y@@ wood workers
beijing , february 7 ( xinhua ) the shanghai municipal labor and social security bureau issued the annual new h@@ our@@ ly wages guide for workers in 2006 , with the number of job coun@@ ters reaching 120 , an increase of 11 from the previous time , with the number of jobs under the guidance of the previous term increased by 11 .
according to an estimate by a relevant expert from the shanghai labor and social security bureau , currently more than 1 million employees in shanghai have been employed in the hours industry .
according to zhong@@ guo qing@@ n@@ ian bao , college graduates and part - time workers are the main component of the h@@ our@@ ly workers .
through the direct investigation of nearly 8,000 h@@ its , over half of the workers are part - time workers , with 5@@ 1.@@ 1 percent of them .
the level of part - time workers ' education is generally higher , and they mainly engage in relatively strong technical work , such as transl@@ ation jobs , part - time staff propor@@ tions , as high as 8@@ 1.@@ 77 percent , and fit@@ ness level as 6@@ 1.6 percent .
high income is the main reason why many people work in part - time jobs .
it is learned that the monthly income of a few positions can reach tens of thousands of yuan , and it will be difficult to do so as if it is trans@@ mitted by sound . the monthly income of an hour job may mostly reach more than 2,000 yuan , such as the part - time financial mar@@ tial arts , and so on .
they are satisfied with their own interests and expanding their knowledge is also something that has been favor@@ ed by part - time workers .
for example , when gu , who is the manager of the human resources department of a company , he would spend several hours a week to handle the financial accounts of a foreign mer@@ ch@@ ant representative office .
mr ko@@ o considers that the greatest benefits of the part - time job are to continuously update his knowledge and to have opportunities to involve another field , of course , the income of $ 2,000 per month also has a certain attr@@ action .
as the employment thre@@ sh@@ old for some hours of work is low , the working form is flexible and free , and is gradually favor@@ ed by many graduates currently seeking jobs , 14@@ 0 % of them are senior secondary and tertiary students in the past three years .
i did not want to work in an hour at the beginning , but after several months i did it , i felt that i was better than the 5 th working in the dprk , and the 5 th working in the dprk .
after gradu@@ ating from university student huang , she found a job that was not as good as she was . finally , she hung up a name at a hotel and used a pi@@ an@@ o to play background music .
i am quite satisfied with my work now , and i have a 100 yuan per hour , the environment is good , what i want to do now is to find a few hours of work , and it is quite like that .
it is learned that the work hours has become a accumul@@ ation of work experience and training skills of some graduates currently working at job seeking , and the communication skills are higher and higher in society .
the graduates work hours mainly in knowledge and technology .
some of the hours ' job - related requirements are not high , such as food promotion and sales li@@ ver@@ er , and unemployed personnel , who are unemployed can be put to work through simple training .
the data show that the number of employees who used to work in the industry was 3@@ 9@@ ,000 , of which the proportion of unemployed personnel in the retail industry was 6@@ 8.@@ 4 percent , and the proportion of the cat@@ ering industry was 5@@ 8.@@ 7 percent , with the number of hours work becoming an important channel for unemployed personnel to find jobs .

prc expert on us ' threat to china ' is ground@@ less
beijing , february 9 ( xinhua ) the chinese government has decided to build a national defense university in the united states , the pentagon said here today
experts believe that this is an unreasonable accus@@ ation against china 's normal national defense construction , and ex@@ ag@@ ger@@ ating the china military threat theory is interference in china 's internal affairs .
the " four - year defense assessment report " is a new national defense guidance document of the pentagon .
the 92 - page report used three par@@ agr@@ ap@@ h@@ s to exp@@ ound china 's military power and the countermeasures that the united states should take , and the 15 reports directly mentioned china 's reaction to its military strength or its parall@@ el with china 's 92 terms , saying : as a major and newly emerging big country , china 's most possess@@ ed advanced weapons of military competition with the united states , and if the united states did not have any anti - system measures , it would very likely develop a bad military
professor yao yun@@ zhu , a research fellow at the world military research department of the chinese academy of military sciences , said that although senior us officials have repeatedly expressed similar views , this is the first time that the strategic report on national defense proposed that china is the most likely new , big country that poses us military challenges .
the ju report clearly descri@@ bes russia 's move of china as a newly emerging strategic oppon@@ ent , especially the so - called chinese military threat theory .
major general peng guang@@ qian , research fellow of the chinese academy of military sciences , said :
what merits attention is that in the " four - year defense assessment report " formally submitted , us president bush also submitted a report to congress on the fiscal year 2007 . the us government budget for the national defense budget reached 4@@ 3@@ 9.@@ 3 - billion us dollars .
if the situation plus the military action in iraq and afghanistan added to the budget , the us budget for defense budget for 2007 will exceed $ 500 billion .
peng guang@@ qian maintained that the us fabr@@ ication of the theory of the threat of other countries has reflected the persistent style of the pentagon that created enemies , and its real purpose is to strive for more defense funds to create a pretext for the us m@@ uni@@ tions industry group .
experts say that compared with the huge military spending of the united states , china 's national defense spending is quite limited .
he has participated in the comp@@ il@@ ation of china 's national defense white papers on many occasions , and said : since the 1990 s , china 's defense spending has increased somewhat as the economy developed , but the proportion of the national defense expenditures in the same period has shown a trend of decline .
official statistics show that compared with 1979 , china 's defense spending accounted for more than half of the national financial expenditure in the same period .
china 's defense spending in 2005 was 24@@ 4.@@ 6@@ 56 - billion yuan , only about one - fourth of the us national defense spending , and the per capita national defense spending was only about one - six@@ ti@@ e@@ th that of the united states , and the per capita military spending was about one - thir@@ ds that of the us military .
the area of the us territory is r@@ oughly the same as that of china , but the difference in military spending is so huge . who exactly is the military power that exceeds proper defense needs is not to mention that .
peng guang@@ qian said :
wang guang@@ ya , director of the research department of the china arms control and disarmament association , said that the us side should obj@@ ectively assess china 's military construction situation , and that china 's peaceful development does not mean that china and the united states will become military ad@@ vers@@ aries in the future .
the " 2004 china 's national defense " white paper says that china firmly follows the path of peaceful development and practices a defensive national defense policy .
china did not have any future experience , nor would it threaten any country .
so far , china has not established any military bases in any other country , nor has it sent a single soldier to other countries , while the united states has over 100 military bases abroad , and it has only deployed more than 100 military bases in asia .
professor zhu feng of the institute of international relations at beijing university said : china and the united states should increase communication and exchanges through the established channels , enhance mutual understanding and mutual trust , and comprehensively advance the constructive and cooperative relations between china and the united states in the new century so as to jointly promote the maintenance of world peace and development .

( international observation ) hamas seeks breakthrough in cabinet formation
ram@@ al@@ lah , february 9 ( xinhua ) the hamas government has decided to form a cabinet to seek a breakthrough
xinhua news agency reporter hao huang
the palestinian islamic resistance movement ( hamas ) has won the legislative council election , how to draw a blueprint for the new government has become the focus of international attention at present .
what kind of new policy will hamas adopt will directly affect the relevant policies of the peace process in the next step .
at the same time , the resistance attitude of the united states and israel has added vari@@ ables to the future of the hamas government .
at present , all parties in palestine are stepping up their consultations on the formation of the cabinet , and the difficulties and sensitive points in the future development of the situation are being actively sought for breakthroughs .
the premier 's position has to be left with which family it takes
after hamas won the cabinet , some people are worried that hamas prime minister , perhaps , will have a difference with the current top leader ab@@ b@@ as .
in addition , hamas leader ma@@ h@@ al , who is visiting egypt , stressed that the new palestinian government , which was formed by hamas , will not recognize israel , and this hard - line signal has also aggrav@@ ated international worries .
the united states and israel have explicitly expressed that they do not accept a hamas government that holds real power and used this to threaten to suspend economic aid to palestine and to transfer tax to the palestinians .
however , this does not prevent hamas from making flexible strategic adjustments , and the election of an independent is a compromise strategy .
according to reports , in order to obtain the greatest international approval , the leaders of hamas , both at home and abroad , who recently gathered in egypt , decided to elect an independent person , and the chairman of the board of directors of the school of islamic ji@@ had , al@@ ex@@ and@@ ri@@ a , was elected as the new prime minister .
this move has not received any response from the relevant departments .
palestinian analysts hos@@ se@@ in said that no matter which premier 's position is spent , the most crucial thing is that the prime minister should try his best to play down the tough m@@ enti@@ oning of hamas , and only in this way can he guarantee the success of forming the cabinet .
how should power be distributed ?
inter@@ n@@ ally , the biggest challenge for hamas to form a cabinet is the lack of sufficient governing experience .
an analysis in the palestinian paper , the daily , said that hamas has r@@ allied its popul@@ arity through social welfare projects , but lacks experience in governance and is closely linked with the palestinian national liberation movement ( fat@@ ah ) , which has the experience of governing .
after the election , hamas proposed establishing a relationship with fat@@ ah , and jointly forming a national coalition government , but fat@@ ah has not yet given a positive response .
whether or not fat@@ ah has become a cabinet member is different at present , and the one - sid@@ ed faction advocates participating in the new government and doing something in turn , while the other faction is willing to actively engage in the opposition parties in the legisl@@ ature .
the informed source pointed out that , persu@@ aded by ab@@ b@@ as , fat@@ ah gradually ten@@ ds to join the new government .
even so , hamas and fat@@ ah will also hold talks on the distribution of cabinet positions .
in addition , another way is to set up a legislative framework outside the party - style cabinet .
it is reported that hamas has also designed a pl@@ ate expert - type government , but the specific list is not known .
in view of the attitude of the united states and israel , the technology expert - type government is also inv@@ ari@@ ably a kind of cabinet - forming method to reduce external pressure .
according to the provisions of the palestinian " basic law , " after the new legislative yuan was s@@ wor@@ n in on 16 february , the work of nom@@ in@@ ating the premier and forming a cabinet will be completed within three to five weeks .
what course armed forces should follow ?
the weapons in hamas are another thor@@ ny issue facing the establishment of a new government .
the united states and israel have adopted a very tough attitude and resolutely demanded that hamas give up violence and refuse to take part in government and political affairs by holding a gun .
hamas leader ma@@ h@@ al stressed on 9 november that armed resistance is a strategic choice made by the organization .
the armed question actually includes the legi@@ tim@@ acy of weapons and the ownership of the armed forces .
the president said that the new government will be the first party to be elected as the legisl@@ ature through democracy and freedom , and that the armed forces of hamas have been recognized by the international community , and the same way for the leg@@ alization of its subordinate groups is to unify them into the government 's security organs .
hamas once proposed to unify all factions and the establishment of the palestinian national authority on the people 's army , but it did not receive an extensive response and was also strongly opposed by the palestinian islamic ji@@ had organization ( j@@ a@@ had ) .
palestine has more than 6@@ 0,000 security personnel , and the overwhelming majority of them come from the fat@@ ah camp .
in addition , fat@@ ah has some subordinate armed factions , which have lo@@ ose organizational relations , for example , the marty@@ r a@@ er brigade , and the ying of fat@@ ah .
the hamas , which is responsible for forming the cabinet , must hold talks with ab@@ b@@ as on how to manage these armed forces that are independent of politics and ration@@ ally distribu@@ te security management powers .
according to local media reports , ab@@ b@@ as was deliberately in charge of security and intelligence forces , police and civil defense organizations , and the interior ministry of the new government was in charge of the operation .
however , the parties are still holding consultations on this sensitive issue , and so far there is no further report .

according to the us consumer electronics association 's forecast , the sales of digital telev@@ isions in the united states will exceed that of traditional tv sets for the first time this year , while the number of digital television sets will exceed 8@@ 5 percent of them are high - resolution products .
japanese researchers develop new highly efficient human kid@@ ney
tokyo , february 13 ( xinhua ) the japanese government has decided to launch a new research project on a biological man 's kid@@ ney , which is not only compar@@ able to the kid@@ ney of human@@ s , but also has the capacity to preserve the functions of suppl@@ iers , which are also of small size and easy to trans@@ plant .
according to a report by the ni@@ k@@ ke@@ i industrial news a few days ago , the newly developed bi@@ om@@ ed@@ ical kid@@ ney is mainly composed of two parts , and part is the inci@@ d@@ ence of the fil@@ tering and water division of the late , and the other part is the selection of the kid@@ ney cr@@ ane from the original hydr@@ og@@ en di@@ agn@@ os@@ tic ac@@ id and other blood trans@@ mitted .
the others have built kid@@ ney tu@@ bes and the tu@@ bes of the my@@ ths of the middle and the tu@@ bes have been made of the my@@ ths of the inner tu@@ bes of the ur@@ y@@ n@@ xia tu@@ be .
this kind of pe@@ t@@ al cell can make many trips of diseases , and so on .
the previous human kid@@ ney inter@@ rup@@ ted the fil@@ tering of the fil@@ ter waste by relying on the difference of per@@ me@@ ation , and it did not have the ability to make ir@@ an@@ ic ac@@ id and other components return to the blood .
researchers used the mountain she@@ ep to carry out a kid@@ ney trans@@ plant experi@@ ment , and the mid - air sil@@ k w@@ ire of human - made kid@@ ney used the pi@@ g 's upper - sk@@ in cell@@ s .
two weeks later , researchers confirmed that the human - made kid@@ ney was able to function .

however , he pointed out that with the changes in the power supply and demand situation and the successive operation of large numbers of newly built power generating units , electricity safety production will face new challenges .
these challenges include : regional seas@@ onal phenomena of power shortage will still exist , and the supply and demand situation in some areas will remain too tight , and the price mechanism for coal has not been formed , leading to the relatively serious shortage of coal .
shi yu@@ bo said : as the reform of the power system deep@@ ens , many deep - se@@ ated contradictions will continue to be exposed . how to maintain the stability of the staff and workers and ensure normal production order will become new problems facing us .

south african envoy to china said that there exist some organizations that are not aimed at the criminal activities of chinese citizens
beijing , february 13 ( xinhua ) the south african government has decided to set up a temporary embassy in china in beijing on the 13@@ th to provide a visa to chinese citizens , said the chinese ambassador , fu k@@ on@@ in , who is a acting chinese citizen , during an exclusive interview .
he also said that the south african government will do all it can to crack down on all forms of criminal activities .
v@@ in@@ cent si@@ han@@ en said the south african government hopes to l@@ um@@ p the rate of crime to zero , and hopes that every for@@ eig@@ ner who works in south africa will be given full support by local laws and citizens .
since 2006 , four chinese citizens have been killed in one after another in south africa , and the world of chinese has shown extensive concern for this .
the chinese foreign ministry has already made representations to south africa and reminded chinese citizens in south africa to further enhance their awareness of security and prevention , strengthen unity and love among overseas chinese , and cooperate with the police in cracking down on criminal activities .
let us express the most sincere sympathy and condol@@ ences to the victims ' families .
fu k@@ ang@@ ning said : we are sor@@ ry about this and we also ask the chinese people to believe that the south african government is seriously investigating every case involving china .
according to the chinese embassy in south africa , the south african police have successfully cracked a case of chinese fujian woman chen jian@@ qing 's murder in south africa on 5 february , and one suspect has been arrested .
police are now hun@@ ting for another suspect .
in addition , the south african embassy in china revealed that the criminal suspect who was suspected of shooting and killing hong kong business@@ man in january this year has been arrested by south africa police , and the victim 's property has been recovered .
on the possible impact of the murder of chinese citizens , fu k@@ ang@@ ning said that these incidents indeed occurred in the depth of mutual understanding and trust between the two countries on trade and tourism and exchanges in other fields . however , judging from a long - term point of view , however , the impact should not be extensive .
the tourism commissioner of the south african embassy , n@@ ann@@ a sh@@ un@@ xi , said the embassy had provided more than 2,000 chinese visitors to south africa in the first 15 days of this year .
according to official statistics of china , south africa will continue to maintain its largest trade partner in africa in 2005 .
the bilateral trade volume reached $ 7.@@ 27 billion , up 2@@ 3.@@ 0 percent over the same period last year .
however , people in the tourism industry believe that the number of chinese citizens ' casualties in 2004 has increased significantly in the number of chinese tourists travel@@ ing to south africa .
according to statistics from the south african tourism bureau , the number of chinese tourists to south africa in the first half of 2005 was 20@@ ,@@ 3@@ 31 , a decrease of 14.@@ 9 percent over the same period last year .
at present , about 200,000 chinese people living in south africa are living in urban and rural areas in south africa .
analysts here believe that the gap between the rich and the poor in south africa is wide , the unemployment rate is high , and guns are rampant , and there is no deterr@@ ent to death penalty , so the crime rate remains high .
since many chinese do not understand english , have cash in their bodies , they are more pr@@ one to become targets of criminals seeking money .

du@@ ilin , february 17 ( xinhua ) the central government has decided to send a special envoy to the country , the central government said here today
xinhua news agency reporter gao ying
although italy has repeatedly issued orders and said that the number of people who used the stimul@@ ant during the tur@@ in winter olympic games may be faced with the my@@ ster@@ ious operation of the prison , judging from various situations , such a situation is not likely to happen in this winter olympics .
the tur@@ in winter olympic games opened on the 16@@ th , its first stimul@@ ant scand@@ al since its opening . the o@@ '@@ le@@ v was discovered and used in the illegal drug card .
the international olympic committee announced the next day that le@@ av@@ a had been exp@@ elled from the winter olympics , and the winter med@@ als she had won at this winter olympics were 15 km in the women 's 15 km individual games .
the two - day international winter season alliance made a decision on the same day on the par@@ agu@@ ay b@@ ow@@ ls ' ban for two years .
the international olympic committee has all along stipulated that athletes are found to be using stimul@@ ants at the olympic games and will be eliminated and their qualifications for the games are depriv@@ ed of the right to participate , but they are not subject to legal sanctions .
however , according to italian laws , the athletes ' carrying and using stimul@@ ants is a criminal act , and the judicial organs have the right to directly arrest and investigate the athletes using stimul@@ ants and to def@@ y the law for three months to three years .
last december , the international olympic committee and the italian government , through one year 's effort , finally reached an agreement after a year of barg@@ aining . both sides agreed to set prices on the basis of italian laws during the current winter olympic games .
with the unremitting efforts of the international olympic committee , italy made concessions four days before the opening of the winter olympic games , promising that the police would not enter the olympic village to search the athle@@ te 's residence , but the drug - tested athletes will still accept the investigation by italian procuratorial organs .
according to reports , the italian government mon@@ itors the officials of the tur@@ in winter olympics , per@@ ce@@ iv@@ an , who have already handed over the d@@ oping incident to the du@@ in procuratorate .
however , the i@@ oc and pe@@ ter k@@ ant have not confirmed the case .
russian team medical team leader ham@@ id m@@ mit@@ t@@ ov revealed at noon on the 17@@ th that le@@ v had already left du@@ in and returned to his country .
he has been a member of the chinese sports officials , shi k@@ ang@@ cheng , who has been in the world anti - d@@ oping agency for many years , believes that the matter will eventually be settled without the conclusion .
shi guangsheng said : the i@@ oc and the italian government have carried out a series of cooperation on the anti - d@@ oping of the winter , and even the italian procuratorial organs have really interven@@ ed in this affair , and it is hard to say that the result was very difficult .
according to the previous incidents of stimul@@ ant use by italian athletes , the number of illegal immigrants received by the banned is only the most severe punishment since the two years ' imprisonment was suspended for two years .
therefore , italian and@@ re@@ a 's senior reporter pi@@ er@@ re said that the possibility of sending le@@ op@@ a to j@@ ail is hardly as good as it is , at most , a fine .
pi@@ er@@ re also said that although the italian court can conduct a b@@ idd@@ le , it is impossible for the italian police to go abroad to cap@@ ture and serve the execution by sending len@@ ovo .
if a le@@ av@@ a ref@@ uses to accept the verdic@@ t , the italian side will not be able to take her .
