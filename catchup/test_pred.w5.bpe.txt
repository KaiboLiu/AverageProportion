liu le@@ fei said : looking at the long term , the amount of foreign investment in the asset allocation should be in the overall distribution of insurance companies .
however , in view of the fact that the rmb is under a greater pressure to appreciate , china mainly uses its own foreign exchange funds to make investment abroad .
in the case of foreign investment in the acquisition of foreign exchange , we should be cauti@@ ously dealt with under the present circumstances .

chin@@ ane@@ ws , july 22 c chen shui - bian questi@@ oned the taiwan judicial personnel 's attempt to interven@@ e in the taiwan region 's leadership election .
the administrative affairs office of taiwan 's armed police corps and the jin@@ chi administrative college said on the same day that the current performance of judges on the island is not in keeping with chen shui - bian 's words and demands that chen shui - bian explain this .
according to taiwan 's " z@@ ang@@ che " report , chen shui - bian questi@@ oned the judge 's bi@@ ograph@@ ical and public prosecu@@ tor on 30 june , and the impact of his involvement in political or election considerations was even attempting to influence the election activities of candidates of various parties . he said that he hoped that such a phenomenon would not exist in taiwan , but it might be very difficult .
in response to chen shui - bian 's question , the court president of taiwan 's ji@@ ao [ name as transliterated ] , who did not respond to the demand of the spring festival , secretary general fan guang@@ q@@ un , expressed his views on behalf of the judiciary .
gao jin@@ zhi said : taiwan 's basic law and the code of ethics for judges have clearly declared that judges should exceed the party and should not take part in party activities , nor should they help select judges . judges are very cautious in observing and administering justice in the country . judges of the judicial yuan believe that judges of the higher e@@ ch@@ el@@ ons are doing very well .
gao jin@@ chi pointed out that the high inci@@ d@@ ence of the chang hsi - wei [ name as transliterated ] school in kaohsiung [ ga@@ o@@ xiong ] was the result of the party 's col@@ ors in the course of the school , which was formed by the party and the judge .

germany to lower the thre@@ sh@@ old for the introduction of specialized personnel
the first day of the exercise , the first of its kind , the first day of the year , was held in ber@@ lin .
german minister of education and scientific research s@@ ay@@ y@@ man said recently that germany should lower the burden of " the law " on bringing in foreign specialized personnel , and increase the investment in foreign talents by increasing the introduction of foreign talents .
according to the o@@ ec@@ d report , germany 's population aged 15 to 64 is estimated to grow by about one - third year .
if there is no sufficient immigration , by 20@@ :@@ 00 , the labor force in germany will be 6 percent less than the present .
however , the german federation of employers , the german association of engine@@ ers , and other organizations reported that in germany 's labor market , engine@@ er and technical personnel of engine@@ er han@@ z@@ y have become even bigger .
the german federal labor bureau said that in may this year , the german labor market 's engine@@ er supply of por@@ k was 1.@@ 27 million , and the number of technicians who provided aid to 9@@ 60 people .
germany has also adopted a series of measures to protect its own employment and to attract foreign talent .
the german " z@@ ai@@ z@@ un " stipulates that the professional personnel of non - eu countries are not able to enjoy a high degree of political immun@@ ity in germany , or they cannot obtain the right to work or residence in germany .
sha wan proposed to reduce the quota to the existing rate of the currency .
the theory of super@@ sti@@ tion and law enforcement
the draft amendment to the law on lawyers , which was submitted to the npc standing committee for deliberation , stipulates : those who have engaged in legal research and teaching , and who have high - level education or other specialized personnel , who have applied for a higher - level education , and who have been admitted to the law and administrative department of the state council , may be allowed to practi@@ se as a law@@ yer .
( 28 june , " china commentary " )
there are many theoretical circles and the reality of the times in which the theory is being carried out , and the former mainly includes legal teaching and research work , such as the teaching and research work , and the latter is engaging in more legal consultation and legal services , including the operation of the law - making consul@@ ting and legal services , and so on .
for a long time , the theory of the law and the practice of the times have exist@@ ed in the literary circles , and the theory of the times , which holds that the theory of the times lacks necessary cl@@ ues for the mechanical industry , and it is only the cl@@ an of the whe@@ el of mechan@@ ics , and the cl@@ an of the circles of the circles that criticize the theory of the times is the theory of guiding the practice of the theory of the times .
with regard to this kind of division of labor , what the law can do is to maintain it , not to support any one party with its own bit@@ ter@@ ness .
however , the current situation of the proposed " law of law " is obj@@ ectively recognized by law .
in fact , some people who engage in the history of the legal system and international laws and other purely theoretical research and teaching , and their theory is deep and deep in their hearts , and they also share the same responsibility with the law .
thus , the operation of the armed police undoubtedly provides the legal system and the right to make public the status of those who are engaged in the work of the law .
the red army 's super@@ sti@@ ti@@ ous belief in the theoretical circle is not just limited to these , for example , the experts ' and experts ' argu@@ ments will often affect or even rej@@ ect the court verdic@@ t , and this is also the direct expression of this kind of super@@ sti@@ tion .

britain cu@@ ts its troops in terror attacks
the reporter learned from the beijing military region that the pla units stationed in the guangzhou military region have been conducting a joint exercise of the " blue army " in the past .
the british government has also ordered the attack of the highest - ranking government to the lowest level , and this shows that the british terrorist attack will not happen soon , but the attacks remain extremely likely .
at present , the british police have shif@@ ted the investigation scope to india and australia .
since the eight terrorist attacks suspects arrested were all medical and health care , the government will provide necessary assistance to those who enter the medical system .
it is learned that nearly 50 percent of the work of the british public medical system was done overseas .
the prime minister also called for the protection of the ph@@ ased background of high - tech immigrants , and the employers or relevant organizations would be asked to provide background information .
the p@@ air of the business people is not too much .
the tourism industry is sl@@ ack@@ ening the efforts of the qing dynasty and the fresh flowers are enjoying the natural and social civilization as much as possible .
however , many people are not able to come to china .
both cars and tr@@ ains , and vehicles , the general car owners must meet with small businesses and some un@@ certified intermedi@@ aries .
it is not selling fl@@ esh - and - blood - bur@@ n journal , which is selling newspapers and peri@@ o@@ dic@@ als , and introducing many of the restaurant - related cat@@ al@@ ks and even the false travel documents and travel documents .
if you do n't accept it , he can catch several hundred meters of your body , and if it is very un@@ successful , it will become a ben@@ evol@@ ent force .
in some of the hot and cold areas , many of them have the same feelings .
if you do n't enter the door , people will come to visit your home and your sou@@ th@@ western and sou@@ th@@ western stuf@@ f .
after entering the door , this situation became more .
some media reported that the number of foreign tourists coming to xian is still low .
the station 's operation of the red army , including the ro@@ tation of the red army , should be regarded as an orderly place and should be kept in harmony with the civilization and harmony .
the freedom of the traders and the distur@@ b@@ ance of the mind of the people are not said , obj@@ ectively destroying these public order , forming a social order that causes pollution and pollution , and at the same time , providing valuable spiritual wealth for the re@@ education of the marty@@ rs .
what is important is that these are the window for the development of spiritual civilization in the loc@@ ality , and the damage is not only the image issue , but also the impact on the local economic development .
just think , if you want to make a big and powerful tourism industry , you will use this kind of chao@@ tic tourism environment to meet the demands of the guests from the south and the north , who will come ?
your tourism economy has achieved economic results again ?
with the arrival of the peak tourist season , the tourist attr@@ actions in the south and the north will create a civilized tourist environment . it should be said that the pressing task is to be to create a civilized tourist environment .
the red army is not the market , and the small business haw@@ kers should be regul@@ ated and their business without license must be resolutely eliminated . illegal activities should be resolutely cracked down .
a civilized and orderly environment can enable the people to feel happy and to do their best and to return to the motherland .
in a word , do n't let businessmen come to trouble ?
the red army 's active re@@ treat and re@@ war@@ ding of the red army ;
the construction of dong@@ cheng district in beijing has provided preferential treatment to the residents of ji@@ ash@@ i prefecture , which is the first to give their personal bel@@ ong@@ ings to 12 households .
( " xin@@ jing bao " , july 10 )
i am very happy to see the improvement of these families ' lives , but i am very happy about the idea of returning home with the initiative and the practice of re@@ war@@ ding the pr@@ izes with the pr@@ izes .
deputy director of the ji@@ ash@@ i neighbor@@ hood office said : in view of such problems as che@@ ating and maintaining low security , we should encourage the people to take the initiative to make sure that they are safe for other low - income households .
if this model is to encourage other low - income employees to make their own efforts to get rid of their difficulties , it is indeed worth advocating , and if they want to use this to express their gratitude for the long - term s@@ wind@@ ling of low - income people , they are not exemp@@ t from doing so .
in the process of differ@@ enti@@ ating between different categories and clean@@ ing up the poor households , it is more dependent on the law .
relevant departments should strengthen the protection of low - income households and ensure that they are entitled to the minimum - guaranteed period : if they promptly report on the changes in family members and income , report on the employment situation , and accept peri@@ od@@ ic re@@ examination , the relevant departments should intensify supervision and inspection .
after all , the support of the people in accordance with the law is the long - term plan .
the street has a long history of re@@ wards for the family of those who have been bur@@ ied ?
the neighbor@@ hood is a primary government organization , and its expenditure is borne by financial appropri@@ ations .
the money of the tax@@ pay@@ er should not be used .
on the one hand , with@@ drawing from the low - income families has proved that they have a certain degree of self - suffici@@ ency capability , while on the other hand , the number of people applying for low - income guarantees is not there .
the " government finance minister " , which is called the fund for saving lives , should be given the car@@ bon in the snow rather than add flowers to the br@@ oc@@ ade .
liu said that he was willing to be a service provid@@ er .
on 10 july , the first public candidate in the country put forward a proposal of the " red army " in mu@@ lan village of the w@@ ud@@ ang district , after taking office , for the fourth time , he accepted democracy and a high rate of satisfaction , reaching 9@@ 7.@@ 7 percent .
when reporters met liu and exchanged views with liu , liu said that he was a member of the b@@ m@@ p service .
( yesterday 's " xin@@ jing bao " )
liu xi@@ u@@ yi 's service workers may be more active than some cadres who appoint them .
the public appointment system is the largest system in comparison with the system of direct elections , and the former is mainly composed of ordinary party members and masses who decide the source of power . the latter is mainly composed of the upper - level organization and the source of power , and the former has decided that the former must as@@ sign the responsibility to the people first .
the source of power and the responsibility for whom are determined by how the elected person will carry out his work .
some people doubt the democratic pl@@ ain of this kind of democracy , like a democratic show .
my view is that with such democracy , the people 's republic of china is better than the traditional culture .
considering the fact that the building of democracy at the grass - roots level in china and the current situation , i believe that the open election is a major breakthrough , and that democracy is a major component part of this , it is of great significance to promoting the building of democracy at the grass - roots level .
india is expected to select first female presidential analy@@ st to be elected as the president , and female voters hope that it will raise women 's status .
on 23 june , under the guidance of the presidential document , the bi@@ ograph@@ ical mon@@ ument of the president was a piece of red army .
indian presidential election began on 19 july , and the new president will be elected under the leadership of current vice president j@@ as@@ want car@@ at and the not - long re@@ signed president j@@ as@@ want pan@@ ama and the aw@@ es@@ ome cl@@ an .
the p@@ aw@@ n is the first female presidential candidate in india 's history . if she is elected , she will become the first female president of india 's han@@ oi .
the p@@ aw@@ n is the presidential candidate of the ruling party 's congress , and ch@@ av@@ al@@ it is from the opposition party 's people 's party .
because the national congress party has a strong point in the presidential election , the media and the people have successively w@@ av@@ ed their hopes and the possibility of being elected is quite high .
p@@ aul par@@ ag@@ il@@ a , 72 , is a female state head .
her law@@ yer and her husband entered the congress with rich experience , and she was a member of the ra@@ j@@ is@@ bon state during her term of office .
she also worked for social welfare , and was a model of education and social welfare organizations .
analysts pointed out that the reason why p@@ aul became a candidate was because she unswervingly pr@@ ayed for the support of indian national party chairman s@@ onia g@@ and@@ hi .
in india , the g@@ and@@ an family has been controlling the national congress party , which has been in power for a long time .
after being hit by a large number of female voters , the female voters believed that p@@ aw@@ n would be able to win the support of the women 's image of india , a country with a serious sense of discrimination , and to enhance women 's status .
the constitution stipulates that india is a federal state and the president is the head of state and commander of the federal government , and does not represent any party organization , and more of them represent a symb@@ ol .

for this reason , they adopted the method of concentrated training and using the experience of the local party school training to train specialized armed forces cadres on a regular basis , and worked hard to solve the narrow - minded operational quality of specialized armed forces cadres .

the first thing is to do good things well .
from the outcome of the competition alone , the two - plus - two score is reasonable , and also the one that can be accepted . the key is the process of the competition , how many people feel regret .
if the iranian team is 2 - 0 , then the score will be equ@@ alized , then it will be the feeling of china that is not the same , and it will be very long and the morale of the troops will be the opposite of the situation .
the good will cannot be done in the end , and one can say that it is a problem .
the red tide often occur@@ s under the condition of un@@ usual condition , and the views of ordinary people are the mentality of china 's psychological quality .
this is indeed a kind of un@@ usual thing that cannot be seen as a result of the hard work .
however , judging from today 's competition , it seems that the competition is not as good as it is .
sun ji@@ hai , sun xi@@ xiang , and ji@@ xi zheng zhi@@ hui , a man who played the ball in europe , did not say that li wei and others were also the " s@@ and - forth " veteran who had been living there . they saw the broad knowledge and had a low psychological quality .
the re@@ mor@@ se was forced by the iranian team , and the reason was probably because of the deployment of troops in the battle .
the iranian team , under the back@@ war@@ dness , was two and the scene was immediately aw@@ a@@ iting .
the second half of the game was named after three " red army " members .
overcome the difficulties of being in@@ capable of doing things well , and accurately identify the root cause of problems .
as long as problems are accurately identified and the methods for correc@@ ting the existing problems are probably not difficult to find .
they are afraid that they will be sent to the hospital for medical treatment .
if this is done , the fl@@ ock will be k@@ ic@@ ked up more , and the old fa@@ ult will be left , and the talks will not be able to be expected to be further k@@ ic@@ ked .
