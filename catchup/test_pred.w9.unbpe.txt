chinanews , july 30
according to a report by china securities news , the " provisional measures for managing foreign investment in insurance funds " were promulgated a few days ago , and insurance funds have a broader scope for using the capital market .
liu lefei , chief investment officer of china 's stock company , believes that the appreciation of the rmb and the improvement of the domestic capital market will not be possible for insurance organizations to invest overseas on a large scale in the near future , and this also means that the buying of domestic capital will not be diverted to the domestic stock market in the short term .
the report said that many insurance companies hold the same views .
experts said that since the market for renminbi products is not yet available , insurance organizations do not have sufficient risk evasion measures , so the time for large - scale purchases of foreign currencies is not ripe .
liu lefei said : in the long run , with regard to the allocation of assets , foreign investment should be a certain percentage of the overall allocation of insurance companies .
however , given the greater pressure of appreciation for the renminbi , china will mainly use its own foreign exchange funds to invest overseas .
as for overseas investment in foreign exchange purchases , we should be cautious in the current situation .

the labor bureau of germany said that the number of engineers in the labor market in germany last may was about 127,000 , and the technicians supplied about 9,600 .
germany has been trying to protect its own people in employment and has set a higher threshold for introducing foreign talent .
the law of germany stipulates that professional personnel of non - eu countries are not less than 85,000 euros in germany , otherwise they cannot get jobs and residence permits in germany .
he suggested that the limits be reduced to one - fifth of the size of the population .
do not superstitious law and theories
the " law of lawyers " , which was recently submitted to the npc standing committee for deliberation , stipulates that lawyers who have engaged in professional work such as legal research and teaching , and who have advanced or similar professional levels , should apply for the legal profession and should be examined and approved by the judicial administration department of the state council .
( china 's " sui " on 28 june )
in law , there are great theoretical boundaries and boundless boundaries of practical affairs , the former mainly includes the law teaching and research work , etc. , while the latter is more active in legal proceedings , legal enacting laws , services , and other concrete behaviors , such as legal consulting laws .
for a long time , the law has evolved into a trail of human civilization , along with the human civilization , and the theory of socialism has maintained that the need to be enlied in the practical affairs , and the lack of necessary mechanics , and is only the legalist of the law , and the great spirit of the war of resistance against theoretical exploration in the development of the theory of the orthodox , which is not practical .
the law can do a good job of maintaining a boundless law and not a law that supports any one .
however , the practice of regarding lawyers as a law for human expedition has objectively recognized the law of law , and the law of law is more like a law of practical affairs than a law .
in fact , some people , such as the law of international law and others , are purely theoretical research and teaching , and their theory study and practice are all along in line with law .
in this way , the law of the buddha in the law of the law , without doubt , has created an extremely bad phenomenon that affects extremely bad things like the cave - ins .
superstition in the theoretical circles is not confined to these , such as arguments by experts and experts , which often affects or even rejects court verdicts , and this is also the direct manifestation of superstition .

do n't let traders tired .
the tourist chart is a selfish culture that is seldom loaded with green , enjoying natural and social civilization to the greatest extent .
but , when traveling in china , many people have encountered such a kind of worry , and they are already enclosed by traders and intermediary businesses .
whether it is cars or trains , or vehicles , one will always have to encounter death from small traders and irrefutable intermediaries .
it is not selling buddha sprawling cakes , it is selling newspapers and periodicals , and there are many unverified cakes , even false documents , etc.
if you do not accept it , he can chase you several hundred meters , and if you are not successful , you will become benevolent .
many things are similarly affected in some temples .
before entering the gate , some people came to inspect things and narrow things like children and children .
after entering the door , this situation will be even more frequent , and even if it is good , yarxing is also stifled and has to be too much to taste .
according to a media report , many foreign tourists who went to xian were untouching in the ancient guizhou temple , but they were very interested in allowing more peddlers to come back and forth to sell them .
such phenomena as the + suck of the river , the bigoon , and the nauru , should be characterized by orderly civilization , quiet and harmonious harmony , and should be brought to a width environment .
the free flow of commodities , the havana of the sellers , and the wrecking of the public order objectively , have formed a benign environment for pollution and environmental pollution , and at the same time , it provides conditions and opportunities for pollution .
what is important is that these + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + +
just imagine , if you want to become a strong tourist industry , you can use this kind of an irregular tourism environment to welcome the south - to - north guests . who will come ? who will dare to come ?
how can your tourism economy achieve economic benefits ?
with the arrival of the peak tourist season , it will create a civilized tourism environment for tourists from the northern part of the country . this should be said a pressing task at the moment .
the spell is not the market , and the operation of small traders should be standardized , and unlicensed operations should be resolutely abolished . illegal activities should be resolutely dealt with .
only by a civilized and orderly environment can we make ourselves happy and make ourselves flourish and reprosper .
in a naive , do n't let traders go by trouble .
impulse the country 's economic development
in the eastern district of beijing , the construction of a rural area with electric products such as grain distribution is regarded as an award for 12 households that voluntarily surrender their insurance benefits .
( beijing news , july 10 )
i am pleased to see the improvement of these families ' living conditions but have taken the initiative to protect their own wordings , and also have the practice of giving awards .
deputy director of jian'an neighborhood office said that in view of the problem of cheating and minimum security , encouraging the active refund of poor households is an example for other households .
this example is to encourage other undercover personnel to extricate themselves from their difficulties through their own efforts . if this is to get some inspiration from those old people who have long been cheated by deception , it is unavoidable that some naive people are willing to do so .
in the course of differentiating and cleaning up low - income households , it is more dependent on the law .
relevant departments should strengthen the protection of the rights and interests of low - income households when enjoying the minimum allowable insurance benefits : such as promptly reporting the changes in family personnel and income , reporting on the employment situation , and receiving periodic review , etc. , and the departments concerned should step up supervision and inspection .
after all , the practice of retreating from a stalk in accordance with the law is a long - term plan .
the neighborhood rewards the families who have retained insurance will be paid from whom ?
as a first - level government organization , its expenditures are borne by the treasury .
the money of the + + + + + + + + + + + taxpayers should not be spent ?
on the one hand , the withdrawal from the minimum guarantee family proves that it has a certain degree of autonomy in providing aid for people , while on the other hand , does n't the application for low protection still exist ?
the government 's financial appropriation , which is called a life - saving money , should be used to provide charcoal in the snow instead of adding flowers to the golden sky .
liu gangyi 's remark is even more significant in his service .
on 10 july , the first democratically elected town , benggu district , xindu district , qilan town , wudi county , china was elected as the first city in the country .
in the dialogue between the press and liu gangyi , liu gangyi defined himself as a nail service for people .
( beijing news , yesterday )
the people of china may be more vigorous and impartial than some cadres appointed by the reform of administrative system .
the biggest obstacle in the system of appointment by public election is the fact that the former is mainly determined by ordinary party members and masses , and the latter is mainly appointed by upper - level organizations , and the direction of the source of power determines that the former must assign first responsibility to the people .
the source of power and the responsibility to whom are the fundamental factors determining how the person will carry out his work .
some people question such a democratic approach , like a democratic revolution , even more like a democratic revolution .
my view is that there is such a form of democratic expedition , which is better than that .
considering the history and current situation of the building of grass - roots democracy in china , i think the election of public servants is a major breakthrough , democratic development is an important component part of the effort to promote the building of grass - roots democracy .
india expected to choose first female president , which says it is quite likely that the election will be a rather significant one , and female voters hope it will raise the status of women .
on 23 june , in front of the presidential candidate documents , ten pieces were written in the strip of green .
the curtain will be raised on the 19th for the indian presidential election . the new president will be elected by the current vice president , shevardnadze , and the recently resigned state of the rajasthan state .
pansuke is the first female presidential candidate in the history of india . if she is elected , she will become india 's first female president .
pager is the ruling party 's national congress party presidential candidate , while shevardnadat is from the opposition people 's party .
since the congress party holds a dominant position in the presidential election , the media and the people are eager to get elected , the possibility of being elected is quite great .
the 72 - year - old pagoda is the female governor of lazazhar state .
she 's a lawyer , a naichi , rich experience in the congress , and she was warmly welcomed by the government when she was serving as a state of lajasthan .
she also worked for social welfare , and is a model of education and social welfare organizations .
analysts pointed out that the reason paimpine became a candidate was because she unswervingly bandwidened indian national congress party chairman sonia gandhi .
in india , the gandhi clan family has long controlled the ruling national congress party .
pager has been supported by a large number of female voters , and the female voters believe that paragus will become a female fairy fairchild in india where the concept of women is seriously discriminated against .
the constitution stipulates that india is a federal state under the name of the president and head of state , and is in command , not in any party , but in most cases a symbol .
