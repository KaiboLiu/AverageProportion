liu le@@ fei , chief investment officer of china securities company , said that the rmb appreciation and the domestic capital market are good , and that insurance institutions will not invest in foreign exchange in a large scale in the short term , and this also means that the purchase of domestic stock market funds will not be diverted to other parts of the country in the near future .
the report said that many insurance companies hold the same views .
experts said that since there is no renminbi market for insurance companies , the means of insurance institutions to avoid insurance are not adequate , the time for large - scale purchase of foreign exchange is not yet ri@@ pe .
liu le@@ fei said : in terms of asset allocation over a long period of time , foreign investment should account for a certain proportion of the overall allocation of insurance companies .
however , in view of the greater pressure on renminbi appreciation , china will mainly use its own foreign exchange funds to make investment abroad .
as for overseas investment in overseas investment , we should be cautious in the current circumstances .

according to taiwan 's " ying@@ fan " report , chen shui - bian on 30 june questi@@ oned a judge or a investig@@ ator who was involved in a mis@@ appropri@@ ation of candidates for the election because of political factors or election considerations , and even attempted to influence or even influence the election activities of various political parties . he said he hoped that this phenomenon would not exist in taiwan , but it might be extremely difficult .

gao jin@@ zhi said : the fundamental law and the code of conduct of judges are pro@@ claimed that judges should go beyond the party , and they should not participate in party activities , nor should they be able to help them . judges are very cautious in observing the restrictions of judges in court and are good at doing their work .
gao jin@@ zhi pointed out : the supreme court judge zhang sheng@@ xi who was a judge of the kaohsiung branch of the supreme people 's court who attended the course of the k@@ and@@ ah@@ ar school several years ago , that is , because of the political party color of the relevant curriculum , the decision of the self - discipline committee formed by judges was taken against the decision .

germany to reduce import of professional talent
the " blue force " of the " red army " was established in the early morning of 1 july .
german minister of education and scientific research sh@@ al@@ an said a few days ago that germany should reduce the restrictions on the import of foreign professional personnel in the " law " and , through increasing the import of foreign talent , solve the problem of specialized talent facing germany .
according to the o@@ ec@@ d report , germany 's labor force aged 15 to 64 will decrease year by year .
if there is no sufficient migr@@ ation , germany 's labor force will be reduced by 60 percent compared with the present .
however , the german federation of employers and the german engine@@ er association have reported that in germany 's current labor market , engine@@ ers are rather competent in professional skills .
according to statistics from the german federal labor bureau , in may this year , about 4@@ 00,000 german engine@@ ers were suppl@@ ied in the labor market , and some 9@@ ,@@ 600 people were suppl@@ ied by technicians .
germany is a country that has established a relatively high thre@@ sh@@ old for protecting its own people 's employment and for introducing foreign talent .
germany 's " law of shi " stipulates that the professional personnel of non - eu countries are not less than 8.@@ 5@@ 50 million in germany , otherwise they cannot obtain permission to work and residence in germany .
sha wan suggested that the limit be lowered to the level of sw@@ ine .
do not take super@@ sti@@ tion of law and law to study
the " law on solic@@ itors " , which was recently submitted to the npc standing committee for deliberation , has been revised , stipul@@ ating : those who had engaged in professional work such as legal research and teaching , and who have a higher level of professional knowledge like either cri@@ tics or the same professi@@ ons , who applied for lawyers ' practi@@ sing , and who have been examined and approved by the judicial administration of the state council , may be allowed to practi@@ se their profession .
( " china 's fo@@ g " on 28 june )
in the law , there are theoretical elements and intr@@ ins@@ ic elements , which mainly include legal teaching and research work , such as gen@@ e@@ tic acts , and the latter is more engaged in li@@ tig@@ ation legal consul@@ ting service , etc. the latter is engaged in legal consul@@ ting service , etc.
for a long time , the law has been a theoretical cl@@ ue of people and a law - based theory is a phenomenon that is not easy to see . the theory circle holds that the need to be a master in the field of practical affairs is only a type of mechan@@ ized warfare , a type of leg@@ alism , and a type of people who are engaged in the field of study and practice is a theoretical guide for practice .
the law can do a good job in this way of division of labor , not in support of any party .
however , the legal system of lawyers is a system of coun@@ tless law@@ yer , but obj@@ ectively recogn@@ izes that legal theory is higher than legal practice , and that it is better to judge the law .
in fact , some people who engage in research and teaching p@@ ure theories such as the history of legal system , are still in a deep and deep level with the law .
in this way , the law - based legal system is un@@ avo@@ idable , and the status of law - based legal profession has become chao@@ tic .
super@@ sti@@ tion in the theoretical circle is not the only in this way , such as verification by experts and experts , often affect or even rej@@ ect the verdic@@ t of the court , and this is also a direct manif@@ estation of this super@@ sti@@ tion .

britain cu@@ ts terrorist attacks
london , july 5 ( staff reporter guo lin )
the british government has lowered the level of terrorist attacks from the highest level to the level of serious ter@@ ri@@ fication , indicating that british terrorist attacks will not occur , but attacks may still be very likely to be sw@@ oll@@ en .
at present , the british police have shif@@ ted the scope of the investigation to india and australia .
the eight suspects arrested were all working in the medical system and the government will take necessary measures to deal with the background of foreign immigrants who had entered the medical system .
it is reported that nearly one - third of the people working in britain 's public health system are qualified to receive medical treatment overseas .
the prime minister also called for a survey of the background of high - tech migr@@ ation , and employers or relevant organizations will be asked to provide back@@ grounds for their presence .
do n't let traders get imp@@ ati@@ ent
the scen@@ ery of the sea is a process of relaxation and self - reliance , and to the greatest extent it enjoys the fruits of natural and social civilization .
however , when travel@@ ing in china , many people have encountered such a kind of worry , and they are being attacked by businesses and deal@@ ers and doing intermedi@@ ary business .
whether it is a vehicle or a train , it is always necessary to meet with small traders and some non - veri@@ fied intermedi@@ aries .
it is not selling pe@@ pp@@ er c@@ akes , it is selling newspapers and peri@@ o@@ dic@@ als , and then it is a case of many non - auth@@ en@@ tic intermedi@@ aries introducing food , even like inf@@ ant and c@@ akes .
if you do not accept it , he can ch@@ ase you several hundred meters , and if you are not successful , you will become ben@@ evol@@ ent .
in some scen@@ ic areas , many we@@ eds and n@@ ails also have the same feeling .
before entering the door , some people came to travel and sle@@ ep in a small country .
after entering the door , this situation will be more , and the good y@@ xing will also be re@@ bu@@ f@@ fed and un@@ certain .
there were reports in the media that many foreign tourists who visited xi@@ '@@ an were not at all present visiting the ancient sil@@ k mon@@ ument in xi@@ '@@ an , but they were not happy to see the many small mer@@ ch@@ ant pe@@ d@@ d@@ d@@ lers who had been allowed to re@@ ap their stocks again and again .
including the w@@ alls of the station , the type of mountain , the type of mountain , the place where the mountain is covered , should be civilized , calm and harmonious , and should give a green and toler@@ ant environment to the people .
the free of the sel@@ lers , the fear of the confu@@ sion in their heart , obj@@ ectively under@@ mining these public order and forming a cont@@ am@@ inated and environmental pollution , and at the same time providing support for the aid of aid provided by the aid of the conditions and opportunities .
the important thing is that these spir@@ its are the wind@@ ows of the building of local spiritual civilization , and the damage is not only a question of image , but also will also affect local economic development .
just imag@@ ine , if you want to be a big tourist industry , you use such a big and big tourist environment to welcome the out@@ bound guests coming to the south and going to the north . who will dare to come ?
how can your tourism economy yield benefits ?
with the arrival of the peak tourist season , a civilized tourist environment will be created for tourists from the north of ti@@ en nan . it should be said that the pressing task is now .
it is not the market , and the operation of small traders should be standardized , and the operation of unlicensed haw@@ kers should be resolutely canc@@ elled , and illegal activities should be resolutely dealt with .
only a civilized and orderly environment can make one happy and live in peace and prosperity and return .
in a word , do n't want traders to be imp@@ ati@@ ent .
they are not able to re@@ treat from the military
in the building of jian@@ shi street in dong@@ cheng district , beijing , it used electric sh@@ oes and other items as a reward for the low - income families who volun@@ t@@ arily re@@ pat@@ ri@@ ated to 12 households .
( " xin@@ jing bao " ) 10 july
i am happy to see the improvement of the lives of these families but i am happy to see the sw@@ inging of the old formul@@ a of giving out the support , but i am still living in a fr@@ ag@@ ile state of mind .
deputy director of the jian@@ du office said that in view of such problems as che@@ ating and keeping low security , encouraging active re@@ par@@ ations is an example for other low - income households .
this model should be used to encourage other under@@ cover personnel to extr@@ icate themselves from their predic@@ ament through their own efforts , and should be encouraged to see those who have long been che@@ ated and che@@ ated by means of these means , it is un@@ necessary to be n@@ ai@@ ve .
in the course of differ@@ enti@@ ating and clearing up low - income households , the law is the most depend@@ able .
the departments concerned should strengthen the protection of the low - income households in their obligations when enjoying the minimum insurance system : for example , they should promptly report on the changes in family personnel and income , report on the employment situation , and accept peri@@ od@@ ical review , and relevant departments should intensify their supervision and inspection .
after all , it is a long - term plan to re@@ treat the country according to law .
the street ad@@ mits bon@@ ded families to those who are engaged in the form of incen@@ tives ?
neighbor@@ hood is a government organization at the first level , and its expenditure is to be borne by fiscal appropri@@ ations .
the money of a serv@@ ant should not be spent .
on the one hand , the withdrawal from the low - income families prov@@ es that they have a certain ability to defend themselves and are ready to do so , and on the other hand , do they still have the personnel who apply for low - income insurance ?
the government appropri@@ ations , which are called the money - saving funds , should be used to provide disaster relief , rather than to add flowers to the br@@ oc@@ ade .
liu gang@@ yi 's willingness to serve the service is even more obvious .
on 10 july , the first public figure in china to elect a directly elected secretary of the town of mu@@ lan town , xin@@ du district , was elected by the fourth democratic vote in his capacity as the leader of the new government . the rate of satisfaction reached 9@@ 7.@@ 7 percent for the fourth time after he took office .
in a dialogue with liu , liu said that liu , as a permanent member of the un security council , has made himself a part of the world 's largest human resources .
( new jing bao )
liu gang@@ yi 's serving in a service may be more like a few cadres appointed by the system , and the service members may be more real than those appointed by the system .
the biggest obstacle to the system of public promotion than direct election is the primary decision made by ordinary party members to determine the source of power , and the latter mainly by the higher - level organizations , and the direction of the source of power , which determin@@ es that the former must put the people in the first place .
the source of power and the responsibility to whoever is responsible is the fundamental factor in determining how the person will be elected .
some people doubt that such democratic revolution is like a democratic revolution .
my view is that there are such democratic forms , and that is better than that .
in view of the history and current situation of the building of grass - roots democracy in china , i believe that the promotion of public elections is a major breakthrough , and democracy is an important component part of the effort to promote the building of grass - roots democracy .

analysts pointed out that the reason why p@@ aw@@ n became a candidate was because she unswervingly st@@ uck to the position of chairman of the national congress party of india , s@@ onia g@@ and@@ hi .
in india , the gu@@ and@@ ang family has long controlled the ruling national congress party .

the us defense department re@@ considered the plan to reduce us military presence in europe
an official of the us defense department said on the 23@@ rd that due to the war in iraq and the changes in the world situation , the us defense department is re@@ considering a plan to reduce the number of us troops stationed in europe by about half .
the us media quoted an official of the department of defense as saying that because the iraq war is still going on and the relations between the united states and russia and iran are deterior@@ ating , the department of defense has raised questions about the feasibility of reducing the european garrison plan .
at that time , secretary of defense rumsfeld announced that the united states would send its troops to europe by 20@@ 12 from the original 11.@@ 0 to 7.@@ 45 , so as to build a small force that can hardly withstand the pressure of war .
at present , the total us military strength in europe has already been reduced to a level of th@@ ugs .
however , in june this year , us european command commander do@@ k submitted a report to current defense minister , asking questions about the above reduction plan .
the report said that while the us military in europe is reducing its military strength , many troops are shif@@ ted to combat in turn in iraq and afghanistan , causing the shortage of us troops stationed in europe and unable to cooperate with the european allies in a normal manner .
the report sugg@@ ests that the reduction of us forces in europe be stopped .
a relevant us expert maintained that the above phenomena show that the war in iraq has been going on and the us military 's original readjustment plans have been disrup@@ ted .

three major functions of modern military uni@@ forms
the first is the identification function .
the military , armed forces , and the people of different countries are different from each other 's military .
in the military of more than 100 countries , although the use of military uni@@ forms is basically the same , there are no armed forces of any two countries , and there is no military uni@@ form .
second , symbol@@ ic functions .
to a certain extent , military uni@@ forms are not only a reflection of the national spirit of a country , but also a reflection of the fighting capabilities of a country 's armed forces .
in the three places of military uni@@ form , the three major categories of military uni@@ forms can best demonstrate their combat skills and capabilities of fighting against enemies , and can best demonstrate their fighting spirit .
third , the function of protecting the environment .
with the rapid development of new and high - tech weapons and equipment , the comprehensive protection function of new - type combat uni@@ forms has become a strong defense system with protective scre@@ ens , and a powerful weapon for the armed forces to guard against radi@@ ation from chemical warfare and to diver@@ t ther@@ m@@ al ther@@ m@@ al air of we@@ t ther@@ m@@ al ther@@ m@@ al air to pan@@ or@@ am@@ ic air , and so on , has become the primary issue in the development of military uni@@ form .
( shi wei )
the party committee organs of a certain unit have been able to handle the problem of being afraid of the truth .
chengdu , july 3
qu ru@@ iz@@ hen reported that we could live in a mountain and benefit from the party committee 's organs .
today , more than 10 cadres of a communications training regiment of the chengdu military region are happy to see one by one . they are happy to see that the party committee of the large team has the courage to solve problems by over@@ coming difficulties , and they are full of admir@@ ation and admir@@ ation for their enthusiasm and hard work style .
several years ago , with the personnel 's living in the unit 's house of houses , the unit 's house was un@@ covered and occupied , causing difficulties in the housing of cadres in the service , and the officers and soldiers had a relatively big opinion about this .
the group also had several times to clear up the housing , and all had not been able to resolve the problem because of various resistance .
if you dare to be honest , you will not be able to resolve your difficulties .
after reaching a consensus on the new party committee , the principal leaders began to study all problems related to housing occupation .
on the one hand , they are like a cl@@ ue , and hope that relevant personnel will be able to speak about the economic development of the military 's shel@@ tered houses and the relevant policies and regulations , which show that the party committee 's firm determination and principled stand are firm .
for those who do not want to go un@@ checked and do not want to re@@ treat from their houses , party committees and institutions have timely contact with the units they are in , and take corresponding measures to urge them to take the initiative to cooperate with the work of the military .
after two months of detailed work , all those who violated regulations and over@@ took their houses were moved on schedule , and all the working cadres of the group were assigned to houses according to regulations .
the party committee of the unit has the courage to do solid work , and has also produced a sti@@ f@@ f effect . it has been learned that the several cadres who were unwilling to actively cooperate with the organization in the past have now expressed one after another their subordin@@ ation to the organization and decision .

pla daily reports on pla air force 's 7 th army uni@@ form desig@@ ner
on july 13 , this newspaper , beijing , a reporter from yang bao@@ jin , liu xin@@ xin reported that starting 1 august , the whole army will be successively re@@ shu@@ f@@ fled to seven military uni@@ forms .
tonight , the chinese military ne@@ ts specially invited military experts to be invited by chen jun , deputy director of the armament bureau , and senior engine@@ er of the military equipment institute of the foot needed equipment research institute , su yang , a guest of the chinese military network , to join the newly born military uni@@ form with ne@@ tiz@@ ens inside and outside the military , and to create an e@@ ch@@ o among the ne@@ tiz@@ ens .
the two guests are the direct research and development of the 07 type of military uni@@ form .
speaking of the changes in the new uni@@ form , they said that the 07 - type military uni@@ form service is a special 97 - type military service base , which is designed on the 97 - type military uni@@ form base , and is equipped with seven types of combat methods , such as the series of fr@@ ame and fr@@ ame - type military uni@@ forms , etc. , have been improved by as many as several hundred .
the most important characteristic of the 07 - type military uni@@ form is that it reflects the requirement of becoming phys@@ ically capable of fighting and fighting , and that our military uni@@ form has reached the level of coordinating the three armed services for the first time , and sig@@ ni@@ fies that the level of military uni@@ form construction in our military has reached a historical leap .
the two guests also exchanged views on the varie@@ ties of new military uni@@ forms , such as the pan@@ chen of the new military uni@@ form , and other issues with ne@@ tiz@@ ens .
this time , the war was fought by the chinese military network and the new wave ne@@ ts in china .
jing@@ jiang city people 's armed forces platform increases quality of professionals
the pla general political department held a discussion meeting on the " outline of the 10th five - year plan for the development of the western region " on 18 june with the assistance of lu yu@@ qing , minister of the armed forces of xi@@ bei town , at the tu@@ an@@ kang city hall , jiangsu province .
this is a new model for the wu@@ shi department to integrate the status of the office with the actual situation in the military and to focus on raising the comprehensive quality of the specialized military cadres .
early this year , the party committee of the ministry of personnel 's armed forces discovered during investigations at the grass - roots level that some of the cadres working in the armed forces were not working as masters of their own affairs or working as permanent posts , and they did not concentrate their main energy on armed work .
for this reason , they have adopted the method of centralized training to support local party schools in their training , and so on , and have trained specialized military cadres on a regular basis , and have worked hard to resolve such problems as narr@@ owing the knowledge of military cadres and improving their professional quality .
in con@@ junction with the central task , they boldly carry out their tasks to enhance their ability to work in various posts through training at work posts .
at the same time , they actively coordinated with local organizational departments and jointly formulated a " plan for hir@@ ing and hir@@ ing special - duty cadres " and clearly stipulated that the armed forces department must join the party committee and stop taking up other positions .
a mechanism for the adjustment and exchange of cadres with special skills has been established to make arrangements for the cadres who are not able to adapt themselves to the needs of the armed forces at the grass - roots level , to readjust and exchange their work in a timely manner , and to promote and use those comrades who have a good overall quality and strong work ability .
not long ago , chen yi@@ yi , director of the armed forces department of the xin@@ n@@ century company , led the militi@@ a technical detachment to make innovations and develop under@@ water vessels to fill a gap in the country 's development , and to be upgraded to the head of the armed forces department of the company .
good start needs to be done
in terms of the result of the competition alone , the score of 2 to 2 is reasonable and acceptable , and the key is the process of the competition , so much regre@@ tt@@ able .
if iran leads the team 2 to 0 , then it will equ@@ ate the equ@@ als , then the feeling of china 's reaction is definitely different , and it will be very long and fr@@ oz@@ en , just the opposite .
good start cannot be the end of the matter , and one can say that one is old problems .
it is often not like playing in a situation , and the general view is that china is a psych@@ olog@@ ist who is not up to the mark .
this is indeed a process of not being able to sw@@ allow and fr@@ ig@@ ate .
however , judging from the un@@ finished competition today , it seems that it is not enough .
sun ji@@ hai , sun jia@@ xiang , zheng ji@@ iz@@ hi , and others have played in the european ball without saying that li wei and others were also a s@@ and - s@@ and - s@@ and - s@@ and - s@@ and - s@@ and - s@@ and - run veter@@ ans . they have seen many things that are widespread . according to reason , they do not have any problems with their psychological quality .
this p@@ aw@@ n was forced to calm by the iranian team , probably because of the battle of battle to be held .
in the back@@ war@@ dness of the iranian team , the two men were changed and the scene immediately became pan@@ ick@@ y .
the half of the game was also changed to three , but the effect was not good .
we must overcome the problem that good and bad can not be done well and must find the root cause of problems .
as long as problems are accurately identified , it is probably not difficult to find solutions to problems .
they are afraid of a sudden and un@@ toward inj@@ ury .
if it continues like this , it will be a little more competition , and old problems will still be committed , and it will be impossible to talk about a further game that everyone is looking forward to .
the ministry of public security has given the guangdong frontier defense corps a collective two - dig@@ it collective .
shenzhen , july 18
li gu@@ ol@@ i@@ ang reports : over the years , the guangdong frontier defense corps hospital has , while providing medical support to the troops , exer@@ ted itself to help the ne@@ edy , and worked hard to help the masses in difficulty .

the armed police force has changed seven - style clothes on 1 august .
on july 19 , the reporter zhang jian@@ jun reporting from beijing : the armed police force will , starting from august 1 , replace seven types of clothes one after another .
today , reporters learned from the pla units ' 7 th ceremony for issuing ap@@ p@@ are@@ l and the activity of fighting in pan@@ els that there are a total of seven types of co@@ st@@ um@@ es serving as models for training in uni@@ forms , and the four types of pal@@ m - type pill@@ ars that are covered by the military uni@@ form emb@@ r@@ y@@ onic uni@@ forms .
the current ol@@ ive green change in g@@ arm@@ ents is made up of dark ol@@ ive green , with f@@ ing@@ ers and p@@ ants all covered with fr@@ ag@@ ments , and the overall design is strong , and the design of the model is based on the national co@@ st@@ um@@ e standard .
female officers and men are covered with large h@@ ats , covered h@@ ats , and winter uni@@ forms , changing from customs - type to pas@@ sive - type , and from haw@@ normal - style structure to sc@@ u@@ d - type structure , and from spring - autumn - like dres@@ s - type desig@@ ns .
the newly added name br@@ ands , the n@@ ine@@ teen - class national defense se@@ al and the re - designed h@@ at - fr@@ ame , the red flag and the arm@@ or , the bad@@ ge , enhanced the identification function and enhanced the sense of be@@ au@@ ty .
armed police units will be replaced by seven years .
before 1 august 2007 , the pla would join forces with all military forces in fighting against the enemy 's forces , including the cadres of the inf@@ an@@ try division , the navy 's engineering department , the navy 's military , and the beijing region 's troops , in the spring and autumn dres@@ s , and the symb@@ ols of the war .
in may , he was a soldier in a soldier 's life in the armed forces , and he was a permanent soldier in the war .
in october , the red cross was born in winter uni@@ form .
in december 200@@ 9 , the new recru@@ its were replaced with winter uni@@ forms .
the training was promoted in step with the season .
a certain base of the second artillery corps began to operate in remote educational cooperative areas .
the pla daily 's x@@ ue bing@@ jian reporter xu y@@ qing reported that the small , sc@@ attered unit educational organizations of the sc@@ attered units of the si@@ yuan administration are not capable of fighting .
the reporter recently learned that after six months of trial implementation , the base issued the " ' program for implementing the ' program for ideological and political education ' to cover all small , sc@@ attered , remote , and directly subordinate units of the base , which has already been officially put into operation .
to promote the effective implementation of the " outline of ideological and political education , " the base organized a force to conduct a thorough study of the current situation of ideological and political education in small , sc@@ attered , and remote units , thus giving rise to key problems that affect and constr@@ ain the results of education during the course of study and investigation , and initially forming a new - type educational model of cooperation between small , remote , and directly subordinate units .
the specific practice of the cooperative zone is to break the dem@@ arc@@ ation line between units and design@@ ate a group of units at the brigade and regim@@ ental level in the areas where small and sc@@ attered units are relatively centralized , to make unified plans for them@@ atic education , and units under different jurisdiction discuss nearly one - third of the group 's hearing or a long - distance study system with support from the same stage .
the method of combining dil@@ igence with competition for posts is adopted to alloc@@ ate educational resources in a unified way , the uni@@ form use of educational hard@@ ware in a film area , the sharing of data from various units , and regular reporting of study by model units in the region on a regular basis .
each cooperative zone has set up educational institutions that help students and teachers .
on this basis , various cooperative areas have established key educational bases that help poor people and help them understand their emergency ideolog@@ ies and assess their performance .
zhang sheng@@ min , director of the base political department , told reporters that establishing a political education coordination zone not only has reduced the waste of educational resources , but also has deepened the results of education .
some political sw@@ arms fear that officers and men in units outside the border will lose their jobs and take the initiative to study new knowledge and explore new methods of education .
the officers and men who were educated also actively studied the content , and were afraid of seeing and analyzing the outside world in front of the officers and men of their neighboring units during the discussion and analysis .
such a kind of ru@@ ins , tu@@ bes , and pas@@ sion have been effectively stimul@@ ated .
the quota of a certain n@@ ying@@ chi group of the north sea fleet is all distributed to soldiers .
the pla navy 's first air force unit stationed in the north sea fleet 's deputy chief engine@@ er zhang we@@ ili@@ ang led a group of 31 officers and men of the detachment who worked in the frontline for a long time happ@@ ily stepped on be@@ id@@ ai@@ he train under the leadership of zhang we@@ ili@@ ang , deputy chief engine@@ er of the north sea fleet .
luo xiang@@ ming , a n@@ co@@ s of six grade 6 , told this writ@@ er with great interest that the leaders of the regiment care for and love the soldiers , and that after coming back , we must work hard and cherish the soldiers !
the grass - roots soldiers are still living in this group for the first time .
not long ago , yao qing@@ sheng went down to the grass - roots level to see that some soldiers in charge of work are br@@ aving the br@@ ains to carry out equipment maintenance work , and yao qing@@ sheng is deeply moved by this .
the soldiers working in un@@ for@@ ge@@ tt@@ able fields should be concerned about and cher@@ ished for the soldiers and be responsible for the soldiers ' health . at the party committee , yao qing@@ sheng 's words were endorsed by all .
