according to a report by china securities news , the " provisional measures for managing foreign investment in insurance funds " were promulgated a few days ago , and insurance funds have a broader scope for using the capital market .
liu le@@ fei , chief investment officer of china 's stock company , believes that the appreciation of the rmb and the improvement of the domestic capital market will not be possible for insurance organizations to invest overseas on a large scale in the near future , and this also means that the buying of domestic capital will not be diverted to the domestic stock market in the short term .
the report said that many insurance companies hold the same views .
experts said that since the market for renminbi products is not yet available , insurance organizations do not have sufficient risk ev@@ asion measures , so the time for large - scale purchases of foreign currencies is not ri@@ pe .
liu le@@ fei said : in the long run , with regard to the allocation of assets , foreign investment should be a certain percentage of the overall allocation of insurance companies .
however , given the greater pressure of appreciation for the renminbi , china will mainly use its own foreign exchange funds to invest overseas .
as for overseas investment in foreign exchange purchases , we should be cautious in the current situation .

according to taiwan 's " su@@ shi " report , chen shui - bian called in a court att@@ or@@ ney or investigation team on 30 may . due to political factors or election considerations , he interven@@ ed in the imp@@ over@@ ished phenomena or even attempted to influence candidates from various parties . he said he hoped that this phenomenon would not exist in taiwan , but might be very difficult .
in view of chen shui - bian 's qu@@ ery of court de@@ an yue bian , who did not respond to chen shui - bian 's call for secretary general fan ku@@ ang@@ zhi , while chang ku@@ ang@@ q@@ un spoke on behalf of the supreme court .
gao jin@@ zh@@ iz@@ hi said that the fundamental law and the code of ethics for judges are known to be more than the parties , and they are not allowed to participate in party activities or to be elected , and the judges concerned are all cautious in observing the pro@@ clam@@ ation of judges and are very helpful in exercising restraint in court .

germany to lower import thre@@ sh@@ old for professional talent
the first meeting of the national defense university of ber@@ lin ( by wang huai@@ cheng ) ,
german minister of education and scientific research sh@@ av@@ an said a few days ago that germany should lower its " b@@ ig@@ hin@@ ia law " restrictions on the introduction of foreign professional personnel and resolve the problem facing germany by increasing the import of foreign talent .
according to the o@@ ec@@ d report , the population between 15 and 64 will decline year by year .
if there is no sufficient migr@@ ation , then the labor force in germany will be reduced by 6@@ -@@ 2 percent compared with the present .
however , the report by the german employers ' federation and the german engine@@ ers association shows that in germany 's labor market , engine@@ ers ' professional talent is greater .
the labor bureau of germany said that the number of engine@@ ers in the labor market in germany last may was about 1@@ 27@@ ,000 , and the technicians suppl@@ ied about 9@@ ,@@ 600 .
germany has been trying to protect its own people in employment and has set a higher thre@@ sh@@ old for introducing foreign talent .
the law of germany stipulates that professional personnel of non - eu countries are not less than 8@@ 5,000 eur@@ os in germany , otherwise they cannot get jobs and residence permits in germany .
he suggested that the limits be reduced to one - fifth of the size of the population .
do not super@@ sti@@ ti@@ ous law and theories
the " law of lawyers " , which was recently submitted to the npc standing committee for deliberation , stipulates that lawyers who have engaged in professional work such as legal research and teaching , and who have advanced or similar professional levels , should apply for the legal profession and should be examined and approved by the judicial administration department of the state council .
( china 's " su@@ i " on 28 june )
in law , there are great theoretical bound@@ aries and bound@@ less bound@@ aries of practical affairs , the former mainly includes the law teaching and research work , etc. , while the latter is more active in legal proceedings , legal en@@ acting laws , services , and other concrete behaviors , such as legal consul@@ ting laws .
for a long time , the law has evol@@ ved into a tra@@ il of human civilization , along with the human civilization , and the theory of socialism has maintained that the need to be en@@ li@@ ed in the practical affairs , and the lack of necessary mechan@@ ics , and is only the leg@@ alist of the law , and the great spirit of the war of resistance against theoretical exploration in the development of the theory of the or@@ th@@ o@@ do@@ x , which is not practical .
the law can do a good job of maintaining a bound@@ less law and not a law that supports any one .
however , the practice of regarding lawyers as a law for human expedi@@ tion has obj@@ ectively recognized the law of law , and the law of law is more like a law of practical affairs than a law .
in fact , some people , such as the law of international law and others , are purely theoretical research and teaching , and their theory study and practice are all along in line with law .
in this way , the law of the budd@@ ha in the law of the law , without doubt , has created an extremely bad phenomenon that aff@@ ects extremely bad things like the ca@@ ve - ins .
super@@ sti@@ tion in the theoretical circles is not con@@ fined to these , such as argu@@ ments by experts and experts , which often aff@@ ects or even rej@@ ects court verdic@@ ts , and this is also the direct manif@@ estation of super@@ sti@@ tion .

britain low@@ ers level of terror alert
xinhua news agency , london , july 5 th , by reporter lin guo
the british government will reduce its terror attack level from the highest level to the serious level of meas@@ u@@ re@@ ments , which means that terrorist attacks will not occur in britain , but attacks may still be very likely to occur in the gulf .
at present , british police have shif@@ ted the scope of investigation to india and australia .
the police have been investigating the case since the eight suspected terrorist attacks were all working in the medical system , and the government will be conducting an emergency examination of the background of foreign migr@@ ants entering the medical system .
it is understood that nearly 10,000 people working in britain 's public medical system are doctors who are overseas .
the prime minister also called for investigation of migr@@ ants with high technology , and the employers or relevant organizations will be asked to provide background information on migr@@ ation .
do n't let traders ti@@ red .
the tourist char@@ t is a sel@@ fish culture that is sel@@ dom lo@@ aded with green , enjoying natural and social civilization to the greatest extent .
but , when travel@@ ing in china , many people have encountered such a kind of worry , and they are already en@@ closed by traders and intermedi@@ ary businesses .
whether it is cars or tr@@ ains , or vehicles , one will always have to en@@ counter death from small traders and ir@@ refu@@ table intermedi@@ aries .
it is not selling budd@@ ha spr@@ aw@@ ling c@@ akes , it is selling newspapers and peri@@ o@@ dic@@ als , and there are many un@@ veri@@ fied c@@ akes , even false documents , etc.
if you do not accept it , he can ch@@ ase you several hundred meters , and if you are not successful , you will become ben@@ evol@@ ent .
many things are similarly affected in some tem@@ ples .
before entering the gate , some people came to inspect things and narrow things like children and children .
after entering the door , this situation will be even more frequent , and even if it is good , y@@ ar@@ xing is also sti@@ fled and has to be too much to ta@@ st@@ e .
according to a media report , many foreign tourists who went to xian were un@@ tou@@ ching in the ancient guizhou temple , but they were very interested in allowing more pe@@ d@@ d@@ lers to come back and forth to sell them .
such phenomena as the + su@@ c@@ k of the river , the b@@ ig@@ o@@ on , and the na@@ ur@@ u , should be characterized by orderly civilization , qu@@ iet and harmonious harmony , and should be brought to a wid@@ th environment .
the free flow of commodities , the ha@@ v@@ ana of the sel@@ lers , and the w@@ rec@@ king of the public order obj@@ ectively , have formed a ben@@ ign environment for pollution and environmental pollution , and at the same time , it provides conditions and opportunities for pollution .
what is important is that these + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + +
just imag@@ ine , if you want to become a strong tourist industry , you can use this kind of an ir@@ regular tourism environment to welcome the south - to - north guests . who will come ? who will dare to come ?
how can your tourism economy achieve economic benefits ?
with the arrival of the peak tourist season , it will create a civilized tourism environment for tourists from the northern part of the country . this should be said a pressing task at the moment .
the sp@@ ell is not the market , and the operation of small traders should be standardized , and unlicensed operations should be resolutely abol@@ ished . illegal activities should be resolutely dealt with .
only by a civilized and orderly environment can we make ourselves happy and make ourselves flour@@ ish and re@@ pros@@ per .
in a n@@ ai@@ ve , do n't let traders go by trouble .
imp@@ ul@@ se the country 's economic development
in the eastern district of beijing , the construction of a rural area with electric products such as grain distribution is regarded as an award for 12 households that volun@@ t@@ arily surr@@ ender their insurance benefits .
( beijing news , july 10 )
i am pleased to see the improvement of these families ' living conditions but have taken the initiative to protect their own wor@@ dings , and also have the practice of giving awards .
deputy director of jian@@ '@@ an neighbor@@ hood office said that in view of the problem of che@@ ating and minimum security , encouraging the active re@@ fund of poor households is an example for other households .
this example is to encourage other under@@ cover personnel to extr@@ icate themselves from their difficulties through their own efforts . if this is to get some inspir@@ ation from those old people who have long been che@@ ated by dec@@ eption , it is un@@ avo@@ idable that some n@@ ai@@ ve people are willing to do so .
in the course of differ@@ enti@@ ating and clean@@ ing up low - income households , it is more dependent on the law .
relevant departments should strengthen the protection of the rights and interests of low - income households when enjoying the minimum allow@@ able insurance benefits : such as promptly reporting the changes in family personnel and income , reporting on the employment situation , and receiving peri@@ od@@ ic review , etc. , and the departments concerned should step up supervision and inspection .
after all , the practice of re@@ treating from a stal@@ k in accordance with the law is a long - term plan .
the neighbor@@ hood re@@ wards the families who have re@@ tained insurance will be paid from whom ?
as a first - level government organization , its expenditures are borne by the treasury .
the money of the + + + + + + + + + + + tax@@ pay@@ ers should not be spent ?
on the one hand , the withdrawal from the minimum guarantee family prov@@ es that it has a certain degree of autonomy in providing aid for people , while on the other hand , does n't the application for low protection still exist ?
the government 's financial appropri@@ ation , which is called a life - saving money , should be used to provide char@@ coal in the snow instead of adding flowers to the golden sky .
liu gang@@ yi 's remark is even more significant in his service .
on 10 july , the first democr@@ atically elected town , b@@ eng@@ gu district , xin@@ du district , q@@ il@@ an town , wu@@ di county , china was elected as the first city in the country .
in the dialogue between the press and liu gang@@ yi , liu gang@@ yi defined himself as a na@@ il service for people .
( beijing news , yesterday )
the people of china may be more vigorous and im@@ partial than some cadres appointed by the reform of administrative system .
the biggest obstacle in the system of appointment by public election is the fact that the former is mainly determined by ordinary party members and masses , and the latter is mainly appointed by upper - level organizations , and the direction of the source of power determin@@ es that the former must as@@ sign first responsibility to the people .
the source of power and the responsibility to whom are the fundamental factors determining how the person will carry out his work .
some people question such a democratic approach , like a democratic revolution , even more like a democratic revolution .
my view is that there is such a form of democratic expedi@@ tion , which is better than that .
considering the history and current situation of the building of grass - roots democracy in china , i think the election of public servants is a major breakthrough , democratic development is an important component part of the effort to promote the building of grass - roots democracy .
india expected to choose first female president , which says it is quite likely that the election will be a rather significant one , and female voters hope it will raise the status of women .
on 23 june , in front of the presidential candidate documents , ten pieces were written in the stri@@ p of green .
the cur@@ tain will be raised on the 19@@ th for the indian presidential election . the new president will be elected by the current vice president , sh@@ ev@@ ard@@ n@@ ad@@ ze , and the recently re@@ signed state of the ra@@ j@@ as@@ than state .
pan@@ su@@ ke is the first female presidential candidate in the history of india . if she is elected , she will become india 's first female president .
p@@ ag@@ er is the ruling party 's national congress party presidential candidate , while sh@@ ev@@ ard@@ n@@ ad@@ at is from the opposition people 's party .
since the congress party holds a dominant position in the presidential election , the media and the people are eager to get elected , the possibility of being elected is quite great .
the 72 - year - old p@@ ag@@ od@@ a is the female governor of la@@ z@@ a@@ zh@@ ar state .
she 's a law@@ yer , a n@@ ai@@ chi , rich experience in the congress , and she was warmly welcomed by the government when she was serving as a state of la@@ j@@ as@@ than .
she also worked for social welfare , and is a model of education and social welfare organizations .
analysts pointed out that the reason pa@@ imp@@ ine became a candidate was because she unswervingly b@@ and@@ wid@@ ened indian national congress party chairman s@@ onia g@@ and@@ hi .
in india , the g@@ and@@ hi cl@@ an family has long controlled the ruling national congress party .
p@@ ag@@ er has been supported by a large number of female voters , and the female voters believe that par@@ ag@@ us will become a female fair@@ y fair@@ child in india where the concept of women is seriously dis@@ crimin@@ ated against .
the constitution stipulates that india is a federal state under the name of the president and head of state , and is in command , not in any party , but in most cases a symb@@ ol .

the indic@@ t@@ ment said that the two defend@@ ants decided to defend those people who were suffering from humili@@ ating mus@@ lim@@ s by the americans after the outbreak of the iraq war , and therefore they were living in jordan .
in august 2006 , they were in a human village living in and@@ er@@ man , capital of jordan , but they were detained by police before the attack .

in the world 's military , which is more than 100 countries , although the use of military uni@@ form is basically the same , there is no uni@@ form for the troops of any two countries .

the party committee organs of a certain brigade have a great courage to handle issues in a pioneering spirit .
chengdu , 3 july ( jief@@ ang@@ jun bao )
qu ru@@ yu , who is of chinese origin , says that we can live on a field of human civilization , and benefit from the determination and courage of the party committee organs of the greater unit in clearing away the house .
today , more than 10 georg@@ qian qichen 's cadres from a communications training group of the chengdu military region are el@@ ated and vi@@ vi@@ d . they are eager to solve the great gap between themselves and the poor and the strong style of the party committees in the chengdu military region . they have the courage to solve problems and have the courage to do a good job in their work style and are full of admir@@ ation and eag@@ er@@ ness .
a few years ago , as people 's + human bel@@ ts were bloc@@ ked in some of the home buildings of this brigade , they were found to have been in violation of regulations , causing difficulties in housing for cadres working in the army , and the officers and men have quite a big opinion about this .
the group had also cle@@ ared several houses and could not stop them because of all kinds of obstruc@@ tions . this problem became old , big , and difficult .
we should have courage to do things like a genuine one , but we can not solve difficult problems .
after the new term of party committee leaders reached a consensus , the principal leaders personally began to sort out all the un@@ authorized occupation of houses .
they are moving along like a char@@ m , ca@@ es@@ the@@ tics , hope relevant personnel , while on the one hand , the troops ' bound@@ less barr@@ acks , the appropriate policies and regulations on the economy , show the party committee 's firm determination and principled stance .
we should not allow people to think in places where there are houses but not those who are willing to step back from others or occupy housing , and party committees and institutions should promptly contact their units , and should adopt corresponding measures to urge them to take the initiative in coordinating with the work of the troops .
after two months of meticulous work , all those who violated regulations and occupied houses were moved out on schedule , and all the on - the - job cadres of the brigade were assigned housing according to regulations .
the party committee of this brigade has the courage to compete with the tough cases and has also produced a sharp effect . the original practice of recru@@ iting cadres who were unwilling to actively cooperate with the organization has also one after another expressed their willingness to subordinate themselves to the decision made by the organization .

this is a concrete practice of the people 's armed police department in con@@ junction with the reality of their posts , which has brought new changes to the overall quality of specialized military cadres .
at the beginning of this year , the party committee of the people 's liberation army [ pla ] ministry discovered during investigation and study at the grass - roots level that some specialized military cadres worked in both chang gu and chang [ chang z@@ ai ] , and others worked in their own posts , and did not concentrate their main energy on the armed forces work .
therefore , they have conducted training in rural areas through centralized training , relying on training in local party schools , and conducting regular training of specialized military cadres , and making efforts to solve the problem of the lack of knowledge of specialized military cadres and the over@@ simpli@@ fication of professional quality .

good at first still needs to be good at the future .
the result of the competition alone was a reasonable score of 2 - 2 , which could be acceptable .
if iran leads the team by 2 to 0 , then equ@@ als will be equ@@ ated , then the feeling of china 's na@@ il will definitely be different , and will have a long morale , otherwise the situation will be opposite .
the good start cannot end , and one can say , one old problem is one .
' the way we often do it is that we do not play gol@@ f under the situation of progress , and the views of ordinary people are that china 's psychological quality is not perfect .
this is indeed a process of un@@ brid@@ led development .
however , judging from the current + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + +
sun ji@@ hai , su@@ zhou n@@ ai@@ jing , and zheng ji@@ zhi played in a soccer match in europe , and li wei and others were also old friends of the s@@ and ground . they saw that they were more than one to see the broad field of thought , and they would not have any problem with their psychological quality .
this imp@@ ul@@ se was forced to be by the iranian team , probably because of the im@@ pending military deployment .
under the back@@ war@@ dness of the iranian team , it changed to two people , and the situation was immediately moved by .
the second half of the ba@@ g is also changing to three kinds of c@@ att@@ le .
we must overcome the problem that good at first and bad things cannot be done well , and we must accurately find the root cause of the problems .
as long as the problem is accurately identified , it is probably not difficult to find solutions to problems .
