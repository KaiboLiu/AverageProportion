experts believe that insurance intermedi@@ ation is a short - term matter of the le@@ gen@@ d of domestic stock funds .
chin@@ ane@@ ws , july 30 - chin@@ ane@@ ws .
according to a report by china securities news , the " insurance fund - related regulations on investment management " recently promulgated , insurance funds have more extensive market space and a fairly large amount of capital market use .
the china ji@@ u@@ jiang company 's chief investment officer liu le@@ fei said that the appreciation of the renminbi and the domestic capital market are good , and the insurance institution will not be able to purchase foreign exchange through large - scale foreign investment in the short term . this also means that the im@@ m of the domestic insurance company will not be diverted to the stock market within the short term .
the report said that many insurance agencies hold the same viewpoint .
experts said that because of the current lack of renminbi products , the insurance industry has not yet made any ris@@ ky measures , and therefore the large - scale purchase of foreign exchange is not mature .
liu le@@ fei said : over the long term , in the aspect of asset allocation , foreign investment should be made in the overall distribution of insurance companies .
however , given the current situation of the rmb , the pressure of appreciation is relatively big , china 's commodity prices will mainly use its own foreign exchange funds to invest outside the country .
the government will also take a series of measures to support foreign exchange purchase .

chen shui - bian 's secret approval of judicial intervention in election taiwan 's " judicial yuan " denied and wanted to explain it .
chin@@ ane@@ ws , july 20 - chen shui - bian says that chen shui - bian 's attempt to get involved in the election of taiwan 's leader .
taiwan 's k@@ an@@ chu@@ ang administration , a small paper , said that the same day , the island 's judge 's present performance is different from what chen shui - bian said , and demanded that chen shui - bian explain his remarks .
according to a report by taiwan 's " yuan@@ yu " on 30 march , chen shui - bian questi@@ oned whether a judge was engaged in a mal@@ ic@@ ious sp@@ ell or because of political factors or election considerations . he even attempted to influence the election activities of all parties , claiming that he hoped that such a phenomenon would not exist in taiwan , but it is very difficult .
in view of chen shui - bian 's doubt , the taiwan justice minister said , " the communist china is a big country , not responding to the criticism of the rum@@ or , the secretary general of the k@@ ao k@@ yi [ gao jie ] , who is a deputy director of the administration of justice , spoke about it .
gao jin@@ chi said : the taiwan basic law and the law governing judges are all im@@ printed in the words of justice , decl@@ aring that judges should go beyond the party and not participate in the activities of political parties , and that judges should be very cautious about the relevant restrictions . they believe that justice is very cautious and that the justice department believes that justice is good .
gao jin@@ yu pointed out that the k@@ it@@ ty haw@@ k was broken by the c@@ age of a judge , zhang sheng@@ xi , who participated in the c@@ ast@@ le at the k@@ ad@@ a@@ ar@@ a school several years ago , that is , because the relevant courses have a political party col@@ our and are a member of the self - discipline committee of the judge .
zhang hong@@ xi once wanted to participate in the dpp 's inter@@ change because he took over the election because he took over the post .
gao jin@@ chi held that if the individual case is a case , it is a case that is at the level of trial , and it is not possible to be able to win the victory in the case in a single case , and that the judge should not have political intentions .
germany to lower professional standards
the pla navy 's air force 's first artillery corps has successfully launched a series of training courses in the fields of military training , military training , and the training of troops .
german education and scientific research minister sh@@ au@@ k@@ at s@@ aw@@ en said recently that germany should lower the " sil@@ k law " and make a decision on introducing specialized personnel from foreign countries , and increase the use of foreign talent to resolve the problems facing germany .
according to the report of the o@@ ec@@ d , germany has a population of 15 years and 64 years of age , and the number of labor@@ ers is expected to decline year after year .
if there is no sufficient immigration , by 20@@ 20 , german jo@@ s , will be more than the current 60 percent .
however , the federation of german employers and the german engine@@ er association have reported that in germany , the labor market is still at a low level , with the technology of engine@@ ers , a relatively large number of technical personnel .
according to the statistics released by the federal labor bureau , in may this year , the number of engine@@ ers in the german labor market was approximately 1.@@ 27@@ 0,000 , and the number of technicians suppl@@ ying pol@@ ye@@ ster is about 9@@ 600 .
in order to protect its own people 's employment , germany has set up a relatively high standard for introducing foreign talents .

do not super@@ sti@@ ti@@ ously believe in legal doctr@@ ine
the " decision " recently submitted to the npc standing committee for deliberation on the revision of the " law of lawyers " stipulates : those who have engaged in legal research , such as engaging in legal studies , have high level of academic standards such as senior th@@ um@@ p or similar to professional level , apply for lawyers ' law enforcement , and are subject to the approval of the state council 's judicial and administrative departments , and are subject to the approval of the law enforcement department .

in the law , there are two kinds of le@@ gen@@ d and cr@@ y@@ st@@ alli@@ zation of the le@@ gen@@ d of the ocean , and the former mainly includes legal , research , etc. , the latter is more important than engaging in li@@ tig@@ ation legal inquir@@ y .
for a long time , the law circles and the practice of le@@ yi - yu business have exist@@ ed in the field of science , a le@@ th@@ less phenomenon , a le@@ gen@@ d in the theory circles , believ@@ ing that the substantial foundation of the legal profession lacks necessary foundation , and that it is only the mor@@ gan stanley doctr@@ ine , and the pol@@ o - rule , the criticism of the big family of the confu@@ ci@@ us of the confu@@ ci@@ us theory is the guiding practice of the confu@@ ci@@ us
for such a division of labor , the law can do anything that can be done .
however , the " law of lawyers " has nothing to do with the practice of collecting evidence from others .
in fact , some people engaged in the study of the legal system , such as the international law of justice , and other p@@ ure theories , have been replaced by their theoretical study with legal practice .
in this way , the law of justice of the do@@ or@@ step is undoubtedly a legal document for legal affairs .
the practice of using the le@@ th@@ al theory is still not only the above , but also the practice of using the bi@@ om@@ ed@@ ical evidence , such as experts and scholars , will often affect or even rej@@ ect the court 's judgment . this is also the direct expression of this super@@ sti@@ tion .

to further promote the development of china 's maritime industry and to strengthen the country 's maritime industry , the ministry of national defense issued a circular on the fact that china has a large number of ships engaged in international navigation registration and hang@@ ing of foreign flag . the ministry of communications recently issued a " circular on implementing the special task force on international shipping shipping of chinese - invested international shipping " , which clearly states that they enjoy the special conditions and procedures for applying for special case .

the british government 's sin@@ ist@@ er attack has been trans@@ mitted from the highest level to the lower level of the department of justice , which said that british terrorist attacks would soon take place , but the attack still involves a very possibly mar@@ tial mor@@ o .
at present , the british police are investigating the case to india and australia .
as the arrested eight people were suspected of terrorist attacks , they were all in the medical system , and the government would take a comprehensive and thorough investigation into the background of migr@@ ants from abroad who have been working in the medical system .
it is learned that nearly 20 percent of the total number of people working in the public health system in britain have been working in the hospital .
prime minister john how@@ ard also demanded that the em@@ igr@@ ants of high technology be investigated and that the employer or the relevant organizations be asked to provide background information .
you do n't know how to sell them .
the number of such illegal tourists is sl@@ ice .
but in the country , the number of people travel@@ ed in this way .
whether it is automobile or train , the car is still a big one , and the sk@@ ul@@ l is always faced with small business sales and some un@@ veri@@ fied intermedi@@ ary .
it is not a matter of sc@@ u@@ d . it is a matter of selling newspapers and peri@@ o@@ dic@@ als , and it is also a matter of fact that many intermedi@@ ary organizations introduced the contents of the d@@ ining , or even made false evidence .
if you do n't accept it , he can ch@@ ase you several hundred meters , a lot of water , and it 's not successful .
in some wind - filled areas , many things are equally common ,
without the gate , it would be impossible for someone to make such a big affair .
when i arrived at the door , this situation became even more .
there was media reports that by the time of the visit , many foreign tourists went to xi ' an to pay attention to the mon@@ ument of xi ' an , but they had to pay more attention to allowing more of the p@@ ile of small business haw@@ kers to go around .
these include the wind - filled f@@ ans of the station , the cr@@ acks of the b@@ am@@ bo@@ o and the place of the ru@@ ins , the ru@@ ins should be orderly , harmonious , and un@@ rel@@ enting . the environment of the sil@@ k heart of the th@@ ro@@ at was created .
the sales of free white paper , the bl@@ u@@ ster of the sil@@ k , and the bl@@ u@@ ster of the le@@ gen@@ d , obj@@ ectively destroyed the public order of these things , and formed a system of pollution and environmental pollution . meanwhile , it also provided the conditions and conditions for the le@@ ase to provide them .
the important thing is that these things are the root of the spiritual civilization construction in hong kong , but the le@@ gen@@ d is not only the image of the whole , but also the impact on local economic development .
let us imag@@ ine , if you want to be a strong tourist industry , you use this kind of chao@@ tic and totally un@@ usual tourism environment to gre@@ et the arrival of the guests from south to north , and who is willing to come ?
your travel economy is also a good example .
with the rapid growth of tourism , the weather has brought about a great deal of new opportunities for tourists from the north of tian@@ nan . it should be said that the most pressing task at the moment is to create a civilized tourism environment .
the gu@@ y is not a market , the haw@@ ker is a business behavior of small businesses . it is not a business that has no license to be operated resolutely . illegal activities should be resolutely cracked down on .
a civilized and orderly environment is the only way to make things happy .

the dong@@ cheng district in beijing is a small house for the distribution of electric products and other articles . as a result , it is necessary to protect the basic living expenses of 12 families on their own initiative .
( new beijing news )
this writ@@ er has provided a good opportunity for the improvement of the living conditions of these families , but it has taken the initiative to rever@@ se the verdic@@ t , and there is still a practice of re@@ wards for others .
the ji@@ u@@ quan street office deputy director said that , in view of the mal@@ ic@@ ious mal@@ feas@@ ance and other problems , the company has encouraged the active pen@@ sion insurance and has set an example for other low - income families .
this example , if it is encouraging other low - income insur@@ ers to use their own efforts to extr@@ icate themselves from difficulties , it is indeed worth advocating , and if it is to use them to promote the long - term practice of che@@ ating for low - income workers , it is not possible to be some n@@ ai@@ ve people .
in terms of differ@@ enti@@ ation and clearing away the le@@ uk@@ em@@ ia , more efforts should be made to protect the property .
the departments concerned should strengthen the management of the minimum - income insurance , and should ensure that the insurance companies are informed of the situation in the course of their income changes , report their employment situation , and accept regular re@@ views .
after all , the practice of replac@@ ing old sil@@ k with sil@@ k is a long - term project .
the streets are not allowed to pay for the protection of the family .
as the first - level government organization , its expenditure is determined by the budget .
the number of tax fraud cases is not the same as the money they should pay .
on the one hand , the family that with@@ dra@@ ws from the low - income families has possess@@ ed certain standard of self - protection ability , while on the other hand , the number of people applying for low - income insurance is not yet ?

yesterday 's " xin@@ jing bao " published an article in the " xin jing bao " : " the taiwan authorities have not yet made a decision on the issue of the " three links " in the past .
liu said that the chinese language used in the sil@@ k of the qing dynasty was more important than some appointed cadres , and the japanese government was too im@@ it@@ ated .
the public - run election is more open than the election system .
power sources and the power to be held responsible are the basic criteria for determining the candidate to carry out his work .
some people doubt such a democratic process .
my view is that the people with such a character of democracy are mostly engaged in the following practices : the practice of democratic evol@@ ution is better than the practice of democratic evol@@ ution .
in view of the fact that the building of democracy at the grass - roots level in china and the current situation , i believe that the public - to - party elections are a major breakthrough , and democracy is an important component part of this kind of democratic revolution , which is of great significance to promoting the building of grassroots - level democratic politics .

jing@@ jiang city 's wu@@ jiang@@ xing platform has upgraded the bi@@ ograph@@ ic quality of cadres of special - purpose wu@@ wu city
the pla navy 's first - generation computer - assist@@ ed computer - assist@@ ed computer - trans@@ mitted information - based computer - assist@@ ed by zhao ji@@ ay@@ i , a special cadre in jiangsu 's jing@@ jiang city , was given a lecture on " winning a war under inform@@ ati@@ zed conditions . "
this is the first time that the ministry of human resources has given the cadres with a hand to the specialized personnel , and has made efforts to improve the comprehensive quality of specialized weapons cadres .
early this year , the military commission of the ministry of people 's armed forces discovered that some specialized militi@@ amen working in the company were a little bit of age , and were not at the position of deputy director . they did not concentrate their main energy on armed work .
for this reason , they have adopted the method of concentr@@ ating training , using sub@@ stitu@@ te training for local party schools , and other methods to conduct regular training of specialized military cadres , and making efforts to resolve the problem of im@@ partial and im@@ partial quality of military cadres .
in connection with the central work , we should boldly provide cadres with tasks to cut down on tasks , and strengthen the quality of work at work posts .
at the same time , they actively coordinated local organization departments and jointly formulated the " regulations on bidding for military cadres by specialized means " and clearly stipulated that the minister of armed forces must be promoted to the party committee , and no longer hold other positions ;
and established a system for the adjustment and exchange of cadres with special skills , and adopted a system of making policy decisions on some specialized weapons and equipment which were not much like a big stick in the armed forces , timely readjustment and exchange , and giving full - quality cadres with strong work ability to keep good quality .
not long ago , the new century 's le@@ gen@@ d company , chen yi@@ song , led the militi@@ a technical detachment in making innovations and developing under@@ water technology filled the gap in china , ru@@ shing the house of the company , which was upgraded to the minister of the company .
the good will be the best of the good beginning .
the number of people who participated in the competition alone was 2 - 2 , and the number of people who won the prize was reasonable .
if it is the 2 - 0 lead of iran , then it will be more than a - 0 , that will cause a big impact on china 's progress , and it will be very long for morale . it is , is , the situation is bad .
the good will cannot be good at the end of the matter . it can be said that it is old problems .
you often do n't know how to use it under the circum@@ stance .
this is indeed not a matter of being f@@ uc@@ ky .
however , the japanese government , which has been defeated today , seems to have been in a state of dis@@ order .
sun ji@@ hai , sun ji@@ xiang , sun ji@@ angu@@ o , zheng ji@@ angu@@ o , and others were k@@ ic@@ ked in europe , but li wei did not say anything about the ball . li wei and others were also old friends of the z@@ ig@@ z@@ ong economic field . they had learned many things and said that they would not have problems with psychological quality for a long time .
this kind of desp@@ ic@@ able act was forced by the iranian team , and it was probably because it was a round of military mediation .
iran 's team has been defeated in back@@ war@@ dness , and the two have been changed and the situation has been greatly changed .

we should overcome the mentality of being ben@@ evol@@ ent and unable to end up with good and bad things . we must find the root of problems .
so long as the problems are accurately identified , the problems are correc@@ ted , it is probably not difficult to find them .
i was afraid of being anx@@ ious to get medical treatment .
if this continues , the th@@ ick k@@ ick is k@@ ic@@ ked more competitions , and old problems will still commit crimes , and talk will not be mentioned by everyone .

the total number of such cooperation areas is to break down the dem@@ arc@@ ation line between units and the establishment of small , sc@@ attered , and directly directly administ@@ ered units , such as the division - level unit of a brigade - level unit , to conduct unified planning for the main education . the units under different subordinate units are close to the taiwan - based units for short - range discussions on the same system by taking account of their lectures or using the c@@ ann@@ ed long distance .
the use of tor@@ ture and job - related means of job - seeking is a necessary measure to re@@ deploy the educational forces in a unified manner , and the re@@ use of the hard@@ ware of education in the doc@@ toral areas . the various units have learned from each other 's experience in conducting exchanges and conducting regular inter@@ rog@@ ations in the doc@@ um@@ entary reports by the officers and men of the doc@@ um@@ entary department .
