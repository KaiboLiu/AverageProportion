german education and scientific research minister sh@@ au@@ k@@ at said recently that germany should take a lower tariffs on " dum@@ pling " companies , and that germany should " lower the thre@@ sh@@ old of laws " on imported foreign professional personnel , and solve the problems that germany faces in its efforts to bring in foreign talent .
according to the o@@ ec@@ d report , germany has more than 15 years old , and 64 years old of labor force , which is expected to decline year after year .
if there is no sufficient migr@@ ation , it will be impossible to replace the old german labor force with the current 6 percent .
however , the german federation of employers and the german engine@@ ers association reported that in germany , the number of employees in the labor market has increased by more than 20 percent .
according to the german federal labor bureau , the unemployment rate in may was only 0.@@ 6 percent higher than in may .
in order to protect its own people 's employment , germany has adopted a series of preferential policies to import foreign talents .
the german magazine " sin@@ ist@@ er " stipulates that the non - eu countries ' professionals are not engaged in dumping in germany at a rate of 8.@@ 5@@ 50,000 eur@@ os , otherwise they cannot be granted a stay in germany .

do not super@@ sti@@ tion theories ;
the " decision on the amendments to the law on lawyers " submitted to the npc standing committee for deliberation recently stipulates : the lawyers who have engaged in legal research and other professional work , and possess high - level or similar professional standards , such as those engaged in either high - level or similar professional work , shall be examined and approved by the state council 's judicial and administrative departments and be allowed to be appointed to the lawyers ' practice .
( 28 june ) the " china threat " magazine ) .
in law , there are many things like gen@@ e@@ tic engineering and deep - rooted problems .
for a long time , legal circles and colon@@ i@@ alists have long been engaged in mal@@ ar@@ ia , but there were phenomena of tri@@ tion , which origin@@ ates from the ancient state , which holds that the theory of the legal circles lacks necessary resources , such as the lack of necessary foundation in the field of internal affairs , whereas the phenomena of ab@@ using the laws of justice , such as the zheng dynasty , the zheng dynasty , and the zheng bi@@ jian , which criticized the theory of the origin@@ s of theories
the chinese government has always attached great importance to such a division of labor and the legal system is to keep it under the condition of being mainly relying on others to support others .
however , the " law on lawyers " has been using the same old system to replace old concepts , which is obj@@ ectively recognized by legal circles , to over@@ pass laws , but this is actually a matter of course .
in fact , some comrades engaged in legal work have long been engaged in purely theoretical research and teaching purposes such as the law of the legal system , and their theoretical at@@ tainment has once again become closely related to legal affairs .
in this way , the law of origin is undoubtedly a law of origin .
the difference between rich and poor in theory is not just the same as that of experts , such as experts ' feasibility study meetings and discussions of experts , which will often affect or even rej@@ ect the court 's judgment , but is also the direct expression of such super@@ sti@@ tion .

britain reduc@@ es terrorist attack level
the special correspon@@ dent of the pla general political department held a news conference in london on 5 july .
the british government has also made long - term attacks from the top level of terrorism , from the top level to the serious category of corporate fraud , indicating that the terrorist attack in britain will not happen , but the attack is likely to be committed by the extreme .
at present , the british police have shif@@ ted the scope of the investigation to india and australia .
as the arrested eight people were suspected of terrorist attacks , they were all in the medical system and the government would carry out a comprehensive and thorough investigation into the background of migr@@ ants who had entered the medical system .
it is reported that nearly 20 percent of the people in the medical system in eng@@ land are working in the overseas medical system .
prime minister john ker@@ ry also asked to investigate the mal@@ ar@@ ia background of high technology migr@@ ation , and employers or related agencies would request to provide background information .
do n't let the traders
the number of tourists and the number of people who were involved in smuggling and bor@@ ed from business was the greatest of being negl@@ ected , and the natural fruits of social civilization were also covered by natural phenomena and civilization .
but at home , the number of people who travel abroad has encountered this kind of concern .
whether it is automobile or train , the train is using the gas to catch up with the pe@@ d@@ d@@ lers and some un@@ certified intermedi@@ ary dead bodies .
it is not selling flowers .
if you do n't accept it , he can ch@@ ase you several hundred meters , and it 's all very difficult to get cheng j@@ en - j@@ en .
in some areas of wind and rain , many things are equally experienced .
the door is not opened , and there are people who are engaged in tourism and the big things from which to be covered by it .
when i entered the door , this situation became even more serious .
some media reported that the united states and the dprk had been making many foreign tourists to xian and had praised the mon@@ uments of xian . however , they were greatly shocked and un@@ happy about the fact that more small business haw@@ kers were allowed to come to the he@@ ap .
these include the deep - rooted mal@@ ach@@ ite green of the station , which is a product of the + corporation of natural gas , which should be civilized , harmonious , and peaceful , and such a phenomenon as " un@@ cle " , has been caused by a tin@@ y environment of un@@ it@@ a .
the number of fre@@ ed goods has increased by more than 20 percent . the amount of money involved in smuggling has been increased by more than 20 percent .
the important thing is that these things are the foundation of the building of spiritual civilization in the region , but the whole thing is that the damaged are not just the issue of image , but also have a great impact on the local economic development .
just think , if you want to do a big and powerful tourism industry , you can use such a chao@@ tic and totally chao@@ tic tourist environment to gre@@ et the arrival of the guests from south to north , who is willing to come , who da@@ res to come ?
your tourist economy is also a good example .
with the increase in the peak tourist season , the number of tourists coming to the northern part of tian@@ nan prefecture has created a civilized tourist environment . it should be said that the pressing task at present is to create a civilized tourist environment .
failure to do so ;
a civilized and orderly environment is the only way to make things happy .
in a word , the idea of letting the traders get rich is not too big .
the
the beijing dong@@ cheng district has a long history of electr@@ om@@ ag@@ ne@@ tic waves , which is used to distribu@@ te such items as tel@@ e@@ grams , to reward 12 households for their own protection .
( " xin@@ jing bao " ) on 10 july ,
i have made many contributions to improving the living conditions of these families , but i am very pleased with the fact that everything has been released , and also the award given to others , which is a measure of m@@ ood .
the ji@@ ay@@ i street office deputy director said that because of the mal@@ practices of low - income households , they should encourage them to return home on their own initiative , and they should set examples for other households .
this example , if it is to encourage other low - income workers to use their own efforts to extr@@ icate themselves from their predic@@ ament , then it is indeed worth advocating , if it wants to use them to s@@ oo@@ t the weak in@@ sured personnel who have long been che@@ ating for low - income workers , then it is still not certain that they are inf@@ at@@ u@@ ated .
in terms of differ@@ enti@@ ation and clearing away from low - income households , more resources are used to protect the legitimate rights and interests of households .
the departments concerned should strengthen the management of low - income families when enjoying the minimum guarantee .
after all , the failure of using the law to re@@ strict things is a long - term plan .
the street is very much concerned about the loss of family members .
the street , as a first - class government organization , is managed by the state finance .
but , the money from the tax@@ pay@@ ers should not be fl@@ ower ?
on the one hand , the income from the low - income families prov@@ es that they have certain capability to provide self - reliance , and on the other hand , they apply for low - income workers not to exist ?
the " falungong " cult , which is called a life - saving money , should be used to provide relief in the snow instead of add flowers to it .

on 10 july , the first public - key leader in the country was elected by the ga@@ o@@ yi corporation , a new town , xin@@ du district , which was form@@ erly a town , for the fourth time accepted bribes , with a m@@ enti@@ oning rate of 9@@ 7@@ 7.@@ 7 percent .
at the news conference with liu gang , the chinese government and people have always attached importance to the development of the country 's economy , including the issue of corporate commerce .
yesterday 's " xin@@ jing bao " published a report on the " falungong " issue .
liu gang , a student of the department of applied science , is likely to be more exp@@ ensive than officials under the system of making cadres , because such affairs are still more true , people are more un@@ common .
the " taiwan independence " elements who have been appointed directly by the election are the main source of the chaos caused by the masses of common party members , and the latter mainly are appointed by higher organizations , while the orientation of the source of power will determine the former must be placed in the first place for the people .
the sources of power and the persons responsible for whom are the key factors determining the people in the election to do their work .
some people doubt such a concept of democracy , even more like a big family of democracy ,
my view is that the united states has such a democratic concept that involves all other things , it is better than not .
taking into account the reality of the building of grass - roots democracy in china , i believe that the practice of holding a referendum is a major breakthrough .

because the congress party is in a state of the presidential election , it is very difficult for the media and the people to get involved in the election .

she
she also worked for social welfare , and was a part of many culture and social welfare organizations .

in india , g@@ and@@ hi families have long been controlled by the ruling national party .
p@@ ope was subj@@ ected to a large number of female voters , and female voters believed that p@@ aw@@ n would be dis@@ crimin@@ ating against women .
the constitution stipulates that india is the only country that has the power to control the country , and the head of state of the country , not represented by any party , more of the country , or the country .

in the past few years , with the increasing number of personnel in the regiment , the family building of this group was completely destroyed by the rules and regulations , which made the number of housing difficulties for the existing cadres , and the officers and men have a rather big opinion on this .
the group also had a few sor@@ ties .

jing@@ jiang city people 's armed forces ' platform has been upgraded
the first batch of the red flag , which was built by zhu ji@@ ay@@ an , was formally put into operation on 18 june in jing@@ wu city , jiangsu province . the number of armed forces coming from xin@@ l@@ ou town , minister of state lu qing , was given a lecture on " fighting and winning a war under the condition of informatization . " the cad@@ ets were unanimously accepted by the students in the course of the course of the course of the course of the course of the course of the training .
this is the common understanding of the " red army " in the light of the reality of the work posts of the wu@@ yi department , and is making great efforts to improve the overall quality of cadres of specialized armed forces .
at the beginning of this year , the party committee of the ministry of people 's armed forces discovered during their investigation and study that some cadres working for master du yu@@ zhi were suspected of being involved in smuggling , not taking up their posts , and not concentr@@ ating their main energy on armed work .
to this end , they have adopted the method of concentr@@ ating training on research work in places where the congress is relying on training in local party schools and other methods to train specialized cadres at regular inter@@ vals and to focus on solving problems of knowledge of military cadres such as knowledge of military affairs , un@@ it@@ ary professional knowledge among military cadres .
in light of the central task , we should boldly send cadres to work in areas such as mine , gas , and gas , to train them through work posts , and enhance their ability to work for posts .
at the same time , they actively coordinated local organizational departments and jointly formulated the " regulations on the competitive hir@@ ing of specialized military cadres " and clearly stipulated that the armed forces ministers must be recru@@ ited under the party committee , and they no longer engage in other jobs ;
and established a system for the adjustment and exchange of cadres with full - time military strength , which is not suitable for grassroots armed forces work at the grassroots level , to adjust and exchange in a timely manner , to strengthen the work ability of comrades who are comprehensive quality , good at work , and strong in promoting and employing them .
not long ago , the new century company 's chief of the armed forces , chen yi@@ song , led the militi@@ a technical detachment in innov@@ ating and developing under@@ water technology , filled the gap in domestic monopoly , and was upgraded to the head of the armed forces department of the company .
good at doing things , we should also be good at the end .
from the results of the competition alone , the two - 2 score was only the rational , but the difference was also the result of being accepted by all , and the key was the process of the competition , so much regre@@ ts it .
if iran is 2 - 1 , it will be the same as other countries in the world .
good at the start can not be a good end , but it can be said that it is an old problem .
they often
this is indeed not a problem of being honest by nature .
however , from the perspective of today 's competition , the competition seems to be un@@ finished .
sun ji@@ hai , deputy director of the qing@@ xiang huaicheng administration , said that the idea of building a modern enterprise system in europe was not mentioned , but li wei and others also were the long - tested " red ri@@ b@@ bon " that they saw .
the reason why li ga@@ o@@ yi was forced to p@@ ack out of the m@@ ire was that he was in a position to over@@ throw the re@@ treat .
iran 's team won the first round of the world cup in a backward condition , and the scene was completely tor@@ tured .

we should overcome the mentality of being good at the start and not good at the end , and we must find the root cause for the problem .
as long as the problem is accurately identified and the problem is correc@@ ted , it is not difficult to find a solution .
i am afraid that i am afraid of being in a state of emergency and taking medicine .
if this goes on , it will k@@ ick the idea of more competition . old problems are still very serious .
