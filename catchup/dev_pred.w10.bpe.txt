prc expert says us ' unreasonable ' to ' china 's military threat '
beijing , february 9 ( xinhua ) the chinese government has decided to provide a new security guarantee for the us military to meet the needs of the us military , the pentagon said here today
experts believe that this is an unreasonable accus@@ ation and a pan@@ ic about china 's normal national defense construction , playing up the chinese military threat theory , and interfering in china 's internal affairs .
the " four - year defense review report " is a new defense guidance document of the pentagon .
the 92 - page report used three par@@ agr@@ ap@@ h@@ s to exp@@ ound the chinese military power and the us response , with a total of 15 directly mentioned china 's ' imper@@ ial ' or ' chinese ' ' words , ' and said that as a ' major ' and ' regional ' , the united states has the most important and most important role to compete with the united states .
yao yun@@ zhu , research fellow of the world military research department of the chinese academy of military sciences , said that although senior us officials had expressed similar viewpoints many times before , this was the first time that the united states put forward in the strategic report on national defense strategy that china is the newly emerging big power that is most likely to pose a military challenge to the united states .
the ' report ' explicitly defin@@ es russia 's role as a newly emerging strategic oppon@@ ent , especially the so - called ' china threat theory , ' as a newly emerging strategic oppon@@ ent , and gives more attention to the so - called china military threat theory .
major general peng guang@@ qian , research fellow of the chinese academy of military sciences , said :
what merits attention is that in the " four - year defense review report " formally submitted , us president bush also submitted to the congress the draft government budget for fiscal year 2007 , which includes the defense budget for the fiscal year of $ 4@@ 3@@ 9.@@ 3 - billion .
if the united states and iraq add military action to iraq and afghanistan , the us budget for the fiscal year 2007 will exceed 5,000 billion us dollars .
peng guang@@ qian held that the us tr@@ ick of specul@@ ating on the threat of other countries reflects the pentagon 's consistent style of creating enemies , and its real purpose is to win more national defense funds and provide a powerful weapon industry for the united states ' huge arms industry .
experts say that compared with the huge military spending of the united states , china 's national defense expenditures are quite limited .
military experts deng hong@@ zhou , who had participated in the drafting of china 's national defense white paper on many occasions , said : since the 1990 's , with economic development , china 's national defense expenditures have increased somewhat , but the proportion of national financial expenditures has dropped in the same period .
official statistics show that in 2004 and 1979 , china 's national defense expenditures accounted for nearly 10 percent of the national financial expenditures for the same period .
china 's national defense spending in 2005 was 24@@ 4.@@ 6@@ 56 - billion yuan , only about one - tenth of the united states ' total national military spending , which is equivalent to about one - sixth of the united states ' per capita military spending , and the per capita military spending is about one - third of the us military spending .
the united states ' territory is r@@ oughly the same as china 's territory , but the difference in military spending is so huge , and who 's actually military strength exceeds the normal defense needs , and this is self - evident .
peng guang@@ qian said :
teng jian@@ q@@ un , director of the research department of the china arms control and disarmament association , said that the us side should obj@@ ectively evalu@@ ate china 's military construction , and that china 's peaceful development does not mean that china and the united states will become military oppon@@ ents in the future .
the white paper " china 's national defense in 2004 " says that china firmly follows the path of peaceful development and pursu@@ es a defensive national defense policy .
china has not in the past and will not pose a threat to any country .
so far , china has not established military bases in any other country , nor has it sent a p@@ aw@@ n to other countries , while the united states has more than 100 military bases overseas , and it has deployed more than 100 military bases in asia alone .
zhu feng , professor at the institute of international relations of beijing university , said that china and the united states should increase communication and exchanges through established channels , enhance understanding and mutual trust , and comprehensively promote the constructive and cooperative relations between china and the united states in the new century so as to jointly promote world peace and development .

( international observation ) hamas to form cabinet to seek breakthroughs
ram@@ al@@ lah , february 9 ( xinhua ) hamas has decided to form a cabinet to seek breakthroughs
xinhua news agency , beijing , march 22 ,
the palestinian islamic resistance movement ( hamas ) has won the election of the legislative council , how to draw up a blueprint for the new government has become the focus of attention in the world at present .
what new policy will hamas pursue directly affect the relevant parties in the peace process in the next step .
at the same time , the bo@@ y@@ co@@ tt attitude of the united states and israel has added vari@@ ables to the prospect of the hamas government .
at present , all parties in palestine are stepping up consultation and making a thorough and frank discussion on the difficulties and sensitive points in forming a cabinet that may affect the future development of the situation .
the prime minister 's position has fl@@ owed down to the family .
after hamas obtained the right to form a cabinet , some people in the outside world worried that the hamas prime minister 's proposal might have a difference with the current top leader ab@@ b@@ as .
in addition , hamas leader mo@@ ham@@ mad al-@@ m@@ ash@@ ar , who is visiting egypt , stressed that the new palestinian government led by hamas will not recognize israel , and this tough signal has also aggrav@@ ated the international concern .
the united states and israel have clearly stated that they do not accept a hamas government that has real power , and have used this as a threat to hal@@ t the economic aid to palestine and to hand over tax to the palestinians .
however , this does not obstruc@@ t hamas from making flexible strategic adjustments , and it is a compromise to elect an independent person .
according to reports , in order to obtain international recognition to the maximum , the hamas leaders at home and abroad , who are gathering in egypt , decided to elect an independent candidate , j@@ a@@ me@@ ar@@ i ho@@ d@@ or@@ i , chairman of the board of directors of the gaza islamic university , to be the new prime minister .
this move has not received any response from the parties concerned .
palestinian analysts hos@@ se@@ in said that no matter who the premier 's post will be , the most crucial thing is that the prime minister should try as much as possible to play down hamas 's hard - line gu@@ y , and only by so doing can the successful formation of a cabinet be achieved .
how to distribu@@ te power ( sub@@ head )
the biggest challenge facing hamas in forming a cabinet is that it lacks sufficient experience in governance .
an analysis carried by the palestinian newspaper " sun@@ sh@@ ine " said that hamas has gathered people 's morale through social welfare projects , but it lacks experience in governance and is closely linked with the ruling palestinian national liberation movement ( fat@@ ah ) , which has experience .
after the election , hamas proposed establishing a political partnership with fat@@ ah , jointly forming a national coalition government , but fat@@ ah has not given a positive response to this .
within fat@@ ah , there are different opinions on whether to join the cabinet , and one faction advocates participating in the new government so that it can do something , while the other faction ref@@ uses to invite the invitation , and is willing to act as a positive opposition party in the legislative yuan .
the source pointed out that , with ab@@ b@@ as 's advice , fat@@ ah gradually ten@@ ds to join the new government .
even if this is the case , hamas and fat@@ ah will barg@@ ain over the distribution of cabinet positions .
in addition , the other way is that the framework of the legislative yuan is a cabinet that is not subordinate to the party .
according to reports , hamas has also designed a clean - up expert - type government , but the specific list is unknown .
in view of the attitude of the united states and israel , the technology expert - type government is also not out of the question of forming a cabinet by reducing external pressure .
according to the palestinian " basic law , " after the new legislative council took office on 16 february , the work of nom@@ in@@ ating the prime minister and forming the cabinet will be completed within three to five weeks .
where is the course of armed forces ?
the weapons in hamas 's hands are another thor@@ ny issue facing the establishment of a new government .
the us and israel have taken a very tough stance , and have resolutely demanded that hamas abandon violence and refuse to take part in the government .
hamas leader ma sh@@ ar stressed on 9 november that armed resistance is a strategic choice made by the organization .
the question of armed force actually includes the leg@@ ality of weapons and the issue of the management of the armed forces at both levels .
hamas elected as first party in the legislative council through democracy and freedom has won international recognition , making it a major armed organization of the hamas , a member of the armed factions , and a leg@@ alized one , that is , to unify it with the government 's security organs .
hamas once proposed to unify armed forces of all factions into a " war of terror " for the palestinian national authority , but did not receive a wide response , and was also criticized by the palestinian islamic ji@@ had ( j@@ ade ) .
palestine now has more than 6@@ 0,000 security personnel , and the overwhelming majority of them come from the fat@@ ah camp .
in addition , fat@@ ah also has some armed factions that are lo@@ ose in organization relations , such as the imper@@ ial guard of the al-@@ aq@@ sa marty@@ rs ' x@@ ish@@ a , the fat@@ ah spirit , and so on .
hamas , who is in charge of forming a cabinet , must reach agreement with ab@@ b@@ as on how to manage these armed forces that are under their own administration and ration@@ ally distribu@@ te security management powers .
according to local media reports , ab@@ b@@ as inten@@ ds to be in charge of security and intelligence units , police , civil defense , and other organizations , but the interior ministry of the new government will be under the control of the new government .
however , all parties are still holding consultations on this sensitive issue , and so far there is no further article .

currently , we are working to establish the third ant@@ arc@@ tic research station , and it is also china 's first inland inspection station in the ant@@ arc@@ tic ocean to conduct feasibility studies and research work .
sun zhi@@ hui said :
after more than 20 years of hard work , china 's polar exploration project has occupied a leading position in the world 's polar exploration , but it is still not the same as other major polar observation countries .
he said .
sun zhi@@ hui disclosed that china will publish annual report on polar observation in the future .

t@@ k@@ p becomes mainstream in us
new york , february 12 ( xinhua ) the number of new - generation television sets ( q@@ u zi zi zi zi xiang ) and the market continued to expand , with the increase of the prices of high - resolution digital sets , the us television media also stepped up its efforts to introduce a corresponding high - definition television program .
the american super@@ b@@ ow@@ l soccer match that has just ended has become a major event in the american broadcasting industry to gre@@ et the high - qing era .
according to a report by the financial times a few days ago , the us congress recently passed a bill , stipul@@ ating that the american broadcasting industry must completely stop broadcasting the current simul@@ ated television signals on 17 february 200@@ 9 , and that it can only broadcast digital signals .
this means that the overall dig@@ iti@@ zed broadcast of american television programs has a clear timetable .
the popul@@ arization of high - resolution digital television requires consumers to buy tv sets while on the one hand , it depends on the production agency to provide high - definition digital programs .
although digital television has been repeatedly mentioned in the past few years , it has never become a reality .
this problem has taken a turn for the better this year .
according to the forecast of the american consumer electronics association , the number of digital television sets sold in the united states this year will exceed that of traditional tv sets for the first time , while 8@@ 5.@@ 5 percent of the digital tv sets are high - resolution products .
japanese researchers develop new highly effective human kid@@ ney
tokyo , february 13 ( xinhua ) the research institute of the east china sea university of japan has developed a biological human - to - human kid@@ ney - - making kid@@ ney - making function , which is not only the same as human kid@@ ney but also has the function of preserving the material ing@@ re@@ di@@ ents , and is small in volume and easy to trans@@ plant . as the research deep@@ ens , it is hop@@ eful that it will bring about fu@@ els for kid@@ ney patients .
according to a report by the ni@@ x@@ on industrial news a few days ago , the newly developed bi@@ om@@ ass - made kid@@ ne@@ ys are mainly composed of two parts , and the part is to fil@@ ter tr@@ ation of tr@@ uc@@ ks from blood , tr@@ ash , and water in blood . the other is to use a large quantity of blood , including the water div@@ id@@ er and the kid@@ ney , which have returned to blood .
the pe@@ t@@ ty cre@@ am and the th@@ um@@ bs built by the imper@@ ial body are made by the sil@@ ic@@ on w@@ ire of the central and the th@@ in ca@@ ve of the man , and the inside of the th@@ in ca@@ ve is filled with the di@@ vi@@ ding function of the sub@@ stitu@@ te cell@@ s .
this s@@ kin@@ s cell@@ s can make many blood analysis of the diseases that have caused so much so that the disease can be considered as a vari@@ able due to the sub@@ str@@ at@@ um of the material to be used as a mag@@ ic ac@@ id and return to blood , while at the same time it can also enable the body to re@@ enter the water , such as the gl@@ ass needed for body , the sol@@ ar , and the sub@@ stances , etc.
in the past , the fil@@ tr@@ ation of human - made kid@@ ne@@ ys by relying on penetr@@ ation pressure cannot completely remove them and does not have the conditions to make am@@ az@@ ic ac@@ id and other components return to blood .
researchers used the she@@ ep to carry out experiments on biological human - made kid@@ ney trans@@ pl@@ ant@@ ation , using pi@@ g - on - sk@@ in cell@@ s in the c@@ ement of the human - made kid@@ ney .
two weeks later , researchers confirmed that human - made kid@@ ne@@ ys had been able to function .
at present , they are developing bio@@ human kid@@ ney for use of human kid@@ ney cell@@ s and will start clin@@ ical research after testing their safety .
china 's power industry faces severe challenges
beijing , february 13 ( xinhua ) the state power administration ( s@@ as@@ ac ) said on wednesday that the country 's power industry has maintained a stable growth in the year 2005 despite the fact that the country 's power industry has maintained a stable production safety situation .
shi yu@@ bo , vice chairman of the national electricity safety supervision commission , said here at the fifth meeting of the national electricity safety commission ( enlarg@@ ed ) that china 's power industry will have a stable and satisfactory completion of the summer mission of power generation to meet the peak of summer and to ensure safety and electricity supply , actively deal with the in@@ tru@@ sion of natural disasters , and basically guarantee the safe and stable operation of the power system .
however , he pointed out that with the changes in the supply and demand situation of power supply and demand and the successive commissi@@ oning of a large number of new generating units , the safe production of electric power will face new challenges .
these challenges include the regional seas@@ onal vari@@ ation of power shortage , and the supply and demand situation in some regions remains tight , and the prices of coal have not yet formed due to the sound mechanism of coal prices , causing a relatively big problem in coal supply . meanwhile , the problem of the decline in coal quality has not been effectively controlled , and the impact on the stable operation of power generating units will be seriously affected , and some of the power gr@@ id , equipment , and the hidden safety of power
shi yu@@ bo said : as the reform of the power system deep@@ ens , many deep - se@@ ated contradictions will continue to be exposed . how to maintain the stability of the workers ' ranks and ensure normal production order will become a new problem facing us .
in view of the work of safe production in 2006 , shi y@@ ul@@ i@@ u said that it is necessary to further consolidate the foundation work for safe production of electric power , speed up the establishment and improvement of contingency management mechanisms for power safety , enhance the capability of handling sudden incidents , strengthen coordination and cooperation between power plants and networks , and jointly safeguard the safety of power systems , continue to do a good job in supervising and managing the construction of dam@@ s and informationization , and strengthen safety in power construction and
it has been learned that in light of the new situation in power safety management , the commission will conduct a special inspection of the " interim regulations on investigation of power accidents " promulgated this year . at the same time , relevant regulations on the safety of the dam of the hydr@@ op@@ ower station and the safety protection of the second system of the power plant will be issued this year .
in 2005 , china 's entire society used 24@@ 6.@@ 89 - billion kil@@ ow@@ at@@ ts of electricity , up 13.@@ 45 percent from the same period last year .
in the face of the situation of supply and demand for power , which is still tight , and the contradiction between coal , electricity , oil , and transport is conspicuous , all power enterprises have conscientiously adopted effective measures to strengthen equipment management , and last year , no major equipment accident occurred in the country 's power production .
the number of power gr@@ i@@ ds has dropped by 1@@ 27 , and the number of equipment accidents has dropped by 4@@ 27 , a year - on - year decrease of 13@@ 2 .
south african envoy to china said that there is no such thing as organized crime against chinese citizens
beijing , february 13 ( xinhua ) south african embassy in china hosted a reception here today to mark the opening of the south african embassy in china , which is the first country to be built in south africa , which is a non - organized crime against chinese citizens .
he also said that the south african government would do its best to crack down on all forms of crime .
the south african government hopes to cut the crime rate to zero and hopes to be a " zero " crime , fu said , expressing the hope that the safety of life and property of every foreigners working in south africa will be fully protected by local laws and citizens .
since 2006 , four chinese citizens have been killed in south africa , and the chinese world has expressed a broad concern over this .
the chinese ministry of foreign affairs has made representations to the south african side over this issue and has reminded chinese citizens in southern africa to further enhance their sense of security and to strengthen unity and friendship among overseas chinese and to cooperate with the police in cracking down on criminal activities .
lu yong@@ xiang said that we sincerely symp@@ ath@@ ize with and m@@ our@@ n the victims ' families .
fu k@@ ang@@ ning said : we regret this and ask the chinese people to believe that the south african government is now earnestly investigating every case involving china .
according to the chinese embassy in south africa , the south african police have successfully cracked a case of chinese woman chen jian@@ qing who was killed in south africa on february 5 , and a suspect has been arrested .
the police are now hun@@ ting for another suspect .
according to the south african embassy in china , criminals suspected of shooting and killing hong kong businessmen in january this year have been arrested by south african police , and the property of the victims have been recovered .
on the possible impact of the incident of chinese citizens ' ass@@ as@@ sin@@ ation , fu k@@ ang@@ ning said that these incidents indeed would have a negative impact on the trade , tourism , and other areas between the two countries , but from a long - term point of view , the impact should not be too big as it is .
the south african embassy has only set up a special office in the first 15 days of this year to help more than 2,000 chinese people to visit south africa , the official said .
according to chinese official statistics , south africa will continue to maintain china 's largest trade partner in africa in 2005 .
the bilateral trade volume reached $ 7.@@ 27 billion , up 2@@ 3.@@ 0 percent over the same period last year .
however , people in the tourism industry believe that the successive chinese citizens ' ass@@ as@@ sin@@ ation in 2004 has a significant impact on the number of chinese tourists visiting south africa .
according to statistics from the south african tourism bureau , in the first half of 2005 , 20@@ ,@@ 3@@ 31 chinese tourists visited south africa , a decrease of 14.@@ 9@@ 9 percent compared with the same period last year .
currently , there are about 200,000 chinese living in south africa , and the towns and villages in south africa are all covered .
analysts here hold that the rich - poor gap in south africa is widening , the unemployment rate is high , and guns are rampant , and there is no death penalty deterr@@ ent , so the crime rate is still high .
because many chinese do not understand english , they have cash with their bodies and their homes , and this is more easily becoming the targets of criminal elements seeking money .

state administration of safety supervision : china to curb the occurrence of major and extra@@ ordin@@ arily serious accidents in coal mines
beijing , february 17 ( xinhua ) four successive accidents of one hundred people in a mine accident occurred in beijing , where more than 100 people were killed , and the grim situation of production safety in the past year caused the serious accidents of mine - checking and other heavy and extra@@ ordin@@ arily serious accidents , including mine - sh@@ ut@@ ting , to become the most important tasks of the national security supervision work this year .
on 17 july , this reporter learned from the state administration of supervision and management of production safety that in order to effectively check the occurrence of major and serious accidents like coal mines , coal mines are the most important among all .
this year , the state administration of coal mine safety and the state administration of safety will do a good job in the following three things :
x@@ uan xiang continued to fight w@@ as@@ an@@ si .
this year , w@@ all@@ as must first take out the bu@@ c@@ ket and then put it in a prominent position .
if the gas mine is not pu@@ m@@ ped out in advance , then it should be ordered to stop production immediately .
prc : jing@@ ji ribao urges us to continue to fight a battle to straigh@@ ten out and attack the enemy .
we should regard the 5,@@ 2@@ 43 public announc@@ ements that have been made to the society , and the more than 700 coal mine p@@ its recently reported by various localities , one that has been closed down to death .
we should regard closing down of enterprises as a regular task and continuously close down those coal mines that do not have safety conditions for destroying resources and pollu@@ ting environment .
x@@ uan , strengthening basic management of coal mine safety .
it is necessary to immediately correct the practice of stopping a small number of small state - owned mines from sli@@ pping down and guiding the management of small mines to establish a standardized safety management system .
in particular , we should grasp key state - owned coal mines and absolutely not allow excessive capacity to over@@ take production .
this year 's production safety control indices require that the number of deaths of all types in the country dropped by 3@@ 5.@@ 5 percent compared with last year .
the excep@@ tionally serious accident of more than 10 deaths per day will drop by 5 percent , with coal mines falling by 7@@ -@@ 7 percent .
these control indices have been assigned to all provincial - level people 's governments , and localities are implementing them at different levels to grassroots and enterprises .
statistics show that in 2005 , 5@@ 9@@ 86 coal mine accidents were killed , down by 0.@@ 77 percent compared with the same period last year .
however , the number of people killed in a major accident involving more than 10 people rose 6@@ 6.@@ 6 percent compared with the same period last year .

( winter olympics , d@@ oping ) news analysis : it is possible that the incident of sending out the le@@ af may not be a clear thing .
xinhua news agency , du@@ ling@@ yan , february 17 , by w@@ ire ( reporter : ) news analysis : it is possible that the incident of sending out a girl is un@@ clear .
xinhua news agency , gao peng ,
although italy has repeatedly issued an order , saying that the use of stimul@@ ant for the games in tur@@ in 's winter olympics may be facing the ha@@ ug@@ h@@ ty disaster , but the situation is still quite different from the present situation .
since the opening of the tur@@ in winter olympics on 16 june , the first d@@ oping scand@@ al has been discovered , and ob@@ as@@ an@@ j@@ o has been used as banned drug card .
the international olympic committee announced the next day that it had sent out a li@@ e@@ a to the winter olympics , and she had won the second winter olympics in the women 's 15 - kilome@@ ter individual game .
the two international winter second union ( i@@ ap ) made a two - year penalty decision on the sec@@ t@@ arian ban on the same day .
the international olympic committee has always stipulated that athletes are found to be using stimul@@ ants in the olympic games , and will be canc@@ elled and depriv@@ ed of their quali@@ fication for the competition , but they are not subject to legal sanctions .
however , according to italian law , the driver of a play@@ er carrying and using stimul@@ ant bel@@ ong@@ ing to criminal activities is liable to direct arrest and investigation of an athle@@ te using stimul@@ ant , and the law@@ yer who def@@ ects the law is still facing imprisonment ranging from three months to three years .
last december , the international olympic committee and the italian government , after a year - long barg@@ aining and barg@@ aining price , finally reached an agreement , and both sides agreed to hold a meeting in accordance with the italian law during the winter olympics .
with the unremitting efforts of the international olympic committee , italy made a concession four days before the opening of the winter olympics , promising that the police would not enter the olympic village to search for the athle@@ te 's place during the winter olympics , but athletes with positive drug prosecu@@ tions will still be subject to investigation by the italian procuratorial organ .
it has been reported that officials of the italian government over@@ seeing the tur@@ in winter olympics , p@@ ast@@ eur , have already handed over the d@@ oping incident to the re@@ form@@ atory procuratorate .
however , the i@@ oc and pe@@ ter can@@ t@@ on have not confirmed the matter .
the two teams of the russian winter second team , an@@ an de@@ v , disclosed at noon on 17 june that le@@ uk@@ a had already left tur@@ in and returned to the country .
he has been a member of the chinese sports official who has worked in the world anti - d@@ oping agency for many years . he said that once a le@@ af is sent back to china , this matter will eventually be a " cr@@ un@@ ch " .
shi k@@ ang@@ cheng said : the international olympic committee and the italian government have always had no f@@ od@@ der on the issue of anti - d@@ oping at the winter olympics . even if italian procuratorial organs really interven@@ e in this matter , it is hard to say that the result is very difficult .
according to the previous ruling of the case of the italian court using stimul@@ ant to the national athle@@ te , the most serious punishment given by the b@@ ans is only the case in which the two countries were sentenced to imprisonment and suspended for the year .
therefore , a senior correspon@@ dent of the italian am@@ a@@ a said that the possibility of sending le@@ i@@ a to prison is a little bit un@@ wise , and that is , a fine is the most important thing .
p@@ el@@ e also said that although the italian court could be tried out in a abs@@ ence , the italian police could not possibly send a foreign gu@@ y to take back and serve the sentence .
if it sent a si@@ eg@@ e to refuse to accept the verdic@@ t , the italian side would also have no way to take her .
