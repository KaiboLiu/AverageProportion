after gradu@@ ating from college students , the job they find was not as good as they were . finally , they were hung up at a hotel and played the background music with a pi@@ an@@ o .
i am quite satisfied with my current work , and i have a 100 yuan per hour , and the environment , what i am doing now is to find several hours of work , i do n't know how many hours i 'm going to work .
it is understood that the hours of work have become a bit of experience in the work of graduates seeking jobs , skills training , skills communication skills , and skills enhancement in social experience .
the graduates work on an hour mainly in knowledge and skill positions , such as specialized skills , and high - cali@@ ber transl@@ ation jobs , the characteristics of the times , and the characteristics of the times .
the skills required for some of the job posts are not high , such as food sales promotion workers and sal@@ es@@ person , and unemployed personnel can get their jobs through simple training .
the data show that among the people in the hours , the original ratio of the unemployed is 3@@ 9@@ -@@ 9 percent , of which the proportion of the unemployed in the retail category is as high as 6@@ 8.@@ 44 percent , and the proportion of the cat@@ ering industry is 5@@ 8.@@ 7 percent , and the work hours have become an important channel for the unemployed to find jobs .

prc expert : us advoc@@ ation of prc military threat not justi@@ fi@@ able
beijing , february 9 ( xinhua ) the chinese government has decided to set up a national defense research center in the united states in the next few days , and to make a report on the defense review of four years to congress , saying that china is the most likely new major power to pose a military challenge to the united states .
experts believe that this is an unreasonable accus@@ ation and ex@@ ag@@ ger@@ ating the china military threat theory , and is a interference in china 's internal affairs .
the " four - year defense review report " is a new defense guidance document for the pentagon .
the 92 - page report used three par@@ agr@@ ap@@ h@@ s to discuss china 's military strength and the countermeasures that the united states should take , which directly mentioned china 's 92 or chinese ' 92 or chinese ' -- these two phr@@ ases , saying that as a major regional and international organization , china is still the largest developing country with the united states in military competition .
yao yun@@ zhu , a resear@@ cher at the world military research department of the chinese academy of military sciences , said : even though senior us officials have expressed similar viewpoints many times , this is the first report of the us department of defense strategy , which proposed that china should be a newly emerging power that is most likely to challenge military challenges .
the report clearly defin@@ es russia 's role as a newly emerging strategic oppon@@ ent , especially the so - called military threat theory in china .
major general peng guang@@ qian , research fellow of the chinese academy of military sciences , said :
it is no@@ te@@ worthy that , in the same report formally submitted to the " four - year defense review , " us president bush also submitted to congress a government budget for fiscal 2007 , including a defense budget of 4@@ 3.@@ 9@@ 3 - billion us dollars .
if the united states is to add the additional budget for military actions in iraq and afghanistan , the us national defense budget for fiscal 2007 will exceed $ 500 - billion , setting a new high , peng guang@@ qian said , " it is almost the same thing for this , " it is almost equivalent to the total military expenditure of all other countries in the world . "
peng guang@@ qian held that the us specul@@ ation of the threat from other countries reflects the pentagon 's consistent style of creating an enemy 's + style , and its real purpose is to win more national defense funds and provide a false impression of the huge us arms industry group .
experts say that compared with the huge military spending of the united states , china 's national defense spending is very limited .
military experts deng hong@@ zhou , who had participated in many times in the drafting of china 's national defense white paper , said : since the 1990 's , as the economy developed , china 's national defense expenditures have increased somewhat , but the proportion of the state 's financial expenditures has been on the whole decreas@@ ing trend .
official statistics show that china 's defense spending accounts for over 10 percent of the state 's financial expenditure in 2004 compared with 1979 .
china 's national defense spending in 2005 was 24@@ 4.@@ 6@@ 56 billion yuan , only about one - tenth of the us total , and the per capita military spending of the people was only about one - sixth of the us figure , and the per capita military spending was about one - thir@@ ty of the us military .
the area of the united states is r@@ oughly the same as that of china 's territory , but the difference in military spending is so huge , who is in fact the military force that exceeds the proper defense needs ? this is quite self - evident .
peng guang@@ qian said :
teng jian@@ q@@ un , director of the research department of the china arms control and disarmament association , said that the us side should obj@@ ectively assess china 's military construction , and china 's peaceful development does not mean that china and the united states will become military ri@@ vals in the future .
the white paper entitled " china 's national defense in 2004 " says that china firmly follows the path of peaceful development and practices a defensive national defense policy .
china did not have a play@@ er in the past or at present , nor will it pose a threat to any country .
so far , china has not established military bases in any other country , nor has it sent a single soldier to other countries , but the united states has more than 100 military bases overseas , and it has only deployed military bases in asia , with more than 100,000 troops .
zhu feng , professor at the international relations college of beijing university , said that china and the united states should , through the established channels , increase communication and exchanges , enhance understanding and mutual trust , comprehensively advance sino - us constructive cooperative relations in the new century , and jointly promote world peace and development .

hamas seeks to form cabinet to achieve breakthrough
ram@@ al@@ lah , february 9 ( xinhua ) hamas has formed a cabinet to seek a breakthrough
xinhua news agency , wang hao , huang min
the palestinian islamic resistance movement ( hamas ) has won a victory in the legislative elections , how to draw a blueprint for the new government has become the focus of attention in the world today .
what new policy hamas will pursue will directly affect the relevant parties in the peace process in the next step of their policy direction .
at the same time , the resistance attitude of the united states and israel has added more vari@@ ables to the prospects of the hamas government .
at present , all sides in palestine are stepping up consultations to reach a consensus on the difficulties and sensitive points in the formation of a cabinet that will touch on the development of the situation in the future .
who has spent the premier post ?
after hamas won the cabinet , some people were worried that the current top leader , ab@@ b@@ as , might have dis@@ agreements with the current hamas prime minister .
in addition , hamas leader m@@ ash@@ el , who is visiting egypt , stressed that the new palestinian government led by hamas will not recognize israel , and this strong signal has also aggrav@@ ated the international concern .
the united states and israel have clearly indicated that they do not accept a hamas government that has real power , and this threatened to suspend economic aid to palestine and to hand over taxes to palestine .
however , this does not prevent hamas from making flexible strategic adjustments , and it is a compromise to elect an independent person .
according to reports , in order to obtain international recognition to the maximum , hamas leaders , home and abroad , who gathered in egypt , recently decided to select the independent people 's she@@ i@@ k@@ h ah@@ mad al-@@ j@@ ah@@ mad al-@@ ha@@ h , chairman of the board of directors of the saudi islamic university , to become the new prime minister .
this move has not yet received any response from the parties concerned .
palestinian analy@@ st hus@@ se@@ in said that the most crucial thing for the prime minister to be elected is to less@@ en hamas 's hard - line color as far as possible , and only by so doing will it be possible to succeed in forming the cabinet .
how should power be distributed ?
inter@@ n@@ ally , the biggest challenge facing hamas in forming a cabinet is its lack of sufficient governing experience .
according to an article in the palestinian " sun@@ sh@@ ine , " hamas has gathered its people through social welfare projects , but it lacks experience in governance , and has no connection with the palestinian national liberation movement ( fat@@ ah ) , which has the governing experience .
after the election , hamas proposed establishing political partnership with fat@@ ah to jointly establish a national coalition government , but fat@@ ah has not given a positive response to this .
fat@@ ah has different opinions on whether to join the cabinet . one faction advocates to join the new government and then the other is rej@@ ecting hamas 's invitation and is willing to make a recommendation on the legisl@@ ature , a positive opposition faction .
informed sources pointed out that , under ab@@ b@@ as 's persu@@ asion , fat@@ ah gradually ten@@ ds to join the new government .
even so , hamas and fat@@ ah will also hold talks on the distribution of cabinet posts .
in addition , the other way is to set up a framework of the legislative yuan and to separate the cabinet of the parties .
it is reported that hamas has also designed a clean - up expert - style government , but the specific list is unknown .
in view of the attitude of the united states and israel , the technical expert - type government is also unable to be regarded as a form of forming a cabinet that will reduce external pressure .
according to the provisions of the palestinian " basic law , " after the new legislative council takes office on 16 june , the work of nom@@ in@@ ating the prime minister and forming the cabinet will be completed within three to five weeks .
what course will armed forces follow ( sub@@ head )
the weapons in hamas are another thor@@ ny issue facing the new government .
the united states and israel are very tough in their attitude , and they resolutely demand that hamas abandon violence and rej@@ ect its armed participation in government and political affairs .
hamas leader m@@ ash@@ el stressed on 9 july that armed resistance is a strategic choice of the organization .
the question of armed forces actually includes the legi@@ tim@@ acy of weapons and the management of the ownership of armed forces .
hamas was elected the first major legisl@@ ature through a democratic and free way , and was recognized internationally . as a result , the armed factions under hamas were leg@@ alized , like a leg@@ alized one , that is , it was to bring it into the government 's security organs .
hamas once proposed that all factions be re@@ unified to be armed forces of the palestinian national authority , but did not receive a wide response , and it was also rejected by the palestinian islamic ji@@ had ( je@@ h@@ ad@@ i ) .
palestine now has over 6@@ 0,000 security personnel and the overwhelming majority of them come from the fat@@ ah camp .
in addition , fat@@ ah also has some armed factions that are lo@@ ose in organizational relations , such as the al-@@ aq@@ sa marty@@ rs ' brigade , the fat@@ ah organization , etc.
hamas , which is in charge of forming a cabinet , must reach an agreement with ab@@ b@@ as on how to manage these armed forces that are each doing its own affairs , and ration@@ ally distribu@@ te security management authority .
according to local media reports , ab@@ b@@ as inten@@ ds to take charge of security and intelligence units , police , civil defense agencies , and other organizations , and the interior ministry of the new government will centr@@ alize the management of the security and intelligence units .
however , the parties are still holding consultations on this sensitive issue , and so far no further details have been found .

h@@ d@@ tv becomes mainstream in us
new york , february 12 ( xinhua ) the new york - based electr@@ o - chi@@ u chi television set set prices for high resolution television sets ( chi fu ) and the down@@ ward sli@@ de of the market have been continuously expanding , and us television media have also stepped up their efforts to introduce corresponding tv programs for high - definition tv programs .
the recently - dis@@ appe@@ aring american super - soccer ball game has become a major event for american broadcasting industry to gre@@ et the era of t@@ all@@ ying .
according to a financial times report , the us congress recently passed a bill , stipul@@ ating that american broadcasting industry figures must stop all broadcasting on february 17 , 200@@ 9 , the current m@@ ock television signal , and that only digital signals can be broadcast .
this means that the comprehensive dig@@ iti@@ zation of american tv programs has already had a clear timetable .
the popul@@ arization of high resolution digital television on the one hand requires consumers to buy tv sets , and on the other hand , it depends on the production agency to provide high - resolution digital programs .

this problem has taken a turn for the better this year .
according to a forecast by the american consumer electronics association , the number of digital television sets sold in the united states will exceed the traditional t@@ v@@ s for the first time , while 8@@ 5.@@ 0 percent of the digital tv sets will be high resolution products .
japanese researchers have developed new highly efficient human kid@@ ney
tokyo , february 13 ( xinhua ) a research team of the east china sea university of japan has developed a biological human kid@@ ney - making kid@@ ney , which is not only of the same functions as human kid@@ ne@@ ys , but also has the function of re@@ taining the use of material , and is small in volume and easy to trans@@ plant . as research deep@@ ens , it is expected to bring about good news for patients with kid@@ ney diseases .
according to a recent report by the ni@@ hon ke@@ iz@@ ai industrial news , the newly developed biological man - made kid@@ ney is mainly composed of two parts , with some being the wi@@ ping out of the water and the fil@@ tr@@ ation of the kid@@ ney - building , another part of the kid@@ ney - building from the original ur@@ ine , the hydr@@ og@@ en di@@ am@@ ond , and other types of blood returned to the motherland , and the family of the family of the family of the three , who returned
the village has a small number of problems , such as the kid@@ ney project and the slaugh@@ ter of the people , but the small area has been formed by the sil@@ ver@@ str@@ um , and the residents have also been covered with the ur@@ ine of the sub@@ stitu@@ tion of waste .
this type of sk@@ in cell@@ s can cause multiple blood analysis and analysis of diseases , which caused a serious di@@ e@@ tary pow@@ der vari@@ ation due to a physical di@@ vi@@ ding of the ther@@ a@@ pe@@ u@@ tic ac@@ id and returning to blood , and at the same time , it can also enable the pan@@ els and the co@@ al@@ es@@ ium that are essential to body to enter the blood sub@@ sist@@ ence and min@@ er@@ als .
in the past , the differences in human - made kid@@ ney that reli@@ ed on the per@@ me@@ able pressure to fil@@ ter and fil@@ ter the waste cannot be completely removed , and there is no such problem as re@@ moving hydr@@ oc@@ ar@@ ic ac@@ id into the blood .
researchers used mountain she@@ ep to conduct experiments on biological human kid@@ ney trans@@ plant , and the c@@ ann@@ on w@@ alls inside the arti@@ ficial sil@@ k w@@ ire used pi@@ g 's upper sk@@ in cell@@ s .
two weeks later , researchers confirmed that human kid@@ ney had been able to function .
at present , they are developing and using human kid@@ ney cell@@ s and will be testing their safety before they start clin@@ ical research .

many chinese do not understand english , and they have cash with their families , and this is eas@@ ier for them to seek financial attacks .

( winter olympics ) d@@ oping : news analysis : distribu@@ ting li@@ e@@ que incident may not be a problem .
xinhua news agency , tur@@ in , february 17 , the news analysis by the press : the incident of distribu@@ ting li@@ pp@@ on@@ ai@@ wan may not be settled
xinhua news agency reporter gao peng ying
although italy has repeatedly issued orders and issued such a statement , it has discovered that athletes who use stimul@@ ants may face j@@ ail .
the new olympic games in tur@@ in , capital of east china 's zhejiang province , was the first d@@ oping scand@@ al since the opening of the winter olympics .
the next day , the international olympic committee announced that li@@ u@@ yi@@ ka had been exp@@ elled from the winter olympics , and she had won 15 kilometers of individual individual events in the winter olympics .
the two - way international winter league made a decision on the same day on the punishment for the two - year ban on the allocation of li@@ e@@ yi@@ ka .
the i@@ oc has all along stipulated that athletes have been found to use stimul@@ ant in the olympic games , and they will be canc@@ elled and depriv@@ ed of their quali@@ fication for participating in the games , but they are not subject to legal sanctions .
however , according to italian law , the carrying and use of stimul@@ ant agents is a criminal act , and the judicial organ has the right to directly arrest and investigate athletes using stimul@@ ant , and those who def@@ y the law are also facing three months to three years of imprisonment .
in december last year , the international olympic committee and the italian government paid off one year 's barg@@ aining price , but finally reached an agreement . both sides agreed to hold a meeting in accordance with italian law during the current winter olympics to handle the question of stimul@@ ant use by athletes .
with the unremitting efforts of the international olympic committee , italy made concessions four days before the opening of the winter olympics , and promised that the police would not enter the olympic village to search the athletes ' place during the winter olympics games , but athletes with a positive drug examination will still be subject to investigation by italian prosecu@@ tors .
there are reports that the italian government supervis@@ es the tur@@ in winter olympics , per@@ kin@@ s , has sent li@@ e@@ av@@ es@@ a 's stimul@@ ant incident to the tur@@ in prosecu@@ tor 's office .
however , the i@@ oc and p@@ es@@ k@@ an@@ tor have not yet confirmed the case .
russian winter second team m@@ im@@ ov arrived at the center of the world cup in moscow at noon on the 17@@ th , leaving tur@@ in and returning to the country .
he has been working in the world anti - d@@ oping agency for many years , and chinese sports official shi k@@ ang@@ cheng believes that once the le@@ f@@ t@@ over has returned to china , this ultimately may not be settled by the end .
shi said that the i@@ oc and the italian government have made great efforts to fight d@@ oping in the winter olympics , and have not completely settled the issue of italian prosecu@@ tors , even if italian prosecu@@ tors really interven@@ e in this matter , it is hard to say that the result is hard to tell .
according to the previous judg@@ ement on the use of stimul@@ ant agents by italy for its national athletes , the he@@ avi@@ est punishment received by the banned persons is just the two - year imprisonment suspended period for implementation of the regulation .
therefore , pi@@ er@@ re pi@@ er@@ re , a senior correspon@@ dent from italy 's ant@@ a news agency , said that the possibility of sending le@@ y@@ ball into a prison is almost a small , most of which is a fine .
pi@@ er@@ re also said that although the italian court could be ab@@ sent , the italian police could not even send li@@ e@@ wa back to serve the sentence .
if it sent le@@ f@@ tist to refuse to accept the verdic@@ t , the italian side would have no way to take her .
