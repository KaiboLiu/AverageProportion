if the mon@@ ster plus the us military deployment in iraq and afghanistan ,
peng guang@@ qian maintained that the united states has been making use of the tricks of the theory of the threat of other countries to reflect the consistent style of the enemy 's making the enemy 's remains . its true purpose is to strive for more national defense funds and to make more profits for the huge us arms industrial group .
experts said that compared with the huge military spending of the united states , china 's national defense expenditures are quite limited .
he has been a member of the military expert deng hong@@ zhou , who has participated in several chinese national defense white papers , said : since the 1990 s , with economic development , china 's national defense spending has increased somewhat , but the proportion of national financial expenditures in the same period has generally shown a decline .
official data show that in 2004 , compared with 1979 , china 's national defense spending accounts for over 20 percent of the state 's expenditures for the same period .
in 2005 , china 's national defense expenditure was 24@@ 4@@ 6.@@ 56 - billion yuan , only about 40 percent of the united states , and its per capita military expenditure is only about the us $ 1 - 60 , and the per capita military spending is about $ 2.@@ 1 - billion .
the area of the united states ' territory is basically quite different from that of china 's territory , but the difference in military spending is so big . in the final analysis , who 's military strength exceeds the normal defense needs . this is something that is self - evident .
peng guang@@ qian said :
the research department of the china arms control and disarmament association , teng jian@@ q@@ un , said that the us side should obj@@ ectively evalu@@ ate china 's military construction , and that china 's peaceful development does not mean that china and the united states will become military oppon@@ ents in the future .
the " 2004 china 's national defense " white paper said : china firmly takes the road of peaceful development and practices a defensive national defense policy .
china did not have any future of sh@@ ock in the past , nor will it pose a threat to any country .
so far , china has not established military bases in any other country , nor has it sent military bases to other countries .
professor zhu feng of the international relations college of beijing university said : china and the united states should , through the established channels , increase communication and exchanges , enhance understanding and trust , and comprehensively advance the sino - us constructive and cooperative relations in the new century , and jointly promote the maintenance of world peace and development .

hamas to form cabinet to seek breakthroughs in iraq
xinhua news agency , ram@@ al@@ lah , february 9 ( international observation ) hamas formed a cabinet to seek a breakthrough
xinhua news agency reporter wang hao
the islamic resistance movement of palestine ( hamas ) won the election of the legisl@@ ature , how to draw up a blueprint for the new government has become a focus of current international attention .
what new policies will hamas pursue directly affect the relevant parties in the peace process to correspon@@ d their policy direction next .
at the same time , the bo@@ y@@ co@@ tt attitude of the united states and israel has added to the hamas government 's future .
at present , all sides of the palestinian side are stepping up consultations to reach a consensus on the difficulties and sensitive points related to future developments in the cabinet .
premier 's position has fallen into a dil@@ em@@ ma
hamas has been in power to form a cabinet , and some people in the world are worried that the hamas prime minister 's pro - hamas meeting may have differences with the current top leader ab@@ b@@ as .
moreover , visiting hamas president ma@@ h@@ mu@@ d al-@@ m@@ ash@@ el stressed that the hamas - led new government would not recognize the israeli , which is a hard - line signal also aggrav@@ ated the international pressure on the palestinian authority .
the united states and israel clearly expressed their ref@@ us@@ al to accept a hamas government that has the real power and threatened to break off economic aid to palestine and to hand over tax to the palestinian side .
however , this does not ham@@ per hamas from making flexible strategic adjustments , and choos@@ ing an independent person is a compromise .
it was reported that in order to obtain international recognition to the maximum , the hamas , both at home and abroad , recently decided to select an independent candidate for the board of directors of the islamic university of z@@ ah@@ ar , j@@ ah@@ ar hus@@ se@@ in , to become the new prime minister .
this move has not been responded by the relevant parties .
palestinian analysts , hus@@ se@@ in , said that no matter how prime minister 's office fl@@ ower , the most crucial thing is that the prime minister should try his best to less@@ en hamas 's hard@@ line color . only by so doing will it be possible to ensure the success of the assembly of the cabinet .
power : how should the power be allocated ?
in the internal context , the most important challenge facing hamas 's assembly is the lack of sufficient experience in governance .
the palestine " y@@ iz@@ hi " carried an analysis saying that hamas , through social welfare projects , has concentrated people to the surprise of the people , but it lacks experience in the administration and has a close relationship with the palestinian national liberation movement ( fat@@ ah ) , which has experience in governance .
hamas proposed a package of agreements with fat@@ ah after the election to establish a political partnership with the fat@@ ah , but fat@@ ah has not yet given any positive support to this .
the fat@@ ah side is now discussing whether to join the cabinet , and the one - faction proposal to participate in the new government , thus making some progress , while the other faction ref@@ uses hamas 's invitation , and is willing to make positive moves in the legisl@@ ature .
sources in the well - informed person@@ age pointed out that under ab@@ b@@ as 's advice , fat@@ ah gradually le@@ an@@ ed toward joining the new government .
even so , the relationship between hamas and fat@@ ah will also be discussed with the government on the allocation of cabinet positions .
in addition , the other way is to establish a framework for the legisl@@ ature to separate the cabinet from the party .
it was reported that hamas also designed a clean expert type government , but it has not yet been decided on the specific list .
in view of the fact that the us and israel are in a dil@@ em@@ ma , the technological expert - type government has not lost its form of organizing a cabinet to reduce external pressure .
according to the provisions of the basic law of palestine , the new legislative council will be nom@@ inated by the prime minister and the cabinet after the new term of the legislative council on 16 may .
armed forces should be the focus of the armed forces ' efforts to fight against terrorism .
hamas 's weapons in hand are the other side of the difficult problem facing the establishment of the new government .
the united states and israel have been very hard - line and firmly demand that hamas give up violence and rej@@ ect its use of arms to participate in politics .
hamas leader ma@@ h@@ mu@@ ar stressed on 9 may that armed resistance is the organizational hy@@ po@@ thes@@ is of the organization 's strategy .
the armed issue actually includes the leg@@ ality of weapons and the management of armed forces at two levels .
hamas , through democratic and free means , has been elected the first major party of the legislative council , with international recognition , enabling its subordinate armed factions to hold the same leg@@ end@@ ary leg@@ end@@ ary gy@@ ang@@ ze is to unify it to the government 's security organs .
hamas once proposed to extend the armed unity of all factions to the palestinian national authority . however , it did not receive a wide response , and it was also opposed by the palestinian islamic ji@@ had ( hamas ) .
palestine now has over 6@@ 0,000 security personnel , and the majority of them are from the fat@@ ah camp .
moreover , fat@@ ah has some organizational relations that are lo@@ ose and dis@@ pers@@ ed , such as the ak@@ as@@ a marty@@ r 's brig@@ ades , the z@@ o@@ h@@ ar haw@@ k , etc.
hamas , which is responsible for the assembly of the cabinet , must hold discussions with ab@@ b@@ as on how to manage the armed forces that they operate independently and ration@@ ally distribu@@ te the right to security management .
according to local media reports , ab@@ b@@ as inten@@ ds to take charge of security and intelligence units , police and civil defense organizations , and other organizations , which are managed by the interior ministry of the new government .
however , all parties are still holding consultations on this sensitive issue , and so far there is no such thing .

we express our greatest sympathy and solic@@ it@@ ude to the victims ' families .
he said : the mon@@ um@@ ental effect of the mon@@ um@@ ental effect is that the chinese people believe that the south african government is conscientiously investigating every case of china .
according to the chinese embassy in south africa , the south african police have successfully cracked a case of the case of chen jian@@ qing , a chinese woman from fujian , on february 5 in south africa , and a suspect has been arrested .
the police are now hun@@ ting down another suspect .
according to the south african embassy in china , the suspect was arrested in january this year for shooting a hong kong business@@ man . the victim 's property was recovered .

bilateral trade volume reached 7@@ 27 million us dollars , up 2@@ 3.@@ 0 percent from the same period last year .

according to statistics from the south african tourism bureau , china 's tourists to south africa in the first half of 2005 were 20@@ 3@@ 31 , a decrease of 14.@@ 9@@ 3 percent compared with the same period last year .
the chinese living in south africa now have 200,000 or so , covering about 200,000 people in the town and township of south africa .
analysts here believe that the widening gap between the rich and the poor in south africa , the high unemployment rate , and the widespread use of fire@@ arms are not threatening death penalty , and therefore the crime rate is high .
because many chinese do not understand english , they have cash in their own hands and at their homes , and they are more ap@@ t to become targets of criminal activities to attack money .

( winter games ) stimul@@ ant news analysis :
xinhua news agency , du@@ ining , february 17@@ th , by press analysis : there is a possibility that the dispatch of a child may not end .
xinhua news agency reporter gao peng , ding peng ,
although italy has repeatedly issued instructions saying that the du@@ tch winter games were investigated during the du@@ tch winter games , and the athletes who used stimul@@ ants may face j@@ ail disaster .
the du@@ tch winter games opened on 16 february .
the next day , the international olympic committee announced that the dispatch of le@@ ov@@ a had been out of the winter olympics . she won the winter season champion@@ ship at this winter olympics . she was the first to be a member of the world 's 15 km personal card .
the international winter season alliance has been making a decision on the same day on the issue of the dispatch of a child to the tour@@ na@@ ment for two years .
the i@@ oc has always stipulated that athletes are being investigated for use in the olympic games , and will be canc@@ elled and dis@@ missed .
however , according to italian law , athletes carrying and using stimul@@ ants are criminal acts . the judiciary is responsible for the arrest of and investigation of the use of stimul@@ ants .
in december last year , the international olympic committee and the italian government , after a year 's he@@ ated barg@@ ain , finally reached an agreement , and both sides agreed to hold a meeting in italy 's legal form during the winter olympics .
with the unremitting efforts of the international olympic committee , italy has made a successful decision four days before the opening of the winter olympics , promising that the police would not go into the olympic village to search for the place of the athletes , but the drug inspection is still being conducted by italian procuratorial organs .
it has been reported that the italian government over@@ saw the du@@ tch winter games officials , p@@ es@@ k@@ ant , who sent the leg@@ end@@ ary act of the le@@ ov@@ ich to the du@@ tch prosecu@@ tor 's office .
however , the international olympic committee and pe@@ ter@@ s@@ bur@@ g himself have not confirmed this .
russia 's winter di@@ aries , 2 nd run@@ ner - up des@@ i@@ res , disclosed at noon on 17 july that the dispatch of le@@ on@@ ov@@ a has left the country and has returned to china .
he once served as a member of the china anti - d@@ oping agency for many years , and said that once the country sent a le@@ af to return to china , this matter will eventually be un@@ settled .
shi k@@ ong@@ cheng said : the i@@ oc and the italian government have held a series of meetings on the issue of anti - d@@ oping agents in winter games . even though the italian procuratorial organs have really interven@@ ed in this matter , it is very hard to say that the results are very hard to say .
according to the previous italian statistics on the use of stimul@@ ants by its own athletes , the number of in@@ mates who were banned was also the highest punishment .
therefore , the senior italian journalist le@@ o er@@ e@@ ili said that the dispatch of le@@ op@@ ov@@ a into the prison was un@@ imag@@ in@@ able , and the most of them were fine .
pi@@ er@@ re also said that although the italian court could hold a def@@ ective trial , italian police did not go to other countries to send the law@@ yer back to serve the sentence .
if the united states sen@@ ds a new name to the united states if it ref@@ uses to accept the verdic@@ t , the italian side will not have any way to do it .
