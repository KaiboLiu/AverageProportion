moreover , as the us president who is currently visiting egypt , mashel emphasized that the palestinian government , which is formed by hamas , will not recognize israel . this is a hard - line signal .
the united states and israel have clearly indicated that they will not accept a single hamas government that has real power , and have threatened to interrupt the economic aid to palestine and transfer taxes to palestine .
however , this does not mean that hamas will take any flexible and pragmatic approach .
according to reports , in order to maximize the international recognition , the state council recently organized a group of hamas leaders at home and abroad who gathered in egypt to select an independent palestinian figure , the president of the board of directors of the gaza islamic university , jayakarta , to become the new prime minister .
this important move has not been approved by the relevant parties .
palestinian analysts said that the united states is still trying to find a way out of the current situation in palestine , whether it is the prime minister or the prime minister .
( subtitle ) the power issue is a major issue that must be addressed in the course of the reform of the cadre management system .
from the internal aspect , hamas formed a cabinet and faced the biggest challenge .
palestinian " life daily " reported that the palestinian leader , who had been trying to seek a settlement through social welfare projects , had assembled people . however , in the aspect of governance , hamas lacked experience and gained a good grasp of the palestinian national liberation movement ( fatah ) , which is in power .
hamas has won the election , and it has proposed to establish a political alliance with fatah .
the fatah internal committee is now discussing whether to enter the cabinet .
the news was that the central authorities have been making efforts to persuade abbas to stop the bloody clashes .
even so , the united states and the united states have also reached a consensus on the issue of the distribution of cabinet positions .
in addition , another man , who was forming a legislative committee framework , also cut off the party 's affiliation .
according to reports , hamas also designed a new palestinian state .
in view of the fact that the united states and israel have different attitudes , the technical specialist government has not lost its form of forming a cabinet to reduce external pressure .
according to the palestinian basic law , the palestinian government will not be allowed to hold a referendum on the issue of the new legislative committee 's inauguration on 16 july .
( subtitle ) the armed forces must follow the same course .
hamas has a large quantity of weapons to form a new government .
the united states and israel have adopted a very tough stance and resolutely demanded that hamas abandon violence and refuse to use arms to take part in government .
hamas leader mashel said on 9 july that armed resistance is the main reason of the organization 's strategic choice .
the armed issue is actually a question of legality of weapons and the status of armed forces .
hamas has won the support of the international community through democracy and freedom .
hamas once proposed that the various factions be unified .
palestinian currently has 60,000 troops , and the number of palestinian security personnel is most from fatah 's camp .
moreover , the fatah government also has some organizations .
the us federal reserve , which is responsible for forming the cabinet , must discuss with abbas how to manage these armed forces that are run by itself , and rationally distribute security management power .
according to local media reports , abbas intends to take charge of security and intelligence units , police and civil defense organs , while the new government 's ministry of interior affairs , will be managed by the latter .
however , all parties have also reached consensus on this sensitive issue .
