china expert : us preaching of military threat against china is groundless
beijing , february 9 ( xinhua ) the chinese government and people are looking forward to the establishment of a new us military alliance , which is formally submitted to congress a few days ago , the pentagon said china is the most likely country to have a military challenge to the united states .
experts believe that this is a wanton criticism of china 's normal national defense building , and it is a great challenge to china 's internal affairs .
the " four - year defense evaluation report " is a new national defense guiding document of the pentagon .
the 92 - page report will be used to describe the issue of china 's military strength and the us 's response to the issue , and the report has been directly mentioned on 15 occasions in china or in china , two in china , and two in terms of reference , namely , the " east turkistan " issue , which is the most important and emerging country in china 's military competition with the united states . if the united states does not have any countermeasure , china may develop in a very dangerous
the chinese academy of military sciences ' research fellow yao yunzhu said that although senior us officials have expressed similar viewpoints on many occasions before , this is the first time that the united states has made a proposal in its defense strategy report on china , which is most likely to pose a military challenge to the united states .
the report clearly defines russia 's role as a springboard for the first time , and makes it particularly necessary to make a decision on the so - called chinese military threat theory .
peng guangqian , researcher of the chinese academy of military sciences , said :
it is worth noting that in the " four - year defense evaluation report , " the united states president bush also submitted a report to congress on fiscal and economic development for 2007 .
if the bag is added to the military action in iraq and afghanistan , the united states will have to pay for the defense budget for fiscal 2007 , which will exceed $ 500 billion , setting a new record , pagen said , adding that this is almost equivalent to the world 's entire military action of all other countries .
peng guangqian believes that the united states is a fabrication of the threat of other countries , and it reflects the consistent style of the pentagon to create an enemy , and its real purpose is to strive for more defense funds to provide a pretext for the us huge arms industry group to earn more profits .
experts say that compared with the huge us military spending , china 's national defense expenditures are quite limited .
he has participated in the writing of the white paper on china 's national defense on many occasions , deng hongzhou said : since the 1990 s , with economic development , china 's national defense spending has increased somewhat , but the proportion of national financial expenditures in the same period has been on the decline .
official statistics show that compared with 1979 , china 's defense spending accounts for over 10 percent of the total national defense expenditures during the same period .
china 's defense expenditures in 2005 were 24.465 - trillion yuan , only about one - third of the united states , and the per capita military spending is equivalent to approximately one - sixty percent of the us military spending , and the per - capita military expenditure of the us military is about one - thirds of the us military 's .
the us territory and china 's territory are roughly similar , and the military expenditure is so huge . what exactly is the military strength of which is in the end exceeds the legitimate defense needs ? this is not enough to say .
peng guangqian said :
the director of the research department of the china arms control and disarmament association , teng jianqun , said that the us side should objectively assess china 's military construction , and china 's peaceful development does not mean that china and the united states will become rivals militarily in the future .
the white paper " china 's national defense for 2004 " says that china will firmly take the road of peaceful development and implement a defensive national defense policy .
china has not been able to do anything in the past and will not pose a threat to any country in the future .
so far , china has not established military bases in any other country , nor has it sent a military force or a pawn to other countries , and the united states has over 100 military bases abroad . in the asia region alone , more than 100,000 people have been deployed .
professor zhu feng of the international relations college of beijing university said : china and the united states should increase communication and exchanges through established channels , and enhance mutual understanding and trust and comprehensively promote the constructive and cooperative relations between china and the united states in the new century so as to jointly promote the maintenance of world peace and development .

hamas to form cabinet to seek a breakthrough
lamanla , february 9 ( xinhua ) hamas has found a new cabinet in the region
xinhua news agency reporter haohuang
the palestinian islamic resistance movement ( hamas ) won the election of the legislative council , how to draw up a blueprint for the new government has become the focus of attention in the international community .
what kind of new policy will hamas pursue directly influence the next step of the relevant parties in the peace process .
at the same time , the resistance attitude of the united states and israel has added a variable to the prospects of the hamas government .
at present , all sides in palestine are stepping up consultations , and discussing the issue of forming a cabinet involves the difficulties and sensitive points of future development .
the post of prime minister has flower down ?
after hamas obtained the right to form a cabinet , people outside the world were worried that hamas prime minister thaksin shinawatra might have a difference with the current top leader abbas .
moreover , hamas , leader of hamas who is visiting egypt , stressed that the palestinian new government formed by hamas would not recognize israel , and this tough signal was also aggravated by the international anxiety .
the united states and israel have clearly stated that they will not accept a hamas government with real power and use this to threaten to suspend economic aid to palestine and transfer tax to palestine .
however , this does not prevent hamas from making flexible strategic adjustments , and it is not possible for an independent person to choose the best option .
it is reported that in order to obtain international recognition , egypt 's hamas , both at home and abroad , recently decided to elect an independent person , chalabi , chairman of the board of directors of the university of chalabi , to become the new prime minister .
this move has not received any response from the relevant authorities .
palestinian analyst hussein said that no matter who is in the post of prime minister , the most important thing is that the candidate for prime minister should try to play down hamas 's hard - line flavor . only thus can it guarantee the success of the cabinet formation .
how to allocate power to the state
from an internal perspective , the biggest challenge facing hamas in forming a cabinet is that it lacks enough experience in governance .
palestinian newspaper " day " analyzed that hamas has been trying to get the people to get together through social welfare projects , but in governing , it lacks experience and is not in keeping with the palestinian national liberation movement , which has been a ruling experience .
hamas proposed a new security framework with fatah after the election to form a national coalition government with the fatah , but fatah has not given a positive response to this .
at present , there is no difference in opinion about whether or not fatah is in the cabinet , and one faction advocates participation in the new government , thus doing something , while the other faction refuses to make a show of the intelligence of hamas , and is willing to be a pro - active opposition party for the legislative yuan .
the source said that under abbas 's advice , fatah gradually leaned toward joining the new government .
even so , hamas and fatah will also discuss the distribution of cabinet positions and make a countercharge .
in addition , the other way is to form a legislative committee framework and remove the cabinet of the party from its jurisdiction .
it was reported that hamas also designed a clean - up government , but the specific list was unclear .
in view of the attitude of the united states and israel , the technological expert - type government is not a form of cabinet - setting to reduce external pressure .
according to the palestinian " basic law , " the new legislative council will be nominated after the new legislative council takes office on 16 march . the work of nominating the prime minister and forming a cabinet will be completed within three to five weeks .
the course of armed forces going to follow ( subhead )
the weapons in hamas are another challenge facing the establishment of a new government .
the attitude of the united states and israel is extremely tough , and it resolutely demands that hamas give up violence and reject the ruling party by taking part in the government .
hamas leader mahashar stressed on 9 july that armed resistance is a strategic option for the organization .
the armed forces issue in fact contains the legality of weapons and the management of the armed forces at the two levels .
hamas 's election of the first major party in the legislature through democracy and freedom has been acknowledged internationally , making it difficult for its subordinates to be armed by the same kind of legitimacy to unify it in the government 's security organs .
hamas once proposed that the armed forces of various factions be unified as a reinforcement of the palestinian national authority , but did not receive extensive responses , and was also met by the palestinian islamic jihad ( jhamas ) .
at present , palestine has over 60,000 security personnel , and most of them come from fatah camp .
moreover , fatah also has some subordinate armed forces with loose organizational relations , such as tamaki 's warrior , pager , and the hawk of fawn .
hamas , who is in charge of forming a cabinet , must have a thorough understanding of how to manage these armed forces that are in charge of their own affairs and to rationally allocate security management power .
according to local media reports , abbas intends to be in charge of security and intelligence units , while the police and civil defense organizations are managed by the new government 's interior ministry .
however , the parties are still holding consultations on this sensitive issue , and so far there is no further document .

police are now looking for another suspect .

the volume of bilateral trade reached $ 727 - billion , an increase of 23.0 percent over the same period last year .

analysts here believe that the gap between the rich and the poor in south africa is widening , the unemployment rate is high , the firearms are spreading , and there is no deterrent to death , so the rate of crime remains high .
since many chinese do not understand english , they have cash in their bodies , and this is more prone to become the target of criminal offenses in seeking money for attacks .
