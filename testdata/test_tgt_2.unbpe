indonesia cancels sale of famous british environment - friendly bag amid fears of chaotic snaring
indonesia has cancelled sale of a famous british environment - friendly bag due to the chaos caused by the snaring wave in hong kong earlier this month , said its dealer today .
" we cancelled the launch of the environment - friendly bag due to what happened in hong kong , " said the director of the famous on pedder store in upscale plaza indonesia .
" it 's not worth it any more if people fight over a 140,000 - rupiah ( about 494 nt dollars ) bag . "
thousands of hong kong people gathered outside the shops on the 6th to snare the limited - edition environment - friendly bag designed by british designer anya hindmarch , which carries " i am not a plastic bag . " however , since the shops refused to open their doors , the situation went out of control .
the designer product that advocates environmental protection was designed to replace plastic bags . it , however , unexpectedly became an overnight fashion indicator in london and new york and sparked snaring , selling on the online auction website , ebay , for many times its retail price .
on pedder , the only authorized dealer in indonesia , said it was unsure whether it would put the bag on sale in a few days .
south korea holds direct talks with taliban amid hostage crisis countdown
afghan taliban has kidnapped 23 south korean hostages and set today 's sunset as the deadline for withdrawal of south korean troops from afghanistan , or they will kill the hostages .
as the clock ticks away , the situation is showing positive development , with south korean officials holding their first talks with the taliban today .
however , the taliban said at the same time that another german hostage abducted was very weak and was in a coma and losing consciousness .
the taliban has called for germany and south korea to pull their troops out of afghanistan and demanded an exchange of these hostages for the 33 guerrillas held prisoner by the afghan government .
" we 've established contact directly with south korean delegates through tribal elders , " said the taliban spokesman ahmadi from an unknown location in a telephone interview with afp .
" we hope this time the talks can yield a result , " said ahmadi .
the taliban has set a deadline at dusk local time ( 10:30pm taiwan time ) , after which they will start killing the south koreans hostages .

military talks between two koreas end in discord amid disagreement on sea disputes
the three - day high - level military talks between south and north korea ended in discord today due to divergence over delimitation of sea border .
" we 've come to a conclusion that we do n't need these fruitless talks any more , " said north korea 's chief delegate lieutenant - general kim yong - chol as the talks at the border city of panmunjom went into the last day 's agenda today .
a red - faced and apparently angry kim yong - chol attacked south korea for intentionally avoiding delimitation of a new maritime border to replace the existing northern limit line .
he said the " northern limit line " was not legal .
the northern limit line in the yellow sea was drawn up by the us forces in 1953 in the wake of the korean war . however , it has become the focus of disputes between the two koreas in recent years . even worse , north korea refuses to recognize it .
north korea says south korean warships have fueled tensions by violating the waters illegally , while south korea rejects the accusation as groundless .
a clash in the water area in june 1999 killed dozens of north korean sailors .
another similar clash was reported in june 2002 , in which six south koreans were unfortunately killed .
us treasury secretary arrives in china for a visit with environment and exchange rate as focus
us treasury secretary paulson arrived in china yesterday for a visit , as the us was trying its best to convince china to further carry out necessary economic reforms and environmental protection efforts , especially the issue of rmb exchange rate that receives wide attention .
us diplomats said paulson was first headed to xining , the capital of the vast northwestern province of qinghai .
china is currently implementing a series of environmental protection initiatives near the largest salt - water lake in qinghai province .
paulson left for beijing today to discuss with chinese officials in charge topics such as promotion of the us - china strategic economic dialogue launched last year .
the us - china strategic economic dialogue mainly covers economic , environmental and other issues , but the one at the forefront is the exchange rate of rmb , which is seen by lawmakers in the united states as significantly undervalued .
there has been growing pressure within the us as the us trade deficit with china soars . us lawmakers plan to take retaliatory actions to fight against what they call unfair trade policies of china .
last week the us senate finance committee overwhelmingly approved a bill requiring the treasury to identify nations with " fundamentally misaligned " currencies , potentially opening the door to economic sanctions against beijing .
us lawmakers say the undervalued rmb makes us - bound goods from china extremely cheap , thereby exacerbating trade imbalance between the us and china , with the us trade deficit with china hitting 232.5 billion us dollars last year .

experts : insurance qdii not draining cash from domestic stock market anytime soon
july 30 chinanews.com
according to a report in the china securities , with the introduction of the interim regulations governing overseas investment of insurance capitals the other day , insurance capitals have broader room to take advantage of the capital market .
liu lefei , chief investment officer of china life co. , ltd , believes that due to the appreciation of rmb and promising domestic capital market , insurance institutions will not invest overseas by buying foreign currencies on a large scale in the short run , which means insurance qdii will not drain cash from the domestic stock market anytime soon .
the report says quite a few insurance institutions hold the same view .
experts say in the absence of a derivatives market for rmb , insurance institutions lack sufficient hedging measures . it is therefore not yet time to buy foreign currencies on a large scale .
liu lefei said that in the long run , in terms of asset allocation , overseas investment should have some weight in the overall allocation of insurance companies .
however , given the fairly large upward pressure of rmb at present , china life will primarily use its own foreign reserves for overseas investment .
as for investing overseas by buying foreign currencies , caution should be taken under the current circumstances .

bian critically alludes to judicial intervention in elections taiwan " judicial yuan " denies and demands his explanation
july 31 chinanews.com - chen shui - bian on the 30th questioned the island 's judicial personnel for intervention into the leadership elections of the taiwan region .
kao chin - chih , " director - general of the department of judicial administration at the judicial yuan " of taiwan said on the same day that the current behaviors of judges on the island were inconsistent with what chen shui - bian said , and he demanded that chen shui - bian explain his comments .
according to a report in taiwan 's united daily , chen shui - bian on the 30th questioned judges , prosecutors and investigators for intervening , influencing or even attempting to manipulate election campaigns of candidates from different parties out of political factors or election considerations and said he hoped the phenomenon did not exist in taiwan , but it might be very difficult .
in response to chen shui - bian 's questioning , president of taiwan " judicial yuan " weng yueh - sheng kept a low key with no responses , while " secretary - general " fan kuang - chun appointed kao chin - chih to speak on behalf of the " judicial yuan . "
kao chin - chih said both the fundamental law of taiwan and " judges code of conduct " state explicitly that judges should stay beyond parties and must not participate in party activities or assist with election campaigns ; all judges have carefully observed relevant restrictions and the " judicial yuan " believes all judges are behaving very well .
kao chin - chih noted by giving an example , when judge jang shenq - shii of kaohsiung " branch high court " attended a program at the ketagalan institute several years ago , he was immediately decided to be punished by the self - regulation panel comprised of judges due to the partisan tint of relevant courses .
jang shenq - shii once wanted to run in the primary for the progressive party but eventually decided to quit , again amid controversy over his participation while in office .
kao chin - chih believes if it is the trial of an individual case , there is recourse to the appeal process . one should not infer the judge has ulterior political motives solely based on the result of the ruling .

reports of organizations such as the confederation of german employers ' associations and the german engineers association show that there is a fairly large shortage of engineers and professional technicians in the current german labor market .
according to statistics of the german federal labor agency , in may this year , the shortage of supply was 12,700 for engineers and 9,600 for technicians in the german labor market .
germany has set relatively high threshold of attracting foreign talents in order to protect employment of its citizens .
under germany 's immigration law , professional talents from non - eu countries cannot get work and resident permits unless their annual income in germany is no lower than 85,500 euros .
schavan suggests lowering the threshold to 40,000 to 60,000 euros .
do n't worship legal " theorists " blindly
it is stipulated in article 8 of the draft amendment to the attorneys law recently submitted to the standing committee of the national people 's congress for review that those who apply for practicing as an attorney and have senior professional designations or equivalent professional levels from previous professional work such as legal research and teaching , can be permitted to practice as a lawyer upon approval of the justice department of the state council .
( june 28 , china youth daily )
there are " theorists " and " practitioners " in law , where the former primarily involve " abstract behaviors " such as legal teaching and research , while the latter are more of " concrete behaviors " such as litigations , legal counseling and legal services .
for a long time , there has been mutual contempt between legal " theorists " and " practitioners . " " theorists " think " practitioners " are merely mechanical " legal dogmatists " lacking necessary attainments in the science of law , while criticisms of " practitioners " about " theorists " are directed at the " inability of theories to guide practice . "
given such gap in the division of labor , what law can do is to remain neutral rather than strongly support either of the two .
however , the " chartered attorney system " in the attorneys law recognizes the opinion factually that legal " theorists " are superior to legal " practitioners . "
in reality , for some experts and scholars who study and teach pure legal theories such as the legal history and international law , no matter how profound and sophisticated their theories are , they are incompatible with legal practice .
thus , the " chartered attorney system " has undoubtedly created a " bad opening " to confusions in legal " practitioner " qualifications , which has extremely adverse influence .
blind worship of " theorists " does not stop here . phenomena where reports of expert opinions and expert argumentation seminars often affect and even override court verdicts are also direct reflections of such blind worship .

do n't let peddlers disturb public places
traveling away from home , the aim is to be relaxed , refreshed and comfortable and to enjoy natural scenery and the achievements of social civilization to the maximum extent .
however , when traveling domestically , many people have experienced such annoyance , which is being blocked in public places by peddlers and those doing agent businesses .
no matter in a bus or a train , they are always persistently harassed by peddlers and illegal agents whenever getting on or off the vehicle .
if they are not selling eggs , peanuts or pies , then they are selling newspapers or magazines . others are a large number of illegal agents who recommend restaurants or accommodations , or even peddle fake invoices .
if you do n't accept , they may follow you several hundred meters , quite an air of i would rather die if i do n't succeed .
at some scenic spots , many tourists feel the same way .
before you even enter the gate , there will be someone peddling things like tourist souvenirs and small crafts .
once you enter , there will be even more such things . even the best mood will be dispelled .
a media agency once reported that while many foreign tourists to xi'an were amazed by the famous and historic sites in xi'an , they felt perplexed by piles of vendors and peddlers selling goods everywhere .
public places like bus stops and scenic spots are supposed to be places for traveling and relaxing , where courtesy , order , quietness and harmony should prevail , so as to give tourists a comfortable and easy environment .
free entry and exit of peddlers not only disturb tourists ' moods , but also virtually destruct the public order at these public places , thus creating visual pollution and environmental pollution . in addition , it also provides conditions and opportunities for lawbreakers to stir up troubles .
what 's important is that these public places are the window showcasing local cultural and ideological progress . seeing a spot reveals the whole picture . what is damaged is not only a question of image , but it will also affect local economic development .
just imagine , you want to make your tourism industry big and strong , but use such messy tourist environment to greet guests from around the world . who will want to come , and who will dare to come ?
then , how does your tourism economy yield any benefits ?
with the high season coming for tourism , it should be a priority to create a civilized tourism environment for tourists from all over the world .
public places are not markets . business activities of vendors and peddlers should be regulated . those who operate without a license should be firmly removed , and illegal activities should be firmly suppressed .
only a civilized and orderly environment will make tourists come , go and return gladly .
in a nutshell , do n't let peddlers disturb public places .
" incentive on opting out of minimum living standard scheme " cannot stand up to scrutiny
by giving away things like refrigerators , the jianguomen subdistrict of beijing 's dongcheng district has awarded 12 households enjoying the minimum living allowance for opting out of the minimum living standard scheme .
( the beijing news - july 10 )
the author is happy for these households for the improvement in their living , but has mixed feelings towards the term " opting out of the minimum living standard scheme " and the practice of " awarding . "
" regarding problems such as cheating on the minimum living allowance , encouraging people to opt out of the minimum living standard scheme is to set examples for other households enjoying the minimum living allowances , " deputy director at the jianguomen subdistrict office said .
such examples are indeed worth promoting if they are to encourage other people enjoying the minimum living allowance to get out of difficulties through their own efforts ; they are , however , a bit naive if the purpose is to " move " those who have cheated on the minimum living allowance for long .
in distinguishing between and cleaning up real and fake households entitled to the minimum living allowance , what should be relied on more is the law .
competent authorities should highlight the obligations of households entitled to the minimum living allowance while they enjoy the minimum living standard allowance : for example , informing of changes in family members and income in a timely manner , reporting the employment situation , undergoing regular reviews etc. and competent authorities should intensify supervision and inspection .
after all , " withdrawal from the minimum living standard scheme pursuant to law " is the permanent solution .
who will pay for the in - kind rewards given by the subdistrict to the households who opt out of the minimum living standard scheme ?
as a level of governmental organizations , the spending of a subdistrict is covered by fiscal allocation .
yet should this money of the taxpayers be spent ?
on the one hand , by opting out of the minimum living standard scheme , the households prove to have certain capacity to " sustain themselves ; " on the other hand , are n't there still people claiming the minimum living standard allowance ?
the government 's fiscal allocation that is dubbed life - saving money should provide timely assistance rather than add icing to a cake .
remark that liu gangyi is willing to be a servant is more credible
on july 10 , liu gangyi , party committee secretary of mulan township in xindu district , chengdu , who is the country 's first publicly nominated and directly elected township party committee secretary , had his fourth democratic assessment after taking office and achieved a satisfaction rate of 97 % .
in the reporter 's conversation with liu gangyi , liu gangyi positioned himself as a " servant . "
( the beijing news - a day ago )
the " servant " uttered by liu gangyi may be more real and convincing than the " servant " uttered by those appointed officials .
the biggest advantage of public nomination and direct election , compared with the mechanism of appointment , is that with the former , the source of authority is primarily decided by average party members and commoners , while the latter are appointed by a higher organizational level . and the direction of the source of authority determines the former must place their responsibility for the public at the top .
the source of authority and who to report to are the fundamental factors that decide how the elected go about their work .
some people question such " democratic assessment , " saying it is more like a " show of democracy . "
my view is that it is better to have this form of " democratic assessment " than nothing .
considering the history and current situation of the grassroot democracy progress in china , i believe public nomination and direct election are already a major breakthrough . as an important part of this innovation , democratic assessment should not be underestimated in advancing the grassroot democracy progress .
india poised to elect first female president . analyst say there is a good chance of being elected ; female voters hope she can boost the standing for women .
on june 23 , patil put her palms together before filling out the documents for presidential candidates .
indian presidential election began on the 19th , with the new president to be chosen from the incumbent vice - president shekhawat and rajasthan governor pratibha patil who recently resigned .
patil is the first female presidential candidate in india 's history , who could become india 's first ever female president if elected .
patil is the nominee of the ruling national congress party , while shekhawat is from the opposition bharatiya janata party .
since the national congress party dominates the electoral college for the president , both the media and the general public guess patil has a higher possibility of being elected .
patil , 72 , was the female governor of the state of rajasthan .
originally a lawyer , she made her way into the congress in 1985 . experienced in politics , she received good reviews from the government while serving as rajasthan governor .
also committed to social welfare , she is the honorary chairperson of many cultural , educational and social welfare organizations .
analysts say patil was selected as a candidate for her unswerving loyalty to sonia gandhi , chairperson of the india national congress party .
in india , the gandhi family has controlled the ruling national congress party for a long time .
patil is supported by a great number of female voters , who believe that patil would rebuild their image and boost their standing in india , where the concept of discrimination against women is serious .
under the constitution , india is a federal country , where the president is the nominal chief of state and commander of the armed forces , more of a symbol than representing any parties or organizations .

climate change leads to rapid shrink of alpine glaciers
geneva , july 29 , by the newspaper ( reporter liu jun )
glaciologists at the swiss academy of sciences found through long - term follow - up studies that the over 1,800 glaciers in switzerland were shrinking at an average rate of 3 percent a year between 1850 and 2005 .
the 2003 heatwave alone caused 1.8 percent of alpine glaciers to melt .
experts believe if global temperature rises by 3 degrees by 2100 , the glaciers will shrink by 80 percent as compared with today ; a rise of 5 degrees , the glaciers will totally disappear .
the aletsch glacier , the longest glacier in europe , is listed in the unesco world heritage sites . but it lost 100m in the year between 2005 and 2006 alone . protecting natural environment has developed to such an extent that allows no delay .

russian security service charges exiled oligarch with " coup plot "
borovkov , lawyer of the russian oligarch berezovsky exiled in london , said on july 2 that the russian fsb has formally filed a new charge against his client , accusing berezovsky of " conspiring to plot a coup against the state and attempting to seize russian political power by violence . "
in an interview with a reporter of britain 's the guardian in april this year , berezovsky declared he was preparing to mount a " palace coup " in russia , confirming he was providing financial assistance to representatives of the right - wing elites who were against the government policy , borovkov noted .
the russian fsb 's investigation bureau immediately began criminal investigation in berezovsky in compliance with article 278 , violent seizure of power , of the criminal code of the russian federation and formally filed applicable charges to the savelovsky court in moscow in recent days .
it is learned that in february 2006 , the office of the russian persecutor general had filed criminal charges against berezovsky , on the same ground that the exiled oligarch confirmed his attempt to obtain russian political power by force .
as berezovsky had been in exile abroad and could not be extradited , russia halted probing of the case temporarily in january 2007 .
the savelovsky court initiated another criminal case against the exiled oligarch , in which the office of the russian persecutor general accused berezovsky of embezzling funds of 214 million rubles from a russian airway and laundering 16 million rubles . after hearings , the court has decided to postpone court probing until july 12 and will appoint a state defense attorney for the defendant during this time .
berezovsky thought all these were " a farce " and clearly forbade his defense attorneys to participate in court trials .

reports of diabetes drug avandia causing adverse reactions increase significantly
according to a us media report on the 15th , there has recently been a tendency of significant increase in the number of adverse reaction reports , such as cardiac diseases , caused by the anti - diabetes drug avandia in the united states .
the us food and drug administration issued a safety warning in may this year , advising diabetes patients to take avandia with caution , because scientists issued a study report in an edition of the new england journal of medicine published on may 21 , saying the best - selling drug would significantly increase the rates of heart attack and death in patients .
the safety of avandia has thus been closely watched by doctors and patients .
according to statistics , within roughly a month after the safety warning , the us fda received 357 reports of adverse reactions caused by avandia , 38 of which are death reports .
yet the fda only received 50 and 73 reports of adverse reactions respectively in january and february this year .

however , drug experts at the us fda believe it is yet too early to conclude that avandia is unsafe .
the fda is going to hold a hearing regarding the safety of avandia on july 30 .
avandia , introduced in 1999 , is an insulin sensitizer for treating type ii diabetes .
some six million diabetes patients around the world has taken or is taking avandia .
the manufacturer of avandia , the uk company glaxosmithkline , has believed avandia is safe and is " more beneficial than harmful " to patients .

us pentagon rethinks plan to cut us troops in europe
a us defense department official said on the 23rd that the us pentagon is reconsidering a 2002 plan to cut us troops stationed in europe by about half because of the war in iraq and changes in the world situation .
with the ongoing iraq war and worsened us relations with russia and iran , the pentagon leadership has questioned the feasibility of the plan to slash troops stationed in europe , the us media said , quoting a defense department official .
in 2002 , the then defense secretary rumsfeld announced the us would reduce troops in europe from 113,000 to 71,000 by 2012 , in order to create a " lean and effective " new force .
total us troops stationed in europe have decreased to 100,000 so far .
however , craddock , commander of the us european command , submitted a report to current defense secretary gates in june this year , in which he questioned the aforesaid reduction plan .
the report says the slash of us troops stationed in europe is accompanied by rotational transfer of many forces to iraq and afghanistan for battles , which leads to a shortage of us military personnel stationed in europe , such that they are unable to conduct regular cooperation with european allies .
the report recommends halting the plan to cut us troops in europe .
experts in the us believe the phenomenon above indicates that the iraq war has been such a long drag that it has disrupted the original adjustment plan of the us military .

three major functions of modern military uniforms
first is the identifying function ,
an important symbol to distinguish among armies of different nations , among different armed services , and between troops and civilians .
although the purposes of military uniforms are basically the same in the armed forces of some 100 nations big or small around the world , no armed forces of any two nations have identical military uniforms .
second is the symbolizing function .
to some extent , military uniforms not only reflect a country 's vitality and national characteristics , but also centrally showcases the combating capabilities and servicemen qualities of a country 's armed forces .
of the three major categories of military uniforms , dress uniforms , service uniforms and combat & training uniforms , nothing is more able to fully demonstrate the might of a country and its military than the neat and elegant dress uniforms .
third is the protective function .
with the rapid development of new and high - tech weapons , it has become a paramount issue in the development of military uniforms to improve the comprehensive protective performance of new combat & training uniforms , so that military uniforms have various functions , such as protecting from bullets , reconnaissance , chemistry , bacteria and radiation , as well as conditioning the temperature , humidity and air .

the party committee office of a battalion dare to get serious in handling thorny problems
chengdu , july 3 , by the newspaper
by qu yimao and yang ruiyu : " the fact that we can live in an apartment is attributed to the determination and resolution of the battalion 's party committee office to vacate houses . "
today , more than ten cadres of a communications training battalion at the chengdu military region who moved into apartments were all lit up with pleasure , as they were filled with admiration and gratitude for the working style of the " team " at the battalion 's party committee that dare to get serious and meet challenges when tackling thorny problems .
a few years earlier , with staff changing and being replaced , some homes in the battalion 's family dormitory building were over - occupied in violation of rules , which brought housing difficulties to cadres on active service . both officers and soldiers are quite unhappy over it .
the battalion had tried to vacate the homes several times , but left it unsettled because of various resistance , making this problem a hard nut to crack .
" so long as we dare to get serious and are reasonable , there are no difficult problems that we ca n't solve . "
once the new party committee reached the consensus , principal leaders went out personally to begin a thorough cleanup regarding the problem of irregular housing occupation .
they touched people sentimentally and enlightened them sensibly on the one hand , hoping that those involved could put the overall situation into perspective ; on the other hand , they clarified applicable policies and rules of the troops about apartments , pool funded housing and economically affordable housing , expressing the resolute determination and fundamental stance of the party committee .
for those people who had housing elsewhere , but were reluctant to return the over - occupied housing , the party committee office made timely contact with their units and took necessary measures to urge them give cooperation to the troops ' work on voluntary basis .
after two months of attentive efforts , all tenants in the barrack complex who over - occupied housing in violation of rules moved out on schedule , and the battalion 's cadres on active service were all allocated housing in compliance with policies .
the working style of the battalion 's party committee that dare to get serious and meet challenges also had chain effects , in that several cadres who were previously reluctant to give active cooperation in the organization 's allocation have now said they would follow the organization 's decisions .

jingjiang department of people 's armed force creates platform to boost quality of armed force cadres
by cao jiawei and zhu chunbin , pla daily : on june 18 , at an intensive training program for armed force cadres in the city of jingjiang , jiangsu province , the lecture win the psychological warfare in the context of informationization by lu yuqing , director of the xilai town department of people 's armed force , received positive comments amongst all participants .
this was a fresh change as a result of the city 's department of people 's armed force loading burdens onto armed force cadres and working to boost the overall quality of armed force cadres in line with the reality of different posts .
at the beginning of this year , when doing grassroot research , the party committee of the department of people 's armed force found that some armed force cadres did not focus on doing work related to the armed forces due to long years of service and multiple duties .
therefore , they have conducted training regularly for armed force cadres using such methods such as intensive training , meeting as a way of training , relying on local party school to provide training , with a view to address problems such as narrow knowledge spectrum and lack of versatile work skills .
in line with the core responsibilities , it has assigned tasks and loaded burdens onto armed force cadres boldly to improve their competency through on - the - job practice .
in addition , by actively coordinating with local organization departments , they jointly formulated the scheme of position competitions amongst armed force cadres , which explicitly requires head of an armed force department to be on the party committee of the same level without concurrently assuming other jobs ;
and set up an adjustment and exchange mechanism for armed force cadres , whereby some armed force cadres who are older or not suitable for grassroot armed force positions are adjusted or exchanged in a timely fashion , while comrades with good overall quality and high competency are promoted .
recently , chen yisong , a clerk of the armed force department at the new century shipbuilding co. , ltd. , who led a militia technical unit to fill a void of the nation with their innovatively developed underwater ship welding technique , was promoted to the company 's head of armed force department as an exception to the rule .
a good start calls for a good ending
solely from the result of the game , a score of 2-2 is reasonable and also acceptable to the chinese team . what 's essential is the process of the game , which is somewhat disappointing .
if it was the iranian team who led 2-0 before the chinese team equalized the score , this would definitely give chinese soccer fans different feelings and significantly boost morale . unfortunately , things were just the opposite .
a good start without a good ending could be said a chronic problem of the chinese team .
the chinese team often does not know how to play soccer under favorable circumstances . the conventional view is that chinese players have less than satisfactory psychological quality .
this is indeed a reason why the chinese team could not have a " good ending . "
however , seen from today 's game of the chinese team , it seems this is not completely true .
people like li weifeng are experienced veteran players , let alone people like sun jihai , sun xiang , shao jiayi and zheng zhi who have played soccer in europe . they have broad experience and knowledge , and should not have problematic psychological quality logically speaking .
the chinese team was unfortunately forced into a draw by the iranian team this time , most probably because of improper deployment of players .
the iranian team substituted with two people while trailing behind and the situation improved instantly .
the chinese team also substituted with three players , but the result was not good .
to overcome the problem of having a good start without a good ending , the source of the problem must be spotted .
as long as the problem is spotted , it may not be difficult to find a solution to redress the problem .
what we fear is to see a doctor indiscriminately in case of an emergency disease .
if things go on like that , the chronic problem will persist no matter how many games the chinese team plays , not to mention a step forward in each game that people expect .

" sdrd " education collaboration areas launched in saf base
by xue bingjian and reporter xu yeqing , pla daily : the phenomenon where education at small , dispersed , remote and direct ( sdrd ) units is hard to organize , lacking in resources and individually carried out will be history in a base of the second artillery force .
the reporters learned recently that after a six - month pilot project , the base handed down steps to implement " ideological and political education outline " and several ideological and political education collaboration areas that cover all its sdrd units have officially begun operation .
to promote effective implementation of the ideological and political education outline , the base organized efforts to perform in - depth investigation and research into the status of ideological and political education at sdrd units early this year and sorted out key problems that affected and constrained the time , people and effects of the education , creating the new education pattern of collaboration areas for sdrd units .
the specific practice of the collaboration areas is to break the bound of units and in an area where the sdrd units are relatively concentrated , designate a brigade or regiment level unit as the coordinator , which will conduct centralized planning of theme education . units of different relationships of subordination and affiliation attend lectures together at a close location or hold remote discussions with video systems .
education capabilities are centrally allocated by way of rotational lectures in conjunction with position competitions ; education hardware within a area is used in a coordinated manner , information and data , as well as experience in education of each unit are shared and exchanged , report tours about typical examples in an area are organized regularly , and officers and soldiers discuss what they have learned from study .
each collaboration area has put in place a full - time education contact and a part - time education information collector .
building on this , the collaboration areas also established systems of seeking help with hard problems , joint consultations on major educational topics , emergency briefing of ideological situations , and that of assessment and evaluation .
zhang shengmin , director of the base 's political department , told the reporters that establishing the political education collaboration areas has not only minimized waste of educational resources , but also deepened the effects of education .
some political instructors voluntarily learn new knowledge and seek new methods of education for fear of losing marks in front of officers and soldiers from other units .
officers and soldiers receiving education also digest what is taught , for fear of saying anything unprofessional in front of officers and soldiers from friendly and neighboring units during discussion and analysis .
as such , passions of the educators and the educated are both effectively inspired .

the next match against the colombian team may well be the last performance of the us team and keller in this year 's copa america .
