military talks between two kore@@ as end in dis@@ cor@@ d amid dis@@ agreement on sea disputes
the three - day high - level military talks between south and north korea ended in dis@@ cor@@ d today due to diver@@ g@@ ence over del@@ im@@ itation of sea border .

the northern limit line in the yellow sea was drawn up by the us forces in 19@@ 53 in the wake of the korean war . however , it has become the focus of disputes between the two kore@@ as in recent years . even worse , north korea refuses to recognize it .
north korea says south korean warships have fu@@ eled ten@@ sions by violating the waters illegally , while south korea rejec@@ ts the accus@@ ation as ground@@ less .

us treasury secretary arri@@ ves in china for a visit with environment and exchange rate as focus
us treasury secretary pa@@ ul@@ son arrived in china yesterday for a visit , as the us was trying its best to conv@@ ince china to further carry out necessary economic reforms and environmental protection efforts , especially the issue of rmb exchange rate that recei@@ ves wide attention .
us diplom@@ ats said pa@@ ul@@ son was first headed to xin@@ ing , the capital of the vast north@@ western province of qinghai .
china is currently implementing a series of environmental protection initiatives near the largest sal@@ t - water la@@ ke in qinghai province .
pa@@ ul@@ son left for beijing today to discuss with chinese officials in charge topics such as promotion of the us - china strategic economic dialogue launched last year .
the us - china strategic economic dialogue mainly covers economic , environmental and other issues , but the one at the forefront is the exchange rate of rmb , which is seen by law@@ makers in the united states as significantly under@@ valued .
there has been growing pressure within the us as the us trade deficit with china so@@ ars . us law@@ makers plan to take re@@ tali@@ atory actions to fight against what they call unfair trade policies of china .
last week the us senate finance committee overwhel@@ ming@@ ly approved a bill requiring the treasury to identify nations with " fundamentally mis@@ al@@ ig@@ ned " currencies , poten@@ tially opening the door to economic sanctions against beijing .
us law@@ makers say the under@@ valued rmb makes us - bound goods from china extremely che@@ ap , thereby exac@@ er@@ b@@ ating trade im@@ balance between the us and china , with the us trade deficit with china h@@ itting 23@@ 2.5 billion us dollars last year .

july 30 chin@@ an@@ e@@ w@@ s@@ .@@ com
according to a report in the china securities , with the introduction of the interim regulations governing overseas investment of insurance cap@@ itals the other day , insurance cap@@ itals have broader room to take advantage of the capital market .
liu le@@ fei , chief investment officer of china life co@@ . , ltd , believes that due to the appreciation of rmb and promis@@ ing domestic capital market , insurance institutions will not invest overseas by buying foreign currencies on a large scale in the short run , which means insurance q@@ di@@ i will not dra@@ in cash from the domestic stock market any@@ time soon .
the report says quite a few insurance institutions hold the same view .
experts say in the abs@@ ence of a der@@ i@@ v@@ atives market for rmb , insurance institutions lack sufficient he@@ dging measures . it is therefore not yet time to buy foreign currencies on a large scale .
liu le@@ fei said that in the long run , in terms of asset allocation , overseas investment should have some weight in the overall allocation of insurance companies .
however , given the fairly large up@@ ward pressure of rmb at present , china life will primarily use its own foreign reserves for overseas investment .
as for investing overseas by buying foreign currencies , cau@@ tion should be taken under the current circumstances .

germany plans to lower thre@@ sh@@ old of attracting professional talents
ber@@ lin , july 1 , by the news paper ( reporter wang huaicheng )
german minister of education and research sch@@ av@@ an said the other day that germany should lower the conditions in its immigration law regarding the attrac@@ tion of foreign professional talents , so as to address the shortage of professional talents that germany faces by attracting more foreign talents .
according to an o@@ ec@@ d report , work@@ force aged between 15 and 64 will decreases every year in germany by 2010 .
if there are not enough immigrants , then by 20@@ 20 , german work@@ force will have been 6 % less than the current level .
reports of organizations such as the con@@ federation of german employers ' associations and the german engine@@ ers association show that there is a fairly large shortage of engine@@ ers and professional technicians in the current german labor market .
according to statistics of the german federal labor agency , in may this year , the shortage of supply was 1@@ 2,@@ 700 for engine@@ ers and 9@@ ,@@ 600 for technicians in the german labor market .
germany has set relatively high thre@@ sh@@ old of attracting foreign talents in order to protect employment of its citizens .
under germany 's immigration law , professional talents from non - eu countries cannot get work and resident permits unless their annual income in germany is no lower than 8@@ 5,@@ 500 euro@@ s .

do n't wor@@ ship legal " the@@ or@@ ists " blin@@ dly
it is stipulated in article 8 of the draft amendment to the att@@ or@@ ne@@ ys law recently submitted to the standing committee of the national people 's congress for review that those who apply for practicing as an att@@ or@@ ney and have senior professional desig@@ nations or equivalent professional levels from previous professional work such as legal research and teaching , can be permitted to practice as a law@@ yer upon approval of the justice department of the state council .
( june 28 , china youth daily )
there are " the@@ or@@ ists " and " practitioners " in law , where the former primarily involve " ab@@ str@@ act behaviors " such as legal teaching and research , while the latter are more of " concrete behaviors " such as liti@@ g@@ ations , legal coun@@ sel@@ ing and legal services .
for a long time , there has been mutual cont@@ emp@@ t between legal " the@@ or@@ ists " and " practitioners . " " the@@ or@@ ists " think " practitioners " are merely mechanical " legal dog@@ m@@ ati@@ sts " l@@ acking necessary at@@ tain@@ ments in the science of law , while critic@@ isms of " practitioners " about " the@@ or@@ ists " are directed at the " in@@ ability of theories to guide practice . "
given such gap in the division of labor , what law can do is to remain neutr@@ al rather than strongly support either of the two .
however , the " char@@ tered att@@ or@@ ney system " in the att@@ or@@ ne@@ ys law recogn@@ izes the opinion fac@@ tually that legal " the@@ or@@ ists " are superior to legal " practitioners . "
in reality , for some experts and scholars who study and te@@ ach p@@ ure legal theories such as the legal history and international law , no matter how profound and sophistic@@ ated their theories are , they are in@@ compatible with legal practice .
thus , the " char@@ tered att@@ or@@ ney system " has undoubtedly created a " bad opening " to confu@@ sions in legal " practition@@ er " qualifications , which has extremely adverse influence .
blind wor@@ ship of " the@@ or@@ ists " does not stop here . phenomena where reports of expert opinions and expert argu@@ mentation seminars often affect and even over@@ ri@@ de court verdic@@ ts are also direct reflec@@ tions of such blind wor@@ ship .

by feng lei , guang@@ ming daily

to further promote sound development of our nation 's maritime industry and expand the national fleet , in response to relevant problems arising from the significant number of our vessels engaged in international vo@@ y@@ ages that register overseas and operate under foreign flags , the ministry of communications recently issued an announcement on implementing ad ho@@ c tax - free registration policy for chinese - funded vessels engaged in international shipping , which speci@@ fies the conditions and application procedures of enjoying the ad ho@@ c tax - free registration policy . eligible vessels are exemp@@ t from customs duty and import v@@ at if they submit import declar@@ ations within two years beginning july 1 this year .
applying vessels may choose shanghai , tianjin or dalian as the port of registry to go through the vessel registration procedures .
britain low@@ ers terrorism threat alert level
london , july 5 by the newspaper ( reporter guo lin )
the british government on the 4@@ th lowered its terrorism threat alert level from the highest level to " severe , " meaning terrorism attacks are not " im@@ min@@ ent " although " highly likely " in britain .
currently , british police has swit@@ ched its scope of investigation to india and australia .
since all eight suspects of the terrorism attacks arrested work in the health care system , the government will conduct an emergency scru@@ tin@@ y into the background of immigrants working in the health care system .
it is learned that nearly 9@@ 0,000 people working in britain 's public health care system acquired their practition@@ er qualifications overseas .
prime minister b@@ rown also requests background check of highly s@@ killed migr@@ ation applicants , where employers and relevant organizations will be required to submit background information about the applicants .
do n't let pe@@ d@@ d@@ lers distur@@ b public places
travel@@ ing away from home , the aim is to be relaxed , ref@@ re@@ shed and comfor@@ table and to enjoy natural scen@@ ery and the achievements of social civilization to the maximum extent .
however , when travel@@ ing dom@@ es@@ tically , many people have experienced such an@@ no@@ y@@ ance , which is being bloc@@ ked in public places by pe@@ d@@ d@@ lers and those doing agent businesses .
no matter in a bus or a train , they are always persistently har@@ ass@@ ed by pe@@ d@@ d@@ lers and illegal agents whenever getting on or off the vehicle .
if they are not selling eg@@ gs , pe@@ an@@ u@@ ts or p@@ ies , then they are selling newspapers or magaz@@ ines . others are a large number of illegal agents who recomm@@ end restaurants or accommod@@ ations , or even pe@@ d@@ dle fake inv@@ o@@ ices .
if you do n't accept , they may follow you several hundred meters , quite an air of i would rather die if i do n't succeed .
at some scen@@ ic spots , many tourists feel the same way .
before you even enter the gate , there will be someone pe@@ d@@ d@@ ling things like tourist souven@@ irs and small cr@@ af@@ ts .
once you enter , there will be even more such things . even the best mo@@ od will be dis@@ p@@ elled .
a media agency once reported that while many foreign tourists to xi@@ '@@ an were a@@ ma@@ zed by the famous and historic sites in xi@@ '@@ an , they felt per@@ ple@@ xed by pil@@ es of v@@ end@@ ors and pe@@ d@@ d@@ lers selling goods everywhere .
public places like bus stops and scen@@ ic spots are sup@@ posed to be places for travel@@ ing and rela@@ xing , where cour@@ t@@ es@@ y , order , qui@@ et@@ ness and harmony should prev@@ ail , so as to give tourists a comfor@@ table and easy environment .
free entry and exit of pe@@ d@@ d@@ lers not only distur@@ b tourists ' mo@@ ods , but also vir@@ tually destruc@@ t the public order at these public places , thus creating visual pollution and environmental pollution . in addition , it also provides conditions and opportunities for law@@ break@@ ers to sti@@ r up troubles .
what 's important is that these public places are the win@@ dow show@@ c@@ asing local cultural and ideological progress . seeing a spot reve@@ als the whole picture . what is damaged is not only a question of image , but it will also affect local economic development .
just imag@@ ine , you want to make your tourism industry big and strong , but use such mess@@ y tourist environment to gre@@ et guests from around the world . who will want to come , and who will dare to come ?
then , how does your tourism economy yield any benefits ?
with the high season coming for tourism , it should be a priority to create a civilized tourism environment for tourists from all over the world .
public places are not markets . business activities of v@@ end@@ ors and pe@@ d@@ d@@ lers should be regul@@ ated . those who operate without a license should be firmly removed , and illegal activities should be firmly sup@@ pressed .
only a civilized and orderly environment will make tourists come , go and return gl@@ ad@@ ly .
in a n@@ ut@@ shel@@ l , do n't let pe@@ d@@ d@@ lers distur@@ b public places .
" incen@@ tive on op@@ ting out of minimum living standard scheme " cannot stand up to scru@@ tin@@ y
by giving away things like re@@ fri@@ ger@@ ators , the ji@@ angu@@ om@@ en sub@@ district of beijing 's dong@@ cheng district has awarded 12 households enjoying the minimum living allowance for op@@ ting out of the minimum living standard scheme .
( the beijing news - july 10 )
the auth@@ or is happy for these households for the improvement in their living , but has mixed feelings towards the term " op@@ ting out of the minimum living standard scheme " and the practice of " a@@ war@@ ding . "
" regarding problems such as che@@ ating on the minimum living allowance , encouraging people to op@@ t out of the minimum living standard scheme is to set examples for other households enjoying the minimum living allowances , " deputy director at the ji@@ angu@@ om@@ en sub@@ district office said .
such examples are indeed worth promoting if they are to encourage other people enjoying the minimum living allowance to get out of difficulties through their own efforts ; they are , however , a bit n@@ ai@@ ve if the purpose is to " move " those who have che@@ ated on the minimum living allowance for long .
in distingu@@ ishing between and clean@@ ing up real and fake households entitled to the minimum living allowance , what should be reli@@ ed on more is the law .
competent authorities should highlight the obligations of households entitled to the minimum living allowance while they enjoy the minimum living standard allowance : for example , in@@ forming of changes in family members and income in a timely manner , reporting the employment situation , undergoing regular re@@ views etc. and competent authorities should intensify supervision and inspection .
after all , " withdrawal from the minimum living standard scheme pursu@@ ant to law " is the permanent solution .
who will pay for the in - kind re@@ wards given by the sub@@ district to the households who op@@ t out of the minimum living standard scheme ?
as a level of governmental organizations , the spending of a sub@@ district is covered by fiscal allocation .
yet should this money of the tax@@ payers be spent ?
on the one hand , by op@@ ting out of the minimum living standard scheme , the households prove to have certain capacity to " sust@@ ain themselves ; " on the other hand , are n't there still people claiming the minimum living standard allowance ?
the government 's fiscal allocation that is du@@ b@@ bed life - saving money should provide timely assistance rather than add ic@@ ing to a ca@@ ke .
remark that liu gang@@ yi is willing to be a serv@@ ant is more cre@@ di@@ ble
on july 10 , liu gang@@ yi , party committee secretary of mul@@ an township in xin@@ du district , chengdu , who is the country 's first publicly nomin@@ ated and directly elected township party committee secretary , had his fourth democratic assessment after taking office and achieved a satisfaction rate of 97 % .
in the reporter 's conversation with liu gang@@ yi , liu gang@@ yi posi@@ tioned himself as a " serv@@ ant . "
( the beijing news - a day ago )
the " serv@@ ant " ut@@ tered by liu gang@@ yi may be more real and convinc@@ ing than the " serv@@ ant " ut@@ tered by those appointed officials .
the biggest advantage of public nomination and direct election , compared with the mechanism of appointment , is that with the former , the source of authority is primarily decided by average party members and comm@@ on@@ ers , while the latter are appointed by a higher organizational level . and the direction of the source of authority determin@@ es the former must place their responsibility for the public at the top .
the source of authority and who to report to are the fundamental factors that decide how the elected go about their work .
some people question such " democratic assessment , " saying it is more like a " show of democracy . "
my view is that it is better to have this form of " democratic assessment " than nothing .
considering the history and current situation of the grass@@ root democracy progress in china , i believe public nomination and direct election are already a major breakthrough . as an important part of this innovation , democratic assessment should not be unde@@ res@@ tim@@ ated in advancing the grass@@ root democracy progress .
india po@@ ised to elec@@ t first female president . analy@@ st say there is a good chance of being elected ; female voters hope she can boost the standing for women .

indian presidential election began on the 19@@ th , with the new president to be chosen from the inc@@ umb@@ ent vice - president she@@ k@@ haw@@ at and ra@@ j@@ as@@ than governor pr@@ ati@@ b@@ ha pati@@ l who recently re@@ signed .
pati@@ l is the first female presidential candidate in india 's history , who could become india 's first ever female president if elected .
pati@@ l is the nom@@ ine@@ e of the ruling national congress party , while she@@ k@@ haw@@ at is from the opposition b@@ har@@ ati@@ ya jan@@ at@@ a party .
since the national congress party domin@@ ates the electoral college for the president , both the media and the general public gu@@ ess pati@@ l has a higher possibility of being elected .
pati@@ l , 72 , was the female governor of the state of ra@@ j@@ as@@ than .
originally a law@@ yer , she made her way into the congress in 198@@ 5 . experienced in politics , she received good re@@ views from the government while serving as ra@@ j@@ as@@ than governor .
also committed to social welfare , she is the hon@@ or@@ ary chair@@ person of many cultural , educational and social welfare organizations .
analysts say pati@@ l was selected as a candidate for her unswer@@ ving lo@@ y@@ alty to s@@ onia g@@ and@@ hi , chair@@ person of the india national congress party .
in india , the g@@ and@@ hi family has controlled the ruling national congress party for a long time .
pati@@ l is supported by a great number of female voters , who believe that pati@@ l would re@@ build their image and boost their standing in india , where the concept of discrimination against women is serious .
under the constitution , india is a federal country , where the president is the nominal chief of state and commander of the armed forces , more of a sym@@ bo@@ l than representing any parties or organizations .

reports of di@@ a@@ bet@@ es drug av@@ an@@ di@@ a causing adverse re@@ actions increase significantly
according to a us media report on the 15th , there has recently been a tendency of significant increase in the number of adverse reaction reports , such as car@@ di@@ ac diseases , caused by the anti - di@@ a@@ bet@@ es drug av@@ an@@ di@@ a in the united states .
the us food and drug administration issued a safety warning in may this year , advis@@ ing di@@ a@@ bet@@ es patients to take av@@ an@@ di@@ a with cau@@ tion , because scientists issued a study report in an edition of the new eng@@ land jour@@ nal of medicine published on may 21 , saying the best - selling drug would significantly increase the rates of heart attack and death in patients .
the safety of av@@ an@@ di@@ a has thus been closely watched by doctors and patients .

the adverse re@@ actions were as minor as b@@ list@@ ers and as serious as sudden death due to heart attack .
however , drug experts at the us f@@ da believe it is yet too early to conclu@@ de that av@@ an@@ di@@ a is un@@ safe .
the f@@ da is going to hold a hearing regarding the safety of av@@ an@@ di@@ a on july 30 .
av@@ an@@ di@@ a , introduced in 1999 , is an insul@@ in sensi@@ tiz@@ er for treating type ii di@@ a@@ bet@@ es .
some six million di@@ a@@ bet@@ es patients around the world has taken or is taking av@@ an@@ di@@ a .

three major functions of modern military uni@@ forms
first is the identi@@ fying function ,
an important sym@@ bo@@ l to distingu@@ ish among armies of different nations , among different armed services , and between troops and civilians .
although the purposes of military uni@@ forms are basically the same in the armed forces of some 100 nations big or small around the world , no armed forces of any two nations have identical military uni@@ forms .
second is the sym@@ bol@@ izing function .
to some extent , military uni@@ forms not only reflect a country 's vitality and national characteristics , but also centr@@ ally show@@ cases the combating capabilities and servicemen qualities of a country 's armed forces .
of the three major categories of military uni@@ forms , dres@@ s uni@@ forms , service uni@@ forms and combat & training uni@@ forms , nothing is more able to fully demonstrate the might of a country and its military than the ne@@ at and el@@ eg@@ ant dres@@ s uni@@ forms .
third is the protective function .
with the rapid development of new and high - tech weapons , it has become a par@@ amount issue in the development of military uni@@ forms to improve the comprehensive protective performance of new combat & training uni@@ forms , so that military uni@@ forms have various functions , such as protecting from bul@@ lets , reconnaissance , chem@@ istr@@ y , b@@ ac@@ ter@@ ia and radi@@ ation , as well as condi@@ tioning the temperature , hu@@ mid@@ ity and air .

the party committee office of a batt@@ al@@ ion dare to get serious in handling thor@@ ny problems

by qu yi@@ mao and yang rui@@ yu : " the fact that we can live in an a@@ partment is attribu@@ ted to the determination and resolution of the batt@@ al@@ ion 's party committee office to vac@@ ate houses . "
today , more than ten cadres of a communications training batt@@ al@@ ion at the chengdu military region who moved into a@@ part@@ ments were all lit up with pleasure , as they were filled with admir@@ ation and gratitude for the working style of the " team " at the batt@@ al@@ ion 's party committee that dare to get serious and meet challenges when tackling thor@@ ny problems .
a few years earlier , with staff changing and being replaced , some homes in the batt@@ al@@ ion 's family d@@ or@@ mit@@ ory building were over - occupied in violation of rules , which brought housing difficulties to cadres on active service . both officers and soldiers are quite un@@ happy over it .
the batt@@ al@@ ion had tried to vac@@ ate the homes several times , but left it un@@ settled because of various resistance , making this problem a hard nu@@ t to crack .
" so long as we dare to get serious and are reasonable , there are no difficult problems that we ca n't solve . "
once the new party committee reached the consensus , principal leaders went out personally to begin a thorough clean@@ up regarding the problem of ir@@ regular housing occupation .
they tou@@ ched people senti@@ mentally and en@@ ligh@@ tened them sensi@@ bly on the one hand , hoping that those involved could put the overall situation into perspective ; on the other hand , they clari@@ fied applicable policies and rules of the troops about a@@ part@@ ments , pool funded housing and economically af@@ for@@ d@@ able housing , expressing the resolute determination and fundamental stance of the party committee .
for those people who had housing el@@ se@@ where , but were rel@@ uc@@ t@@ ant to return the over - occupied housing , the party committee office made timely contact with their units and took necessary measures to urge them give cooperation to the troops ' work on voluntary basis .
after two months of atten@@ tive efforts , all tenants in the bar@@ r@@ ack complex who over - occupied housing in violation of rules moved out on schedule , and the batt@@ al@@ ion 's cadres on active service were all allocated housing in compliance with policies .
the working style of the batt@@ al@@ ion 's party committee that dare to get serious and meet challenges also had chain effects , in that several cadres who were previously rel@@ uc@@ t@@ ant to give active cooperation in the organization 's allocation have now said they would follow the organization 's decisions .

jing@@ jiang department of people 's armed force cre@@ ates platform to boost quality of armed force cadres
by cao jia@@ wei and zhu chun@@ bin , pla daily : on june 18 , at an intensive training program for armed force cadres in the city of jing@@ jiang , jiangsu province , the lecture win the psychological warfare in the context of informationization by lu yu@@ qing , director of the x@@ il@@ ai town department of people 's armed force , received positive comments amongst all participants .
this was a fresh change as a result of the city 's department of people 's armed force loading burdens onto armed force cadres and working to boost the overall quality of armed force cadres in line with the reality of different posts .
at the beginning of this year , when doing grass@@ root research , the party committee of the department of people 's armed force found that some armed force cadres did not focus on doing work related to the armed forces due to long years of service and multiple duties .
therefore , they have conducted training regularly for armed force cadres using such methods such as intensive training , meeting as a way of training , relying on local party school to provide training , with a view to address problems such as narrow knowledge spec@@ tr@@ um and lack of vers@@ ati@@ le work skills .
in line with the core responsibilities , it has assigned tasks and loaded burdens onto armed force cadres bol@@ dly to improve their compe@@ ten@@ cy through on - the - job practice .
in addition , by actively coordinating with local organization departments , they jointly formulated the scheme of position competitions amongst armed force cadres , which explicitly requires head of an armed force department to be on the party committee of the same level without concurrently assuming other jobs ;
and set up an adjustment and exchange mechanism for armed force cadres , where@@ by some armed force cadres who are older or not suitable for grass@@ root armed force positions are adjusted or exchanged in a timely fashion , while comrades with good overall quality and high compe@@ ten@@ cy are promoted .
recently , chen y@@ is@@ ong , a cl@@ er@@ k of the armed force department at the new century ship@@ building co@@ . , ltd. , who led a militi@@ a technical unit to fill a vo@@ id of the nation with their innov@@ atively developed under@@ water ship wel@@ ding techni@@ que , was promoted to the company 's head of armed force department as an exception to the rule .
a good start calls for a good ending
sol@@ ely from the result of the game , a score of 2@@ -@@ 2 is reasonable and also acceptable to the chinese team . what 's essential is the process of the game , which is somewhat dis@@ appointing .
if it was the iranian team who led 2@@ -@@ 0 before the chinese team equ@@ alized the score , this would definitely give chinese soccer fans different feelings and significantly boost morale . unfortun@@ ately , things were just the opposite .
a good start without a good ending could be said a chron@@ ic problem of the chinese team .
the chinese team often does not know how to play soccer under favorable circumstances . the conventional view is that chinese players have less than satisfactory psychological quality .
this is indeed a reason why the chinese team could not have a " good ending . "
however , seen from today 's game of the chinese team , it seems this is not completely true .
people like li wei@@ feng are experienced veteran players , let alone people like sun ji@@ hai , sun xiang , sh@@ ao ji@@ ay@@ i and zheng zhi who have played soccer in europe . they have broad experience and knowledge , and should not have proble@@ matic psychological quality log@@ ically speaking .
the chinese team was unfortun@@ ately forced into a draw by the iranian team this time , most probably because of impro@@ per deployment of players .
the iranian team sub@@ stitu@@ ted with two people while tr@@ ailing behind and the situation improved in@@ stantly .
the chinese team also sub@@ stitu@@ ted with three players , but the result was not good .
to overcome the problem of having a good start without a good ending , the source of the problem must be sp@@ ot@@ ted .
as long as the problem is sp@@ ot@@ ted , it may not be difficult to find a solution to re@@ dres@@ s the problem .
what we fear is to see a doctor indiscrimin@@ ately in case of an emergency disease .
if things go on like that , the chron@@ ic problem will persist no matter how many games the chinese team plays , not to mention a step forward in each game that people expect .

the specific practice of the collaboration areas is to break the bound of units and in an area where the s@@ dr@@ d units are relatively concentrated , design@@ ate a brigade or regiment level unit as the coordin@@ ator , which will conduct centralized planning of theme education . units of different relationships of subordin@@ ation and aff@@ iliation attend lec@@ tures together at a close location or hold remote discussions with video systems .
education capabilities are centr@@ ally allocated by way of ro@@ t@@ ational lec@@ tures in con@@ junction with position competitions ; education hard@@ ware within a area is used in a coordinated manner , information and data , as well as experience in education of each unit are shared and exchanged , report t@@ ours about typical examples in an area are organized regularly , and officers and soldiers discuss what they have learned from study .

officers and soldiers receiving education also di@@ gest what is ta@@ u@@ ght , for fear of saying anything un@@ professional in front of officers and soldiers from friendly and neighboring units during discussion and analysis .
as such , pas@@ sions of the educ@@ ators and the educated are both effectively in@@ spi@@ red .
