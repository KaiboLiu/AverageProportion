( selected best of newspapers and periodicals ) shanghai : persons with concurrent jobs and graduates of institutions of higher education become main force of hourly wage earners .
xinhua news february 7 from beijing . shanghai municipal ministry of labor and social security announced its ' guide to minimum hourly wages for 2006 ' on february 6. the number of jobs covered reached 120 , 11 more than last time . wages for these jobs saw some increases and some decreases .
according to the estimations of relevant experts at the shanghai municipal ministry of labor and social security , shanghai already has over one million people who work for hourly wages .
according to a report in " china youth magazine , " graduates from institutions of higher education and people holding concurrent jobs ( holding two or more jobs at once ) are the main constituencies making up the ranks that work for hourly wages .
through direct surveying of nearly 8000 hourly paying jobs , it was found that over half of those surveyed hold concurrent jobs . the proportion of this group reaches 51.1 % of the whole .
the level of culture of concurrent job holders is usually fairly high , they mainly are employed in jobs with relatively strong technical natures , such as translation positions where the proportion of concurrent laborers is as high as 81.7 % , and fitness areas where the proportion reaches 61.6 % .
a high income is one important reason that many people are engaged in concurrent hourly paying jobs .
according to our understanding , some positions have monthly incomes that can reach several tens of thousands of rmb , such as some hard to fill positions like simultaneous interpretation . the majority of hourly positions have monthly incomes reaching 2000 rmb or more , such as those concurrent positions in financial affairs , wedding masters of ceremonies , and so on .
satisfying personal interests and expanding one 's knowledge is also an important reason that receives the attention of those holding concurrent jobs with hourly wages .
for example , mr. gu , who holds the position of manager of the human resources department of a certain enterprise , will take a few hours of time every week to handle the financial accounts of the representative office of a certain foreign business .
mr. gu believes that the biggest benefit of concurrent jobs is that it allows his knowledge to continually receive updates , and he has opportunities to be involved in another area . of course , a monthly income of 2000 rmb also has a certain attraction .
because some hourly positions have low employment thresholds , the circumstances of the jobs are flexible and free and have progressively received the attention of many graduates currently looking for positions . among those making hourly wages , 14 % are university or technical school graduates of the past three years .
" at first i did n't want to work for hourly wages , but after a few months , i think it 's better than going to work from nine to five . "
after college student huang graduated , the job she found was n't very ideal . finally she registered her name with a hotel to play background music on the piano .
" i am very satisfied with my current job . i make 100 rmb an hour , and the environment is good , what i want to do now is find more hourly wage jobs . "
according to our understanding , hourly wage work has already become an important path for graduates to accumulate work experience , exercise their working skills , increase their communication techniques , and grow social experiences .
graduates doing hourly work are mainly concentrated on positions with relatively strong technical and intellectual natures , such as translation positions and similar positions with relatively high professional natures and highly era - stylistic performance art positions . their proportion of hourly wages is 22.1 % and 26.8 % respectively .
some hourly work positions have lower technical skills , such as food sales promoter and tally clerks . unemployed persons can begin working these positions with only simple training .
the data shows that the proportion of people working hourly wage jobs that were originally unemployed reaches 39 % , among which retail jobs have a proportion as high as 68.4 % of workers that were unemployed , and a proportion of 58.7 % among food and beverage jobs . hourly wage jobs have become an important channel for the unemployed .

chinese expert : america beating drum of ' chinese military threat ' is irrational criticism
xinhua new february 9 from beijing ( reporters li xuanliang , xiong zhengyan , and lin liping ) the pentagon 's " quadrennial defense review report " formally handed over to congress in recent days has for the first time referred to china as ' the newly rising major nation most likely to present a military challenge to america ' .
experts believe this is an irrational criticism of china 's normal defense construction , a dramatization of the ' chinese military threat theory ' , and is an interference in china 's internal affairs .
the " quadrennial defense review report " is the pentagon 's new national defense policy paper .
this 92 page long report uses three sections to discuss the problem of chinese military force and what paths america should take to meet this problem . the report directly brings up ' china ' or ' chinese ' a total of 15 times , saying ' as a major and newly prosperous large nation , china has the most potential to carry out military competition with america . if america does not have counter - measures , china will likely develop destructive military technologies , thus breaking america 's advantage in conventional weapons . '
researcher yao yunzhu of the world military research department of the china military science institute says that , although high level american officials have expressed similar views many times before , this is the first time america put forward that ' china is the newly rising major country most likely to present a military challenge to america ' in its ' defense strategy reports ' .
' this report for the first time clearly takes russia , india , and china as newly rising strategic opponents , among which it especially gives even more consideration to the so called chinese military threat theory . '
said major general peng guangqian , researcher of the china military science institute .
worth noting is that on the same day that the " quadrennial defense review report " was formally handed in , american president bush also handed to congress the government budget for fiscal year 2007 , in which the defense budget reached 439.3 billion usd .
' if you add on to this the budget for the military movements in iraq and afghanistan , america 's 2007 fiscal year defense budget will breakthrough 500 billion usd , setting a new historic high ' peng guangqian said . ' this is nearly equal to the total military expenditures of all other countries in the world put together . '
peng guangqian believes that the method of america concocting ' threat theories from other countries ' reflects the pentagon 's usual style of ' creating enemies . ' its real aim is in striving for even more defense expenditures , and dredging up even more profits for america 's huge military industrial complex .
experts say , compared with america 's huge military expenditures , china 's defense expenditures are relatively limited .
military expert deng hongzhou , who has taken part in the writing of china 's defense white paper several times , said that since the 1990 's , along with economic development , china 's defense expenditures have increased , but have shown a declining trend in the total proportion of national revenue expenditures of the same period .

( international observation ) hamas looks for breakthrough in forming cabinet
xinhua news february 9 from ramallah ( internationl observation ) . hamas looks for breakthrough in forming cabinet
xinhua news reporter hao huangmin
after the palestine islamic resistance movement ( hamas ) obtained victory in legislative elections , how it will paint a blueprint for a new government has become a focal point the whole world is concerned with at the moment .
what kinds of new policies hamas will put forth will directly influence the direction taken by all concerned parties in corresponding policy for the peace process .
at the same time , the attitude of resistance of america and israel adds even more variables to the prospects of the hamas government .
at present , various palestinian factions are currently tightening their cooperation , and are actively searching for breakthroughs on the future development of the situation on sensitive points and difficulties that forming a cabinet involves .
( sub heading ) who will the position of premier fall to ?
after hamas obtained the right to form the cabinet , there have been people in the outside world who worry a ' hamas premier ' will likely see differently than the current high leader abbas .
also , hamas leader mashal , who is currently visiting egypt , emphasized that the new palestinian government established by hamas leaders will not continue to recognize israel . this intransigent standpoint also intensifies the worry of the international community .
america and israel explicitly state they will not accept a hamas government that controls real power , and have used this threat to cut off economic support and transmission of taxation to palestine .
however , this has not obstructed hamas in making flexible policy adjustments - choosing independents is a policy to split the difference .
according to reports , to acquire international approval across the largest range possible , earlier domestic and foreign hamas leaders meeting together in egypt decided to choose independent ismail haniyeh , chairman of the board of trustees of the islamic university in gaza , to be appointed the new premier .
this move has still not received the responses of concerned parties .
palestine analyst hussein said that no matter who the position of premier falls to , what is most crucial is the choice for premier must dilute the ' hard ' aspects of hamas as much as possible . only by doing this can the successful forming of a cabinet be secured .
( sub heading ) how to allocate power
looking at the internal makeup of the party , the biggest challenge that hamas faces in forming a cabinet is it lacks ample experience being in power .
the palestine " daily " published an analysis saying that while hamas gathered popularity through social welfare projects , in the area of being in power it lacks experience . hamas cooperating with the palestinian national liberation movement ( fatah ) , which has experience being in power , would be the best strategy .
hamas brought up establishing a ' government partner ' relationship with fatah after the elections to jointly establish a united ethnic government , however fatah has not given a positive response to this as of the present .
opinions among those in the fatah party as to whether or not to enter the cabinet are not the same . one faction advocates participating in the new government , and thus having something to say ; another faction refuses the invitation of hamas , and would rather be an ' active opposition faction ' in the legislature .
persons with sensitive information pointed out that under the advice of abbas , fatah is progressively leaning towards entering into the new government .
although this might be the case , hamas and fatah would still haggle over the allocation of cabinet positions .
besides this , another path would be to establish a cabinet that is free of party affiliations and outside the framework of the legislature .
according to reports , hamas has also designed a technocracy government , but the concrete list of names is still unknown .
in light of the attitude of israel and america , a technocracy government might still be accepted as a method to form a cabinet that would lessen outside pressure .
according to regulations of the palestine " basic law , " after the new legislature convenes on the february 16 , the nominations for premier and forming of a cabinet will be completed in three to five weeks .
( sub heading ) at a loss about armed forces
the weapons in the hands of hamas are another thorny problem that the forming of a new government faces .
america 's and israel 's attitude is extremely stiff . they staunchly demand hamas give up violence , and reject hamas taking part in government while carrying guns .
hamas leader mashal emphasized on february 9 that armed resistance is the ' strategic choice ' of his organization .
the arms problem in actuality includes two levels of problems : the legality of weapons , and the jurisdiction and management of armed forces .
hamas has obtained international acknowledgement for being the largest party in the legislature elected in a democratic and free manner , allowing its subordinate armed faction the ' qawasameh tribe ' to use legal avenues to unify itself into the government 's security organizations .
hamas once brought up unifying all armed factions into a palestine ethnic power organization ' people 's army . ' however it did not get a broad response , and also took criticism from the palestinian islamic jihad movement .
at present , palestine has over 60,000 security organization personnel , the vast majority of which come from the fatah camp .
also , fatah has some subordinate armed factions with loose organizational relations , such as the ' al-aqsa martyrs ' brigades ' and the ' fatah hawks ' and others .
hamas , which is responsible for forming the cabinet , must come to an understanding with abbas on how to manage these armed forces that each have their own power structures , and allocate the power of management of security in a reasonable way .
according to the reports of local media , abbas is interested in managing the security and information regiments , while the police and people 's guard and other organizations will be subordinate to the management of the department of the interior of the new government .
however , all sides are still carrying out discussions on this sensitive issue , and as of now there is nothing further .

the " report " estimates that as of the end of 2005 , china had already organized 22 antarctic science surveys , two arctic science surveys using the " xuelong " as a platform , and two survey 's from the huanghe arctic station . as of the present , china already has sent over 3000 people to personally go to the antarctic or the arctic to carry out on - sight surveys .
" at present we are currently doing feasibility research work into building the third antarctic survey station which would also be the first inland survey station for china . "
sun zhihui said .
" after over 20 years of hard work , china 's polar region survey enterprise already has a definite position among the world 's polar region surveys . however , compared with the other main polar region surveying countries , there still exists a relatively large discrepancy . we must push on ahead . "
he said .
sun zhihui revealed , china will publish polar region survey reports every year from now on .

japanese researchers develop new model highly effective artificial kidney
xinhua news february 13 from tokyo ( reporter qian zheng ) researchers of japan 's tokai university have developed a kind of biological artificial kidney . it not only has the same catabolic functions as a human kidney , it also has functions to maintain useful substances . it has a small volume , is easy to transplant , and with more research there is hope it will bring good fortune to kidney disease patients .
according to a report in previous days in the " nikkei business daily " , the newly developed biological artificial kidney is mainly made up of two parts . one part is the ' artificial kidney unit ' that strains out waste material and water from blood , the other part is the ' artificial urine tubes ' that returns water , amino acids and other useful materials back into the blood from crude urine .
the ' artificial kidney unit ' and the ' artificial urine tubes ' are both made up of hollow fibers . the inner side of the ' artificial urine tubes ' are lined with the epithelia of urine tubes that have the function of dissimilating waste material .
this type of epithelia can make diseases brought about by multiple blood dialysis - such as the materials causing the formation of ' amyloid degeneration related to dialysis ' dissolve into amino acids and return to the blood , while also allowing the glucose , vitamins , minerals and other things that the body needs returned to the blood .
artificial kidneys in the past relied on the difference between permeation pressure to filter metabolized waste , and could not totally get rid of everything . they also did not have the function of returning amino acids and other materials back into the blood .
researchers used a goat to carry out transplant experiments with the artificial kidney . pig epithelia was used for the hollow fibrous inner wall of the artificial kidney used .
after two weeks , researchers confirmed that the artificial kidney was functioning .
at present they are developing a biological artificial kidney using cells from human kidneys , and will begin clinical research after they verify its safety .
china 's safe production of electricity still faces serious challenges
xinhua news february 13 from beijing ( reporter an bei ) . an official of the state electricity supervision committee said on february 13 that although safe production of electricity in 2005 maintained an overall stable trend , the safe production of electricity still faces serious challenges .
shi yubo , chairman of the state electricity supervision committee , said at the 5th ( expanded ) state electricity safe production committee conference being held in beijing that china 's safe electricity production in 2005 maintained an overall stable trend . it satisfactorily completed the task of getting through the summer peaks , realized the safe supplying of energy , actively responded to the attack of natural disasters , and basically assured the safe and stable operations of the electricity system . safe electricity production facility accidents and normal electricity grid accidents saw a large decrease over that of last year , and the health level of electricity facilities received enhancement .
however , he also pointed out that with the changes of the supply and demand trends of electricity as well as the successive bringing into service of newly built generator groups , safe electricity production will face new challenges .
these challenges include the continued existence of regional , seasonal , and time interval power shortage phenomenon because electricity supply and demand trends of some areas are still tight . the supply of electricity coal ( coal used in generating electricity ) still has rather large problems because there is no excellent electricity coal pricing mechanism . at the same time , the problem of falling quality of electricity coal has not received effective controls , seriously influencing the stable operations of generator groups . the structure of some electricity grids are weak , facilities are old and bring hidden problems to system safety . the situation of common electricity infrastructure accidents has still not received a fundamental turn around , and the trend is still grim .
shi yubo said that with the deepening of reforms of the electricity system , many deep rooted contradictions will continuously be revealed . the new problems will become how to maintain the stability of the workforce , and secure a normal production order .
in terms of tasks for safe electricity production in 2006 , shi yubo expressed that we must further solidify the basic tasks of safe electricity production management , speed up the establishment and perfection of electricity safety emergency response management mechanisms , and increase the ability to handle unexpected incidents . in addition , we must strengthen the coordination of the power plant grid and jointly maintain the safety of the electricity system . we must also continue to do the tasks of supervision management and informational construction for large dam hydro electric plants , assure the safety of large dams , strengthen safety management of electricity construction , and decrease the occurrence of injuries or deaths from accidents . finally , we must continue to strengthen information reporting tasks and ensure the timeliness , accuracy , and free flow of electricity safety information .
according to our understanding , by uniting with the new trends in safe electricity management the electricity supervision committee will carry out modifications and perfections of the already published " temporary investigation regulations on electricity production accidents " this year , while the relevant accompanying documents on large hydro electric dam safety and safety protection of the second order electrical power system will be successively issued this year .
in 2005 china 's use of electricity reached 2.468 trillion kilowatt hours , a 13.5 % increase over the previous year .
facing an electricity supply and demand trend that is still tight and prominent coal power and oil transportation contradictions and other non - advantageous situations , various electricity enterprises have conscientiously taken effective measures and strengthened facility management . last year no extremely large facility accident occurred in the nation 's electricity production .
74 electricity grid accidents occurred , a decline of 127 from the previous year . 427 facility accidents occurred , a decline of 132 from the previous year .
south african minister assigned to china expressed south africa does not have ' organized ' crime directed at chinese citizens .
xinhua news february 13 from beijing ( reporters wang jiangang and hao yalin ) . temporary representative of the south african embassy in china vusi b. koloane expressed on february 13 while being interviewed by a xinhua reporter that south africa does not have ' organized ' crime directed at chinese citizens .
he also expressed that the south african government will do its best to " crush all forms of criminal activities . "
koloane expressed that the south african government hopes to " lower to zero " the crime rate , and hopes that the safety of the lives and property of all foreigners working in south africa will receive the ample assurance of local law and citizens .
since the beginning of 2006 , there have already been 4 chinese citizens that have been murdered in south africa . the chinese world has expressed extensive concern over this .
china 's ministry of foreign affairs has already put forward discussion of this to south african parties , and warned chinese citizens traveling in south africa to further strengthen their safety and defense knowledge . overseas compatriots should stick together and coordinate with police to jointly crush criminal behavior .
" we express the most sincere condolences and mourning to the families of those murdered . "
koloane said , " we feel apologetic because of this . please allow the people of china to believe that the south african government is currently seriously investigating every case that involves china . "
according to the statement of the chinese embassy in south africa , south african police have already successfully broken the case of chinese fujian female chen jianqing 's murder on february 5 , and one suspect is already arrested .
at present the police are pursuing another suspect .
also according to the south african embassy in china , a criminal wanted as a suspect in the january shooting of a hong kong businessman has already been arrested by south african police , and the belongings of the murdered person have already been retrieved .
when talking about the influence that chinese citizens being murdered is likely to produce , koloane believes that these events " indeed " will produce some negative effects on the trade , tourism , and other areas of exchange between the two nations ; but looking at the long term , the effects " should n't be great . "
according to the statements from assistant director of tourism manqoba nyembezi of the south african embassy , the embassy sent out over 2000 visas for travel to south africa by chinese in the first 15 days of this year alone .
also , according to china 's official statistical data , in 2005 south africa continued to keep china as south africa 's largest trading partner .
the volume of bilateral trade reached 7.27 billion usd , a year on year growth of 23 % .
however , personnel in the tourism field believe that the chinese citizen murders that happened in 2004 will have a clear effect on the number of chinese going to south africa to travel .
according to the statistics of the south african tourism bureau , the first half of 2005 saw 20,331 chinese tourists travel to south africa , a drop of 14.9 % with that of the year before .
at present there are around 200,000 chinese that live in south africa , spread throughout south africa 's cities , towns , and villages .
analysts believe that the disparity between rich and poor in south africa is great , the level of unemployment high , guns are everywhere , and there is no deterrence from a death penalty ; thus the crime rate is high .
because many chinese do not understand english but keep cash on their persons and at home , they more easily become targets for criminals looking for money .

below the banner was a huge picture of wang xuan ( over 10 square meters big ) . he is wearing glasses , smiling slightly , and his temperament is of learned elegance .
on both sides of the portrait were several dragon cypress trees and several tens of flower wreaths lined up on each side .

andrei kokoshin , head of russia 's state duma 's ( lower house of parliament ) committee on relations with the commonwealth of independent states , pointed out when giving a talk on the georgian parliament 's decision concerning russia 's peace keeping forces on the same day that this decision of georgia 's will damage the stability of the area , and produce non - advantageous influences on russian - georgian relations .
he emphasized that this decision of the georgian parliament will cause the relations of georgia and russian to take another step toward deterioration .
he believes georgian criticisms of russia are absurd .
that day georgia 's parliament passed a decision requiring russia 's peace keeping forces to stop their peace keeping activities in south ossetia , but did not confirm a concrete time limit by which russian peace keeping forces should withdraw .
georgia 's parliament criticizes that russian peace keeping personnel do not carry out their stipulated duties , and look at the activities that russia has taken in the conflict region as " aiming to annex this territory of georgia . "
the georgian parliament requires the government take active moves and consider bringing in an international peace keeping force into the south ossetia conflict region to replace russia 's current peace keeping activities in the area .
the georgian parliament also gave the task of amending the relevant agreements confirming russia 's peace keeping forces may be garrisoned in the conflict region to the government .
south ossetia is a self - governed state of georgia and borders russia 's republic of north ossetia - alania .
after the soviet union disintegrated , south ossetia proclaimed independence by itself , and for a long period has been in a state of antagonism with the georgian central government .
at present , russia has a 500 person peace keeping garrison in that region .
this force was garrisoned according to agreements signed by russia , georgia , north ossetia - alania , and south ossetia in 1992 .

this reporter learned from the state administration of work safety that they genuinely want to contain the frequent occurrence of large coal mine accidents , and this is the most important task .
for mine safety this year the state administration of work safety will carefully follow the following three things :
-- continue to fight for better control of methane gas .
the control of methane gas will place the principle of " first taking it out and then mining " in a prominent position this year .
if high methane gas pits do not carry out the principle of " first taking it out and then mining , " then they will be ordered to immediately stop production according to the law .
-- continue to fight for better consolidated closings .
the administration will totally and thoroughly close down the 5243 coal mines pits reported to society , as well as the over 700 coal mine pits newly reported from various locations .
these closings must be a regular task ; the administration must continuously close down those coal mines that destroy resources , pollute the environment , and are not equipped with safe conditions .
-- strengthen basic coal mine safety management .
the administration will immediately correct or prevent the deterioration of management of a small number of large state owned mines . it will lead management of disorderly small mines to establish standardized safety management systems .
the administration will especially manage key state owned mines ; never allowing production that exceeds ability , intensity , or manpower .
this year 's safe production control index demands that deaths from all types of accidents across the nation decline by 3 % over last year , with deaths from coal mining falling 3.5 % .
extremely large accidents where 10 or more deaths occur at once should fall by 5 % , and 7 % for coal mining .
these control indexes have already been received by the people 's government of all provinces . all locations are currently breaking down these indexes piece by piece and implementing them in the infrastructure and enterprises .
statistics show that in 2005 deaths from mining accidents across the nation were 5,986 , a fall of 0.7 % over the previous year .
however , deaths from especially large accidents with 10 or more deaths shot upwards , increasing 66.6 % over the previous year .

( winter olympics - stimulants ) news analysis : pyleva incident likely to end inconclusive
xinhua news february 17 from turin . news analysis : pyleva incident likely to end inconclusive
xinhua news reporter gao peng and ding ying
although italy repeatedly issued orders saying that all athletes discovered using stimulants during the turin olympics would likely face " the specter of jail ; " however , looking at various circumstances it seems that the main character in the first stimulant scandal of this winter olympics , russian biathlon athlete olga pyleva , will not likely face jail - time .
the turin olympic committee revealed the first stimulant scandal of the games on february 16. it was discovered that olga pyleva used the prohibited stimulant carphedon .
the next day , the international olympic committee announced that pyleva had already been expelled from the winter olympics , and the gold medal she won in the women 's biathlon 15 km individual race at this winter olympics had already been stripped from her .
the international biathlon union passed a punitive decision to ban pyleva from competition for two years .
it has always been that the international olympic committee stipulated that athletes discovered using stimulants at the olympic games would have their scores cancelled and have their qualifications for taking part in events taken away , but they would not receive the punishment of the law .
however , according to italian law , athletes carrying and using stimulants is considered criminal behavior and judicial authorities have the right to directly arrest and investigate the athlete using stimulates . those defying the law face anywhere from three months to three years in prison .
last december , the international olympic committee and the italian government concluded " negotiations " that had lasted as long as a year , finally reaching an agreement that both sides would deal with athletes using stimulants according to italian law at this winter olympics .
after the tireless efforts of the international olympic committee , italy gave a concession four days before the opening ceremony for the winter olympics , promising that during the winter olympics police would not enter the olympic village and search the residences of athletes . however , athletes that showed positive for drugs would still be investigated by italian authorities .
reports state that mario pescante , the official supervising the turin olympics for the italian government , has already handed over the pyleva stimulant incident to turin investigating authorities .
however , the international olympic committee and pescante have not confirmed this as of present .
russian team doctor for the biathlon team andrey dmytriev revealed on february 17 that pyleva had already left turin and returned to russia .
chinese sports official shi liancheng , who worked for many years at the world anti - stimulant organization , believes that as soon as pyleva returns to russia , this incident 's ending will likely be " inconclusive . "
shi liancheng said that the international olympic committee and the italian government have never " thoroughly resolved " the anti - stimulant problems at the winter olympics , and although the italian investigating authorities have indeed come into play , the results are hard to predict .
looking at the punishments in judgment of cases of domestic athletes using stimulants in italy , the most serious punishments that offenders have received is no more than " two years of suspended imprisonment . "
therefore , senior reporter pieri of italy 's ansa news expressed that the likelihood of pyleva going to prison is " extremely small , " and at most a fine will be given .
pieri expressed that although italian courts can carry out sentencing without the accused present , italian police are not likely to go abroad to bring pyleva back for punishment .
if pyleva refuses to accept the judgment , then italy will have no way to get her .
