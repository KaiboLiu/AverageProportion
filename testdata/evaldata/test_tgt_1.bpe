consensus on sea conflict tough to reach ; military talks between two kore@@ as end on bad terms
the three - day high - level military talks between the two kore@@ as , south korea and north korea , ended on bad terms today , as a result of each side stic@@ king to its own views regarding marking the sea border .

kim yong - ch@@ ol , obviously dis@@ pleased with a flu@@ shed face , attacked south korea for deliberately avoiding the discussion of drawing a new sea border to replace the existing " northern limit line . "
he pointed out that the " northern limit line " is not legitimate .

according to a china securities jour@@ nal report , with the introduction of the provisional measures for administration of out@@ bound investment of insurance funds a few days ago , insurance funds have more space to utilize the capital markets .
liu le@@ fei , chief investment officer of china life insurance co@@ . ltd. , believes that with renminbi appreciation and positive trends in domestic capital markets , insurance institutions in the near future will not make large - scale overseas investments with foreign exchange purchases . this also indicates that q@@ di@@ i in@@ su@@ rers will not diver@@ t domestic stock market capital in the near future .
the report said that many insurance institutions share the same view .
experts believe that as there is currently no market for renminbi der@@ i@@ v@@ atives , insurance institutions have insufficient means of avoiding risk . as a result , it is not time yet for large - scale foreign exchange purchases .
liu le@@ fei said that in terms of capital allocation , out@@ bound investment should make up a certain ratio of overall al@@ locations for insurance companies in the long run .
however , in view of relatively strong pressure for renminbi appreciation at present , china life will mainly use its own foreign exchange funds for out@@ bound investments .
foreign exchange purchases for out@@ bound investment should be handled carefully under the current situation .

chin@@ an@@ e@@ w@@ s@@ .@@ com , july 31 - on the 30@@ th , chen shuibian questi@@ oned an attempt by the island 's judicial personnel to interfere with the election of the taiwan region 's leaders .
taiwan 's " department of judicial administration director - general " k@@ ao ch@@ in - chi@@ h said on the same day that the current performance of the island 's judges does not match what chen shuibian said , and requested that chen shuibian explain what he said .
according to a report from taiwan 's united daily news , on the 30@@ th chen shuibian questi@@ oned interference , influence , and even attempts to control the election activities of the various parties ' candidates , due to political factors or election considerations , by judges , public prosecu@@ tors , or investig@@ ators . he claimed he hopes that this phenomenon does not exist in taiwan , but that it might be very difficult .
in response to chen shuibian 's questi@@ oning , taiwanese " judicial yuan president " w@@ eng yu@@ eh - sheng kept a low prof@@ ile and did not respond . " secretary - general " fan ku@@ ang - chun , on the other hand , assigned k@@ ao ch@@ in - chi@@ h to speak on behalf of the " judicial yuan . "
k@@ ao ch@@ in - chi@@ h said that both the taiwanese constitution and the " judges ' rules " pro@@ claim in writing that judges must be non@@ par@@ tis@@ an , cannot participate in political party activities , and cannot assist in elections ; judges abide by the relevant restrictions very carefully . the " judicial yuan " believes the judges are all doing a good job .
k@@ ao ch@@ in - chi@@ h gave an example , noting that judge j@@ ang shen@@ q - shi@@ i of kaohsiung " branch high court " participated a few years ago in a course conducted by the ket@@ ag@@ al@@ an school , and was punished because the course was tain@@ ted by a political party . the punishment resolution was by a self - disciplinary committee composed of judges .
j@@ ang shen@@ q - shi@@ i once wanted to take part in dpp primary elections , and eventually decided to give up because there was contro@@ vers@@ y over his election participation while working .
k@@ ao ch@@ in - chi@@ h thinks that if the ruling of an individual case can be appealed to a higher court for relief , it cannot be infer@@ red that a judge has political motives based only on whether the ruling is a win or a loss .
germany plans to lower barriers for bringing in specialized s@@ killed workers
staff report , ber@@ lin , july 1 ( correspon@@ dent wang huaicheng )
german education and research minister sch@@ av@@ an said a few days ago that germany should lower the immigration law restrictions on bringing in foreign specialized s@@ killed workers , using an introduction of foreign talent to solve germany 's specialized s@@ killed worker shortage problems .
according to an o@@ ec@@ d report , by 2010 , germany 's labor force between 15 and 64 years old will be shr@@ in@@ king ye@@ arly .
without enough immigrants , germany 's labor force by 20@@ 20 will be 6 % smaller than now .
however , reports from organizations such as the federation of german employers ' associations and the association for german engine@@ ers show that there is a relatively large shortage in the current german labor market for engine@@ ers and specialized technology workers .
according to data from the german federal labor agency , the german labor market had a supply shortage of about 1@@ 2,@@ 700 engine@@ ers and a supply shortage of about 9@@ ,@@ 600 technicians in may of this year .
germany has set high barriers for the introduction of foreign s@@ killed workers in order to protect local employment .
germany 's immigration law states that specialized s@@ killed workers from non - eu countries cannot ear@@ n less than 8@@ 5,@@ 500 euro@@ s per year in germany , or else cannot obtain german work and resid@@ ency permits .
sch@@ av@@ an proposed bringing this limit down to between 4@@ 0,000 and 6@@ 0,000 euro@@ s .
do n't believe blin@@ dly in the " theoretical field " of law
cla@@ use 8 of the revised draft of the law on lawyers , which was recently submitted to the standing committee of the national people 's congress for review , states : those who have undertaken specialized work such as legal research or teaching and had a high - level title or the equivalent , upon application to become a law@@ yer can be allowed to practice law after examination and verification by the state council 's judicial administrative department .
( june 28 , china youth daily )
in law , there is the " theoretical field " and the " practical field . " the former mainly includes " ab@@ str@@ act actions " such as legal teaching and research work , while the latter under@@ takes more " concrete actions " such as liti@@ gation , legal consultation , and legal services .
for a long time , " intellectual dis@@ par@@ agement " has exist@@ ed between the " theoretical field " and " practical field " of law . the " theoretical field " thinks that the " practical field " lacks necessary accompl@@ ishment in the law and are only mechanical " leg@@ alists " ; meanwhile , the response of the " practical field " to criticism by the " theoretical field " is " theory cannot guide practice . "
concerning this kind of division of labor gap , what the law can do is stay neutr@@ al instead of giving strong support to either side .
however , the " specially licensed law@@ yer system " in the law on lawyers objec@@ tively recogn@@ izes a judgment that the law 's " theoretical field " is above the law 's " practical field . "
the fact is that some experts and scholars who are engaged in resear@@ ching and teaching of p@@ ure legal theory , such as history of the legal system and international law , do not fit with practical law regardless of their depth of theoretical at@@ tainment .
in this way , for the law 's " practical field , " the " specially licensed law@@ yer system " no doubt opens a " bad door " which very neg@@ atively influ@@ ences chaos in qualifications .
this is not the only blind belief about the " theoretical field . " the phenomenon of expert opinions and expert panel discussions frequently influen@@ cing and even over@@ ruling court rul@@ ings is another direct manife@@ station of this kind of blind belief .

do not let pe@@ d@@ d@@ lers sp@@ oil public places
when out on a trip , one wants to feel relaxed , ref@@ re@@ shed , and free , enjoying to the utmost the fruits of natural scen@@ ery and society 's civilization .
however , many people encounter this kind of v@@ ex@@ ation when travel@@ ing dom@@ es@@ tically : being ch@@ ased and intercepted by pe@@ d@@ d@@ lers and mid@@ d@@ le@@ men in public places .
whether on au@@ to@@ s or tr@@ ains , bo@@ ar@@ ding or al@@ igh@@ ting , there are constant ent@@ ang@@ le@@ ments with small pe@@ d@@ d@@ lers and some unlicensed mid@@ d@@ le@@ men .
if they are not selling eg@@ gs , pe@@ an@@ u@@ ts , or s@@ es@@ ame se@@ ed ca@@ kes , they are selling newspapers and magaz@@ ines . there are also many unlicensed mid@@ d@@ le@@ men introducing restaurants and hotels , even pe@@ d@@ d@@ ling fake certificates and fake receipts , among other things .
if you do not accept , he can ch@@ ase you for a few hundred meters , like someone ready to die for a just cause in the face of failure .
at some scen@@ ic spots , many tourists also have the same feeling .
prior to entering the main gate , people come to pe@@ d@@ dle things like travel souven@@ irs and small cr@@ af@@ ts .
after entering , there is more of this kind of situation . no matter how good your mo@@ od , you will be bo@@ thered to the point of losing interest .
media have reported that many foreign tourists in xi@@ '@@ an sing endless pra@@ ise for the scen@@ ic spots and historic sites of xi@@ '@@ an , but cannot understand why masses of small pe@@ d@@ d@@ lers and haw@@ kers are allowed to sell everywhere .
public places including bus stations and scen@@ ic spots are at root places for trips and relaxation . they should be civilized , orderly , qui@@ et , harmonious , providing tourists a comfor@@ table and relaxed environment .
pe@@ d@@ d@@ lers ' freedom to come and go not only affec@@ ts the mo@@ od of tourists , it also destro@@ ys the public order of these public places on an objective level , bringing about visual pollution and environmental pollution . at the same time , it also gives law@@ less people the condition and opportunity for creating trouble .
the important thing is , these public places are win@@ dow@@ s onto the development of local spiritual civilization . one can de@@ duce much from little information . it is not only the image that suff@@ ers , as local economic development will be influ@@ enced as well .
just think , you want to make the tourism industry bigger and stronger , but use this kind of chao@@ tic tourism environment to welcome guests from near and far . who still wants to come ? who da@@ res to come ?
how can your tourism economy obtain beneficial results ?
with the coming of the peak travel season , it should be said that creating a civilized travel environment for tourists from near and far is an urgent matter .
public places are not markets . the operating behavior of small pe@@ d@@ d@@ lers and haw@@ kers should be standardized . put a firm stop to unlicensed operations , sta@@ un@@ ch@@ ly crack down on illegal activities .
only a civilized and orderly environment can let tourists come happ@@ ily , leave satisfied , and return with exc@@ it@@ ement .
in short , do not let pe@@ d@@ d@@ lers sp@@ oil public places .
" re@@ war@@ ding self - initiated exit from sub@@ sist@@ ence allowances " does not pass mu@@ ster
the ji@@ angu@@ om@@ en neighbor@@ hood in dong@@ cheng district , beijing , gave items such as re@@ fri@@ ger@@ ators as a reward to 12 poor families who ex@@ ited from sub@@ sist@@ ence allowances on their own initiative .
( beijing news , july 10 )
this writ@@ er fe@@ els happy for the improved lives of these families , but has mixed feelings about the phr@@ ase " self - initiated exit from sub@@ sist@@ ence allowances , " and the practice of " giving re@@ wards . "
an assistant director of the ji@@ angu@@ om@@ en neighbor@@ hood said , " in light of problems like che@@ ating on sub@@ sist@@ ence allowances , encouraging the self - initiated exit from sub@@ sist@@ ence allowances sets an example for other poor families . "
this example is indeed worth promoting if it encour@@ ages other poor people to get out of their predic@@ aments through one 's own hard work ; it is really somewhat na@@ ï@@ ve if it is thought this will " inspir@@ e " those people who have fraudul@@ ently received sub@@ sist@@ ence allowances for a long time .
when differen@@ ti@@ ating and straigh@@ tening out real and fake poor families , what should be reli@@ ed on more is the law .
relevant departments should strengthen the obligations that must be met for poor families to enjoy sub@@ sist@@ ence allowances : such as immediately reporting changes in family members ' incomes , reporting employment situation , and accepting regular re@@ views . meanwhile , relevant departments should increase the strength of supervision and investigation .
in the end , " exit from sub@@ sist@@ ence allowance according to the law " is the long - term solution .
who p@@ ays when the neighbor@@ hood gives material re@@ wards to families who exit from sub@@ sist@@ ence allowance ?
as a first - level governmental organization , a neighbor@@ hood has its expenses covered by financial al@@ locations .
however , should this tax@@ pay@@ er money be spent ?
on the one hand , families who exit from sub@@ sist@@ ence allowances prove that they already have a certain " self - sufficient " capacity ; on the other hand , are n't there still people who are applying for sub@@ sist@@ ence allowances ?
government financial al@@ locations , which is called a lif@@ eline , should provide timely help rather than reward good fortune .
liu gang@@ yi willing to be a service provi@@ der ; this is a more convinc@@ ing statement
on july 10 , chengdu city xin@@ du district mul@@ an town party committee secretary liu gang@@ yi , the first town party committee secretary in the country to be directly elected by the public , received his fourth review since taking office , achieving a satisfaction rate of 97 % .
liu gang@@ yi posi@@ tioned himself as a " service provi@@ der " during a conversation between this correspon@@ dent and liu gang@@ yi .
( yesterday , beijing news )
" service provi@@ der " in the words of liu gang@@ yi may be more real , more convinc@@ ing than " service provi@@ der " in the words of some appointed cadres .
the biggest advantage of being directly elected by the public compared to appointment is that for the former , determination of power mainly origin@@ ates with ordinary party members and the public , whereas for the latter , nomin@@ ations are mainly by superior organizations . therefore , direction of the power source determin@@ es that with the former , responsibility to the public must be given top priority .
the source of power , and to whom one ow@@ es responsibility , are basic elements that determine how elected people carry out their work .
some people question whether such " democratic review " is more like a " democracy show . "
my opinion is , having this kind of " democratic review " format is better than nothing .
considering the history and current situation of china 's grassroots democratic political development , i think direct election by the public is already a major breakthrough . democratic review is an important component of this pioneering work , and should not be unde@@ res@@ tim@@ ated in promoting grassroots democratic political development .

pati@@ l is the presidential candidate for the governing congress party , whereas she@@ k@@ haw@@ at comes from the opposition b@@ har@@ ati@@ ya jan@@ at@@ a party .
since the congress party has an advantage in the presidential electoral college , the media and public largely gu@@ ess that the possibility of a pati@@ l victory is higher .
pati@@ l , who is 72 years old this year , was ra@@ j@@ as@@ than 's female governor .
she started out as a law@@ yer , entering parliament in 198@@ 5 . with abundant political work experience , she received high opinions from the government when governor of ra@@ j@@ as@@ than .
she has also dedicated herself for social welfare , as hon@@ or@@ ary chair@@ woman for many cultural , educational , and social welfare organizations .
analysts note that pati@@ l became a candidate as a result of her unswer@@ ving lo@@ y@@ alty to s@@ onia gh@@ and@@ i , president of india 's congress party .
in india , the gh@@ and@@ i family has been controlling the governing congress party for a long time .
pati@@ l has received many female voters ' support . female voters believe that in india where there is a strong concept of discrimination against women , pati@@ l will rem@@ old the image of women and raise the status of women .
the constitution stipulates that the president of india , a federal country , is the country 's leader and commander - in - chief of the armed forces in name , without representing any party or organization . it is more of a sym@@ bo@@ l .

us media quoted a department of defense official saying , because the iraq war is still in progress and us relations with russia and iran have wor@@ sen@@ ed , those at the leadership level of the department of defense questi@@ oned the vi@@ ability of the plan to cut troops posted in europe .

however , in june this year , chief of staff cr@@ ad@@ doc@@ k at us european command head@@ quarter submitted a report to the current secretary of defense gates , raising doubts about the abo@@ v@@ em@@ enti@@ oned reduction plan .
the report said that while the military strength of us troops posted in europe was being reduced , many of the units were ro@@ t@@ ated and transferred to fight in iraq and afghanistan . this caused a short@@ fall in us troops posted in europe and even made it impossible to carry out cooperation with their european allies as normal .
the report suggested termin@@ ating the plan to reduce us troops posted in europe .

the batt@@ al@@ ion also cle@@ ared out the a@@ part@@ ments several times before , but due to resistance they settled the matter by leaving it un@@ settled , which turned this issue into a long - standing problem .
" if only one stic@@ ks to one 's guns and is fair and reasonable , there are no un@@ sol@@ v@@ able problems . "
after the new party committee team achieved consensus , major leaders came out in person to set about completely clearing up all the problems where a@@ part@@ ments were occupied contrary to regulations .
on the one hand , they appealed to people 's emo@@ tion and explained through reason , hoping that the people concerned would consider the overall situation ; on the other hand they explained clearly the related policies and regulations on military a@@ part@@ ments , po@@ ol@@ ed housing and economic housing , and made clear the party committee 's determination , resolve and stand@@ point on principles .
for some people with housing el@@ se@@ where yet unwilling to withdraw from over - occupied housing , the party committee promptly cont@@ acted their work unit and took corresponding steps to urge them to actively cooperate with the army 's work .
after two months of painstaking work , all the residents of buildings on the cam@@ p@@ grounds that were over - occupied against regulations moved out on schedule and the serving batt@@ al@@ ion cadres were al@@ lo@@ tted housing according to regulations .
this style in which the batt@@ al@@ ion party committee da@@ res to stick to its guns and struggle against obstacles also created a domin@@ o effect : a few cadres originally unwilling to actively cooperate with the organization 's allocation , now also , one by one , expressed submission to the organization 's decision .

for this reason , they adopted centralized training , held meetings instead of lec@@ tures , reli@@ ed on local party schools to perform training and other methods , and perio@@ dic@@ ally carried out training for full - time cadre in an effort to solve such problems as the full - time cadres ' narrow sphere of knowledge , sing@@ ular professional capability , etc.
based on core work , they bol@@ dly assigned duties and increased the pressure on people 's armed forces full - time cadres , and through on - the - job training improved their work compet@@ ence .
meanwhile , they actively coordinated with local organization departments and jointly drew up the " people 's armed forces full - time cadre achieving position through competition plan . " this clari@@ fies the regulation that the director of the people 's armed forces department must enter the party committee leading group at the same grade and may not concurrently hold any other offices .
a full - time cadre ro@@ tation arrangement system was established to promptly ro@@ t@@ ate and exchange older full - time cadre unable to adapt to grassroots people 's armed forces work , while those comrades with good overall character and strong work capabilities were given promo@@ tions and put to use .
not long ago , chen y@@ is@@ ong , the secretary in charge of the people 's armed forces department at new century ship@@ y@@ ard ltd. , led a militi@@ a technical squad that innov@@ ated and developed an under@@ water vessel wel@@ ding technology which made up for a def@@ ici@@ ency in this nation . he was given an accelerated promotion to director of the company 's people 's armed forces department .
if you start well , you should fin@@ ish well
simply speaking from the match result , a 2@@ -@@ 2 score is reasonable and is also acceptable to the chinese team . the key is that the match itself left people feeling somewhat dis@@ appointed .
if iran was in the lead 2@@ -@@ 0 and then china came back to even the score , the impression given to chinese fans would definitely be different and morale would have lifted a lot . what a p@@ ity that the situation was exactly the opposite .
one could say that starting well and being unable to fin@@ ish well is an old problem for the chinese team .
the chinese team often plays poor soccer when their situation is extremely favorable , and the view of the average person is that the chinese players are mentally not strong enough .
indeed , this is one of the reasons china is inc@@ ap@@ able of " fin@@ ishing well . "
however , looking at china 's match tonight , this does not necessarily see@@ m to be the case .
not menti@@ oning sun ji@@ hai , sun xiang , sh@@ ao ji@@ ay@@ i , zhen zhi and others who played soccer in europe before , li wei@@ feng and others are also old war veter@@ ans . they have extensive experience and , log@@ ically speaking , should not have any problems p@@ sch@@ ologically .
regre@@ t@@ fully , this chinese team was held to a draw by iran , and i am afraid that the reason was in@@ effective deployment of troops in the course of a battle .
while lag@@ ging behind , iran sub@@ stitu@@ ted two people , and the scene immediately improved .
china also sub@@ stitu@@ ted three players in the second half , but the result was not good .
to overcome the old problem of starting well and being unable to fin@@ ish well , they must correctly determine the source of the problem .
as long as the problem can be correctly determined , it should not be hard to find a way to remove the problem .
what they really should fear is acting blin@@ dly out of des@@ per@@ ation .
if they continue this way , no matter how many mat@@ ches the chinese team play , they will continue to repeat their old problem . this is a far cr@@ y from everyone 's expec@@ tation to see them improve with each match they play .

staff report by x@@ ue bing@@ jian and correspon@@ dent xu ye@@ qing : the phenomenon of difficult organization , few resources , and individual operation in educating the " small , sc@@ attered , remote and direct " units will become a thing of the past at a second artillery base .

director of the political department at the base , zhang sheng@@ min , told reporters that establishing political education coordination sections has not only reduced wast@@ age of educational resources , but has also deepened the effect of the education .
some politics instruc@@ tors were afraid to lose points in front of officers and men from other units , so they took the initiative to learn new knowledge and seek out new methods of education .
the officers and men receiving education also actively di@@ ge@@ sted the educational content l@@ est they s@@ ounded un@@ professional in front of officers and men from neighboring units in their discussions and analy@@ ses .
in so doing , the enthusiasm of the educ@@ ators and the educated has been both effectively sti@@ r@@ red up .
