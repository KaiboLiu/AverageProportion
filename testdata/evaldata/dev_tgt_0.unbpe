afp on the 16th , brussels
panic strikes as signs of bird flu virus continue to emerge in europe .
the european commission passed an additional measure to set up a " buffer zone " to fully administer the areas in countries where bird flu has been discovered , banning trade and transport of all poultry .
eight days after discovery of the pathogenic h 5n1 virus in the african country of nigeria , outbreaks continued to spread to more chicken farms , with signs indicating it has crossed the northern border into niger .
egyptian officials are investigating a sudden incidence of mass chicken deaths on a chicken farm in the south , fearing that the virus may continue to spread .
with chicken markets in europe plummeting from the impact of virus incidents , the european commission reiterated that there is actually no reason to panic .
kyprianou , the european commissioner for health and food safety , said it is understandable that the public is concerned , but there is no need to overreact .
following an earlier measure creating three - kilometer protection zones and 10 - kilometer surveillance zones around outbreaks of the virus , the european commission issued an additional new regulation setting up a " buffer zone " in the entire region of europe where the virus has been discovered .
an eu official , who declined to be named , said that everyone is on high alert as they process from morning till night news of suspected outbreaks from around europe .
so far in europe , signs of the h 5n1 virus have emerged in austria , bulgaria , croatia , germany , greece , italy , romania , slovenia , ukraine , and the european territory of russia , among other places , almost all found on wild swans .
romania discovered its 31st case on the 16th . new cases were also found in slovenia , austria , greece , and on the island of ruegen in germany .
in southern italy , the bird flu virus was found on two ducks , the first creatures other than wild swans infected with the h 5n1 virus in europe .
eu officials are now most worried about migratory birds which will soon return from africa .
the nigerian government is stepping up efforts to prevent the virus on the african continent from spreading to humans .
the nigerian government announced that poultry in a radius of five kilometers from affected farms , whether threatened by the virus or not , must be destroyed without exception .
the neighboring country of niger declared a national alert and allocated 4 million us dollars to an emergency program to monitor the border with nigeria .
the newly established national emergency commission said they have received reports that nearly 400 poultry have died in magaria , which is on the loosely guarded border between the two countries .
china 's new management rules for e-banking operations to take effect on march 1
xinhua news agency , beijing , feb. 6 ( correspondents han jie and xu bo ) on the 6th , reporters learned from the china banking regulatory commission that the measures for administration of e-banking business and the security evaluation guidance on e-banking issued recently by the cbrc will take effect on march 1 , 2006 .
a cbrc spokesperson said that according to the rules of the measures for administration , relevant approval methods for foreign financial institutions basically remain unchanged , that is , after a foreign bank branch is approved to initiate e-banking operations , if new types of e-banking operations need to be added , the main reporting office in china for such bank branch should submit a uniform application for review and approval .
in order to standardize e-banking operations of commercial banks , the people 's bank of china promulgated the interim measures for administration of e-banking business in june 2001 .
the cbrc spokesperson said that with the continuous development of commercial bank e-banking operations , the interim measures can no longer meet the requirements of e-banking risk supervision . therefore , the cbrc formulated these two new rules .
according to the introduction by the cbrc spokesperson , cbrc accreditation of security evaluation institutions is different from administrative approvals concerning the entrance eligibility of industries or enterprises . it is not a necessary condition for evaluation institutions to carry out e-banking security evaluation business , but rather serves as a reference for financial institutions for selecting evaluation institutions .
as long as a security evaluation institution meets the relevant conditions and requirements , even if it does not have cbrc accreditation , financial institutions can still hire it to conduct e-banking security evaluation , though management shall be carried out in accordance with relevant regulations .
the measures for administration of e-banking business include 99 articles under nine chapters , with the nine sections covering general provisions , applications and amendments , risk management , administration of data exchange and transfer , outsourcing business , administration of transnational business , supervision and management , legal obligations , and by - laws .
the security evaluation guidance on e-banking includes 57 articles under five chapters , with the five sections covering general provisions , security evaluation institutions , implementation of security evaluations , administration of security evaluation activities , and by - laws .

( selected excerpts from newspapers and magazines ) shanghai : moonlighters and college graduates become main hourly workforce
xinhua news agency , beijing , feb. 7 the shanghai labor and social security bureau released the latest 2006 wage guidelines for hourly workers on the 6th . the number of job positions reached 120 , 11 more than the previous time , while the prevailing wages in previous existing positions had increases and decreases .
according to estimates by relevant experts at the shanghai labor and social security bureau , currently the number of hourly workers in shanghai has exceeded 1 million .
according to a china youth daily report , the hourly workforce is mainly composed of college graduates and moonlighters .
a direct survey of nearly 8,000 hourly workers found more than half of them are moonlighters , accounting for 51.1 % .
in general , moonlighters have relatively higher levels of education and are mainly engaged in more technically focused work . for instance , among translation - related jobs , the percentage of moonlighters has reached 81.7 % , while it has reached 61.6 % for people in fitness professions .
high wages are one of the major reasons for many people to get second jobs as hourly workers .
it was learned that some specific positions such as simultaneous interpreters can earn monthly incomes of tens of thousands of yuan and are also in high demand . most hourly workers such as freelance accountants or masters of ceremony at weddings can make more than 2,000 yuan a month .
satisfying personal interests and expanding knowledge are also major reasons why hourly work appeals to people .
for example , mr. gu , a human resources manager in a company , spends a few hours each week doing accounting for the representative office of a foreign company .
mr. gu thinks the greatest benefit of the second job is that it allows him to continuously update his knowledge and to have the chance to get involved in another field . of course , the monthly income of 2,000 yuan certainly has some appeal as well .
as some hourly positions have low minimum requirements and work styles which are flexible and independent , they are gradually gaining favor among many graduates looking for jobs . some 14 % of hourly workers are college or technical school graduates from within the past three years .
" at first i did n't want to be an hourly worker . yet after working for a few months , i feel it is better than working from 9 to 5. "
xiao huang , whose job after college was not satisfying , eventually signed up with a hotel to play background music on the piano .
" i am quite satisfied with my current job . it pays 100 yuan per hour and has a nice environment too . what i need to do now is find a few more hourly positions . "
it was learned that working at hourly positions has become an important approach for some job - seeking graduates to accumulate work experience , practice work skills , enhance communication skills , and increase exposure to society .
hourly jobs taken by graduates are mainly concentrated in knowledge - based and more technically focused positions . for instance , specialty focused jobs like those related to translation and trendy entertainment account for 22.1 % and 26.8 % , respectively .
some hourly jobs require few skills , such as food salespeople and inventory workers . laid - off workers can start work right after minimal training .
statistics show that among hourly workers , 39 % were previously laid - off workers . among them , the unemployed working in the retail sector has reached 68.4 % , while the percentage in the catering sector has reached 58.7 % . hourly jobs have become a major channel for the jobless to get reemployed .

chinese experts : us playing up " china military threat " is groundless accusation
xinhua news agency , beijing , feb. 9 ( correspondents li xuanliang , xiong zhengyan , and lin liping ) in the quadrennial defense review that the us pentagon has officially submitted to congress recently , china was for the first time called " an emerging power that has the greatest potential to militarily challenge the united states . "
experts think this is a groundless accusation against china 's normal national defense construction . it plays up " china military threat " and interferes in china 's internal affairs .
the quadrennial defense review is the pentagon 's new national defense guideline document .
the 92 - page - long report devoted three paragraphs to commenting on china 's military issues and the countermeasures the united states should take . directly mentioning the two phrases of " china " or " chinese " 15 times , the report said that " as a major and emerging power , china has the greatest potential to compete militarily with the united states . if the united states does not have countermeasures , china will very likely develop disruptive military technologies so as to destroy us advantages in conventional weapons . "
yao yunzhu , a research fellow from the department of world military studies of the chinese military academy of sciences , said that though senior us officials expressed similar views on various occasions earlier , this is the first time the united states proposed in its " national defense strategy report " that " china is an emerging power that has the greatest potential to militarily challenge the united states . "
" the report for the first time explicitly refers to russia , india and china as emerging strategic rivals ; in particular , more attention was given to the so - called ' china military threat , ' "
said major general peng guangqian , a research fellow with the chinese military academy of sciences .
noticeably , on the same day the quadrennial defense review was officially submitted , us president bush also submitted a government budget for the 2007 fiscal year to congress , with the national defense budget at 439.3 billion us dollars .
" if the additional budget for military operations in iraq and afghanistan is added , the us national defense budget for 2007 fiscal year will go beyond the milestone of 500 billion dollars , an all time high , " peng guangqian said . " that is almost equal to the sum of the military spending of all the other countries in the world . "
peng guanqian thinks that the fabrication of " foreign threats " by the united states reflected the pentagon 's habitual style of " making enemies " and that its real purpose is to secure more national defense funds so that the huge us arms industry groups can fish for more profits .
experts said that compared with huge military expenditures of the united states , china 's national defense expenditures are quite limited .
deng hongzhou , a military expert who has participated several times in drafting the white papers on china 's national defense , said that china 's defense expenditures have somewhat increased with economic development since the 1990s , but the proportion it takes in the state national budget for the same period is on the decline .
official statistics show that compared with 1979 , the proportion of china 's expenditures for national defense in 2004 in the state budget for the same period dropped by nearly 10 percentage points .
in 2005 china 's expenditures for national defense was 244.656 billion rmb , only about 1/14 of that of the united states . its military expenditure per capita was about 1/60 of that of the united states , and its military funding per soldier was about 1/30 of that of a us soldier .
" the united states is equal to china in terms of territorial area , but there is such a big difference in military expenditures . it is self - evident whose military power is beyond normal defense needs . "
peng guangqian said .
teng jianqun , director of the research department of the china arms control and disarmament association , said that the united states should evaluate china 's military construction situation objectively and that china 's peaceful development does n't necessarily mean that china and the united states will become military antagonists in the future .
china 's 2004 white paper on national defense says that china firmly adheres to the path of peaceful development and adopts a national defense policy that is defensive in nature .
china has never threatened any country in the past and at present , and will never do so in the future .
so far china has not set up any military base in any other country , nor has china dispatched a single soldier to other countries . in contrast , the united states has established more than 100 military bases overseas and has deployed more than 100,000 soldiers in asia alone .
zhu feng , a professor of the international relations institute of peking university , said that china and the united states should increase communication and exchange through established channels and enhance understanding and mutual trust so as to fully push forward the china - us constructive cooperation in the new century and jointly promote and safeguard world peace and development .

( international observation ) hamas seeks breakthrough in forming cabinet
xinhua news agency , ram allah , feb. 9 ( international observation ) hamas seeks breakthrough in forming cabinet
xinhua news agency correspondents wang hao and huang min
after the palestinian islamic resistance movement ( hamas ) won the legislative council elections , how to draw up a blueprint for a new government has become the current focus of international attention .
what new policies hamas will push for will directly impact the direction of subsequent corresponding policies by the various parties to the peace process .
in the meantime , resistance by the us and israel will add to the uncertainty about the prospects of the hamas government .
at present , various parties in palestine are accelerating consultations and actively seeking breakthroughs on difficulties and sensitive points regarding future developments involved in forming the cabinet .
( subtitle ) who will become prime minister ?
after hamas obtained the right to form the cabinet , some outsiders worried that disagreements could occur between " prime minister hamas " and current top leader abbas .
in addition , hamas leader mashal , who is currently visiting egypt , stressed that the new palestinian government led and formed by hamas will not recognize israel . this strong message also increased international concern .
the us and israel explicitly said that they would not accept a hamas government which possesses actual power , threatening to discontinue economic aid and tax transfers to palestine .
however , this did not hinder hamas from making a flexible tactical adjustment , selecting an independent individual as a compromise .
according to reports , in order to obtain maximum international recognition , hamas leaders both at home and abroad , who recently gathered in egypt , decided to select independent jamal al-khudairi , board chairman of the islamic university in gaza , as new prime minister .
the move has yet to receive responses from relevant parties .
palestinian analyst hussein said that no matter who becomes prime minister , the key is that the prime minister nominee should try to downplay the hard - line stance of hamas . only in this way can success in forming a cabinet be ensured .
( subtitle ) how to divide power ?
internally , the biggest challenge hamas faces in forming a cabinet is its lack of sufficient experience in governance .
an article carried in the palestinian newspaper al-ayyam analyzed that although hamas won popularity through its social welfare programs , it lacks experience in governance . it would be wise for it to cooperate with the palestinian national liberation movement ( fatah ) , which has experience in governance .
following the elections , hamas proposed establishing a " political partnership " with fatah so as to jointly form a national coalition government . however , fatah has not responded enthusiastically so far .
fatah is currently divided internally with regards to joining the cabinet . one faction advocates joining the new government so as to make some kind of move , while another faction rejects the hamas invitation , preferring to be an " active opposition " in the legislative council .
sources noted that under abbas 's persuasion , fatah is gradually leaning toward joining the new government .
in spite of this , hamas and fatah will still bargain over the distribution of cabinet positions .
in addition , another approach is to form a cabinet outside the framework of the legislative council , breaking away from partisan affiliations .
according to reports , hamas has designed a government exclusively composed of experts , but the specific name list is unknown .
based on us and israeli attitudes , forming a government composed of technical experts would also be a good way to relieve outside pressure .
according to the provisions of the palestinian basic law , after the new legislative council assumes power on the 16th of this month , the nomination of the prime minister and formation of the cabinet will be completed within three to five weeks .
( subtitle ) what about arms ?
the weapons it possesses is another tough issue hamas faces in forming the new government .
the us and israel are very firm in their positions , resolutely demanding that hamas abandon violence and rejecting its armed participation in the government .
hamas leader mashal stressed on the 9th that armed resistance is a " strategic choice " of the organization .
the issue of weapons actually exists on two levels , the legitimacy of arms and the affiliation and administration of armed forces .
hamas won international recognition by being elected the top major party in the legislative council through democratic and free methods . the way to similarly legalize its subordinate armed faction az a - din al-qassam brigades is to integrate it into government security institutions .
hamas had previously proposed unifying armed forces of all factions into a " people 's army " of the palestinian national authority , yet failed to get widespread response and was criticized by the palestinian islamic jihad ( jihad ) .
at present , palestine has more than 60,000 security agency personnel , most of whom come from the fatah camp .
in addition , fatah has some loosely organized subordinate armed factions , such as al-aqsa martyrs ' brigades and the fatah hawks .
hamas , which is responsible for forming the cabinet , must reach a consensus with abbas as to how to manage these autonomous armed forces and reasonably divide administrative power .
according to local media reports , abbas intends to be in charge of security and intelligence forces , while leaving agencies such as the police and civil defense under the administration of the interior ministry of the new government .
however , the various parties are still negotiating over this sensitive issue , with no outcome so far .

since it was the first report on polar exploration china released , the 2005 annual report on china 's polar exploration also reviewed and summarized china 's polar exploration that started in the early 1980s .
according to the report , in 1983 , china officially joined the antarctic treaty and became a member country of the organization . in addition , china successively became a member country of a few most influential international organizations on antarctic affairs , including the antarctic treaty consultative meeting , the scientific committee on antarctic research , and the council of managers of national antarctic programs .
in 1997 , china became a member of the international arctic science committee and won a say in and the right to making decisions in international polar affairs .
the report noted that after more than 20 years , china 's polar exploration " has taken shape out of nothing and continued to grow in scale , " forming a " three stations , one vessel " system on antarctica and arctic exploration , namely , the changcheng station in the antarctic established in february 1985 and the zhongshan station in the antarctic established in february 1989 , and the huanghe station built in july 2004 in the arctic , as well as the " xuelong " polar scientific research vessel that was put into operation for antarctic and arctic exploration since 1994 .
the statistics in the report show that by the end of 2005 , china had organized 22 antarctic expeditions , two arctic expeditions based on the " xuelong " vessel , and another two arctic expeditions at the huanghe station . to date , more than 3,000 scientific visits have been made by chinese people nationwide to the antarctica and arctic for up close and on - site exploration .
" we are now carrying out feasibility study of setting up the third antarctica scientific station and also china 's first inland station at the antarctic . "
sun zhihui said .
" after more than 20 years ' endeavors , china has got a niche in polar exploration in the world . however , compared with other major polar exploration countries , there is still a relatively large gap . we must catch up with them . "
he said .
sun zhihui disclosed that china will issue a report on polar exploration every year starting this year .

the recently concluded " super bowl " american football game has warmed up the us broadcasting business to welcome the age of hdtv .
according to a financial times report the other day , the us congress recently passed a bill requiring that american broadcasters must discontinue all current analog tv signal broadcasting and only broadcast digital tv signals by february 17 , 2009 .
this means that the full digitization of us television programs now has a clear timetable .

although digital tv has been brought up repeatedly in the past few years , it has still not become reality .
the issue has taken a new turn this year .

japanese researchers develop new type of high - efficiency artificial kidney
xinhua news agency , tokyo , feb. 13 ( correspondent qian zheng ) researchers at japan 's tokai university have developed a type of bio - artificial kidney , which not only has the same catabolic functions as a human kidney , but also the function of preserving useful substances . in addition it is small in size and easy to transplant . with further research , there is hope it will bring good news to kidney patients .
according to a recent nikkei business daily report , the newly - developed bio - artificial kidney mainly consists of two parts , an artificial nephron that filters metabolic waste and water from the blood and an artificial renal tubule that returns to the blood the useful ingredients in primary urine , such as water and amino acids .
both the " artificial nephron " and the " artificial renal tubule " are made of hollow fibers . in addition , the interior of the artificial renal tubule is fully lined with renal tubular epithelial cells which have the ability to decompose metabolic waste .
the epithelial cells can decompose the causative substance of dialysis - related amyloidosis , a disease caused by repeated hemodialysis , into amino acids and return them to the blood while reabsorbing into the blood the glucose , vitamins , and minerals the body needs .
in contrast , previous artificial kidneys , depending on the difference of osmotic pressures to filter metabolic waste , were unable to remove that completely and nor did they have the ability to return ingredients such as amino acids to the blood .
researchers tested the bio - artificial kidney transplant on goats , using a pig 's epithelial cells to line the interior of the hollow fibers of the artificial kidney .
two weeks later , researchers confirmed that the artificial kidney had been able to function .
they are presently developing a bio - artificial kidney using human renal cells and will start clinical studies after testing its safety .
safe power production in china still faces serious challenges
xinhua news agency , beijing , feb. 13 ( correspondent an bei ) a senior official from the state electricity regulatory commission said on the 13th that although power production safety remained generally stable in 2005 , safe power production still faces serious challenges .
at the fifth ( expanded ) meeting of the national commission for safe power production held here , serc vice chairman shi yubo said that in 2005 china 's power production safety was generally stable , while power supply during the peak summer season was successfully and safely accomplished . active efforts were made to cope with the effects of natural disasters , and the safe and stable operation of the power supply system was basically ensured . accidents involving power production safety infrastructure as well as general power grid accidents were significantly reduced on a year - on - year basis , and the physical condition of power supply infrastructure was improved .
nevertheless , he noted that along with changes in the power supply and demand situation and the operation of a large number of newly - built power generator units added in succession , safe power production will face new challenges .
included in these challenges are : regional , seasonal , and periodic power shortages will continue to exist ; the power supply and demand situation in some regions will remain quite tight ; the lack of a good mechanism for coal pricing for power generation will continue to result in relatively big coal supply problems , while at the same time , the lack of effective control over the declining quality of coal will produce serious impact on the stable operation of power generator units ; some weakly structured parts of power grids and outdated equipment may pose hidden hazards to the safety of the system ; and the frequency of accidents in power infrastructure construction has yet to be brought under control , with the situation remaining grim .
shi yubo said that with the deepening of electricity system reform , many contradictions at deep levels will continue to emerge . how to maintain a stable working staff and ensure normal production order will become new problems .
with regard to power production safety work in 2006 , shi yubo said that efforts should be made to further strengthen the basic administration of power production safety ; accelerate the establishment and improvement of administrative mechanisms for power safety emergencies ; enhance capabilities for handling emergencies ; step up coordination and cooperation among power producers and power grids so as to jointly maintain power system safety ; continue to effectively supervise dam safety for hydro - electric power stations and to work on developing information networks to ensure dam safety ; strengthen safety supervision in power infrastructure construction to reduce accidents resulting in casualties ; and continue to enhance information reporting and notification to ensure the accurate and timely flow of power safety information .
it was learned that in connection with the new power safety administration situation , this year the serc will carry out revision and improvement of the provisional regulations on investigation of power production accidents that were issued . meanwhile , supplementary documents concerning dam safety for hydro - electric power stations and protection of secondary power systems will be released in succession for implementation this year .
in 2005 , electricity consumption by all sectors in china reached 2,468.9 gigawatt - hours , up 13.45 % year - on - year .
faced with adverse situations such as tightening power supply and demand , and increasing problems with coal , electricity , and oil transportation , various power producers took effective measures , stepping up management of infrastructure . in all of last year , throughout the country , no exceptionally large infrastructure accidents occurred in power production .
there were 74 grid accidents , down 127 cases year - on - year , and 427 infrastructure accidents , down 132 cases year - on - year .
south african minister plenipotentiary in china says no " organized " crimes against chinese citizens in south africa
xinhua news agency , beijing , feb. 13 ( correspondents wang jiangang and hao yalin ) minister plenipotentiary vusi b. koloane , charge d'affaires ad interim of the south african embassy in china , said in an exclusive xinhua interview on the 13th that there are no " organized " crimes against chinese citizens in south africa .
at the same time , he said that the south african government will try its best to " crack down on all forms of criminal activity . "
vusi b. koloane said that the south african government hopes to " reduce to zero " the crime rate and hopes that the life and property of every foreign national working in south africa will be fully protected by the local law and citizens .
since 2006 , four chinese citizens have already been killed one after another in south africa . chinese communities have shown widespread concern about this .
in response to this , the chinese foreign ministry has made representations to south africa and also reminded chinese citizens in south africa to further step up vigilance , enhance unity and friendship among chinese compatriots , and cooperate with police to jointly combat crime activities .
" we express our sincerest sympathy and condolences to the families of the victims . "
vusi b. koloane said : " we apologize for this and assure the chinese people that the south african government is earnestly investigating every single case involving chinese nationals . "
according to the chinese embassy in south africa , south african police have successfully cracked the february 5 case in which chen jianqing , a chinese woman from fujian , china , was killed in south africa . a suspect has been arrested .
at present police are after another suspect .
also , according to the disclosure by the south african embassy in china , the criminal involved in the shooting of a hong kong businessman in january of this year has been arrested by south african police , with the property of the victim recovered .
speaking of the impact that these incidents of chinese citizens being killed may have , vusi b. koloane thinks that the incidents " indeed " will have some negative impact on exchanges in trade , tourism , and other fields between the two countries , but the impact " should be fairly small " in the long run .
according to the briefing by nyembezi , tourism attache of the south african embassy , the embassy issued more than 2,000 visas to chinese nationals going to south africa in the first 15 days alone of this year .
in addition , according to the chinese official statistics , south africa continued to maintain its position as china 's largest trade partner in africa in 2005 .
the bilateral trade volume reached 7.27 billion us dollars , growing 23 % year - on - year .
however , tourism professionals think that the serial killings of chinese citizens in 2004 have significantly affected the number of chinese tourists to south africa .
according to the statistics of south africa 's tourism bureau , the number of chinese tourists to south africa in the first half of 2005 was 20,331 , a 14.9 % year - on - year decrease .
currently , some 200,000 chinese nationals live in towns and rural areas across south africa .
analysts here attribute the high crime rate to the large gap between the rich and the poor , high unemployment rate , rampant use of guns , and lack of death penalty in south africa .
as many chinese nationals do not understand english and have cash with them or in their homes , they are more likely to become targets of attack by criminals seeking their money .

the latest data provided by the ministry of public security on the 14th reveal that in 2002 and 2004 the ministry of public security successively issued the provisions on the implementation of detention measures and record - keeping by public security organs and the provisions on application of further interrogation by public security organs , which have more effectively ensured that grass - roots public security organs carry out detention and interrogation measures in accordance with applicable laws .
since 1997 , in order to further push for the " three rectifications " ( namely , rectify the extraction of confessions by torture , rectify the abuse of arms and police equipment , and rectify the abuse of coercive measures ) police supervisory personnel of public security organs nationwide have been persistently making open and secret trips to grass - roots and frontline law enforcement units such as police stations , criminal police teams , police patrol teams , traffic police teams , venues under the surveillance of public security organs , as well as scenes of law enforcement , to observe components of law enforcement involving citizens ' personal safety rights , to check for holes and remedy oversights , to give warnings and reminders , and to stop wrongdoings at the outset .
in order to prevent law enforcement problems where they originate , police supervisory departments have further broadened the scope of law enforcement supervision and stepped up supervision and inspection of components of law enforcement , such as the application of subpoena measures , inquiries and interrogations , 110 police call processing , statistics on case filings , disposal of assets involved in cases , security officers who ticket fines and penalties , and data recording of automobile thefts and robberies .

xinhua news agency , beijing , feb. 15 ( correspondents zhou wei and li fei ) at present , many websites rely on republishing large quantities of news reports from newspapers and magazines to increase their hit rates , but many are not authorized to do so and have not paid any fees . in response to this , wang ziqiang , director of the copyright division of the national copyright administration , said at a press conference held by the information office of the state council on the 15th that regarding the issue of paying for republishing works online , the information network publishing rights protection rules to be issued by the state council will provide the answers .

wang ziqiang said : " whether it will be included into the scope set forth by the law still needs to be confirmed by the information network publishing rights protection rules to be issued this year . "

kokoshin , chairman of the cis affairs committee of the russian state duma ( lower house of the parliament ) , noted this day in his speech about the georgian parliament resolution regarding the russian peacekeeping force that the georgian resolution will undermine stability in the region and adversely affect russian - georgian ties .
he stressed that the georgian parliament resolution has pushed the relations between russia and georgia further toward deterioration .
he thinks that georgia 's accusation against russia was absurd .
the georgian parliament passed the resolution this day , calling for the russian peacekeeping force to stop its peacekeeping mission in south ossetia but did not finalize the specific deadline for the withdrawal of the russian peacekeeping force .
the georgian parliament accused russian peacekeepers of failing to comply with specified obligations and considered russia 's operation in the conflict zone " an attempt to annex the territory of georgia . "
the georgian parliament called on the government to adopt proactive actions in considering the replacement of the current russian peacekeeping mission in the south ossetia conflict zone with an international peacekeeping force .
the georgian parliament also called on the government to amend the relevant agreement stipulating russian peacekeepers ' presence in the conflict zone .
south ossetia is an autonomous state of georgia , bordering the russian republic of north ossetia .
after the dissolution of the former soviet union , it announced independence by itself and has been in long - term hostility with the georgian central government .
at present , russia has a battalion of 500 peacekeepers stationed in the region .
this contingent was deployed in south ossetia according to a 1992 four - party agreement signed by russia , georgia , north ossetia , and south ossetia .

xinhua news agency , turin , feb. 17 news analysis : pyleva case likely to end where it is
xinhua correspondents gao peng and ding ying
although italy has said repeatedly that all athletes found using stimulants during the turin winter olympics may face " prison sentences , " based on various circumstances at this time , such fate is unlikely to happen to russian biathlete olga pyleva , the center of the first stimulant scandal at this winter olympics .
on the 16th , the first stimulant scandal broke out at the turin winter olympics when olga pyleva was found to have used carphedon , a banned drug .
the next day the international olympic committee announced that pyleva had been expelled from the winter olympics . in addition , she was stripped of the individual biathlon silver medal for women 's 15 km event she won at this winter olympics .
on the same day , the international biathlon union decided to give pyleva a two - year ban from the competition .
it has always been the ioc regulation that athletes found using stimulants at the olympic games be subject to revocation of their achievements and the eligibility to compete , but they are not subject to legal sanctions .
however , under italian law , athletes ' carrying and using stimulants are considered criminal acts . prosecution agencies have the right to directly arrest and investigate athletes on stimulants , and violators also face a prison sentence of between three months and three years .
in december last year , after " bargaining " for a year , the ioc and the italian government finally reached an agreement , under which the two sides will deal with cases of athletes using stimulants at this winter olympics in accordance with the italian law .
through the untiring efforts of the ioc , the italian side made concession four days before the winter olympics opened , promising that police would not enter the olympic village to raid athletes ' quarters during the winter olympics , but athletes tested positive for drugs are still subject to investigations of italian prosecutors .
some reports said that pescante , an italian government official supervising the turin winter olympics , has already turned over the case of pyleva using stimulant to turin 's prosecutors .
however , the ioc and pescante himself so far have not confirmed it yet .
russian biathlon team doctor andrey dmytriev disclosed at noon on the 17th that pyleva has already left turin for her country .
shi kangcheng , a chinese sports official who formerly worked at the world anti - doping agency for many years , thinks that once pyleva returns to her country , this incident may eventually " end where it is . "
shi kangcheng said that the ioc and the italian government have never " thoroughly resolved " the anti - stimulant issue at the winter olympics . even if the italian prosecution agency really gets involved in this case , the outcome is still hard to tell .
based on italy 's penalties on its own athletes in the previous cases of stimulant abuse , the maximum penalties violators got were only " two - year deferred imprisonment . "
therefore , piaili , a senior reporter from the italian news agency ansa , said that there is " little " chance that pyleva will go to jail . she would just face fines at maximum .
piaili also said that although the italian court can hold a trial in absentia , the italian police will not be able to go abroad to catch pyleva and bring her back for serving the sentence .
if pyleva refuses to accept the judgment , the italian side will not be able to do anything to her .
