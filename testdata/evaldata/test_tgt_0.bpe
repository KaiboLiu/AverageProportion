difficulty in reaching agreement in dispute over territorial waters , military meeting between the two kore@@ as breaks up in dis@@ cor@@ d
a three - day high - level military meeting between north and south korea broke up in dis@@ cor@@ d today , because both sides were im@@ mo@@ v@@ able on the drawing of maritime borders .
the talks , held in the border city of pan@@ mun@@ jo@@ m , entered the final day of negotiation today . north korea 's chief representative lieutenant - general kim yong - ch@@ ol ( transliterated ) said : " we 've come to the conclusion that we do n't need these fru@@ it@@ less talks any more . "
red - faced and with an obviously dis@@ pleased expression , kim yong - ch@@ ol criticized south korea for inten@@ tionally avoiding discussions on drawing a new maritime border to replace the original " northern limit line . "
he alleged that the " northern limit line " was not legal .
the " northern limit line , " located in the yellow sea , was set by the american military in 19@@ 53 after the end of the korean war . however , in recent years it has become a focus of dispute between the two kore@@ as , and north korea has further refused to recognize it .
north korea says that south korean warships have illegally inv@@ aded these waters , causing tension . south korea calls this accus@@ ation ground@@ less .
conflict broke out in local waters in june , 1999 , causing the deaths of dozens of north korean s@@ ail@@ ors .

us treasury secretary arri@@ ves on visit to china ; environmental protection and exchange rates are foc@@ uses of concern
us treasury secretary pa@@ ul@@ son arrived yesterday on a visit to china . the us is currently doing all it can to persu@@ ade china to carry out further necessary economic reforms and work on environmental protection . the renminbi exchange rate is an issue that will receive particular attention .
us diplom@@ ats say that pa@@ ul@@ son first visited xin@@ ing , capital city of china 's large north@@ western province of qinghai .
china is currently carrying out a series of plans for environmental protection near the largest fre@@ sh@@ water la@@ ke in qinghai province .
today pa@@ ul@@ son will move on to beijing to discuss pushing for progress in the us - china strategic economic dialogue started last year and other issues with chinese chief officials .
the us - china strategic economic dialogue mainly discus@@ ses economic , environmental protection and other issues . yet , the most important is the issue of the renminbi exchange rate . us congressmen believe that the renminbi is exc@@ essively under@@ valued .
the trade deficit between the us and china is quickly escal@@ ating . internal pressure within the us is gradually rising , and congressmen are ready to take re@@ tribu@@ tive action to resist what they call china 's unfair trade policies .
last week the us senate finance committee overwhel@@ ming@@ ly approved a bill requiring the treasury to identify a list of countries with " fundamentally mis@@ al@@ ig@@ ned " currency exchange rates . this opens the door for potential economic sanctions to be brought against beijing .
us congressmen say that the renminbi is under@@ valued , which makes the price of goods that china sel@@ ls to the us extremely che@@ ap , and adds to the trade im@@ balance between the us and china . last year the us 's trade deficit with china reached 23@@ 2.5 billion us dollars .

experts think insurance q@@ di@@ is will not diver@@ t funds away from domestic stock market in the short term
chin@@ an@@ e@@ w@@ s@@ .@@ com , july 30
according to a report in china securities jour@@ nal , the provisional measure for the overseas investment with insurance funds was recently published , and insurance funding has greater room for operation in the capital markets .
china life insurance company 's chief investment officer liu le@@ fei thinks that with the renminbi appreciation and the domestic capital markets improving , insurance institutions will not make large investments overseas through foreign currency purchases in the short term . this also means that insurance q@@ di@@ is will not diver@@ t funds away from the domestic stock market in the short term .
the report says that quite a few insurance institutions hold the same view .
experts say that because there is currently no renminbi der@@ i@@ v@@ atives market as yet , and the risk - avo@@ id@@ ance techniques of insurance institutions are not sufficient , the time is not yet ri@@ pe for large - scale foreign currency purchases .
liu le@@ fei says that in the long term , in terms of asset allocation , overseas investment should occupy a certain proportion of an insurance company 's overall allocation .
however , given the fairly large up@@ wards pressure on the renminbi at present , china life would mainly be using its own funds in foreign currencies for making overseas investment .
in the current situation it should take a cautious attitude toward purchasing foreign currencies to invest overseas .

according to reports in taiwan 's united daily , chen shui - bian questi@@ oned on the 30@@ th that for political reasons or electoral considerations , judges , prosecu@@ tors or investig@@ ators may be interfering with , affecting or even trying to control the campaign activities of candidates from all parties . he said he hoped that this kind of phenomenon did not exist in taiwan , but that it was perhaps extremely difficult .

germany plans to lower thre@@ sh@@ old for bringing in professionals
staff writ@@ er , ber@@ lin , july 1 ( correspon@@ dent wang huaicheng )
german federal minister of education and research sch@@ av@@ an said recently that germany should lower the quali@@ fying conditions for bringing in foreign professionals in the immigration law and solve the problem of the shortage of professionals that germany is facing through increasing the recruitment of foreign talents .
according to a report by o@@ ec@@ d , by 2010 the number of workers between age 15 and 64 in germany will be gradually decreas@@ ing each year .
if there are not enough immigrants , the labor force in germany in 20@@ 20 will decrease by 6 % as compared with the present .
however , reports by organizations such as the german employers association and the german association of engine@@ ers show that there is a relatively large shortage of engine@@ ers and professionals in the current job market in germany .
according to the statistics from germany 's federal labor department , this may , the supply of engine@@ ers in the labor market in germany had a short@@ fall of about 1@@ 2,@@ 700 people and the supply of technicians had a short@@ fall of about 9@@ ,@@ 600 people .
in order to protect native employment , germany has set a relatively high thre@@ sh@@ old for bringing in foreign talents .
germany 's immigration law stipulates that professionals from non - eu countries should have annual salaries of no less than 8@@ 5,@@ 500 euro@@ s in germany , otherwise they cannot get the permit to work and live in germany .
sch@@ av@@ an sugge@@ sts that this quali@@ fying amount be reduced to 4@@ 0,000 to 6@@ 0,000 euro@@ s .
do n't blin@@ dly wor@@ ship legal " theory circle "
it is stipulated in article 8 of the draft amendment of the lawyers law which has been recently submitted to the npc standing committee for review that people who were once engaged in the profession of resear@@ ching and teaching laws and have obtained advanced professional ti@@ t@@ les or equivalent professional levels may be granted the permission to practice law when their applications for lawyers ' licen@@ ses pass the review by the judicial administrative department of the state council .
( june 28 , the china youth daily )
in the legal community there is a distinc@@ tion between the " theory circle " and the " practice circle . " the former mainly includes the " ab@@ str@@ act activities " such as teaching and resear@@ ching laws , while the latter is more engaged in the " concrete activities " such as liti@@ gation , legal coun@@ sel@@ ing , and legal services .
for a long time there has exist@@ ed a phenomenon of " scholars ' mutual cont@@ emp@@ t " between the legal " theory circle " and the " practice circle . " the " theory circle " believes that the " practice circle " lacks the necessary legal training and consists only of mechanical " leg@@ alists , " while the " practice circle " critici@@ zes the " theory circle " by pointing out that " theory cannot direct practice . "
with regard to such a labor division , what the law can do is to maintain neutr@@ ality rather than vigorously support either party .
however , the " system of specially licensed lawyers " in the lawyers law acknowle@@ dges in reality the judgment that the legal " theory circle " is superior to the legal " practice circle . "
in fact , some experts and scholars who have been engaged in the research and teaching of p@@ ure legal theories such as the history of the legal system and the international laws have nothing to do with practicing law no matter how profound their theoretical achievements have been .
thus , the " system of specially licensed lawyers " has doub@@ t@@ lessly opened up a " bad lo@@ op@@ hol@@ e " for conf@@ using quali@@ fication in the legal " practice circle " which will have an extremely negative impact .
there is also more blind wor@@ ship of the " theory circle " than these . for example , the phenomenon that expert opinions and expert pan@@ els frequently influence and even neg@@ ate court rul@@ ings is also a direct manife@@ station of such blind wor@@ ship .

keep public places from har@@ ass@@ ment of pe@@ d@@ d@@ lers
when people go out travel@@ ing , they are looking for relaxation , fre@@ sh@@ ness , and freedom , enjoying as much as possible the natural scen@@ ery and achievements of civilized society .
however , while travel@@ ing in the country , many people have experienced such nu@@ is@@ ance as being bes@@ i@@ eg@@ ed and cor@@ ne@@ red by pe@@ d@@ d@@ lers and mid@@ d@@ le@@ men in public places .
whether you are getting on or off a bus or train , you inv@@ ari@@ ably suffer the har@@ ass@@ ment of pe@@ d@@ d@@ lers and some unlicensed mid@@ d@@ le@@ men .
they either sell chick@@ en eg@@ gs , pe@@ an@@ u@@ ts , or s@@ es@@ ame se@@ ed ca@@ kes , or newspapers and magaz@@ ines . in addition , many unlicensed mid@@ d@@ le@@ men make refer@@ r@@ als to restaurants and lo@@ d@@ g@@ ings , even haw@@ king fake certificates , fake receipts , and so on .
if you do n't take them , he can ch@@ ase you for several hundreds of meters as if he would rather die than fail .
in some scen@@ ic spots , many tourists also have the same experience .
before you enter the main gate , someone would come to haw@@ k things like tourist souven@@ irs and small pieces of arts and cr@@ af@@ ts .
there are more scen@@ ari@@ os of this kind after you go through the gate , which completely ru@@ ins even your best mo@@ od .
some media once reported that many foreign tourists coming to xi@@ '@@ an praised end@@ lessly the places of historic interest and scen@@ ic be@@ au@@ ty in xi@@ '@@ an , but felt it was in@@ comprehen@@ sible that crow@@ ds of pe@@ d@@ d@@ lers are allowed to haw@@ k their wa@@ res everywhere .
such public places including bus stations and scen@@ ic spots are places meant for travel@@ ing and recreation . attention should be paid to ci@@ v@@ ility and ord@@ er@@ liness as well as tran@@ qu@@ ility and harmony , providing tourists a comfor@@ table and rela@@ xing environment .
the un@@ restricted entry and exit of pe@@ d@@ d@@ lers not only distur@@ b the mo@@ od of tourists , but also actually destroy the public order of these public places , giving rise to the visual contam@@ ination and environmental contam@@ ination , while providing the conditions and opportunities for law@@ less people to make trouble .
the important thing is that these public places are the win@@ dow@@ s of spiritual civilization construction in the local areas . a small g@@ li@@ mp@@ se can reve@@ al a larger picture . not only the image is being damaged but the growth of local economy will also be imp@@ acted .
just imag@@ ine , if you want to expand and strengthen the tourism industry but welcome guests travel@@ ing from all directions with such a mess@@ y tourist environment , who will still want to come , and who still dare to come ?
then how can your tourist economy gain returns ?
as the tourist high season appro@@ aches , creating a civilized tourist environment for tourists coming from all directions should be considered the top priority .
public places are not markets . the operation by pe@@ d@@ d@@ lers should be regul@@ ated . unlicensed operation must be resolutely banned , and there should be rel@@ ent@@ less crackdown on illegal activities .
only a civilized and orderly environment can get tourists to come happ@@ ily , who will leave after fully enjoying themselves and keep the pas@@ sion for a return trip .
in a word , keep public places from the har@@ ass@@ ment of pe@@ d@@ d@@ lers .
" re@@ war@@ ding voluntary withdrawal from welfare system " does not hold water
the ji@@ angu@@ om@@ en neighbor@@ hood in dong@@ cheng district of beijing gave away things like re@@ fri@@ ger@@ ators as re@@ wards to tw@@ el@@ ve households that volun@@ tar@@ ily with@@ drew from the welfare system .
( the beijing news , july 10 )
while feeling happy for these families for the improvement of their lives , this writ@@ er is am@@ bi@@ valent toward the proposal of " voluntary withdrawal from the welfare system " and the " reward - giving " method .
the deputy director of the ji@@ angu@@ om@@ en neighbor@@ hood office said , " in response to the issue of the welfare fraud , encouraging voluntary withdrawal from the welfare system aims to set a good example for other households on welfare . "
if it is to encourage other welfare recipients to get out of their difficult situations through their own efforts , then this example is indeed worth promoting . if this is intended to " appeal " to those long@@ time che@@ at@@ ers of the welfare system , then it may be a bit n@@ ai@@ ve .
working to distingu@@ ish between real and fake welfare recipients and sort them out , we should rely more on the law .
the relevant department should stress the obligations that welfare recipients must carry out while enjoying the welfare : for example , promptly noti@@ fying the changes in the family members and incomes , reporting the status of employment , accepting regular re@@ views , etc. on the other hand , the relevant department should step up monitoring and inspection .
after all , only " with@@ drawing from the welfare system according to the law " is the long - term strategy .
who will foot the bill for the material re@@ wards given by the neighbor@@ hood to the households that with@@ drew from the welfare system ?
as a level - one government organization , the neighbor@@ hood 's expenses are covered by the funding from the government budget .
however , is it legitimate to spend this sum of tax payers ' money ?
on the one hand , households that have with@@ drawn from the welfare system prove that they have attained certain abilities to be " self - sufficient ; " on the other hand , are n't there still people who apply for the welfare ?
the funding from the government budget which is called " life - saving " money should be used to provide timely help instead of extra bon@@ us .
liu gang@@ yi 's remark about his willingness to be a service provi@@ der is more believ@@ able
on july 10 , liu gang@@ yi , the party committee secretary of mul@@ an township , xin@@ du district , chengdu city , who is the first township party committee secretary through public nomination and direct election in the whole country , received his fourth democratic evaluation since he took office . the rate of satisfaction reached 97 % .
during his conversation with reporters , liu gang@@ yi defined himself as a " service provi@@ der . "
( yesterday , the beijing news )
the " service provi@@ der " as spok@@ en by liu gang@@ yi is probably more tru@@ th@@ ful and more believ@@ able than the " service provi@@ der " as spok@@ en by some appointed cadres .
the greatest advantage of public nomination and direct election as compared with the system of appointment lies in the fact that in the former the source of power is mainly determined by ordinary party members and the masses , while in the latter it is mainly appointed by upper - level organizations . and where the power origin@@ ates determin@@ es that the former must take its responsibility to the general public as top priority .
the source of power and to whom they should answer are the basic factors that determine how the elected will go about their work .
some people suspect that this kind of " democratic evaluation " is more like a " democracy show . "
my opinion is that it is better to have this form of " democratic evaluation " than nothing at all .
considering the history and current status of china 's grassroots democratic and political construction , i think that it is already a major breakthrough to have public nomination and direction election . being a major component of this innovation , the democratic evaluation is not to be unde@@ res@@ tim@@ ated in promoting the grassroots democratic and political construction .

in addition she is devoted to the social welfare and is the hon@@ or@@ ary chair@@ person of many cultural , educational , and social welfare organizations .

but in june this year , commander cr@@ ad@@ doc@@ k of the us army headquarters in europe submitted a report to the current secretary of defense , gates , raising doubts over the above - mentioned reduction plan .
the report said that while us army forces are being reduced in europe , many military units would be deployed on a ro@@ tation basis to iraq and afghanistan for combat , leading to a short@@ fall in us troops in europe to such an extent that there would be no way to develop normal cooperation with european allies .

three main functions of modern military uniform
the first is the identification function .
it is an important sign that distingu@@ ishes the armies of different countries , different military services , and between the military and civilians .
in the armies of more than 100 large and small countries of the world , although the use of military uniform is basically identical , there are no two countries ' armies whose military uni@@ forms are completely the same .
the second is the sym@@ bol@@ ic function .
to a certain extent , military uniform is both a reflec@@ tion of a country 's mental outlook and its national characteristics , and is also a concentrated embo@@ di@@ ment of a country 's military ability to wage war and the quality of its servicemen .
in the three main types of military uniform -- cere@@ mon@@ ial at@@ ti@@ re , every@@ day uni@@ forms , and drill uni@@ forms -- the one that can express national prestige and military prestige to the ful@@ l@@ est extent is none other than cere@@ mon@@ ial at@@ ti@@ re that is well - pressed and ple@@ asing to the eye .
the third is the protective function .
with the rapid development of high - tech and updated weaponry , improving the overall protective capacity of new - style drill uni@@ forms to give military uniform various types of functions -- including bul@@ let@@ pro@@ of@@ ing , ste@@ al@@ th protection , anti - chemical , anti - b@@ ac@@ ter@@ ial and anti - radi@@ ation functions , as well as control of the temperature , hu@@ mid@@ ity and the air -- has become a key issue in the development of military uniform .

over the past few years , along with the replacement of personnel , an excessive part of the brigade 's accommod@@ ation for family members had been occupied against regulations , making it difficult to house the cadres on active duty . officers and men had quite strong views about this .
the brigade had tried to free up the a@@ part@@ ments several times , but failed to get it done each time due to all kinds of obstruc@@ tion , allowing the problem to become a long - standing , big and difficult issue .
" as long as we have the courage to do things properly and are fair and reasonable , there are no difficulties we cannot solve . "
after the group on the new party committee had reached a consensus , the principal leaders appeared in person and set about thoroughly sor@@ ting out all the problems relating to occupation of a@@ part@@ ments against regulations .
on the one hand they appealed to people 's emo@@ tions and explained their reas@@ oning , hoping that the personnel concerned would consider the whole picture ; on the other hand , they explained the policies and regulations relating to military a@@ part@@ ments , a@@ part@@ ments built with po@@ ol@@ ed money , and econom@@ ical and adequate a@@ part@@ ments , to show the party committee 's sta@@ un@@ ch determination and principled stance .
in the case of personnel who had accommod@@ ation el@@ se@@ where and were not willing to leave the additional a@@ part@@ ments they occupied , the party committee organ promptly made contact with the work units they were in and adopted relevant measures to encourage them to take the initiative in cooper@@ ating with the work of the army .
over two months of meticulous work , all residents occup@@ ying additional a@@ part@@ ments in the army bar@@ r@@ acks against regulations had all moved out on schedule , and cadres who worked in the brigade were all assigned the accommod@@ ation in accordance with regulations .
the way in which this brigade party committee d@@ ared to con@@ front tough obstacles has also given rise to a chain reaction . several cadres who originally were unwilling to actively cooperate with the organization 's al@@ lo@@ tment have now one by one also expressed their willingness to obe@@ y the organization 's decisions .

people 's armed force department in jing@@ jiang city sets up a platform to raise the quality of their full - time cadres
staff writ@@ er , report by cao jia@@ wei and zhu chun@@ bin : on june 18 , at a training class for people 's armed force full - time cadres in jing@@ jiang city in jiangsu province , lu yu@@ qing , leader of the people 's armed force department of x@@ il@@ ai township , delivered a training lecture " winning a psychological war under information@@ alized conditions " that received a unanim@@ ous favorable assessment from the trainees .
this was a new change that was brought about by the city 's people 's armed force when it has put more pressure on its cadres based on the reality of their positions in an effort to raise people 's armed force cadres ' comprehensive quality .
at the beginning of this year , the people 's armed force party committee discovered during investigation and research at the grassroots level that some of the people 's armed force cadres had served for a long time , had too many con@@ current duties , and had not put their chief ener@@ gies into the armed force work .
for this reason , they have adopted methods including centralized training , replac@@ ing training with meetings , and relying on local party schools to conduct training , thus regularly training military cadres , in an effort to resolve problems such as the narrow knowledge base and the uniform focus of the professional quality of military cadres .
in combination with the central work , they bol@@ dly assign tasks to military cadres and put more pressure on them , and raise their performance by on - the - job training .
at the same time , they have actively coordinated with local organizational departments and jointly draf@@ ted the " people 's armed forces cadres ' competition for jobs scheme , " and explicitly stipulated that the leaders of people 's armed forces departments must join the party committee of the same level and cannot concurrently take on other jobs .
they have set up a military cadres ' restructuring exchange mechanism to promptly regulate exchanges on some older military cadres who are not suitable for grassroots people 's armed forces work , and promote and use some comrades of good comprehensive quality and strong work ability .
not long ago , a domestic gap was filled by the under@@ water boat - wel@@ ding technology inv@@ ented and developed by the people 's militi@@ a technology plat@@ o@@ on under the leadership of the secretary of the armed department of the new century ship@@ building company limited , chen y@@ is@@ ong , who was excep@@ tionally promoted as the company 's armed department leader .
when you start well , you still need to fin@@ ish well
judging simply from the result of the match , 2@@ -@@ 2 seems a reasonable score , and is also one that the chinese team can accept . the key problem is that the way the match went made people feel it was rather a p@@ ity .
if the iranian team had taken a 2@@ -@@ 0 lead , then the chinese team had ev@@ ened up the score , then the feeling that would have given china 's sports fans would certainly have been different . it would have boo@@ sted morale . the p@@ ity was that the situation was precisely the opposite .
you could say that starting well but being unable to fin@@ ish well is an old problem of the chinese team .
the chinese team often do n't k@@ ick the ball when they have an excellent chance , and most people 's view is that the psychological quality of china 's players is not really up to it .
this is actually one reason why the chinese team cannot " fin@@ ish well . "
however , judging by the chinese team 's match today , it may not be quite so .
even if we set aside the fact that sun ji@@ hai , sun xiang , sh@@ ao ji@@ ay@@ i , zheng zhi and others have played in europe , li wei@@ feng and others are also old - tim@@ ers with long experience of the battlefield . they have experience and knowledge , and so it would be reasonable to say that there should not be any problem with their psychological quality .
the reason why the chinese team was regre@@ tt@@ ably forced to a draw by the iranian team this time may be because they deployed their forces in a l@@ ack@@ ad@@ a@@ is@@ ical manner at key points of the match .
when the iranian team were behind , they sub@@ stitu@@ ted two persons , and the scene immediately seemed different .
in the second half , the chinese team also sub@@ stitu@@ ted three players , but without a positive effect .
to overcome the problem of starting well but being unable to fin@@ ish well , it is definitely necessary to pin@@ point the source of the problem .
as long as the problem is correctly gras@@ ped , it will probably not be difficult to find a way to get rid of the problem .
the worst thing when you have a serious illness is just to go to see any doctor .
if they carry on like this , no matter how many mat@@ ches the chinese team play , the old problem will still continue , and the constant progress with every game that everyone expec@@ ts will be out of the question .

" small , sc@@ attered , far and direct " education coordination zones go into operation in a second artillery unit base
staff writ@@ er , report by x@@ ue bing@@ jian and correspon@@ dent xu ye@@ qing : the situation in the " small , sc@@ attered , far and direct " units where education organization is difficult , resources are me@@ ag@@ er , and each f@@ ends for itself , will become history at a second artillery unit base .
this correspon@@ dent learned recently that following a half - year pilot project , this base has handed down " the method of fully implementing ' an outline for ideological and political education ' . " a number of ideological and political education coordination zones covering all the " small , sc@@ attered , far and direct " units in the base have officially been brought into operation .
in order to push ahead with the effective implementation of " an outline for ideological and political education , " the base organized resources at the beginning of the year to conduct in - depth investigation and research of the ideological and political education situation in " small , sc@@ attered , far and direct " units . they comb@@ ed through important issues that influence and re@@ strict the education time , personnel and results , and initially established this new - style education model of coordination zones for the " small , sc@@ attered , far and direct " units .
the concrete approach of coordination zones is to break down the organizational bound@@ aries among units and set up a brigade and regiment - level unit to take the lead in the areas where the " small , sc@@ attered , far and direct " units are relatively concentrated , and conduct an integrated program for them@@ atic education , with units falling under different hi@@ er@@ arch@@ ies coming together in nearby places for lec@@ tures or using the help of video link - up systems for remote discussions .
they have adopted a method that integr@@ ates taking turns in giving lessons and compe@@ ting for posts , and unifying the allocation of educational resources . in each area the use of educational hard@@ ware will be integrated , and each unit 's materials , data and educational experiences will be shared and exchanged with those of others , with regular organization in each area of typical tour reports and exchanges of what they got from the study by the officers and men .
every coordination zone has set up a devoted educational liaison person and a part - time educational information ga@@ there@@ r .
on this basis , each coordination zone has also set up systems for seeking assistance on difficult issues , holding joint discussions on major educational themes , reporting critical ideological situations , and assess@@ ing tests and evalu@@ ations .
zhang sheng@@ min , the director of the base 's political department , told this correspon@@ dent that constructing political education coordination zones has both reduced the waste of educational resources and deepened the impact of education .
some political instruc@@ tors fear they will lose marks in front of officers and men from other units and have taken the initiative to study new things and seek new educational methods .
the officers and men receiving the education have also enthusiastically di@@ ge@@ sted the educational content , out of concern over expressing themselves in lay@@ man 's language in front of the officers and men of friendly neighboring units during discussion and analysis .
in this way , the enthusiasm of the people giving and receiving education has been both effectively stimul@@ ated .

report by wang wei@@ qin and specially contracted correspon@@ dent li de@@ ying : on july 25 , this writ@@ er observed in a service support company of the ji@@ '@@ nan military command that inv@@ it@@ ations for an army engineering tender , details of financial expenditure , promo@@ tions of cadres , non - commissioned officers being admitted to the party and other major matters were written up on a bul@@ le@@ tin board , and hung up conspic@@ u@@ ously in a display cabinet .
as political commissar su cheng@@ sen explained , this is a concrete measure adopted by the section to promote a system where things are done openly .
at the beginning of this year , the unit party committee drew up measures including " two - way supervision between the organization and the grassroots " and " public@@ izing sensitive issues " to strengthen the construction of the party spirit and honest government , requiring that for all significant issues that involve the direct interests of the officers and men and army development , the opinions of grassroots officers and men are first heard before decisions are reached , and that standards , procedures , and results et@@ c of the handling of the matters are made public from start to fin@@ ish in line with the circumstances .
the unit has installed a suggestion box and a bul@@ le@@ tin board , and has opened a " message board " on its in@@ tran@@ et to collect everyone 's views and recommendations in an extensive way .
at the beginning of the year , as the renovation project of the soldiers ' bar@@ r@@ acks was about to start , before the work began , the party committee organ extensively solic@@ ited the views of the officers and men , and then released the information on inviting bi@@ ds , implementing a system of open tend@@ ers .
this both sav@@ ed money and won the support of the officers and men .
doing things in an open and fair way has driven the formation of a good atmosphere at the grassroots .
in this unit , the grassroots company insi@@ sts on making regular public announc@@ ements and notices , no matter whether they are issues as big as the determination of " hot - bu@@ tton " sensitive matters , or as tri@@ vi@@ al as personal vac@@ ations to visit relatives or daily income and expenditure in the m@@ ess accounts , thus taking the initiative to receive the supervision of the masses .
( international ) research shows a link between ar@@ r@@ hy@@ th@@ m@@ ia and two forms of gene@@ tic vari@@ ation
xinhua news agency , london , july 2 ic@@ el@@ an@@ di@@ c scientists have discovered through research that the risk of ar@@ r@@ hy@@ th@@ m@@ ia among people with two types of gene@@ tic vari@@ ation in their bodies is far greater than among ordinary people .

the two gen@@ es discovered by the scientists are located close to a gen@@ e that plays an important role in the early growth of the heart .
ar@@ r@@ hy@@ th@@ m@@ ia , namely atri@@ al fi@@ br@@ ill@@ ation , is one of the most common clin@@ ically observed ir@@ regular@@ ities of the r@@ hy@@ th@@ m of the heart , and can lead to heart pal@@ pit@@ ations , short@@ ness of bre@@ ath , ti@@ re@@ dness as well as ap@@ op@@ lec@@ tic f@@ its .

xinhua news agency , mar@@ ac@@ ai@@ bo ( venezu@@ ela ) july 3 ( correspon@@ dent liu jian )
according to a report in the venezu@@ el@@ an media on the 3@@ rd , the us team 's 37 - year - old veteran go@@ al@@ ke@@ ep@@ er , k@@ ell@@ er , said during an interview here that if he could not find a suitable club to serve in after the america 's cup , then he would op@@ t to reti@@ re .
" if i have not been able to get a contract for 1@@ -@@ 2 seas@@ ons with a high - quality league team within four to six weeks of the conclusion of the america 's cup , then may@@ be reti@@ ring will not be a bad choice for me . "
with the re@@ leg@@ ation of the m@@ ö@@ cheng@@ lad@@ b@@ ach team to the 2@@ nd b@@ und@@ es@@ lig@@ a , k@@ ell@@ er also left this soccer team in which he had served for more than two seas@@ ons .
although k@@ ell@@ er has a mind to reti@@ re , he has many opportunities and clearly need not worry about finding a place . he himself has frank@@ ly stated that there are currently as many as eight soccer teams that are interested in inviting him to join them .
however , this veteran go@@ al@@ ke@@ ep@@ er who has served in league mat@@ ches for the sp@@ anish pri@@ mer@@ a lig@@ a , the english premi@@ ership , and the german b@@ und@@ es@@ lig@@ a , said that what he ultimately choo@@ ses to do will be decided by his family . " my k@@ id is already 9 years old . he has followed me around and stayed in three different countries , and has been to three different schools , and so i need to consider in my current choice what would be better for my family . "
in the gold cup competition that was concluded not long ago , k@@ ell@@ er put in an outstanding performance , helping the us team to win the title .
in the current america 's cup , he has , just as before , been given an important job to do by head co@@ ach br@@ ad@@ ley , but he clearly cannot win the match sing@@ le@@ handed . the us team , made up of " young guards , " is no match for such strong south american oppon@@ ents as argentina and par@@ agu@@ ay , and during these two mat@@ ches the goal he guar@@ ded was b@@ reached seven times .
the next match against colom@@ bia will probably be the us team 's and k@@ ell@@ er 's last performance in this america 's cup competition .
