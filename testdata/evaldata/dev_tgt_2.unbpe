two laptops containing information on princess diana death investigation stolen
london , the 6th ( afp )
london 's daily express has reported that two laptop computers containing material on the probe into princess diana 's fatal car crash in paris in 1997 have been stolen from the office of a former metropolitan police commissioner .
the report says the theft has given rise to conjecture that the computers may contain confidential material from the investigation headed by former metropolitan police commissioner lord stevens .
however , a spokeswoman for the metropolitan police said the computers did not contain any sensitive information or any material linked to the probe .
lord stevens is the chief constable of northumbria police in england . his office is located in newcastle upon tyne .
the report said detectives with the northumbria police have been investigating two burglaries in the last ten days .
the first took place on the weekend of january 28 to 29 when the computers and cash were taken . the second burglary took place last week , but without any loss .
northumbria police also said there was no evidence that the two break - ins were linked to lord stevens ' work .
stevens has been investigating if the princess of wales ' death was not the result of a straightforward car accident .
in 2004 , royal coroner burgess ordered further investigation into related evidence .
princess diana died in a car crash in a paris tunnel on august 31 , 1997 . her lover , fayed , and a chauffeur were also killed .
a two - year investigation by french police concluded that the tragedy resulted because the chauffeur , who was drunk and taking prescription drugs , was driving too fast and lost control .

colombo , the 7th ( afp )
peace broker norway says the parties to the conflict in sri lanka have agreed to hold talks in geneva on february 22 , ending a three - year deadlock in negotiations seeking to bring a close to decades of bloody ethnic conflict .

the norwegian embassy here said in a statement , " the parties to the conflict in sri lanka , the government of sri lanka and the liberation tigers of tamil eelam , have asked norway to facilitate talks in geneva from february 22 to 23. "
the two - day talks will focus on strengthening a ceasefire that went into effect on february 23 , 2002 . the ceasefire has not been fully respected by either party .
the norwegian embassy said , " the two parties will discuss how to improve the implementation of the ceasefire agreement . this is also the first time in three years that the parties have negotiated face - to - face at such a high level . "
solheim said he will lead norway 's team at the talks . the four delegates of the liberation tigers of tamil eelam will be led by balasingham and the delegation of the sri lankan government will be led by the health minister .
he said , " this is a small but important step on the road to peace . we expect the negotiations to be tough . "
the last face - to - face talks on solving the sri lankan ethic conflict were held in japan in march 2003 , but the liberation tigers of tamil eelam cancelled what would have been the seventh round of negotiations scheduled in thailand in april .

brussels , the 16th ( afp )
the unrelenting advance of bird flu across europe is causing anxiety among the public .
the european commission ( ec ) approved the establishment of " buffer zones " which would cover entire areas of infected countries and in which trade and transport of poultry products would be prohibited .
in africa , where the lethal h 5n1 strain of the virus was discovered eight days ago in nigeria , the disease has continued spread to more poultry farms and showed signs of having crossed the northern border into niger .
egyptian officials are also investigating the sudden unexplained death of a batch of chickens in a poultry farm , raising concerns that the virus may continue to spread .
the virus has influenced europe 's poultry markets , where sales have plummeted . the european commission reiterated that there was no need for panic .
eu health and food commissioner , kyprianou , said , " it is understandable that the public is concerned , but they need not be unduly alarmed . "
following provisions for three - kilometer protection zones and ten - kilometer surveillance zones around virus outbreak points , the european commission also issued a regulation that will turn entire regions where the virus is found into " buffer zones " .
an eu official wishing to remain anonymous said that everybody was very tense and that from morning to night they were handling news coming in from areas all over europe where it was suspected that the epidemic had erupted .
in europe , traces of the h 5n1 virus have already appeared in austria , bulgaria , croatia , germany , greece , italy , romania , slovenia , ukraine and the european part of russia . almost all cases have appeared in wild swans .
romania discovered its thirty - first case on the 16th . new cases have also been discovered in slovenia , austria and greece , as well as on the german island of ruegan .
the bird flu virus was found on the bodies of two ducks in southern italy , the first animals in europe other than swans to be infected with the h 5n1 virus .
eu officials are now worried about the return of migrating birds from africa .
the nigerian government has revved up its drive to stop the african continent 's virus from spreading to humans .
the nigerian government announced that all birds found within a five - kilometer radius of infected poultry farms would be culled regardless of whether they had been threatened by bird flu .
authorities in neighboring niger announced a state of alert and a four - million - dollar emergency plan to monitor the border with nigeria .

china 's new e-banking regulations take effect march 1
beijing , february 6 ( xinhua ) ( reporter : han jie , xu bo ) reporters were informed on the 6th by the china banking regulatory commission ( cbrc ) that two rules recently issued by the cbrc -- the electronic banking administration measures and the electronic banking security assessment guide -- will take effect on march 1 , 2006 .
a cbrc spokesman said that according to provisions of the administration measures , the examination and authorization method for foreign - capital financial institutions remains essentially unchanged . namely , if foreign bank branches that have already been authorized to open online banking services need to add additional online banking products , their primary reporting bank must submit a consolidated application .
, in june 2001 , the china people 's bank promulgated the interim measures for the administration of online banking operations to standardize use of the internet by commercial banks in developing banking services .
a cbrc spokesman said that with the continuous development of the online banking operations of commercial banks , the interim measures no longer answered the need for supervision and control of risks in online banking . for this reason , the cbrc enacted the two new regulations .
according to the cbrc spokesman , the cbrc 's approval of the qualifications of security assessment organizations is different from the administrative approval of qualifications for industry access or market access . it is not a prerequisite for assessment organizations developing electronic banking security assessment services , but is instead only a reference for financial institutions choosing an assessment organization .
financial institutions can hire a security assessment organization to perform e-banking security assessments as long as the assessment organization complies with relevant conditions and requirements , even if its qualifications have not undergone cbrc approval . assessments must however be supervised in accordance with relevant regulations .
the electronic banking administration measures are divided into 99 items under nine chapters covering general principles , application and change of registration , risk management , management of information exchange and transfer , supervision of out - sourcing , supervision of trans - national business , oversight and administration , legal liability and supplementary provisions .
the electronic banking security assessment guide is divided into 57 items under five chapters , covering general principles , security assessment organizations , implementation of security assessments , administration of security assessment activity and supplementary provisions .

according to feng yang , president of the free state chinese association , the incident occurred in a bar in the city of welkom , 130km northwest of bloemfontein .
at the time , the bar - owner lin yixing was behind the bar counter tidying some articles in preparation to end the business day .

( newspaper excerpt ) shanghai : part - timers and university grads become main source of hourly workers .
beijing , feb. 7 ( xinhua ) the shanghai bureau of labor and social security released on the 6th the " 2006 most recent guidance for hourly wages " . it covers 120 kinds of positions -- 11 more than the last edition -- and reveals that wages for certain positions previously covered have risen in some cases and fallen in others .
according to estimates by experts at the shanghai bureau of labor and social security , the number of hourly workers now exceeds one million .
china youth daily has reported that university graduates and part - timers are the main source of hourly workers .
results of a direct survey of nearly 8000 hourly workers show that more than half are part - timers , with the percentage reaching 51.1 % .
the educational level of these part - timers is generally high , with most engaged in highly technical labor such as translation work , in which part - timers make up 81.7 % of the manpower . in the fitness industry , they occupy up to 61.6 % of the positions .
high income is one of the main reasons many people do hourly part - time work .
according to sources , the monthly income from some positions can be in the tens of thousands of yuan with manpower still being in short supply . simultaneous interpretation is one such example . the monthly income for most hourly positions -- such as part - time accountants and wedding masters of ceremony -- can reach 2000 yuan or more .
another important reason that hourly part - time work has become popular is the desire to satisfy personal interest and expand one 's knowledge .
for example , mr. gu , manager of an enterprise 's human resources department , spends several hours each week processing financial accounts for the representative office of a foreign company .
mr. gu says the greatest benefits of part - time work are the continuous upgrading of one 's knowledge and the opportunity to dabble in a different field . of course , the 2000 yuan in monthly income is also attractive .
because some hourly positions have a low threshold and flexible work arrangements , they are gradually finding favor with many job - seeking graduates . fourteen percent of hourly workers graduated from university or technical schools in the last three years .
" initially , i was n't interested in hourly work . but after a few months , i feel that it is better than a nine - to - five job . "
after young huang graduated from university , he could not find a job he liked . finally , he signed up at a hotel to play background music on a piano .
" at 100 yuan an hour and with the good environment , i am very satisfied with my job . what i need now is to find more hourly jobs . "
according to reports , hourly jobs have become an important route for job - hunting graduates to accumulate work experience , hone their work skills , improve their communication skills and gain increased social experience .
graduates doing hourly work are mostly concentrated in positions requiring a high level of knowledge and skills , such as highly specialized translating positions and positions involving highly contemporary art or entertainment work . these two fields account for 22.1 % and 26.8 % respectively .
some hourly positions , such as foodstuff salespersons and shipping clerks , do not require a high level of skill and can be filled by unemployed persons following some simple training .
data shows that the unemployed make up 39 % of hourly workers . the proportion of unemployed workers is as high as 68.4 % in retail - related positions and 58.7 % in catering - related positions . hourly work has become an important path to employment for the unemployed .

chinese experts : us making groundless accusations by playing up " china military threat "
beijing , feb. 9 ( xinhua ) ( reporters : li xuanliang , xiong zhengyan , lin liping ) in the quadrennial defense review it formally submitted recently to congress , the us pentagon has said for the first time that china is " the emerging power that has the greatest potential to militarily challenge the united states . "
experts say this is unreasonable finger - pointing at china 's normal defense construction , an exaggeration of the " chinese military threat " and an interference in china 's internal affairs .
the quadrennial defense review is the pentagon 's new national defense guidelines .
the 92 - page report devotes three paragraphs to the issue of china 's military and the countermeasures the united states should take . the report makes 15 direct references to " china " or " chinese " and says that " as an important emerging power , china has the greatest potential to compete militarily with the united states . if the united states fails to take countermeasures , china will very likely field disruptive military technologies that could offset traditional u.s. military advantages " .
yao yunzhu , researcher with the department of world military research at the chinese academy of military sciences , said that although senior us officials have expressed similar viewpoints on various earlier occasions , this is the first time that the us has said in the defense report that " china is the major emerging power that has the greatest potential to compete militarily with the united states " .
" it is the first time that this report has explicitly referred to russia , india and china as rising strategic opponents and , in particular , focused more on the so - called ' chinese military threat ' , "
said major general peng guangqian , a researcher at the chinese academy of military sciences .
worthy of note is that on the same day the quadrennial defense review was officially submitted , us president bush also submitted the government budget for the 2007 fiscal year to congress . it included us$ 439. 3bn earmarked for national defense .
" if the budget supplemented for military operations in iraq and afghanistan is included , the american national defense budget for the 2007 fiscal year will top us$ 500bn to reach an all - time high , " peng guangqian said . " this is almost equal to the total of the defense expenditures of the rest of the world 's countries . "
peng guangqian says fabrication of " foreign threats " by the united states reflects the pentagon 's consistent style of " manufacturing enemies " , and that its real intention is to secure more defense funds so as to bring in more profits for the colossal weapons industry groups of the united states .
experts say that compared to the huge military expenditure of the united states , china 's national defense spending is very limited .
military expert deng hongzhou , who has participated several times in the compilation of the white book on chinese national defense , said that since the 1990s china 's national defense spending has indeed increased as its economic has developed , but its proportion of the national financial expenditure in the same period has shown an overall downward trend .
official data shows that compared with 1979 , the proportion that china 's 2004 national defense expenditure took in the national financial expenditure in the same period dropped by nearly 10 % .
in 2005 , china 's national defense expenditure was rmb244 . 656bn , equal to only 1/14 that of the us ; the per capita military expenditure was equal to only about 1/60 that of the us and military expenditure per serviceman was equal to 1/30 that of the us military .
" the us is about as large as china in terms of territory , but the difference in their military spending is so great . it is self - evident whose military power has exceeded the needs of legitimate defense , "
peng guangqian said .
teng jianqun , director of the research department of the china association of armament control and disarmament , says that the us should objectively evaluate china 's military construction and adds that china 's peaceful development does not mean that china and the us will become military adversaries in the future .
the 2004 china national defense white book says that china keeps firmly to the road of peaceful development and implements a defensive national defense policy .
china is no threat to any country , either in the past , at present or in the future .
to date , china has established no military base in any other country and has not sent even a single soldier to another country . in contrast , the us keeps some 100 military bases abroad and has deployed 100,000 troops in asian alone .
professor zhu feng of the college of international relations , beijing university says china and the us should use existing channels to increase communication and exchange , improve mutual understanding and trust , promote a constructive sino - us partnership in the new century and jointly promote and maintain world peace and development .

( international observation ) hamas seeks breakthrough in forming cabinet
ramallah , feb. 9 ( xinhua ) ( international observation ) hamas seeks breakthrough in forming cabinet
( xinhua reporters : wang hao , huang min )
following the victory of palestine 's islamic resistance movement ( hamas ) in parliamentary elections , how the new government will be laid out has become a focus of international attention .
what kind of policies hamas carries out will directly influence the policy directions taken by the various parties involved in the peace process .
at the same time , the resistant attitude of the us and israel will be an additional variable in the prospects of the hamas - lead government .
at present , the different palestinian sides are stepping up discussions in an active quest for a breakthrough in problems and sensitive issues that the cabinet formation poses toward future development of the situation .
( subhead ) who will become prime minister ?
since hamas won the right to form a cabinet , some outsiders have expressed worry that a split could take place between the " hamas prime minister " and the palestinian leader , abbas .
in addition , the leader of hamas , mashaal , who is currently visiting egypt , stressed that a palestinian government formed by the leaders of hamas would not recognize israel , a hard - line signal that heightened international concern .
the us and israel have clearly stated they will not accept a hamas - led government with real power and have threatened to cut off economic aid to palestine and freeze the transfer of tax revenues .
but this has not prevented hamas from carrying out some agile strategic adjustments , including a compromise policy of selecting independents .
according to reports , in order to maximize recognition from the international community , in recent days overseas and domestic leaders of hamas gathered in egypt decided to select an independent figure , ismail haniyeh , chairman of the board of gaza islamic university , to become the new prime minister .
concerned parties have not yet responded to the move .
palestinian analyst hisham said that , whoever takes over the prime - ministership , the most important thing is that the person should be capable of toning down hamas ' hard - line character , since only in this way can the success of the cabinet be guaranteed .
( subhead ) how will authority be distributed ?
from an internal perspective , the biggest challenge faced by the hamas - led cabinet is a lack of adequate experience in power .
an analysis in an article in the palestinian daily al-ayyam said that hamas gained popularity through social welfare projects but lacked experience in office . cooperation with the palestinian national liberation movement , or fatah , will be the best solution .
after the election , hamas raise the possibility of a " political partnership " with fatah and the joint establishment of a national coalition government , but until now fatah has not given a positive response .
fatah is internally split regarding whether to participate in the cabinet . one faction advocates taking part in the new government in order to have some sway ; another faction refuses the invitation by hamas and wants instead to be " an active opposition " in parliament .
informed sources say fatah , with persuasion coming from abbas , is gradually leaning toward participating in the new government .
even so , hamas and fatah will still haggle over the distribution of cabinet posts .
another path would be to establish a cabinet outside the parliamentary framework and ignore party affiliation .
according to reports , hamas has also laid out a government composed uniquely of experts , but the actual name list is still unknown .
in view of us and israeli attitudes , a government of technical experts is a way of forming a cabinet that will help lighten pressure from outside .
palestine 's basic law provides that the naming of the prime minister and the cabinet will take three to five weeks to complete once the new parliament takes over on the 16th of this month .
( subhead ) how do the weapons fit in ?
hamas ' weapons constitute another thorny issue in the forming of the new government .
the us and israel have an extremely hard - line attitude , insisting that hamas renounce violence and refusing to let it take part in the government while armed .
the leader of hamas , mashaal , emphasized on the 9th that armed resistance is the organization 's " strategic choice " .
the issue of weapons in reality includes two levels : the legality of weapons and the administration of jurisdiction over armed forces .
that hamas became the largest party in parliament through a democratic and free election has been recognized internationally . it will , through similarly legal methods , try to integrate its armed branch , the al-qassam brigade , into the government 's security apparatus .
hamas has floated in the past the idea of unifying all the armed factions into a palestinian national force , or " people 's army " , but the idea was not widely acknowledged and was even criticize by the palestine islamic jihad .
palestine currently has 60,000 security personnel , the vast majority of which are from the fatah camp .
in addition , fatah also has some loose organizational ties to affiliated armed factions such as the al-aqsa martyrs brigade and the fatah hawks .
responsible for forming a cabinet , hamas will have to come to terms with fatah regarding how to manage these various self - governing armed groups and reasonably distribute power over the security administration .
according to local media reports , abbas wants to oversee the security and intelligence forces . the police and civil defense forces would be overseen by the internal affairs department of the new government .
but the various sides are still negotiating this sensitive issue and until now there have been no developments .

" we are currently conducting research on the feasibility of a third antarctic exploration station . this is also china 's first feasibility study into an inland station in antarctica . "
said sun zhihui .
" after more than 20 years of endeavor , china has now gained a footing in world polar exploration . however , compared to other major polar exploration countries , there still exists a large gap and we must catch up , "
he said .
sun zhihui revealed that china will issue a report on polar expeditions on an annual basis in the future .

hdtv gradually becoming mainstream in us
new york , february 12 ( xinhua ) ( reporter : fan xiaolin ) with the steady drop in the price of hdtvs and a constantly expanding market , us television broadcasters are rushing to respond with high definition television programs .
the recent super bowl , an american - style football competition , became for us advertisers a warm - up match to welcome in the age of high definition television ( hdtv ) .
according to a recent report in the financial times , the us congress recently passed a bill that requires us broadcasters to halt all transmission of the current analog television signals on february 17 , 2009 and only transmit digital signals .
this implies that there is a definite time - table for the full digitalization of television program broadcasting in the us .

on this issue , there was a turning point this year .
according to forecasts by america 's consumer electronics association , this year the number of digital televisions sold will exceed the number of conventional televisions sold for the first time . furthermore , 85 % of the digital televisions sold will be hd products .
japanese researchers develop new model of highly effective artificial kidney
tokyo , february 13 ( xinhua ) ( reporter : qian zheng ) researchers at tokai university in japan have developed a bioartificial kidney . it not only possesses the same catabolic functions as a human kidney , but at the same time is also able to retain useful material components . additionally , it is small in size and easy to transplant . as more detailed research is carried out , there is hope that it could be good news for people with kidney disease .
according to a recent report by the japan light industry news , the newly developed bioartificial kidney consists primarily of two parts . one part is composed of " artificial nephrons " that filter metabolic matter and water from blood ; the other part consists of the " artificial renal tubules " the extracts water , amino acids and other useful elements from the primary urine and returns them to the blood .
the artificial nephrons and the artificial renal tubules are all made from hollow silk thread . the inner wall of the artificial renal tubules is also covered with a layer of tubule epithelial cells capable of breaking down waste .
this kind of epithelial cell can cause the materials that lead to a disease stemming from chronic dialysis -- dialysis - related amyloidosis -- to be broken down into amino acids and then returned to the blood . at the same time , it can also cause the glucose , vitamins and minerals needed by the body to reenter the blood .
in the past , artificial kidneys have relied on differences in osmotic pressure to filter metabolic waste but have been unable to eliminate it completely . they were also unable to return amino acids and other components to the blood .
the researchers conducted experimental transplants of the bioartificial kidney in goats . epithelial cells from pigs were used to make the inner wall of the hollow threads of the artificial kidney .
two weeks later , the researchers confirmed that the artificial kidney had successfully served its function .
they are currently developing a bioartificial kidney that uses human kidney cells and will conduct clinical studies after its safety has been verified .
safe electricity production in china still faced with difficult challenges
beijing , feb. 13 ( xinhua ) ( reporter : an pei ) an official with the state electricity regulatory commission ( serc ) said on the 13th that although the safe production of electricity remained stable on the whole in 2005 , it still faces difficult challenges .
serc vice chairman shi yubo said at the fifth ( expanded ) meeting of the national electricity safe production committee held here that china 's safe production of electric power was generally stable in 2005 , with the task of supplying power during the peak summer period being satisfactorily fulfilled and the safe supply of power being realized . the impact of natural disasters was actively countered , thereby essentially ensuring the safe and stable operation of the electric power system . accidents involving safe power production equipment or the general power grid showed a dramatic year - on - year reduction , while the health of power equipment was improved .
but he also pointed out that changes in power supply and demand and the coming on line of a series of newly built power - generating systems implied new challenges for the safe production of electric power .
these challenges include the following : electricity shortages will continue to exist on a region - specific , season - specific and time - specific basis ; the supply of power remains stretched in some regions ; major problems still exist in the supply of electricity and coal because of the lack of a positive mechanism for pricing them ; at the same time , the worsening quality of coal has not yet been brought under effective control , seriously affecting the stable operation of power - generating sets ; the weak structure and outdated equipment of some power grids cause hidden problems in system safety ; the frequent occurrence of accidents in the construction of electric power infrastructure has not been turned around and the situation remains grave .
shi yubo said contradictions buried at deeper levels will continuously be exposed as reform permeates further into the electric power system . the new problem faced will be how to maintain stability within employee ranks and ensure normal , orderly production .
discussing about the safe production of electric power in 2006 , shi yubo said it was necessary to further strengthen basic initiatives for the management of safe power production ; speed up the establishment and improvement of the emergency control mechanism for electricity safety and enhance emergency reaction capabilities ; step up coordination and team work between plants and grids in the joint maintenance of the safety of the electricity system ; continue a high standard of safety supervision and informatization efforts for hydroelectric dams in order to ensure dam safety ; tighten control over safety in electricity - related construction work so as to reduce casualties ; and continue to reinforce the submission of information to ensure the accuracy , timeliness and smooth communication of electricity safety information .
according to reports , in keeping with the new situation in electricity safety management , cerc will this year revise and improve the already promulgated interim regulations on investigations into electricity production accidents . at the same time , cerc will also issue support documents concerning the safety of hydroelectric dams and the safety protection of secondary electricity systems this year .
the power consumption of chinese society in 2005 reached 2.4689 trillion kwh , registering a year - on - year rise of 13.45 % .
confronted with the tautness of power supply and prominent difficulties in the transportation of coals and fuels , electric power enterprises took effective measures to improve equipment management so that all last year no major equipment accident occurred in the national electricity production .
there were 74 power grid accidents , representing a year - on - year decrease of 127 , and 427 equipment accidents , for a year - on - year decrease of 132 .
sa envoy : no organized criminal activities against chinese nationals in south africa
beijing , feb. 13 ( xinhua ) ( reporters : wang jiangang , hao yalin ) vusi b. koloane , charge d'affaires of the south african embassy in china , said on the 13th in an exclusive interview with a xinhua reporter that there in no organized criminal effort against chinese nationals in south africa .
he also said the south african government would do everything possible to " fight all forms of criminal activity . "
vusi b. koloane said that the south african government hopes to " reduce the crime rate to zero " and wants the safety of the lives and property of every foreigner working in south africa to be fully guaranteed by the local law and citizens .
so far , four chinese citizens have been murdered in south africa in 2006 , causing a widespread expression of concern from the chinese community .
china 's ministry of foreign affairs has raised the issue with south africa and warned chinese citizens traveling to south africa to be more aware of safety precautions . it also called on overseas compatriots to strengthen unity and friendly care between themselves while also coordinating with police in fighting crime .
" we express our sincerest sympathies and condolences to the families of those killed . "
vusi b. koloane said , " we feel sorry for what has happened and ask the chinese people to believe that the government of south africa is thoroughly investigating every case involving chinese . "
according to the chinese embassy in south africa , south african police have successfully solved the case of chen jianqing , a woman from fujian , china who was murdered in south africa on february 5. one suspect has been arrested .
police are currently hunting another suspect .
furthermore , the south african embassy in china has revealed that south african police have arrested a suspect in the shooting death of a hong kong businessman in january this year and that the victim 's possessions have been recovered .
speaking of the impact that the killing of chinese citizens might have , vusi b. koloane said that the incidents would " definitely " have a negative impact on business , tourism and other areas of interaction between the two countries , but the impact would " probably be fairly small " in the long run .
according to manqoba nyembezi , tourism attache with the south african embassy in china , the south african embassy issued more than 2,000 visas to chinese nationals in the first 15 days of this year .
according to official chinese statistics , south africa continued to remain china 's largest trade partner in africa in 2005 .
bilateral trade grew 23 % year - on - year to us$ 7. 27bn .
however , tourism industry sources said the serial killings of chinese citizens in south africa in 2004 had a marked influence on the number of tourists traveling to south africa .
statistics from the south african tourism board show that 20,331 chinese tourists visited south africa in the first half of 2005 , representing a year - on - year decrease of 14.9 % .
approximately 200,000 chinese currently live in south africa . they are spread throughout south africa 's cities , town and villages .
analysts here have attributed the consistently high rate of crime to the large wealth gap in south african society , high unemployment , the rampant use of guns and the lack of a death penalty to serve as a deterrent .
because many chinese do not understand english , they keep cash on their person and in their homes , making is easier to become the target of an attack by criminals seeking money .

surveillance of the extraction of confessions through torture is still a focus of psb work
beijing , february 14 ( xinhua ) ( reporter : meng na ) in response to a question by a foreign reporter during a news conference by the ministry of public security , zheng baigang , deputy director of the supervision department of the ministry of public security , said that the so - called " use of somewhat unsuitable methods to make criminal suspects to admit to a crime " is strictly prohibited in china .
a key focus of the work of the supervision department is also to prevent the occurrence of such problems .
he also said that some international organizations do not have a comprehensive and correct understanding of how chinese police enforce the law .

china to issue information network transmission right protection regulations
beijing , february 15 ( xinhua ) ( reporters : zhou wei , li fei ) many websites rely on large - scale retransmission of news reports from newspapers and magazines to increase hits . but many have not been authorized to do so and have not paid any fees . to counter this , said director - general of the copyright department of the national copyright administration wang ziqiang at a news conference held by the state council on the 15th , the state council 's impending information network transmission right protection regulations will respond to the issue of fees for the transmission of internet works .
wang ziqiang said that according to the laws and regulations currently in effect , works already published in a newspaper or magazine , if an author fails to make a " not for use " declaration , magazines and newspapers can use the work without the author 's permission but at the same time be required to pay remuneration . in accordance with the provisions of rules and regulations , the state copyright bureau has specially formulated remuneration standards for retransmission of newspapers and magazines .
however , according to the laws and regulations currently in effect , while newspapers and magazine have the legal right to require authorization , internet sites do not have the same right .
according to a related judicial interpretation by the supreme people 's court , the method in which the legal right to require authorization is applied to newspapers and magazines can be applied to the internet , so that short articles published in newspapers , magazines and on the internet can be used on the internet without acquiring permission if the author has not made a " do not use " declaration , with the user being required to pay remuneration .
but because the judicial interpretation does not make any stipulations regarding remuneration standards , in practice no remuneration is being paid when these works are used on the internet .
" on the issue of whether legal authorization applies to the use on the internet of short articles that have already been published , this still needs to be determined at the legal level . "
wang ziqiang said : " whether or not it is to be included within a scope determined by law , it is still necessary to wait for the information network transmission protection regulations to be issued this year in order to make a confirmation .
( international ) russian military says georgian parliament 's vote will not influence russia 's peacekeeping
moscow , feb. 15 ( xinhua ) ( reporter : song shiyi ) russian defense ministry press official [ xiedufu ] told media during a statement on the 15th that the georgian parliament 's resolution on russian peacekeepers would not affect the russian military 's peacekeeping in the short term and that russian forces would continue to carry out peacekeeping and their mission in the south ossetia conflict region .
in a statement the same day regarding the georgian parliament 's resolution concerning russia 's peacekeeping forces , kokoshin , chairman of russian state duma ( the lower house of parliament ) committee on the commonwealth of independent states , said that the resolution by georgia would undo the stability in the current state of affairs in the region and would be detrimental to russo - georgian relations .
he stressed the georgian parliament 's resolution was a step that would once again take russo - georgian relations in a negative direction .
he said georgia 's accusations toward russia were preposterous .
the resolution passed by the georgian parliament on that day called for russia 's peacekeeping forces to halt their peacekeeping activities in south ossetia but did not stipulate an actual time limit for russian peacekeepers to withdraw .
the georgian parliament accused russia 's peacekeepers of not carrying out their prescribed duties and viewed actions taken by russia in the conflict area as " an attempt to annex that part of georgian territory " .
the georgian parliament called on the government to take active measures and consider bringing international peacekeepers into the south ossetia conflict area to replace russian peacekeeping in the region .
the georgian parliament also instructed the government to revise agreements that stipulated russian peacekeepers be stationed in the conflict area .
south ossetia is an autonomous region in georgia bordering on the republic of north ossetia in russia .
following the collapse of the soviet union , it unilaterally declared independence and has been in a long - term state of opposition with the georgian central government .
russia currently has a peacekeeping force of 500 stationed in the region .
the force entered the region under an agreement signed between russia , georgia , north ossetia and south ossetia .

state administration of work safety : curbing major and extraordinary coal mine accidents is most urgent task this year
beijing , feb. 17 ( xinhua ) ( reporter : liu zheng ) following a string of four mining disasters that took the lives of over one hundred people , the grim status of national production safety over the past year has made " curbing major and extraordinary coal mine accidents " the most urgent task in national work safety this year .
this reporter was informed on the 17th by the state administration of work safety that coal mines must be given top priority if major and extraordinary coal mine accidents are truly going to be curbed .
to make coal mines safer this year , the state administration of work safety will take a strong hold over the following three items :
-- continue to wage an aggressive fight to control gas .
control of gas this year must give prominence to " draining gas before mining coal " .
if high gassy mines fail to " drain gas before mining coal " , they will be legally ordered to immediately halt production .
-- continue to wage an aggressive fight to consolidate and close mines .
the 5243 coal - mine and coal - pit closures already announced to the public must be carried out one by one , as must the more than seven hundred other closures recently announced in various regions .
closures must become a part of routine work , with coal mines that destroy resources , pollute the environment and fail to meet safety requirements being shut down without relent .
-- strengthen administration of coal - mine safety infrastructure .
the deterioration of management in the small number of large state - owned mines must immediately be corrected and controlled , while small mines with disorganized management should be guided in the building of standardized safety management systems .
in particular , key state - owned mines should be tightly controlled in order to strictly prohibit production in excess of capacity , strength or manpower .
the safe production control standard for this year calls for a 3 % drop over last year in the number of deaths nationally from all types of accidents , including a 3.5 % drop in accidents in coal mines .
major accidents with a death toll higher than ten must decrease at least 5 % , while in the coal mines they must decrease 7 % .
these control standards have been transmitted to the people 's governments of the various provinces . the various regions are breaking them up into their various layers and implementing them at the grassroots and enterprise levels .
statistics show that nationally 5986 people were killed in coal mine accidents in 2005 , which represents a 0.7 % decrease year on year .
but there were more large accidents in which ten or more people were killed , with the number of deaths increasing 66.6 % year on year .

the following day , the international olympic committee announced that pyleva had been expelled from the winter olympics and stripped of the silver medal she won for the women 's 15km individual biathlon at these winter olympics .
the same day , the international winter biathlon union decided to ban her from competition for two years .
it has been a consistent rule of the international olympic committee that any athlete found to have used performance - enhancing drugs at an olympics games will have his or her result cancelled and be disqualified from participation , but will receive no legal penalty .
but under italian law , athletes commit a crime by carrying and using stimulants . judicial authorities have the power to directly arrest and investigate all athletes that use performance - enhancing drugs and punish violators with prison terms ranging from three months to three years .
in december last year , after one year of " bargaining " , the international olympic committee and the italian government finally reached an accord under which the two sides agreed to handle incidents involving doping athletes during this winter olympics in accordance with italian laws .
following unremitting efforts by the international olympic committee , italian authorities conceded four days before the opening of the winter olympics to a promise that police would not enter the olympic village to search athletes ' dwellings during the winter olympic games . but athletes whose drug test proves positive will still be subject to investigation by italian prosecutors .
reports say that pescante , the italian government official supervising the turin winter olympics , had referred the pyleva doping incident to prosecutors in turin .
but neither the international olympic committee nor pescante himself has yet confirmed the report .
russian biathlon team doctor andrey dmytriev disclosed at noon on the 17th that pyleva had left turin to return to her country .
shi kangcheng , a chinese sports official who worked for years in the world anti - doping agency , said that once pyleva returned home the case would very likely end up unsettled .
shi kangcheng added that the international olympic committee and the italian government had never been " thorough " in their anti - doping drive at the winter olympics and the outcome would be hard to predict even if italian prosecutors did step in .
based on past instances of punishment handed down to italian athletes that have used performance - enhancing drugs , the harshest punishment imposed on violators was no more than " two years of prison term served on probation " .
for this reason , senior reporter of italy 's ansa [ pei ai ] predicted that the possibility of pyleva going to prison was " exceedingly slim " and that a fine would be the most she would receive .
also said that although an italian court can pass judgment in absentia , it would be impossible for the italian police to bring her back from a foreign country for a prison term .
if pyleva refused to accept a judgment , there would be no way italian authorities could detain her .
