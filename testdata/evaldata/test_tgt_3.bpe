expert believes that insurance q@@ di@@ i will not diver@@ t domestic stock market funds in near future
chin@@ an@@ e@@ w@@ s@@ .@@ com , july 30
according to report of china securities , the interim administrative measures for the management of offshore investments of insurance funds was promulgated a few days ago . insurance funds thus have wider room for utilization in the capital market .
liu le@@ fei , chief investment officer at china life insurance , believed that with the appreciation of the renminbi and the strong domestic capital market , insurance institutions will not engage in large - scale offshore investments through foreign exchange purchase . this also imp@@ lies that the insurance q@@ di@@ i will not diver@@ t funds in domestic stock market in the near future .
the report stated that many insurance institutions shared the same view .
expert stated that since a renminbi der@@ i@@ v@@ ative market still does not exist at the present moment , insurance institutions do not have adequate measures to a@@ ver@@ t risk . therefore , conditions are not yet ri@@ pe for large - scale foreign exchange purchase .
liu le@@ fei said that in the long run , in the area of asset allocation , offshore investments should make up a considerable portion in the overall allocation of insurance companies .
however , since the renminbi has rather huge appreciation pressure at present , china life insurance will mainly utilize exchange funds that it has in offshore investments .
cau@@ tion should be given to the purchase of foreign exchange for offshore investments under current situation .

bian secretly critici@@ zes judicial inv@@ ention in election , taiwan 's " judicial yuan " den@@ ies , demands explanation
chin@@ an@@ e@@ w@@ s@@ .@@ com , july 31 - chen shui - bian on the 30@@ th raised doubts about attempts of judicial members in the island to interven@@ e in the election of taiwan regional leaders .
k@@ ao ch@@ in - chi@@ h , " director - general of the department of judicial administration " in taiwan , stated on the same day that judges in the island are be@@ having differen@@ tly from what chen shui - bian described and demanded an explanation from chen shui - bian for his remark .
according to report of the united daily news of taiwan , chen shui - bian raised doubts about judges , prosecu@@ tors , and investig@@ ators interven@@ ed , influ@@ enced , and even attempted to control the election campaigns of various party candidates out of political factors or consideration for the elections . he claimed that he hoped this situation does not exist in taiwan but it may be extremely difficult .
in response to the doubt of chen shui - bian , w@@ eng yu@@ eh - sheng , " president of the judicial yuan " in taiwan maintained a low - key and did not respond while " secretary - general " fan ku@@ ang - chun appointed k@@ ao ch@@ in - chi@@ h to speak for the judicial yuan .

germany plans to lower thre@@ sh@@ old for attracting talents
this newspaper , ber@@ lin , july 1 , ( reporter wang huaicheng )
sch@@ av@@ an , german minister of education and research , said a few days ago that germany should lower the restrictions on the import@@ ation of foreign professionals in the immigration law to resolve the shortage of professionals in germany through an increase in the import@@ ation of foreign talents .
according to the report of the organization for economic cooperation and development , the size of labor force between the age of 15 and 64 in germany will drop every year ti@@ ll 2010 .
if there are insufficient immigrants , germany 's labor force in 20@@ 20 will be 6 percent smaller than it is now .
however , reports of organizations including the con@@ federation of german employers ' associations and the association of german engine@@ ers showed that in current german labor market , the short@@ ages in engine@@ ers and s@@ killed techn@@ ic@@ al@@ professionals are bigger .
according to data from the german federal labor office , as of this may , there was a shortage of approximately 1@@ 2,@@ 700 people in the supply of engine@@ ers and a shortage of 9@@ ,@@ 600 people in the supply of technicians in the german labor market .
in order to protect the employment of its nationals , germany has set a rather high thre@@ sh@@ old for the import@@ ation of foreign talents .
the german immigration law stipulates that the annual salaries of professionals from non - eu countries must not be lower than 8@@ 5,@@ 500 euro@@ s , otherwise they will not be able to obtain a work and residence permit in germany .
sch@@ av@@ an suggested lower this limit to 4@@ 0,000 to 6@@ 0,000 euro@@ s .
do n't have blind faith in legal " theoretical circle "
article 8 of the draft amendment of the law on lawyers recently submitted to the standing committee of the national people 's congress for deliberation stipulates : people who have professional experiences in the research or teaching of law , with advanced professional ti@@ t@@ les or corresponding professional compet@@ ence , may obtain a law@@ yer 's license , and get approval from judicial departments under the state council .
( june 28 , china youth daily )
there is a difference between the " theoretical circle " and the " practical circle " in law . the former mainly includes " ab@@ str@@ act behaviors " such as the teaching and research of law while the latter are more " concrete behaviors " such as engaging in liti@@ g@@ ations , legal consultations , and legal services .
the phenomenon of " s@@ cor@@ ning of each other " has long exist@@ ed between the theoretical circle and the practical circle in law . the theoretical circle argu@@ es that the practical circle lacks necessary legal at@@ tain@@ ments and is simply mechanical " leg@@ alist " while the direction of criticism of the practical circle on the theoretical circle is that " theories cannot guide practice " .
in regards to such a diver@@ g@@ ence of division of labor , what law can do is to remain neutr@@ al instead of supporting any one side with m@@ igh@@ t@@ iness .
however , the " char@@ tered law@@ yer system " in the law on lawyers has objec@@ tively endorsed the judgment that the theoretical circle is superior to the practical circle in law .
in fact , for some experts and scholars who engage in p@@ ure research and teaching of legal theories such as the history of legal system and international laws , no matter how thoroughly accomplished they are in theories , they will still be out of step with practical legal issues .
in this case , char@@ tered law@@ yer system has no doubt set a " bad prece@@ dent " with extremely harmful effects on the quali@@ fication confusion in the practical circle in law .
the blind faith in the theoretical circle is not only limited to these . for instance , expert sub@@ missions and expert appraisal meetings always influence and even ve@@ to court verdic@@ ts . this phenomenon is also a direct manife@@ station of such blind faith .

currently , the british police turn the scope of investigation to india and australia .

do n't let pe@@ d@@ d@@ lers an@@ no@@ y people in public places
travel is to seek relaxation , relief , comfor@@ t , and to enjoy natural scen@@ ery and results of social civilization to the ful@@ l@@ est .
however , when travel@@ ing in china , many people encounter such an an@@ no@@ y@@ ance of being en@@ circ@@ led , pursued , obstruc@@ ted , and intercepted by pe@@ d@@ d@@ lers and people engage in intermediary businesses in public places .
when people getting on or off the vehicle , no matter car or train , they are always pe@@ stered by pe@@ d@@ d@@ lers and some unlicensed mid@@ d@@ le@@ men .
if they are not selling eg@@ gs , pe@@ an@@ u@@ ts , and s@@ es@@ ame se@@ ed ca@@ kes , then they are selling newspapers and magaz@@ ines , and then the many unlicensed mid@@ d@@ le@@ men recomm@@ ending restaurants and hotels , and even selling fake documents and fake inv@@ o@@ ices so on and so forth .
if you turn him down , he can follow you for a few hundred meters and act very much like to win or die .
many visitors also feel the same in some scen@@ ic spots .
people come to pe@@ d@@ dle things such as travel souven@@ irs and small hand@@ ic@@ r@@ af@@ ts and things like that before one enter@@ s the door .
the situation increases once one enter@@ s the door . no matter how bright one 's mo@@ od is , it will still be sp@@ o@@ iled and one will feel insi@@ p@@ id .
the media once reported that many foreign visitors to xi@@ '@@ an spoke very highly of the scen@@ ic spots and historical sites of xi@@ '@@ an . however , they could not understand why he@@ aps of pe@@ d@@ d@@ lers were allowed to pe@@ d@@ dle everywhere .
public places such as stations and scen@@ ic spots are originally places where journey embar@@ ks or for leisure . good man@@ ners and order , as well as peace and harmony should be stressed to provide visitors with a comfor@@ table and rela@@ xing environment .
not only does the come and go at will of the pe@@ d@@ d@@ lers distur@@ b visitors ' mo@@ od , objec@@ tively , they have disru@@ pted the public order of these public places and caused visual and environmental pollution , and at the same time , it also provides conditions and opportunities to law@@ break@@ ers to inc@@ ite trouble .
the important thing is that these public places are the win@@ dow@@ s of local spiritual civilization . seen one and you have seen them all . what is being damaged is not only the issue of image , it also affec@@ ts the economic development of the area .
imag@@ ine , you want to make tourist industry a success but gre@@ et guests from all over with this d@@ read@@ fully dis@@ ordered tourist environment . who still wants to come ? who still da@@ res to come ?
how can your tourist economy produce returns ?
with the arrival of peak travel season , top priority should be given to the creation of a civilized travel environment for visitors from all over .
public places are not markets . the operating behaviors of pe@@ d@@ d@@ lers should be regul@@ ated . unlicensed operation should be ad@@ am@@ antly abol@@ ished and illegal activities should be firmly sup@@ pressed .
only a civilized and orderly environment will enable visitors to come gl@@ ad@@ ly , to return after fully enjoying themselves , and to re@@ visit with exc@@ it@@ ement .
in a few words , do not let pe@@ d@@ d@@ lers an@@ no@@ y people in public places .
" reward for voluntary sur@@ render of low - income subsidy " fails to stand close scru@@ tin@@ y
the ji@@ angu@@ om@@ en neighbor@@ hood office in dong@@ cheng district , beijing handed out items such as re@@ fri@@ ger@@ ators as re@@ wards for 12 low - income subsidy recipi@@ ent families that volun@@ tar@@ ily sur@@ rendered their low - income subsidies .
( the beijing news , july 10 )
the auth@@ or is happy about the improvements in life of these families . however , i have mixed feelings about the wor@@ ding of " voluntary sur@@ render of low - income subsidy " and the practice of " giving out re@@ wards " .
vice - chairman of ji@@ angu@@ om@@ en neighbor@@ hood office said , " in order to address problems including def@@ r@@ au@@ ding low - income subsidy and so on , encouraging voluntary sur@@ render of low - income subsidy is to set an example for other low - income subsidy recipi@@ ent households . "
if this example encour@@ ages other low - income subsidy recipients to turn the corner through efforts of their own , then it is indeed worth promoting . however , if one wants to use this to " inspir@@ e " people who have been def@@ r@@ au@@ ding low - income subsidy for a long time , then it is somewhat n@@ ai@@ ve .
the work to differen@@ ti@@ ate and straigh@@ ten up real and false low - income subsidy recipi@@ ent households should rely more on the law .
relevant departments should strengthen responsibilities that low - income subsidy recipi@@ ent households need to fulfill when enjoying low - income subsidy : for example , inform changes in number of family members and income in a timely manner , report employment situation , and subjec@@ ted to regular review . meanwhile , relevant departments should step up efforts in supervision and inspection .
after all , only the " sur@@ render of low - income subsidy according to the law " is the long - term plan .
who p@@ ays for the material re@@ wards given to families that sur@@ render their low - income subsidies by the neighbor@@ hood office ?
as a level - one government agency , the expenses of the neighbor@@ hood office are shoul@@ dered by financial appropri@@ ation .
then , should this sum of tax@@ payers ' money be spent ?
on the one hand , families that sur@@ render their low - income subsidies have proven that they have certain abilities to be ' self - sufficient " . on the other hand , are n't there still people who apply for low - income subsidy ?
government appropri@@ ation that is lab@@ eled as life - saving money should render timely help instead of making what is good still better .
liu gang@@ yi 's ' i am willing to serve others ' remark more cre@@ di@@ ble
on july 10 , liu gang@@ yi , the first secretary of the township party committee publicly nomin@@ ated and directly elected in the country and the secretary of the party committee of mul@@ an town in xin@@ du district , chengdu city was subjec@@ ted to democratic evaluation for the fourth time since he took office . he had an approval rating of 97 percent .
in the conversation between liu gang@@ yi and the reporter , liu gang@@ yi defined himself as " one who serves others " .
( yesterday , the beijing news )
the " one who serves others " that liu gang@@ yi referred to is perhaps more tru@@ th@@ ful and convinc@@ ing than " the one who serves others " referred to by some appointed cadres .
the biggest advantage of public nomination and direct election over appointment system is that it is mainly ordinary party members and the people who determine the origin of the power of the former while the latter is mainly appointed by higher - level organizations , whereas the direction from which power origin@@ ates has established that the former must give accountability to the people top priority .
the origin of power and to whom one is responsi@@ b@@ le@@ are fundamental factors in deciding how an elec@@ te@@ e conduc@@ ts his work .
some people challenge that such a " democratic evaluation " is more like a " democracy show " .
my opinion is that having such form of democratic evaluation is better than not having any .
given considerations to the history and current situation of the building of democratic politics at the grassroots level in china , i believe that direct public election is already a major breakthrough . democratic evaluation is an important component of this unprecedented undertaking . it should not be unde@@ res@@ tim@@ ated in the advancement of building democratic politics at the grassroots level .
india expec@@ ts to elec@@ t first woman president , analysts say possibility of winning election is high , woman voters hope for higher status of women
on june 23 , pati@@ l put her pal@@ ms together before filling out the presidential candidate documents .

pati@@ l is the first female presidential candidate in india 's history . if she is elected , she will become india 's first woman president ever .
pati@@ l is the presidential candidate of the ruling congress party while she@@ k@@ aw@@ at is from the opposition b@@ har@@ ati@@ ya jan@@ at@@ a party .
since the congress party has the upper hand in the presidential election , the media and the people all suspect that pati@@ l has a relative high possibility of being elected .
pati@@ l , 72 , was the woman governor of ra@@ j@@ as@@ than .
she was a law@@ yer and joined the congress in 198@@ 5 . she is seas@@ oned in politics . during her term as the governor of ra@@ j@@ as@@ than , she had received high opinions from the government .
she also de@@ votes herself to social welfare and is the hon@@ or@@ ary chairman of many cultural , educational , and social welfare organizations .
analysts pointed out that the reason pati@@ l became the candidate was that she has pledged her al@@ legi@@ ance stead@@ fast@@ ly to s@@ onia g@@ and@@ hi , the chairman of the congress party .
in india , the g@@ and@@ hi family has been controlling the ruling national party for a long time .
pati@@ l has the support of many woman voters , who believe that pati@@ l will re@@ build the image of women and raise their status in india where the concep@@ tion of discrimination against women is serious .
the constitution stipulates that india is a federal state . the president is the cere@@ mon@@ ial head of the state and the chief commander of the armed forces . he / she does not represent any party or organization and is more of a sym@@ bo@@ l .

the report said that while the u.s. troops in europe are being reduced , many troops are be ro@@ t@@ ated into iraq and afghanistan to fight , thus causing a shortage in u.s. troops in europe . as a result , they cannot cooperate normally with their european allies .
the report suggested a hal@@ t to the plan to cut u.s. troops in europe .

three functions of modern army uni@@ forms
the first is its identification function .
an important mark to differen@@ ti@@ ate between armies of different countries , between different services and arms , and between the army and the civilians .
even though army uni@@ forms have basically the same use among armies of over 100 large and small countries in the world , no army uni@@ forms of any two countries ' armies are identical .
the second is its sym@@ bol@@ ic function .
to a certain extent , army uniform is a reflec@@ tion of the spirit and distinc@@ tive feature of a nation . it also fully reflects the fighting ability and the soldiers ' quality of a country 's army .
in the three major types of army uni@@ forms - dres@@ s uniform , service uniform , and combat and training uniform - there is nothing like the cris@@ p and beautiful dres@@ s uniform that can fully display the might of the country and the army .
the third is its protective function .
with the rapid development in new and high - tech weapons and equipment , to enhance the comprehensive protective ability of new and high - tech combat and training uni@@ forms so as to provide army uni@@ forms with various functions including bul@@ let@@ proof , counter - reconnaissance , chemical - proof , ger@@ ms - proof , radi@@ ation - proof , as well as temperature , dam@@ p@@ ness , and air adjustments has become the priority in the development of army uni@@ forms .

this newspaper , reported by staff reporters cao jia@@ wei , zhu chun@@ bin : on june 18 , in the training class for cadres of the department of people 's armed forces in jing@@ jiang city , jiangsu province , the tu@@ tor@@ ial to win the psychological battle under information conditions ta@@ u@@ ght by lu yu@@ qing , chief of the x@@ il@@ ai county department of people 's armed forces , was well received by all students taking part in the training .
this was the new change brought about by the concentrated effort of the city 's department of people 's armed forces to elev@@ ate the comprehensive qualities of the cadres of the department of people 's armed forces through charging them with heavy tasks in accordance with reality of their positions .
in the beginning of the year , during grassroots research , the party committee of the department of people 's armed forces found that some cadres of the people 's armed forces had long term of service and held too many con@@ current duties , thus failed to focus their energy on doing armed forces work .
to this end , they adopted measures including centralized training , co@@ ach@@ ing seminars , and reliance on training offered by local party schools to provide regular training to cadres of the department of people 's armed forces and concentrated efforts on resolving issues including the narrow range of knowledge and one - dimen@@ sional professional qualifications of the cadres of the department of people 's armed forces .
they integrated central tasks and bol@@ dly assigned duties to cadres of the department of people 's armed forces , charged them with heavy tasks , and elev@@ ated their work abilities through on - the - job training .
at the same time , they actively coordinated with local organizations and departments and jointly formulated the program for cadres of the department of people 's armed forces to compete for job positions that clearly stipulated that chiefs of the department of armed forces must join the team of party committee at the same level and not to hold other con@@ current duties ;
they established the adjustment and exchange mechanism for cadres of the department of people 's armed forces . for cadres of the department of people 's armed forces who are relatively old and cannot adapt to grassroots armed forces work , they made adjustments and exchanges immediately . for compatriots who had good comprehensive qualities and strong work abilities , they promoted and employed them .
not long ago , chen y@@ is@@ ong , secretary of the new century ship@@ building co@@ . , ltd. department of people 's armed forces , led the technical detachment of the militi@@ amen in the innovative development of under@@ water ship wel@@ ding technology that filled the gap in the country . he was promoted to the chief of the company 's department of people 's armed forces as an exception .
good start still needs to see things through
the 2@@ -@@ 2 score was reasonable and was acceptable to the chinese team if judging from the result of the game alone . the key was that the process of the game was somewhat regre@@ tt@@ able .
if the iranian team led by 2@@ -@@ 0 , then the chinese team ti@@ ed the score , that would definitely make chinese fans feel very differen@@ tly . it would bol@@ ster a lot of morale . unfortun@@ ately , the situation was precisely the opposite .
fails to see things through can be considered as an old problem of the chinese team .
the chinese team never knows how to play under excellent situation . the general opinion is that mentally chinese players are not tough enough .
this is indeed a reason that the chinese team fails to " see things through " .
however , judging from the game that the chinese team played today , it seems that it is not necessarily so .
not only had sun ji@@ hai , sun xiang , sh@@ ao ji@@ ay@@ i , and zheng zhi played in europe before , li wei@@ feng and the others are also battle - hard@@ ened veter@@ ans . they are experienced and know@@ le@@ d@@ ge@@ able . theore@@ tically , there should not be any problem with their mental qualities .
this time , the chinese team was regre@@ tt@@ ably pressed to tie with the iranian team . the reason was probably the in@@ effectiveness in moving players on the field .
the iranian team sub@@ stitu@@ ted two people while they were tr@@ ailing behind and the situation was immediately improved .
the chinese team also sub@@ stitu@@ ted three players in the second half but the outcome was not good .
in order to overcome the problem of not seeing things through , one must find the root of the problem .
as long as one identi@@ fies the problem , means to resolve it is probably not hard to find .
the only wor@@ ris@@ ome thing is to try to find a cur@@ e indiscrimin@@ ately for an emergency .
if the situation continues like this , no matter how many more games the chinese team plays , it will still commit the same mistake . the continuous progress that people expect as it plays more games will be out of the question .
