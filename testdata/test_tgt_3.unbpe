u.s. treasury secretary paulson arrived in china yesterday for a visit . the united states is exerting all efforts in convincing china to further implement necessary economic reforms and environmental protection work , particularly the renminbi exchange rate topic that had attracted wide attention .
u.s. diplomat stated that paulson visited xining city , the capital of major chinese northwestern province qinghai , earlier .
china is currently implementing a series of environmental protection plans near the largest salt - water lake in qinghai province .
paulson traveled to beijing today to discuss with chief chinese officials on topics including the acceleration of the process of the ' us - china strategic economic dialogue ' initiated last year .
the us - china strategic economic dialogue mainly discusses economic and environmental protection issues with renminbi exchange rate being the most important one . u.s. congressmen argued that the value of renminbi is underestimated .
the us - china trade deficit is soaring . pressure inside the united states is increasing . congressmen are preparing to adopt retaliatory measures to counter their so - called " unfair china trade policy " .
last week , the u.s. senate finance committee overwhelmingly adopted a bill requiring the treasury department to identify list of nations with " fundamentally misaligned " currency exchange rate , thus opening a potential door to economic sanctions against beijing .
u.s. congressmen said that an undervalued renminbi makes goods exported from china to the united states very inexpensive , thus intensifying the us - china trade deficit . the us - china trade deficit had reached us $ 232.5 billion last year .

the report stated that many insurance institutions shared the same view .
expert stated that since a renminbi derivative market still does not exist at the present moment , insurance institutions do not have adequate measures to avert risk . therefore , conditions are not yet ripe for large - scale foreign exchange purchase .
liu lefei said that in the long run , in the area of asset allocation , offshore investments should make up a considerable portion in the overall allocation of insurance companies .
however , since the renminbi has rather huge appreciation pressure at present , china life insurance will mainly utilize exchange funds that it has in offshore investments .
caution should be given to the purchase of foreign exchange for offshore investments under current situation .

in response to the doubt of chen shui - bian , weng yueh - sheng , " president of the judicial yuan " in taiwan maintained a low - key and did not respond while " secretary - general " fan kuang - chun appointed kao chin - chih to speak for the judicial yuan .
kao chin - chih stated that the fundamental law of taiwan and the " judges ' rules and regulations " both proclaim in explicit terms that judges should transcend political parties and groups . they cannot participate in activities of political parties or assist in the campaign . judges all follow relevant restraints cautiously . the judicial yuan believed that all judges have done well .
kao chin - chih quoted an example by saying that chang sheng - hsi , judge of the " kaohsiung branch of the supreme court " , took part in the course offered by the ketagalan institute a few years ago . since the related course had party flavor , the self - disciplinary committee formed by judges decided to take disciplinary action against him .
chang sheng - hsi once wanted to run in the primary election of the democratic progressive party but due to the controversy over running in the election while in office , he finally decided to give up .
kao chin - chih argued that if it is for the trial of individual case , one can lodge an appeal to the court of higher instance . one cannot infer that judges have other political intentions solely based on the outcome of the verdict .
germany plans to lower threshold for attracting talents
this newspaper , berlin , july 1 , ( reporter wang huaicheng )
schavan , german minister of education and research , said a few days ago that germany should lower the restrictions on the importation of foreign professionals in the immigration law to resolve the shortage of professionals in germany through an increase in the importation of foreign talents .
according to the report of the organization for economic cooperation and development , the size of labor force between the age of 15 and 64 in germany will drop every year till 2010 .
if there are insufficient immigrants , germany 's labor force in 2020 will be 6 percent smaller than it is now .
however , reports of organizations including the confederation of german employers ' associations and the association of german engineers showed that in current german labor market , the shortages in engineers and skilled technicalprofessionals are bigger .
according to data from the german federal labor office , as of this may , there was a shortage of approximately 12,700 people in the supply of engineers and a shortage of 9,600 people in the supply of technicians in the german labor market .
in order to protect the employment of its nationals , germany has set a rather high threshold for the importation of foreign talents .
the german immigration law stipulates that the annual salaries of professionals from non - eu countries must not be lower than 85,500 euros , otherwise they will not be able to obtain a work and residence permit in germany .
schavan suggested lower this limit to 40,000 to 60,000 euros .
do n't have blind faith in legal " theoretical circle "
article 8 of the draft amendment of the law on lawyers recently submitted to the standing committee of the national people 's congress for deliberation stipulates : people who have professional experiences in the research or teaching of law , with advanced professional titles or corresponding professional competence , may obtain a lawyer 's license , and get approval from judicial departments under the state council .
( june 28 , china youth daily )
there is a difference between the " theoretical circle " and the " practical circle " in law . the former mainly includes " abstract behaviors " such as the teaching and research of law while the latter are more " concrete behaviors " such as engaging in litigations , legal consultations , and legal services .
the phenomenon of " scorning of each other " has long existed between the theoretical circle and the practical circle in law . the theoretical circle argues that the practical circle lacks necessary legal attainments and is simply mechanical " legalist " while the direction of criticism of the practical circle on the theoretical circle is that " theories cannot guide practice " .
in regards to such a divergence of division of labor , what law can do is to remain neutral instead of supporting any one side with mightiness .
however , the " chartered lawyer system " in the law on lawyers has objectively endorsed the judgment that the theoretical circle is superior to the practical circle in law .
in fact , for some experts and scholars who engage in pure research and teaching of legal theories such as the history of legal system and international laws , no matter how thoroughly accomplished they are in theories , they will still be out of step with practical legal issues .
in this case , chartered lawyer system has no doubt set a " bad precedent " with extremely harmful effects on the qualification confusion in the practical circle in law .
the blind faith in the theoretical circle is not only limited to these . for instance , expert submissions and expert appraisal meetings always influence and even veto court verdicts . this phenomenon is also a direct manifestation of such blind faith .

do n't let peddlers annoy people in public places
travel is to seek relaxation , relief , comfort , and to enjoy natural scenery and results of social civilization to the fullest .
however , when traveling in china , many people encounter such an annoyance of being encircled , pursued , obstructed , and intercepted by peddlers and people engage in intermediary businesses in public places .
when people getting on or off the vehicle , no matter car or train , they are always pestered by peddlers and some unlicensed middlemen .
if they are not selling eggs , peanuts , and sesame seed cakes , then they are selling newspapers and magazines , and then the many unlicensed middlemen recommending restaurants and hotels , and even selling fake documents and fake invoices so on and so forth .
if you turn him down , he can follow you for a few hundred meters and act very much like to win or die .
many visitors also feel the same in some scenic spots .
people come to peddle things such as travel souvenirs and small handicrafts and things like that before one enters the door .
the situation increases once one enters the door . no matter how bright one 's mood is , it will still be spoiled and one will feel insipid .
the media once reported that many foreign visitors to xi'an spoke very highly of the scenic spots and historical sites of xi'an . however , they could not understand why heaps of peddlers were allowed to peddle everywhere .
public places such as stations and scenic spots are originally places where journey embarks or for leisure . good manners and order , as well as peace and harmony should be stressed to provide visitors with a comfortable and relaxing environment .
not only does the come and go at will of the peddlers disturb visitors ' mood , objectively , they have disrupted the public order of these public places and caused visual and environmental pollution , and at the same time , it also provides conditions and opportunities to lawbreakers to incite trouble .
the important thing is that these public places are the windows of local spiritual civilization . seen one and you have seen them all . what is being damaged is not only the issue of image , it also affects the economic development of the area .
imagine , you want to make tourist industry a success but greet guests from all over with this dreadfully disordered tourist environment . who still wants to come ? who still dares to come ?
how can your tourist economy produce returns ?
with the arrival of peak travel season , top priority should be given to the creation of a civilized travel environment for visitors from all over .
public places are not markets . the operating behaviors of peddlers should be regulated . unlicensed operation should be adamantly abolished and illegal activities should be firmly suppressed .
only a civilized and orderly environment will enable visitors to come gladly , to return after fully enjoying themselves , and to revisit with excitement .
in a few words , do not let peddlers annoy people in public places .
" reward for voluntary surrender of low - income subsidy " fails to stand close scrutiny
the jianguomen neighborhood office in dongcheng district , beijing handed out items such as refrigerators as rewards for 12 low - income subsidy recipient families that voluntarily surrendered their low - income subsidies .
( the beijing news , july 10 )
the author is happy about the improvements in life of these families . however , i have mixed feelings about the wording of " voluntary surrender of low - income subsidy " and the practice of " giving out rewards " .
vice - chairman of jianguomen neighborhood office said , " in order to address problems including defrauding low - income subsidy and so on , encouraging voluntary surrender of low - income subsidy is to set an example for other low - income subsidy recipient households . "
if this example encourages other low - income subsidy recipients to turn the corner through efforts of their own , then it is indeed worth promoting . however , if one wants to use this to " inspire " people who have been defrauding low - income subsidy for a long time , then it is somewhat naive .
the work to differentiate and straighten up real and false low - income subsidy recipient households should rely more on the law .
relevant departments should strengthen responsibilities that low - income subsidy recipient households need to fulfill when enjoying low - income subsidy : for example , inform changes in number of family members and income in a timely manner , report employment situation , and subjected to regular review . meanwhile , relevant departments should step up efforts in supervision and inspection .
after all , only the " surrender of low - income subsidy according to the law " is the long - term plan .
who pays for the material rewards given to families that surrender their low - income subsidies by the neighborhood office ?
as a level - one government agency , the expenses of the neighborhood office are shouldered by financial appropriation .
then , should this sum of taxpayers ' money be spent ?
on the one hand , families that surrender their low - income subsidies have proven that they have certain abilities to be ' self - sufficient " . on the other hand , are n't there still people who apply for low - income subsidy ?
government appropriation that is labeled as life - saving money should render timely help instead of making what is good still better .
liu gangyi 's ' i am willing to serve others ' remark more credible
on july 10 , liu gangyi , the first secretary of the township party committee publicly nominated and directly elected in the country and the secretary of the party committee of mulan town in xindu district , chengdu city was subjected to democratic evaluation for the fourth time since he took office . he had an approval rating of 97 percent .
in the conversation between liu gangyi and the reporter , liu gangyi defined himself as " one who serves others " .
( yesterday , the beijing news )
the " one who serves others " that liu gangyi referred to is perhaps more truthful and convincing than " the one who serves others " referred to by some appointed cadres .
the biggest advantage of public nomination and direct election over appointment system is that it is mainly ordinary party members and the people who determine the origin of the power of the former while the latter is mainly appointed by higher - level organizations , whereas the direction from which power originates has established that the former must give accountability to the people top priority .
the origin of power and to whom one is responsibleare fundamental factors in deciding how an electee conducts his work .
some people challenge that such a " democratic evaluation " is more like a " democracy show " .
my opinion is that having such form of democratic evaluation is better than not having any .
given considerations to the history and current situation of the building of democratic politics at the grassroots level in china , i believe that direct public election is already a major breakthrough . democratic evaluation is an important component of this unprecedented undertaking . it should not be underestimated in the advancement of building democratic politics at the grassroots level .
india expects to elect first woman president , analysts say possibility of winning election is high , woman voters hope for higher status of women
on june 23 , patil put her palms together before filling out the presidential candidate documents .
the presidential election in india has begun on the 19th . the new president will emerge between the incumbent vice president shekawat and pratibha patil , the governor of rajasthan who resigned not long ago .
patil is the first female presidential candidate in india 's history . if she is elected , she will become india 's first woman president ever .
patil is the presidential candidate of the ruling congress party while shekawat is from the opposition bharatiya janata party .
since the congress party has the upper hand in the presidential election , the media and the people all suspect that patil has a relative high possibility of being elected .
patil , 72 , was the woman governor of rajasthan .
she was a lawyer and joined the congress in 1985 . she is seasoned in politics . during her term as the governor of rajasthan , she had received high opinions from the government .
she also devotes herself to social welfare and is the honorary chairman of many cultural , educational , and social welfare organizations .
analysts pointed out that the reason patil became the candidate was that she has pledged her allegiance steadfastly to sonia gandhi , the chairman of the congress party .
in india , the gandhi family has been controlling the ruling national party for a long time .
patil has the support of many woman voters , who believe that patil will rebuild the image of women and raise their status in india where the conception of discrimination against women is serious .
the constitution stipulates that india is a federal state . the president is the ceremonial head of the state and the chief commander of the armed forces . he / she does not represent any party or organization and is more of a symbol .

climate change causes rapid decline in alpine glaciers
this newspaper , geneva , july 29 ( reporter liu jun )
glacier experts at the swiss academy of sciences found in a longitudinal study that the more than 1,800 glaciers in switzerland are declining at an average annual rate of 3 percent between 1850 to 2005 .
the heat wave in 2003 alone had caused 1.8 percent of alpine glaciers to melt .
experts believed that if global temperature rose by 3 degree celsius by 2100 , the glaciers would be 80 percent less than today . if global temperature rose by 5 degree celsius , then the glaciers would be completely melted .
the aletsch glacier is the longest glacier in europe . it has been inscribed by unesco into the world heritage list . however , it had reduced by 100 meters in just one year between 2005 and 2006 . the protection of natural environment has reached a point that demands immediate attention .
the picture shows the 23km - long aletsch glacier .

the u.s. food and drug administration issued a safety warning this may suggesting diabetics to take precaution in taking avandia because scientists published a study report in the may 21 issue of the new england journal of medicine stating that this best - selling drug will greatly increase patients ' risk of heart attack and death rate .

an official of the u.s. department of defense said on the 23rd that due to the war on iraq and changes in global situation , the u.s. department of defense is reconsidering its plan to cut approximately half of the u.s. troops in europe formulated in 2002 .
u.s. media quoted a department of defense official as saying that since the war on iraq is still going on and the us - russia and us - iran relationships are deteriorating , the leadership at the department of defense raised doubts about the feasibility of the plan to cut the troops in europe .
in 2002 , the then secretary of defense rumsfeld announced that the united states would reduce the original 113,000 troops in europe to 71,000 by 2012 in order to build a new " small and elite " army .
the number of u.s. troops in europe is currently reduced to 100,000 .
however , craddock , commander - in - chief of u.s. european command , submitted a report to the current secretary of defense gates in june questioning the above reduction plan .
the report said that while the u.s. troops in europe are being reduced , many troops are be rotated into iraq and afghanistan to fight , thus causing a shortage in u.s. troops in europe . as a result , they cannot cooperate normally with their european allies .
the report suggested a halt to the plan to cut u.s. troops in europe .
relevant experts in the united states argued that the above phenomenon shows that the prolonged war on iraq has disrupted the original adjustment plan of the u.s. army .

three functions of modern army uniforms
the first is its identification function .
an important mark to differentiate between armies of different countries , between different services and arms , and between the army and the civilians .
even though army uniforms have basically the same use among armies of over 100 large and small countries in the world , no army uniforms of any two countries ' armies are identical .
the second is its symbolic function .
to a certain extent , army uniform is a reflection of the spirit and distinctive feature of a nation . it also fully reflects the fighting ability and the soldiers ' quality of a country 's army .
in the three major types of army uniforms - dress uniform , service uniform , and combat and training uniform - there is nothing like the crisp and beautiful dress uniform that can fully display the might of the country and the army .
the third is its protective function .
with the rapid development in new and high - tech weapons and equipment , to enhance the comprehensive protective ability of new and high - tech combat and training uniforms so as to provide army uniforms with various functions including bulletproof , counter - reconnaissance , chemical - proof , germs - proof , radiation - proof , as well as temperature , dampness , and air adjustments has become the priority in the development of army uniforms .

people 's armed forces department of jingjiang city builds platform to elevate qualities of people 's armed forces cadres
this newspaper , reported by staff reporters cao jiawei , zhu chunbin : on june 18 , in the training class for cadres of the department of people 's armed forces in jingjiang city , jiangsu province , the tutorial to win the psychological battle under information conditions taught by lu yuqing , chief of the xilai county department of people 's armed forces , was well received by all students taking part in the training .
this was the new change brought about by the concentrated effort of the city 's department of people 's armed forces to elevate the comprehensive qualities of the cadres of the department of people 's armed forces through charging them with heavy tasks in accordance with reality of their positions .
in the beginning of the year , during grassroots research , the party committee of the department of people 's armed forces found that some cadres of the people 's armed forces had long term of service and held too many concurrent duties , thus failed to focus their energy on doing armed forces work .
to this end , they adopted measures including centralized training , coaching seminars , and reliance on training offered by local party schools to provide regular training to cadres of the department of people 's armed forces and concentrated efforts on resolving issues including the narrow range of knowledge and one - dimensional professional qualifications of the cadres of the department of people 's armed forces .
they integrated central tasks and boldly assigned duties to cadres of the department of people 's armed forces , charged them with heavy tasks , and elevated their work abilities through on - the - job training .
at the same time , they actively coordinated with local organizations and departments and jointly formulated the program for cadres of the department of people 's armed forces to compete for job positions that clearly stipulated that chiefs of the department of armed forces must join the team of party committee at the same level and not to hold other concurrent duties ;
they established the adjustment and exchange mechanism for cadres of the department of people 's armed forces . for cadres of the department of people 's armed forces who are relatively old and cannot adapt to grassroots armed forces work , they made adjustments and exchanges immediately . for compatriots who had good comprehensive qualities and strong work abilities , they promoted and employed them .
not long ago , chen yisong , secretary of the new century shipbuilding co. , ltd. department of people 's armed forces , led the technical detachment of the militiamen in the innovative development of underwater ship welding technology that filled the gap in the country . he was promoted to the chief of the company 's department of people 's armed forces as an exception .
good start still needs to see things through
the 2-2 score was reasonable and was acceptable to the chinese team if judging from the result of the game alone . the key was that the process of the game was somewhat regrettable .
if the iranian team led by 2-0 , then the chinese team tied the score , that would definitely make chinese fans feel very differently . it would bolster a lot of morale . unfortunately , the situation was precisely the opposite .
fails to see things through can be considered as an old problem of the chinese team .
the chinese team never knows how to play under excellent situation . the general opinion is that mentally chinese players are not tough enough .
this is indeed a reason that the chinese team fails to " see things through " .
however , judging from the game that the chinese team played today , it seems that it is not necessarily so .
not only had sun jihai , sun xiang , shao jiayi , and zheng zhi played in europe before , li weifeng and the others are also battle - hardened veterans . they are experienced and knowledgeable . theoretically , there should not be any problem with their mental qualities .
this time , the chinese team was regrettably pressed to tie with the iranian team . the reason was probably the ineffectiveness in moving players on the field .
the iranian team substituted two people while they were trailing behind and the situation was immediately improved .
the chinese team also substituted three players in the second half but the outcome was not good .
in order to overcome the problem of not seeing things through , one must find the root of the problem .
as long as one identifies the problem , means to resolve it is probably not hard to find .
the only worrisome thing is to try to find a cure indiscriminately for an emergency .
if the situation continues like this , no matter how many more games the chinese team plays , it will still commit the same mistake . the continuous progress that people expect as it plays more games will be out of the question .

the details of the cooperation zones are , break away from the restrictions of authorized force of the units , and designate a unit at the brigade or regiment level in a sub - area where small , scattered , remote , and independent units are relatively concentrated to take the lead to conduct standardized planning of thematic education . units under different affiliations will attend classes together nearby or to hold long - distance discussions by means of video system .
they adopt the practice of integrating teaching rotation and competing for job positions to conduct consolidated allocation of education force . education hardware in the sub - area is put under centralized use . information and data of all units , as well as education experiences are shared and exchanged . report tours by model sub - areas and sharing of educational experiences among officers and men are regularly organized .
each cooperation unit has set up full - time education contacts and part - time education information gatherers .
on this foundation , all cooperation zones have also established systems for seeking help in difficult questions , discussions on major educational topics , notification of emergency ideological situations , and examination and assessment .
zhang shengmin , chief of the political department at the base , told reporters that the establishment of political education cooperation zones both reduces waste in educational resources and deepens educational effects .
some political instructors worry that they will lose points in front of officers and men from outside units , so they take the initiative to learn new knowledge and explore new educational methods .
officers and men being taught also actively digest educational contents in fear that they will sound unprofessional in front of officers and men from neighboring units during discussion , differentiation , and analysis .
in this case , the enthusiasm of both the educators and the ones who receive the education is effectively stimulated .

xinhua news agency , maracaibo ( venezuela ) , july 3 ( reporter liu jian )
according to report of venezuelan media on the 3rd , during an interview here , the 37 - year - old veteran goalkeeper of the u.s. team keller stated that if he cannot find a suitable club to play for after the copa america , then he will choose to retire .
" if four or six weeks after the copa america ends i still ca n't strike a deal with a top level football team that would allow me to play another season or two then retirement may be a good choice . "
with moenchengladbach relegated to germany 's second division , keller also left the team that he had played for for more than two seasons .
even though keller intends to retire , he , who is " yet to be married off " , apparently is not worried about the next employer . he said frankly himself that currently , as many as eight clubs intend to invite him to join them .
however , the veteran goalkeeper , who had played in the spain 's first division league , the english premier league , and the germany 's first division league , stated that his final decision rests on his family , " my child is nine years old already and he followed me to three different countries and studied in three different schools . my choice now must seek what 's the best for my family . "
in the gold cup final that just ended recently , keller had a stellar performance and helped the u.s. team won the championship .
in the copa america this year , he was still entrusted with important task by head coach bradley . however , one man alone cannot win . the u.s. team , which went to battle with " young guards " , was simply no match for strong south american teams such as argentina and paraguay . the goal that he kept was penetrated seven times in two games .
the next game against the colombian team will very probably be the last performance of the u.s. team and keller in this year 's copa america .
