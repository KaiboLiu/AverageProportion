amadi said : " we hope this meeting will bring results . "

difficulty in reaching agreement in dispute over territorial waters , military meeting between the two koreas breaks up in discord
a three - day high - level military meeting between north and south korea broke up in discord today , because both sides were immovable on the drawing of maritime borders .
the talks , held in the border city of panmunjom , entered the final day of negotiation today . north korea 's chief representative lieutenant - general kim yong - chol ( transliterated ) said : " we 've come to the conclusion that we do n't need these fruitless talks any more . "
red - faced and with an obviously displeased expression , kim yong - chol criticized south korea for intentionally avoiding discussions on drawing a new maritime border to replace the original " northern limit line . "
he alleged that the " northern limit line " was not legal .
the " northern limit line , " located in the yellow sea , was set by the american military in 1953 after the end of the korean war . however , in recent years it has become a focus of dispute between the two koreas , and north korea has further refused to recognize it .
north korea says that south korean warships have illegally invaded these waters , causing tension . south korea calls this accusation groundless .
conflict broke out in local waters in june , 1999 , causing the deaths of dozens of north korean sailors .
in june 2002 there was again news of a similar conflict . six south koreans were unfortunately killed .
us treasury secretary arrives on visit to china ; environmental protection and exchange rates are focuses of concern
us treasury secretary paulson arrived yesterday on a visit to china . the us is currently doing all it can to persuade china to carry out further necessary economic reforms and work on environmental protection . the renminbi exchange rate is an issue that will receive particular attention .
us diplomats say that paulson first visited xining , capital city of china 's large northwestern province of qinghai .
china is currently carrying out a series of plans for environmental protection near the largest freshwater lake in qinghai province .
today paulson will move on to beijing to discuss pushing for progress in the us - china strategic economic dialogue started last year and other issues with chinese chief officials .
the us - china strategic economic dialogue mainly discusses economic , environmental protection and other issues . yet , the most important is the issue of the renminbi exchange rate . us congressmen believe that the renminbi is excessively undervalued .
the trade deficit between the us and china is quickly escalating . internal pressure within the us is gradually rising , and congressmen are ready to take retributive action to resist what they call china 's unfair trade policies .
last week the us senate finance committee overwhelmingly approved a bill requiring the treasury to identify a list of countries with " fundamentally misaligned " currency exchange rates . this opens the door for potential economic sanctions to be brought against beijing .
us congressmen say that the renminbi is undervalued , which makes the price of goods that china sells to the us extremely cheap , and adds to the trade imbalance between the us and china . last year the us 's trade deficit with china reached 232.5 billion us dollars .

experts think insurance qdiis will not divert funds away from domestic stock market in the short term
chinanews.com , july 30
according to a report in china securities journal , the provisional measure for the overseas investment with insurance funds was recently published , and insurance funding has greater room for operation in the capital markets .
china life insurance company 's chief investment officer liu lefei thinks that with the renminbi appreciation and the domestic capital markets improving , insurance institutions will not make large investments overseas through foreign currency purchases in the short term . this also means that insurance qdiis will not divert funds away from the domestic stock market in the short term .
the report says that quite a few insurance institutions hold the same view .
experts say that because there is currently no renminbi derivatives market as yet , and the risk - avoidance techniques of insurance institutions are not sufficient , the time is not yet ripe for large - scale foreign currency purchases .
liu lefei says that in the long term , in terms of asset allocation , overseas investment should occupy a certain proportion of an insurance company 's overall allocation .
however , given the fairly large upwards pressure on the renminbi at present , china life would mainly be using its own funds in foreign currencies for making overseas investment .
in the current situation it should take a cautious attitude toward purchasing foreign currencies to invest overseas .

bian implies criticism of judiciary getting involved in elections ; taiwan 's " judicial yuan " denies it and demands his explaination
chinanews.com , july 31 on the 30th chen shui - bian questioned that members of the judiciary on the island may have tried to get involved in elections for leaders in the taiwan region .
kao chin - chih , director - general of taiwan 's " department of judicial administration , " said on the same day that the current behavior of judges on the island was not as chen shui - bian said , and demanded that chen shui - bian give an explanation of his comments .
according to reports in taiwan 's united daily , chen shui - bian questioned on the 30th that for political reasons or electoral considerations , judges , prosecutors or investigators may be interfering with , affecting or even trying to control the campaign activities of candidates from all parties . he said he hoped that this kind of phenomenon did not exist in taiwan , but that it was perhaps extremely difficult .
weng yueh - sheng , " president of the judicial yuan " in taiwan , kept quiet and made no response to chen shui - bian 's questions , but " secretary - general " fan kuang - chun sent kao chin - chih to make a statement on behalf of the " judicial yuan . "
kao chin - chih said that taiwan 's basic law and the " regulations for judges " both explicitly state that judges should be above party factions , must not take part in political party activities , and must not campaign , either . judges were all extremely prudent and respected these relevant restrictions , and the " judicial yuan " believed that judges all acquit themselves admirably .
kao chin - chih gave an example , saying that " high court kaohsiung branch court " judge chang sheng - hsi took part in a class at the ketagalan institute a few years ago , the self - regulation council organized by judges decided to punish him because the relevant syllabus had political party implications .
once chang sheng - hsi wanted to take part in the dpp primaries , but because of controversy over retaining his position and taking part in the election , he decided in the end to give up on it .
kao chin - chih believes that if it 's specific judgments in cases , there is relief available at the court level , and one should not infer that judges have political intentions simply based on wins or losses in the verdicts .
germany plans to lower threshold for bringing in professionals
staff writer , berlin , july 1 ( correspondent wang huaicheng )
german federal minister of education and research schavan said recently that germany should lower the qualifying conditions for bringing in foreign professionals in the immigration law and solve the problem of the shortage of professionals that germany is facing through increasing the recruitment of foreign talents .
according to a report by oecd , by 2010 the number of workers between age 15 and 64 in germany will be gradually decreasing each year .
if there are not enough immigrants , the labor force in germany in 2020 will decrease by 6 % as compared with the present .
however , reports by organizations such as the german employers association and the german association of engineers show that there is a relatively large shortage of engineers and professionals in the current job market in germany .
according to the statistics from germany 's federal labor department , this may , the supply of engineers in the labor market in germany had a shortfall of about 12,700 people and the supply of technicians had a shortfall of about 9,600 people .
in order to protect native employment , germany has set a relatively high threshold for bringing in foreign talents .
germany 's immigration law stipulates that professionals from non - eu countries should have annual salaries of no less than 85,500 euros in germany , otherwise they cannot get the permit to work and live in germany .
schavan suggests that this qualifying amount be reduced to 40,000 to 60,000 euros .
do n't blindly worship legal " theory circle "
it is stipulated in article 8 of the draft amendment of the lawyers law which has been recently submitted to the npc standing committee for review that people who were once engaged in the profession of researching and teaching laws and have obtained advanced professional titles or equivalent professional levels may be granted the permission to practice law when their applications for lawyers ' licenses pass the review by the judicial administrative department of the state council .
( june 28 , the china youth daily )
in the legal community there is a distinction between the " theory circle " and the " practice circle . " the former mainly includes the " abstract activities " such as teaching and researching laws , while the latter is more engaged in the " concrete activities " such as litigation , legal counseling , and legal services .
for a long time there has existed a phenomenon of " scholars ' mutual contempt " between the legal " theory circle " and the " practice circle . " the " theory circle " believes that the " practice circle " lacks the necessary legal training and consists only of mechanical " legalists , " while the " practice circle " criticizes the " theory circle " by pointing out that " theory cannot direct practice . "
with regard to such a labor division , what the law can do is to maintain neutrality rather than vigorously support either party .
however , the " system of specially licensed lawyers " in the lawyers law acknowledges in reality the judgment that the legal " theory circle " is superior to the legal " practice circle . "
in fact , some experts and scholars who have been engaged in the research and teaching of pure legal theories such as the history of the legal system and the international laws have nothing to do with practicing law no matter how profound their theoretical achievements have been .
thus , the " system of specially licensed lawyers " has doubtlessly opened up a " bad loophole " for confusing qualification in the legal " practice circle " which will have an extremely negative impact .
there is also more blind worship of the " theory circle " than these . for example , the phenomenon that expert opinions and expert panels frequently influence and even negate court rulings is also a direct manifestation of such blind worship .

britain lowers terrorist attack alert level
staff writer , london , july 5 ( correspondent guo lin )
on the 4th , the british government lowered the terrorist attack alert level from the highest level to the " severe " level . this shows that terrorist attacks in britain will not be imminent , but attacks are still " highly likely . "
at present , the british police has shifted its scope of investigation to india and australia .
since the eight terrorist attack suspects that have been arrested had all worked in the medical system , the government will conduct an emergency investigation of the backgrounds of foreign immigrants who have been employed in the medical system .
it was learned that nearly 90,000 people employed in the british public medical system have all obtained their qualification for practicing medicine from abroad .
in addition prime minister brown required that background checks be conducted for high - tech immigration applicants and that employers or relevant agencies shall be required to provide applicants ' background data .
keep public places from harassment of peddlers
when people go out traveling , they are looking for relaxation , freshness , and freedom , enjoying as much as possible the natural scenery and achievements of civilized society .
however , while traveling in the country , many people have experienced such nuisance as being besieged and cornered by peddlers and middlemen in public places .
whether you are getting on or off a bus or train , you invariably suffer the harassment of peddlers and some unlicensed middlemen .
they either sell chicken eggs , peanuts , or sesame seed cakes , or newspapers and magazines . in addition , many unlicensed middlemen make referrals to restaurants and lodgings , even hawking fake certificates , fake receipts , and so on .
if you do n't take them , he can chase you for several hundreds of meters as if he would rather die than fail .
in some scenic spots , many tourists also have the same experience .
before you enter the main gate , someone would come to hawk things like tourist souvenirs and small pieces of arts and crafts .
there are more scenarios of this kind after you go through the gate , which completely ruins even your best mood .
some media once reported that many foreign tourists coming to xi'an praised endlessly the places of historic interest and scenic beauty in xi'an , but felt it was incomprehensible that crowds of peddlers are allowed to hawk their wares everywhere .
such public places including bus stations and scenic spots are places meant for traveling and recreation . attention should be paid to civility and orderliness as well as tranquility and harmony , providing tourists a comfortable and relaxing environment .
the unrestricted entry and exit of peddlers not only disturb the mood of tourists , but also actually destroy the public order of these public places , giving rise to the visual contamination and environmental contamination , while providing the conditions and opportunities for lawless people to make trouble .
the important thing is that these public places are the windows of spiritual civilization construction in the local areas . a small glimpse can reveal a larger picture . not only the image is being damaged but the growth of local economy will also be impacted .
just imagine , if you want to expand and strengthen the tourism industry but welcome guests traveling from all directions with such a messy tourist environment , who will still want to come , and who still dare to come ?
then how can your tourist economy gain returns ?
as the tourist high season approaches , creating a civilized tourist environment for tourists coming from all directions should be considered the top priority .
public places are not markets . the operation by peddlers should be regulated . unlicensed operation must be resolutely banned , and there should be relentless crackdown on illegal activities .
only a civilized and orderly environment can get tourists to come happily , who will leave after fully enjoying themselves and keep the passion for a return trip .
in a word , keep public places from the harassment of peddlers .
" rewarding voluntary withdrawal from welfare system " does not hold water
the jianguomen neighborhood in dongcheng district of beijing gave away things like refrigerators as rewards to twelve households that voluntarily withdrew from the welfare system .
( the beijing news , july 10 )
while feeling happy for these families for the improvement of their lives , this writer is ambivalent toward the proposal of " voluntary withdrawal from the welfare system " and the " reward - giving " method .
the deputy director of the jianguomen neighborhood office said , " in response to the issue of the welfare fraud , encouraging voluntary withdrawal from the welfare system aims to set a good example for other households on welfare . "
if it is to encourage other welfare recipients to get out of their difficult situations through their own efforts , then this example is indeed worth promoting . if this is intended to " appeal " to those longtime cheaters of the welfare system , then it may be a bit naive .
working to distinguish between real and fake welfare recipients and sort them out , we should rely more on the law .
the relevant department should stress the obligations that welfare recipients must carry out while enjoying the welfare : for example , promptly notifying the changes in the family members and incomes , reporting the status of employment , accepting regular reviews , etc. on the other hand , the relevant department should step up monitoring and inspection .
after all , only " withdrawing from the welfare system according to the law " is the long - term strategy .
who will foot the bill for the material rewards given by the neighborhood to the households that withdrew from the welfare system ?
as a level - one government organization , the neighborhood 's expenses are covered by the funding from the government budget .
however , is it legitimate to spend this sum of tax payers ' money ?
on the one hand , households that have withdrawn from the welfare system prove that they have attained certain abilities to be " self - sufficient ; " on the other hand , are n't there still people who apply for the welfare ?
the funding from the government budget which is called " life - saving " money should be used to provide timely help instead of extra bonus .
liu gangyi 's remark about his willingness to be a service provider is more believable
on july 10 , liu gangyi , the party committee secretary of mulan township , xindu district , chengdu city , who is the first township party committee secretary through public nomination and direct election in the whole country , received his fourth democratic evaluation since he took office . the rate of satisfaction reached 97 % .
during his conversation with reporters , liu gangyi defined himself as a " service provider . "
( yesterday , the beijing news )
the " service provider " as spoken by liu gangyi is probably more truthful and more believable than the " service provider " as spoken by some appointed cadres .
the greatest advantage of public nomination and direct election as compared with the system of appointment lies in the fact that in the former the source of power is mainly determined by ordinary party members and the masses , while in the latter it is mainly appointed by upper - level organizations . and where the power originates determines that the former must take its responsibility to the general public as top priority .
the source of power and to whom they should answer are the basic factors that determine how the elected will go about their work .
some people suspect that this kind of " democratic evaluation " is more like a " democracy show . "
my opinion is that it is better to have this form of " democratic evaluation " than nothing at all .
considering the history and current status of china 's grassroots democratic and political construction , i think that it is already a major breakthrough to have public nomination and direction election . being a major component of this innovation , the democratic evaluation is not to be underestimated in promoting the grassroots democratic and political construction .
first woman president expected to be elected in india ; analysts call her election quite likely ; female voters hope she can raise the status of women
on june 23 , patil brought her hands together palm to palm before she filled the presidential candidate documents .
india 's presidential election kicked off on the 19th . the new president will be chosen between the current vice president shekhawat and pratibha patil , who recently resigned as governor of rajasthan .
patil is the first woman presidential candidate in the history of india . if she is elected , she will become the first woman president ever in the indian history .
patil is the presidential candidate for the ruling party inc , while shekhawat is from the opposition party bjp .
since the inc occupies a dominant position in the presidential electoral college , the media and the general public all speculate that patil is rather likely to be elected .
patil , currently 72 years old , was a woman governor of rajasthan .
she was born into a lawyer 's family and entered the parliament in 1985 . with rich experiences in politics , she was well acclaimed by the government during her tenure as governor of rajasthan .
in addition she is devoted to the social welfare and is the honorary chairperson of many cultural , educational , and social welfare organizations .
analysts pointed out that the reason why patil became a candidate is because she has remained loyal to the inc president sonia gandhi .
in india the gandhi family has controlled the ruling inc party for a long time .
patil is supported and respected by a large number of female voters . female voters believe that patil will reshape the image of women and raise the status of women in india , where discrimination against females is a dominant ideology .
the constitution stipulates that india is a federal - system country . the president is the nominal head of state and commander of the armed forces , representing no party organization and serving more as a symbol .

climate change leads to rapid shrinking of alps glacier
staff writer , geneva , july 29 ( correspondent liu jun )
a long - term follow - up research by glacier experts at the swiss academy of sciences found that from 1850 to 2005 the 1,800 plus glaciers in switzerland were shrinking at an annual rate of 3 % .
the heat wave in 2003 alone caused the alps glacier to melt by 1.8 %
experts believe that if the global temperature rises by 3 degrees celsius by 2100 , the glaciers will have shrunk by 80 % compared with the present and that with a temperature rise of 5 degrees celsius , the glaciers will have entirely melted .
the aletsch glacier is the longest glacier in europe and has been inscribed on the list of the unesco natural world heritage . however , from 2005 to 2006 , it shrank by 100 meters within a year . there can be no more delay in protecting the natural environment .

on july 1 , the eternal warning bell in the memorial hall of nanjing 's jinghai temple was tolled once again , the sound of the bell ringing melodiously .
this rich echo of history connected the mainland and hong kong via television , as the citizens of nanjing and hong kong compatriots " shared the same occasion from the far corners of the earth " and celebrated together the tenth anniversary of hong kong 's reversion to the motherland .
ten years previously , at 12:00 a.m. on july 1 , the sound of the tolling of the eternal warning bell reverberated 155 times in the sky over the bell tower of the memorial hall of nanjing 's jinghai temple , bidding farewell to the humiliating history of the cession of hong kong island .

russia 's security service accuses exiled oligarch berezovsky of " plotting to launch a coup d'etat "
a lawyer for berezovsky , the russian oligarch in exile in london , borovkov , announced on july 2 that the russian federal security service had formally issued a new charge against his client , accusing berezovsky of " plotting to engineer a coup d'état and attempting a violent seizure of political power in russia . "
borovkov pointed out that in april this year berezovsky had announced during an interview with a journalist from the british " guardian " newspaper that he was preparing to launch a " palace coup " in russia , and confirmed that he was providing financial support to representatives of the right - wing elite opposed to the policies of the administration .
the russian federal security service 's investigation bureau immediately launched a criminal investigation against berezovsky under article 278 on " forcible seizure of power " of the penal code of the russian federation , and has formally brought forward related charges in moscow 's savyolovsky court recently .
it is reported that the russian procuratorate - general brought criminal charges against berezovsky in february 2006 , similarly based on the exiled oligarch 's confirmation during an interview that he was attempting a seizure of state power by force in russia .
as berezovsky has remained in exile abroad , making it impossible to extradite him , russia authorities temporarily suspended the investigation of the case in january 2007 .
on july 2 , moscow 's savyolovsky court began to hear another criminal case against the exiled oligarch . the russian procuratorate - general accused berezovsky of embezzling funds of 214 million roubles from aeroflot and laundering 16 million roubles . after the hearing the court decided to postpone judicial investigation into this case till july 12 , and a state defense lawyer will be assigned for the defendant in this period .
berezovsky believes that this is all a " farce , " and has explicitly prohibited his defense lawyer from taking part in the court hearings .

number of reports of adverse reactions caused by diabetic medicine , avandia , increases sharply
according to a report in the us media on the 15th , there has recently been a trend in the us towards a sharp increase in the number of reports of heart diseases and other adverse reactions caused by avandia , an anti - diabetic medicine .
in may this year the us food and drug administration issued a safety warning , recommending that sufferers from diabetes exercise caution when using avandia , because a scientist had published a research report in the edition of the new england journal of medicine that came out on may 21 , saying that this best - selling drug could greatly increase the incidence of and death rate from heart disease among sufferers .
consequently , the safety of avandia has received close attention by doctors and patients .
statistics show that in the approximately one month following the issuing of the safety warning , the us fda had received 357 reports of adverse reactions caused by avandia , of which 38 were reports of deaths .
and yet the fda had received just 50 and 73 reports of adverse reactions in january and february this year respectively .
these adverse reactions ranged from being as trivial as getting blisters to as serious as sudden deaths from heart disease .
however , the us fda 's pharmaceuticals experts believe that it would currently be premature to reach the conclusion that avandia is not safe .
the fda will hold a hearing into the safety of avandia on july 30 .
avandia , which came on the market in 1999 , is an insulin sensitizer , suitable for treating type 2 diabetes .
some 6 million diabetes sufferers worldwide have taken or are taking avandia .
avandia 's producer , the british company glaxosmithkline , continues to believe that avandia is safe , and that for suffers " the benefits outweigh the drawbacks . "

us department of defense reconsiders plans to reduce us troops in europe
an official in the us department of defense said on the 23rd that due to the iraq war and changes in the world situation , the us department of defense is reconsidering a plan drawn up in 2002 to cut the number of us troops in europe by approximately half .
the us media cited a department of defense official as saying that due to the ongoing iraq war and the worsening us relations with russia and iran , department of defense leaders have raised doubts about the feasibility of plans to cut troops in europe .
in 2002 the then secretary of defense rumsfield announced that the us would reduce troop numbers in europe from the original 113,000 to 71,000 before 2012 , in order to create a new - style army with " fewer , but better " soldiers .
the us army 's total forces in europe have currently fallen to 100,000 people .
but in june this year , commander craddock of the us army headquarters in europe submitted a report to the current secretary of defense , gates , raising doubts over the above - mentioned reduction plan .
the report said that while us army forces are being reduced in europe , many military units would be deployed on a rotation basis to iraq and afghanistan for combat , leading to a shortfall in us troops in europe to such an extent that there would be no way to develop normal cooperation with european allies .
the report recommended halting the plan to reduce us troops in europe .
relevant us experts believe that the above - mentioned phenomenon shows that the prolonged and unresolved iraq war has disrupted the original us military 's restructuring plans .

three main functions of modern military uniform
the first is the identification function .
it is an important sign that distinguishes the armies of different countries , different military services , and between the military and civilians .
in the armies of more than 100 large and small countries of the world , although the use of military uniform is basically identical , there are no two countries ' armies whose military uniforms are completely the same .
the second is the symbolic function .
to a certain extent , military uniform is both a reflection of a country 's mental outlook and its national characteristics , and is also a concentrated embodiment of a country 's military ability to wage war and the quality of its servicemen .
in the three main types of military uniform -- ceremonial attire , everyday uniforms , and drill uniforms -- the one that can express national prestige and military prestige to the fullest extent is none other than ceremonial attire that is well - pressed and pleasing to the eye .
the third is the protective function .
with the rapid development of high - tech and updated weaponry , improving the overall protective capacity of new - style drill uniforms to give military uniform various types of functions -- including bulletproofing , stealth protection , anti - chemical , anti - bacterial and anti - radiation functions , as well as control of the temperature , humidity and the air -- has become a key issue in the development of military uniform .

a brigade party committee organ has the courage to handle thorny issues properly
staff writer , chengdu , july 3
report by qu yimao and yang ruiyu : " we can now move into apartments as a result of the brigade party committee organ 's resolution and boldness in freeing up the apartments . "
today , more than ten cadres in a communications drill brigade in chengdu military command were all beaming with pleasure as they moved into apartments . they felt full of admiration and gratitude for the way the " group " on the brigade party committee dared to confront tough obstacles in solving thorny issues .
over the past few years , along with the replacement of personnel , an excessive part of the brigade 's accommodation for family members had been occupied against regulations , making it difficult to house the cadres on active duty . officers and men had quite strong views about this .
the brigade had tried to free up the apartments several times , but failed to get it done each time due to all kinds of obstruction , allowing the problem to become a long - standing , big and difficult issue .
" as long as we have the courage to do things properly and are fair and reasonable , there are no difficulties we cannot solve . "
after the group on the new party committee had reached a consensus , the principal leaders appeared in person and set about thoroughly sorting out all the problems relating to occupation of apartments against regulations .
on the one hand they appealed to people 's emotions and explained their reasoning , hoping that the personnel concerned would consider the whole picture ; on the other hand , they explained the policies and regulations relating to military apartments , apartments built with pooled money , and economical and adequate apartments , to show the party committee 's staunch determination and principled stance .
in the case of personnel who had accommodation elsewhere and were not willing to leave the additional apartments they occupied , the party committee organ promptly made contact with the work units they were in and adopted relevant measures to encourage them to take the initiative in cooperating with the work of the army .
over two months of meticulous work , all residents occupying additional apartments in the army barracks against regulations had all moved out on schedule , and cadres who worked in the brigade were all assigned the accommodation in accordance with regulations .
the way in which this brigade party committee dared to confront tough obstacles has also given rise to a chain reaction . several cadres who originally were unwilling to actively cooperate with the organization 's allotment have now one by one also expressed their willingness to obey the organization 's decisions .

people 's armed force department in jingjiang city sets up a platform to raise the quality of their full - time cadres
staff writer , report by cao jiawei and zhu chunbin : on june 18 , at a training class for people 's armed force full - time cadres in jingjiang city in jiangsu province , lu yuqing , leader of the people 's armed force department of xilai township , delivered a training lecture " winning a psychological war under informationalized conditions " that received a unanimous favorable assessment from the trainees .
this was a new change that was brought about by the city 's people 's armed force when it has put more pressure on its cadres based on the reality of their positions in an effort to raise people 's armed force cadres ' comprehensive quality .
at the beginning of this year , the people 's armed force party committee discovered during investigation and research at the grassroots level that some of the people 's armed force cadres had served for a long time , had too many concurrent duties , and had not put their chief energies into the armed force work .
for this reason , they have adopted methods including centralized training , replacing training with meetings , and relying on local party schools to conduct training , thus regularly training military cadres , in an effort to resolve problems such as the narrow knowledge base and the uniform focus of the professional quality of military cadres .
in combination with the central work , they boldly assign tasks to military cadres and put more pressure on them , and raise their performance by on - the - job training .
at the same time , they have actively coordinated with local organizational departments and jointly drafted the " people 's armed forces cadres ' competition for jobs scheme , " and explicitly stipulated that the leaders of people 's armed forces departments must join the party committee of the same level and cannot concurrently take on other jobs .
they have set up a military cadres ' restructuring exchange mechanism to promptly regulate exchanges on some older military cadres who are not suitable for grassroots people 's armed forces work , and promote and use some comrades of good comprehensive quality and strong work ability .
not long ago , a domestic gap was filled by the underwater boat - welding technology invented and developed by the people 's militia technology platoon under the leadership of the secretary of the armed department of the new century shipbuilding company limited , chen yisong , who was exceptionally promoted as the company 's armed department leader .
when you start well , you still need to finish well
judging simply from the result of the match , 2-2 seems a reasonable score , and is also one that the chinese team can accept . the key problem is that the way the match went made people feel it was rather a pity .
if the iranian team had taken a 2-0 lead , then the chinese team had evened up the score , then the feeling that would have given china 's sports fans would certainly have been different . it would have boosted morale . the pity was that the situation was precisely the opposite .
you could say that starting well but being unable to finish well is an old problem of the chinese team .
the chinese team often do n't kick the ball when they have an excellent chance , and most people 's view is that the psychological quality of china 's players is not really up to it .
this is actually one reason why the chinese team cannot " finish well . "
however , judging by the chinese team 's match today , it may not be quite so .
even if we set aside the fact that sun jihai , sun xiang , shao jiayi , zheng zhi and others have played in europe , li weifeng and others are also old - timers with long experience of the battlefield . they have experience and knowledge , and so it would be reasonable to say that there should not be any problem with their psychological quality .
the reason why the chinese team was regrettably forced to a draw by the iranian team this time may be because they deployed their forces in a lackadaisical manner at key points of the match .
when the iranian team were behind , they substituted two persons , and the scene immediately seemed different .
in the second half , the chinese team also substituted three players , but without a positive effect .
to overcome the problem of starting well but being unable to finish well , it is definitely necessary to pinpoint the source of the problem .
as long as the problem is correctly grasped , it will probably not be difficult to find a way to get rid of the problem .
the worst thing when you have a serious illness is just to go to see any doctor .
if they carry on like this , no matter how many matches the chinese team play , the old problem will still continue , and the constant progress with every game that everyone expects will be out of the question .

" small , scattered , far and direct " education coordination zones go into operation in a second artillery unit base
staff writer , report by xue bingjian and correspondent xu yeqing : the situation in the " small , scattered , far and direct " units where education organization is difficult , resources are meager , and each fends for itself , will become history at a second artillery unit base .
this correspondent learned recently that following a half - year pilot project , this base has handed down " the method of fully implementing ' an outline for ideological and political education ' . " a number of ideological and political education coordination zones covering all the " small , scattered , far and direct " units in the base have officially been brought into operation .
in order to push ahead with the effective implementation of " an outline for ideological and political education , " the base organized resources at the beginning of the year to conduct in - depth investigation and research of the ideological and political education situation in " small , scattered , far and direct " units . they combed through important issues that influence and restrict the education time , personnel and results , and initially established this new - style education model of coordination zones for the " small , scattered , far and direct " units .
the concrete approach of coordination zones is to break down the organizational boundaries among units and set up a brigade and regiment - level unit to take the lead in the areas where the " small , scattered , far and direct " units are relatively concentrated , and conduct an integrated program for thematic education , with units falling under different hierarchies coming together in nearby places for lectures or using the help of video link - up systems for remote discussions .
they have adopted a method that integrates taking turns in giving lessons and competing for posts , and unifying the allocation of educational resources . in each area the use of educational hardware will be integrated , and each unit 's materials , data and educational experiences will be shared and exchanged with those of others , with regular organization in each area of typical tour reports and exchanges of what they got from the study by the officers and men .
every coordination zone has set up a devoted educational liaison person and a part - time educational information gatherer .
on this basis , each coordination zone has also set up systems for seeking assistance on difficult issues , holding joint discussions on major educational themes , reporting critical ideological situations , and assessing tests and evaluations .
zhang shengmin , the director of the base 's political department , told this correspondent that constructing political education coordination zones has both reduced the waste of educational resources and deepened the impact of education .
some political instructors fear they will lose marks in front of officers and men from other units and have taken the initiative to study new things and seek new educational methods .
the officers and men receiving the education have also enthusiastically digested the educational content , out of concern over expressing themselves in layman 's language in front of the officers and men of friendly neighboring units during discussion and analysis .
in this way , the enthusiasm of the people giving and receiving education has been both effectively stimulated .

doing things openly in a ji'nan military command unit takes heat off " hot - button issues "
staff writer
report by wang weiqin and specially contracted correspondent li deying : on july 25 , this writer observed in a service support company of the ji'nan military command that invitations for an army engineering tender , details of financial expenditure , promotions of cadres , non - commissioned officers being admitted to the party and other major matters were written up on a bulletin board , and hung up conspicuously in a display cabinet .
as political commissar su chengsen explained , this is a concrete measure adopted by the section to promote a system where things are done openly .
at the beginning of this year , the unit party committee drew up measures including " two - way supervision between the organization and the grassroots " and " publicizing sensitive issues " to strengthen the construction of the party spirit and honest government , requiring that for all significant issues that involve the direct interests of the officers and men and army development , the opinions of grassroots officers and men are first heard before decisions are reached , and that standards , procedures , and results etc of the handling of the matters are made public from start to finish in line with the circumstances .
the unit has installed a suggestion box and a bulletin board , and has opened a " message board " on its intranet to collect everyone 's views and recommendations in an extensive way .
at the beginning of the year , as the renovation project of the soldiers ' barracks was about to start , before the work began , the party committee organ extensively solicited the views of the officers and men , and then released the information on inviting bids , implementing a system of open tenders .
this both saved money and won the support of the officers and men .
doing things in an open and fair way has driven the formation of a good atmosphere at the grassroots .
in this unit , the grassroots company insists on making regular public announcements and notices , no matter whether they are issues as big as the determination of " hot - button " sensitive matters , or as trivial as personal vacations to visit relatives or daily income and expenditure in the mess accounts , thus taking the initiative to receive the supervision of the masses .

" my kid is already 9 years old . he has followed me around and stayed in three different countries , and has been to three different schools , and so i need to consider in my current choice what would be better for my family . "
in the gold cup competition that was concluded not long ago , keller put in an outstanding performance , helping the us team to win the title .
in the current america 's cup , he has , just as before , been given an important job to do by head coach bradley , but he clearly cannot win the match singlehanded . the us team , made up of " young guards , " is no match for such strong south american opponents as argentina and paraguay , and during these two matches the goal he guarded was breached seven times .
the next match against colombia will probably be the us team 's and keller 's last performance in this america 's cup competition .
