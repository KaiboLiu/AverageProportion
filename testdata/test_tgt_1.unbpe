with minutes and seconds going by , the situation saw a positive development with south korean officials launching talks with the taliban today for the first time .

the taliban calls for germany and south korea to withdraw their troops from afghanistan , and demands 33 guerrillas imprisoned by the afghan government in exchange for these hostages .
taliban spokesperson ahmadi said in a telephone interview with afp from an unknown location , " we have come in direct contact with the south korean representatives through tribal elders . "
" we hope the talks this time will achieve results , " said ahmadi .

consensus on sea conflict tough to reach ; military talks between two koreas end on bad terms
the three - day high - level military talks between the two koreas , south korea and north korea , ended on bad terms today , as a result of each side sticking to its own views regarding marking the sea border .
the talks , held in the border city of panmunjom , today entered the last day on the agenda . north korea 's chief delegate lieutenant general kim yong - chol ( transliterated ) said , " we concluded that we no longer need these fruitless talks . "
kim yong - chol , obviously displeased with a flushed face , attacked south korea for deliberately avoiding the discussion of drawing a new sea border to replace the existing " northern limit line . "
he pointed out that the " northern limit line " is not legitimate .
located in the yellow sea , the " northern limit line " was drawn by the us military in 1953 when the korean war ended . however , it has become a focus of dispute between the two koreas in recent years , with north korea even unwilling to recognize it .
north korea said that south korea 's warships have entered its territorial waters illegally , triggering a tense situation ; south korea claimed this accusation to be groundless .
a conflict broke out in the local waters in june 1999 , causing dozens of north korean crew members to lose their lives .
a similar clash occurred again in june 2002 , with six south koreans sadly killed .
us treasury secretary arrives in china for visit ; environmental protection and exchange rate are main points of concern
us treasury secretary paulson arrived in china yesterday for a visit . the us is currently making full efforts to convince china to further implement necessary economic reforms and environmental protection work , in particular the renminbi exchange rate issue that has received a lot of attention .
a us diplomat said that paulson first went to visit xining city , capital of qinghai , a large province in northwest china .
china is currently implementing a series of environmental protection programs near the largest salt - water lake in qinghai .
paulson moved on to beijing today , discussing with chinese leading officials such topics as advancing the course of the " us - china strategic economic dialogue " launched last year .
the " us - china strategic economic dialogue " mainly discusses topics such as the economy and environmental protection , though most important is the renminbi exchange rate issue . us congressional representatives think that the renminbi is excessively undervalued .
the us - china trade deficit is currently seeing a rapid , sharp increase . pressure in the us is gradually increasing , with congressional representatives ready to take retaliatory action to oppose their so - called unfair trade policies of china .
last week , the us senate finance committee passed a motion by an overwhelming vote requesting the treasury department to identify a list of countries whose exchange rate is in " fundamental misalignment , " opening the door to potentially imposing economic sanctions against beijing .
us congressional representatives say that the undervalued renminbi makes goods sold from china to the us very cheap , aggravating the us - china trade imbalance . the us trade deficit with china last year reached us$ 232.5 billion .

chinanews.com , july 30
according to a china securities journal report , with the introduction of the provisional measures for administration of outbound investment of insurance funds a few days ago , insurance funds have more space to utilize the capital markets .
liu lefei , chief investment officer of china life insurance co. ltd. , believes that with renminbi appreciation and positive trends in domestic capital markets , insurance institutions in the near future will not make large - scale overseas investments with foreign exchange purchases . this also indicates that qdii insurers will not divert domestic stock market capital in the near future .
the report said that many insurance institutions share the same view .
experts believe that as there is currently no market for renminbi derivatives , insurance institutions have insufficient means of avoiding risk . as a result , it is not time yet for large - scale foreign exchange purchases .
liu lefei said that in terms of capital allocation , outbound investment should make up a certain ratio of overall allocations for insurance companies in the long run .
however , in view of relatively strong pressure for renminbi appreciation at present , china life will mainly use its own foreign exchange funds for outbound investments .
foreign exchange purchases for outbound investment should be handled carefully under the current situation .

kao chin - chih gave an example , noting that judge jang shenq - shii of kaohsiung " branch high court " participated a few years ago in a course conducted by the ketagalan school , and was punished because the course was tainted by a political party . the punishment resolution was by a self - disciplinary committee composed of judges .
jang shenq - shii once wanted to take part in dpp primary elections , and eventually decided to give up because there was controversy over his election participation while working .
kao chin - chih thinks that if the ruling of an individual case can be appealed to a higher court for relief , it cannot be inferred that a judge has political motives based only on whether the ruling is a win or a loss .
germany plans to lower barriers for bringing in specialized skilled workers
staff report , berlin , july 1 ( correspondent wang huaicheng )
german education and research minister schavan said a few days ago that germany should lower the immigration law restrictions on bringing in foreign specialized skilled workers , using an introduction of foreign talent to solve germany 's specialized skilled worker shortage problems .
according to an oecd report , by 2010 , germany 's labor force between 15 and 64 years old will be shrinking yearly .
without enough immigrants , germany 's labor force by 2020 will be 6 % smaller than now .
however , reports from organizations such as the federation of german employers ' associations and the association for german engineers show that there is a relatively large shortage in the current german labor market for engineers and specialized technology workers .
according to data from the german federal labor agency , the german labor market had a supply shortage of about 12,700 engineers and a supply shortage of about 9,600 technicians in may of this year .
germany has set high barriers for the introduction of foreign skilled workers in order to protect local employment .
germany 's immigration law states that specialized skilled workers from non - eu countries cannot earn less than 85,500 euros per year in germany , or else cannot obtain german work and residency permits .
schavan proposed bringing this limit down to between 40,000 and 60,000 euros .
do n't believe blindly in the " theoretical field " of law
clause 8 of the revised draft of the law on lawyers , which was recently submitted to the standing committee of the national people 's congress for review , states : those who have undertaken specialized work such as legal research or teaching and had a high - level title or the equivalent , upon application to become a lawyer can be allowed to practice law after examination and verification by the state council 's judicial administrative department .
( june 28 , china youth daily )
in law , there is the " theoretical field " and the " practical field . " the former mainly includes " abstract actions " such as legal teaching and research work , while the latter undertakes more " concrete actions " such as litigation , legal consultation , and legal services .
for a long time , " intellectual disparagement " has existed between the " theoretical field " and " practical field " of law . the " theoretical field " thinks that the " practical field " lacks necessary accomplishment in the law and are only mechanical " legalists " ; meanwhile , the response of the " practical field " to criticism by the " theoretical field " is " theory cannot guide practice . "
concerning this kind of division of labor gap , what the law can do is stay neutral instead of giving strong support to either side .
however , the " specially licensed lawyer system " in the law on lawyers objectively recognizes a judgment that the law 's " theoretical field " is above the law 's " practical field . "
the fact is that some experts and scholars who are engaged in researching and teaching of pure legal theory , such as history of the legal system and international law , do not fit with practical law regardless of their depth of theoretical attainment .
in this way , for the law 's " practical field , " the " specially licensed lawyer system " no doubt opens a " bad door " which very negatively influences chaos in qualifications .
this is not the only blind belief about the " theoretical field . " the phenomenon of expert opinions and expert panel discussions frequently influencing and even overruling court rulings is another direct manifestation of this kind of blind belief .

do not let peddlers spoil public places
when out on a trip , one wants to feel relaxed , refreshed , and free , enjoying to the utmost the fruits of natural scenery and society 's civilization .
however , many people encounter this kind of vexation when traveling domestically : being chased and intercepted by peddlers and middlemen in public places .
whether on autos or trains , boarding or alighting , there are constant entanglements with small peddlers and some unlicensed middlemen .
if they are not selling eggs , peanuts , or sesame seed cakes , they are selling newspapers and magazines . there are also many unlicensed middlemen introducing restaurants and hotels , even peddling fake certificates and fake receipts , among other things .
if you do not accept , he can chase you for a few hundred meters , like someone ready to die for a just cause in the face of failure .
at some scenic spots , many tourists also have the same feeling .
prior to entering the main gate , people come to peddle things like travel souvenirs and small crafts .
after entering , there is more of this kind of situation . no matter how good your mood , you will be bothered to the point of losing interest .
media have reported that many foreign tourists in xi'an sing endless praise for the scenic spots and historic sites of xi'an , but cannot understand why masses of small peddlers and hawkers are allowed to sell everywhere .
public places including bus stations and scenic spots are at root places for trips and relaxation . they should be civilized , orderly , quiet , harmonious , providing tourists a comfortable and relaxed environment .
peddlers ' freedom to come and go not only affects the mood of tourists , it also destroys the public order of these public places on an objective level , bringing about visual pollution and environmental pollution . at the same time , it also gives lawless people the condition and opportunity for creating trouble .
the important thing is , these public places are windows onto the development of local spiritual civilization . one can deduce much from little information . it is not only the image that suffers , as local economic development will be influenced as well .
just think , you want to make the tourism industry bigger and stronger , but use this kind of chaotic tourism environment to welcome guests from near and far . who still wants to come ? who dares to come ?
how can your tourism economy obtain beneficial results ?
with the coming of the peak travel season , it should be said that creating a civilized travel environment for tourists from near and far is an urgent matter .
public places are not markets . the operating behavior of small peddlers and hawkers should be standardized . put a firm stop to unlicensed operations , staunchly crack down on illegal activities .
only a civilized and orderly environment can let tourists come happily , leave satisfied , and return with excitement .
in short , do not let peddlers spoil public places .
" rewarding self - initiated exit from subsistence allowances " does not pass muster
the jianguomen neighborhood in dongcheng district , beijing , gave items such as refrigerators as a reward to 12 poor families who exited from subsistence allowances on their own initiative .
( beijing news , july 10 )
this writer feels happy for the improved lives of these families , but has mixed feelings about the phrase " self - initiated exit from subsistence allowances , " and the practice of " giving rewards . "
an assistant director of the jianguomen neighborhood said , " in light of problems like cheating on subsistence allowances , encouraging the self - initiated exit from subsistence allowances sets an example for other poor families . "
this example is indeed worth promoting if it encourages other poor people to get out of their predicaments through one 's own hard work ; it is really somewhat naïve if it is thought this will " inspire " those people who have fraudulently received subsistence allowances for a long time .
when differentiating and straightening out real and fake poor families , what should be relied on more is the law .
relevant departments should strengthen the obligations that must be met for poor families to enjoy subsistence allowances : such as immediately reporting changes in family members ' incomes , reporting employment situation , and accepting regular reviews . meanwhile , relevant departments should increase the strength of supervision and investigation .
in the end , " exit from subsistence allowance according to the law " is the long - term solution .
who pays when the neighborhood gives material rewards to families who exit from subsistence allowance ?
as a first - level governmental organization , a neighborhood has its expenses covered by financial allocations .
however , should this taxpayer money be spent ?
on the one hand , families who exit from subsistence allowances prove that they already have a certain " self - sufficient " capacity ; on the other hand , are n't there still people who are applying for subsistence allowances ?
government financial allocations , which is called a lifeline , should provide timely help rather than reward good fortune .
liu gangyi willing to be a service provider ; this is a more convincing statement
on july 10 , chengdu city xindu district mulan town party committee secretary liu gangyi , the first town party committee secretary in the country to be directly elected by the public , received his fourth review since taking office , achieving a satisfaction rate of 97 % .
liu gangyi positioned himself as a " service provider " during a conversation between this correspondent and liu gangyi .
( yesterday , beijing news )
" service provider " in the words of liu gangyi may be more real , more convincing than " service provider " in the words of some appointed cadres .
the biggest advantage of being directly elected by the public compared to appointment is that for the former , determination of power mainly originates with ordinary party members and the public , whereas for the latter , nominations are mainly by superior organizations . therefore , direction of the power source determines that with the former , responsibility to the public must be given top priority .
the source of power , and to whom one owes responsibility , are basic elements that determine how elected people carry out their work .
some people question whether such " democratic review " is more like a " democracy show . "
my opinion is , having this kind of " democratic review " format is better than nothing .
considering the history and current situation of china 's grassroots democratic political development , i think direct election by the public is already a major breakthrough . democratic review is an important component of this pioneering work , and should not be underestimated in promoting grassroots democratic political development .
optimism in india for electing first female president ; analysts claim relatively high possibility of election victory ; female voters hope this improves status of women
on june 23 , patil clasped her hands together before filling out the presidential candidate documents .
india 's presidential election kicked off on the 19th , with the new president to be elected from between shekhawat , the current vice president , and pratibha patil , the recently resigned governor of rajasthan state .
patil is the first female presidential candidate in the history of india . if she is elected , she will become the first female president in india 's history .
patil is the presidential candidate for the governing congress party , whereas shekhawat comes from the opposition bharatiya janata party .
since the congress party has an advantage in the presidential electoral college , the media and public largely guess that the possibility of a patil victory is higher .
patil , who is 72 years old this year , was rajasthan 's female governor .
she started out as a lawyer , entering parliament in 1985 . with abundant political work experience , she received high opinions from the government when governor of rajasthan .
she has also dedicated herself for social welfare , as honorary chairwoman for many cultural , educational , and social welfare organizations .
analysts note that patil became a candidate as a result of her unswerving loyalty to sonia ghandi , president of india 's congress party .
in india , the ghandi family has been controlling the governing congress party for a long time .
patil has received many female voters ' support . female voters believe that in india where there is a strong concept of discrimination against women , patil will remold the image of women and raise the status of women .
the constitution stipulates that the president of india , a federal country , is the country 's leader and commander - in - chief of the armed forces in name , without representing any party or organization . it is more of a symbol .

weather changes cause alps glaciers to shrink rapidly
staff report , geneva , july 29 ( correspondent liu jun )
from their long - term trace study , glacier experts from swiss academy of sciences found that more than 1,800 swiss glaciers were shrinking at a speed of 3 % every year on average between 1850 and 2005 .

the aletsch glacier is europe 's longest glacier , and was named a unesco natural world heritage site . however , it shrunk 100 meters within one year between 2005 and 2006 . it has come to a stage where the natural environment must be protected right away .

reports of adverse reaction caused by diabetes drug avandia increase greatly in number
according to us media reports on the 15th , the number of reports in the usa of heart disease and other adverse reactions caused by the anti - diabetes drug avandia has recently seen a dramatic rise .
the us food and drug administration issued a safety warning in may this year suggesting that diabetes patients use avandia cautiously , because scientists published a research report in the issue of new england journal of medicine published on may 21 that said this blockbuster drug will greatly increase the heart disease incidence rate and death rate of patients .
as a result , the safety of avandia came under close scrutiny from doctors and patients .
statistics show within around one month of issuing the safety warning , the us fda received 357 reports of adverse reactions caused by avandia , of those 38 were fatality reports .
whereas in january and february this year , the fda received only 50 and 73 reports of adverse reactions respectively .
these adverse reactions were as minor as blistering and as major as sudden cardiac death .
however , experts at the us fda believe that now it is still early to arrive at the conclusion that avandia is unsafe .
on july 30 , the fda will hold a hearing concerning the safety of avandia .
introduced to the market in 1999 , avandia is a kind of insulin sensitizer suitable for the treatment of type ii diabetes .
in the entire world there are about six million diabetes patients who have taken or are taking avandia .
avandia 's manufacturer , the british glaxosmithkline company , has always considered that avandia is safe and that for patients " the benefits are greater than the risks . "

us department of defense reconsiders plan to cut american troops posted in europe
a us department of defense official said on the 23rd that due to the iraq war and the change in the world situation , the u.s. department of defense is currently reconsidering its plan , formulated in 2002 , to cut the number of us troops posted in europe by roughly half .
us media quoted a department of defense official saying , because the iraq war is still in progress and us relations with russia and iran have worsened , those at the leadership level of the department of defense questioned the viability of the plan to cut troops posted in europe .
in 2002 , the secretary of defense at the time , rumsfeld , announced that before 2012 the us will cut the number of troops posted in europe from the original 113,000 people to 71,000 people , in order to build a " smaller but superior " new model army .
at present , the total military strength of the us army posted in europe has already been reduced to 100,000 people .
however , in june this year , chief of staff craddock at us european command headquarter submitted a report to the current secretary of defense gates , raising doubts about the abovementioned reduction plan .
the report said that while the military strength of us troops posted in europe was being reduced , many of the units were rotated and transferred to fight in iraq and afghanistan . this caused a shortfall in us troops posted in europe and even made it impossible to carry out cooperation with their european allies as normal .
the report suggested terminating the plan to reduce us troops posted in europe .
associated experts in the united states believe that the above phenomenon indicates that the prolonged delay in resolving the iraq war has already upset the original adjustment plan of the us troops .

three main functions of modern military uniforms
one , identification function .
to distinguish the important insignia of different nations ' armies , different types of soldiers , armies and civilians .
among the armies of over 100 large and small nations in the world , although the basic use of a military uniform is the same , the military uniforms of no two countries ' armies are completely the same .
two , symbolic function .
to a certain degree , a military uniform is the image of a nation 's spirit , a reflection of its national characteristics , and is a focused embodiment of a nation 's military capability and its soldiers ' accomplishments .
in the three main categories of military uniform : ceremonial uniform , service uniform and training uniform , nothing is more capable of fully displaying national and military prestige than a stiff and tight - fitted , handsome - looking ceremonial uniform .
three , protective function .
with the rapid development of new high - technology weapons , improving the overall protective performance of new types of training uniform and making military uniform bullet proof , detection proof , chemical proof , germ proof , radiation proof , as well as having temperature control , moisture control , gas control and various other functions , has become the foremost issue in military uniform development .

certain battalion party committee dares to stick to its guns to handle thorny problem
staff report , chengdu , july 3
report by qu yimao and yang ruiyu : " we are able to live in an apartment thanks to the resolve and determination of the battalion party committee to clear out the rooms . "
today , more than ten cadres from a communication training battalion in chengdu military command all look very happy as they move to an apartment block . they are full of admiration and appreciation at the style in which " the team " of the battalion party committee dared to stick to their guns and struggle against obstacles to resolve a thorny problem .
in the last few years , as personnel have been replaced , a portion of this battalion 's apartments in this family dormitory building was over - occupied , contrary to regulations , which made it difficult for cadres in service to find accommodation . officers and men have expressed considerable objections concerning this matter .
the battalion also cleared out the apartments several times before , but due to resistance they settled the matter by leaving it unsettled , which turned this issue into a long - standing problem .
" if only one sticks to one 's guns and is fair and reasonable , there are no unsolvable problems . "
after the new party committee team achieved consensus , major leaders came out in person to set about completely clearing up all the problems where apartments were occupied contrary to regulations .
on the one hand , they appealed to people 's emotion and explained through reason , hoping that the people concerned would consider the overall situation ; on the other hand they explained clearly the related policies and regulations on military apartments , pooled housing and economic housing , and made clear the party committee 's determination , resolve and standpoint on principles .
for some people with housing elsewhere yet unwilling to withdraw from over - occupied housing , the party committee promptly contacted their work unit and took corresponding steps to urge them to actively cooperate with the army 's work .
after two months of painstaking work , all the residents of buildings on the campgrounds that were over - occupied against regulations moved out on schedule and the serving battalion cadres were allotted housing according to regulations .
this style in which the battalion party committee dares to stick to its guns and struggle against obstacles also created a domino effect : a few cadres originally unwilling to actively cooperate with the organization 's allocation , now also , one by one , expressed submission to the organization 's decision .

jingjiang city people 's armed forces department builds platform to improve quality of their full - time cadres
staff report by cao jiawei and zhu chunbin : on june 18 , in a class where jiangsu province jingjiang city people 's armed forces full - time cadres assembled for training , a tutorial course on " winning the psychological war under informationalized conditions " taught by lu yuqing , director of the people 's armed forces department from xilai town , received unanimous acclaim from participating students .
this is a new change achieved by the people 's armed force department of this city through giving their full - time cadre actual pressure appropriate to their positions in an effort to improve their overall quality .
at the beginning of this year , during a grassroots survey , this people 's armed forces department party committee discovered that some full - time cadres have worked for a long number of years , held too many posts concurrently and were not putting their main effort into doing people 's armed forces work .
for this reason , they adopted centralized training , held meetings instead of lectures , relied on local party schools to perform training and other methods , and periodically carried out training for full - time cadre in an effort to solve such problems as the full - time cadres ' narrow sphere of knowledge , singular professional capability , etc.
based on core work , they boldly assigned duties and increased the pressure on people 's armed forces full - time cadres , and through on - the - job training improved their work competence .
meanwhile , they actively coordinated with local organization departments and jointly drew up the " people 's armed forces full - time cadre achieving position through competition plan . " this clarifies the regulation that the director of the people 's armed forces department must enter the party committee leading group at the same grade and may not concurrently hold any other offices .
a full - time cadre rotation arrangement system was established to promptly rotate and exchange older full - time cadre unable to adapt to grassroots people 's armed forces work , while those comrades with good overall character and strong work capabilities were given promotions and put to use .
not long ago , chen yisong , the secretary in charge of the people 's armed forces department at new century shipyard ltd. , led a militia technical squad that innovated and developed an underwater vessel welding technology which made up for a deficiency in this nation . he was given an accelerated promotion to director of the company 's people 's armed forces department .
if you start well , you should finish well
simply speaking from the match result , a 2-2 score is reasonable and is also acceptable to the chinese team . the key is that the match itself left people feeling somewhat disappointed .
if iran was in the lead 2-0 and then china came back to even the score , the impression given to chinese fans would definitely be different and morale would have lifted a lot . what a pity that the situation was exactly the opposite .
one could say that starting well and being unable to finish well is an old problem for the chinese team .
the chinese team often plays poor soccer when their situation is extremely favorable , and the view of the average person is that the chinese players are mentally not strong enough .
indeed , this is one of the reasons china is incapable of " finishing well . "
however , looking at china 's match tonight , this does not necessarily seem to be the case .
not mentioning sun jihai , sun xiang , shao jiayi , zhen zhi and others who played soccer in europe before , li weifeng and others are also old war veterans . they have extensive experience and , logically speaking , should not have any problems pschologically .
regretfully , this chinese team was held to a draw by iran , and i am afraid that the reason was ineffective deployment of troops in the course of a battle .
while lagging behind , iran substituted two people , and the scene immediately improved .
china also substituted three players in the second half , but the result was not good .
to overcome the old problem of starting well and being unable to finish well , they must correctly determine the source of the problem .
as long as the problem can be correctly determined , it should not be hard to find a way to remove the problem .
what they really should fear is acting blindly out of desperation .
if they continue this way , no matter how many matches the chinese team play , they will continue to repeat their old problem . this is a far cry from everyone 's expectation to see them improve with each match they play .

" small , scattered , remote and direct " education coordination sections at a second artillery base begin operations
staff report by xue bingjian and correspondent xu yeqing : the phenomenon of difficult organization , few resources , and individual operation in educating the " small , scattered , remote and direct " units will become a thing of the past at a second artillery base .
in recent days , this reporter learned that after half a year of trials , this base issued " methods of implementing the ' ideological and political education syllabus ' " to the grassroots levels . a number of ideological and political education coordination sections covering all the " small , scattered , remote and direct " units at the base were officially set in operation .
to promote effective implementation of the " ideological and political education syllabus , " at the beginning of the year , this base used their organizational abilities to conduct an in - depth investigation into the current situation of ideological and political education in " small , scattered , remote and direct " units at the base . they combed through the key problems affecting and restricting education time , staff and effectiveness , and preliminarily formed this kind of new education format of coordination sections for " small , scattered , remote and direct " units .
the specific modus operandi of the coordination section is to break down unit organization boundaries , specify a brigade or regiment level unit to take the lead in a region with relatively concentrated " small , scattered , remote and direct " units in unified planning of topical education . units having different subordinate relationships either attend classes nearby together or hold remote discussions by way of a video system .
a combined method of giving classes in rotation and competing for posts is adopted to unify allocation of educational strength . educational hardware in parts of a region was used jointly ; and the information , data and educational experiences of all units were shared and exchanged . typical reporting tours in parts of the region are periodically organized , and officers and soldiers exchange what they have learned .
each coordination section has established a full - time education liaison and a part - time educational information collector .
on this basis , each coordination section has also set up systems to seek help on difficult problems , discuss important educational subject matters , report urgent ideological situations , and to test and appraise .
director of the political department at the base , zhang shengmin , told reporters that establishing political education coordination sections has not only reduced wastage of educational resources , but has also deepened the effect of the education .
some politics instructors were afraid to lose points in front of officers and men from other units , so they took the initiative to learn new knowledge and seek out new methods of education .
the officers and men receiving education also actively digested the educational content lest they sounded unprofessional in front of officers and men from neighboring units in their discussions and analyses .
in so doing , the enthusiasm of the educators and the educated has been both effectively stirred up .

conducting work openly and fairly has spurred a good atmosphere to take shape at the grassroots level .
in this army , whether it is settling upon work as large as ' hot issue ' sensitive affairs or as small as taking personal vacation time to visit one 's relatives , the everyday expenditure on mess accounts and other items , the grassroots company persists with scheduled public notices and publications , and take the initiative to accept mass supervision .

( sports ) us veteran goalkeeper keller may retire after america cup
xinhua news agency , maracaibo ( venezuela ) , july 3 ( correspondent liu jian )
according to a venezuelan media report on the third , us team 's 37 - year - old veteran goalkeeper keller said in an interview here that if he is unable to find a suitable club to serve after the america cup , then he will choose retirement .
" if i am still unable to obtain a one to two season contract in a high level league team four to six weeks after the america cup ends , then perhaps retirement is not a bad option for me . "
with munchen - gladbach falling to the german bundesliga 2 , keller also left this team which he served for more than two seasons .
although keller is considering turning in his gloves , he obviously has more than enough suitors who are interested in him . he spoke candidly that at present , as many as eight teams are interested in inviting him to join them ,
yet this veteran goalkeeping idol , who has served in the spanish primera league , the english premier division , and german bundesliga 1 , expressed that how he finally decides , depends upon his family , " my child is already 9 years old , he has stayed with me in three different countries and gone to three different schools . my choice now must consider how to better benefit my family . "
in the gold cup that ended not long ago , keller performed outstandingly and helped the us team capture the championship .
in the current america cup , he was still entrusted with the important task by head coach bradley , but what can one man do against overwhelming odds ; a us team of " elite young guards " setting out to do battle is fundamentally no rival for such south american giants as argentina and paraguay . in these two matches , the goal he guarded was penetrated 7 times .
the next match , paired up against columbia , is very likely to be the us team 's and keller 's final performance in the current america cup .
