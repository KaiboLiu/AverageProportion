( selected best of newspapers and perio@@ dic@@ als ) shanghai : persons with con@@ current jobs and graduates of institutions of higher education become main force of h@@ our@@ ly wage earn@@ ers .
xinhua news february 7 from beijing . shanghai municipal ministry of labor and social security announced its ' guide to minimum h@@ our@@ ly wages for 2006 ' on february 6@@ . the number of jobs covered reached 120 , 11 more than last time . wages for these jobs saw some increases and some decreases .
according to the estim@@ ations of relevant experts at the shanghai municipal ministry of labor and social security , shanghai already has over one million people who work for h@@ our@@ ly wages .
according to a report in " china youth magazine , " graduates from institutions of higher education and people holding con@@ current jobs ( holding two or more jobs at once ) are the main constitu@@ encies making up the ranks that work for h@@ our@@ ly wages .
through direct surve@@ ying of nearly 8@@ 000 h@@ our@@ ly paying jobs , it was found that over half of those surve@@ yed hold con@@ current jobs . the proportion of this group reaches 5@@ 1.1 % of the whole .
the level of culture of con@@ current job holders is usually fairly high , they mainly are employed in jobs with relatively strong technical nat@@ ures , such as trans@@ lation positions where the proportion of con@@ current lab@@ ore@@ rs is as high as 8@@ 1.@@ 7 % , and fit@@ ness areas where the proportion reaches 6@@ 1.6 % .
a high income is one important reason that many people are engaged in con@@ current h@@ our@@ ly paying jobs .
according to our understanding , some positions have monthly incomes that can reach several tens of thousands of rmb , such as some hard to fill positions like simultan@@ eous interpretation . the majority of h@@ our@@ ly positions have monthly incomes reaching 2000 rmb or more , such as those con@@ current positions in financial affairs , we@@ d@@ ding masters of cere@@ mon@@ ies , and so on .
satis@@ fying personal interests and expanding one 's knowledge is also an important reason that recei@@ ves the attention of those holding con@@ current jobs with h@@ our@@ ly wages .
for example , mr. g@@ u , who holds the position of manager of the human resources department of a certain enterprise , will take a few hours of time every week to handle the financial accounts of the representative office of a certain foreign business .
mr. g@@ u believes that the biggest benefit of con@@ current jobs is that it allows his knowledge to continually receive up@@ dates , and he has opportunities to be involved in another area . of course , a monthly income of 2000 rmb also has a certain attrac@@ tion .
because some h@@ our@@ ly positions have low employment thre@@ sh@@ ol@@ ds , the circumstances of the jobs are flexible and free and have progres@@ sively received the attention of many graduates currently looking for positions . among those making h@@ our@@ ly wages , 14 % are university or technical school graduates of the past three years .
" at first i did n't want to work for h@@ our@@ ly wages , but after a few months , i think it 's better than going to work from nine to five . "
after college student huang gradu@@ ated , the job she found was n't very ideal . finally she registered her name with a hotel to play background music on the pi@@ an@@ o .
" i am very satisfied with my current job . i make 100 rmb an hour , and the environment is good , what i want to do now is find more h@@ our@@ ly wage jobs . "
according to our understanding , h@@ our@@ ly wage work has already become an important path for graduates to accumul@@ ate work experience , exercise their working skills , increase their communication techniques , and grow social experiences .
graduates doing h@@ our@@ ly work are mainly concentrated on positions with relatively strong technical and intellectual nat@@ ures , such as trans@@ lation positions and similar positions with relatively high professional nat@@ ures and highly era - sty@@ l@@ istic performance art positions . their proportion of h@@ our@@ ly wages is 2@@ 2.@@ 1 % and 2@@ 6.@@ 8 % respectively .
some h@@ our@@ ly work positions have lower technical skills , such as food sales promo@@ ter and tally cl@@ er@@ ks . unemployed persons can begin working these positions with only simple training .
the data shows that the proportion of people working h@@ our@@ ly wage jobs that were originally unemployed reaches 39 % , among which retail jobs have a proportion as high as 6@@ 8.@@ 4 % of workers that were unemployed , and a proportion of 5@@ 8.@@ 7 % among food and be@@ verage jobs . h@@ our@@ ly wage jobs have become an important channel for the unemployed .

these four key science research plans are prote@@ in research , par@@ tic@@ le control research , nan@@ o research , and growth and pro@@ creation research .
the guidelines point out that prote@@ in science is the strategic high@@ point in life sciences being inten@@ s@@ ely fought over in developed nations at present .
in the next 15 years , china must place emphasis on resear@@ ching the key bi@@ ology fields of trans@@ cri@@ pt@@ om@@ ics , prote@@ in science , met@@ ab@@ on@@ om@@ ics , structural bi@@ ology , and the functions and mutual effects of prote@@ in bi@@ ology , system bi@@ ology and prote@@ in bi@@ ology with cor@@ related calcul@@ ations , metho@@ d@@ ology for prote@@ in research and basic research for relevant applications .
the guidelines also believe that par@@ tic@@ le control research has an obvious forward looking nature and will likely produce a hard to calcul@@ ate influence on human social and economic development 20 to 30 years from now .
china must put emphasis on resear@@ ching par@@ tic@@ le communications medi@@ ums and control concepts and methods , par@@ tic@@ le compu@@ tation , new par@@ tic@@ le effects limited to small par@@ tic@@ le systems , new concepts and new technical found@@ ations for par@@ tic@@ le control attribu@@ tes and mea@@ su@@ rement .

in the next 15 years , china 's key research into this area will include the controlling methods of nan@@ o materials , self assembly and func@@ tion@@ ality , nan@@ o@@ electronics , nan@@ o bi@@ ology and nan@@ o medicine , nan@@ o scale attribu@@ tes and mea@@ su@@ rement science , as well as effects of nan@@ o material and nan@@ o technology in energy resources , the environment , information technology , medicines , and other areas .
china 's population growth is large and its in@@ adequ@@ acies are many , organ transp@@ l@@ ants are seriously short and the peak of an aging society will soon arrive - therefore china urgently needs breakthroughs and technical innovations in growth and pro@@ creation science theory .
according to the guidelines , from 2006 to 20@@ 20 china will place emphasis on resear@@ ching cell growth , division and control , the arising , mat@@ uring and im@@ pre@@ g@@ nation of re@@ productive c@@ ells , the decline of human re@@ productive functions and the mechanisms of de@@ gener@@ ative changes , safety and mor@@ als of ai@@ ded re@@ production and stem cell technology .

chinese expert : america be@@ ating dru@@ m of ' chinese military threat ' is ir@@ rational criticism
xinhua new february 9 from beijing ( reporters li xu@@ an@@ liang , xiong zheng@@ yan , and lin li@@ ping ) the pentagon 's " qu@@ ad@@ ren@@ n@@ ial defense review report " formally handed over to congress in recent days has for the first time referred to china as ' the newly rising major nation most likely to present a military challenge to america ' .
experts believe this is an ir@@ rational criticism of china 's normal defense construction , a dram@@ atization of the ' chinese military threat theory ' , and is an interference in china 's internal affairs .
the " qu@@ ad@@ ren@@ n@@ ial defense review report " is the pentagon 's new national defense policy paper .
this 92 page long report uses three sections to discuss the problem of chinese military force and what pa@@ ths america should take to meet this problem . the report directly brings up ' china ' or ' chinese ' a total of 15 times , saying ' as a major and newly prosperous large nation , china has the most potential to carry out military competition with america . if america does not have counter - measures , china will likely develop destruc@@ tive military technologies , thus breaking america 's advantage in conventional weapons . '
resear@@ cher yao yun@@ zhu of the world military research department of the china military science institute says that , although high level american officials have expressed similar views many times before , this is the first time america put forward that ' china is the newly rising major country most likely to present a military challenge to america ' in its ' defense strategy reports ' .
' this report for the first time clearly takes russia , india , and china as newly rising strategic oppon@@ ents , among which it especially gives even more consideration to the so called chinese military threat theory . '
said major general peng guang@@ qian , resear@@ cher of the china military science institute .
worth noting is that on the same day that the " qu@@ ad@@ ren@@ n@@ ial defense review report " was formally handed in , american president bush also handed to congress the government budget for fiscal year 2007 , in which the defense budget reached 4@@ 3@@ 9.@@ 3 billion us@@ d .
' if you add on to this the budget for the military movements in iraq and afghanistan , america 's 2007 fiscal year defense budget will breakthrough 500 billion us@@ d , setting a new historic high ' peng guang@@ qian said . ' this is nearly equal to the total military expenditures of all other countries in the world put together . '
peng guang@@ qian believes that the method of america con@@ coc@@ ting ' threat theories from other countries ' reflects the pentagon 's usual style of ' creating enemies . ' its real aim is in striving for even more defense expenditures , and dre@@ dging up even more profits for america 's huge military industrial complex .
experts say , compared with america 's huge military expenditures , china 's defense expenditures are relatively limited .
military expert deng hong@@ zhou , who has taken part in the writing of china 's defense white paper several times , said that since the 1990 's , along with economic development , china 's defense expenditures have increased , but have shown a dec@@ lining trend in the total proportion of national revenue expenditures of the same period .
official data shows that in 2004 as compared to 1979 , china 's defense expenditures fell by ten percentage points in terms of the proportion of national revenue expenditures of the same period .
in 2005 , china 's defense expenditures were 24@@ 4.@@ 6@@ 56 billion rmb , equal to only approximately 1@@ /@@ 14 of america 's . average per capita military expenditures are only equal to about 1@@ /@@ 60 of america 's . per capita spending on military personnel is only equal to approximately 1@@ /@@ 30 of america 's .
' america 's land area is about equal to china 's land area , but military expenditures of the two countries have a huge difference . it is self evident which country has military strength that exceeds its normal defense needs . '
peng guang@@ qian said .
teng jian@@ qu@@ n , director of the research department of china 's military control and disarmament association , expressed that america should objec@@ tively appra@@ ise the situation of china 's military construction . china 's peaceful development does not mean that china and america will become military oppon@@ ents in the future .
the " china 's defense in 2004 " white paper said china sta@@ un@@ ch@@ ly follows the path of peaceful development , and carries out a defensive national defense policy .
china has never become a threat to any country in the past or present , and will not become a threat in the future .
up until now , china has not established military bases in any country , and has not sent one soldier to any other country , while america has over 100 military bases abroad , and in the asian pacific region alone has in exc@@ ess of 100,000 military forces deployed .
professor zhu feng of beijing university 's international relations institute said that china and america should go through already established channels to increase communication and exchanges , increase understanding and mutual trust , comprehensively further chinese and american constructive cooperative relations in the new century and jointly promote maintaining world peace and development .

( international observation ) hamas looks for breakthrough in forming cabinet
xinhua news february 9 from ram@@ al@@ lah ( internation@@ l observation ) . hamas looks for breakthrough in forming cabinet
xinhua news reporter hao huang@@ min
after the palestine islamic resistance movement ( hamas ) obtained victory in legislative elections , how it will pain@@ t a blueprint for a new government has become a focal point the whole world is concerned with at the moment .
what kinds of new policies hamas will put forth will directly influence the direction taken by all concerned parties in corresponding policy for the peace process .
at the same time , the attitude of resistance of america and israel adds even more vari@@ ab@@ les to the prospects of the hamas government .
at present , various palestinian fac@@ tions are currently tigh@@ tening their cooperation , and are actively sear@@ ching for breakthroughs on the future development of the situation on sensitive points and difficulties that forming a cabinet involves .
( sub heading ) who will the position of premier fall to ?
after hamas obtained the right to form the cabinet , there have been people in the outside world who worry a ' hamas premier ' will likely see differen@@ tly than the current high leader ab@@ b@@ as .
also , hamas leader m@@ ash@@ al , who is currently visiting egypt , emphasized that the new palestinian government established by hamas leaders will not continue to recognize israel . this in@@ tran@@ sig@@ ent stand@@ point also intensi@@ fies the worry of the international community .
america and israel explicitly state they will not accept a hamas government that controls real power , and have used this threat to cut off economic support and transmission of taxation to palestine .
however , this has not obstruc@@ ted hamas in making flexible policy adjustments - choo@@ sing independ@@ ents is a policy to split the difference .
according to reports , to acquire international approval across the largest range possible , earlier domestic and foreign hamas leaders meeting together in egypt decided to choose independent is@@ mail han@@ i@@ ye@@ h , chairman of the board of truste@@ es of the islamic university in gaz@@ a , to be appointed the new premier .
this move has still not received the respon@@ ses of concerned parties .
palestine analy@@ st hus@@ se@@ in said that no matter who the position of premier falls to , what is most crucial is the choice for premier must dil@@ u@@ te the ' hard ' aspects of hamas as much as possible . only by doing this can the successful forming of a cabinet be secu@@ red .
( sub heading ) how to al@@ locate power
looking at the internal ma@@ ke@@ up of the party , the biggest challenge that hamas faces in forming a cabinet is it lacks am@@ ple experience being in power .
the palestine " daily " published an analysis saying that while hamas gathered popul@@ arity through social welfare projects , in the area of being in power it lacks experience . hamas cooper@@ ating with the palestinian national liberation movement ( fat@@ ah ) , which has experience being in power , would be the best strategy .
hamas brought up establishing a ' government partner ' relationship with fat@@ ah after the elections to jointly establish a united ethnic government , however fat@@ ah has not given a positive response to this as of the present .
opinions among those in the fat@@ ah party as to whether or not to enter the cabinet are not the same . one faction advocates participating in the new government , and thus having something to say ; another faction refuses the invitation of hamas , and would rather be an ' active opposition faction ' in the legisl@@ ature .
persons with sensitive information pointed out that under the advice of ab@@ b@@ as , fat@@ ah is progres@@ sively le@@ an@@ ing towards entering into the new government .
although this might be the case , hamas and fat@@ ah would still ha@@ gg@@ le over the allocation of cabinet positions .
besides this , another path would be to establish a cabinet that is free of party aff@@ ili@@ ations and outside the framework of the legisl@@ ature .
according to reports , hamas has also designed a te@@ ch@@ no@@ cr@@ acy government , but the concrete list of names is still unknown .
in light of the attitude of israel and america , a te@@ ch@@ no@@ cr@@ acy government might still be accepted as a method to form a cabinet that would less@@ en outside pressure .
according to regulations of the palestine " basic law , " after the new legisl@@ ature conven@@ es on the february 16 , the nomin@@ ations for premier and forming of a cabinet will be completed in three to five weeks .
( sub heading ) at a loss about armed forces
the weapons in the hands of hamas are another thor@@ ny problem that the forming of a new government faces .
america 's and israel 's attitude is extremely sti@@ ff . they sta@@ un@@ ch@@ ly demand hamas give up violence , and reject hamas taking part in government while carrying guns .
hamas leader m@@ ash@@ al emphasized on february 9 that armed resistance is the ' strategic choice ' of his organization .
the arms problem in ac@@ tu@@ ality includes two levels of problems : the leg@@ ality of weapons , and the jurisdiction and management of armed forces .
hamas has obtained international acknowle@@ d@@ g@@ ement for being the largest party in the legisl@@ ature elected in a democratic and free manner , allowing its subordinate armed faction the ' q@@ aw@@ as@@ ame@@ h tri@@ be ' to use legal aven@@ ues to unify itself into the government 's security organizations .
hamas once brought up unifying all armed fac@@ tions into a palestine ethnic power organization ' people 's army . ' however it did not get a broad response , and also took criticism from the palestinian islamic ji@@ had movement .
at present , palestine has over 6@@ 0,000 security organization personnel , the vast majority of which come from the fat@@ ah camp .
also , fat@@ ah has some subordinate armed fac@@ tions with loo@@ se organizational relations , such as the ' al-@@ a@@ q@@ sa marty@@ rs ' brig@@ ades ' and the ' fat@@ ah haw@@ ks ' and others .
hamas , which is responsible for forming the cabinet , must come to an understanding with ab@@ b@@ as on how to manage these armed forces that each have their own power structures , and al@@ locate the power of management of security in a reasonable way .
according to the reports of local media , ab@@ b@@ as is interested in managing the security and information regim@@ ents , while the police and people 's guard and other organizations will be subordinate to the management of the department of the interior of the new government .
however , all sides are still carrying out discussions on this sensitive issue , and as of now there is nothing further .

because this is the first time china has released its polar region survey report , the " 2005 china polar region survey report " also carried out a review and summary of chinese polar region surveys beginning in the early 1980 's .

in 1997 , china became a member of the ar@@ c@@ tic science committee , winning the right to decide policy and speak in international polar region affairs .
the " report " points out that in over 20 years , china 's polar region surveys have " continuously developed from nothing and for the first time have real scope . " the ant@@ ar@@ c@@ tic and ar@@ c@@ tic science survey system already has " three stations and one ship , " that is : chang@@ cheng station established in february 198@@ 5 in ant@@ ar@@ c@@ tic@@ a , zhong@@ shan station established in february 1989 in ant@@ ar@@ c@@ tic@@ a , huang@@ he station established in july 2004 in the ar@@ c@@ tic , and the " xu@@ el@@ ong " class polar survey ship that began to undertake survey missions to the ar@@ c@@ tic in 1994 .
the " report " estimates that as of the end of 2005 , china had already organized 22 ant@@ ar@@ c@@ tic science surveys , two ar@@ c@@ tic science surveys using the " xu@@ el@@ ong " as a platform , and two survey 's from the huang@@ he ar@@ c@@ tic station . as of the present , china already has sent over 3@@ 000 people to personally go to the ant@@ ar@@ c@@ tic or the ar@@ c@@ tic to carry out on - sight surveys .
" at present we are currently doing feasibility research work into building the third ant@@ ar@@ c@@ tic survey station which would also be the first inland survey station for china . "
sun zhi@@ hui said .
" after over 20 years of hard work , china 's polar region survey enterprise already has a defin@@ ite position among the world 's polar region surveys . however , compared with the other main polar region surve@@ ying countries , there still exists a relatively large discre@@ p@@ ancy . we must push on ahead .

high definition digital tv slow@@ ly becoming mainstream in america
xinhua news february 12 from new york ( reporter fan xia@@ ol@@ in ) . with the continuous decline of prices and the continuous expansion to the market of high definition digital tv ( h@@ d@@ tv ) sets , the american tv broadcasting organizations are hur@@ ri@@ edly putting out relevant h@@ d@@ tv programs .
the recent ' super bo@@ w@@ l ' competition of american style football has already become the warm up match for american broadca@@ sters to welcome and receive the era of high definition .
according to reports in " the financial times " in previous days , america 's congress recently passed a law stipul@@ ating that american broadca@@ sters must totally stop broadcasting an@@ al@@ og signals before february 17 , 200@@ 9 and only broadcast digital signals .
this means that the dig@@ ital@@ ization of american tv program broadca@@ sts already has a clear timetable .
the spread of h@@ d@@ tv must rely on the buying of t@@ v@@ s by consumers in one aspect , and in another aspect rely on the supply of h@@ d@@ tv programs by tv produc@@ ers .
although digital tv has been brought up many times in the past few years , it has never become reality .
this problem saw a turning point this year .
according to the forec@@ asts of america 's consumer electronics association , the sales volume of digital t@@ v@@ s this year will for the first time exceed that of traditional t@@ v@@ s , and 85 % of digital t@@ v@@ s are high definition products .
japanese researchers develop new model highly effective arti@@ ficial kid@@ ney
xinhua news february 13 from tokyo ( reporter qian zheng ) researchers of japan 's to@@ kai university have developed a kind of biological arti@@ ficial kid@@ ney . it not only has the same cat@@ abol@@ ic functions as a human kid@@ ney , it also has functions to maintain useful sub@@ stances . it has a small volume , is easy to transp@@ l@@ ant , and with more research there is hope it will bring good fortune to kid@@ ney disease patients .
according to a report in previous days in the " ni@@ k@@ kei business daily " , the newly developed biological arti@@ ficial kid@@ ney is mainly made up of two parts . one part is the ' arti@@ ficial kid@@ ney unit ' that str@@ ains out waste material and water from blood , the other part is the ' arti@@ ficial ur@@ ine tu@@ bes ' that returns water , am@@ in@@ o ac@@ i@@ ds and other useful materials back into the blood from crude ur@@ ine .
the ' arti@@ ficial kid@@ ney unit ' and the ' arti@@ ficial ur@@ ine tu@@ bes ' are both made up of hol@@ low fi@@ bers . the inner side of the ' arti@@ ficial ur@@ ine tu@@ bes ' are lined with the ep@@ i@@ th@@ el@@ ia of ur@@ ine tu@@ bes that have the function of dis@@ simil@@ ating waste material .
this type of ep@@ i@@ th@@ el@@ ia can make diseases brought about by multiple blood di@@ aly@@ sis - such as the materials causing the formation of ' am@@ y@@ lo@@ id de@@ generation related to di@@ aly@@ sis ' dis@@ solve into am@@ in@@ o ac@@ i@@ ds and return to the blood , while also allowing the g@@ lu@@ co@@ se , v@@ it@@ am@@ ins , min@@ er@@ als and other things that the body needs returned to the blood .
arti@@ ficial kid@@ ne@@ ys in the past reli@@ ed on the difference between per@@ me@@ ation pressure to fil@@ ter met@@ abol@@ ized waste , and could not totally get rid of everything . they also did not have the function of returning am@@ in@@ o ac@@ i@@ ds and other materials back into the blood .
researchers used a go@@ at to carry out transp@@ l@@ ant experiments with the arti@@ ficial kid@@ ney . pi@@ g ep@@ i@@ th@@ el@@ ia was used for the hol@@ low fi@@ br@@ ous inner wall of the arti@@ ficial kid@@ ney used .
after two weeks , researchers confirmed that the arti@@ ficial kid@@ ney was func@@ tioning .
at present they are developing a biological arti@@ ficial kid@@ ney using c@@ ells from human kid@@ ne@@ ys , and will begin clin@@ ical research after they veri@@ fy its safety .
china 's safe production of electricity still faces serious challenges
xinhua news february 13 from beijing ( reporter an bei ) . an official of the state electricity supervision committee said on february 13 that although safe production of electricity in 2005 maintained an overall stable trend , the safe production of electricity still faces serious challenges .
shi yu@@ bo , chairman of the state electricity supervision committee , said at the 5@@ th ( expanded ) state electricity safe production committee conference being held in beijing that china 's safe electricity production in 2005 maintained an overall stable trend . it satisfactorily completed the task of getting through the summer pe@@ a@@ ks , realized the safe sup@@ plying of energy , actively responded to the attack of natural disasters , and basically as@@ sured the safe and stable operations of the electricity system . safe electricity production facility accidents and normal electricity gri@@ d accidents saw a large decrease over that of last year , and the health level of electricity facilities received enhancement .
however , he also pointed out that with the changes of the supply and demand trends of electricity as well as the successive bringing into service of newly built gener@@ ator groups , safe electricity production will face new challenges .
these challenges include the continued existence of regional , seas@@ onal , and time inter@@ val power shortage phenomenon because electricity supply and demand trends of some areas are still tight . the supply of electricity coal ( coal used in gener@@ ating electricity ) still has rather large problems because there is no excellent electricity coal pric@@ ing mechanism . at the same time , the problem of falling quality of electricity coal has not received effective controls , seriously influen@@ cing the stable operations of gener@@ ator groups . the structure of some electricity gri@@ ds are weak , facilities are old and bring hidden problems to system safety . the situation of common electricity infrastructure accidents has still not received a fundamental turn around , and the trend is still grim .
shi yu@@ bo said that with the deepening of reforms of the electricity system , many deep ro@@ oted contradictions will continuously be revealed . the new problems will become how to maintain the stability of the work@@ force , and secure a normal production order .
in terms of tasks for safe electricity production in 2006 , shi yu@@ bo expressed that we must further sol@@ i@@ di@@ fy the basic tasks of safe electricity production management , speed up the establishment and perfec@@ tion of electricity safety emergency response management mechanisms , and increase the ability to handle un@@ expected incidents . in addition , we must strengthen the coordination of the power plant gri@@ d and jointly maintain the safety of the electricity system . we must also continue to do the tasks of supervision management and inform@@ ational construction for large dam hy@@ dr@@ o electric plants , as@@ sure the safety of large dam@@ s , strengthen safety management of electricity construction , and decrease the occurrence of injuries or deaths from accidents . finally , we must continue to strengthen information reporting tasks and ensure the tim@@ el@@ iness , accur@@ acy , and free flow of electricity safety information .
according to our understanding , by un@@ iting with the new trends in safe electricity management the electricity supervision committee will carry out modi@@ fications and perfec@@ tions of the already published " temporary investigation regulations on electricity production accidents " this year , while the relevant accompanying documents on large hy@@ dr@@ o electric dam safety and safety protection of the second order electrical power system will be successively issued this year .
in 2005 china 's use of electricity reached 2.@@ 4@@ 68 trillion kil@@ ow@@ at@@ t hours , a 13.@@ 5 % increase over the previous year .
facing an electricity supply and demand trend that is still tight and prominent coal power and oil transportation contradictions and other non - advantageous situations , various electricity enterprises have conscientiously taken effective measures and strengthened facility management . last year no extremely large facility accident occurred in the nation 's electricity production .
74 electricity gri@@ d accidents occurred , a decline of 1@@ 27 from the previous year . 4@@ 27 facility accidents occurred , a decline of 13@@ 2 from the previous year .
south african minister assigned to china expressed south africa does not have ' organized ' crime directed at chinese citizens .
xinhua news february 13 from beijing ( reporters wang jiang@@ ang and hao y@@ al@@ in ) . temporary representative of the south african embassy in china v@@ us@@ i b@@ . k@@ olo@@ an@@ e expressed on february 13 while being interviewed by a xinhua reporter that south africa does not have ' organized ' crime directed at chinese citizens .
he also expressed that the south african government will do its best to " cr@@ ush all forms of criminal activities . "
k@@ olo@@ an@@ e expressed that the south african government hopes to " lower to zero " the crime rate , and hopes that the safety of the lives and property of all foreigners working in south africa will receive the am@@ ple assurance of local law and citizens .
since the beginning of 2006 , there have already been 4 chinese citizens that have been mur@@ dered in south africa . the chinese world has expressed extensive concern over this .
china 's ministry of foreign affairs has already put forward discussion of this to south african parties , and warned chinese citizens travel@@ ing in south africa to further strengthen their safety and defense knowledge . overseas compatriots should stick together and coordinate with police to jointly cr@@ ush criminal behavior .
" we express the most sincere condol@@ ences and m@@ our@@ ning to the families of those mur@@ dered . "
k@@ olo@@ an@@ e said , " we feel ap@@ olog@@ e@@ tic because of this . please allow the people of china to believe that the south african government is currently seriously investigating every case that involves china . "
according to the statement of the chinese embassy in south africa , south african police have already successfully broken the case of chinese fujian female chen jian@@ qing 's murder on february 5 , and one suspect is already arrested .
at present the police are pursuing another suspect .
also according to the south african embassy in china , a criminal wanted as a suspect in the january shooting of a hong kong business@@ man has already been arrested by south african police , and the belong@@ ings of the mur@@ dered person have already been re@@ tri@@ eved .
when talking about the influence that chinese citizens being mur@@ dered is likely to produce , k@@ olo@@ an@@ e believes that these events " indeed " will produce some negative effects on the trade , tourism , and other areas of exchange between the two nations ; but looking at the long term , the effects " should n't be great . "
according to the statements from assistant director of tourism man@@ q@@ ob@@ a n@@ y@@ embe@@ zi of the south african embassy , the embassy sent out over 2000 vis@@ as for travel to south africa by chinese in the first 15 days of this year alone .
also , according to china 's official statistical data , in 2005 south africa continued to keep china as south africa 's largest trading partner .
the volume of bilateral trade reached 7.@@ 27 billion us@@ d , a year on year growth of 23 % .
however , personnel in the tourism field believe that the chinese citizen mur@@ ders that happened in 2004 will have a clear effect on the number of chinese going to south africa to travel .
according to the statistics of the south african tourism bureau , the first half of 2005 saw 20@@ ,@@ 3@@ 31 chinese tourists travel to south africa , a drop of 14.@@ 9 % with that of the year before .
at present there are around 200,000 chinese that live in south africa , spread throughout south africa 's cities , towns , and villages .
analysts believe that the dis@@ par@@ ity between rich and poor in south africa is great , the level of unemployment high , guns are everywhere , and there is no deter@@ rence from a death penalty ; thus the crime rate is high .
because many chinese do not understand english but keep cash on their persons and at home , they more easily become targets for criminals looking for money .

a few days ago he just got out of the hospital . today he insisted on coming here to say good@@ b@@ ye to his old friend .
when mr. jin left a message in the message book , he could not control his gri@@ ef , and had to wi@@ pe away the te@@ ars flow@@ ing from his eyes several times .

china to introduce information network broadcasting rights protection articles
xinhua news february 15 from beijing ( reporters zhou wei and li fei ) . at present many websites all rely on re@@ produced news reports from a large volume of newspapers and magaz@@ ines and other media to increase their hit rates , however many have not obtained authorization , and do not pay compensation . department head wang zi@@ qiang of the national copyright administration 's department of copy@@ righ@@ ting stated at a news conference held at the news office of the state council that the information network broadcasting rights protection articles which the state council will introduce will supply a resolution concerning the problem of payment for works re@@ produced on the internet , .
wang zi@@ qiang said that according to the regulations of the laws currently in effect , works already published in newspapers and perio@@ dic@@ als can be used by newspapers and perio@@ dic@@ als without the agreement of the auth@@ or as long as the auth@@ or does n't make a declaration of " cannot be used . " however , newspapers and perio@@ dic@@ als must pay compensation for works re@@ published . the national copyright administration has set the standards for compensation for re@@ produced works of newspapers and perio@@ dic@@ als specifically according to what the law stipulates .
however , according to the regulations of laws currently in effect , newspaper and peri@@ od@@ ical agencies enjoy the rights of this statutory license , but at present the internet does not enjoy these rights .
according to relevant judicial interpretation by the supreme people 's court , statutory license for re@@ production of newspaper and peri@@ od@@ ical works can be su@@ itably used for the internet . short articles published on newspapers , perio@@ dic@@ als , and the internet can be used by internet sites without obtaining approval while also paying compensation as long as the auth@@ or does not declare works " cannot be used .

" concerning whether the internet 's use of these already published short articles is suitable use of statutory license or not , this still must be confirmed from the view point of the law . "
wang zi@@ qiang said . " whether it 's to be put into the scope confirmed by the law or not , we must wait for the con@@ firm@@ ation of these information network broadcasting rights protection articles to be introduced this year . "

xinhua news february 15 from moscow ( reporter song shi@@ yi ) . news official v@@ y@@ ach@@ es@@ la@@ v se@@ do@@ v of russia 's department of defense gave a talk to media on february 15 saying that the decision of the geor@@ gi@@ an parliament concerning russia 's peace keeping forces will not influence the peace keeping activities of russian soldiers in the short term . russian soldiers will continue to carry out their peace keeping mission in the conflict region of south os@@ se@@ ti@@ a .
and@@ re@@ i k@@ ok@@ o@@ sh@@ in , head of russia 's state du@@ ma 's ( lower house of parliament ) committee on relations with the comm@@ on@@ wealth of independent states , pointed out when giving a talk on the geor@@ gi@@ an parliament 's decision concerning russia 's peace keeping forces on the same day that this decision of geor@@ gi@@ a 's will damage the stability of the area , and produce non - advantageous influ@@ ences on russian - geor@@ gi@@ an relations .
he emphasized that this decision of the geor@@ gi@@ an parliament will cause the relations of geor@@ gi@@ a and russian to take another step toward deteri@@ oration .
he believes geor@@ gi@@ an critic@@ isms of russia are absur@@ d .
that day geor@@ gi@@ a 's parliament passed a decision requiring russia 's peace keeping forces to stop their peace keeping activities in south os@@ se@@ ti@@ a , but did not con@@ firm a concrete time limit by which russian peace keeping forces should withdraw .
geor@@ gi@@ a 's parliament critici@@ zes that russian peace keeping personnel do not carry out their stipulated duties , and look at the activities that russia has taken in the conflict region as " aiming to annex this territory of geor@@ gi@@ a . "
the geor@@ gi@@ an parliament requires the government take active moves and consider bringing in an international peace keeping force into the south os@@ se@@ ti@@ a conflict region to replace russia 's current peace keeping activities in the area .
the geor@@ gi@@ an parliament also gave the task of am@@ ending the relevant agreements confir@@ ming russia 's peace keeping forces may be gar@@ ris@@ oned in the conflict region to the government .
south os@@ se@@ ti@@ a is a self - govern@@ ed state of geor@@ gi@@ a and borders russia 's republic of north os@@ se@@ ti@@ a - al@@ ania .

state administration of work safety : containing the frequent occurrence of large coal mine accidents is the most important task this year
xinhua news february 17 from beijing ( reporter liu zheng ) . with the occurrence of four successive mining disasters with more than 100 people d@@ ying in each , the serious aspect of last year 's national safe production trend has made " containing the frequent occurrence of large coal mine accidents " the most important task this year for the state administration of work safety .
this reporter learned from the state administration of work safety that they genu@@ in@@ ely want to contain the frequent occurrence of large coal mine accidents , and this is the most important task .
for mine safety this year the state administration of work safety will carefully follow the following three things :
-- continue to fight for better control of me@@ than@@ e gas .
the control of me@@ than@@ e gas will place the principle of " first taking it out and then mining " in a prominent position this year .
if high me@@ than@@ e gas p@@ its do not carry out the principle of " first taking it out and then mining , " then they will be ordered to immediately stop production according to the law .
-- continue to fight for better consolidated clos@@ ings .
the administration will totally and thoroughly close down the 5@@ 2@@ 43 coal mines p@@ its reported to society , as well as the over 700 coal mine p@@ its newly reported from various locations .
these clos@@ ings must be a regular task ; the administration must continuously close down those coal mines that destroy resources , pollu@@ te the environment , and are not equipped with safe conditions .
-- strengthen basic coal mine safety management .
the administration will immediately correct or prevent the deteri@@ oration of management of a small number of large state owned mines . it will lead management of dis@@ orderly small mines to establish standardized safety management systems .
the administration will especially manage key state owned mines ; never allowing production that exceeds ability , intensity , or manpower .
this year 's safe production control index demands that deaths from all types of accidents across the nation decline by 3 % over last year , with deaths from coal mining falling 3.5 % .
extremely large accidents where 10 or more deaths occur at once should fall by 5 % , and 7 % for coal mining .
these control inde@@ xes have already been received by the people 's government of all provinces . all locations are currently breaking down these inde@@ xes piece by piece and implementing them in the infrastructure and enterprises .
statistics show that in 2005 deaths from mining accidents across the nation were 5,@@ 9@@ 86 , a fall of 0.7 % over the previous year .
however , deaths from especially large accidents with 10 or more deaths shot up@@ wards , increasing 6@@ 6.@@ 6 % over the previous year .

( winter olympics - stimul@@ ants ) news analysis : p@@ y@@ lev@@ a incident likely to end in@@ conclu@@ sive
xinhua news february 17 from tur@@ in . news analysis : p@@ y@@ lev@@ a incident likely to end in@@ conclu@@ sive
xinhua news reporter gao peng and ding ying
although italy repeatedly issued orders saying that all athletes discovered using stimul@@ ants during the tur@@ in olympics would likely face " the spec@@ ter of j@@ ail ; " however , looking at various circumstances it seems that the main character in the first stimul@@ ant scand@@ al of this winter olympics , russian bi@@ ath@@ l@@ on athle@@ te ol@@ g@@ a p@@ y@@ lev@@ a , will not likely face j@@ ail - time .
the tur@@ in olympic committee revealed the first stimul@@ ant scand@@ al of the games on february 16@@ . it was discovered that ol@@ g@@ a p@@ y@@ lev@@ a used the prohibited stimul@@ ant car@@ p@@ he@@ d@@ on .
the next day , the international olympic committee announced that p@@ y@@ lev@@ a had already been exp@@ elled from the winter olympics , and the gold med@@ al she won in the women 's bi@@ ath@@ l@@ on 15 km individual race at this winter olympics had already been stri@@ pped from her .
the international bi@@ ath@@ l@@ on union passed a p@@ uni@@ tive decision to ban p@@ y@@ lev@@ a from competition for two years .
it has always been that the international olympic committee stipulated that athletes discovered using stimul@@ ants at the olympic games would have their sco@@ res cancelled and have their qualifications for taking part in events taken away , but they would not receive the punishment of the law .
however , according to italian law , athletes carrying and using stimul@@ ants is considered criminal behavior and judicial authorities have the right to directly arrest and investigate the athle@@ te using stimul@@ ates . those def@@ ying the law face any@@ where from three months to three years in prison .
last december , the international olympic committee and the italian government concluded " negotiations " that had lasted as long as a year , finally reaching an agreement that both sides would deal with athletes using stimul@@ ants according to italian law at this winter olympics .
after the ti@@ reless efforts of the international olympic committee , italy gave a concession four days before the opening ceremony for the winter olympics , promis@@ ing that during the winter olympics police would not enter the olympic village and search the resid@@ ences of athletes . however , athletes that showed positive for drugs would still be investigated by italian authorities .
reports state that mari@@ o p@@ es@@ can@@ te , the official supervising the tur@@ in olympics for the italian government , has already handed over the p@@ y@@ lev@@ a stimul@@ ant incident to tur@@ in investigating authorities .
however , the international olympic committee and p@@ es@@ can@@ te have not confirmed this as of present .
russian team doctor for the bi@@ ath@@ l@@ on team and@@ re@@ y d@@ my@@ tri@@ e@@ v revealed on february 17 that p@@ y@@ lev@@ a had already left tur@@ in and returned to russia .
chinese sports official shi li@@ an@@ cheng , who worked for many years at the world anti - stimul@@ ant organization , believes that as soon as p@@ y@@ lev@@ a returns to russia , this incident 's ending will likely be " in@@ conclu@@ sive . "
shi li@@ an@@ cheng said that the international olympic committee and the italian government have never " thoroughly resolved " the anti - stimul@@ ant problems at the winter olympics , and although the italian investigating authorities have indeed come into play , the results are hard to predic@@ t .
looking at the pun@@ ishments in judgment of cases of domestic athletes using stimul@@ ants in italy , the most serious pun@@ ishments that offenders have received is no more than " two years of suspended imprisonment . "
therefore , senior reporter pi@@ er@@ i of italy 's an@@ sa news expressed that the lik@@ el@@ ihood of p@@ y@@ lev@@ a going to prison is " extremely small , " and at most a fine will be given .
pi@@ er@@ i expressed that although italian courts can carry out sent@@ encing without the accused present , italian police are not likely to go abroad to bring p@@ y@@ lev@@ a back for punishment .
if p@@ y@@ lev@@ a refuses to accept the judgment , then italy will have no way to get her .
