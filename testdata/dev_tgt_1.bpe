the executive committee of the european union has passed a resolution for the establishment of additional " bu@@ ff@@ er area " controls , including all areas of countries where the virus has been discovered for control , and for@@ bidding all trade and transportation of poul@@ tries and bird species .
the bird flu break@@ outs continue to spread to more chick@@ en farms following the eighth day since the dead@@ ly h 5@@ n@@ 1 virus was discovered in niger@@ ia , africa , and trac@@ ks demonstrate that it has cros@@ sed the northern border of niger@@ ia and entered into nig@@ er .
egyp@@ tian officials are investigating the sudden mass death of chickens on a chick@@ en farm in the south , and there is concern that the virus might continue to spread .
chick@@ en meat markets in europe are falling to a great extent because of the impact of the virus event . the executive committee of the european union stressed that there is no reason to pan@@ ic .
ji@@ pu ru@@ in@@ u@@ o , an executive member of the committee responsible for san@@ itation and food safety , said that it is understand@@ able for people to be concerned about the event but there is no need for over@@ reaction .
the executive committee of the european union has issued a new regulation and listed all of the european areas where the virus has been discovered as " bu@@ ff@@ er areas " after passing a previous resolution about the establishment of a three - kilome@@ ter protection area and ten - kilome@@ ter warning area around every virus discovery spot .

on the 16@@ th , roman@@ ia discovered its 3@@ 1@@ st epidemic case , and slo@@ ven@@ ia , austri@@ a , gre@@ ece , and ru@@ eg@@ en island in germany have also discovered new epidemic cases .
the bird flu virus was discovered in the bodies of two duc@@ ks in southern italy , which are the first poultry infected with the h 5@@ n@@ 1 virus in the european region , aside from wild sw@@ ans .
the greatest concern that european union officials have is those migr@@ ant birds that will be flying back from africa .
the niger@@ ian government is strengthening its work to prevent the human infection of the virus on the african contin@@ ent .
the niger@@ ian government announced that all poul@@ tries and bird species must be destroyed within a five - kilome@@ ter area of where an infected farm is discovered , regardless of whether they are threatened by the virus or not .
the government of nig@@ er , its neighb@@ or country , has announced a national warning state , and made an emergency plan by providing 4 million us@@ d to monitor the border areas with niger@@ ia .
the newly established national emergency committee stated that they have received a report that nearly 400 poul@@ tries and bird species are dead in mag@@ ar@@ ia , a loo@@ s@@ ely guar@@ ded area between the two countries .

as long as a security assessment setup follows related conditions and requirements , even if it is not acknowledged by the banking supervision committee for its quali@@ fication , financial institutions can still invite it to conduct an assessment for electronic banking security , but it should be controlled according to related regulations .
the " method for management of electronic banking businesses " has a total of nine chap@@ ters and 99 articles that are divided into nine parts , including the general principle , application and renewal , risk control , data exchange and transfer control , business contract control , cross - border business activities control , supervision control , liabilities , and additional regulations , etc.

( newspaper di@@ gest ) part - time workers and high school graduates become major forces of h@@ our@@ ly - paid work in shanghai
xinhua news agency , beijing , february 7@@ . the " guidance on the current standard for h@@ our@@ ly - paid wages in 2006 " issued by the labor and social support bureau of shanghai city on february 6 , li@@ sts 120 occup@@ ations , which is 11 more than the number issued last time . the " wage levels " of the original positions are either increased or reduced .
as an estimate made by related experts of the labor and social support bureau of shanghai city , currently the h@@ our@@ ly - paid workers in shanghai are more than one million .
as china youth jour@@ nal reported , part - time workers and high school graduates are the major part of the team of h@@ our@@ ly - paid lab@@ ors .
through a direct survey of more than 8,000 h@@ our@@ ly - paid workers , more than half of them are part - time workers , and their ratio is 5@@ 1.1 % .
those part - time workers are generally well educated , and mainly do more technical work . for instance , the ratio of part - time workers in the trans@@ lation occupation is as high as 8@@ 1.@@ 7 % , and that in the gy@@ m business is 6@@ 1.6 % .
high income is one of the important reasons for many people to work at h@@ our@@ ly - paid part - time jobs .
as was learned , monthly income for some positions can reach up to several tens of thousands of yuan , and it is difficult to find high - demand talents , such as simultan@@ eous interpre@@ ters ; most h@@ our@@ ly - paid workers ' monthly incomes can reach more than 2,000 yuan , such as part - time financial workers , we@@ d@@ ding ceremony managers , etc.
one of the important reasons for the popul@@ arity of part - time workers for h@@ our@@ ly wages is that those jobs suit individual interests and workers can learn more knowledge from those jobs .
for instance , mr. g@@ u , who is a manager of the human resources unit at a company , uses several hours to handle business accounts for a foreign business agency every week .
mr. g@@ u thinks that the greatest benefit of a part - time job is to continuously re@@ new his own knowledge , and has opportunities to know another field , and of course , a monthly income of 2,000 yuan is also attrac@@ tive to a certain extent .
since some positions for h@@ our@@ ly - paid workers are low - skill ones , and their working patter@@ ns are flexible and free , they have gradually become popular among a lot of graduates who are looking for jobs . 14 % of h@@ our@@ ly - paid workers are graduates from colleges and pol@@ y@@ techn@@ ic schools in the last three years .
" i did not want to do an h@@ our@@ ly - paid job in the beginning . but several months later , i feel it is better than 9 to 5 work . "
xiao huang 's job hun@@ ting is not that satis@@ fying after he graduates from college . he eventually regi@@ sters with a hotel and plays background music on a pi@@ an@@ o .
" i am quite satisfied with my current work , 100 yuan per hour , and the environment is also good . what i should do now is to find several more h@@ our@@ ly - paid jobs . "
as has been learned , h@@ our@@ ly - paid jobs have become an important path for those graduates who are looking for jobs to accumul@@ ate work experience , exercise their work skills , improve their communication skills , and enrich their social experience .
those graduates who work at h@@ our@@ ly - paid jobs are mainly concentrated in positions that require more knowledge and skills , including trans@@ lation positions , which require professional skills , and entertainment and performance positions , which require current popul@@ arity . these two kinds of positions are 2@@ 2.@@ 1 % and 2@@ 6.@@ 8 % , respectively , among those jobs that require more knowledge and skills .
some positions for h@@ our@@ ly - paid workers do not require high skills , such as food promotion workers , merchandise hand@@ lers , and unemployed workers who are able to work through simple train@@ ings .
data shows that those h@@ our@@ ly - paid workers who used to be unemployed are 39 % of the total h@@ our@@ ly - paid workers ; among them , workers who used to work in retail business are 6@@ 8.@@ 4 % ; and those in restaurants and food businesses are 5@@ 8.@@ 7 % . the h@@ our@@ ly - paid jobs have become an important channel for unemployed workers to find their employment .

wu bangguo pointed out that the people 's congress is playing more important roles in the process of administration of the nation with laws and construction of the socialist country with legal systems .
for the people 's congress to do a good job in the new situation , the first thing should be to stick to a correct political direction , firmly walk on the develop@@ mental path of socialist politics with chinese features , and organ@@ ically integrate staying with the leadership of the party , people being in charge , and governing the country according to laws .
the second thing should be to focus on the major work of the party and state , important issues in reforms and developments , and working on hot and difficult issues that the masses of people care about , and continuously strengthen the efficiency of the work of the people 's congress .
the third thing should be to fully take advantage of the features and superiority of work in the people 's congress , stick to the democratic centr@@ alization system , do things strictly by law and procedure , and make collective decisions .
it should stick to following the mainstream , regarding peoples ' needs as a priority , using power for people , sen@@ sing peoples ' needs , and bringing benefits to people .
china comes up with an " important science and research plan " for future 15 years
xinhua news agency , beijing , february 9 ( reporter : li xing ) to promote china 's international competitive capacity , vigorously advance sustainable development , and realize a pri@@ or@@ iti@@ zed plan for sur@@ passing ( developed countries ) , the " outline plan for the state 's medium - and long - term scientific and technological development ( 2006 to 20@@ 20 ) , " issued by the state council on the 9@@ th , has arranged four important plans for scientific studies .
the four important scientific plans include prote@@ in studies , quan@@ tu@@ m adjustment and control studies , nan@@ o - studies , and growth and re@@ production studies .
the outline points out that prote@@ in science is the peak of life science that developed countries are fier@@ c@@ ely compe@@ ting for .
in the next 15 years , china should focus on studying trans@@ cri@@ ption repres@@ sion hist@@ o@@ chem@@ istr@@ y , prote@@ in hist@@ o@@ chem@@ istr@@ y , met@@ abol@@ ic hist@@ o@@ chem@@ istr@@ y , structural bi@@ ology , functions and inter@@ actions of prote@@ in bi@@ ology , bi@@ ology and systematic bi@@ ology regarding prote@@ in calcul@@ ation , metho@@ d@@ ology of prote@@ in studies and related application and basic studies , etc.
at the same time , the outline thinks that quan@@ tu@@ m adjustment and control studies has an obvious forward - looking nature , and might significantly impact the economic development of human society to an extent that can hardly be assessed in 20 to 30 years .
china should focus on studying the carrier , adjustment , and control ration@@ al@@ es and methods of quan@@ tu@@ m communication , quan@@ tu@@ m calcul@@ ation , the new quan@@ tu@@ m effect of constr@@ ained small quan@@ tu@@ m systems , quan@@ tu@@ m adjustment and control demonstration , and a new ration@@ ale and technical basis for quan@@ tu@@ m mea@@ su@@ rement , etc.
moreover , the outline points out that nan@@ o - technology has become the strategic selection for many countries to promote their core competitive capacity , and also is one of the fields for china to realize its sur@@ passing development .
in the next 15 years , china will focus on studying in this field , including control@@ l@@ able equipment , self - assembly , and func@@ tion@@ alization of nan@@ o - material , nan@@ o - electronics , nan@@ o - bi@@ ology , nan@@ o - medicine , nan@@ o - size demonstration and me@@ tro@@ log@@ y , and applications of nan@@ o - material and technology in fields such as energy , the environment , information , medicine , etc.
since china 's population is growing on a large scale , there are many birth defec@@ ts , a serious shortage of organs for transp@@ l@@ ants , and the aging peak is coming , it urgently needs to make breakthroughs and technological innovations in the scientific theories on re@@ production and development .
based on the outline , from 2006 to 20@@ 20 , china will focus on studying stem cell re@@ production , differen@@ ti@@ ation , adjustment , and control ; production , mat@@ ur@@ ity , and ferti@@ li@@ zation of re@@ productive c@@ ells ; the mechanism of dec@@ lin@@ ation and de@@ gener@@ ative pa@@ th@@ ological changes in human re@@ productive functions ; and the safety and ethics of assisting re@@ production of stem c@@ ells , and stem cell technology , etc.

the statement says that the speech made by chen shui - bian on january 29 announcing the withdrawal from the national unification association and outline of national unification is another step taken toward " taiwan independence . "
country@@ men from both sides of the strait who long for peace , and the goodwill of taiwan country@@ men who pursue peace , stability , and development , will face a serious challenge .
the statement points out that they firmly oppose the dis@@ sen@@ tion activities of " taiwan independence " that should be contained , and maintaining the peace and stability of regions across the taiwan strait is still the most urgent task for country@@ men across the strait and chinese people in the world at present .
the statement stresses that the argent@@ ine china peaceful unification promotion association is willing to unite with overseas chinese and chinese people from both sides of the strait who live in argentina and stand by the one - china principle , and firmly opposes any form of " taiwan independence , " and actively promo@@ tes china 's peaceful unification .
china 's experts : " china 's military threat " tou@@ ted by the united states is an unreasonable accus@@ ation .
xinhua news agency , beijing , february 9 ( reporters : li xu@@ an@@ liang , xiong zheng@@ yan , lin li@@ ping ) . the qu@@ ad@@ ren@@ n@@ ial defense review formally submitted by the united states pentagon to the congress a few days ago first calls china " a newly ar@@ is@@ en power that is most likely to challenge the united states milit@@ arily . "
experts think that this is an unreasonable accus@@ ation against china 's normal defense construction , and an interference in china 's internal affairs by exag@@ ger@@ ating the " theory of china 's military threat . "
the qu@@ ad@@ ren@@ n@@ ial defense review is a new guidance document for national defense of the pentagon .
this 92 - page report uses three par@@ ag@@ rap@@ h@@ s to discuss the issue of china 's military strength and how the united states should cope with it . the report directly men@@ tions the two terms of " china " and " chinese " 15 times , and says that , " as a major newly ar@@ is@@ en power , china has the most military potential to compete with the united states ; if the united states does not take any countermeasures , china is very likely to develop destruc@@ tive military technology , and break the us supre@@ m@@ acy of traditional weapons . "
yao yun@@ zhu , a research fellow at the world 's military study office of china 's military science academy , said that although senior us officials expressed similar views before , this is the first time for the united states to come up with the idea that " china is most likely to challenge the united states milit@@ arily as a newly ar@@ is@@ en power " in a defense strategy report .
" this report first regards russia , india , and china as newly ar@@ is@@ en strategic ri@@ vals , and especially , p@@ ays more attention to the so - called ' theory of china 's military threat , ' "
said major general peng guang@@ qian , a research fellow at china 's military science academy .
the notic@@ eable thing is that on the same day when the qu@@ ad@@ ren@@ n@@ ial defense review was submitted , us president bush also presented his administrative budget for the 2007 fiscal year to the congress , and the defense budget is as high as 4@@ 3@@ 9.@@ 3 billion dollars in the budget .
" if the budget for military activities in iraq and afghanistan is added , the defense budget for the us in the 2007 fiscal year will break the historical record of 500 billion dollars , " said peng guang@@ qian . " and this almost amounts to the sum of military expenses of all the countries in the world . "
peng guang@@ qian thinks that the us method of making " theories of threats from other countries " reflects its consistent style of " making enemies , " and its real goal is to strive for more defense funds and fish for more profits for the us 's g@@ ig@@ an@@ tic defense industry groups .
experts said that compared with the large military expenses of the us , china 's military expenditure is quite limited .
deng hong@@ zhou , a military expert who has participated in the writing of the china defense white paper many times , said that since the 9@@ 0s of the 20th century , with the economic development , china 's defense funding has been increased to some extent , but it ten@@ ds to fall in its ratio to the state 's financial expenditure in the same periods .
official data shows that comparing 2004 with 1979 , the ratio of china 's defense expenditure in the state 's financial expenditure was decreased nearly 10 percentage points .
china 's defense funding in 2005 was rmb 24@@ 4.@@ 6@@ 56 billion yuan , which only amounts to 1@@ /@@ 14 of that of the us ; military expense per capita is only equal to 1@@ /@@ 60 of that of the us ; and military expense per servic@@ em@@ an is about only 1@@ /@@ 30 of that of the us armed forces .
" the us land area is about as big as china 's , but the gap in military expenditures between ( the two countries ) is so huge that there is no need to point out whose military strength indeed exceeds the needs of a justi@@ fi@@ able defense , "
said peng guang@@ qian .
teng jian@@ qu@@ n , director of the study office at china 's armament control and disarmament association , said that the us side should objec@@ tively comment on china 's military construction , and china 's peaceful development does not mean that china and the united states will become military ri@@ vals in the future .
china 's defense white paper 2004 says that china firmly follows the path of peaceful development and imple@@ ments a defensive policy of national defense .
china never threatened or threat@@ ens or will threaten any countries .
china has never established any military bases in any other countries so far , nor sent any troops to other countries ; but the united states has established more than a hundred overseas military bases , and deployed more than 100,000 troops in the asian region alone .
zhu feng , a professor at the international relations college of beijing university , said that both china and the united states should strengthen communications and exchanges through established channels between the two countries to promote understanding and mutual trust , thoroughly advance the constructive collaboration relation between china and the united states in the new century , and jointly develop and maintain peace and development in the world .

( international observation ) hamas seeks breakthrough in organization of its cabinet
xinhua news agency , ram@@ al@@ lah , february 9 ( international observation ) . hamas seeks breakthrough in organization of its cabinet
xinhua news agency reporters : wang hao and huang min
how the palestinian islamic resistance movement ( hamas ) dra@@ ws the blueprint for its first government after it won the legislative committee election has become the focus that the international community is currently paying attention to .
what kind of a new policy hamas is going to carry out will directly affect the next appropriate policy direction of every party concerned in the peace process .
at the same time , the bo@@ y@@ co@@ t@@ t attitude of the united states and israel has made the prospect of the hamas government more un@@ certain .
currently , all the parties in palestine are consul@@ ting each other ten@@ s@@ ely , and actively looking for breakthroughs in difficulties and sensitive aspects in future development of the cabinet organization .
( sub@@ title ) who will be selected to take the position of prime minister ?
some out@@ sid@@ ers worry that a " hamas prime minister " might have dis@@ agreements with ab@@ b@@ as , the current supreme leader , after hamas win@@ s the right to organize its cabinet .
moreover , a hamas leader , mu@@ sh@@ ir , who is visiting egypt , stressed that a new palestinian government established by hamas leadership will not acknowledge israel . this strong signal has also raised more international concerns .
the united states and israel have clearly stated that they do not accept a hamas government that controls real power , and threatened to stop their economic aid to palestine and suspend transfer@@ ring tax income to the palestinian side .
however , these things do not hin@@ der hamas from adjusting its strategy flexi@@ bly . selection of an independent candidate is one compromise .
as it has been reported , to win maximum acknowle@@ d@@ g@@ ement internationally , the hamas leaders from home and abroad who gathered in egypt a few days ago , had decided to select j@@ am@@ al al-@@ k@@ hu@@ d@@ air@@ i , an independent person who is the ch@@ air of the board of gaz@@ a islamic university , to be the new prime minister .
this move has not been responded to by related parties .
hus@@ se@@ in , a palestinian analy@@ st , said that no matter who is selected as the prime minister , the most important thing is to sof@@ ten the " strong " attitude of hamas as much as possible on the selection of the candidate for prime minister , and only in this way can it as@@ sure the success of the cabinet organization .
( sub@@ title ) how to al@@ locate power
the biggest challenge for hamas in organizing its cabinet is that it lacks sufficient administrative experience from the perspective of its internal capabilities .
an article published by the palestinian daily jour@@ nal analyzed that although hamas has won support from people through social welfare items , it lacks administrative experience , and a better strategy is to collab@@ orate with the palestinian national liberation movement ( fat@@ ah ) , which has administrative experience .
hamas suggested to establish a " political partnership " with fat@@ ah to organize a national coalition government after the election , but fat@@ ah has not actively responded to it so far .
inside fat@@ ah , there are now different opinions on whether it should join the cabinet ; some think it should join the new government to play a role in it ; some refuse the invitation from hamas and would rather become an " active opposition " in the legislative committee .
a well - informed source pointed out that fat@@ ah is gradually le@@ an@@ ing toward joining the new government after ab@@ b@@ as 's persu@@ asion .
even so , fat@@ ah will bar@@ gain with hamas on the allocation of cabinet positions .
moreover , another path is to establish a cabinet that is out of the framework of the legislative committee and free of par@@ tis@@ an le@@ an@@ ings .
as it has been reported , hamas has also designed a p@@ ure te@@ ch@@ no@@ cr@@ atic government , but the concrete name list of the government is unknown .
because of the attitude of the united states and israel , a te@@ ch@@ no@@ cr@@ atic government is a cabinet organization method that can reduce external pressure .
according to regulations of the palestinian " essential law , " nomination of the prime minister and the cabinet organization work will be completed within 3 to 5 weeks after a new legislative committee assum@@ es office on the 16@@ th of this month .
( sub@@ title ) where does the armed wing go ?
another difficult issue for organization of a new government is the weapons in the hands of hamas .
the attitude of the united states and israel is very strong , and they firmly request that hamas give up violence , and refuse its joining the government with its weapons .
hamas leader mu@@ sh@@ ir stressed on the 9@@ th that the armed resistance is the " strategic choice " of the organization .
the armed wing issue includes two aspects of weapons ' legi@@ tim@@ acy and ownership and control of armed w@@ ings .
hamas is acknowledged internationally because it becomes the first big party elected in the legislative committee through a democratic and free method , and the legi@@ tim@@ ati@@ zed path for its armed wing , the q@@ ass@@ am brig@@ ades , is to integrate it into a security organization for the government .
hamas used to sugg@@ est integrating military w@@ ings of all fac@@ tions into a " people 's army " under the palestinian national authority , but it has not received broad respon@@ ses , and has even been criticized by the palestinian islamic organization ( ji@@ had ) .
palestine currently has more than 6@@ 0,000 personnel in security organizations , and most of them come from the fat@@ ah camp .
moreover , fat@@ ah has some armed w@@ ings and ke@@ eps loo@@ se organizational relations with them , such as the " al-@@ a@@ q@@ sa marty@@ r brig@@ ades " and " fat@@ ah haw@@ ks , " etc.
hamas , responsible for the cabinet organization , must make an agreement with ab@@ b@@ as on how to control those self - govern@@ ed armed w@@ ings and reason@@ ably al@@ locate security and administrative power .
as local media reported , ab@@ b@@ as ten@@ ds to control security and intelligence troops ; organizations such as the police and civilian defense can be administr@@ ated by the internal affairs ministry of a new government .
however , all parties concerned are still consul@@ ting each other on this sensitive issue , and have not produced any results .

on november 18 of the same year , china 's 22@@ nd south pol@@ e exploration team left shanghai for zhong@@ shan station at the south pol@@ e to conduct scientific exploration activities , and would leave zhong@@ shan station and return to shanghai through australia before the end of february 2006 .
since it is the first time for china to issue the polar - region exploration report , china 's polar - region exploration report 2005 also trac@@ es back and summar@@ izes china 's polar - region exploration efforts , which started in the 8@@ 0s of the 20th century .
according to the report , china formally joined the ant@@ ar@@ c@@ tic treaty in 198@@ 3 , and became a member country of the ant@@ ar@@ c@@ tic treaty , and a consul@@ ting member country of the ant@@ ar@@ c@@ tic treaty , and a member country of those most influential international organizations of south pol@@ e affairs , respectively , including the scientific committee on ant@@ ar@@ c@@ tic research , and the ant@@ ar@@ c@@ tic bureau president council .
in 1997 , china became a member of the ar@@ c@@ tic science committee , and won its speaking right and decision - making right in international polar - region affairs .
the report points out that in more than 20 years , china 's polar - region explorations have been developed from nothing to having something , and advanced continuously into an initial size . a scientific and exploration system for the south and north pol@@ es , including " three stations and one ship , " has been formed , i.e. the ant@@ ar@@ c@@ tic great wall station established in february 198@@ 5 ; zhong@@ shan ant@@ ar@@ c@@ tic station established in february 1989 ; the ar@@ c@@ tic huang@@ he station established in july 2004 , and the " snow dragon " polar - region exploration ship that has assumed exploration tasks in the ant@@ ar@@ c@@ tic and ar@@ c@@ tic since 1994 .
based on the statistics in the report , china has organized 22 scientific explorations , 2 scientific explorations in the ar@@ c@@ tic by using the " snow dragon " ship as a carrier platform in the ar@@ c@@ tic , and 2 bat@@ ches of explorations around the ar@@ c@@ tic huang@@ he station by the end of 2005 . there have been more than 3,000 person times of team members nationwide so far who have been in the ant@@ ar@@ c@@ tic or ar@@ c@@ tic to do field explorations .
" currently , we are doing investigation work for the feasibility of building the third exploration station in the ant@@ ar@@ c@@ tic , that is also china 's first inland exploration station in the ant@@ ar@@ c@@ tic , "
said sun zhi@@ hui .
" through more than 20 years ' efforts , china 's polar - region exploration cause has played a role in the world 's polar - region explorations . but compared with those major countries of polar - region explorations , there is still a bigger gap ( between china and them ) , and we must catch up with them , "
he said .
sun zhi@@ hui disclosed that china will publish a polar - region exploration report every year in the future .

high - definition t@@ v@@ s have gradually become mainstream in united states
xinhua news agency , new york , february 12 ( reporter : fan xia@@ ol@@ in ) . as the price of high - definition tv is continuously falling and its market is constantly expanding , us tv broadcasting institutions are also eag@@ erly promoting appropriate high definition tv programs .
the just - ended us " super bo@@ w@@ l , " a us type of football game , has become a warm - up competition for us broadca@@ sters to gre@@ et the age of high - definition tv .
as the financial times reported a few days ago , the us congress has recently passed a bill , and regul@@ ates that us broadca@@ sters must completely stop broadcasting current an@@ al@@ og tv signals and trans@@ mit only digital signals by february 17 , 200@@ 9 .
this means that the complete dig@@ ital@@ ization of tv program broadca@@ sts has gotten a clear schedule .
the uni@@ ver@@ sal@@ ization of high definition tv depends not only on consumer tv purchases , but also the making of high definition tv programs by production institutions .
although digital tv has been mentioned in the past several years , it is still not a reality .
but a turning point in this issue appeared this year .
as the us 's consumer electronics association forec@@ a@@ sted , the sales amounts of digital t@@ v@@ s will sur@@ pass that of traditional t@@ v@@ s in the united states for the first time this year , and 85 % of digital t@@ v@@ s are high definition products .
japanese researchers have developed a new type of highly efficient man@@ made kid@@ ney
xinhua news agency , tokyo , february 13 ( reporter : qian zheng ) . researchers at japan 's to@@ kai university have developed a type of man@@ made biological kid@@ ney that can not only function the same as a human kid@@ ney for cat@@ abol@@ ism , but can also keep useful sub@@ stances in the body . since it is small in size and easy to transp@@ l@@ ant , it is hop@@ eful that it will bring good news to patients who have kid@@ ney disease with the further development of the study .
as japan economic and industrial news reported a few days ago , the newly developed man@@ made biological kid@@ ney is composed of two parts . one is the " man@@ made ne@@ ph@@ ron , " which fil@@ ters met@@ abol@@ ites and water in the blood ; the other is the " man@@ made ur@@ inary tu@@ bul@@ es , " which extr@@ act useful sub@@ stances such as water and am@@ in@@ o ac@@ i@@ ds from the original ur@@ ine and sen@@ ds them back into the blood .
both the " man@@ made ne@@ ph@@ ron " and " man@@ made ur@@ inary tu@@ bul@@ es " are made of hol@@ low th@@ read@@ s , and the internal w@@ alls of the " man@@ made ur@@ inary tu@@ bul@@ es " are p@@ av@@ ed with ep@@ i@@ th@@ el@@ ial c@@ ells of ur@@ inary tu@@ bul@@ es that have the function of cat@@ abol@@ ism .
this type of ep@@ i@@ th@@ el@@ ial c@@ ells can treat diseases caused by repeated h@@ emo@@ di@@ aly@@ sis and dec@@ om@@ pose the caus@@ ative substance of " di@@ aly@@ sis - related den@@ at@@ u@@ red star@@ ch " into an am@@ in@@ o ac@@ id , and send it back into the blood . they can also send those sub@@ stances necessary for the human body such as g@@ lu@@ co@@ se , v@@ it@@ am@@ ins , and min@@ er@@ als back into the blood again .
previous man@@ made kid@@ ne@@ ys depend@@ ed on the o@@ smo@@ sis pressure gap of di@@ aly@@ sis to fil@@ ter met@@ abol@@ ites , which cannot totally get rid of them , and does not have the function of making am@@ in@@ o ac@@ i@@ ds and other sub@@ stances return into the blood .
researchers used go@@ ats to do the man@@ made kid@@ ney transp@@ l@@ ant experi@@ ment , and the inner w@@ alls of hol@@ low th@@ read@@ s of the man@@ made kid@@ ney are lined with ep@@ i@@ th@@ el@@ ial c@@ ells from a ho@@ g .
two weeks later , researchers confirmed that the man@@ made kid@@ ney is able to function .
they are currently developing the man@@ made biological kid@@ ney using human kid@@ ney c@@ ells , and are about to do clin@@ ical studies after verification of its safety .
china 's secure power production still faces serious challenges
xinhua news agency , beijing , february 13 ( reporter : an pei ) . a leader of the state power supervision and control committee said on the 13@@ th that although the secure power production generally maintained a stable status in 2005 , secure power production still faces serious challenges .
vice chairman of the state power supervision and control committee shi yu@@ bo said at the fifth ( expanded ) session of the national secure power production committee that in 2005 china 's secure power production was stable in general , and accomplished the task smoothly for power peak usage in the sum@@ mer@@ time , realized a secure power supply , actively cop@@ ed with the strikes of natural disasters , and basically as@@ sured the secure and stable operation of power systems , greatly reduced equipment accidents in secure power production and general power network accidents , compared with those of last year , and the health level of power equipment was increased .
but he pointed out that with changes in power supply and demand situations , and that many of the newly established gener@@ ating sets are put into operation one after another , secure power production will face new challenges .
these challenges include : regional , seas@@ onal , and time inter@@ val power short@@ ages still exist ; power supply and demand situations in some regions are still tense ; since a good mechanism for the price of power and coal has not been formed , supply of power and coal is still quite proble@@ matic ; at the same time , the falling power and coal quality problem has not been effectively controlled , and will seriously affect stable operations of gener@@ ating sets ; some power network structures are fr@@ ag@@ ile and their equipment is ob@@ sol@@ e@@ te , which brings risks to systems ' safety ; frequent oc@@ curren@@ ces of accidents in power infrastructure construction have not completely changed , and the situation is still serious .
shi yu@@ bo said that with the further development of power system reform , many deep - ro@@ oted contradictions will be continuously exposed , and how to maintain stability of employee teams and as@@ sure a normal production order will be a new issue to face .
for the secure power production work in 2006 , shi yu@@ bo said that the basic control secure power production work should be further consolidated ; an emergency control mechanism for power safety should be established and quickly perf@@ ected to strengthen respon@@ sive capabilities for emer@@ gen@@ cies ; coordination between power factories and networks should be strengthened ; security of big dam@@ s should be as@@ sured ; safety control of power facility construc@@ tions should be strengthened to reduce oc@@ curren@@ ces of personnel injur@@ y and death accidents ; information delivery work should be continuously strengthened to as@@ sure the accurate , timely , and smooth flow of power safety information .
it has been learned that based on a new power safety control situation , this year the power supervision and control committee will revise and perfect the issued temporary regulations on accident investigation of power production , and at the same time will continuously issue and execu@@ te additional documents about the safety of the hy@@ dr@@ au@@ lic power station dam and safety protection of the secondary power system this year .
in 2005 , the whole of chinese society used a total power of 24@@ 6@@ 8.@@ 9 billion kw@@ h , and increased 13.@@ 45 % compared with that of last year .
facing the situation in which power supply and demand is still tense , and the unfavorable status of transportation problems with coal , power , and oil , power enterprises have taken effective measures and strengthened equipment control , and preven@@ ted the occurrence of large equipment accidents in national power production in all of last year .
there were 74 power network accidents , which were reduced by 1@@ 27 compared with those of last year ; equipment accidents were 4@@ 27 , which were reduced by 13@@ 2 compared with those of last year .
minister of south africa , in china , says there are no " organized " criminal activities against chinese citizens in south africa
xinhua news agency , beijing , february 13 ( reporters : wang jiang@@ ang and hao y@@ al@@ in ) . charge d@@ '@@ aff@@ ai@@ res ad interim and minister of the south african embassy in china v@@ us@@ i bru@@ ce k@@ olo@@ an@@ e said in an interview with xinhua news agency reporters on the 13@@ th that there are no " organized " criminal activities against chinese citizens in south africa .
he said at the same time that the south african government will make every effort to " strike against all forms of criminal activities . "
v@@ us@@ i bru@@ ce k@@ olo@@ an@@ e stated that the south african government hopes to " reduce the crime rate to zero , " and wants the life and asset securities of every fo@@ reig@@ ner who works in south africa to be fully protected by local laws and citizens .
since 2006 , 4 chinese citizens have been killed , one after another , in south africa , and the chinese world has broad@@ ly paid attention to it .
china 's foreign ministry has cont@@ acted the south african side about the matter , and warned chinese citizens who are travel@@ ing in south africa to increase their awareness of their security and protection , and to strengthen unity and car@@ ing for each other among overseas chinese , and to collab@@ orate with the police to jointly strike against criminal activities .
" we express our since@@ rest sympa@@ thy and condol@@ ences to family members of those victims . "
v@@ us@@ i bru@@ ce k@@ olo@@ an@@ e said , " we are sor@@ ry for this , and we also want the chinese people to believe that the south african government is carefully investigating every case related to the chinese . "
as the embassy of south africa presented , the south african police have successfully broken a case in which chen jian@@ qing , a woman came from fujian , china , was killed on february 5 in south africa , and have arrested a suspect .
the police are sear@@ ching for another suspect at present .
as the south african embassy in china disclosed , the suspect , who is charged with the gun death of a hong kong business@@ man in january of this year , has been arrested by the south african police , and the belong@@ ings of the victim have been recovered .
when talking about the possible impacts of the k@@ ill@@ ings of chinese citizens , v@@ us@@ i bru@@ ce k@@ olo@@ an@@ e thinks that those incidents will " indeed " impact trade , tourism , and exchanges in other fields between the two countries , and produce negative out@@ comes . but in the long run , those impacts " should not be big . "
as tourist atta@@ che of the south african embassy n@@ ian bei@@ xi presented , the embassy issued more than 2,000 vis@@ as for chinese to go to south africa in the first 15 days of this year .
based on the statistical data of the chinese government , south africa had maintained its number one status as china 's biggest trade partner in africa in 2005 .
the bilateral trade amount reached 7.@@ 27 billion us@@ d , and increased 23 % compared with that of last year .
however , people in the tourist industry think that the continuous oc@@ curren@@ ces of killing chinese citizens in 2004 have ap@@ paren@@ tly affected the number of tourists who visited south africa .
based on the statistics of the sigh@@ t@@ seeing bureau of south africa , there were 20@@ ,@@ 3@@ 31 chinese tourists who visited south africa in the first half of 2005 , which were reduced 14.@@ 9 % compared with that of last year .
there are about 200,000 chinese who live in south africa at present , and are sc@@ attered everywhere in the towns and villages of south africa .
analysts here think that since there are big g@@ aps between the rich and poor in south african society , and a high unemployment rate , guns are spread everywhere , and no death penalty , the crime rate is still high there .
because many chinese do not speak english , and they carry cash with them and put cash in their homes , they become easy targets for criminals to attack them for their assets .

many could not help but we@@ ep warm te@@ ars .
zhang wen@@ bin , who was the director of the state 's cultural re@@ lic bureau and an old al@@ um@@ n@@ us of pe@@ king university , told the reporter that , more than ten years ago , when he worked in henan province , he invited professor wang xuan to give a report on scientific and technological innovation for cadres of the provincial party committee .
" the conduct and academic studies of academ@@ ici@@ an wang xuan are the model for us to learn . he made important contributions for the country and society , and people will never forget him . "

mr. jin said that when wang xuan was around more than 50 years old , he started to pay attention to cultivating young people . he had stressed that we should pa@@ ve a path , be willing to become a human l@@ add@@ er , and make way for young people .
" it is not easy at all for a very accomplished scienti@@ st to do this . "

china to implement protection regulation on dissemination rights for information networks
xinhua news agency , beijing , february 15 ( reporters : zhou wei and li fei ) . many networks and websites currently rely on re@@ publishing a lot of news and reports from newspapers and magaz@@ ines to increase their cl@@ ick rates , but many of them are neither authorized , nor pay related fees . to cope with this , director of the copyright department of the state copyright bureau wang zi@@ qiang said in a press conference , held by the news office of the state council on the 15th , that the state council will explain about the implementation of the protection regulation on dissemination rights for information networks , on the issue of paying for re@@ publishing works on the internet .
wang zi@@ qiang said that according to existing laws and regulations , regarding those works published in newspapers , as long as their auth@@ ors did not state that " they cannot be used , " newspapers can use those works without their auth@@ ors ' permission , but at the same time should pay them , and the state copyright bureau has made the payment standard specifically for newspaper re@@ print practices according to the law .
however , according to regulations in existing laws , newspapers have the right to such legal per@@ missions , but the internet currently does not have rights for such legal per@@ missions .
according to related interpre@@ tations made by the people 's supreme court , the legal permission for newspaper re@@ prin@@ ts is applied to the internet , i.e. to any small or short articles published in newspapers or on the internet , whose auth@@ ors did not state that " they cannot be used , " the internet can use them without permission , but at the same time needs to pay their auth@@ ors .
but because the legal interpretation does not determine the payment standard , the internet has not made payments when it used those works in practice .
" regarding whether the internet use of published small or short works ap@@ plies to the legal permission , it still needs to be determined according to the laws . "
wang zi@@ qiang said : " whether it will be included in a category of law depends on the con@@ firm@@ ation of the implementation of the protection regulation on dissemination rights for information networks this year . "

the ch@@ air of the russian independent state affairs committee of the state du@@ ma ( lower house of the parliament ) , k@@ ok@@ o@@ sh@@ in , made a speech and indicated regarding the resolution made by the geor@@ gi@@ an parliament on russia 's peacekeeping troops , on the same day the resolution was published , that the resolution will harm the stability of the situation in that area and neg@@ atively impact the relations between russia and geor@@ gi@@ a .
he stressed that the resolution made by the geor@@ gi@@ an parliament is a further bad step toward dam@@ aging the relations between russia and geor@@ gi@@ a .
he thinks that the geor@@ gi@@ an accus@@ ation against the russian side is absur@@ d .
the geor@@ gi@@ an parliament passed the resolution on that day , and requested russia 's peacekeeping troops to stop their peacekeeping activities in south os@@ se@@ ti@@ a , but did not set a concrete deadline for russia 's peacekeeping troops to withdraw .

leadership teams at every level should be urged to stick to the democratic centr@@ alization system , establish and perfect rules and procedures for meetings and decision - making , and carefully practice the system that integr@@ ates collective leadership with individual responsibility in related fields .
the supervision over the major leader of a leadership team should be emphasized . leaders of organization ( personnel ) departments should frequently talk with and conduct heart - to - heart talks with the major leader of a leadership team at the next lower level to learn the status of his ideology , work , and style of work , etc.
a routine control and supervision system should be established and perf@@ ected for leaders ; the status of ideology and style of work of a leadership team should be regularly learned and analyzed , and suggestions and measures should be come up with to solve problems .
a warning talk and letter in@@ quiry system for leaders should be practiced . once the hin@@ t of a problem emerg@@ es , a warning talk or letter in@@ quiry should be promptly conducted .
as for those obvious problems with leaders reported by the masses , they should be carefully investigated and clari@@ fied ; if a problem is true , the leader concerned should be criticized and educated , or disciplined by appropriate organizational measures ; if any leader viol@@ ates any regulation or law , he or she should be transferred to the law or discipline enforcement organization to be investigated ; if a leader is found innocent through an investigation , a clari@@ fication should be addressed for him or her in a proper manner .

the suggestion requires that organization ( personnel ) departments at every level should truly strengthen the supervision work of selection and appointment of leaders of the party and administrations .
supervision measures on the stages of cadres ' recommendation , nomination , test and review , discussion , and determination , etc. , should be further perf@@ ected , and cadres should be strictly selected and used , and vigorous support should be provided for recommendation and selection of cadres who are politically reliable , talented at their work , maintain a good style of work , and are trusted by the masses of people to take leadership positions at every level .
the implementation status of the regulations for cadre appointment should be reviewed vigorously . any conduct that viol@@ ates the regulations for cadre appointment should be seriously investigated and disciplined , and in@@ dec@@ ent practices and corruption in the use of cadres should be firmly contained .
a supervision and investigation system for any serious violation of regulations for the use of cadres should be practiced to further strengthen supervision , investigation , and disciplinary work .
a system of selection and appointment of cadres - and investigation of their working responsibility - should be established and perf@@ ected . based on the principle that power mat@@ ches responsibility , every stage of the cadres ' selection and appointment work , including the main body of responsibility and content of responsibility , should be scientifically defined , and an investigation method should be clari@@ fied to strengthen investigation work .
the supervision role played by the masses should be fully exerc@@ ised to establish and perfect a reporting mechanism that is " convenient , secure , and highly efficient . "

state safety supervision bureau : contain@@ ment of frequently - occur@@ ring large and major accidents in coal mines is top of this year 's priorities
xinhua news agency , beijing , february 17 ( reporter : liu zheng ) . since four large mine accidents - in each of which around a hundred min@@ ers lost their lives - have continuously occurred , the serious situation of national safe production in the past year has caused " contain@@ ment of frequently - occur@@ ring large and major accidents in coal mines " to become the highest among national safety supervision work priorities for this year .

( winter olympic games : stimul@@ ant ) news analysis : p@@ y@@ lev@@ a incident might be settled by leaving it un@@ settled
xinhua news agency , tur@@ in , february 17@@ . news analysis : p@@ y@@ lev@@ a incident might be settled by leaving it un@@ settled
xinhua news agency reporters : gao peng , ding ying
although italy reiterated that any athletes who are discovered using stimul@@ ants may face the " disaster of being j@@ ailed , " many cases currently demonstrate that it is un@@ likely to happen to russian women 's bi@@ ath@@ l@@ on athle@@ te ol@@ g@@ a p@@ y@@ lev@@ a , who is at the center of the first scand@@ al over stimul@@ ant use at the winter olympic games .
the first stimul@@ ant use scand@@ al at the tur@@ in winter olympic games was exposed on the 16@@ th , and ol@@ g@@ a p@@ y@@ lev@@ a was discovered to have used the illegal and banned drug car@@ p@@ he@@ d@@ on .
the next day , the international olympic committee announced that p@@ y@@ lev@@ a had been th@@ rown out of the winter olympic games , and the silver med@@ al she won for the 15 km women 's bi@@ ath@@ l@@ on had been with@@ drawn .
the same day , the international winter bi@@ ath@@ l@@ on alliance determined to for@@ bid p@@ y@@ lev@@ a to participate in the sport for two years .
the international olympic committee has been implementing the regulation that once athletes are discovered using stimul@@ ants , they will lose their quali@@ fication to participate in the games , and the sco@@ res they achieved will be with@@ drawn , but they are not subject to legal punishment .
however , according to italian law , the carrying and use of stimul@@ ants by any athle@@ te are criminal activities . a law enforcement organization has the right to directly arrest and investigate any athle@@ te who uses stimul@@ ants . any viol@@ ators of the law are subject to j@@ ail for 3 months to 3 years .
the international olympic committee had been " bar@@ gaining " with the italian government for one year , and eventually reached an agreement last december . both sides agreed that during the period of the winter olympic games , any athletes who use stimul@@ ants would be handled according to italian laws .
through the unremitting efforts made by the international olympic committee , the italian side made a compromise four days before the opening cere@@ mon@@ ies of the winter olympic games , and promised that the police would not enter the olympic village to search athle@@ te resid@@ ences during the olympic games . but any athletes whose drug tests show positive will be investigated by italian prosecution organizations .
some reports said that p@@ es@@ can@@ te , an official of the italian government responsible for supervision of the tur@@ in winter olympic games , has transferred p@@ y@@ lev@@ a 's stimul@@ ant case to a tur@@ in prosecution organization .
however , the international olympic committee and p@@ es@@ can@@ te himself have not confirmed this so far .
and@@ re@@ y d@@ my@@ tri@@ e@@ v , a doctor for the russian bi@@ ath@@ l@@ on team , disclosed at no@@ on@@ time on the 17@@ th that p@@ y@@ lev@@ a had left tur@@ in and returned home .
shi k@@ ang@@ cheng , a chinese sports official who had been in a position at the world anti - stimul@@ ant organization for many years , thinks that once p@@ y@@ lev@@ a returns home , this case might eventually " be settled by leaving it un@@ settled . "
shi k@@ ang@@ cheng said that the international olympic committee and the italian government have not " completely addressed " the anti - stimul@@ ant issue at the winter olympic games , and it is hard to say what the outcome would be even if italian prosecution organizations really did get involved in the case .
based on past penalty cases in which italy sentenced or punished its own athletes who used stimul@@ ants , the most serious penalty was merely a " two - year prob@@ ation . "
thus , senior reporter pi@@ ali from the italian an@@ sa said that the possibility of p@@ y@@ lev@@ a being j@@ ailed is " very small , " and at most , she might be fined .
pi@@ ali also said that although an italian court could sentence her by def@@ a@@ ult , it is impossible for the italian police to catch p@@ y@@ lev@@ a abroad and bring her back to serve the sentence .
if p@@ y@@ lev@@ a refuses to accept the sentence , the italian side can do nothing about it .
