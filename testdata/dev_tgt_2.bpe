financial institutions can h@@ ire a security assessment organization to perform e@@ -@@ banking security assess@@ ments as long as the assessment organization comp@@ lies with relevant conditions and requirements , even if its qualifications have not undergone c@@ br@@ c approval . assess@@ ments must however be supervis@@ ed in accordance with relevant regulations .
the electronic banking administration measures are divided into 99 items under nine chap@@ ters covering general principles , application and change of registration , risk management , management of information exchange and transfer , supervision of out - s@@ our@@ cing , supervision of tran@@ s - national business , over@@ sight and administration , legal liability and supplementary provisions .
the electronic banking security assessment guide is divided into 57 items under five chap@@ ters , covering general principles , security assessment organizations , implementation of security assess@@ ments , administration of security assessment activity and supplementary provisions .

( newspaper ex@@ cer@@ pt ) shanghai : part - tim@@ ers and university grad@@ s become main source of h@@ our@@ ly workers .
beijing , fe@@ b@@ . 7 ( xinhua ) the shanghai bureau of labor and social security released on the 6@@ th the " 2006 most recent guidance for h@@ our@@ ly wages " . it covers 120 kinds of positions -- 11 more than the last edition -- and reve@@ als that wages for certain positions previously covered have risen in some cases and fallen in others .
according to estimates by experts at the shanghai bureau of labor and social security , the number of h@@ our@@ ly workers now exceeds one million .
china youth daily has reported that university graduates and part - tim@@ ers are the main source of h@@ our@@ ly workers .
results of a direct survey of nearly 8@@ 000 h@@ our@@ ly workers show that more than half are part - tim@@ ers , with the percentage reaching 5@@ 1.1 % .
the educational level of these part - tim@@ ers is generally high , with most engaged in highly technical labor such as trans@@ lation work , in which part - tim@@ ers make up 8@@ 1.@@ 7 % of the manpower . in the fit@@ ness industry , they occupy up to 6@@ 1.6 % of the positions .
high income is one of the main reasons many people do h@@ our@@ ly part - time work .
according to sources , the monthly income from some positions can be in the tens of thousands of yuan with manpower still being in short supply . simultan@@ eous interpretation is one such example . the monthly income for most h@@ our@@ ly positions -- such as part - time account@@ ants and we@@ d@@ ding masters of ceremony -- can reach 2000 yuan or more .
another important reason that h@@ our@@ ly part - time work has become popular is the desire to satisfy personal interest and expand one 's knowledge .
for example , mr. g@@ u , manager of an enterprise 's human resources department , sp@@ ends several hours each week processing financial accounts for the representative office of a foreign company .
mr. g@@ u says the greatest benefits of part - time work are the continuous upgrading of one 's knowledge and the opportunity to d@@ ab@@ ble in a different field . of course , the 2000 yuan in monthly income is also attrac@@ tive .
because some h@@ our@@ ly positions have a low thre@@ sh@@ old and flexible work arrangements , they are gradually finding favor with many job - seeking graduates . four@@ teen percent of h@@ our@@ ly workers gradu@@ ated from university or technical schools in the last three years .
" initially , i was n't interested in h@@ our@@ ly work . but after a few months , i feel that it is better than a nine - to - five job . "
after young huang gradu@@ ated from university , he could not find a job he li@@ ked . finally , he signed up at a hotel to play background music on a pi@@ an@@ o .
" at 100 yuan an hour and with the good environment , i am very satisfied with my job . what i need now is to find more h@@ our@@ ly jobs . "
according to reports , h@@ our@@ ly jobs have become an important route for job - hun@@ ting graduates to accumul@@ ate work experience , h@@ one their work skills , improve their communication skills and gain increased social experience .
graduates doing h@@ our@@ ly work are mostly concentrated in positions requiring a high level of knowledge and skills , such as highly specialized trans@@ l@@ ating positions and positions involving highly contemporary art or entertainment work . these two fields account for 2@@ 2.@@ 1 % and 2@@ 6.@@ 8 % respectively .
some h@@ our@@ ly positions , such as fo@@ od@@ stu@@ ff sal@@ es@@ persons and shipping cl@@ er@@ ks , do not require a high level of skill and can be filled by unemployed persons following some simple training .
data shows that the unemployed make up 39 % of h@@ our@@ ly workers . the proportion of unemployed workers is as high as 6@@ 8.@@ 4 % in retail - related positions and 5@@ 8.@@ 7 % in cat@@ ering - related positions . h@@ our@@ ly work has become an important path to employment for the unemployed .

chinese experts : us making ground@@ less accus@@ ations by playing up " china military threat "
beijing , fe@@ b@@ . 9 ( xinhua ) ( reporters : li xu@@ an@@ liang , xiong zheng@@ yan , lin li@@ ping ) in the qu@@ ad@@ ren@@ n@@ ial defense review it formally submitted recently to congress , the us pentagon has said for the first time that china is " the emerging power that has the greatest potential to milit@@ arily challenge the united states . "
experts say this is unreasonable f@@ ing@@ er - pointing at china 's normal defense construction , an exag@@ g@@ eration of the " chinese military threat " and an interference in china 's internal affairs .
the qu@@ ad@@ ren@@ n@@ ial defense review is the pentagon 's new national defense guidelines .
the 92 - page report de@@ votes three par@@ ag@@ rap@@ h@@ s to the issue of china 's military and the countermeasures the united states should take . the report makes 15 direct re@@ ferences to " china " or " chinese " and says that " as an important emerging power , china has the greatest potential to compete milit@@ arily with the united states . if the united states fails to take countermeasures , china will very likely field disru@@ p@@ tive military technologies that could off@@ set traditional u.s. military advantages " .
yao yun@@ zhu , resear@@ cher with the department of world military research at the chinese academy of military sciences , said that although senior us officials have expressed similar viewpoints on various earlier occasions , this is the first time that the us has said in the defense report that " china is the major emerging power that has the greatest potential to compete milit@@ arily with the united states " .
" it is the first time that this report has explicitly referred to russia , india and china as rising strategic oppon@@ ents and , in particular , focused more on the so - called ' chinese military threat ' , "
said major general peng guang@@ qian , a resear@@ cher at the chinese academy of military sciences .
worthy of note is that on the same day the qu@@ ad@@ ren@@ n@@ ial defense review was officially submitted , us president bush also submitted the government budget for the 2007 fiscal year to congress . it included us@@ $ 4@@ 3@@ 9@@ . 3@@ b@@ n ear@@ marked for national defense .
" if the budget supple@@ m@@ ented for military operations in iraq and afghanistan is included , the american national defense budget for the 2007 fiscal year will top us@@ $ 5@@ 00@@ b@@ n to reach an all - time high , " peng guang@@ qian said . " this is almost equal to the total of the defense expenditures of the rest of the world 's countries . "
peng guang@@ qian says fabric@@ ation of " foreign threats " by the united states reflects the pentagon 's consistent style of " manufacturing enemies " , and that its real intention is to secure more defense funds so as to bring in more profits for the col@@ os@@ s@@ al weapons industry groups of the united states .
experts say that compared to the huge military expenditure of the united states , china 's national defense spending is very limited .
military expert deng hong@@ zhou , who has participated several times in the comp@@ il@@ ation of the white book on chinese national defense , said that since the 199@@ 0s china 's national defense spending has indeed increased as its economic has developed , but its proportion of the national financial expenditure in the same period has shown an overall down@@ ward trend .
official data shows that compared with 1979 , the proportion that china 's 2004 national defense expenditure took in the national financial expenditure in the same period dropped by nearly 10 % .
in 2005 , china 's national defense expenditure was r@@ m@@ b@@ 2@@ 44 . 6@@ 5@@ 6@@ b@@ n , equal to only 1@@ /@@ 14 that of the us ; the per capita military expenditure was equal to only about 1@@ /@@ 60 that of the us and military expenditure per servic@@ em@@ an was equal to 1@@ /@@ 30 that of the us military .
" the us is about as large as china in terms of territory , but the difference in their military spending is so great . it is self - evident whose military power has exceeded the needs of legitimate defense , "
peng guang@@ qian said .
teng jian@@ qu@@ n , director of the research department of the china association of armament control and disarmament , says that the us should objec@@ tively evalu@@ ate china 's military construction and adds that china 's peaceful development does not mean that china and the us will become military ad@@ vers@@ aries in the future .
the 2004 china national defense white book says that china ke@@ eps firmly to the road of peaceful development and imple@@ ments a defensive national defense policy .
china is no threat to any country , either in the past , at present or in the future .
to date , china has established no military base in any other country and has not sent even a single soldier to another country . in contrast , the us ke@@ eps some 100 military bases abroad and has deployed 100,000 troops in asian alone .
professor zhu feng of the college of international relations , beijing university says china and the us should use existing channels to increase communication and exchange , improve mutual understanding and trust , promote a constructive sino - us partnership in the new century and jointly promote and maintain world peace and development .

( international observation ) hamas seeks breakthrough in forming cabinet
ram@@ al@@ lah , fe@@ b@@ . 9 ( xinhua ) ( international observation ) hamas seeks breakthrough in forming cabinet
( xinhua reporters : wang hao , huang min )
following the victory of palestine 's islamic resistance movement ( hamas ) in parliamentary elections , how the new government will be laid out has become a focus of international attention .
what kind of policies hamas carries out will directly influence the policy directions taken by the various parties involved in the peace process .
at the same time , the resist@@ ant attitude of the us and israel will be an additional vari@@ able in the prospects of the hamas - lead government .
at present , the different palestinian sides are stepping up discussions in an active qu@@ est for a breakthrough in problems and sensitive issues that the cabinet formation poses toward future development of the situation .
( subhead ) who will become prime minister ?
since hamas won the right to form a cabinet , some out@@ sid@@ ers have expressed worry that a split could take place between the " hamas prime minister " and the palestinian leader , ab@@ b@@ as .
in addition , the leader of hamas , mas@@ ha@@ al , who is currently visiting egypt , stressed that a palestinian government formed by the leaders of hamas would not recognize israel , a hard - line signal that heigh@@ tened international concern .
the us and israel have clearly stated they will not accept a hamas - led government with real power and have threatened to cut off economic aid to palestine and free@@ ze the transfer of tax revenues .
but this has not preven@@ ted hamas from carrying out some ag@@ ile strategic adjustments , including a compromise policy of selecting independ@@ ents .
according to reports , in order to maxim@@ ize recognition from the international community , in recent days overseas and domestic leaders of hamas gathered in egypt decided to select an independent figure , is@@ mail han@@ i@@ ye@@ h , chairman of the board of gaz@@ a islamic university , to become the new prime minister .
concerned parties have not yet responded to the move .
palestinian analy@@ st h@@ is@@ ha@@ m said that , whoever takes over the prime - minist@@ ership , the most important thing is that the person should be capable of ton@@ ing down hamas ' hard - line character , since only in this way can the success of the cabinet be guaranteed .
( subhead ) how will authority be distributed ?
from an internal perspective , the biggest challenge faced by the hamas - led cabinet is a lack of adequate experience in power .
an analysis in an article in the palestinian daily al-@@ ay@@ yam said that hamas gained popul@@ arity through social welfare projects but l@@ acked experience in office . cooperation with the palestinian national liberation movement , or fat@@ ah , will be the best solution .
after the election , hamas raise the possibility of a " political partnership " with fat@@ ah and the joint establishment of a national coalition government , but until now fat@@ ah has not given a positive response .
fat@@ ah is inter@@ n@@ ally split regarding whether to participate in the cabinet . one faction advocates taking part in the new government in order to have some s@@ way ; another faction refuses the invitation by hamas and wants instead to be " an active opposition " in parliament .
informed sources say fat@@ ah , with persu@@ asion coming from ab@@ b@@ as , is gradually le@@ an@@ ing toward participating in the new government .
even so , hamas and fat@@ ah will still ha@@ gg@@ le over the distribution of cabinet posts .
another path would be to establish a cabinet outside the parliamentary framework and ign@@ ore party aff@@ iliation .
according to reports , hamas has also laid out a government composed uni@@ qu@@ ely of experts , but the actual name list is still unknown .
in view of us and israeli at@@ ti@@ tu@@ des , a government of technical experts is a way of forming a cabinet that will help ligh@@ ten pressure from outside .
palestine 's basic law provides that the nam@@ ing of the prime minister and the cabinet will take three to five weeks to complete once the new parliament takes over on the 16@@ th of this month .
( subhead ) how do the weapons fit in ?
hamas ' weapons constitute another thor@@ ny issue in the forming of the new government .
the us and israel have an extremely hard - line attitude , in@@ sist@@ ing that hamas ren@@ oun@@ ce violence and refusing to let it take part in the government while armed .
the leader of hamas , mas@@ ha@@ al , emphasized on the 9@@ th that armed resistance is the organization 's " strategic choice " .
the issue of weapons in reality includes two levels : the leg@@ ality of weapons and the administration of jurisdiction over armed forces .
that hamas became the largest party in parliament through a democratic and free election has been recognized internationally . it will , through simil@@ arly legal methods , try to integrate its armed branch , the al-@@ q@@ ass@@ am brigade , into the government 's security apparatus .
hamas has flo@@ ated in the past the idea of unifying all the armed fac@@ tions into a palestinian national force , or " people 's army " , but the idea was not widely acknowledged and was even criticize by the palestine islamic ji@@ had .
palestine currently has 6@@ 0,000 security personnel , the vast majority of which are from the fat@@ ah camp .
in addition , fat@@ ah also has some loo@@ se organizational ties to aff@@ ili@@ ated armed fac@@ tions such as the al-@@ a@@ q@@ sa marty@@ rs brigade and the fat@@ ah haw@@ ks .
responsible for forming a cabinet , hamas will have to come to terms with fat@@ ah regarding how to manage these various self - governing armed groups and reason@@ ably distribu@@ te power over the security administration .
according to local media reports , ab@@ b@@ as wants to over@@ see the security and intelligence forces . the police and civil defense forces would be over@@ seen by the internal affairs department of the new government .
but the various sides are still negoti@@ ating this sensitive issue and until now there have been no developments .

because it is china 's first polar expedi@@ tion report , the 2005 china annual polar exploration report also includes a retro@@ spec@@ tive and summary of china 's explor@@ atory undertakings in the polar regions since they began in the 198@@ 0s .
according to the report , china officially joined the ant@@ ar@@ c@@ tic treaty in 198@@ 3 , becoming a member country of the ant@@ ar@@ c@@ tic treaty organization and other most influential international organizations for ant@@ ar@@ c@@ tic affairs , including ant@@ ar@@ c@@ tic treaty consultative meeting , the scientific committee on ant@@ ar@@ c@@ tic research and council of managers of national ant@@ ar@@ c@@ tic programs .
in 1997 , china became a member of the international ar@@ c@@ tic science committee , winning the right to speak and participate in decision - making in international polar affairs .
the report points out that over a period of more than 20 years china 's polar explorations " started from s@@ cr@@ at@@ ch , continuously developed and took on scale " , now consist@@ ing of a " three stations , one vessel " system for scientific exploration in the ant@@ ar@@ c@@ tic and ar@@ c@@ tic ; that is : the ant@@ ar@@ c@@ tic great wall station set up in february 198@@ 5 , the ant@@ ar@@ c@@ tic zhong@@ shan station set up in february 1989 , the ar@@ c@@ tic yellow river station set up in july 2004 and " snow dragon " polar expedi@@ tion ship that has carried out ar@@ c@@ tic and ant@@ ar@@ c@@ tic exploration functions since 1994 .
according to statistics contained in the report , as of the end of 2005 , china had organized 22 scientific ant@@ ar@@ c@@ tic expedi@@ tions , 2 ar@@ c@@ tic scientific expedi@@ tions using the snow dragon as a carrier platform and 2 ar@@ c@@ tic expedi@@ tions at the yellow river station . so far , more than 3@@ 000 chinese expedi@@ tion@@ ers have participated in field investigations in the ar@@ c@@ tic and ant@@ ar@@ c@@ tic regions .
" we are currently conducting research on the feasibility of a third ant@@ ar@@ c@@ tic exploration station . this is also china 's first feasibility study into an inland station in ant@@ ar@@ c@@ tic@@ a . "
said sun zhi@@ hui .
" after more than 20 years of endeavor , china has now gained a footing in world polar exploration . however , compared to other major polar exploration countries , there still exists a large gap and we must catch up , "
he said .
sun zhi@@ hui revealed that china will issue a report on polar expedi@@ tions on an annual basis in the future .

tokyo , february 13 ( xinhua ) ( reporter : qian zheng ) researchers at to@@ kai university in japan have developed a bio@@ arti@@ ficial kid@@ ney . it not only possesses the same cat@@ abol@@ ic functions as a human kid@@ ney , but at the same time is also able to retain useful material components . addi@@ tionally , it is small in size and easy to transp@@ l@@ ant . as more detailed research is carried out , there is hope that it could be good news for people with kid@@ ney disease .
according to a recent report by the japan light industry news , the newly developed bio@@ arti@@ ficial kid@@ ney consists primarily of two parts . one part is composed of " arti@@ ficial ne@@ phr@@ ons " that fil@@ ter met@@ abol@@ ic matter and water from blood ; the other part consists of the " arti@@ ficial ren@@ al tu@@ bul@@ es " the ex@@ trac@@ ts water , am@@ in@@ o ac@@ i@@ ds and other useful elements from the primary ur@@ ine and returns them to the blood .
the arti@@ ficial ne@@ phr@@ ons and the arti@@ ficial ren@@ al tu@@ bul@@ es are all made from hol@@ low sil@@ k thre@@ ad . the inner wall of the arti@@ ficial ren@@ al tu@@ bul@@ es is also covered with a la@@ yer of tu@@ bu@@ le ep@@ i@@ th@@ el@@ ial c@@ ells capable of breaking down waste .
this kind of ep@@ i@@ th@@ el@@ ial cell can cause the materials that lead to a disease st@@ em@@ ming from chron@@ ic di@@ aly@@ sis -- di@@ aly@@ sis - related am@@ y@@ lo@@ id@@ o@@ sis -- to be broken down into am@@ in@@ o ac@@ i@@ ds and then returned to the blood . at the same time , it can also cause the g@@ lu@@ co@@ se , v@@ it@@ am@@ ins and min@@ er@@ als needed by the body to re@@ enter the blood .
in the past , arti@@ ficial kid@@ ne@@ ys have reli@@ ed on differences in o@@ smo@@ tic pressure to fil@@ ter met@@ abol@@ ic waste but have been unable to eliminate it completely . they were also unable to return am@@ in@@ o ac@@ i@@ ds and other components to the blood .
the researchers conducted experimental transp@@ l@@ ants of the bio@@ arti@@ ficial kid@@ ney in go@@ ats . ep@@ i@@ th@@ el@@ ial c@@ ells from pig@@ s were used to make the inner wall of the hol@@ low th@@ read@@ s of the arti@@ ficial kid@@ ney .
two weeks later , the researchers confirmed that the arti@@ ficial kid@@ ney had successfully served its function .
they are currently developing a bio@@ arti@@ ficial kid@@ ney that uses human kid@@ ney c@@ ells and will conduct clin@@ ical studies after its safety has been veri@@ fied .
safe electricity production in china still faced with difficult challenges
beijing , fe@@ b@@ . 13 ( xinhua ) ( reporter : an pei ) an official with the state electricity regulatory commission ( ser@@ c ) said on the 13@@ th that although the safe production of electricity remained stable on the whole in 2005 , it still faces difficult challenges .
ser@@ c vice chairman shi yu@@ bo said at the fifth ( expanded ) meeting of the national electricity safe production committee held here that china 's safe production of electric power was generally stable in 2005 , with the task of sup@@ plying power during the peak summer period being satisfactorily fulfilled and the safe supply of power being realized . the impact of natural disasters was actively coun@@ tered , thereby essenti@@ ally ensuring the safe and stable operation of the electric power system . accidents involving safe power production equipment or the general power gri@@ d showed a dram@@ atic year - on - year reduction , while the health of power equipment was improved .
but he also pointed out that changes in power supply and demand and the coming on line of a series of newly built power - gener@@ ating systems imp@@ lied new challenges for the safe production of electric power .
these challenges include the following : electricity short@@ ages will continue to exist on a region - specific , season - specific and time - specific basis ; the supply of power remains stre@@ t@@ ched in some regions ; major problems still exist in the supply of electricity and coal because of the lack of a positive mechanism for pric@@ ing them ; at the same time , the wor@@ s@@ ening quality of coal has not yet been brought under effective control , seriously affecting the stable operation of power - gener@@ ating sets ; the weak structure and out@@ dated equipment of some power gri@@ ds cause hidden problems in system safety ; the frequent occurrence of accidents in the construction of electric power infrastructure has not been turned around and the situation remains grave .
shi yu@@ bo said contradictions bu@@ ried at deeper levels will continuously be exposed as reform per@@ me@@ ates further into the electric power system . the new problem faced will be how to maintain stability within employee ranks and ensure normal , orderly production .
discussing about the safe production of electric power in 2006 , shi yu@@ bo said it was necessary to further strengthen basic initiatives for the management of safe power production ; speed up the establishment and improvement of the emergency control mechanism for electricity safety and enhance emergency reaction capabilities ; step up coordination and team work between plants and gri@@ ds in the joint maintenance of the safety of the electricity system ; continue a high standard of safety supervision and inform@@ atization efforts for hydro@@ electric dam@@ s in order to ensure dam safety ; tighten control over safety in electricity - related construction work so as to reduce casualties ; and continue to reinforce the submission of information to ensure the accur@@ acy , tim@@ el@@ iness and smooth communication of electricity safety information .
according to reports , in keeping with the new situation in electricity safety management , cer@@ c will this year revise and improve the already promulgated interim regulations on investigations into electricity production accidents . at the same time , cer@@ c will also issue support documents concerning the safety of hydro@@ electric dam@@ s and the safety protection of secondary electricity systems this year .
the power consumption of chinese society in 2005 reached 2.@@ 4@@ 6@@ 89 trillion kw@@ h , regi@@ stering a year - on - year rise of 13.@@ 45 % .
confron@@ ted with the ta@@ ut@@ ness of power supply and prominent difficulties in the transportation of co@@ als and fuels , electric power enterprises took effective measures to improve equipment management so that all last year no major equipment accident occurred in the national electricity production .
there were 74 power gri@@ d accidents , representing a year - on - year decrease of 1@@ 27 , and 4@@ 27 equipment accidents , for a year - on - year decrease of 13@@ 2 .
sa envoy : no organized criminal activities against chinese nationals in south africa
beijing , fe@@ b@@ . 13 ( xinhua ) ( reporters : wang jiang@@ ang , hao y@@ al@@ in ) v@@ us@@ i b@@ . k@@ olo@@ an@@ e , charge d@@ '@@ aff@@ ai@@ res of the south african embassy in china , said on the 13@@ th in an exclusive interview with a xinhua reporter that there in no organized criminal effort against chinese nationals in south africa .
he also said the south african government would do everything possible to " fight all forms of criminal activity . "
v@@ us@@ i b@@ . k@@ olo@@ an@@ e said that the south african government hopes to " reduce the crime rate to zero " and wants the safety of the lives and property of every fo@@ reig@@ ner working in south africa to be fully guaranteed by the local law and citizens .
so far , four chinese citizens have been mur@@ dered in south africa in 2006 , causing a widespread expression of concern from the chinese community .
china 's ministry of foreign affairs has raised the issue with south africa and warned chinese citizens travel@@ ing to south africa to be more aware of safety precau@@ tions . it also called on overseas compatriots to strengthen unity and friendly care between themselves while also coordinating with police in fighting crime .
" we express our since@@ rest symp@@ ath@@ ies and condol@@ ences to the families of those killed . "
v@@ us@@ i b@@ . k@@ olo@@ an@@ e said , " we feel sor@@ ry for what has happened and ask the chinese people to believe that the government of south africa is thoroughly investigating every case involving chinese . "
according to the chinese embassy in south africa , south african police have successfully solved the case of chen jian@@ qing , a woman from fujian , china who was mur@@ dered in south africa on february 5@@ . one suspect has been arrested .
police are currently hun@@ ting another suspect .
furthermore , the south african embassy in china has revealed that south african police have arrested a suspect in the shooting death of a hong kong business@@ man in january this year and that the victim 's poss@@ essions have been recovered .
speaking of the impact that the killing of chinese citizens might have , v@@ us@@ i b@@ . k@@ olo@@ an@@ e said that the incidents would " definitely " have a negative impact on business , tourism and other areas of interaction between the two countries , but the impact would " probably be fairly small " in the long run .
according to man@@ q@@ ob@@ a n@@ y@@ embe@@ zi , tourism atta@@ che with the south african embassy in china , the south african embassy issued more than 2,000 vis@@ as to chinese nationals in the first 15 days of this year .
according to official chinese statistics , south africa continued to remain china 's largest trade partner in africa in 2005 .
bilateral trade grew 23 % year - on - year to us@@ $ 7@@ . 27@@ b@@ n .
however , tourism industry sources said the ser@@ ial k@@ ill@@ ings of chinese citizens in south africa in 2004 had a marked influence on the number of tourists travel@@ ing to south africa .
statistics from the south african tourism board show that 20@@ ,@@ 3@@ 31 chinese tourists visited south africa in the first half of 2005 , representing a year - on - year decrease of 14.@@ 9 % .
approximately 200,000 chinese currently live in south africa . they are spread throughout south africa 's cities , town and villages .
analysts here have attribu@@ ted the consistently high rate of crime to the large wealth gap in south african society , high unemployment , the rampant use of guns and the lack of a death penalty to serve as a deterrent .
because many chinese do not understand english , they keep cash on their person and in their homes , making is e@@ asi@@ er to become the target of an attack by criminals seeking money .

china to issue information network transmission right protection regulations
beijing , february 15 ( xinhua ) ( reporters : zhou wei , li fei ) many websites rely on large - scale re@@ transmission of news reports from newspapers and magaz@@ ines to increase h@@ its . but many have not been authorized to do so and have not paid any fees . to counter this , said director - general of the copyright department of the national copyright administration wang zi@@ qiang at a news conference held by the state council on the 15th , the state council 's im@@ pending information network transmission right protection regulations will respond to the issue of fees for the transmission of internet works .
wang zi@@ qiang said that according to the laws and regulations currently in effect , works already published in a newspaper or magazine , if an auth@@ or fails to make a " not for use " declaration , magaz@@ ines and newspapers can use the work without the auth@@ or 's permission but at the same time be required to pay remuneration . in accordance with the provisions of rules and regulations , the state copyright bureau has specially formulated remuneration standards for re@@ transmission of newspapers and magaz@@ ines .
however , according to the laws and regulations currently in effect , while newspapers and magazine have the legal right to require authorization , internet sites do not have the same right .
according to a related judicial interpretation by the supreme people 's court , the method in which the legal right to require authorization is applied to newspapers and magaz@@ ines can be applied to the internet , so that short articles published in newspapers , magaz@@ ines and on the internet can be used on the internet without acqu@@ iring permission if the auth@@ or has not made a " do not use " declaration , with the user being required to pay remuneration .
but because the judicial interpretation does not make any stipulations regarding remuneration standards , in practice no remuneration is being paid when these works are used on the internet .
" on the issue of whether legal authorization ap@@ plies to the use on the internet of short articles that have already been published , this still needs to be determined at the legal level . "
wang zi@@ qiang said : " whether or not it is to be included within a scope determined by law , it is still necessary to wait for the information network transmission protection regulations to be issued this year in order to make a con@@ firm@@ ation .

he said geor@@ gi@@ a 's accus@@ ations toward russia were pre@@ post@@ erous .
the resolution passed by the geor@@ gi@@ an parliament on that day called for russia 's peacekeeping forces to hal@@ t their peacekeeping activities in south os@@ se@@ ti@@ a but did not stipul@@ ate an actual time limit for russian peace@@ ke@@ e@@ pers to withdraw .

um@@ c 's chairman at the time , ts@@ ao h@@ sing - cheng , publicly stated after the event that um@@ c had not b@@ reached any of the taiwan government 's regulations and that um@@ c 's help to he@@ jian technology was in um@@ c 's long - term interest because um@@ c would lose business opportunities if it failed to quickly enter the mainland market .
afterwards , the taiwan government 's financial supervisory commission fined um@@ c n@@ t@@ $ 3 million for contr@@ av@@ ening regulations on the dis@@ closure of business information .
um@@ c 's board accepted ts@@ ao h@@ sing - cheng 's resignation on january 9 , 2006 . a few hours later , ts@@ ao h@@ sing - cheng was officially indic@@ ted for alleged illegal investment in the mainland .

state administration of work safety : cur@@ bing major and extraordinary coal mine accidents is most urgent task this year
beijing , fe@@ b@@ . 17 ( xinhua ) ( reporter : liu zheng ) following a str@@ ing of four mining disasters that took the lives of over one hundred people , the grim status of national production safety over the past year has made " cur@@ bing major and extraordinary coal mine accidents " the most urgent task in national work safety this year .
this reporter was informed on the 17@@ th by the state administration of work safety that coal mines must be given top priority if major and extraordinary coal mine accidents are truly going to be cur@@ bed .
to make coal mines saf@@ er this year , the state administration of work safety will take a strong hold over the following three items :
-- continue to wage an aggressive fight to control gas .
control of gas this year must give promin@@ ence to " dr@@ aining gas before mining coal " .
if high g@@ assy mines fail to " dra@@ in gas before mining coal " , they will be legally ordered to immediately hal@@ t production .
-- continue to wage an aggressive fight to consolidate and close mines .
the 5@@ 2@@ 43 coal - mine and coal - p@@ it clo@@ sures already announced to the public must be carried out one by one , as must the more than seven hundred other clo@@ sures recently announced in various regions .
clo@@ sures must become a part of routine work , with coal mines that destroy resources , pollu@@ te the environment and fail to meet safety requirements being shu@@ t down without rel@@ ent .
-- strengthen administration of coal - mine safety infrastructure .
the deteri@@ oration of management in the small number of large state - owned mines must immediately be correc@@ ted and controlled , while small mines with dis@@ organized management should be guided in the building of standardized safety management systems .
in particular , key state - owned mines should be tigh@@ tly controlled in order to strictly prohi@@ bit production in exc@@ ess of capacity , strength or manpower .
the safe production control standard for this year calls for a 3 % drop over last year in the number of deaths nation@@ ally from all types of accidents , including a 3.5 % drop in accidents in coal mines .
major accidents with a death toll higher than ten must decrease at least 5 % , while in the coal mines they must decrease 7 % .
these control standards have been trans@@ mitted to the people 's governments of the various provinces . the various regions are breaking them up into their various la@@ yers and implementing them at the grassroots and enterprise levels .
statistics show that nation@@ ally 5@@ 9@@ 86 people were killed in coal mine accidents in 2005 , which represents a 0.7 % decrease year on year .
but there were more large accidents in which ten or more people were killed , with the number of deaths increasing 6@@ 6.@@ 6 % year on year .

( winter olympic games ・@@ d@@ oping ) news analysis : p@@ y@@ lev@@ a incident likely to end un@@ settled
tur@@ in , fe@@ b@@ . 17 ( xinhua ) news analysis : p@@ y@@ lev@@ a incident likely to end un@@ settled
( reporters : gao peng , ding ying )
italy has reiterated on several occasions that all athletes found d@@ oping during the tur@@ in winter olympics could face a " prison term " , but judging from things as they stand now , chan@@ ces are sli@@ m that this will happen to russian bi@@ athle@@ te ol@@ g@@ a p@@ y@@ lev@@ a , leading figure in the first d@@ oping scand@@ al of these winter olympics .
on the 16@@ th , the tur@@ in winter olympics saw its first d@@ oping scand@@ al un@@ covered when ol@@ g@@ a p@@ y@@ lev@@ a was found to have used car@@ p@@ he@@ dr@@ on , a banned drug .
the following day , the international olympic committee announced that p@@ y@@ lev@@ a had been exp@@ elled from the winter olympics and stri@@ pped of the silver med@@ al she won for the women 's 15@@ km individual bi@@ ath@@ l@@ on at these winter olympics .
the same day , the international winter bi@@ ath@@ l@@ on union decided to ban her from competition for two years .
it has been a consistent rule of the international olympic committee that any athle@@ te found to have used performance - enhancing drugs at an olympics games will have his or her result cancelled and be dis@@ qualified from participation , but will receive no legal penalty .
but under italian law , athletes commit a crime by carrying and using stimul@@ ants . judicial authorities have the power to directly arrest and investigate all athletes that use performance - enhancing drugs and punish viol@@ ators with prison terms ranging from three months to three years .
in december last year , after one year of " bar@@ gaining " , the international olympic committee and the italian government finally reached an accord under which the two sides agreed to handle incidents involving d@@ oping athletes during this winter olympics in accordance with italian laws .
following unremitting efforts by the international olympic committee , italian authorities conce@@ ded four days before the opening of the winter olympics to a promise that police would not enter the olympic village to search athletes ' d@@ well@@ ings during the winter olympic games . but athletes whose drug test pro@@ ves positive will still be subject to investigation by italian prosecu@@ tors .
reports say that p@@ es@@ can@@ te , the italian government official supervising the tur@@ in winter olympics , had referred the p@@ y@@ lev@@ a d@@ oping incident to prosecu@@ tors in tur@@ in .
but neither the international olympic committee nor p@@ es@@ can@@ te himself has yet confirmed the report .
russian bi@@ ath@@ l@@ on team doctor and@@ re@@ y d@@ my@@ tri@@ e@@ v disclosed at noon on the 17@@ th that p@@ y@@ lev@@ a had left tur@@ in to return to her country .
shi k@@ ang@@ cheng , a chinese sports official who worked for years in the world anti - d@@ oping agency , said that once p@@ y@@ lev@@ a returned home the case would very likely end up un@@ settled .
shi k@@ ang@@ cheng added that the international olympic committee and the italian government had never been " thorough " in their anti - d@@ oping drive at the winter olympics and the outcome would be hard to predic@@ t even if italian prosecu@@ tors did step in .
based on past in@@ stances of punishment handed down to italian athletes that have used performance - enhancing drugs , the har@@ sh@@ est punishment imposed on viol@@ ators was no more than " two years of prison term served on prob@@ ation " .
for this reason , senior reporter of italy 's an@@ sa [ pei ai ] predicted that the possibility of p@@ y@@ lev@@ a going to prison was " exce@@ ed@@ ingly sli@@ m " and that a fine would be the most she would receive .
also said that although an italian court can pass judgment in ab@@ senti@@ a , it would be impossible for the italian police to bring her back from a foreign country for a prison term .
if p@@ y@@ lev@@ a refused to accept a judgment , there would be no way italian authorities could de@@ tain her .

with little delay , camer@@ o@@ on 's government also set up an epidemic monitoring network covering the entire border . the country 's pa@@ ste@@ ur center and the national veter@@ inary laboratory are also on an on - call state of alert so that laboratory tests related to the h 5@@ n@@ 1 virus can be initiated at any time .
in europe , den@@ mark and swe@@ den prelimin@@ arily ruled out the presence of the disease .
laboratory test results released by swe@@ den 's national veter@@ inary institute show that the swe@@ dis@@ h sw@@ ans found dead wednesday were not infected with the bird flu virus .
preliminary laboratory results by den@@ mark 's national veter@@ inary administration have also indicated that thir@@ ty dead sw@@ ans found recently within den@@ mark 's borders were not infected with the bird flu virus .
but the department of agriculture said that den@@ mark cannot yet lower its guard .

in asia , the government of bang@@ lad@@ esh has taken all necessary measures to prevent bird flu .
the government 's department of li@@ ve@@ stock services has provided books on the prevention of bird flu to relevant officials and at the same time has organized training for poultry farmers .
