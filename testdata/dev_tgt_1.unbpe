afp , london , 6th .
london daily express pointed out that two laptop computers , which contain investigation materials about the car accident and death of princess diana in 1997 , were stolen from the office of the former metropolitan police chief .
the report pointed out that this larceny case has brought people 's speculation that those computers might conceal confidential materials from the investigation led by stevens , the former metropolitan police chief .

the executive committee of the european union has passed a resolution for the establishment of additional " buffer area " controls , including all areas of countries where the virus has been discovered for control , and forbidding all trade and transportation of poultries and bird species .
the bird flu breakouts continue to spread to more chicken farms following the eighth day since the deadly h 5n1 virus was discovered in nigeria , africa , and tracks demonstrate that it has crossed the northern border of nigeria and entered into niger .
egyptian officials are investigating the sudden mass death of chickens on a chicken farm in the south , and there is concern that the virus might continue to spread .
chicken meat markets in europe are falling to a great extent because of the impact of the virus event . the executive committee of the european union stressed that there is no reason to panic .
jipu ruinuo , an executive member of the committee responsible for sanitation and food safety , said that it is understandable for people to be concerned about the event but there is no need for overreaction .

china 's new electronic banking business management regulations will be implemented on march 1
xinhua news agency , beijing , february 6 ( reporter : han jie and xu bo ) reporters learned from china 's banking supervision committee on the 6th that the " electronic banking business management method " and the " guidance on electronic banks security assessment " issued by the banking supervision committee in recent days will be implemented on march 1 , 2006 .
a spokesman for the banking supervision committee said that based on the management method regulations , the approval method for foreign financial institutions is unchanged , i.e. if a branch of a foreign bank is approved to establish an online banking business and it needs to add a new service item for the online banking business , the major unit that reports to the branch in china 's territory should be solely responsible for the application and review .

as long as a security assessment setup follows related conditions and requirements , even if it is not acknowledged by the banking supervision committee for its qualification , financial institutions can still invite it to conduct an assessment for electronic banking security , but it should be controlled according to related regulations .
the " method for management of electronic banking businesses " has a total of nine chapters and 99 articles that are divided into nine parts , including the general principle , application and renewal , risk control , data exchange and transfer control , business contract control , cross - border business activities control , supervision control , liabilities , and additional regulations , etc.

as feng yang , the president of the overseas chinese association of freedom state province , said , the incident occurred at a bar in welkom , more that 130 kilometers northwest of bloemfontein .
while lin yixing , the bar owner , was cleaning items under the bar counter and preparing to end that day 's business ,

( newspaper digest ) part - time workers and high school graduates become major forces of hourly - paid work in shanghai
xinhua news agency , beijing , february 7. the " guidance on the current standard for hourly - paid wages in 2006 " issued by the labor and social support bureau of shanghai city on february 6 , lists 120 occupations , which is 11 more than the number issued last time . the " wage levels " of the original positions are either increased or reduced .
as an estimate made by related experts of the labor and social support bureau of shanghai city , currently the hourly - paid workers in shanghai are more than one million .
as china youth journal reported , part - time workers and high school graduates are the major part of the team of hourly - paid labors .
through a direct survey of more than 8,000 hourly - paid workers , more than half of them are part - time workers , and their ratio is 51.1 % .
those part - time workers are generally well educated , and mainly do more technical work . for instance , the ratio of part - time workers in the translation occupation is as high as 81.7 % , and that in the gym business is 61.6 % .
high income is one of the important reasons for many people to work at hourly - paid part - time jobs .
as was learned , monthly income for some positions can reach up to several tens of thousands of yuan , and it is difficult to find high - demand talents , such as simultaneous interpreters ; most hourly - paid workers ' monthly incomes can reach more than 2,000 yuan , such as part - time financial workers , wedding ceremony managers , etc.
one of the important reasons for the popularity of part - time workers for hourly wages is that those jobs suit individual interests and workers can learn more knowledge from those jobs .
for instance , mr. gu , who is a manager of the human resources unit at a company , uses several hours to handle business accounts for a foreign business agency every week .
mr. gu thinks that the greatest benefit of a part - time job is to continuously renew his own knowledge , and has opportunities to know another field , and of course , a monthly income of 2,000 yuan is also attractive to a certain extent .
since some positions for hourly - paid workers are low - skill ones , and their working patterns are flexible and free , they have gradually become popular among a lot of graduates who are looking for jobs . 14 % of hourly - paid workers are graduates from colleges and polytechnic schools in the last three years .
" i did not want to do an hourly - paid job in the beginning . but several months later , i feel it is better than 9 to 5 work . "
xiao huang 's job hunting is not that satisfying after he graduates from college . he eventually registers with a hotel and plays background music on a piano .
" i am quite satisfied with my current work , 100 yuan per hour , and the environment is also good . what i should do now is to find several more hourly - paid jobs . "
as has been learned , hourly - paid jobs have become an important path for those graduates who are looking for jobs to accumulate work experience , exercise their work skills , improve their communication skills , and enrich their social experience .
those graduates who work at hourly - paid jobs are mainly concentrated in positions that require more knowledge and skills , including translation positions , which require professional skills , and entertainment and performance positions , which require current popularity . these two kinds of positions are 22.1 % and 26.8 % , respectively , among those jobs that require more knowledge and skills .
some positions for hourly - paid workers do not require high skills , such as food promotion workers , merchandise handlers , and unemployed workers who are able to work through simple trainings .
data shows that those hourly - paid workers who used to be unemployed are 39 % of the total hourly - paid workers ; among them , workers who used to work in retail business are 68.4 % ; and those in restaurants and food businesses are 58.7 % . the hourly - paid jobs have become an important channel for unemployed workers to find their employment .

at the same time , the outline thinks that quantum adjustment and control studies has an obvious forward - looking nature , and might significantly impact the economic development of human society to an extent that can hardly be assessed in 20 to 30 years .
china should focus on studying the carrier , adjustment , and control rationales and methods of quantum communication , quantum calculation , the new quantum effect of constrained small quantum systems , quantum adjustment and control demonstration , and a new rationale and technical basis for quantum measurement , etc.
moreover , the outline points out that nano - technology has become the strategic selection for many countries to promote their core competitive capacity , and also is one of the fields for china to realize its surpassing development .
in the next 15 years , china will focus on studying in this field , including controllable equipment , self - assembly , and functionalization of nano - material , nano - electronics , nano - biology , nano - medicine , nano - size demonstration and metrology , and applications of nano - material and technology in fields such as energy , the environment , information , medicine , etc.
since china 's population is growing on a large scale , there are many birth defects , a serious shortage of organs for transplants , and the aging peak is coming , it urgently needs to make breakthroughs and technological innovations in the scientific theories on reproduction and development .
based on the outline , from 2006 to 2020 , china will focus on studying stem cell reproduction , differentiation , adjustment , and control ; production , maturity , and fertilization of reproductive cells ; the mechanism of declination and degenerative pathological changes in human reproductive functions ; and the safety and ethics of assisting reproduction of stem cells , and stem cell technology , etc.

china 's experts : " china 's military threat " touted by the united states is an unreasonable accusation .
xinhua news agency , beijing , february 9 ( reporters : li xuanliang , xiong zhengyan , lin liping ) . the quadrennial defense review formally submitted by the united states pentagon to the congress a few days ago first calls china " a newly arisen power that is most likely to challenge the united states militarily . "
experts think that this is an unreasonable accusation against china 's normal defense construction , and an interference in china 's internal affairs by exaggerating the " theory of china 's military threat . "
the quadrennial defense review is a new guidance document for national defense of the pentagon .
this 92 - page report uses three paragraphs to discuss the issue of china 's military strength and how the united states should cope with it . the report directly mentions the two terms of " china " and " chinese " 15 times , and says that , " as a major newly arisen power , china has the most military potential to compete with the united states ; if the united states does not take any countermeasures , china is very likely to develop destructive military technology , and break the us supremacy of traditional weapons . "
yao yunzhu , a research fellow at the world 's military study office of china 's military science academy , said that although senior us officials expressed similar views before , this is the first time for the united states to come up with the idea that " china is most likely to challenge the united states militarily as a newly arisen power " in a defense strategy report .
" this report first regards russia , india , and china as newly arisen strategic rivals , and especially , pays more attention to the so - called ' theory of china 's military threat , ' "
said major general peng guangqian , a research fellow at china 's military science academy .
the noticeable thing is that on the same day when the quadrennial defense review was submitted , us president bush also presented his administrative budget for the 2007 fiscal year to the congress , and the defense budget is as high as 439.3 billion dollars in the budget .
" if the budget for military activities in iraq and afghanistan is added , the defense budget for the us in the 2007 fiscal year will break the historical record of 500 billion dollars , " said peng guangqian . " and this almost amounts to the sum of military expenses of all the countries in the world . "
peng guangqian thinks that the us method of making " theories of threats from other countries " reflects its consistent style of " making enemies , " and its real goal is to strive for more defense funds and fish for more profits for the us 's gigantic defense industry groups .
experts said that compared with the large military expenses of the us , china 's military expenditure is quite limited .
deng hongzhou , a military expert who has participated in the writing of the china defense white paper many times , said that since the 90s of the 20th century , with the economic development , china 's defense funding has been increased to some extent , but it tends to fall in its ratio to the state 's financial expenditure in the same periods .
official data shows that comparing 2004 with 1979 , the ratio of china 's defense expenditure in the state 's financial expenditure was decreased nearly 10 percentage points .
china 's defense funding in 2005 was rmb 244.656 billion yuan , which only amounts to 1/14 of that of the us ; military expense per capita is only equal to 1/60 of that of the us ; and military expense per serviceman is about only 1/30 of that of the us armed forces .
" the us land area is about as big as china 's , but the gap in military expenditures between ( the two countries ) is so huge that there is no need to point out whose military strength indeed exceeds the needs of a justifiable defense , "
said peng guangqian .
teng jianqun , director of the study office at china 's armament control and disarmament association , said that the us side should objectively comment on china 's military construction , and china 's peaceful development does not mean that china and the united states will become military rivals in the future .
china 's defense white paper 2004 says that china firmly follows the path of peaceful development and implements a defensive policy of national defense .
china never threatened or threatens or will threaten any countries .
china has never established any military bases in any other countries so far , nor sent any troops to other countries ; but the united states has established more than a hundred overseas military bases , and deployed more than 100,000 troops in the asian region alone .
zhu feng , a professor at the international relations college of beijing university , said that both china and the united states should strengthen communications and exchanges through established channels between the two countries to promote understanding and mutual trust , thoroughly advance the constructive collaboration relation between china and the united states in the new century , and jointly develop and maintain peace and development in the world .

( international observation ) hamas seeks breakthrough in organization of its cabinet
xinhua news agency , ramallah , february 9 ( international observation ) . hamas seeks breakthrough in organization of its cabinet
xinhua news agency reporters : wang hao and huang min
how the palestinian islamic resistance movement ( hamas ) draws the blueprint for its first government after it won the legislative committee election has become the focus that the international community is currently paying attention to .
what kind of a new policy hamas is going to carry out will directly affect the next appropriate policy direction of every party concerned in the peace process .
at the same time , the boycott attitude of the united states and israel has made the prospect of the hamas government more uncertain .
currently , all the parties in palestine are consulting each other tensely , and actively looking for breakthroughs in difficulties and sensitive aspects in future development of the cabinet organization .
( subtitle ) who will be selected to take the position of prime minister ?
some outsiders worry that a " hamas prime minister " might have disagreements with abbas , the current supreme leader , after hamas wins the right to organize its cabinet .
moreover , a hamas leader , mushir , who is visiting egypt , stressed that a new palestinian government established by hamas leadership will not acknowledge israel . this strong signal has also raised more international concerns .
the united states and israel have clearly stated that they do not accept a hamas government that controls real power , and threatened to stop their economic aid to palestine and suspend transferring tax income to the palestinian side .
however , these things do not hinder hamas from adjusting its strategy flexibly . selection of an independent candidate is one compromise .
as it has been reported , to win maximum acknowledgement internationally , the hamas leaders from home and abroad who gathered in egypt a few days ago , had decided to select jamal al-khudairi , an independent person who is the chair of the board of gaza islamic university , to be the new prime minister .
this move has not been responded to by related parties .
hussein , a palestinian analyst , said that no matter who is selected as the prime minister , the most important thing is to soften the " strong " attitude of hamas as much as possible on the selection of the candidate for prime minister , and only in this way can it assure the success of the cabinet organization .
( subtitle ) how to allocate power
the biggest challenge for hamas in organizing its cabinet is that it lacks sufficient administrative experience from the perspective of its internal capabilities .
an article published by the palestinian daily journal analyzed that although hamas has won support from people through social welfare items , it lacks administrative experience , and a better strategy is to collaborate with the palestinian national liberation movement ( fatah ) , which has administrative experience .
hamas suggested to establish a " political partnership " with fatah to organize a national coalition government after the election , but fatah has not actively responded to it so far .
inside fatah , there are now different opinions on whether it should join the cabinet ; some think it should join the new government to play a role in it ; some refuse the invitation from hamas and would rather become an " active opposition " in the legislative committee .
a well - informed source pointed out that fatah is gradually leaning toward joining the new government after abbas 's persuasion .
even so , fatah will bargain with hamas on the allocation of cabinet positions .
moreover , another path is to establish a cabinet that is out of the framework of the legislative committee and free of partisan leanings .
as it has been reported , hamas has also designed a pure technocratic government , but the concrete name list of the government is unknown .
because of the attitude of the united states and israel , a technocratic government is a cabinet organization method that can reduce external pressure .
according to regulations of the palestinian " essential law , " nomination of the prime minister and the cabinet organization work will be completed within 3 to 5 weeks after a new legislative committee assumes office on the 16th of this month .
( subtitle ) where does the armed wing go ?
another difficult issue for organization of a new government is the weapons in the hands of hamas .
the attitude of the united states and israel is very strong , and they firmly request that hamas give up violence , and refuse its joining the government with its weapons .
hamas leader mushir stressed on the 9th that the armed resistance is the " strategic choice " of the organization .
the armed wing issue includes two aspects of weapons ' legitimacy and ownership and control of armed wings .
hamas is acknowledged internationally because it becomes the first big party elected in the legislative committee through a democratic and free method , and the legitimatized path for its armed wing , the qassam brigades , is to integrate it into a security organization for the government .
hamas used to suggest integrating military wings of all factions into a " people 's army " under the palestinian national authority , but it has not received broad responses , and has even been criticized by the palestinian islamic organization ( jihad ) .
palestine currently has more than 60,000 personnel in security organizations , and most of them come from the fatah camp .
moreover , fatah has some armed wings and keeps loose organizational relations with them , such as the " al-aqsa martyr brigades " and " fatah hawks , " etc.
hamas , responsible for the cabinet organization , must make an agreement with abbas on how to control those self - governed armed wings and reasonably allocate security and administrative power .
as local media reported , abbas tends to control security and intelligence troops ; organizations such as the police and civilian defense can be administrated by the internal affairs ministry of a new government .
however , all parties concerned are still consulting each other on this sensitive issue , and have not produced any results .

since it is the first time for china to issue the polar - region exploration report , china 's polar - region exploration report 2005 also traces back and summarizes china 's polar - region exploration efforts , which started in the 80s of the 20th century .
according to the report , china formally joined the antarctic treaty in 1983 , and became a member country of the antarctic treaty , and a consulting member country of the antarctic treaty , and a member country of those most influential international organizations of south pole affairs , respectively , including the scientific committee on antarctic research , and the antarctic bureau president council .
in 1997 , china became a member of the arctic science committee , and won its speaking right and decision - making right in international polar - region affairs .
the report points out that in more than 20 years , china 's polar - region explorations have been developed from nothing to having something , and advanced continuously into an initial size . a scientific and exploration system for the south and north poles , including " three stations and one ship , " has been formed , i.e. the antarctic great wall station established in february 1985 ; zhongshan antarctic station established in february 1989 ; the arctic huanghe station established in july 2004 , and the " snow dragon " polar - region exploration ship that has assumed exploration tasks in the antarctic and arctic since 1994 .
based on the statistics in the report , china has organized 22 scientific explorations , 2 scientific explorations in the arctic by using the " snow dragon " ship as a carrier platform in the arctic , and 2 batches of explorations around the arctic huanghe station by the end of 2005 . there have been more than 3,000 person times of team members nationwide so far who have been in the antarctic or arctic to do field explorations .
" currently , we are doing investigation work for the feasibility of building the third exploration station in the antarctic , that is also china 's first inland exploration station in the antarctic , "
said sun zhihui .
" through more than 20 years ' efforts , china 's polar - region exploration cause has played a role in the world 's polar - region explorations . but compared with those major countries of polar - region explorations , there is still a bigger gap ( between china and them ) , and we must catch up with them , "
he said .
sun zhihui disclosed that china will publish a polar - region exploration report every year in the future .

japanese researchers have developed a new type of highly efficient manmade kidney
xinhua news agency , tokyo , february 13 ( reporter : qian zheng ) . researchers at japan 's tokai university have developed a type of manmade biological kidney that can not only function the same as a human kidney for catabolism , but can also keep useful substances in the body . since it is small in size and easy to transplant , it is hopeful that it will bring good news to patients who have kidney disease with the further development of the study .
as japan economic and industrial news reported a few days ago , the newly developed manmade biological kidney is composed of two parts . one is the " manmade nephron , " which filters metabolites and water in the blood ; the other is the " manmade urinary tubules , " which extract useful substances such as water and amino acids from the original urine and sends them back into the blood .
both the " manmade nephron " and " manmade urinary tubules " are made of hollow threads , and the internal walls of the " manmade urinary tubules " are paved with epithelial cells of urinary tubules that have the function of catabolism .
this type of epithelial cells can treat diseases caused by repeated hemodialysis and decompose the causative substance of " dialysis - related denatured starch " into an amino acid , and send it back into the blood . they can also send those substances necessary for the human body such as glucose , vitamins , and minerals back into the blood again .
previous manmade kidneys depended on the osmosis pressure gap of dialysis to filter metabolites , which cannot totally get rid of them , and does not have the function of making amino acids and other substances return into the blood .
researchers used goats to do the manmade kidney transplant experiment , and the inner walls of hollow threads of the manmade kidney are lined with epithelial cells from a hog .
two weeks later , researchers confirmed that the manmade kidney is able to function .
they are currently developing the manmade biological kidney using human kidney cells , and are about to do clinical studies after verification of its safety .
china 's secure power production still faces serious challenges
xinhua news agency , beijing , february 13 ( reporter : an pei ) . a leader of the state power supervision and control committee said on the 13th that although the secure power production generally maintained a stable status in 2005 , secure power production still faces serious challenges .
vice chairman of the state power supervision and control committee shi yubo said at the fifth ( expanded ) session of the national secure power production committee that in 2005 china 's secure power production was stable in general , and accomplished the task smoothly for power peak usage in the summertime , realized a secure power supply , actively coped with the strikes of natural disasters , and basically assured the secure and stable operation of power systems , greatly reduced equipment accidents in secure power production and general power network accidents , compared with those of last year , and the health level of power equipment was increased .
but he pointed out that with changes in power supply and demand situations , and that many of the newly established generating sets are put into operation one after another , secure power production will face new challenges .
these challenges include : regional , seasonal , and time interval power shortages still exist ; power supply and demand situations in some regions are still tense ; since a good mechanism for the price of power and coal has not been formed , supply of power and coal is still quite problematic ; at the same time , the falling power and coal quality problem has not been effectively controlled , and will seriously affect stable operations of generating sets ; some power network structures are fragile and their equipment is obsolete , which brings risks to systems ' safety ; frequent occurrences of accidents in power infrastructure construction have not completely changed , and the situation is still serious .
shi yubo said that with the further development of power system reform , many deep - rooted contradictions will be continuously exposed , and how to maintain stability of employee teams and assure a normal production order will be a new issue to face .
for the secure power production work in 2006 , shi yubo said that the basic control secure power production work should be further consolidated ; an emergency control mechanism for power safety should be established and quickly perfected to strengthen responsive capabilities for emergencies ; coordination between power factories and networks should be strengthened ; security of big dams should be assured ; safety control of power facility constructions should be strengthened to reduce occurrences of personnel injury and death accidents ; information delivery work should be continuously strengthened to assure the accurate , timely , and smooth flow of power safety information .
it has been learned that based on a new power safety control situation , this year the power supervision and control committee will revise and perfect the issued temporary regulations on accident investigation of power production , and at the same time will continuously issue and execute additional documents about the safety of the hydraulic power station dam and safety protection of the secondary power system this year .
in 2005 , the whole of chinese society used a total power of 2468.9 billion kwh , and increased 13.45 % compared with that of last year .
facing the situation in which power supply and demand is still tense , and the unfavorable status of transportation problems with coal , power , and oil , power enterprises have taken effective measures and strengthened equipment control , and prevented the occurrence of large equipment accidents in national power production in all of last year .
there were 74 power network accidents , which were reduced by 127 compared with those of last year ; equipment accidents were 427 , which were reduced by 132 compared with those of last year .
minister of south africa , in china , says there are no " organized " criminal activities against chinese citizens in south africa
xinhua news agency , beijing , february 13 ( reporters : wang jiangang and hao yalin ) . charge d'affaires ad interim and minister of the south african embassy in china vusi bruce koloane said in an interview with xinhua news agency reporters on the 13th that there are no " organized " criminal activities against chinese citizens in south africa .
he said at the same time that the south african government will make every effort to " strike against all forms of criminal activities . "
vusi bruce koloane stated that the south african government hopes to " reduce the crime rate to zero , " and wants the life and asset securities of every foreigner who works in south africa to be fully protected by local laws and citizens .
since 2006 , 4 chinese citizens have been killed , one after another , in south africa , and the chinese world has broadly paid attention to it .
china 's foreign ministry has contacted the south african side about the matter , and warned chinese citizens who are traveling in south africa to increase their awareness of their security and protection , and to strengthen unity and caring for each other among overseas chinese , and to collaborate with the police to jointly strike against criminal activities .
" we express our sincerest sympathy and condolences to family members of those victims . "
vusi bruce koloane said , " we are sorry for this , and we also want the chinese people to believe that the south african government is carefully investigating every case related to the chinese . "
as the embassy of south africa presented , the south african police have successfully broken a case in which chen jianqing , a woman came from fujian , china , was killed on february 5 in south africa , and have arrested a suspect .
the police are searching for another suspect at present .
as the south african embassy in china disclosed , the suspect , who is charged with the gun death of a hong kong businessman in january of this year , has been arrested by the south african police , and the belongings of the victim have been recovered .
when talking about the possible impacts of the killings of chinese citizens , vusi bruce koloane thinks that those incidents will " indeed " impact trade , tourism , and exchanges in other fields between the two countries , and produce negative outcomes . but in the long run , those impacts " should not be big . "
as tourist attache of the south african embassy nian beixi presented , the embassy issued more than 2,000 visas for chinese to go to south africa in the first 15 days of this year .
based on the statistical data of the chinese government , south africa had maintained its number one status as china 's biggest trade partner in africa in 2005 .
the bilateral trade amount reached 7.27 billion usd , and increased 23 % compared with that of last year .
however , people in the tourist industry think that the continuous occurrences of killing chinese citizens in 2004 have apparently affected the number of tourists who visited south africa .
based on the statistics of the sightseeing bureau of south africa , there were 20,331 chinese tourists who visited south africa in the first half of 2005 , which were reduced 14.9 % compared with that of last year .
there are about 200,000 chinese who live in south africa at present , and are scattered everywhere in the towns and villages of south africa .
analysts here think that since there are big gaps between the rich and poor in south african society , and a high unemployment rate , guns are spread everywhere , and no death penalty , the crime rate is still high there .
because many chinese do not speak english , and they carry cash with them and put cash in their homes , they become easy targets for criminals to attack them for their assets .

inside the memorial hall , the reporter saw the dark , horizontal banner with the calligraphy " express profound condolences over academician wang xuan " hanging on the wall of the memorial of the hundred - year anniversary of peking university .
below the banner , there was a big picture of wang xuan that was more than ten square meters in size . wang was wearing a pair of glasses , smiling with a scholarly air .
several cypress trees and several dozen wreaths were put along both sides of the picture .
an elegiac couplet on a wreath was written like this : " it began in the qin dynasty , prospered in the tang dynasty , glorified china , and skillfully laid a foundation ; the contemporary bi sheng said farewell to the lead age , greeted the electronic one , and drew a blueprint . "
low - volume funeral music was mingled in the mourning hall , in a solemn and respectful atmosphere .

some of them held fresh flowers in their hands ; some carried flower baskets ; everybody , wearing small white flowers on their chests , slowly walked to the picture of academician wang xuan , and bowed to express their condolences .
many could not help but weep warm tears .
zhang wenbin , who was the director of the state 's cultural relic bureau and an old alumnus of peking university , told the reporter that , more than ten years ago , when he worked in henan province , he invited professor wang xuan to give a report on scientific and technological innovation for cadres of the provincial party committee .
" the conduct and academic studies of academician wang xuan are the model for us to learn . he made important contributions for the country and society , and people will never forget him . "

" he insisted on not applying for the title of academician at the beginning ; then he gave up and filled out an application only after mr. zhou peiyuan went to get him moving him many times . "
another thing that moved mr. jin was wang xuan 's attitude toward the training of young people , " he himself stressed many times that what should be found and relied on are not what achievements i have achieved , not myself , but the training of young people . "
mr. jin said that when wang xuan was around more than 50 years old , he started to pay attention to cultivating young people . he had stressed that we should pave a path , be willing to become a human ladder , and make way for young people .
" it is not easy at all for a very accomplished scientist to do this . "

china to implement protection regulation on dissemination rights for information networks
xinhua news agency , beijing , february 15 ( reporters : zhou wei and li fei ) . many networks and websites currently rely on republishing a lot of news and reports from newspapers and magazines to increase their click rates , but many of them are neither authorized , nor pay related fees . to cope with this , director of the copyright department of the state copyright bureau wang ziqiang said in a press conference , held by the news office of the state council on the 15th , that the state council will explain about the implementation of the protection regulation on dissemination rights for information networks , on the issue of paying for republishing works on the internet .
wang ziqiang said that according to existing laws and regulations , regarding those works published in newspapers , as long as their authors did not state that " they cannot be used , " newspapers can use those works without their authors ' permission , but at the same time should pay them , and the state copyright bureau has made the payment standard specifically for newspaper reprint practices according to the law .
however , according to regulations in existing laws , newspapers have the right to such legal permissions , but the internet currently does not have rights for such legal permissions .
according to related interpretations made by the people 's supreme court , the legal permission for newspaper reprints is applied to the internet , i.e. to any small or short articles published in newspapers or on the internet , whose authors did not state that " they cannot be used , " the internet can use them without permission , but at the same time needs to pay their authors .
but because the legal interpretation does not determine the payment standard , the internet has not made payments when it used those works in practice .
" regarding whether the internet use of published small or short works applies to the legal permission , it still needs to be determined according to the laws . "
wang ziqiang said : " whether it will be included in a category of law depends on the confirmation of the implementation of the protection regulation on dissemination rights for information networks this year . "
( international ) russian military says georgian parliament 's resolution will not affect russia 's peacekeeping activities
xinhua news agency , moscow , february 15 ( reporter : song shiyi ) . xie duofu , a news officer for the russian defense ministry , told the media on the 15th that the resolution made by the georgian parliament on russia 's peacekeeping troops will not affect the russian military 's peacekeeping activities in the short term , and russian troops will continue to fulfill their peacekeeping mission in the conflict area of south ossetia .
the chair of the russian independent state affairs committee of the state duma ( lower house of the parliament ) , kokoshin , made a speech and indicated regarding the resolution made by the georgian parliament on russia 's peacekeeping troops , on the same day the resolution was published , that the resolution will harm the stability of the situation in that area and negatively impact the relations between russia and georgia .
he stressed that the resolution made by the georgian parliament is a further bad step toward damaging the relations between russia and georgia .
he thinks that the georgian accusation against the russian side is absurd .
the georgian parliament passed the resolution on that day , and requested russia 's peacekeeping troops to stop their peacekeeping activities in south ossetia , but did not set a concrete deadline for russia 's peacekeeping troops to withdraw .
the georgian parliament accuses russia 's peacekeeping personnel of a failure to fulfill their designated obligation , and regards the actions taken by russia in the conflict area as " trying to annex georgian territory . "
the georgian parliament requests the georgian government to take an active action and consider inviting international peacekeeping troops - to be stationed in the conflict area of south ossetia - to replace the peacekeeping activities currently undertaken by russia in that area .
the georgian parliament also requests the government to revise a related agreement that determined the stationing of russia 's peacekeeping personnel in the conflict area .
south ossetia is an autonomous georgian state , and borders with russia 's republic of north ossetia .
it announced its own independence after the soviet union collapsed , and has been confronting georgia 's central government for a long time .
russia currently has a peacekeeping battalion of 500 soldiers stationed in that area .
the troops stationed there are based on the agreement signed by four parties - including russia , georgia , north ossetia , and south ossetia - in 1992 .

as was investigated , at around 16:30 on the day the accident occurred , there was a sudden power failure at the central hospital of liaoyuan city . based on the hospital 's electrical circuit design , if there is a power failure , the circuit breaker in the transformer box should automatically switch to a backup socket to maintain normal power supply for the hospital . but at that time the circuit breaker did not automatically switch to the socket . zhang diankun , the head of the technician team , forced the power supply without investigating and clarifying the cause of the power failure , and caused the fire disaster .
those smoky underground cables , which should be laid out on a flat surface in very good order , were tangled together without any order , and fire prevention layers should be set up .
thus , three individuals including zhao yongchun , the 57 - year - old head of the electrical equipment installation team of the textile company of liaoyuan city , sun fenglin , a retired cadre ( senior engineer ) from the liaoyuan power affairs bureau , and jin taicheng , a reemployed retiree worker at the central hospital of liaoyuan city , will be prosecuted as suspects in the liability for the big accident .

( winter olympic games : stimulant ) news analysis : pyleva incident might be settled by leaving it unsettled
xinhua news agency , turin , february 17. news analysis : pyleva incident might be settled by leaving it unsettled
xinhua news agency reporters : gao peng , ding ying
although italy reiterated that any athletes who are discovered using stimulants may face the " disaster of being jailed , " many cases currently demonstrate that it is unlikely to happen to russian women 's biathlon athlete olga pyleva , who is at the center of the first scandal over stimulant use at the winter olympic games .
the first stimulant use scandal at the turin winter olympic games was exposed on the 16th , and olga pyleva was discovered to have used the illegal and banned drug carphedon .
the next day , the international olympic committee announced that pyleva had been thrown out of the winter olympic games , and the silver medal she won for the 15 km women 's biathlon had been withdrawn .
the same day , the international winter biathlon alliance determined to forbid pyleva to participate in the sport for two years .
the international olympic committee has been implementing the regulation that once athletes are discovered using stimulants , they will lose their qualification to participate in the games , and the scores they achieved will be withdrawn , but they are not subject to legal punishment .
however , according to italian law , the carrying and use of stimulants by any athlete are criminal activities . a law enforcement organization has the right to directly arrest and investigate any athlete who uses stimulants . any violators of the law are subject to jail for 3 months to 3 years .
the international olympic committee had been " bargaining " with the italian government for one year , and eventually reached an agreement last december . both sides agreed that during the period of the winter olympic games , any athletes who use stimulants would be handled according to italian laws .
through the unremitting efforts made by the international olympic committee , the italian side made a compromise four days before the opening ceremonies of the winter olympic games , and promised that the police would not enter the olympic village to search athlete residences during the olympic games . but any athletes whose drug tests show positive will be investigated by italian prosecution organizations .
some reports said that pescante , an official of the italian government responsible for supervision of the turin winter olympic games , has transferred pyleva 's stimulant case to a turin prosecution organization .
however , the international olympic committee and pescante himself have not confirmed this so far .
andrey dmytriev , a doctor for the russian biathlon team , disclosed at noontime on the 17th that pyleva had left turin and returned home .
shi kangcheng , a chinese sports official who had been in a position at the world anti - stimulant organization for many years , thinks that once pyleva returns home , this case might eventually " be settled by leaving it unsettled . "
shi kangcheng said that the international olympic committee and the italian government have not " completely addressed " the anti - stimulant issue at the winter olympic games , and it is hard to say what the outcome would be even if italian prosecution organizations really did get involved in the case .
based on past penalty cases in which italy sentenced or punished its own athletes who used stimulants , the most serious penalty was merely a " two - year probation . "
thus , senior reporter piali from the italian ansa said that the possibility of pyleva being jailed is " very small , " and at most , she might be fined .
piali also said that although an italian court could sentence her by default , it is impossible for the italian police to catch pyleva abroad and bring her back to serve the sentence .
if pyleva refuses to accept the sentence , the italian side can do nothing about it .
