re@@ member@@ ing the very american ideal of labour rights as human rights
cong@@ res@@ sional ke@@ ith el@@ lis@@ on and john le@@ w@@ is have submitted a legislative proposal to establish the organisation of trade unions as a civil law .
&quot; just as trade unions die , so do the mid@@ d@@ le-@@ class jobs , &quot; el@@ lis@@ on said , a min@@ n@@ es@@ ot@@ a democr@@ at and depu@@ ty chairman of the congress of cau@@ c@@ us .
i am therefore proud to present the staff authorisation act together with the civil rights si@@ k@@ one john le@@ w@@ is .
this gr@@ oun@@ d-@@ breaking law gives workers the same legal opportunities in the case of discrimination on the grounds of the organisation of trade unions as in other forms of discrimination - and thus stops anti-@@ trade uni@@ on@@ ist forces .
the addition of the national labour law act to create a possibility for discrimin@@ ated workers to organise trade union representation to compla@@ in to a civil court for justice - and to obtain compensation or criminal penalties needed - is to be given .
but it is certainly not a radical initiative - at least not by american standards .
indeed , the best way to understand what el@@ lis@@ on , le@@ w@@ is , and other spon@@ sors propose to your bill is to link it back to a very american idea .
despite the set@@ backs that unions have suffered in recent years - in wis@@ con@@ s@@ in , mic@@ hi@@ gan , and other countries across the country - americans once encouraged countries around the world to up@@ hold labor rights .
there was a time when millions of americans re@@ mem@@ bered when this country called democracy , freedom of speech , freedom of the press and the right of association in one bre@@ ath .
when the united states occupied japan after world war ii , general dou@@ gl@@ as mac ar@@ th@@ ur and his staff encouraged the country to adopt a constitution that was designed to ensure that milit@@ ari@@ zed to@@ cr@@ acy would replace to@@ cr@@ acy .
knowing full that the workers and their unions were playing a role in creating a new japan , they used a language that explicitly acknowledged that &quot; the rights of workers to be united and to negotiate and act together are guaranteed . &quot;
when the united states occupied germany after world war ii , general d@@ wi@@ ght david e@@ is@@ en@@ ho@@ wer and his staff ur@@ ged the german@@ s to write a constitution that would ensure that strong fas@@ c@@ ism replaced ad@@ ol@@ f hit@@ ler .
recogn@@ ising the fact that the workers should organize , and speak out in the new nation , the german@@ s included a clause that explicitly stated : &quot; the right to establish trade associations , to establish economic conditions , to each and every employee .
agreements that restrict or aim to restrict this right are n@@ ul@@ l and vo@@ id ; measures aimed at it are illegal .
when the former first lady ele@@ an@@ or roo@@ se@@ vel@@ t presid@@ ed over the international human rights commission , which drafted the universal declaration of human rights , &quot; which was incorporated into it in 194@@ 8 by the united nations as a global agreement .
for generations , americans have accepted the basic pre@@ mise that labor rights are human rights .
when this country told other countries how to form civil and democratic societies , americans said that the right to create a trade union - and that this trade union should then be allowed to participate in collective bar@@ gaining as an equal partner - was allowed .
after these rights were under attack in america , it is indeed very wise to re@@ consider the american ideal that the working population must have the right to un@@ ite and to make itself heard in a free and open society .
fif@@ ty years ago , as pa@@ st@@ or martin lu@@ ther king j@@ r. said :
history is a great teacher .
now everyone knows that the workers ’ movement did not limit the nation ’ s strength , but increased it .
by raising the standard of living of millions of people , work mir@@ ac@@ ul@@ ously created a market for industry and raised the entire nation to un@@ imag@@ in@@ able levels of production .
those who attack the work forget these simple tru@@ ths , but history keeps them .
history re@@ members itself , and we should do so .
formal recognition of labour rights as human rights - and the extension of the protection of civil rights as a protection against discrimination in the creation of employee representatives - is long over@@ due .
ke@@ ith el@@ lis@@ on and john le@@ w@@ is re@@ new the ide@@ als that america has built up in the past and delivered the promise of democracy .
judge tempor@@ arily stops the law that could force all abor@@ tion clin@@ ics in lou@@ i@@ si@@ ana to close .
a us federal judge suspended the implementation of a law in lou@@ i@@ si@@ ana on sunday , which lawyers say that it would probably have closed all five abor@@ tion hospit@@ als in the state .
this measure , which was imposed by bo@@ b@@ by j@@ in@@ dal , govern@@ or of lou@@ i@@ si@@ ana , in june to enter into law and enter into force on 1 september , would force doctors who carry out abor@@ tions within a hospital to take .
however , the judge &apos;s decision means that doctors can continue to conduct abor@@ tions legally for the time being while they are requ@@ est@@ ing such a right .
&quot; the pla@@ in@@ ti@@ ffs can continue to work in accordance with the law while trying to obtain these rights , &quot; wrote federal judge john de@@ gra@@ vel@@ les in his judgment .
within a month , a hearing will be set up for the judge to bring about a more lasting decision on the law .
pro-@@ abor@@ tion welcomed the decision to take the youn@@ g@@ est in a series of jud@@ gments against similar measures , saying that doctors gave so much time to gain hospital admission rights .
&quot; today &apos;s decision means that women in lou@@ i@@ si@@ ana have es@@ cap@@ ed a w@@ ic@@ ked law that wants to take their health and rights away from them , &quot; said n@@ ancy nor@@ th@@ up , president and head of the center for re@@ productive rights .
it was not immediately clear whether the judgment also covered the doctors from the two clin@@ ics who had not joined the compla@@ int and had also applied for permission to ap@@ point them .
lou@@ i@@ si@@ ana is one of 11 states that have en@@ acted similar laws , with courts recently declar@@ ing such measures in al@@ ab@@ ama and missi@@ ssi@@ pp@@ i un@@ constitutional .
key legal positions in tex@@ as , which would have forced most of the remaining clin@@ ics to close , were stopped by a federal judge on friday .
pro-@@ abor@@ tion ad@@ voca@@ tes and the american college of o@@ stre@@ tr@@ ici@@ ans and gy@@ nec@@ o@@ logi@@ sts , as well as the american medical association , agree that the right of doctors to receive medical advice requires unnecessary restrictions .
oppon@@ ents of abor@@ tion oppose the fact that the measures are designed to protect women &apos;s health , although some have also welcomed the effects of closing hospit@@ als .
only a doctor carrying out abor@@ tion in lou@@ i@@ si@@ ana has patients &apos; rights to enter the hospital , informed the centre for reproduction rights .
if all other doctors in the state are forced to stop carrying out abor@@ tions , this doctor would not carry out the operation , the group said , for fear of his safety .
in argu@@ ing against the ver@@ dic@@ t , representatives of the lou@@ i@@ si@@ ana state said that they would not pun@@ ish doctors for carrying out abor@@ tions , while their applications for patients &apos; in@@ fil@@ tr@@ ation rights would still be pending .
dela@@ yed diagno@@ sis and lack of access to the best treatment methods lead to higher death rates from o@@ vari@@ an cancer in rural areas .
angel@@ ina jo@@ lie and her brother james have put a video hom@@ age online for their mother who died of eg@@ g cancer in 2007 .
women in australia ’ s rural areas face a greater risk of dying of o@@ vari@@ an cancer than women in cities .
researchers analy@@ sed the medical data of more than 1@@ 100 austr@@ ali@@ ans , who found that in 2005 o@@ vari@@ an cancer was detec@@ ted , and found that only 25 % were still alive five years after diagno@@ sis .
research director sus@@ an j@@ ord@@ an of the q@@ im@@ r ber@@ g@@ ho@@ fer medical research institute said that for those living in rural and remote regions of the state , the risk of mort@@ ality was 20 % higher during the study .
small study : new drugs could slow l@@ ung and o@@ vari@@ an cancer
researchers investig@@ ated the medical care of women for seven years .
dr j@@ ord@@ an said that the age of a woman in diagno@@ sis , the type of o@@ vari@@ an cancer , existing pre-@@ diseases and social and economic status also imp@@ acted survival chan@@ ces .
for older women and those whose cancer was already more advanced at diagno@@ sis , the survival rate was the lowest .
for those who lived in rural and remote regions of the state , the risk of mort@@ ality was 20 % higher than for those in urban areas .
although the study failed to study why women living outside the city were more likely to die of o@@ vari@@ an cancer , j@@ ord@@ an susp@@ ects that diagno@@ sis was dela@@ yed and that there was no access to the best treatment centres .
&quot; this disease is best treated by gy@@ na@@ ecological on@@ co@@ logi@@ sts , and these are mostly found in larger cities , &quot; she said .
despite the improvement of tele@@ medicine services to counter di@@ stances , it proposed , as a possible re@@ me@@ dy , an increase in the service of doctors flo@@ wn to allow specialists to provide women with care loc@@ ally outside their own region .
dr j@@ ord@@ an said that , regardless of geographical status , the study showed a poor long-term survival rate among women in the o@@ vari@@ an cancer , and under@@ lined the need for better treatment and prevention strategies .
the study funded by rio t@@ into ride to con@@ qu@@ er can@@ cer is published today in the medical journal of australia .
in march 2013 , el@@ ish@@ a ne@@ a@@ ve , a young mother of 33 years from the gold coast , learned that she had an aggres@@ sive form of o@@ vari@@ an cancer .
garden centres regret falling house numbers
the decline , together with a greater decre@@ ase in the number of home@@ owners under 35 , could result in garden centres losing tens of thousands of p@@ ounds per year when today &apos;s young consumers reach a study by the h@@ ta , as reported in the financial .
the report states that ten@@ ants spend an average of 55 % of the amount that people spend on their garden with their own homes .
the increase in people living in highly ur@@ ban@@ ized areas without gardens , the popular method of as@@ ph@@ al@@ ting pre@@ gardens for parking , and the dec@@ lining garden size are trans@@ posed into £ 5 per year , as well as £ 5 per year .
in the greater london area , where the share of home@@ owners has fallen from 61 % to 43 % over a period of six years , the lowest expenditure on garden products per household is reported .
the h@@ ta and the royal hor@@ tic@@ ul@@ tural society point out that housing for rent or small gardens does not mean that people cannot plant .
gu@@ y bar@@ ter , chief garden advis@@ er for the rh@@ s said : &apos; contain@@ er gar@@ den@@ ers are very popular with ten@@ ants , for example , because they can take their plants with them when moving &apos; .
the h@@ ta report identified the period 1997 to 2005 as the &quot; golden age &quot; of garden retail , owing to rising home@@ owners and economic prosperity from the late 198@@ 0s to the mid-@@ 199@@ 0s .
he also forec@@ ast an improved market situation this year , because of the weather conditions in march and april last year .
the protest movement in pakistan , led by opposition politici@@ an im@@ ran kh@@ an and the religious ta@@ h@@ ir@@ u@@ l q@@ ad@@ ri , continues .
in the capital islam@@ ab@@ ad , about 1000 demonstr@@ ators have stor@@ med the state television channel p@@ tv .
information minister per@@ v@@ ai@@ z r@@ as@@ hi@@ d said that soldiers could have pus@@ hed the prote@@ sters out of p@@ tv buildings again .
the trans@@ mit@@ ter set up its operation for about 40 minutes , but is now sending back .
at the same time , around 3@@ 000 demonstr@@ ators tried to get to the residence of prime minister na@@ wa@@ z shar@@ if .
about a kil@@ ome@@ tre away they supplied themselves with po@@ les and stones equipped cl@@ ash@@ es with security forces .
the police used te@@ ar@@ gas .
the demonstr@@ ators demanded shar@@ if &apos;s re@@ sign@@ ation , but he ref@@ uses .
the country &apos;s army , meanwhile , is calling for a political solution to the conflict , &apos; waste no time and use without violence &apos; .
after a meeting at the headquarters on sunday evening , the military announced that it would &apos; maintain its role of an obligation to ensure the security of the state &apos; .
the military plays an important role in pakistan and has already been more frequent cou@@ ps .

turkey orders us diplom@@ ats for sp@@ ying
the turkish foreign ministry has ordered the country ’ s most senior us diplom@@ ats to report on american and british es@@ pi@@ on@@ age in turkey .
vice-president b@@ ü@@ l@@ ent said that the us emb@@ ass@@ y &apos;s business@@ man and turkish officials had discussed the report on monday .
the german magazine der spi@@ e@@ gel and the online magazine the inter@@ cep@@ t reported that the former us analy@@ st of the national security agency , ed@@ ward snow@@ den , was a major us activity for turkey .
according to turkish news agencies , turkish president rec@@ ep ta@@ y@@ y@@ ip er@@ do@@ gan played down the importance of the report and said that all the major countries were sp@@ ying each other out .
a previous report , which also targeted germany ’ s most important intelligence service , caused much more an@@ gr@@ y reaction from the turkish government .

said the district chairman of the german lo@@ com@@ otive association ( g@@ d@@ l ) , s@@ ven sch@@ mit@@ t , in d@@ üs@@ sel@@ dorf .
we expect significant fail@@ ures .
there are no regional priorities .
the main thr@@ ust of the warning strike is freight transport .
the german railway in n@@ r@@ w announced that it would do everything possible to minim@@ ise the impact .
however , the g@@ d@@ l did not say where it wanted to strike , so it is difficult to predic@@ t the consequences in concrete terms .
mag@@ alu@@ f police chief accused of corruption
the prosecu@@ tors presented on friday the office of the maj@@ orca public prosecu@@ tor evidence of black@@ mail by police and employees of the city of cal@@ vi@@ à .
the head of the cal@@ vi@@ à police on the holiday island of mall@@ orca was arrested following charges of corruption by business@@ men and bar owners in the not@@ ori@@ ous b@@ ing@@ e drin@@ king@@ -@@ hot@@ spot mag@@ alu@@ f .
chief commissioner jo@@ s@@ é ant@@ oni@@ o na@@ var@@ ro was arrested in mag@@ alu@@ f following alleg@@ ations of corruption against him by several business@@ men from pun@@ ta b@@ all@@ ena , the street where most bars and night@@ clubs are being held .
according to the mall@@ orca di@@ ario online newspaper , the prosecu@@ tors presented on friday evidence of black@@ mail by the police and employees of the city of cal@@ vi@@ à to the office of the prosecu@@ tor for corruption control of mall@@ orca .
two other local police were arrested by the spanish civil guard in connection with the alleg@@ ations of corruption and are being consulted by a judge together with na@@ var@@ ro .
the spanish national daily ab@@ c reported that the an@@ gr@@ y night@@ club owners stated that the authorities &apos; ne@@ po@@ tism has a serious impact on their business .
&quot; it &apos;s no longer a question of mon@@ e@@ y-@@ making , it &apos;s a question of survival , &quot; one of the business@@ men said to the court .
let our live@@ li@@ hood be put out of the game .
we have nothing to lose .
mag@@ alu@@ f made international head@@ lines this summer due to a vir@@ al you@@ tube video showing an 18@@ -@@ year-@@ old british tourist who had been doing fel@@ la@@ ti@@ o on 24 men during a s@@ wee@@ p .
the island authorities have since tried to stop the illegal behaviour of alcoho@@ lic holi@@ day@@ makers in mag@@ alu@@ f by minim@@ ising the number of participants in the not@@ ori@@ ous alcoho@@ lic be@@ ver@@ ages .
the play@@ house club , where the fel@@ la@@ ti@@ o incident took place , was forced to close for a year , while play@@ house and the k@@ nei@@ p@@ ent@@ our@@ -@@ organiz@@ er car@@ n@@ age together pay a penalty of $ 5@@ ,000 .
mag@@ alu@@ f , a tourist destination popular with young british holi@@ day@@ makers , is also known for many accidents involving alcohol , including the trend of &quot; bal@@ con@@ ing &quot; by people in a balcony .
the first day of spring with we@@ t and stor@@ my weather conditions affects flights from ade@@ la@@ ide airport .
spring has given south australia a winter surprise , with strong sho@@ wers and strong wind , which affected flights from ade@@ la@@ ide airport .
the night before 9 pm , another 5@@ mm rain fell on the city , after 6.@@ 6@@ mm , which had already sun@@ k in the night .
the last ra@@ inf@@ all was the result of a series of short stor@@ my sho@@ wers , including a cast that began shortly before 8 p.m. and caused almost 4@@ mm ra@@ inf@@ all in about 10 minutes .
after last week ’ s winter caused an early do@@ se of spring , the city ’ s temperatures fell to a maximum of only 15@@ .@@ 8 ° c on monday .
the bad weather conditions probably led to the dela@@ yed lan@@ ding of a flight from vir@@ gin airlines from mel@@ bour@@ ne to ade@@ la@@ ide .
the plane was due to land shortly after 7.@@ 30 p.m. , but was hit by a wind b@@ low@@ ing - a su@@ dden change in the wind speed or direction over a short distance - and had to start through .
wind b@@ lows reached about 50 km / h on the ground at ade@@ la@@ ide airport .
the flight data showed that the plane had to start even on a second lan@@ ding flight and finally set up around 8.@@ 40 p.m.
the delay in flights resulted in some other flights being dela@@ yed , including an em@@ i@@ rates flight from du@@ ba@@ i and a qu@@ ant@@ as flight from sy@@ d@@ ney .
for ade@@ la@@ ide a maximum temperature of 16 ° c is predic@@ ted on tuesday , with possible sho@@ wers .
mat@@ thi@@ as says : high time for big net@@ working .
with the gal@@ lo@@ ping technical progress that threat@@ ens to trans@@ form our co@@ zy home into high-@@ tech control centers , our colum@@ n@@ ist ber@@ nd mat@@ thi@@ as is comfor@@ ting with a highly electronic touch .
as i write this here , my view falls on the spir@@ al cable that connec@@ ts the list@@ en@@ er to the phone , and i think : bo@@ ah , how re@@ tr@@ o is that ?
but there is one reason@@ ing behind it : if the cable were not , all the list@@ en@@ ers would fly around in the house in a very short time , and that would be even more re@@ tr@@ o .
anyway , is it true on the cel@@ tr@@ onic ( ec@@ lec@@ tic ?
no , ty@@ po@@ s : electronic ) sector the rule that the world nov@@ el@@ ty of today is the electric sc@@ ra@@ p of tomorrow , bought - out@@ dated .
and those who still have a tv set in the living room today , for example , are simply saying that they are against television in principle .
why are these considerations so important ?
because the push by i@@ fa on the radio tower this week again shows us our absolute in@@ competence in electronics matters .
the lay@@ man , who used to be blin@@ dly the washing machine and cd player , does not even understand today the purpose of the devices that are spread with un@@ fa@@ th@@ om@@ ably e@@ ph@@ emer@@ al expert press before him : &quot; arab@@ s home .
yes , is it still possible ?
what should i talk about to people who seem to be volun@@ tar@@ ily spre@@ ading such quar@@ k ?
after all , for about 20 years , the main issue here has been to make our house net@@ worked .
so that the yo@@ gh@@ ur@@ t can order itself so that the fire alarm tells us during the holiday on the mal@@ di@@ ves that it bur@@ ns in the working room degree .
and w@@ oul@@ dn &apos;t it be wonderful if we were to get the air conditioning from the office to our arrival soon ... ?
yes , but this requires air conditioning .
but a dream will come true soon : we raise our watch , say it , suc@@ k ! and the vacu@@ um robo@@ t starts at home .
it is wrong .
everything runs out of nothing less than a revolution : &quot; the borders between white and brown goods blu@@ r , &quot; a sector expert , you can link the washing machine with a head@@ phone , you don &apos;t need it .
we also know from daily practice that if a new device is really needed urgently , the battery is guaranteed to be empty .
another reason for this is that the spir@@ al cable on the phone will survive the next radio exhibitions .
israeli children are returning to their schools after the gaza war
thousands of israeli children from the areas near gaza returned to schools on monday after they had spent the summer in air@@ space , while missi@@ le and mor@@ tar stri@@ kes were reco@@ vering in the region .
the school started gave communities in southern israel a sense of joy and expec@@ tation drawn by missi@@ le laun@@ ches , but the signs of fighting are still fresh .
in the southern city of ash@@ do@@ d , the p@@ ash@@ ho@@ sh children &apos;s garden , hit by a ro@@ cket , was located before the pu@@ pil@@ s arrived in gran@@ at@@ spl@@ it@@ ters from the walls and sli@@ ding lights .
&quot; we are a bit afraid , but are ex@@ ci@@ ted , &quot; said ron@@ it b@@ art , a resid@@ ent of ki@@ b@@ but@@ z sa@@ ad and an english teacher .
many children from our region urgently need a return to a rout@@ ine .
her 1@@ 1-@@ year-@@ old daughter sh@@ ani b@@ art said that she felt a bit com@@ ical about going back to school .
&quot; these were difficult times , and we did not leave the house at all , &quot; she said .
president re@@ u@@ ven ri@@ v@@ lin visited the ki@@ b@@ but@@ z near the gaza border to offer his support .
until a ce@@ as@@ e@@ fire bro@@ ke off last week &apos;s war , thousands of border communities like sa@@ ad left their homes to move further away from gaza and go to the ro@@ cket in sa@@ fer areas .
many of the inhabitants of na@@ h@@ al o@@ z , a community near the gaza border , where a four-@@ year-@@ old boy was killed by a palestinian mur@@ de@@ rer , are still hesit@@ ating to return .
the ministry of education announced that a do@@ zen or so families had not returned .
their children have been tempor@@ arily accommo@@ dated in other schools .
prime minister ben@@ jam@@ in net@@ any@@ ah@@ u attended a school in s@@ der@@ ot , a border town to gaza that is se@@ ve@@ rely marked by palestinian fire .
he appe@@ aled to the children to learn a lot and said , &apos; we will make sure that they acquire knowledge and provide you with security &apos; .
israel and hamas agreed on an un@@ inter@@ rup@@ ted ce@@ as@@ e@@ fire last tuesday .
the ce@@ as@@ e@@ fire brought about an immediate end to the fighting , but important issues remain un@@ resolved , such as hamas ’ s demand for the israel@@ -@@ egypt bloc@@ k@@ ade of gaza and the re@@ opening of air and sea ports .
israel is calling for hamas to be dis@@ armed and for the bodies of two israeli soldiers killed in the fighting to be handed over .
a new round of indirect talks is expected to begin in egypt this month .
more than 2,@@ 100 palestinians were killed during the war , three-@@ quarters of them civili@@ ans , and at least 4@@ 94 children , according to estimates by the palestinians and the un .
israel den@@ ies these data and estimates that at least half of the people killed are figh@@ ters , but did not provide concrete evidence of this information .
on the israeli side , 66 soldiers and six civili@@ ans , including one th@@ ai work@@ er , were killed .
hamas and other gaza figh@@ ters fi@@ red 4@@ ,@@ 5@@ 91 missi@@ les and mor@@ tar sh@@ ell@@ s during fighting on israeli cities , most of them in the south of the country .
meanwhile , the israeli military carried out more than 5@@ ,000 air and other attacks .
the israeli attacks damaged or destroyed thousands of houses in the gaza area , and some 2@@ 50@@ ,000 people sought refu@@ ge in more than 100 un schools , converted into temporary shel@@ ters .
while tens of thousands of people continue to live in the refu@@ ges and the fighting continues , the educational authorities postpon@@ ed the start of the school year last week .
&quot; i hope the school is soon re@@ opened so that we can continue learning , as children in the world and jewish children , &quot; said mo@@ ham@@ ma@@ d am@@ ara , a 13@@ -@@ year-@@ old school who currently lives in z@@ a@@ ha .
at sa@@ x@@ ony &apos;s option : c@@ du@@ -@@ vi@@ ze stro@@ b@@ l calls n@@ p@@ d prohibi@@ tion procedures into question .
in view of the loss of votes of the n@@ p@@ d in sa@@ x@@ ony , c@@ du bun@@ des@@ vi@@ ze thomas stro@@ b@@ l has declared itself in favour of an end to the ongoing n@@ p@@ d prohibi@@ tion proceedings before the federal constitutional court .
berlin - according to c@@ du federal vi@@ ze thomas stro@@ b@@ l , the ongoing prohibi@@ tion proceedings against the n@@ p@@ d should be brought to an end in the federal constitutional court .
&quot; the n@@ p@@ d is doing worse than last time , &quot; said stro@@ b@@ l , who is also c@@ du head of state in bad@@ en-@@ w@@ ür@@ t@@ tem@@ berg , the &quot; le@@ ip@@ zi@@ ger vol@@ k@@ s@@ ze@@ it@@ ung &quot; .
this is a welcome development in the right direction and a development which leads me to believe that the n@@ p@@ d is being fought politically rather than before the constitutional court .
the n@@ p@@ d had failed quite close to the fi@@ ve-@@ percent@@ -@@ hur@@ dle in sunday ’ s vote .
a first attempt to ban the extreme right had failed in 2003 , because constitutional protection had inform@@ ers in the n@@ p@@ d ’ s head .
in december 2013 , the federal council submitted a new application to kar@@ ls@@ ru@@ he after long preparation .
the federal government and the bun@@ de@@ sta@@ g did not join .
harb@@ ur@@ g : t@@ ents for new refugees
refugees are now being placed in t@@ ents in the new area .
the initial reception of refugees in har@@ burg bur@@ sts from all se@@ ams .
now the interior agency has had three red cross t@@ ents set up alongside it .
the district politicians were informed just before the event - they are not very enthusi@@ astic .
&quot; these hau@@ ck actions further fuel public re@@ tic@@ ence and do not give district politicians the opportunity to play a constructive role in the human@@ e accommodation of refugees , &quot; says brit@@ ta her@@ r@@ mann , chairman of the group .
your party requires that the district administration of har@@ burg provide currently un@@ used houses for accommodation .
96 refugees can be accommo@@ dated in the three t@@ ents .
the reasons for the over@@ crow@@ ding in the first shot are the rus@@ h of those seeking help - and the fact that the authorities cannot provide sufficient places in follow-up facilities .
many refugees therefore remain longer than the regular three months .
the house prices have experienced the strong@@ est winter rise in seven years , showing a widely observed index .
r@@ p data co@@ re@@ logic he@@ don@@ ic home value index for homes in australia &apos;s capital increased by 1.@@ 1 percent in august , according to monday &apos;s r@@ p data .
this increase puts the total increase in june , july and august at 4.@@ 2 % , the largest increase in the winter months since 2007 .
the annual price rise was 10.@@ 9 % , more than twice the increase in the 12 months to august 2013 , but the increases were not even@@ ly distributed across the country .
the research director of r@@ p data , ti@@ m law@@ less , announced that sy@@ d@@ ney and mel@@ bour@@ ne are driving a two-@@ ti@@ er market .
r@@ p data ’ s figures show that house prices in sy@@ d@@ ney rose by 16@@ .@@ 1 % last year , while in mel@@ bour@@ ne by 11.@@ 7 % .
the following markets are ade@@ la@@ ide , br@@ is@@ ban@@ e and dar@@ win , where prices rose by 5 % and 6 % on average .
at the other end of the scale , can@@ ber@@ ra , hit hard by government spending cuts , and where prices rose by only 1.@@ 4 % over the year .
mr law@@ less said that the spring beginning would see an increase in the number of properties on sale in the coming months , which would &apos; test the market &apos; .
&quot; if you look at the consistently high rate of au@@ ction prices , a generally fast selling rate , and the consistently low interest rate environment , you are likely to see home prices rising even more in the next three months .
in an opinion to the new press , he contradic@@ ts statements by the managing director pe@@ er med@@ au and at@@ tests to position him as a field lord .
the style of the university is not that , it says in the communication .
the med@@ au family had already been informed ver@@ b@@ ally of the in@@ sti@@ gation of the university in mid-@@ june .
the statement that the plans were only announced in july is definitely wrong , &quot; p@@ ö@@ tz@@ l said .
at the same time , he points out that the plans are not &apos; pre@@ texts or even decisions &apos; , but there are &apos; preferences &apos; .
the extension of the narrow road up to the castle , which is necessary for access , is also less dramatic than fe@@ ared by the med@@ aus .
there was no mention of a nine metr@@ e wide road .
it is currently 5.@@ 50 metres wide , one metr@@ e wider than before , &quot; explains p@@ ö@@ tz@@ l .
the me@@ d@@ ah ’ s argument that their free and soft parking spaces will in future only be used by students of the university of applied sciences does not mean that p@@ ö@@ tz@@ l will not apply .
the hotel is very close to the city centre and the train station .
the people living near the country are thinking
according to the president of the university , the ber@@ g@@ w@@ ich@@ tel , which is located on the site and which would lead to the parking dec@@ k at the front door , should not be &quot; im@@ pa@@ ired &quot; .
he would rather point out that &quot; this is not just about the children &apos;s cr@@ è@@ che , but also about the residents at the mouth of fried@@ rich@@ -@@ stre@@ i@@ b street and the 800 pu@@ pil@@ s of neighbouring real school .
so it is much more than the special interests of mr med@@ au , &quot; p@@ ö@@ tz@@ l said .
whether the criticism of the paren@@ tal advisory committee of the children &apos;s cri@@ b , with the extension of the road would be justified by &quot; the few natural spots of co@@ burg are lost &quot; , &quot; the reader can decide himself &quot; .
in early october , p@@ ö@@ tz@@ l and the b@@ am@@ berg state building office will inform the city council &apos;s city counc@@ ils about the development of the university &apos;s buildings by 2020 &quot; and will address the importance of the new development in this context &quot; .
pe@@ er med@@ au informed the parents of the children &apos;s cri@@ b about the college &apos;s plans last week .
the new parking dec@@ k should not be accessible via camp@@ us and fried@@ rich@@ -@@ stre@@ ib@@ stra@@ ß@@ e , as it has been before , but via the me@@ d@@ al-@@ berg .
this would mean that the narrow road would have to be extended two-@@ lan@@ e over a kil@@ ome@@ tre length .
according to the me@@ da@@ u ’ s statements , this would mean that traffic in the park of sch@@ loss ho@@ hen@@ f@@ els would increase ten@@ fold .
there is talk of about 2000 vehicles a day .
the city has not yet w@@ ished to comment on the project .
g@@ lan@@ g@@ or@@ f re@@ signs from the national hand@@ ball team .
hol@@ ger gol@@ and@@ or@@ f will no longer play for the dh@@ b team .
the 3@@ 1-@@ year-@@ old from the bun@@ des@@ lig@@ ist s@@ g fl@@ ens@@ bur@@ g-@@ han@@ de@@ wit@@ t mainly caused health problems for this decision .
i have not been able to make the decision easily , it has been mature for several months .
it is time for me to listen to the signals of my body and finish my career in the national team , &quot; said the world champi@@ on of 2007 on his fac@@ e@@ book page .
he is therefore taking the international reti@@ rement with a balance sheet of 16@@ 7 country games and 5@@ 76 goals for germany .
the new bun@@ de@@ stra@@ iner d@@ ag@@ ur si@@ gur@@ d is no longer available for the run@@ ner@@ -up player for the champi@@ ons league winner from fl@@ ens@@ burg , who wants to go hun@@ ting for a few years .
the ic@@ el@@ and@@ ers , who announced his cad@@ re for the country games against switzerland on tuesday , gave g@@ lan@@ dorf a &quot; long and good con@@ vers@@ ation .
i was just as enthusi@@ astic about his ideas and approaches as you will be am@@ a@@ zed by my long-@@ time fellow players and my success@@ ors .
but i want to be available for my club in the coming years , but it will require longer reg@@ ener@@ ation breaks , which will not allow the current double load .
the left hand had to fear his career end in 2012 after a he@@ el inf@@ ection .
he was also a member of the german hand@@ ball federation ( dh@@ b ) team physi@@ ci@@ ans , who had a cor@@ ti@@ son injec@@ tion which caused a strong infl@@ am@@ mation .
an emergency operation and two other interven@@ tions followed .
g@@ lan@@ dorf then announced a compla@@ int against the team doctor , and the dispute ended with a comparison .
twelve years of professional and ele@@ ven years of national team career do not pass without tr@@ ace on any body .
i have some health building sites that i can &apos;t ignore any@@ more .
after the three short inter@@ vals of inf@@ ec@@ tion-@@ related foot operations in 2012 , i have never got my blood pressure under control .
this includes a number of other we@@ ar@@ -@@ related complaints .
already at the beginning of the year i noticed that although i ste@@ er my head , i cannot dec@@ ei@@ ve my body , &quot; g@@ land@@ or@@ f explained the magazine &quot; hand@@ ball time &quot; in the interview .
he would only be ready for a com@@ e@@ back in absolute emergency .
&quot; when all the p@@ aces are te@@ aring , i am always ready for discussion , &quot; the double father declared to the magazine .
however , i can count the years in which i can still play hand@@ ball at a single hand .
i must also say that after my long stay in hospital in 2012 , i also became quite hum@@ ble in terms of my health .
after my career i would like to be able to go at least to some extent .
in addition to the world cup title 2007 and the win of champi@@ ons league 20@@ 14 , he ho@@ sted the e@@ h@@ f cup in 2008 ( h@@ s@@ g n@@ ord@@ hor@@ n ) and 2010 ( t@@ b@@ v le@@ m@@ go ) .
in 2012 he also won the european cup with fl@@ ens@@ burg .
germany ’ s economy sh@@ rank by 0.@@ 2 % in the spring
the crises around the world slow@@ ed the german economy in the second quarter .
gdp fell by 0.@@ 2 % compared to the prior quarter of april until the end of june 20@@ 14 .
this was shared by the federal statistical office and confirmed preliminary calcu@@ lations .
consumption alone revi@@ ved the economy in the spring , while investment decreas@@ ed .
foreign trade , too , slow@@ ed the economy .
thanks to the strong annual start , the first half of the year will see a gdp increase of 0.@@ 8 % over the second half of 2013 .
hor@@ st@@ mar was the starting point and the destination of the &quot; m@@ ün@@ ster@@ land mo@@ o@@ i@@ ste &quot; , which led the city of bur@@ g@@ man@@ n@@ s@@ stadt for the first time on sunday .
the bur@@ g@@ man@@ n@@ stadt hor@@ st@@ mar experienced an inv@@ asion of dutch &quot; fe@@ tz driver &quot; on sunday .
the largest cycling association in the netherlands , n@@ t@@ f@@ u , organised the so-called &quot; m@@ ün@@ ster@@ lan@@ de mo@@ o@@ i@@ ste &quot; .
it is the largest cycle tour across m@@ ün@@ ster@@ land , the cy@@ c@@ list paradise near the netherlands .
more than 1000 participants than@@ ked jo@@ s ter hu@@ er@@ ne for organis@@ ing this tour through the m@@ ün@@ ster@@ land .
the tour was offered in various trade magaz@@ ines .
we come from the her@@ oes and we went over@@ night to take part in this tour .
we would like to get to know m@@ ün@@ ster@@ land in this way too , &quot; cy@@ cli@@ sts were happy about the route through the cir@@ cles ste@@ in@@ furt , bor@@ ken and co@@ es@@ fel@@ d .
after registration at the club house of the sch@@ ü@@ tz@@ en@@ bru@@ der@@ schaft sta .
k@@ ath@@ ar@@ ina went on a small &quot; peace ride &quot; through the city over the wall , where the start was also made .
the route , which was adver@@ ti@@ sed for three different categories , went towards her@@ ren@@ hol@@ z over the sch@@ ö@@ pp@@ inger berg towards co@@ es@@ fel@@ d and via ha@@ vi@@ x@@ bec@@ k and b@@ ill@@ er@@ bec@@ k back to hor@@ st@@ mar .
on routes of 95 kilometres with 1@@ 17@@ 5 metres of al@@ titude , 120 kilometres with 14@@ 75 metres of al@@ titude and 14@@ 5 kilometres with 17@@ 75 metres of al@@ titude , cy@@ cli@@ sts have proven their good condition .
they were taken on the road in ha@@ vi@@ x@@ bec@@ k and b@@ ill@@ er@@ bec@@ k .
the main organiz@@ er jo@@ s ter hu@@ er@@ ne and may@@ or he@@ in@@ z l@@ ö@@ l@@ fing were very pleased with the success of this cycling event .
we are satisfied and it was a nice experience for all concerned .
the organization went without any problems and there were no negative inci@@ dents , &quot; says he@@ in@@ z l@@ ö@@ l@@ fing , a positive conclusion of this event .
unfortunately , not as many participants as the organis@@ er had hoped , which was due to the bad weather forec@@ asts and the rain in the morning .
&quot; we will see ourselves again in 20@@ 15 in hopefully nice weather on august 30 or during another weekend , &quot; but still promised the cy@@ cli@@ sts to return to m@@ ün@@ ster@@ land and the organiz@@ ers are planning to re@@ run .
con@@ stan@@ t@@ ine w@@ ec@@ ker ’ s un@@ scr@@ up@@ ulous honest mem@@ o@@ irs
it is actually more philosoph@@ ical evidence than bio@@ graphy , which has brought kon@@ stan@@ tin w@@ ack@@ er , song@@ maker , paci@@ f@@ ist , polit@@ safe acti@@ vis@@ t , ex@@ -@@ prison@@ er , in &quot; mon@@ k and mon@@ k .
the munich born on june 1 , 194@@ 7 , did not chron@@ o@@ log@@ ically , but more s@@ wee@@ ts of thought for thought , writing his mem@@ o@@ irs , introducing each chapter with a suitable ly@@ ric@@ s .
and he is ru@@ th@@ lessly honest : from on@@ ani@@ um as a gy@@ m@@ na@@ si@@ ast to sho@@ p@@ lif@@ ting and drug use , he does not ex@@ pose human weak@@ ness .
also to show how he has learned tolerance in his own way in dealing with his fellow men .
wide space also take ab@@ str@@ act , but even more important terms : love , soul , e@@ go , being in the now , spirit@@ u@@ ality - all that he tries to get to the bottom of it , in a very personal but also very philosoph@@ ical way .
he also explains his paci@@ f@@ ism , his social criticism , his political commitment - and also how he has influenced not only music ( the opera lo@@ ver became a sou@@ l and rock prison musici@@ an ) , but also his stay .
the latter has also brought the le@@ be@@ mann kon@@ stan@@ tin w@@ ack@@ er closer to the as@@ ce@@ tic mon@@ k , which &quot; by sub@@ tr@@ action &quot; ar@@ ises , as he says , &quot; by leaving everything unnecessary &quot; away .
the first is the first , and the second , and the second , is the second , and the second , and the second , and the third , is the second , and the third , and the third , the second , and third .
here , too , he is ru@@ th@@ lessly honest .
len@@ ny hen@@ ry : my father never took me into the arm .
never said &apos; i love you &apos;
hen@@ ry was one of seven children of a jam@@ a@@ ic@@ an immi@@ grant family in du@@ d@@ ley in the mid@@ lands in 195@@ 8 .
his father , who died when hen@@ ry 19 was working in a factory and her relationship was limited .
hen@@ ry is trying for a com@@ edy , ru@@ dy &apos;s rare records , which is partly based on an imag@@ inary con@@ vers@@ ation with his father and origin@@ ated from the series on radio 4 .
the sound@@ track is a mix@@ ture of reg@@ ga@@ e and ra@@ p , with lively me@@ lo@@ dies .
but hen@@ ry had to work through some difficult moments of child@@ hood .
he attended &quot; many &quot; therap@@ ies after the death of his mother , and hen@@ ry is refl@@ ec@@ tive of his relationship with his father .
it was difficult to know him .
one never saw his face , only heard his voice : &quot; stop the cr@@ ash .
leave your si@@ ster in peace .
go ahead !
i want to look at cr@@ ick@@ et .
my older bro@@ thers se@@ y@@ m@@ our and hil@@ ton - who were already grown up when i was a child - went to the pu@@ b and talked about things like the shape of the beer glass or the beauty of a cr@@ ick@@ et .
i never had such a con@@ vers@@ ation with him .
much of my life he was this serious gu@@ y in the corner who read the newspaper .
recently , hen@@ ry opened a foun@@ dry in du@@ d@@ ley , and although the conditions are better than they were in his father &apos;s time , he gained an insight into how life might have been for him .
it is now slightly bri@@ ghter , but they are dark , smo@@ ky , deep sty@@ gic lab@@ y@@ r@@ in@@ th with fl@@ ame bu@@ gs and smo@@ ke and much so@@ ot .
my father simply put himself in the bath and then he could slowly hear him begin sing@@ ing because he could w@@ ash the foun@@ dry of himself .
when i went around it , i realized that he had done that for years to bring the food on the table and my respect for him increased .
hen@@ ry was born in the united states , but died in the late 23@@ 7@@ 0s .
my father never embr@@ ac@@ ed me , he never said &quot; i love you &quot; .
only when my mother went badly towards the end of her life did we begin to say , &quot; i love you , i love you , i love you &quot; .
his daughter , tr@@ il@@ lie , with da@@ wn french , helped share the love he had missed as a child .
could you stop with the &quot; i love you &quot; ?
stop hu@@ gging me !
pap@@ a , i am 22 .
with da@@ wn french .
why should we not be friends ?
she is a great mother .
he was still a friend of french , with whom he was 25 years old .
da@@ wn is a good man .
why should we not be friends ?
she is a great mother .
hen@@ ry &apos;s own mother was a di@@ abe@@ tic .
this contributed to their death .
so when i became very , very over@@ weight and showed symp@@ t@@ oms of di@@ abe@@ tes , my doctor said , &quot; they must be radical .
so i got this fitness thing through and also had to make a dr@@ astic di@@ et to reverse the symp@@ t@@ oms .
it is very difficult .
and it is ti@@ ring .
nobody li@@ kes to eat car@@ ro@@ ts .
hen@@ ry &apos;s career change may be shown in his elegant , short cut be@@ ard .
since he was p@@ raised by the cri@@ tics for his o@@ th@@ ell@@ o , he has been cap@@ tured by the theatre .
it followed the com@@ edy of the errors , and then f@@ ences of august wil@@ son .
this is a different experience from the sit@@ com@@ s and com@@ edy who have filled out their busy working lives .
he began only 16 years when he worked in a factory .
a d@@ j discovered him on stage when he im@@ it@@ ated people and wrote about him on new faces .
his television career began in the mid-@@ 197@@ 0s , &apos; i was the only black im@@ it@@ ator / com@@ edi@@ an on television for a quite long time . &apos;
he learned at work .
not only did i have to get big in the eyes of the public , but also from 197@@ 5 to 198@@ 5 i had to learn how to become an efficient wit@@ z nar@@ ra@@ tive machine while watching television , and that was really difficult .
len@@ ny 197@@ 5 at new faces
as his manager had the right to stage at the black and white min@@ stre@@ l show , a light entertainment program in which people &quot; pain@@ ted &quot; , hen@@ ry went on to perform his com@@ edy for five years .
my family was very un@@ comfortable with this .
i some@@ how w@@ ished it had never happened , but i am not sorry to have done so .
it was a strange , un@@ pleasant position for me , but i was involved in giant projects and learned how to deal with a large audience .
but this &quot; year@@ long award winning light pillar of british television &quot; was also a &quot; gro@@ te@@ s@@ que par@@ o@@ dy of black people . &quot;
hen@@ ry worked in an alternative com@@ edy circle in the 198@@ 0s by introducing figures that both deri@@ ded and celebrated british black culture .
the first series of the len@@ ny hen@@ ry show was broad@@ cast in 198@@ 4 , and in the 199@@ 0s he was known as the ch@@ ef gare@@ th black@@ lock in the com@@ edy series ch@@ ef !
the next decade , however , after his bb@@ c series len@@ ny@@ hen@@ ry@@ .@@ tv , he thought , &quot; what do you do next ?
after that came a docum@@ entary series for radio 4 ti@@ tled what &apos;s so great about ... ?
the first episode was about sha@@ kes@@ pe@@ are .
i was very aller@@ gic to sha@@ kes@@ pe@@ are .
i had never learned a thing about him in school and thought it was mostly a domain of the middle class , white in ti@@ ghts and a coal head in front of it .
so i was very afraid .
all of us who inter@@ viewed for the show , peter hall , tre@@ v@@ or n@@ un@@ n , adri@@ an les@@ ter , ju@@ di den@@ ch said &quot; you should try it .
don &apos;t make it bad if you don &apos;t know what you are talking about .
put a few words into your mouth , and then you will understand why we all love sha@@ kes@@ pe@@ are so much .
hen@@ ry wrote 20 lines of o@@ th@@ le@@ ich &apos;s last speech for the docum@@ entary and he was thr@@ illed .
i felt that i could do that .
it was almost as if someone had finally set my head up properly .
&quot; that &apos;s what it &apos;s all about , it &apos;s a serious thing , take you seriously , read your text , search a bit .
the sam@@ ples were brut@@ al and i read this piece for months before we made it .
and it was a success .
they seemed to expect a car accident , and that simply did not happen .
and soon he appeared in the com@@ edy of the errors .
suddenly i was in the national theatre and i could hardly believe it .
there was a moment when i thought , &apos; o@@ h , you changed you &apos; .
there was a technical error and hen@@ ry felt inst@@ inc@@ tively that he had to enter@@ tain the audience .
&quot; one small voice told me &quot; you have to bridge it for 10 minutes now while you are repa@@ iring the computer &quot; .
instead , the stage manager announced that the idea would continue once the problem had been resolved .
i went from the stage and something in me said &quot; o@@ h , thank god &quot; .
i am not responsible for this .
i can leave it to someone else .
&quot; you play in a play , so stay in your role . &quot;
hen@@ ry in f@@ ences
the text for f@@ ences learning was challenging .
pan@@ ic is very good , it strength@@ ens the tend@@ encies .
that was also good , so it is like a great shi@@ eld of the go@@ ds who say to me &quot; this is your dest@@ iny &quot; .
he says so , of course , with a th@@ under@@ ing voice .
so i will stick to it .
i really love that .
i love to be in a re@@ hear@@ s@@ al room .
hen@@ ry still has the head of a com@@ edi@@ an , though , our con@@ vers@@ ation is full of hum@@ or@@ ous er@@ up@@ tions while he always im@@ it@@ ates people .
i decided not to make a stand@@ -up com@@ edy because i think that this type of immediate satisfaction from a room full of str@@ ang@@ ers is some@@ how dangerous .
if you look for that , you will see a wall in front of you .
i sometimes perform live in apo@@ llo if i want to , but overall i don &apos;t have as much as i did before .
i ask him whether he will ever go on a stand@@ -up com@@ edy tour again .
the fun i have in a room with a director who helps shape a beginning , a middle part and the end of a journey - i do not think i would ever want to give up that .
so is this his new inc@@ ar@@ nation ?
i think so .
i am a fan of the actors .
it is fun .
you always tell a story , and that is great .
i love stories .
people love stories .
hu@@ thi@@ -@@ re@@ be@@ ls block streets in y@@ em@@ en ’ s capital
in the conflict between shi@@ a hu@@ thi@@ -@@ re@@ be@@ ls and y@@ em@@ en@@ i ’ s government , hu@@ th@@ is have called for civil dis@@ o@@ be@@ di@@ ence in the capital , san@@ a@@ a .
hu@@ thi@@ -@@ sup@@ porters had occupied central streets in san@@ a@@ a on monday , said a spo@@ kes@@ man of the hu@@ th party &quot; ans@@ ar allah &quot; .
access to parliament has also been bloc@@ ked .
y@@ em@@ en@@ i media report a traffic cha@@ os in the capital .
according to the online edition of the newspaper &quot; y@@ em@@ en post &quot; , hu@@ thi@@ -@@ leader ab@@ dul@@ m@@ ali@@ k al-@@ hu@@ th@@ i called for action on sunday evening .
hu@@ th@@ i , according to the sheet , threatened to es@@ cal@@ ate further the conflict if his demands were not met .
shi@@ a hu@@ th@@ is are fighting for more independence from sun@@ ni@@ -@@ rul@@ ed y@@ em@@ en and are demanding the re@@ sign@@ ation of the government .
the hu@@ th@@ i people &apos;s tri@@ be has be@@ sie@@ ged the y@@ em@@ en@@ i capital for almost two weeks .
some 30@@ ,000 re@@ be@@ ls have built protest camps along the main access roads of san@@ a@@ a .
in the surrounding area , bloo@@ dy batt@@ les are constantly taking place with the y@@ em@@ en@@ i army .
ken@@ ya regi@@ sters officials to contain &quot; g@@ host workers &quot;
ken@@ ya has begun to register all state officials bi@@ ome@@ tr@@ ically to remove &quot; g@@ host workers &quot; from the government &apos;s pay lists .
employees who do not register in the next two weeks would no longer pay , was a government communication .
the government susp@@ ects that thousands of people will still receive sal@@ aries even after they leave the public service .
president u@@ hur@@ u ken@@ y@@ att@@ a promised in his in@@ aug@@ ur@@ ation in 2013 to fight corruption in public service .
a review earlier this year found that at least $ 1 million ( £ 7@@ 00@@ ,000 ) per month was lost in payments for &quot; g@@ host workers &quot; and other ab@@ u@@ sive financial practices .
the government susp@@ ects that wages will continue to be paid on accounts after a person has died or leaves the public service , says wan@@ y@@ ama che@@ bu@@ si@@ ri for the bb@@ c from the capital na@@ i@@ rob@@ i .
all officials must now appear at identification centres in the next two weeks to ensure that their data on bi@@ ome@@ tric regi@@ stra@@ tions are recorded , was notified in a government notice .
all those who would not do so without a credible apo@@ logy would be removed from the pay@@ roll , then the communication went on .
&quot; this approach will make a major contribution to ra@@ tion@@ alising the public service by identi@@ fying the actual number of officials and also pur@@ i@@ fying the pay@@ roll at both levels of government - thus , the &quot; g@@ host cre@@ ator &apos;s &quot; elimin@@ ation .
the scand@@ al surrounding art consult@@ ant hel@@ ge ach@@ en@@ bach will be first negotiated in court on 11 november .
five he@@ irs of ber@@ th@@ old al@@ bre@@ cht , son of al@@ di founder the@@ o al@@ bre@@ cht , claim damages from ach@@ en@@ bach and two of his companies in a civil trial at the d@@ üs@@ sel@@ dorf district court .
a court spo@@ kes@@ man told this on monday .
the compla@@ int states that ach@@ en@@ bach che@@ ated when buying works of art and v@@ int@@ age tim@@ ers and ber@@ th@@ old al@@ bre@@ cht calculated higher than actually paid purchase prices .
this has also raised the agreed commission .
ach@@ en@@ bach bought valu@@ ables for eur 12@@ 1 million for al@@ bre@@ cht .
children need roots and w@@ ings
he was in school for 44 years , 23 of them as a school master .
from this time , man@@ f@@ red rich@@ ter knows many of the pe@@ ter@@ sha@@ us@@ en@@ er and k@@ ol@@ l@@ b@@ ach@@ er who had been born in berlin and lived in berlin .
his methods were sometimes un@@ conventional , but always inspired by his desire to see the person in the student .
the snow@@ board is the most famous mountain in the giant mountains .
man@@ f@@ red rich@@ ter lo@@ ves the painting with the mo@@ ti@@ f from his home country .
judge was born in 19@@ 30 in tr@@ au@@ ten@@ au / north bo@@ hem@@ ia , today tr@@ ut@@ no@@ v .
after four years of secondary school , he was already 14 and was interested in the profes@@ sion of teacher .
one year later , the su@@ de@@ ten german@@ s were ex@@ propri@@ ated .
within half an hour the family had to leave their house .
after a few months in a ware@@ house , it went to bav@@ aria in 194@@ 6 - in the freight wag@@ on .
so it beat jud@@ ges into the ob@@ er@@ fran@@ k@@ is@@ che sen@@ k@@ endor@@ f .
the teacher training took place in b@@ am@@ berg .
man@@ f@@ red rich@@ ter had to walk ten kilometres to the ne@@ arest railway station six times a week , travel by train to b@@ am@@ berg , walk three kilometres across the city and return in the evening .
after two months , man@@ f@@ red rich@@ ter had a sle@@ eping opportunity in a re@@ d-@@ cross home in b@@ am@@ berg : together with up to 15 students in a dor@@ mit@@ ory .
in 195@@ 1 he made the first and in 195@@ 4 , after three years of law , he became the second state candidate .
since ob@@ er@@ fran@@ ken had no free teacher for him , he went to ob@@ er@@ bay@@ er@@ n and came to the school in k@@ ol@@ l@@ bach on november 1 , 195@@ 4 .
the &quot; m@@ r@@ ä@@ u@@ le@@ in room &quot; was his first &quot; service apartment &quot; in the school building .
in 195@@ 8 he moved to the newly built teacher house next to the school to make a three-@@ room service apartment .
this house bought man@@ f@@ red rich@@ ter in 1980 after the school in k@@ ol@@ l@@ bach had been dis@@ solved in 196@@ 8 .
until then , there were three classes in the pe@@ ter@@ sha@@ us@@ en-@@ k@@ ol@@ l@@ bach school association in k@@ ol@@ l@@ bach and five in pe@@ ter@@ sha@@ us@@ en .
from 196@@ 8 / 69 , these were mer@@ ged into pe@@ ter@@ sha@@ us@@ en in the present town hall .
when the in@@ der@@ s@@ dorf school association was founded , only primary school remained in the place .
to avoid a down@@ grade in the now smaller school , the then rec@@ tor geor@@ g si@@ gl moved to kar@@ ls@@ fel@@ d – and man@@ f@@ red rich@@ ter became his success@@ or .
but pe@@ ter@@ sha@@ us@@ en grew , and so the children and their teachers were able to move into the current building from september 198@@ 2 , which was expanded in 1997 after judicial reti@@ rement .
the first building was built in the city of lu@@ d@@ wi@@ g g@@ ö@@ tz , which was built in 1997 by the school &apos;s guidelines , and was built by the local authorities .
&quot; may@@ or g@@ ö@@ tz was very scho@@ ol@@ -@@ friendly , &quot; judge re@@ mem@@ bered .
throughout his career , man@@ f@@ red rich@@ ter never for@@ got the speech of a government representative who respon@@ ded to a school council on law and justice : &quot; one must never forget love for jud@@ ges . &quot;
&quot; you have to give the children two things : roots and w@@ ings , &quot; says the 8@@ 4-@@ year-@@ old .
he had to learn : &quot; this is not always possible &quot; , but whether he means only his students or his own six children is not very clear .
in any case , jud@@ ges were sometimes un@@ conventional .
when students were checked , they did not receive a p@@ uni@@ tive report from him and were not don@@ ated to the post .
at the municip@@ al cost , judge had had two pa@@ irs of bo@@ x@@ ing glo@@ ves purchased and let the two oppon@@ ents compete , even if there was a little bit of a ve@@ il .
for the benefit of the school , jud@@ ges had a good relationship as rec@@ tor with the then may@@ or lu@@ d@@ wi@@ g g@@ ö@@ tz ( c@@ su ) .
after reti@@ ring , he moved the non-@@ par@@ tis@@ an judge to stand for the council of municip@@ alities , at least as the last on the c@@ su list in 1996 .
yet jud@@ ges were selected to sit six , and joined the c@@ su .
18@@ 0 kilometres in three days
hr@@ 4-@@ rad@@ tour 700 bi@@ kers take intermedi@@ ate stops at the kur@@ park bad salz@@ haus@@ en and sch@@ ot@@ ten .
if rad@@ kers take a rest on their tour in bad salz@@ haus@@ en or sch@@ ot@@ ten , that is not in itself a special thing .
on friday , however , the number of people who are st@@ uck in the mo@@ od was the only one : the 700 participants of the hr@@ 4 cycle tour and the accompan@@ ying tro@@ l@@ ley enjoyed a break in the lower spa park of bad salz@@ haus@@ en .
the participants had a meeting on thursday in bad vil@@ bel and had a concert by van ba@@ ker &amp; band .
on friday it became serious : the cy@@ cli@@ sts took the first stage , which started 60 kilometres over fl@@ or@@ stadt to bad salz@@ haus@@ en and further to scotland .
in bad salz@@ haus@@ en , the athle@@ tes were welcomed by may@@ or han@@ s-@@ peter s@@ eu@@ m , who had started with the bicycle in bad vil@@ bel , and the director of the own company bad salz@@ haus@@ en , pe@@ tra sch@@ win@@ kel .
to refres@@ h body and mind , all kinds of good things had been prepared : the rural women from ran@@ stadt and ni@@ e@@ der@@ -@@ mo@@ ck@@ stadt had 85 plates of apple , po@@ cket , spre@@ ad@@ er and spre@@ ad@@ er c@@ ages .
&quot; such ca@@ kes can only ba@@ ke women in rural areas , &quot; a particip@@ ant from a@@ ul@@ en@@ di@@ e@@ bach p@@ raised him while he ordered another piece .
cold refres@@ h@@ ments could be purchased at the tur@@ n@@ vere@@ in s@@ ü@@ ß@@ -@@ ni@@ d@@ da drinks stand .
the du@@ o bra@@ vo enter@@ tained visitors with well-known me@@ lo@@ dies from o@@ pe@@ re@@ tt@@ as and musi@@ c@@ als and har@@ ves@@ ted enthusi@@ astic applause .
the hotel was very clean and the staff were very helpful .
a gentle@@ man also enjoyed a head massage from his partner : &quot; he deserves that , after all , he has already fixed broken cycle cha@@ ins today &quot; .
meanwhile , the may@@ or and the manager had to work : they were inter@@ viewed at the foun@@ tain in front of the drinking spa of re@@ porter ra@@ iner jan@@ ke and took the opportunity to adver@@ tise on the radio for bad salz@@ haus@@ en .
to@@ bi@@ as h@@ agen , the head of the promo@@ tional team , has only been short in his career since the first hr@@ 4 bike tour in 2004 , having had a lot to do with the technology on the spot .
fac@@ e@@ book &apos;s pic@@ k@@ up tr@@ uck , in which he communic@@ ated with his staff via three phones and a radio unit , and the 15@@ -@@ person motor@@ cycle squ@@ ad@@ ron of the police h@@ ess@@ en , also made a speech .
&quot; the majority of participants come from the r@@ hin@@ e-@@ main@@ -@@ region , &quot; he told , &quot; but also from gi@@ e@@ ß@@ en or ful@@ da , lau@@ ter@@ bach or the ta@@ un@@ us and even from numerous cities in western fal@@ un .
the number of participants depends a bit on the available accommodation capacities .
in category i participants will be accommo@@ dated in hotels , in category ii in group accommodation .
the cy@@ cli@@ sts had a good impression of the resort when they left after an hour and a half : &quot; t@@ sch@@ ü@@ ss ! &quot;
&quot; it was beautiful in bad salz@@ haus@@ en ! &quot; win@@ ked to f@@ are@@ well .
after arriving in scotland , the group was allowed to take a short break .
but in the evening the cy@@ cli@@ sts were called for in the id@@ yl@@ lic al@@ te@@ bur@@ g@@ park .
under the direction of the scot@@ tish tourism and city marketing ( g@@ ts ) , the park had a nice fe@@ st@@ ambi@@ ente and of course , they had prepared delicious ca@@ kes with a well-@@ cool@@ ed fea@@ ther white .
may@@ or sus@@ anne sch@@ a@@ ab , g@@ ts managing director mark@@ us ho@@ ß@@ fel@@ d and m@@ s@@ c chairman wol@@ f@@ gan@@ g wag@@ ner@@ -@@ s@@ ach@@ s welcomed the visitors in his role as member of the board of directors of ad@@ ac h@@ ess@@ en-@@ thur@@ in@@ gia .
the three were obviously delighted by the &quot; many businesses in sco@@ ts &quot; .
d@@ j to@@ bi@@ as h@@ agen then released the dance stage .
the opportunity to move freely under the sky was se@@ duc@@ ed despite the sporting activity on the bike .
among the guests , there were increasingly mixed citizens who were as enthusi@@ astic about the good mo@@ od as the great treas@@ ure of cy@@ cli@@ sts .
on the second day the bi@@ kers had the bir@@ stein , w@@ ü@@ ch@@ ter@@ s@@ bach and bad or@@ b stations - including a concert with the tren@@ k@@ wal@@ der - on their agenda .
yesterday , after 18@@ 0 kilometres of ra@@ del@@ ns , the athle@@ tes came back to bad vil@@ bel .
do@@ z@@ ens of turkish police officers arrested for &quot; con@@ spir@@ acy &quot; against the government
a total of 33 police officers were arrested in turkey on susp@@ ici@@ on of &apos; con@@ spir@@ acy against the government &apos; , and local media agencies report .
the police authorities did not comment immediately .
among the arrested are 14 high-@@ ran@@ king police , reports h@@ ür@@ ri@@ yet daily news .
some of them participated in the corruption investigations against government officials , including four government ministers last december .
in july , a number of turkish police arrested a number of turkish police officers for sup@@ pos@@ ed@@ ly establishing an organised criminal association and ta@@ pping telephone numbers .
turkish president rec@@ ep ta@@ y@@ y@@ y@@ ip er@@ do@@ gan ( who was then prime minister ) described her as part of the activities led by the islam@@ ist cl@@ er@@ gy@@ man fe@@ th@@ ul@@ la g@@ ü@@ l@@ len to power and others .
not all the children in ukraine are returning to school
schools in almost all of ukraine opened on monday ( september 1 ) after the summer holidays .
this day is tradi@@ tionally an important day for families , and , like thousands of other ukra@@ inian parents , prime minister ar@@ sen@@ i@@ j j@@ az@@ en@@ ju@@ k brought his daughter to school .
he informed war@@ ring journalists that not all schools had re@@ opened , but that he was determined to defend the country for future generations :
september celebra@@ tions were not held in every school .
the sky is not peaceful all over ukraine .
we must fight for a peaceful heav@@ en .
the whole of ukraine , a huge common ukra@@ inian people &apos;s front , must fight for a peaceful heav@@ en .
ale@@ k@@ san pa@@ stu@@ k@@ how , school director of school in sla@@ v@@ jan@@ sk , who attended j@@ az@@ en@@ ju@@ k &apos;s daughter , spoke in russian .
we hope that peace will finally re@@ ign here and that children will receive an education that will be useful to them in the future .
the first day of school in the new school year is tradi@@ tionally celebrated , with children we@@ aring em@@ bro@@ ide@@ red shir@@ ts , holding bal@@ lo@@ ons in their hands and giving flowers to their teachers .
with ron@@ a fair@@ head , the bb@@ c may have found the great director it needs .
it comes in with a proud st@@ um@@ bling sta@@ b from the banking world , media management , and the inner circle of the tory party .
and she has her own fron@@ tal experience .
she began her career with the global management consult@@ ancy ba@@ in and co . , to which she moved to mor@@ gan stan@@ ley , bom@@ ba@@ di@@ er , ic@@ i and the media world of pe@@ ar@@ s@@ ons .
she served as chief executive officer of the financial times for seven years and re@@ signed when the chief post of parent company pe@@ ar@@ son went to a younger male colleague .
their compensation was sup@@ pos@@ ed@@ ly £ 1 million .
their political ran@@ king is also sound .
she was recommended to david camer@@ on by lord bro@@ wn@@ e , the former chairman of b@@ p , when he was looking for more private knowledge in wh@@ ite@@ hall : she became the advis@@ or of the cab@@ in@@ et .
her hus@@ band is a former tory council member .
in may i described the chair &apos;s task with a po@@ is@@ oned cel@@ ch .
not only is the bb@@ c a huge and complex entity in the heart of public life , but there is also an internal par@@ ado@@ x in its structure .
confidence has two directions : in@@ war@@ d-@@ looking at the bb@@ c ’ s own management hier@@ arch@@ y , but also ou@@ tw@@ ar@@ dly as the voice of public concern and dis@@ quiet when things go wrong .
this creates an almost un@@ ten@@ able du@@ o@@ po@@ ly that requires full reform .
but what new leader would risk coming , going for everything , and divi@@ ding an institution that is as complex as a chinese dy@@ na@@ sty , while perhaps taking himself for his job .
it is a difficult task .
and as if that were not enough , many are also interested in seeing the bb@@ c reduced - power , money and status out@@ dated .
as competition approaches and new technologies thre@@ aten old , comfortable col@@ lateral , the upcoming bar@@ gaining of licence fees for the bb@@ c is bound to pose particular risks .
the modest sum of £ 14@@ 5.@@ 50 per year is being bought by the british public into what is surely the largest media company in the world .
the bb@@ c tells a good story : it says that it reach@@ es 96 % of all house@@ holds , and costs only 40 p@@ ence per day .
and it seems that the bb@@ c is rising up again on the popul@@ arity scale : 53 % support it today , compared to 31 % 10 years ago .
the visual and usage hab@@ its for the bb@@ c have changed : i get news head@@ lines on my mobile today and see missing programs later on my i@@ player .
but it remains a very be@@ loved and no@@ table institution .
she needs a remarkable chairman - i hope she has found him .
per@@ ry from tex@@ as says that lo@@ oting t@@ we@@ et was not authorized .
a t@@ we@@ et from the official account of the republic@@ an govern@@ or of tex@@ as , ric@@ k per@@ ry , on sunday contained a de@@ pressing comment about the democratic district prosecu@@ tor , who is at the centre of a mis@@ rule .
the t@@ we@@ et was later deleted and replaced by another per@@ ry user account that tr@@ un@@ c@@ ated the previous one .
a t@@ we@@ et has just been sent from my account , which was not authorized by me .
&quot; i do not approve of the t@@ we@@ et and have deleted it , &quot; it was said in the later message .
per@@ ry staff did not respond immediately to requests for comments .
although per@@ ry &apos;s official user account was running , it was not clear who actually uses the feed .
the former t@@ we@@ et pain@@ ted an un@@ favourable picture of the district prosecu@@ tor of trav@@ is county , ros@@ em@@ ary le@@ h@@ m@@ berg , who was sent@@ enced to tax ri@@ g@@ our in april 2013 .
per@@ ry ve@@ to@@ ed financial support for her office when she refused to resi@@ gn , leading to an indic@@ tment in a grand jury against per@@ ry - possibly in 20@@ 16 as a presidential candidate - in a month .
the text of the t@@ wee@@ ts reads : &quot; i do not always drive dr@@ un@@ k with the three-@@ fold allowed alcohol level ... but if i do , i compla@@ in to govern@@ or per@@ ry when he spe@@ aks .
i am the most dr@@ un@@ k democr@@ at in tex@@ as .
le@@ h@@ m@@ berg ’ s office was not charged with direc@@ ting the grand jury ’ s investigation into per@@ ry .
the latter was led by michael mc@@ cr@@ um , a special prosecu@@ tor from san ant@@ oni@@ o , who was chosen by a republic@@ an judge .
per@@ ry ple@@ ads not guil@@ ty and called the charge a political tr@@ ick .
his high-@@ class team of lawyers applied to the judge charged with the case to reject the charge and argu@@ ed that the law against the most serv@@ ant govern@@ or is being passed in the constitutional state .
per@@ ry stopped $ 7.@@ 5 million of government funds to the public integrity unit of the state - which is based in trav@@ is county and which in cases of state corruption in tex@@ as , step back as a back@@ ward step .
this ve@@ to caused a public compla@@ int from a lef@@ t-@@ wing wat@@ ch@@ dog group .
per@@ ry &apos;s official user account is often updated - and sometimes famous .
after comple@@ ting at the election meetings in i@@ ow@@ a during his presidential candi@@ d@@ acy in 2012 , per@@ ry respon@@ ded to spec@@ ulation that he would stop by taking a t@@ we@@ et of a photo !
ber@@ ke@@ ley once again declared housing market to be &quot; normal &quot; .
one of london &apos;s most prominent buil@@ ders pointed out that the housing market in the south-@@ east of england had returned to normal levels .
home prices in the capital were highly sou@@ gh@@ t-@@ after , and the bank of england , owing to widespread fear of a credit bu@@ b@@ ble , raised the ceiling in june for mort@@ g@@ ages .
ton@@ y pi@@ d@@ g@@ ley , founder and ceo of the high-@@ class construction company ber@@ ke@@ ley said on monday : &quot; since the beginning of the current financial year , the market has returned to normal transaction levels since the peak of 2013 .
the housing market in london was well posi@@ tioned during the down@@ turn , as foreign bu@@ yers pus@@ hed into the capital .
according to the cad@@ a@@ str@@ al office , the city area prices rose by 18@@ .@@ 5 % last year alone , far more than the average increase in england and wal@@ es as a whole .
the average sales prices for ber@@ ke@@ ley ’ s private , cheap , and student offers rose by about one-@@ fifth in the past year , and at the end of april stood at £ 4@@ 23@@ ,000 .
however , a stronger p@@ ound has made property ownership in london less attractive to foreign bu@@ yers in recent months - some of them also been fu@@ elled by the introduction of new property taxes and political rhe@@ tor@@ ic about a possible &quot; tax on the city &quot; before may .
last week , london property bro@@ ker fo@@ x@@ ton war@@ ned that the mort@@ gage market report for april , in which stric@@ ter credit spending rules were presented , would lead to lower mort@@ gage prices in the second half of the year .
new data from the bank of england on monday show a decline in the mort@@ gage authorisation in july , which also indicates that the real estate market is cooling .
h@@ amp@@ tions international , another real estate agency , correc@@ ted its forec@@ ast of the rise in london property prices to 3 % in 20@@ 15 , based on already weak@@ ening house price awareness .
the volume of transactions in the most expensive areas of london , such as ch@@ el@@ sea , may@@ fair and ken@@ sing@@ ton , has now dec@@ lined by a quarter year on year , according to the bro@@ ker wa ell@@ is .
nevertheless , the desire for a home in ber@@ ke@@ ley ’ s capital is a bl@@ essing , as the amounts due for fu@@ tures sales amount to more than £ 2.@@ 2 billion .
mr pi@@ d@@ g@@ ley added : &apos; demand for the right , well-@@ planned product at the best locations remained stable and as a result , sales of the appoin@@ t@@ ments remained stable . &apos;
in june , the company reported that it had sold 3,@@ 7@@ 42 new homes in the year until the end of april - almost a third more than the 2007 peak before the crisis .
annual pre-@@ tax ear@@ nings rose by 40 percent to £ 2@@ 80 million ann@@ ually , and sales rose by 18 percent to £ 1.@@ 6 billion .
in a communication on monday before the company &apos;s annual meeting , mr pi@@ d@@ g@@ ley said that the revenue for ber@@ ke@@ ley is expected to match current market expectations in the current year .
the analy@@ sts agree to the annual pre-@@ tax result of £ 4@@ 50 million .
ber@@ ke@@ ley shares were fixed at £ 2@@ 3.@@ 96 in the afternoon in london .
j@@ enni@@ fer law@@ rence &apos;s na@@ ked photos published by h@@ ack@@ ers on the internet
j@@ enni@@ fer law@@ rence appears at the 8@@ 5th o@@ sc@@ ar award .
na@@ ked photos of the os@@ car@@ -@@ winner j@@ enni@@ fer law@@ rence were published online by a h@@ ack@@ er who claimed to have a &quot; master list &quot; of images of another 100 star@@ lets .
a representative of the star from &quot; pan@@ em &apos;s tribute &quot; confirmed that the photos of law@@ rence are genuine and accused the h@@ ack@@ er for &quot; flag@@ rant violation of privacy &quot; .
the authorities have been notified and will follow all those who post the sto@@ len photos of j@@ enni@@ fer law@@ rence .
the photos originally posted on the photo sharing page 4@@ ch@@ an were reported to be obtained by a gap in the online storage system ic@@ l@@ oud from apple , including the alleg@@ ed &quot; master list &quot; of the ha@@ zz@@ o .
it is not certain how many of the images are real , although win@@ ste@@ ad , star from &quot; scot@@ t pil@@ gri@@ m against the rest of the world &quot; also condemned the h@@ ack on t@@ wit@@ ter .
&quot; to those of you who look at photos taken by my hus@@ band and i in the private environment of our house years ago - i hope you are really satisfied with you , &quot; win@@ ste@@ ad wrote on t@@ wit@@ ter .
victori@@ a justice from nic@@ hol@@ as &apos; ic@@ arly &apos; and &apos; victori@@ ous &apos; , however , resi@@ sts the fact that the photos are pictures of her and are &quot; f@@ ak@@ ed &quot; by n@@ ick@@ he@@ te .
let ’ s just fight back from the beginning .
bu@@ zz@@ feed reported on late sunday that a spo@@ kes@@ man of the pop star ari@@ ana gran@@ de was des@@ cen@@ ding the authentic@@ ity of the supposed photos of it .
exclusive extr@@ act from ho@@ ward jac@@ ob@@ son &apos;s highly p@@ raised new novel about love and the letter &quot; j &quot; .
they dis@@ integrated , so it was best described , they slowly dis@@ solved like a car@@ ton that was left in the rain .
occa@@ sion@@ ally , a woman told him that he was too serious , ex@@ hau@@ sting , intense , di@@ stan@@ ced and perhaps a bit scr@@ at@@ ch@@ y .
and then sha@@ ked his hand .
he knew scr@@ at@@ ch@@ b@@ ür@@ sti@@ g .
he was st@@ uck , as in i@@ gel , yes .
the last victim of this stal@@ em@@ ate was a recent aff@@ air , which had been more promising for alle@@ vi@@ ating the lon@@ ely bo@@ re@@ dom of his life than would otherwise have been , and perhaps even brought some satisfaction to him .
a@@ il@@ in sol@@ om@@ on was a trem@@ bling , ten@@ der beauty with un@@ t@@ amed hair and a fl@@ at@@ tering heart from a village on the north island that was even more remote and r@@ ough than port re@@ fle@@ x .
she had come south with an older compan@@ ion who thought ke@@ ver@@ n to be her a@@ un@@ t , and who had in@@ h@@ eri@@ ted a p@@ lot in a dam@@ p but par@@ adi@@ si@@ ac@@ al valley with the ap@@ t name paradise valley .
for several years no one had lived in the house .
the pi@@ pes were le@@ ak@@ ed , sp@@ id@@ ers were still in the bathrooms , na@@ ked mu@@ gs had left their trac@@ es on all windows and believed that they were all owned and the garden was covered with ro@@ pes .
like the house , it was a kin@@ der@@ m@@ ä@@ r@@ chen , both threat@@ ening and temp@@ ting , a garden full of secre@@ ts .
por@@ tra@@ it of the author : ho@@ ward jac@@ ob@@ son , whose novel &quot; j &quot; on the long@@ list stands for the man boo@@ ker prize 20@@ 14 .
the short@@ list will be announced next week .
he had been sitting with ail@@ in ’ s re@@ tail@@ ers on the broken sun loun@@ gers in the high gr@@ ass and enjoyed an un@@ usually warm spring afternoon , both of whom had a sen@@ sel@@ ess re@@ treat in the cold .
your feet are too big .
due to their aggres@@ si@@ veness , songs of this kind were no longer played on the con@@ sole .
not for@@ bi@@ dden - nothing was really for@@ bi@@ dden - simply not played .
it was successfully ob@@ sole@@ te , just as the word ob@@ sole@@ te .
the general taste created what dec@@ ree and regulations never had done , and how people choose the vo@@ m tell@@ rec@@ it@@ als to the mil@@ li@@ on@@ air@@ e , cooking books , and love nov@@ els .
in the eu@@ ph@@ oria of the day , ke@@ ver@@ n began to play an imag@@ inary piano and sing large feet in a gro@@ b-@@ com@@ ic se@@ ren@@ ade of ail@@ in .
ail@@ in did not understand .
&quot; this was a well-known song by a jazz pi@@ an@@ ist named f@@ ats w@@ all@@ er , &quot; he explained her and automatically put two fing@@ ers on his li@@ ps .
his father had always done that to stop the letter j before he came out of his mouth .
it had begun as a game between him and his father when he was still small .
his father had played it with his own father , so he had told .
if you start a word with a j without putting two fing@@ ers over your li@@ ps , it costs you a pen@@ ny .
it was not a very fun@@ ny game back then , and it was not very fun@@ ny either .
he knew that was expected of him , that was all .
it had to explain what jazz was .
a@@ il@@ inn never heard of anyone .
jazz was not played , even if it was not directly prohibited .
impro@@ vis@@ ation was no longer modern .
it was only room for a single &quot; if &quot; in life .
people wanted to be quite sure at the beginning of a me@@ lo@@ dy where it would end .
so is the mind .
his un@@ predic@@ tability made people ner@@ vous .
and jazz was musi@@ cally expressed .
although he had become ten years old without being heard by sam@@ my dav@@ is junior , ke@@ ver@@ n knew something about jazz from his father &apos;s semi-@@ secret collection of old c@@ ds .
but at least he didn ’ t have to explain to ail@@ in that f@@ ats wh@@ ale was black .
at her age , she probably could not remember a time when pop sing@@ ers were not black .
again , no laws or constra@@ ints .
a con@@ for@@ man@@ t society meant that every element of this society gr@@ aci@@ ously agreed to the principle of group tal@@ ents - grateful as those spa@@ red from dest@@ iny .
people of a@@ fro@@ -@@ caribbean origin were suitable for entertainment and sport through temper@@ ament and body construction , so they san@@ g and ran .
people who originally came from the indian sub@@ continent were , like nature , bl@@ essed with electronic talent , and were guided by the task of ensuring that no family remained without a working phone .
what was left of the polish community was concerned with se@@ wage ; what was left of the gre@@ e@@ ks , tell@@ er bro@@ ke .
those from the gulf states and the lev@@ ante , whose grand@@ parents had not left the country quickly than what had happened if it had happened - out of fear of being accused of fire , even out of fear of being accused of sh@@ ame .
each according to his or her abilities .
as she had only heard b@@ all@@ ads , ail@@ inn had difficulty in understanding how the insul@@ ting words that ke@@ ver@@ n had just sung her , could ever be sp@@ un@@ ned .
music was an expression of love .
&quot; they are not really insul@@ ting , &quot; said ke@@ ver@@ n .
except perhaps for people whose feet are too big .
my father never insul@@ ted anyone , but he loved this song .
he talked too much , but the negl@@ ected garden gave him the dec@@ ep@@ tive feeling of security .
nothing could be done to overcome the sound of the huge co@@ al-@@ like leaves .
ail@@ in still did not understand .
why should your father have loved such a thing ?
he wanted to say that it was a ju@@ x , but hesit@@ ated to put two fing@@ ers on the li@@ ps in their present .
she thought that he was a bit strange anyway .
&quot; he seemed am@@ using , &quot; he said instead .
she sha@@ ken her head un@@ beli@@ e@@ ve@@ fully and closed down on the face of the river .
there was nothing else to see anywhere in the world than their un@@ re@@ d-@@ colo@@ red ra@@ ven@@ -@@ black hair .
there was nothing he would have w@@ ished to see .
&quot; when you say it , &quot; mean it without convic@@ tion .
but that doesn &apos;t explain why you want it to me .
they seemed to be frank@@ ly concerned .
are my feet too big ?
he looked again .
your feet so directly not .
maybe your an@@ k@@ les , a little bit ...
and you say you ha@@ ted me because my an@@ k@@ les are too th@@ ick ?
h@@ ate you ?
of course i do not h@@ ate you .
that is just the st@@ up@@ id song .
he could have said &quot; i love you &quot; , but it was too early for that .
&quot; your th@@ ick an@@ k@@ les are the very reason you like me , &quot; he tried to do it instead .
i am a bit per@@ verse here .
that was not right .
it should have been fun@@ ny .
when he tried to be fun@@ ny , he often got into trouble because , like his father , he did not have the cal@@ ming charm needed to make the jo@@ kes in@@ he@@ rent cru@@ el@@ ty .
perhaps his father also wanted to be cru@@ el .
perhaps he wanted to be , ke@@ ver@@ n , that .
despite his friendly eyes .
a@@ il@@ in sol@@ om@@ on became red and rose from her dec@@ k chair , thre@@ w the con@@ sole around and sp@@ illed the wine they had d@@ rank .
the wine of the wood blo@@ om , so dr@@ un@@ ken@@ ness was no exc@@ use for him .
in their ex@@ ci@@ tement they seemed to trem@@ ble , as pal@@ m@@ we@@ del in stor@@ m .
&quot; and your th@@ ick head is precisely the reason why i feel drawn to you per@@ ver@@ sely , &quot; she said ...
except that i am not at all .
she was sorry , both for the unnecessary un@@ kin@@ dness of his words and for the fear that appeared in her eyes when she re@@ bel@@ led against him .
did she think he would beat them ?
she had not told him about life on the cold northern archi@@ pel@@ ago , where she had grown up , but he had no doubt that it was essentially the same as here .
the same huge and ic@@ y ocean bro@@ ke down here as there on the sho@@ res .
the same conf@@ used men , with even th@@ ick@@ er skin and more in@@ fur@@ i@@ ated by what had happened when their an@@ ce@@ st@@ ors had been a s@@ mu@@ gg@@ ler and be@@ ach@@ rob@@ ber , were still willing to raise by pu@@ pp@@ ies .
th@@ ick head ?
they would have shown her a big f@@ ist if she did not take care !
they are the most commonly used word for ero@@ tic appeal between men and women , and they are the counter@@ -@@ po@@ ison to the non-@@ s@@ ca@@ thing lo@@ ving ones - they are the ones who beat the con@@ sol@@ es .
in ke@@ ver@@ n ’ s view , this was unnecessary re@@ fin@@ ement , as the cr@@ ut@@ ch itself was an act of violence .
a@@ ail@@ in sol@@ om@@ on gave him a sign to go through his body .
he rose from the dec@@ k like an old man .
she also felt ble@@ ached , but the strength of his gri@@ ef surprised her .
that was not the end of the world .
they were hardly aware of it .
she looked at him as he di@@ stan@@ ced himself - as she saw her compan@@ ion from a room on the upper floor - a man compla@@ ined about something he had raised .
ad@@ am leaves the garden , thought she .
she felt a su@@ dden pain for him and men in general , although some had raised their hands against them .
a man turned off her , his back pra@@ yed , sh@@ amed , defe@@ ated , without a fighting spirit - why was this a sight that she seemed to know well before , if she could not remember such a thing ?
when she was alone again , ail@@ in sol@@ om@@ on looked at her feet .
several years before the events just told , es@@ me n@@ us@@ s@@ bau@@ m worked , an intelligent and enthusi@@ astic 3@@ 2-@@ year-@@ old resear@@ cher on behalf of of@@ now , the non-@@ legislative monitoring body for short , expected to be spent on the government .
&quot; much has been done , and much still needs to be done , &quot; she wrote , &quot; to appe@@ ase the in@@ n@@ ate aggres@@ si@@ veness of a people who has led a thousand wars and won most of them , especially in the per@@ ceived s@@ wee@@ ten@@ ing lands .
but some properties turn out to be in@@ ex@@ or@@ able .
the higher the church tower , it seems , the lower the passion that it continues to ar@@ ou@@ se .
the population cr@@ ying in listening to s@@ enti@@ mental b@@ all@@ ads , r@@ ash@@ ing in stories about over@@ w@@ ound difficulties , claim@@ ing to believe firmly in the virtu@@ es of marriage and family life , but still holding back the former hand not only .
&quot; you have an unfortunate tend@@ ency to ex@@ ag@@ ger@@ ate , &quot; your ment@@ or said when he read the whole report .
i suggest you read fewer nov@@ els .
es@@ me n@@ us@@ s@@ bau@@ m lo@@ wered her head .
i must also ask : are you a@@ the@@ ist ?
&quot; i do not need to say that , &quot; said es@@ me n@@ us@@ s@@ bau@@ m .
are they les@@ bian ?
once again es@@ me referred to her right to privacy and ref@@ usal of statement .
fem@@ in@@ ist ?
silence again .
&quot; i don &apos;t ask this , &quot; said lu@@ ther r@@ ab@@ in@@ o@@ wit@@ z , &quot; because i am against a@@ the@@ ism , les@@ bian or fem@@ in@@ ism .
this is a pre@@ jud@@ ice free job .
we are serving a society free of pre@@ jud@@ ice .
but certain kinds of hyper@@ sensi@@ tivity , which are in themselves absolutely acceptable and comm@@ end@@ able , can occa@@ sion@@ ally distor@@ t the results they have presented .
they themselves seem to have pre@@ jud@@ ices against the church , and these things , which they call &apos; under@@ hand &apos; and &apos; raw &apos; , could just as well be interpreted by others as an expression of natural strength and vit@@ ality .
if we continue to ride around what happened , if it happened , as if it had happened yesterday , we will be depri@@ ving the country of its essential vit@@ ality .
es@@ me n@@ us@@ s@@ bau@@ m looked around while r@@ ab@@ in@@ o@@ wit@@ z spoke .
behind his head , an led letter in fl@@ am@@ ing@@ or@@ os@@ a repeated the advice that of@@ now had given the country in the last quar@@ ter-@@ century or longer .
sm@@ ile on your neighb@@ ors , value your partner , listen to b@@ all@@ ads , visit musi@@ c@@ als , use your phone , talk , listen , agree , exc@@ use .
speaking is better than silence , the vo@@ cal word is better than the written word , but nothing is better than love .
&quot; i understand absolutely what you want to go to , &quot; es@@ me n@@ us@@ s@@ bau@@ m rep@@ lied with a quiet voice when she was sure that her superi@@ ors had finished , &quot; and i say nothing else than that we are heal@@ ed .
my concern is that , without warning , we may find ourselves re@@ member@@ ing how we are repe@@ ating the mistakes that only happened once they had happened .
this time , however , it is not the others who leave us out of an@@ ger and mi@@ str@@ ust .
lu@@ ther r@@ ab@@ in@@ o@@ wit@@ z formed a py@@ ram@@ id with his hands .
to indicate an ang@@ els pati@@ ence .
&quot; they go too far , &quot; he said , &quot; if they call acts &apos; errors &apos; which our grand@@ parents may or may not have committed .
they are also going too far when they say that they have left out their an@@ ger and their mi@@ str@@ ust of others .
it should not be necessary to remind someone in their position that , in understanding the past as in protecting the present , we are talking about &apos; us &apos; and &apos; others &apos; .
there was no &quot; we &quot; and there was no &quot; other &quot; .
it was a time of dis@@ order , that is all we know .
&quot; from that , if we are honest with ourselves , &quot; dar@@ ing to throw es@@ me , &quot; no part of society can claim to have beha@@ ved well .
i do not compla@@ in to anyone .
whether it was done badly or well , what happened has happened .
that was then .
there is no need to say anything more about this - we agree on that .
and just as no blame must be assigned , no guil@@ t must be re@@ paid if such re@@ payment is appropriate and if there is a way to re@@ pay it .
but what is the purpose of the past if we do not learn from it -
the past is used to make us forget it .
if i may say something on this subject -
lu@@ ther r@@ ab@@ in@@ o@@ wit@@ z had his py@@ ram@@ id collap@@ sed .
&apos;@@ i will keep your report in mind , &apos; he said and released it .
the next day , as she went to work as usual , she was over@@ run by a motor@@ cy@@ c@@ list who , as pas@@ ser@@ s-@@ by described , had taken to the foot@@ steps in a kind of brut@@ al r@@ age .

les@@ o@@ th@@ o ’ s military member says that no cou@@ p d ’ é@@ t@@ at is planned ; prime minister remains in south africa
military officials in les@@ o@@ th@@ o argu@@ ed that a cou@@ p d &apos;@@ é@@ t@@ at was planned to over@@ throw the government and said that they were taking action against polic@@ em@@ en accused of armed political fan@@ a@@ tics .
prime minister thomas th@@ ab@@ ane f@@ led the country and announced that the country ’ s army had en@@ cir@@ c@@ led his dom@@ ic@@ ile and occupied government buildings in the capital of mas@@ er@@ u .
the premier brought his family to ad@@ jac@@ ent south africa after he reported attacks .
military spo@@ kes@@ man major n@@ te@@ le@@ le n@@ to@@ i said that there is in fact no cou@@ p d &apos;@@ é@@ t@@ at , but that the military is respon@@ ding to the threat of &quot; political fan@@ a@@ tics &quot; by police , whose military presence .
&quot; what happened this morning was that the staff of the defense forces of les@@ o@@ th@@ o acted , after receiving several intelligence reports , that within the police some elements were actually doing damage to some of the political , party political fan@@ ice wanted to touch .
south african leader cla@@ y@@ son mon@@ y@@ ela said that military action was under the impression of a over@@ throw .
&quot; although no one has claimed to have tor@@ n the government by force , all the reports agree that les@@ o@@ th@@ o &apos;s defense forces &apos; activities have so far been indic@@ ative of a cou@@ p d &apos;@@ é@@ t@@ at , &quot; he said .
spo@@ kes@@ men of the military of les@@ o@@ th@@ o announced on sunday that the soldiers were drag@@ ging their bar@@ r@@ acks and that the situation in the capital was calm .
in the meantime , vice premier mo@@ the@@ t@@ jo@@ ya me@@ tering takes over the leadership of th@@ ab@@ an@@ es ’ absence .
th@@ ab@@ ane announced that he believed he had become the target for his attempt to fight corruption in the country .
les@@ o@@ th@@ o has been in great tension since june , after the dis@@ ru@@ ption of th@@ ab@@ ane parliamentary meetings due to the cl@@ ash@@ es in his unity government .
he said that his actions had not under@@ min@@ ed the government , despite different acc@@ us@@ ations .
eurozone production on 13 months low
the rise in production in the eurozone slow@@ ed in august to the lowest point in the last 13 months , according to a closely observed study .
the final lab@@ el@@ ed shopping index of the manufacturing industry ( p@@ mi ) fell to 5@@ 0.@@ 7 in august , after a bo@@ oth of 5@@ 1.@@ 8 in july .
an indication of 50 indicates an expansion .
new orders were coming back and fac@@ tories were experiencing bur@@ sts in a period of rising tension between the eu and russia over ukraine .
the figures arrive before the european central bank ( ecb ) meeting on thursday .
markets expect the bank to provide a clear plan for dealing with a re@@ luc@@ t@@ ant eurozone recovery , and for the im@@ minent threat of de@@ fl@@ ation at an inflation rate of only 0.@@ 3 % .
there is spec@@ ulation that the ecb head , mari@@ o drag@@ hi , could provide further information this week whether he is considering quanti@@ tative eas@@ ing for the eurozone , in line with the united states ’ financial crisis .
&quot; although small growth is better than no growth , the slow@@ ing effects of rising economic and geo@@ political un@@ certain@@ ties have become clearer for manufacturers , &quot; said ro@@ b do@@ b@@ son , chief econom@@ ist at mark@@ t .
the factory p@@ mi for germany , russia &apos;s largest trading partner in the eu , fell to its lowest level in 11 months with 5@@ 1.@@ 4 .
in the meantime , the p@@ mi fell to 4@@ 6.@@ 9 in the second largest economy of the block , france .
france remains a trou@@ b@@ led child , as does italy ’ s decline from solid expansion to stag@@ nation .
references to the fact that growth incentives in the key industry mechanism germany and spain and the netherlands no longer apply are also un@@ satisfactory , &quot; said mr do@@ b@@ son .
the industry ’ s decline is likely to fuel analy@@ sts ’ fire , which exp@@ ects further monetary or fiscal stimul@@ us .
a positive news came from the republic of ireland , where the p@@ mi increased to 5@@ 7.@@ 3 , the highest level since the end of 1999 .
according to ho@@ ward ar@@ cher , chief economic expert at i@@ h@@ s global insight , &quot; the best that can be said for the purchasing management index of manufacturing businesses that gro@@ ws in the eurozone from august is still that sector .
he added : &quot; eurozone producers seem to find life quite difficult at the moment , as the current hei@@ ghten@@ ed geo@@ political ten@@ sions - particularly in relation to russia and ukraine - increase un@@ certain@@ ties in the still difficult conditions in many countries .
these increased un@@ certain@@ ties have clearly affected the economy - in particular , and consumer confidence , and pre@@ sum@@ ably lead to some orders being dela@@ yed or even cancelled , particularly large contracts .
he said that it would &apos; increasingly likely &apos; that the ecb would eventually have to initi@@ ate some sort of q@@ e , &apos; although we susp@@ ect that this will be limited &apos; .
the hel@@ l decade of bes@@ lan survi@@ v@@ ors : ten years have passed since the d@@ read@@ ful sie@@ ge of school , as the children involved still suffer today .
ten years ago , over 1@@ ,000 people were taken ho@@ stage by chec@@ hen mil@@ i@@ ti@@ as at a school in bes@@ lan in southern russia .
more than 3@@ 30 people , more than half of them children , were killed in the three-@@ day mar@@ ty@@ r@@ dom that sho@@ c@@ ked the world .
we returned to bes@@ lan to find some of the victims who had es@@ cap@@ ed the death of the at@@ ro@@ cities in the class@@ room .
exactly a decade after the app@@ alling sie@@ ge of bes@@ lan school , which killed 3@@ 34 people , including 18@@ 6 children , the her@@ o@@ ic survi@@ v@@ ors war@@ ned last night of a new apo@@ c@@ aly@@ pse in ukraine .
when fan@@ a@@ tical islam@@ ist terrorists cap@@ tured and killed children and parents on 1 september 2004 , the beginning of a new school year , it seemed like the evil one .
the tragedy united west and east in ab@@ hor@@ rence , and then surpris@@ ingly turned into action and hope for the future in the mid@@ st of the worst mis@@ ery .
ten years later , we returned to bes@@ lan to find some of the victims who had es@@ cap@@ ed the death of the at@@ ro@@ cities in the class@@ room .
we found surprising young people who have overcome resistance , although the memory of this terrorist hel@@ l will keep them in mind fore@@ ver .
your greatest hope ?
that the war that is now w@@ re@@ aking ukraine - and in which children like them die - is now coming to an end .
the girl who was photograph@@ ed trying to clim@@ b back into the sh@@ at@@ tered school sports hall
she was photograph@@ ed by russian star photograph@@ er di@@ mit@@ ri beli@@ ak@@ ov and famous when she only tried to get back into the sh@@ at@@ tered school sports hall in her under@@ wear , after a mine explo@@ ded .
completely conf@@ used , a@@ id@@ a was looking for her mother , lar@@ is@@ sa , now 40 years old .
both were thought to be dead , but they survi@@ ved .
&quot; a woman told me i should run for my life , but i could not , &quot; said a@@ id@@ a then .
my leg@@ s were bloo@@ d@@ ily over@@ flow@@ ing .
i stood up and clim@@ bed back in to search for my mother .
a soldi@@ er brought them to safety .
after a series of operations , she thought she was completely cu@@ red , but said yesterday : &quot; three months ago , the pain returned .
i am afraid i have to be operated on again .
some sh@@ ards are still in my k@@ ne@@ es .
her goal is to become a d@@ enti@@ st to help people , as she was helped by doctors .
&quot; this tragedy changed my life , but it did not break me , &quot; she says fighting .
&quot; that happened to me , and it cannot be changed .
once a year i go to the sports hall to remember the people who stayed there .
my friends and i try not to talk about it on other days .
the pain is too great .
my best friend and future class@@ m@@ ate d@@ zer@@ a ga@@ po@@ eva was killed there .
we played together when we were small and dre@@ amed of going to school together .
&quot; i don &apos;t want to mar@@ ry until i finish my studies and start my career .
i am thinking of a family later .
she says that the sie@@ ge will always remain part of her , although the memory is getting slightly weak@@ er every year .
i am glad that many people around the world still remember our hor@@ r@@ ors and we are so grateful for the help we received from people in britain and everywhere .
when i see online the photo of me climbing back to school , i think that for the first time many people see it , understand our catastro@@ ph@@ e and help to prevent such a thing from happening again .
the boy who fle@@ w through the ball h@@ ack , believ@@ ing that his mother was dead
it was his first day of school ( rus@@ sians go to school at 7 years ) and survi@@ ved the three-@@ day sie@@ ge in the poor of his mother tam@@ ara .
when he was seven years old , he said : &apos; m@@ ama told me i should lie down if there were an explo@@ sion and hold your hand &apos; .
after an explo@@ sion , he thought she would die .
she said to him : &apos; run . &apos;
fe@@ aring that she could be dead , he f@@ led and saw a we@@ eping inf@@ ant on the way , gr@@ ab@@ bed it with her hand and f@@ led through a ball h@@ ack .
his father v@@ la@@ di@@ mir , who had his son in the arms out , said : &quot; dam@@ ir told me that his mother had died .
he said : &apos; i could not save them &apos; .
in reality , tam@@ ara had st@@ um@@ b@@ led outside and with le@@ g in@@ jur@@ ies in hospital , in turn , in the belief that her son had died .
after re@@ unification she said : &quot; i cr@@ ying for joy .
i could not believe it .
he ran in and embr@@ ac@@ ed me .
dam@@ ir was later flo@@ wn to london ( from the meanwhile dis@@ solved newspaper news of the world ) to receive the title of a bar@@ nar@@ do &apos;s child from the then prime minister ton@@ y bla@@ ir and his wife ch@@ eri@@ e .
&quot; this hor@@ ror is watching you every day , but i wish i could stop re@@ member@@ ing , &quot; he said yesterday .
but i can say that it will be pal@@ e in my memory .
i still know that i thre@@ w all my to@@ y gun away immediately after that .
but now i can play computer games with sho@@ oting scenes and that &apos;s no problem for me .
&quot; i am not afraid to go back to the sports hall , but i don &apos;t think about myself .
i remember those children with whom i played in the court , who did not make it out .
we never say they have been killed or dead .
we say that they have stayed in the sports hall .
i remember very well my trip to london , especially the to@@ ys shop , where i could choose everything i wanted and drive in an open car above .
but now he is afraid of a place like ukraine , where wars cause the kind of mis@@ fortun@@ e he and his friends suffered .
this hor@@ ror is watching you every day , but i wish i could stop re@@ member@@ ing it .
&quot; i am so sorry for all those who suffer from the ab@@ om@@ inations , &quot; said dam@@ ir , who worked as a volunte@@ er in a monaster@@ y last week .
i am so happy to help .
i will one day go to the police and hope that you will take me to the training academy next year .
his mother tam@@ ara , 48 , said : &quot; 37 children from our neighbourhood were killed , can you imagine that ?
i remember the terrible silence after the sie@@ ge , there were simply no children who could sh@@ out and walk around , and this silence las@@ ted many months .
she is vi@@ vi@@ dly remin@@ is@@ cent of her trip to london with dam@@ ir .
the people of london we@@ pt when i told our story .
i understood then how people on the other side of the world can understand our feel@@ ings and show their support .
she was grateful to ch@@ eri@@ e bla@@ ir and her foundation for the prize and the opportunity to travel to london in autumn 2004 .
i wish i could call ch@@ eri@@ e and tell her myself that 10 years have passed , but i still remember the meeting her and her hus@@ band in london , and how the dam@@ ir and me helped .
i remember dam@@ ir wanted to eat bor@@ sch@@ ts@@ ch and called them all local russian restaurants .
i remember playing with wai@@ st@@ co@@ ats in a restaurant , dam@@ ir shot her and she ran away and played with him .
and that was just one month after the hor@@ ror .
i was surprised that the british were so willing to share our pain and support us .
she said , &quot; i always think that this world has not improved in these 10 years .
in ukraine , war is now continuing , and people are dying every day , and i believe that many children have been killed and are still being killed .
these are just children like ours .
i think that for many , the war is part of the news they hear when they are bo@@ red or busy with something else .
i just know what these people feel , all the hor@@ ror .
and i cannot stop feeling that .
nothing has changed , people still want to kill each other and that is so sad .
dam@@ ir was big and is a very gent@@ le and quiet boy , he is not aggres@@ sive or an@@ gr@@ y at all .
for example , he is not looking for reven@@ ge , he is not overwhel@@ med by the past ab@@ om@@ inations .
i know he does not like to remember , but he has six close friends from the class and they occa@@ sion@@ ally go to the sports hall and lit c@@ and@@ les there .
when he was smaller , he suffered - i remember he sometimes put his face on the sof@@ a , si@@ de@@ lined from us , for hours .
not sle@@ eping , his eyes were open .
i remember him continuing to war@@ n all his weapons and other military to@@ ys , and dam@@ ir is now 17 , bigger than me , looking good , intelligent and healthy .
i can hardly believe that for a few hours i was so sure that he was dead and i would never see him again .
when i reco@@ vered after the explo@@ sion and got on my feet , i looked around and saw hel@@ l around me , with body parts surrounding all the place .
i was absolutely sure that my little boy could not survive in this hel@@ l .
&quot; i remember that i called him , &quot; dam@@ ir , run away , run away &quot; , but i was also so sure that he had not heard me .
but he heard it and he went away .
and thus life , unlike that of many others , continues for us .
geor@@ gi@@ j il@@ y@@ in , 17
the boy whose terrible image after the sie@@ ge became the symbol of bes@@ lan ’ s ab@@ om@@ ination .
con@@ sol@@ ation : the bes@@ lan survi@@ v@@ or geor@@ gi@@ j ly@@ in with his mother fa@@ tim@@ a after the sie@@ ge in 2004 , on the right a picture of geor@@ gi@@ j today , a picture of geor@@ gi@@ j .
his bloo@@ d-@@ filled face was s@@ ca@@ red when he ran for his life , while chec@@ hen terrorists sho@@ wered his class@@ mates .
his image was one of the most sho@@ cking symb@@ ols of bes@@ lan &apos;s bar@@ bar@@ ism .
his mother fa@@ tim@@ a , 54 , a doctor , had taken him to school for his first day before she rus@@ hed to bring her older son v@@ la@@ di@@ mir to university .
&quot; i left the court about two minutes before the terrorists stor@@ med it , and so my little boy remained alone for three terrible days , &quot; she re@@ members .
not entirely alone , there was a whole family of rela@@ tives of us , but they were all killed .
only my geor@@ gi@@ j managed to survive .
the closer this date gets , the har@@ der it is to think about it and talk about it .
there is not a single day when we do not remember this tragedy .
we do not think it has been a long time ago , i think it would have happened yesterday , some of the scenes from these days are watching me fore@@ ver .
nobody will ever forget that , i promise you .
im@@ pen@@ etr@@ able : the image of geor@@ gi@@ j ( left ) was one of the most sho@@ cking of the attack and was im@@ mort@@ alized as a stat@@ ue ( right ) .
i remember that geor@@ gi@@ j wanted to go to school on that day , saying he wanted to hu@@ g his teacher .
i knew he was alive when i saw him on television .
and now there is even this stat@@ ue of the cr@@ ying geor@@ gi@@ j in san mar@@ ino .
geor@@ gi@@ j does not like the picture and it is hidden in the book@@ shel@@ f at home .
i understand that , but i also think that , thanks to this picture , people all over the world feel our pain .
geor@@ gi@@ j says today : &quot; it is important that this sort of thing never happens again .
&quot; i doubt that we will ever know the truth .
people constantly investigate such trag@@ e@@ dies and never learn the truth .
and now you are investig@@ ating the cr@@ ash of this bo@@ eing in ukraine .
will we ever know what caused it ?
this world is becoming something terrible .
&quot; i cannot understand how this is possible , because when you ask people , no one wants a war , so how is it done ?
ten years is nothing at all at all at all at this pain .
we need do@@ z@@ ens of years to forget it a little .
it has att@@ acked my health and i still feel it .
for about three or four years i had a few night@@ ma@@ res because of the sie@@ ge , but then it was better .
i went to school later in 2004 and fe@@ ared every day .
i thought of my friends and class@@ mates who had been killed .
that is why i always go to the sports hall when the first of september approaches .
i want to pay tribute to my old child@@ hood friends .
it is difficult for me to go into the sports hall , but i have to do it .
i do not feel myself a victim ; this story is now part of my past .
i will not forget it , but i do not regret it .
my life goes on .
i finished school this year and i am visiting a medical university in v@@ la@@ di@@ ka@@ z .
i will be a heart sur@@ ge@@ on .
my first choice was an army training .
i wanted to become a soldi@@ er , but my health did not allow it .
i wanted to fight for my country , but that will not happen .
geor@@ gi@@ j f@@ ani@@ ye@@ v , 20
the boy who survi@@ ved , although caught at the foot of a mur@@ der@@ ous terrorist .
a mir@@ acle : geor@@ gi@@ j f@@ ani@@ ye@@ v was caught in the sie@@ ge to the feet of a mur@@ der@@ ous terrorist , but he managed to survive .
during the sie@@ ge , he was imprison@@ ed in the sports hall and sat next to the bom@@ b that was attached to a mur@@ der@@ ous terrorist .
it is a real mir@@ acle that he was not killed .
&quot; we feel it was as if it had been yesterday , &quot; says geor@@ gi@@ j , who wanted to go to the f@@ s@@ b as intelligence officer , but could not do so because of his health damage caused by the sie@@ ge .
it is still with me , it is not something i left behind .
i am now older and people are saying that children can easily deal with bad experiences - i have to say that this is not true .
&quot; in 2006 i worked with psycho@@ logi@@ sts and felt a bit better after that , but i can &apos;t forget it .
and i would like to forget .
2005 - the year after - was the first and only time i went back to the sports hall .
i lost consci@@ ousness .
i will never go back there again and please do not ask me to show you where i sat in this famous picture .
survi@@ v@@ ors : geor@@ gi@@ j f@@ ani@@ ye@@ v today , with a photo of himself in hospital after the sie@@ ge on the lap@@ top
my pain is mon@@ strous and i wear it every day with me .
my friends know that i don &apos;t like to think about it or speak about it and they never asked me for school .
i am physi@@ cally well off .
i should be careful with my w@@ oun@@ ded k@@ ne@@ e , but i can now run well .
but because of my health i could not study as i wanted at the f@@ s@@ b &apos;s secret service academy in st. pe@@ ter@@ sburg .
i have sent my documents , including the medical ones , and you have rep@@ lied that it is not possible .
my second passion was the animals , so i went to the veter@@ inary institute .
i have already spent two years there .
he lear@@ ns the treatment of all animals &quot; from c@@ ats to co@@ ws &quot; .
he said : &quot; i knew i would never tell my children about my experiences .
children should not know about this and they should not , of course , suffer it either .
his mother marina , 42 , said : &quot; this pain never leaves me .
it is in my soul , worse when the anniversary approaches .
i will go to the celebra@@ tions to comm@@ em@@ or@@ ate .
i know that geor@@ gi@@ j will not go .
it must be much more violent for him because he was there and i did not .
i wa@@ ited at home to him and could not help .
i am so grateful to god that he was returned to me , here in bes@@ lan all of them are drawn .
it remains within us .
geor@@ gi@@ j is now an adult , but this hor@@ ror is still in him .
it is difficult to accept that when something is so unfair to you .
he is a boy , he li@@ kes sport , but he cannot take part because of his k@@ ne@@ es .
he has been operated on several times , he can run but he cannot do sport .
i would say that he has overcome the hor@@ ror by 50 % , but you can never completely over@@ look it and forget it .
this terrible experience will always follow us .
many friends and neighbours were killed during the sie@@ ge and this only increases my pain .
i lost many people i knew well and who were expensive .
my son is with me , and this is the greatest gift that god could make me , but my heart cr@@ ying for the killed .
i know of families where new children were born , but also of wi@@ do@@ ws who have never married again .
it is difficult to accept that life goes on , even if you do not want it .
i will never forget how my heart sp@@ ran@@ g in me when i saw him in the hospital .
and now i see what is happening in the world - wars in other regions .
what are these people fighting for ?
why are they killing each other ?
the war is now very close to our country and i can hardly believe it .
we used to be a friendly country , how can it be that we are fighting now ?
people and children are suffering , i am sure that many children have already been killed in ukraine and many more are still being killed .
if we could only gr@@ as@@ p and throw all these re@@ be@@ ls out , as far away as possible .

4 tips for better under@@ water photos and videos
if you like to take photos or videos under water , there is a selection of devices .
the che@@ apest option is a water@@ tight poin@@ t-@@ and-@@ sho@@ ot , such as the ni@@ kon cool@@ pi@@ x aw@@ 120 or an action c@@ am like the g@@ op@@ ro her@@ o@@ 3 + silver edition for both $ 300 and $ 300 .
i took these photos at a family party with several cameras , all available at a price below $ 3@@ 50 .
regardless of the equipment , there are some rules for the best results .
check your equipment twice .
even if you have a water@@ proof camera , make sure that the battery com@@ part@@ ment and other com@@ part@@ ments are closed se@@ aled .
also , put your camera on the photos or videos you want to record .
some cameras and cam@@ cor@@ ders have scene modes and recording modes to optimi@@ ze exposure time for the d@@ amp@@ ened under@@ water conditions .
and before you jum@@ p into it , check to what depth your equipment is functional .
some cameras are only allowed for 5 feet , others 50 or 60 feet .
search our shopping guide and reviews for digital cameras for conventional and water@@ proof models .
take multiple sho@@ ts - because many will not work .
poin@@ t-@@ and-@@ sho@@ ot cameras have an l@@ cd to com@@ pose images , action cam@@ s usually do not .
even if you have an l@@ cd , it is difficult to watch it under water , and the correct image setting is a matter of lu@@ ck .
so you take a lot of pictures .
if your camera has a row mode that lets you take a series of sho@@ ts with slightly different exposure settings , use it .
stay close to the surface .
the light becomes dram@@ atically worse as it moves away from the surface .
if possible , they will stay close to the surface when taking pictures in a pool , a lake or the sea .
this will also allow you to bring more color to your photos ; the de@@ eper you go , the less color you will see .
go close to the objects .
this is also good advice on land , but it is all the more important under water because of the poor lighting conditions .
it is particularly important to work with an action c@@ am : these devices often have a fixed wide@@ -@@ angle lens , which means that you have to att@@ ach more den@@ sity to your objects if they are to fill the entire frame .
andre@@ w law@@ son was a man of the variety whose character changed things , even in a gi@@ gan@@ tic organization like the n@@ h@@ s .
as an an@@ aes@@ thetic consult@@ ant , he devoted his career to the task of saving the si@@ ck both the ag@@ ony of the disease and the tor@@ ment of treatment .
among his patients , his wife re@@ members , was a mi@@ 6 employee who had to live with the dev@@ ast@@ ating effects of torture .
law@@ son knew that doctors care about diagno@@ sis and disease , while the treated are pre@@ domin@@ antly occupied with something quite different : pain .
one day in 2007 , however , he was the one whose path of passion began .
&quot; i didn &apos;t feel , &quot; he wrote in may this year .
i had difficulty getting up .
while fighting the fl@@ u like symp@@ t@@ oms , he noticed that he was im@@ patient in acc@@ us@@ ations of his wife ju@@ li@@ et .
&quot; i want everything immediately rather than later , &quot; he noted .
when ju@@ li@@ et was on a business trip for a week , law@@ son felt un@@ usually and without reason wor@@ ried .
something was in the air .
he asked a colleague to carry out an x-@@ ray investigation of his bre@@ ast .
only two weeks ago he was skiing in the french alps .
the result of the x-@@ ray investigation was available .
he suffered from mes@@ o@@ the@@ li@@ om , an incur@@ able cancer that attacks the ch@@ est fur , that is , the skin that over@@ la@@ ps the lun@@ gs .
as with most can@@ c@@ ers , the exact cause is usually difficult to determine .
for example , while some smo@@ kers are ill from l@@ ung cancer , not all l@@ ung cancer patients have been smo@@ kers in the past .
but mes@@ o@@ the@@ li@@ om is different .
in almost all cases , the tri@@ gger is an as@@ be@@ sto@@ s load - contact with the fi@@ bre material , which was once considered &quot; mir@@ acle material &quot; but has since been recognized as le@@ th@@ al .
for most of us , mes@@ o@@ the@@ li@@ om is a disease that can be ignored as easily as possible .
as@@ be@@ sto@@ s is , after all , a product of the past .
the most dangerous type of as@@ be@@ sto@@ s has not been used in britain since the 196@@ 0s , when industry volun@@ tar@@ ily ple@@ d@@ ged to stop using it .
even where it was still used , only people in certain sectors worked directly with the clo@@ th – pl@@ um@@ ber , construction workers , car@@ pen@@ try workers and shi@@ py@@ ard workers , for example .
as an industrial hazar@@ dous material from a different time , it seems to be hardly worrying today .
but this com@@ plac@@ ency is in@@ appropriate .
britain , it seems , is now experiencing the cli@@ max of a mes@@ ol@@ the@@ li@@ om ep@@ ide@@ mic .
mes@@ o@@ the@@ li@@ om deaths are greater here than any other country in the world .
with a total of 2,@@ 500 deaths per year , twice as many people die from this disease as they do from road accidents .
annual mes@@ o@@ the@@ li@@ um deaths since 1980 and expected future deaths in the uk
the reason we are now experiencing the le@@ th@@ al effects , even though as@@ be@@ sto@@ s has been illegal for years ( all types of as@@ be@@ sto@@ s were banned in 1999 ) is that a mes@@ o@@ the@@ li@@ om only developed after decades .
and the s@@ cour@@ ge of mes@@ o@@ the@@ li@@ om is not con@@ fined to former construction workers .
as@@ be@@ sto@@ s was , and is often still present , in the houses where we live , the offices in which we work , the schools in which we learn and the shops in which we buy .
and therefore mes@@ o@@ the@@ li@@ om knows no class barriers , financial limits , profes@@ sions or age .
the privileged bas@@ tions , from the elegant department stores in london to private schools , are not a shel@@ ter .
parliament &apos;s buildings are as@@ be@@ sto@@ s contam@@ inated .
even in the hospit@@ als where we are supposed to be healthy , we have already been identified as the starting point for this dead@@ ly car@@ cin@@ o@@ gen .
andre@@ w law@@ son was not old .
he was not a pl@@ um@@ ber either .
he was indeed hard to imagine where he might have been in contact with as@@ be@@ sto@@ s .
then he found it out .
&quot; it looks as if there was a lot of as@@ be@@ sto@@ s in the tun@@ nels at the gu@@ y &apos;s hospital , where i was trained for six years . &quot; he wrote .
all - students , nur@@ ses , doctors and par@@ ish men - use the tun@@ nels .
one won@@ ders how many of my con@@ tempor@@ aries will suffer from the same disease ?
unfortunately , he was able to answer this question at least in part .
&quot; of the four doctors trained at the gu@@ y &apos;s hospital and those who have been si@@ ck with mes@@ o@@ the@@ li@@ om@@ a for the last five years , &quot; he wrote in 2010 in a letter , &quot; i am still alive .
how many of us will be ill ?
andre@@ w law@@ son diagno@@ sed mes@@ o@@ the@@ li@@ om@@ a at the age of 48 .
when he died on 17 february this year , he was 55 .
this was an un@@ usually long life@@ time .
fif@@ ty per cent of all mes@@ o@@ the@@ li@@ um characteristics die within 8 months of diagno@@ sis .
the disease always ends in death .
we can therefore only repeat the question of law@@ son : &apos; how many of us will still suffer ? &apos;
britain ’ s leading expert on mes@@ o@@ the@@ li@@ om , professor ju@@ lian pe@@ to , assum@@ es that between 18@@ 70 and 20@@ 50 , if as@@ be@@ sto@@ s ep@@ ide@@ mic is expected to fall victim to a total of 9@@ 0,000 in britain .
most of them do not know at the moment that they will die .

a quick look at the files of the courts , which the people concerned often apply for compensation , shows how widespread the mes@@ o@@ the@@ li@@ om s@@ cour@@ ge is .
in june this year , marks &amp; sp@@ enc@@ er , for example , ad@@ mitted that he had neglig@@ ently exposed jan@@ ice to as@@ be@@ sto@@ s .
she worked for nine years for the chain , from 197@@ 8 to 198@@ 7 , and was responsible for the gar@@ ment department at two locations , one of which was the flag@@ ship store at ox@@ ford street .
m@@ r@@ s. allen was only 18 years when she started her activity at m &amp; s .
now she has two children in the tw@@ en@@ ties .
&quot; before this thing , &quot; she says , &quot; i had never heard of mes@@ o@@ the@@ li@@ om , i did not even know anything about as@@ be@@ sto@@ s yet .
i never thought that would affect me .
there are few people who know a lot about as@@ be@@ sto@@ s .
the fact is that the term as@@ be@@ sto@@ s does not refer to a substance , but rather to a group of six min@@ er@@ als .
the name comes from the word &quot; as@@ be@@ sto@@ sti@@ form &quot; , a description of the fi@@ bre structure , which makes the fab@@ ric resistant and flexible .
three of the six were used in the construction industry .
ch@@ ry@@ so@@ til , also known as white as@@ be@@ sto@@ s , is by far the most common as@@ be@@ sto@@ s found in buildings .
it was used for roof tiles , floor plates , ro@@ h@@ ri@@ -@@ insul@@ ation , bo@@ il@@ ers , even for bra@@ ke p@@ ads in cars .
it is less le@@ th@@ al than other forms of as@@ be@@ sto@@ s , but it is still considered by the eu and the who as a &apos; great health risk &apos; with possible death .
however , the brown as@@ be@@ sto@@ s ( am@@ o@@ sit ) and blue as@@ be@@ sto@@ s ( k@@ ro@@ ky@@ dol@@ ith ) are more dangerous .
britain was once the world &apos;s largest im@@ porter of brown as@@ be@@ sto@@ s , and experts susp@@ ect that &quot; there are clear , but indirect , indic@@ ations that this was a major reason for uni@@ qu@@ ely high mes@@ o@@ the@@ li@@ um rates . &quot;
a member of staff at marks &amp; sp@@ enc@@ er was at the flag@@ ship store in ox@@ ford street , london , as@@ be@@ sto@@ s exposed al@@ am@@ y
jan@@ ice allen may not have seen her@@ self as a typical mes@@ o@@ the@@ li@@ om@@ o victim , but ju@@ lian pe@@ to ’ s work suggests that her story is not unusual .
he has presented a study by those concerned , which states that &apos; a significant proportion of mes@@ o@@ the@@ li@@ om@@ a was caused by work without known suspension or pre@@ sum@@ ably by as@@ be@@ sto@@ s contact in the environment in the home &apos; .
he said that a large part of these contacts is based on the &quot; normal use and aging &quot; of our buildings .
it seems that nobody can assume that they are safe .
a report by go@@ d@@ d@@ ard consulting , which examined the west@@ min@@ ster palace , shows how people , even at the heart of the government , could un@@ kno@@ w@@ ingly have been exposed to the substance .
in 2009 , go@@ d@@ d@@ ard reported that the service sha@@ fts and pipel@@ ines behind parliament &apos;s committee rooms were contam@@ inated with as@@ be@@ sto@@ s , whose le@@ th@@ al fi@@ bers could be caused by something as harm@@ less as &apos; strong air movements &apos; .
members of parliament are often accused of looking after their own interests , but it seems that this is the opposite .
while the director@@ ate of the parliamentary labour service insi@@ sted that the west@@ min@@ ster palace have received a &quot; clean health certificate &quot; , it is now un@@ dispu@@ ted that £ 1 billion of work must be spent several years to remove the general election .
the go@@ d@@ d@@ ard report also pointed out that &apos; the existence of as@@ be@@ sto@@ s was not handled in accordance with the relevant provisions &apos; .
no one can know whether this mis@@ management will cost lives .
all that can be done is wait .
a person who has never been able to determine the contact with as@@ be@@ sto@@ s is gra@@ ham ab@@ bot@@ t , a general practi@@ tion@@ er .
as andre@@ w law@@ son susp@@ ects , the 50@@ -@@ year-@@ old ab@@ bot@@ t is exposed to as@@ be@@ sto@@ s during his work in hospit@@ als .
&quot; i worked in a hospital where as@@ be@@ sto@@ s complaints were made positive , &quot; he says , &quot; but i cannot prove it in my case .
it is so difficult to remember all the places where people worked and the data .
what he still re@@ members is the day at the beginning of december 2009 , when he got a kind of fe@@ ver .
he was 45 and carried out an operation just late in the evening .
suddenly i was sha@@ king .
it suddenly happened .
i felt hor@@ ri@@ ble .
i thought i could no longer make the trip home .
as a doctor , ab@@ bot@@ t knew that the pain ste@@ m@@ med from the ch@@ est fur , the skin around its lun@@ gs .
but like jan@@ ice allen he had no reason to susp@@ ect a mes@@ o@@ the@@ li@@ om .
he did not go to work for a month .
ast@@ on@@ ished doctors took x-@@ ray pictures of his bre@@ ast and use ple@@ ur@@ a@@ ka@@ the@@ ther to extr@@ act flu@@ id from the lun@@ gs and test it in the laboratory .
his complaints , however , remained un@@ diagno@@ sed .
his health improved slowly , and he returned to his job .
from time to time , however , the symp@@ t@@ oms returned , often after exercise and intense bre@@ a@@ thing .
in 2011 , a patient came ab@@ bot@@ ts with similar symp@@ t@@ oms in his practice and was later diagno@@ sed with mes@@ o@@ the@@ li@@ om .
but even now , ab@@ bot@@ t did not link this with his own case .
after all , his patient was several decades older and had worked directly with as@@ be@@ sto@@ s .
the link in that case was clear .
in september 2011 , ab@@ bot@@ t ’ s state deterior@@ ated again , and his family doctor brought his c@@ t sc@@ ans and x-@@ ray rec@@ ord@@ ings to a group of experts .
in december 2011 , exactly two years after ab@@ bot@@ t first felt si@@ ck , a pro@@ be equipped with a camera was introduced into the ca@@ ve between the ri@@ b and the ch@@ est fur .
i am an optim@@ ist .
i usually carry on , &quot; he says .
frank@@ ly , i had not been so concerned .
but rac@@ hel , my wife , was concerned .
the bi@@ op@@ sy was produced in the week between christmas and new year : &quot; i was told it was mes@@ o@@ the@@ li@@ om . &quot;
gra@@ ham ab@@ bot@@ t : mes@@ o@@ the@@ li@@ om diagno@@ sis
suddenly , ab@@ bot@@ t had appoin@@ t@@ ments with mac@@ mill@@ an nur@@ ses , one of whom recommended that he take a law@@ yer .
only now did he see the scale of the ep@@ ide@@ mic .
&quot; as@@ be@@ sto@@ s was found to be very common , especially in large public buildings where pi@@ pes were often isolated with as@@ be@@ sto@@ s , &quot; he says .
the people who were exposed to as@@ be@@ sto@@ s in these buildings are now suffering .
and so mes@@ o@@ the@@ li@@ om now meets younger people who have not worked in the typical profes@@ sions .
the most dangerous tu@@ bes with as@@ be@@ sto@@ s insul@@ ation in hospit@@ als were underground , so patients probably were not exposed to the substance .
but many of the employees who swit@@ ched from one building to another in pede@@ strian tun@@ nels ( such as andre@@ w law@@ son ) or into underground can@@ te@@ ens ( as gra@@ ham ab@@ bot@@ t often did ) were most likely to contact with .
it is evident that , over several decades after the war , hospit@@ als were potentially life@@ -@@ saving for patients , but life@@ -@@ threat@@ ening for the doctors concerned .
it is still being removed today .
students dis@@ posed of their bun@@ s@@ led bur@@ ners on as@@ be@@ sto@@ s mat@@ s .
and it does not just concern hospit@@ als .
as@@ be@@ sto@@ s has been used in offices , shops , libraries and city h@@ alls due to its fab@@ ulous insul@@ ating and fl@@ ame re@@ tar@@ dant properties .
schools too .
in fact , many people probably had the first as@@ be@@ sto@@ s contact in the class@@ room .
throughout the country , in thousands of chem@@ i@@ stry hours , students have put their bun@@ sen@@ bur@@ ners on as@@ be@@ sto@@ s mat@@ s .
as@@ be@@ sto@@ s is often discussed on web pages in schools .
and meanwhile , inno@@ cent objects in our houses , such as floor plates or sh@@ ing@@ le pan@@ es , have by default included as@@ be@@ sto@@ s .
&quot; it is an industrial po@@ ison that is present in large parts of our properties , &quot; notes andre@@ w mor@@ gan , the law@@ yer who represented andre@@ w law@@ son in his trial against gu@@ y &apos;s hospital .
in one case , the only contact that was made to a woman affected was the demo@@ lition of a garden sc@@ al@@ p in the 197@@ 0s .
so watch how you te@@ ar off your gar@@ d@@ ening sc@@ ales .
the impact of the diagno@@ sis , and the knowledge that the disease is incur@@ able , is immen@@ se .
&quot; it takes a while to process it , &quot; says gra@@ ham ab@@ bot@@ t .
i went back to work and tried to continue , but i realized that i could not focus on what i did .
i was in practice for two weeks .
then i knew i had to go and take care of myself .
well , i will not see another christmas .
the greatest difficulty was the change of perspective from a doctor to a patient &apos;s position .
like countless patients before him , he re@@ members how overwhel@@ med he was by all the information he had to deal with .
&quot; it was very difficult to take all of this on board , &quot; he says .
&quot; i asked my doctor &quot; how long have i left ? &quot;
and they gave me about 12 months .
i remember thinking , &quot; well , i will not see another christmas .
that was then . &apos;
mes@@ o@@ the@@ li@@ om@@ a is particularly insi@@ di@@ ous because it is our life@@ -@@ support mechanism - bre@@ a@@ thing itself - that causes fat@@ al cancer .
most cases of mes@@ o@@ the@@ li@@ om are caused by as@@ be@@ sto@@ s contact .
as@@ be@@ sto@@ s consists of the small@@ est fi@@ b@@ res .
when the as@@ be@@ sto@@ s is pur@@ i@@ fied and the fi@@ bers are in@@ hal@@ ed , they can be fixed in the ch@@ est fur , the skin around the lun@@ gs .
as@@ be@@ sto@@ s fi@@ bers ir@@ rit@@ ate the ch@@ est fur and can tri@@ gger cell mu@@ tations .
&quot; the problem ar@@ ises with the in@@ hal@@ ed nee@@ d@@ le-@@ shaped as@@ be@@ sto@@ s fi@@ b@@ res , &quot; says professor tom treas@@ ure , a heart thor@@ a@@ x doctor who joined the gu@@ y &apos;s hospital in 2001 .
the very hospital andre@@ w law@@ son susp@@ ects that he has exposed him to as@@ be@@ sto@@ s is now ir@@ on@@ ically a leading centre in the treatment of mes@@ o@@ the@@ li@@ om@@ a .
treas@@ ure knew law@@ son and treated some others , who were probably exposed to as@@ be@@ sto@@ s during their hospital training .
as soon as as@@ be@@ sto@@ s nee@@ d@@ les reach the l@@ ung tissu@@ e , tre@@ as@@ ure says , &quot; they are pus@@ hed from the bre@@ ath to the edge where the skin is .
it is inv@@ a@@ sive from the outset by nature .
the usual options for other cancer are not working well for mes@@ o@@ the@@ li@@ om@@ a .
the effectiveness of an operation , for example , is highly controversial .
some people think it is worth trying .
treas@@ ure den@@ ies that .
&quot; you cannot cut out the ch@@ est fur , &quot; he says .
they don &apos;t get around with the k@@ ni@@ fe .
meanwhile , the cancer &quot; on chem@@ other@@ ap@@ y does not speak very well , &quot; the &quot; effect shows &quot; , but does not he@@ al .
&quot; sometimes there are long-@@ stay survi@@ v@@ ors , &quot; says treas@@ ure .
but in the end they all die .
fortunately , some patients actually live long , much longer than expected .
the author ste@@ ph@@ en j@@ ay g@@ ould died 20 years after the diagno@@ sis .
two and a half years after his own diagno@@ sis , gra@@ ham ab@@ bot@@ t is still fighting .
after cont@@ acting mes@@ o@@ the@@ li@@ om , ab@@ bot@@ t came into contact with andre@@ w law@@ son , who had become a one-@@ man support and advisory office for those affected four years after his diagno@@ sis .
&quot; hel@@ lo , cancer center , &quot; he che@@ er@@ fully presented himself on calls .
&quot; he was very positive , &quot; says ab@@ bot@@ t .
he had received his diagno@@ sis 4 years earlier and was still very active .
ab@@ bot@@ t had originally offered six chem@@ other@@ ap@@ y cy@@ cles that las@@ ted four months and would probably only pro@@ long his life by one month .
&quot; i was desper@@ ate , &quot; he says .
i wanted to give up .
law@@ son managed , however , to &apos; make things appear in a slightly more positive light &apos; .
after consulting several doctors , ab@@ bot@@ t decided to continue his treatment with prof@@ . lo@@ ic lan@@ g-@@ la@@ z@@ dun@@ ski , heart thor@@ a@@ x specialist at the gu@@ y &apos;s .
&quot; we had an advantage by not having to be re@@ directed , i simply called and got an appointment , &quot; says gra@@ ham .
a normal patient would have to receive a transfer and wait for the treatment to be approved .
money is essential for mes@@ o@@ the@@ li@@ om@@ -@@ suff@@ e@@ rers to be able to take advantage of the best available therap@@ ies .
but when these treatments finally inevitably fail , many people are concerned about another financial concern - about the future of the families they leave behind .
and so they turn to the courts in the hope of compensation .
andre@@ w law@@ son cont@@ acted field fish@@ er water@@ house ll@@ p .
&quot; it has been known since 18@@ 98 that as@@ be@@ sto@@ s is extremely dangerous to health , &quot; mor@@ gan says .
but what changed in the 196@@ 0s was that it was recognized that very low levels of stress also represented a health risk .
and here , corporate neglig@@ ence began to play a role .
andre@@ w law@@ son and gu@@ y &apos;s hospital eventually joined the case , but it was not what mor@@ gan calls a &quot; full compensation &quot; because law@@ son could not prove with absolute certainty .
however , after his death , a gu@@ y spo@@ kes@@ man confirmed that &quot; the as@@ be@@ sto@@ s fi@@ bers in the bas@@ ement area affected were removed in the 199@@ 0s . &quot;
that was too late for andre@@ w law@@ son .
how to remove as@@ be@@ sto@@ s
indeed , mes@@ o@@ the@@ li@@ om@@ -@@ suff@@ e@@ rers seeking compensation face a huge problem of as@@ be@@ sto@@ s contact with a company or a job – usually decades after the incident .
many of their former employers have been sold or closed .
insurance documents may be lost .
and those who oppose claims know that time is for them , but certainly not with the pla@@ in@@ ti@@ ffs .
in response , there have been clear new legislation this year , making it easier for mes@@ o@@ the@@ li@@ om@@ -@@ affected people to claim compensation even if their former employers are no longer able to find it .
the law has established a £ 3@@ 50 million fund , funded by the insurance industry , for all diagno@@ sed after july 2012 , but not anyone can su@@ e .
in these cases , the pla@@ in@@ ti@@ ff will receive 80 % of what a court could have awarded them in a normal compensation process - around £ 1@@ 20@@ ,000 .
approximately 300 successful applications for the programme are expected each year .
andre@@ w mor@@ gan , like so many mes@@ o@@ the@@ li@@ om suff@@ e@@ rers , thin@@ ks that £ 3@@ 50 million is a &quot; very good job &quot; of the insurance industry .
&quot; this is a deal of insu@@ rers for insu@@ rers , &quot; he says , and indicates that this sum is a quarter of what insu@@ rers would have had to pay if the time had not gone beyond it .
mi@@ ke pen@@ ning , then minister of labour and pension , also ad@@ mitted that the law was &apos; not perfect &apos; .
but both pen@@ ning and mor@@ gan ad@@ mitted that , with seven deaths , rapid action is needed every day .
&quot; people are suffering so much and need help today , &quot; said pen@@ ning during the second hearing of the mes@@ o@@ the@@ li@@ om law in december last year .
at that time gra@@ ham ab@@ bot@@ t was in the hands of prof@@ . lo@@ ic lan@@ g-@@ la@@ z@@ dun@@ ski for 19 months .
after her first consultation , lan@@ g-@@ la@@ z@@ dun@@ ski recommended an operation which , unlike tom treas@@ ure , he expected to have a positive effect .
this was accompanied by radi@@ other@@ ap@@ y and chem@@ other@@ ap@@ y - a tri@@ ple therapy that can present a survival rate of up to 40 % over five years .
ab@@ bot@@ t felt strengthened .
&quot; that is of course the most important thing , &quot; says ab@@ bot@@ t .
this is always evident in patients .
there is something you can do on .
if you give up , you will quickly get worse .
gra@@ ham ab@@ bot@@ t under@@ went the operation in march 2012 .
at the end of august , he had the last of the six chem@@ other@@ ap@@ y cy@@ cles behind him .
after@@ care scan@@ ners showed no sign of the disease .
then i had a s@@ can in march 20@@ 14 .
there were several cancer spots around my bre@@ ast .
i have just been 50 .
that is not life@@ -@@ threat@@ ening .
that is a life@@ -@@ long process .
ab@@ bot@@ t under@@ went six chem@@ other@@ ap@@ y cy@@ cles again .
now there is no tr@@ ace of t@@ um@@ ors visible .
but the process is physi@@ cally and psycho@@ log@@ ically very demanding .
you have to think about practical things - about money when i am no longer , for example , or my wife &apos;s show how bo@@ iler time is working .
if you receive bad news , you will be negative .
they must look to the future .
as the father of el@@ lie , 16 , and tam@@ s@@ in , 14 , this is not always easy .
&quot; it is difficult for parents , &quot; he says .
it is hard to know what to say and how much to say .
when i first received my diagno@@ sis , i said to my girl that i had a disease that i would not be old with .
they re@@ acted very differently .
tam@@ s@@ in is very soci@@ able and un@@ st@@ up@@ id .
she told her friends and we received a lot of calls soon .
el@@ lie was more re@@ tic@@ ent .
she did not say much .
such talks are something all cancer patients must go through .
but , for mes@@ o@@ the@@ li@@ um features , such talks are not ho@@ pel@@ ess@@ ly en@@ du@@ red , not by a tr@@ ace of hope for survival .
the disease ( as well as ultimately for ste@@ ph@@ en j@@ ay g@@ ould ) provides a gri@@ m security .
as andre@@ w mor@@ gan says , &quot; mes@@ o@@ the@@ li@@ om is not life@@ -@@ threat@@ ening .

china ref@@ uses to allow hong kong to vote in government , while demonstr@@ ators swe@@ ar re@@ tali@@ ation
on sunday , despite the increased calls for democratic reform , the chinese parliament decided against nom@@ in@@ ating candidates for the 20@@ 17 elections by the hong kong elec@@ tor@@ ate .
this approach probably fu@@ el@@ ed the long-@@ awa@@ ited pro@@ tests in hong kong ’ s business district , while activi@@ sts launched planning and mobili@@ zation within hours of the announcement .
the decision of the chinese people ’ s congress basically allows communist leaders to reject all non-@@ beijing candidates .
&quot; this is not un@@ expected , but it is an@@ gr@@ y , &quot; said legal expert em@@ ily la@@ u , leader of the democratic party .
that is not what beijing had promised .
the people of hong kong have been lied to .
and it is clear that we are dealing with an author@@ itarian regime .
in defending the chinese decision , li fe@@ i , depu@@ ty secretary general of the permanent committee of the national people &apos;s congress , said that allowing public nom@@ inations in the hong kong government elections would be too &apos; cha@@ otic &apos; .
since 1997 , when britain returned control of hong kong to the chinese , beijing has promised to let the inhabitants el@@ ect the government presidency from 20@@ 17 .
the chinese leadership presented sunday ’ s decision as a democratic break@@ through because hong kong ’ s citizens have direct voting rights , but the decision also makes clear that china ’ s leaders remain firmly controlled by a nom@@ ination committee .
a new clause also states that only candidates with love for hong kong should be allowed .
the decision follows a summer when some of hong kong &apos;s largest and most public@@ -@@ sector pro@@ tests have been held for several years .
behind the pro-@@ democracy campaign in hong kong is the occup@@ y central movement with love and peace , whose organiz@@ ers have threatened to close off the financial district if beijing does not allow a genuine general rule of law .
on sunday evening , within hours of the announcement , hundreds of occup@@ y-@@ centr@@ al-@@ sup@@ porters gathered in the rain before hong kong ’ s government headquarters .
during the demonstration , the organis@@ ers said that their movement had reached a new level of civil dis@@ o@@ be@@ di@@ ence and that they were planning protest waves in the coming weeks .
however , they did not provide any details , apparently in order to avoid problems with the authorities .
in an online communication , the organis@@ ers informed us that the movement &quot; the occupation of the central district was only considered as a last resort , an action that should only take place if all the opportunities for dialogue are not exhaus@@ ted .
we are sorry to say that all the opportunities for dialogue have been exhaus@@ ted today and the occupation of the central district will definitely take place .
hong kong authorities have been preparing for the beijing announcement for days , and security measures were ti@@ ghten@@ ed in front of the government building on sunday , including police forces and bar@@ ric@@ ades .
the un@@ rest is rein@@ forced by the feeling of many in hong kong that they are slowly losing control of their city .
the entry of people from the main@@ land increases competition for products and services .
there is also growing fear that hong kong ’ s values , such as democracy and freedom of speech , are starting to cr@@ um@@ ble under the growing pressure of beijing .
some critic@@ ised the oc@@ cu@@ p@@ y centr@@ al movement ’ s demonstra@@ tions , putting the business – hong kong ’ s li@@ fel@@ ine – at risk .
&quot; the pro@@ tests you talk about could cause great economic damage , depending on how many people are involved in it and how long it will last , &quot; said legal expert reg@@ ine ip , who has long critic@@ ised the movement .
we do not want to raise fears that hong kong will get out of control .
that impression is bad for investment .
china ’ s state@@ -@@ controlled media recently reported about hong kong ’ s democracy activi@@ sts as sub@@ ver@@ sive agents , led by western powers .
this summer , activi@@ sts organised an un@@ official referendum on electoral rights , which took place with 7@@ 8@@ 0,000 people - more than one-@@ fifth of hong kong &apos;s voters .
in july , tens of thousands participated in one of the largest democratic demonstra@@ tions in the region ’ s history .

mr. ste@@ w@@ art also said that the service has a security division .
this service is an ideal alternative for students who would otherwise have to carry their belong@@ ings through the country in a dangerous car .
together with our new vi@@ f options , we look forward to ensuring that students reach the university with a minimum of effort and maximum of luxury this year .
a spo@@ kes@@ man said that there were no new book@@ ings , since the service had just been introduced , but added that &quot; students would book the service in the next few weeks &quot; .
the company also announced that it would expect a market for this offer despite the tu@@ ition fees of £ 9@@ ,000 per year .
students today differ greatly in their expectations and ambitions from students 10 , 20 , 30 or 40 years ago - it is more important than ever to make a great first impression , and with vi@@ f that is what you can do .
the national student union , however , critic@@ ised the service as being removed .
me@@ gan dun@@ n , vice president of the n@@ us for higher education said : &quot; this offer seems completely separate from the life of the majority of students .
many students who start stu@@ dying this month are facing a crisis of living costs , as the available financial assistance in the form of loans and schol@@ ar@@ ships can not keep with the so@@ aring b@@ ills of the simple living conditions , so they can keep away .
fem@@ ini@@ sts cri@@ tici@@ ze r@@ aci@@ al issues and police behavior after fer@@ g@@ us@@ on
the un@@ armed te@@ en@@ ager was killed at the beginning of this month by a police officer in fer@@ g@@ us@@ on , mo .
the participants raised their hands into the air and san@@ g , &quot; hands high , not sho@@ ot , &quot; while waiting for the bur@@ ial .
after two weeks of pro@@ tests in fer@@ g@@ us@@ on , mo , due to the sho@@ oting of the un@@ armed te@@ en@@ ager michael brown , the blo@@ gger mi@@ ri@@ am zo@@ il@@ a pe@@ re@@ z noticed a change in the white discussion .
in their experience , white fem@@ in@@ ist comm@@ ent@@ ators set gender before race when it comes to addressing reproduction law and income inequality .
but , while ten@@ sions in the middle west increased and received attention throughout the country , pe@@ re@@ z saw that white women ’ s responses turned 100 % around the race .
compared to the responses of black women shortly after the sho@@ ts of 9 august , the personal es@@ says came with tit@@ les like &quot; thoughts to fer@@ g@@ us@@ on of a white woman &quot; and &quot; fem@@ in@@ ism is not relatively late women &apos;s .
but for pe@@ re@@ z , that was an important change .
&quot; i do not think that fem@@ in@@ ism is the place for many people who are about white and speak of privile@@ ges in such a high class way , &quot; she said .
people felt comp@@ elled to express their views on the events .
it is characteristic of the crisis we are in and of the eth@@ nic@@ ity of the fer@@ g@@ us@@ on situation that you must express .
fer@@ g@@ us@@ on , a professor of english at o@@ hi@@ o state university , revealed problems to which black americans are exposed every day but not considered to be &apos; women &apos;s issues &apos; in the cultural space .
&quot; i can publish something fun@@ ny on fac@@ e@@ book about myself and my partner and get 150 li@@ kes from anywhere , &quot; said mit@@ ch@@ ell .
when i post something about how colo@@ red people in their own country are under sie@@ ge , silence is de@@ af@@ ening .
&quot; how can women be sure to speak publicly about a relationship , but not about public security ? &quot; she asked .
for black women like mit@@ ch@@ ell , who have studied race , gender , and sex@@ u@@ ality in the history of the us , there is no dic@@ ho@@ tom@@ y between race and gender problems .
for them , black women have not had the luxury of clean@@ ly separ@@ ating issues ; they live every day in the combined reality .
while white women now combine the themes of race and gender in fem@@ in@@ ist main@@ stream cir@@ cles , ang@@ ela hat@@ tery , professor of women and gender research at george mas@@ on university , says the opposite of her pre@@ dec@@ essor , ger@@ mas@@ on .
&quot; between 18@@ 65 and 18@@ 90 at least 10@@ ,000 black men were gel@@ y@@ n@@ cht and the justi@@ fication was almost always the ra@@ pe of a white woman , &quot; said hat@@ ter@@ y .
white women had to be involved in history to justify the ly@@ n@@ ch murder .
for hat@@ ter@@ y , the split between white and black women came at the point where white figh@@ ters for women ’ s election law , such as sus@@ an b@@ . an@@ th@@ ony , successfully analy@@ zed the country in the late 19@@ th-@@ century .
&quot; they made the decision to stand up for women &apos;s election law , and the right to vote for black was to come later , &quot; said hat@@ ter@@ y .
when you think of such things , you can see with power why colo@@ red women don ’ t trust white women .
we have not done our job well .
we have never helped black women protect their hus@@ bands and s@@ ons .
even after women were granted the right to vote in 19@@ 20 , it took a decade for white women to oppose the ly@@ n@@ ch in the association of southern woman for the prevention of ly@@ n@@ ching .
the group was established almost 40 years after the original request for help from black women , says mit@@ ch@@ ell .
for mit@@ ch@@ ell , the flo@@ od of white fem@@ in@@ ist responses to the issues raised by fer@@ g@@ us@@ on - police behavior , r@@ aci@@ al discrimination - has been a mirror of the times when white fem@@ ini@@ sts &apos; catch each other .
&apos;@@ would it not be great if the activi@@ sts who have such traditional fem@@ in@@ ist platforms have the right to raise a child as seriously as they do with the right to fr@@ ac@@ tional control ? &apos;
fem@@ ini@@ sts of the second generation who built up their care@@ ers in the struggle for re@@ productive rights and access to contrac@@ ep@@ tive funds are now trying to understand what that means .
the well-known white fem@@ in@@ ist acti@@ vis@@ t gl@@ oria ste@@ iner went to fac@@ e@@ book two weeks after the sho@@ oting of michael brown , and published a po@@ ised article by re@@ bec@@ ca car@@ roll , she asked for more .
&quot; i hope that women who have another but parallel reason to understand a danger in@@ he@@ rent in the body - and opinions on the race that will be very different in public surve@@ ys - will lead to changes . &quot;
although ste@@ iner stands for a more inter@@ sec@@ tional fem@@ in@@ ism , which addresses issues of race as well as gender , some of her comments on the r@@ aci@@ al issue in america are nevertheless pu@@ zz@@ led .
&quot; the most recent example of this is the &quot; new york times &quot; , which is the most important part of the american enterprise institute , &quot; the most recent example of the american science institute , the &quot; the american science institute for science and technology .
there are now hundreds of special programmes for girls and young women , but almost nothing for bo@@ ys .
but when the white house recently launched a small program , my brother &apos;s ke@@ eper , to help vulnerable young black and h@@ is@@ pan@@ ic men , there was an@@ no@@ ying reaction from many fem@@ ini@@ sts .
the police ’ s relationship with the black community is not the only problem that is pus@@ hing into the fore@@ ground of main@@ stream fem@@ in@@ ism .
after the us border police took up almost 6@@ 3@@ ,000 un@@ accompanied min@@ ors on the sou@@ th@@ west border of the country this year , the issue of immigration reform is again coming to the surface - this time as a women &apos;s issue .
andre@@ a mer@@ c@@ ado , co-@@ chair of we bel@@ ong together , an organisation that mobil@@ ises women for immigration reform , said that for a re@@ consideration of the issue , it must be only a key women &apos;s issue .
&quot; these speak for themselves , &quot; said mer@@ c@@ ado .
when the vast majority of the working vis@@ as go to male immigrants , the women who ac@@ company them are in a position where they are vulnerable to domestic violence and exploitation .
&quot; these stories find a lasting feature in women &apos;s organisations , &quot; she said .
&quot; sch@@ we@@ in@@ e-@@ haus &quot; in ip@@ sw@@ ich is on sale
the image of a house for sale was removed from real estate agents when it became clear that it showed a large pi@@ g that it had made comfortable in the living room .
the de@@ t@@ ached house has one bedroom , is located on a private street in ip@@ sw@@ ich and is offered for £ 1@@ 20@@ ,000 .
the details included a picture of the house &apos;s living room - including a pi@@ g that had its head be@@ amed to a sof@@ a .
real estate agent conn@@ ell@@ s said that the pi@@ g in the photo was the owner &apos;s pet .
&quot; the photo was er@@ ron@@ e@@ ously published and has since been removed &quot; said a spo@@ kes@@ man of the company .
in the expos@@ é of the house , conn@@ ell@@ s described the former assembly house as a &quot; unique one-@@ bedroom family house . &quot;
although the bro@@ ker has removed the image from the website , it still appears on advertising material .
the sale of houses caused interest in the social media when some asked whether the pi@@ g was included in the purchase price .
har@@ ve@@ y , the sw@@ an city , is home to a new mil@@ li@@ on@@ air@@ e after lo@@ t@@ tery win .
a lo@@ t@@ to@@ player from har@@ ve@@ y is out this month .
the search for a new mil@@ li@@ on@@ air@@ e in sou@@ th@@ west per@@ th continues , with a happy winner who will receive almost $ 1.@@ 1 million from the lo@@ t@@ tery draw on saturday .
a newspaper ki@@ os@@ k in har@@ ve@@ y pul@@ led the jack@@ pot for the second time in five years in the drawing of the first division , after $ 1 million in november 2009 .
the lu@@ cky winner , however , has to register .
the shop owner ste@@ ve forward said that the profit care for talking material in the small town in the sou@@ th@@ west of per@@ th .
the city is not talking about anything else , and everyone is quite ex@@ ci@@ ted .
we thought that such a gain could occur .
eight wa winners celebrated pri@@ zes in the first division last month , a fit@@ ting conclusion for a few happy weeks for the players in the state .
last week , a can@@ ning val@@ e player became one of the five mil@@ li@@ on@@ ai@@ res in august , after a couple of weeks ago from bel@@ mon@@ t had made the me@@ ga gain of $ 7.@@ 5 million .
the winning couple had been playing for 20 years and said that the prize allows them the possibility of a world trip and the purchase of a new house .
the mil@@ li@@ on@@ air@@ e from har@@ ve@@ y is the 5@@ 9@@ th winner of the first division in the wa this year , with a total of almost $ 85 million .
leon@@ id@@ as asked for the gla@@ di@@ at@@ o@@ ren@@ arena
not only the gla@@ di@@ ators were an@@ k@@ le deep in the mat@@ sch at the first r@@ ö@@ mer@@ tag in the leisure park .
but the attr@@ action of the event was strong enough to attract well over 1000 visitors yesterday , who de@@ fied the ra@@ in@@ sho@@ wers and the autumn cold and were completely enthusi@@ astic about the historical spectac@@ le .
there was a colour@@ ful range of representa@@ tions , performances , games , exhi@@ bits and information about the roman era and its importance to the r@@ hin@@ eland .
the main attr@@ action of the day was undoubtedly the mar@@ tial fighting force of the gla@@ di@@ ator school &quot; am@@ or mor@@ tis &quot; , which used every ra@@ iny break to pre@@ ach their fighting art in par@@ i@@ sian mar@@ tial sand .
gla@@ di@@ ator owners &quot; leon@@ id@@ as &quot; proved to be a hum@@ or@@ ous and kno@@ wled@@ ge@@ able pres@@ enter and sent his men into the ring for a her@@ o@@ ic du@@ el in various gla@@ di@@ at@@ or@@ s. the two men were killed .
first , the &quot; pro@@ voca@@ tors &quot; were in the line with rec@@ tan@@ g@@ le shi@@ eld and short-@@ s@@ word , as well as le@@ g on the left le@@ g and arm rail on the right arm .
the &quot; es@@ se@@ d@@ ari@@ i &quot; with ch@@ est shi@@ eld , short s@@ word and lit@@ ter l@@ ance , and iron gla@@ di@@ ator hel@@ met , leg@@ s and arm protection followed .
the &quot; re@@ ti@@ ari@@ us &quot; , which took the thro@@ at net , dre@@ iz@@ z@@ ack and dol@@ ch against the &quot; sec@@ ut@@ or &quot; and , after a short fight , hit the bur@@ ns .
since the s@@ words cl@@ ash@@ ed me@@ tal@@ ically , the shi@@ el@@ ds ro@@ lled and the lit@@ ters flo@@ wn sur@@ ren@@ tly through the arena that could become a fear and fear for the health of the glass .
but on them was the imposing &quot; sum@@ ma ru@@ d@@ is &quot; , the mus@@ cu@@ lar re@@ fe@@ ree , an always atten@@ tive eye .
&quot; we wanted to revi@@ ve the everyday life of rome and to make the culture of the roman age visible , &quot; said lo@@ ren@@ z e@@ us@@ kir@@ chen , chairman of the organiz@@ er &quot; fre@@ un@@ desk@@ re@@ is in@@ r@@ ö@@ mer@@ kan@@ al &quot; .
after two years of preparation , the leisure park became a &quot; op@@ pi@@ dum roman@@ um &quot; for a day , a roman city , as vice may@@ or cla@@ us we@@ h@@ age stated in his gre@@ e@@ ting .
after all , the roman@@ s have not only brought war and con@@ quest to our region , but also roman culture and numerous buildings that we still adm@@ ire today .
the remains of this were also to be seen during the roman day , such as &quot; aqu@@ educ@@ t mar@@ ble &quot; from the ele@@ ven me@@ tre@@ -@@ high and 14@@ 00@@ -@@ me@@ tre@@ -@@ long r@@ ö@@ mer@@ kan@@ al bridge , which once stood at l@@ ü@@ f@@ tel@@ berg .
the fron@@ tin@@ us society once and now confron@@ ted the water and energy supply , and managing director pe@@ tra fr@@ ic@@ ke knew : &quot; we still benefit from the knowledge of the past &quot; .
this is also confirmed by diplom@@ -@@ surve@@ ying engine@@ er r@@ alp@@ h he@@ ili@@ ger of the &quot; engine@@ er@@ te@@ am@@ z@@ wei@@ ten &quot; from rhe@@ in@@ bach , who presented surve@@ ying instruments of the roman@@ s such as ch@@ or@@ ob@@ at , gro@@ ma or di@@ op@@ tra .
the roman@@ s villa in blan@@ ken@@ heim presented the draw@@ ings and models of the exc@@ av@@ ations of an@@ no 18@@ 94 , and br@@ ic@@ ks from the original hypo@@ co@@ at , the warm he@@ ater , which once ex@@ isted in the roman period .
also impressive are the foot@@ prin@@ ts left by wol@@ f and fox in the cla@@ y foot@@ steps two mill@@ en@@ nia ago , before they were bur@@ ned .
in 2011 , the office for soil preser@@ vation at the rhe@@ in@@ land regional association had exc@@ av@@ ated the remains of a roman villa at the nor@@ d industrial park in rhe@@ in@@ bach .
the walls of an economic building with a dar@@ re for dr@@ ying cere@@ als and for m@@ am@@ m@@ als have been found .
the building probably belong@@ ed to a villa rus@@ tic@@ a , an agricultural estate , explained the archae@@ o@@ log@@ ist dr. j@@ enni@@ fer mor@@ sch@@ is@@ er .
a number of finds from these exc@@ av@@ ations presented them in a glass display , including a large plate , several fine glass vessels and parts of a decor@@ ative nec@@ kl@@ ace .
mor@@ sch@@ is@@ er susp@@ ects the villa from the first to the fourth century ad , until the fall of the german@@ s in the then roman r@@ hin@@ eland .
the children also employed the roman wind@@ m@@ ill game , similar to the m@@ ill game today , or they wrote their names on wa@@ x panels , as the roman students did .
at the stand of the r@@ ö@@ mer@@ ther@@ men z@@ ü@@ l@@ p@@ ich , the children were allowed to lay mo@@ sa@@ ics themselves , tin@@ der at the glass museum rhe@@ in@@ bach glass mo@@ sa@@ ics and serve at the centre of nature a .
the original roman v@@ ans , built by two cold blo@@ ss@@ oms , went through the recre@@ ational park and passed the impressive state of the urban gy@@ m@@ na@@ si@@ um &quot; here , the project results of the two schools .
with a week of roman@@ s from september 13@@ th to 21st , the municip@@ ality of w@@ ach@@ t@@ berg will also be hosting the 20@@ 14 r@@ hin@@ eland r@@ ö@@ mer@@ -@@ year , which is supposed to remind of the death of emper@@ or au@@ gu@@ st@@ us 2000 years ago .
together with the he@@ im@@ at@@ - and histor@@ is@@ ch@@ ver@@ un@@ gen as well as the w@@ ach@@ t@@ ber@@ ger wan@@ der@@ -@@ vere@@ in , the partnership association and the la@@ i@@ en@@ spi@@ el@@ kre@@ is ob@@ er@@ bac@@ he@@ m , among others .
for example , a roman legi@@ on@@ na@@ ire is told of his work on the zu@@ gen@@ e w@@ ach@@ t@@ berg , presents plants as living roman monuments and provides a fun@@ ny lesson in international understanding .
the ad@@ endor@@ f primary school is dedicated to the topic of the roman@@ s in the course of a project week .
the roman@@ s ’ week is intended to make the numerous trac@@ es of the roman@@ s in w@@ ach@@ t@@ berg , which are often not visible at first gl@@ ance , more visible .
the w@@ ach@@ t@@ ber@@ ger ra@@ th@@ aus will remind you of the finds of the ber@@ k@@ um mat@@ ron sanc@@ tu@@ ary in 18@@ 7@@ 9 .
e@@ bol@@ a : the ep@@ ide@@ mic is bur@@ d@@ ening west africa ’ s economy
the e@@ bol@@ a ep@@ ide@@ mic in west africa is also a severe b@@ low to the economy .
markets are or@@ ph@@ an@@ ed - and international companies are di@@ stan@@ cing themselves .
the dev@@ ast@@ ating e@@ bol@@ a ep@@ ide@@ mic is a heavy b@@ low to the economy of west africa .
the har@@ v@@ est is ro@@ tting in the fields , the mines are leaving and the markets are or@@ ph@@ an@@ ed - the virus has been a heavy hit in the region .
some international companies are already on the si@@ de@@ lines .
&quot; the e@@ bol@@ a ep@@ ide@@ mic is not only a medical crisis , but also an economic one , &quot; the head of the african development bank , don@@ ald k@@ ab@@ er@@ u@@ ka , jud@@ ged .
liber@@ ia is the hard@@ est hit
&quot; it is a total disaster , we lose a lot of money , &quot; says al@@ ha@@ ji b@@ am@@ o@@ go , who sel@@ ls clothing in the second largest market in liber@@ ia &apos;s capital , mon@@ ro@@ via .
only those who want to buy food or something to dis@@ inf@@ ect e@@ bol@@ a can be placed on the market .
liber@@ ia is the most se@@ ve@@ rely affected by the virus , and the fe@@ ver alone has claimed more than 600 lives .
recently , health authorities said that the disease had pen@@ etr@@ ated every corner of the country .
the virus has spread in gu@@ ine@@ a , sier@@ ra le@@ one and ni@@ geria as well .
in total , more than 1 500 people have died , and thousands more have died .
foreign firms ’ employees
companies are running all over the res@@ our@@ ce-@@ rich countries .
foreign companies such as the steel company ar@@ cel@@ or mit@@ tal are dis@@ cour@@ aging their employees , and several international airlines are no longer flying to the affected regions .
local trad@@ ers and farmers are also respon@@ ding : few merchan@@ ts still leave their homes to supply supplies .
in some areas of sier@@ ra le@@ one and liber@@ ia , which are quar@@ ant@@ ine , the co@@ co@@ a and coffee be@@ ans important for export are among the ro@@ ts on the fields .
farmers do not d@@ are to leave their homes for har@@ v@@ est .
food
&quot; people will travel less and less , &quot; says phil@@ li@@ pe de v@@ re@@ yer , paris expert on the economy of west africa .
for example , the man who normally goes to the market and sel@@ ls his vegetables would rather stay at home .
the population is therefore feeling the effects of the ep@@ ide@@ mic directly and urgently : food is scar@@ ce .
in the markets , supplies of basic food@@ stuffs such as rice are d@@ wind@@ ling .
at the same time , the region , which is heavily dependent on international companies , is threat@@ ening to suffer an image damage , with far-@@ reaching consequences .
the greatest danger is that international companies will always avoid the area for a long time , says phili@@ ppe hu@@ g@@ on of the french think tan@@ k ir@@ is .
the crucial question is how far and how long the virus will spread .
the impression that investors have of living and investing in gu@@ ine@@ a , sier@@ ra le@@ one and liber@@ ia may be &quot; that it is dangerous &quot; war@@ ns hu@@ g@@ on .
the disease also stra@@ ins states ’ tight budgets
the disease also affects the already tight state budgets of the states concerned .
the rating agency mo@@ o@@ dy &apos;s fears that its budgets will be heavily stra@@ ined by the high spending on the health system and , in addition , by the wor@@ sen@@ ing economy .
the african development bank has already promised to provide the countries ’ health systems with usd 60 million ( eur 45 million ) .
the effects are also being felt in ni@@ geria , where so far few e@@ bol@@ a cases have been diagno@@ sed .
it is true that the o@@ il@@ -@@ rich region of the southern ni@@ ger del@@ ta has not been affected .
but elsewhere , many people already stay at home for fear of cont@@ ag@@ ion .
reservations in hotels also fall significantly .
protect your 50@@ th anniversary celebra@@ tes your 50@@ th anniversary .
the sch@@ ü@@ tz@@ en@@ vere@@ in &quot; t@@ ann@@ en@@ wal@@ d &quot; bern@@ ga@@ u celebra@@ tes its 50@@ th anniversary from 12 to 14 september .
the 50@@ th anniversary of the foundation festival from 12 to 14 september is being prepared at the sch@@ ü@@ tz@@ en@@ vere@@ in t@@ ann@@ en@@ wal@@ d .
the event will be held on friday , 12 september , a great evening of entertainment with the dor@@ fro@@ ck@@ er group .
on saturday , the big b@@ ö@@ ll@@ er@@ sho@@ oting takes place at 6 pm .
the evening of the mo@@ od with the &quot; sto@@ ap@@ fal@@ zer sp@@ it@@ z@@ bu@@ am &quot; is afterwards in the large f@@ enced t@@ ent .
the br@@ ass band provides for music .
the highlights on sunday are the fe@@ ast service and 9.@@ 30 a.m. in the par@@ ish church and the large for@@ tress at 2 p.m.
in the afternoon , the price distribution of the federal and the gau@@ ge is also available .
the 25 ladies with their dir@@ n@@ d@@ l@@ n will be a particularly beautiful sight .
the fe@@ st@@ k@@ ap@@ elle is the br@@ ass band bern@@ ga@@ u .
the pat@@ ron is may@@ or wol@@ f@@ gan@@ g wild and secretary of state al@@ bert fü@@ r@@ ack@@ er .
the original name &quot; sch@@ ü@@ tz@@ en@@ ges@@ ell@@ schaft t@@ ann@@ en@@ wal@@ d bern@@ ga@@ u &quot; dates from 19@@ 07 , when the society for &quot; social entertainment by means of exercise in room and small cali@@ bre sho@@ oting &quot; was founded on march 21 .
the na@@ zi regime had dis@@ solved the association in 19@@ 37 .
only in 196@@ 4 did 19 young men find themselves again , who on 30 april in the gas@@ th@@ aus lu@@ k@@ as raised the &quot; new &quot; sho@@ oting club &quot; t@@ ann@@ en@@ wal@@ d &quot; bern@@ ga@@ u from b@@ ap@@ tism .
kar@@ l m@@ ä@@ r@@ z and ad@@ ol@@ f ried led the association as a sho@@ ot@@ master through a difficult early period , where the primary aim was to find a club club club and install the sho@@ oting company .
already in the autumn of 196@@ 5 the sch@@ ü@@ tz@@ en@@ vere@@ in in the gas@@ th@@ aus &quot; le@@ in@@ inger &quot; started with two teams in the round competi@@ tions .
in the following years , the sport sho@@ ot@@ ers , who were now organized into seven teams , established themselves in all classes up to the first ga@@ ul@@ le .
the club records were pur@@ t@@ ling every year and the magic border of 3@@ 80 r@@ ings was first reached by ru@@ di me@@ i@@ er in 1980 .
as the performance of the active sho@@ ot@@ ers has increased , the number of members has also developed posi@@ tively .
after the club &quot; le@@ in@@ inger &quot; no longer met the requirements of a modern sho@@ oting club , the former board of directors under the leadership of jo@@ han@@ n r@@ in@@ n decided to open a new restaurant in the bas@@ ement .
after a work performance of 27@@ 00 hours , par@@ ish str@@ ass@@ er gave the church bl@@ essing on 8 may 198@@ 8 for the new sho@@ ot@@ ers &apos; rooms .
one of the great highlights in the club &apos;s history was certainly the 4@@ 4th ga@@ thering , cou@@ pled with the sole@@ m@@ n con@@ sec@@ r@@ ation of the new sho@@ ot@@ ers &apos; flag in july 1991 .
on 23 and 24 april 1994 the sch@@ ü@@ tz@@ en@@ vere@@ in celebrated its 30@@ th anniversary .
in 1995 , a b@@ ö@@ ll@@ er@@ group was established .
jo@@ se@@ f sch@@ mal@@ z@@ l has been a b@@ ö@@ ll@@ er@@ re@@ ch@@ ent .
the focus of the bav@@ arian b@@ ö@@ ll@@ er@@ tre@@ ff@@ en 2005 was a great challenge for the &quot; b@@ ö@@ ll@@ er@@ tre@@ ff@@ en &quot; and for the association as a whole .
in many hours of volunte@@ er work , the club members moder@@ ni@@ zed the premises and sho@@ oting facilities at the bern@@ gau@@ er hof last year , thus bringing them up to date with the latest technology .
ele@@ ven run@@ ners
the sporting achievements of the sho@@ ot@@ ers &apos; association can also be seen .
al@@ together , ele@@ ven teams are currently participating in the round competi@@ tions : six air ri@@ f@@ le teams , one air gun team , one sports gun k@@ 1 , one youth and two ah teams .
the first team with lars ell@@ rich , k@@ ath@@ ar@@ ina ell@@ rich , ste@@ ff@@ i gra@@ d and ker@@ sti@@ n k@@ ell@@ er@@ mann joined the ga@@ u league in round 2013 / 14 ( highest league in the eng@@ au ) .
the second team with ve@@ ren@@ a mo@@ os@@ bur@@ ger alex@@ and@@ ra me@@ i@@ er , eva sch@@ u@@ h@@ mann and to@@ bi@@ as gram@@ l joined the ga@@ ul@@ ing@@ a nor@@ d in the ga@@ u@@ ob@@ er@@ lig@@ a .
besides sho@@ oting , events such as bo@@ ck@@ ste@@ cks , car@@ ni@@ val and k@@ ings ball , club excur@@ sion and christmas party have a tradition .
the pat@@ r@@ ons are also present at the festi@@ vals in par@@ ish and par@@ ish .
ton@@ y ste@@ w@@ art is in the thro@@ es of an accident when he returns to the race track
ton@@ y ste@@ war@@ t &apos;s return to the race track ended about half way through his race on the atlan@@ ta motor spe@@ ed@@ way .
ste@@ w@@ art dro@@ ve against the wall for the second time after his front ri@@ pe bur@@ st in round 17@@ 2 and finished his evening .
ste@@ w@@ art dro@@ ve his damaged car into the garage and left it without talking to journalists .
ch@@ ad jo@@ hn@@ ston , his team leader , said that his 1@@ 4-@@ strong team was disappointed , but is now concentr@@ ating on the race next weekend in rich@@ mon@@ d , vir@@ g@@ ini@@ a .
&quot; i wish we had a better commitment and a better result for him , &quot; said jo@@ hn@@ ston .
we are going to rich@@ mon@@ d and hope we can do better there .
ste@@ w@@ art already dro@@ ve to a wall at the sunday evening race after a col@@ li@@ sion with ky@@ le bus@@ ch and had his car repa@@ ired .
&apos;@@ i have rightly pin@@ pointed good hopes for a good result today , &apos; said jo@@ hn@@ ston and added , &apos; it just did not work &apos; .
not long after the second accident , ste@@ war@@ ts wag@@ ons were loaded into the trac@@ tor and the team had packed and was ready to leave .
ste@@ w@@ art dro@@ pped three nas@@ car spr@@ int cup rac@@ es after his car met and killed another driver in an ash lan@@ ding in the north of new york state .
he decided to return this week and win a seat in the pursu@@ it either in atlan@@ ta or at the next race in rich@@ mon@@ d .
he returned to his job , during an investigation into the tragic incident that led to the death of the 20@@ -@@ year-@@ old k@@ ev@@ in ward j@@ r . , who had embar@@ ked on a career path during a race to con@@ front ste@@ w@@ art .
the authorities informed on friday that the investigation into the cause of the accident would continue for at least two weeks .
no decision has yet been made as to whether ste@@ w@@ art can expect charges .
the three-@@ time champi@@ on was received with great applause when presented before the race .
after a start at the 12@@ th position , ste@@ w@@ art had already just passed into the first 10 and was tempor@@ arily placed fourth .
after a re@@ start in round 12@@ 2 , bus@@ ch ri@@ pped
the no . 18 car@@ t was out of control after the exit from b@@ end 2 and col@@ li@@ ded with ste@@ w@@ art , both cars dro@@ ve against the wall .
ste@@ w@@ art continued , but fell back to place 21 .
young d@@ anc@@ ers looking for d@@ ancing
simply try out : la@@ ura , len@@ a , lis@@ a , mari@@ e , bet@@ t@@ ina , em@@ ma and leader lis@@ a ne@@ it@@ z@@ el ( from left ) are looking forward to co-@@ argu@@ ing .
like many other clubs , the jazz groups on the tv ja@@ hn create all-@@ day classes at secondary schools .
after the summer holidays , some groups deci@@ mated themselves .
now we are looking for more and more young people for a sport that is healthy and fun .
in the two jazz and modern dance groups of lis@@ a ne@@ it@@ z@@ el , form@@ erly d@@ anc@@ er in the jazz and modern dance formation &quot; spir@@ its &quot; , only nine children are still .

bulg@@ arian prison monit@@ ors pro@@ tests nation@@ wide
hundreds of prison staff from all over bulgaria have organised a nation@@ wide protest in the capital , so@@ fi@@ a , in front of the ministry of justice .
in the peaceful demonstration , they repeated their demands for the restoration of their old working conditions , which were recently changed .
higher sal@@ aries are also on a list of demands to be discussed with the interim justice minister h@@ ris@@ to i@@ van@@ ov .
officials have been pro@@ testing symb@@ ol@@ ically for a month against the new working hours and are calling for a return to the former 24-hour la@@ yers .

ukra@@ inian army has given up lu@@ han@@ sk airport
in eastern ukraine , the pr@@ or@@ us@@ sian figh@@ ters are still on the rise .
after heavy batt@@ les , sup@@ pos@@ ed@@ ly involving russian tan@@ k batt@@ ali@@ ons , the ukra@@ inian army has today , monday , abandoned lu@@ han@@ sk re@@ bel airport .
the army also announced that seven soldiers have been killed in the last 24 hours .
ukra@@ inian president pe@@ tr@@ o por@@ o@@ sh@@ en@@ ko had previously drawn personal consequences from the heavy defe@@ at of his army in the fight against the separ@@ ati@@ sts and announced changes in the supreme army leadership , without men@@ tioning details .
pr@@ or@@ us@@ sian separ@@ ati@@ sts sho@@ ot plane from the airport
in the fight against ukra@@ inian government troops , pr@@ or@@ us@@ sian separ@@ ati@@ sts have again , according to their own accounts , shot a figh@@ ter plane and two military helicop@@ ters .

nato does not break agreements with russia
nato will not break its agreement with russia due to the planned sta@@ tioning in eastern europe as a result of the ukra@@ ine crisis .
nato secretary general and@@ ers fo@@ gh r@@ as@@ mus@@ sen said on monday in brussels that nato is following the founding agreement of the nato / russia council of 1997 .
the nato leader , however , accused russia of &quot; a gross breach &quot; of the agreement .
&quot; today we must face the reality that russia does not regard nato as a partner , &quot; r@@ as@@ mus@@ sen said .
documents and opinions from the russian side show that they regard us as oppon@@ ents .
stronger nato presence
r@@ as@@ mus@@ sen has also announced that he will strengthen nato &apos;s presence in eastern europe .
a read@@ iness action plan to be adopted at the nato summit in wal@@ es will ensure that &apos; we will have a more visible nato presence in the east as long as necessary &apos; , said r@@ as@@ mus@@ sen on monday in brussels .
ki@@ e@@ v and moscow agree on new gas talks
russia and ukraine have officially agreed on new talks to set@@ tle their gas dispute .
the negotiations are scheduled for next saturday , said the russian energy minister alexander no@@ wa@@ k on monday .
a decision by the european union is still being awa@@ ited to send a representative to the talks .
because of the dispute over the price of gas , ukraine has not been receiving fuel from russia for weeks .
last but not least , eu energy commissioner g@@ ün@@ ther o@@ et@@ t@@ inger bro@@ ke the gap between the two sides .
ukraine had war@@ ned that russia could also cut off gas supplies to europe .
europe is producing around one third of its natural gas from russian sources , much of which is chan@@ n@@ elled through ukraine .
mer@@ kel spe@@ aks power : tol@@ l will come &quot; very clearly &quot;
now the chancell@@ or is once again clearly committed to this .
however , it is not a car@@ te blan@@ che for all the complicated details .
persi@@ stent concerns from the c@@ du against the car tol@@ l have gr@@ asp@@ ed the c@@ su increasingly .
chancell@@ or ang@@ ela mer@@ kel , following persi@@ stent resistance from her c@@ du , has spoken in favour of introducing a tol@@ l on cars .
&quot; to put it bl@@ un@@ tly , it is in the coalition treaty and it will come , &quot; said the party leader on monday after meetings of the c@@ du governing bodies in berlin .
but mer@@ kel did not commit himself to a detailed model for the time being .
the black and red government programme refers to &apos; certain parameters &apos; .
the federal minister for transport , alexander do@@ br@@ in@@ dt ( c@@ su ) , &apos; made a proposal and this is now being continued &apos; .
the n@@ r@@ w-@@ c@@ du , however , insi@@ sts on its no to a tol@@ l on all roads .
mer@@ kel stressed that finance minister wol@@ f@@ gan@@ g sch@@ ä@@ u@@ ble ( c@@ du ) is also construc@@ tively engaged in deliber@@ ations for a draft law .
beyond this subject , he also talked with do@@ br@@ in@@ dt about other ways of activ@@ ating more private capital for infrastructure investment , including broad@@ band expansion .
sch@@ ä@@ u@@ ble had a &quot; mirror &quot; report un@@ comm@@ ented on sunday , his house is exam@@ ining its own concept to re@@ im@@ bur@@ se motorway investors with tol@@ l income , 17 of which are paid by tol@@ l income .
c@@ su chief hor@@ st see@@ ho@@ fer then war@@ ned against developing tol@@ l concepts against the minister in the cab@@ in@@ et .
c@@ du federal vi@@ ze arm@@ in las@@ ch@@ et re@@ affir@@ med his objec@@ tions .
&quot; the coalition agreement never assumed to be responsible for all district and federal roads , &quot; said the north r@@ hin@@ e-@@ west@@ ph@@ alia c@@ du state leader .
in this respect , it is an important signal that see@@ ho@@ fer has now announced that it will be discussing the issue again .
the c@@ du regional associations bad@@ en-@@ w@@ ür@@ t@@ tem@@ berg and rhe@@ in@@ land@@ -@@ p@@ fal@@ z also resi@@ st the plans .
the background to this is the fear that a tol@@ l will affect the local border traffic to neighbouring countries .
see@@ ho@@ fer had demanded loy@@ alty to the coalition due to the tol@@ l criticism from ran@@ ks of the c@@ du .
the left regards the plans as a failure in the face of the dispute in the union .
&quot; the mur@@ ks tol@@ l is dead , &quot; said party leader ber@@ nd ri@@ ex@@ inger of the &quot; new os@@ n@@ ab@@ r@@ ü@@ ck newspaper &quot; ( monday ) .
the german federal ministry of education and research ( b@@ mb@@ f ) is planning to introduce a duty to vig@@ net@@ te on all german roads , which is due to start in 20@@ 16 .
according to the coalition agreement , however , domestic car owners must not be additionally charged .
they should therefore be given full compensation for tol@@ ls through the vehicle tax .
however , the model must not penal@@ ise foreign drivers on the grounds of their nation@@ ality , in accordance with eu law .
genetic dis@@ order often mis@@ diagno@@ ses
a british said that she thought , as a result of a mis@@ diagno@@ sis , that she would die for many years .
kar@@ in ro@@ d@@ ger lived almost all her youth in the belief that she had only a few years to live after being diagno@@ sed with another disease .
she actually suffered from the char@@ co@@ t-@@ mari@@ e-@@ to@@ oth disease ( c@@ mt ) - a group of in@@ h@@ eri@@ ted dis@@ orders that damage ner@@ ves outside the brain and sp@@ inal cor@@ d .
char@@ ity c@@ mt uk announced that mis@@ diagno@@ sis is a common problem in people with c@@ mt because so little is known about it .
some 23@@ ,000 people in britain are likely to suffer from c@@ mt , which can cause motor dis@@ orders such as mus@@ cle weak@@ ness , un@@ safe cor@@ rid@@ ors and cur@@ ved to@@ es .
the disease is incur@@ able and progres@@ sing , which means that the symp@@ t@@ oms become worse over time .
when ro@@ d@@ gers was 13 , she believed she was suffering from fried@@ rich@@ -@@ at@@ a@@ xi@@ e ( fa ) - a disease with very poor chan@@ ces of survival .
ro@@ d@@ ger thought she was sitting in a whe@@ el@@ chair before she was 18 and died before her 30@@ th birth@@ day .
the mother of two children , 51 years old today , said : &quot; as a child , i knew i could not do the same as the others .
i fell constantly and everything las@@ ted longer with me .
i could never ride with the other children roll@@ er sk@@ ate@@ board or sk@@ ate@@ board and was often han@@ ged in school because of my way to go and run .
ro@@ d@@ gers said that at the age of 13 , she had gone to hospital after several operations to reli@@ eve her ach@@ ill@@ es and stret@@ ching her feet , when her doctor had left her room and read that she had suffered .
&quot; i felt guil@@ ty because i was cur@@ ious , so i didn &apos;t tell anyone , but i went home , looked for the disease in the library and wrote to the fa@@ -@@ ges@@ ell@@ schaft , said .
when i received an answer , i was sho@@ c@@ ked and pan@@ ic@@ ked .
i thought i would be in the whe@@ el@@ chair with 18 and die at 25 , and in between i would slowly lose all my skills .
i made all of this with me alone and planned my own fun@@ eral .
she said when she became 17 , she re@@ alised that her abilities had not decreas@@ ed as much as she had imag@@ ined and ques@@ tioned her doctor .
he simply stood up and hu@@ gged me and said , &apos; my love , i do not think you have it , otherwise you will be in the whe@@ el@@ chair now &apos; .
i think you have something far less life@@ -@@ threat@@ ening .
after some genetic tests she was diagno@@ sed with c@@ mt .
&quot; when he explained to me what c@@ mt was , i felt as if i were a winner , &quot; she said .
char@@ ity c@@ mt uk has launched a c@@ mt awareness month to draw attention to this disease .
since the closure of the former tro@@ op training place , stab@@ s@@ fel@@ d@@ we@@ bel a. d. ber@@ ni di@@ e@@ ther has been working as a fire@@ work@@ er .
for almost ten years , the former training place in munich has not been used .
nevertheless , there is still a mor@@ tal am@@ m@@ uni@@ tion in the heart of the sw@@ ab@@ ian al@@ b bio@@ sphere reserve every month .
g@@ ren@@ ades are sometimes so dangerous that they have to be blo@@ wn out on the spot .
an ear@@ -@@ stu@@ ff@@ ing ban@@ g h@@ alls the heart of the bio@@ sphere area .
in december 2004 , the last sharp shot hit fell on the m@@ ün@@ sing@@ en tro@@ op training square , which was closed after 1@@ 10 years of military operation at the end of 2005 .
since then , the 6@@ 500 hec@@ tares of the area has been the core of the sw@@ ab@@ ian al@@ b bio@@ sphere reserve , which is open to wal@@ kers and cy@@ cli@@ sts on 13 designated trails .
tax bur@@ dens on business@@ men in washington , with economic recovery , are rising .
economic recovery means more customers , more sales and new jobs .
it also means higher taxes .
government and local tax revenues for domestic companies rose slightly last year , while economic recovery acceler@@ ated , according to a newly published study last week , and firms in the washington area were no exception .
companies in the district , mar@@ y@@ land , and vir@@ g@@ ini@@ a jointly paid $ 2@@ 7.@@ 6 billion to government and local authorities in the 2013 financial year , an increase of 3.@@ 8 % over the revenues of 2012 of $ 2@@ 6.@@ 6 billion .
last year , the public and local tax burden on companies rose by 4.@@ 3 % to $ 6@@ 71 billion , compared to 3.@@ 9 % earlier , and the third con@@ secu@@ tive year in 2009 , following several years of modest growth .
government taxes rose more than local taxes , 4.@@ 3 % , according to the study conducted by the service agency ern@@ st &amp; young with the center for public taxation , a tax policy group .
more than half of the district ’ s tax revenue , 56 % , is corporate taxes , while 36 % of mar@@ y@@ land ’ s revenue comes from companies .
vir@@ g@@ ini@@ a gener@@ ates the lowest tax revenue from companies at 28 percent .
much of the rise in tax revenues is due to a recovery in corporate real estate values , researchers say , which led to a 3.@@ 7 % increase in property taxes this year after the three con@@ secu@@ tive years with growth .
while much of these profits were made by large states such as california , new york , and tex@@ as , the process seems to be in place for the washington area as well .
district , mar@@ y@@ land , and vir@@ g@@ ini@@ a jointly paid over $ 10 billion in government and local real estate taxes last year , compared to $ 9.@@ 6 billion in 2012 – an increase of 4.@@ 2 % over the course of a year .
but the apparent recovery in housing values in mar@@ y@@ land is not so effective in increasing government and local tax revenue , because property taxes account for just over one-@@ fifth of corporate tax revenues .
companies in vir@@ g@@ ini@@ a and d.@@ c. pay almost half of their public and local taxes in the form of real estate taxes .
&quot; in mar@@ y@@ land , a large part of the property , especially in the tax area around d.@@ c. , is owned either by the government or by non-@@ profit organizations that do not pay real estate taxes , &quot; said dou@@ gl@@ as lin@@ d@@ holm business leader .
mar@@ y@@ land is therefore forced to rely much more on income taxes , for example , in order to provide the same services that other states offer .
corporate tax revenue recovery cannot be attribu@@ ted solely to the housing recovery .
company revenues also seem to recover , according to the data .
regional companies reported income taxes on state organizations at $ 2.@@ 3 billion , compared to $ 2.@@ 1 billion in 2012 .
mar@@ y@@ land contributed $ 1 billion in corporate income taxes , the highest amount in the region .
while the trend is in the same direction , the local tax burden on companies does not increase even@@ ly in all three places .
the district ’ s 4.@@ 3 % increase was the national average , while mar@@ y@@ land ’ s rise was significantly higher , 4.@@ 9 % .
only vir@@ g@@ ini@@ a reported a low tax revenue of 4.@@ 1 percent .
vir@@ g@@ ini@@ a has the lowest corporate income tax ( all three have fixed corporate tax rates ) , with 6 % in all three departments .
the mar@@ y@@ land corporate tax rate is 8.@@ 25 % and the district is relatively high , 9.@@ 9@@ 75 % .
a comparable study by the us chamber of commerce at the beginning of this year showed that vir@@ g@@ ini@@ a requires lower government and local company taxes and that overall there is a better tax climate than in mar@@ y@@ land .
the study did not investigate the district .
despite the advantages , vir@@ g@@ ini@@ a is under pressure from its southern neighb@@ our .
north car@@ ol@@ ina has adopted legislation to reduce its corporate tax rates this year from 6.@@ 9 % to 6 % , the same rate as vir@@ g@@ ini@@ a , and the rate will fall to 5 % next year .
if the state continues to achieve its income targets in the coming year , this law could reduce the state ’ s corporate income tax rate to 3 % by 20@@ 17 .
meanwhile , small businesses in the washington area seem to be doing better , and they therefore pay more government and local taxes , according to the latest study .
corporate taxes paid by small business@@ men as personal income taxes – a transitional structure that organized most small enterprises – increased by 20 % in the district , mar@@ y@@ land , and vir@@ g@@ ini@@ a last year to $ 2.@@ 4 billion .
researchers say that the trend and rise in corporate taxes across the country is likely to continue this year , with a 6.@@ 2 % increase in the general tax revenue for the state and local governments in the first quarter of a year .
yet the region could la@@ g behind washington if federal government spending cuts affect the region ’ s labor market .
partner city : german beer for gu@@ ang@@ z@@ ho@@ u
ho@@ ps and mal@@ t - also a popular combination in china .
german beer enjoys an excellent reputation in china .
frankfurt ’ s partner city in china now wants a bre@@ w@@ ery and also hopes for a direct flight connection between the two cities .
german beer , bre@@ wed in frankfurt &apos;s partner city gu@@ ang@@ z@@ ho@@ u - that is the urgent wish of the chinese officials .
&quot; we would be very happy if a german bre@@ w@@ ery would set@@ tle in our city , &quot; said the vice party secretary of the southern chinese metro@@ polis , li yi@@ we@@ i , this week visiting a sp@@ d delegation .
time and again , the chinese communist party ’ s func@@ tion@@ alist came back to this concern of the twel@@ ve-@@ million metro@@ polis during the course of the con@@ vers@@ ation .
gu@@ ang@@ z@@ ho@@ u , also known as can@@ ton in germany , is one of china ’ s rich@@ est cities , li war@@ ned .
that is why people also had the purchasing power to afford german beer .
the hes@@ sian sp@@ d chairman thor@@ ste@@ n sch@@ ä@@ fer@@ -@@ g@@ ü@@ m@@ bel , who led the german political delegation , has told the host that he is going to listen to germany for a possible partner for the project .
&quot; it doesn &apos;t need much beer : good water , cere@@ als and jo@@ ie de vi@@ vre , &quot; he added to the lunch with the party leader in gu@@ ang@@ z@@ ho@@ u .
this jo@@ ie de vi@@ vre already ex@@ u@@ des mr li , he fl@@ at@@ tered the host .
the gu@@ ang@@ z@@ ho@@ u func@@ tion@@ air@@ e then met with sch@@ ä@@ fer@@ -@@ g@@ ü@@ m@@ bel - but with red wine , which was served for food .
the chinese brand t@@ sing@@ ta@@ o is based on german bre@@ wing art .
t@@ sing@@ ta@@ o beer is bre@@ wed according to the german pur@@ ity law .
more business
a second wish of chinese hosts would be a direct flight link between frankfurt and gu@@ ang@@ z@@ ho@@ u , said vice party leader li .
lu@@ f@@ than@@ sa had offered the flight earlier , but cancelled it in 2012 for economic reasons .
&quot; it would be worth it again &quot; , the local politici@@ an expressed his convic@@ tion .
&quot; the traffic between our two cities is increasing all the time &quot; .
currently , travellers would have to take the de@@ tour via chan@@ g@@ sh@@ a in the province of hun@@ an , li compla@@ ined .
the administration of gu@@ ang@@ d@@ ong province , whose capital is gu@@ ang@@ z@@ ho@@ u , also hopes to travel .
chen y@@ un@@ xi@@ an , the provin@@ cial vice govern@@ or , highlighted this wish when he met the social democrats .
&quot; that is a very good idea , &quot; said sch@@ ä@@ fer@@ -@@ g@@ ü@@ m@@ bel , chinese vice minister li j@@ in@@ ju@@ n , an in@@ timate con@@ no@@ iss@@ eur of germany , no@@ d@@ ding in agreement .
partnership in good faith
the le@@ an@@ ing vice party leader of gu@@ ang@@ z@@ ho@@ u hopes to be able to visit frankfurt for a partnership meeting next year .
li yi@@ we@@ i was already on the main , but not yet in this function .
he came into office only this year after his pre@@ dec@@ essor was dis@@ pat@@ ched for alleg@@ ations of corruption .
the local party leader wan q@@ ing@@ lian also had to go .
the fight against the officials from gu@@ ang@@ z@@ ho@@ u is part of a nation@@ wide campaign against corruption in party and administration , which is being en@@ forced with vig@@ our by head of state x@@ i j@@ in@@ ping .
the new leader , li yi@@ we@@ i , had worked for an american company before his party career , which is highly unusual in the chinese communist party .
before taking office in gu@@ ang@@ z@@ ho@@ u , he was a leading fu@@ j@@ ian work@@ er , where the v@@ w automob@@ ile manufacturer e@@ rec@@ ted a major work .
frankfurt has officially entered into more than a do@@ zen tw@@ in@@ ning tw@@ in@@ ning tw@@ in@@ ning tw@@ in@@ ning partnerships .
the connection to the 9@@ 000 km distance of gu@@ ang@@ z@@ ho@@ u is one of those that are maintained by both sides , for example with a student exchange .
last year , the 2@@ 5-@@ year existence of the german@@ -@@ chinese association was celebrated .
the southern chinese metro@@ polis on the per@@ l river is almost as strong with its economic strength as all of h@@ ess@@ en .
next year , it was seeking to achieve a gross domestic product of eur 250 billion , li reported .
the family of jo@@ an rivers &apos; pus@@ hes the thum@@ bs &apos;
jo@@ an rivers has been un@@ conscious since she was ad@@ mitted to hospital in new york city three days ago , but her daughter has now been ho@@ ping that she will recover from her ill@@ ness .
&quot; thanks for your ongoing love and support , &quot; said mel@@ is@@ sa ri@@ vers today in a communication .
we are all keeping our fing@@ ers cros@@ sed .
her mother was re@@ porte@@ dly brought to mount sin@@ ai hospital on thursday after an emergency due to a car@@ di@@ ac condition in a clin@@ ic on the upper east side , yor@@ k@@ ville en@@ do@@ scop@@ y .
doctors deliber@@ ately keep them se@@ aled and under close observation until they are more satisfied with their condition , which is still described as &apos; serious &apos; .
the re@@ actions came from many sides , including an overwhel@@ ming online support from don@@ ald tr@@ um@@ p , mon@@ tel wil@@ liam@@ s and kel@@ ly ri@@ pa .
environmentally friendly vacu@@ um clean@@ ers and rising wages
for cars and vacu@@ um clean@@ ers coming into the market from today , stric@@ ter environmental standards will apply in the future .
similar to re@@ fri@@ ger@@ ators and washing machines , new vacu@@ um clean@@ ers will be issued from 1 september to a label where the purch@@ aser can at a gl@@ ance identify key data such as the device ’ s energy efficiency .
new cars are subject to more str@@ ingent nit@@ ro@@ gen o@@ xide values in the pollu@@ t@@ ant class &apos; euro 6 &apos; .
there is also more money for s@@ ca@@ ff@@ ol@@ ding grow@@ ers : they receive a nation@@ wide minimum wage of eur 10.@@ 25 .
amaz@@ on bu@@ ys t@@ wit@@ ch $ 1.@@ 04 billion
amaz@@ on just confirmed what information reported on monday morning : the online re@@ tail@@ er - and video producer , and a lot of other things - is buying the t@@ wit@@ ch video stre@@ aming service for $ 1.@@ 04 billion ( $ 9@@ 70 million ) .
the announcement comes as a surprise , not because no one expected t@@ wit@@ ch to take over , but because it was widely assumed that you@@ tube would buy the company .
three months ago it looked as if the sale of t@@ wit@@ ch to google &apos;s video service was a cool billion decision , and cooperation seemed natural .
t@@ wit@@ ch , which was founded three years ago as ju@@ st@@ in@@ .@@ tv , was launched as a general stre@@ aming service - a live version of you@@ tube .
instead , it quickly became a platform for players who wanted to publish their bra@@ v@@ ou@@ chers in games , a &quot; you@@ tube for live games &quot; , an in@@ sid@@ er said .
the t@@ wit@@ ch interface .
and &quot; let &apos;s play &quot; , a video gen@@ re in which better knowledge gives the ( mostly older ) games a painting of myster@@ y science theatre , are already very popular on you@@ tube .
it is just that you@@ tube is often called when you want to describe t@@ wit@@ ch , so the message that you@@ tube would buy t@@ wit@@ ch was introduced a bit bo@@ red , a potential tex@@ t@@ book example .
it is a myster@@ y why the you@@ tube deal was not concluded , as the company re@@ porte@@ dly was willing to pay as much as amaz@@ on .
all we know about this at the moment is this statement by em@@ let she@@ ar , president of t@@ wit@@ ch : &quot; we chose amaz@@ on because they believe in our community , they share our values and want to help us there more quickly .
another secret , to be honest , is the incredible success of t@@ wit@@ ch .
for s@@ no@@ bs like me , who say they prefer to play sport rather than watch it , it is difficult to understand the attr@@ action of watching others while playing , rather than taking the control con@@ sole into their hands .
it &apos;s one thing to look over the shoul@@ der of a friend at 3 o &apos;@@ clock in the morning while she s@@ ne@@ aks through resid@@ ent evil , and something quite different , watch a sp@@ inner while he sho@@ ot his head 20 times in a row .
you could see all these games right now .
another problem is that many of the most popular games are now e@@ go games , so watching without control of the perspective can be a really good reci@@ pe for head@@ ache .
i admit that the rapid runs in which the ro@@ ger ban@@ n@@ is@@ sters of our electronic age complete whole games in record time are enter@@ taining .
but as long as there is no play or hum@@ our virtu@@ os@@ ity , its t@@ wit@@ ch channel is probably not so interesting .
but what do ske@@ p@@ tics like me know about it ?
t@@ wit@@ ch is called by 55 million different visitors per month and is the fourth largest source of internet traffic pe@@ aks .
and how exactly does amaz@@ on want to make money from it ?
it &apos;s hard to imagine that t@@ wit@@ ch is integrated in amaz@@ on inst@@ ant video as eleg@@ antly as you@@ tube t@@ wit@@ ch could have s@@ wal@@ low@@ ed .
but t@@ wit@@ ch has something that any company would like : thousands of young men who are promoted as advertising customers .
as the chairman of t@@ wit@@ ch , she@@ ar , said , amaz@@ on and t@@ wit@@ ch &quot; both believe in the future of gaming , &quot; and the medium shows no sign of a shr@@ ink@@ age , not even - as a spec@@ ulation .
on saturday , the castle was a lot of fun .
the concept of the organis@@ ers was right .
despite the heavy rain cast on saturday evening , an estimated 1,@@ 200 music fans came to the open-@@ air festival in the bur@@ g@@ gar@@ ten .
at times , the admission had to be stopped .
&quot; that was an@@ no@@ ying , &quot; said ron se@@ m , one of the organiz@@ ers .
sal@@ wel@@ d@@ ä@@ del l lic@@ ht und fre@@ u@@ en .
two spanish words have been used by ma@@ xi@@ m s@@ ach@@ ra@@ j and ron se@@ m to form the name am@@ ula .
the open air in the sal@@ z@@ w@@ ä@@ de@@ ler bur@@ g@@ gar@@ ten is supposed to radi@@ ate bri@@ ght@@ ness on the day and in the evening through various shows .
well , and the fun is coming anyway .
this was evident in the early days of saturday , when the first visitors turned up for open air .
the organiz@@ ers promised a fe@@ ast for all generations .
and you have succeeded in doing so .
sal@@ z@@ we@@ del@@ er and guests from the surrounding area had become comfortable around the supply stands on the bur@@ g@@ gar@@ ten@@ wi@@ ese .
they followed the first live performances , ro@@ lled with the foot in the beat , enjoyed cool drinks - in short , pure relaxation and enjoy@@ ment were essential .
and that is all right through the generations .
while some people were lying on the white sand car@@ ved on the ceiling at the beach bar , others were consum@@ ing wine in the vin@@ o@@ the@@ que , the young were r@@ aging on the hill .
but even when children are s@@ lim@@ med down , volunte@@ ers had to do their best to help the crow@@ d and to create imag@@ in@@ ative cre@@ ations in the small faces .
the larger players used the k@@ ick@@ er tables or participated in a sk@@ ate@@ board workshop organized by the good@@ foot crew for sal@@ wel@@ d .
until the great rain came .
shortly before 5.@@ 30 p.m. he pr@@ un@@ ed to the visitors , especially families were looking for the space and the dry .
but the attr@@ acti@@ veness of the fe@@ ast did not di@@ min@@ ish this .
&quot; more people came than expected , &quot; said ron se@@ m , who spoke of a &quot; success all along the line &quot; .
so there is no objec@@ tion to a repeat of the big party next year .
although the content and size of the event still need to be worked on , se@@ m made a clear statement to the people &apos;s voice in a first round of sunday .
he said that , in the meantime , the admission had to be stopped .
it seems that the security company had been booked with too little effort .
as a result , some who had already paid did not get to the site .
the response was very good .
in an initial cau@@ tious es@@ timate , the sal@@ z@@ we@@ iler co-@@ organiz@@ er spoke of about 1@@ 200 visitors who took part in the bur@@ g@@ gar@@ ten .
there were problems with sound technology .
the sal@@ z@@ w@@ ä@@ de@@ ler hi@@ p-@@ hop band bloc@@ k@@ s@@ `@@ n@@ `@@ ro@@ x therefore left their performance un@@ ner@@ ved .
the techn@@ ici@@ ans were unable to create a reason@@ ably reasonable sound .
the planned sh@@ ish@@ a loun@@ ges could not be built because the t@@ ents could not be moved to sal@@ wel@@ d due to a ti@@ re break@@ down .
&quot; next year you will be there &quot; , says the organis@@ er .
the first of the am@@ u@@ la@@ -@@ open air was more than successful from the number of visitors .
and that in bad weather .
however , the organis@@ ers made some mistakes which will be dela@@ yed the first time , but which will have to be elimin@@ ated in the second edition .
the organis@@ ers must also take on the social network fac@@ e@@ book .
&quot; sorry , but for 12 euros you just expected more &quot; , says mel@@ ani@@ e me@@ i@@ er on the event page .
&quot; you have taken over a bit , &quot; says e@@ le zim@@ mer@@ mann .
others do not see the initial problems as being so narrow .
i think it is very good that some people are not just st@@ up@@ id , but are also really trying to put something on their feet .

the organis@@ ers now have a year to put an end to these critic@@ isms .
new rad@@ om in ber@@ k@@ um : w@@ ach@@ t@@ berg ’ s land@@ mark shr@@ in@@ ks
this is not the case , as expected .
instead , the piece is waiting to be inser@@ ted into the striking structure .
the action is within the context of a larger measure : almost 50 years after the earth observation rad@@ ar ti@@ ra was established , the shell , called the rad@@ om , is completely renewed .
the new rad@@ om will be slightly smaller than the old one with a di@@ ameter of 4@@ 7.@@ 5 meters .
however , the size remains world record .
the last step to complete the new case is the cap@@ ping exchange .
the upper part of the old shell is separated and removed with a cr@@ ane .
after that , the last quarter of the new shell is set up .
if the weather is present , the action will be launched at the beginning of this week .

will the bur@@ g@@ vere@@ in soon be back on the same line ?
the last time there was a cl@@ ash between the two wol@@ fr@@ at@@ sha@@ user bur@@ g@@ vere@@ ine .
now the boards are thinking about a possible cooperation .
as an example for the reconstruction of wol@@ fr@@ at@@ sha@@ us castle , the late richard di@@ mb@@ ath , former chairman of wol@@ fr@@ at@@ sha@@ user bur@@ g@@ fre@@ un@@ de , led the project in the french gu@@ é@@ del@@ on .
a year ago , there was no good climate between the bur@@ g@@ vere@@ in and the bur@@ g@@ fre@@ un@@ de wol@@ fr@@ at@@ sha@@ us@@ en .
the positions of the wol@@ fr@@ at@@ sha@@ user castle and the possible reconstruction have so far been very different .
the two camps are now moving towards one another : talks are to be held soon on a common approach .
the board of directors tor@@ ste@@ n s@@ j@@ ö@@ berg ( bur@@ g@@ vere@@ in ) and her@@ bert pi@@ ff@@ l ( bur@@ g@@ fre@@ un@@ de ) confirm this at the request of our newspaper .
&quot; i called mr pi@@ ff@@ l and suggested that we could sit down together for once , &quot; s@@ j@@ ö@@ berg said .
he believes that all members of both clubs could pul@@ l together in the future .
we have seen some rapid progress .
while the castle friends had an eye on the reconstruction of the castle at the ber@@ g@@ wal@@ d until the end of the year , the castle club around s@@ j@@ ö@@ berg was the &quot; discovery and experience &quot; for the castle club .
her@@ bert pi@@ ff@@ l , second chairman of the castle friends , was very pleased to hear about the call .
he has been in front of the bur@@ g@@ fre@@ i@@ en since di@@ mb@@ ah ’ s death .
a new chairman is to be found in a general meeting in mid-@@ september .
at the moment , according to the 7@@ 4-@@ year-@@ old , the association has about 40 members .
&quot; after my friend richard di@@ mb@@ ath died , we have let the club &apos;s activities rest out of respect first , &quot; this &quot; period of thought &quot; was necessary to &quot; consider how things could go . &quot;
according to pi@@ ff@@ l , the new chairman should then go into talks with the bur@@ g@@ vere@@ in .
until then , the friends of the castle could also get a current mo@@ od inside their group .
there is not yet a candidate for the presidency , says pi@@ ff@@ l .
&quot; but i am confident that someone will find himself &quot; , he does not want to stand because he is resid@@ ent in bad t@@ ö@@ l@@ z .
the new chairman should be a wol@@ fr@@ at@@ sha@@ user .
the tal@@ el@@ zer wanted to &quot; but would very much like to continue working &quot; on the project .
pi@@ ff@@ l ’ s view of reconstruction will no doubt remain un@@ changed in the near future .
he recogn@@ iz@@ es di@@ mb@@ ath as a &quot; mis@@ sion@@ ary &quot; who always believed in the reconstruction of the castle .
two similar projects , which have already been well advanced in austria and france , would show that this idea is not an air@@ brus@@ h .
they are a tourist attr@@ action thanks to the high participation of the population and by volunte@@ ers from all over the world .
pi@@ ff@@ l : &quot; i too was ske@@ p@@ tical at the beginning .
but over time i have become increasingly convinced that it is sensible to advance the project &quot; , which could create a &quot; unique position &quot; for the city of cast@@ les .
there is nothing else here .
furthermore , the project could be financed by eu grants , visitor tickets and potential spon@@ sors , pi@@ ff@@ l believes .
&quot; i personally do not want to throw the idea of reconstruction out of the window , &quot; he hopes that the bur@@ g@@ vere@@ in may be moving on this point .
their objective of first docum@@ enting history is &quot; important and good &quot; .
we could then go on .
cle@@ ver ways to save on university tex@@ t@@ books
since the cost of university tex@@ t@@ books for many students exce@@ eds $ 1@@ ,000 a year , mat@@ t sch@@ ro@@ e@@ der , a fairly second sem@@ ester student , thought out a cle@@ ver idea .
he inven@@ ted a system of l@@ ending for books by students of higher sem@@ ester and offered nom@@ inal compensation in order to delay res@@ ale .
&quot; my mathem@@ a@@ tical book normally costs $ 18@@ 0 , but i got it for $ 10 for a sem@@ ester and a ch@@ ick fil@@ -@@ a-@@ ke@@ ks , &quot; said sch@@ ro@@ e@@ der , 19 , who visits col@@ a .
the books needed for the last sem@@ ester would have cost him $ 4@@ 30 , he said .
he spent $ 120 .
the college ’ s management announced that the student spent an average of more than $ 1,@@ 200 a year on tex@@ t@@ books and study material , but that there were different cost-@@ reduction options for students .
online stores and creative approaches such as sch@@ ro@@ e@@ ders are increasingly the solution for students .
ren@@ ting tex@@ t@@ books is becoming more popular , allowing students to use a book for a sem@@ ester , often at a much lower price than they would buy .
ne@@ eb@@ o inc , which operates more than 250 university book@@ shops , announced that the hire of tex@@ t@@ books has doub@@ led since 2011 .
industry surve@@ ys show that about a quarter of the books in college book@@ shops were ren@@ ted last spring sem@@ ester , ne@@ e@@ bo@@ s vice president te@@ v@@ or me@@ yer said .
according to the national association of college stores , less than half of all tex@@ t@@ books are bought in camp@@ us book@@ stores .
here is the one time for the best deals .
buy online
some new books cost online only one-@@ third of the price you will be charged for in the camp@@ us book@@ store .
the n@@ in@@ th edition of &quot; calcul@@ us &quot; v@@ no ron lar@@ won , bru@@ ce ed@@ wards and robert ho@@ ste@@ t@@ ler costs almost $ 2@@ 90 , but can be purchased from the specialised tex@@ t@@ book re@@ tail@@ er che@@ gg@@ .com .
buying secon@@ d-@@ hand
if you don &apos;t like the notes of other or normal usage tracks , use books are a good option .
&quot; calcul@@ us &quot; is used on che@@ gg@@ .com for $ 9@@ 3,@@ 49 .
mat@@ t cas@@ a@@ day , 25 gradu@@ ate student at bri@@ g@@ ham young university , says that he spent 42 c@@ ents on amaz@@ on@@ .com for a second issue of strategic media deci@@ sion@@ s. he is a member of the board of directors .
the book was newly sold for $ 48 .
aca@@ dem@@ ics such as ing@@ rid br@@ ac@@ ey , head of the university of mass@@ ach@@ us@@ et@@ ts at am@@ her@@ st college without walls , recommended students to ask their prof@@ ess@@ ors whether past issues were per@@ mis@@ sible .
sometimes the updates are not relevant for the seminar work .
in such cases , older issues can often be purchased for a fr@@ action of the cost of the latest issue .
besides che@@ g@@ g and amaz@@ on , hal@@ f@@ .com from e@@ bay inc is a popular alternative for used books .
ren@@ ts
the ren@@ ting of tex@@ t@@ books is worth considering if you treat them reason@@ ably well , remember to return them and you do not want to keep the books after the course is completed .
you can save more than 80 percent of the costs of a new book .
a student could rent &quot; calcul@@ us &quot; for about $ 20 for a sem@@ ester .
find out about the terms of the business where you rent , including the penalties that may apply to writing notes , under@@ sco@@ res or usage tracks .
ten@@ ants pay attention : if you do not return the book , the penalty fees may even exceed the price of a new book .
e-@@ books
e-@@ books are also an option rather than conventional tex@@ t@@ books .
sometimes these books are ren@@ ted de fac@@ to by providing an electronic license for a certain period by whol@@ es@@ al@@ ers such as amaz@@ on@@ .com , che@@ g@@ g and bar@@ nes &amp; no@@ ble inc .
at che@@ g@@ g you can rent &quot; cal@@ cul@@ us &quot; for 6 months for about $ 61 .
br@@ ac@@ ey says that students often find the best offers in literature courses , because many classi@@ cs can be downloaded free of charge nowadays , while scientific and engineering tex@@ t@@ books can be very expensive .
look around in any case .
jo@@ e ga@@ ult , 29 , who will shortly be atten@@ ding the pe@@ p@@ per@@ d@@ ine law school , recomm@@ ends the is@@ b@@ n number for book pric@@ ing , as you can be sure to find the right teaching book .
and before placing an online order , you should check , gau@@ lt says , whether the book is actually available .
he learned this lesson on the hard tour .
he bought a book that had four weeks delivery and finally paid the full price in the college book@@ store .
why &quot; guar@@ di@@ ans of the gal@@ ax@@ y &quot; was not a cash hit ?
sy@@ l@@ v@@ ester stone &apos;s ex@@ p@@ end@@ ables 3 played less than $ 30 million of its $ 90 million budget in the us , while s@@ in city : a lady to kill for only $ 70 million .
the movie &quot; sex tape &quot; , tailored to camer@@ on di@@ a@@ z , was only $ 14@@ .@@ 6 million on the opening weekend , while children &apos;s films like &quot; drag@@ on cases made easy 2 &quot; also received revenue .
an article by the cri@@ tic of tele@@ graph fil@@ m@@ maker rob@@ bi@@ e col@@ lin suggests that the lack of quality in the films itself could be the reason for children &apos;s films .
col@@ lin described 20@@ 14 as &quot; the worst year &quot; so far for children &apos;s films and described &quot; drag@@ on t@@ um@@ ble 2 &quot; as a purely &quot; functional &quot; fant@@ as@@ y sequ@@ el .
however , when it comes to films for a slightly older target group , it seems that the quality of films is not necessarily the problem .
in july , entertainment weekly compared the average cinem@@ as@@ co and me@@ ta@@ cri@@ tic rating for each summer film start , which was shown between american mem@@ orial day and july 20 , 2013 and the current year .
the results are based on the opinion of the cinema visitors and film cri@@ tics and indicate that this year &apos;s film h@@ its are equivalent to those of last year .
some comm@@ ent@@ ators believe that the development is due to changing visual hab@@ its and the growing popul@@ arity of web stre@@ aming services like net@@ f@@ li@@ x .
director j@@ on fav@@ re@@ au , who is currently working on dis@@ ney &apos;s upcoming jun@@ g@@ le book film , said to the ho@@ ll@@ y@@ wood re@@ porter website : &quot; i think times are changing . &quot;
we must accept this and not try to follow the past .
in contrast to the currently weak cash out@@ comes of ho@@ ll@@ y@@ wood produc@@ tions , net@@ f@@ li@@ x has recently generated sales of $ 1.@@ 2 billion in stre@@ aming content , almost twice as much as $ 8@@ 37 million in previous years .
last summer , director ste@@ ven spi@@ el@@ berg cri@@ tici@@ zed film studios for focusing too much on com@@ ics and predic@@ ting a &quot; mel@@ t@@ down &quot; of ho@@ ll@@ y@@ wood .
in the light of the current down@@ turn , some comm@@ ent@@ ators argue that his glo@@ om@@ y pro@@ ph@@ ec@@ y may well contain a true core .
however , due to the potential cas@@ hi@@ ers expected in the summer of 20@@ 15 , including av@@ eng@@ ers : age of ul@@ tr@@ on , mini@@ ons and jur@@ as@@ sic world , other representatives of the film industry are more optim@@ istic .
the producer of x-@@ men , sim@@ on kin@@ berg , described the decline in cash out@@ comes recently as simply &quot; cy@@ clic@@ al &quot; and said to ho@@ ll@@ y@@ wood re@@ porter : &quot; next summer &apos;s biggest store will be in the o@@ ft .
when , a few years ago , the second table tennis district class was abol@@ ished to stre@@ am@@ line the lig@@ en division , this was a step in the right direction .
the german table tennis federation has now launched an additional third bun@@ des@@ lig@@ a .
as a result , those who did not clim@@ b up have gone down .
in the first season , g@@ ö@@ tt@@ ingen &apos;s top class team tor@@ pe@@ do avoided the down@@ ward slo@@ pe , but only plays five classi@@ cs .
tor@@ pe@@ do &apos;s ladies remain fourth classi@@ cs , despite their grand break@@ through into the regional league .
the bo@@ ys and girls of tor@@ pe@@ do start in the lower sa@@ x@@ ony league , as well as the bo@@ ys of the s@@ c we@@ en@@ de .
the s@@ g len@@ gl@@ ers and the tor@@ pe@@ do reserve are entering the new ver@@ band league , the league no longer has g@@ ö@@ tt@@ ingen clubs in it .
the german national team is the german national team of the german bun@@ des@@ lig@@ a .
what looks like a better district class is now the new district league south .
the t@@ sv se@@ ul@@ ingen , v@@ f@@ b l@@ ö@@ d@@ ing@@ sen , tor@@ pe@@ do iii , ge@@ is@@ mar , ein@@ bec@@ k , ham@@ men@@ ste@@ dt , bo@@ ven@@ der sv , lan@@ gen@@ hol@@ ten@@ sen and the f@@ c .
the district sli@@ ga is home to regional representatives d@@ ran@@ s@@ fel@@ d and s@@ c we@@ en@@ de , in the district class of tt@@ c ii , ro@@ t-@@ wei@@ ß , bo@@ ven@@ der sv ii and the teams of tt@@ c ii .
g@@ ün@@ ter@@ sen , tt@@ c and tt@@ v ge@@ is@@ mar ii are here to play .
tor@@ pe@@ do iii and sat@@ ten@@ haus@@ en / w@@ ö@@ ll@@ mar@@ sha@@ us@@ en are starting up in the district sli@@ ga .
with nine teams each
the s@@ c we@@ en@@ de sen@@ ds its girls to the small district sli@@ ga .
the sc@@ w bo@@ ys &apos; district sli@@ ga squ@@ ad@@ ron - which is still starting tor@@ pe@@ do ii - is not complete either .
in a district class , the season is marked by ge@@ is@@ mar , tus@@ po we@@ en@@ de and bo@@ ven@@ der sv .
in the first season of the newly founded regional association , the two go@@ tt@@ ingen circu@@ lar le@@ ag@@ ues start with nine teams .
the west season includes the re@@ d-@@ white ii , bo@@ ven@@ der sv iii , lau@@ bach ii , tor@@ pe@@ do iv and v , m@@ tv gr@@ one , d@@ ran@@ s@@ fel@@ der s@@ c ii , mi@@ el@@ en@@ haus@@ en ii .
the eastern season features sat@@ ten@@ haus@@ en / w@@ ö@@ ll@@ mar@@ sha@@ us@@ en , ni@@ ko@@ la@@ us@@ berg and land@@ ol@@ f@@ sha@@ us@@ en .
the women &apos;s kre@@ is@@ lig@@ a consists of sat@@ ten@@ haus@@ en / w@@ ö@@ ll@@ mar@@ sha@@ us@@ en ii , bil@@ sha@@ us@@ en , hem@@ el@@ n , se@@ ul@@ ingen ii , tus@@ po we@@ en@@ de and s@@ g r@@ hu@@ me .
this is still better than in the eas@@ ter district , where there are no women teams at the cir@@ c@@ us level .
it is striking that none of the six 2nd circle categories achieve target strength , and here the innovative and ex@@ hau@@ sting circle board will have to think about .
nato summit : first pro@@ tests in new@@ port and car@@ di@@ ff
at the weekend , there were pro@@ tests from oppon@@ ents of the nato summit in new@@ port .
on saturday hundreds of people gathered in the centre of new@@ port for an anti-@@ nato march .
on sunday , about 150 people met in car@@ di@@ ff in front of the town hall to hold a so-called counter@@ -@@ summit .
ste@@ ph@@ en fair@@ cl@@ ough followed the weekend developments and spoke to demonstr@@ ators who travell@@ ed to belgium from brid@@ ging .

wor@@ ried rela@@ tives called the police at about 8 p.m. when the two had not returned home .
a local police and rescue team search team bro@@ ke up and the couple was found at around 11 p.m. near the bri@@ dal ve@@ il water@@ falls .
the girl had been si@@ ck and the man had fallen and had raised his head .
rescue forces remained with the couple over@@ night , and they were flo@@ wn out on monday morning .
they were in stable condition and were delivered to the blue mountains hospital with a am@@ bul@@ ance .
anti-@@ government pro@@ tests in pakistan es@@ cal@@ ate
the approximately 1000 demonstr@@ ators were pus@@ hed by soldiers from the p@@ tv building , said information minister per@@ v@@ ai@@ z r@@ as@@ hi@@ d .
the trans@@ mit@@ ter re@@ sumed the broad@@ cast after just over half an hour .
p@@ tv director ath@@ ar far@@ o@@ q said that the demonstr@@ ators equipped with stic@@ ks damaged equipment in the ed@@ it@@ orial .
no dead or in@@ ju@@ red were reported .
the demonstr@@ ators are calling for the re@@ sign@@ ation of the head of government , to whom they acc@@ use electoral fraud .
the police reported that approximately one kil@@ ome@@ tre from the residence of prime minister na@@ wa@@ z shar@@ if had been the result of a cl@@ ash of around 3@@ 000 demonstr@@ ators with security forces on monday .
according to hospital data , a polic@@ em@@ an was in@@ ju@@ red .
at least three people had been killed and more than 500 in@@ ju@@ red at the weekend when demonstr@@ ators tried to get into shar@@ if &apos;s residence .
you are calling for the re@@ sign@@ ation of the prime minister .
on sunday evening , after a meeting in the army headquarters , the powerful military called for a political solution to the conflict , &apos; without wa@@ sting time and using force &apos; .
the communication also said : &apos; the army remains committed to its role of ensuring the security of the state &apos; .
es@@ cal@@ ating violence has fu@@ elled concern about the military intervention , which has already been more frequent in the past .
the pro@@ tests led by opposition politici@@ an im@@ ran kh@@ an and the pre@@ ach@@ er ta@@ h@@ ir@@ u@@ l q@@ ad@@ ri have continued since independence day on 14 august .
shar@@ if ref@@ uses to resi@@ gn .
kh@@ an and q@@ ad@@ ri had called on their sup@@ porters to persi@@ st on sunday .
&quot; we will not go back without having forced shar@@ if to resi@@ gn , &quot; kh@@ an said .
q@@ ad@@ ri spoke the same way .
kh@@ an acc@@ uses shar@@ if of having won the parliamentary election last may by fraud .
q@@ ad@@ ri calls for the re@@ sign@@ ation of central and provin@@ cial governments .
then a transitional government is to reform the electoral system and call for new elections .
more than 40 000 security forces are in operation to protect the district of government .
the demonstr@@ ators had initially been peace@@ fully in front of parliament until kh@@ an and q@@ ad@@ ri ur@@ ged them to move to shar@@ if ’ s residence this weekend .
h@@ ü@@ t@@ tel@@ dor@@ fer after second season victory on third place of the table .
with the 2 : 0 over gr@@ ö@@ di@@ g , a bit@@ ter week on sunday , a happy ending for rapid .
&quot; the victory is very liber@@ ating , &quot; said tra@@ iner z@@ or@@ an b@@ ari@@ sic , whose team with the out in the europe league on thursday had reached an intermedi@@ ate low .
&quot; the success experience was incredi@@ bly important , &quot; confirmed captain and sho@@ o@@ ter ste@@ ff@@ en ho@@ f@@ mann , who took the green and white lead to three ahead .
sch@@ ram@@ mel@@ -@@ dre@@ am@@ tor spe@@ aks up to the winner stra@@ ß@@ e rapi@@ d , who has shown the right response to the dis@@ appointment with hel@@ sin@@ ki with a successful break in the country with the second season victory .
&quot; we wanted to show a positive response , &quot; said the secretary of state thomas sch@@ ram@@ me@@ l , who , with his magnificent leadership vol@@ ley from the six@@ teenth minute , set the course for victory .
&quot; i thought i had all the fru@@ its of thursday and s@@ no@@ wn him under the bar , &quot; said the 26 year-@@ old s@@ mil@@ ing .
when sch@@ ram@@ me@@ l had met for the last time in a bun@@ des@@ lig@@ a match on 13 nov@@ em@@ ber@@ . that was still for ried .
the first championship match in the rapid d@@ ress will therefore remain in special memory .
&quot; for me this is something very special , i am from the rapid young man , &quot; said sch@@ ram@@ me@@ l .
due to mari@@ o pa@@ ve@@ lic ’ s short-term bec@@ k b@@ lis@@ s@@ ary , the left has moved to the right def@@ ensive side of the co@@ at of arms and made his case very well there .
he has had enough experience to be able to play this role in a mirror in@@ verse way .
he earned the goal , he already provided some assi@@ sts this year , &quot; p@@ raised b@@ ari@@ sic .
team shows character sch@@ ram@@ me@@ l also delivered the f@@ lan@@ k to 2 : 0 by ho@@ f@@ mann after a little hour that finally brought the decision .
the hotel was very clean and the staff were very friendly and helpful .
&quot; thank god we have had some lu@@ ck today , &quot; also said sch@@ ram@@ me@@ l , who always played with it the cl@@ ash of performance and result in the last few weeks : &quot; the results have not been good , but the game was good .
b@@ ari@@ sic even found that &quot; in many games before , you were better than today &quot; , against &quot; the strong@@ est team that played this season at this sta@@ dium &quot; .
the first tri@@ -@@ point since 26 july has therefore proved that the team structure is int@@ act against the set@@ backs : &apos; today my team has shown that it has character &apos; .
he is no less happy : &quot; we have finally played again to zero &quot; .
the most important thing to do during the national break is that with bri@@ an beh@@ ren@@ dt , mari@@ o pa@@ ve@@ lic , chri@@ stop@@ her di@@ bon , den@@ i al@@ ar and michael sch@@ imp@@ el@@ s@@ ber@@ ger , they are several more .
&quot; we must not forget that , &quot; bar@@ i@@ sic , who lost with co@@ ve@@ ted and pa@@ ve@@ lic players in the last three days , &quot; who have been very stable recently &quot; .
the inter@@ val must therefore be used to lic@@ k w@@ ounds and to increase the physical range , &quot; said b@@ ari@@ sic , who has five u@@ 21 players in his range .
one that is particularly well placed for the break is captain ho@@ f@@ mann .
he te@@ ars himself for the team , passes over pain .
especially in this difficult phase he showed that he is a very important player for us , &quot; noted b@@ ari@@ sic .
ho@@ f@@ mann gave the game rapi@@ ds before its replacement in the 6@@ 8@@ th minute not only the structure but also achieved the second goal .
for the 3@@ 3-@@ year-@@ old who completed his 3@@ 50@@ th bun@@ des@@ lig@@ a game , it was the first match from the game since november 2 , 2013 ( 4 : 2 via the ad@@ mir@@ a ) .
ho@@ f@@ mann : &quot; may not believe that now everything is good &quot; &quot; we have certainly had some lu@@ ck , but at some point the lu@@ ck must come back to us .
now it was high time , &quot; said ho@@ f@@ mann .
he ad@@ mon@@ ished , however , that he would continue to work in a focused manner : &quot; one cannot always see it in black and white .
we have not played as badly in the last few weeks as has been pointed out .
but we must not believe that everything is good now .
he could not deny the importance of his role for the team .
it is a very young team , and i can help very much at the moment .
they are still keeping to me in certain stages , &quot; said ho@@ f@@ mann .
gr@@ ö@@ di@@ g-@@ co@@ ach michael bau@@ r had little to re@@ pro@@ ach himself and his team .
he regre@@ t@@ ted the quick &quot; magic gate &quot; counter@@ -@@ strike , as well as the regular gate of nu@@ tz in the 40@@ th minute un@@ ju@@ stly denied by re@@ fe@@ ree k@@ ol@@ ler .
the only criticism i can make of the team is that we were not concrete enough in some stages towards tor .
we have had too few conclusions on this .
internal def@@ en@@ der maxim@@ ili@@ an kar@@ ner saw it as similar : &quot; it started badly , but then we found it in and even made a gate .
by and large , more would have been in it .
under this wh@@ i@@ ff , ru@@ h re@@ ign@@ s
we showed a powerful tri@@ be in our pu@@ zz@@ le task of the summer series &quot; my piece of the rhe@@ on@@ er gl@@ ü@@ ck &quot; last friday .
several of these giant trees are still in the county , the illustra@@ ted copy is the &quot; s@@ cour@@ ge ru@@ hei@@ che &quot; above un@@ ter@@ wei@@ ß@@ en@@ brun@@ n .
a bu@@ mp@@ y foot@@ path leads up to the approximately 600 years old o@@ ak .
it passes by cou@@ ples , bas@@ alt mines and bas@@ alt me@@ ado@@ ws .
a little bit below the quar@@ ry of the bau@@ er@@ s@@ berg , one kil@@ ome@@ tre north of the road to we@@ is@@ bach , she stands there .
the natural mon@@ ument is vital , it stret@@ ches out over the other trees in the area and , with a volume of more than eight metres , is remin@@ is@@ cent of an american m@@ am@@ mo@@ th tree .
a small bud@@ d@@ ha on a tree mu@@ d indicates that it is a spiritual or my@@ s@@ tical place .
but , despite intensive research , there was only evidence of the name origin@@ s .
dr. wol@@ f@@ gan@@ g sch@@ nei@@ der consulted the bis@@ ch@@ of@@ sh@@ ei@@ m archive and consulted elderly people from un@@ ter@@ wei@@ ß@@ en@@ brun@@ n to find out what their relationship with the s@@ cour@@ ge was .
the result of his research remained the rather so@@ ber explanation for the name .
thus , until about 80 years ago , go@@ at she@@ ph@@ er@@ ds were supposed to drive their animals from under@@ wei@@ ß@@ en@@ brun@@ n to me@@ ado@@ ws that were ti@@ red and cut off from stones .
at the foot of the tree , the animal ke@@ ep@@ ers exhaus@@ ted by the as@@ cent are said to have rested .

after weeks of tu@@ g-@@ of-@@ war , italy ’ s premier and current eu chairman , mat@@ te@@ o ren@@ zi , was nom@@ inated for foreign policy by eu secretary feder@@ ica mo@@ gh@@ er@@ i in the eu special summit last week , against strong conservative opposition .
ren@@ zi , as the govern@@ ment@@ -@@ oriented daily la re@@ pub@@ b@@ lic@@ a re@@ states , regards the appointment of his mo@@ gh@@ er@@ ini , also considered in the government team as a fav@@ ori@@ tes , as a strengthening of the social democrats &apos; position .
he also exp@@ ects a boost for his &quot; reform package &quot; in italy .
last but not least , ren@@ zi hopes that the lef@@ t-@@ wing party base , which is constantly rising against him , will be put on a calm foot@@ ing , because mo@@ gh@@ er@@ ini will be assigned to it , albeit in a moderate way .
to the conservative representatives , with president je@@ an-@@ cla@@ ude jun@@ ck@@ er and the po@@ le don@@ ald tus@@ k , nom@@ inated as president of the council , the prevail@@ ing opinion in rome was to achieve political balance .
the eu &apos;s chief diplom@@ at will also be the depu@@ ty president of the commission , mr jun@@ ck@@ er .
the european parliament &apos;s outstanding consent is deemed to be secure .
otherwise , president gi@@ or@@ gio na@@ polit@@ ano would hardly have called the nom@@ ination of the 4@@ 1@@ year-@@ old politici@@ an of the ruling democratic party ( p@@ d ) an &quot; important recognition &quot; of italy &apos;s role in the eu .
la re@@ pub@@ b@@ lic@@ a is spre@@ ading optim@@ ism that the mo@@ gh@@ er@@ ini , which has been proven in leading party offices for almost two decades and known for their ambition , will be able to cope with the &quot; enormous challenges &quot; .
the born roman is married and has two dau@@ gh@@ ters .
the political scienti@@ st began her career in 1996 in the youth organization of the then democr@@ at di s@@ ini@@ stra ( lef@@ t-@@ wing democrats ) , which joined the catho@@ lic center party in 2008 .
in 1999 , mo@@ gh@@ er@@ ini became vice-president of the european community organisation of soci@@ alist youth ( european young socialists ) for three years .
in 2001 , she joined the lef@@ t-@@ wing party council , becoming a high-@@ party political figure , working in the foreign policy department , whose leader she soon became .
it occupied traditional priorities of italian foreign policy , such as the middle east , was known by studies of nato dep@@ loy@@ ment in afghanistan , in which italy was involved with a cont@@ ingent , maintaining contacts with the socialists in europe and the social democrats .
since 2008 she has been a member of the chamber of depu@@ ties , where she is an expert on defence and european and international affairs .
when ren@@ zi became prime minister in february 20@@ 14 , he appointed mo@@ gh@@ er@@ ini as foreign minister .
if the p@@ d has a better relationship with the country ’ s strong peace movement , which contributed to the party ’ s more than 40 % vote in the may eu elections , then it has , as p@@ d feder@@ i notes , a por@@ tion .
the re@@ pro@@ aches in brussels , which the new eu foreign affairs representative has too little diplomatic experience , which is to say , a lack of substance , are being mis@@ represented in the p@@ d .
in brussels , particularly by poland and the baltic members , mo@@ gh@@ er@@ in@@ is , who are susp@@ ici@@ ously realistic , are being persecu@@ ted for the crisis in ukraine and de@@ fam@@ ed as a &apos; pro-@@ russia course &apos; .
it supports the russian company ga@@ z@@ pro@@ m &apos;s pipel@@ ine south stream , which is to transport russian natural gas directly to southern europe , by@@ passing ukraine , and this is also in the interests of energy security italy .
after ren@@ zi took office as eu president in july , mo@@ gh@@ er@@ ini travel@@ ed to moscow for her first state visit .
photos that you showed with putin at the sha@@ ke hands were taken in brussels with indi@@ gn@@ ation , as were the invitation of the kre@@ m@@ lin chief to hold an economic summit in milan in october .
a total of nine young people started their training at em@@ z-@@ han@@ au@@ er in n@@ ab@@ burg on monday .
among them is an az@@ u@@ bi , who has already completed a different training in the company .
the new employees will be active in four training occup@@ ations : electronics ( three tra@@ ine@@ es ) , mec@@ hat@@ ron@@ ics ( two ) , tool mechan@@ ics ( two ) and process mechan@@ ics ( two ) .
all az@@ u@@ b@@ is come from sch@@ wan@@ dorf county : to@@ bi@@ as bra@@ un and thomas b@@ ü@@ cher@@ l from sch@@ war@@ z@@ ach , ste@@ fan br@@ ick@@ l and fl@@ ori@@ an re@@ wit@@ zer from sch@@ mid@@ ga@@ den , joh@@ ann@@ es .
the new ap@@ pre@@ n@@ tic@@ es were previously atten@@ ding primary and secondary schools and real schools .
from wednesday to friday , ap@@ pre@@ n@@ tic@@ es of all v@@ int@@ ages and tra@@ in@@ ers will be riding to a team training event in ob@@ er@@ am@@ mer@@ ga@@ u , where among other things a full-@@ day hi@@ ke and ra@@ fting on the inn are offered .
the company has 4@@ 35 employees throughout germany and 9@@ 50 employees worldwide .
the number of tra@@ ine@@ es distributed over all v@@ int@@ ages is 27 .
the socialists in france should &apos; keep their mou@@ ths and put france in order &apos; , said fran@@ co@@ is hol@@ lan@@ de &apos;s main ally .
mr v@@ alls called on the deeply divided left to show &apos; their love &apos; for the controversial socialist president whose cab@@ in@@ et re@@ formation has met with dis@@ approval by the vast majority of the french .
the president deserves everyone &apos;s respect , he deserves our loy@@ alty and he deserves our support .
&quot; it is our duty to stay on his side , &quot; he said with great applause .
as a so@@ ber@@ ing ge@@ st@@ ure , the prime minister insi@@ sted that his government should ask the controversial 3@@ 5-@@ hour week in france despite strong calls for the regime to be relaxed by em@@ manu@@ el mac@@ ron , not the new economic minister .
on saturday , mr hol@@ lan@@ de ur@@ ged his fellow socialists to show &apos; united &apos; with the government .
but christi@@ ane tau@@ bir@@ a , the minister of justice , was pul@@ ling sand into the gear , where she appeared at a meeting of dis@@ mis@@ sive socialist members , and the socialist party cri@@ tici@@ zed her for believ@@ ing that they should believe .
marine le pen , the far-@@ right leader of the national front , mo@@ c@@ ked the socialists ’ constant ri@@ oting and said that she could not imagine the new v@@ alls government going on for longer than a few months .
fran@@ co@@ is hol@@ lan@@ de is the emper@@ or without clothes , but prin@@ ce manu@@ el v@@ alls has no , they are forced to form a new government if the old one has not survi@@ ved even a summer .
&quot; and the new one will not survive the autumn or winter , &quot; said miss le pen to sup@@ porters .
she repeated her party ’ s call for a dis@@ solution of parliament and said she was confident that she would win in early elections and be ready to government .
the french ruling party suffered a defe@@ at in the local elections in march , and the right-@@ wing national front was ahead of the eu elections in may .
a po@@ ll in the sunday newspaper journal du di@@ man@@ che found that 76 % of french people believe that the socialist party is at risk of falling into several groups before the end of hol@@ lan@@ de ’ s term in 20@@ 17 .
pas@@ cal per@@ r@@ in@@ ea@@ u , a political scienti@@ st at sciences po university , war@@ ned that the french would quickly lose pati@@ ence if the new socialist government did not pay a better contribution to the economy and to the record .
&quot; there is a small window of opportunity , but public opinion must feel quickly that things change , &quot; he war@@ ned .
otherwise , the situation could deterior@@ ate further .

a pe@@ king@@ -@@ loy@@ al group sw@@ ung the chinese flag near the hotel .
the permanent committee of the national people ’ s congress adopted a framework law on sunday that allows only two or three candidates for the hong kong leadership election in 20@@ 17 .
all candidates must first obtain the majority support of a nom@@ ination committee , which is expected to be filled with pe@@ king@@ -@@ loy@@ al members .
this decision makes it almost impossible for opposition democrats to be allowed to vote , promp@@ ting pro-@@ democracy activi@@ sts to per@@ cei@@ ve their threat and to “ create an occup@@ y central square ” with its “ occup@@ y central square ” pro@@ tests .
political reform has long been a controversial issue in hong kong ; and china ’ s party leaders fear that calls for democracy will spread to other cities .

putin is asking ki@@ e@@ v to open &quot; state@@ -@@ relations talks &quot; with eastern ukraine .
russian president v@@ la@@ di@@ mir putin , according to russian media reports , demanded on sunday that the ukra@@ inian government ce@@ ase fighting the separ@@ ati@@ sts in the east and immediately dis@@ engage with negotiations on the &quot; state@@ hood &quot; of the country .
his spo@@ kes@@ man , di@@ mit@@ ri pes@@ ko@@ v , later made it clear that putin did not mean that the separ@@ ati@@ st territory of eastern russia would be part of russia &apos;s power , but that its status vis@@ -@@ à@@ -@@ vis its status .
putin ’ s call for the ki@@ e@@ v government to negotiate on an equal foot@@ ing with the pro-@@ russian insur@@ g@@ ents f@@ its into the strategy that he has apparently pursued since the beginning of the ri@@ ots five months ago : helping ukraine ’ s separ@@ ati@@ st .
in an interview with the state television channel one , putin condemned the ukra@@ inian military campaign to re@@ con@@ qu@@ er the territories held by separ@@ ati@@ sts in the eastern regions of don@@ et@@ sk and lu@@ han@@ sk , which was taken in march 18@@ .
the kre@@ m@@ lin and the separ@@ ati@@ sts have recently called the area taken the &quot; nov@@ or@@ os@@ si@@ ya &quot; or &quot; ne@@ ur@@ us@@ sia &quot; , a term remin@@ is@@ cent of the pre-@@ revolutionary gl@@ ory of the russian empire .
&quot; while government groups in the separ@@ ati@@ st territories are ho@@ ping to attack civilian communities in the promised peace areas , &quot; putin pointed out that all those who campaign@@ ed for the 26 october elections were in the course of ukra@@ inian politicians &apos; campaigns .
&quot; we must start detailed discussions immediately , not only on technical issues , but also on the political organisation of society and the state status of south-@@ eastern ukraine , in order to protect the interests of the people living there , &quot; he said .
pes@@ ko@@ v said that putin ’ s reference to state@@ hood must be seen in the context of greater autonomy , which has been under discussion for months by the ki@@ e@@ v leadership , to wor@@ ries about their cl@@ us@@ ter areas .
only the ukra@@ inian government can give the eastern territories the necessary autonomy , pes@@ ko@@ v said .
it is not a matter of negotiations between ukraine and russia , he said , &apos; because it is not a conflict between russia and ukraine , but an internal conflict in ukraine &apos; .
the kre@@ m@@ lin &apos;s clari@@ fication of correc@@ ting the mis@@ interpretation of putin &apos;s remarks under@@ lined russia &apos;s leadership over the treatment of separ@@ ati@@ st re@@ bel@@ lion in the east , unlike direct ethnic ne@@ gation .
moscow would have far greater difficulty anne@@ x@@ ing the regions of don@@ et@@ sk and lu@@ han@@ sk to eastern ukraine , as most of the 6.@@ 5 million inhabitants are not rus@@ sians and surve@@ ys from the period before the conflict left broad a majority .
the autonomy mentioned by russian diplom@@ ats at international forums would give the regional governments in ukraine the power to negotiate their own trade agreements and external relations , thus giving the kre@@ m@@ lin de fac@@ to control over a territory of russia .
the black sea peninsula , anne@@ xed five months ago , is the home port for most of the russian na@@ vy , as well as an important commercial port and historic coastal region .
the regions between russia ’ s ro@@ sto@@ v region and cri@@ me@@ a are also rich in mines , fac@@ tories , and foun@@ dri@@ es that produce important components for the russian military .
ukra@@ inian president pe@@ tr@@ o por@@ o@@ sh@@ en@@ ko , when he spoke on june 7 , suggested that ukra@@ inian legislation - after elections - should consider constitutional amendments , giving greater control to the respective territories .
but his idea of autonomy seems to be in sharp contrast to that of the kre@@ m@@ lin and the separ@@ ati@@ st re@@ be@@ ls , whose arm@@ ament and inci@@ tement moscow is accused of .
putin ’ s last call for ki@@ e@@ v to negotiate with separ@@ ati@@ st leaders on an equal foot@@ ing followed a further inv@@ asion of the re@@ be@@ ls last week , after russian troops and tan@@ ks inv@@ aded the region previously .
the separ@@ ati@@ sts , supported by russia , took over the hand@@ ful , which , according to fears of ukra@@ inian security officials , is the first step in a campaign to take over the strategic coastal region to cri@@ me@@ a , control of no@@ vo@@ az@@ ov .
for this reason , massive civilian and military preparations have been under way to establish mari@@ u@@ pol , a steel industry with 5@@ 00@@ ,000 inhabitants , which is located between no@@ vo@@ az@@ ov and the sch@@ n@@ ö@@ n@@ ch .
por@@ o@@ sh@@ en@@ ko spoke at a meeting of eu leaders in brussels on saturday , ur@@ ging action to prevent another russian aggres@@ sion against ukraine , a former soviet republic that has been independent for 23 years .
&quot; we are about to come back to a point where there is no going back , &quot; war@@ ned por@@ o@@ sh@@ en@@ ko .
thousands of foreign troops and hundreds of foreign tan@@ ks are now on the territory of ukraine .
the eu summit did not decide on concrete actions , and the leadership demanded the drafting of further sanctions against russia , which would enter into force in the event of an un@@ specified es@@ cal@@ ation of the ukra@@ inian crisis .
ukra@@ inian soldiers had to withdraw from their positions in il@@ o@@ wa@@ j@@ sk after two russian tan@@ k colon@@ ies and 1@@ ,000 soldiers entered the danube region last week to support the be@@ sie@@ ged ukra@@ inian separ@@ ati@@ st .
the first probably 63 ukra@@ inian soldiers , who were tr@@ app@@ ed by the russian inv@@ asion of il@@ o@@ wa@@ j@@ sk , were ex@@ changed on sunday for 10 russian par@@ ach@@ ute ships who were caught in ukra@@ inian territory a week ago .

the film city is in a state of up@@ set after a series of clear photos of a j@@ enni@@ fer law@@ rence appeared in a h@@ ack@@ ing@@ s@@ kan@@ dal around cele@@ bri@@ ties on the internet .
the h@@ ack@@ er responsible probably has 60 na@@ ked photos from law@@ rence , star from &quot; the tri@@ bu@@ ts of pan@@ em &quot; and super@@ stars , including the models k@@ ate up@@ ton and car@@ a de@@ anna .
austr@@ ali@@ an actors te@@ res@@ a pal@@ mer , em@@ ily brow@@ ning , y@@ v@@ on@@ ne stra@@ ho@@ v@@ ski , and g@@ rec@@ ko from mel@@ bour@@ ne sup@@ pos@@ ed@@ ly also published private photos on the basis of an ic@@ l@@ oud gap .
there are 10@@ 1 cele@@ bri@@ ties on the list .
most no@@ ble , who had been in love with g@@ rec@@ ko last month , said to confi@@ d@@ enti@@ al : &quot; it is dis@@ gu@@ sting . &quot;
all private letters and pictures should remain private .
it is a dis@@ gr@@ ace that private information can be sto@@ len and passed on to others .
g@@ rec@@ ko , in new york at the moment , reported that a news website said that the h@@ ack was &quot; sh@@ ame@@ ful &quot; and that the people concerned felt &quot; in@@ ju@@ red &quot; .
the h@@ ack@@ er probably has 30 images of pal@@ mer with her ex@@ -@@ friend scot@@ t spe@@ ed@@ man , including two rec@@ ord@@ ings where she is in the top without a pool .
pal@@ mers &apos; films include &quot; love is inv@@ inci@@ ble &quot; with li@@ am hem@@ s@@ worth .
pal@@ mer , ch@@ uc@@ k-@@ star stra@@ ho@@ v@@ ski and the ac@@ tress brow@@ ning from sugar pun@@ ch were not available for comments on the h@@ acked pictures yesterday .
one representative law@@ rence said to t@@ m@@ z : &apos; it is a hor@@ ren@@ dous violation of privacy &apos; .
actor se@@ th ro@@ gen condemned the h@@ ack@@ er in his t@@ we@@ et : &quot; h@@ acking images from a mobile phone is nothing but selling he@@ h@@ ler@@ ware . &quot;
from a legal point of view , the proliferation of sto@@ len images should not be toler@@ ated .
rad@@ ler , jo@@ gger and wan@@ de@@ rer were present at the 8@@ th bi@@ king to the great fel@@ d@@ berg yesterday , supporting the association &quot; help for cancer children &quot; .
the tour , which was a tor@@ tu@@ ous one , was a easy training for the other .
but everyone agreed on one thing : it was fun .
thomas stu@@ dan@@ ski is likely to have sle@@ pt well last night .
for the first time in his life , the head of the ob@@ er@@ ur@@ sel bre@@ w@@ ery went to the fel@@ d@@ berg yesterday by bike .
for the good purpose .
he can easily hide his little mus@@ cle ca@@ ter , especially since he was involved in the 8@@ th cycle on the great fel@@ d@@ berg in favour of the association &quot; help for cancer children &quot; ( frankfurt ) also brought personal knowledge .
it is a great thing .
&apos;@@ i know now that i can - fine ! &apos;
small po@@ aching on the road in the ap@@ ple@@ -@@ aus@@ kur@@ ve ?
well , if i had stopped , had been out ...
like thomas stu@@ dan@@ ski , who is sitting for the c@@ du in the upper city parliament , many of the 7@@ 18 participants tor@@ n to mountains yesterday in the spring and came close to exhaus@@ tion , but happ@@ ily at the pla@@ te@@ au .
others , however , found it easier to cross the ele@@ ven kil@@ ome@@ tre long route between ho@@ hem@@ ar@@ k and fel@@ d@@ berg .
nor@@ man di@@ ess@@ ner , for example .
the green politicians from the kre@@ i@@ sta@@ g - red d@@ ress , red bike - made an under@@ statement on the start ( &quot; lots of professionals but they don &apos;t get there ! &quot; ) .
he , too , went through the race in a ru@@ ch , as did n@@ ina ku@@ hn , pres@@ s@@ es@@ pre@@ cher of the city of ob@@ er@@ ur@@ sel , who had embar@@ ked on the journey together with frank gr@@ ün@@ is@@ en .
for the two tri@@ athle@@ tes , the &quot; fel@@ d@@ berg bike &quot; was not necessarily a sporting challenge : &quot; this is about char@@ ity , we would like to be part of it - we would have made an exit anyway , &quot; .
on the way , they met paul w@@ en@@ z@@ el from ob@@ er@@ re@@ i@@ f@@ en@@ berg .
the boy ( 12 ) had dro@@ pped down to ob@@ er@@ ur@@ sel in the morning to get straight up to the top .
the frankfurt fl@@ ori@@ an zi@@ er@@ z had w@@ av@@ ed at home at 9 a.m. in the sadd@@ le , &quot; made &quot; the fel@@ d@@ berg twice , and then pul@@ led home with fun .
also had fun &quot; fr@@ it@@ ten@@ -@@ ton@@ i &quot; .
for the head of the ob@@ er@@ ur@@ sel k@@ ul@@ t@@ ki@@ os@@ k , cycling tours across the fel@@ d@@ berg are just part of this .
he had 40 minutes on his 6.@@ 5-@@ kil@@ o racing bike .
a cra@@ zy event .
for this purpose - i am happy to be there &quot; , said andre@@ as bal@@ z@@ ke .
the dur@@ ch@@ tre@@ ini@@ er@@ te main@@ zer says that he is an &quot; ambitious racing bi@@ ker &quot; .
he must be , because he was on the road with the &quot; fi@@ xi@@ e wheel &quot; , which is also racing bi@@ kes , but without swit@@ ching ...
the fact that it was also easy to clim@@ b without a bike proved not only by the 20 hi@@ kers who clim@@ bed up over the white wall and the pun@@ ch of the foot to the summit , but also by a jo@@ gging car that pul@@ led behind a cor@@ d .
the german federal government has been working on the new german federal state of bad@@ en-@@ w@@ ür@@ t@@ tem@@ berg for the past few years .
the 7@@ 18 participants - and thus as many as never before - were sent to groups in the morning .
hi@@ kers first at 9.@@ 30 a.m.
the first cy@@ cli@@ sts and run@@ ners followed at 10 a.m.
five minutes later the first mountain bi@@ kers started .
b@@ ent han@@ sen , chairman of the association &quot; cycling to the great fel@@ d@@ berg &quot; , gave the starting comm@@ ands and w@@ ished the participants a nice excur@@ sion .
for next year he hope to be able to lock the route up to the fel@@ d@@ berg to the safety of the participants .
