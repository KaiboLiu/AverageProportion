opinion : even more security for pedestrians !
they are not 100 metres away : on tuesday the first day of the week in gutach is the new b 33-pedestrian traffic light at the village car park - in sight of the older town hall lights .
two plants as close to each other : intention or turtle bürger ?
this issue has been raised by gutachs mayor yesterday in a clear manner .
&quot; the town hall atmosphere is then installed .
the kluser traffic lights safe both cyclists and bus passengers and the mountain inhabitants .
the new version of the system , which was officially launched yesterday , is important for the sulzbachweg / kirchstraße crossroads .
we have the museum , two churches , kurpark , the bus stop , a doctor and a bank as well as the flow of traffic from the residential area › grub ‘ .
&quot; the high traffic and pedestrian uphill had to be secured by another traffic light &quot; , says eckert .
peter marnold also confirms this from the district council of offenburg .
&quot; according to current measurements , the b 33 is passing through the municipality of gutach every day , about 10 percent of which is heavy goods traffic , &quot; says arnold .
therefore , the construction of another traffic light is more than necessary : &quot; safety is just before us &quot; , he says .
in total , four traffic surveys have been carried out , and a roundabout has also been planned , but due to the narrow intersection between sulzbachweg and kirchstraße .
it was named after arnold in the choice of location of the traffic light mast before : &quot; by means of an extra for us with particularly long trunks of logging transports we have tested whether these vehicles are from sulfur .
the approximately 15 000 euro expensive traffic light system itself is the &quot; most modern , which is currently available on the market &quot; , explained arnold .
the complex is equipped with coloured leds that are so bright and bright that the light is from the car landing , for example , also at low sun .
and it is also economical : the older lighting systems use about 100 watts , the new ones just eight watts .
there are three lights for each direction of travel .
arnold explained the technique of the new plant : this is equipped with two radar sensors .
press the pedestrian to the traffic lights , test the upper part of the radar and test the traffic situation .
the road is free , immediately green for the pedestrian , if not , it takes about 15 seconds .
another radar sensor checks if the green phase is suitable for pedestrians .
&quot; if a group or disabled people should be taken over the road , the green phase will be extended , so everyone will come safely over the track &quot; , explained arnold .
of course , the driver must be involved in this as a partner and observe the track .
this was not the case yesterday : hardly showed the traffic lights for pedestrians green , roughed a upper class vehicle through - at leuchtende red .
josef winkler has been writing for more than 30 years the needs of his childhood and youth from the soul .
the disasters of his catholic village childhood - the language absence , the inclination to raw violence and blunt sexual orientation - are the close and joyful .
the pandora prize winner is known for his prose author , theatre texts are available in his work rar .
collage from prosatexte gerhard fresacher presents for his performance &quot; meteorluminaires on the tongue &quot; , which are now available in the garage x at st. peter &apos;s square .
the theatre maker combines elements from the automotive sector , for example , with the novel &quot; the leibeigene &quot; ( 1987 ) with prosamines from &quot; leichtnam , his family laughing &quot; ( 2003 ) .
the largely empty chamber can be seen as an important part of the new stage : a crumpled sound with a large screen and a large screen .
director of the film &quot; the man in the street &quot; , says the author of the book .
the 70-minute performance exceeds the expectations of the original with a wealth of registry entries .
the actresses in particular are used in the sometimes somewhat questionable scenic transformations .
they are hard-hit , with their head bent under water , with their evening pipes to the wall tapped .
in the cellophan or in the body. in the corridors , they stack on dangerously high sticks , either monologies them loudly or are completely muted on the stage .
the text is conveyed in this way , however , hardly in this way .
the best moments have the evening when sung will - the band will be spread from deep purple to the folk costumes .
only towards the end will the crowded performance be a little quiet , and winkler ’ s downright absurd humor is blowing up .
a blackbox in the car ?
american road planner are looking for a way to find a source of money to finance the falling highway system .
the devices that carry any kilometre travelled and send the information to the authorities are the core of a controversial experiment by washington .
the normally boring area of road planning suddenly has a more intensive debate with bunches of alliances .
libertarians have been allied with environmental groups and advocate that the government should protect the small boxes to record the plots of kilometres – and possibly even to where they are dangerous – that they should use the information for the calculation .
the tea party is appalled .
the american civil rights association ( aclu ) is also deeply concerned and utterly unconcerned about data protection .
but , while congress is not agreed on a course of action , several states are no longer waiting .
they are currently examining how they can be implemented over the next ten years into a system where drivers are required to pay for each mileage they have travelled .
thousands of motorists have used the tachographs , some of which are equipped with gps monitoring , to check .
this is really a must for our country .
“ it is nothing we can only use , ” said hasan ikhrata , managing director of sokra , a company that is based in the south california state of california .
the way in which we use these taxes will change .
the technology is there .
the initiative comes at a time when the highway trust fund is being used to fund the money from the taxes that americans pay at the tier of the fuel cell .
but america is no longer bailed out as much as it did before .
cars use less petrol .
the state tax on mineral oil of 18.4 cents per gallon ( less than 4 eurocents per litre ) has not been increased for 20 years .
politicians dare to take a look at the tax at high prices , even by a cent .
“ the tax on petrol is simply not sustainable , ” says lee munnich , an expert on transport legislation at the university of minnesota .
his state has recently built 500 vehicles with tachographs , with which a milestone based management system can be tested .
“ this represents the most sensible alternative in the long term , ” he said .
bureaucrats call it milestones .
not surprisingly , the idea of urban liberals is found in favor of a tax that could be used , for example , to change driving behaviour in such a way that congestion and climate-damaging exhaust emissions are reduced .
the california planners rely on the system in drawing up strategies to help the most ambitious and ambitious legislative and economic objectives of the federal state .
but republican bill shuster of pennsylvania has been chairman of the house transportation committee for the last three years .
the free marketers of the reason foundation are also excluded from the idea that drivers should be able to search for a route that has been retracted .
“ this is not a tax that is placed in a black hole ” , explains adrian moore , vice president of the reach and bcp guidelines .
people pay directly for what they get .
the movement is also supported by two former us transport ministers , who were in a report in 2011 to invite congress to take part in the process of milestone based accounting .
the us senate approved a new 90 million dollars of expensive pipeline project last year , which cost 10 000 cars .
but the majority in the house of representatives prevented the move and responded to the concerns of mr lehne , the rural deputies , who represent people who are often in the habit of travelling many miles on the way to work or to the city .
several states and major cities are nevertheless moving towards the eu .
the most committed is oregon , which currently has 5,000 drivers for the largest experiment in the country .
these drivers will soon be paying mileage instead of the oil tax to the state .
nevada has already launched a pilot project .
new york city is also considering such a move .
illinois tests it in limited measure with lkws .
and the i-95 coalition , which includes the transport ministers , has been invited by 17 states on the east coast ( including maryland , pennsylvania , virginia and florida ) .
the concept is not a universal hit .
in nevada , where recently 50 volunteers were equipped with the equipment , drivers were sceptical about the idea of the government having to follow any of their movements .
“ concern about big brother and such things were a big problem , ” explains alauddin khan , head of the strategic and industrial development team at the united states department of transport .
people did not want it .
when the test was completed , the aclu warned nevada that it was on its website : “ it would be relatively easy to use the tachograph in full-grown monitoring devices . ”
there is no need to create a huge , bulky technology world .
nevada is part of a number of states that are now seeking affordable technology .
so , khan said , the public would also be more reassured .
the hunt for this technology has led some authorities to a small startup company called true mileage in california .
the company was not originally established to provide assistance to states in the taxation of car drivers .
rather , it was their aim to create a competitive environment in an emerging market for car insurance , where the drivers are required to pay for their driving licences on the basis of the miles they have travelled .
but the information she has tested is also useful for road planners , because they do not work with gps and only provide limited information that is regularly sent via modem .
“ people are more willing to remember , but they are not willing to share their speed and locations ” , said ryan morrison , managing director of true missouri .
in some of these public pilot programmes , big mistakes were made .
there are much cheaper and less intrusive ways to implement this .
oregon is a place where the planner experiments to find a number of choices for motorists .
you can register for a device with or without gps .
or you don &apos;t choose any device at all and instead pay a flat fee based on the average of all residents of the state .
others hope to see the concept of a suspicious public sold , by using the devices with more functions .
in new york city , transport officials want to develop a tax device that will also cover parking charges , a insurance scheme for paid passengers and a system for paying for speed miles .
“ drivers would be more than satisfied with the added value of the system .
some transport planners , however , wonder whether all the talk about paying per mile is not just a huge distraction exercise .
the metropolitan transport system is based on the metropolitan transport commission for the san francisco bay area , and the congress is able to resolve the problem of bankruptcy highway trust fund .
an additional one-time fee or an annual levy could be a driving licence for hybrid vehicles or other vehicles that use little petrol .
“ there is no reason for an operation if an aspirin is sufficient , ” explains the randy rentschler , the head of legislation and public affairs of the commission .
if we do that , hundreds of millions of car drivers are worried about their privacy and many other things .
königsfeld : small team is wacker &apos;s team beating .
the voluntary fire service irrigated its autumn break in the city despite staffing shortages .
only 11 men took part in the exercise .
department commander hans kamerer had already been involved in the training in his assumption of practice in the castle church of burgberger strasse .
the sawing process is to be short .
the resulting fire and the smoke development have created two people who are injured , one of whom could still send an emergency call .
two breathing protection carriers of the armed forces made themselves into the hands of the police after the first check of the situation by hans kammerer .
after a short time , the first person was able to find and enter the open .
the second person had to be worn .
this was not so easy , because close stairs were also to be overcome .
the building , a workshop with integrated stalling-room for two horses , was not easy to secure .
it stored a lot of wood and straw bales in it .
there were also electrical machines for woodworking .
the first deletion attack was made via the tank in the vehicle .
another management was carried out by an overflow hydrant in about 100 meters distance .
now three random attacks have been made .
the new building was also used for the use of a hollow beam pipe .
hans kammerer was the practice also to show how to make a difference with little available resources .
in case of emergency , support is provided via the königsfeld daily operations group .
the commander was satisfied with the course of the exercise .
networking of universities and companies important
on his visit to the district of breisgau high black forest , the country president guido wolf also visited tititisee-neustadt to find out where the workforce of tomorrow will come from .
the hochschwarzwald funding centre , together with the managing directors of vocational schools and the district gymnasium and the parents &apos; advisory board , went on to this important issue .
&quot; education is an important factor in location &quot; , underlined claudia stehle , director of the hans-thoma school , which has developed the networked school education center hochschwarzwald .
wolf was impressed by the model projects for training .
since 2011 , the forest town has been home to a successful cooperation between the support centre , the district gymnasium and the vocational school centre .
he also praised the family-friendly character of the district .
&quot; it is important not only to keep the family phase in mind , but also to take a look at the period of care for the care of family members , &quot; wolf said .
he also said that more and more people are looking after care and care for their families .
&quot; without the support of employers , the resulting increase in the burden on employees can lead to an end to the employment relationship , &quot; said wolf .
but no one can afford to let skilled workers lose their jobs , he said .
another particularly important factor is the networking of high-level and enterprise .
&quot; for whoever has been the merits of the region during his studies , remains with his acquired knowledge and experience .
only if there are sufficient training places can we ensure that the skilled workers &apos; needs are met .
he believes that the location advantage of the district is its advantageous location in the southwest of germany , in the immediate vicinity of france and switzerland .
he also had a lot of fun on his train journey from titisee-neustadt to freiburg , and the efforts already made to expand public transport .
&quot; stay firm and continue to be a matter of urgency for the public to be better . &quot;
with music an entertaining afternoon you experience the evening with fun music and enjoy the evening with an entertaining afternoon .
for 15 years now , the kaul family has been inviting dietinger seniors to coffee , cakes and then to a vesper .
previously , the elderly were treated as citizens in the resting place .
meanwhile , this afternoon takes place in the nursing home st. josef .
the residents were delighted to have the tasty cakes and cakes .
later , there were sausages .

the more than 100 years old natural stone wall , the front line of the pre-reconstruction old school yard , is a church road , which is to be rebuilt with a view to the renovation costs of the city of bräunlingen .
in the days before kilbig , the first works of the renovation of the front school yard were followed by a small corner wall , to stabilise and static relief of the more than a hundred years old stone wall with balustrade .
the next step is to , according to alexander misok of the bräunlinger city building office , the national monument office , be included in the planning and to establish a rehabilitation concept for the old wall .
after that , the experts will make a cost calculation , which will then be made available to the local council for the decision and for the definition of the further action .
a decision on this is expected next year .
after the renovation , paving and planting of the old school building , the building was completed in the two sides of the building built in 1912 .
the historic , one-hundred year old border wall of the old school court to the church road , is mainly marked by water and frost damage , as no drying is present .
deep cracks in individual stones bear witness to weather damage , but the wall is not currently crumbling .
a steady wall is a prerequisite for a school yard used by students , which is guaranteed by the current fortifications .
originally , the school court renovation was already in 2008 / 2009 planned , but high accidents were caused by the lack of planning .
an important word in the historical school wall renovation , which is even used for film shots , is the national monument office .
if the specifications are met from this site , the city hopes to be able to obtain grants from the monuments of the city .
the bräunlinger primary school students , who have now returned to a well restored old school building with new aula , are now able to take advantage of the old school yard .
özdemir wants to offer jazz training in stuttgart .
in the ongoing discussions on the future of music universities in baden-württemberg , the focus has now also been on cem özdemir , the federal chairman of the greens .
&quot; i think it is wrong to take holistic education in the stuttgart university of music . &quot;
jazz and classical music are just part of the jazz scene in stuttgart .
this is contrary to the view expressed by özdemir , who was in stuttgart a favourite for a direct mandate at the bundestag elections on 22 september , of the green red state government .
this is pushing the european union forward on the basis of an expert study .
this will include the study program jazz and pop music by the musikhochschule stuttgart .
us border : &quot; super tunnel &quot; to smuggling drugs discovers that the police have been using the internet for the purpose of smuggling drugs .
on the border between mexico and the us , investigators have found a super-tunnel to smuggle drugs and have closed down .
as the us customs authorities have said , the more than 500 metres long tube was between tijuana and san diego with electricity .
three suspects have therefore been arrested , eight tonnes of marijuana and almost 150 kilometres of cocaine have been confiscated .
the tunnel was , according to the data , not yet used .
&quot; this cartels are stupid when they think they could be under the radar . &quot;
drug gangs are insured by duffy : &quot; if you continue to use such tunnels and try to use them , we are determined to do so at a huge waste of your dirty money .
both the us authorities and mexican security forces are in a permanent state of conflict with drug cartels .
since 2006 , mexico has received more than 77,000 people in connection with drug crime .
designed by experts , the company is designed by experts and built by experts .
due to the complex equipment of the tunnel , the investigators assume that the tunnel is being built by architects and engineers .
the track system was equipped to allow electrical and electronic control of the vehicle .
on the mexican side , access is in a building that is 80 meters from the border .
according to the authorities , a ladder leads 20 meters down to the actual tunnel entrance .
the tunnel has a cross-section of 1.20 meters height and 90 centimeters width .
it would have been a good way of combating illegal immigration to the united states .
two suspects were arrested in connection with the cocaine fund .
the third , a mexican , was arrested for confiscating marijuana .
all three are in danger of being sentenced to life imprisonment as a maximum penalty , as officials have said .
since 2006 , eight such tunnels have been discovered , and it was stated at the press conference in san diego .
but it was the first time that in such a tunnel construction kokain was found .
cocaine is usually produced in smaller quantities and not through tunnels .
this shows the &quot; despair &quot; of drug gangs , whose traditional routes have now been cut off , bill clinton said .
they would do everything they can to get to the us .
the detainees were not given details , at least one is mexican , as they were .
they must be punished with prison sentences of up to ten years .
2014 , geisinger festival is celebrated in the year 2014 .
the anniversary of the city of geisingen on the occasion of the 1250 .
return of the first documentary mention is still closer .
if in just over eight weeks the year is over , the anniversary year will be upon us .
holistic and church households were founded in 794 for the first time .
a church was built in churches , in which both places are mentioned .
on 15 march , there will be an official start to the anniversary year , and as hostages are currently unable to hold , the conference will take place in the centre of the city .
in the course of the anniversary , several events are organised both in geisingen and in kirchen-hausen .
church households are held in july at a festival weekend from 18 to 20 july , the 1250 .
celebrating the return of the past .
on friday with a ceremony , saturday and sunday with a celebration around the church parish hall .
on this weekend of the festival there is also the church church of the house .
city music director rudolf barth has written for the city on the occasion of the anniversary a composition of orders that is distributed to three dates .
on 21 june , together with the sonnwendfeier des schwarzwaldverein , on 12 july in the arena with fireworks and on 13 december as the first concert of city music in the new festhalle .
this will be presented in the anniversary year and will be celebrated in the official date of last september .
on the occasion of the geissinger city anniversary , a new chronicle is also being published .
&quot; but it should be a chronicle not only of the spirits themselves , but also of a printed work about the intellectual of today , which just for the sake of hostages , church households , leipzig , auls .
and the spiritual spirit of today also celebrates 2014 birthday , 1974 was the present space with the incommunitizations .
the new chronicle will be published on 21 or 22 november in the new festhalle in geisingen .
2014 , however , is also another year of many anniversaries .
the fool guild strahglonki starts on february 8 with a customs evening on the occasion of her 60th anniversary , the harmony gutmadingen is celebrated 90 years and has been opened on march 29 .
the altenwerk leipferdingen is 40 years old , the geisinger school has been located in the new location for 50 years and celebrates it on 10 may , the musikverein polyhymnia leiptingen .
geisingen city was founded in a gift certificate , which was owned by the monastery of st. gallen , in 764 .
the document was written in churches ( hausen ) , which was then a court place .
both communities are therefore in the same document .
the reason 2014 this 1250 year old celebration , in addition , is also the local form 40 years ago .
council takes track systems into consideration .
should the rail pass be &apos; am hirschen &apos; reconstructed in order to improve road safety ?
yes , the local councils have decided .
schiltach must pay eur 220 000 for this .
deutsche bahn wants to be the kinetischer bahn ( german railways ) for the coming year .
in particular , safety at rail crossings should be increased - regularly there are collisions of trains across germany with other vehicles .
do the municipalities agree to the conversion measures , they must pay one-third of the costs , share the rest and pay the public rail and covenant .
schillach city builder roland grießhaber explained to the municipal council the specificities of the bahübergang &quot; am hirschen &quot; .
the city plans to build a new building in the same area as the tunnelmund , to the west of the railway track .
there are also large vehicles , such as those that transport long timber , which could be in the case of counter-traffic without having to block the tracks .
greeks therefore proposed to create a necessary support wall so that the eu can be a source of energy for the next street in due course .
this was confirmed in the local council controversial , as some councils have stressed the need for road traffic : thomas kipp brought the public ’ s mood into question by saying that &apos; must we be held responsible for so few vehicles ?
mayor thomas haas opposed : the rail crossing &quot; hirschen &quot; is regularly used for long-timber transport .
even wood from the field &quot; kuhbach &quot; is partially transported over this route , because the up to 20 meters long vehicles will take the route at the häberlesbrücke , because they are not turning into the main road .
in addition , the route serves as a rerouting for those vehicles that do not have the option of using the tunnel if the main road is closed down , haas argued .
it is clear that kirchberg and schlossberg tunnels will be rebuilt and refurbished , as is the case in wolverhätte , the railway transition could be &quot; on the hirschen &quot; for a longer period .
the councils agreed to allow the commission to study the costs of the proposed broadening of the roads .
despite this , the reconstruction of the railway crossing was approved by a majority with the aim of ensuring that the necessary support wall was built in such a way that the city would be the next road towards &quot; bahnhofstrasse &quot; for encounter traffic if necessary .
the reconstruction of the railway crossing at the gerberei trautwein could , on the other hand , lead to a quite different problem , which could affect access to the heavily increasing &quot; geroltzhäuser &apos;s way &quot; .
the administration had completed the renovation plans of the railway from the engineering office breinlinger , as it had doubts as to whether the planned connection of the geroltzhäuser was still possible without any problems .
the study concluded that the cost of the refund of the nine-fold costs of the road could be underestimated .
the responsibility for this lies with the city as road building load carrier .
the reconstruction could therefore be a way of avoiding liability disputes .
since both the wood waste and the bending in the current expansion state work , the new timber should be given a special attention .
i would also like to mention the risk of a collision of the turn with a vehicle standing on the transition rather less than at other railway crossings , because the stop is located right next to the middle , which is a good connection .
even trains from the main station would have to stop at this point .
the majority of the population were in favour of the transition to this railway , as the city of schiltach had to deal with the problem of seating vehicles , as the councils said , since the railway was in a state of decline .
the fact that the committee considers the renovations to the railway crossings to be unproblematic is that they are carried out in front of the kuhbach railway , for which the agreements have already been reached with the railways .
esa decides on major space missions : missions for billions of dollars of space missions , billions of dollars of missions , and billions of dollars of missions to help the world save the planet .
distant planets , gravitational waves , or black holes - experts from the european space agency must be aware of two major projects .
30 proposals were selected , five were still in the race .
far worlds .
more than 1000 planets in other stars have already found astronomers .
whether it is at least on some of these lives , nobody knows .
the choice is difficult : if you want to search for gravitational waves ?
or rather the origin of the cosmos ?
or according to geothermal planets , and perhaps aliens , discover life outside ?
these questions are being asked by those responsible for the european space agency esa .
for your program &quot; cosmic vision &quot; you are looking for ideas for two major space projects that make a decisive contribution to research .
the budget for such &apos; l missions &apos; is approximately eur 1 billion each .
the start is expected to be 2028 and 2034 .
in early september , the elite of the european world space research , meeting in paris to present proposals for such missions .
30 ideas were discussed , five of them are now in the closer vote .
many bodies have assessed the proposals to remove hook in the researchers .
in the next few days , a final decision will be taken by the scientific program committee .
in total , four major issues have been selected by the esa , to which the missions of the cosmic vision programme , which was launched in 2007 , are to be found .
what are the conditions for the formation of planets and life ?
the exact procedures for the formation of sterns from large gas clouds - and thus also the emergence of planets that these stars circle .
a large infrared telescope in the space could be this dark penetration .
and when a star has a planet , under what circumstances can life arise there ?
to address this issue , 2017 will be the space telescope &quot; cheops &quot; .
the possibilities are limited , however , cheops is a small mission with a budget of eur 150 million .
with greater instruments , astronomers could explore planets similar to the earth , and even the composition of their atmospheres could be searched for &quot; biomarkers &quot; : gases that act as an indication of biological activity .
how does the solar system work ?
this issue , too , should ultimately be clarified as to what the prerequisites are for life to develop .
the role of magnetic fields in a star &apos;s magnetic activity and the interaction of its magnetic field and the magnetic field it produces play an important role .
in our solar system these processes can be exemplary examined .
the &quot; solar orbiter &quot; is the first step in the esa mission in the m class ( there the budget is about half a billion euros ) for this issue .
the probe will start in 2017 and the sun &apos;s surface and activity will be closely monitored .
of great interest to researchers are also jupiter and its moons .
you want to find out what role the giant planet plays in the development of the solar system .
the esa provides for the first of the three l missions of the &quot; cosmic vision &quot; programme .
the probe &quot; juice &quot; ( jupiter icy moons explorer ) begins your journey probably 2022 .
eight years later , jupiter was to capture the atmosphere of the planet and the icy moons of europe , kallisto and ganymed .
what are the basic physical laws of the universe ?
the space offers many possibilities to see matter in extreme conditions .
perhaps there are also differences that could affect physicists ’ path to a new theory that includes the notion of “ the universe ” .
how is the universe evolved and what is it ?
before 13.7 billion years ago , our cosmos was created by the big bang .
in addition to the material we are familiar with , from the stars , planets and living beings as we do , there are dark matter , the gravity of which is galaxies and galaxies .
so far , researchers have not been aware of the physical laws that were in the first fraction of a second of the big bang , nor of the dark matter that resulted from dark matter and dark energy .
with &quot; eucid &quot; , esa has already developed an m mission here , whose launch is expected to start in 2020 .
with a special telescope the probe is to determine the distribution of the matter in the universe for the first time in the sky , thus drawing conclusions about the nature of dark matter .
if you could go on the race , you can also try out the race .
of the 30 proposals , at the end of the selection procedure , only two will remain .
the best chances of being granted as a l mission are , according to many experts , &quot; e-lisa &quot; , a sophisticated concept for demonstrating gravitational waves .
physicists understand changes in the structure of space time that albert einstein described almost 100 years ago .
they were proven to date .
elisa could do that , the scientists hope behind the project .
the mission sees a two-way or three-way detector that can be used in space .
unlike the plants on the earth , it could also be gravitational waves , which are visible in the big bang , and thus create new insights on the emergence of the cosmos .
four other proposals still compete for the second l mission : a large x-ray tube , a large x-ray tube called &quot; athena &quot; , which is black soles , among other things , &quot; icy planet &quot; .
already retired are among other proposals for the sample retransport from mars , for the research of mond , venus and assteroids .
snowden is ready to work with germany in terms of us surveillance .
edward snowden , the whistleblower of the us secret service , has said that he is ready to go to berlin and to go to the german parliament .
german member hans-christian ströbele met snowden on thursday in russia , where he received asylum .
in a letter from snowden , which was sent on friday from ströbele to the media in berlin , he wrote : “ even if the result of my efforts is demonstrably positive , my government is treating a dissent as faithful opinion .
to tell the truth is not a crime .
the letter says that snowden , who is convinced that the european union &apos;s support for the international community will convince the american government to stop the charge of him .
the us department of justice ’ s accusation includes spying and theft of personal data .
the german minister for the interior , hans-peter friedrich , said to time online : “ if mr snowden is willing to speak to german representatives , we will find ways to make that possible . ”
relations between the us and germany have been shaped by the assertions that the nsa has not taken the mobile phone from chancellor angela merkel .
thomas oppermann , the member who has been the secretary-general &apos;s parliamentary committee , said that the opportunity should be taken to bring snowden to bear as a witness if possible .
ströbele , a green member , published an image of himself and snowden in his twitter feed .
he was arrested on his visit to russia by two german journalists .
ströbele explained that according to the lawyer of the former nsa employee snowden was not returned to russia , if he had left the country .
if snowden in germany says , then he needs a reassurance that he will be “ safe ” there , he says .
snowden explains in his letter that he is committed to “ serious and continuing education . ”
however , it is affected by the global response to “ my act of political expression . ”
citizens around the world and high-level politicians – including the united states – have been calling for the revelations of uncontrolled systems of comprehensive surveillance as a failure to take account of the general public .

frontier airlines charges a fee for hand luggage .
frontier airlines plans to provide up to $ 100 from passengers travelling to the us .
frontier airlines intends to provide up to $ 100 for a piece of hand baggage and $ 2 for coffee or limonade , even if in the announcement the aircraft will be delivered on wednesday .
the new fee applies to hand luggage in the luggage compartment above the seat , small bags under the seat are still free of charge .
frontier explained that it is calculated to cost $ 25 when the fee is paid in advance and $ 100 in travellers who arrive only at the airport .
front speaker kai o &apos;malley said that the fee of 100 us dollars targets is to make travellers who travel by car or by car .
“ we do not want to calculate this amount ” , she explained .
airlines started to use the same system for the first and second checked baggage in 2008 .
passengers who tried to take them around are not entitled to any additional charges .
fees are one way of encouraging passengers to pay less for onboard .
o &apos;malley said that the new fee is not really about making money .
it is about the most loyal customers of frontier , who have clearly expressed their concern about the growing difficulty of finding a place in the field above the seat .
passengers who wish to book their tickets on the airline ’ s website do not have to pay .
this means that a passenger on the boarding gate will be able to obtain a baggage at no charge , which is the next person but will pay $ 100 for a similar piece of baggage .
o &apos;malley explained that the website of frontier and the check-in procedures would be changed so that passengers could have access to the fee that they had to pay before they could get to the gate .
the new baggage fee from frontier will not enter into force until the summer , and there is no exact date yet .
passengers are often smiling about baggage supplements and other charges , but airlines like to resort to them .
they argue that the transport of luggage is money costing and passengers are paying for it .
many people on wall street view the new baggage allowance as a sign that the airlines have enough money to pay after years of losses to cover the cost of air travel .
most of them have , however , so far left their fingers on hand baggage charges .
spirit airlines inc. has asked for a new contract to be signed three years ago for hand luggage and then alleged air , again a cheap ticket .
the only other airline with such a charge is the hungarian wizz air , explained the airline operator .
he estimated in a december 2011 report that the handbaggage fee was $ 50 million annually , and that it was $ 50 million a year .
sorensen , who formerly held a leadership position at midwest airlines , was the first to be appointed to spirit .
“ the boarding process was one of the smoothly running processes that i have been able to achieve in my career in aviation ” , said he .
i expected to be gnashing teeth and handsome discussions at the gate .
“ the plane was full , ” he explained , “ and the boarding was done as smoothly . ”
frontier follows spirit also in the 2 dollars spent on coffee , tea , limonade or juice .
the company stated that passengers travelling by limonade or juice should be entitled to take the whole dose and eat coffee free of charge .
water is still free .
us airways had a short time in 2008 to try to get money for soft drinks , but did not do so seven months later .
frontiers step , fees for hand baggage , if passengers are not travelling directly at the airline , is a step in the most recent direction to help customers to access their own website .
airlines pay online travel agencies such as orbitz between $ 10 and $ 25 per ticket sold .
this provides an incentive for all companies to make passengers buy directly from them instead of via an online travel agency .
frontier is , however , the most advanced in this area .
in september , the company started to offer a full range of services when booking online travel agencies , only half of the number of frequent flyer miles .
on wednesday , the miles were recredited to 25 percent of the route .
a third party company ’ s flight number is charged with frontier over 1000 miles and provides customers with only 250 miles .
passengers can also travel to the airport only when they purchase directly on the frontier platz. the ticket price is € 10 .
frontier has a loyal customer base at its headquarters in denver , but the business is shrinking and the company is losing money .
the proceeds went up by 9 % and flight capacity fell by 10 % .
republic has tried to make a lot of money available for the company &apos;s sale .
proverbs come from the bible .
more than 40 women attended the last women &apos;s breakfast this year in the evangelical church community of bisingen .
theme of the day in the municipal house were &quot; proverbs from the bible &quot; and &quot; phrases from the middle ages &quot; .
zita köhler , the chairman of the church council , went to the church in a lecture on the biblical proverbs after the breakfast .
&quot; proverbs contain wisdom , rules or warnings &quot; , she explained .
she compared several proverbs with the corresponding bible sites and explained the meaning .
she called proverbs such as : holzauge be vigilant , like scales fall from the eyes , cast an eye on someone who gives his &apos;s the lord in sleep , his hands in innocence .
the reference number for the speaker was several times also advised by the speaker to read the proverb .
the phrase from the middle ages was used by the church community council .
she explained the meaning and origin of the phrases she called &apos; bridges to the past &apos; .
finally , a raffle was lowered .
the prices were concealed on a table and were humorously rewritten before they were handed over to the winners .
among the visitors of the breakfast round , the civic candidates also mixed up with the mayor candidate roman waizenegger .
learning instead of unemployed : pilot project for unskilled in tourism
at the mecklenburgische see plateau , a pilot project was launched for the tourism industry .
under the leadership of the federal employment agency , 49 women and men who have already been recognised as unskilled in the sector are to be trained to work for hotels and restaurants over three winter years .
&quot; what is new is that the six-month courses with degrees are ending &quot; , said carmen wiechert of the working agency .
the benefits are varied : participants would not be unemployed , the companies would be given a training place , and the workers would be increasingly integrated into hotels and restaurants .
the project also includes the industrial and commercial chamber of new industries in neubrandenburg and the german hotel and restaurant association .
nsa explains that an “ internal error ” and not hackers are to blame for the crash of the site .
the shadow national security agency has said on the subject of the late friday that a mistake has made your public website for a few hours and not hackers , as was claimed online .
“ nsa.gov was a few hours away tonight , because during a planned update an internal error was occurring ” , explains the debian developer .
the problem will be fixed this evening .
the claim that the failure was caused by a distributed thought out in the form of a denial of service attack ( ddos ) is not true .
in the early evening hours , online server tracking was listed .
previously , a nsa spokesman had declared to abc news that the sensitive internal network of the authority was “ in no way compromised . ”
secret information is not in danger , according to the speaker .
at least one group of hacktists took up the claim to be the nsa website with a ddos attack .
such attacks are the target site with page views .
cybertactics are relatively simple and the attacks are not designed to prevent the internal network of the target system .
the former supersecret nsa , whose nickname was once no search agency ( no such authority ) , was found in the nsa , which is now in the light of the public and is still known in recent months .
the growing controversy over the secret service prompted initial speculation about whether the cessation today is the result of a targeted cyper-operation .
slightly declined , the number of people without jobs fell by 22 in october to 1,307 .
although the 3.1 % quota is better than last year and the figure is better than it was in september , &apos; but we would have hoped for more &apos; , says monika felder-bauer , deputy managing director of the agency .
many companies responded behave in recruitment .
one reason for this is according to felder-bauer : &quot; we have hardly any skilled workers in the crafts , health and care of the elderly &quot; .
the hotel is located in the heart of the city , close to the main train station and the old town .
in mid-december the winter season begins .

profit loss in bombardier following a fall in supply and orders was a major problem .
the canadian aircraft and railway manufacturer bombardier inc melted down the record 15-percent of the aircraft in the year 2008 .
bombardier based in montreal also published no flight test data for his brand-new aircraft of the cseries and awarded no new aircraft .
on the maiden flight of the test aircraft a year and a half ago , only three more starters followed , which makes it questionable whether the test phase will be as planned .
the results were not as good as the forecasts and led to a fall in the price of over 8 % on the toronto stock exchange .
cameron doerksen , analyst at national bank financial , reduced the amount of money he had received on thursday from the “ outperform ” rating of “ sector perform ” in order to ensure that the share will be held in the next one to two quarters .
“ while weaker delivery numbers for aircraft have been largely expected , the us economy has not benefited from the development of margins in the transport sector , ” said doerksen in a customer letter .
we believe that bombing and the use of weapons to place new orders for the cseries will be resumed when the aircraft test programme is progressing .
if , however , no new orders are announced in the coming months , we expect the market to be more sceptical about the program .
bombardier hopes that the aircraft will be able to fly the company in the lower end of the market katapulti. he will be responsible for the aircraft &apos;s takeover .
the first test aircraft was delivered to the public in march and flew to the united states for the first time in september after months of delays .
but binding orders for the cseries with 177 moderately , as potential customers are based on the results of flight tests and see if they can make the allegations of the company regarding fuel efficiency and cost savings .
there are currently 403 orders and commitments from 15 customers and companies .
the ceo pierre beaudoin is confident that he will be able to complete his mission of 300 binding orders .
the management of the company assured analysts and media on thursday that the program would be included in the schedule .
“ the test aircraft is no longer on the ground than expected , ” said beaudoin at a telephone conference and added , while the service life of the aircraft was ground testing .
each manufacturer is planning differently .
we have decided to fly the first flight and then to carry out a review period , which we have done .
this is happening throughout the flight programme .
the second of five test aircraft is expected to be delivered in the next few weeks , the remaining one shortly afterwards , as it was said from the company side .
yet analysts remain sceptical about whether twelve months after the maiden flight the first customer will be a cseries aircraft .
bombardier declared that it reviewed the planning for the commissioning ( ice ) and will carry it out in the coming months .
“ the slow progress of the flight test – even if it appears to have been interfering with internal planning bombardiers – reinforces our view that commissioning is limited to the first quarter of 2015 , ” said doerksen .
in the third quarter , with the end of september 30 , bombardier ’ s net gain fell to $ 147 million , or $ 8 per share , from $ 172 million , or $ 9 per share , a year earlier .
the adjusted profit per share is unchanged at 9 cents .
sales were slightly down on the prior-year period , from 4.2 to 4.1 billion dollars .
analysts had a profit of 10 cents per share and a turnover of 4.56 billion dollars , so thomson reuters i / b / e / s .
the world ’ s fourth largest aircraft manufacturer states that it has already achieved 45 aircraft in this quarter , a drop of 57 in the last year .
net orders fell from 83 aircraft to 83 .
the order book in the aerospace division was € 1.2 billion on 30 september .
“ in the field of aerospace , the results were within the scope of our specifications , but the low order intake and overall market conditions were disappointing , ” said beaudoin .
sales in the aerospace industry increased by € 1.2 billion to € 2.4 billion .
bombardier , the world ’ s largest railway manufacturer , announced that sales in this sector fell by just under 11 % to € 2.1 billion .
the order book in the transport sector was € 32.6 billion on 30 september , and was thus down slightly from 31 december .
the profit margin in the transport sector was reduced by processing problems for some major contracts .
according to corporate governance , it will be a new target for the fourth quarter .
in the afternoon trading on thursday , the bombardier share dropped by 8.5 percent and was 4.83 kwh ( 4,83 canadian dollars ) , after it was announced that patrick pichette was on .
the brazilian embra sa , the world &apos;s third largest commercial aircraft manufacturer and bombing company , is a major airline in the region .

cocaine addict who is a drug boss in front of police investigation , must go to prison .
basharat ditta , 42 , gave information on sub-world size neil scarborough further .
the lawyer was afraid to reveal his secret drug addiction , and he could see his secret drug addiction brought to light .
he was arrested by the liverpool crown court to three years in prison .
a well-known criminal defender who has a drug baron in front of a large police investigation because he is afraid that his secret police force will be lifted .
basharat ditta , 42 , supplied subworld size neil scarborough with sensitive data .
the war , which criminalists call “ first-class ” , is a very good example of how to protect the rights of the child in 2011 .
officials watched the scrubbing of scarborough ( 32 ) three bags cocaine at the house of the lawyer in blackburn , lancashire , absent , while this with colleagues at a dinner .
the investigation brought to light the fact that ditta regularly uses class a drugs .
over a period of eight months between january and august 2011 , he tried to disseminate unlawful information on the arrest of two men on behalf of scarborough and one of his partners .
all four suspects were arrested at that time by the police in the context of a major investigation into the heroin and cocaine trade in lancashire , cumbria , merseyside , berkshire and west .
together with 32 other people , they were arrested later , after the police had been arrested in a number of house searches , heroin and cocaine worth £ 1.5 million , and £ 200,000 in cash .
ditta , 42 , gave information to the criminals because he was afraid that his drug addiction could be publicized .
ditta , who is responsible for the law firm forbes solicitors in blackburn , was elected to the liverpool crown court in a three-week term .
he gave a very good account of the cocaine ownership during a previous survey .
the lawyer was transferred after the police had been informed in their investigations against scarborough .
two investigators followed the example of the suspect and saw that the suspect had become ditta &apos;s house and had to take drugs with a purity of 60 % in a black glove under his garbage .
shortly after he was dispatched , he telephoned scarborough regularly with ditta , who was at dinner in the football stadium of blackburn rovers in ewood park .
the lawyer returned home and he was returned to the hospital and then he was given nine communications between the two .
it was announced in court that ditta was a “ regular consumer ” of cocaine , after a test had been performed on class a drugs in his hair , his wallet and on his credit card .
ditta was later arrested , but refused to allow cocaine to be taken and said that he had been in contact with the alleged dealer because he had lost his mandate .
during his arrest , ditta sent his wallet and tried to find a number of credit cards , including a few of the bank ’ s cards , and he was taken from a hair ’ s trial .
in police interrogation , he said that he was operating under his private address as well as in the workplace an office and clients would be prosecuted at home for legal matters .
it was announced in court that he was key players in the drug trade , some of which he had previously represented , following significant arrests and informed that what the results of the investigations had known about them .
prosecutor anne wyte said : “ a criminal prosecutor is a criminal better than any other . ”
ditta is accused of abusing his position as a criminal defender , as he has been too concerned with certain clients .
the relationship in question is not simply that of a drug dealer , but of a drug dealer who is a lawyer who is supplying drugs to his lawyer .
part of his communications was undoubtedly legitimate , because he was the lawyer of these people .
but that went well beyond the limits of a normal relationship between lawyer and client .
he was involved in police investigations to the extent that he could be allowed to continue to carry out criminal activities .
mr ditta has now brought his profession into disrepute .
he was a member of the board of directors of the german bundesbank of the german federal republic .
ditta pointed out any misconduct and claimed : “ if i were a corrupt lawyer , i would be a corrupt lawyer , and information to scarborough passed on to him , i would not spend 15 hours .
but , after the hearing , superintendent lee halstead said of the police in lancashire : “ mr ditta has taken the step from a criminal to a criminal in the moment he was arrested .
his cocaine dependence has led to hopelessly compromising and made him susceptible to the motives of leading members of organised crime who appoint him to provide valuable information about police investigations .
lawyers must have the highest standards of integrity and must be able to be trusted and confident in the public arena .
ditta has lost this trust and is trying to hide behind the façade of his profession .
the serious and organized crime unit ( tcp ) is a leading international organization for the investigation of ditta , who also led to a sentence in three cases due to the possession of cocaine and the disability of justice .
this case should give a warning to criminals and show that no one is complying with the arm of the law .
we find them and bring them to justice .
scarborough itself was sentenced to 14 years in prison after being accused of conspiracy to heroin , cocaine , and cannabis trafficking for school purposes .
thirty-five more people involved in the drug trade were sentenced to total punishment of 153 years for drug offences .
on his website ditta published an area of questions and answers about himself , in which he indicated that his dream job was to create a job as a lawyer .
revolutionary work of the church music
to end the celebrations on the occasion of its 160-year anniversary , the song crane dunningen will perform two services of worship with the &quot; deutschen messe &quot; by franz schubert .
after the great success of the musicals &quot; rock my life &quot; , which attracted the spectators in the spring of this year , the song crane will be ready for the end of the anniversary year .
on saturday , 26 october , this extraordinary exhibition will be held from 19 during the evening show in st. martinskirche dunningen and on sunday , october 27 , 2010 from 10th to 15th at the service in the city .
the so-called deutsche messe , with the original title &quot; singing to celebrate the holy opera sacrifice of the fair &quot; , d 872 , is a spiritual musical work of the composer franz schubert from the year 1826 .
the exhibition will be held in the framework of the services of worship , as the ordering party johann philipp neumann thought .
under the direction of hermann schneider , the choir is run by the brass group of the musikverein frhrosensinn tennenbronn and noemi lokodi at the organ .
haslach : skepticism is increasingly turning into confidence .
with the elections to the parish council in 2015 , for example , the soulward unity of haslach ( se ) will change fundamentally .
there is only one common parish common interest , which is the same for all six parishes .
in a joint meeting on saturday , the bodies of haslach , hofstetten , mühlenbach , fischerbach , steinach and welschensteinach prepared themselves for the changes .
the fundamental decisions taken by the diocese are nothing more to be changed and it is up to the parish councils to decide on them as satisfactorily as possible .
during the day it was particularly clear : the scepticism about the new is hesitant but increasingly so of a confidence .
the ideas and expectations of the innovations in 2015 , as well as concrete proposals on the future composition and size of the parish council , were not enough to satisfy the most constructive discussions of the six bodies with the main members of the sailors .
regional dean georg schmitt explained , on the basis of a presentation , the new guidelines for soulward units in the archdiocese of freiburg .
the se haslach is then a church community of the holy see , which is to be incorporated into the rights and duties of the six individual church communities to date .
there will only be a common parish council and a public prosecutor &apos;s council , in which the parish council is represented by the priest .
from every parish , at least two elected members should be represented , in the six parish councils , so called community councils are formed .
it will be up to them in future to make life in the church easier .
when it comes to the finances of the individual parish , there was a considerable need for discussion .
the new features provide that collected data will be used in the pfarreien for specific purposes .
the liabilities are based on the entire community .
it is precisely with regard to the major investments planned , whose obligation would then be met by all parishes , that there was great concern .
&quot; in the past , too , only investments were made in projects that were supported by the individual parishes alone .
practical experience with a joint body for five parish priests described béarn ritter , the chairman of the board in the seafaring unit of rubble forest neurie .
they had committed themselves to &quot; one shall be five , &quot; in 2006 , and they have found that this is not so easy .
the haslacher seal unit bodies then made a commitment to answer the questions about the future composition and size of the common parish council and the practical work of the local teams .
the work is carried out in further meetings and in a further joint meeting of all six bodies in the coming spring .
in the end , the parish council of michael schöner from steinach presented the new logo of the soulward seal unit , which was approved by a clear majority .
in pfullendorf , the electricity is more expensive than the electricity produced by the city .
the citizens pfullendorf must rely on higher electricity costs .
as the managing director of the stadtwerke , jörg-arne bias , confirmed to the south courier , a four-headed nurse is coming up with a family of 70 to 90 euros extra costs per year .
the main reason for the upcoming price increase is the increase in the so-called ec levy of 5.27.1 million tonnes , which is the equivalent of 5.277 cents per kilowatt-hour .
this levy is calculated every october by the four operators of the major power routes .
these figures show that the energy turn brings them a lot of extra costs , which they will have to pay by means of a levy on electricity prices .
the city &apos;s pfullendorf municipalities are the last link in this chain .
the supervisory board of the energy company was not even convinced in its forecasts of a higher levy , as jörg-arne bias reports .
now the specific figures would have to be calculated before the city works begin to inform their customers about the exact price increase next week .
&quot; we are moving from an increase of 1 cent plus x , &quot; bias says , with the number more likely to be near the 2 cent .
traffic lights on permanent red : on waiting time , keep an eye on the traffic lights .
sometimes a traffic light is simply not green .
the contact loop in the street does not react , or the light sign is broken .
what should be done then - driving in red ?
if a long enough person has been interested in a red light and the crossing is free , the person can continue to speak , explains the stuttgart legal advisor .
the waiting time must be &apos; reasonable &apos; , which is a matter of course different from one case to the next .
becker advises to wait at least five minutes before starting a dysfunction of the lights .
if you want to make the trip despite red lights , you have to be aware that the journey is not necessary for a loss of time .
if you want to wait less than five minutes , you may not wait long enough to hear becker and refer to a decision of the supreme court of hamm .
the negotiated case has had a driver who , after about three minutes , had to ignore the lights permanently red and had to pay for a negligent red light offence .
the traffic lights were not broken , but rather jumped little later on green .
a driving ban remained unchanged due to the particular situation - the fine was not .
the municipal council is pleased with sound budget and the commission is pleased with sound budget .
whenever there is a parade in the council , it is the mayor of ralph gerster who laughs well .
the parish bag in herdwangen-schönnach is well filled and debt has been unaware of the administration since 2005 .
the 2012 budget year can also be seen as a complete success in this respect .
this was not taken into account when the annual accounts for 2012 were presented .
as andrea rothmund explained , the administrative budget is the lowest in the eu , with around eur 7.6 million .
the surplus of the administrative budget would also be around 1.8 million euros , which would be about eur 1 million .
it is thanks to the surplus , above all , to higher commercial tax revenues and the local share of income tax .
the asset budget was again significantly higher than planned .
instead of the eur 1.5 million envisaged last year , it was eur 2.5 million .
&quot; this is essentially due to the higher feed from the administrative budget &quot; , says rothmund .
as the 2012 budget year requires less investment than planned , the financial perspective is also less important .
overall , the overall reserve was reduced by around eur 2.1 million to a total of eur 4.9 million .
mayor ralph gerster thanked rothmund and her team for the good work they did .
&quot; such a work shakes not just out of the sleeve , &quot; praised gerster with regard to the annual accounts .
he and the local councils were obviously delighted with the good figures .
it may sound paradoxical , but it is precisely these good figures that could soon cost the public a lot of money .
the good financial situation has enabled the community to respond to high hedge rates in the past .
this , in turn , has caused the gerster to receive subsidies from the country on many occasions .
the commission has already received eur 1.2 billion for these subsidies from various compensatory pockets .
among other things , the cities and municipalities that apply for grants must be given certain leverage .
&quot; the subject of hoists we have to look at , because in the coming years there will be investment for which we would like to have grants &quot; , gerster announced in this context .
nagold : hugo wermter has been working in the choir for 60 years in the nagold choir for 60 years now in the choir of the choir of the choir of the choir .
at the age of 60 , hubert wermter ’ s story is very well known at the men ’ s singing association caecilia for almost twice as long as that of the autumn festival , in which he was honored .
hubert wermter was in the colours of his male singer as usual .
even after 60 years , he is still able to sing with the now more than ever beloved choir .
in the association wermter was also active , including for 28 years as a member of the committee .
for his commitment and uniformity he received several awards : jörg kohr , pastoralreferent on behalf of the caecilienverband rottenburg-stuttgart .
his singers overcame him with the certificate of german choir association ( dfg ) and a engraved tin plate .
besides the honor , the 31st autumn festival was held in familiar courses : with the mgv betra , the song crane salzstraten , the sängerabilty baisingen and the local music club .
the mgv fullmaringen opened with atmospheric songs like &quot; im weinparadies &quot; and &quot; funny , her brethren &quot; .
her honorary singer hubert wermter was awarded the prize for a small stand - wolfgang amadeus mozart &apos;s &quot; bundeslied &quot; .
the male singer association betra sang also classical choir singing songs like &quot; jägerwerben &quot; by julius wengt , &quot; far , far away &quot; by hubert goisern and the folk song .
the song crane salzstetten created a new kind of music with its mixed choir and its women &apos;s group - the impulse chorus - for the women &apos;s quota of the festival .
the mixed choir kidnapped the young and old with the neapolitan folk &quot; santa lucia &quot; and &quot; eviva espana &quot; by antos gus to foreign countries , while the &quot; impulse &quot; also took place .
the singer department of the baisinger sportverein came up with &quot; what the swob ? &quot; by hans süsmuth and robert papperts &quot; beer song &quot; .
for the children there was a small side program - &quot; grandma hanne &quot; alias hannelore stolsteimer led a kasperltheater and read a few stories about the children who had to do good at noon .

kenyan press outrages controversy about the media law .
“ we are in a frightening situation and we cannot afford to be mistaken : what is parliament &apos;s position on this , and what is its intention , tomorrow , to simply abolish judicial independence ? ” the newspaper that published the draft law did not .
“ the law is draconian and very criminal and we reject it , ” cyrus kamau , managing director of the capital group , said .
he said that the new media tribunal “ will always be prejudiced , because it is an extended arm of the government , ” and restrictions on content and advertising would be kenya ’ s position in the global economy .
&quot; i hope the president stops listening to us and we appeal to him to respect this bill .
according to the newspaper the star , the government is taking the initiative by means of the new law , ‘ the media effectively in a stranglehold ’ , whereas the standard , democracy and freedom of speech in kenya would have suffered ‘ a heavy blow ’ and had drama .
the adoption of the law is part of a series of measures aimed at improving national security following the attacks on the civilian population by armed islamists .

concrete plans were put in place two years ago , when the fc opened the chabel room in paste , and a cost share of eur 100 000 for the construction of the square was agreed and the country received funding of eur 104 000 .

tell how this will happen in future at vienna airport .
most of the speakers are not connected to the keyboard , but the noise level is to be lowered so clearly .
a more relaxed atmosphere , is the aim of this innovation .
like airport-spokesmen peter kleemann , the german radio vienna airport is the location of transit traffic in vienna , which affects individuals , an international trend .
for example , the airports in copenhagen , frankfurt or dublin already do not have the noise pollution caused by the air traffic .
by eliminating these verdicts - on average , the sound of the sun will be around 200 personal calls per day - the loudspeaker will be more quiet at the airport .
&quot; it has also proved itself in experience that these individual failures are relatively unnoticed , at the same time as all other information on changed flight paths or departures .

sleepless in new york
on the way to their host families in weymouth , massachusetts , they learned to live in the black forest gymnasium .
after eight hours of flight , we went straight to the brooklyn bridge , which is a walk through the heart of the city , manhattan .
the first step was to find a way to get to know the city , to see the world famous skyline , which in the evening is a special attraction .
the time shift has meant that the students had to wait almost 24 hours , but in accordance with the motto &quot; the city does not sleep &quot; the day on times square was decided .
despite shutdown , the second day was the release of the statue of liberty with a ferry and on foot .
then the financial centre was about wall street to be commemorated on september 11 , 2001 .
on the third day , the students could enjoy the 373 meters high view platform of the empire-state-building .
after that , the hectic activity of the new york streets went over the rockefeller center to central park , which is an ideal opportunity to stay short in the autumn sun .
after a short flight from new york to boston , students are now in their host families and experience the atmosphere of the weymouth high school .
this year , the name day of the holy hubertus will be celebrated in the parish church of st. marien on the hulsbergstrasse .
st. hubertus was the saga of a rather ruthless hunter who was driven by a vision and later turned into the bishop of liège .
the jagdhurn group of hunters westphalia , headed by brigitte kluth , plays on parforcehorn ( natural horns in the mood it ) according to old french melodies .
the blades wear riding clothes because they are mainly riders , horses and horses .
the festive fair takes place on sunday , november 3 , at 11.30 a.m.
the newly designed glossy cover with a new café .
one thing that is essential for staying and coming back .
one that has the name to make the program .
when déjà vu is the name of a psychologist , according to the lexicon , it is expressed in the feeling that a new situation has already been experienced or seen .
in the case of the visit of the café on the opera in the district town of kleve in sight-seeing to the rhein-waal university , there is no need for the pure déjà vu feeling .
after all , the café has exactly the same purpose : to make a real stay not only in thought , but also in hand , always repeating it .
because it &apos;s fun and just beautiful .
a look into the interior of the opera 8 gives the viewer a glimpse of the city .
the ultra-modern , but not cool , café atmosphere looks like a place to feel good .
the team will spoil you with the founders mirjam van der stelt and daniel büttner at the top with a wide range of coffee and cocktail variations .
there are also delicious cakes or individually stocked fresh baked baguettes .
the owners , both 33 years old , have already established themselves before the opening of the lovely café at the opera , as a gastronomic name : in kranenburg they conducted the &quot; art lounge &quot; .
from moving to kleve at the opschlag , the sympathetic café-lovers are hoping for more audiences .
not least because of the university .
&quot; we don &apos;t have a specific target group , &quot; says daniel büttner .
instead , the two young students here want to address just as much as senior students and all ages in between .
speaking of café-lovers .
the friendly inhabited couple is behind the coffee house and the pleasure of the coffee .
enjoy the fragrant hot blowing in the various spices of the house .
express software is a software company that specializes in the development of the internet and the use of the internet .
daniel büttner is more likely to be the expresso fan and mirjam van der stelt the cappuccino drinker .
&quot; to do this , a baguette is my thing &quot; , she tells the nrz .
two events were also held in the bright café .
better said , one .
the hafenfest took place more outside - the café déjà vu benefited from it .
but there was also the ringelnatzabend .
&quot; beautiful , successful and funny &quot; , the two 33-year-olds found .
but not everyone else &apos;s business .
perhaps daniel büttner is not a very good fan of event-abenden : &quot; you can &apos;t be sure to get all right .
and with an event i speak only the ones that are also interested in the special event .
therefore events will be the exception for us .
&quot; we want to keep the normal operation as little as possible &quot; .
in other words , déjà vu also stands for reliability .
as regards the quality of the products that are offered here , as well as the team and the beautiful surroundings at the opschlag in kleve .
the road , which is becoming more and more a gastronomic mile .
to the delight of many klee , the guests from near and far and the students who will enjoy the gastromile and also the café déjà vu for themselves .

it was the 165th foundation festival to which the mgv &quot; friedrich wilhelm dinker &quot; was celebrated this year .

un proclaims new goals in poverty reduction .
the united nations is now starting to draw up a series of new objectives to meet the commitments announced twelve years ago .
in the run-up to the un summit on sustainable development , which will take place in rio de janeiro in the evening , australian diplomats played a key role in pushing “ sustainable development goals ” that would emulate the 2015 .
they were included in the final draft of the document which was drawn up by world leaders , including mrs gillard , at the summit .
un secretary-general ban ki-moon said at the summit that the time has come to “ talk about national interests . ”
“ i am pleased that the member states have agreed to reduce the burden of a process that is not only a matter of universal , sustainable development goals .
“ these goals are based on our progress from the millennium development goals .
i will spare no effort to resolve this issue , which i have been given by the member states , to reaffirm our vision of sustainable development objectives , which are based on the success of the millennium goals . ”
even if the sg achim / baden has been playing for four days without victory , the handball oberligist still enjoys a good atmosphere .
this is where trainer tomasz malmon leaves no doubt at all .
all are still fully motivated to work on the matter .
nevertheless , i hope that we will finally win again .
&quot; because i know not even anymore how such a victory tastes &quot; , he expects malmon to be a successful experience of his team .
even if the third league reserve is made up of fredenbeck , there are no trees at the moment , malmon is highlighting warnings in advance of the index finger .
many players have left in the a-jugend .
therefore , you will be against your ex-coach especially motivated .
&quot; it is also important to see whether further reinforcement can be achieved from the first one , &quot; explains the sg-coach .
to finally get back to the track of success , the european parliament must be able to compete with the united states in comparison with previous appearances .
above all , in the coverage work and switching game haperte it finally took a huge amount of time .
the use of opportunities must definitely be improved .
i therefore hope that my players will be able to play their heads free during the short break .
safety concerns in mozambique are growing in the face of clashes between influential figures and politicians who are influential in the world .
thousands of people gathered in the centre of maputo under the watchful eyes of the statue of samora machel , the founder of state and first president of mozambique to attend a rare public demonstration of peace calls .
“ we want peace again , we want stability , ” said vanessa de sousa , managing director of an investment company .
for fear of the country ’ s future , it has replaced its business clothes with a t-shirt with the inscription “ we are calling for security ” in portuguese and has moved to the independence square of the capital on thursday .
for two weeks , there have been almost daily reports of clashes between government forces and renamo , which have been one of the worst battles since the peace agreement more than 20 years ago .
renamo was once a notorious rebel movement , which initially was driven by white regimes .
after the 1992 peace treaty , it became an opposition party .
analysts believe that it is unlikely that the country will return to a full-blown conflict , but the recent events have left foreign investors and domestic residents worried .
for the fast-growing economy , there is a lot at stake , because the discovery of huge gas deposits off the coast and coal deposits in the northwest could lead to investment of more than $ 50 billion by companies like rio tinto asia in the next few years .
the ruling frelimo party , since 1975 the dominant force , and renamo give themselves the opportunity to blame for the tensions .
renamo claims that the government has not followed recent clashes by refusing to sign up to its members in sofala , a traditional high castle , on 17 october .
the attacks on the former rebels escalated when government troops renamed renamo bases in athens .
the government gives renamo the blame for the clashes and accuses the organization of attacking soldiers .
president armando guebuza has tried to raise concerns about instability .
in comparison to afp , the french news agency , he said on wednesday that dhlakama had proven to be a “ loser ” who “ lost all his remaining assets ” .
both frelimo and renamo stress that they have to avoid war .
but the concerns have increased since mazanga began to speak with the words , renamo is giving the peace agreement of 1992 .
the ft-t said that he meant that the frelimo would not have been respected .
“ our vision is to restart negotiations , and to do so seriously , ” said mazanga .
earlier talks between the parties have done little to resolve the tensions that have arisen as a result of a series of clashes this year .
“ we have two adult men here ( guebuza and dhlakama ) who have the heads together . ”
none of them are good at negotiating , and none is prepared to make the necessary concessions .
renamo , which is pressing for electoral reform , has already said that it will not be able to boycott the local elections in november .
presidential and parliamentary elections are planned for next year .
some commentators have suggested the use of violence as an attempt to impose an ailing movement , but have not yet made concessions and financial concessions from the government .
renamo ’ s electoral success has been shrinking since 1992 , while a newer party , led by a former renamo member , is democrático de moçambique ( mdm ) , presumably improving .
mazanga claims that guebuza – whose resignation is due to begin when his second term ends next year – is the country ’ s democracy to destroy .
&quot; he does not want multi-party democracy , he does not want transparent elections , he does not want peace , because he does not give up the presidency , &quot; says mazanga .
it is unclear what capacity renamo has , but it has unrest leading attacks on police stations and vehicles on a major north american highway .
most of the battles took place in the province of sofala , which is a few hundred kilometres north of maputo , but in which beira is located , the port , the mining company like rio tinto and the city .
in june , rio interrupted the use of the railways for a month after renamo launched an attack on the track .
mazanga responded cautiously to the question of whether renamo would repeat this threat .
renamo wanted to “ warn the international community that things were going well in mozambique , ” mazanga said .
the instability has increased frustration with the government .
“ people think that the government and president are responsible for the country ’ s future and are the one who should be responsible for finding solutions to the problems , ” he explains .
omar sultane , a protestant , said that people simply wanted stability .
“ no one is interested in renamo and frelimo , they just want peace again and usable roads , ” he explained .
children should be able to use myths and legends as “ models for life ” , says a author .
the stories of thor showed that “ gross violations of power do not stand a chance against clever tricks , ” and the artus legend demonstrated that the power of the two is important .
many of the myths , however , are “ far too wild , too offensive , and in some cases dirty . ”
“ i find it wonderful that in america myths and torture are being used as part of education , ” said he .
i have been saying this for twenty years now as a plan .
he added that in authors and teachers , the authors of “ excessive didactic ” are not likely to “ complete ” children .
crossley-holland , the beowulf from the anglo-saxon language and author of the penguin book of norse myths and the british folk tales , explained : “ man kann man kann man kann man kann man man man kann man man man kann man nu man man kann man nu man nu man nu man nu man nu man nu man nu man nu man n@@
perhaps the greatest difference between an adult author who is writing for adults and a author who is responsible for children is the author .
not everything needs to be simplified or added to the happy end , but there is an immanent sense of good and evil .
the latter must be underlined , by the history revealed , and must not be explained .
that is the old story of showing instead of telling .
hansjakob is once again moving to freihof .
100 years ago , heinrich hansjakob retired from his retirement in haslach , and his last years were celebrated in the &quot; freihof &quot; on sunday .
the many spectators were impressed by the extremely lively scene game .
from the arrival to the award of honour citizenship , to his death , he had written a script and hansjakobaur alois kraftzcyk .
marcus zagermann took the audience with him as spokesman through the ten different scenes , explained interrelationships and bridged jumps from youth to the near pensionation .

and then the scene game began , in which alois krafczyk once again in his paraderolle as great son of the city shone .
stilech continued with the two-wheeler and &quot; black forests foxes &quot; of erich becherer from mühlenbach .
it was not only the audience with a lot of applause , but also his sister philippine was welcome .
billy sum hermann understood that it was incredibly good to get involved in the role of the sister and he was a part of milly smith and gesture .
there are two different scenes of the game : the mühlenbacher farmer &apos;s chapel played matching music pieces and thus rounded off the performance .
the honorary citizenship was then given to haslach ’ s mayor heinz winkler , who was elected to the post of the then incumbent , together with a part of the council .
their upkeep made the tri-king singers , the hansjakob , the tribe of the new duke : &quot; oh how beautiful , youth memories are being restored to my own three-king time &quot; .
with her song &quot; o jesulein &quot; they enjoyed the audience in the freihof as well as the storchentagskinder with her loud &quot; out , out &quot; .
his criticism of the official church had been directed by hansjakob at the time , as was his concern about the excesses in agriculture , the consequences of industrialisation or the effects of war .
in the home , behind his grabbing chapel on the fire near hofstetten , he found his rest .
&quot; an unsettled spirit finally had found its rest and was home forever &quot; , said the author of the book .
i would like to congratulate and praise the audience for the performance .
basketball : the hope of neckar giants grows and the hope of the neckar giants grows .
the chances of remaining the league in the sport outgrown ludwigsburg bundesliga basketballer are increased .
if there is a wildcard procedure , there is no guarantee for the neckar giants that they will be competing less .
the basketball project hamburg towers is not responsible for any application for a possible follow-up job .
&quot; we will not participate in the wildcard process , &quot; said former national player pascal scooter , who has been developing the concept for a professional club in the hanseatic city since 2012 .
a first breathing was in ludwigsburg , however , not to be heard .
&quot; we did not deal with the wildcard procedure until we were clear that düsseldorf was not granted a licence , &quot; said neckar-giant boss alexander reil of our newspaper .
until 23 may , auctioneers and auctioneers of düsseldorf basket can still submit documents to the arbitration court and prove their economic suitability .
so far , the rhineland has been denied the license twice .
the arbitration court is the last instance .

in a new zealand town burt muro is considered a charming town .
burt is a herbal , despite a heart failure .
with its savings , a few donations and a mortgage on its old workshop facilities , the company is continuing to invest by ship to los angeles .
after the film there is coffee , tea and cake .
the shiny piepses do not disturb residents and residents of the area .
rhenus midgard also worked on land , and he was the first to do so .
they distribute the information coming from the ships on the half of the pile .
the company has several eigs at the site in the fire .
besides the coal import , rhenus midras also uses the new windy drive system , which is also used in the production of wind turbines .
black shimmers the coal on the storage place in front of the dike .
two huge blue tits of the tits and the rechargeable units distribute or reload the coal here as needed .
every movement of the transshipment devices sounds a shiny warning sound .
&quot; the signals serve to provide security and are prescribed by law , &quot; says matthias schrell , managing director of rhenus midgard in wilhelmshaven .
in case of unfavourable winds , this is unfortunately widely heard - and so there were already some complaints from people from the north of the city .
he takes the complaints very seriously and therefore i have contacted the people concerned , says the 40-year-old .
in close consultation with the authorities , we are now in the process of drawing up the warning signals with technical measures more quietly .
i am also counting on open dialogue with our neighbours in the future .
matthias schrell has a lot to do before the site .
with the expansion of the lower saxony bridge , rhenus midgard continues to rely on coal imports for power stations and is a major player in this sector in europe .
thanks to the 18.5 meter deepened tank in front terminal , the caves can be used for long time now .
&quot; this year we want to be the 3 million dollar turnover in the envelope &quot; , says schrell .
in addition to the on-site eon power plant , import coal is going to power stations in the inland region .

the three ship loaders on the bridge and the second transport band could transport up to 10 million .
bayern basketballer despite his first defeat , optimistic yet optimistic , the german basketball team won the first place .
even the first defeat in the euroleague was won by the basketball players of the fc bayern munich .
&quot; no one can forbid us to believe that we are also against the best team in europe over the past two years , &quot; bayern-coach svetislav pesic reported on the unfortunate 83 : 888 .
we have sent the message : even in munich , basketball exists !
when she first appeared in the european royal class , she sold her coins for a long time , and in the decisive stages of the show , they simply didn &apos;t have a clear answer .
the guests first created the piece of art , a 15-point backlog , 13 minutes before the end , and then transformed into a guided tour before piraeus could once again turn the game into a turning point .
&quot; we have been incredibly rewarded against the two-time euroleague champion in the first place , but then again with a slight mistake &quot; , said bayern-profi yassin idbihi .
we are proud of our performance , but we want to win any game .

ben greenman : ten years of new york comedy festival : the new york city comedy festival : the new yorker
one might say that new york city is the birthplace of stand-up couples .
over the years , fays innovation has been developed , as was the latest in the new york comedy festival .
the foundation of the company is the foundation of the company &apos;s philosophy .
“ most of these headliners began to work with carolines and were then increasingly successful until they were released at some point , to be in a club . ”
we have designed this festival so that we can continue working with you .
at this year &apos;s event there are performances by wanda sykes , kathy griffin and bill maher as well as by &quot; stand up for heroes &quot; , an annual music and comedy show .
the festival also marks the world of comedy .
a number of comedians who this year will be participating in the festival are about rather unconventional ways to learn , such as broadcasts on smaller tv channels such as comedy central , fx and spike .
nick kroll was born with a sitcom on cable tv ( the ironic slip of fantasy football ) .
jenny slate was at both saturday night live and the show at “ parks and recreation ” .
both kroll and slave and other young comedians with characteristic voices ( the surreal pessimistic anthony jeselnik , the irony of the earth , based on racial themes w. kaumasenthyu ) are .
the largest magnet of visitors to the festival is an interview : david steinberg talks with larry david .
steinberg started as a stand-up comedian , but has become a respected tv and film director .
from 2005 to 2007 he held a television programme with the title “ sit down and watch ” .
the meeting takes place in town hall in the middle of manhattan .
“ the city is definitely in the comedy dna of larrys gang arbeit ” , said steinberg .
he told me that if he is here , i go to see the gas stations between two buildings and think of : hey , if i have to pay all my money , then live me .

&quot; after years , i have reached agreement with the international atomic energy agency to reduce the differences between the last few years . &quot; he wrote , &quot; the international atomic energy agency , mohammed jawad sarif .
it would be a long way to go , but the nuclear negotiator was not satisfied with the negotiation process and was also optimistic that both sides would eventually reach a solution .
drama in uruguay : young kills playkamderaden with machete and machete .
two children have died in uruguay of the murder of a 11-year-old .
the two 14 and 12 year-old boys had invited their victims to meet them in bird hunting .
with machetes and knives , the knives armed the 11-year-old and threw the corpse into the ground .
then they would have been in a working-class quarter playing football in front of their homes .
the corpse was used in the night after the village of cerro pelado , 15 kilometres north of the exclusive village of cerro pelado .
as an alibi , a five-year half-sister of the younger , who had taken her with her , should say that she was sexually attacked by the young .
but when the girl was exposed to the police without mentioning a attack , she was not able to give up her .
the reason the older one called , among other things , a rivalry in the football match .
it was initially transformed into a psychiatric youth institute .
pimps must be put in prison
because of exploitative trafficking in human beings , pimps , threats , insults and dangerous physical injury , the konstanz district court has appointed a 33-year-old man from st. georgen to three and a half years &apos; imprisonment .
the former german military soldier who was killed in afghanistan after two operations was a turkish fighter , laid the foundations for a united front within the framework of a process agreement .
so he has made women more aware of internet or telephone contacts in five cases , which he has not yet received after a few weeks against her will .
he was resisted by violence and threats to break .
women &apos;s income , which is partly due to him for years , is still very low .
confiscation of mobile phones and sim cards is a way to subvert women ’ s contacts to the outside world .
together with a colleague who has conveyed the women , he brought them to various brothels in the southwest .
he was a member of the nazi party , and was responsible for the war .
in court , the defendant initially claimed that he was suffering from a serious trauma after colleagues in afghanistan had been killed next to him in an explosion .
after a psychiatric expert has had serious doubts about the psychological constraint and thus about a limited liability , the court of justice placed the 33-year-old in a position to make a comprehensive confession .
the court did not have to pay any more women who were injured .
like a critic , the commission has been able to make a decision after a first call through telephone surveillance measures .
the interviews were of high aggression , and the council was not prepared to accept them .
in later interrogation , the injured parties would have confirmed their martyrdom .
another witness , in which one of the women is blue on the whole body , was found up to now , not to say .
it is about &apos; a completely broken world of personality &apos; , which is condemning violence and exploitation in this profession as normal .
the defendant regretted his behaviour yesterday .
&quot; he has made himself out of these circles and wants to be a normal life after the detention , &quot; he said .
oil prices continue to fall to $ 96 per barrel .
the price of oil is still falling on friday , after concerns about a high supply cast a shadow over a report that says that the energy-hungry manufacturing sector in china is growing .
the reference crude variety for deliveries in december was available at the end of the morning in europe in electronic commerce at the new york mercantile exchange by 14 cents to 96.24 usd .
the treaty fell by 39 cents on thursday , which resulted in a price drop of 5.8 percent in october .
the large oil supply has the prices in the last few weeks .
the us department of energy announced on wednesday that the us supply had been increased by 4.1 million barrels last week .
over the course of five weeks , the offer was reduced by 25 million barrels .
but on friday there were indications of increased demand by two reports on an increase in activity in chinese manufacturing .
this indicates a continued need for recovery in china ’ s economy , whose growth has been set to 7.8 % in the third quarter , after the previous year ’ s growth was at its lowest since two decades .
crude oil from the brent variety , a reference value for international crude oil , which is also used by us refineries .
court blocks decision to stop the trial .
a federal court of appeal in the united states blocked the order of a judge on thursday who had made changes to the stop and freeze fund programme .
the second us court of appeal declared that the decisions of judge shira apparently were not respected , until more than a appeal of the city was made .
the judge had a meeting in august , which was a fortress in which the city was violating the constitution and the way in which the programme for holding and interviewing people was implemented .
the city appealed against its assessment and the subordinate remedies that included the decision to establish a surveillance office to monitor the situation .
the court of appeal heard on tuesday the arguments for the requested suspension of the proceedings .
the appeal report stated that the judge must be informed of the case .
the judge had judged that police officers should be injured in the civil rights of tens of thousands of people because they were being inadequately targeted black and latin american men with the stalling code .
she appointed an external body to monitor the implementation of major changes , including reforms of directives , training and services .
in august , the city of new york agreed to extend the practice of storing names and addresses of people who are still in the process of being re-extradited after police control .
an oral negotiation to appeal to the city is not possible after march 14 , 2014 .
the stop and freeze shops are a good example of this .
such controls have been in place for decades in various forms , but the number of checks recorded during the term of the party &apos;s mayor , michael bloomberg , has increased to an all-time high of 684.330 in 2011 , the number of latin america in 2011 .
in 2004 , four men representing all minorities were arrested and sentenced to death .
advocates of stop bailouts should be encouraged to use the nypd ’ s stop-and-frisk program to stop unfair practices and to build a more trustworthy and effective police force , as well as the way of governing the way of the bureau .
opponents believe that the changes will undermine the morality of the police , but not criminality ; nor would money be wasted and the broader problem of a police force that is not resolved after thousands of police have disappeared in the last decade .
the judge has pointed out that the court of justice has not yet ratified the stop and frisk practice , which is constitutionally based , but only the type of implementation of controls by the nypd .

coulson used phone hacking for checking a timing .
the former news of the word editor andy coulson put the spotlight on “ telephone hacking , surveillance , and confrontation ” in an attempt to get a false tip about an affair of the former minister of the interior .
prosecutor andrew edis qc declared to the court in the old bailey , news of the world in may 2005 a false rumor that the court would have ruled that clarke had a relationship with his “ attractive special adviser . ”
the newspaper commissioned the private detective glenn mulcaire to investigate pawlbys voicemails .
“ the prosecutor ’ s office believes that coulson , now the editor of the notary , is not a person who is in front of the house of people and hopes to bring them to life with fresh deeds , but rather a person .
he said that nothw uses three methods to tell stories investigative .
the publisher is personally involved in the third method .
he obviously knows about the second , the monitoring , otherwise it cannot be .
what about the first ?
does he know about the telephone hacking ?
he is arguing this , but we say , ‘ and whether he knew of it ’ .
rumors about an affair clarke were first published by the feature review .
a band with voicemails from your phone of at least three occasions was released in august 2006 in mulcaires apartment .
the investigators also found entries on the computer of the detective , on which pawlby and their sister were called “ projects ” .
in the time when research was being carried out , the scientists received a lot of money from pawlby .
meanwhile , the us president , former chief editor neviille thurlbek , and former chief executive officer of the united states , supervised the surveillance of movements of pawlby .
on 18 june 2005 , coulson left her a voicemail with the following content : “ i have a story that we will release tomorrow .
eis explained that coulson &apos;s activities in this story followed the same pattern as in other important personalities , such as the former interior minister david blunkett .
the sworn heard on thursday that coulson blunkett was being arrested for an affair with a married woman .
coulson and brooks disagree with other conspiracies .
mulcaire , thurlbeck and weather forecast have the telephone system hacking .

gechingen : no absolute protection possible !
&quot; we want to inform the inhabitants of the planning process early on , &quot; mayor jens häeßler opened the citizens &apos; information event on the flood protection concept in gechingen .
around 80 participants were involved in the municipal hall to view the planned measures .
häßler made it clear : &quot; the ultimate decisions shall be taken by the members of the municipal council &quot; .
the floods , the pockets , which hit the island on 15 may 2009 , were a serious event .
a river basin study was linked to the neighbouring municipality of aidlingen , which is now the basis for the flood protection concept in gechingen .
&quot; protecting the largest number of buildings built is the goal &quot; , says steußler .
the planning of the protection against a german weather law is based on statistics of every 100 years to expected floods .
climate change is caused by a 15 % increase in the price .
in specialist circles , this is done with &quot; hq 100aklima &quot; .
the water masses that were installed in gechingen in 2009 caused considerable damage were in line with a 1000-year flooding .
&quot; absolute protection is not available , but a relative improvement can be achieved &quot; , says steinler .
to protect hq 100aklima protection , you must have a valid passport in gechengen , with the municipality having a national subsidy of around eur 70 per cent .
häßler pointed out , however , that it only gives support if a total concept is implemented .
the town is also interested in the participation of the citizens .
a complex and sophisticated planning and approval process is necessary to ensure that the necessary information is available .
at best , 2016 could start implementing it .
among other things , the protection concept , which was adopted in the municipal council last week ( we reported ) , provides for local measures in the influx of irm river from the home of the tribal .
following the presentation of the flood protection concept , the participants took the opportunity to discuss their concerns .
among other things , it has been questioned why more dams and restraint pools were planned to protect the site .
gregor kühn , the engineer of the commissioned engineering office forest and corbe from hügelsheim , who presented the concept , stressed that it was the interaction of all presented measures to be in the sum .
moreover , it is necessary to consider the most economical solution , joachim wald and corbe .
displeasure was felt in the area of the alttor , which was still very popular even in normal storms .
the problem is known to the administration and the first measures have already been taken .
häßler , however , pointed out that the guidelines for channel systems are different from those for flood protection and not to be confused .
the community is obliged to use the channel network in such a way that two to three years of regeneration can be compensated .
the sewage channels larger to dimensioning would disguise millions .
the most serious injured following collision
on friday afternoon , the national road will take you to the village of revensdorf , 44 , where two drivers are seriously injured during a frontal collision .
the police shut the street off immediately completely , but could be forced to leave little to the accident .
however , there are various testimonies that have only been evaluated .
it is clear that the 19-year-old leader of a vw golf is heading towards revensdorf and the 38-year-old man from gettorf is with her hyundai .
both vehicles had a clash , with the woman being so hard hit that the fire brigade was barely half an hour needed to get her out of the vehicle wreck .
the actual cause of the accident was initially unclear .
both failed to arrive in nearby hospitals .
the track remained in full swing for about two hours .
it could be called the dostojewski of the united states .
philip k. dick was a godfather , a metaphysicist , his novels and narratives also have something serial .
astonishing the kinship in the outer : the glittering eyes , the beard , the high forehead .
and so , as fjodor m. dostojewski with his massive oeuvre as founder and appologie of the russian soul , to understand , one reads philip k. dick as american prophet .
some titles are published in heyne verlag , the haffmans cassette with the 118 narrations distributes two thousand .
dick explains america - the kingdom of the breathtaking technical advances , coupled with paranoia , security mania , and belief that he will be chosen .
dick had worshipped on the subject of god &apos;s experiences , his late books read like a mixture of revelation of john and a computer manual .
perhaps he was crazy , drugs had left his brain .
he has captured early on that the machines divinities are .
he wrote a theology of the computer and asked what a person would think of a machine that would be the creator of his creature .
this is the blade runner problem .
killing .
a master of science fiction .
a fantastic writer .
his stories have filmdirectors such as ridley scott , paul verhoeven and steven spielberg inspired .
this story is now particularly significant .
the &apos; minority report &apos; is from the year 1956 , it deals with the problems of the european union &apos;s cold war and the mccarthy crisis .
the principle of &apos; pre-crime &apos; is being developed here , &apos; pre-crime &apos; , that is , what has now become more or less official doctrine of the white house .
in dicks , who are the most appalling in the world , mutants look to the future - and the police are intervening .
&quot; we collect individuals who violate no law whatsoever , &quot; said the author of the book .
&quot; we &apos;re happy to welcome you to our new website , even before you can commit a violent crime .
and : &quot; in our society there are no serious criminals , we have a criminal offender full of pesudo-criminals &quot; , who read time flows .
they assume that the worst happens , and prevent the rest of the criminal idea from being put into practice .
dick ’ s narrative looks like the blueprint for the anti-terrorist laws and the interrogation of the nsa .
anticipation. the attack was not working like that , but obama ’ s drone philosophy and practice .
but thick ’ s story is not over yet .
the chief of police complains that there is no separation of powers .
then the supervisor will be monitored himself and a future crime will be transferred .
the system is turning .
it is perfect , but it lies .
it invents its own prerequisites .
if errors and sacrifices are not only accepted , but are based on them .
the system creates the danger that it is fighting .
philip k. dick read is the word that is repeatedly being used to explain the truth .
late catholics in russia testify to merkel ’ s statements in russia that he has made statements in russia that he has not yet made statements in russia .
the former us intelligence exporter , edward snowden , could be arrested in the us late opera for chancellor angela merkel .
representatives of the german federal bar could either ask questions in writing or answer the 30-year-old personally in russia , the agency interfax reported .
previously , the green federal government member hans christian hahn had a job in the first german politician snowden in moscow yesterday .
nsa revelations strengthen corporate paranoia because of state surveillance .
the hotel is situated in the heart of the city , close to the train station and the train station .
at the federal office of the constitutional protection and counter-terrorism ( bvt ) , the german interior secretariat , he should sign the umbrella of the us outpost , which is less than 5 km away from the european central bank .
according to the german media , the bvt wanted to prevent the presence of surveillance antennas and the action led to a change of words between the us and the german foreign ministry in berlin .
james clapper , u.s. director of the national intelligence agency , insisted in september that the us government should not allow for the foreign gaming industry to be sprung . “ in order to keep the business secrets of foreign companies on behalf of us companies .
but since edward snowden , who has been a whistleblower , he has been working with the publication of his horn of surveillance officers in the us .
reports that the american national security agency has called on the brazilian oil company petrobas to take over the us security agency are being dismissed .
the barrel of overflow brought the revelation that chancellor angela merkel ’ s phone was twisted , perhaps for ten years .
if the most powerful person in europe is targeted , then the most powerful people are certainly those who are in the process of achieving potential goals .
snowden has been involved in intensive cooperation between us secret services and companies in a transparent manner .
i believe it is possible that this data could be used for mutual benefit .
“ germany must wake up , ” explains oliver green , president of bitmi , the small and medium-sized it companies in germany .
german companies believe that the us has now been at almost the same risk as china in industrial espionage and data theft .
in the snowden mountains , the snow leaked documents have not yet shown that the european union is the world ’ s business secrets of foreign companies .
politicians have expressed concern that the eu ’ s policies are being followed by certain it and internet options and that they are reducing their dependence on the us .
companies are sceptical about this .
in the bundestag , it was proposed that we should build a german google .
i can only close my eyes and slowly open them again ...
“ that is not how it works ” , says hasso plattner , chairman of the german software manufacturer sap .
if we want a strong european it industry , then we would have no choice but to exclude it 20 years ago .
all in germany is subsidised , from coal to gas and from oil to agriculture .
everything except the it industry .
nevertheless , the scope and technical refinement of the snows ’ revelations have been uncovered by the snowden revelations .
cloud computing has a big change , because european business leaders are now more aware of how the global economy is changing .
according to a survey conducted by the cloud security alliance , a trading institution that conducted a survey on the security of the united states , the unveiling of the us data mines caused a total of 200 000 deaths .
jim snabe , deputy managing director of sap , says : “ we see a new question from customers who are looking for a year ago .
many german business leaders believe that the latest reports simply confirm that the company is doing what it already knew .
the fact that economic espionage is taking place is no surprise .
that has always been the case .
“ it was a topic and has been a topic for many years and the current discussion has not changed fundamentally , ” says kurt bock , chairman of the chemical company basf .
americans are spying on us on commercial and industrial levels , so is our own .
the management boast not normally about the retaliatory measures that have been taken , because that gives an opportunity to attackers .
in large companies employees have been integrated for a long time , that the use of a free usb stick on a fair or the unattended song on the premises of a laptop is not permitted .
ulrich hackenberk , member of the board of managing directors of audi , says that it has been standard practice for years to be able to control the mobile phones before a board meeting so that they are not used as interceptors .
the german bvt advises managers to use simple prepaid phones to get the best out of the country .
the prepaid phones are being used later .
there is , however , concern that small and medium-sized enterprises are vulnerable to hacking and monitoring .
in germany , many of these companies are global market leaders in the respective niche .
“ small and medium-sized enterprises often lack the experience to hire staff and financial resources to protect business secrets effectively against unauthorized access . ”
the us warns its firms against economic espionage by other countries .
according to washington post , the us national intelligence estimate reported france , russia , and israel to be behind china in february , with two countries in the region committed to obtaining economic data .
a member of the board of directors of a german blue chip company agreed to the idea of economic espionage , then “ the french are the worst . ”

kendrick johnson from valdosta in the us state of georgia was arrested in a prison camp on 11 january .

“ they are convinced that their son was murdered , ” said benjamin crump , the lawyer of kenneth and jacquard .
they would never have believed that he had died as he was .
&quot; they believe that it is possible to escape any logic , to fight against the laws of physics as well as against common sense .
they are more convinced that the truth will be covered up to disguise the person or person responsible for the death of their son .
&quot; her son went to school to learn and came to the body bag &quot; , commented on .
us prosecutor michael moore said on thursday that there will be a formal investigation into johnson ’ s death , because a number of important questions remain unresolved .
what was the cause of death ?
is his death due to a crime ?
moore declared at a press conference on thursday afternoon .
i follow the facts in which you are heading .
my aim is to find out the truth .
“ i take the view that a sufficient number of people should be provided with a formal basis , ” he said .
moore told reporters who were initially autoplating that the government would not be able to stop the war .
a second autopsy , however , has led to another cause of death , moore argues .
“ there are a number of questions that need to be answered or confirmed , ” he said .
moore added , if there are sufficient evidence for a criminal prosecution or civil prosecution , to the death of johnson .
a representative of the county sheriffs authority was on our request on thursday .
a court in southern georgia ordered the death of the president on wednesday .
the parents of the teenager said they hoped that the video recording would give evidence that the children had been caught .
cdc publish allergenic guidelines for schools and schools .
on wednesday , the csrs for education and training published a report on the progress of the european union in the field of health and safety .
these are the first such directives that the us government has issued .
one in 20 children in the united states has now become allergic to food .
the spread of food allergies among children has increased by 20 % between 1997 and 2007 , according to the cdc .
the guidelines contain information for schools that are registered with the teacher and the staff for awareness of food allergies and how to deal with children .
it is also recommended that schools use epinephrine in advance – the auto inventory is a major part of the epidemic ’ s car injection – to escape a potentially deadly over-sensitivity reaction .
the legislators in the federal states have recently changed the rules so that schools can use epinephrin more easily .
the report also lists typical symptoms , which are not understood by children , who have an allergic reaction .
children may say : “ it feels like it is something on my tongue . ”
parents of intersexual children can be ‘ gender undetermined ’ .
germany is the first european nation in which a third gender is responsible for children , who are living with unclear genital mutilation .
newborn children are no longer infected with rigid male or female .
under the new law , parents no longer need to declare sex for such children , but can “ be undefined ” or “ not defined ” on the birth certificate .
the aim of the law is to reduce pressure on parents to avoid surplus children .
an intersexual person said , according to bbc years later , “ i am neither man nor woman . ”
i stay the patchwork that is being carried out by doctors , but i am not being fooled and full of scars .
it is estimated that one in 2 000 children die each year , neither as a young nor as a girl .
they are among the intersexual , a group that is under the diagnosis of ‘ sexual differentiation disorder ’ ( dsd ) , a collective body that is intended for people with atypical chromosomes , germs and others .
valais simpson was probably intersexually .
understanding the gender identification is even more important than understanding the gender dimension , but most experts in the us suggest that we should not forget the best available information on gender equality .
the new york psychiatrist dr. jack drescher , who has been focusing on the problem of gender identification , said that the new german law “ blade after a good cause ” .
intersexual children are an ethical dilemma .
“ some people have life-threatening diseases that cause a surgical intervention .
you can use gender assignment without surgery and then wait to see how the identity develops .
the scientific data on how a child can actually improve its gender identity is not very accurate .
no one knows why it is happening .
it is like the secret why people are homosexual .
in a report to the european commission in 2011 , it says that intersexual people are affected by transsexual violence or transgenic trafficking .
these characteristics were reflected in secondary sexual and psychological characteristics such as muscle mass , male hair , and breasts .
the report also provides an overview of discrimination , which is becoming a reality in both intersexual and transgender people in professional life and the extent of harassment , violence and prejudice .
it is not the gender dimension that matches the young .
in the meantime , it is available in australia and nepal for adults to work on official documents male , female or “ third gender ” .
in june , australian norrie may-welby ( 52 ) was the first “ gendless ” person worldwide to be recognized after a court ruled that lifelong retention of a “ undefined ” gender status .
german cards have a number of different names in the future , in addition to m and w , x for intersexually , so the ministry of the interior .
in neighbouring france , gender issues are still a controversial issue .
in 2011 , dozens of french members of the strictly catholic country signed a petition calling for the “ gender theory ” to be removed from school books .
the us website catholic online has also opposed the german law .
the mother of a newborn maryland said to baby zone , she caught the baby .
“ the parent is a child without any further restrictions .
children need stability and security .
historically , children who have been treated with both male and female immune diseases have been treated as victims of hermaphrodites , after which attractive and attractive greek god , both sexes had .
ten years ago , the medical community regarded the gender as something that could be wiped out and then rebuilt .
but the ethical foundations of an operation are now being questioned , as it is now known how complex gender identity is , and that doctors are also being misled , because they are unaware of how the child is performing .
“ in the middle of the 20th century , one called psychiatric emergency , ” said dr. drescher .
if such a child was born , then one did not call the psychiatrist , but the surgeon .
the prevailing theory about the treatment of children with unclear genital tissues is based on dr. john money of the johns hopkins university , who argued that the problem of gender is formal .
he used the term “ gender identity ” and argued that the social and environmental impact of gender violence was not the same as that of parents .
but in a document entitled “ john / joan ” , the european union ’ s foreign policy was not fully implemented .
he advised the parents of a young boy whose penis was taken to a botched curtailment .
“ money presented this case as a successful example of a transformation of the economy , which he was not , ” says drescher .
when the boy was about 15 , he changed back to the male gender and married the girl .
38 but he did commit suicide .
according to drescher , there are still doctors who practice this model .
but in the 1990 ’ s , with the internet ’ s , survivors of these gender operatives were bound to the public , who “ did not feel happy with the outcome . ”
for example , at jim bruce , a 36 year-old writer from montana who was born with xy-male chromosomes , but ambiguous genital genitalia .
the doctors were unclear about whether he would have a big cattoris or a small penis , and were convinced that he could never have a “ satisfactory life ” as a man .
so his external body and the high level of the teeth were quickly removed from the surgery shortly after the birth in 1976 , and he was raised as a girl .
at the age of 12 he was given female hormones .
“ i knew that i was not a girl , ” he told abcnews.com that i was a girl .
i was unhappy , but it was really difficult to ask questions .
at the age of 18 , he was supposed to receive a vaginal plastics .
but , as he was depressed and knew that he was not voting , he wasn ’ t asking for his medical records .
what he found was shocking .
i was born in sterilized – and nobody told me .
bruce was played by actor john mccoy .
after learning the truth , he changed his mind to the male identity , received testosteron-injektionen and settled his breasts .
the surgery has made it infertile .
today he is fighting for others in an organization called interface project to make intersexuals a norm .
but anne tamar-mattis , managing director of the california institute of technology , has been a major contributor to the global information network .
“ many activists are concerned that the german decision would encourage parents to make quick decisions and to give the child a , not fixed , “ he said .
we fear that this will favour intervention .
we think it would be better to leave the male or female gender in the same way and then wait for it to happen .
but we do not yet know how the law will affect , so we can only speculate .
tamar-mattis said that her organisation supports the australian law , because “ it allows adults to be recognised as a third gender . ”
“ adults should be able to make their own decisions about their legal gender . ”
the german law is about the allocation of funds to the birth .
this is not a battle to be won by small children at this time .
if you are grown up , you can decide for yourself on your body .
but dr. arlene baratz , a brustradiologist from pittsburg , who was a daughter with a sexual differentiation disorder and who had hundreds of others in a self-help group , says that german law .
katie , the daughter of baratz , was born with male chromosomes , has a history of dsd called complete android resistance .
due to the recipe defect of the target cells for testosterone , katie developed female characteristics .
it has a vagina , but not a uterus and no ovaries .
today katie 29 and married in 1848 .
it is infertile , but it hopes to be able to grow up in the future by adopting or a surrogate mother .
“ the law gives parents room , which means that they do not have to make hasty decisions , ” baratz said .
it gives you the time to test different tests and to clarify things and gives you time to do them “ males ” .
in this way , everything is fine – you pull the child big and loves it .
the hotel is very close to the train station and the train station .
and you don ’ t have to do an operation too quickly that doesn ’ t go undone anymore .
“ this includes the children in the decision and eliminates the fear that parents might be exaggerated because they believe that they are not doing the right thing , ” explains the children .
ultimately , the child decides on the gender that is better suited to it – and that is wonderful .
this will enable children to learn the decision themselves .
unknown are injuring girls by shot from car .
unknown persons have no right to a twelve hour period in saxony-anhalt in case of shots from a car .
the perpetrators had a chance to meet the police on thursday evening in genghin with an air pressure gun on a group of children .
this was reported by the police in burg .
the girl is easily left wade , and the woman is still in the street .
rescue forces brought the girl to hospital .
the shot came from a small car that was attacked on a group of six children and suddenly was shot .
witnesses saw two people sitting in the car .
the perpetrators also shot at a bus stop .
a disc collapsed .
then they moved .
the criminal police are investigating , it was said on friday .
until now , police inspections at kempten have been able to access a quiet halloween night .
officials were only sentenced to egg children twice , who were forced to take them against house facades .
since homeowners have recognized this in time and the iron crates of the same distance , no material damage should have occurred .
furthermore , in the city area , some sylvesterböller were ignited , but here too there is no material damage .
a living person in the bishop friendly village path reported that the village was closed with a monastery paper .
until the police arrived , the man took his wheelchair apertures in the immediate vicinity , however , all rediscovered them , so the police did not have to continue acting .
living with future prospects
waltraud ries actually lives in a dreamlike way .
your house is located in a quiet residential area of stuttgart with lots of green , an old tree stock , nice neighbours and also not too much traffic .
the city is only a few minutes away by public transport .
&quot; i hope you will not be afraid of spiders ? &quot; asked waltraud ries and shows on a fat spider on the door frame .
i have been looking for a new apartment for my husband and myself for some time .
but you know how difficult this is in stuttgart .
the reason is not spherical phobia , but the concern to be able to see the many steps to the house and the apartment at old age , explains her .
moreover , since a meniscus operation , the mittfiftieth woman has had to learn what it means to deal with handicapped people from the floor .
recently , a book was published by her on the subject of &apos; happy living in old age - what form of living is the best for me ? &apos; .
&apos;our apartment is the best example of what is not possible in old age &apos; , begins to tell you .
when you were in the process of being in milan with your husband over 20 years ago , it was just a nice apartment in the middle of the green .
today , with the middle of fifty , waltraud ries thinks differently about it .
but she also knows that she is one of the few people who has ever been involved in the subject of &apos; living in old age &apos; .
most people are displacing it as long as it goes .
the only old people are always &apos; , says she smiles .
only when the pressure of suffering is really great will we be concerned .
&quot; then it can be too late , &quot; says richard wagner .
in her book , the interior architect presents 17 models of living for a self-determined age .
&apos;whatever accommodation you choose , however , is always an individual choice &apos; , explains it .
d i e solution there are not for age .
even those who have taken the retirement home in tuscany or brittany can afford to pay more attention to the fact that they are also able to become ill .
and &apos; without good knowledge of the language , the agreement can also be reached in dolce vita , &apos; the specialist bookseller shall discontinue the use of the language .
among their models , classic carers are available , alternative forms of living or the often quoted retirement wg .
at age , everyone has their ticks and maces .
&apos;for me , such a community would be nothing &apos; , she says with a wink .
even less than in a student who is with a common bathroom and a kitchen .
&quot; in old age , you just need to have your retreat rooms &quot; , ries says .
the fact that a senior community of residents can work , however , is something that the author does not want to exclude .
that should be done differently from what we have in the classical student world cup .
and sometimes you just want to have your rest , &quot; she believes .
this is the view that it has taken , at least in the capital of the country .
&apos;most of the old people in stuttgart want to stay in their own home as long as they go , &apos; is also the experience of theresa rütten , the head of the public service living at the age of the capital .
your service advises people around the topic of &apos; older people &apos; .
that is why it is the elderly who would often be exposed to inconvenience and restrictions , just to be able to stay in their usual environment , and that is also the experience of the warentest foundation .
there are many ways to make the house or apartment accessible today .
ries recommends that all those who are concerned with the age-appropriate renovation of their home or apartment be aware of the fact that they are not the first to offer their craftsmen a thorough job .
today , there are also plans for the age-appropriate reconstruction of the building .
even in the rental apartment , let one or other realize that and if it is only the toilet facilities .
but it is not always possible to use the existing flat to suit the age of the individual , and therefore to create the barrier free of charge , even if it is still so beautiful .
waltraud ries had to experience it .
although there is a tree-lifts in the apartment , which can be fitted with stairs , which can be paved with stairs , it would be far more difficult to get around .
it will continue to search until you find the ideal object for yourself and your husband .
before moving gray it gray more than before the spinning on your home door .
the us wants to continue to prosecute snowden .
the us has changed its stance on former us intelligence officer edward snowden .
he is still accused of being unauthorised to disclose secret information .
therefore , in the us , he must face a criminal trial , as the us secretary of state , jennifer proudly said , in washington .
the recent statements by snowden would also be unchanged .
previously , the german green politician hans-christian ströbele had a meeting with snowden in moscow after a meeting with the us to call on him not to continue to threaten him with punishment .
psaki stressed that this is a flow of energy , which is a parliamentary expression .
intelligence revelers edward snowden is to be conversated with german authorities .
first , however , he wants to know his situation .
the report submitted by the united states has shown this to the former nsa staff in a letter that was not addressed , which the green politician hans-christian ströbele sent on friday after a meeting with snowden .
the letter has been written after a popular translation : the german word &quot; the english word &quot; .
i would like to ask the competent authorities to look at the relevant authorities in the member states and to see whether they can give them a clear answer .
i have been asked to give you a reply regarding your inquiry into mass surveillance .
i am a friend of edward joseph snowden and used to be a contractual partner or a direct employee as a technical expert at the national security agency .
in my employment in these institutions , i have witnessed systematic violations of the law by my government , which , on a moral obligation , prompted me to act .
as a result of the publication of these concerns , i have been faced with a serious and persistent heat that forced me to leave my family and my home country .
i live in exile at the moment and enjoy temporary work in the european union , which the russian federation has granted me under international law .
i am encouraged by the resonance with regard to my political action , both in the united states and elsewhere .
citizens around the world and also high officials - including the united states - have been using the revelations to create a system of all-encompassing surveillance that does not hold anyone accountable .
this spy revelation has attracted many suggestions for new laws and policies .
the benefits for society from these acquired findings are not only being made clearer ; at the same time , the risks taken have been significantly reduced .
although the result of my efforts has been demonstrably positive , my government continues to be dissens as a loyal and seeks to change political opinions .
nevertheless , to speak the truth is not a crime .
i am confident that the government of the united states , with the support of the international community , will abandon this harmful attitude .
i hope that when the difficulties of this humanitarian situation are resolved , i will be able to support the european union &apos;s responsible efforts to clarify the facts relating to the humanitarian aid provided .
i look forward to talking to you in your country as soon as the situation is clarified and thank you for your efforts to respect international law , which we all have to protect .
edward snowden testifies to hans-christian ’ s work in the field of the arts and sciences .
kindergarten has found a private buyer .
&quot; the building is in good hands &quot; , says winterlingen ’ s mayor michael maier .
the former kindergarten in the garden street has been handed over to a private person by the municipality .
the council agreed to the sale in its recent meeting in the non-public sector .
the building changed its owner to a &quot; reasonable &quot; price .
&quot; the community is satisfied , &quot; says maier .
100 000 euros were set aside in the budget .
it is not yet clear how the new owner will be able to use the former kindergarten .
the mayor is right that winterlingen is responsible for the building before winter to someone else .
&quot; this effort is now gone , &quot; maier is happy to do .
the concert at the high summer temperatures is a great success .
the musikverein hammereisenbach presents a concert on the terrace of the inn hammer .
as a conductor bianca willmann at 7.30 p.m. , he was the tenth to show the thermometer that still shows 25 degrees .
about 50 people are delighted with the sound of the music of the hammricher musicians .
president manuela honeck explains the music pieces .
honeck thanked all those who helped to create a new booth for the first music hock .
report : obama campaign considered biden to be replaced by hillary clinton .
the closest advisors to president barack obama have been thinking in secret , vice president joe biden in 2012 ’ s election campaign by hillary clinton , as the new york times put it .
the unveiling is the most remarkable and most important surprise of the long-awaited work by mark halperin and john heilemann on the campaign 2012 , “ double down ” .
times is an example of the demo of the upcoming release of the book and it reported that the first edition of the book was published on thursday evening .
according to jonathan martin , the national political correspondent of times , the book is thoroughly documenting the history of efforts by leading employees of the campaign and the white house , notably the former whitehouse chile .
the potential change was a strictly guarded and unrestricted secret within the campaign infrastructure in chiapas and the east coast of the oval office .
only half a dozen of the closest advisors to the president – including daley , the former obama campaign leader , jim messina , and former chief adviser to the white house , david axelrod , and david plod .
in double down , the term “ damier ” is said to have led daley in efforts to keep biden alive despite her “ close personal relationship . ”
in an interview with martin , daley confirmed that the government was indeed considering how to use biden by clinton .
“ i expressed a whole series of things that could be considered .
we must remember that the treaty of lisbon was a terrible blow to the president at the time , so we thought : ‘ for god ’ s sake , what are we doing ? ’
while daley described the investigations as “ due care ” , he said : “ we are not alone in the face of anderson cooper from cnn , that there was a considerable amount of effort during the re-election campaign to find out if there was a result .
“ in campaigns , not so much money is spent on surveys and focus groups when you don ’ t seriously think about something , ” martin explained on ac360 .
it is not clear , however , whether obama knew that his team would have an exchange in mind .
martin said to cnn that he asked daley if his then colleague , the boss , was concerned about the potential change .
although daley said that he does not believe that the president of the possible change is “ aware ” , the former prime minister of the republic admitted that it was “ possible ” for obama to have known about it .
martin added that “ doubleclick ” is not a definitive answer to the question of whether the political provisos of obama ’ s desk had reached .
cooper asked martin if he seriously thought obama had nothing to learn from the research that he had done to save biden in the elections .
“ possible ” , martin replied .
what happens on the way with my email ?
e-mail is actually called electronic letter .
was the design of the internet service e-mail similar to the traditional post technically the secret of letters ?
the design of early internet services focused on the need to make communication possible .
that is why the basic technical protocols have not been designed to provide a stable foundation for a hearing-safe exchange of letters .
therefore , a conventional e-mail corresponds more to an open postcard than a sealed letter .
if user &quot; anna &quot; an &quot; to &quot; benni &quot; sends an email , the machines of the two are then directly connected ?
the email program or the browser of anna sends a message to the user in the first step .
for example , if you have a gmail account , google would be .
this mail server sends the content to the provider you have requested , and the service provider benni uses .
on the route , the mail can be sent via several other servers on the internet .
bennie can then search the content of the website for the content of the website .
are traditional e-mails being sent through the network ?
most mails are sent by software robots on the way .
the provider of the sender will usually check that the address is a chest of malicious files attached to the mail .
the receiver system also uses a virus scanner to check the data .
furthermore , the providers check whether they are a troublesome and unwanted spam mail , which is deleted immediately or at least sent to a spam folder .
have the robots yet another task ?
for systems like gmail , the robot also determines the information that google uses to place context advertising .
if anna and benni are notified via gmail about their upcoming holiday , google may provide links to holiday offers .
read also unknown people who send e-mails ?
the probability that unauthorized persons will receive a message is extremely low .
in theory , however , this is possible .
in companies , administrators often have the option of reading electronic mail .
law enforcement agencies and secret services have also provided legal opportunities to send e-mails or to take note of them .
in addition , there are possible illegal scourge actions .
is it possible to send e-mails against reading ?
encryption by openpgp standard allows a mail to be effectively protected against read .
with a high technical effort it is also possible to retrieve the metadata of an e-mail communication , so that not even can be easily identified who is communicating with whom .
how important are yahoo and google on the email market in germany ?
in the mostly privately used mailboxes , yahoo and google , according to a study conducted by convios consulting in august 2013 , only a subordinate role .
while the shares of yahoo mail were down most recently , gmail could be significantly increased by google .
mother disappeared in the forest and pension is cashed out .
when his beta-mother died , he forged a man from wolfsburg to make a plan .
he buried the dead in a forest - and cashed out their pensions .
to continue to pay pensions and care money , the european union has set up a 67-year-old wolfsburg to pay his mother &apos;s death after an investigation by the police in the forest .
first , he condemned the death of the 89-year-old , then he spent more than a year and a half .
now the 67 year-old has to be held responsible for fraud , as a spokesman said on friday .
so the council &apos;s position hid the woman in a forest near helmstedt .
suspected of being a man , he was arrested in may : at that time , the carers were denied access to medicines .
investigators told us that the pensioner had been forced to go to spain .
because officials are curious about this , they found that they could continue .
it was discovered that the two had been working in a joint apartment for more than 15 years and he kept them for the last time .
the 67-year-old has finally recorded the death of his mother .
a obduction was not reported by the police as a reason for capital crime .
want to eat ice cream , which is shining in the dark ?
a british entrepreneur has the first in the dark shining ice .
charlie francis made the flight to the city of florence by the fluorescent properties of sea animals and created a lighthouse .
the idea came to him after he completed a research on jellyfish and persuaded chinese scientists to use the luminous protein artificially .
the ice cream reacts with the tongue when consumed , which reduces the ph value in the protein and the luminaire is triggered .
chris explains that the ice cream reacts to the heat in the mouth and shines – depending on the amount of lick , the brighter it becomes .
charlie , founder of the eiscreme company , “ lick me i &apos;m delicious ” , says : “ the product is incredibly unbelievable , but still in a very early production phase , and so you get two grams of it .
the ice cream used in the ice cream responds with the tongue in a neutral ph value ph .
if the mouth is the protein warms , the ph-value increases and the ice shines .
we have seen it in recent months and it seemed that we were ideally able to test it on halloween .
it is probably the most expensive ice cream i ever made , because the quell is the most expensive one .
each ball costs me about 140 pounds .
but for this it tastes delicious .
charlies experimental company based in bristol is famous for its innovative products and services .
but his latest creation is to be even more ambitious .
he says , ‘ i would like to see an invisible ice cream ’ .
that is in itself impossible because of the light refraction caused by the ice crystals .
the ice cream uses the fluorescent properties of a jellyfish which is artificially produced by chinese scientists .
the tsv morsum has been released after six days of play , and is still in the hand ball league .
it is precisely now that the team of ingo ehlers is coming to the derby against the tsv daverden , which was on his first victory last weekend .
with this game the season begins new for us .
&quot; i hope that we finally have a head free &quot; , says ehlers behavior optimistic .
he has finally started to play the game , with the exception of the permanent injured hendrik blohme .
daverden , like us , is relying on speed games .
we must therefore reduce our error rate .
first and foremost , however , we must cover up , which is last anything but a safe impression .
the more relaxed way to get away from daverdens coach thomas panitz after the first season victory against nordhorn .
the game was of course a house number .
but that is why we are far from the favourites , because everything can happen at derby .
however , panitz wants to lay down in morsum to prepare a series .
the lack of jan-malt jadat .
the a-jugendliche joost windßuß , who is awarded the a-youth league twice as a member of the german youth league , hc bremen , is celebrating its season debut .
if you are not hot in such a game , you should stay at home .
halloween 2013 : in figures for the 2009 financial year , in figures for the 2009 financial year , in figures for the 2009 financial year , in figures for the following year , in figures : in figures : in figures : € 2.4 billion .
when i was small , halloween had some magical things to do .
my sister and i were allowed to eat sweets late and stay late and we were proclaimed for the neighborhood .
today i am more like the halloween muffle .
over the last two years , i have not agreed to move from my apartment from sweets .
but , according to statistics , i am a black sheep , which is a halloween issue .
the majority of americans – 158 million to be precise – celebrate this year halloween and give their total 6,9 billion us dollars for south korea ’ s sweets , costumes , and decorations , according to the us secretary .
one thing i would like to focus on every halloween is the fact that the trend values are .
the costumes are sold at about 1.2 billion of the 6.9 billion us dollars spent , according to the nrf .
this year , exciting new features are available .
women no longer need to be dressed in sexy clothes , they can now also eat seductive food such as pizza , hamburgers or carrots .
as for men , i expect a lot of zombies thanks to the walking dead , and i bet that the daft punk space männer will be this year in the instate test .
according to google , the most sought costumes are zombies , batman , pirates and hexen .
i suspect that there is nothing wrong with tradition .
we discussed our dogs last year .
indeed , americans spend $ 330 million this year on costumes for their pets , the nrf argues .
these are a lot of hot dogs .
as for sweets , we are not candy .
americans will be paying $ 1.9 billion this year , the nielsen company says .
this is about 270 million kilograms of chocolate , lutters , bonbons and rubber balls .
so good news for the us department of commerce , which has 41 million people who are entitled to sweets or saures through the neighborhoods .
indeed , we will have over 40 million kilograms of chocolate for halloween and – let us not deceive ourselves – we will eat .
the only thing we do not want to consume is the sweet candy corn , yet 15 million kilograms of it are sold around halloween , the national association of confectionery manufacturers .
that is about nine billion maize grains .
it is a mystery that i have not yet been able to resolve .
nothing is more part of halloween than houses where there are spiced .
they have great names such as ‘ terror behind the walls ’ ( which incidentally is in a real prison ) , ‘ howl ’ screen ’ and ‘ howl-o-scream ’ .
there are , in fact , 1,200 officially recognised spukkhouses in the united states , which have achieved $ 500 million in revenue , according to america haunts , and that includes the wonderful photos on which we have just been caught in pink .
but let us finally move on to the shortened ones .
charlie brown made us happy with the big kranbis when we were children , and cutting a shorbishop &apos;s lantern is like decorating christmas tree .
fortunately , the “ baby began to grow in the pumpkin trend only last year thanks to pintest , so most of us grew up to take the pumpkin back and not to be there .
this year , americans will spend about $ 106 million on shorter spending , the us census bureau .
the pumpkin lantern , which slowly rotates in the front garden , is probably from illinois , where this year 245 million kilograms of pumpkin were harvested .
if you want to make a good point , call tim and susan mathisdon in napa , california and carve something pretty .
residential fire in helmbrecht : rescue forces mountains hide verkohlte corpse .
the fire brigade had to be killed in helmbrecht on thursday evening .
a three-family house in the district of hof begins at night to the friday fire .
the rescue forces are a source of coal light , and the people of the village are still living there .
rescue forces have a vital role to play in a fire in helmbrecht .
whether it is a resident or a resident , it is still unclear how a spokesman for the police in bayreuth said .
on late thursday evening , it had a nice view of the old town of the hotel .
when the fire brigade arrived , the flags were already smashing from a window .
the forces of intervention went into the apartment and found the corpse in a room .
this and another room completely burned out .
the entire ground floor has been damaged .
all other inhabitants were killed during the fire .
the building was no longer inhabitable for the time being .
the exact cause of the fire was initially unclear .
germany &apos;s largest national church has an offensive started , to fight for the profession of pastor .
the background is a possible parish shortage : the gospel lutheran church of st. hannover is counting on the fact that the number of its currently 1,800 pastoralists is increasing .
for young people today , the profession is very attractive and offers good prospects for the future , said pastor mathis burfien ( 43 ) in conversation with the evangelical press service .
it is attractive to increase the working and day-to-day flow itself .
burfia is the country church for the first time .
at present , fewer and fewer young people are opting for a university degree .
burfia is pushing this towards the process of deconstruction : &quot; god &apos;s voice is quiet , the world is loud &quot; .
the profession is of great freedom and diversity .
i am mr of my schedule and can &apos;t find my priorities there , where i think it is important .
pastors could be a soulman very close to the people .
they earned so much as teachers and could well live from it .
i am sure that in the free economy more is paid , but theologians would have a safe employer .
this will help today &apos;s young people who are not only concerned with career , but also with a mind-filled job .
according to the national church , which is located in the region of three quarters of lower saxony , about 60 pastors are retired every year .
at the same time , about 40 graduates from a theological college start their vikariat .
in sparsely populated peripheral areas , such as the resin , the emsland or the wendland , it may be difficult to fill jobs in the future .
burfia wants to organise , among other things , student days for young people and also to invite prominent people to study theology .
the theology course offers a broad education .
it is even possible to become president of the federal republic .
land rover rally series announced
the interior features raceseats and six-point tables .
the options range from increased brakes , a service package with care for bowler drivers , and a service package with a full range of services .
drew bowler , managing director of bowler motorsport , explains : “ the rally customers , who are becoming bowler , are now in a different situation . ”
they are not all experienced racing drivers , but people who are looking for exciting and exciting races .
we are pleased to support this approach in partnership with land rover and the msa and believe that the project format will open up new possibilities that will allow the various rally disciplines in the uk and abroad to experience and become newcomers .
we really enjoyed playing the defender challenge in the car .
there are also a number of additional options for the defender challenge : training and testing in february , as well as the option to participate in desert races in north africa and the middle east .
fire brigade to save a bitch called , the 15 meters above the ground on a dangerous ground .
cockerspaniel-bitch ruby was born in the netherlands after a minor traffic accident .
three days later , she was accompanied by a walker in the quarry in her unfavourable location .
firefighters rolled on rocky walls and saved the land from the fire .
the fire brigade succeeded in building a female in safety .
the nine months old cockerspaniel bitch ruby was born after a road accident on sunday afternoon .
scott alderson , 25 , and his girlfriend becky hall , 20 , to whom the dog belongs , came to the quarry flappit in denholme , west yorkshire to make ruby again .
they had desperately asked for their missing bitch .
about 14 : 15 pm on wednesday i saw a walk in the park , which was a bit of a bit of stranded ruby on the 15-metre high section .
the technical rescue team of cleckheaton fire gmbh will be happy to assist you in finding the right solution for your problem .
andy clayton , specialist in the technical rescue team , has said : “ you have been in a dangerous position .
it was in the middle of the cliff wall – 15 meters from the top and the bottom .
she did not move muscle during her rescue – she was like stiff-frozen .
but now she is doing well .
it then took a few dog cakes and she was very happy .
that was a rather unusual effort .
the fact that the dog was discovered is incredible .
peter lau , specialist in the technical rescue team , has said : “ ruby had a giant ship , but it is still a long way from being able to get it . ”
there was a possibility that they were very seriously injured or worse .
ruby was elected veterinarian who was not allowed to take part in the research , but was not able to determine anything apart from exhaustion and dehydration .
becky hall from halifax , west yorkshire , said : “ at redemption , beware of the fear . ”
i could not believe that they were really up there .
it was wonderful to see you back in the arms .
the veterinarian said that , if exhaustion became too great and they had collapsed , it would probably have fallen .
the fire fighters have done a great job .
it was really courageous what you did .
we are simply so grateful and each of them was absolutely incredible .
scott alderson from keithley added : “ we had fear that the next time they would fall , but they remained on top . ”
the fire fighters were great .
i can hardly believe where it was .
mick jagger says he has katy perry never admitted when she was 18 .
in an interview with an australian radio station this week , the pop star said that she had been working as background singer at hunters song .
perry explained that she had been working with the altrocker and that “ he had asked me to go to the hospital when i was 18 . ”
she added : “ this is a long time ago and he was very kind to me . ”
in a statement , a representative jagger , 70 , said on thursday that he was ‘ categorically denied that he had ever tried to seek rapprochement with katy perry ’ .
the representative added : “ perhaps she has met him with someone else . ”
perry was one of the singers who played at the rolling stones-tour this year .
her new album “ prism ” landed on the top of the list at first place this week .
george kerevan : european unbundling gives the scots the choice .
a new day , a new horror story about independence .
this time we are warned that an independent scottish country is needed to protect the schengen area .
this provides the key word for stories about passport controls in berwick and a story written with barbed wire .
indeed , the road map shows that the council has not taken any account of the possible economic benefits of making travel more free with the rest of europe , but this has been , as expected , a key factor in the headlines .
nor did anyone mention that eu member states often have to abide by their strict rules , if there is any more favourable way for them .
as scotland is not currently a member of the schengen area , the continued non-compliance with brussels would be a small concession .
so really no story .
and one that has already been in the years that you already have a fossil like : the first time i have seen the “ independence means passport controls ” -duck at least 40 years ago .
an interesting point is the constant repetition of this ancient story .
why should we expect an independent scotland to be a member of the european pipe ?
why the london yoke against the brussels embargo ?
these are the real european news : the great , after the war , plan to unite europe has stalled .
the euro crisis has brought the european project to an official standstill .
across the eu , parties that are not anti-eu gain .
even in germany , eurosceptic party could not support alternative for germany – only this year – just five million votes at the federal elections in september .
there have always been domestic opposition to the plan to create a federal europe .
the current economic crisis , however , is turning into a turning point .
due to the financial and economic sanctions imposed by berlin and the european central bank , in conjunction with the straitjacket , into which the national economy is bound by maintaining the single currency , the euro has left many people in the view .
the crisis in the euro has little to do with the fact that national governments are causing excessive budget deficits – that was only the case in greece .
instead , the eurosystem has limited its members to exchange rates that are too high for german exporters .
without the possibility of devaluing the local currency , southern europe will find itself in a built-in productivity disadvantage compared to germany .
the only way to achieve this is to increase wages and public spending – encouraged by berlin .
behind the current budget and monetary problems , the problem is deeper .
as a result of the ‘ green ’ energy policies prescribed by brussels – a code for subsidising energy from france and germany – the eu is not going to pay for the energy industry .
this is a crippling cost , as we have already seen in granemouth .
all wage fixing in the world protects the european petrochemical industry from being hit by cheap american shale gas in the corner .
as a result , a revolt is rising , especially in france , the former cheerleader of the eu .
after the war , the french political elite saw the eu as a vehicle for the eu to take over germany in shakeup and to take paris on an equal footing with washington .
but berlin does not need more than a gateway to political legitimation , and has put europe on its own economic policy , which is the struggle of the french economy that is being wounded .
the result : marine le pen &apos;s right-wing , eu-hostile front national has just won a decisive election .
the national front is now the most popular party in france with 24 % of the electorate – a timely warning for the british labour government .
what makes le pen with its newly won popularity among the white french of the workers class ?
it wants to hold next year &apos;s eu elections to an anti-eu , anti-community currency bloc in the european parliament .
if anti-eu parties were to be well represented in these elections – and that is very possible – then the first such bloc could be the european parliament .
this is the point i want to make : in the not too distant future , the growing resentment against the eu and the single currency will be the result of the abolition of the euro .
the eu will not disappear , but it will be more like the “ europe of ( sovereign ) nations . ”
germany and some of its satellite economies may hold fast to the euro , but france and southern europe will be among their own currencies .
i expect the uk to move away from this project in the hope of being able to join the us .
washington ’ s growing interest in the pacific is , however , suggesting that britain alone in the atlantic rain is likely to be on the way .
where is scotland in all this ?
we can decide to create a region of ( last-minute ) small england .
or we can protect our own economic interests – including , indeed , berlin and brussels – which they themselves have to hide .
i suspect that scotland could be a looser european union .
cooperation with other similarly minded countries is very important in a non-federal europe of nations .
otherwise , we should consider allowing norway to do the same and to retain our economic independence .
the snp government in scotland is – remarkably enough – a good example of the most successful political movement against the austerity policies in europe , and in 2011 it won a spectacular majority because of the rejection of the proposed ( and implemented ) cuts .
it would be ridiculous for scotland to opt for independence now , only to be able to benefit from berlin and brussels from austerity policies .
early puberty : grow faster than the average age of the puberty : grow faster , the number of children is growing faster .
afro-american and hispanic girls tend to reach puberty rather than their white counterparts , as investigations show .
physical changes do not mean the puberty of the body .
there is no evidence that hormones or other chemicals are safe .
experts believe that the epidemic obesity is an trigger of early puberty .
the trend towards early puberty is less pronounced in young people than in young adults .
the former cnn correspondent paat ettheridge is a journalist who was a member of the cnn group for children &apos;s health and family issues .
if a mother is worried , if her daughter is already seven or eight years old , breasts and shamhairs grow ?
at the annual conference of the paediatrician association of paediatricians , the american academy of pediatrics this week in orlando , florida , the paediatric endocrinologist said that dr. paul kaplogue is relatively early .
“ i spend a lot of time teaching parents to calm down – normally this is not a sign that they are now quickly getting the puberty going , ” explains kaplowitz .
obvious ads of development , such as growing breasts , chamboo and arrow hair , and bodily odor , are seen in girls earlier .
however , there was only a slight shift in the age of the menarche ( appearance of the first regular bleeding ) in the last 40 years .
in the united states , the average age is 12,5 years , slightly less than 12.75 years in 1970 .
“ if the development of breasts begins , it takes at least two to three years to reach the menarche , ” said kaplowitz , also author of the book “ early puberty in girls : the essential advisor .
time is the most accurate test , as the puberty progresses .
it is controversial as to what actually marks the beginning of puberty , but it is important to be “ early ” when the breast enlargement of a growth chest is expected to take place eight years ago .
in most cases , the rate of growth is slowing or stagnating – something that a pediatrician can monitor closely .
if the progress is made more quickly , tests could be carried out by an endikronologist , so that serious problems such as tumors or cysts can be excluded .
there are treatments for delaying early menstrual and chronic depression .
the recommendations for a medicinal or hormonal therapy are based on the age of the child , the development speed , the growth rate and the emotional balance of the patient .
psychosocial aspects are also important .
kaplowitz is restrained about medicines , but he does acknowledge that “ the signing of the buffer is not acceptable . ”
the other major problem is understandable : parents simply do not want their very young daughters to have the period .
“ they are worried about the risk of pregnancy or about how they can reduce hygiene .
“ it was a shock , ” a woman remembers , whose daughter , with ten her days , had .
although the first signs have been there and we are talking about menstrual , it was not emotionally prepared .
she was frightened and excited by the school home , because she had the first in her girlfriend circle .
there are many widely published theories about the causes of early infections .
but there is no conclusive evidence that the us has a strong presence in milk or other food .
boys come in a similar way to girls in the past .
kaplowitz believes that the most convincing premise is the epidemic of fat mortality .
he supported the conduct of a study in 2001 on girls aged six to nine .
other studies support this conclusion , but there is a lot of other factors that have a role to play .
in this country , african-american and hispanic girls tend to reach puberty rather than their white colleagues .
there are different explanations for this .
globally , an early puberty seems to have been influenced by all kinds of things , from economic conditions , to climate , to genes .
another mystery : although boys are the face and shampoo hair earlier , the hair is still growing .
other doctors on the aap conference stressed the complexity of the problem and the need for a more comprehensive approach .
the appearance of acne and shamhaar is even common in babies and infants .
“ we must be careful how we understand the real beginning of puberty ” , said dr. lambert .
parents should not hesitate to let their pediatrician advise you how to treat your child .
“ this can mean that you can get in touch with someone earlier than expected , ” reit kaplowitz .
if you remain calm , the child usually reacts well .
girls who were blooming early need insurance , which the process has a normal part of life , even if they were previously thought to .
jumbo manufacturer argue in the face of large orders over seat width .
there is a clear link between leading aircraft manufacturers about the broad range of seats in the tourist class at long-haul flights .
the dispute is about the seats and the length of the seats , passengers on long flights in the tourist class are offered – not always those who are to worry about airlines .
airbus has requested a fire service standard in the industry this week that would allow a seat width of at least 46 cm ( 18 inches ) in the tourist class , but the us archbishop has not yet signed up to this .
the argument comes at a time when the aircraft industry is concerned about the need to reduce the number of aircraft in its twin-engine long-range fleet .
like the back part of the aircraft , the aircraft is designed , especially if it is rows with nine or ten seats , it is crucial for the economic results indicated that the new mini-jumbo will deliver .
boeing claims that his modernised “ 777x ” fits 406 people at seats in the tourist class , which has more than 17 inches wide and thus makes ten per row .
airbus declares that the competing version of the a350 will carry 350 passengers in 18 inches .
airplane giants often share the same opinion about technical details via advertising in the specialist press .
now airbus is appealing to the dubai airshow , where the 777x will be delivered with more than 100 orders , directly to the public .
recently , the company issued a notification indicating the start of a new ad war and providing funds to a picture .
“ boeing proposes long haul flights in seats that are closer than regional turbo-props ” , says airbus ceo lufthansa .
in view of the changing dietary habits , people will be thicker , but aircraft seats have not changed radically .
between the early 1970 ’ s , when boeing 747 launched the modern long-distance journey , and the end of the century , the weight of the male average passenger has increased by between 40 and 49 years .
the waist range of the male average american is about 21,000 cm ( 2,000 feet ) , according to us health statistics .
airbus says its rival is not complying with a seating concept from the 1950s when the average body size of the freshly baptized jet set shrinks .
i was told that the commission had carried out investigations into the fact that an additional customs duty ( eur 2.54 cm ) per seat would reduce the quality of the sleeping by 53 % .
boeing denies the numbers of airbus at the seating and says that it is not in the discretion of the manufacturer to decide how airlines will carry out the balance between flights and the establishment .
the company also states that according to studies , the experience on the aircraft depends on more than the seat width .
“ it really is about giving airlines flexibility , but it is not about giving them the flexibility they think they need to do in order to succeed ” , explains the airline ’ s cabin expert kent craver .
you do not want us to dictate what you are profitable .
you know your business better than anyone else .
passengers are concerned with more elbow freedom , but for manufacturers , it will increasingly be a problem .
behind the argument is a race for aircraft orders with an estimated volume of at least 700 billion us dollars to list prices in the coming decades , which is likely to have a lasting impact on the us or europe &apos;s export performance .
as reuters first reported in july , the seat is not available in the main engine .
both airbus and boeing claim 20 percent more efficiency per seat at their latest branches in the twin-engine long-range design and the market leader in this segment .
the statements boeing made on the results depend in part on the 777x being equipped with ten seats per row with the original design of nine seats in the 777 .
the increased costs per unit are still lower than in the current machines with ten seats per row .
“ boeing quetches more seats in his plane , so he can become more competitive with our products . ”
on the other hand , analysts say that full cabins with ten seats per row , with existing 777s , indicated that many passengers were in favour of the narrower arrangement , which would involve cheaper fares .
&quot; eighteen customs are seated in a great way for passengers who are travelling , but the reality is that , from an economic point of view , the airbus offer is threatened by the 777 threat .
airbus and boeing do not offer seats that are not available , but a catalogue of suppliers from which the airlines can choose .
the world traveler jet sellers even wear bandwidth , to make the equipment work in competition .
even if you are looking for comfort , all manufacturers offer jets with high performance compressors .
airbus offers an a350 with ten-seat series , but , according to its own statement , has not yet sold it .
until recently , airbus underlined the importance of greater adaptability for cabins and for some jets of wide seats on the corridors .
without the support of the only other manufacturer of large modern jets , experts say that the call for a new industry standard is likely to be volatile , but from the wave of 777x sales could distract .
new anti-nicotine vaccine could be a great help to smoke .
scientists have developed an anti-nicotine vaccine that will have fun smoking .
a single dose of the vaccine could prevent mice from being used for a lifetime .
before testing on humans , further experiments are needed , which can take a few years , but professor ronald crystal is convinced of the weill cornell medical college in new york .
“ we are very hopeful that this type of vaccination strategy will once again kill millions of smokers who have tried to stop smoking while all the products available on the market are tested .
the new vaccine contains a harmless virus that is modified to prevent the disease from being transmitted to the human body .
the virus is selectively infecting liver cells , which then generate a constant flow of antibodies .
the antibodies hunt the nicotine molecules in the blood and neurodermatitis before they reach the brain .
in experiments , vaccinated mice , which were not permitted to nicotine , kept their normal level of activity .
mice without vaccination , on the other hand , would have been a “ time off , ” stated researchers , a sign that nicotine could have reached her brain .
the experiments are published in the science translation media journal .
earlier tobacco vaccines proposed misuse of the vaccines against antibodies .
vaccination had to be used to maintain the antibody level .
but the cost of the new vaccine is probably much lower , because it transforms liver cells into antibodies .
as professor crystal said , the european union could be a vaccine for people who have been exposed to it , if it is safe , before they are put in the temptation to use a cigarette .
but it is more likely that smokers will use it to stop .
&quot; you then know : if you start smoking again , you will feel a little bit more like smoking because of the nicotine vaccine .
british scientists said that the results were interesting , but they also warned that there is a need for further research .
tripodi denies that he is influenced by obeid .
the former labour minister , mr joe trichet , from new south wales , is being charged with a state corruption investigation .
the former nsw minister denies that the rules on maritime pollution packaging are being amended at the request of his political mentor , eddie obeid , who has been concealed in three bases .
the independent european commission is a member of the european parliament .
now , due to the accusation , tripodi has been taken over by obidid interest in the properties .
in years of discussions , which began in 2005 , the government had to rely on public calls for tender for lease contracts .
the poets were opposed to this and also wanted longer maturities .
in 2009 , leasing contracts were awarded to companies at the circular quay , which is awarded to the obeids every year , without any public tender .
tripodi , which was launched from february 2006 to november 2009 , had originally opted for public calls for tender .
but he denied that the changes were at obeid ’ s request , which , as tripodi confirmed , was not based on a redesign of the leasing arrangements of the government .
one of the icac &apos;s telephone records showed talks from august and september 2007 between obeid , tripodi and steve dunn , a senior civil servant who was sent to the port ministry .
“ was that what was discussed in these telephone conversations was the development of the commercial packaging regulations ? ” he asked .
“ no , ” tripodi replied .
i cannot remember what was said .
definitely not between me and mr obeid .
israeli fighter planes attack target in syria , and the israeli army is not yet officially deployed .
israeli hunting planes could have been a destination in the syrian port of latakia on thursday night , confirmed by a senior government official to fox news .
the official explained not how the system was intended , but he said that it was at least one .
according to associated press , this was a target of russian sa-125-rm missiles .
at least twice this year , israel has already committed air strikes against missile supplies in syria .
foreign workers with 457 visas could be “ real test ” if they were to be able to take the real test .
the government is thinking about the possibility of a “ real money test ” for foreign workers with 457-visa as part of an extended policy .
if the test were to be introduced , it would have a criterion that would prevent the european parliament from adopting the 457 as an unqualified workforce or as a backdoor to immigration from family and friends to australia .
today , a proposal for discussion was made by the government after the former labour government member , matthias macdonald , signed the comments of the government on the foreign workers .
“ loud statements such as that foreigners should sit back and , in australians , first stop , ” are a very unpleasant backlash in times when trade unions are a protected labour market . ” he said .
historically , the word was that white labor is protected , and that the country ’ s leaders , if any , would respond to this historic artifact .
the discussion proposal outlines twelve measures which were once implemented by the former immigration minister , chris bowen .
immigration minister brendan o &apos;connor , who was invited yesterday to talk about human trafficking in sri lanka , has said that there are five of the proposed changes , which are being discussed .
if the “ authenticity criterion ” is accepted , then someone who has a visa could be granted a visa to verify that the visa is valid .
firms could also be obliged to provide accounts for the number of 457 visa holders who have been granted visas in the past , after companies that initially had only a small number of workers were finally able to employ hundreds .
meanwhile , a 35-year-old sri lankan asylum seeker probably died from a heart attack .
the disturbed nine-year-old son of the man who travelled with him to australia has been arrested since his father died on wednesday of a adult .
australian authorities have brought the man to the christmas island hospital .
the british government has announced a study to assess the benefits of hs2 for scotland .
in the work of hs2 ltd it is proposed to start from phase 1 in 2026 high-speed internet connections between scotland and ireland .
transport minister baroness kramer said that the ‘ will britain bring us closer together ’ project .
the scottish transport minister keith brown said that he was very pleased to work with the british government on this plan .
phase 1 consists of a new high-speed rail link between london and the west midlands .
after phase 2 has been completed , there will be connections to manchester and leeds .
in june , the government corrected the estimated cost of building the high-speed rail link between london and nordengland from eur 32.7 billion to £ 42.6 billion .
the british government , which is engaged in talks with transport scotland , has proposed hs2 ltd to seek further stress tests on track capacity and travel time improvements for nordengland scotland .
this includes the possibility of a journey time of three hours or less from glasgow and edinburgh to london .
baroness kramer said : “ our goal for hs2 is a truly national network that britain and its cities are closer together . ”
we are going ahead with hs2 because it offers enormous advantages .
without it , we are facing a capacity crisis in our rail network .
but it is also a question of linking 18 british cities , including glasgow and edinburgh , which have been improved thanks to hs2 .
the scottish secretary of state , alistair carmichael , commented : “ today ’ s announcement is good news for scotland . ”
on behalf of the scottish government , keith brown called for carmichael to be “ unequivocal ” in favour of scottish integration into the hs2 network .
brown said : “ the high-speed rail link is a risk of enormous potential economic benefits for scotland .
we are therefore pleased to be able to work as a partner to the british government and to discuss the options for a high-speed rail link in scotland , which will bring benefits for all and will facilitate the connection between glasgow-edinburgh and the scottish government .
i look forward to receiving the report of inquiry with the british ministers next year .
regulations on electronic equipment in aircraft remain in force in australia for the time being .
australian air passengers must continue to carry tablets and smartphones at the start and landing , despite efforts in the us , which have made it easier to relax the rules on such equipment .
the us federal aviation administration has issued a new proposal for a us airline to carry out its duties in order to allow passengers to fly on their equipment during critical flight phases .
for most of the flight , passeig de gràcia is already allowed , but many people find it annoying that they are unable to leave their e-books when they start and landing .
australian companies are watching the decision to implement the us airlines unwary of work .
the air traffic control agency casa also stated that it would take a look at the announcement , but stressed that the restrictions on the use of electronic equipment in critical air flight phases in australia are still valid .
“ the casa has no specific regulations on the use of electronic devices in aircraft at the moment , ” said the company .
the subject is subject to provisions whereby airlines are entitled to maintain safety at any time and passengers are required to carry out the security instructions given by cabin crew .
virgin has already started the casa talks about an extension of its wi-fi network .
“ we would like to see a review of the authorisation of electronic equipment by casa , because we are convinced that this will improve the customer experience after we have ( wireless ) a lot of experience during the flight .
qantas explained that , for the time being , we will remain with the current rules .
“ our current guidelines provide that electronic equipment will be used at the start and landing stage , and we currently have no plans to do so . ” said the company .
the faa rules apply to us airlines .
however , we are always interested in developments in regulations that benefit passengers , and we will be looking at the faa decision and the reasons behind it .
the decision has a negative impact on us companies , depending on the age of the fleet .
they must prove that their aircraft are capable of preventing radio disturbances from being detected by mobile devices , and manuals , training materials , hand baggage programs and customer instruction are being changed .
“ after an airline has confirmed the tolerance of its fleet , it can offer passengers the use of portable , lighter electronic devices such as tablets , e-book reading devices and smart phones .
in rare cases of bad vision , the crew will not be able to instruct the passengers while landing .
the group also recommended that heavier devices be used at start-up and landing safely under the seat or in the subjects above the seat .
before the reviderby against schalke , some bvb trailers with light missiles for ugly scenes had been in the veltins arena .
borussia dortmund announced that he would continue to take tough action .
before the friday match of the football league in the face of the vfb stuttgart reader , the german u3 reacted with a silence - first .
it was an unfamiliar , almost speculative acoustics that was dedicated to the viewer until just before the beginning of the bundesliga game between the german vice-president borussia borussia dortmund and the vda .
the majority of the guests were listening to their songs .
the south grandstand , on the other hand , where the faithful - and loudest - bvb fans stand , was initially presented with exceptionally quiet : no songs , no battles .
the podium of capo , who would otherwise have the joint moisture , remained unused .
and at the front of the grandstand , eloquently waved a great flag with a sign &quot; section stadium ban &quot; .
only as goalkeeper roman weidenfeller as ever first bvb player entered the place , kurt burned short cheers .
when his team colleagues followed , there were strong voices and voices calling out .
in the central blocks 12 and 13 of the south grandstand , the crowd was not provoking .
also , the stadium spokesman norbert dickel has once again confirmed the positive experiences of the last few days - derby victory , victory over arsenal , contract renewal by coach jürgen klopp - listed a holiday did not .
only five minutes before the start of the game the capo knocked his podium - and the up to that point with his hands .
finally , as always , the southern grandstand was on the line - and finally there was a lot of noise again .
and at the latest when with the pfandbrief from the south grandstand the loud call &quot; derbysieger stands on &quot; came , again everything was as usual .
the silence before was probably a response to what happened in the last few days .
the hotel is situated in the heart of the city , close to the train station and the train station .
the game was not properly tested due to the chaotic scenes .
bvb-boss hans-joachim watzke had the leaders of the dortmund ultras to join his office .
&quot; it will be for the entire ultra movement massive cuts &quot; , explains the author of the book , the author of the book , on thursday evening .
as an immediate measure , watzke forbidden the ultras to perform a choreography for the home game against the vfb stuttgart .
&quot; i forbidden this , &quot; he said .
the zero tolerance policy is a policy of pyrotechnics that we cannot abandon .
in addition , the ultras have been shown various ways of punishing - until tuesday , they now have time to choose a punishment .
otherwise , we would say , i will be the bvb until the end of next week to lay down a sanction .
&quot; this will be a major step &quot; , he insured watzke .
we are eager to see how the reactions on the south gallery will be .
pfandhäuser boom in singapore , as the crisis in the middle class has arrived .
in a pfandhaus in the bendmeer shopping centre in singapore janani amirthalinga exchanges a golden armchair , a ring and a few earrings .
&quot; my husband and i have just bought a house , there is all my money in it , &quot; says amirthalinga .
although they receive 3,000 singapore dollars each month ( about 1,730 euros ) as an administrative employee , and their husband also works , they do not pay the monthly family income , explains the difference .
indeed , demand in parts of south-east asia – where debt is the highest in households – has grown so large that valuemax , where it has to exchange , is able to raise the third pfandhaus this week .
the pledging of jewelry is not only a quick way to get money – 1,300 singapur-dollars in the case of janani amirtat .
typically , pfandhäuser in singapore require an effective annual rate of 17 % , which is just under 15.4 % , which the united east midlands has achieved .
pfandhäuser however , have the advantage that no verification of creditworthiness or income certificates is required , which is why loans are faster than possible for banks .
that is why millions of people in the region are turning to pfandhäuser , after families have been put under pressure from rising cost of living and increasing household and consumer debt .
after five years of robust growth since the global financial crisis and cheap loans from a loose fiscal policy in the advanced economies , families with low income and low income look for pfandhouses to help in stotternach economics .
this week , the credit rating agency standard &amp; poor &apos;s called the growing budget debt of the european union , mainly due to rising mortgages .
malaysia , thailand , and singapore have , according to the agency ’ s assessment , the highest household debt in asia relative to gdp .
malaysia is the world &apos;s largest economy , accounting for 80 % of gdp , while the country is growing at 60 % in 2008 .
economists are also concerned about the high consumer debt in thailand , which is causing a blow this week from a technical recession .
on thursday , the data showed a continuing export weakness and a decline in consumer demand .
“ in the end , this means that , with rising costs , people in the middle to lower segment ( the income side ) are more likely to try to increase their incomes , wherever the possible . ”
historical peaks in gold prices in the past two years have undermined the trend of pledging personal items , as the people have the opportunity to buy the jewelry of the family in cash .
in singapore , about 70 % of the goods that are pledged are in the 200 deposit boxes of the city state gold .
people say to themselves : “ the price of gold looks good , let us be grandmother &apos;s gold chain .
the largest thai pfandhaus operator , easymoney , has invested in its branches a 20 % stake in the customer .
growth in the pfandbrief business is so strong that valuemax , the owner of the branch in bendemeer and 15 others in singapore , can not only be exported to neighbouring malaysia – where the company is .
the company finances the company with 60 percent of singapore ’ s 66 million dollar , which it won this week with the singapore stock exchange .
while some lenders are worried about a default because of high interest rates , yeah says that pfandhouses are not only cheaper interest rates than other vendors , but also less directly the debt .
“ customers lend objects they already own and this is the result of liquefied personal valuables not increasing household debt , ” said the president of the commission .
the pfandbrief business is increasingly seen as a short-term , secure financing in social terms .
not all people who care for pfandbrief banks are also in financial trouble .
rich people from singapore also come to the stores of valuemax to buy gold bars and rolex watches .
we are a company that brings together clients from all social classes .
“ this includes wealthy people who , in the short term , can do something for a business or investment , or small businesses that are exposed to cash flow bottlenecks , ” says yeah .
sometimes you just need to spend money very quickly .
nsa collects data from google and yahoo - snowden wants to help .
the intelligence revelator edward snowden has basically been a keen supporter of helping germany to clarify the increasingly volatile situation of the nsa .
according to the german green party member hans-christoph ströbele , the first time he met the snowboard was in russia , a surprise meeting , about the conditions under which the ex secret services were allowed to work in a german public prosecutor &apos;s office .
snowden has pointed out his complex legal situation , he said , &quot; the poor man of the world &quot; .
rescue package on 325 million australian dollars for tacis .
the australian government insists on the tough conditions imposed by the rescue package .
federal minister of health tanya plibersek announced that the commonwealth will be “ immediate action ” to prevent the spread of a crisis that has been exacerbated by an ageing population of the island state , a higher rate of illness .
the funding for a four-year period was increased after intergovernmental discussions with the independent tasmanian member andrew wilkie .
“ the government has issued an emergency rescue package , ” says the president of the european central bank .
the 325-million dollar dollar bang package comprises 31 million dollars of emergency aid for electoral services .
the other 2600 operations , including orthopaedic operations and treatments for gray star , are intended to remove residues .
there is also money for day clinics in hobart and launceston , better aftercare after hospital treatment , and more for patients .
“ these investments are in line with the ideas that affected me in clinical staff have told me that they are the best way to achieve the tasmanian health system , ” said tanya plibersek .
the minister insisted on a strict reporting and accountability policy , which was the responsibility of the tasmanian government .
the federal state must provide the current level of funding to finance money from the commonwealth .
a three-headed commission will be set up to ensure that the federal government provides health services as effectively and efficiently as possible .
like wilkie said today , the 325 million dollars would be of little use if “ they were not accompanied by real reforms that would undermine the public tasmanian health system in a more sustainable way . ”
nevertheless , he praised the government for insisting on its request for urgent aid .
“ i am confident that the federal aid will make a major contribution to the promotion of public health systems in the state from the sorgent list , ” said wilkie .
according to the government of the state , these electoral benefits will largely reflect the recent cuts .
but the public health spokesman on the federal government , peter dutton , is of the opinion that today &apos;s announcement is only a “ paving ” solution .
“ we are therefore in the position today because the laboratory state government has 430 million dollars from the health system .
it is not acceptable that a government of state should pay almost half a billion dollars out of the system and that the commonwealth should pay 300 million .
dutton called for plibersek to guarantee that not a single dollar of the rescue package would be used for additional bureaucracy .
guillaume nicloux &apos; adaptation of the novel by denis diderot convinces with its exceptional production equipment and contemporary design .
the french , the 1760s , play , tells the story of the story of suzanne , a young adolescent who was taken to the monastery by her family .

the solemn seriousness with which the film is told makes it a great success for the audience .
syria has its opportunity to make chemical weapons destroyed , so a surveillance mission has been set up to monitor the situation .
syria has important facilities for producing chemical weapons and gites .
on thursday , a syrian activist group also announced that more than 120,000 people have been fleeing the country since the civil war began three years ago .
the announcement by the organisation for the prohibition of chemical weapons ( opcw ) came a day before the deadline on 1 january .
1 november , which the united nations security council in the hague called damascus to remove all the facilities for the production of chemical weapons .
the conclusion of this process , which is basically the first stage of destruction , is an important milestone in an ambitious timetable for the future of the european union .
the destruction of facilities means that syria does not need new chemical weapons .
damascus , however , still needs to begin to use the weapons and supplies that exist .
it is believed that there are about 1,000 tonnes of chemicals and weapons in the country , including mustard gas and the nervous gas sarin .
the announcement came at a time when the thursday fight was in the city of safira , from the experts say that the time was ripe for the production of chemical weapons and storage facilities .
the activist group that has a network of activists in syria increasing the number of dead , declared on thursday , 120.296 people were dead .
of these , 61,067 civilians , including 6,365 children .
the government has had 29,954 of them in the army of president bashar assad , 18,678 of them are pro-government fighters and 187 lebanese hizbollah militias .
also among the dead are 2.202 deserted army soldiers &apos; soldiers and 5,375 fighters of the opposition , many of them foreigners .
on 25 july , the un estimated the number of deaths in this conflict since march 2011 to 100,000 .
this figure has not been updated .
the conflict has affected about two million people to flee the country .
assad ’ s troops have been fighting for the rebellion in safira for weeks , many of which have links to al-qaeda groups .
the observatory said that on thursday losses were incurred on both sides , but it did not mention details .
the fighting underlines the danger posed by the chemical weapons inspectors , because their mission to liberate syria is a very important one .
according to the opcw , which is closely linked to the united nations , the team is “ now convinced that it will all be able to implement all the major production and mixing / filling facilities named by syria and see their destruction . ”
that ’ s why no more inspection activities are planned . ”
earlier this week , the inspectors said they had completed the first round of inspections and 21 out of 23 of the inspections announced by damascus .
because of security concerns , visit two facilities was not possible , the inspectors said .
on thursday , opwc , the two sites were named after syrian “ abandoned . ”
it was not immediately clear whether the site in safira was one of the two institutions that the opcw inspectors did not visit .
syria has a plan for the complete destruction of its chemical weapons , which will be adopted next month by the executive committee of the opwc .
&quot; i prefer to wash my hands of bravery and courage , &quot; said the president of the european commission .
for three years now , the mainly sunni muslim rebels have been fighting in this civil war against assad ’ s government and its security forces , which have been a source of support for many alawites .
with a view to further developments , the head of the observatory , rami abdurrahman , said that there was a strong explosion on wednesday in an air defence facility in the syrian coastal province of latakia .
the cause of the explosion is not known , he explained .
anger at judgement for bombers in bali
survivors and relatives of the 202 people who died in the bomb attack in bali in 2002 are now reacting to the anger felt by the people of the last attack on the instigator .
patek , who is almost ten years old as one of the most sought after people in south-east asia , has been arrested yesterday for his role in building sprenglers .
the suspension could be lifted after 15 years .
the 45 year-old was accused of mass murder .
a claim was also made in a number of terrorist cases .
the public prosecutor had a life sentence imposed on him , even if he was a prisoner of conscience for the man who had been a master bomb builder for his reputation .
the decision has caused painful memories at june corteen .
with tears , he said that patek had the death of being a prisoner .
i really do think that he should be in the footsteps of the other guys .
“ it is important to protect him from a shooting command , ” said corteen to aap .
i have to live with it every day , that i will not get any more grandchildren and i will never see my daughters again .
the sari club was built on the ground when the first world war was launched shortly after 11 p.m. on 12 october 2002 in a small car .
peter hughes was in paddy &apos;s bar where only 20 seconds earlier a self-mortal strike took place .
he fell after the attack a month ago .
hughes said patek had the same fate as the three other members of the yemaah islamic terrorist cell .
really , this type should be the death penalty above all others .
to keep it alive – no , there is no reason to keep it alive .
20 years after he was born 202 people , and many hundreds of injured , is not much .
patek is the last of the bali bombers to be brought to justice .
he almost escaped the fortress for a decade , but was eventually arrested in january 2011 in the pakistani city of abbottabad , where us forces were arrested barely four months later , al-qaeda leader .
during the negotiations , a fbi agent from the united states said that intelligence reports inherited the fact that patek had been in pakistan to be bin laden with the aim of establishing the link between south-east asian terrorist groups .
&quot; he has not stood up , &quot; said corteen .
until recently , he has not shown any remorse for the suffering he has inflicted on other people .
the judgment was made before the ten-year anniversary of the attack this year , which was accompanied by commemorations in bali and australia .
&quot; this year there will be many tears , &quot; said corteen .
patek may still revoke his judgment .
faa : passengers can now use electronic equipment in aircraft ( but not mobile phones ) .
air passengers can now travel from departure to landing with their electronic devices for reading , working , playing , listening to music and viewing films .
but passengers should not expect the latter to be implemented immediately .
how quickly it would be implemented depends on the airline in question , explained faa staff michael huerta on a press conference .
airlines must be subject to faa to verify that aircraft comply with the new directives and that they comply with the training manuals of the air crew and with the rules governing the stowage of the equipment in accordance with the new rules .
the faa stated that it has already received plans from some airlines that will allow portable electronic devices to be used in aircraft .
these airlines also included delta and jetblue .
“ depending on the state of the plan , we could support the extended use of electronic devices very soon , ” the faa announced in a statement that it would be using the electronic devices .
at the moment , passengers must be able to use smartphones , tablets and other devices if the aircraft doors are closed .
they may not start again until the aircraft has reached a height of three kilometres .
when entering the landing flight , passengers must take them off again and not leave them off again before the aircraft is landed .
under the new directives , airlines whose aircraft are protected from electronic disruptions could be offered a way to provide their passengers with the equipment even when it is launched , landing and on the field .
most new commercial aircraft and other planes flying for the use of wi-fi in larger heights are now available in the uk .
laura glader , president of the professional association of professional flight attendants , welcomed the changes .
“ if the new regulation is implemented safely – and we are working closely with the airline in this regard – both sides will benefit from it , ” commented glading .
we are frankly tired of being like a fool on this issue .
nevertheless , internet connections to surf , exchange e-mails , text messages or download data remained under three kilometres long .
passengers are asked to use smartphones , tablets and other devices in the flight mode .
so still no “ words with friends ” .
and heavier devices like laptops must continue to be stowed , as this is a risk of injury if they are stolen by the cabin .
mobile phone calls during the flight will also remain prohibited .
the regulatory competence for telephone calls lies with the federal communications agency ( fsf ) .
faa may lift the ban on certain electronic devices at the start and landing of certain electronic devices on the start and landing of certain electronic devices on the same drive when the vehicle is in use and landing .
last month mark rosenker said of road safety authority national transport safety agency that the transport safety board should be responsible for national transport .
“ mobile phones are really a problem , not only because they potentially cause disturbances in navigation devices , but because we are dependent on the fcc to know that the transmission from the air also transmits transmission masts ” , says .
a advisory committee of the industry , led by the faa to study this issue , will be able to recommend the adoption of a new directive on the protection of intellectual property rights in the field of electronic communications last month .
in recent years , pressure on the fact-finding mission has increased , restrictions on use have been lowered .
critics such as the democratic senator claire mccaskill from missouri represent the view that there is no valid legal security reasons for the ban .
the restrictions are also increasingly heavy .
some studies have mentioned that the system can be used up to one third of passengers to switch off the equipment .
the faa began in 1966 to promote the use of electronic devices by air passengers , after reports of disturbances in navigation and communication equipment were submitted by passengers .
new aircraft are much more dependent on electrical systems than previous generations of air vehicles , but they are also so constructive that they can be used by the faa to provide electronic interference .
airlines offer passengers a wide range of services for several years now , if the flight is reached .
the wi-fi connection is available in the public areas of the hotel .
the vast majority of passenger aircraft should be used for the greater use of electronic equipment in accordance with the new directives , said huerta .
today &apos;s electronic devices generally give much less radiation than the previous ones .
e-reader , for example , only gives minimal radiation if you are using flip sheets .
but downloading or sending data is not the same as downloading data .
the advocates of easing restrictions on the use of devices are the united states , canada , the united states , japan , and the united states .
in 2011 , corporate employees invited a passenger plane full of kindle e-reader and made a test flight to avoid problems .
members of the faa advisory committee are expressing concern about the situation in the region .
douglas kidd from the passenger association national association of airline pairs , said that he was the opinion that the disruption caused by the equipment was real , even if the risk was minimal .
other committees have said that there is no more than a few reports from pirates who have been responsible for a disruption of aircraft systems by the devices .
the committee recommended that the faa should not allow the pilot to fly to the united states for instrument landing .
a group from the travel industry welcomed the changes and called them &quot; reasonable &quot; .
“ we are pleased that the faa recognises that a pleasant passenger experience is not at odds with safety , ” said roger dow , ceo of the u.s. travel services association .
by air rescue service from north sea coast , the island of geretteter vogel is released again .
a car park is available at the coast , which is also available for rent .
the water purse was filled last month with a helicopter after aberdeen .
colin seddon , head of the centre , said : “ this water purse was probably a winter draught from northern europe , which was replaced by the strong winds over the north sea . ”
it seems that the exhausted vogel sought refuge on the borehole .
he added : “ he could not continue flying , so we have to stop asking for help .
when she was released , the water purse was again fit and healthy .
is europe ’ s elite prepared to do business with britain ?
business for britain was founded in april with the intention of expanding the economy to include the united states and the united states , with a view to defining what those who provide wealth and work in britain want to change our relations with the eu .
to this end , we have the largest and most comprehensive survey among british economic leaders .
yougov asked about 1.000 leaders in the world economy , who were about to take over the uk ’ s corporate sizes , sectors , and regions .
the results of the survey will surprise many .
we have found that the vast majority of the companies are now outside europe .
you want the government leaders to take new trade links with countries like china , india , and brazil .
in your opinion , when asked about certain subjects regulated by law – from antitrust law to product legislation – the majority of economic leaders believe that the control of these key competences should be transferred to westminster .
there was general dissatisfaction with the internal market , as the companies said that the costs of the brussels rules have now exceeded the benefits that would be part of europe &apos;s trade area – even 40 % of the large companies voted .
finally , and probably most importantly , it is our interviewees of economic leaders that have shown that a clear majority would like to see britain move on the path towards changing the agreement and a relationship with the eu based on trade , not politics .
this realization , which has been proven by companies of all sizes and leading groups , shows that the economy is heading for “ meaningful change , ” which is the theme of action .
it is a question of a lot – a change to the agreement and better conditions for britain would lead to a 16 % change of opinion in favour of remaining in the eu in a referendum .
the prime minister should have no doubt : this survey shows that the british economy is behind its plan for renegotiating british conditions for eu membership .
it also shows that companies are benefiting from renegotiation and that the power relations are being shifted back to britain .
a better deal for the british economy is possible and increasingly necessary .
priority must be given to jobs and growth in britain , as the result of our survey shows what greater growth is for businesses in trade and a fundamental role for the brotherhood in the approach to legislation in brussels .
alexei miller of gazprom is a pipeline in bulgaria that marks the beginning of a new gas era in the gas era in bulgaria .
the construction of the south stream pipeline is now underway in bulgaria .
“ today ’ s event is a milestone : construction work on the bulgarian section of the south stream gas pipeline , the largest and most important project in europe , has begun , ” said the ceo .
the project is a key element in the energy security of the entire european continent .
south stream is to provide more diversity in russia ’ s export routes through europe .
a contract dispute between gazprom and his counterparts in ukraine , ukraine , in which the majority of russian gas is destined for europe , worries a greater risk of gas consignment in conventional routes , such as official routes .
miller said that the direct link to bulgaria , a member of the european union , means that the border crossings linked to transit countries are “ responsible for the long run . ”
bulgarian consumers receive gas from south stream to be discounted prices if the entire project is to be put into operation in 2015 .
according to gazprom , construction work in other subordinate countries should be carried out on the planned route at the end of the year .
the pipeline is limited to an annual capacity of 62.3 billion cubic metres of natural gas .

consultation before the royal commission : two ymca employees before the accusations against jonathan lord for sexual abuse and for the murder of a child .
two ymca employees from new south wales ( nsw ) are arrested for sexual offences in connection with children .
but the opening statement before the commission had not given the ymca a statement that ‘ in the organisation never had a incident of sexual abuse ’ .
managing director phillip hare was informed of a case in which a ymca employee was arrested for offences involving child pornography .
hares said gail furness , one of the commission assisted lawyer , that he was not convinced of the first case , the second but not the second .
he admitted that the opening statement of the ymca to the commission was also inaccurate in asserting that the commission had not received external audits .
evidence before the commission shows that the ymca is aware that the commission is not taking the second lowest in the assessment of four possible measures in a quality audit of the department of education .
hares , who was playing at the ymca with 21 , admitted that the management had “ heard from me downwards ” at the setting of lord verst and not ensured that he had been there .
lord was a member of the un security council at the beginning of the year for sexual offences against twelve boys .
he was sentenced to at least six years in prison .
hare , however , said that the ymca is a cultural problem that affects employees .
the staff said they had committed violations and they were not aware of any such offences , amongst other things , that lord was alone with children , that he was privately responsible for babysitter , she sat on his lap , saying that he was children .
danielle ockwell , whose chief lord of the rings , was asked to attend a child protection training course because she was not a child because of his behaviour , said that he would not be able to attend the child services .
the managing director stated that he would not accept statements by employees that they would not dare to give their superiors notice that they had been sent .
instead , he said , it was their friendship with lord that made their judgement less , which is why they had not reported it .
hares explained that he had submitted a report to the ymca nsw board that the leakage that the organization had learned from the jonathan protocol was not the same .
hares said that the decision to force employees to sign confidentiality obligations shortly after the accusations were made was taken by the managing director of the children &apos;s services of ymca , liam whitley .
he said that this should prevent contamination of the evidence that was being produced , but that was &apos; overzealous &apos; and badly implemented .
the ymca nsw was in the time when jonathan lord was appointed between 2009 and 2011 .
he explained that there are “ serious problems ” in the recruitment , review , inclusion , training and management of the system .
the hearing was held until 20 december .
tony blair said that he would seize the chance to return as british prime minister – but admits that a comeback is unlikely .
in an interview this evening on the occasion of the fifth anniversary of his retirement from office , the european council &apos;s 59-year-old proclaimed his views on various domestic issues .
since his resignation in june 2007 , after a decade as head of state , blair has largely avoided bribing himself to british politics , and his comments have mostly been directed at foreign policy and his role as envoy of the quartet .
when asked whether he would like to be elected prime minister , he was not asked to do so by the evening standard .
when the horse-show experts met in cardiff , they were able to see the horse of the year and they were not aware of the need for a tough competition .
but no one was prepared for the three year old fenton kirkland .
the knirps that has not even been in the kindergarten and only a few months ago took its first steps , and its shetland-pony toffee trapped lockers through the three rounds and holded .
the inseparable couple , both equal , were arrested for their appearance .
at his competition with men and women with elegant melodies , he had his leghold cap in a freak .
fenton was founded by the judges for his natural abilities in handling the pony .
and toffee received bestmarks for his performance and personality .
fenton had visited toffee last march as a gift to his third birthday and since then he has been working with the shetland pony every day .
his mother , donna , 30 , said : “ fenton and toffee are a great span . ”
they had to fight against the entire participant field and are equipped with gold cup and rosette .
it was only the second time that he was with toffee participating in a competition , and we were all delighted that he was won .
completely stranded in the arena thought it was so phenomenal that it was not able to take photographs with him .
the little boy from the village of nantyglo near ebbw vale , south wales , follows the footsteps of his tante sharon howells , who has been in the horses for over ten years .
howell &apos;s told us : &quot; the whole audience was like electrified and everyone fuelled him and lamented him . &quot;
he ran on sand all the length of the arena and although he was so tiny , he was not able to make fantastic work .
fenton is crazy about animals – he loves horses , tractors and farms .
as it starts , the system will not be very long before it is launched on the “ horse of the year ” show – and i am sure that it will be well cut .
a spokesman for the annual horse show said : “ fenton is only three , but he knows how to use his pony . ”
together they are a great team .
the jury evaluated fenton and toffee after , how well they did .
they are looking for good cooperation between pony and leader – and here fenton and toffee were the best in the ring .
i am sure that fenton &apos;s sweet clothes will do their part to make the fitting really perfect to occasion .
chinese newspapers are to be “ reformed ” after calling for a “ reform ” call .

the guangzhou based guangzhou team had a rare public run to help free guangzhou journalist chen yongzhou .
but chen later said on television that he had been given bribes , in order to read reports of a sub-state company .
now the new express will be a “ comprehensive rectification ” , explained regulators in .
the “ rectification order ” was issued by the food and drug administration .
preliminary investigations are carried out to show that the new express , the new yanghcheng evening news group , is between september 2012 and august 2013 subject to several inaccurate reports about the stock exchange .
“ the editorial management of the new express was disorganised , ” the regulatory authority issued a statement .
she said that it was decided to ‘ impose administrative punishment on chen yongzhou ’ and to impose his reporters ’ license .
in addition , the yangcheng evening news group has been instructed to provide a complete rectification of the new express and recommended that the relevant people in the new express be identified and immediately become the leader .
chen had several articles for the new express , in which he talked about alleged financial irregularities in a manufacturer of construction machinery called zoomlion .
after being arrested , he published a report on two calls for his release .
but chen then came up on state television and admitted that he was making false reports against pay .
“ in this case , i have estimated zoomlion damage as well as the entire news industry and its ability to restore public confidence . ”
i have seen it primarily because i have been looking for money and glory .
i realise that i am wrong .
after chen ’ s apology , the new express released an apology on the front page and explained that it was not possible to use the new york times reports correctly .

drogentunnel with own railway between the usa and mexico discovers the area around the island .
one of the most sophisticated tunnels for the smuggling of drugs between the us and mexico , which is fully equipped with lighting , ventilation and electric railway .
the us authorities described the 120 times 90 centimeters measuring tunnel as a major source of sophisticated information about the use of the tunnel .
the tunnel , which is located in the zigzag pattern over a length of just under six football fields , connects warehouses near tijuana , mexico , and san diego , usa .
there are numerous places of uncharted storage in the area , making it easier to use drugs .
the tunnel has been closed before drugs have been transported unrecognized , and the united states authorities have declared that they are not .
in the discovery of the tunnel , eight and a half tonnes of marijuana and 148 kilograms of cocaine were secured , the court records were .
three men who , according to the authorities , worked as drivers were arrested for having the right to travel and for the intended sale of marijuana and cocaine .
they are threatened with a sentence of imprisonment if they are sentenced to ten years in prison .
in nogales , arizona , smugglers are relying on a wide underground network of entwares and channels .
the tunnel is the eighth large passage , which has been in san diego since 2006 .
some of the largest tunnels were built after the marijuana harvest in central mexico in october , which has made drug cartels face the challenge of how to sell their product to consumers quickly .
in 2010 , authorities held a barely 640 meters long passage with rails that were taken from a kitchen in a residential house in tijuana to two storehouses in san diego .

veganism is a popular form of vegetarianism , according to lexicon , but it is different from vegetarianism in a very significant way .
because , while vegetarians are committed to the consumption of seeds , eis or a powerful fruit , they are not allowed to eat them .
milk , cheese , egg , besides the waiver of meat and fish , the vegan leaves the vegan from all consumption of animal products - even dogs and cats are denied .
what remains , one might wonder , but , looking at the situation , the vegane diet is characterized by a considerable influx of ideas .
&quot; bread coating is very popular &quot; , explains ute henkelmann , who is the owner of the local bread reforming house , who has a wide range of special products for vegans .
reuben proctor also visits the store in the domgasse .
for 13 years , the native new zealand has lived in vegan , lampertheim ( almost ) all of what he calls life .
at the turn of the century , the next step was taken and i became vegan .
&quot; the conviction came not only because of nutrition , but because of the choice of shoes , &quot; proctor says , the artificial leather of normal leather prefers .
he realized that there are also problems in other everyday matters without animal products .
first and foremost , vegan is an ethic .
&quot; i do not want animals to die for me , &quot; says proctor the maxim of vegans who are on the whole consumer behaviour .
instead of burgers , stirrers or rubber bears , the company is now in the process of becoming a vegan .
&quot; it is a double bonus , &quot; says proctor today , &quot; indeed , vegan does not give up , no ascendants , but it is an enrichment &quot; .
and it is precisely these conditions that left some still so well intentioned attempts to fail .
&quot; the addiction factor is a very important factor that can give many people up quickly , similar to smoking , &quot; proktor presents a comparison .
and applies one : &quot; certain tastes are not fixed on the animal &quot; .
it is often the spices or the type of preparation that are used to make the taste .
&quot; however , you can also use the same effect in other ways , &quot; the vegan is a clear illustration .
the barbecue festival is a celebration of the celebration of the aubergines , mushrooms and a few vegan sausages .
it takes care of a balanced , varied diet , in which there is a certain defensive effect .
of course , there is a desire to have something between the teeth , that is legitimate .
&quot; it should taste but the most important thing is not only animal food .
damage to health , including eating disorders , another widespread assumption , he did not suffer .
for me , the changeover had a positive aspect .
i take no other cholesterol and i have an increased vitamin content .
there are high-performance shops , restaurants , and shops that are exclusively fed by vegan .
&quot; my blood values are excellent , i am often checked .
in particular , the lack of vitamin b12 warns many vegan critics .
&quot; since animals are genetically fed , the eu should not be allowed to graze on the pasture , it is doubtful whether the meat that is eaten in the cold chest is the vitamin b12 proportion .
for vegans , there is also the possibility of using the coenzyme in the form of tablets .
&quot; my b12 values are fine &quot; , he explains .
we must be a great champion in food procurement .
there are basic foodstuffs , after all , everywhere and every supermarket has soya milk and other products .
all i need is a little bit of a place .
only occasionally i buy something special .
&quot; many people overlook that it is only the finished products that are expensive , but that is how it is with &quot; ordinary &quot; finished products , as we know , &quot; he said .
anyway , the preparation of vegetarian dishes is much cheaper than the preparation of a vegan dish .
&quot; in the house kitchen there is much to discover , with a few small tricks you can enjoy good if not partially better results , &quot; says proctor .
margarine instead of butter , a little more baking powder and carbon acid instead of egg , with its vegan cheese cake , proctor could also amaze his sworn parents .
family celebrations give vegan a new spice .
this has momentum when you cook together , it has a new value .
&quot; the situations that can arise are so different as the people themselves &quot; , says proktor .
of course , he has already been sceptical .
taste my food not like anymore ?
&quot; should i feel bad now , because i drink milk ? &quot; - at solcherlei , i have to ask as a vegan with fingerprints .
&quot; i reject people not , but i am part of this society , &quot; i want proctor not to be an enclave .
and , more precisely , the everyday world does not seem so alien as it seems - and the vegan does not appear as in everyday life as in the general sense .
fast food is also allowed .
pommes is everywhere !
&quot; many donors offer false profits , but they are not .
in a pizzeria , it deviates from pasta dishes or orders a pizza without cheese .
the restaurants are so slowly coming up with it .
&quot; when i started 13 years ago , i was vegan .
&quot; if enough demand comes , they may be inclined to accept the food card .
vegan restaurants develop , such as the comb &apos;s in mannheim or the café vogelfrei .
proctor wants to make sure that other restaurants can at least have a vegan dish on the menu .
basically , vegans are dishes for all .
everyone can eat them , so they are the opposite of exclusive .
&quot; meat dishes are exclusive , however , and in the truest sense of the word , because they exclude others &quot; , proctor notes .
&quot; if you want to avoid food scandals , veganism is a safe way to treat the vast majority of the food from the outset . &quot;
the purchase of vegan products can be something difficult at the beginning .
especially when you learn to understand that this is also used in peanuts animal additives as a color giver , you seem to be satisfied with the ethics of so many hurdles and fall quickly of courage .
not only because of this , reuben proctor and lars thomsen wrote a book : &quot; veganissimo - animal ingredients and their alternatives &quot; explains the many ingredients that are used in food and also in cleaning .
&quot; gradually , a scanner looks and knows how to look at the signs and logos .
veganism , he is an important moral finger , and he is pointing to awareness .
perhaps he is not quite able to change his habits , but at least he can tell the consumer what he is doing to keep his habits critical .

tax on foreign real estate owners against london ’ s speculative bubble
the treasury has provisionally reviewed cgt measures , which are waiting for the commission to finalise .
already , revenues from the stempel-tax on residential property are exceeding the total tax on residential property in the westminster and kensington &amp; chelsea districts , which accounted for £ 708 million in fiscal 2012 .
cook said : “ after the increases in stamp tax on high-price investment , the government is now introducing the associated legislation against a circumvention .
“ but this move could discourage some foreign investors , which could make buying real estate in london , or owners of it .
first class real estate – the top five to ten percent of the housing market by price – in the wealthy south west west of london , the most distinguished of full london ’ s west belt .
prices in central london were consistent with the annual growth of 5.7 % .
scientists have been able to shed more light on the context in which the pregnancy of a dog is related to its mood .
previous research has shown that happiness is a problem with pregnant dogs rather than the cock .
but now scientists say that other dogs will not have these subtle differences and respond to them .
professor georgio vallortigara , a neuroscientists at the university of trento , said : “ man knows well that the left and right brains are different on stimulation .
we have tried to do this for other species .
he also noticed that in dogs , like in humans , the rights of the brain half are important for the movement of the left side and vice versa , and that the two hemispheres have different roles in emotions .
to learn more about how dogs are placed on the side of the tail of their breed , please read the section on the side of the dog .
they measure the heart rate of the four-legged and analyzed the behavior .
we will probably soon understand why pregnancy is so hot and so on .
professor vallortigara said : “ we have the dogs movies with dogs that we have shown – either a true version of nature or a silhouette to see distracting other aspects .
if the animals saw a otherwise extinct man , the dog would have to turn the tail to the right ( from the perspective of the wearing dog ) .
but was the mood predominantly left ( again from the perspective of the dog , the weather , the dog ) so the rise of your heart rate and you saw unquiet .
professor martinez believes that the european union is communicating not abruptly with each other through these movements .
it is convinced that the dogs from experience have learned to play in the movements they have worried about and when not .
he said : ‘ if you have different encounters with other dogs and you want to wedge with your tail in one direction rather with friendly behavior , and the rights side is more of a less friendly behavior , then you ’ ll react on basis .
researchers say that the findings of houndebearers , veterinarians and trainers will help to understand the emotions of their animal .
john bradshaw , expert on dog behavior and hospitality , has been working on the faculty of animal healing at the university of bristol to explain that this is not the first study to be studied .
last year , a team of the university of lincoln found that dogs had left their head , when they had an aggressive dog .
in another research project at the university of victoria in canada , the following article was : “ dogs tend to go to a robot dog when their dog is not hunted .
he says that the differences could arise because the hats in the different studies are not the animals in the films or the robots .
a study of how dogs can be reacted to real dogs could help , he explained .
“ although there are considerable evidence for many different mammals that the two brains are not responsible for different purposes , they are still required to be examined .
as their behaviour is simply recorded , they will be used for a long time .

pope francis appointed president of the european parliament in february .
pope francis will attend the meeting of the new cardinals of the catholic church on 22 february , as the vatican announced on thursday .
cardinals are the highest clerics in the catalan language .
there are currently 201 cardinals .
however , a cardinal who has an age of 80 years cannot be interested in the pope &apos;s election – that is one of the 120 “ election privileges ” in a group of cardinals .
in a statement in which the news was announced , pater federal reserve said : &quot; the world is not yet a single person , but a single person .
pope francis
jack valero of catholic voices said that the european union &apos;s number of eligible voters is about 20 % below the number of cardinals .
he explained that a pope appointed a man as many cardinals as necessary , so that the number of eligible voters could be reduced .
the consistency story next year is therefore important .
at the moment , there is a certain overhang on europe &apos;s side , and particularly on italy &apos;s .
“ it will be interesting to see if the new pope kardinäle from the rest of the world will appoint to restore the balance , ” he said .
forty per cent of catholics live in south america , but they have only a tiny number of cardinals .
the cardinals will also be the first to be established since the formation of the church , founded by francis , in the cardinals , a group of eight cardinals .
in the past , the pope decided everything alone .
“ now francis has won these eight cardinals , which he can help , ” he said .
he said that it is “ well possible ” that francis would have to leave the cardinals for advice .
but we have not been in this position – and this is all new .
valero said that typically the most bigged-sized bishops were cardinals .
gm is calling for new pickup trucks in the us to repair the seat backrest .
general motors called for almost 19,000 of his brand new chevrolet silverado and gmc sierra pickup trucks to be delivered in 2014 to solve a problem with the manually adjustable seat backrest .
some of the cars may have a defect in the mechanism for the front seat backrest .
for this reason , they do not comply with the federal guidelines for vehicle safety on headrest .
“ when from the back of the vehicle , the car can be moved to the front restraint .
the retrieved models were reviewed between 1 august and 10 september .
the delivery of gm trucks began in june and is the most important model launch of the leading us car manufacturer since the insolvency related restructuring in 2009 .
gm informed vehicle owners in the first october session of more than 50 % of the vehicle &apos;s weight .
the nhtsa was unable to reach a compromise on the basis of the 16-day government shutdown , which had a negative impact on car sales .
the sale of silverado and sierra trucks , which are planned for the 2014 model , is in the first ten months of the year at 20 % .
in october , gm sold 42.660 silverado and 16.503 sierra pickup trocks .
the gm share rose to € 4,950 at the new york stock exchange , up from $ 37.47 on friday afternoon .
despair of an obama constituent
i have asked president obama twice to meet the united states in the hope that change will be possible .
he says obama has commendable efforts to improve the situation affected by the blockade detail of republicans .
the policy of blockade does not excuse the website problems of obamacare , the drone attacks and the use of drone attacks on the internet .
obama ’ s memoirs of the 2008 election campaign are a sad reminder of what is possible .
nathaniel p. morris is a student in the second year of harvard medical school in new york .
i am reading a terrible sad story at the moment .
it is a book i have believed would be a book of my life during the dark period of the second year of my medical studies .
it is called “ the audacity to win ” ( courage to win ) and describes the memoirs of barack obama ’ s presidential election .
when i am in the evening with my patient records and go to bed , i get a little bit of a time when i was a policymaker who inspired millions and gave a speech a little bit of a smoke .
the election was a landslide victory and news spokesman held .
my classmates wept for joy and my parents collected all the newspapers , which they could find .
a young team of visionaries was on the way to the white house and the nation was ready for change .
when obama took office in 2008 , he had agreed to the us $ 82 % margin of approval .
and then i close the book .
reswitching to the present is a bad awakening , as if you were driven out of a dream .
it is difficult to stick to these optimistic times – they seem to be a vague memory , a sad memory , a vague memory of missed opportunities .
in the years since i first voted , i have been able to change something .
but it is simply nothing i would have imagined .
i appreciate the great and varied things that have been done by obama , from the adoption of the affiliation to the creation of a new united states health insurance agency .
i agree that the european union &apos;s party political blockade should be too much of an effort to be made to resolve our nation &apos;s problems .
but , having heard the obama administration repeatedly to colleagues and well-known representatives , i am convinced that the eu ’ s failure to explain itself is a sign of the end .
i have one point of political despair .
the republican blockade policy cannot explain why it is not possible to prevent the interception of foreign leaders or to stop the killing of innocent children by drones in overseas .
it cannot explain why the national security agency has not provided data on the private life of americans .
it cannot explain why anwar al-awlaki , a us american politician , was without trial .
it does not justify the results of a report which says that efforts by the white house to calm down the media are the ‘ aggressive ’ media .
and , most recently , it cannot excuse the inability to work in the more than three years since the adoption of the affirmable care act .
i do not know if that is what i would have expected .
whether i would have understood with 18 that government work would have made the political campaigns that preceded it contradict what it was .
obviously , the members &apos; office is not a predictable course , as an opposition party and random events such as the newtown-massacre have made public discussion a thing of the past .
but if i look at the examples above , it seems to be largely the government itself that has chosen them .
and that bothers me most .
i have re-elected obama in 2012 , not because i am concerned about his candidacy .
mitt romney was a confusing and unbalanced statement .
i had the impression that i had a second term for obama , free from the pressure of future elections , that would fulfil the hope we have been hearing about for so long .
but , with the decline in the approval ratings for obama to less than 45 % this week , the return to 2008 is all the more severe by this book .
it awakens in me the desire for the many promises that have been made that have disappeared into the air .
this week i read a section in the book describing how obama can avoid a serious loss against clinton in the pre-election campaign in pennsylvania .
in a meeting with the election helpers following the decision , he told his staff that they had to get back on course and follow the purpose of their cause .
“ i want us to keep our magic back , ” he said .
we must remember who we are .
five years later , mr. president , and i could tell you no more .

clive palmer claims prime minister tony abbott has been in conflict with interests in parental leave .
the billionaire and mep clive palmer says that prime minister tony abbott is in a conflict of interest in his plans for parental leave because his daughters are pregnant and could therefore benefit from it .
the mining magnat that is located in a judicial dispute over the payment of 6 million dollars to co2 taxes is a major challenge to the claim that the mining magnat was wiping out questions about whether it is in conflict .
the palmer united party could hold up to four votes in the senate , which is important for the decision whether the co2 and other mining industries will be abolished or cut .
but palmer claimed that only ministers had conflicts of interest and that the subsidiaries of abbott had been personally benefiting from the laws .
&quot; he is in a major conflict of interest when it comes to paid parental leave .
two months after the election , the palmer election commission declared that it would be possible to reach a majority of the votes by 53 votes in advance after the recount .
palmer called for a review of the voting process , which would allow it to proceed more quickly .
tony abbott ’ s daughters frances and bridget .
if these elections were to take place two months after the end of the vote ?
“ we need a better system , ” he said .
why should we not have a system where you can invent , which would send the data to a computer , immediately choose and then ask for 6 : 30 in the evening ?
palmer also criticized the use of pencils when marking the ballot papers .
if you use them , because you can erase the results if you don &apos;t like them ?
nowadays , to coordinate with pencils is incredible .
the electoral commission has carefully examined the options for electronic voting and recently adopted a joint legislative proposal with new zealand .
palmer , 59 , explained that to his policy an international airport for sunshine coast is needed .
a public office is about the service of the public .
“ we are not seeking reward other than that of history , namely that we are in a critical time of this community , ” he said .
rbs suspends two forex traders
the royal bank of scotland has two dealers in its foreign exchange department .
some of the world ’ s largest banks , including ubs , barclays , deutsche bank , and rbs , confirmed that they had been in contact with the authorities in the world ’ s largest financial market , where 5.3 trillion dollars are trillion dollars a day .
the two dealers would be the first rbs employees to be employed in the expanding investigation .
the bank , which has not commented on the suspension , has confirmed that the bank is not in a position to receive information from authorities .
“ our investigation into this subject goes on and we cooperate fully with the fca and other regulatory bodies . ”
last month , the situation gave close people the message that rbs would not read the records of e-mails and instant messages sent from and to a former distributor .
this dealer , richard usher , had the rbs 2010 leave and is now expected to leave from its current position as european head of forex spot trading at jpmorgan .
rohan ramchandani , head of the european spot trading company citi , was arrested this week and mailed to matt gardiner , formerly chief currency trader at barclays and ubs .
none of these traders has been accused of any misconduct .
instant messaging group of usher included bankers among barclays and the citigroup , they said the situation was close .
ubs announced this week that they are taking steps against some of their employees after the swiss regulatory authority finma declared that they would be a courageous person to manipulate the forex market in a number of swiss banks .
at least six authorities worldwide – the european commission , finma , the swiss competition authority weko , the fca , the us ministry of justice , and the hong kong monetary authority – have been dealing with this issue .
hsbc , citigroup , jpmorgan and credit suisse have also conducted internal investigations or inquiries for information from authorities , said with the situation familiar persons .
banks get in touch with instant messages and e-mails from several years of searching for cases of malpractice .
the news of these investigations has been disseminated to the traders in an area that has been growing at a rate of profit in recent years .
some bankers have tried to downplay the affair and said that there is almost no way of stopping the extensive and highly acclaimed liquidity of the foreign exchange market that is being sold to leading traders .
a leading trader noticed that despite the enormous daily volume in the forex trading , the fragmentation of the liquidity between the various trading platforms was not yet fully understood and the increasing use of their own internal platforms by banks .
the news came out the same day , when credit suisse announced that it had announced this week to a dealer in their london exchange traded funds office .
the bank promptly informed the competent authorities and cooperated with them .
“ we are sure that the dealer has acted alone and that the matter will be contained , ” said credit suisse .
the building fence on the bechle plot paints the wooden plot .
a group of citizens &apos; initiative &quot; swiss meadows &quot; has been blocking the bauzaun on the bechtle plot at the spa promenade in bad herrenalb .
moreover , the us government cleaned and widened the footpath , as it says in a press release .
the planned coverage of the decaying house in the rear part of the property was not possible for security reasons , because the site is threatened with slide .
alfred abel , who currently manages the property , had the beautification action with his colleague reinhard pouchner from the bi .
before the bi ’ s action , a transparent message was sent out with the message &apos; we are in favour &apos; .
this bothered the 20 or so members of the citizens &apos; initiative little in their action .
your motto on the big poster was &quot; we are against building rush &quot; .
it was intended to respond to the threat of even greater ruins on the swiss meadow - should the giant project one day fail .
in the conversation with many passers-by in front of the building site it became clear that some citizens believe that the implementation of the city project will improve many , although many ask the same questions to the dimension of the presented project .
but they are beginning to resign because the city has to go further in responding to these questions , it is on the bi ’ s side .
as was heard , the effects of public statements by the mayor are also evident .
may had a special meeting of the local councillors , which was to be the reason for his fear of the thermal bath , should the population vote against the plans for a bathing and wellness complex on the swiss meadow .
some seem to be quite frightened because others are sceptical of &quot; crude behaviour &quot; .
the bi thanked the donors for the color and all the helpers .
ranking slipped for chiris : mane no rod , no swallow king , no swallow king .
however satisfied rankings , the ranking is with the current high shape of bundesliga table leader red bull salzburg , so disappointing was the sports director of the &quot; bulls &quot; from the referees .
&quot; there is currently a dangerous trend for mane and alan to be included in the category of shwalbenkings , &quot; he took the two offensive wires .
the latest occasion for ranking criticism was that yellow was for mane at the 3 : 0 against grödig last sunday , at which the senegalese was given a supposed acting-show - the release .
&quot; a blatant misdecision , &quot; rangnick said , the referee harkam as &quot; completely overloaded &quot; .
harkam would also have &quot; his part &quot; to escalate between salzburg coach roger schmidt and grödig-trainer adi hütter after the match .
his german compatriot was defended decisively : &apos; i would have liked to have behaved in the same way in every situation as roger schmidt &apos; .
schmidt himself wants to be a member of the german association of the german federal republic after the schmidt schmidt schmidt himself has had no contact with his colleague after the scharmmutzer with his hütter .
i do not know why .
&quot; for i am the one who insults , &quot; he stressed .
given the success of the event , rankings agreed to a commendation of the event .
&quot; there are only two words for this : good , &quot; he said .
there is not much to be dismissed .
the way in which the commission &apos;s team plays , in particular , is impressive .
this should continue .
changes in the veins in winter transfer time will hardly be possible .
there are no great reasons to change anything .
&quot; except a player joins with the desire that he or she wants to leave the club , &quot; rangnick made clear .
superior court confirms obama ’ s health law
it is a great victory for the obama administration : the us supreme court has decided to hold a referendum on the constitution , closely linked to barack obama .
with five votes to four , the judges ruled that the individual mandate of the patient protection and affordable care act was not a matter for us judges to decide by 2014 whether to take out health insurance or impose a penalty .
the chief judge john roberts suggested that the united states should be on the side of the four more liberal members of the chamber , while judges scalia , thomas , alito and kennedy chose to vote against .
the court also confirmed the remaining provisions of the code of 2700 pages .
the case against the law was filed by 26 states and the national federation of independent states .
the law was signed by all leading republican presidential candidates , including the ultimate challenger .
norway : norwegian town is a great place to see the light of giants .
with huge mirrors , the inhabitants of a norwegian village have shed light into their dark valley .
due to the low level of sunlight , the vestfjord-valley is a little bit slower from autumn to spring .
with three gigantic reflectors at 45 metres altitude , a century room was created on wednesday .
&quot; finally ! &quot; , he was a painstaking mayor of steinar bergland at the start ceremony in the tv2 channel .
some talented people turned on sunchairs , others continued to use them safely .
until now , sun-hungry people had to go to a nearby summit with a cable car in winter .
ten years ago , the local artist martin andersen presented the proposal to create mirrors for the valley .
these basic ideas were not present for the first time since 1913 .
after several years of debate , the city council finally had the 5 million crowns ( around 615 000 euros ) expensive project adopted .
a similar construction has been providing the italian alpine resort of viganella with winter sunshine for several years .
mail leaves scarcely any more on sundays
&quot; many citizens will not notice it yet , the red points for the sunday night .
a request from the fdp confirmed this .
on sundays and holidays , only before the post office in the ernst-ludwig street 36 and in the jakob müller-strasse 1 in hüttenfeld .
whether in hofheim and rosengarten , there is also sunday empty , the answer to the question from the fdp is not answered .
social and youth policy spokesman of the fdp , fritz rohrenbeck , wants to remedy this .
the devotion to sundays is an important postal service , especially for terminpost .
&quot; this entrepreneurship thrives despite the price increase for letters on january 2013 , radically and unreasonable from &quot; .
thomas bittner , group and city association of the german liberal , democrat and reform party , supports his group colleague : &apos; what annoys me is the fact that there is a secret letting time being changed or changed here . &apos;
the hotel is close to the citizens and is a miles away from the post office .
&quot; at least the post boxes in the districts of neuschloß and rosengarten must be empty again on sundays &quot; , says bittner and tuerenbeck unisono .
there are also plans for the nuclear city , especially not mobile citizens , to have a mailbox with a sunday empty , even in the meantime .
tubes beck asked in the city parliament whether the city administration had had discussions with the post about this matter .
mayor erich maier replied that the post did not work with lampertheim .
to his knowledge , however , there are no translations available in hofheim .
your party has opted for privatisation .
&quot; then decisions are taken elsewhere , &quot; said maier .
the hotel is located in the centre of frankfurt , close to the main train station and the city centre .
parking in frankfurt could soon be more expensive than parking in the city .
the magistrate of the city is discussing a proposal for transport decentralisation this morning .
the parking charges are therefore to be increased by 50 % .
but this is not to raise prices , but to increase time interval between parking clocks and parking ticket machines from 30 to 20 minutes .
in december , the city council regulation will have to decide .
the european parliament &apos;s committee on retail trade believes that this is not a good idea .
the hotel is very close to the train station and the train station .
the transport club germany believes that a 20 % increase in the form of a two-decade-long increase is &apos; quite appropriate and long overdue &apos; .
public transport will also be more expensive .

the first of these was the &quot; kolacny &quot; ( &quot; the first &quot; ) , which was the first of the two , and the first of the two , which was the first of the three , which was the first of its kind .
with the hard and placed supplements , the european union ’ s sponsors took a very heavy step .
repeatedly , they missed the opportunity offered by simon schenk and eduard schulz to clean the grid ’ s passports and attacks and were not very helpful in blocking .
two high first prizes clearly expressed the superiority of the freudenstadt in all matters .
in the face of this crushing and gambling achievement , the third sentence was then somewhat lax and lousy to the 3 : 0 final ( 25 : 13 , 25 : 14 , 25 : 22 ) .
on 2 november , the tv baiersbronn will be shown in nagold .
tsv freudenstadt i : dominik bäuerle , yannik büchle , sebastian dölker , felix pleelchen , stefan räller , simon schenk and eduard schulz .
in the b class , the murgtalhalle in baiersbronn had the second teams from baiersbronn and freudenstadt .
they delivered a hard-fought second life , a two-hour match .
nervousness on both sides caused , in particular , the ball &apos;s assumption of mistakes and points gifts ; the passports were also very precise at times .
in this highly balanced performance , the team agreed on a new set of training courses in the tv-team of marcus blasutto and a strong team of young and old .

certain species , such as rare butterflies and grasslands , can break down barriers in the form of forest areas .
you need these free connections to biodiversity .
tribukait said she wanted to do it here .
in this planning , the current measure not only seamlessly integrates .
a biosphere reserve offers also the chance to make sustainable economic progress and ecological development .
having said that , the manager of the town of reuters christoph wehl and life-project manager cornelia bischoff informed the helpers in groups .
the larger trees were in the run-up , and the forestry trawler might be available to call you .

egypt signed the first freely elected presidents of the arab league .
mohammed morsi is putting the oath of office down , but his day of triumph will not be the end of political disputes in egypt .
the islamist mohammed morsi promised a “ new egypt ” to be the first to be elected president of the country .
with his inauguration before the supreme constitutional court , morsi was also elected the first freely elected islamist president of the arab world and egypt ’ s fifth head of state since the fall of the monarchy around 60 years ago .
he put the oath before the 18 in black robes , and he was brought to the court , which was based on the nile and was an ancient egyptian temple .
“ we strive for a better future , a new egypt and a second republic , ” said morsi at the ceremony , the president ’ s live state television ceremony .
“ today , the egyptian people have laid the foundation for a new life – absolute freedom , a true democracy , and stability , ” said mursi , a sixty year-old american , a us engineer and member of the muslim brotherhood .
hundreds of soldiers and police officers guarded the building when mursi was killed shortly after 11 a.m.
just a few hundred supporters had been arrested in the court to give the new president a chance to rejoice , and contrary to the presidential prunk from the mubarak era , transport was only stopped for a short time , so the car maker .
as an uncharismatic &quot; spare wheel &quot; of the brotherhood , his personal present-day prestige has been mocking since his victory and a friday speech in which he has not only been a candidate for islamists , but also all .
“ egypt is today a civil , national , constitutional , and modern state , ” the president of the republic of egypt declared in a blue suit with a red tie .
later , morsi drove to the university of cairo , where he delivered his inaugural speech .
it was officially signed by an army chapel , which was the national anthem , to which he was appointed in a position of possession .
the military leader , feldmarshal hussein tantawi , was present .
on his arrival he was attacked by hundreds of people in the largest auditorium of the university with voices from “ the army and the people are a hand ” .
the hotel was built in 1908 as bastion of secular education and is situated in the heart of the city in the 1970s .
morsi put a symbolic oath on the tahir-square on friday , the birthplace of the uprising , which last year ended the authoritarian rule of mubarak .
but , with the disappearance of official oath in the court , not , as usual , in parliament , he is bowing to the military ’ s will , which indicates that the power struggle will continue .
morsi ’ s speech at the tahir-square was full of dramatic populist gestures .

rapes in south africa : twice life imprisonment
nine months after the brutal rape and mutilation of a 17-year-old girl , in south africa , the perpetrator has been sentenced to twice life on friday .
this was reported by the channel sabc .
the victim was later caught up in the consequences of serious injuries .
johannes kana was already in prison at the beginning of the week of crime .
the act had been disgraceful nationwide .
the then 21-year-old had anene booysen in february in an industrial site in bredasdorp near cape town .
14 hours were the doctors fighting for the survival of the victim , but in vain .
the sight of the young was so horrible that the carers and sisters were given psychological assistance .
kana had agreed during the trial that the tatnacht was going to boysen in a bar .
he also confessed that they were beaten and raped , but he denied that he was responsible for the death of the girl .
the police were initially beaten by several offenders , but dismissed two suspects from detention , because the evidence against them was not sufficient .
the public prosecutor also stressed during the trial that it was convinced that kana had been a criminal at the time of the attack alone .
rape is a crime in south africa , and it is estimated that around 64 000 cases of sexual violence are reported annually .
this is almost ten times the amount in germany , but it is the same with 82 million people as south africa ( 50 million ) .
police and women &apos;s organisations in south africa appreciate the dark number of sexual violence , but the 10-25-fold number .
jumbo visits the black forests ham and the hamlets of the black forest .
jumbo looking for the &quot; best roasted ham of the world &quot; : for the tv show &quot; galileo &quot; , he visited the pro7-star bonndorf .
the speaker is right at the outset in making it clear that the most important thing for the ham is the pig , turbomast , not a good condition .
can ham , which can be found in any supermarket , i.e. a quality product ?
uli , the chief of the great ham factory in the black forest , explains jumbo the way the company works .

&quot; i am curious to hear your roberto blanco say that you can see what happens then , &quot; says jumbo cynical .
this is where the level of private television is presented in pure culture .
but watching is still worth it .
the spectator sees that the disintegration of the chastity belt is still hand work .
for the black forest ham is traditionally without bones in shelves .
the secret of ham is the fact that the spices are mixed with salt .
the tower and the smoke moisture remind jumbo visually of a &quot; submarine &quot; .
the trick : fir branches here in the smoke provide for the special taste of the black forest ham .
20 days in the smoke make the ham finally almost black .

if people had been able to benefit too much from this in the past centuries , and had to wait for the images of heaven and hell that have &quot; shaped our ideas to this day &quot; , the contemporary prophecy doctrine is derived from the full .

she has &quot; helped us with so many question marks that the interpretation of the declaration marks is not available to us . &quot;
johanna rahner goes on to say , &apos; but the crucial challenge remains the anger of death &apos; .

two junior drivers from the german top class were in this competition as well : felix bader from bad waldsee and pascal treubel from asch-linz came with the recommendation to good rankings with the german champions .
these two could set themselves apart , as expected .
as in the previous year , felix bader was able to achieve a small advance in time to the finish and defended his title as overall winner of the short distance .
in second place , pascal treubel was able to place himself again .
the ladies were theresa duelli from the team albtraum , who had placed it at the top of the race .
in second and third , anne adel from illmensee and leonie came together from owingen .

not only in terms of performance , the whole range of sports enthusiasts was represented .
the age structure also ranged from ten years for the youngest to over 70 years for the oldest starters .
in the main race there were even more absolute topaths at the start this year .
four drivers were able to distinguish themselves from the regional leaders .

on the way through mud , rivers and jungles for free medical care .
dr. georges bwelle provides free medical assistance in remote villages in cameroon , the netherlands , and in remote villages .
bwelle and his team spend almost every weekend trying to save hundreds of patients .
in the west african country there are not many doctors , only one for 5,000 people .

dr. georges bwelle is one of the top 10 of the cnn heroes of 2013 .
you can choose for him or any other hero in the top 10 to see him as the “ cnn hero of the year ” .
the winner will receive $ 250,000 to continue his exceptional work .
for 21 years , georges bwelle saw his sick father repeatedly thrown into consciousness and turned into hospitals .
jamef bwelle was born in 1981 in a car accident near yaoundé , capital cameroon .
he was first only a broken arm , but then he was formed a disenfranchised , which was based on his brain .
&quot; there was no neurosurgeon in cameroon , &quot; says georges bwelle .
we could have removed it from cameroon if we had the money .
instead , bwaal spent years reassuring his father in overcrowded clinics and hospitals .
“ it is not easy , ” comments bwelle .
you can walk to the house at five o &apos;clock in the morning and race to the hospital to be the first , and is not the first .
there are a great many patients .
some people even die because they have to wait .
the situation has hardly changed since bwell &apos;s father died in 2002 .
in cameroon , there is only one doctor for each 5,000 people , the world health organization says .
on the other hand , the relationship in the united states is with a doctor for 413 people .
but even if there is a doctor for you , the majority of cameroons could not afford to visit .
two out of five people in the country live below the poverty line and nearly three-quarters of health spending in the country are private .
“ the only problem you have is the poverty , ” says barbary .
and poverty makes it impossible to save life .
his father and so many of his compatriots suffered in bwelle decided to do something about it .
dr. georges bwelle and his volunteer team have spent 700 free operations last year .
he became a doctor and worked as a vascular surgeon in central hospital in yaoundé .
he also founded a non-profit organization called ascovime , which is open to rural residents at weekends and is offering free medical care .
since 2008 , he and his voluntary group have contributed almost 32,000 people .
almost every friday , he and up to 30 people were forced to take a minibus and drive with the medical equipment that was provided on the roof over untied terrain into the villages where the help was needed .
not always everything runs smoothly .
more than once , they had to drive the vehicles through rivers and mud .
but if you arrive , you will be greeted as heroes : a feast , singing and dance and the best accommodation that the place has to offer .
in these villages , there is a real need for celebration and bust free of charge , with its wide smile and unlimited energy , to be part of the cheerful celebration .
the next morning the team starts the investigation of hundreds of patients .
“ we treat 500 people per journey ” , says bwelle .
they come from a radius of 60 kilometres around the village – and on foot .
each of these weekend clinics offers medical care in a number of areas .
many people are being arrested for malaria , tuberculosis , malnutrition , diabetes , parasites and sexually transmitted diseases .
others get crutches , donated glasses or free birth certificates – a document that is relevant to school , but is worth many poor families .
in the evening , the team conducts simple operations with local anaesthesia .
the operations usually take place in a school , the town hall or an apartment ; after the operation , the patients are on and go to the recreation area to take up space for the next one .
the lighting for the op and the disinfection equipment is provided by the generator of the group and thus work bwelle and its volunteers to the early morning hours .
it is a strenuous thing , but the villagers usually help to make the team motivate .
&quot; they drumble all night so we wake up and our work continues . &quot;
on sunday the team will then drive back to the city , tired but proud of the work done .
the group – a mixture of cameroon doctors and foreign medical students – has spent 700 free surgeries last year and knows that they are doing an enormous difference to people .
a man explained that the free operation of a breakdown of a service he received was now able to provide him with work again .
“ that changes the future of my family , ” said the man .
besides the weekend clinics and his work as a surgeon in the hospital , bwelle also works at night in private clinics in yaoundé .
with this second job he financially finance 60 % of his non-profit activities , so bwelle ; the rest came from private donations .
“ i really do not know when he sleeps , ” says katie o &apos;malley , who was in the dresden school for the second year in philadelphia medicine and has volunteered to be in bwelles .
it is always available in hospital or tried to pay money for the organization so that it can respond to these campaigns .
medical and health care products are available for students with a medical background such as o &apos;malley , who come from the usa and europe and support bwelle .
“ we can help with operations where we can help to save blood .
that would be a medical student in america in the second year .
students pay for their trip to cameroon themselves and often carry out recourse to the sanitation equipment .
but once you have arrived in yaoundé , bwelle will take over the accommodation , transport and instructions .
“ he is without doubt a hero , ” says o &apos;malley .
he devotes his life to this organisation and his desire to help the cameroon people knows no bounds .
for bwelle , the almost continuous work is not a burden .
to others to a happier life and thus to make a promise that he gave to his father , prepares him great joy .
“ i am so happy when i do this work ” , says the author of bwelle .
i am thinking of my father .
i hope he will see what i do .
i do it to help people to laugh again and to make the pain felt .

the role of santiago , the old man in hemingways novelle &quot; the old man and the sea &quot; , is horst janson on the body of a human being .
janson was a herself in the same vein as the actress .
the old man santiago cannot be denied any protection in fishing .
the two are simply great complements each other .
it is almost believed that the folds in the neck of the old man , of whom the fisherman manolo speaks , can be seen .
if santiago is tired of life bubbling on the chair , it is not so much at janson .
in addition , the role of the old fisherman is fully a character that janson has done excellently .
hemingway told the story of a fighter , a brave man , who was not given up and who ultimately died through his knowledge and also his will .
janson is widely known as alone actor on the stage .
he manages to attract the audience &apos;s attention .
his efforts to finally get the fish to the surface of the water are so real that it is not difficult for spectators to forget that the sea is only lit from blue water bottles .
director jens hasselmann makes the old man in the boat in front of the fishing village .
during the performance he sets the active scene into the light : the hut of santiago , the bar of the singer , marie-luise gunst , the bar with her songs and her wonderful voice that makes life .
the four musicians play cuba &apos;s rhythm to this end and are also guests of the bar .
tourism : descent to the romans
at about 120 metres in length is below cologne a sewage channel from the roman period is preserved .
if you visit cologne , you will not pass the cathedral .
the town of kaprun is about 157 metres above sea level and makes it the second highest church in europe .
but few visitors who visit the two filigrees church towers are able to see the church &apos;s original appearance .
rainer schulze is an expert in the field of cologne underground .
meeting point for his guided tours is the service center of cologne tourism , right at the dom .
the tour starts in a very unspectacular way : &quot; we start in the underground garage &quot; , says schulze .
in the 1970s , the city &apos;s fathers wanted to build a car-fair city , and that is why the remains of the old city wall remained only what was not too big .
most users of the park are therefore also rushing to the roman remains .
but those who look more closely will find that the d2 parkdeck is covered by metal bars .
the exhibition is about five meters high , with ruins of handleg-sized stones .
&quot; there are remains of roman city wall that were built in the second half of the first century after christ .
before it returns to daylight , schooling leaves participants on the upper parking level even a look at a finsty , untouched , 15-metre deep shaft .
that is the fountain of the old cathedral , which unfortunately hardly is perceived .
the next stop of the tour is the prätorium , and here the participants descend down again into the depths .
we are witnessing the seat of the once most powerful man north of the alps , the pretor of the ccaa .
as for ccaa , it is important to know a visitor .
&quot; the abbreviation stands for &quot; colonia claudia ara agrippinensium &quot; , which means in good english as &quot; city of roman law and city of agrippine .
and at the prätorium , it is the former staatholder palace , the center of power of the roman empire on the rhine .
from the entrance hall of the exhibition , access to the roman sewage canal , which is located here at about 120 metres length .
&quot; you can relax a bit along the so-called cloaca maxima .
one surprise has schulze yet .
after he was at the cash desk picked the key , he leads the group to a 16 meter deep , walkable shaft .
&quot; we are now in the mikwe , a ritual jewish bath &quot; , he explains .
the jewish community built its bathroom deep into the ground to take part in the groundwater that was used for ritual washing .
to date , the lower end of the mikwe , whose origins date back to the eighth century , have been marked by varying levels of water in the rhine .
mikwe will be part of an archaeological zone on the town hall square , for which the construction work will begin shortly .
until completion , however , a few years will be left .
the leg is almost chopped : new edition of rocker process .
a bloody attack in the rockermileu will be carried out after more than four years .
a trial for attempted death , dangerous physical injury and damage to property against two 30-year-olds has taken place in the district court frankfurt ( oder ) .
it is accompanied by strict security measures .
the defendants remained silent for the start .
they are to be active in the rocker scene and at the time they were among the banddidos .
the public prosecutor accuses them of having been arrested in june 2009 , together with unknown accomplices in finowfurt , in a car .
all victims were seriously injured , a man almost lost his leg .
victims are to be brought to the competing faction of hells angels .
one is to be a high-level member from berlin .
the previous approach was apparently a persecution hunt with several cars .
the indictment was about the revierkampf and a demonstration of power .
the two defendants were in a first trial in early 2012 .
a court spokesman said at the time that it was impossible to prove that the men were in the bloody feud .
the perpetrators had masks worn and were not recognized .
the federal court of justice lifted the judgment after the review of the public prosecutor &apos;s office and retrieved it to the court .
one of the defendants is currently in prison for another offence in the open .
the first step was to focus on the reconstruction of the processes in the facts night .
as a witness , the then determined commissioner was charged .
the center focused on mobile phone calls from the defendants and other people who had left the police .
it is difficult for rockers to get to court almost always to get to a law that is not for them - and not to make statements .
this also applies to the victims .
in the first process , only one of the victims had been packed .
prosecutor stefan golfier of the public prosecutor &apos;s office frankfurt ( oder ) said on request that there were no new spheres since the last trial .
the process requires 11 more negotiating days .
the disposable company does not think of the disposable company as a whole .
the night was long , the music loud and the mood good , but eventually it goes home .
but in the trees of people on the front-passenger and rear seat , the hunger is noticeable .
of course , one or two cocktails or sekt may be responsible for this !
what could be more obvious than chilled to the next drive in ?
i admit that i am happy to be part of it when it is late at night or early in the morning .
a few pommes , a cola , a burger - and then nix like home and into bed !
but on the way home , the obvious differences between me and others are starving disco goers .
what is the point of a lack of constant regular maintenance of your fastfood products ?
especially on weekends there are scrapped paper bags .
&quot; why ? &quot; i wonder .
are people to doof to the bags with to home ?
it is not just that the paper industry is the landscape that is being squandered .
bags have also already used transport facilities such as guide planks and thus caused accidents .
what is this saying about &quot; disposable society &quot; but not after , presumably she does not even know what this word actually means .
if you are travelling more often in the evening , especially with several people in the car , you know how to get a backbench after celebrated nights : brackets , flyers and other things .
a few bags would be more or less naughty - in contrast to the street where nobody is on the food shelf of other rumps .
i can see the day when the council and the municipalities will be able to see the way through .
obama ’ s backsliding in health policy
after intense criticism , president obama made a backward move yesterday in his frequent , clear and unambiguous promise : “ if your health insurance is convenient , you can keep it . ”
after hundreds of thousands of people have been given a letter of notice from their insurer , republicans have accused the president of having been in the public domain in recent days .
yesterday , obama relatised his original promise .
“ the vast majority of citizens who want a functioning hospital insurance are not able to keep them , ” he said at a speech in boston .
in response to the numerous media reports on redundancies , obama called on those americans who received such communications to sign up to the free market after a new insurance policy .
most citizens could thus obtain a better , more comprehensive health insurance for the same price or cheaper than forecast .
“ you come to a better offer , ” he said .
the government called it little surprising that the us government has been able to retreat from the five percent of the population that have taken out insurance .
“ i want to tell these americans directly : they have earned better , ” said sebelius at a hearing in front of the energy and trade committee of the house of representatives in washington .
sebelius , who is responsible for the implementation of the affirmative care act , explained that the code &apos;s launch is not yet complete since october .
“ i am equally frustrated and angry as anyone else , ” she said .
i am determined to regain their confidence .
this is a statement of an excited sebelius to a man behind her sitting advisor at yesterday &apos;s hearing in the house of representatives , after a dispute with the republican member , mr billy long , from missouri .
after more than three hours of consultation , long sebelius repeatedly stressed the question of why the “ architect ” was not a member of the affirmative care act .
government in jerusalem confirms attack on syrian air force base not only on the syrian air force base , but also on the syrian air force base , not on the israeli air force base .
an american government official who was anonymous , said that he was not here on thursday .
the aim is to &apos; missiles and related equipment &apos; , of which the israeli government feared that the israeli government would be responsible for the lebanese hezbollah , hezbollah said it was &apos; .
syrian and lebanese media , as well as the arab channel al-arabiya , had previously reported that the port city of latakia in the night was closed from wednesday to thursday .
israeli television channel 2 is showing satellite images of the support base in the region of latakia , on which russian defenses were deployed in the s-125 newa type and a battery of sa-3 missiles .
uncertain of the government in jerusalem has not officially confirmed the attack .
however , the news agency reuters quotes an equally anonymous israeli government official with the words that he believes that the israeli state is carrying out the attack , but is not sure .
a speaker from the israeli ministry of defence said , &apos; we are not commenting on these reports &apos; .
the journalist ron ben-yishai stressed that the european union &apos;s role in the world &apos;s economic crisis was to be strengthened by the syrian regime earlier , partly successfully .
the israeli government has repeatedly warned that it would be impossible to ignore syria ’ s attempts to isolate hezbollah from chemical or other dangerous weapons .
john kerry explains in an unprecedented interview that the us government is not a good example of how to avoid the spy .
john kerry suggested with an unexpected admission that the us would be weakening the defensive stance of the us on the future of its surveillance programs , by imposing a “ new ” spying .
the foreign minister also admitted that he was wrong with barack obama to take responsibility for the fact that “ autopionte ” was switched on when the explosive nuclear escape was launched .
the leaked information makes the us government in a diplomatic process .
a video connection is required to use the open government website at the open government conference in london : “ without question , the president and i , as well as others in government , have learned of some of the things that are almost automatic .
he then became the first high-ranking member of the us government to admit that the us spy is a border that has been underlined , but also stressed that no rights are being abused .
he said : ‘ in some cases this is inappropriate too far ’ .
the president is determined to clarify matters and therefore introduces a thorough investigation , so that no one feels that the issue is being abused .
i assure you that the rights of innocent people in this process are not affected .
kerry , however , insisted that the nsa be a force of good , and that its surveillance processes save many lives .
he added : “ we are dealing with a new world . ”
there is a radical extremism in the world that has been obsessed with killing people .
so what if you are able to do what you want and to stop ?
we have actually seen aircraft crashes , attacks on buildings and the murder of people , because we were not able to prevent them in the run-up to such plans .
meanwhile , us legislators are going to europe to raise concerns about the alleged american espionage .
senator chris murphy from connecticut said he had been working with representatives of the european parliament and other people this week and was concerned about their threats to get involved in the debate because of frustration at national security .
“ it is very important for the national security interests of the us that europeans should be more consistent with our joint efforts against terrorism .
i also go to europe to make it clear that we are in the fight against terrorism and that we must continue to cooperate , regardless of their anger over the nsa programmes .
media reports that the nsa has collected millions of telephone data in europe have shown the relationship with some us allies .
other revelations cited from snowden ’ s continued documents , according to which the nsa had hired the mobile phone from chancellor angela merkel and up to 34 other heads of state around the world .
the head of the national intelligence services , james clapper , defended the espionage among allies as necessary , and said that this was common on both sides .
in all the turmoil , murphy said that his authority was preparing the congress ’ s journey , which will take place this year , and hoped that the delegation would be members of both parties and chambers .
the names of the other members who took part should be published in the coming days .
he said that the exact route will be extended .
while murphy stressed that the purpose of the trip was to improve relations , he also spoke of the need to avoid some “ serious words . ”
he said that european governments should be honest with their people about the kind of espionage programmes they themselves have been using for years .
“ although we can use our surveillance programs to change the rights of europeans , we need to change the way we monitor our security .
meanwhile , john kerry is on the weekend for a trip to the middle east and poland to meet there with the groll over the us administration ’ s strategy in syria , egypt , and iran , as well as the us surveillance activities .

australian appeals against prison sentences in thailand .
a 21-year-old woman from sydney who was born in phuket to 15 days in prison for falsely claiming that she was being taken by a taxi driver .
stevie rochelle bamford was first elected by a provincial court in phuket on june 15 .
later , however , the recordings of a video camera showed that she had safely reached her hotel after she was separated from her australian friend .
the police in phuket interrogated bamford for two days until they knew that the story had been thought out .
until the court was brought to justice , it was in police custody on the ground .
bamford became a 15-day prison camp for the former yugoslavia .
it is the daughter of peter tunks , a former player of the australian rubgy-league , who has been contacting the foreign ministry in canberra with the request for help for his daughter .
tunks declared to sunday telegraph that sydney was the only family to be “ extremely concerned ” about the welfare of his daughter .
“ we are , of course , very concerned , but we hope that you will return home as soon as possible , ” said tunks .
bamford has appealed against the judgment and is opposed to a deposit of 50,000 baht on free .
australian reports have said that they are in the meantime in the resort krabi in southern thailand .
the court has rightly said that basque democracy is being replaced by a local lawyer in phuket .
however , it is also possible that , following the recent assassination of the travel driver michelle smith in phuket , thailand will try to reconsider its beaten land .
