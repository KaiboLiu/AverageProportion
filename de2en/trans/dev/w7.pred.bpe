gu@@ t@@ ach : even more safety for pede@@ stri@@ ans
they are not 100 meters from each other : on tuesday , the new b 3@@ 3 pede@@ strian amp@@ li@@ fi@@ er at the village car park was put into operation - within sight of the older town hall lights .
two plants so close together : the intention or the tor@@ to@@ ise ?
this question was made clear to gu@@ ta@@ h &apos;s may@@ or yesterday .
&quot; the city hall temple was installed at the time because it sec@@ ures the school way &quot; , ec@@ ker@@ t explained yesterday .
the k@@ lu@@ ser@@ -@@ traffic lights secure both cy@@ cli@@ sts and bus passengers and the mountain inhabitants .
the plant officially put into operation yesterday was important for the sul@@ z@@ b@@ ach@@ we@@ g / kir@@ ch@@ stra@@ ß@@ e cros@@ s@@ roads .
we have the museum , two churches , kur@@ park , the bus stop , a doctor and a bank , as well as the traffic flow from the residential area › gru@@ b ‹ .
&quot; the high traffic and pede@@ strian population had to be accompanied by another traffic light for their safety , &quot; says ec@@ ker@@ t .
this is confirmed by peter ar@@ no@@ ld of the federal state council of off@@ enburg .
&quot; according to current measure@@ ments , the b 33 passes around 12 000 vehicles daily to the municip@@ ality of gu@@ ta@@ h , about 10 percent of which are heavy goods vehicles , &quot; says ar@@ no@@ ld .
therefore , the construction of another traffic light is more than necessary : &apos; safety is simply going ahead &apos; , says ar@@ no@@ ld .
in total , four traffic shows have been carried out , and a roun@@ d@@ about has also been planned , but due to the narrow road in the sul@@ z@@ b@@ ach@@ we@@ g / kir@@ ch@@ stra@@ ß@@ e crossing area .
according to ar@@ no@@ ld , the choice of location of the light ma@@ sts was tested be@@ fore@@ hand : &quot; by means of an extra for us with particularly long tim@@ ber tr@@ un@@ ks we have tested whether these vehicles are being taken out of the engine .
the approximately 15@@ ,000 euro expensive traffic lights are the &quot; most modern of them at present &quot; .
the system is equipped with col@@ oured le@@ ds that shine so strongly that the lights of the car drivers are illu@@ min@@ ated even in low sun .
and it is also th@@ ri@@ f@@ ty : the older lighting systems con@@ sume about 100 wat@@ ts , the new just eight wat@@ ts .
there are three light systems per direction .
ar@@ no@@ ld explained the technique of the new facility : this is equipped with two rad@@ ar sen@@ sors .
if the pede@@ strian pus@@ hes the traffic light button , the upper rad@@ ar sensor tests the traffic situation .
if the road is free , the pede@@ strian will be gre@@ e@@ ted directly by green if not , it will take about 15 seconds .
another rad@@ ar sensor checks whether the green phase for the pede@@ strian can be ended .
&quot; should a group or disabled people go over the street , the green phase will be extended , so everyone will be safe@@ ly on the road , &quot; explained ar@@ no@@ ld .
of course , drivers must be involved here as partners and observe the road .
this was not the case yesterday : the traffic lights for pede@@ stri@@ ans showed green , a cl@@ us@@ ter vehicle r@@ ash@@ ed through - at the bright red .
jo@@ se@@ f win@@ k@@ ler has been writing the p@@ light of his child@@ hood and youth for more than 30 years .
the disasters of his catho@@ lic village child@@ hood - the lack of language , the inc@@ lin@@ ation to raw violence and bl@@ un@@ t sex@@ u@@ ality , the close and jo@@ y@@ less - have left the car@@ in@@ th@@ ian po@@ et many things .
the b@@ ü@@ ch@@ ner prize winner is known primarily as a pro@@ sa@@ -@@ author , theatre texts are in his work ra@@ r .

the theat@@ er@@ mach@@ er combines elements from the auto@@ bio@@ graphical novel &quot; der le@@ i@@ gen@@ e &quot; ( 198@@ 7 ) with pro@@ sam@@ i@@ e@@ ren aus &quot; le@@ ich@@ nam , se@@ ine famili@@ e lau@@ er@@ lich &quot; ( 2003 ) .
on the largely empty stage - important requirements for the performance of a broken stage .
director fres@@ ach@@ er seems to have little confidence in the text .
the 7@@ 0-@@ minute performance is over@@ t@@ ones the template with a wealth of regime in@@ tru@@ sions , known from the reper@@ to@@ ire post@@ dram@@ ati@@ sch@@ er spi@@ el@@ sha@@ pes .
the ac@@ t@@ res@@ ses in particular come to the attention of the sometimes somewhat question@@ able scen@@ ic re@@ construc@@ tions .
they are hard att@@ acked , ex@@ ci@@ ted with their head under water , with their evening ro@@ bes ta@@ pped onto the wall .
the new z@@ el@@ lo@@ ph@@ an , st@@ ack , st@@ ack in dangerous high po@@ les , and st@@ ack them on the st@@ aging stage , either they mono@@ logi@@ ze lou@@ dly or lie completely silent on the stage floor .
the text is conve@@ yed in this rigor@@ ous manner .
the best moments are when sung - the band &apos;s range ran@@ ges from deep pur@@ ple to the big fol@@ k songs .
only towards the end is the over@@ turned performance a little quiet , and win@@ k@@ ler ’ s down@@ right absur@@ d hum@@ or b@@ lis@@ s up .
a black@@ box in the car ?
american road pl@@ ann@@ ers are looking for a source of money to compens@@ ate for the falling high@@ way system , and believe the solution in a small black box found .
the devices that run every kil@@ ome@@ tre of traffic and report the information to the authorities are the core of a controversial attempt by washington and the planning offices of the states to stop the ob@@ sole@@ te system for financing us american cars .
the usually rather bor@@ ing area of road planning suddenly has an intense debate with colour@@ ful al@@ li@@ ances .
liber@@ tari@@ ans have joined forces with environmental groups and are in favour of the government taking small boxes to record the hazar@@ dous kilometres – and possibly also the places where they were driven – and of dis@@ semin@@ ating information to calcul@@ ate them .
the tea party is app@@ alled .
the american civil rights association ( ac@@ l@@ u ) is also deeply concerned and expres@@ ses a number of data protection concerns .
but , while congress cannot agree on a course of action , several states no longer wait .
you are currently exam@@ ining how you can achieve a change over the next ten years to a system in which drivers pay per m@@ ile .
thousands of drivers have used the tac@@ ho@@ graph , some of which are equipped with g@@ ps monitoring , and have already tested it .
this is really a must for our country .
“ it is not something we will only possibly use , ” has@@ an i@@ kh@@ r@@ ata , ceo of southern california ’ s southern california , said .
the way in which we pay these taxes will change .
the technology is there .
the initiative comes at a time when the highway trust fund , which is financed from taxes , is being used to finance the americans at the fuel dispens@@ er , is bank@@ ru@@ pt .
but america no longer has as much fuel tan@@ k as it used to be .
cars use less petro@@ l .
the state oil tax of 18@@ .@@ 4 c@@ ents per gall@@ on ( less than 4 c@@ ents per lit@@ re ) has been down for 20 years .
politicians d@@ are not to tax even at a c@@ ents price , at high prices in terms of fuel .
“ the petro@@ l tax is simply not sustainable , ” says le@@ e mun@@ n@@ ich , an expert on transport legislation at the university of min@@ n@@ es@@ ot@@ a .
its state recently bought 500 tac@@ ho@@ graph@@ s , with which a me@@ g@@ ap@@ ix@@ -based pay@@ -@@ system could be tested .
“ this is the most sensible option in the long term , ” he said .
bureaucr@@ ats call it mil@@ est@@ -based user clock .
not surpris@@ ingly , the idea was popular with urban liber@@ als , because the tax could be used , for example , to change driving behaviour in such a way that cong@@ es@@ tion and emissions that are harmful to the climate are reduced .
california pl@@ ann@@ ers are rel@@ ying on the system for developing strategies to address the ambitious , legally an@@ cho@@ red aims of the state to combat climate change .
but republic@@ an bill sh@@ us@@ ter of pen@@ n@@ sy@@ l@@ v@@ ania , chairman of the house transportation committee , has also declared that the united states has not included the most viable long-term alternative .
the free marke@@ ters of the reason foundation also have the idea of sending drivers back to the country where they are going .
“ this is not a tax that dis@@ appears in a black hole , ” explains adri@@ an mo@@ ore , vice president of directives at reason .
people pay directly for what they get .
the movement is also supported by two former us transport ministers who , in a report in 2011 , asked congress to move in the direction of m@@ ile based b@@ illing .
the us sen@@ ate approved last year a $ 90 million co@@ stly pilot project , which includes 10@@ ,000 cars .
but the majority in the house of representatives prevented the move and respon@@ ded to the concerns of rural meps who had been representing people who were living in everyday life for many miles on the road to work or to the city .
several states and major cities are nevertheless moving in the direction of their own accor@@ d .
the most committed is o@@ reg@@ on , which currently has 5@@ ,000 drivers for the country ’ s largest experim@@ ent .
these drivers will soon be paying the mil@@ e@@ age fee instead of the oil tax to the state .
ne@@ v@@ ada has already completed a pilot project .
new york city is also considering one .
il@@ lin@@ o@@ is tests it to a limited extent with tr@@ uc@@ ks .
and the i-@@ 95 coalition , which the transport mini@@ stri@@ es of 17 states have joined on the east coast ( including mar@@ y@@ land , pen@@ n@@ sy@@ l@@ v@@ ania , vir@@ g@@ ini@@ a and fl@@ ori@@ da ) , is currently investig@@ ating the change .
the concept is not a universal hit .
in ne@@ v@@ ada , where recently 50 volunte@@ ers were equipped with the equipment , drivers were s@@ cep@@ tical about the idea that the government could track any of its movements .
“ objec@@ tions to big brother and such things were a big problem , ” says al@@ aud@@ din kh@@ an , head of the strategy and result management in the department of transport of ne@@ v@@ ada .
people did not want it .
when the test was started , the ac@@ l@@ u war@@ ned ne@@ v@@ ada on its website : “ it would be relatively easy to find the tac@@ ho@@ graph in full-@@ grown surveillance devices . ”
there is no need to build a giant , bul@@ ky technological infrastructure that could inevitably lead to the creation of new jobs .
ne@@ v@@ ada is a state in the middle east , which is now looking for affordable technology that will allow the state to cross the a@@ eri@@ al kilometres , but not when and where .
in order to do so , kh@@ an said , the public would also be more reas@@ su@@ red .
the hun@@ t for this technology has led some authorities to a small star@@ tup company called true mil@@ e@@ age in california .
the company was not originally established to assist states in tax@@ ing drivers .
rather , their aim was to create a new market for motor insurance , which would have been a great opportunity for drivers to compete on the basis of the miles they had already earned .
but the devices it tests are also useful for road pl@@ ann@@ ers , because they do not work with g@@ ps and provide only limited information that is regularly up@@ loaded via mode@@ m .
“ people are more willing to participate when their speed and location are not recorded . ”
some of these public pilot programmes have made major mistakes .
there are much cheaper and less in@@ tru@@ sive ways to do this .
experim@@ enting with the plan@@ ner in o@@ reg@@ on , they try to find a number of options for the car driver .
you can register for a device with or without g@@ ps .
or you don &apos;t even select any device and instead pay a flat rate based on the average of all the inhabitants of the state .
others hope to change the concept of a susp@@ icious public by dis@@ connecting devices with more functions .
in new york city , transport officials want to develop a tax device that can also be used to pay parking fees , to take insurance only for dangerous kilometres , and to obtain speed data from other vehicles in real time , thanks to which traffic is allowed .
“ the added value of the benefits that the system offers would encourage drivers to participate , ” says in a plan report .
some transport pl@@ ann@@ ers , however , wonder whether all the talk about paying per m@@ ile is not just a huge di@@ version .
the metro@@ politan transportation commission for the area of san francis@@ co , spain has declared that officials who are not members of the congress can solve the problem of the bank@@ ru@@ pt highway trust fund simply by increasing fuel tax .
an additional one-@@ time fee or annual fee could be imposed on drivers with hy@@ bri@@ d vehicles or other vehicles that use little petro@@ l .
“ there is no reason for an operation when an asp@@ ir@@ in is sufficient , ” explains r@@ and@@ y r@@ ent@@ sch@@ ler , the head of the commission ’ s legislation and public affairs .
if we do , hundreds of millions of mo@@ tori@@ sts are concerned about their privacy and many other things .
kö@@ ni@@ gs@@ fel@@ d : small team w@@ ack@@ er be@@ ats w@@ ack@@ er , w@@ ack@@ er , the team , but w@@ ack@@ er is not sure who will be the best .
the voluntary fire bri@@ g@@ ade has managed its autumn main test despite a lack of sta@@ ff@@ ing .
only 11 men participated in the exercise .
h@@ ans k@@ amer@@ er , comm@@ ander of the department , had taken the practice to the house of fea@@ der in bur@@ g@@ ber@@ ger stra@@ ß@@ e .
a short circuit should be created during sa@@ wing .
the resulting fire and the development of smo@@ ke in@@ ju@@ red two people , but one of them could still send a call .
two bre@@ a@@ thing protection carri@@ ers of the armed forces made themselves aware of the situation after the first review by h@@ ans kam@@ mer@@ er .
after a short time , the first person could be found and lead to the outside .
the second person had to be wor@@ n .
this was not so easy , as a narrow sta@@ ir@@ way was also to be overcome .
the building , a workshop with integrated stab@@ les for two horses , was not easy to secure .
it was a place where there was a lot of wood and also bar@@ r@@ acks .
there were also electric machines for wo@@ od@@ working .
the first ext@@ ingu@@ ishing attack was carried out by the tan@@ k in the vehicle .
another line was built by a hy@@ dr@@ ant in about 100 meters from the floor .
now three ran@@ dom attacks could be made .
the building also used a ho@@ o@@ ded tube .
h@@ ans kam@@ me@@ rer also worked to show that the project was not available .
in case of emergency , support is provided via the day operations group kö@@ ni@@ gs@@ fel@@ d .
the comm@@ ander was dis@@ missed by the exercise .
net@@ working of universities and companies important
during his visit to the district of bre@@ is@@ ga@@ u / ho@@ ch@@ sch@@ war@@ z@@ wal@@ d , president gui@@ do wol@@ f of the country , also explained to ti@@ ti@@ see neu@@ stadt where the workers of tomorrow come from .
in the fo@@ er@@ der@@ z@@ entr@@ um ho@@ ch@@ sch@@ war@@ z@@ wal@@ d , he went to the university of applied sciences and the district gy@@ m@@ na@@ si@@ um and the chairman of the advisory board for paren@@ tal leave to deal with this important issue .
&quot; education is an important factor in the location &quot; , cla@@ u@@ dia ste@@ l@@ le pointed out , director of the han@@ s-@@ th@@ om@@ a school , which is the net@@ worked school project education centre in the high black forest .
wol@@ f was impres@@ sed by the model projects for training .
since 2011 , a successful cooperation exists in the w@@ under@@ er@@ stadt between the fo@@ er@@ der@@ z@@ entr@@ um , kre@@ is@@ gy@@ m@@ na@@ si@@ um and vocational school center .
he also p@@ raised the family-@@ friendly nature of the county .
&quot; it is important not only to have a look at the family phase , but also to have the phase of care for children and their families because of demographic change , &quot; wol@@ f said .
he also said that more and more people are looking after their rela@@ tives and care@@ rs .
&quot; without the support of employers , the resulting burden on employees can lead to an end to the employment relationship , &quot; said wol@@ f .
but no one could afford to lose skilled labor , he continued .
another particularly important factor is the net@@ working of universities and businesses .
&quot; for anyone who has already experienced the benefits of the region during his studies , with his acquired knowledge and skills , often remains in the hands of the regional economy , which contributes to strengthening the region , &quot; he said .
only if there are enough training places available can the skilled workers need to be met .
in his opinion , the location advantage of the district is its favourable location in the south-@@ west of germany , close to france and switzerland .
he also experienced a number of problems during his train journey from ti@@ ti@@ se@@ e-@@ neu@@ stadt to fre@@ i@@ burg , which has already been made for the development of local public transport .
&quot; continue to be persi@@ stent and ensure that the public se@@ am@@ less transport becomes better , &quot; he said to the presence of the local politicians present .

the natural stone wall , which is over 100 years old , is a front line of the old school yard to the church street , which is standing before the renov@@ ation , is to be added to the town &apos;s re@@ hab@@ ilitation plan .
in the days before the kil@@ big , the first work of the re@@ hab@@ ilitation of the front school yard was carried out with a small corner wall , for stabil@@ isation and sta@@ tic relief of the natural stone wall with bal@@ u@@ str@@ ade over a hundred years .
the next step , according to alexander mis@@ ok , is to be taken by the town council of br@@ ä@@ un@@ ling , to include the land@@ es@@ min@@ ale office in the planning and to develop a concept for the old wall .
the aim is to calcul@@ ate costs by experts who then submit the decision and definition of the further action to the local council .
a decision on this will probably be taken next year .
after the renov@@ ation , pav@@ ement and plan@@ ting of the old school yard within the two side w@@ ings of the 19@@ 12 school , the school must be re@@ constructed in the fores@@ ee@@ able future as a follow-up measure that would require re@@ hab@@ ilitation .
the historic , one hundred year old wall of the old school cour@@ ty@@ ard to the kir@@ ch@@ stra@@ ß@@ e is dominated by water and fro@@ st damage , as no dra@@ in@@ age is present .
deep cr@@ acks in single stones testi@@ fy to weather damage , but the wall is not currently in danger of collapse .
a firm wall is a pre@@ requisite for a school cour@@ ty@@ ard used by students , which is done by the current fix@@ ing work .
originally , the school yard was renovated even in 2008 / 2009 , but high un@@ scheduled expenditure was not a result of a shift .
an important word about the historic renov@@ ation of the school walls , which has already been used for film , is the national heritage office .
if you have any suggestions from this site , the city of bra@@ un@@ ling@@ en hopes to receive grants from the preser@@ vers of the monuments .
the students of the ele@@ mentary school of bra@@ un@@ ling@@ . they are now back in a well refurb@@ ished old school building with a new a@@ ula , and soon can use the old school cour@@ ty@@ ard .
ö@@ z@@ dem@@ ir wants to train jazz in stutt@@ gart .
the ongoing discussions about the future of music schools in bad@@ en-@@ w@@ ür@@ t@@ tem@@ berg have now also included ce@@ m ö@@ z@@ dem@@ ir , the federal chairman of the greens .
&quot; i think it is wrong to call into question ho@@ lis@@ tic training in the music college stutt@@ gart , &quot; said ö@@ z@@ dem@@ ir &apos;s &quot; stutt@@ gart news &quot; .
jazz and classical music are just some of the most important pieces of music at stutt@@ gart ’ s jazz location .
in this way , ö@@ z@@ dem@@ ir , who was chosen in stutt@@ gart as a fav@@ ou@@ ri@@ te for a direct mandate at the federal election on 22 september , is contradic@@ ting the green and red state government .
this forces the development of a new order of the five music schools in bas@@ el , w@@ ür@@ t@@ tem@@ berg , based on a expert study .
the programme is intended to include the study programme jazz and pop by the musi@@ k@@ ho@@ ch@@ sch@@ u@@ le stutt@@ gart , the musi@@ k@@ ho@@ ch@@ sch@@ u@@ le man@@ n@@ heim .
us border : &quot; super tunnel &quot; to drug s@@ mu@@ gg@@ ling discovered .
on the mex@@ ic@@ an border with the us , investig@@ ators have created a &quot; super tunnel &quot; to drug s@@ mu@@ gg@@ ling and have dec@@ om@@ mis@@ sion@@ ed it .
as the us customs authorities have said , the more than 500 metr@@ e tube between ti@@ ju@@ ana and san di@@ e@@ go was equipped with electricity , rail@@ road tracks and an air conditioning system .
three susp@@ ects have therefore been arrested , eight tonnes mari@@ ju@@ ana and almost 150 kg of co@@ ca@@ ine have been conf@@ is@@ c@@ ated .
the tunnel has not yet been used , according to the information .
&quot; these car@@ te@@ ls are st@@ up@@ id when they think they could move through under the rad@@ ar , &quot; said the att@@ or@@ ney general of the us district southern california .
i am sure that the du@@ ff@@ y , who is being sent to the drug gan@@ gs , will tell you that if you continue to build such tun@@ nels and try to use them , we will be making a huge waste of your dir@@ ty money .
both the us authorities and the mex@@ ic@@ an security forces are in a permanent struggle against the drug car@@ te@@ ls .
since 2006 , more than 7@@ 7@@ ,000 people have been killed in mexico in connection with drug crime .
constructed by experts
due to the complex equipment of the tunnel , the investig@@ ators assume that it is designed by architec@@ ts and engineers .
the track was equipped to have electr@@ ically operated cars .
on the mex@@ ic@@ an side , access is in a building 80 metres from the border .
according to the authorities , a lad@@ der is 20 meters deep into the tunnel entrance .
the tunnel has a cross-@@ section of 1.@@ 20 meters high and 90 cen@@ time@@ ters width .
it would have been a good way of encouraging illegal immigration to the us .
two of the susp@@ ects were arrested in connection with the co@@ ca@@ ine fund .
the third , a mex@@ ic@@ an , was sent@@ enced to death for se@@ ized mari@@ ju@@ ana .
all three face the threat of a life@@ -@@ long de@@ priv@@ ation as the highest pun@@ ishment for their freedom , as officials have said .
since 2006 , eight such tun@@ nels have been discovered , as the press conference in san di@@ e@@ go said .
but it is the first time that a tunnel like this has been found to have co@@ ca@@ ine .
co@@ ca@@ ine is usually produced in smaller quantities , not through tun@@ nels .
this shows the &quot; des@@ pair &quot; of drug gan@@ gs , whose traditional routes are now cut off , said bill sh@@ er@@ man of the drug search dest@@ ined de@@ a in san di@@ e@@ go .
they would do everything they could to get to the us .
no details have been made available on the de@@ tain@@ e@@ es , at least one being mex@@ ic@@ ans .
they must be pun@@ ished for up to ten years .
in 20@@ 14 ge@@ is@@ inger will be celebr@@ ating the year of the year 20@@ 14
the anniversary of the town of ge@@ is@@ ingen on the occasion of the 12@@ 50 .
the first mention of the town is coming back .
if in just eight weeks the year ends , the anniversary year is appro@@ aching .
ge@@ is@@ ingen and kir@@ chen@@ -@@ haus@@ en were first docum@@ ented together in 7@@ 94 .
a document was produced in churches , in which both places are mentioned .
on 15 march , the ju@@ bil@@ ee festival will be officially launched , and ge@@ is@@ ingen is currently not a hall , so this opening event will take place in the place where 12@@ 50 years ago both were mentioned for the first time , in kir@@ chen@@ en .
in the context of the anniversary , several events are organized in both ge@@ is@@ ingen and kir@@ ch@@ en-@@ haus@@ en .
the church house will be held in july on a festival weekend from july 18th to 20th .
celebrate a return .
on friday , with a celebr@@ ation , on saturday and sunday with a festival around the church hall .
this festival weekend is also the church house of the church .
city music director ru@@ dol@@ f bar@@ th has written a book for the city on the occasion of the anniversary of the city , which is listed on three dates .
on june 21 , together with the black forest association &apos;s sunday proc@@ ession , on july 12 in the arena with fire@@ works and on december 13 as the first concert of city music in the new f@@ es@@ th@@ al@@ le .
this will be completed and in@@ aug@@ ur@@ ated in the year of celebr@@ ation , the official date is on the last weekend of september , 27 and 28 september .
on the occasion of the ge@@ is@@ inger city ju@@ bil@@ ee , a new chron@@ ic@@ le will be released .
&quot; but there should be a chron@@ ic@@ le not only of the mind itself , but also a printed work about the mind of today , which is precisely for reasons of ge@@ is@@ ingen , church houses , le@@ i@@ p@@ fer@@ d@@ ingen , au@@ la@@ u .
and today &apos;s min@@ d-@@ bo@@ gg@@ ling celebra@@ tes 20@@ 14 birth@@ day , 197@@ 4 the current space was filled with the comm@@ uni@@ tations .
the new chron@@ ic@@ le is due to be published on november 21 or 22 in the new fe@@ st@@ hal@@ le in ge@@ is@@ ingen .
however , 20@@ 14 is also a year with many ju@@ bil@@ ee .
the fo@@ ol guil@@ d stra@@ h@@ gl@@ on@@ ki starts on february 8 with a night of customs on the occasion of its 6@@ 0-@@ year existence , the harmony gu@@ t@@ mad@@ ingen will be 90 years and has on march 29 the festival ban@@ quet and .
the al@@ ten@@ wer@@ k le@@ i@@ p@@ fer@@ d@@ ingen is 40 years old , the ge@@ is@@ inger school has been in the new location for 50 years and celebra@@ tes it on 10 may , the musi@@ k@@ vere@@ in poly@@ hy@@ m@@ nia le@@ ip@@ fer@@ d@@ ingen celebra@@ tes it 150 years old and celebra@@ tes it .
the town of ge@@ is@@ ingen was given a gift certificate which was owned by the st. g@@ allen monaster@@ y in 7@@ 64 .
the document was published in churches ( haus@@ en ) , which was then a court .
both communities are thus mentioned in the same document .
the reason 20@@ 14 to celebrate this 12@@ 50 year old accordingly , in addition to this , is the community law of 40 years .
council targets track systems
should the railway crossing be &quot; on the h@@ ir@@ sch &quot; elabor@@ ately re@@ constructed in order to increase road safety ?
yes , the local counc@@ ils have decided .
sch@@ il@@ t@@ ach has to pay eur 2@@ 20 000 for this .
the deutsche bahn wants to reach the kin@@ zi@@ g@@ tal railway line in the coming year .
safety at railway cros@@ s@@ ings is particularly important - regularly there are col@@ li@@ sions of trains across germany with other vehicles .
do the communities agree to the restructuring measures , they must share with one third the costs , the rest share railways and the federal government .
sch@@ il@@ t@@ ach &apos;s city buil@@ der ro@@ land gri@@ e@@ ß@@ hab@@ er explained to the municip@@ al council the special features of the &quot; ba@@ h@@ transition &quot; on the h@@ ir@@ sch@@ en .
the city plans to build a new building in the height of the tun@@ nel@@ -@@ mouth to the west of the railway tracks .
there , larger vehicles , such as those trans@@ porting long wood , could also be at the back of the road without having to block the tracks .
gre@@ e@@ ks therefore proposed to build a necessary support wall in such a way that the city could take the road that followed in due course , to build a smo@@ o@@ thly flow of traffic .
this was controversial in the municip@@ al council , as some counc@@ ils stressed the need for road traffic distribution : thomas ki@@ p@@ p brought the mo@@ od of cri@@ tics to the point : &apos; do we have to be so much money in so few vehicles &apos; .
may@@ or thomas ha@@ as dis@@ agreed : the railway crossing &quot; h@@ ir@@ sch@@ en &quot; is used regularly for long-@@ wood transport .
even the &quot; ku@@ h@@ bach &quot; area is trans@@ ported partly over this route because the up to 20 meters long vehicles cross the line at the h@@ ä@@ ber@@ les@@ br@@ ü@@ c@@ ke , because they are not going to the main road .
the route also serves as a transfer for those vehicles that cross the tunnel .
it is to be expected that kir@@ ch@@ berg and sch@@ los@@ s@@ berg tun@@ nels will have to be re@@ built and renovated , as is currently the case in wol@@ f@@ gan@@ g , so the railway crossing &quot; am h@@ ir@@ sch@@ en &quot; could also be important for a longer .
the counc@@ ils agreed to examine the costs of the intended broad@@ ening of the road .
despite this , the restructuring of the railway transition was approved by a majority , with the pro@@ vis@@ o that the necessary support wall should be built in such a way that the city can take the road leading to &quot; ba@@ hn@@ ho@@ f@@ stras@@ se &quot; , possibly for encoun@@ ters around 5@@ km .
the re@@ organization of the railway crossing at the bar@@ ber@@ y tr@@ aut@@ we@@ in could , however , lead to a quite different problem , which could make access to the so@@ aring &quot; ro@@ l@@ t@@ z@@ h@@ ä@@ user we@@ g &quot; .
the administration had to re@@ build the railway from the engineering office bre@@ in@@ ling@@ er , as it had doubts about whether the planned connection of the ro@@ l@@ z@@ h@@ ä@@ user would then be possible without further ado .
the study concluded that it was not possible to exclu@@ de the possibility that the ti@@ lt conditions of the road could lead to longer vehicles being se@@ ated .
the city , in turn , bears responsibility for this as a road construction company .
the conversion could therefore resolve li@@ abilities .
since both the lo@@ gging and ben@@ ding of the current construction state worked , the first step is to follow the re@@ building of the railway transition , which is why ha@@ as argu@@ ed .
at this point , we should also mention the risk of a col@@ li@@ sion of the train with a vehicle standing on the transition route much less than the other railway cros@@ s@@ ings , because the stop is right next to it , where there is a good visual connection .
even trains from the main railway station would have to be bra@@ ked to the extent that there is no danger of col@@ li@@ sion .
most of the buildings were dedicated to the reconstruction of this railway crossing , as the city of sch@@ il@@ t@@ ach has not solved the problem of sitting cars , according to the counc@@ ils , since the railway had changed after the construction had finished .
the board considers the re@@ construc@@ tions at the cros@@ s@@ ings &quot; before heu@@ bach &quot; and &quot; before ku@@ h@@ bach &quot; as un@@ proble@@ matic , for which already cross-@@ country agreements have been concluded with the railway .
es@@ a deci@@ des on major space missions : missions for bil@@ lions of euros , and missions for bil@@ lions of dollars , and missions for bil@@ lions of dollars .
remote plan@@ ets , gra@@ vit@@ ational waves or black ho@@ les - experts from the european space agency must now focus on two major projects , which they will be able to launch in the next few years .
30 proposals were on the table , five are still in the race .
remote worl@@ ds .
more than 1000 plan@@ ets in other stars have already found a@@ stronom@@ ers .
whether or not there are at least some of them .
the choice is difficult : should one look for gra@@ vit@@ ational waves ?
or rather , explore the origin of the co@@ smo@@ s ?
or to earth like plan@@ ets , and perhaps ali@@ en life to discover ?
these are the questions which the people responsible for the european space agency es@@ a are asking .
for your co@@ sm@@ ic vision program , you are looking for ideas for two major space projects that will make decisive progress in research .
the budget for these &apos; l missions &apos; is about eur 1 billion each .
the launch is expected to be in 20@@ 28 and 20@@ 34 .
in early september , the elite of the european space research community met in paris to discuss proposals for such missions .
thir@@ ty ideas were on the table , five of which have now come to a close .
many bodies are exam@@ ining the proposals to remove barriers among researchers .
a final decision by the scientific code of programmes is due to be taken in the next few days .
in total , es@@ a has selected four major questions to which the missions of the co@@ sm@@ ic vision programme , which was launched in 2007 , are to be answered .
what are the conditions for the emerg@@ ence of plan@@ ets and life ?
the exact processes involved in the creation of stars from large gas cl@@ ou@@ ds - and thus the emerg@@ ence of plan@@ ets that en@@ cir@@ cle@@ ment these stars - are still in the pro@@ ver@@ bi@@ al dark .
a large infra@@ red tel@@ es@@ cope in space could break this dark .
and if a star has a planet , what circumstances can life arise there ?
to address this issue , the space tel@@ es@@ cope &quot; chem@@ op@@ s &quot; is to be launched in 20@@ 17 , with 500 already known plan@@ etary systems in our vicinity .
the possibilities are limited , but che@@ ops is a small mission with a budget of eur 150 million .
with larger instruments , a@@ stronom@@ ers could map earth similar plan@@ ets , and even analy@@ ze the composition of their atmo@@ sp@@ he@@ res , thus searching for &quot; bi@@ om@@ ar@@ kers &quot; : g@@ ases that are considered an indic@@ ator of biological activity .
how does the solar system work ?
this question , too , should ultimately be clari@@ fied as to what conditions there are for the birth of life .
magne@@ si@@ um is a type of star which is used to treat the sun &apos;s sun &apos;s ra@@ ys .
in our solar system these processes can be ex@@ em@@ pl@@ ary .
the &quot; solar or@@ bi@@ ter &quot; has already been a mission of the m-@@ class ( where the budget is about half a billion euros ) .
the pro@@ be is to start in 20@@ 17 and observe the surface and activity of the sun .
of great interest to the researchers are j@@ up@@ i@@ ter and his mo@@ ons .
they want to find out what role the giant planet plays in the development of the solar system .
the es@@ a sees the first of the three l missions of the &quot; co@@ sm@@ ic vision &quot; programme .
the &quot; ju@@ ice &quot; ( j@@ up@@ i@@ ter ic@@ y mo@@ ons explorer ) starts your journey probably in 20@@ 22 .
eight years later , j@@ up@@ i@@ ter was assigned to the planet &apos;s atmosphere and the ic@@ y mon@@ de of europe , k@@ all@@ is@@ to and g@@ any@@ med .
what are the basic physical laws of the universe ?
space offers many possibilities to explore matter in extreme conditions and to learn how to make the most of the natural laws we know there .
perhaps there are also vari@@ ations that could pa@@ ve the way for physi@@ ci@@ sts to develop a new theory under which all known laws of nature can be united .
how did the universe come about and what is it made of ?
the company was founded by the ur@@ k@@ n@@ all 13@@ .@@ 7 billion years ago .
in addition to the matter we are familiar with , from the stars , plan@@ ets and living beings as we exist , there are dark matter whose gra@@ vity gal@@ ax@@ ies and gal@@ ax@@ ies are clu@@ sters .
so far , researchers have not known what physical laws were applied in the first fr@@ ac@@ ture of the big ban@@ g , nor what the dark , un@@ clear matter and dark matter were .
with &quot; eu@@ c@@ li@@ d &quot; , the es@@ a has already approved a m mission , which is scheduled to start in 2020 .
with a special tel@@ es@@ cope , the pro@@ be is intended to determine the distribution of the matter in the universe for the first time , thus drawing conclusions on the nature of dark matter and dark matter .
if you could race
of the 30 proposals , only two will be left at the end of the selection process .
the best chan@@ ces of being awarded as an l mission are , according to many experts , &quot; e-@@ lis@@ a &quot; , a sophisticated concept for detec@@ ting gra@@ vit@@ ational waves .
this includes physi@@ ci@@ sts ’ changes in the structure of space time , which al@@ bert e@@ inste@@ in predic@@ ted nearly 100 years ago .
they have not been proven to date .
el@@ is@@ a could do that , the scientists hope behind the project .
the mission sees one of two or three prob@@ es existing detec@@ tors , which is deplo@@ yed in space .
it could be used as a gra@@ vit@@ ational sha@@ ft , unlike plants on earth , which were created at the big ban@@ g , and thus generate new knowledge about the emerg@@ ence of the co@@ smo@@ s .
four other proposals are still compe@@ ting for the second l mission : a large x-@@ ray set called &quot; ath@@ ena &quot; , which is black and white .
already out@@ dated are among other proposals for the re@@ trac@@ table transport of mar@@ s , for the expl@@ or@@ ation of moon , ven@@ us and aster@@ o@@ ids , and for solar physi@@ cs .
snow@@ den ready to compete with germany in terms of us surveillance .
ed@@ ward snow@@ den , the wh@@ ist@@ le@@ b@@ lower of the us intelligence service , has declared that he is ready to travel to berlin and to appear before the german bun@@ de@@ sta@@ g when the american national security agency and its national security agency are closed .
the german member , han@@ s-@@ christian str@@ ö@@ be@@ le , met snow@@ den in russia on thursday , where this asylum was obtained to justify the statement in germany .
in a letter from snow@@ den , which was published on friday by str@@ ö@@ be@@ le to the media in berlin , he wri@@ tes : “ although the outcome of my efforts was demonstr@@ ably positive , my government is still tre@@ ating a dis@@ sent as a dis@@ sent .
but telling the truth is not a crime .
in the letter , snow@@ den wri@@ tes that he is convinced that support from the international community will convince the american government to stop the charge against him .
the investigation by the us department of justice includes es@@ pi@@ on@@ age and the@@ ft of state property .
german interior minister han@@ s-@@ peter fried@@ rich said to time online : “ if mr snow@@ den is prepared to meet with german representatives , then we will find ways to make this possible . ”
us@@ -@@ germany relations have been damaged by the alleg@@ ations made by the n@@ sa that they have banned chancell@@ or ang@@ ela mer@@ kel &apos;s mobile phone .
thomas op@@ per@@ mann , the member who has been the head of the parliamentary committee responsible for the secret services , said that we should take the opportunity to listen to snow@@ den if possible , ‘ without him ’ .
str@@ ö@@ be@@ le , a member of the greens , published an image of himself and snow@@ den in his t@@ wit@@ ter feed .
he was arrested by two german journalists when he visited russia .
str@@ ö@@ be@@ le explained that according to the law@@ yer of former n@@ sa employee snow@@ den did not return to russia if he wanted to leave the country .
if snow@@ den in germany says , then he needs an assurance that he will be “ safe ” there , he says .
snow@@ den explains in his letter that he is committed to a “ serious and ongoing ” campaign of persecu@@ tion that has driven him from his home country .
however , it is touched by the global response to “ my act of political expression . ”
citizens around the world , as well as high-@@ level politicians – including in the united states – have been watching the rev@@ el@@ ations about an un@@ controlled system of comprehensive surveillance as a credit to the general public .
in his letter , snow@@ den makes the german authorities an offer of cooperation , “ if the difficulties surrounding the humanitarian situation have been resolved . ”
fronti@@ er airlines charges for hand bag@@ gage and bag@@ gage that is not included in the ticket price .
fronti@@ er airlines plans to invest up to 100 u.s. dollars to passengers who are on their flight with their hand bag@@ gage .
fronti@@ er airlines intends to invest up to usd 100 for a piece of hand bag@@ gage and $ 2 for coffee or lim@@ on@@ ade , even if the announcement on wednesday stated that it was not necessary to carry passengers the whole se .
the new fee applies to hand bag@@ gage in the luggage com@@ part@@ ment above the seat , small bags under the seat are still free .
fronti@@ er explained that you calcul@@ ate 25 u.s. dollars if the fee is paid in advance , and 100 u.s. dollars to travellers who arrive at the gate .
fron@@ t@@ line speaker k@@ ate o &apos;@@ mal@@ ley said the fee of $ 100 targets to help travel@@ ers who are in the run@@ -up to paying .
“ we don ’ t want to calcul@@ ate this amount , ” she explained .
airlines began to pay for the first and second checked bag@@ gage in 2008 .
passengers who tried to by@@ pass them therefore have as much as possible in their hand bag@@ gage .
charges are one way of encouraging passengers to take less with them .
o &apos;@@ mal@@ ley said at the new charge it is not really about making money .
it is about the most loy@@ al customers of fronti@@ er who would have made it clear that it is becoming increasingly difficult to find space in the field above the seat .
passengers who have purchased their tickets on the airline website do not have to pay .
this means that a passenger on the platform of fronti@@ er may have to carry one piece of bag@@ gage for free , but the next person will need to pay $ 100 for a similar piece of bag@@ gage .
o &apos;@@ mal@@ ley explained that the website of fronti@@ er and the check-in procedures would be changed so that passengers can be informed of the charge before they arrive at the gate .
the new bag@@ gage handling fee from fronti@@ er will only enter into force in the summer , and there is no exact date yet .
passengers often compla@@ in about bag@@ gage allow@@ ances and other charges , but airlines are happy to take them back .
they argue that the transportation of bag@@ gage is money and passengers this service should pay if they are willing to .
many on wall street consider the new bag@@ gage charges to be a sign that airlines are taking enough money to pay for the cost of air travel after years of losses .
most of them have so far been able to put their fing@@ ers on the spot for hand bag@@ gage charges .
spirit airlines inc@@ . demanded a new aircraft charter three years ago .
the only airline with such a charge is the hungarian wi@@ z@@ z air , explained the airline advis@@ er j@@ ay so@@ ren@@ sen , who has paid the additional charges atten@@ tively .
in a report of december 2011 , he estimated that the hand bag@@ gage charge to spirit could bring in usd 50 million a year .
so@@ ren@@ sen , who used to be a leader in mid@@ west airlines , has become a member of spirit recently .
“ the boarding process was one of the most smooth , i could not fail to notice in my career in aviation ” , said he .
i expected to te@@ ar te@@ eth and hand@@ y discussions at the gate .
“ the plane was full , ” he explained , “ and boarding was running like lu@@ br@@ ic@@ ated . ”
fronti@@ er also follows spirit on the $ 2 that is set for coffee , tea , le@@ mon@@ ade or ju@@ ice .
the company explained that passengers who use le@@ mon@@ ade or ju@@ ice would have to keep the whole can and make coffee free of charge .
water is still free .
us air@@ ways had recently attemp@@ ted to provide a re@@ fund for soft drinks in 2008 , but made it back seven months later after the airline passengers had compla@@ ined and had not received any other major company .
fronti@@ ers step , fees for hand bag@@ gage to collect if passengers are not directly in the airline , is the recent initiative to deal with customers on their own website .
airlines pay online travel agencies such as or@@ bit@@ z 10 to 25 us dollars per ticket sold .
this will give all companies an incentive to buy passengers directly from them rather than using an online travel agency .
fronti@@ er is , however , the most far-@@ reaching in this area .
in september , the company started to offer only one half as many more frequent fl@@ yer miles when booking via an online travel agency .
on wednesday , miles were re@@ de@@ mp@@ ted to 25 percent of the route .
a booking made with a third party service provider with fronti@@ er over 1000 miles will therefore only bring customers 250 miles .
passengers can also be registered only when they buy directly on the fronti@@ er website .
fronti@@ er has a loy@@ al customer base at its headquarters in den@@ ver , but the business is shr@@ in@@ king and the company lo@@ ses money .
the proce@@ eds were down by 9 % and flight capacity was down by just 13 % in the first quarter , as the financial report says , which was published on wednesday by the parent company , republic@@ a air@@ ways .
republic@@ s has tried to make the financial aspects of fronti@@ er &apos;s business accessible as part of the company &apos;s sales .
pro@@ ver@@ bs come from the bi@@ ble
about 40 women attended the last women ’ s breakfast this year in the ev@@ angel@@ ical church in b@@ is@@ ingen .
theme of the day in the municip@@ al house were &quot; pro@@ ver@@ bs from the bi@@ ble &quot; and &quot; expres@@ sions from the middle ages &quot; .
z@@ ita kö@@ h@@ ler , the chairman of the church council , went to a lec@@ ture after breakfast on the bi@@ b@@ lic@@ al pro@@ ver@@ bs .
&quot; pro@@ ver@@ bs contain life@@ -@@ wis@@ dom , regulations or war@@ nings , &quot; she explained .
they compared several pro@@ ver@@ bs with the corresponding bi@@ ble points and explained the meaning .
she called pro@@ ver@@ bs such as : ti@@ lt f@@ ence is al@@ ert , how d@@ and@@ ru@@ ff falls from the eyes , a eye on someone who gives his is the lord in sleep , his hands wash@@ ed in inno@@ c@@ ence .
on several occasions , the speaker advis@@ ed their list@@ en@@ ers to what pro@@ ver@@ b it was .
the medieval words were taken by the church community counc@@ ill@@ or christ@@ el stret@@ cher .
she explained the meaning and origin of the phr@@ ases she used to call &quot; brid@@ ges into the past &quot; .
a ra@@ ff@@ le was ra@@ ff@@ led .
the prices were covered on a table and hum@@ or@@ ously re@@ wrote before they were sent to the winners .
among the visitors of the breakfast round , may@@ or ro@@ man wat@@ son also mixed up .
learning instead of unemployed : pilot project for un@@ skilled people in tourism
at the mec@@ k@@ len@@ bur@@ g@@ is@@ che se@@ en@@ plat@@ te , a pilot project for the tourism industry started .
under the leadership of the german federal employment agency , 49 men and women who have already been working as un@@ skilled in the industry are to become experts in hotels and restaurants for three winter months .
&quot; what is new is that the six@@ -@@ month courses will end with degrees , &quot; said car@@ men wi@@ ec@@ her@@ t from the employment agency neu@@ brand@@ enburg .
the benefits are varied : participants would not be unemployed , firms would be trained , and the workers who would be increasingly employed in hotels and restaurants would be forced to pay for the agency .
the project also includes the chamber of commerce and industry in neu@@ brand@@ enburg and the german hotel and restaurant association ( de@@ ho@@ ga ) me@@ k@@ len@@ bur@@ g-@@ vor@@ po@@ m@@ mer@@ n .
n@@ sa decla@@ res that an “ internal error ” and not h@@ ack@@ ers are to blame for the cr@@ ash of the site ’ s cr@@ ash .
the sh@@ ad@@ ow@@ y national security agency declared on late friday that a bug has caused your public website to par@@ aly@@ se a few hours and not h@@ ack@@ ers , as was claimed online .
“ n@@ sa@@ .@@ go@@ v was not reach@@ able for a few hours this night , because during a planned update an internal error occurred ” , explains the sp@@ y agency in a post e-mail .
the problem will be fixed this evening .
the claim that the failure was caused by a distributed den@@ ial of service attack ( d@@ dos ) was not known .
in the early evening , online server tr@@ ack@@ ers were noticed that the n@@ sa website had been running for at least six hours and this was not available to some users .
previously , a n@@ sa spo@@ kes@@ man said to ab@@ c news that the authority ’ s sensitive internal network was “ in no way ” com@@ promised .
secret information is not at risk , according to the speaker .
at least one group of h@@ ack@@ -@@ activi@@ sts claimed to have been using the n@@ sa website with a d@@ dos attack .
in the event of such attacks , the target site is floo@@ ded with page views until the servers are over@@ loaded and the site collap@@ ses .
cy@@ ber@@ tac@@ tics are relatively simple and attacks do not serve to inter@@ f@@ ere in the internal network of the target system .
the former super@@ secret n@@ sa , whose n@@ ick@@ name once was no such agency , was the first to be found in the bright light of the public and is looking for the new rules that have been made known in recent months .
the growing contro@@ vers@@ y surrounding the secret service fu@@ elled initial spec@@ ulation that the incident today was the result of a targeted cy@@ per@@ -@@ operation .
the number of people without jobs has fallen by 22 % to 1,@@ 30@@ 7 in october .
although the 3.@@ 1 % quota was better than last year , it was better than in september , &quot; but we would have hoped more , &quot; mon@@ i@@ ka fel@@ der bau@@ er says , depu@@ ty head of business at the agency .
many companies have re@@ acted to recru@@ it@@ ment .
one reason is , according to fel@@ der bau@@ er , &quot; we have hardly any skilled workers in the craft , health and care of the elderly &quot; .
the new version of the new version of the website is available in german only .
in the middle of december the winter season begins .

loss of profit in bom@@ bar@@ di@@ er after falling delivery figures and orders for the company .
the can@@ a@@ dian aircraft and railway manufacturer bom@@ bar@@ di@@ er inc reported a 15@@ -@@ percent increase in sales on thursday .
bom@@ bar@@ di@@ er , based in mon@@ tre@@ al , did not publish flight test data for his brand new c@@ series aircraft , and did not give any new information about whether the aircraft is being operated according to the ambitious schedule in september next year .
the aircraft will be delivered to the ma@@ ide@@ n flight of the test aircraft a month and a half ago , and this makes it doub@@ t@@ ful whether the test phase will be carried out as planned .
the results were below the forec@@ asts and led to a fall in the price of more than eight percent of the tor@@ onto stock exchange .
camer@@ on do@@ er@@ k@@ sen , analy@@ st at national bank financial , lo@@ wered his rating on thursday of “ out@@ perform ” to “ sector perform ” with a view to the fact that the share will be one to two quarters one in the next .
“ weak@@ er delivery figures for aircraft have been expected to the greatest extent possible , but the mar@@ gin in transport has clearly been disappointed by the development of the transport sector , ” said do@@ er@@ k@@ sen in a letter to the customer .
we believe that bom@@ bar@@ di@@ er should place new orders for the c@@ series if the test program for the aircraft is progres@@ sing .
but if no new orders are announced in the coming months , we expect the market to be more s@@ cep@@ tical about the program .
bom@@ bar@@ di@@ er hopes that the c@@ ser@@ ies will be able to integrate the company into the lower market segment .
the first test aircraft was presented to the public in march and , after months of delay , fle@@ w for the first time in september .
but , so far , binding orders for the c@@ series are moderate with 17@@ 7 , as potential bu@@ yers are waiting for the results of the flight tests and want to see if the company &apos;s claims regarding fuel efficiency and cost savings potential of the new jet are accurate .
there are currently a total of 4@@ 03 orders and commitments from 15 customers and companies .
ceo pi@@ er@@ re beau@@ do@@ in is confident that bom@@ bar@@ di@@ er will achieve his goal of 300 binding orders at the beginning of commercial use of the jet .
on thursday , the management assured analy@@ sts and media that the program was in the schedule .
“ the test aircraft has no longer been on the ground than expected , ” said beau@@ do@@ in at a telephone conference , adding that during the service life of the aircraft ground tests and software updates were scheduled .
each manufacturer plans differently .
we decided to take a first flight and then to open a period of review , which we have done .
this is happening throughout the flight programme .
the second of five test aircraft is expected to start in the next few weeks , the remaining shortly afterwards , it was said from the company side .
yet analy@@ sts remain s@@ cep@@ tical about whether 12 months after the ma@@ ide@@ n flight the first customer could take a c@@ series aircraft into service .
bom@@ bar@@ di@@ er explained that it is checking the star@@ t-@@ up planning and will be able to use it in the coming months .
“ the slow progress of the flight test – even though it appears to be bom@@ bar@@ di@@ er ’ s internal planning – rein@@ forces our view that commission@@ ing should be extended to the first quarter of 20@@ 15 , ” said do@@ er@@ k@@ ke .
in the third quarter , at the end of september 30 , bom@@ bar@@ di@@ ers ’ net profit fell to $ 14@@ 7 million , or $ 8 c@@ ents per share , from $ 17@@ 2 million , or $ 9 c@@ ents per share a year earlier .
the adjusted ear@@ nings per share is un@@ changed 9 c@@ ents .
sales slightly increased and decreas@@ ed from 4.@@ 2 to 4.@@ 4 % .
analy@@ sts had a profit of 10 c@@ ents per share and a tur@@ nover of $ 4.@@ 56 billion , according to th@@ om@@ son re@@ u@@ ters i / b / e / s .
the world &apos;s fourth largest aircraft manufacturer claims that it had lost 45 aircraft this quarter , a decline of 57 in the last year .
net orders fell from 8@@ 3 aircraft to 26 .
the order book in the aero@@ space division was € 3@@ 2.@@ 9 billion on september 30 , making it a relatively stable € 3@@ 2.@@ 9 billion compared to december 31 .
“ in the aero@@ space sector , the results were within the framework of our specifications , but the low in@@ take of orders and market relations as a whole were dis@@ appoin@@ ting , ” said beau@@ do@@ in .
sales in the aero@@ space division fell by 13 percent to two billion dollars .
bom@@ bar@@ di@@ er , the world &apos;s largest railway manufacturer , announced that sales in this segment increased by almost 11 percent to $ 2.@@ 1 billion .
the order book in the transport segment was 3@@ 2.@@ 6 billion dollars on september 30 , and was thus slightly higher than 31 december .
the transport profit mar@@ gin was determined by handling problems in some major contracts .
according to the management of the company , new targets will be set for the fourth quarter .
in the after@@ no@@ ons trading on thursday , the bom@@ bar@@ di@@ er share dec@@ lined by 8.@@ 5 percent and stood at 4.@@ 8@@ 3 can@@ a@@ dian dollars , after it was also announced that the google financial board pat@@ ric@@ k pic@@ he@@ tte was in .
the braz@@ ili@@ an em@@ bra@@ er sa , the world &apos;s third largest commercial aircraft manufacturer and bom@@ bar@@ di@@ ers of the eng@@ ster ri@@ val , reported a 10 % decline in the quar@@ ter@@ ly profit on thursday .
usa : sho@@ ts at los angel@@ es airport
an unknown person has a chance to visit the town of la@@ x on friday morning ( local time ) .
while the airport management is using t@@ wit@@ ter , the t@@ wit@@ ter short message service tells us that the s@@ ag@@ it@@ tari@@ an is in cust@@ o@@ dy , the los angel@@ es times reported that the man was dead .
a security man has also been killed .
media also reported several in@@ jur@@ ies .
us president bar@@ ack obama will be kept constantly informed of the situation , said the white house spo@@ kes@@ man , j@@ ay car@@ ney .
the incident occurred in terminal 3 e@@ ye@@ wit@@ nesses claimed to have a sho@@ o@@ ter with a gun in one of the departure h@@ alls , as several media reported .
a travell@@ er told the trans@@ mit@@ ter c@@ n@@ n that many people had been looking for protection in pan@@ ic .
travellers could have cri@@ ed and children we@@ pt .
among the waiting , pan@@ ic er@@ up@@ ted , many would have been hi@@ ding behind chairs for fear .
he heard two sho@@ ts , says a travell@@ er of the &quot; los angel@@ es times &quot; .
a security officer in the t@@ sa has in@@ ju@@ red a shot at the foot .
the scene is &quot; like in a movie &quot; .
after that he was brought to a security area himself , the man reported .
the sho@@ ts should have fallen close to a safety control area .
airport buildings ev@@ ac@@ u@@ ated
on television pictures , it was seen how many am@@ bu@@ lan@@ ces and police cars were moving before a terminal .
hundreds of people were brought to safety from the building .
users on t@@ wit@@ ter published photos of a special operation command and a ri@@ f@@ le lying on the ground .
as the airport management informed via t@@ wit@@ ter , the incident began at 9.@@ 30 a.m. ( local time ) .
the access roads were bloc@@ ked , which , according to c@@ n@@ n , meant that long back@@ sli@@ des were created .
the air traffic is tempor@@ arily suspended , except for land@@ ings .
however , several flying modes were also possible on c@@ n@@ n .
terminal 3 is mainly used by smaller us airlines .
the la@@ x airport of los angel@@ es is one of the largest airports in the us .
co@@ ca@@ ine ad@@ dic@@ ted law@@ yer , the drug bo@@ ss war@@ ned against police investigation , must be put in prison .
bas@@ har@@ at d@@ it@@ ta , 42 , gave information to under@@ world size ne@@ il scar@@ bor@@ ough further .
the law@@ yer was afraid to stop his secret drug ad@@ diction .
he was awarded the cro@@ wn court of li@@ ver@@ pool for three years .
a well-known criminal def@@ en@@ der who has a drug bar@@ on before a major police investigation because he was afraid to kill his secret drug ad@@ diction could be discovered , was sent@@ enced to three years in prison .
bas@@ har@@ at d@@ it@@ ta , 42 , supplied underground size ne@@ il scar@@ bor@@ ough with sensitive information about investigation into the country &apos;s activities in the drugs trade after being replaced by his own co@@ ca@@ ine ad@@ diction .
the “ first-@@ class ” pri@@ zed by crimin@@ alists is a law@@ yer with the n@@ ick@@ name “ bas@@ h ” in his house in 2011 , after the police scar@@ bor@@ ough and his police had been monitored .
officials wat@@ ched scar@@ bor@@ ough ( 32 ) have three bags co@@ ka@@ in on the house of law@@ yer in bla@@ k@@ bur@@ n , lan@@ ca@@ hire , and ab@@ be@@ y .
the investigation revealed that d@@ it@@ ta regularly uses drugs of class a , but after the tests spread trac@@ es of co@@ ca@@ ine in his hair , on his letter , and on his body and on credit cards .
over a period of eight months between january and august 2011 , he tried il@@ legally to obtain information about the arrest of two men on behalf of scar@@ bor@@ ough and one of his partners .
all four susp@@ ects were then prosecu@@ ted by the police in a major investigation to the her@@ o@@ in and co@@ ca@@ ine trade in lan@@ cas@@ hire , cum@@ bri@@ a , mer@@ se@@ y@@ side , ber@@ k@@ sh@@ ire and west .
together with 32 other people , they were later arrested after the police had been subjec@@ ted to a series of house sear@@ ches , her@@ o@@ in and co@@ ca@@ ine worth £ 1.5 million , as well as £ 200@@ ,000 in cash .
d@@ it@@ ta , 42 , passed on information to the crimin@@ als because he fe@@ ared that his drug ad@@ diction could be published .
today , d@@ it@@ ta , who was responsible for for@@ bes sol@@ ic@@ it@@ ers in black@@ bur@@ n , was arrested at li@@ ver@@ pool cro@@ wn court after a three-@@ week trial in two att@@ end@@ ance points .
he said in an earlier survey that he was in pos@@ session of co@@ ca@@ ine .
the law@@ yer was transferred after the police had been able to take action against scar@@ bor@@ ough in their investigations that he was in regular contact with the police in february 2011 .
two investig@@ ating officers followed the susp@@ ect and saw how he could be sent@@ enced to d@@ it@@ ta &apos;s house , where drugs were conf@@ is@@ c@@ ated with a pur@@ ity of 60 % in a black golf g@@ love .
shortly after he delivered drugs , sc@@ ar@@ bor@@ ough tele@@ ph@@ oned with d@@ it@@ ta , who was at dinner at the football sta@@ dium of black@@ bur@@ n ro@@ vers in ed@@ ou@@ ard park .
the law@@ yer returned home , took over drugs and then the police were sent nine communications between the two .
it was announced in court that d@@ it@@ ta was a “ regular consumer ” of co@@ ca@@ ine after testing drugs of class a in his hair , his letter and the letter bag were tested .
d@@ it@@ ta was later arrested , but dis@@ missed to take co@@ ca@@ ine and said he had to go to the alleg@@ ed deal@@ er because he had lost his client .
during his arrest , d@@ it@@ ta took his wal@@ let and tried to buy a number of credit cards , but they were secured and he was offered a sample of hair .
in police inter@@ ro@@ gation , he said that he is operating both under his private address and at work , and clients would be able to prosecu@@ te him at home for legal matters .
he was announced in court that he had been a major player in the drugs trade , some of whom he had previously represented , after significant ar@@ re@@ sts and informed of what the investig@@ ators knew about them .
prosecu@@ tor anne w@@ hy@@ te said : “ a prosecu@@ tor should be better than anyone to know that you can ’ t break the law . ”
d@@ it@@ ta will not be able to escape the abuse of his position as a criminal def@@ en@@ der , since he has inter@@ fe@@ red too much with certain clients .
the relationship in question is not simply that of a drug deal@@ er , but a drug deal@@ er who has been providing drugs to his law@@ yer .
part of his communications were undoubtedly legitimate , because he was the advoc@@ ate of these people .
but that went far beyond the b@@ ounds of a normal relationship between law@@ yer and client .
he has been involved in the police investigation as far as possible , so that they can continue to pursue their criminal activities .
mr d@@ it@@ ta thus dis@@ credited his profes@@ sion .
he was too close to certain clients , particularly scar@@ bor@@ ough , and he allowed the company to compromise his independence .
d@@ it@@ ta pointed out any mis@@ conduct and claimed , “ if i am a corru@@ pt law@@ yer , which i am not , and information to scar@@ bor@@ ough is passed on , then i would not give 15 hours to wait , but to do so .
but after the hearing , super@@ int@@ ent le@@ e hal@@ ste@@ ad said by the police in lan@@ cas@@ hire : “ mr d@@ it@@ ta has moved from a criminal def@@ en@@ der to a criminal at the moment he arri@@ ves .
his co@@ ca@@ ine dependence led to a ho@@ p@@ eless compromise and made him sus@@ cep@@ tible to the mo@@ tives of leading members of organised crime who appointed him to provide valuable information about police investigations .
lawyers must be able to maintain the highest standards of integrity and to ensure public confidence and confidence .
d@@ it@@ ta has ev@@ aded this trust and is trying to hide behind the fa@@ ç@@ ade of his profes@@ sion .
the serious and organized crime unit from lan@@ cas@@ hire was the head of the investigation of d@@ it@@ ta , who also led to a sentence in three cases because of the pos@@ session of co@@ ca@@ ine and the hin@@ dering of justice .
this case should be a warning to crimin@@ als and shows that no one can escape the arm of the law .
we find them and bring them to justice .
scar@@ bor@@ ough itself was sent@@ enced to 14 years in prison after being subjec@@ ted to the con@@ spir@@ acy to the her@@ o@@ in , co@@ ca@@ ine and can@@ n@@ ab@@ is trade .
thir@@ ty-@@ five other drugs players are listed on the list of total penalties of 15@@ 3 years for drug off@@ ences .
d@@ it@@ ta published a section of questions and answers about itself on its website , where he indicated that he was doing his dream job as a law@@ yer and a client in the death row in america .
the revolutionary work of church music
at the end of the celebr@@ ation of its 16@@ 0-@@ year anniversary , the song cr@@ ane dun@@ n@@ ingen will host two services with the &quot; deutsche mes@@ se &quot; by fran@@ z sch@@ u@@ bert .
after the great success of the music &quot; rock my life &quot; , which attrac@@ ted the audience this spring .
on saturday , 26 october , this extraordinary fair will be held from 19 at the evening fair in st. mar@@ tin@@ sk@@ ir@@ che dun@@ n@@ ingen and on sunday , 27 october , from 10 : 15 a.m. at the religious service in the church .
the so-called deutsche mes@@ se ( german trade fair ) , with the original title &quot; sing@@ ing to celebrate the holy sacrif@@ ice of the fair &quot; , d 8@@ 72 , is a spiritual music work of compos@@ er fran@@ z sch@@ u@@ bert gal@@ ery from 18@@ 26 .
the fair will be listed in the services of god , as the client jo@@ han@@ n phili@@ p@@ p neu@@ mann had in mind .
under the direction of her@@ mann sch@@ nei@@ der , the cho@@ ir is led by the br@@ ass group of the musi@@ k@@ vere@@ in gl@@ ü@@ h@@ sin@@ n ten@@ n@@ en@@ br@@ on@@ n and no@@ em@@ i lo@@ ko@@ di at the or@@ gan .
h@@ ash : ske@@ p@@ tic@@ ism is increasingly in@@ dul@@ ging in confidence .
the par@@ ish council elections in 20@@ 15 , for example , will bring about a change in the h@@ ass@@ ach ( se ) soul unit .
there is only one par@@ ish council for all six par@@ ish counc@@ ils .
in a joint meeting , the committees of has@@ l@@ ach , ho@@ f@@ ste@@ t@@ ten , m@@ ü@@ h@@ len@@ bach , fis@@ cher@@ bach , ste@@ in@@ ach and wel@@ sch@@ en@@ ste@@ in@@ ach prepared for the changes .
the fundamental decisions of the di@@ oc@@ ese are no longer to be changed and the p@@ far@@ r@@ ho@@ des are to be used as satisfac@@ tor@@ ily as possible .
during the day , it became particularly clear that s@@ cep@@ tic@@ ism about the new is ten@@ ding to be increasingly confident .
the ideas and expectations for the innovations 20@@ 15 and the concrete proposals on the future composition and size of the par@@ ish council have not been met by the very constructive discussions held by the six bodies with the main representatives of the ministry of culture .
regional de@@ an geor@@ g sch@@ mit@@ t explained on the basis of a presentation the newly defined guidelines for se@@ af@@ aring units in the arch@@ di@@ oc@@ ese of fre@@ i@@ burg .
after that , the church of san has@@ l@@ ach will become a body of public law which will be incorporated into the rights and obligations of the six church communities .
there will only be a joint par@@ ish council and a foundation council , in which the par@@ ish council of the am@@ t@@ é is represented .
from each par@@ ish at least two elected members are to be represented , in the six par@@ ish churches so-called par@@ ish teams are formed .
your task will be to make the church life in the place a reality .
on the question of the finances of the par@@ ish , a great need for dialogue emerged .
the innovations provide that collected funds will be used in the par@@ ish buildings for specific purposes .
li@@ abilities , on the other hand , go to the entire community .
it is precisely in view of the large planned investments , the commitment of which will affect all the par@@ ish population , that there have been major concerns .
&quot; in the past , investment was only made in projects that were developed by the individual par@@ ish owners alone , &quot; rela@@ ti@@ vi@@ zed has@@ l@@ ach &apos;s par@@ ish community charter .
practical experience with a joint committee for five par@@ ish churches was described by bar@@ b@@ ar k@@ nights , the chairman of the board of the sou@@ l@@ bound sch@@ ut@@ ter@@ wal@@ d-@@ neu@@ ried .
they had set themselves the task of becoming one , staying five in 2006 , and found that it is not so easy .
the h@@ ass@@ an sou@@ l@@ ship unit bodies then decided to answer questions about the future composition and size of the common par@@ ish council and the practical work of the community teams .
the work will be further developed in further meetings and will be discussed in a further joint meeting of all six bodies next spring .
in the end , the par@@ ish council michael sch@@ ö@@ ner from ste@@ in@@ ach presented the new logo of the sou@@ l@@ bound unit , which was approved by a clear majority .
in p@@ f@@ ul@@ l@@ endor@@ f , electricity is more expensive than in the past .
the citizens of p@@ f@@ ul@@ l@@ endor@@ f must be prepared for higher electricity costs .
as the managing director of the stad@@ tw@@ er@@ ke , j@@ ör@@ g-@@ ar@@ ne bi@@ as , confirmed to the south cou@@ ri@@ er , a four-@@ head@@ ed p@@ f@@ ul@@ l@@ endor@@ fer family will receive between 70 and 90 euros extra costs per year .
the main reason for the upcoming price increase is the increase in the so-called ec lev@@ y of 5.@@ 27@@ 7 to 6.@@ 3 c@@ ents per kil@@ ow@@ att@@ -@@ hour .
this lev@@ y is paid every october by the four operators of the major power routes .
these figures show the cost of the additional costs incur@@ red by the energy tur@@ n@@ around , which you can impose through a lev@@ y over the price of electricity .
the town ’ s p@@ f@@ ul@@ l@@ endor@@ f is the last link in this chain .
the supervisory board of the energy company even dre@@ w attention in its forec@@ asts to a higher lev@@ y , as j@@ ör@@ g-@@ ar@@ ne bi@@ as reported .
now the actual figures would have to be calculated before the city plants would inform their customers next week about the exact price increase .
&quot; we are starting from an increase of 1 cent plus x , &quot; says bi@@ as , with the number more near the 2 cent .
traffic lights on permanent red : keep a close eye on the waiting time .
sometimes a traffic light simply does not green .
the contact loo@@ p in the street does not react , or the light sign is broken .
what should we do then - drive red ?
has a person been involved for long enough in a red light and the crossing is free , he can continue , the stutt@@ gart airport decla@@ res the att@@ or@@ ney r@@ al@@ f bec@@ ker in the magazine &quot; motor@@ ra@@ d &quot; .
the waiting time must be &quot; appropriate &quot; , which is different from case to case .
bec@@ ker advis@@ es you to hold out at least five minutes before you are talking about a traffic light to work .
if you want to continue driving despite the red light , you must be aware that it is not suitable for a accident caused by it .
if you have been listening for less than five minutes , you may not be long enough to war@@ n bec@@ ker and point to a decision by the supreme court of ham@@ m .
in the case under negotiation , a driver had a chance to drive around three minutes of continuous red light and had to be prepared for a neglig@@ ent red light off@@ ence .
the traffic lights were not broken , but they jum@@ ped on green a little later .

the municip@@ al council welcomes solid budget and the new budget .
whenever there is a community budget in local counc@@ ils , may@@ or r@@ alp@@ h ger@@ ster has a good lau@@ gh .
the municip@@ al back@@ pack in her@@ d@@ w@@ ang@@ en-@@ sch@@ ö@@ n@@ ach is well filled and the administration has not known since 2005 .
the 2012 financial year can also be regarded as a complete success in this respect .
this was confirmed at the presentation of the 2012 annual accounts .
as andre@@ a ro@@ th@@ mun@@ d said , the administrative budget is about eur 7.@@ 6 million over a million more than the planned .
the sur@@ plus of the administrative budget also stands at around eur 1.@@ 8 million over the approach , which is about eur 1 million .
the sur@@ plus is due above all to higher commercial tax revenue and the community share of income tax .
the wealth budget was again well above the planned values .
instead of the eur 1.5 million envis@@ aged , it was eur 2.5 million last year .
&quot; this is mainly due to the higher allocation from the administrative budget &quot; , says ro@@ th@@ mun@@ d .
as less investment is planned in the 2012 financial year , there is also a need for the return allocation to be higher .
overall , the overall reserve was reduced by around eur 2.@@ 1 million to eur 4.@@ 9 million now .
may@@ or r@@ alp@@ h ger@@ ster than@@ ked ro@@ th@@ mun@@ d and her team for their good work .
&quot; such a work cannot be sha@@ ken off the sle@@ eve , &quot; ger@@ ster p@@ raised the annual accounts .
he and the local counc@@ ils were vi@@ sibly happy with the good figures .
it may sound par@@ ado@@ x@@ ical , but it is these very good figures that citizens could soon find expensive .
the good financial situation has allowed the community to rely on high le@@ verage in the past .
this in turn , however , has already been said to have been cut back on more than one occasion on subsidies from the country .
for these subsidies from various compens@@ atory po@@ les , there are conditions .
among other things , the towns and communities requ@@ est@@ ing subsidies must be given certain le@@ verage .
&quot; we have to look at the subject of ho@@ ists , because in the coming years investments will be needed for which we would like to receive grants , &quot; said ger@@ ster .
n@@ ag@@ old : hu@@ go wer@@ m@@ ter has been working in the ch@@ or@@ us for 60 years in the ch@@ or@@ us of the cho@@ ir for 60 years in the cho@@ ir for 60 years .
at the age of 60 , hu@@ bert wer@@ m@@ ter &apos;s story is published by the male sing@@ er &apos;s association ca@@ ec@@ ili@@ a almost twice as long as that of the her@@ b@@ s@@ fe@@ ast , in which he was hon@@ oured sole@@ m@@ n@@ ly .
hu@@ bert wer@@ m@@ ter stood as usual in the colors of his male sing@@ er club on stage .
after 60 years , sing@@ ing with the now more than dear one ch@@ or@@ us still makes him a great pleasure .
in the association , wer@@ m@@ ter was also active , among other things for 28 years as a member of the committee .
he was awarded the prize for his commitment and his commitment to the company : j@@ ör@@ g ko@@ hr , pa@@ stor@@ al speaker on behalf of the c@@ ec@@ ili@@ an association rot@@ ten@@ bur@@ g-@@ stutt@@ gart .
his sing@@ er colleagues presented him with the german ch@@ oral association ’ s certificate and a eng@@ ra@@ ved tin plate .
in addition to the award , the 3@@ 1st autumn festival was in the usual tracks : with the m@@ g@@ v be@@ tra , the li@@ e@@ der@@ k@@ ran@@ z salz@@ ste@@ t@@ ten , the sing@@ er ’ s department ba@@ is@@ ingen and the local music club .
the m@@ g@@ v vol@@ l@@ mar@@ ingen opened its doors with atmo@@ sp@@ her@@ ic songs like &quot; in the wine paradise &quot; and &quot; fun@@ ny , your bro@@ thers &quot; .
her hon@@ or@@ ary sing@@ er hu@@ bert wer@@ m@@ ter was hon@@ ored with a small st@@ än@@ d@@ chen - wol@@ f@@ gan@@ g am@@ ade@@ us moz@@ art &apos;s &quot; bun@@ des@@ lied &quot; .

the song cr@@ ane salt ste@@ t@@ ten with his mixed cho@@ ir and his female group - the &quot; imp@@ ul@@ sch@@ or &quot; - created the female quota of the festival .

ken@@ y@@ an press ou@@ tr@@ aged the controversial media law
“ we are in a fri@@ ghten@@ ing position and we should ask ourselves : what does parliament think about simply taking the judge ’ s independence out of tomorrow ? ” , said the newspaper ?
“ the law is dr@@ ac@@ on@@ ian and very pun@@ ish@@ able , and we reject it , ” said cy@@ r@@ us kam@@ au , managing director of the capital group , to which capit@@ al@@ f@@ m is also a respected independent radio station .
he said that the new media tri@@ bun@@ al is “ always pre@@ jud@@ ice , because it is an extended arm of the government , ” and restrictions on content and advertising would make ken@@ ya ’ s position in the global economy damaged .
“ i hope the president list@@ ens to us and we call on him to reject this bill and to return to parliament , ” he said .
according to the star newspaper , the government is taking effective action against the media through the new law , whereas the standard , democracy and freedom of speech in ken@@ ya , has been “ a heavy b@@ low , ” and be@@ ti@@ tel@@ le has claimed .
the adoption of the law is part of a series of measures aimed at improving national security following the attacks by armed islam@@ ists .
the ken@@ y@@ an media with@@ dre@@ w the public authorities ’ an@@ ger for publishing security cameras , on which they could see how the people working on the scene of the crime were sup@@ pos@@ ed@@ ly the luxury shopping m@@ all .
police chief david k@@ im@@ ai@@ y@@ o respon@@ ded by placing an order for two journalists and one of the leading media representatives , even though the sub@@ po@@ en@@ as were still in the process of being with@@ drawn after a media out@@ cr@@ y .
under the new law , media houses can be granted a penalty of up to 20 million ken@@ y@@ an sch@@ ill@@ ings and individual journalists can be pun@@ ished with up to one million and the further risk of losing their professional recognition or being excluded from official press ac@@ cred@@ its .
the tri@@ bun@@ al also has the right to conf@@ is@@ c@@ ate the pos@@ session of those affected if a penalty is not paid .
according to daily nation , “ even one sentence can kill most radio stations into bank@@ rup@@ t@@ cy . ”
moreover , the newspaper believes that these measures could have a dev@@ ast@@ ating effect on the “ lively blo@@ go@@ sphere ” that it describes as ken@@ ya .
if you are sil@@ encing the media , politicians could go un@@ pun@@ ished , whatever they want .
“ no one will ever know it , ” mu@@ t@@ um@@ a ma@@ thi@@ u , journ@@ alist at the nation , who den@@ oun@@ ced ken@@ y@@ an media as a decisive factor in public life .
“ leave politicians to their own devices , lead the country into bank@@ rup@@ t@@ cy and return us to the age of hun@@ ters and collec@@ tors , ” he comm@@ ented .
ken@@ y@@ an legisl@@ ators have been in the past causing public an@@ ger .

bad@@ -@@ d@@ ür@@ r@@ heim : a dream comes true for the f@@ c d@@ ür@@ r@@ heim
the city and the football club lost their official in@@ aug@@ ur@@ ation cere@@ mony for the artificial tur@@ f sports field despite the cold weather .
a more pleasant celebr@@ ation was probably celebrated last saturday , but pe@@ tr@@ us wanted to avoid playing with him .
so all those who had to leave without um@@ bre@@ lla or have had to leave such a place for any reason .
this was done by musicians who were fr@@ aming the festival , just as many speakers did .
we@@ t was therefore also the f@@ c chairman al@@ bre@@ cht sch@@ len@@ ker , who spoke of ful@@ filling a dream .
his thanks were due to may@@ or wal@@ ter k@@ lu@@ mp@@ p , who was responsible for the implementation of the project , the municip@@ al council , the companies involved and members of the association who took part .
here , especially lo@@ th@@ ar her@@ o , paul we@@ iz@@ en@@ e@@ gger , he@@ iner ga@@ il and peter gra@@ f .
reti@@ red people moved 400 square metres of pav@@ ement for the new paths .
this remarkable voluntary commitment also appreciated the country &apos;s me@@ p , kar@@ l ro@@ mb@@ ach .
further gre@@ e@@ ting was given to the urban sports committee hu@@ bert ba@@ i@@ er , the district chairman of the south ba@@ den football association , kun@@ o k@@ ay@@ an , and fried@@ rich k@@ nor@@ r of the planning office , the european commission .
may@@ or k@@ lu@@ mp@@ p remin@@ ded us that rec@@ ur@@ ring weather influ@@ ences in the spring and autumn are attribu@@ table to the original la@@ wn place in such a way that it could not be played .
the first thoughts on the solution of the problem were already 15 years ago , when the construction of a third place was planned for the football club or the real school at the sal@@ in@@ en@@ see lake .
both have been dis@@ car@@ ded .
six years ago , ideas were put forward for the creation of an artificial tur@@ f sport area , which is generally considered the ultimate solution .
concrete plans were adopted two years ago , when the f@@ c moved the sch@@ ab@@ el@@ stu@@ be to her@@ g@@ le@@ ich@@ te , a cost of eur 100 000 to build the place and promoted the country to eur 10@@ 4 000 .
the municip@@ al council decided in october 2012 to take over the remaining 3@@ 56 000 euros to the total cost of 5@@ 60 000 euros , kl@@ um@@ p@@ p summar@@ ized .
the construction of the 68 x 10@@ 8 meter artificial tur@@ f site was completed on june 4 .
during the three-@@ month construction phase , 3@@ 000 cu@@ b@@ ic metres of soil were wor@@ n out , half of which were used for the creation of a dir@@ t bike route .
the union and the sp@@ d have concluded their coalition negotiations with the issues of internal and judicial affairs .
the relevant working group was also meeting in berlin in the morning .
one of the issues is direct democracy , members ’ bri@@ ber@@ y and the federal police .
the morning also wanted to see the migration and integration working group continue its deliber@@ ations .
this is probably one of the issues that should be addressed here , namely dual citizenship , where both sides have conflic@@ ting ideas .
the sp@@ d wants to impose the pressure on german@@ -@@ born immi@@ grant children to choose one , but the union is not in favour of a double pass@@ port .
on the subject of transport , which was not on the agenda this friday , the sp@@ d under@@ sco@@ red its ‘ no ’ vote to a p@@ k@@ w tol@@ l requested by the c@@ su .
a vig@@ net@@ te is a &quot; fl@@ at@@ rate for the multi@@ tu@@ de , thus counter@@ productive in ecological terms &quot; , declared by the sp@@ d negoti@@ ator on transport , fl@@ ori@@ an pron@@ old , in a letter to his group .
there were im@@ minent f@@ all-@@ off on land roads that are already the main areas of accident .
the introduction of a tol@@ l for all cars would also be , from pron@@ ol@@ ds ’ point of view , only a first step .
&quot; there is a danger that the comp@@ en@@ sa@@ tions for german people will be cancelled at a later date , &quot; he said .

vienna airport creates passenger calls from vienna airport
mr max ma@@ i@@ er , please come to gate 24 .
announ@@ c@@ ements of this kind will be no longer held at vienna sch@@ w@@ ec@@ hat airport .
most of the lou@@ d@@ speakers are lost - the noise level is to be reduced so much .
creating a more relaxed atmosphere is the aim of this innovation .
as airport spo@@ kes@@ man peter kle@@ em@@ ann announced to radio vienna , vienna airport follows with the suspension of announ@@ c@@ ements affecting individuals , an international trend .
for example , the airports in copenhagen , frankfurt or du@@ ba@@ i already do not make the noise calls .
the dis@@ appearance of these a@@ ver@@ ages - on average around 200 personal inci@@ dents from the lou@@ d@@ speakers in one day - should make it more peaceful in the future to approach the airport .
&quot; it has also been shown in experience that these individual fail@@ ures have been per@@ ceived relatively little , but at the same time all other information on changed flight sched@@ ules or departure times here a little go away &quot; , says kle@@ em@@ ann in talks .

ve@@ gan nutri@@ tion requires vege@@ table alternatives to e@@ gg@@ s , milk and d@@ airy products .
the hotel is located in the heart of the city , in the heart of the old town .
the other is the vege@@ t@@ arian heritage of the world ve@@ gan day on november 1 .
the vege@@ t@@ arian association germany is proposing a new vege@@ t@@ arian garden for the world ve@@ gan day on november 1 :
pure plant mar@@ gar@@ ines are a good alternative to but@@ ter , yo@@ gh@@ ur@@ t let so@@ y@@ a@@ yo@@ gh@@ ur@@ t replace .
instead of milk , so@@ ya , o@@ ats , al@@ mon@@ d or rice milk could be used .
top@@ p@@ able plant cre@@ am replace conventional be@@ verage .
there are also vege@@ table alternatives to e@@ gg@@ s .
half a crus@@ hed , mature ban@@ ana , for example , can be used as a binding agent in a ca@@ ke .
also 50 gram@@ s of apple or a tab@@ les@@ po@@ on ground can@@ n@@ ab@@ is plus three tab@@ les@@ po@@ ons of water are suitable for this .
loc@@ kers are used to treat d@@ ough instead of eg@@ g with a mix@@ ture of a te@@ as@@ po@@ on ba@@ king pow@@ der , a tab@@ les@@ po@@ on of dining strength and three tab@@ les@@ po@@ ons of min@@ eral water .
but also 50 gram@@ s of so@@ ja@@ yo@@ gh@@ ur@@ t or sil@@ k furn@@ ace can do this .
according to ve@@ b@@ u , around 800 000 people are currently eating ve@@ gan in germany , i.e. purely plant .
sle@@ e@@ pl@@ ess in new york
on the way to their host families in we@@ y@@ mouth , mass@@ ach@@ us@@ et@@ ts , the students of the black forest gy@@ m@@ na@@ si@@ um learned the american city of new york .
after eight hours of flight , the bro@@ ok@@ ly@@ n bridge was just off the road , where the heart of the city , man@@ h@@ att@@ an , was reached on foot .
this is a fascinating view of the world famous sky@@ line , which is being played in the evening light .
the time shift meant that students had to walk on their leg@@ s for almost 24 hours , but true to the mo@@ tto &quot; the city does not sleep &quot; , the day was decided on at times square .
despite shut@@ down , the freedom stat@@ ue could be filled with a fer@@ ry on the second day and it could be reached on foot .
then there was the financial centre around wall street , which was the mem@@ orial of september 11 .
on the third day , the students were able to enjoy the 3@@ 73 meter high viewing platform of the emp@@ ire@@ -@@ state building , an overview of the fascinating city , while taking in the view .
after that , the hec@@ tic pace of new york streets swe@@ pt over ro@@ c@@ ke@@ f@@ ell@@ er center to central park , which was an ideal opportunity to stay for a short while in the autumn sun .
after a short flight from new york to bo@@ ston , students are now arriving in their host families and experience a variety of exciting experiences at the we@@ y@@ mouth high school .
this year , the saint hu@@ ber@@ tus day will be celebrated in the par@@ ish church of st. mari@@ en at the h@@ ul@@ s@@ ber@@ g@@ stra@@ ß@@ e in the city of h@@ ul@@ s@@ ber@@ g@@ stra@@ ß@@ e .
st. hu@@ ber@@ tus was , as it were , a rather ru@@ th@@ less hun@@ ter , who was converted by a vision and later became bis@@ hop of li@@ è@@ ge .
the hun@@ ting hor@@ n br@@ ass group of the hun@@ ting tri@@ bes west@@ ph@@ alia , led by bri@@ g@@ it@@ te k@@ lu@@ th , musi@@ c. it is based on par@@ for@@ ce@@ hor@@ ns ( natural hor@@ ns in the mo@@ od es ) .
the br@@ ass we@@ ars horse clothing because they are mainly hor@@ se@@ -@@ riding , horses and dog owners on tra@@ w@@ ling .
the f@@ es@@ tive fair will take place on sunday , november 3 , at 11.@@ 30 a.m.
the newly designed op@@ tic g@@ loss with a new caf@@ e .
one that is used to stay and come back .
one that wants to make the name of the program .
the name dé@@ j@@ à v@@ u is a psycho@@ logical phenomenon , according to the le@@ x@@ icon , which is expressed in the sense that a new situation has already been experienced or seen .
in the case of a visit to the café of the same name at the op@@ sch@@ la@@ g in the district town of kle@@ ve , within sight of the rhe@@ in-@@ wa@@ al university , it is not necessary to remain with the pure dé@@ j@@ à v@@ u feeling .
finally , the café with its beautiful name has exactly the aim : to make a real stay not only in thought , but also in a hand@@ ful of times to be experienced rec@@ ur@@ ring .
because it &apos;s fun and it &apos;s just beautiful .
a look at the interior of the op@@ sch@@ la@@ g 8 gives the vie@@ wer a good feeling at first sight .
the ul@@ tra-@@ modern , but not cool ca@@ fe@@ -@@ ambi@@ ence looks like a place to feel good .
the team spo@@ ils its foun@@ ders mir@@ j@@ am van der ste@@ t@@ t and dani@@ el b@@ ü@@ tt@@ ner at the top with a wide range of coffee and cock@@ tail vari@@ ants .
there are also delicious ca@@ kes or individually stoc@@ ked fresh bag@@ u@@ et@@ tes .
the owners , both 33 years old , have already registered themselves before the opening of the or@@ nam@@ ental caf@@ és at the op@@ sch@@ la@@ g as gastronom@@ ic compan@@ i@@ es. in k@@ ran@@ enburg they conducted the &quot; art lounge &quot; .
from moving to kle@@ ve , the german association of the german and european artists hopes to get more audience .
the university of applied sciences , too , has done so .
&quot; we don &apos;t have a specific target group &quot; , says dani@@ el b@@ ü@@ tt@@ ner .
rather , the two students here want to address themselves to the elderly as well as to all ages .
speaking of caf@@ e lovers .
the friendly owner is behind the coffee shop .
enjoy the sm@@ elling hot br@@ ä@@ u in a variety of different vari@@ ations .
expres@@ s@@ fan
dani@@ el b@@ ü@@ tt@@ ner is more of an expres@@ so fan and mir@@ j@@ am van der ste@@ dt the cap@@ pu@@ c@@ c@@ ino tr@@ in@@ ker .
&quot; a bag@@ u@@ ette - that &apos;s my thing &quot; , she tells the n@@ r@@ z .
two events were also held in the bright café .
better put , one .
the port festival was held outside rather than outside - the café dé@@ j@@ à v@@ u did not benefit from it .
but there was also the r@@ ing@@ el@@ nat@@ z@@ evening .
&quot; beautiful , successful and fun@@ ny &quot; , the two 3@@ 3-@@ year-@@ ol@@ ds found .
but not everyone &apos;s business .
perhaps dani@@ el b@@ ü@@ tt@@ ner is not a very special fan of event even@@ ings , either : &quot; you can &apos;t do it to all &quot; .
and with an event i always speak only those who are interested in the special event .
that is why events will be the exception rather than the rule .
&quot; we want to keep the normal operation as little as possible &quot; .
should i say : dé@@ j@@ à v@@ u also stands for reliability .
as regards the quality of the products offered here , as well as the team and the beautiful surroundings at the op@@ sch@@ la@@ ve .
the road that is increasingly becoming a gastronom@@ ic m@@ ile .
to the deli@@ ght of many kle@@ vers who welcome guests from close and far and the students who want to visit the ga@@ stro@@ m@@ ile and therefore also the café dé@@ j@@ à v@@ u .

a day of thanks to the m@@ g@@ v in din@@ ker
it was the 16@@ 5th anniversary of the foundation of the &quot; fried@@ rich wil@@ hel@@ m din@@ ker &quot; m@@ g@@ v this year and was attended by 52 guests , active sing@@ ers and their wi@@ ves .
the club restaurant &quot; wit@@ te@@ bor@@ g &quot; in din@@ ker geno@@ cide has all enjoyed the harmon@@ ious co@@ existence of the music .
tradi@@ tionally , the foundation festival is also the right festi@@ vity to honour .
the special award &quot; sing@@ er of the year &quot; was a pleasure for the writer ro@@ l@@ f wag@@ en@@ er .
&quot; you have written a lot for us , but you have also had some la@@ ps for us , and we would like to thank you for that , &quot; says the chairman of the cho@@ ir er@@ ich sch@@ lo@@ t@@ mann .
the awards for participation in the performances and cho@@ ir re@@ hear@@ s@@ als by means of activity sh@@ ru@@ bs went to the ch@@ oral director di@@ e@@ ter schul@@ ze with 44 participants , followed by the hon@@ or@@ ary chairman hor@@ st pi@@ er-@@ pi@@ er-@@ pi@@ er-@@ ro@@ ger .
the number five was awarded by the no@@ tar@@ ies ar@@ tu@@ r br@@ ü@@ ck@@ ner .
a special thank you was sent to the team of vere@@ in@@ sw@@ ir@@ tin ange pi@@ er-@@ ri@@ b@@ bert , who once again created a menu of the extra class and was awarded to ger@@ da pi@@ er-@@ ri@@ b@@ bert for the table decor@@ ation .
the m@@ g@@ v &quot; fried@@ rich@@ -@@ wil@@ hel@@ m &quot; meets for its regular cho@@ ir re@@ hear@@ s@@ als every tuesday at 7.@@ 45 p.m. at the club .
&quot; new s@@ oun@@ d-@@ pleas@@ ing vo@@ ices are always welcome &quot; , says sch@@ lo@@ t@@ mann .
un announ@@ ces new targets for poverty reduction .
the united nations is now beginning to draw up a series of new objectives to achieve the millennium development goals announced twelve years ago .
in the run@@ -up to the un summit on sustainable development , which is to start in rio de jan@@ e@@ iro in the evening , austr@@ ali@@ an diplom@@ ats played a key role in the drive for “ sustainable development ” that would replace the millennium development goals exp@@ iring in 20@@ 15 .
they were included in the final draft document , which was drafted by world leaders , including mrs g@@ ill@@ ard , at the summit .
un secre@@ tar@@ y-@@ general ban ki@@ -@@ moon said at the summit in the evening that the time had come to “ think beyond national interests . ”
“ i am pleased that member states have agreed to create a process that will enable the eu to develop universal , sustainable development goals .
“ these goals are based on our progress in the millennium development goals and will provide an integral part of the framework for development after 20@@ 15 .
i will spare no effort to re@@ me@@ dy this problem that has been given to me by the member states in order to achieve our vision of sustainable development goals based on the success of the millennium goals . ”
although s@@ g achi@@ m / ba@@ den has been without victory for four days , the hand@@ ball ob@@ er@@ lig@@ ist still enjoys a good mo@@ od .
this is what tra@@ iner tom@@ as@@ z mal@@ mon has no doubts about .
all of them are still fully motivated .
nevertheless , i hope that we will finally win again .
&quot; because i don &apos;t know how to win this way &quot; , i gu@@ ess mal@@ mon exp@@ ects a success experience of his team .
even if the third league reserve is made up of fre@@ den@@ bec@@ k , no trees are currently being cut out , mal@@ mon raises war@@ nings in advance of the search .
many players have i still train in a youth .
they will therefore be voting against their ex@@ -@@ co@@ ach in particular .
&quot; it is also important to see whether there will be any further rein@@ for@@ cement from the first one , &quot; explains the s@@ g-@@ co@@ ach .
to finally return to the success story , the mal@@ mon@@ -@@ team must be more competitive than the previous performances on the market .
in particular , the provision of cover and the swit@@ ching game has made a huge difference .
it is also essential to improve the exploitation of opportunities .
therefore , i hope that my players will finally be able to get their heads free during the short break .
security concerns in moz@@ ambi@@ que are growing in the face of cl@@ ash@@ es between influ@@ ential figures and leaders .
thousands of people gathered in the centre of ma@@ pu@@ to under the wat@@ ch@@ ful eyes of the stat@@ ue of sam@@ ora m@@ nel , the founder of the state and first president of moz@@ ambi@@ que to attend a rare public demonstration calling for peace .
“ we want peace again , we want stability , ” said van@@ ess@@ a de s@@ ous@@ a , managing director of an investment company .
fear for the country ’ s future has made it a fashion gar@@ ment for a t-@@ shir@@ t with the label “ we demand security ” in portuguese and signed up to the crow@@ d on thursday of the capital ’ s independence square .
for two weeks , there have been reports almost daily of cl@@ ash@@ es between government forces and ren@@ am@@ o , which have been one of the worst batt@@ les since the peace agreement more than 20 years ago .
ren@@ am@@ o was once a not@@ ori@@ ous re@@ bel movement that was initially led by the white r@@ ho@@ desi@@ a and later by apar@@ the@@ id government in south africa .
after the 1992 peace treaty , it became an opposition party .
analy@@ sts consider it unlikely that the country will return to a full-@@ scale conflict , but the recent events have left foreign investors and domestic concerns .
there is a lot at stake for the fa@@ st-@@ growing economy , because the discovery of huge gas depos@@ its off the coast and coal depos@@ its in the north-@@ west could generate investment of more than $ 50 billion in the coming years from companies like rio t@@ into .
the ruling fre@@ lim@@ o party , since 197@@ 5 the dominant force , and ren@@ am@@ o give each other the blame for ten@@ sions .
ren@@ am@@ o claims that the government has pro@@ vo@@ ked recent cl@@ ash@@ es by holding its members in the province of so@@ fal@@ a , a traditional strong@@ hold of ren@@ am@@ os , on 17 october .
the attacks on the former re@@ be@@ ls es@@ cal@@ ated as ren@@ am@@ o government troops were att@@ acking and destro@@ ying the country &apos;s military base .
the government bl@@ ames ren@@ am@@ o for the cl@@ ash@@ es and acc@@ uses the organization of att@@ acking soldiers .
president ar@@ man@@ do gu@@ e@@ bu@@ za has sought to reduce concerns about inst@@ ability .
in comparison to af@@ p , the french news agency , he said on wednesday that dh@@ la@@ k@@ ama was “ lo@@ ser . ”
both fre@@ lim@@ o and ren@@ am@@ o stress that they want to avoid war .
but concerns have increased since ma@@ z@@ ang@@ a , quo@@ ted in the words of ren@@ am@@ o , ren@@ am@@ o , ad@@ here to the 1992 peace agreement .
in relation to the ft , he said that fre@@ lim@@ o did not respect the agreement any more .
“ our vision is to re@@ sume negotiations seriously , ” ma@@ z@@ ang@@ a said .
earlier talks between the parties have done little to resolve the ten@@ sions caused by a series of cl@@ ash@@ es this year .
“ we have two adults men ( gu@@ e@@ bu@@ za and dh@@ la@@ k@@ ama ) here who bring the heads together , ” says joseph ha@@ y@@ dn .
none of them is good at negotiating and none is willing to make the necessary conc@@ essions .
ren@@ am@@ o , who is pressing for electoral reform , has already declared that it will bo@@ y@@ cot@@ t the local elections in november .
presidential and parliamentary elections are scheduled for next year .
some comm@@ ent@@ ators have described the use of force as an attempt by a w@@ re@@ t@@ ched movement to make conc@@ essions and financial benefits from the government .
ren@@ am@@ o ’ s electoral success has been shr@@ in@@ king since 1992 , while a ne@@ wer party , founded by a former ren@@ am@@ o member , has been supporting mo@@ vi@@ men@@ to demo@@ cr@@ á@@ tic@@ o de mo@@ ç@@ ambi@@ que ( m@@ d@@ m ) .
ma@@ z@@ ang@@ a claims that gu@@ e@@ bu@@ za – whose re@@ sign@@ ation is due when his second term ends next year – will destroy the country ’ s democracy .
“ he does not want multi-@@ party democracy , he does not want transparent elections , he does not want peace because he does not want to give up the presidency , ” says ma@@ z@@ ang@@ a .
it is un@@ clear what capacity ren@@ am@@ o has , but it has caused distur@@ bing attacks on police stations and vehicles on an important north-@@ south link .
most of the fighting took place in the province of so@@ fal@@ a , which is a few hundred kilometres north of ma@@ pu@@ to , but in which is located be@@ ira , the port , the mining companies such as rio t@@ into and rio ex@@ al@@ to .
in june , rio suspended the use of the railways for a month after ren@@ am@@ o launched an attack on the track .
ma@@ z@@ ang@@ a respon@@ ded cau@@ ti@@ ously to the question of whether ren@@ am@@ o would repeat this threat .
ren@@ am@@ o wanted to “ war@@ n the international community that things in moz@@ ambi@@ que are not going well , ” said ma@@ z@@ ang@@ a .
inst@@ ability has sti@@ r@@ red fru@@ stration over the government , fer@@ nan@@ do li@@ ma says , leader of medi@@ ac@@ o@@ op , an independent media company , because many people were already wor@@ ried about corruption , bad news .
“ people think that the government and the president are responsible for the country ’ s future , and that he should be the person who finds solutions to the problems , ” he explains .
om@@ ar sul@@ tan@@ e , a demonstr@@ ator , said that people simply wanted stability .
“ no one is interested in ren@@ am@@ o and f@@ ili@@ mo , they simply want peace and us@@ able roads again , ” he said .
children should read my@@ ths and leg@@ ends as “ models for life , ” says a writer .
th@@ or &apos;s stories showed that “ brut@@ al power has no chance of defe@@ ating cle@@ ver tr@@ ic@@ ks , ” and ar@@ tus leg@@ end demonstrates that it is important to keep a dream .
many of the my@@ ths , however , are “ far too wild , too off@@ ensive , and in some cases too dir@@ ty to be taught at schools . ”
“ i find it wonderful that in america my@@ ths and fol@@ kl@@ ore are already part of education , ” he said .
i have been proposing this for twenty years as a plan .
he added that , for authors and teachers who have “ over@@ ly di@@ d@@ ac@@ tic ” , children would be “ completely sh@@ ut down ” , because in enter@@ taining stories , the messages would be “ sub@@ limin@@ al ” .
cros@@ s@@ le@@ y-@@ hol@@ land , the be@@ ow@@ ul@@ f from the ang@@ lo@@ -@@ sa@@ x@@ on region , and author of the pen@@ gu@@ in book of nor@@ se my@@ ths and the british fol@@ k tal@@ es , declared : “ you can follow certain intentions : ”
perhaps the greatest difference between an adult author writing for adults and an author who is for children is that of a person who has a desire to conve@@ y hope .
not everything needs to be simplified or lead to happy ending , but there is a real sense of good and evil .
this must be sub@@ limin@@ al , revealed by history and not explained .
this is the old story of showing rather than telling .
han@@ s@@ j@@ ak@@ o@@ b moves again to fre@@ i@@ hof
100 years ago , he@@ in@@ rich han@@ s@@ j@@ ak@@ o@@ b re@@ tained his reti@@ rement home in has@@ l@@ ach , and on sunday his last years were alive in the &quot; fre@@ i@@ hof &quot; .

he was not only appla@@ u@@ ded by the audience , but his si@@ ster phili@@ pp@@ ine was also welcome .
bil@@ ly sum her@@ mann understood it incredi@@ bly well to inter@@ f@@ ere in the role of si@@ ster and to give her a hand in m@@ im@@ ics and ge@@ st@@ ures of immen@@ se life .
between the scenes of the game , the m@@ ü@@ h@@ len@@ bach farm@@ er ’ s cha@@ pel played su@@ itably selected music pieces , thereby comple@@ ting the performance .
to give the dignity of honour , h@@ as@@ la@@ k &apos;s may@@ or he@@ in@@ z win@@ k@@ ler gave himself the honour to represent the then inc@@ um@@ b@@ ent .
their up@@ keep then made the tri@@ -@@ king sing@@ er , the han@@ s@@ j@@ ak@@ o@@ b called for the ex@@ cl@@ am@@ ation : &quot; o@@ h how beautiful , there are youth mem@@ ories of my own tri@@ king time alive &quot; .
with her song &quot; o jes@@ u@@ le@@ in &quot; they were pleased to welcome the audience in the open yard , as well as the stor@@ k tag@@ sk@@ in@@ der with their l@@ oud &quot; out , out &quot; .
his criticism of the church of the state had been expressed by han@@ s@@ j@@ ak@@ o@@ b at the time , just as his concerns about the agricultural exc@@ esses , the consequences of industri@@ alisation or the effects of war .
in the home area , behind its tom@@ b cha@@ pel on the fire near ho@@ f@@ ste@@ t@@ ten , he found his re@@ sting place .
&quot; a trou@@ b@@ led spirit had finally found its calm and had gone home fore@@ ver , &quot; said it at the end of the scene .
a lot of applause and many pra@@ ises were given by the audience for the performance .

&quot; the signals are intended for safety and are legally prescri@@ bed &quot; , says mat@@ thi@@ as sch@@ re@@ ll , managing director of the r@@ hen@@ us mid@@ g@@ ard in wil@@ hel@@ m@@ sha@@ ven .
if the wind is un@@ favourable , this is , unfortunately , widely heard - and there have already been some complaints from people from the north of the city .
he takes the complaints very seriously and has therefore cont@@ acted the people concerned , says the 40 year-@@ old .
in close consultation with the authorities , the warning signals are now being sent out qui@@ e@@ tly with technical measures .
he continues to count on open dialogue with his neighbours .
mat@@ thi@@ as sch@@ re@@ ll has some things to do in front of the site .
with the expansion of the ni@@ e@@ der@@ s@@ ach@@ sen@@ br@@ ü@@ c@@ ke , r@@ hen@@ us mid@@ g@@ ard continues to rely on coal imports for power plants and is one of the largest in europe in this sector .
the water temperature of the dec@@ k is 18@@ .@@ 5 metres deep@@ ened and ca@@ pe@@ si@@ ze@@ -@@ bul@@ k@@ carri@@ ers can be collected here .
&quot; this year we want to use the 3 million ton@@ ne brand for en@@ velo@@ pe handling , &quot; says sch@@ re@@ ll .
in addition to the e@@ on power plant on the ground , imported coal is being used as an in@@ land power station .
if the g@@ d@@ f-@@ su@@ e@@ z power station is also connected , then there are over 5 million tonnes of coal imports per year .
the three ship sen@@ ders on the bridge and the second transport bel@@ t could create up to 10 million .

two children have the murder of 1@@ 1-@@ year-@@ old in ur@@ u@@ gu@@ ay .
the two 14 and 12 year-@@ old bo@@ ys had invited their victims to join them in bird hun@@ ting .
with mach@@ ine@@ ts and k@@ ni@@ ves armed , they st@@ aged the 1@@ 1-@@ year-@@ old on tuesday and thre@@ w the cor@@ pse into a well , reported the newspaper &quot; el p@@ í@@ s &quot; on thursday .
they would then have been walking in front of their homes in a work@@ ing-@@ class quarter .
the cor@@ pse was found in the village of cer@@ ro pel@@ ado , 15 km north of the exclusive village of cor@@ do@@ ba pun@@ ta del est@@ e .
as an ali@@ bi , a fi@@ ve-@@ year-@@ old half-@@ si@@ ster of the younger one who took them with her should say that she was sex@@ ually as@@ sa@@ ul@@ ted by the young .
when the girl was mur@@ dered in front of the police without men@@ tioning an attack on her , the two bo@@ ys gave the deliber@@ ate killing of the 1@@ 1-@@ year-@@ old .
the reason given by the el@@ der was , among other things , a ri@@ val@@ ry in the football game .
he was tempor@@ arily transferred to a psy@@ chi@@ at@@ ric youth institute .
p@@ im@@ ps must be put in prison
because of the explo@@ it@@ ative trafficking in human beings , p@@ im@@ ps , threats , insul@@ ts and dangerous physical in@@ jury , kon@@ stan@@ z district court has appointed a 3@@ 3-@@ year-@@ old man from st. geor@@ gen to three and a half years in prison .
the former german soldi@@ er who was killed after two operations in afghanistan as a turkish officer , put a case to the police in a process agreement .
so in five cases , he has informed women about internet or telephone contacts , which he has after a few weeks to go against her .
he used to resi@@ st by force and threats .
the income of women , who have been ear@@ ning for them for some years , was re@@ tained .
by conf@@ is@@ c@@ ating mobile phones and si@@ m cards , it sub@@ ordin@@ ates women ’ s contacts to the outside world .
together with a colleague who communic@@ ated the women , he brought them to different bro@@ th@@ els in the sou@@ th@@ west .
he also had a number of checks carried out to control their revenue .
the accused first claimed that he was suffering under a severe tra@@ um@@ a after colleagues in afghanistan joined him in an explo@@ sion .
after a psy@@ chi@@ at@@ ric expert had serious doubts about mental limitations and thus about a limited school leaving the school to be held accoun@@ table , the 3@@ 3-@@ year-@@ old put forward a comprehensive conf@@ ession .
the court did not have to hear any of the women who were in@@ ju@@ red .
as a k@@ ri@@ po official reported , after a first call by telephone surveillance measures , at least four more cases of explo@@ it@@ ative trafficking could be identified .
the inter@@ cep@@ tions that were inter@@ cep@@ ted were highly aggres@@ sive .
in later inter@@ ro@@ gation , the victims would have confirmed their mar@@ ty@@ r@@ dom .
another witness , one of the women watching blue fle@@ ece across the body , has still not heard of it .
it is &apos; a completely broken person@@ ality &apos; , which is used to condemn violence and exploitation in this me@@ ti@@ er as normal .
the accused yesterday regre@@ t@@ ted his behaviour .
&quot; he dis@@ solved from these cir@@ cles and wanted to go to prison for a normal life , &quot; he said .
oil prices continue to rise to usd 96 per bar@@ re@@ l .
the price of oil continued to fall on friday , as concerns over a high supply over@@ sh@@ ad@@ ow@@ ed a report that argu@@ ed that china ’ s ener@@ g@@ y-@@ hun@@ gr@@ y manufacturing sector is growing .
the reference cru@@ de oil variety for deli@@ veries in december was sold in europe late in the morning in electronic commerce at the new york mer@@ can@@ tile exchange by 14 c@@ ents to 9@@ 6.@@ 24 usd per bar@@ re@@ l .
the contract fell by 39 c@@ ents on thursday , which resulted in a 5.@@ 8 percent drop in prices in october .
the large supply of cru@@ de oil has affected prices in recent weeks .
the us department of energy declared on wednesday that the us offer was down by 4.@@ 1 million bar@@ re@@ ls last week .
in the course of five weeks , the offer has increased by 25 million bar@@ re@@ ls .
but on friday there were indic@@ ations of stronger demand by two reports of an increase in chinese manufacturing activity .
this indicates a continued economic recovery in china , whose growth is set at 7.@@ 8 % in the third quarter .
cru@@ de oil from the b@@ rent variety , a reference value for international cru@@ de oil , which is also used by us re@@ fin@@ eries , is now in the ice export market .
court blocks decision on the stop and fr@@ is@@ k directive of the n@@ y@@ p@@ d .
a federal appeal court in the us bloc@@ ked the order of a judge on thursday , who had made changes to the stop and fr@@ is@@ k program ( “ stop and brow@@ se ” ) of new york police station .
the 2nd us court of appeal declared that judge sh@@ ira &apos;s decisions would be suspended until more than a rec@@ ital of the city was decided .
the judge had jud@@ ged in august that the city had vio@@ lated the constitution with the way in which the programme for the raising of and occupation was conducted .
the city appe@@ aled against its assessment and its ordered re@@ medi@@ es , including the decision to establish a surveillance body to monitor the situation of the police in the amendment of its directive and the relevant training programme .
the appeal court heard the arguments on tuesday about the requested suspension .
the appeal report stated that the judge had to be exemp@@ t from the case , because she had not yet comp@@ lied with the code of conduct for us jud@@ ges , speci@@ fying that a judge would have to avoid the appearance of par@@ tis@@ an@@ ship ;
the judge had jud@@ ged that police officers had in@@ ju@@ red the civil rights of tens of thousands of people because they were in@@ appropri@@ ately targeted in black and latin american men with the stop ban .
she appointed an external monitoring unit to monitor the implementation of major changes , including reforms in directives , training and service supervision , and ordered a pilot programme with an on-@@ board team of cameras in quarters .
in august , the city of new york agreed to continue the practice of stor@@ ing names and addresses of persons who are looking for police control to be released .
an oral negotiation on the voc@@ ation of the city is planned after march 14 , 20@@ 14 .
the stop and fr@@ is@@ k tac@@ tics have been developed by a number of civil rights def@@ enders .
controls of this kind have been in various forms for decades , but the number of checks recorded during the term of office of the par@@ tis@@ an may@@ or michael blo@@ om@@ berg rose to an all-@@ time high of 6@@ 8@@ 4@@ ,@@ 3@@ 30 in 2011 , the number of latin men .
in 2004 , four men who were all minorities brought a compla@@ int , which resulted in a collective action .
ad@@ voca@@ tes of changes to the stop and fr@@ is@@ k program of the n@@ y@@ p@@ d say that the changes will end unfair practices and will create a more tru@@ st@@ worthy and effective police force , as well as the way in which the bureau influ@@ ences are handled .
oppon@@ ents believe that the changes would de@@ ter the mor@@ ality of the police , not crime ; money would also be was@@ ted and the broader problem of a police force that has been forced to close after the dis@@ appearance of thousands of posts in the last decade .
the judge pointed out that she had not yet received the stop and fr@@ is@@ k practice .

this be@@ dou@@ in wis@@ dom was used to describe the first chairman wol@@ f@@ gan@@ g hen@@ ne as a reference to the history and fas@@ c@@ ination of the association &quot; helping hands &quot; .
on saturday afternoon the t@@ enth anniversary of the association was celebrated , which was already a significant success .
the first chairman , mr hen@@ ne , gave a detailed report on the work of the association .
he was the first time in 2004 in maur@@ it@@ ania in the ch@@ ei@@ j@@ k-@@ z@@ aj@@ ed hospital in n@@ ou@@ ak@@ ch@@ ot@@ t .
as a result , further cooperation developed , and the gy@@ na@@ eco@@ log@@ ist hen@@ ne led numerous operations on several trips on the spot .
during the speeches , pictures of the missions were shown on a big screen , so that guests of the anniversary event of the above actions could get an idea of the actions .
the club &apos;s deser@@ t vehicle has also been shown .
it is a former federal border protection vehicle .
ra@@ iner pre@@ w@@ o , the former o@@ b von n@@ ag@@ old , had proposed to replace this vehicle with a photo@@ vol@@ ta@@ ic system and now plans to build a new car at the club , according to hen@@ ne .
in 2008 , the zim@@ mer@@ e@@ i sch@@ le@@ e@@ h from ba@@ i@@ er@@ s@@ br@@ on@@ n won the hospital in ba@@ i@@ er@@ s@@ br@@ on@@ n , a mis@@ ery quarter on the edge of the capital - an hon@@ or@@ ary office .
hen@@ ne also mentioned a new mother ’ s child hospital in n@@ ou@@ ak@@ ch@@ ot@@ t .
especially interesting in times when n@@ ag@@ old was the birth clin@@ ic we@@ gra@@ tion@@ alized .
you learn a lot in africa as a medical practi@@ tion@@ er , hen@@ ne says , for example , dis@@ cour@@ aging bur@@ n-@@ out .
the political un@@ rest in the country has not allowed as many trips as planned , but many medical professionals have come to germany to work here in various areas .
in addition , contain@@ ers are regularly sent to africa , so in march of this year medical devices , drugs , association materials , hospital beds and gl@@ asses .
mi@@ ti@@ ator h@@ ans jo@@ achi@@ m fu@@ ch@@ tel himself supplied plenty of local color@@ it by presenting a new version of the album from maur@@ it@@ ania to the mobile go@@ at stable .
when his personal mo@@ tives were mentioned , he called his work in the area of aud@@ iting as a young member of parliament .
when he realized how much money was lost on the way , he decided to give the afric@@ ans a hand in controlling a budget by the people .
fu@@ ch@@ tel also stressed that global economics also requires global love of human beings .
nor should we forget that africa is closer than some think .
from gran can@@ aria , it is not far from africa .
cou@@ l@@ son set up telephone h@@ acking to check a tip .
the former news of the word editor and@@ y cou@@ l@@ son sup@@ pos@@ ed@@ ly put “ phone h@@ acking , surveillance , and confron@@ tation ” into trying to find a wrong tip about an aff@@ air of the then interior minister charles de ga@@ ul@@ son .
prosecu@@ tor andre@@ w ed@@ is q@@ c declared that the court in the old b@@ ail@@ ey had published news of the world in may 2005 a false rum@@ our that clar@@ ke was a relationship with his “ attractive special advis@@ er ” .
the newspaper commission@@ ed the private detec@@ tive gl@@ en@@ n mul@@ ca@@ ire to investigate pa@@ w@@ l@@ by &apos;s vo@@ ic@@ em@@ ail@@ s , and pursued them to protect them , but cou@@ l@@ son also called them and left them behind .
“ in the opinion of the public prosecu@@ tor , cou@@ l@@ son , who is now the editor of the emergency , is no one who stands in front of people ’ s homes and hopes to ta@@ p them in fresh action , but one who is people .
he said that emergency use three procedures to make stories investi@@ ga@@ tive research : telephone search , search , and search .
the publish@@ er is personally involved in the third method .
obviously , he knows about the second , the monitoring , otherwise it cannot be .
what about the first ?
does he know about phone h@@ acking ?
he den@@ ies that , but we say : “ and whether he knew about it . ”
rum@@ ors of a clar@@ kes aff@@ air were first heard by the feature ed@@ it@@ orial of no@@ tw@@ a , as a source of sexual abuse of pa@@ w@@ l@@ by .
a band with vo@@ ic@@ em@@ ail@@ s from your phone of at least three occasions was recorded in august 2006 in mul@@ ca@@ i@@ res apartment .
the investig@@ ators also found entries on the detec@@ tive &apos;s computer , on which pa@@ w@@ l@@ by and her si@@ ster were called &quot; projects &quot; .
in the time when the research was running , the grand@@ parents of pa@@ w@@ l@@ by received anonymous calls to help them find their way around them .
meanwhile , former chief executive officer ne@@ vi@@ al th@@ ur@@ l@@ be@@ ck and the former chief executive officer , j@@ ams we@@ at@@ ther@@ up , over@@ saw the surveillance of the movements of pa@@ w@@ l@@ by .
on 18 june 2005 , cou@@ l@@ son left her a vo@@ ic@@ email with the following content : “ i have a story that we want to release tomorrow , about which i would like to talk to charles . ”
ed@@ is explained that cou@@ l@@ son &apos;s activities in this story followed the same pattern as other important person@@ alities , such as former home secretary david bl@@ un@@ ket@@ t .
the jur@@ ors heard on thursday that cou@@ l@@ son bl@@ un@@ ket@@ t was arrested for an aff@@ air with a married woman , as he himself was being brought to trial by the accused re@@ be@@ ka@@ h bro@@ o@@ ks .
cou@@ l@@ son and bro@@ o@@ ks argue that they should be conf@@ used with others , between 3 october 2000 and 9 august 2006 , to h@@ ack phones .

the other side , too , remained tough .
the dispute announced for the end of november will now be dealt with , the chief of the association of professional clubs ( uc@@ p@@ f ) , je@@ an-@@ pi@@ er@@ re lou@@ vel , informed .

ge@@ ch@@ ingen : no absolute protection possible !
&quot; we want to involve the inhabitants in planning at an early stage &quot; , may@@ or j@@ ens h@@ ä@@ ä@@ ß@@ ler opened the citizens &apos; information event on flo@@ od protection in ge@@ ch@@ ingen .
around 80 participants had come to the municip@@ al hall to explain the planned measures , answer questions , raise concerns , and exchange ideas .
h@@ ä@@ us@@ s@@ ler made it clear : &quot; the final decisions are made by the members of the municip@@ al council &quot; .
the floo@@ ds that hit on may 15 , 2009 , un@@ prepared , were a dr@@ astic event .
a river bas@@ in investigation was conducted with the neighbouring town of a@@ id@@ ling@@ en , which is now the basis for the flo@@ od protection concept in ch@@ ingen .
&quot; the protection of as many cultiv@@ ated land as possible is the goal &quot; , says h@@ ä@@ ß@@ ler .
the basic idea is to plan the protection against a weather forec@@ ast statis@@ tically every 100 years .
climate change is being addressed by a 15 % supple@@ ment .
this is done in the specialist cir@@ cles with &quot; h@@ q 100@@ ak@@ li@@ ma &quot; .
the water mass@@ es that were brought to bear in ch@@ ich@@ ingen in 2009 were equivalent to a 10@@ 00@@ -@@ year flo@@ od .
&quot; there is no absolute protection , but a relative improvement we can achieve &quot; , says h@@ ä@@ ß@@ ler .
to protect h@@ q 100@@ ak@@ li@@ ma , you must have a minimum of 4 million euros invested in ch@@ ick@@ ens , with the municip@@ ality receiving state aid of around 70 percent .
but h@@ ä@@ ß@@ ler pointed out that it was only funding that was needed if an overall concept was implemented .
the municip@@ ality should be reli@@ ed on the participation of the citizens .
a complex planning and approval procedure would have to be completed .
at best , it could start implementation in 20@@ 16 .
among other things , the protection concept , which was adopted at the municip@@ al council last week ( we reported ) , provides for local measures to be taken in the inf@@ low of the ir@@ m river from the ha@@ f@@ tw@@ ei@@ m valley .
following the presentation of the flo@@ od protection concept , participants took the opportunity to raise their concerns .
among other things , it called into question why more dam@@ s and re@@ stra@@ int bas@@ ins are not planned to protect the place .
gre@@ g@@ or k@@ ü@@ hn , technical pl@@ ann@@ er of the commission@@ ed engineering office wal@@ d and cor@@ be from h@@ ü@@ gel@@ sh@@ ei@@ m , who presented the concept , stressed that it needed the interaction of all the measures presented to achieve the desired goal .
moreover , it is necessary to find the most econom@@ ical solution , according to jo@@ achi@@ m wal@@ d von wal@@ d und cor@@ be .
dis@@ content re@@ ign@@ ed among al@@ t@@ stadt ’ s residents , who were still in trouble , even during normal stor@@ ms , when the channel network was over@@ loaded .
the problem is known to the administration and initial measures have already been taken .
however , h@@ ä@@ ß@@ ler pointed out that the directives on channel systems are different from those for flo@@ od protection and that this should not be mixed .
the municip@@ ality is obliged to interpre@@ t the channel network in such a way that two to three years of reg@@ ener@@ ation could be covered .
the se@@ wage channels to be larger would cause millions to s@@ wal@@ low .
the w@@ oun@@ ded
early friday afternoon , 44 people were on the provin@@ cial road near rev@@ ens@@ dorf and two drivers were seriously in@@ ju@@ red in a fron@@ tal col@@ li@@ sion .
the police immediately bloc@@ ked the street completely , but could not get a word about the accident .
however , there are various testi@@ mon@@ ies that should be evalu@@ ated first .
it is clear that the 19@@ -@@ year-@@ old ste@@ ering of a v@@ w golf was going to rev@@ ens@@ dorf and the 3@@ 8-@@ year-@@ old man from ge@@ t@@ tor@@ f is coming to her with his hy@@ un@@ da@@ i .
both vehicles were combined , with the woman so hard to clim@@ b in , that the fire bri@@ g@@ ade took just half an hour to get them out of the vehicle w@@ rec@@ k .
the real cause of the accident was not clear at first .
both dev@@ a@@ stated came to nearby hospit@@ als .
the route remained closed for about two hours .
he could be the do@@ sto@@ ev@@ sky of the us .
phili@@ p k. dic@@ k was a go@@ d@@ see@@ ker , a me@@ ta@@ physi@@ c@@ ist , his nov@@ els and stories also have something ser@@ ial .
amaz@@ ingly , the kin@@ dness of the outside world : the ste@@ al@@ thy eyes , the be@@ ard , the high fore@@ head .
and so , as f@@ jo@@ d@@ or m. do@@ sto@@ ev@@ ski , with his massive o@@ eu@@ vre as founder and apo@@ log@@ ist of the russian soul , reads the words of phili@@ p k. dic@@ k as american pro@@ ph@@ et .
some tit@@ les have been published by he@@ y@@ ne publishing house , the ha@@ ff@@ man cas@@ set@@ te with the 1@@ 18 stories distributed two thousand .
dic@@ k explains america - the real@@ m of breathtaking technical progress , cou@@ pled with par@@ an@@ o@@ ia , security de@@ lu@@ sion and the belief that you are chosen .
dic@@ k had a go@@ d-@@ experience , his late books read like a mix@@ ture of the rev@@ el@@ ation of john and a computer manual .
perhaps he was cra@@ zy , drugs had added to his brain .
he has learned early that the machines div@@ ini@@ ties are .
he wrote a the@@ ology of the computer and asked what a person would like to distingu@@ ish from a machine that the cre@@ ator from his creature .
this is the &quot; bl@@ ade run@@ ner &quot; problem .
killing .
a master of science fic@@ tion .
a fantastic writer .
his stories have been written by film directors like rid@@ ley scot@@ t , paul ver@@ ho@@ even and ste@@ ven spi@@ el@@ berg .
this story is now particularly significant .
the &apos; minority report &apos; dates back to 195@@ 6 , and ex@@ u@@ des the sm@@ ell of the cold war and the mc@@ car@@ thy tri@@ bun@@ al .
the principle of &apos; pre-@@ crime &apos; is being developed here , &apos; pre-@@ crime &apos; , that is , what is now more or less official doc@@ tr@@ ine of the white house .
in dic@@ k &apos;s world , which is the same as ours , mu@@ t@@ ants look to the future - and the police are att@@ acking .
&quot; we collect individuals who do not viol@@ ate any law , &quot; says the head of the authority .
&quot; we are sn@@ app@@ ing them before they commit a violent crime &quot; .
and : &quot; in our society there are no serious crimin@@ als , for which we have a criminal off@@ ence full of pes@@ u@@ do crimin@@ als &quot; .
they assume that worst is happening , and prevent the criminal idea from being put into practice .
dic@@ k ’ s nar@@ ra@@ tive looks like the blue@@ print for the anti-@@ terrorist laws and the inter@@ cep@@ tion of n@@ sa .
anticip@@ ation of the attack : that is how obama ’ s dr@@ one philosophy and practice works .
but dic@@ k ’ s story is not over yet .
the police chief compla@@ ins that there are no separation of powers .
then the monitor itself is monitored and a future crime is transferred .
the system is rot@@ ating .
it is perfect , but it is lying .
it inv@@ ents its own pre@@ requi@@ sites .
if errors and victims are not only accepted , but are built on it .
the system creates the danger that it is fighting against .
phili@@ p k. dic@@ k read is , time and again , coming closer to the truth .
late ha@@ ff@@ ers around mer@@ kel in russia
the former us intelligence expert ed@@ ward snow@@ den may have been a little an@@ gr@@ y in the us late ha@@ ph@@ ages for chancell@@ or ang@@ ela mer@@ kel to speak in his russian asylum .
representatives of the german federal bar service could either ask questions in writing or personally address the 30 year old in russia , inter@@ fax reported to the agency .
previously , the green federal depu@@ ty , han@@ s-@@ christian str@@ ö@@ be@@ le , had yesterday been the first german politici@@ an to meet snow@@ den in moscow to talk to him about the aff@@ air .
n@@ sa rev@@ el@@ ations reinforce company par@@ an@@ o@@ ia for state surveillance and control of the company .
on a mil@@ d day at the end of august , a german police helicop@@ ter fle@@ w deep over the us consul@@ ate in frankfurt am main , germany ’ s capital .
on the instruc@@ tion of the federal office for constitutional protection and the fight against terrorism ( b@@ v@@ t ) , the german internal intelligence service , it should be photograph@@ ing the roof of the us state post , which is less than 5 km away from the european central bank .
according to the german media , the b@@ v@@ t wanted to veri@@ fy the presence of surveillance an@@ ten@@ n@@ as and the action led to a change of wording between the us and the german foreign ministry in berlin .
james cla@@ pper , us director of national intelligence , was in september insi@@ sting once again that the us has no foreign spi@@ ke .
but since ed@@ ward snow@@ den , who became a wh@@ ist@@ le@@ b@@ lower , former employees , began publishing his f@@ ill@@ ing-@@ hor@@ n to us surveillance secre@@ ts , the world has become increasingly aware of european governments and corporate leaders .
reports that the american national security agency has declared the braz@@ ili@@ an oil company petro@@ b@@ as to be a pione@@ er and that data from american cl@@ oud suppliers , including google and y@@ a@@ ho@@ o , have been bloc@@ ked by the company &apos;s par@@ an@@ o@@ ses .

if the most powerful person in europe can be targeted , then corporate governance is also potential targets .
snow@@ den has continued the intensive cooperation between us intelligence agencies and companies .
i think it is possible that these data could be used for mutual benefit .
“ germany must wake up , ” explains oli@@ ver green , president of bit@@ mi , who is supporting small and medium-sized it companies in germany .
german companies believe that the us now poses almost as much a risk as china in terms of industrial es@@ pi@@ on@@ age and data the@@ ft , such a po@@ ll that was published by the ber@@ at@@ er@@ firm ey in july .
the snow@@ -@@ le@@ ak@@ ed documents revealed , however , that there was no evidence that the us had hidden the business secre@@ ts of foreign companies to its own companies .
politicians have expressed concern that the eu should be given certain it and internet facilities and that it should reduce its dependence on the us .
companies are s@@ cep@@ tical about this .
the bun@@ de@@ sta@@ g proposed that we should build a german google .
i can only close my eyes and open them slowly ...
“ that is not how it works , ” says has@@ so pl@@ att@@ ner , chairman of the german software manufacturer sap .
if you wanted a strong european it industry , you would not have been able to let it die 20 years ago .
everything in germany is subsid@@ ised , from coal to cars to agriculture .
everything except the it industry .
nevertheless , reach and technical re@@ fin@@ ement of the snow@@ den hi@@ des have been revealed .
cl@@ oud compu@@ ting is changing a lot because european business leaders are now more aware that in the us , stored data on the people in the cl@@ oud compu@@ ting are subject to legal jurisdiction and are therefore potentially at risk .
according to a study published by the cl@@ oud security alliance , a trading institution , the commission has published a survey of the most recent data protection laws in the united states .
j@@ im sn@@ ab@@ e , depu@@ ty managing director of sap , says : “ we see a new question of customers who have been asking it a year ago – it is : where will my data be stored and can you guarantee it ?
many german business leaders believe that the latest reports simply confirm what they have already been aware of , namely that powerful business leaders are losing their most valuable secre@@ ts .
the fact that economic es@@ pi@@ on@@ age is taking place is no surprise .
that has always been the case .
“ it has been a topic for many years and has not fundament@@ ally changed by the current discussion , ” says kur@@ t bo@@ ck , chairman of the chemical company bas@@ f .
the americans are sp@@ ying on us at commercial and industrial level , just as we are doing , because it is in the national interest to defend our businesses .
the management normally does not bo@@ ast about the re@@ medi@@ es that have been taken , because that gives att@@ ack@@ ers advantages .
in large companies , employees have long been involved in the idea that taking a free usb stick on a trade fair or the un@@ guar@@ ded lying l@@ ung of a lap@@ top in the hotel room is not advis@@ able , to say the least .
ul@@ rich h@@ ack@@ en@@ ber@@ k , member of the board of auto@@ manufacturer au@@ di , says that it has been standard practice for years to present the mobile phones before a board meeting , so that they are not used as ta@@ pping devices .
the german b@@ v@@ t advis@@ es execu@@ tives to use simple prepa@@ id phones when they are on foreign trips , because smart phones are not likely to be com@@ promised .
the prepa@@ id phones will be thro@@ wn away afterwards .
there is , however , concern that small and medium-sized enterprises are vulnerable to h@@ acking and monitoring .
in germany , many of these companies are world market leaders in their respective nic@@ hes .
“ small and medium-sized enterprises often lack the experience , personnel and financial resources to effectively protect business secre@@ ts from un@@ authorized access , ” war@@ ns b@@ v@@ t in a report .
the us war@@ ns its own companies of economic es@@ pi@@ on@@ age by other countries .

parents of a te@@ en@@ ager from georgia who , in the tragic accident , died , believe in murder , and believe in murder .
the te@@ en@@ age ’ s parents , whose body is ro@@ lled together in a r@@ ing@@ er@@ m@@ at in the gy@@ m@@ na@@ si@@ um of his high school , are convinced that their son was mur@@ dered , the family ’ s law@@ yer declared .
ken@@ d@@ ric@@ k jo@@ hn@@ son from val@@ do@@ sta in the state of georgia was arrested on 11 january in a u@@ pri@@ ght m@@ at , which was behind the grand@@ stand in the school gy@@ m@@ na@@ si@@ um .
sh@@ eri@@ ff@@ s investig@@ ators from low@@ n@@ des county came to the conclusion that the sh@@ eri@@ ff was a tr@@ app@@ ed man in a tragic accident , which was a serious concern for the family of the 17@@ -@@ year-@@ old .
“ they are convinced that their son was mur@@ dered , ” said ben@@ jam@@ in cr@@ um@@ p , the law@@ yer of ken@@ ne@@ th and jac@@ qu@@ el@@ y@@ n jo@@ hn@@ son , to fo@@ x@@ new@@ s.@@ com@@ .
they would never have believed that he had died as the sh@@ eri@@ ff had .
&quot; they believe that it is un@@ logical to speak out against the laws of physi@@ cs and against healthy behavior .
they are convinced that the truth is being covered up to protect the person or person who is responsible for the death of their son .
&quot; her son went to school to learn and came back in the cor@@ p@@ ses , &quot; he comm@@ ented .
us prosecu@@ tor michael mo@@ ore said on thursday that there will be a formal investigation into the death of jo@@ hn@@ son , as a number of important issues remain un@@ resolved .
what was the cause of death ?
is his death due to a crime ?
this was stated by mo@@ ore at a press conference on thursday afternoon .
i follow the facts , in whatever direction you take .
my aim is to find out the truth .
“ i believe that a sufficient basis for a formal agreement on the matter is sufficient , ” he said .
mo@@ ore explained to re@@ porters who had initially interpreted au@@ top@@ sy as indic@@ ating that jo@@ hn@@ son was suffering the consequences of a “ posi@@ tion-@@ related sti@@ fl@@ ation . ”
but a second au@@ top@@ sy has caused another death , says mo@@ ore .
“ there are a number of questions that need to be answered or confirmed , ” he said .
mo@@ ore added if there is sufficient evidence to justify criminal or civil action .
a representative of the sh@@ eri@@ ff county authority was in the office of the county sh@@ eri@@ ff at our request on thursday not immediately to comment .
a dish in southern georgia ordered a trial on wednesday that the authorities had to watch all the surveillance videos that the investigation had received .
the te@@ en@@ age parents said they hoped that the video rec@@ ord@@ ings would give evidence of how he died .
c@@ dc publish aller@@ gic guidelines for schools
on wednesday , the centers for disease research ( c@@ c@@ c@@ c@@ p ) published a report on the development of the disease control and prevention policy .
these are the first such directives that the us government has issued , as the number of people with school age aller@@ gies is increasing .
one in 20 children in the united states now have a food aller@@ gy .
the spread of food aller@@ gies among children has , according to the c@@ dc , increased by 18 % between 1997 and 2007 .
the guidelines contain information for schools that are required to raise awareness of food aller@@ gies to teachers and staff and how children are to be dealt with , which may have an aller@@ gic reaction .
it is also recommended that schools te@@ ach ep@@ ine@@ ph@@ ron – the au@@ to-@@ injec@@ tion of the brand e@@ pi@@ pen is most often used – to counter a potentially le@@ th@@ al over@@ sensi@@ tivity reaction .
the legisl@@ ators in the states have recently changed the rules so that schools can be easily sto@@ len from ep@@ ine@@ ph@@ ron .
the report also lists typical symp@@ t@@ oms that are referred to by children who have an aller@@ gic reaction .
children may say , “ it feels as if something is on my ton@@ gue , ” “ my ton@@ gue feels like it is a little bit like a hair on it ” or “ my ton@@ gue k@@ ri@@ b@@ bel@@ t ” .
parents of inter@@ sexual children can be chosen “ gender un@@ determined ” .
germany is the first european nation to have a third gender recognised for children who are suffering from un@@ clear gen@@ ital conditions .
new@@ born children will no longer be stu@@ b@@ bor@@ n@@ ly assigned to male or female .
under the new law , parents no longer need to declare sex for such children , but can “ un@@ determined ” or “ not determined ” on the birth certificate .
the aim of the law is to take the pressure from parents to avoid making ha@@ sty decisions on operations for a sex education .
an inter@@ sexual person said , according to the bb@@ c years later , “ i am neither man nor woman . ”
i remain the pat@@ ch@@ work that doctors have created , mu@@ ti@@ lated and full of sc@@ ars .
it is estimated that one in 2 000 children die each year neither as a boy nor as a girl .
they are inter@@ sexual , a group that is included in the diagno@@ sis of “ sexual dis@@ order ” ( d@@ s@@ d ) , a collective term for people with at@@ y@@ pical ch@@ ro@@ mo@@ som@@ es , k@@ ne@@ es and bac@@ ter@@ ia .
wall@@ is simp@@ son was possibly inter@@ sex@@ ually .
understanding gender identification is still not very well developed , but the majority of experts in the us recommend that you should read the best available information on gender as@@ sign@@ ment , if you do not have a provision , and not the psycho@@ logical information .
the new york psy@@ chi@@ at@@ ris@@ t dr. j@@ ack dres@@ cher , who has focused on the problem of gender identification , said that the new german law “ bl@@ ade for a good cause ” .
inter@@ sexual children are an ethical dil@@ em@@ ma .
“ some people have life@@ -@@ threat@@ ening diseases that require sur@@ gery , ” he said .
you can assi@@ gn a sex@@ ually transmitted disease without sur@@ gery and then see how the identity develops .
the scientific data on how a child can develop its gender identity are not very accurate .
no one knows why it is happening .
it is like the secret why people are hom@@ os@@ ex@@ ual .
in a report to the european commission in 2011 , it says that inter@@ sexual people are excluded from trans@@ sexual or trans@@ gender persons .
these characteristics were reflected in secondary sexual characteristics such as mus@@ cle mass , ob@@ a@@ thy , bre@@ asts and stat@@ ure , priority treatment of sexual characteristics and sexual orientation .
the report also gives an overview of the discrimination that is affecting inter@@ sexual and trans@@ gender people in working life and the extent of the har@@ ass@@ ment , violence and pre@@ jud@@ ice of women .
do not match the gender image , bo@@ ys now have a special camp .
in the meantime , adults in australia and ne@@ pal have the opportunity to use official documents to write male , female or “ third sex ” .
in june , austr@@ ali@@ an nor@@ ri@@ e ma@@ y-@@ wel@@ by ( 52 ) was the first “ sex@@ less ” person worldwide to be recognised after a court had declared the life@@ time maintenance of a “ un@@ defined ” gender status .
german cards have a third chance of being assigned to m and w , x for inter@@ sex@@ u@@ al. this is the ministry of the interior .
in neighbor@@ ing france , gender issues are still controversial , such as news coverage .
in 2011 , do@@ z@@ ens of french members of the strictly catho@@ lic country signed a peti@@ tion that “ gender theory ” was removed from school books .
the american website ca@@ th@@ ol@@ ic online has also been contrary to german law , on the grounds that “ if the world is sh@@ at@@ tered into a new state where the gender is a decision to take sexual activity but not , then it turns .
the mother of a new@@ born mar@@ y@@ land declared to baby zone , she would find it better if bab@@ ies were born at birth to have a sex .
&quot; paren@@ tal existence is also possible without further restrictions .
children need stability and security .
histor@@ ically , children who were born with both male and female gender were treated as children .
ten years ago , medicine looked at gender as something that could be wi@@ ped out and then re@@ built .
but the ethical foundations of an operation are now being ques@@ tioned after it is now known how complex the gender identity is , and that doctors are also able to lie wrong because they do not know how the child can feel when it gro@@ ws up .
“ in the middle of the 20th century , one was called a psy@@ chi@@ at@@ ric emergency , ” said dres@@ cher .
when such a child was born , the psy@@ chi@@ at@@ ris@@ t was not called , but the sur@@ ge@@ on .
the prevail@@ ing theory about the treatment of children with un@@ ambigu@@ ous gen@@ ital status goes back to dr. john money of the jo@@ hn@@ s ho@@ p@@ k@@ ins university , who held the view that gender is form@@ able .
he used the term “ gender identity ” and argu@@ ed that social and environmental approaches to gender equality – such as parents ’ – are not inter@@ acting with the people ’ s gen@@ es and hor@@ mon@@ es , and that they character@@ ize them .
but in a report entitled “ john / jo@@ an ” , which was published in 196@@ 6 , his the@@ ories were controversial .
he advis@@ ed the parents of a boy whose pen@@ is are not allowed to get rid of when they were bo@@ iled down to a cu@@ t@@ l@@ ery and to leave his ho@@ ds and then treat him as a girl .
“ money presented this case as a successful example of a transformation , but it was not , ” says dres@@ cher .
when the boy was about 15 , he changed back to the male sex and married a woman .
at 38 , however , he did commit su@@ ici@@ de .
according to dres@@ cher , there are still doctors who would practice this model .
but in the 1990 ’ s , with the entry of the internet , survi@@ v@@ ors of these gender operations have come to the public , who “ are not happy with the outcome . ”
for example , j@@ im bru@@ ce , a 36 year-@@ old author from mon@@ tan@@ a who worked with x@@ y male ch@@ ro@@ mo@@ som@@ es , but doub@@ le-@@ h@@ int gen@@ itali@@ a .
doctors were not clear about whether he had a large cl@@ it@@ or@@ is or a small pen@@ is and were convinced that he could never achieve a “ satisfactory life ” as a man .
so its external or@@ gan and the ho@@ des were soon after birth in 197@@ 6 , sur@@ g@@ ically removed and he was pul@@ led up as a girl .
at the age of 12 , he received female hor@@ mon@@ es .
“ i knew i was not a girl , ” he said to ab@@ c@@ news@@ .com , “ i don ’ t know a girl , ” he said to ab@@ c@@ news@@ .com .
i was un@@ happy , but it was really difficult to ask questions .
at the age of 18 he should receive a v@@ ag@@ inal plastic .
but , as he was de@@ pressed and knew that something was wrong , demanded a change in his medical records .
what he found out was sho@@ cking .
i was ster@@ ili@@ zed at my birth – and no one ever told me that .
bru@@ ce was born with a ds@@ d , through which his body did not te@@ sto@@ ster@@ one enough to produce the gen@@ ital development .
after he had learned the truth , he changed back to male identity , and te@@ sto@@ ster@@ one injec@@ tions , and settled down his bre@@ asts .
the sur@@ gery has made it inf@@ er@@ tile .
today , he is fighting for others in an organization called interface project to ensure that inter@@ sexual people are per@@ ceived as normal .
but anne tam@@ ar@@ -@@ mat@@ tis , managing director of the california based company , is also a member of the ad@@ voca@@ tes for informed choice .
“ many activi@@ sts are concerned that the german decision might encourage parents to make quick decisions and give the child a chance to “ assi@@ gn ” , she declared .
we fear that this fav@@ ours intervention .
we think it would be better to have the male or female sex and then to wait .
but we do not yet know how the law will work , so we can only spec@@ ulate .
tam@@ ar@@ -@@ mat@@ tis said that her organization supports the austr@@ ali@@ an law , because “ it allows adults to be recognized as the third sex ” .
“ adults should be able to make their own decisions about their legal sex , ” she explained .
the german law is about the allocation of birth .
this is not a fight that small children should be forced to fight at this time .
if they are grown up , they can decide for themselves on their body .
but dr. ar@@ len@@ e bar@@ at@@ z , a pi@@ ti@@ ful bru@@ stra@@ di@@ o@@ log@@ ist who was a daughter with a sexual dis@@ order of differenti@@ ation and has hundreds of others in a self-@@ help group , says that the law is .
k@@ ati@@ e , the daughter of bar@@ at@@ z , was born with male ch@@ ro@@ mo@@ som@@ es , but has a ds@@ d called complete and@@ ro@@ gen resistance .
the hotel is located in the heart of the city , just a few minutes walk from the main train station .
she has a v@@ ag@@ ina , but no u@@ ter@@ us and no o@@ vari@@ an .
today k@@ ati@@ e 29 is married ; she is working at the university of pen@@ n@@ sy@@ l@@ v@@ ania as an employee in the psy@@ chi@@ at@@ ry of children .
although it is inf@@ er@@ tile , it hopes that , by adoption or a sur@@ ro@@ gate mother , a child will be able to get .
“ the law gives parents room , which does not mean that they must make decisions in a hur@@ ried manner , ” bar@@ at@@ z said .
it gives you the time to do different tests and to clarify things , giving you time before you can “ mas@@ cul@@ ine ” or “ female ” .
in this way , everything is in order – you pul@@ l the child big and you love it .
you have a wonderful baby and enjoy the paren@@ tal happ@@ iness .
and you don ’ t have to hur@@ ry up to do an operation that can no longer be un@@ done .
“ this includes children in the decision and elimin@@ ates the fear that parents are ex@@ iting because they believe that they are not going to do the right thing , ” explained she .
ultimately , the child deci@@ des on the gender that f@@ its better with him – and that is wonderful .
this will enable children to make the decision themselves .
unknown in@@ j@@ uring girls by sho@@ oting from car
un@@ kno@@ wn@@ s have a 12@@ -@@ year-@@ old in sa@@ x@@ on@@ y-@@ an@@ hal@@ t in sho@@ ts from a car .
the perpe@@ tr@@ ators had been arrested on thursday evening in gen@@ th@@ in with an air force on a group of children .
that was communic@@ ated by the police in burg .
the girl is easily in@@ ju@@ red at the left w@@ ade .
rescue forces brought the girl to hospital .
the shot came from a small car that was attached to a group of six children and suddenly stopped .
wit@@ nesses saw two people sitting in the car .
the perpe@@ tr@@ ators also went to a bus stop .
a dis@@ c bro@@ ke .
they then dro@@ ve from it .
the criminal police are investig@@ ating , it was said on friday .
until now , the police inspection can still take place in a calm hal@@ lo@@ ween night .
officials were only sent to ei@@ gen@@ -@@ ga@@ thering children twice , who war@@ ned them of fac@@ ades .
since the home@@ owners recognized this in time and removed the eg@@ g resi@@ due immediately , no material damage should have been caused .
furthermore , some sy@@ l@@ ve@@ ster@@ b@@ ö@@ ller were ign@@ ited in the city area , but there is no material damage here either .
an inhabit@@ ant of the bis@@ ch@@ of friend@@ or route reported that his car was loaded with a kno@@ ck@@ -@@ on paper and his whe@@ el@@ -@@ decor@@ ative ap@@ er@@ tures were sto@@ len .
until the police arrive , the man has to change his whe@@ el@@ -@@ shaped ap@@ er@@ tures in the immediate vicinity , so the police did not have to continue working .
living with a future perspective
wal@@ tr@@ au@@ d ries actually lives in a dream .
your house is located in a quiet residential area of stutt@@ gart with lots of green , an old tree population , nice neighb@@ ors and not too much traffic .
the hotel is only a few minutes away by public transport .
&quot; hopefully you don &apos;t have a fear of sp@@ in@@ ning ? &quot; , asked wal@@ tr@@ au@@ d ries and pointed out a f@@ at spi@@ der on the door frame .
i have been looking for a new apartment for my hus@@ band and me for some time .
but you know how difficult this was in stutt@@ gart .
the reason is not sp@@ in@@ ning pho@@ bia , however , but the concern to have the many sta@@ ir@@ ways to the house and the apartment to be able to cope at age .
moreover , since a men@@ is@@ k@@ us operation , the mid@@ 50 &apos;s has had to learn at their own pace what it means to deal with stock@@ floor handic@@ aps .
recently , a book of her appeared on the theme &apos; happy living in old age - what is the best for me ? &apos; .
&apos;@@ our apartment is the best example of what cannot be done at age &apos; , she begins to tell .
when they started their hus@@ band ’ s ma@@ is@@ on@@ ette apartment more than 20 years ago , it was simply a beautiful apartment in the middle of the green .
today , with fif@@ ty in the middle , wal@@ tr@@ au@@ d ries thin@@ ks differently about this .
but she also knows that she is one of the few people who ever addressed the subject of &apos; living in old age &apos; .
most people are squ@@ ee@@ zing it out as long as it is done .
the age always only becomes the other , &quot; she says jo@@ y@@ fully .
only when the pressure of suffering is really great can one think .
&quot; then it may be too late , &quot; says ries .
in her book , interior designers put together 17 models for self-@@ determined living in old age .
&quot; but which type of home you choose is always an individual choice , &quot; she explains .
d i e solution do not give it for age .
even those who wish to take the reti@@ rement home in tus@@ c@@ any or brit@@ t@@ any should always consider that they are also si@@ ck .
and : &apos; without a good knowledge of the language of the country , you would also agree in the dol@@ ce vit@@ a , &apos; gives the regi@@ stra@@ r a consideration for people who want to study abroad .
among their models are classic care models , alternative forms of housing or the often quo@@ ted pen@@ sion@@ ers &apos; w@@ g .
at age , everyone has his own tic@@ ks and ma@@ k@@ ings , and each one has his own f@@ at and his own .
&apos;@@ for me , such a community of living would be nothing , &apos; she means with a win@@ k .
not like a student w@@ g with a shared bathroom and a kitchen .
&apos;@@ in old age , you simply need your re@@ treat rooms , &apos; says ries .
the fact that a community of senior citizens can still function , however , is not something that the author wants to exclu@@ de .
but that must be different from the classic student walls .
and sometimes you just want to have your rest &apos; , she believes .
it is in this opinion , at least in the capital of the country .
&apos;@@ most old people in stutt@@ gart want to stay in their own flat as long as possible &apos; , is also the experience of the@@ res@@ a r@@ ü@@ t@@ ten , the head of the civil service life at the age of the provin@@ cial capital .
your service advis@@ es people on the topic of &apos; getting older &apos; .
therefore , it is older people who would often also find themselves with in@@ convenience and restrictions , just to stay in their habit@@ ual environment , which is also the experience of the foundation wa@@ ren@@ test .
there are many ways to find the house or apartment in a barri@@ er-@@ free manner .
ries recomm@@ ends all those who are interested in the re@@ building of their home or apartment in accordance with the age of their lives to get informed and not to be the first to be the cra@@ ft@@ sman .
today , there are also specialists for the re@@ building of the right age .
even in the apartment you can find some things and if you are looking for the toilet seat increase , you can find the right solution for your interior .
but the existing apartment cannot always be adapted to the age of the day and thus accessible , even if it is still so beautiful .
wal@@ tr@@ au@@ d ries had to make this experience .
the room was very small , but the bathroom was very small .
she will continue to search until she finds the ideal object for her and her hus@@ band .
before moving , she is more than gre@@ e@@ ted at her home .
the us wants to continue prosecu@@ ting snow@@ den
the us has changed its stance on former us intelligence official ed@@ ward snow@@ den .
he was still accused of passing on secret information il@@ legally .
therefore , he must face criminal proceedings in the us , said the spo@@ kes@@ person of the us state department , j@@ enni@@ fer p@@ sa@@ ki , in washington .
the recent statements by snow@@ den would not change that either .
previously , german green politici@@ an han@@ s-@@ christian str@@ ö@@ be@@ le had asked about the issue of the “ green party ” following a meeting with snow@@ den in moscow .
p@@ sa@@ ki stressed that stre@@ ams of rhe@@ tor@@ ic were those of a parliam@@ ent@@ arian , not the words of a german member of the government .
intelligence en@@ th@@ ü@@ ller ed@@ ward snow@@ den is generally invited to talk to german authorities .
first , however , he wants to know his situation .
this is what the former n@@ sa employee sought from the us did in an un@@ addressed letter , which the green politici@@ an han@@ s-@@ christian sent to russia .
the letter has been sent after a translation spread by str@@ ö@@ be@@ le :
to the competent authorities
i have been asked to give you a letter about your mass surveillance investigation .
my name is ed@@ ward joseph snow@@ den and i was previously contrac@@ ted or directly appointed as a technical expert in the national security agency ( n@@ c@@ p ) .
as a result of my work in these institutions , i have witn@@ essed systematic violations of the law of my government , which have led me to act out of moral duty .
as a result of the publication of these concerns , i was faced with a serious and persi@@ stent heat which forced me to leave my family and my home .
i live in ex@@ ile and enjoy temporary work .
i am encouraged by the response to my political action , both in the us and elsewhere .
citizens all over the world , as well as senior officials - including the united states - have made the rev@@ el@@ ations a system of all-@@ embr@@ ac@@ ing surveillance that nobody is accoun@@ table for , a service to the public .
this sp@@ y rev@@ el@@ ations brought many proposals for new laws and directives , which are based on the previously hidden leg@@ acy of public confidence .
the benefits to society from these findings will increasingly be clearer ; at the same time , the risks that have been accepted have been vi@@ sibly reduced .
although the outcome of my efforts has been demonstr@@ ably positive , my government continues to treat dis@@ s@@ ens as a breach of loy@@ alty and seeks to crimin@@ alise political expression and to indic@@ t it .
nevertheless , to speak the truth is not a crime .
i am confident that the united states government , with the support of the international community , will take this negative position .
i hope that , if the difficulties of this humanitarian situation are resolved , i will be able to participate in the responsible investigation of the issues relating to the violence that has been made in the media , particularly with regard to truth and authentic@@ ity .
i look forward to a meeting with you in your country as soon as the situation is settled and thank you for your efforts to up@@ hold international law that protec@@ ts us all .

the former kin@@ der@@ gar@@ ten in the gar@@ ten@@ stra@@ ß@@ e has sold the commun@@ e to a private person .
the local council agreed to the sale at its recent meeting in the non-@@ public part .
the building changed its owner at a &quot; reasonable &quot; price .
&quot; the community is satisfied &quot; , emphasi@@ ses ma@@ i@@ er .
the budget had eur 100 000 .
it is not yet clear how the new owner wants to use the former kin@@ der@@ gar@@ ten .
the may@@ or is right that w@@ inter@@ ling@@ en should take responsibility for the building before winter to someone else and thus no longer pay for the entertainment of the house , as was the case with heating , after the garden and looking for the garden .

report : obama campaign considered to replace bi@@ den with h@@ ill@@ ary clin@@ ton .
president bar@@ ack obama ’ s clo@@ s@@ est advis@@ ers have deliber@@ ated in secret to allow vice-president jo@@ e bi@@ den to be replaced by h@@ ill@@ ary clin@@ ton in the 2012 election campaign , according to the new york times .
the rev@@ el@@ ation is the most no@@ te@@ worthy surprise of the long-@@ awa@@ ited work by mark hal@@ per@@ in and john he@@ il@@ em@@ ann on the 2012 campaign , “ double down : ga@@ z@@ ette change 2012 . ”
times is a copy of the upcoming release of the book and you will be reporting on thursday evening on the new york times .
according to jon@@ a@@ than martin , the national correspon@@ dent of the times , the book thoroughly records the history of the efforts of leading campaign and white house staff , namely the president of the former white house chi@@ ef of staff .
the potential change was a strictly protected secret within the campaigns ’ infrastructure in ch@@ ic@@ ago and the o@@ val office .
only half a do@@ zen of the president ’ s clo@@ s@@ est advis@@ ers – including d@@ al@@ ey , former obama ’ s campaign leader , j@@ im mess@@ ina , and the former white house ’ s chief advis@@ er , david ax@@ el@@ ro@@ d , and david .
in double down , it is claimed that dal@@ ey was at the fore@@ front of efforts to sell bi@@ den despite its “ close , personal relationship . ”
in an interview with martin , d@@ aly@@ an confirmed that the government had indeed considered replac@@ ing bi@@ den with clin@@ ton .
“ i said a whole series of things that could be considered , and that was one of them , ” said dal@@ ey to the magazine .
it is important to remember that the president at that time had terrible po@@ lls , so we thought : “ for god ’ s sake , what are we doing ? ”
while dal@@ ey described the investigations as “ due d@@ ili@@ gence , ” martin told an@@ der@@ son co@@ op@@ er of c@@ n@@ n that , during the campaign for re-@@ election , considerable effort had been made to find out whether such a move was possible .
“ campaigns do not spend as much money on po@@ lls and focus groups when they are not seriously refl@@ ecting on something , ” martin said at ac@@ 3@@ 60 .
it is not clear , however , whether obama knew that his team had thought about an exchange .
martin said to c@@ n@@ n that he asked dal@@ ey if his bo@@ ss at the time was aware of the potential change .
although dal@@ ey said that he did not believe that the president of the possible change was “ aware ” , the former chief of staff ad@@ mitted that it was “ possible ” that obama would have known about it .
martin added that “ double down ” is not a defini@@ tive answer to the question of whether the political expl@@ or@@ ations of obama ’ s desk had reached .
co@@ op@@ er asked martin if he seriously think obama has not heard of the investigation into whether to accept bi@@ ds in the elections .
“ possible , ” martin rep@@ lied .
what happens to my email when i am on the road ?
e-mail actually means electronic letter .
was similar to the email in the design of the internet service , was it techn@@ ically trans@@ posed into letter sec@@ rec@@ y ?
in design@@ ing early internet services , the main focus was on making communication possible .
therefore , the basic technical proto@@ col@@ s have not been designed to provide a solid basis for a hear@@ t-@@ safe exchange of letters .
therefore , a conventional e-mail is more like an open post@@ card than a se@@ aled letter .
if user &quot; anna &quot; an &quot; ben@@ ni &quot; sen@@ ds an e-mail , the hosts of the two are connected directly ?
the email program or browser of anna sen@@ ds the mail to the mail server of your service provider in the first step .
for example , if you have a g@@ mail account , the g@@ mail would be .
this mail server sen@@ ds the content to the provider that b@@ ann@@ i uses .
on the route , the mail can be run via a number of other servers on the internet .
ben@@ ni@@ e can then call the content from its provider .
if conventional e-@@ ma@@ ils are sent along their way through the network ?
most ma@@ ils are sent several times by software robo@@ ts on the go .
the sen@@ der &apos;s provider usually checks whether the mail is a mal@@ icious program as an app@@ en@@ di@@ x .
on the recei@@ ver systems , a virus check is also carried out .
furthermore , providers check that this is a an@@ no@@ ying and un@@ wanted sp@@ am mail that is deleted immediately or at least inser@@ ted into a sp@@ am folder .
if the robo@@ ts have another task ?
on systems like g@@ mail , the robo@@ t also detec@@ ts the information that google needs to place context advertising .
if anna and ben@@ ni are informed about the next holiday by g@@ mail , google can provide appropriate links to holiday offers .
read also unknown people who are receiving e-@@ ma@@ ils ?
the like@@ li@@ hood that un@@ authorized persons will receive an e-mail is extremely low .
in theory , however , this is possible .
in companies , administr@@ ators often have the opportunity to read e-@@ ma@@ ils .
the law enforcement and intelligence services also have legal opportunities to inter@@ cep@@ t or noti@@ fy e-@@ ma@@ ils .
in addition , possible illegal compensation actions are also being taken .
is it possible to send e-@@ ma@@ ils to prevent reading ?
with an encry@@ ption according to the open@@ p@@ g@@ p standard , an email can be encry@@ p@@ ted effectively against reading .
it is also possible to use met@@ ad@@ ata of an e-mail communication with a high technical effort , so that it is not even easy to identify who is communic@@ ating with whom .
how important are y@@ a@@ ho@@ o and google on the email market in germany ?
the mainly priv@@ ately used mail@@ boxes are y@@ a@@ ho@@ o and google , according to an investigation by con@@ vi@@ os consulting in august 2013 , playing only a minor role .
while y@@ a@@ ho@@ o mail ’ s shares were last down , g@@ mail could significantly increase from google .
mother in the forest dis@@ ma@@ yed and reti@@ red cas@@ si@@ es
when his busy mother died , a man from wol@@ f@@ sburg for@@ ged a plan .
he bur@@ ied the dead in a forest - and continued to collect their pensions and care money .
to continue to pay pensions and care fees , the company has developed a 6@@ 7-@@ year-@@ old wol@@ f@@ s@@ bur@@ ger who died after investigations by the police in the forest .
first , he has be@@ wit@@ ched the death of the 89 year-@@ ol@@ ds , then he has spent more than a year and a half on the money .
now , the 67 year old must be held responsible for fraud , as one speaker said on friday .
so the man hi@@ d the woman in a forest near hel@@ m@@ ste@@ dt .
the man was susp@@ ected in may : at that time , the nur@@ sing staff were forced to accept medic@@ ation .
the investig@@ ators told pen@@ sion@@ ers that his mother had travell@@ ed to spain .
because officials have been str@@ ange@@ ly aware of this , they have continued to determine .
it came to the conclusion that the two had been living in a common flat for more than 15 years and he had nur@@ tured them last .
the 67 year-@@ old finally ad@@ mitted the death of his mother .
according to the police , an ob@@ duc@@ tion did not indicate any evidence of a capital crime .
want to have an ice cre@@ am that g@@ lows in the dark ?
a british entreprene@@ ur has the first in the dark light ice – using qu@@ al@@ ms .
char@@ lie franc@@ is made the flu@@ o@@ res@@ cent properties of the sea animals to the advantage of creating a new le@@ af@@ y wh@@ is@@ key .
the idea came to him after he had read a research on j@@ ell@@ y@@ fish and had chinese scientists persu@@ aded him to arti@@ fici@@ ally produce the lu@@ min@@ ous prote@@ in .
the ice cre@@ am re@@ acts with the ton@@ gue when consum@@ ed , which reduces the ph in the prote@@ in and reduces the lu@@ min@@ os@@ ity .
chr@@ is explains that the ice cre@@ am respon@@ ds to the war@@ m@@ th of the mouth and lu@@ min@@ air@@ e – so the more you lic@@ k , the bri@@ ghter it becomes .
char@@ lie , founder of the ice cre@@ am company &quot; lic@@ k me i &apos;m delicious &quot; , says : &quot; the product is incredible , but still in a very early production phase , and so gets you two gram@@ s of it for 200 gram@@ s .
the ice cre@@ am used re@@ acts with the ton@@ gue in a neutral prote@@ in .
when the mouth warm the prote@@ in , the ph value increases and the ice is lit .
we have tested it over the last few months and it seemed ideal to see it on hal@@ lo@@ ween .
it is probably the most expensive ice cre@@ am i have ever made , because the light source is four times t@@ ough@@ er than gold .
each ball costs me about 1@@ 40 p@@ ounds .
but it tas@@ tes delicious .
char@@ lie &apos;s experim@@ ental company , based in bri@@ st@@ ol , is famous for its unusual flav@@ ours , including beer , cheese , wine and wine .
but his latest creation is to be even more ambitious .
he says , ‘ i would like to develop an invi@@ sible ice cre@@ am ’ .
that is impossible in itself because of the light re@@ fr@@ action caused by the ice cryst@@ als .
the ice cre@@ am uses flu@@ o@@ res@@ cent properties of a j@@ ell@@ y@@ fish that are arti@@ fici@@ ally produced by chinese scientists .
ts@@ v mor@@ sum has been released after six days of the game without any point in the hand@@ ball league .
it is now , of all things , the very day that the team of ing@@ o e@@ h@@ lers will be the der@@ by against ts@@ v da@@ ver@@ den , who celebrated his first victory last weekend .
this game starts the season new for us .
&quot; i hope that we finally have our head free &quot; , e@@ h@@ ler &apos;s behavior is optim@@ istic .
at last , with the exception of the end@@ ur@@ ance in@@ ju@@ red h@@ end@@ ri@@ k blo@@ h@@ me , he has his complete cad@@ re at his disposal .
like us , it is also based on speed play .
we must therefore keep our error rate low .
but , first and foremost , we need to increase the coverage that , at the last moment , has left anything but a certain impression .
the hotel is much more relaxed , but it is also the first season winner of the north hor@@ n .
the game was , of course , a house number .
but that is why we are still far from being the favourite , because everything can happen in the der@@ by .
nevertheless , pan@@ it@@ z now wants to explore mor@@ sum to start a series .
jan@@ -@@ mal@@ te jo@@ d@@ at is missing .
for this reason jo@@ o@@ st wind@@ s@@ rus@@ h , a young a-@@ te@@ en@@ ager , who enjoys double playing rights at the h@@ c bre@@ men a-@@ ju@@ g@@ end@@ lic@@ he bun@@ des@@ lig@@ ist , is celebr@@ ating his season de@@ but .
if you don &apos;t get hot in such a game , you should stay at home .
hel@@ lo@@ ween 2013 : in numbers
when i was small , hal@@ lo@@ ween had something mag@@ ical .
my si@@ ster and i were allowed to eat s@@ wee@@ ts , to stay late and to d@@ ress up for the neighbor@@ hood .
today i am more interested in the hal@@ lo@@ ween mu@@ ff@@ le .
in the last two years , i have not agreed to move from my home to s@@ wee@@ ts , and i am sure i will not do so this year either .
but according to statistics , i am a black she@@ ep in terms of hal@@ lo@@ ween .
the majority of americans – 15@@ 8 million to be precise – are celebr@@ ating hal@@ lo@@ ween this year , spending a total of $ 6.@@ 9 billion on c@@ and@@ y , cost@@ umes , and decor@@ ations , according to the us association of merchan@@ ts .
one thing i can focus on each hal@@ lo@@ ween then is the tren@@ d@@ setting values .
the cost@@ umes will cost about 1.@@ 2 billion of the $ 6.@@ 9 billion spent , according to the n@@ r@@ f .
this year , exciting un@@ in@@ anim@@ ate objects are the last cr@@ y .
women no longer need to wear sex@@ y clothes , they can now also eat se@@ duc@@ tive food like piz@@ za , ham@@ bur@@ gers or car@@ ro@@ ts .
as for men , i expect a lot of z@@ om@@ b@@ ies thanks to the walking dead , and i bet that the da@@ f@@ t-@@ pun@@ k space foun@@ ders will not be able to put it into the inst@@ ag@@ ram fe@@ eds this year .
according to google , the most sought cost@@ umes are z@@ om@@ b@@ ies , bat@@ man , pi@@ rates and wit@@ ches .
i susp@@ ect that there is nothing wrong with tradition .
we have sold our dogs last year and were thus ast@@ on@@ ished not to my surprise .
indeed , americans spend $ 3@@ 30 million this year on cost@@ umes of their pe@@ ts , according to the n@@ r@@ f .
these are a lot of hot dogs .
as for s@@ wee@@ ts , we are not fo@@ ol@@ ish .
americans will spend $ 1.@@ 9 billion this year , according to the ni@@ el@@ sen company .
this is about 2@@ 70 million kil@@ o@@ gram@@ s of chocolate , lu@@ cer@@ ne , c@@ and@@ y and rubber be@@ ans .
so good news for the us department of commerce &apos;s 41 million people who are associated with the s@@ wee@@ ts or s@@ our phrase .
indeed , we will be able to produce over 40 million kil@@ os of chocolate for hal@@ lo@@ ween and – let us not fo@@ ol ourselves – eat .
the only thing we do not want to con@@ sume is the sweet c@@ and@@ y cor@@ n , yet 15 million kil@@ o@@ gram@@ s of it are sold by hal@@ lo@@ ween , according to the national association of conf@@ ec@@ tion@@ ery manufacturers .
that is about nine billion ma@@ ize gra@@ ins .
it is a myster@@ y that i have not yet been able to solve .
nothing belongs to hal@@ lo@@ ween more than houses where there is sp@@ uc@@ t .
they have great names like “ terror behind the walls ” ( which , inci@@ dentally , is a real prison ) , “ ho@@ w@@ l-@@ o-@@ scre@@ am ” , and “ the house of sho@@ ck . ”
there are indeed 1,@@ 200 officially recognized sp@@ uc@@ es in the united states that have saved $ 500 million , according to america ha@@ un@@ ts , and that includes the wonderful photos of the world .
but let us finally get to the bu@@ m@@ ps .
char@@ lie brown made us into a k@@ ni@@ fe when we were children , and car@@ ving a shor@@ ten@@ ed lat@@ er@@ n is like decor@@ ating the christmas tree .
fortunately , the “ baby in the pum@@ p@@ k@@ in ” trend only began last year thanks to p@@ inte@@ st , so most of us grew up with the pum@@ p@@ k@@ in to cut it and not to sit inside it .
this year , americans will spend about $ 10@@ 6 million on a short@@ cut , according to the us cen@@ sus bureau .
the shor@@ ten@@ ed l@@ amps , which are slowly ro@@ ta@@ ted in the front garden , are probably from il@@ lin@@ o@@ is , where this year 2@@ 45 million kil@@ o@@ gram@@ s of pum@@ p@@ k@@ in har@@ v@@ est were har@@ ves@@ ted .
if you want to score correctly , call ti@@ m and sus@@ an ma@@ th@@ is@@ don in nap@@ a , california and save something h@@ int .
fl@@ ats in hel@@ mb@@ re@@ cht : rescue forces are ber@@ gen co@@ iled cor@@ p@@ ses of cor@@ p@@ ses , co@@ iled cor@@ p@@ ses , and the cor@@ p@@ ses are covered with a co@@ ated cor@@ p@@ us .
the fire bri@@ g@@ ade had to be fi@@ red at hel@@ mb@@ re@@ cht on thursday evening .
a three family house in the county of hof cat@@ ches fire on friday night .
the rescue forces are a co@@ iled cor@@ pse from the house .
rescue workers have lost out in hel@@ mb@@ re@@ cht in a fire and have a co@@ iled cor@@ pse in a three-@@ family house .
whether it is a resid@@ ent handle is still un@@ clear how a spo@@ kes@@ man of the police in bay@@ re@@ u@@ th said .
on thursday evening , there was a meeting of the staff on the ground floor of the house .
when the fire bri@@ g@@ ade arrived , the fl@@ ames were already s@@ oun@@ ding out of a window .
the staff went to the apartment and found the cor@@ pse in a room .
this and another room bur@@ ned out completely .
the whole ground floor was damaged .
all other residents were not at home during the fire , the police officer explained further .
the building is not hab@@ itable for the time being .
the exact cause of the fire was not clear at first .
germany &apos;s largest regional church has launched an off@@ ensive to promote the profes@@ sion of the pa@@ st@@ or .
background is a possible short@@ age of par@@ ish : the ev@@ angel@@ ic@@ -@@ lu@@ ther@@ an church of han@@ nover exp@@ ects that the church of st. pe@@ ter@@ sburg will increase to a total of 1,@@ 800 pa@@ st@@ ors .
for today ’ s young people , the profes@@ sion is very attractive and offers good prospects , said pa@@ st@@ or ma@@ this bur@@ fi@@ en ( 43 ) in con@@ vers@@ ation with the ev@@ angel@@ ical press service .
it is attractive to keep the work@@ flow and the day to day .
with bur@@ fi@@ a , the local church has for the first time commission@@ ed a pa@@ st@@ or to ap@@ point young people for the@@ ology studies .
at present , fewer and fewer young people choose to study the@@ ology after gradu@@ ation .
bur@@ fi@@ a is leading this to the process of sec@@ ul@@ ar@@ isation : &quot; god &apos;s voice is quiet , the world is l@@ oud &quot; .
the profes@@ sion of great freedom and diversity was a symbol of this .
i am the master of my calendar and can set my priorities where i think it is important .
pa@@ st@@ ors could be seen as a sou@@ l@@ bound clo@@ s@@ est to the people .
they earned as much as teachers and could live well .
certainly , more is paid in the free economy , but the@@ o@@ logi@@ ans would have a safe employ@@ er for that .
this is something that will benefit today &apos;s young people , who are not only concerned with care@@ ers , but also with a min@@ d-@@ filled job .
according to the national church , which represents three quarters of lower sa@@ x@@ ony , about 60 pa@@ st@@ ors are currently reti@@ ring each year .
at the same time , about 40 gradu@@ ates of a the@@ ological studies start their vi@@ k@@ ari@@ at .
in spar@@ sely popu@@ lated periph@@ eral areas such as res@@ in , em@@ s@@ land and w@@ end@@ land , it may be difficult to fill jobs in the future .
bur@@ fi@@ en wants to host , among other things , study days for young people and to invite cele@@ bri@@ ties who have studied the@@ ology .
the study of the@@ ology offers a broad range of training .
you can even become president of the federal republic .
land ro@@ ver r@@ ally series announced :
the interior features racing seats and six@@ -@@ point cu@@ ps as well as a fre@@ e-@@ range system .
the options range from increased bra@@ king , a service package with support of bow@@ ler works mechan@@ ics to the logistics department .
dre@@ w bow@@ ler , managing director of bow@@ ler motor@@ sport , explains : “ r@@ ally customers who are part of bow@@ ler have decided to change . ”
you are not all experienced rac@@ ers , but people who are looking for ex@@ ci@@ tement and adventure and for an achiev@@ able way to world class events .
we are pleased to continue this path in partnership with land ro@@ ver and m@@ sa and believe that the format offers new possibilities for the various r@@ all@@ y-@@ discipl@@ ines .
we had a lot of fun to play the def@@ en@@ der challenge car – that will be a fun championship .
in addition , the def@@ en@@ der challenge has a training and test day in february and the option to participate in deser@@ t rac@@ es in north africa and the middle east .
fire bri@@ g@@ ade to save a bit@@ ch that is 15 meters above ground on a dangerous rock .
co@@ ck@@ er@@ sp@@ ani@@ el@@ -@@ bit@@ ch ru@@ by was out of service after a minor road accident .
three days later , a wal@@ ker in the quar@@ ry , in her di@@ re position , discovered her .
fire@@ men ro@@ lled on a rock wall and saved the dog from the safe distance .
the fire bri@@ g@@ ade succeeded in keeping a dog safe , which was on a 15@@ -@@ metr@@ e high lead in a ro@@ cky wall .
the nine months old co@@ ck@@ er@@ sp@@ ani@@ el bit@@ ch ru@@ by was born after a road accident on sunday afternoon and survi@@ ved three days alone before she was born on wednesday from a stone quar@@ ry .
scot@@ t al@@ der@@ son , 25 , and his gir@@ l@@ friend bec@@ ky hall , 20 , who belongs to the dog , came to the quar@@ ry fla@@ pp@@ it in den@@ hol@@ me , west yor@@ k@@ sh@@ ire to return to ru@@ by .
they had been desper@@ ate for their missing female and helped them to get help in social networks .
about 2 : 15 p.m. on wednesday , a wal@@ ker saw his dog go to the village of k@@ ab@@ u@@ l , and he was walking on the 15@@ -@@ metr@@ e high section in the quar@@ ry .
the technical rescue team of the cle@@ ck@@ he@@ at@@ on fire station rus@@ hed to the spot and ro@@ lled to save ru@@ by &apos;s from the station , which was then in a dog box up@@ wards .
and@@ y cla@@ y@@ ton , specialist in the technical rescue team , said : “ she was in a dangerous position .
it was located in the middle of the cli@@ ff – 15 meters from the top and the bottom .
she did not move a mus@@ cle during her rescue – she was like sti@@ ff fro@@ zen .
but now it is doing well .
she then gave a few ca@@ kes for the dog .
that was a rather unusual effort .
the fact that the dog was discovered is incredible .
peter la@@ u , specialist of the technical rescue team , said : “ ru@@ by had a giant accident . ”
it was possible that it was seriously in@@ ju@@ red or worse .
ru@@ by was brought to the ve@@ t to investigate , but he was not allowed to see anything except exhaus@@ tion and de@@ hy@@ dr@@ ation .
bec@@ ky hall of h@@ ali@@ fax , west yor@@ k@@ sh@@ ire , said : “ in saving the world , fear was dis@@ concer@@ ting . ”
i could not believe that she really was up there .
it was wonderful to see them back in the arms .
the ve@@ t explained when exhaus@@ tion became too big and it would collapse , it would probably have fallen .
the fire@@ men have done a great job .
it was really cour@@ ageous what you did .
we are so grateful and each of them was absolutely incredible .
scot@@ t al@@ der@@ son from ke@@ gh@@ ley added : “ we were afraid that they would fall , but they were still up . ”
the fire@@ men were great .
i can hardly believe where she was .
mic@@ k j@@ ag@@ ger explains that he never made kat@@ y per@@ ry when she was 18 .
in an interview with an austr@@ ali@@ an radio station this week , the pop star said that she had been playing as a background sing@@ er at j@@ ag@@ gers song “ old hab@@ its die hard ” from 2004 .
per@@ ry explained that she had to spend the evening with the al@@ tro@@ ck@@ er , and that “ he dre@@ w me up when i was 18 . ”
it added : “ this has been a long time ago and he was very kind to me . ”
in a statement , a representative of j@@ ag@@ gers , 70 , said on thursday that he “ categ@@ or@@ ically ref@@ uses to accept any rap@@ pro@@ ch@@ ement ever made with kat@@ y per@@ ry . ”
the representative added : “ perhaps she was conf@@ using him with someone else . ”
per@@ ry was one of the sing@@ ers who played at the ro@@ l@@ ling st@@ ons tour this year .
her new album “ pris@@ m ” was released on the 1st place this week .
george ke@@ re@@ v@@ an : european un@@ bun@@ d@@ ling gives the sco@@ ts the choice of a single choice .
a new day , a new story of terror about independence .
this time we are war@@ ned that an independent scotland is needed to help the schengen area as a condition for the eu &apos;s membership .
this is the key word for stories about pass@@ port controls in ber@@ w@@ ick and a world of bar@@ bed wire border controls along the h@@ adri@@ an wall .
indeed , in the stra@@ th@@ cl@@ y@@ de proposal , reference was made to the possible economic benefits that would mean more freedom of travel in the rest of europe , but this was – as expected – not included in the head@@ lines .
nor has anyone mentioned that eu member states often have to comply with their strict rules when it is more convenient for them .
as scotland is not part of the schengen area at the moment , the continued failure to take account of brussels would be only a small conc@@ ession in exchange for what we really expect from the sco@@ ts .
so no story .
and one that has already come in the years that you already have a fo@@ ssi@@ l : the first time i &apos;ve seen the &quot; independence means pass@@ port control &quot; duc@@ k at least 40 years ago .
an interesting point in this is the constant repe@@ ti@@ tion of this ancient history .
why should we expect an independent scotland to be able to operate under the european pi@@ pe ?
why the london yo@@ ke against the brussels one , especially now ?
these are the real european news : the great war resolution that was adopted to un@@ ite europe has st@@ alled .
the euro crisis has officially killed the european project .
across the eu , parties are gaining ground that are ho@@ sti@@ le to the eu or want to throw the euro over@@ board as a common currency .
even in germany , the euro@@ s@@ cep@@ tic alternative party could – only established this year – vote for almost five million in the federal election in september .
there has always been domestic opposition to the plan to build a feder@@ alist europe .
the current economic crisis , however , is turning out to be a turning point .
the financial crisis imposed by berlin and the european central bank , together with the stra@@ it@@ jack@@ et into which the national economy is pl@@ un@@ ged by stic@@ king to the single currency , make many people in the view that the project europe is a major project .
the euro crisis has little to do with national governments ’ excessive budget deficits – that was only true in greece .
instead , the euro@@ system has imposed currency exchange rates on its members , which are beneficial to german ex@@ porters – and that is what german politicians want to leave .
without the possibility of de@@ valu@@ ing the local currency , southern europe will find itself with an integrated productivity dis@@ advantage against germany .
the only way is to increase wages and public spending – sp@@ ur@@ red by berlin .
behind the current et@@ at and monetary problems lies a de@@ eper european productivity growth problem .
as a result of the green energy policies imposed by brussels – a code for the subsid@@ isation of french and german energy companies to the detri@@ ment of consumers – the european industry pays a lot more than the united states .
this is a cri@@ p@@ pling cost dis@@ advantage , as we have already seen in gran@@ em@@ ou@@ th .
all wage fix@@ ing in the world protec@@ ts the european petro@@ chemical industry not from being hit by cheap american sh@@ ale gas .
as a result , a re@@ vol@@ t is drag@@ ging on , especially in france , the former chief es@@ cor@@ t of the eu .
after the war , france ’ s political elite saw the eu as a vehicle for getting germany into trouble .
but berlin needs paris no more as a ga@@ te@@ way to political legitimacy , and has put europe on its own economic policy , which is what the trou@@ b@@ led french economy is strugg@@ ling with .
the result : marine le pen ’ s more right-@@ wing , anti-@@ eu front national has just won a decisive re-@@ election , thereby forcing the ruling socialists to rank three .
the front national is now the most popular party in france with 24 % of the vote – a timely warning to the british labour party , that it is not assum@@ ing that a division will be found in the right spectrum automatically benefits the right spectrum .
what makes le pen so popular with its newly won popul@@ arity among the white french of the working class ?
it wants to use next year &apos;s eu elections to launch an anti-@@ eu , anti-@@ community monetary block in the european parliament .
if the anti-@@ eu parties do well in these elections – and that is very possible – then for the first time such a block could domin@@ ate the european parliament .
this is the point i want to make : in the not too dist@@ ant future , the growing res@@ ent@@ ment against the eu and the common currency will come together to abol@@ ish the euro .
the eu will not dis@@ appear , but it will be more like the “ europe of ( sovereign ) nations ” that general de ga@@ ul@@ le fav@@ ored .
germany and some of its satellite economies may be stic@@ king to the euro , but france and southern europe will return to their own curren@@ cies .
i expect britain to distance itself from this project in the hope of joining the us .
but washington ’ s growing interest in the pacific region suggests that britain alone can achieve more than $ 200 billion in the atlantic .
where is scotland in all this ?
we can decide to build a region of ( ultimately ) small england .
or we can defend our own economic interests – including berlin and brussels , what they want to see , and that includes – what they can put where they are .
i susp@@ ect that scotland could be in a loo@@ ser european union , provided that we have our own currency .
cooperation with other similar countries is essential in a non-@@ feder@@ ated europe of nations .
otherwise , we should consider equ@@ ating norway and maintaining our economic independence .
the sn@@ p government in scotland – remark@@ ably , the government ’ s most successful political movement against the au@@ ster@@ ity policies of europe – has achieved a spectacular majority in 2011 , owing to the rejection of the proposed ( and undertaken ) cuts .
it would be ri@@ dic@@ ulous for scotland to op@@ t for independence now only to be able to demand au@@ ster@@ ity from berlin and brussels .
early pub@@ er@@ ty : grow up faster
african and h@@ is@@ pan@@ ic girls tend to achieve pub@@ er@@ ty rather than their white con@@ tempor@@ aries , as studies show .
physical changes do not yet directly mean pub@@ er@@ ty .
there is no evidence that hor@@ mon@@ es or other chemicals are responsible , and that they are not harmful to human health .
experts believe that the ep@@ ide@@ mic ob@@ es@@ ity is a tri@@ gger of early pub@@ er@@ ty .
the trend towards early pub@@ er@@ ty is less pron@@ oun@@ ced among young people .
the former c@@ n@@ n correspon@@ dent p@@ at e@@ ther@@ id@@ dge is a journ@@ alist who speci@@ ali@@ zes in child health and family issues .
should a mother be wor@@ ried if her daughter is already seven or eight years old and she has bre@@ asts and sh@@ am@@ ha@@ irs growing ?
at the annual conference of the american academy of pa@@ edi@@ at@@ r@@ ici@@ ans , the association of pedi@@ at@@ ric@@ s this week in or@@ lan@@ do , fl@@ ori@@ da , the pa@@ edi@@ at@@ ric en@@ do@@ cr@@ in@@ o@@ log@@ ist dr. paul k@@ asp@@ ec@@ r@@ in@@ o@@ log@@ ist dr. paul k@@ asp@@ ec@@ k@@ af@@ er declared that this week .
“ i spend a lot of time re@@ ass@@ uring parents – normally this is no sign that the time has come to change . ”
obvious indic@@ ations of development , such as growing bre@@ asts , sh@@ ame and ax@@ le hair , as well as body od@@ or , appear earlier in girls .
however , there was only a s@@ light shift in the age of the men@@ ar@@ che ( first blood inci@@ dence ) in the last 40 years .
in the united states , the average age is 12.@@ 5 years , slightly less than 12.@@ 75 in 197@@ 0 .
&quot; when bre@@ ast development begins , it takes at least two to three years to reach the men@@ ar@@ che , &quot; said k@@ ap@@ lo@@ wit@@ z , also author of the book “ early pub@@ er@@ ty in girls : the essential advis@@ er .
time is the most accurate test of how pub@@ er@@ ty progres@@ ses .
there is contro@@ vers@@ y as to what is actually the beginning of pub@@ er@@ ty , but it is “ early bre@@ ast fe@@ eding ” when bre@@ ast enlargement is accompanied by a growth boost of eight years .
in most cases , the process or stag@@ n@@ ant – a bit that a child doctor has to monitor closely .
if progress is faster , tests could be carried out by an en@@ di@@ k@@ ron@@ o@@ log@@ ist to avoid serious problems such as t@@ um@@ ors or cy@@ sts .
there are methods for dela@@ ying early men@@ stru@@ ation and preventing a different consequence : the pre@@ mature use of ag@@ eing of b@@ ones , ul@@ ti@@ ma@@ ti@@ tis to stimul@@ ate growth and thus cl@@ oning small body growth .
the recommendations for a medic@@ ation or hor@@ mon@@ al therapy are based on the age of the child , the development speed , the growth rate and the emo@@ tional mat@@ ur@@ ity .
psycho@@ social aspects are also important .
k@@ ap@@ lo@@ wit@@ z is re@@ luc@@ t@@ ant about drugs , but he acknowled@@ ges that “ the sup@@ pression of pub@@ er@@ ty can cause behavi@@ our@@ al problems and the feel@@ ings of girls , unlike their pe@@ ers .
the other major problem is understand@@ able : parents simply do not want their very young dau@@ gh@@ ters to have the period .
&quot; they worry about the risk of pregn@@ ancy or how they can improve hygi@@ en@@ ic aspects &quot; , said k@@ ap@@ lo@@ wit@@ z .
“ it was a sho@@ ck , ” a woman whose daughter , with ten days , re@@ members .
although there were initial signs and we were talking about men@@ stru@@ ation , it was not emo@@ tionally prepared .
she was fri@@ ghten@@ ed and ex@@ ci@@ ted by school to go home because she was the first in her group .
there are many widely published the@@ ories about the causes of early pub@@ er@@ ty .
but there is no conclu@@ sive evidence that hor@@ mon@@ es are contained in milk or other food , chemicals , in the environment or sexual health .
bo@@ ys come to pub@@ er@@ ty in a similar way to girls .
k@@ ap@@ lo@@ wit@@ z believes that the most comp@@ elling pre@@ mise is the ep@@ ide@@ mic of ob@@ es@@ ity .
he supported the conduct of a study in 2001 on girls aged six to nine who had a connection between bo@@ d@@ ily f@@ at and admission to pub@@ er@@ ty .
other studies support this conclusion , but there are many other factors that play a role .
in that country , afric@@ an-@@ american and h@@ is@@ pan@@ ic girls tend to achieve pub@@ er@@ ty rather than their white con@@ tempor@@ aries .
there are different explanations for this .
glob@@ ally , an early pub@@ er@@ ty seems to be influenced by all kinds of things , from economic conditions to climate to gen@@ es .
another pu@@ zz@@ le : although bo@@ ys have the fac@@ ial and sh@@ am@@ be@@ a already so@@ on@@ er , the trend to a full-@@ blo@@ wn earlier pub@@ er@@ ty is not as pron@@ oun@@ ced as girls .
other a@@ ap doctors stressed the complexity of the system .
the appearance of ac@@ ne and sh@@ am@@ hair is even more important for bab@@ ies and inf@@ ants .
“ we must be careful how we can prevent the real beginning of pub@@ er@@ ty , ” said dr. law@@ rence sil@@ ver@@ man , a pa@@ edi@@ at@@ ric en@@ do@@ cr@@ in@@ o@@ log@@ ist at gor@@ ye@@ b chil@@ dr@@ e .
parents should not hesitate to consult their pedi@@ at@@ r@@ ici@@ an about how to talk to their child .
“ this can mean that you can talk earlier than expected , ” said k@@ ap@@ lo@@ wit@@ z .
if you stay calm , the child usually re@@ acts well .
girls who blo@@ om early need insurance that under@@ mines the process as a normal part of life , even if they were previously thought to enter .
jum@@ bo manufacturers argue against the market in the face of large orders over se@@ ating width and height , while large orders are facing large orders .
there is a great deal of conflict between leading aircraft manufacturers over the width of seats in the tourist class for long-@@ hau@@ l flights , which is the tone for a bit@@ ter col@@ li@@ sion on the du@@ ba@@ i air@@ show this month .
the dispute is about the width of the seat , passengers are being denied seats on long flights in the tourist class – not always those to which the airlines are most concerned , but this is a proven space .
airbus this week demanded a standard in the industry that would have a se@@ ating width of at least 46 cm ( 18 in@@ ches ) in the tourist class , but the us arch@@ ri@@ val bo@@ eing is saying that it should .
the debate comes at a time when aircraft manufacturers are be@@ ating about it , even larger versions of their tw@@ in-@@ engine long-@@ range f@@ lies are becoming available , and at the event of the 17@@ th to 21st november , record orders are expected .
like the re@@ ar part of the aircraft – especially if it includes nine or ten seats – the aircraft is crucial for the specified economic results , which the new “ minim@@ -@@ j@@ et@@ -@@ jum@@ bo ” design is intended to deliver .
bo@@ eing claims that its moder@@ ni@@ zed “ 7@@ 7@@ x ” fas@@ se 4@@ 06 people are se@@ ated in the tourist class , which has 17 in@@ ches wide and thus ten per row .
airbus says that the compe@@ ting a3@@ 50 is 3@@ 50 passengers in 18 in@@ ch capacity .
aircraft gi@@ ants often share the technical details of advertising in the technical press .
airbus is now appe@@ aling to the du@@ ba@@ i air@@ show , where the 7@@ 7@@ 7@@ x , with more than 100 orders , is expected to take the race , directly to the public .
recently , the company issued an ad indic@@ ating the beginning of a new ad war and providing financial don@@ ors with an image of three people being squ@@ ee@@ zed together in a restaurant , and the title : “ would you do that ? ”
“ bo@@ eing is proposing long-@@ hau@@ l flights in seats that are closer than regional tur@@ bo pro@@ ps , ” says airbus ’ sales director john lea@@ h@@ y .
with di@@ etary changes changing , people become th@@ ick@@ er , but aircraft seats have not rad@@ ically changed .
between the early 197@@ 0 ’ s , when bo@@ eing 7@@ 47 launched the modern long-@@ distance journey , and the end of the century , the weight of the male average american has dro@@ pped from 40 to 49 years by 10 % .
the wa@@ ist range of the male average american in the 21st century is , according to us health statistics , 10@@ 0.@@ 8 cm .
airbus says that its ri@@ val is stic@@ king to a concept of seats from the 195@@ 0s , when the average body size of the newly b@@ ap@@ tiz@@ ed “ jet set ” was smaller .
airbus has investig@@ ated the effects of the crisis on the environment and the environmental impact of the crisis .
bo@@ eing den@@ ies airbus ’ figures for the size of its seats and says that it is not at the discre@@ tion of the manufacturers to decide how airlines can strike the balance between airline fa@@ res and the establishment .
the company also states that according to studies , the experience in the aircraft han@@ gs from more than the width of the seat .
“ it really is about giving airlines flexibility to make them do what they want to do , ” she said .
you do not want us to dict@@ ate to them what makes them prof@@ itable .
you know your business better than anyone else .
passengers are more el@@ bo@@ w freedom , but for manufacturers it will increasingly be difficult to deal with a subject that affects the tur@@ nover .
behind the battle is a race for aircraft orders with an estimated volume of at least $ 700 billion according to list prices in the coming decades , which will have a lasting impact on the export balance of the us or europe .
as re@@ u@@ ters first reported in july , the se@@ ating layout is the driving force behind the debate over the new je@@ ts .
both airbus and bo@@ eing claim 20 percent more efficiency per seat in their latest two-@@ engine long-@@ range design .
bo@@ eing &apos;s statements on the results depend in part on the 7@@ 7@@ 7@@ x being the largest in the world , with ten seats per row , with nine seats in the 7@@ 77 original design .
the increased cost per unit is still lower than the current 10 seat machines for each series .
“ bo@@ eing squ@@ ee@@ zes more seats into its aircraft to make it more competitive with our products ” , says ke@@ v@@ in ken@@ is@@ son , head of passenger aircraft comfort at the european airline industry .
on the other hand , analy@@ sts say that full 10-@@ seat cab@@ ins for existing 7@@ 7@@ 7@@ s indicate that many passengers are in favour of closer arrangement , which is cheaper than the airline .
“ eigh@@ teen in@@ ch seat width would be great for passengers , but the reality is that from an economic point of view , the airbus offer is very different from the threat posed by the 7@@ 77 “ , says mar@@ y .
airbus and bo@@ eing do not offer seats , but a catalogue of suppliers from which the airline companies can choose .
the world travell@@ er jet sel@@ lers even carry band@@ width to make the equipment more competitive .
even if you add comfort to your product , all manufacturers offer je@@ ts with high den@@ sity fin@@ ishes for cheap prices .
airbus offers a ten@@ -@@ se@@ ater a3@@ 50 , but it says it has not yet sold one .
until recently , airbus stressed the importance of more adap@@ tability in the cab@@ ins and of providing broad seats to the comm@@ u@@ ter .
without the support of the only other manufacturer of large modern jet , experts say that the call for a new industry standard is likely to dis@@ appear , but will be replaced by the wave of 7@@ 7@@ x sales .
new anti-@@ nic@@ ot@@ ine vacc@@ ine could help to prevent smoking from happening .
scientists have developed an anti-@@ nic@@ ot@@ ine vacc@@ ine that reduces the fun of smoking .
a single do@@ se of the vacc@@ ine could kill m@@ ice from nic@@ ot@@ ine ad@@ diction for a life@@ time .
before human tests , further tests are needed , which may take several years , but professor ron@@ ald crystal is a very good man .
“ we are very hope@@ ful that this type of vacc@@ ination strategy will help millions of smo@@ kers who have tried to stop and stop all of the drugs available on the market .
the new vacc@@ ine contains a harm@@ less virus that has been changed to contain the genetic information to produce nic@@ ot@@ ine inf@@ ec@@ tions .
the virus selec@@ tively inf@@ ects the li@@ ver cells , which then generate a constant stream of anti@@ bodies .
the anti@@ bodies hun@@ t the nic@@ ot@@ ine mo@@ lec@@ ules in the blood and neutr@@ alize them before they leave the brain .
in tri@@ als , vacc@@ inated m@@ ice that nic@@ ot@@ ine has been ad@@ min@@ istered kept their normal level of activity .
m@@ ice without vacc@@ ination , on the other hand , would have taken a “ time off , ” the researchers declared , a sign that nic@@ ot@@ ine had reached her brain .
the experim@@ ents are published in the journal science trans@@ la@@ tional medicine .
previous tobacco vacc@@ ines failed because they had anti@@ bodies .
vacc@@ inations had to be used to maintain the anti@@ body level as often as possible , and they were expensive and im@@ practical .
but the cost of the new vacc@@ ine is probably much lower , because it trans@@ forms li@@ ver cells into anti@@ body fac@@ tories .
as professor crystal said , a future vacc@@ ine could be used to treat people who are quite sure of being ad@@ min@@ istered before they are tried .
but it is more likely that smo@@ kers will use it to stop .
&quot; you know then : if you start smoking again , you will feel a bit an@@ no@@ ying about the nic@@ ot@@ ine vacc@@ ine and that will help you to get rid of hab@@ its , &quot; explains dr. j@@ . k@@ . j@@ . k@@ .
british scientists said that the results were interesting , but at the same time war@@ ned that further research was needed .
tri@@ po@@ di den@@ ies , influenced by o@@ be@@ id , has been the subject of the &quot; the &quot; .
the former labour minister jo@@ e tri@@ po@@ di from new south wal@@ es is being accused of a european public corruption investigation .
former n@@ s@@ w minister den@@ ies that the maritime surveillance arrangements are being re@@ viewed at the request of his political ment@@ or ed@@ die o@@ be@@ id , who has been conce@@ aled in three areas .
the independent commission assessment board ( c@@ c@@ c@@ p ) is an independent committee of the european commission on corruption and corruption .
now , because of the acc@@ us@@ ation , tri@@ po@@ di has been killed by o@@ be@@ id ’ s hidden interest in the land after tri@@ po@@ d@@ is had replaced former depu@@ ty ch@@ ev@@ ron ly@@ n@@ ne .
in years of talks that began in 2005 , the government had insi@@ sted on public tend@@ ers for le@@ ased contracts .
the po@@ ets were opposed to this and also wanted longer mat@@ ur@@ ity .
in 2009 , le@@ ased contracts for the companies were signed on the circu@@ lar qu@@ ay , which awarded the above $ 2.5 million ann@@ ually without any public ten@@ der .
tri@@ po@@ di , which runs from february 2006 to november 2009 port minister , originally op@@ ted for public tend@@ ering .
but he refused to accept the changes at o@@ be@@ id ’ s request , who , like tri@@ po@@ di , insi@@ sted on a transformation of le@@ ased government regulations .
one of the ic@@ ac telephone conver@@ sa@@ tions was published in august and september 2007 between o@@ be@@ id , tri@@ po@@ di and ste@@ ve dun@@ n , a senior official who was sent to the port ministry after he was under be@@ id .
“ was this the subject discussed in these telephone conver@@ sa@@ tions the development of commercial packaging regulations ? ” the depu@@ ty chairman of the commission , an@@ th@@ ony whe@@ al@@ y tri@@ po@@ di , asked .
“ no , ” tri@@ po@@ di rep@@ lied .
i cannot remember what was discussed , but that was definitely not .
definitely not between me and mr o@@ be@@ id .
israeli figh@@ ter aircraft attack targets in syria , so official sources suggest .
israeli j@@ ag@@ ged plan@@ es could have been a target on thursday night in the sy@@ ri@@ an port of lat@@ ak@@ ia , confirmed by a senior government official to fox news .
the official did not explain what the objective was , but said that it was at least one .
according to the associated press , the target was russian sa@@ -@@ 12@@ 5 missi@@ les .
at least twice this year , israel has already carried out air stri@@ kes on missi@@ le supplies in syria .
foreign workers with 4@@ 57 vis@@ as could be “ tested on the grounds of authentic@@ ity . ”
the government is thinking of a “ authentic@@ ity test ” for foreign workers with 4@@ 5@@ 7-@@ visa as part of extended measures .
if the test were introduced , it would have a criteri@@ on in place to prevent the 4@@ 5@@ 7-@@ 0@@ 7-@@ 11 being used to fill un@@ skilled jobs or to serve as a back door for the re@@ location of family and friends to australia .
today , a government proposal for discussion was published after the former labour meps , ma@@ x@@ ine m@@ ck@@ ec@@ ke@@ w , had read the government &apos;s comments on foreign workers .
“ l@@ oud statements like that foreign@@ ers should sit back and sit back ” and , austr@@ ali@@ ans first set themselves up , are a very un@@ pleasant re@@ treat in times when trade unions demanded a protected labour market , ” she told the indian institute .
histor@@ ically , it was said that white workers should be protected – and that if some in the region were to echo this historic ar@@ te@@ fact , the world would not have been surprised .
the proposal for discussion out@@ lines 12 measures that were once taken by former immigration minister chr@@ is bow@@ en .
immigration minister bren@@ dan o &apos;@@ con@@ nor , who was in charge of talks yesterday on s@@ ri lan@@ ka in human trafficking , has identified five of the recommended amendments that are being made , and others are still being considered .
if the “ authentic@@ ity criteri@@ on ” is adopted , someone who has a visa may apply for it to be checked to see whether “ the application is accepted in real cases ” .
companies could also be required to account for the number of 4@@ 57 visa holders who have been issued in the past , after companies that initially had only a small number of workers wanted to support were h@@ acked .
meanwhile , a 3@@ 5-@@ year-@@ old s@@ ri lan@@ k@@ an asylum see@@ ker probably died from a heart attack after he was killed by a refugee boat this week on christmas island .
the dis@@ rup@@ ted n@@ in@@ e-@@ year-@@ old son of the man who came with him to australia has been arrested since the death of his father on wednesday by an adult c@@ ous@@ in who is also on the boat .
austr@@ ali@@ an authorities brought the man to the christmas island hospital , where he died .
the british government has announced a study which will examine the advantages of the h@@ s@@ 2 rail project for scotland .
in the work of h@@ s@@ 2 ltd , it is proposed to start phase 1 in 20@@ 26 to provide high-@@ speed connections between scotland and the north of england .
transport minister bar@@ on@@ ess k@@ ram@@ er said that the project ‘ will bring britain closer ’ .
scot@@ tish transport minister ke@@ ith brown said that he was very pleased to be able to work with the british government on this plan .
phase 1 consists of a new high-@@ speed rail link between london and the west mid@@ lands .
after the completion of phase 2 , there will be connections to man@@ ch@@ ester and le@@ eds .
in june , the government correc@@ ted the estimated cost of building the high-@@ speed road between london and n@@ ord@@ eng@@ land from eur 3@@ 2.@@ 7 billion to g@@ b@@ p 4@@ 2.@@ 6 billion .
the british government , which has been in talks with transport scotland , has asked h@@ s@@ 2 ltd to look for further route capacities and travel time improvements for northern england and scotland .
this includes the possibility of a travel time of three hours or less by gl@@ as@@ go@@ w and ed@@ in@@ burgh to london .
bar@@ on@@ ess k@@ ram@@ er said : “ our goal for h@@ s@@ 2 is a truly national network that will bring britain and its cities closer together . ”
we are moving forward with h@@ s@@ 2 because it brings enormous benefits .
without it , we face a crisis in capacity in our rail network .
but it is also about the link between 18 british cities , including gl@@ as@@ go@@ w and ed@@ in@@ burgh , which is being improved thanks to h@@ s@@ 2 .
the scot@@ tish secretary of state , ali@@ sta@@ ir car@@ michael , said : “ today ’ s announcement is good news for scotland . ”
on behalf of the scot@@ tish government , ke@@ ith brown car@@ michael called on him to “ un@@ equi@@ voc@@ ally ” support scot@@ tish involvement in the h@@ s@@ 2 network .
brown said , “ the high-@@ speed rail link has the potential of enormous economic benefits for scotland , while at the same time providing economic strength for scotland .
we are therefore pleased to work as a partner of the british government and to improve the options for a high-@@ speed rail link in scotland , which will bring benefits to everyone and will make the gl@@ as@@ go@@ w-@@ ed@@ in@@ burgh link comple@@ mentary to scotland &apos;s government .
i look forward to discussing the investigation report with the british ministers next year and to working together to take the next steps .
regulations on electronic equipment in aircraft remain in force in australia for the time being .
austr@@ ali@@ an air passengers must continue to buy tab@@ lets and smar@@ t@@ phones at launch and lan@@ ding , despite efforts in the us to improve the rules for such devices .
the us federal aviation administration ( fa@@ a ) is a joint venture between us airlines to change their specifications so that passengers can be kept informed during critical flight ph@@ ases .
during most of the flight passengers are already allowed to do so , but many people find it an@@ no@@ ying that they are not allowed to use their e-@@ books when they start and land .
austr@@ ali@@ an societies are watching the decision to implement which us airlines have done a lot of work to accompl@@ ish , but are not pursuing immediate plans to change their rules .
the air traffic control agency casa also stated that it would look at the announcement , but stressed that the restrictions on the use of electronic equipment were not met at critical flight ph@@ ases in australia .
“ casa currently has no specific regulations regarding the use of electronic equipment on the aircraft , ” said .
the subject is covered by provisions that allow airlines to maintain safety at any time and passengers to use the safety requirements issued by cab@@ in crew .
vir@@ gin has already had discussions with casa about extending the use of his wi-fi entertainment system to flights .
“ we would welcome a review of the approval of electronic devices by casa , because we are convinced that this will improve the customer experience after we have ( wire and cable entertainment ) been released during the flight ” , said one .
q@@ ant@@ as explained that , until further notice , the current rules will remain .
“ our current guidelines provide that electronic devices are not allowed to be used when starting and lan@@ ding , and we do not currently have any plans to change this , ” explained the company .
fa@@ a rules apply to us airlines .
however , we are always interested in developments in regulations that can benefit passengers and will inform us of the fa@@ a decision and the reasons behind it .
the decision has an impact on us companies , depending on the age of the fleet .
they must prove that their aircraft are able to toler@@ ate radio distur@@ ban@@ ces caused by mobile devices , and manu@@ als , training materials , hand luggage programmes and customer instruc@@ tion .
“ after an airline confirmed the tolerance of its fleet , it can refuse to allow passengers to use port@@ able , light electronic devices such as tab@@ lets , e-@@ book read@@ ers and smar@@ t@@ phones in every height ” , said .
in rare cases , when the view is poor , the crew will instruc@@ t the passengers to remove the equipment during the lan@@ ding .
the group also recommended that he@@ avi@@ er devices be safe@@ ly placed under the seat or com@@ part@@ ment when starting and lan@@ ding .

bor@@ us@@ sia dor@@ t@@ mun@@ d announced that he would have to face hard consequences .
before the football bun@@ des@@ lig@@ a match against the v@@ f@@ b stutt@@ gart read the latest news from the german football league .
it was an unusual , almost spec@@ u@@ lative ac@@ ous@@ tics , which turned out to be a real e@@ ye@@ -@@ cat@@ cher until just before the start of the bun@@ des@@ lig@@ a match between german vice champi@@ on bor@@ us@@ sia dor@@ t@@ mun@@ d and the v@@ v@@ l@@ r .
the audience was mostly listening to their songs .
the south gallery , on the other hand , where the fa@@ i@@ rest of the fa@@ i@@ th@@ ful - and lou@@ dest - b@@ v@@ b fans were , at first , excep@@ tionally quiet : no songs , no slau@@ ghter calls .
the po@@ dium of the cap@@ o , which otherwise coordin@@ ates the joint hum@@ i@@ di@@ fication , remained un@@ filled .
and right at the front of the gallery , lon@@ ely ble@@ w a big ban@@ ner with an in@@ scri@@ ption &quot; section sta@@ dium ban &quot; .
only as a go@@ al@@ ke@@ eper roman we@@ iden@@ f@@ ell@@ er as always was the first b@@ v@@ b player to enter the place , bur@@ ned short che@@ ers .
when his team colleagues followed , there were l@@ oud vo@@ ices and swe@@ eping scar@@ ves - but not everywhere .
in the central blocks 12 and 13 of the south stand there was nothing .
the fact that sta@@ dium spo@@ kes@@ persons nor@@ bert dic@@ kel have once again experienced the positive experiences of the last few days - der@@ by victory , victory over ar@@ sen@@ al , contract extension of tra@@ iner j@@ ür@@ gen k@@ lo@@ p@@ p - listed une .
only five minutes before the start of the game the cap@@ o kno@@ c@@ ked his po@@ d@@ est - and the hi@@ ther@@ to almost pal@@ p@@ able stra@@ in with hands was removed in a l@@ oud cr@@ y when th@@ ick .
finally , as always , the south gallery was on the side - and finally here again , as usual , was the lou@@ dest place in the sta@@ dium .
and at the latest when the s@@ ü@@ d@@ ere audience was able to hear the lou@@ dly call &quot; der@@ by winner &quot; , the whole thing was again .
silence before that was probably a reaction to what has happened over the last few days .
just before re@@ vi@@ er@@ der@@ by at f@@ c sch@@ al@@ ke 04 , some of the b@@ v@@ b fans who were travelling with light missi@@ les had been taken into the audience ran@@ ks and into the square - almost go@@ al@@ ke@@ ep@@ ers .
the game was played due to the cha@@ otic scenes be@@ la@@ tedly .
b@@ v@@ b-@@ bo@@ ss h@@ ans jo@@ achi@@ m wat@@ z@@ ke had the tips of the dor@@ t@@ mun@@ d ul@@ tr@@ as then received in his office - and you think wat@@ z@@ ke &apos;s words were that for the fan@@ ta@@ si@@ es this was rather an .
&quot; it is mass@@ aged for the whole ul@@ tra movement , &quot; said the b@@ v@@ b bo@@ ss on thursday , february 10 , at a po@@ dium discussion in frankfurt .
as an emergency measure , wat@@ z@@ ke banned the ul@@ tr@@ as from cho@@ re@@ o@@ graphy for the home game against the v@@ f@@ b stutt@@ gart .
&quot; i for@@ bi@@ dden this , &quot; he said .
the zero tolerance policy on py@@ ro@@ techn@@ ics cannot be abandoned .
in addition , the ul@@ tr@@ as have been shown various possibilities for pun@@ ishment - until tuesday they have time to choose one .

&quot; this will be dr@@ astic &quot; , insu@@ red wat@@ z@@ ke .
it is important to be cur@@ ious as to how the re@@ actions in the south gallery will turn out .
p@@ f@@ and@@ haus bo@@ om@@ ing in sing@@ apor@@ e , as the crisis has arrived in the middle class .
in a p@@ f@@ and@@ haus in the ben@@ de@@ me@@ er shopping centre in sing@@ apor@@ e jan@@ ani am@@ ir@@ th@@ al@@ ing@@ a ex@@ u@@ des a golden arm@@ our@@ y , a ring and a few ear@@ r@@ ings to pay the school fees .
“ my hus@@ band and i have just bought a house , there is all my money in it , ” says am@@ ir@@ th@@ al@@ ing@@ a .
although she has 3@@ ,000 sing@@ apor@@ e dollars each month ( about 1,@@ 7@@ 30 euros ) as an administrative employee and her hus@@ band also work , the monthly family income does not go up , she explains .
indeed , demand in parts of south-@@ east asia – where household debt is increasing – has fallen so large that valu@@ em@@ a@@ x , where it has lost its exchange , has been the third p@@ f@@ and@@ brief this week to sell to the bank .
the ple@@ d@@ ging of je@@ wel@@ ry is not only a quick way to get money – 1,@@ 300 sing@@ apor@@ e dollars in the case of jan@@ ani am@@ ir@@ th@@ al@@ ing@@ a – but also almost as cheap as a gift .
typically , p@@ f@@ and@@ haus in sing@@ apor@@ e require an effective annual rate of 17 percent , which is just over the 15@@ .@@ 4 percent that united east asia holds .
however , p@@ f@@ and@@ haus offers the advantage that there is no veri@@ fication of cred@@ it@@ wor@@ thin@@ ess or income proof , which is why loans are possible faster than banks can .
this is why millions of people in the region are turning to p@@ f@@ and@@ haus , after families have been subjec@@ ted to pressure from rising living costs and increased household and consumer debt .
after five years of robust growth since the global financial crisis and cheap credit due to a lo@@ ose fiscal policy in the developed economies , families with lower and middle in@@ comes are looking for deposit houses to help with st@@ ot@@ ter economic differences .
this week , the rating agency called standard &amp; poor &apos;s growing budget debt , mainly due to rising mort@@ gage l@@ ending , as a risk factor for credit rating .
mal@@ ay@@ sia , thailand and sing@@ apor@@ e es@@ timate that the agency has the highest budget debt in asia relative to gdp .
mal@@ ay@@ sia , with 80 % of gdp , is at the top of the list , a 60 % increase in 2008 .
econom@@ ists are also concerned about the high level of consumer debt in thailand , which was just about to emerge from a technical recession this week .
on thursday , the data showed a continuing export check and a drop in consumer demand .
“ in the end , this means that , with costs rising , people in the middle to lower segment ( the income scale ) will try to raise their income , where they are possible . ”
historic high@@ s in gold prices over the past two years have rever@@ sed the trend to ple@@ d@@ ging personal items , as people have taken the opportunity to buy the je@@ wel@@ ry of the family in cash .
in sing@@ apor@@ e , about 70 percent of the ple@@ d@@ ged items are sold in the 200 pa@@ th@@ ways of the city state of gold .
people say : “ the price of gold looks good , let us be grand@@ mother ’ s gold chain and next month get back . ”
the largest th@@ ai p@@ f@@ and@@ haus operator , eas@@ y@@ money , has a 20@@ -@@ percent share of customers in its branches in the last few months .
growth in the deposit business is so strong that valu@@ em@@ a@@ x , the operator of the branch in b@@ end@@ ec@@ e@@ er and 15 others in sing@@ apor@@ e , is not only investing in neighbouring mal@@ ay@@ sia – where the company wants to expand – where it .
the company finances 60 percent of sing@@ apor@@ e ’ s $ 66 million , which it will be able to raise this week with the sing@@ apor@@ e stock exchange .

rescue package of over 3@@ 25 million austr@@ ali@@ an dollars for tas@@ man@@ ian health services
the austr@@ ali@@ an government insi@@ sts on the tough conditions imposed by the b@@ ail@@ out of more than 3@@ 25 million austr@@ ali@@ an dollars for tas@@ man@@ ian health care , to ensure that the world ’ s government does not lose the country ’ s money .
federal minister for health t@@ any@@ a pl@@ on@@ se@@ k announced that the comm@@ on@@ wealth will be called “ immediate action ” to a@@ ver@@ t a crisis caused by an ag@@ eing population of the island state , a higher quota of chr@@ onic diseases .
funding for a period of four years was established after government consul@@ tations with independent tas@@ man@@ ian member andre@@ w wil@@ ki@@ e .
“ the government has launched an emergency rescue package , which will , in our view , meet the unique challenges facing the federal state .
the d@@ d@@ l@@ r 3@@ 25 million package is worth $ 31 million in emergency aid for electoral services .
with a further 26@@ 00 operations , including or@@ tho@@ pe@@ dic interven@@ tions and treatments for gre@@ y star , resi@@ du@@ es are to be elimin@@ ated .
there is also money for day clin@@ ics in ho@@ b@@ art and laun@@ ce@@ ston , better post-@@ sta@@ tionary care after stays that are fac@@ har@@ t training , services in the area of mental health and the introduction of a system of electronic communication .
“ these investments are in line with the ideas that i have been told by hospital workers that they are the best way to improve the tas@@ man@@ ian health system , ” said t@@ any@@ a pl@@ on@@ se@@ k .
the minister insi@@ sted on a strict reporting and accountability of the tas@@ man@@ ian government .
the state must maintain the current level of funding to get money from the comm@@ on@@ wealth , and monthly payments to the state to help finance the additional money .
a commission of three will be set up to ensure that the state provides health services as effectively and efficiently as possible .
as wil@@ ki@@ e said today , the $ 3@@ 25 million would be of little use if “ it were not accompanied by genuine reforms that would strengthen tas@@ man@@ ian public health systems in a more sustainable way . ”
despite this , he p@@ raised the government for respon@@ ding to its request for urgent help , which he first asked the prime minister at the beginning of may .
“ i am confident that federal aid will make a major contribution to improving the public health system of the state from the list of wor@@ ries , ” said wil@@ ki@@ e .
according to the government of the state , these electoral benefits will largely compens@@ ate for the recent cuts .
but the opposition ’ s public health spo@@ kes@@ man , peter du@@ tt@@ on , believes that today ’ s announcement is only a “ pl@@ aster solution . ”
“ we are in the current situation because the government of the la@@ b has with@@ drawn $ 4@@ 30 million from the health system , ” he said to ab@@ c tv .
it is unacceptable that a government should spend nearly half a billion dollars out of the system and that the comm@@ on@@ wealth should be able to invest 300 million and then do so as if the good news were good news .
du@@ tt@@ on called upon pl@@ liber@@ se@@ k to guarantee that not a single dollar of the rescue package would be spent on additional bureaucracy .

syria has a chance to make chemical weapons , such as a surveillance group , and a security group , which has been established by a surveillance group , including a security group , to prevent the use of weapons .
syria has important facilities for the manufacture of chemical weapons and g@@ it gas am@@ m@@ uni@@ tion , declared the global chemical and chemical weapons monitoring group on thursday , while it is building severe collap@@ ses in the north of the country near one of the sites .
also on thursday , a sy@@ ri@@ an acti@@ vis@@ t group announced that more than 1@@ 20@@ ,000 people have been living in the country since the civil war began soon three years ago .
the announcement by the organisation for the prohibi@@ tion of chemical weapons ( op@@ c@@ w ) came one day before the date of the day before the date of the day on 6 february .
1 november , which the h@@ ague based organisation , dam@@ as@@ c@@ us , set to use all facilities for the manufacture of chemical weapons .
the conclusion of this process , which is essentially the first stage of destruction , is an important mil@@ est@@ one in an ambitious timetable that is ge@@ ared towards destro@@ ying all chemical weapons of syria by mid-@@ 20@@ 14 .
the destruction of the facilities means that syria will no longer be able to produce new chemical weapons .
dam@@ as@@ c@@ us , however , must begin to exploit existing weapons and supplies .
sup@@ pos@@ ed@@ ly , there are about 1@@ ,000 tonnes of chemicals and weapons in the country , including mu@@ st@@ ard gas and ner@@ ve gas sar@@ in .
the announcement came at a time when batt@@ les were taking place in the city of sa@@ fir@@ a on thursday , by experts saying that there is a production facility for chemical weapons and storage facilities , such as those in the united kingdom .
the group of activi@@ sts who have been arrested by a network of activi@@ sts in syria declared the death of their people on thursday , 1@@ 20@@ ,@@ 2@@ 96 .
of these , 6@@ 1,@@ 0@@ 67 civili@@ ans , including 6@@ ,@@ 3@@ 65 children , were killed .
on the government side , 2@@ 9@@ ,@@ 9@@ 54 of them were owned by president bas@@ ha@@ r as@@ sad &apos;s army , 18@@ ,@@ 6@@ 78 were govern@@ ment@@ -@@ friendly figh@@ ters and 18@@ 7 leban@@ ese hi@@ z@@ bol@@ lah mil@@ i@@ ti@@ as .
also among the dead are 2,@@ 20@@ 2 deser@@ ted army soldiers and 5@@ ,@@ 3@@ 75 opposition figh@@ ters , many of them foreign@@ ers .
on 25 july , the un estimated the number of deaths in this conflict since march 2011 at 10@@ 0,000 .
this number has not been updated .
the conflict has led to around two million refugees from the country .
as@@ sad ’ s troops have been fighting for weeks in sa@@ fir@@ a against the re@@ be@@ ls , many of whom have links to al-@@ q@@ a@@ ed@@ a groups .
the observ@@ atory said that there were losses on both sides on thursday , but it did not mention details .
the fighting under@@ lines the danger posed by the chemical weapons inspec@@ tors , because their mission to liber@@ ate syria from its tox@@ ic weapons ar@@ sen@@ al is a race against the time in the middle of a dead@@ ly civil war .
according to the op@@ c@@ w , which co@@ operates closely with the united nations , the team is “ now convinced that it will be able to implement all the important production and mix@@ ing / filling facilities that syria has mentioned and experience their destruction . ”
therefore , “ no further inspection activities are planned at the moment . ”
at the beginning of the week , the inspec@@ tors said they had completed the first round of reviews and that they had completed 21 of the 23 sites mentioned by dam@@ as@@ c@@ us .
because of security concerns , it was not possible to visit two institutions , the inspec@@ tors said .
on thursday , the op@@ wc declared that the two sites were “ abandoned ” according to sy@@ ri@@ an statement , and the objects of the chemical weapons program that exist there had been transferred to other named facilities that were in@@ sp@@ ected . ”
it was not immediately clear whether the site in sa@@ fir@@ a was one of the two facilities that the op@@ c@@ w inspec@@ tors could not visit .
syria has a plan for the complete destruction of its chemical weapons , which will be approved next month by the op@@ wc executive committee .
&quot; i am taking care of the bra@@ very and courage that they all have in ful@@ filling the challenging challenges of the world .
for three years now , the mainly sun@@ ni muslim re@@ be@@ ls have been fighting as@@ sad ’ s government and security forces in this civil war , which has killed many al@@ a@@ wi@@ tes .
in view of further developments , the head of the observ@@ atory , ram@@ i ab@@ dur@@ ra@@ h@@ man , said that there was a strong explo@@ sion in a sy@@ ri@@ an coastal province of lat@@ ak@@ ia on wednesday .
the cause of the explo@@ sion is not known , he explained .
an@@ ger at the jud@@ g@@ ement of bal@@ i bom@@ bers
survi@@ v@@ ors and rela@@ tives of the 20@@ 2 people who died in 2002 at the bal@@ i bom@@ bing were re@@ acted by the an@@ gr@@ y people at the judgment of the last of the in@@ sti@@ g@@ ators who was brought to justice .
pa@@ te@@ k , who has been elected as one of the most sought after people in south-@@ east asia for just under ten years , was awarded yesterday for his role in building war@@ heads for the bom@@ bing .
by sus@@ pending a penalty , he could be released after 15 years .
the 4@@ 5-@@ year-@@ old was found guil@@ ty of mass murder because of the attack on two night@@ clubs in the popular tourist area of ku@@ ta , near which 20@@ 2 people died .
a guil@@ ty sentence was also found in a series of terrorist charges , including a wave of sp@@ ur@@ ious explo@@ si@@ ves .
the prosecu@@ tor had been charged a life sentence , even if it was not applicable to the man who was convic@@ ted of being a master bom@@ b buil@@ der because of his reputation as a “ demo@@ li@@ tion man ” .
the decision has pain@@ ful mem@@ ories of june cor@@ te@@ en , a mother of per@@ th who had her 39 years old tw@@ ins .
fighting te@@ ars she said pa@@ te@@ k had become the dead .
i really think he should be in the foot@@ steps of the other gu@@ ys .
&quot; you should protect him from a sho@@ oting command , &quot; said cor@@ te@@ en , a former a@@ ap officer .
i have to live every day with the fact that i will not get any more grand@@ children and i will never see my dau@@ gh@@ ters again .
the sar@@ i club was made to the ground when the first club was opened shortly after 11 p.m. on 12 october 2002 in a small v@@ ent that was destroyed before the night club .
peter hu@@ gh@@ es was in pad@@ dy &apos;s bar where he was a su@@ ici@@ de bom@@ ber just 20 seconds earlier , a man with explo@@ si@@ ves filled up a back@@ pack .
he fell in love with the com@@ a for a month after the attack and died three times while he was working on a life preser@@ vation system .
hu@@ gh@@ es said pa@@ te@@ k deser@@ ved the same fate as the three other members of the terrorist cell j@@ em@@ a@@ ah islam@@ i@@ ah – am@@ ro@@ zi , mu@@ kh@@ las , and i@@ ma@@ m sam@@ u@@ dr@@ a – who were responsible for the death .
really , this type should be given the death penalty before all the others .
keep it alive – no , there is no reason to keep it alive .
to get 20 years after he killed 20@@ 2 people and in@@ ju@@ red many hundreds is not much .
pa@@ te@@ k is the last of the bal@@ i bom@@ bers who stood in court .
he es@@ cap@@ ed almost a decade of arrest , but was eventually arrested in january 2011 in the pa@@ ki@@ stan@@ i city of ab@@ bot@@ tab@@ ad , where us forces were att@@ acked by former al-@@ q@@ a@@ ed@@ a leader os@@ ama b@@ in sam@@ a just four months later .
during the negotiation , a f@@ bi agent said that intelligence reports would in@@ sp@@ ire that the government had not been able to engage in military action .
“ he did not stand up , ” said cor@@ te@@ en .
until recently , he has not shown any re@@ mor@@ se at how much suffering he has inf@@ lic@@ ted on other people .
the judgment was issued before the ten@@ -@@ year anniversary of the attack this year , which coinci@@ ded with comm@@ em@@ or@@ ations in bal@@ i and australia .
“ this year there will be many te@@ ars , ” said cor@@ te@@ en .
pa@@ te@@ k may appeal against his judgment .
fa@@ a : passengers can now use electronic equipment in aircraft ( but do not have mobile phone calls ) .
air passengers can now travel from the departure to the lan@@ ding for reading , working , playing , listening to music and watching movies that are not compatible with the mobile phone .
but passengers should not expect these changes to be implemented immediately .
how quickly they would be implemented depends on the airline concerned , fa@@ a staff michael hu@@ er@@ ta explained on a press conference .
the airlines must prove to the fa@@ a that aircraft comply with the new guidelines and that they have read the airline staff training manu@@ als and the rules on the sto@@ wage of equipment in accordance with the new rules .
the fa@@ a stated that it had already received plans from some airlines that would allow the use of port@@ able electronic devices in aircraft .
among these airlines were del@@ ta and j@@ et@@ blue .
“ depending on the state of the plan , we could very soon approve the extended use of electronic devices , ” said fa@@ a in a statement .
at present , passengers need to purchase smar@@ t@@ phones , tab@@ lets , and other devices when the aircraft doors are closed .
you may not re@@ start them until the aircraft reach@@ es a height of three kilometres and the captain has given the green light .
the hotel must be at least 18 months from the date of arrival and must not be re@@ sumed before the aircraft has lan@@ ded .
under the new directives , airlines whose aircraft are insu@@ red against electronic distur@@ ban@@ ces could allow their passengers to use the equipment even when they are on the start , lan@@ ding and rolling field , the fa@@ a declared .
most new commercial aircraft and other aircraft that are used for the use of wi-fi in larger hei@@ ghts are now available in the us .
la@@ ura gl@@ ading , president of the professional cab@@ in professional , welcomed the changes .
“ if the new regulation is safe@@ ly implemented – and we are working closely with the airline in this respect – both sides will benefit from it , ” said gl@@ ading .
we are frank@@ ly ti@@ red of being like a little more pas@@ sive on this issue .
however , internet connections for surfing , e-@@ ma@@ ils , text messages or downloading data were kept below three kilometres , explained the reason why the agency was not allowed to do so .
passengers are asked to purchase smar@@ t@@ phones , tab@@ lets and other devices in flight mode .
so still no words with friends , which sc@@ ra@@ bb@@ ble res@@ emb@@ les online game , which the look of actor al@@ ec bal@@ d@@ win 2011 is on his smar@@ t@@ phone , as he was public@@ ity effective .
and he@@ avi@@ er devices such as lap@@ top@@ s must continue to be sto@@ wed , as there is a risk of in@@ jury here if they fly through the cab@@ in .
mobile phone calls during the flight are also prohibited .
the regulatory competence for telephone calls lies with the federal communications commission ( f@@ c@@ c ) , not with the f@@ a .
fa@@ a may lift a ban on certain electronic devices when they start and lan@@ ding on the market .
last month mark ro@@ sen@@ ker of the national transportation safety authority said : &quot; safety board , safety experts for national transport issues on c@@ bs news , mobile phones would still be regarded as a risk .
“ mobile phones are really a problem , not only because they potentially cause distur@@ ban@@ ces in navigation devices , but because we are aware of the f@@ cc that the transmission from the air also trans@@ mitting po@@ les can distur@@ b ” , says .
a consulting committee of the industry , which is appointed by the fa@@ a to examine this issue , recommended that the commission should examine the issue last month .
in recent years , pressure on the fa@@ a has increased , restrictions on use have been relaxed .
cri@@ tics like the democratic sen@@ ator cla@@ ire mc@@ cas@@ k@@ ill of mis@@ sour@@ i argue that there is no valid european security policy .
the restrictions are also increasingly difficult to en@@ force , because the use of the equipment has become om@@ ni@@ present .
some studies have said that up to one third of passengers are prevented from swit@@ ching off the unit or are ignored .
the fa@@ a began in 196@@ 6 to ban the use of electronic equipment by air passengers after reports of distur@@ ban@@ ces in navigation and communication equipment were published by passengers .
new aircraft are much more dependent on electrical systems than previous generations of aircraft , but they are also designed and built in the way approved by the fa@@ a to be offered electronic inter@@ ference .
airlines have been offering passengers wi-fi internet access for several years now , when the flight is reached .
the software adapted to wi-fi systems is designed to be in@@ sensitive to the inter@@ ference of the aircraft .
the vast majority of passenger aircraft should be used for the greater use of electronic equipment under the new directives , said hu@@ er@@ ta .
today &apos;s electronic devices generally give much less radio radiation than previous generations .
e-@@ reader , for example , only give off minimal radiation when you sc@@ roll around .
however , when downloading or sending data , the transfer values are stronger .
those who advoc@@ ate eas@@ ing restrictions on equipment use are also ad@@ voca@@ tes of the am@@ az@@ on@@ .@@ com@@ .
in 2011 , corporate employees were lu@@ cky to have a passenger aircraft full of kin@@ dle e-@@ reader and made a test flight to identify problems , but could not detec@@ t any problems .
members of the fa@@ a advisory committee expressed mixed feel@@ ings , which is a risk to the use of equipment .
dou@@ gl@@ as kid@@ d of the passenger association national association of airline passengers said that he was of the opinion that the dis@@ ru@@ ption caused by the equipment was real , even if the risk was minimal .
other committee members said that there was only a few reports from pil@@ ots who had been forced to dis@@ ru@@ pt aircraft systems by the equipment .
the committee recommended that the fa@@ a should not allow pil@@ ots to be inter@@ cep@@ ted by the police in poor vi@@ sibility .
a group from the travel industry welcomed the changes and called them a reasonable adjustment for travellers who are now heavily involved in technology .
“ we are pleased that the fa@@ a recogn@@ iz@@ es that a pleasant passenger experience does not conflict with safety , ” said ro@@ ger do@@ w , ceo of the u.s. travel association .
by air rescue service from north sea bo@@ hr@@ island ge@@ re@@ t@@ te@@ ter vo@@ gel released again .

col@@ in se@@ d@@ don , head of the center , said , “ this pur@@ ple was probably a winter zu@@ g@@ sp@@ ho@@ gel from northern europe , which was destroyed by the strong win@@ ds over the north sea . ”

is europe ’ s elite ready to do business with britain ?
business for britain was founded in april with the intention of bringing the economy together and defining what the people who are in britain are doing for prosperity and work .
to this end , we have prepared the largest and most comprehensive survey among british economic leaders and asked them what they think about britain , the economy , and the eu .
you@@ go@@ v asked about 1@@ ,000 execu@@ tives from the economy who were roughly the uk ’ s corporate size , sectors , and regions .
the results of the survey will surprise many .
we have found that the vast majority of companies are now ex@@ ported outside europe and concentrated on countries that need to modern@@ ise and grow while the states in the eu are stag@@ n@@ ating .
they want a new trade connection to be established by government agencies with countries such as china , india and brazil , rather than dealing with the long and ex@@ hau@@ sting process that has been ob@@ sc@@ ure eu institutions .
asked for your opinion on certain legally regulated issues – from anti@@ trust law to product legislation – the majority of economic leaders believe that the control of these key competences should be transferred to west@@ min@@ ster .
there was general dis@@ satisfaction about the internal market , because , according to companies , the costs of the brussels rules now out@@ wei@@ gh the advantages of being part of europe ’ s trade zone – even 40 % of the big companies agreed .
finally , and this is probably the most important thing to say , our survey of economic leaders showed that a clear majority wanted britain to change course towards the agreement and to establish a relationship with the eu based on trade , not politics .
this recognition , which has proved to be a common oc@@ curren@@ ce among companies of all sizes and leading corpor@@ ations , shows that the economy is pressing for “ meaning@@ ful change ” that brings the sti@@ t@@ ching of action back to britain .
there is a lot – a change in the agreement and better conditions for britain would lead to a 16 % change in opinion in favour of staying in the eu in a referendum .
the prime minister should have no doubt : this survey shows that the british economy is lag@@ ging behind its plan for the re@@ negotiation of the british conditions for eu membership .
it also shows that companies are moving from re@@ negotiation to a significant shift in power relations back to britain .
a better deal for the british economy is possible and increasingly necessary after the eurozone has reco@@ vered toward a closer economic and monetary union .
priority must be given to jobs and growth in the united kingdom , as the result of our survey shows what a stronger focus on trade and a fundamental change in the brussels approach to regulation means for businesses .
alex@@ e@@ i mill@@ er of ga@@ z@@ pro@@ m calls the pipel@@ ine in bulgaria the beginning of a new gas era .
the construction of the south stream pipel@@ ine in bulgaria is starting with one of the largest european energy projects , the ga@@ z@@ pro@@ m forec@@ ast board declared .
“ today ’ s event is a mil@@ est@@ one : construction work on the bulg@@ arian section of the south stream gas pipel@@ ine , the largest and most important project in europe , has begun , ” said the ceo of ga@@ z@@ pro@@ m .
the project is a key element in the energy security of the entire european continent .
south stream is to be used to promote greater diversity in russia &apos;s export routes through europe .
a contract dispute between ga@@ z@@ pro@@ m and his counter@@ parts in ukraine , where the majority of russian gas is produced for europe , is worrying about a greater risk of gas short@@ ages in conventional routes , as was pointed out by official sources .
mill@@ er said the direct connection to bulgaria , a member of the european union , means that the countries linked to transit countries will be “ open for ever ” .
bulg@@ arian consumers receive gas from south stream at dis@@ coun@@ ted rates if the entire project is put into operation in 20@@ 15 .
according to ga@@ z@@ pro@@ m , construction work in other secondary countries is to be carried out on the planned route by the end of the year .
the pipel@@ ine is scheduled for an annual capacity of 6@@ 2.@@ 3 billion cu@@ b@@ ic metres of natural gas .

hearing before the royal commission : two y@@ m@@ ca staff before alleg@@ ations against jon@@ a@@ than lord for sexual har@@ ass@@ ment .
two y@@ m@@ ca employees from new south wal@@ es ( n@@ s@@ w ) are in prison for sexual off@@ ences against children .
but the opening declaration before the commission , the y@@ m@@ ca said that it was ‘ never able to speak with an incident of sexual kin@@ dness in the organisation ’ .
phil@@ li@@ p h@@ are , managing director , was asked about a case in which a y@@ m@@ ca employee was charged with child por@@ no@@ graphy for off@@ ences , and another one in which a sports teacher was a y@@ m@@ ca teacher .
h@@ are said ga@@ il fur@@ ness , one of the assi@@ sting lawyers in the commission , that he knew of the first case , but that he did not know the second .
he ad@@ mitted that the opening declaration of the y@@ m@@ ca to the commission was also in@@ accurate in claim@@ ing that ‘ there were external inspec@@ tions of the y@@ m@@ ca , in which the y@@ m@@ ca was considered to be the fore@@ front of child security ’ .
evidence before the commission shows , rather , that the y@@ m@@ ca has been informed that it is the secon@@ d-@@ lowest assessment of four possible in a quality audit of the department of education and communication .
h@@ are , who was born at the y@@ m@@ ca with 21 , ad@@ mitted that the management had “ been down@@ ward from me ” in the setting of lord and not ensured that he was a member of staff who knew about their obligations .
lord was arrested at the beginning of the year for sexual off@@ ences against 12 bo@@ ys during his two years of work for the y@@ m@@ ca .
he was sent@@ enced to at least six years in prison .
h@@ are , however , dis@@ agreed that the y@@ m@@ ca had a cultural problem that prevented employees from becoming lor@@ ds ’ off@@ ences in respect of the safety of children .
the staff said they had observed violations , including that lor@@ d alone had children .
dani@@ elle oc@@ k@@ well , whose chief lord was lord and who asked for a training on child protection because she was not a child because of his behaviour , said that she was not a child service director .
the managing director explained that he would not accept statements from employees that they had not d@@ ared to give their superior notification .
instead , he said , he was more keen to show his friend@@ ship with lord to the lord , which is why they had not reported him .
h@@ are explained that he has been a member of the board of y@@ m@@ ca n@@ s@@ w that the lesson the organization has learned from the “ jon@@ a@@ than lor@@ d interim incident ” is not a good one .
h@@ are said that the decision to ask employees to sign confid@@ enti@@ ality obligations shortly after the alleg@@ ations have been made was taken by the managing director of the y@@ m@@ ca children ’ s services , li@@ am wh@@ it@@ ley .
he said that this should prevent the contam@@ ination of the evidence , but that is ‘ over@@ ze@@ al@@ ous ’ and badly implemented .
the y@@ m@@ ca n@@ s@@ w was in the time when jon@@ a@@ than lord was there between 2009 and 2011 , not safe organization for children , professor k@@ ev@@ in ste@@ ph@@ en small@@ bone of the gri@@ ff@@ ith university .
he explained that there are “ serious problems ” in recru@@ iting , checking , en@@ ro@@ l@@ ment , training , and supervision of employees .

ton@@ y bla@@ ir said that he would miss the chance to return as british prime minister – ad@@ mit@@ tedly , a com@@ e@@ back is unlikely .
in an interview this evening on the occasion of the fifth anniversary of his leaving office , the president of the 5@@ 9-@@ year-@@ old announced his views on various domestic issues .
since his re@@ sign@@ ation in june 2007 , after a decade of leader , bla@@ ir has largely avoided commit@@ ting himself to british politics , and his comments have mostly been directed toward foreign policy and his role as en@@ vo@@ y to the quar@@ tet .
when asked if he would like to enter the post of prime minister , bla@@ ir was elected by the evening standard of london , saying that he was “ yes , sure , but it is unlikely that he will . ”

the k@@ n@@ ir@@ ps , which is not even in the kin@@ der@@ gar@@ ten and only a few months ago has made its first steps , and its sh@@ et@@ land pon@@ y to@@ ff@@ ee loo@@ sely tr@@ acked through the three roun@@ ds and pic@@ ked up the first .
the un@@ broken couple , both equal size , were named after the one who was the first to perform their duties and style in the annual competition that was held by sun@@ ny@@ bank equ@@ e@@ strian centre in ru@@ dry .
in his performance in competition with men and women with elegant mel@@ ons , he had his di@@ ap@@ hr@@ ag@@ m cap set in a che@@ e@@ ky angle and led the two years old to@@ ff@@ ee through the ring .
f@@ ent@@ on was nom@@ inated by the jury for his natural abilities in dealing with the pon@@ y , which is far above his age .
and to@@ ff@@ ee received best marks for his appearance and person@@ ality .
f@@ ent@@ on had to@@ ff@@ ee last march as a gift to his third birth@@ day and since then he has been working with the sh@@ et@@ land pon@@ y every day .
his mother , don@@ na , 30 , said : “ f@@ ent@@ on and to@@ ff@@ ee are a great deal of tension . ”
they had to take action against the entire particip@@ ant field and are equipped with gol@@ d@@ po@@ k@@ al and ro@@ set@@ te .
it was only the second time that he was compe@@ ting with to@@ ff@@ ee , and we were all delighted when he won .
completely str@@ ang@@ ers in the arena thought him to be so phenomen@@ al that they could be photograph@@ ed with him .
the small boy from the village of nan@@ ty@@ gl@@ o near e@@ bb@@ w val@@ e , south wal@@ es , follows in the foot@@ steps of his a@@ un@@ t shar@@ on ho@@ well , who has been riding horses for more than ten years .
ho@@ well ’ s story : “ the whole audience was like elec@@ tri@@ fied , and everyone fi@@ red it and cla@@ pped it . ”
he ran on sand the entire length of the arena and although he was so tiny , he has imag@@ in@@ ative work .
f@@ ent@@ on is cra@@ zy about animals – he lo@@ ves horses , trac@@ tors and farms and has two ch@@ ick@@ ens to which he is concerned .
as it is launched , it will not take long until it is on the &quot; horse of the year &quot; look – and i am sure that he will be able to do well .
a speaker of the annual horse show said : “ f@@ ent@@ on is only three , but he knows how to handle his pon@@ y . ”
together they are a great team .
the jury ra@@ ted f@@ ent@@ on and to@@ ff@@ ee for how well they be@@ aten and presented them in the demonstration ring .
they are looking for good cooperation between pon@@ y and leader – and there were f@@ ent@@ on and to@@ ff@@ ee the best in the ring .
i am sure that f@@ ent@@ on &apos;s sweet clothes have played their part in making the perfect occasion .
chinese newspaper calls for “ reform ”
a chinese newspaper that is on the front page asking for the release of a re@@ porter who was arrested for de@@ fam@@ ation .
the gu@@ ang@@ z@@ ho@@ u based new express had a strange feeling of public .
but chen later ad@@ mitted on television that he had accepted bri@@ bes to report a sub@@ state company .
now the new express will be subject to “ comprehensive rec@@ ti@@ fication , ” explained the regul@@ ator .
the rec@@ ti@@ fication order was carried out by the press and publications authority , radio , film and television in gu@@ ang@@ d@@ ong .
preliminary investigations showed that the new exchange rate , which is to be used for the y@@ ang@@ chen@@ g evening news group , was between september 2012 and august 2013 several in@@ accurate reports of the stock exchange nom@@ inated company zo@@ om@@ li@@ o@@ ed zo@@ om@@ li@@ kon .
“ the ed@@ it@@ orial management of the new express was dis@@ ordered , ” said the regul@@ ator in a statement .
she said that she decided to impose “ administrative pun@@ ishment for chen y@@ ong@@ z@@ ho@@ u and to give him his re@@ porter license . ”
in addition , “ the y@@ ang@@ chen@@ g evening news group was instruc@@ ted to provide a complete rec@@ ti@@ fication of the new express and recommended that the relevant persons responsible for the new express be identified and immediately appointed the new express management team .
chen had published several articles for the new express , in which he talked about alleg@@ ed financial ir@@ regul@@ arities with a manufacturer of construction machinery called zo@@ om@@ lion .
after he was arrested , the newspaper published two calls for his release on the front page and asked himself to be supported by his journ@@ alistic work .
but then chen appeared on state television and ad@@ mitted that he had published false reports on pay .
“ in this case , i have damaged zo@@ om@@ lion as well as the entire news industry and its ability to restore public confidence , ” he said to the state news agency .
i have done so primarily because i have to rely on money and gl@@ ory .
i have become aware that i have acted wr@@ ong@@ ly .
following chen ’ s apo@@ logy , the new express issued an apo@@ logy on the front page , expla@@ ining that it failed to address the reports correctly .
various well-known susp@@ ects have recently been on television saying that they are not .
experts say that conf@@ essions are still rout@@ ine forced .
the tunnel of dro@@ ck , with its own railway , which runs between the usa and mexico , has been discovered by the united states and mexico .
one of the most refined tun@@ nels for drug s@@ mu@@ gg@@ ling between the us and mexico , which is completely covered with lighting , v@@ enti@@ lation and electric railway operation , has now been discovered .
the us authorities described the 120 times 90 cen@@ time@@ ters tunnel as one of the most sophisticated pass@@ ages that they have ever found .
the tunnel which is in the zi@@ g@@ z@@ ag pattern over a length of just under six football fields links ware@@ houses near the ti@@ ju@@ ana , mexico , and san di@@ e@@ go , usa .
there are countless un@@ seen storage h@@ alls in the area , making it easier to find lor@@ ries carrying drugs .
the tunnel had been closed before drugs were trans@@ ported un@@ detec@@ ted in it , the authorities declared .
the discovery of the tunnel has seen eight and a half tonnes of mari@@ ju@@ ana and 14@@ 8 kg of co@@ ca@@ ine , so the records of the court have been established .
three men , who were working as drivers according to the authorities , were sent@@ enced to death for poss@@ essing and selling mari@@ ju@@ ana and co@@ ca@@ ine .
they are threatened with prison sent@@ ences in a sentence of ten years and li@@ fel@@ ong .
in no@@ gal@@ es , ari@@ z@@ ona , s@@ mu@@ gg@@ lers are rel@@ ying on an extensive underground network of dra@@ in@@ age channels .
the tunnel is the eigh@@ th large pass@@ age that has been discovered in san di@@ e@@ go since 2006 .
some of the largest tun@@ nels were built after the mari@@ ju@@ ana har@@ v@@ est in central mexico in october , which protected drug car@@ te@@ ls against the challenge of quickly trans@@ porting their product to the consumer .
in 2010 , authorities found a pass@@ age of just 6@@ 40 metres with rail@@ s , which was taken from a kitchen in a residential house in ti@@ ju@@ ana to two ware@@ houses in san di@@ e@@ go .
or@@ lan@@ do blo@@ om and mir@@ anda ker@@ r still love to be in love with the new or@@ lan@@ do family .
actors or@@ lan@@ do blo@@ om and model mir@@ anda ker@@ r want to go separate ways in the future .
in an interview , however , blo@@ om said that he and ker@@ r still love each other .
mir@@ anda ker@@ r and or@@ lan@@ do blo@@ om are parents of the two-@@ year-@@ old fl@@ y@@ n@@ n .
actors or@@ lan@@ do blo@@ om has committed to separation from his wife , top@@ model mir@@ anda ker@@ r , .
in an interview with us journ@@ alist k@@ ati@@ e cou@@ ric , who was on friday ( local time ) , the european union said that the european union is &quot; losing its life .
ker@@ r and he still loved , emphasi@@ zed the 3@@ 6-@@ year-@@ old .
&quot; we will support each other and love each other as parents of fl@@ y@@ n@@ n &quot; .

according to the le@@ x@@ ica , ve@@ gan@@ ism is sub@@ ordin@@ ated to vege@@ tari@@ an@@ ism , but it is very different from that .
for while vege@@ tari@@ ans are eating sa@@ h@@ ne@@ tt@@ or@@ te , ice or a strong ec@@ lec@@ tic , they are not at all bad .
milk , cheese , eg@@ g , besides the ren@@ un@@ ci@@ ation of meat and fish , the ve@@ gan is completely excluded from the consumption of animal products - hon@@ ey is also denied .
what remains may be asked , but when we look at it , ve@@ gan food is characterised by a considerable decline in income .
&quot; bread spre@@ ads are very popular &quot; , explains ute hen@@ kel@@ mann , the owner of the local reform house , who has a variety of special products for ve@@ gan .
re@@ u@@ ben proc@@ tor also visits the shop at the dom@@ gas@@ se .
for 13 years , the native new ze@@ al@@ and has lived ve@@ gan , in lam@@ per@@ the@@ im he finds ( almost ) everything he needs to live &quot; . in 1997 , i changed my di@@ et and became a vege@@ t@@ arian .
at the turn of the century , the next step was taken and i became ve@@ gan .
&quot; the convic@@ tion came not only because of the di@@ et , but because of the choice of sho@@ e &quot; , says proc@@ tor , who pre@@ fers artificial leather to normal leather .
he recognized that there were also problems in other everyday matters without animal products .
ve@@ gan is primarily an eth@@ ic .
&quot; i do not want animals to die for me , &quot; says proc@@ tor the ma@@ xi@@ m of ve@@ g@@ ans who focus on the whole consumption behavior .
instead of bur@@ gers , sti@@ r@@ rers or rubber bears , we have a lot of experience in the ve@@ g@@ ans , who are very enthusi@@ astic about the products .
&quot; it &apos;s a double bonus , &quot; proc@@ tor says today , &quot; in fact , ve@@ gan does not ren@@ oun@@ ce it , not as@@ c@@ ese , but it &apos;s an en@@ rich@@ ment &quot; .
and it was precisely these conditions that made it possible for some , even so well-@@ inten@@ tioned , to fail .
&quot; the ad@@ diction factor is a very important factor that allows many to quickly give up , similar to smoking , &quot; proc@@ tor makes a comparison .
and applies : &quot; certain tas@@ tes are not to be fixed to the animal &quot; .
often it is the sp@@ ices or the type of preparation that taste .
&quot; but you can also create the same effect in other ways , &quot; the ve@@ gan illustra@@ tes .
the hotel is located in the heart of the city , just a few steps from the beach and the beach .
it takes care of a balanced , varied di@@ et , in which it is also def@@ ec@@ tive to taste .
of course , you want to have something between the te@@ eth , that is legitimate .
&quot; it should taste , but this is not only for animal food to be reduced , &quot; says proc@@ tor .
health damage , food dis@@ orders , another widespread as@@ sumption , has not suffered .
for me , the change@@ over had a positive aspect .
i don &apos;t take a foreign cho@@ le@@ ster@@ ol and i have an increased proportion of vit@@ am@@ ins .
there are high-@@ performance sa@@ tel@@ li@@ tes that only feed ve@@ gan .
&quot; my blood values are excellent , i often check me &quot; , he reve@@ als .
especially in the absence of vit@@ am@@ in b@@ 12 , many ve@@ gan@@ si@@ sts war@@ n .
&quot; since animals are fed with feed instead of being fed on the pa@@ st@@ ure , it is doub@@ t@@ ful whether there is a risk of animal feed in the meat that is bought in the ch@@ ill ch@@ est .
ve@@ g@@ ans also have the option of using the co@@ en@@ zy@@ me in the form of tab@@ lets .
&quot; my b@@ 12 values are fine , &quot; he explains .
proc@@ tor must be able to go a long way to get food .
after all , basic foods are everywhere , and every super@@ market now has so@@ ya milk and other products .
all i need is to find on the spot .
only occa@@ sion@@ ally i buy something special .
&quot; many people over@@ look that only the finished products are expensive , but that is how it is with &quot; ordinary &quot; finished products , as we know .
the preparation of ve@@ gan dishes is already much cheaper and less time@@ -@@ consum@@ ing , as is commonly assumed .
&quot; in the kitchen there is much to discover , with a few small cr@@ ack@@ les you can enjoy good , if not partially better results , &quot; says proc@@ tor .
mar@@ gar@@ ine instead of but@@ ter , a little more ba@@ king pow@@ der and carbon ac@@ id instead of eg@@ g , with its ve@@ gan che@@ es@@ ec@@ a@@ ke , proc@@ tor could also ast@@ ound his paren@@ t@@ s-@@ in-@@ law .
the ve@@ gan festival is a new way of celebr@@ ating the family .
this is dynamic when you co@@ ok together , it has a new significance .
&quot; the situations that can arise are as different as the people themselves , &quot; says proc@@ tor .
of course , he has already been s@@ cep@@ tical .
do not taste my food any@@ more ?
&quot; should i feel bad now because i drink milk ? &quot; - for such a question , i have to ask ve@@ gan with fing@@ er@@ tip .
&quot; i do not dis@@ agree with people , i am part of this society , &quot; proc@@ tor does not want an enc@@ la@@ v@@ end@@ a@@ ism .
and , more precisely , the world of everyday life does not appear as out@@ sid@@ ers as it is thought - and ve@@ g@@ ans are not as restricted in everyday life as they usually assume .
fast food is also permitted .
pom@@ mes is everywhere !
&quot; many d@@ ö@@ ner shops offer fal@@ a@@ fe@@ l , or even a vege@@ t@@ arian yu@@ f@@ ka , &quot; says proc@@ tor .
in a piz@@ zer@@ ia , it is made up of pa@@ sta dishes , or it is possible to order a piz@@ za without cheese , all a matter of hab@@ it .
the restaurants are so slowly getting started .
&quot; when i started to ve@@ gan 13 years ago , i was still far more difficult to feed myself , &quot; the new ze@@ al@@ and can find a development : &quot; one must be familiar with the people , they must be al@@ ert . &quot;
&quot; if there are enough requests , you may be inc@@ lined to change the menu , &quot; hopes he .
ve@@ gan restaurants are developing , such as the man@@ n@@ heim com@@ bu@@ es@@ se or the café vo@@ gel@@ fre@@ i .
proc@@ tor wishes that other restaurants can also offer ve@@ gan food on the menu .
ve@@ gan dishes are basically there for everyone .
everyone can eat them , so they are exactly the opposite of exclusive .
&quot; meat dishes are exclusive , tru@@ th@@ fully in the sense of the word , because they exclu@@ de others , &quot; proc@@ tor notes .
&quot; if we want to avoid food scand@@ als , ve@@ gan@@ ism is a safe way to save the vast majority of the food scand@@ als from the outset , &quot; says proc@@ tor .
the purchase of ve@@ gan products , however , could be a little difficult at the beginning .
especially when you learn to understand that also in pe@@ an@@ u@@ ts animal addi@@ tives as color@@ ers can contain his , you seem to be satisfied with the adhe@@ rence to eth@@ ics at so many hur@@ d@@ les and quickly fall out of courage .
not only for this reason , re@@ u@@ ben proc@@ tor and lars th@@ om@@ sen wrote a book : &quot; ve@@ gan@@ is@@ sim@@ o - animal ingredients and their alternatives &quot; explains the many ingredients that make up food but also cleaning products .
&quot; one gradually develops a scan@@ ner look and knows which characters and lo@@ gos you have to pay attention to &quot; it is sometimes better to do small steps than to stay st@@ uck or st@@ um@@ ble &quot; , says proc@@ tor .
ve@@ gan@@ ism , it is an important moral poin@@ ter , which points to consci@@ ousness .
perhaps he is not quite able to leave his hab@@ its off , but at least he can te@@ ach consumers to cri@@ tically follow his hab@@ its .
nas@@ da@@ q om@@ x , the stock exchange operator , keeps its customers in bre@@ ath .
the nas@@ da@@ q options market trading was launched on friday afternoon of german time .
in a communication , the operator made technical problems responsible .
the other 11 us option markets , including two of nas@@ da@@ q om@@ x , continued their business un@@ h@@ inde@@ red .
the recent incident has put a whole series of small and larger g@@ aps on the stock market operator .
only on tuesday were the inde@@ xes of nas@@ da@@ q due to errors in data transport one hour did not have to be calculated .
in august of this year , there were two break@@ down@@ s in just one week .
first , the us investment bank gol@@ d@@ man s@@ ach@@ s had massive bu@@ y-@@ out orders to option markets due to technical problems .
as a result , stock market operators needed almost a whole day to place orders and to cancel them .
two days later , half of all us stock trading was due to a computer cr@@ ash at nas@@ da@@ q for several hours .
last year , the stock exchange of f@@ ak@@ e@@ book was also a great success .

british police is providing ass@@ ange with an ex@@ tradition notification .
the british police have today sent an ex@@ tradition letter to wi@@ kil@@ ea@@ ks founder ju@@ lian ass@@ ange , who was in the ecu@@ ador police force .
scotland yard declared that it was not allowed to join the 4@@ 0-@@ year-@@ old austr@@ ali@@ an to stand .
ass@@ ange threat@@ ens to ex@@ tradition to sweden because of the charge in a sexual off@@ ence after his possibilities to go to the uk law have been exhaus@@ ted , since the supreme court had lod@@ ged his opposition to ex@@ tradition in early december .
as he fears that stockholm will send it to the us , he had to leave the ec@@ um@@ en@@ ical assembly in brussels on 19 june .
scotland yard has “ been a 4@@ 0-@@ year-@@ old man to ask for a compromise that we have chosen at a time . ”
he continues to viol@@ ate the conditions of his release on ba@@ il .
the message did not comment on the delivery of the police call .
ass@@ ange fears that he will be sent from sweden to the united states and there will be a trial of the charges of es@@ pi@@ on@@ age after he has received more than 2@@ 50@@ ,000 diplomatic messages on the rev@@ el@@ ation website wi@@ kil@@ ea@@ ks .

tax on foreign property owners against london ’ s bu@@ b@@ ble
the treas@@ ury has provi@@ sion@@ ally en@@ forced the c@@ g@@ t measure , but is still waiting for the final decision of treas@@ ury chancell@@ or george os@@ borne , who will be the first to adopt a st@@ amp tax of eur 20 million in the 2012 budget .
already , income from st@@ amp taxes on housing in the districts of west min@@ ster and ken@@ sing@@ ton &amp; ch@@ el@@ sea is exce@@ eding the tax year 20@@ 12 / 13 for 7@@ 08 million p@@ ounds .
co@@ ok said , “ after the so@@ cks tax increases on high-@@ price housing and the introduction of the associated legislation against a circum@@ stance , it is hard to argue that high-quality properties are too low to be tax@@ ed , regardless of the impact .
“ but this move could be more re@@ stra@@ ined by foreign investors in buying property in london , or by preventing owners from selling , ” he added .
first class real estate – the top five to ten percent of the post-@@ price housing market – in the weal@@ thy london sou@@ th@@ west bel@@ t , which is located between ful@@ ham and w@@ im@@ ble@@ don , has been looking for re@@ de@@ mp@@ tion .

scientists have been able to sh@@ ed more light on the context in which the sw@@ ing of a dog with its mo@@ od is associated .
previous research had shown that happy dogs with the tail were more right we@@ del@@ te ( from the point of view of the dog ) while at ner@@ vous bre@@ eds there are the left side .
but now scientists say that other dogs do not per@@ cei@@ ve and react to these sub@@ tle differences .
professor geor@@ gio v@@ all@@ or@@ ti@@ gar@@ a , a neu@@ ros@@ ci@@ enti@@ st of the university of tren@@ to , said : “ people know well that the left and right half of the brain are re@@ acting differently to stimul@@ i that are positive or negative .
we have tried to do this with other species .
he also noted that dogs , like humans , have the right half of the brain for the left movement .
to learn more about how dogs are placed on the side of their species , please read the following pages .
they measured the heart rate of the four-@@ leg@@ ged and analy@@ zed the behavior .
we will probably soon understand why the tail is in one place , sometimes in the other direction .
professor v@@ all@@ or@@ ti@@ gar@@ a said , “ we have given the dogs movies with dogs – either a true version or a sil@@ hou@@ ette that can be di@@ str@@ acted by other aspects .
when the animals saw an otherwise un@@ expres@@ sive dog suc@@ king the tail to the right ( from the perspective of the we@@ aring dog ) , they were able to see the whole world relaxed .
but was the tend@@ ency mainly to the left ( again from the perspective of the dog , which we@@ del@@ t ) , so their heart rate rose and they saw un@@ cal@@ le@@ ly .
professor v@@ all@@ or@@ ti@@ gar@@ a believes that dogs do not communicate inten@@ tionally through these movements .
it is rather convinced that the dogs had learned from experience in which movements they were supposed to worry about and when not .
he said , ‘ if you want to have different encoun@@ ters with other dogs and to have a we@@ aring of the tail in one direction is more connected with friendly behaviour and the right side produces a less friendly behaviour , then you react to the basis .
researchers say that the findings of dog owners , animal doctors , and tra@@ in@@ ers have resulted in a better understanding of the emo@@ tions of their animal .
john br@@ ad@@ sha@@ w , expert in dog behaviour and guest schol@@ ar@@ ship at the fac@@ ul@@ ty of animal medicine of the university of bri@@ st@@ ol explained that this was not the first study to study .
last year , a team of the university of l@@ inc@@ ol@@ n found out that dogs turn their head to the left when they hit an aggres@@ sive dog , and right when they are a ran@@ dom dog .
in another research work at victori@@ a university in canada , the following was stated : “ dogs are more likely to go to a robo@@ t dog if his tail is left we@@ del@@ t and not right , rather than re@@ st@@ less .
according to him , the differences could result in the fact that the dogs in the various studies have been able to see the animals in the films or the robo@@ t dogs as dogs .
a study of how dogs react to real dogs could help , he explained .
“ although there is considerable evidence for many different m@@ am@@ m@@ als that the two brain hal@@ ves are used for different purposes , many of the details still need to be determined – and dogs are no exception , ” says bra@@ d ha@@ y .
but as their behavior can be recorded simply , it will probably not take long until we understand why the tail is sometimes in one , sometimes in the other direction .

po@@ pe franc@@ is ap@@ points his first car@@ din@@ al in february .
po@@ pe franc@@ is will be presenting new car@@ din@@ als of the catho@@ lic church for the first time on february 22 , as the v@@ ati@@ can announced on thursday .
car@@ din@@ als are the highest cl@@ er@@ ics in the catho@@ lic church after the po@@ pe and they are also the ones who have a po@@ pe who choose a po@@ pe so that franc@@ is can become the first group of men .
there are currently 20@@ 1 car@@ din@@ als .
however , a car@@ din@@ al who has reached an age of 80 can no longer participate in po@@ pe elections – that is to say , a group of 120 “ eligible car@@ din@@ als . ”
in a statement in which the news was announced , father feder@@ ico l@@ om@@ bar@@ di , a spo@@ kes@@ man of the v@@ ati@@ can , said that there would be a meeting of all car@@ din@@ als before the cere@@ mony was held .
&quot; po@@ pe franc@@ is decided to withdraw his decision to conven@@ e the consistency story in february in advance .
j@@ ack val@@ ero by catho@@ lic vo@@ ices said that the number of eligible po@@ ll@@ ing clubs has ris@@ en by february .
he said that a po@@ pe usually ap@@ point as many car@@ din@@ als as necessary to keep the number of eligible car@@ din@@ als af@@ lo@@ at to 120 , and so many car@@ din@@ als above 80 , as he would like .
the consistency of next year is therefore important because it is the first since the election of franc@@ is in march of this year , so val@@ er@@ o says .
there is currently a certain over@@ han@@ g on the part of europe , and particularly italy .
“ it will be interesting to see if the new po@@ pe car@@ din@@ al from the rest of the world will ap@@ point to restore balance , ” he said .
for@@ ty per cent of ca@@ th@@ ol@@ ics live in south america , but they have only a tiny number of car@@ din@@ als .
the car@@ din@@ als will also be the first to have been created since the formation of the council of the car@@ din@@ als established by fran@@ z@@ is@@ c@@ us , a group of eight car@@ din@@ als from all over the world , who have the task .
in the past , the po@@ pe decided everything on its own .
“ now franc@@ is has left these eight car@@ din@@ als to help him , ” said val@@ ero .
he said that it was “ possible ” that franc@@ is would have left the car@@ din@@ als for advice .
but we have not been in this position so far – all new .
val@@ ero said that typically the bis@@ ho@@ ps from large places to car@@ din@@ als would be called , but ste@@ c@@ ke franc@@ is “ full of surpris@@ es – so we do not know who he will ap@@ point . ”
g@@ m calls new pic@@ k@@ up tr@@ uc@@ ks in the us to repair the seat back@@ rest .

some cars may have a def@@ ect in the mechanism for res@@ et the front seat back@@ rest .
for this reason , they do not comply with the federal guidelines for vehicle safety on head re@@ stra@@ ints .
“ when the vehicle is driven from behind , it is possible that the head re@@ stra@@ int can not properly protect the occup@@ ants , so that an increased risk of in@@ jury exists , ” said the news on the national high@@ ways website .
the returned models were tested between 1 august and 10 september .
the delivery of the g@@ m tr@@ uc@@ ks began in june and represents the most important model launch of the leading american car manufacturer since the in@@ solv@@ ency restructuring in 2009 .
g@@ m informed vehicle owners in the first half of october about the def@@ ect .
the n@@ h@@ t@@ sa was unable to reach a decision because of the 16@@ -@@ day government shut@@ down , which had a negative impact on car sales in october .

an obama elec@@ tor@@ ate ’ s desper@@ ate cr@@ y
i have elected president obama twice in the hope that change is possible .
he says that obama has made lau@@ dable efforts to re@@ me@@ dy the dead@@ lock in republic@@ ans .
the policy of bloc@@ k@@ ade does not exc@@ use the site problems of ob@@ am@@ ac@@ are , the dr@@ one attacks on the web site , the dr@@ one attacks on the internet , the dr@@ one attacks on the internet .
obama ’ s mem@@ o@@ irs about the 2008 campaign were a sad remin@@ der of what could have been done .
na@@ than@@ i@@ el p. mor@@ r@@ is is a student in the second year at har@@ v@@ ard medical school .
i am currently reading a terri@@ bly sad book .
it is a book of which i believed it would make me feel at home during the tw@@ ili@@ ght second year of my medical studies and tell me again that i am hope@@ ful .
the aud@@ acity to win ( courage to win ) and signs the story of the mem@@ o@@ irs bar@@ ack ob@@ am@@ as for the presidential election of 2008 .
when i go to the hospital in the evening and go to bed , i am taken back to a time when the politics of life inspired millions and gave the a@@ post@@ le a bre@@ ath of fresh air .
the election was a lands@@ li@@ de victory and news spo@@ kes@@ men held in order to demonstrate the historic importance of this hour .
my class@@ mates we@@ pt before joy , and my parents collected all the newspapers they could find .
a young team of vi@@ sion@@ aries was on the way to the white house and the nation was ready for change .
when obama came into office in 2008 , he had agreed to 82 % .
and then i close the book .
re@@ swit@@ ching to the present is a bad awa@@ k@@ ening , as if you were tor@@ n out of a dream .
it is difficult to remember these optim@@ istic times – they seem to be a v@@ ague memory , a sad remin@@ der of missed people ’ s opportunities .
in the years since i first voted , the situation has indeed changed .
but it is simply not something i could have imag@@ ined .
i recognise the great and varied things that obama has achieved , from adopting a treaty of aff@@ or@@ able c@@ are ac@@ t. the eu is a member of the european parliament .
i agree that the party political bloc@@ k@@ ade is too much of a desire to go to the wrong track .
but , having repeatedly critic@@ ised the obama administration for colleagues and acqu@@ a@@ int@@ ances , i am not at all satisfied with my attempts to explain .
i have reached a point of political des@@ pair .
republic@@ an bloc@@ k@@ ade policy cannot explain why it is not possible to inter@@ cep@@ t the inter@@ cep@@ tion of foreign leaders or to prevent the killing of inno@@ cent children by dr@@ ones over@@ seas .
it cannot explain why the national security agency has obtained data on the private lives of americans and why wh@@ ist@@ le@@ b@@ lower is being pun@@ ished , which is a dis@@ closure of mis@@ conduct by the state .
it cannot explain why an@@ war al-@@ aw@@ la@@ ki , an american citizen , was not mur@@ dered without trial , nor why public funding and public spending were restricted during the presidential election .
it does not justify the results of a report which states that the efforts of the white house to calm the media are the “ most aggres@@ sive ... since the ni@@ x@@ on government . ”
and , most recently , it cannot exc@@ use the in@@ ability to make progress in the more than three years since the adoption of the affordable care act .
i do not know whether this is what i should have expected .
whether i should have understood by 18 that the government work was in@@ consistent with the previous political campaigns .
obviously , the office of depu@@ ties is not a predic@@ table course , as an opposition party and ran@@ dom events like the new@@ town mass@@ ac@@ re pre@@ determine public debate .
but if i look at the examples mentioned above , they seem largely to be elected by the government itself .
and that is what is most distur@@ bing to me .
i re-@@ elected obama in 2012 , not because i was enthusi@@ astic about his candi@@ d@@ acy .
mit@@ t ro@@ m@@ ney was a conf@@ using and un@@ sophisticated alternative , seem@@ ing to be his direction and position .
i had the impression that a second term for obama , free of the pressure of future elections , would fulfil the hope that we had heard about for so long .
but , with the fall in the approval values for obama to below 45 % this week , the return to 2008 through this book has become all the har@@ der .
it ar@@ ous@@ es in me a long@@ ing for the many promises that have dis@@ appeared .
this week i read a section in the book descri@@ bing how obama could make a severe loss against clin@@ ton in the pre-@@ election campaign in pen@@ n@@ sy@@ l@@ v@@ ania .
in a meeting with the election workers after the decision , he told his staff that they had to get back on track and follow the purpose of their cause .
“ i want us to find our magic , ” he said .
we must remember who we are .
five years later , mr. president , and i could not tell you more .
the comments expressed in this comment are exclusively those of na@@ than@@ i@@ el mor@@ r@@ is .
cli@@ ve pal@@ mer claims that prime minister ton@@ y ab@@ bot@@ t has been a source of conflict of interest in paren@@ tal leave and that he has been a source of conflict of interest in paren@@ tal leave .
the bil@@ li@@ on@@ air@@ e and mr pal@@ mer are saying that prime minister ton@@ y ab@@ bot@@ t is in a conflict of interests in his paren@@ tal leave plans because his dau@@ gh@@ ters are getting pregn@@ ant and could therefore benefit from it .
the mining mag@@ n@@ at , who was in a judicial dispute over the payment of $ 6 million in co2 tax , claimed that the eu was not going to resolve issues that were not in the right direction .
the pal@@ mer united party could win up to four votes in the sen@@ ate , which is important for deci@@ ding whether the co2 and mining taxes should be removed or reduced .
but pal@@ mer claimed that only ministers could have conflicts of interest and the dau@@ gh@@ ters of ab@@ bot@@ t would benefit personally from the laws .
&quot; it is in a major conflict of interests when it comes to paid paren@@ tal leave , because if one of his dau@@ gh@@ ters becomes pregn@@ ant , he has a direct interest in whether or not to receive a holiday , &quot; said pal@@ mer .
two months after the election , the pal@@ mer electoral commission , with 53 votes , declared a lea@@ p forward officially following the re@@ count as the winner of the sun@@ shine coast seat of fair@@ fax .
pal@@ mer called for a revision of the vote coun@@ ting process so that it could go faster .
ton@@ y ab@@ bot@@ t ’ s dau@@ gh@@ ters fran@@ ces and brid@@ get .
if these elections were held two months after the end of the vote ?
“ we need a better system , ” he said .
why should we not have a system where we are mar@@ ching in , trans@@ ferring data to a computer , immediately choosing and then at 6 : 30 in the evening having the result ?
pal@@ mer also cri@@ tici@@ zed the use of p@@ enc@@ ils when marking bal@@ lot papers .
if you use them because you can then er@@ ase the results if you do not like them ?
to be able to vote with pen@@ cil nowadays is incredible .
the electoral commission has examined the options for an electronic election and has recently presented a joint legislative proposal with new ze@@ al@@ and .
pal@@ mer , 59 , declared that his policy was to establish an international airport for the sun@@ shine coast and that he would re@@ sume his new office “ very seriously . ”
public office is about service to the public .
“ we are not seeking any re@@ ward except for that of history , namely that we can serve at a critical time of this community , ” he said .
r@@ bs sus@@ pen@@ ds two fore@@ x trad@@ ers
the royal bank of scotland has two trad@@ ers from its foreign exchange department , two people who have been involved in the situation , and this is another indication of how much the world government has been able to make of the alleg@@ ed man@@ ip@@ ulation .
some of the world ’ s largest banks , including u@@ bs , bar@@ cla@@ ys , deutsche bank , and r@@ bs , confirmed that they had been in contact with the authorities in the investigations in the world ’ s largest financial market , where us $ 5.@@ 3 tr@@ il@@ lion is held every day .
the two trad@@ ers would be the first r@@ bs employees to be suspended in the expanding investigation that the scand@@ al surrounding the li@@ b@@ or inter@@ bank business brought about .
the bank , which has not comm@@ ented on the suspension , confirmed this month that the bank will not accept requests for information from authorities .
“ our investigation into this subject goes on and we are co@@ operating fully with the f@@ ca and other regulatory agencies , ” said the bank two weeks ago .
last month , people close to the situation said that the r@@ bs had to keep the records of e-@@ ma@@ ils and inst@@ ant messages sent by and to an earlier deal@@ er to the british regulatory authority , which is the financial consult .
this mer@@ ch@@ ant , richard us@@ her , had left r@@ bs 2010 and is now to be replaced by his current position as european head of the fore@@ x spot trade at j@@ p@@ mor@@ gan .
ro@@ h@@ an ram@@ ch@@ and@@ ani , head of the european spot trading company cit@@ i , was left on holiday this week and mat@@ t gar@@ din@@ er , form@@ erly the leading currency trad@@ er in bar@@ cla@@ ys and u@@ bs , was arrested this week .
none of these trad@@ ers has been accused of any mis@@ conduct .
the inst@@ ant message group of us@@ her included ban@@ kers at bar@@ cla@@ ys and the ci@@ ti@@ group , said that close to the situation people .
u@@ bs announced this week that they are taking steps against some of their employees after the swiss regulatory authority declared fin@@ ma that they had a susp@@ ected man@@ ip@@ ulation of the fore@@ x market in a number of swiss banks .
at least six authorities worldwide – the european commission , fin@@ ma , the swiss competition authority we@@ ko , the f@@ ca , the us department of justice and the hong kong monetary authority – are currently engaged in acc@@ us@@ ations of ban@@ gl@@ ad@@ es@@ h .
h@@ s@@ bc , ci@@ ti@@ group , j@@ p@@ mor@@ gan and credit su@@ is@@ se have also launched internal investigations or received requests for information from authorities , said people familiar with the situation .
banks are tr@@ app@@ ing inst@@ ant messages and e-@@ ma@@ ils from several years in search of mis@@ conduct .
the news of these investigations has brought trad@@ ers into tur@@ mo@@ il in an area that has led to one of the most prof@@ itable trading companies in the world in recent years .
some ban@@ kers have tried to play down the aff@@ air and said that it is almost impossible to cur@@ b the vast and highly liquid market of foreign exchange .
a leading trad@@ er noted that , despite the huge daily volume of foreign exchange trading , the frag@@ ment@@ ation of liqui@@ dity between the various trading platforms and the growing demand for own investments has not been fully addressed by banks .
the news came out the same day , when credit su@@ is@@ se announced that she had been giving a trad@@ er of her london exchange tr@@ aded funds office this week after he had been in a loss of just under six million dollars at the end of last year .
the bank promp@@ tly informed the competent authorities and co@@ operates with them .
“ we are sure that the trad@@ er has acted alone and that the matter is contained , ” credit su@@ is@@ se said .
the f@@ ence of the building on the bec@@ h@@ tel@@ le site is pain@@ ted in a wooden frame .
a group of citizens &apos; initiative &quot; sch@@ we@@ iz@@ er wi@@ ese &quot; has opened the f@@ ence on the bec@@ h@@ l@@ le land on the kur@@ promen@@ ade in bad her@@ ren@@ al@@ b .
moreover , it clean@@ ed and wi@@ den@@ ed the foot@@ path , it says in a press release .
the planned covering of the dec@@ lining house in the re@@ ar part of the property was not allowed for security reasons , because the site is in danger of sli@@ pping .
al@@ f@@ red ab@@ el , who currently man@@ ages the property , had announced the beauti@@ fication action with his colleague rein@@ hard dom@@ ke of the bi .
before the bi ’ s action , a transparent one was called for with the message , &apos; we are in favour &apos; .
this distur@@ bed the 20 or so members of the citizens &apos; initiative , however , little in their action .
your mo@@ tto on the big pos@@ ter was &quot; we are against ru@@ ins of buildings &quot; .
in doing so , she wanted to point out the danger of even larger ru@@ ins on the swiss me@@ ado@@ w - if the giant project one day fails .
in con@@ vers@@ ation with many pas@@ ser@@ s-@@ by before the &quot; construction site &quot; it became clear that some citizens believe that the re@@ alization of the project of the city will be better for many , although not many have the same questions about the dimension of the project presented .
but they are beginning to re@@ sign because the city is still drag@@ ging its feet on these responses , it is said by the bi .
as has been said , public statements by the may@@ or are also acting .
in may , the local council said that it would abol@@ ish the thermal bath .
some seem to be fri@@ ghten@@ ed by this , while others see it as &apos; cru@@ de black@@ mail &apos; at the population , as they say in the press release of the bi .
the bi than@@ ked the don@@ ors for the color and all the help@@ ers .
ran@@ king ro@@ ds for sch@@ ir@@ is : man@@ e no s@@ wal@@ low king , no s@@ wal@@ low king , no man of s@@ wal@@ lows .
so satisfied r@@ al@@ f ran@@ gn@@ ick with the current high shape of bun@@ des@@ lig@@ a table leader red bu@@ ll salzburg is , however disappointed the team was not able to find the sports director of the &quot; bu@@ lls &quot; .
&quot; there is a dangerous tend@@ ency at the moment that man@@ e and al@@ an are being placed in the category of s@@ wal@@ low k@@ ings , &quot; he took the two off@@ ensive wh@@ ir@@ l@@ ers at a press conference in salzburg on thursday .
the most recent reason for ran@@ king nic@@ ks was yellow for man@@ e at the 3 : 0 against gr@@ ö@@ di@@ g last sunday , where the sen@@ eg@@ al@@ ese were given a supposed acting act - the free .
&quot; a bl@@ at@@ ant mis@@ decision , &quot; ran@@ gn@@ ick said , re@@ fe@@ ree har@@ k@@ am was &quot; over@@ bur@@ den@@ ed &quot; .
har@@ k@@ am would also have contributed &quot; his part &quot; to the es@@ cal@@ ation between salz@@ bur@@ g-@@ co@@ ach ro@@ ger sch@@ mid@@ t and gr@@ ö@@ di@@ g tra@@ iner ad@@ i h@@ ü@@ t@@ ter after the match .
he def@@ ended his fellow german citizen deci@@ de@@ dly : &quot; i would have beha@@ ved like ro@@ ger sch@@ mid@@ t in every situation . &quot;
sch@@ mid@@ t himself wants to look for the sch@@ ar@@ m@@ ü@@ tz@@ el with h@@ ü@@ t@@ ter without having had contact with his colleague .
i do not know why .
&quot; for i am the one who was insul@@ ted , &quot; the 4@@ 6-@@ year-@@ old stressed .
in view of the success of the event , ran@@ king was a tribute to the city .
&quot; there are only two words for this : right good , &quot; he noted .
there is not much to be said about .
in particular , the way the team plays is impressive .
let us continue with this .
changes in the sk@@ ill during the winter transfer period will hardly be there .
there are no great reasons for changing anything .
&quot; except for one player , he wants to leave the club , &quot; ran@@ ked the first player .
supreme court confir@@ ms obama ’ s health act
it is a great victory for the obama administration : the us supreme court decided today that the narrow relationship with bar@@ ack obama was a major victory .
by five to four votes , jud@@ ges jud@@ ged that the patient protection and aff@@ ore@@ station mandate was not sufficient .
chief judge john ro@@ ber@@ ts suggested that he should be on the side of the four more liberal members of the chamber , while jud@@ ges sc@@ alia , thomas , ali@@ to , and ken@@ ne@@ dy chose against .
the court also confirmed the remaining sections of the 27@@ 00 pages of law and also held the view that the provision of the health act , according to which states may either meet the conditions for access to medic@@ aid or otherwise termin@@ ate all state institutions .
the legal action was initiated by 26 states and the national federation of independent states .
the law was signed by all the leading republic@@ an presidential candidates , including the event@@ ual challeng@@ er mit@@ t ro@@ m@@ ney , in the run@@ -up to 2012 .
norway : norway &apos;s place is filled with huge mir@@ r@@ ors of light .
with huge mir@@ r@@ ors , the inhabitants of a nor@@ we@@ gian village have sh@@ ed light on their d@@ ust valley .
due to the low solar ra@@ inf@@ all , the water in the ve@@ st@@ f@@ jor@@ d valley is falling from autumn to spring , usually in the shadow of the surrounding mountains .
with three gi@@ gan@@ tic refl@@ ec@@ tors at 45 meters height , a centur@@ y-@@ long space was realized on wednesday .
&quot; finally ! &quot; , may@@ or ste@@ in@@ ar ber@@ g@@ land s@@ war@@ med up at the start cere@@ mony at t@@ v@@ 2 .
some of the valley inhabitants were right to use sun@@ chairs , others used sun@@ gl@@ asses for safety purposes .
so far , sun@@ -@@ hun@@ gr@@ y people have had to go to a nearby summit by cable car in winter .
ten years ago , local artist martin an@@ der@@ sen presented the proposal to transfer the ra@@ ys with mir@@ r@@ ors to the valley .
this idea has been in place since 19@@ 13 .
after several years of debate , the city council finally had the 5 million cro@@ wn@@ s ( about 6@@ 15 000 euros ) expensive project adopted .
a similar construction has given the italian alpine village vi@@ gan@@ ella a win@@ try sun@@ shine for some years .
post is empty hardly on sun@@ days
&quot; many citizens will not have noticed the red do@@ ts for sunday even@@ ings .
i have confirmed this in a request from the f@@ dp .
on sun@@ days and holidays , only before the post office building in the ern@@ st-@@ lu@@ d@@ wi@@ g-@@ stra@@ ß@@ e 36 and in the j@@ ak@@ o@@ b m@@ ü@@ ll@@ er-@@ stra@@ ß@@ e 1 in h@@ ü@@ t@@ ten@@ fel@@ d will be empty .
whether in ho@@ f@@ heim and ros@@ eng@@ ar@@ ten , even on sunday , the answer to the f@@ d@@ p ’ s question will not answer .
the social and youth policy spo@@ kes@@ man of the f@@ dp , fr@@ it@@ z ro@@ e@@ h@@ ren@@ bec@@ k , wants to make up for this .
sunday emp@@ t@@ ying is an important postal service , especially at termin@@ post .
&quot; this enterprise s@@ me@@ ars down despite the price increase for letters on january 2013 rad@@ ically and un@@ reason@@ ably &quot; .
thomas bit@@ t@@ ner , the association chairman of the liberal groups and the city counc@@ ill@@ ors , supports his group colleague : &apos; what an@@ no@@ ys me is the fact that this is a cl@@ am@@ our to change or also to delete the rest &apos; .
the post office is a m@@ ile away from the city .
&quot; at least the post boxes in the districts of neu@@ ch@@ â@@ tel and ros@@ eng@@ ar@@ ten must be emp@@ ti@@ ed again on sun@@ days &quot; , says bit@@ t@@ ner and ro@@ h@@ ren@@ bec@@ k un@@ is@@ on@@ o .
the city is also known for its poor population , especially for non-@@ mobile citizens , and it is also necessary to be able to reach a post box with sunday emp@@ t@@ ying .
ro@@ e@@ h@@ ren@@ bec@@ k asked in the municip@@ al parliament whether the city administration planned to hold discussions with the post about this matter .
may@@ or er@@ ich ma@@ i@@ er rep@@ lied that the post did not communicate with lam@@ per@@ the@@ im .
he knows , however , that there is also a sunday empty in ho@@ f@@ heim .
your party has , of course , declared itself in favour of priva@@ tisation .
&quot; then decisions are taken elsewhere , &quot; ma@@ i@@ er said .
frankfurt parking charges are to rise shar@@ p@@ ly .
parking in frankfurt could soon become more expensive .
the mag@@ i@@ str@@ ate of the city this morning discus@@ ses a sub@@ mission of traffic de@@ vo@@ tees ste@@ fan maj@@ er ( green ) .
the parking charges are therefore to be increased by 50 percent .
but the price should not be raised , but the time inter@@ val of parking and parking tickets should be increased from 30 minutes to 20 minutes .
in december , the assembly of the city council must decide .
the retail committee of the i@@ h@@ k frankfurt considers that &apos; a bad idea &apos; .
the hotel is very clean and the staff is very helpful .
germany , with its transport club , believes that an increase after two decades &apos; is &apos; perfectly reasonable and actually long over@@ due &apos; .
public transport will also be more expensive .
fre@@ u@@ den@@ stadt : fast actions over@@ run hosts
with a narrow cad@@ re , the t@@ sv fre@@ u@@ den@@ stadt lor@@ ds had to be moved to re@@ ut@@ ling@@ en against the t@@ g g@@ ö@@ n@@ n@@ ingen t@@ g from the sch@@ w@@ ä@@ bis@@ chen al@@ b .
the el@@ ders were confron@@ ted with an experienced team on the other side of the net .
soon , however , it became apparent that , even in the age of the year , they could not quite keep up with the rapid actions of the fre@@ u@@ den@@ st@@ ä@@ d@@ ter .
with the hard and placed sur@@ charges , the pat@@ ron sa@@ m g@@ ö@@ n@@ n@@ ingen did extremely hard .
they repeatedly missed the opportunity offered by sim@@ on sch@@ en@@ k and e@@ du@@ ard schul@@ z to clean the network center and attack and were at the bloc@@ k@@ defence stage .
two high first pri@@ zes were clearly expressed by the superi@@ ority of the fre@@ u@@ den@@ stadt in all matters .
in the face of this crus@@ hing and gam@@ bling performance , the third sentence was then somewhat la@@ x and l@@ oud at the 3 : 0 end ( 25 : 13 , 25 : 14 , 25 : 22 ) .
this will be on november 2 with the tv ba@@ i@@ er@@ s@@ br@@ on@@ n , which was able to clearly asser@@ t itself in n@@ ag@@ old , a much more powerful oppon@@ ent in the field .
ts@@ v fre@@ u@@ den@@ stadt i : dom@@ ini@@ k b@@ ä@@ u@@ er@@ le , y@@ an@@ nik b@@ ü@@ ch@@ le , se@@ bas@@ tian d@@ ö@@ l@@ ker , fe@@ li@@ x p@@ ä@@ l@@ chen , ste@@ fan r@@ ä@@ ller , sim@@ on sch@@ en@@ k and e@@ du@@ ard schul@@ ard schul@@ z .
the b-@@ class was the seat of the mur@@ g@@ tal@@ hal@@ le in ba@@ i@@ er@@ s@@ br@@ on@@ n , where the second teams from ba@@ i@@ er@@ s@@ br@@ on@@ n and fre@@ u@@ den@@ stadt stood opposite .
they delivered a highly con@@ tested two-@@ hour match .
ner@@ v@@ ousness on both sides caused a sti@@ r , especially during the ball acceptance , and sco@@ res , and there was also a lack of precision in pass@@ ports and in some critical game scenes .
in this highly balanced meeting , the t@@ v-@@ team of mar@@ c@@ us bla@@ z@@ u@@ tto agreed , however , that the great physical effort and a pleas@@ ing commitment of both teams were all in place .
a day of care for the little english cot@@ tage
the fifth nur@@ sing day in the after@@ mat@@ h of the natur@@ a 2000 project of ob@@ ere ho@@ tz@@ en@@ wal@@ d was attended by a group of committed participants at the small english hu@@ t in ib@@ ach .
based on popular suggestions , the day should be a day in the area of the hu@@ t to view the valley , may@@ or hel@@ mu@@ t ka@@ is@@ er said .
many hi@@ kers called , according to ka@@ is@@ er , this area as the g@@ los@@ sy piece of the gor@@ ge on which the landscape is the ideal setting for wonderful views .
he than@@ ked the people present for their willingness to cooperate and stressed that the day of care was an appropriate instrument for establishing the link between man and nature .
it offers every citizen the opportunity to be able to set their own priorities in nature .
at the same time , the tourism aspect could also be taken into account in the environmental field .
fried@@ rich sch@@ re@@ i@@ ke , who was the head of the department of nature conservation , explained this ecological aspect following the welcome initiative of the land@@ r@@ at ti@@ l@@ man bol@@ l@@ ach@@ er , who was the pat@@ ron .
the tourist destination of the vi@@ st@@ view is according to tri@@ bu@@ ka@@ it with the aim of preser@@ ving the already heavily grown old all@@ m@@ end@@ we@@ id@@ fel@@ d with its specific protected habit@@ at types by opening and connecting to the still existing ones .
certain species , such as rare but@@ ter@@ f@@ lies and gr@@ ass but@@ ter@@ f@@ lies , may not overcome barriers in the form of forest areas .
you need these free connections to keep your species .
tri@@ bu@@ ka@@ it said she wanted to keep it at this point , a l@@ ance to break for the planned bio@@ sphere reserve .
the current measure does not only se@@ am@@ lessly fit into this planning .
a bio@@ sphere area also offers the opportunity to achieve sustainable economic and environmental development on the basis of the internationally recognised unesco world heritage status and thus a continuous addition to the world heritage list associated with the life project and the previous fo@@ ster days .
after these different versions , the tour guide chri@@ stop@@ h we@@ h@@ le and life project manager cor@@ ne@@ lia bis@@ ch@@ off shared the help@@ ers in groups .
the larger trees were be@@ aten in advance , the forest trac@@ tor may be available for re@@ tri@@ eval .
a group of help@@ ers should try to exemp@@ t juni@@ per bus@@ hes and care for a dry stone bar .
the aim was to open the view at the view@@ point .

google , sam@@ sung , hu@@ a@@ we@@ i because of nor@@ tel patents are su@@ ed by nor@@ tel patents .
the group , which has thousands of previous nor@@ tel patents , imposed a la@@ v@@ ish of complaints on thursday about patent infringement against mobile phone manufacturers , including google , which is the company that was involved in in@@ solv@@ ency .
ro@@ ck@@ star , the con@@ sor@@ ti@@ um that holds the nor@@ tel patents for $ 4.@@ 5 billion , is compla@@ ining about the lack of a sam@@ sung electronics co ltd , ht@@ c cor@@ p , hu@@ a@@ we@@ i and four other companies .
ro@@ ck@@ star is a joint ownership of apple , microsoft , black@@ ber@@ ry , er@@ ic@@ s@@ son and sony .
google will be accused of patent infringement in seven cases .
patents cover technology , the search terms on the internet with relevant advertising , and the results are published by the court of justice .
sam@@ sung ’ s representatives , hu@@ a@@ we@@ i , ht@@ c , and ro@@ ck@@ star were not directly accessible .
sam@@ sung , hu@@ a@@ we@@ i and ht@@ c make mobile phones that are compatible with google ’ s and@@ ro@@ id operating system , which is in sharp competition with mobile products from apple and microsoft .
in 2011 , google gave an initial bid of $ 9@@ 00 million to the nor@@ tel patents .
google increased its offer several times and offered a last 4.@@ 4 billion dollars .
after the nor@@ tel patents of ro@@ ck@@ star over@@ bo@@ wed , the google engine acquired mobility , which was sold to the u.s. for $ 12.@@ 5 billion , a business that was also partly funded by motor@@ ola ’ s library .
“ although google has failed in its attempt to ban the patent for action at the au@@ ction , google has not infring@@ ed the patents and continues to do so , ” says the compla@@ int .
ro@@ ck@@ star claims a high amount of google damages because it claims google &apos;s patent infringement is deliber@@ ate , so the acc@@ us@@ ation .
egypt s@@ wor@@ n in first fre@@ el@@ y-@@ elected president
mo@@ ham@@ med mor@@ si dis@@ lo@@ ses the o@@ ath of office , but his day of tri@@ um@@ ph should not be the end of political disputes in egypt .
islam@@ ist mo@@ ham@@ med mor@@ si promised a “ new egypt ” when he was the first freely elected president of the country to be s@@ wor@@ n in , and thus the success@@ or of hus@@ ni mu@@ bar@@ ak , who had been 16 months away .
with his in@@ aug@@ ur@@ ation to the supreme constitutional court , mor@@ si was also the first freely elected islam@@ ist president of the arab world and egypt ’ s fifth leader since the fall of the mon@@ arch@@ y some 60 years ago .
he put the o@@ ath before the 18 dres@@ sed in black ro@@ bes jud@@ ges of the court , which is located at the n@@ ile and is an ancient egyp@@ tian temple .
“ we are stri@@ ving for a better future , a new egypt and a second republic , ” said mor@@ si at the sole@@ m@@ n cere@@ mony broad@@ cast live on state television .
“ today , the egyp@@ tian people have laid the foundations for a new life – absolute freedom , true democracy and stability , ” said mor@@ si , a 6@@ 0-@@ year-@@ old american educ@@ ated engine@@ er and member of the muslim bro@@ ther@@ hood .
hundreds of soldiers and police guar@@ ded the building when mor@@ si was briefly att@@ acked by the police shortly after 11 o &apos;@@ clock local time .
only a few hundred sup@@ porters had gathered in the court to meet the new president , and , unlike the presidential pr@@ us@@ sian f@@ eu@@ d , the mu@@ bar@@ ak war has only been allowed to stop the traffic for a short time , so that the car can be stopped .
as a non-@@ char@@ is@@ matic “ replacement wheel ” of the bro@@ ther@@ hood , his personal presti@@ ge has been mo@@ c@@ ked since his victory and a friday speech , in which he was not only a candidate for the islam@@ ists , but all .
“ egypt is now a civil , national , constitutional , and modern state , ” he declared in a blue suit with red kra@@ ft .
later mor@@ si went to the university of ca@@ iro , where he was supposed to deliver his in@@ aug@@ ural speech .
he was officially welcomed by an army band that had founded the national an@@ them , who he had been listening to .

rap@@ es in south africa : two times a life@@ time of life
nine months after the brut@@ al ra@@ pe and mu@@ ti@@ lation of a 17@@ -@@ year-@@ old girl in south africa , the perpe@@ tr@@ ator was sent@@ enced to two li@@ fel@@ ong sent@@ ences on friday .
this was reported by the station sab@@ c .
the victim was later struck by the consequences of serious in@@ jur@@ ies .
joh@@ ann@@ es k@@ ana was already in the early days of the crime .
the de@@ eds had caused hor@@ ror nation@@ wide .
the then 21 year old had an@@ ene boo@@ y@@ sen in february in an industrial area in bre@@ d@@ as@@ dor@@ p near cape town .
14 hours the doctors fought for the survival of the victim , but in v@@ ain .
the sight of the young people was so hor@@ ri@@ fying that the care@@ rs and si@@ sters needed psycho@@ logical assistance .
k@@ ana had ad@@ mitted during the trial , during tat@@ night with boo@@ y@@ sen in a bar .
he also ad@@ mitted that they had be@@ aten and rap@@ ed them , but he denied that they were responsible for the death of the girl .
the police were initially run by several perpe@@ tr@@ ators , but dis@@ missed two susp@@ ects because the occup@@ ants had been unable to provide evidence .
the prosecu@@ tor also stressed during the procedure that it was convinced that k@@ ana was not ready at the time of the attack .
ra@@ pe has been a part of everyday life in south africa : there are around 64 000 indic@@ ations of sexual violence every year .
that is almost ten times the amount in germany , but it is far more popu@@ lated than south africa ( 50 million ) , with 82 million people .
police and women ’ s organisations in south africa es@@ timate the dark figure in sexual violence , but it is 10-@@ 25 times that .

they thought that travel agencies were a thing of the past thanks to the internet ?
flight centre seems to be resi@@ sting the trend .
the company has increased its profit prospects for the whole year and exp@@ ects record revenue from holi@@ day@@ makers in australia and the uk .
the travel company is now starting a adjusted annual profit before taxes between 3@@ 25 and 3@@ 40 million dollars , compared to 30@@ 5 to 3@@ 15 million dollars in its previous forec@@ ast .
if the current target values are met , that means growth of 12 to 17 % compared to record ear@@ nings of 2@@ 9@@ 0.@@ 4 million dollars in the period 2011 / 12 .
as managing director gra@@ ham tur@@ ner announced , flight centre achieved a total of eight percent profit and recorded a strong start to the second half of the year , especially in the austr@@ ali@@ an and british private sector .
“ since the beginning of the year , our ten countries have been prof@@ itable , and some of them are heading in the right direction for record year ear@@ nings before interest and taxes , ” he said .
these include australia and the united kingdom , which are typically among our strong@@ est ear@@ nings providers .
in australia , the leisure industry reco@@ vered in the second half of the year , which resulted in a slightly weak@@ er market for business trips .
the hotel is located in the heart of the city , just a few minutes walk from the main train station and the main shopping area .
the us business reco@@ vered from the weak@@ er seas@@ onal first half of the year , so that a profit for the total year was expected for the third con@@ secu@@ tive year .
the shares of flight centre increased yesterday by 3 c@@ ents to $ 3@@ 8.@@ 20 .
schools are becoming more focused on mathem@@ a@@ tics , sp@@ elling , and gram@@ mar .
in courses on english literature , students must in future study at least one piece of sha@@ kes@@ pe@@ are , a novel of the 19th century , romantic ly@@ ric@@ s and contemporary british nov@@ els from 19@@ 14 .
the test also includes “ un@@ seen texts ” to gain wider reading .
the combined english literature and language course will be abol@@ ished .
from 20@@ 15 , students must carry out an independent g@@ c@@ se language test , with strong incentives to study english literature as separate quality qualifications .
the ministry of education will tomorrow present the new english and mathem@@ a@@ tics cur@@ ricul@@ a – the first subjects that have been rad@@ ically re@@ designed .
other core subjects will be changed next year .
a separate initiative calls for the establishment of of@@ qua@@ al , the supervisory authority for aud@@ its , of a re@@ organization of the g@@ c@@ se structures , including a new ben@@ ding system and less pric@@ ing work .
in a speech in the summer , education minister michael go@@ ve said that there is “ broad consensus that we need to reform our aud@@ iting system in order to restore public confidence ” , emphasi@@ sing that the g@@ c@@ ses would “ challenge . ”
studies show that in english schools there is less time for mathem@@ a@@ tics – 1@@ 16 hours a year or three hours a week a school year – than in most other countries .
in contrast , austr@@ ali@@ an schools te@@ ach an average of 14@@ 3 hours a year and students in sing@@ apor@@ e receive 13@@ 8 hours .
although there will be no formal requirement to go on for mat@@ h in the timetable , there is no need for a coalition to make a decision on the comprehensive mat@@ h test , combined with a stronger emphasis on the subject in the various countries .
the cur@@ ricul@@ um focuses more on “ real life problems ” , including financial mathem@@ a@@ tics .

sal@@ em : joh@@ anna ra@@ h@@ ner at the ec@@ um@@ en@@ ical forum of inter@@ views in the ec@@ um@@ en@@ ical forum in vienna .
the next ec@@ um@@ en@@ ical forum on monday , 21 october , at the new museum of the castle , will deal with the topic &quot; to hel@@ l with hel@@ l - the@@ ological considerations on how to deal with the last things today &quot; .
lec@@ ture@@ r is professor joh@@ anna ra@@ h@@ ner .
the ec@@ um@@ en@@ ical forum is an initiative of the catho@@ lic and prote@@ stant church communities sal@@ em , the sal@@ em castle and the k@@ ul@@ tur@@ am@@ tes bo@@ den@@ see county .
joh@@ anna ra@@ h@@ ner wants to look at the forum on how people can now understand the &quot; last things &quot; after death .
if people had been able to learn too much about this over the past few centuries , and had put on those images of heav@@ en and hel@@ l that shape our ideas to this day , the contemporary pro@@ ph@@ et doc@@ tr@@ ine of the world .
&quot; the greater hope is christian women through the religious critique .
she has told us &apos; so many question marks that the ex@@ cl@@ am@@ ation marks have turned us off &apos; .
joh@@ anna ra@@ h@@ ner goes on to say : &quot; but the crucial challenge remains the an@@ ger of death &quot; .
this raises the question of the desire to &quot; dream of the world &apos;s end to be good &quot; .
joh@@ anna ra@@ h@@ ner , born in bad@@ en-@@ ba@@ den in 196@@ 2 , studied ca@@ th@@ ol@@ ic@@ ism and bio@@ logy at al@@ ber@@ t-@@ lu@@ d@@ wi@@ gs@@ -@@ university fre@@ i@@ burg from 198@@ 2 to 1989 .
she received her ph@@ d in 1997 , dr. the@@ ol , also in fre@@ i@@ burg .
the hab@@ itation of fundament@@ al@@ the@@ ology and ec@@ um@@ en@@ ical the@@ ology followed in 2003 at the west@@ ph@@ ali@@ an wil@@ hel@@ m@@ s-@@ university .
since 2010 joh@@ anna ra@@ h@@ ner has a chair for systematic the@@ ology at the institu@@ t für catho@@ lic the@@ ology of the university of kas@@ sel .
ge@@ is@@ ling@@ en : more than 100 young ca@@ th@@ ol@@ ics from kle@@ ine heu@@ berg confirm their faith in the company .
in two services 10@@ 1 15@@ - and 16@@ -@@ year-@@ old te@@ en@@ ag@@ ers of the sou@@ l@@ bound unit were fir@@ med at the small heu@@ berg .
the service was accompanied by the group lau@@ da@@ to-@@ si in the morning , in the afternoon of the spirit youth cho@@ ir .
with the reception of the fir@@ m@@ sac@@ ram@@ ent , the young people said yes to their b@@ ap@@ tism and asked the power of the holy g@@ host .
the fir@@ m@@ l@@ ings had changed in recent months , under the direction of di@@ ak@@ on rein@@ er de@@ h@@ ner and the help of numerous members of the municip@@ ality on the great festival .
in various projects they learned various tasks of christian community life and experienced together the youth day in underground and in un@@ ter@@ mach@@ tal .
ill@@ men@@ see : the second mountain bike race attrac@@ ts participants from all over the world .
in beautiful weather 2@@ 14 cy@@ cli@@ sts came to ill@@ men@@ see to take the tour of the hill cha@@ ins around the lake .
this is shared by ul@@ rich kno@@ bel from the sports club ill@@ men@@ see .
among the participants were , especially on the short distance over 15 kilometres and 300 metres of al@@ titude , numerous people who were cycling their ho@@ b@@ by once in bet@@ ting positions .
two junior ri@@ ders of the german top class were also on the start in this race : fe@@ li@@ x bad@@ er from bad wal@@ d@@ see and pas@@ cal tre@@ u@@ bel from a@@ ach@@ -@@ lin@@ z came with the recommendation to win good ran@@ k@@ ings .
these two were able to set@@ tle , as expected , from the field .
as in the previous year , fe@@ li@@ x bad@@ er was able to save a small time lead to the finish and def@@ ended his title as the overall winner of short distance .
in second place , pas@@ cal tre@@ u@@ bel was again able to place himself .
the ladies had a lot of fun with the al@@ b@@ dream team , which put it on the top of the winning sta@@ irs .
in second and third place , anne a@@ del from ill@@ men@@ see and leon@@ ie drivers from o@@ w@@ ingen came .
one welcome development is the increasing number of drivers who are in the community or who work .
not only in terms of performance , but also in terms of performance , the range of athle@@ tes was represented .
the age structure was also sufficient for the youn@@ g@@ est to over 70 years for the oldest star@@ ters .
the main race was even more top@@ a@@ thy at the start this year .
four drivers were able to get away from the top regional drivers .
among them phili@@ p@@ p pan@@ ger@@ l , a mountain bike semi-@@ pro from the black tus@@ k racing team .
pan@@ ger@@ l was two times world champi@@ on in the 12@@ -@@ hour driving together with a team colleague .
this year he became european champi@@ on in this special discipline .
ro@@ land b@@ aller@@ ste@@ dt , who has already won two german championship tit@@ les in the du@@ ath@@ l@@ on , is also playing his own .
after 45 kilometres and 9@@ 00 metres of al@@ titude , a wh@@ ir@@ l@@ pool finish was reached before the three-@@ sem@@ ester hall .
pan@@ ger@@ l was the first to reach the finish line .
only a second behind this was the rout@@ ine b@@ aller@@ ste@@ dt who won second place in the overall ran@@ king .
at the same time , her@@ mann and war@@ th@@ mann were the third of the overall ran@@ king .
in the ladies &apos; race , christi@@ ane co@@ h@@ s@@ mann was the fas@@ test in the main race .
second place was placed in are@@ ane bl@@ er@@ sch , which was under pressure from nat@@ as@@ ch@@ a wer@@ ner from stutt@@ gart .
athle@@ tes and help@@ ers were very pleased with the smooth and well-@@ organised process of the event .
on the way through mu@@ d , rivers and jun@@ g@@ le for free medical care
dr. geor@@ ges b@@ wel@@ le brings free medical assistance to remote villages in camer@@ o@@ on and the surrounding areas .
b@@ wel@@ le and his team spend nearly every weekend tre@@ ating hundreds of patients .
in the west african country , there are not many doctors , only one for 5@@ ,000 people .
vote here or with your mobile device .
dr. geor@@ ges b@@ wel@@ le is one of the top 10 of the “ c@@ n@@ n her@@ oes of 2013 ” .
you can choose for him or any of the other her@@ oes in the top 10 to make him the “ c@@ n@@ n her@@ o of the year ” .
the winner will receive $ 25@@ 0,000 to continue his exceptional work .
for 21 years , geor@@ ges b@@ wel@@ le saw his si@@ ck father again and again losing his consci@@ ousness and travelling to hospit@@ als that were unable to provide the necessary resources to help him .
j@@ ame@@ f b@@ wel@@ le was born in 198@@ 1 in a car accident near y@@ a@@ oun@@ d@@ é , the capital city of camer@@ o@@ on .
he had only one broken arm , but then the first one was an infl@@ am@@ mation , which was based on his brain .
“ there were no neu@@ ro@@ sur@@ ge@@ ons in camer@@ o@@ on , ” says geor@@ ges b@@ wel@@ le .
we should have brought him out of camer@@ o@@ on if we had had the money .
instead , b@@ wel@@ le spent years trying to trans@@ form his father into over@@ crow@@ ded clin@@ ics and hospit@@ als to ensure treatment there , which she could offer .
“ it is not easy , ” comments b@@ wel@@ le .
you can leave the house at 5 a.m. and run to the hospital to be the first , and is not the first .
there are a great many patients .
some people even die because they have to wait .
the situation has changed little since b@@ well &apos;s father died in 2002 .
in camer@@ o@@ on there is only one doctor for each 5@@ ,000 people , according to the world health organisation .
on the other hand , the relationship in the united states with a doctor is between 4@@ 13 people .
but even if there were a doctor for them , most camer@@ o@@ ons could not afford to visit .
two out of five people live below the poverty line and nearly three-@@ quarters of health spending in the country is private .
“ the only problem you have is poverty , ” says b@@ wel@@ le .
and poverty makes it impossible to enjoy life .
his father and so many of his comp@@ at@@ ri@@ ots had to see b@@ wel@@ le decide to do something about it .
dr. geor@@ ges b@@ wel@@ le and his team of volunte@@ ers have carried out 700 free operations last year .
he became a doctor himself and works as a v@@ as@@ cu@@ lar sur@@ ge@@ on in the central hospital in y@@ a@@ oun@@ d@@ é .
he also founded a non-@@ profit organization called as@@ co@@ vi@@ me , which is trans@@ ported to rural areas at week@@ ends and where free medical care is offered .
since 2008 he and his voluntary group have helped nearly 3@@ 2@@ ,000 people .
almost every friday , he and up to 30 people are forced into mini@@ buses and are driving with the s@@ no@@ op@@ ing medical equipment on the roof over un@@ pav@@ ed ter@@ rain to the villages that need help .
not always everything goes smo@@ o@@ thly .
they have had to drive the vehicles through rivers and mu@@ d more than once .
but when they arrive , they will receive like her@@ oes : a ban@@ quet , voc@@ als and dance and the best accommodation that the place has to offer .
in these villages , free medical care is really a reason for celebr@@ ation and sha@@ ft – with its broad sm@@ ile and its boun@@ dless energy – is happy to attend the happy celebr@@ ation .
the next morning the team will start investig@@ ating hundreds of patients .
“ we treat 500 people per trip ” , b@@ wel@@ le says .
they come from a radi@@ us of 60 kilometres around the village – and on foot .
each of these weekend clin@@ ics offers medical care in a number of areas .
many people are sent@@ enced to death for mal@@ aria , tu@@ ber@@ cu@@ lo@@ sis , mal@@ nutri@@ tion , di@@ abe@@ tes , par@@ a@@ sites and sex@@ ually transmitted diseases .
others receive cr@@ ut@@ ches , don@@ ated gl@@ asses or free birth certific@@ ates – a document that is needed for school , but many poor families simply cannot afford .
in the evening , the team carri@@ es out simple operations with local an@@ aes@@ the@@ sia .
the operations are usually carried out in a school , the town hall or an apartment ; after the procedure , the patients are up and go into the recre@@ ation area to make room for the next one .
the lighting for the op and the dis@@ inf@@ ection equipment is controlled by the group gener@@ ator and thus b@@ wave and its voluntary dis@@ inf@@ ection unit work until early morning hours .
it is a stren@@ u@@ ous effort , but the village musicians usually help to motiv@@ ate the team .
&quot; they are dr@@ um@@ ming all night so that we remain awa@@ ke and continue our work , &quot; says b@@ wel@@ le .
on sunday , the team will return to the city , ti@@ red but proud of the work done .
the group – a mix@@ ture of camer@@ o@@ on doctors and foreign medical students – has launched 700 free sur@@ ger@@ ies last year and knows that their work makes a huge difference to people who are helped .
a man explained that the free operation of a break@@ down he received would now allow him to return to work .
“ this changes my family ’ s future , ” he said .
in addition to the weekend clin@@ ics and his work as a sur@@ ge@@ on in the hospital , b@@ wel@@ le works at night in private clin@@ ics in y@@ a@@ oun@@ da .
with this second job he finances 60 % of his non-@@ profit activities , so b@@ wel@@ le ; the rest from private don@@ ations .
“ i really do not know when he sle@@ eps , ” says k@@ ati@@ e o &apos;@@ mal@@ ley , who died at dre@@ x@@ el university in phil@@ ade@@ l@@ phi@@ a medicine in the second year and volunte@@ ered in b@@ well ’ s group .
he is always either in hospital or trying to raise money for the organization so that he can go to these campaigns .
for medical and nur@@ sing students such as o &apos;@@ mal@@ ley , who come from the usa and europe and support b@@ wel@@ le , this is an opportunity to gain practical experience that they never had at home .
“ we can be present at operations where we help to ta@@ p blood or to use the instruments for dr. b@@ wel@@ le , ” says o &apos;@@ mal@@ ley .
that would have been a never in america as a medical student in the second year .
students pay their trip to camer@@ o@@ on usually by themselves and bring frequently don@@ ated san@@ itation materials .
but once you are in y@@ a@@ oun@@ d@@ é , b@@ wel@@ le will take care of the accommodation , transport and instruc@@ tion .
&quot; he is without doubt a her@@ o , &quot; says o &apos;@@ mal@@ ley .
he de@@ votes his life to this organization and his desire to help the camer@@ o@@ on people knows no b@@ ounds .
for b@@ wel@@ le , the almost permanent work is not a burden .
to make others a happ@@ i@@ er life and to fulfil a promise he made to his father is preparing him for great joy .
“ i am so happy when i do this work , ” says b@@ wel@@ le .
and i am thinking of my father .
i hope he sees what i do .
i do it to make people lau@@ gh again and to reli@@ eve the pain .
visit the as@@ co@@ vi@@ me website and learn how to help .
excellent the fight managed by the team .
the role of s@@ anti@@ ago , the old man in hem@@ ing@@ way &apos;s nov@@ elle &quot; the old man and the sea &quot; , is hor@@ st j@@ ans@@ on cut to the body .
jan@@ son was a very old h@@ are in his me@@ ti@@ er , the ac@@ tress .
the old man s@@ anti@@ ago cannot be de@@ lu@@ ded to anything in fishing .
the two are simply great comple@@ ments .
it is almost thought that the wr@@ ink@@ les in the nec@@ k of the old man , the fisher@@ man &apos;s boy talking about , can be seen .
when s@@ anti@@ ago is ti@@ red of life on the chair , it is not so for jan@@ son .
in addition , the role of the old fisher@@ man is through and through a role of character that jan@@ son excell@@ ently master@@ s. the role of the old fishermen is to be found in the world of the fish .
hem@@ ing@@ way told the story of a figh@@ ter , a cour@@ ageous man who did not give up and who was ultimately defe@@ ated by his knowledge and his will to fight the fish .
j@@ ans@@ on is widely regarded as the sing@@ er on stage .
it man@@ ages to attract the attention of the audience .
his efforts to finally get the fish to the surface of the water are so real that the spec@@ t@@ ators forget that the sea is only made of blue light .
director j@@ ens has@@ sel@@ mann leaves the old man in the boat in front of the fishing village .
during the performance , he puts the active scene in the light : the cab@@ in of s@@ anti@@ ago , the bar of sing@@ er mari@@ e-@@ lu@@ ise gun@@ st , the bar with her songs and her magnificent voice .
the four musicians play cuba &apos;s rhy@@ th@@ m and are also guests of the bar .
tourism : des@@ cent to the roman@@ s
the area is about 120 metres long and under@@ ne@@ ath cologne is a roman was@@ te@@ water channel .
the cathedral is not far away .
the two to@@ wers stand out in the sky about 15@@ 7 metres and make it the second highest church building in europe .
but few visitors who visit the two f@@ ili@@ gre@@ e church to@@ wers , can imagine that it is also under the cathedral a lot to discover .
ra@@ iner schul@@ ze is an expert in the cologne underground world .
the meeting point for his guided tours is the service centre of cologne tourism directly at the dom .
the tour starts quite un@@ spectacular : &quot; we start in the underground car park &quot; , says schul@@ ze .
in the 197@@ 0s , the city fa@@ thers wanted to build a city that was accessible by car , and therefore remained only the standing of the remains of the old city wall .
most users of the multi-@@ sto@@ rey car park are therefore also hur@@ ried by the roman remains and are only leaving their cars .
but if you look more closely , the par@@ k@@ dec@@ k d@@ 2 disco@@ vers a metal gri@@ d tri@@ be that separ@@ ates the archae@@ ological site .
the ru@@ ins of hand@@ -@@ leg@@ ged buildings are about five metres high .
&quot; they are rem@@ n@@ ants of the roman city wall that were built in the second half of the first century to christ , &quot; schul@@ ze says .
before we go back to the day@@ light , schul@@ ze leaves the participants at the upper level a look at a dark 15 meter deep water ch@@ ess .
this is the foun@@ tain of the old cathedral , which is unfortunately hardly seen .
the next stop of the tour is the pre@@ tori@@ um , and here the participants go down again into the dep@@ ths .
we are witn@@ essing the seat of the once most powerful man north of the alps , the pre@@ dec@@ essor of the c@@ ca@@ a .
what c@@ ca@@ a means , a visitor wants to know .
&quot; the ab@@ bre@@ vi@@ ation stands for &quot; col@@ onia cla@@ u@@ dia ara ag@@ ri@@ pp@@ in@@ en@@ si@@ um &quot; , which in good german means &quot; city of roman law and town of ag@@ ri@@ pp@@ in@@ en@@ ser , founded under emper@@ or .
and the pre@@ tori@@ um is the former sta@@ at@@ hal@@ ter palace , the center of power of the roman empire on the rh@@ ine .
from the fo@@ o@@ th@@ ills of the exhibition there is a tunnel access to the roman se@@ wage canal , which is preserved here at about 120 meters .
&quot; you can easily find a piece along the so-called clo@@ ac@@ a maxim@@ a if you want , &quot; jo@@ ins schul@@ ze the guests .
schul@@ ze still has a surprise .
after having collected the key at the cash desk , he will lead the group to a 16 meter deep , wal@@ k@@ able sha@@ ft .
&quot; we are now in the mi@@ k@@ we , a rit@@ ual jewish bath , &quot; he explains .
the jewish community built its bath deep into the ground to think of gr@@ ound@@ water , which is essential for rit@@ ual wash@@ ings .
to this day , the lower end of the mi@@ k@@ we , whose origin@@ s date back to the eigh@@ th century , has seen different water levels being read@@ able through var@@ ying levels of the rh@@ ine .
mi@@ k@@ we is part of an archae@@ ological area on the town hall square , for which construction work is due to start soon .
however , a few years will pass by before completion .
le@@ g almost h@@ acked : new version of ro@@ ck@@ er process
a bloo@@ dy attack in the ro@@ ck@@ er@@ mil@@ i@@ eu will be re@@ rou@@ ted after more than four years .
a trial of attemp@@ ted man@@ slau@@ ghter , dangerous body in@@ jury and material damage against two thir@@ ty years has been fil@@ ed before the district court of frankfurt ( oder ) .
it is accompanied by strict security measures .
the accused remained silent at the start .
they are supposed to have been active in the rock scene and at that time they were among the ban@@ di@@ dos .
the prosecu@@ tor acc@@ uses you of having , in june 2009 , together with unknown accompl@@ ices in fin@@ ow@@ furt , to have thro@@ wn three men in a car and be@@ aten them .
all victims were seriously in@@ ju@@ red , a man would almost have lost his le@@ g .
victims are to become the compe@@ ting group of hel@@ l ’ s ang@@ els .
one is to be a high-@@ ran@@ king member from berlin .
it would appear that a hun@@ t of several cars was carried out prior to that .
the charge was that there were batt@@ les with the tur@@ ks and a demonstration of power .
the two accused were in a first trial in early 2012 .
a court spo@@ kes@@ man said at the time that it was impossible to prove that men were not involved in the bloo@@ dy f@@ eu@@ d .
the perpe@@ tr@@ ators had wor@@ n mas@@ ks and were not recognized .
the federal court of justice re@@ vo@@ ked the judgment after the public prosecu@@ tor &apos;s review and pointed it to the court for further negotiation .
one of the accused is currently imprison@@ ed for another off@@ ence .
the first was the re@@ construc@@ ting of the processes in the tat@@ n@@ ach@@ t .
as a witness , the commissioner who was appointed at the time was invited .
the centre was the phone calls of the def@@ end@@ ants and other people who had inter@@ cep@@ ted the police .
it is difficult that ro@@ ck@@ ers almost always have to go to court to comply with a law that is worthy of them - and not statements .
this also applies to victims .
in the first process , only one of the victims had been un@@ packed .
prosecu@@ tor ste@@ fan gol@@ fi@@ er of the public prosecu@@ tor &apos;s office in frankfurt ( oder ) said on request that new trac@@ es have been found since the last trial .
ele@@ ven further negotiating days have been set for the process .
the dispos@@ able society does not think
the night was long , the music l@@ oud and the mo@@ od good , but eventually it goes home .
but in the trees of the people on the fron@@ t-@@ passenger and re@@ ar seat , hun@@ ger is notic@@ eable .
of course , some cock@@ tail or champ@@ ag@@ ne may be responsible for this !
what is more obvious than to go to the next drive in order to get a little bit more fun ?
i admit that i am happy to be part of this when it comes to late night or early morning .
a few pom@@ mes , a col@@ a , a bur@@ ger - and then ni@@ x as well home and in bed !
but , on their way home , the obvious differences between me and other hun@@ gr@@ y dis@@ co go@@ ers are notic@@ eable .
what is the reason for this ?
the hotel is located in the heart of the city , in the heart of the old town , just a few minutes walk from the main railway station .
&apos;@@ why ? &apos; i wonder .
are people too do@@ of to take the bags home with respect until the next tr@@ ash b@@ in ?
it is not just the case that the paper product is mis@@ appropri@@ ating the landscape .
the bags have already been used to cover transport facilities such as the central plan@@ ks , thereby causing accidents .
what does this mean to the &quot; dispos@@ able society &quot; , but not after , probably she does not even know what that word actually means .
the hotel is located in a quiet area , close to the main railway station and the city centre .
there would be a couple of bags more or less even no@@ where - unlike the road where no one is on the lef@@ to@@ vers of other rum@@ s@@ fel@@ ts .
i can see that the day is coming when the cities and communities are being left to f@@ ester - and the fa@@ st-@@ food industry cha@@ ins for their p@@ ants are being asked to pay .
obama ’ s re@@ treat in health policy
after intense criticism , president obama yesterday made a back@@ ward move to his frequently repeated , un@@ ambigu@@ ous promise : “ if you like your health insurance , you can keep it . ”
after hundreds of thousands of their insu@@ rers have received a letter of notice , the republic@@ ans have sent the president a letter of warning in recent days that he has mis@@ led the american public .
yesterday , obama rela@@ ti@@ sed his initial promise .
“ the vast majority of citizens who want a functioning health insurance can keep it , ” he said at a speech in bo@@ ston .
in response to the numerous media reports on the announ@@ c@@ ements , obama called on those americans who received such communications to engage in free markets for a new insurance policy .
most citizens could thus have better , more comprehensive health insurance at the same price or more cheap@@ ly than anticip@@ ated .
“ you get a better offer , ” he said .
the government has not been surprised to see that the five percent of the population that has insurance themselves are looking for a different rate .
“ i want to say to these americans quite directly : they deserve better , ” se@@ beli@@ us said at a hearing before the energy and trade committee of the house of representatives in washington .
se@@ beli@@ us , who is responsible for implementing the affordable care act , is not responsible for the launch of the online platform since october .
“ i am equally fru@@ stra@@ ted and an@@ gr@@ y as anyone else , ” she said .
i am determined to reg@@ ain your trust .
this phrase of an ex@@ ci@@ ted se@@ beli@@ us to a consult@@ ant behind her sitting at yesterday &apos;s hearing in the representative &apos;s house was rejected after a dispute with the republic@@ an member , bil@@ ly long .
after more than three hours of consultation , long se@@ beli@@ us repeatedly pressed with the question why the “ architec@@ t ” of the affir@@ able c@@ are act was not released volun@@ tar@@ ily .
government in jerusal@@ em confir@@ ms attack on sy@@ ri@@ an air base not only on syria ’ s air base , but also on syria ’ s air base .
an american government official who wanted to remain anonymous has made a statement to the american news channel , c@@ n@@ n , on thursday , that israeli figh@@ ter aircraft have a day before fil@@ ed an air force base in syria ’ s la@@ ir .
the aim is &apos; missi@@ les and related equipment &apos; , from which the israeli government fe@@ ared that they would be responsible for the leban@@ ese he@@ z@@ bol@@ lah , he@@ z@@ bol@@ lah said it was &apos; c@@ n@@ n &apos; .
sy@@ ri@@ an and leban@@ ese media , as well as the arab al-@@ arab@@ i@@ ya channel , had previously reported that the base in the port city of lat@@ ak@@ ia was on thursday at night .
the israeli television channel channel 2 showed satellite pictures of the base in lat@@ ak@@ ia , where russian ab@@ sten@@ tion missi@@ les were launched from the s-@@ 12@@ 5 new@@ a type and a battery of sa@@ -@@ 3 missi@@ les .
un@@ certain the government in jerusal@@ em has officially not confirmed the attack .
however , the news agency re@@ u@@ ters quo@@ tes a similarly anonymous israeli government official , saying that he believes that israel is carrying out the attack , but that he is not sure .
a spo@@ kes@@ man of the israeli ministry of defence said , &apos; we are not comm@@ enting on these reports &apos; .
the journ@@ alist ron ben@@ -@@ y@@ is@@ ha@@ i stressed in the daily ye@@ di@@ oth ah@@ ron@@ ot@@ h , that the sy@@ ri@@ an regime had already , in some cases , successfully tried to establish ground air missi@@ les in the air .
the israeli government has repeatedly war@@ ned that any attempt by syria to stop he@@ z@@ bol@@ lah from using chemical or other dangerous weapons would be unacceptable .
john ker@@ ry explains in an unprecedented admission that the us economy is now under@@ going “ un@@ due ” and that the us es@@ pi@@ on@@ age is “ going too far . ”
john ker@@ ry suggested with an un@@ expected admission that the us would weak@@ en its def@@ ensive stance in relation to its surveillance challenges .
the foreign minister also ad@@ mitted that he was wrong with bar@@ ack obama to take responsibility for “ auto@@ pi@@ ot ” .
the le@@ ak@@ ed information has made the us government into a diplomatic stor@@ m of indi@@ gn@@ ation on the part of its allies .
a video con@@ vers@@ ation at the open government conference in london , ker@@ ry said : “ there is no question that the president and i , and others in the government , have learned of some of the things that are almost automatic pil@@ ots .
he was the first senior member of the us government to admit that the us sp@@ ying was a border cros@@ sed , emphasi@@ zing that the us was not a right ab@@ used .
he said , ‘ in some cases this has gone too far in@@ appropri@@ ately . ’
the president is determined to create clarity , and therefore carri@@ es out a thorough investigation so that no one has to feel that abuse is taking place .
i assure you that the rights of inno@@ cent people will not be com@@ promised in this process .
ker@@ ry insi@@ sted , however , that the n@@ sa was a force of good , and that its surveillance operations saved many lives .
he added : “ we are facing a new world in which people are ready to move themselves into the air . ”
there is radical extre@@ mis@@ m in the world that is an@@ x@@ ious to kill people , in which the world is bur@@ ied and governments are att@@ acked .
so what if you were able to catch up and stop this , before it happened ?
we do indeed have aircraft cr@@ ash@@ es , attacks on buildings and the murder of people , because we have been very vig@@ il@@ ant in the run@@ -up to such plans .
meanwhile , us legisl@@ ators will travel to europe to raise concerns about the alleg@@ ed american es@@ pi@@ on@@ age and to convince europeans of the need to stop the us anti-@@ terrorist attacks .
sen@@ ator chr@@ is mur@@ ph@@ y from connec@@ tic@@ ut said that he met with representatives of the european parliament and others this week and was concerned about their threats to withdraw from the debate because of fru@@ stration .
“ it is very important for the national security interests of the us that europeans are more sensitive to the threat of terrorism than they are to our common efforts against terrorism , ” said mur@@ ph@@ y , who was first in the sen@@ ate as a democr@@ at .
i am also going to europe to make it clear that we must continue to work together in the fight against terrorism , ir@@ respective of their an@@ ger over the n@@ sa programmes .
media reports that the n@@ sa has collected millions of telephone data in europe have improved relations with some us allies , although the us government director has not yet taken any notice of the reports being in@@ accurate .
other rev@@ el@@ ations quo@@ ted from snow@@ den &apos;s handed documents that n@@ sa would not use the phone of chancell@@ or ang@@ ela mer@@ kel and until the age of 34 other state leaders .
the head of the national intelligence services , james cla@@ pper , def@@ ended the sp@@ ying of allies as necessary and declared that this was custom@@ ary on both sides .
in all the t@@ um@@ ult , mur@@ ph@@ y said that his authority was preparing the congress ’ s trip , which is due to take place this year , and hoped that the delegation would include members from both parties and cham@@ bers .
the names of the other members present will be published in the coming days .
he said that the exact route is still being prepared .
while mur@@ ph@@ y emphasi@@ zed that the purpose of the journey was to improve relations , he also said that there were some “ serious words . ”
he said that european governments must be honest with their people about the kind of sp@@ y programmes they have been using for years .
“ while we can change our surveillance programs , thus better protecting europeans ’ rights , they must also address the fact that they are not the only ones to protect spir@@ its . ”
meanwhile , john ker@@ ry is on a weekend trip to the middle east and poland to get to gri@@ ps with the res@@ ent@@ ment of the us strategy in syria , egypt , and iran , as well as the us surveillance activities .

austr@@ ali@@ an appe@@ als for prison sent@@ ences in thailand .
a 2@@ 1-@@ year-@@ old sy@@ d@@ ney woman who was 15 days in prison in ph@@ uk@@ et because she was wr@@ ong@@ ly claim@@ ing to be being tor@@ tured by a taxi driver .
ste@@ vi@@ e ro@@ ch@@ elle b@@ am@@ ford was first tried by a provin@@ cial court in ph@@ uk@@ et on 15 june , a false statement was made .
later , however , the sho@@ ts of a video camera showed that she had safe@@ ly reached her hotel after being separated from her austr@@ ali@@ an friend .
the police in ph@@ uk@@ et inter@@ ro@@ g@@ ated b@@ am@@ ford for two days until they knew that history had been thought out .
until the trial , it was in police cust@@ o@@ dy on the ground .
b@@ am@@ ford was sent@@ enced to a 15@@ -@@ day prison sentence in a de@@ tention centre with a low security level on the out@@ sk@@ ir@@ ts of ph@@ uk@@ et , instead of being in a prison for adult women .
she is the daughter of peter tun@@ ks , a former player of the austr@@ ali@@ an rub@@ g@@ y-@@ league , who has been appointed to the foreign ministry in can@@ ber@@ ra to help his daughter .
tun@@ ks explained to the sunday te@@ leg@@ raph in sy@@ d@@ ney that the whole family is “ extremely wor@@ ried ” about the well-being of his daughter and wanted to have them back in australia .
“ we are of course very concerned , but we hope that you will return home as soon as possible , ” said tun@@ ks .
b@@ am@@ ford appe@@ aled against the judgment and is liable for a deposit of 5@@ 0.@@ 000 ba@@ ht at free foot .
austr@@ ali@@ an reports read that they have been in the meantime in the resort kr@@ ab@@ i in southern thailand .
the court of justice has said that b@@ am@@ ford is being replaced by a local law@@ yer in ph@@ uk@@ et and is being war@@ ned that the appeal will also lead to the im@@ position of a higher penalty of up to two years in prison .
however , it is also possible that , following the recent ass@@ ass@@ ination of mic@@ hel@@ le sm@@ ith in ph@@ uk@@ et , thailand will be trying to stop its be@@ le@@ agu@@ ered tourist destination image .
