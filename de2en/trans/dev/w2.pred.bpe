opinions on the subject : even more safety for pede@@ stri@@ ans .
they are not 100 metres apart , and the next morning is the official opening of the new b 3@@ 3-@@ foot walk in the report .
two plants as close to each other : intention or tur@@ tle tor@@ to@@ ise ?
this question has been examined by the may@@ or of the city yesterday .
&quot; the town hall museum is a unique place to visit , because it was the school path &quot; , explains the author of the book yesterday .
the club members &apos; lights safe both cycling and walking .
the commission &apos;s communication on the future of the european union , which was officially launched yesterday , is important for the sul@@ z@@ b@@ ach@@ we@@ g / kir@@ ch@@ stra@@ ß@@ e crossing area .
we have the museum , two churches , spa park , the bus stop , a doctor and a bank as well as the flow of traffic from the residential area of › gru@@ b � .
&quot; the high traffic and traffic volume of the city is a result of the need for further traffic lights &quot; , says ec@@ ker@@ t .
this also confir@@ ms peter ar@@ no@@ ld from the regional council of off@@ enburg .
&quot; according to current measure@@ ments , the b 33 daily passes about 12 000 vehicles through the municip@@ ality of gu@@ t@@ ach , of which about 10 % are heavy goods traffic , &quot; emphasi@@ zes ar@@ no@@ ld .
therefore , the construction of another traffic light is more than necessary : &quot; safety simply goes ahead &quot; , ar@@ n@@ old said .
overall , four traffic shows have been carried out , including a circu@@ lar traffic , but due to the narrow in the area of sul@@ z@@ b@@ ach@@ we@@ g / kir@@ ch@@ stra@@ ß@@ e again dis@@ car@@ ded .
it was named after ar@@ no@@ ld at the location of the traffic light ma@@ sts .
the approximately 15 000 euros expensive am@@ pe@@ res themselves are the &apos; most modern , most efficient &apos; system in the market at present .
the complex is equipped with col@@ oured le@@ ds , which are so powerful that it is possible to see the lights from the car drivers , for example , even in the sun@@ ni@@ est .
and econom@@ ical , it is also : the older light installations use about 100 wat@@ ts , which are new just eight wat@@ ts .
the journey is about three light hours per direction .
ar@@ no@@ ld explained the technique of the new system : it is equipped with two rad@@ ar sen@@ sors .
if the pede@@ strian is pus@@ hing the traffic light button , the upper traffic light tests the speed of traffic and determin@@ es the distance to the pede@@ strian area .
is the road free , comes immediately green for the pede@@ strian .
another ra@@ id@@ -@@ sensor checks whether the rad@@ ar &apos;s green phase is suitable for pede@@ stri@@ ans .
&quot; if a group or handic@@ app@@ ed people should go across the street , the green phase will be extended , so everyone will come safe@@ ly across the road , &quot; explained ar@@ no@@ ld .
of course , the drivers must be seen as partners here and the track must be monitored .
this was not the case yesterday : hardly had the traffic light shown for pede@@ stri@@ ans green , noise and a high class car .

a black@@ box in the car ?
american road plans
the devices that are used to detec@@ t each kil@@ ome@@ tre of danger and send information to the authorities are the core of a controversial experim@@ ent by washington and the plan committee .
the usually s@@ lower system of the road planning has suddenly become a more intense debate with colour@@ ful al@@ li@@ ances .
liber@@ t@@ arian parties have dealt with environmental groups and speak out in favour of the eu government taking the small boxes to the tun@@ e of the danger kilometres – and possibly also , where they are being driven .
the tea party is a hor@@ ri@@ ble party .
the american civil rights association ( ac@@ l@@ u ) is also deeply concerned about the situation and is making a number of concerns about data protection .
but , while in congress , the focus is not on a course of action , several states are no longer waiting .
you are currently exam@@ ining how you can make a contribution to a system over the next ten years , with drivers being able to earn a mil@@ e@@ age per driver .
thousands of car drivers have taken the road rec@@ orders , from which some have been equipped with g@@ ps monitoring , and the number of them has been tested .
this is a must for our country .
“ it is nothing that we can only possibly use ” , said ha@@ z@@ an i@@ kh@@ ram@@ a , managing director of so@@ ut@@ ther@@ n cell technology .
the way in which the european union hand@@ les these taxes will change .
the technology for this is there .
the initiative comes at a time when the high-@@ way trust fund is being set up from the taxes .
but in america , no longer so much is being done .
cars con@@ sume less petro@@ l .
the state min@@ eral oil tax of 18@@ .@@ 4 c@@ ents per gall@@ on ( less than 4 euros ) is a major factor in the price of oil for 20 years .
politicians d@@ are to make money from high prices , even if they are paying a pen@@ ny .
“ the petro@@ l tax is simply not sustainable , ” says le@@ e m@@ un@@ n@@ ich , a expert in petro@@ l legislation at the university of min@@ n@@ es@@ ot@@ a .
his state has recently received 500 cars with driver &apos;s rights .
“ this is the most sensible solution in the long term , ” he said .
bureaucr@@ ats call it a me@@ tric by which they can earn a lot of money .
it is not surprising that the idea of urban liber@@ als is not always the same , because the tax could be used , for example , to influence driving behaviour in such a way that cong@@ es@@ tion and cli@@ ma@@ te-@@ dam@@ aging emissions can be reduced .
cali@@ for@@ ian pl@@ ann@@ ers rely on the system for the development of strategies to help the ambitious and the un@@ predic@@ table goals of the state .
but the republic@@ an bill has been sh@@ ou@@ ting for the us from pen@@ n@@ sy@@ l@@ v@@ ania , chairman of the house transport committee .
the free circulation of goods and services in the reach foundation is also dependent on the idea of driving drivers back to work .
“ this is not a tax that is applied in a black hole . ” he explains .
people are paying directly for what they do get .
the movement is also supported by two former us transport ministers who have been in a report in 2011 to the congress .
the us sen@@ ate approved the draft resolution last year , which is $ 90 million expensive pilot project , covering 10@@ ,000 cars .
but the majority in the house of representatives prevented the incident from happening and respon@@ ded to the concerns of many members of parliament from rural areas who represent people who are in their everyday lives often miles on the road to work or in the city .
several states and large cities are moving in a similar direction .
the most dedicated part of the project is o@@ reg@@ on , which currently employ@@ s 5@@ ,000 drivers for the country ’ s largest experim@@ ent .
these drivers will soon be taking the mil@@ e@@ age charges instead of the tax on petro@@ le@@ um to the state .
ne@@ v@@ ada has already developed a pilot project .
new york city is also considering such a scheme .
il@@ lin@@ o@@ is tests it in limited quantities .
and the i-@@ 9@@ 5-@@ coalition is now in a position to make a significant contribution to the transport mini@@ stri@@ es of 17 states on the east coast ( including mar@@ y@@ land , pen@@ n@@ sy@@ l@@ v@@ ania , vir@@ g@@ ini@@ a , and fl@@ ori@@ da ) .
the concept is not a universal hit .
in ne@@ v@@ ada , where recently 50 volunte@@ ers with the equipment , were able to buy cars from s@@ cep@@ tical about the possibility of the government taking each of its movements .
“ concerns about big brother and such things were a big problem , ” explains al@@ au@@ d ’ s chief econom@@ ist , “ the world ’ s most important strategic and outcome management system in ne@@ v@@ ada .
people wanted to not .
when the test was in , i war@@ ned ac@@ l@@ u of ne@@ v@@ ada to take it on their website : “ it would be relatively easy to use the tac@@ ho@@ graph in full-@@ grown surveillance devices .
it insi@@ sts on no need to create a gi@@ gan@@ tic , bul@@ ky technological infrastructure that will inevitably lead to a reduction in the number of data on the daily movements of individuals and will help to improve the quality of life of the individual .
ne@@ v@@ ada is one of a number of states that are now looking for affordable technology .
with this , he said , the world would also be reas@@ su@@ red .
the hun@@ t for this technology has led some authorities to a small star@@ t-@@ up company called true mil@@ e@@ age in california .
the company was originally not joined , to establish states in the taxation of car drivers .
rather , it was their aim to create a new market for motor vehicle manufacturers , which is emerging as a market where drivers on the basis of risk and safety are paying for miles .
but the measures it has tested are not the same for road planning .
“ people are more willing to take part in it , if their speed and location are not increased , ” says the president of the commission , ry@@ an mor@@ ris@@ on , who is managing true mil@@ e@@ age .
in some of these public pilot programmes , major mistakes have been made .
there are much cheaper and less in@@ tru@@ sive ways of doing this .
in o@@ reg@@ on , we experim@@ ent with the possibility of using car drivers to build a series of choices .
you can register for a device with or without g@@ ps .
or you don &apos;t choose any device and pay a flat rate instead based on the average size of all inhabitants of the state .
others are ho@@ ping to develop the concept of a di@@ str@@ ust public , by giving the app@@ li@@ ances with more functions .
in new york city , transport officials want to use a tax instrument to control the economy of parking fees .
“ drivers would be encouraged to use the added value of the benefits that the system offers to them . ”
some transport pl@@ ann@@ ers wonder , however , whether the whole talk about paying per m@@ ile is not just a huge waste of money .
in the metro@@ politan area of the com@@ it@@ ology , the commission is responsible for the area of the san francis@@ co bay , the congress could decide to solve the problem of bank@@ ru@@ pt h@@ w@@ y fund simply by increasing the fuel tax .
an additional one-@@ time fee or annual fee is not applicable to car drivers with hy@@ bri@@ d vehicles or other vehicles that are less petro@@ l .
“ there is no reason for an operation when a patient ’ s asp@@ ir@@ in is sufficient , ” explains ran@@ dy r@@ ä@@ s@@ ler , head of legislation and public affairs in the commission .
if we do that , the hundreds of millions of car drivers will worry about their privacy .

it is said that a short circuit is to be created during sa@@ wing .
the dec@@ om@@ mis@@ sion@@ ing of the fire and the smo@@ ke were in@@ ju@@ red two people , but one of them was able to send an emergency call .
two bre@@ a@@ thing protection agents of the armed forces made their way to the ground after the first examination of the matter by h@@ ans kam@@ mer@@ er .
after a short time , the first stage of the process was to find and enter the open .
the second person had to be wor@@ n .
this was not so easy , as a close relationship with the other side of the road was also to be overcome .
the building , a workshop with integrated technology , is a perfect place for two horses .

there was also electric s@@ coo@@ ter for wo@@ od@@ working .
the first ext@@ ingu@@ ishing attack took place over the tan@@ k in the vehicle .
another line was taken by a super@@ charged cable and a hy@@ dr@@ ate in about 100 meters distance .
now three ho@@ les were created to prevent the damage .
the new version of the &quot; ho@@ h@@ l@@ be@@ wer@@ hr &quot; was also used in the building .
h@@ ans kam@@ mer@@ er was involved in the exercise also to find out what is happening with little available .
in case of emergency , support is provided via the day@@ -to-@@ day operations group kö@@ ni@@ gs@@ fel@@ d .
the comm@@ ander showed himself to be a little more than happy with the course of the exercise .
net@@ working of high-@@ tech and companies is important .
on his visit to the district of bre@@ is@@ gau@@ -@@ ho@@ ch@@ sch@@ war@@ z@@ wal@@ d , the president of the county of lan@@ ding , gui@@ do wol@@ f , also visited ti@@ tis@@ e@@ e-@@ neu@@ stadt , where the work@@ force of tomorrow comes from .
in the ho@@ ch@@ sch@@ war@@ z@@ wal@@ d support centre , he went to the vocational training school and the district school administration to develop the training programs and the paren@@ tal advisory board of this important issue .

since 2011 , the forests region has had a successful cooperation between the conve@@ y@@ or centre , kre@@ is@@ gy@@ m@@ na@@ si@@ um and vocational school centre .
the commission also p@@ raised the family-@@ friendly nature of the region .
&quot; it is important not only to protect the family phase in view , but also to be able to adapt to the phase of family care due to demographic change .
moreover , he said that the number of jobs in the european union is increasing .
&quot; without the support of employers , the resulting social and economic crisis can be a serious threat to workers &apos; jobs .
but no one can afford to be qualified workers .
another important point is the fact that the european union is net@@ working universities and businesses .
&quot; for anyone who has been a student at the university of munich has had the opportunity to experience the benefits of the region with his knowledge and skills .
only if sufficient information is available can we ensure that the european union &apos;s skilled labour needs are covered .
in his opinion , the re@@ location advantage of the district is its advant@@ ageous location in the south-@@ west of germany , close to france and the swiss .
in addition , he experienced a lot of new problems during his train journey from ti@@ tis@@ e@@ e-@@ neu@@ stadt to fre@@ i@@ burg .

the over 100 years old natural stone wall as the front divi@@ ding line of the area before the renov@@ ation was used for church street .
in the days before the kil@@ big , the first round of work of the reconstruction of the front school building was a small corner wall , to stab@@ ili@@ ze and sta@@ tic relief of the more than one hundred years old stone wall with bal@@ u@@ str@@ ade .
the way forward is to ensure that alexander mil@@ o@@ se@@ vic , from the tan@@ ning district of br@@ ä@@ un@@ ling@@ en , has the national mon@@ ument office in the planning process and that a reconstruction plan is drawn up for the old wall .
after that , a cost calcul@@ ation is to be carried out by experts who will then be submitted to the local council for decision and decision on the further action .
a decision on this will probably be taken next year .
the san@@ at@@ ori@@ um is the most important building in the area , and the first one is the sch@@ ul@@ in@@ en@@ hof ( old ) .
the historic , one hundred years old de@@ mar@@ c@@ ation wall of the old school cour@@ ty@@ ard to the church road , is especially famous for its water and fro@@ st damage , as there is no dra@@ in@@ age .
deep cr@@ acks in individual stones testi@@ fy to the weather damage , but it is the wall that is not at present at risk of collapse .
a stead@@ y wall is a pre@@ requisite for a student to use schul@@ hof , which is confirmed by the current fix@@ ing work .
originally , the school cour@@ ty@@ ard was already in use in the years 2008 / 2009 , but high un@@ planned expenditure bro@@ ke a shift in the budget .
an important word in the historical school wall analysis of the situation , which has even been used for film rec@@ ord@@ ings , is the mon@@ ument of the country .
if you do not have any information on this page , then the city of br@@ ä@@ un@@ ling@@ en hopes to receive grants from the preser@@ vation department .
students of the br@@ ä@@ un@@ ling@@ er ele@@ mentary school , who have now been re@@ built in a well-@@ renovated old school building with new a@@ ula , can soon learn the old school cour@@ ty@@ ard .
ö@@ z@@ dem@@ ir wants to introduce jazz education in stutt@@ gart .
the continued efforts of the european union to promote the future of music universities in bad@@ en-@@ w@@ ür@@ t@@ tem@@ berg have now been reflected in ce@@ m ö@@ z@@ dem@@ ir , federal chairman of the greens .
&quot; i think it is wrong to use the ho@@ lis@@ tic training in music college stutt@@ gart as a way of promoting the development of the new musical culture .
jazz in the classical music scene is part of the jazz scene in stutt@@ gart .
this is what ö@@ z@@ dem@@ ir , who is in stutt@@ gart as a fav@@ ou@@ ri@@ tes for a direct mandate with the bun@@ de@@ sta@@ g on 22 september , is opposed to , the green red state government .
these are the main forces on the basis of an expert study , which will bring about a re@@ organization of the five music col@@ leg@@ es in bad@@ en-@@ w@@ ür@@ t@@ tem@@ berg .
after that , the study programme will be directed to jazz and pop , among others , by the stutt@@ gart university of music , to the man@@ n@@ heim university of music .
us border : &quot; super@@ -@@ tunnel &quot; to the drug s@@ mu@@ gg@@ ling discovered by the police .
at the border between mexico and the us , investig@@ ators have found a &apos; super tunnel &apos; to the drug s@@ mu@@ gg@@ ling and have been sh@@ ut down .
as the us customs authorities have said , the situation in the country , which is more than 500 metres long , has been very similar to that of ti@@ ju@@ ana and san di@@ e@@ go with electricity , railway tracks and an air conditioning system .
three susp@@ ects are arrested and sent@@ enced to three years &apos; imprison@@ ment .
the tunnel was the only one in the world to use , according to the information .
&quot; this car@@ te@@ ls are st@@ up@@ id when they think they could be put under the rad@@ ar .
the drug gan@@ gs are being insu@@ red by du@@ ff@@ y : &quot; if you continue to use these tun@@ nels and try to use them , we are determined to do so at a huge cost to your dir@@ ty money .
both the us authorities and the mex@@ ic@@ an security forces are in a state of permanent struggle against the drug car@@ te@@ ls .
since 2006 , in mexico , more than 7@@ 7@@ ,@@ 00@@ 0,000 people have been killed in connection with drug crime .
experts designed and built by experts , the company is able to offer a wide range of products and services .
due to the complex equipment of the tunnel , the construction of the tunnel is based on the as@@ sumption that it is built by architec@@ ts and engineers and that the construction is about one year old .
the track is a great way to get to know the people who are using electr@@ ically operated cars .
on mex@@ ic@@ an side , access is in a building that has 80 meters from the border .
according to the authorities , a lad@@ der leads 20 meters into the depth to the actual entrance of the tunnel .
the tunnel has a cross section of 1.@@ 20 meters height and 90 cm height .
it would also be a good way of combating illegal immigration towards the united states .
two of the susp@@ ects were arrested in connection with the ko@@ ka@@ in-@@ fund .
the third , a mex@@ ic@@ an , was arrested for se@@ izing the country .
all three are threatened with being sent@@ enced to life imprison@@ ment for a life@@ time , as officials have said .
since 2006 , eight such tun@@ nels have been discovered , the one being on the press conference in san di@@ e@@ go .
it should be the first time , however , that in such a tunnel , co@@ ca@@ ine has been found .
usually ko@@ k@@ ain is produced in smaller quantities , not by tun@@ nels .
this is shown in the &quot; des@@ pair &quot; of the drug gan@@ gs whose traditional routes have now been cut off , said bill sm@@ er@@ man of the drug fac@@ tion .
they would do everything they can to enter the us .
the findings include the arrest warrant , which is not the case , at least one of mexico &apos;s leaders .
you must be satisfied with prison sent@@ ences of up to ten years .
20@@ 14 , g@@ is@@ sing@@ er fe@@ st@@ year will be held on the fe@@ st@@ year of the fe@@ st@@ year of the fe@@ st@@ year of the year 20@@ 14 , ge@@ is@@ inger fe@@ st@@ year .
the anniversary of the european union &apos;s ge@@ is@@ ingen anniversary on the occasion of the 12@@ 50 .
returning to the first documents of the town of s@@ anti@@ ago de compos@@ te@@ la .
if in just over eight weeks the year ends , the european ju@@ bil@@ ee year will be over .
ge@@ is@@ sing and church music : the first of these was the first docum@@ entary together .
in churches , a document was produced which describes the two places .
on 15 march , there will be an official launch of the anniversary of the fall of the berlin wall , and since ho@@ stage is not currently in a hall , this opening event will take place in the place where 12@@ 50 years ago both were mentioned for the first time in church .
in the context of the anniversary , several events have been held in ge@@ is@@ ingen and in the kir@@ chen@@ -@@ haus@@ en .
church leaders are not only the first to attend a fe@@ ast weekend from 18th to 20th july , but also the 12@@ 50 .
returning to celebr@@ ation .
on friday , with a fe@@ ast , on saturday and sunday with a festival around the church church hall , the festival is held .
at this weekend of fe@@ ast is also the church house festival , which is held in the city of st. g@@ allen .
city music director ru@@ dol@@ f bar@@ th has written a book for the city on the occasion of the anniversary .
on 21 june , together with the son@@ n@@ w@@ end@@ fe@@ i@@ er des sch@@ war@@ z@@ wal@@ d@@ vere@@ in , on 12 july in the arena with fire@@ works and on 13 december the first concert of city music in the new fe@@ st@@ hall .
this is done in the ju@@ bil@@ ee year and it is in@@ aug@@ ur@@ ated , the official date is last september , on 27 and 27 .
on the occasion of the ge@@ is@@ inger stad@@ t@@ ju@@ bil@@ ee , a new chron@@ ic@@ le will be released .
&quot; it should be a chron@@ ic@@ le not only of spiritual and spiritual self , but a thought of the work of the spiritual interest .
and that is the spirit of today &apos;s day , too , that celebra@@ tes 20@@ 14 &apos;s birth@@ day , and in 197@@ 4 the present space was completed with the comm@@ on@@ places .
the new chron@@ ic@@ le will be released on 21 or 22 november in the new fe@@ st@@ hal@@ le in ge@@ is@@ ingen .
20@@ 14 , however , is also a year with many ju@@ bil@@ ee .
the nar@@ ren@@ z@@ un@@ ft stra@@ h@@ gl@@ on@@ ki starts on february 8 with a bre@@ w@@ ery evening on their 6@@ 0-@@ year anniversary , which harmon@@ ises gu@@ t@@ mat@@ ingen 90 years and has been celebrated on march 29 .
the al@@ ten@@ wer@@ k le@@ i@@ p@@ fer@@ d@@ ingen is going to be 40 years old , the ge@@ is@@ inger school has been located in the new location for 50 years and celebra@@ tes it on 10 may , the musi@@ k@@ vere@@ in 150 years old .
the city of ge@@ is@@ ingen was built in a gift certificate , which was in pos@@ session of the st. g@@ allen monaster@@ y , in 7@@ 64 .
the document was written in churches ( haus@@ en ) .
both communities are therefore able to participate in the same document .
reason 20@@ 14 this 12@@ 50 year old is due to celebrate , in addition to the municip@@ al reform is still 40 years behind .
the council is taking railways into consideration .
should the railway pass be &quot; on the brain &quot; more elabor@@ ate ?
yes , have the local counc@@ ils decided .
sch@@ il@@ t@@ ach must have 2@@ 20 000 euros in his hands for this .
the german railway wants to make the cinema season a success next year .
the most important thing is to ensure safety on railway cros@@ s@@ ings - regular trains run across germany .
do the communities agree to the renov@@ ation measures , they must deal with one third of the costs they inc@@ ur , the rest share with the public .
sch@@ il@@ t@@ zer stad@@ t@@ bau@@ me@@ ister ro@@ land gri@@ e@@ ß@@ hab@@ er explained the special features of the ba@@ h@@ sch@@ ü@@ tte to the municip@@ ality .
there , the city plans to build a new building in the height of the tun@@ nel@@ mun@@ d on the west of the railway track .
there , greater vehicles could also be used , for example , those trans@@ porting long-@@ tim@@ ber , in the event of an accident , without having to block the tracks .
gre@@ e@@ k-@@ hab@@ er therefore proposed to create a necessary support wall in such a way that the city could not continue to cross the street in due course .
this was done in the municip@@ al council in a controversial way , as some advis@@ ers suggested the need for road distribution : thomas ki@@ p@@ p brought a message of public s@@ enti@@ ment to the point : &apos; do we have to wait so much for so few vehicles ?
may@@ or thomas ha@@ as opposed : the railway pass &quot; h@@ ir@@ sch@@ en &quot; will be regularly used for long-@@ tim@@ bered trans@@ ports .
even wood from the area &quot; co@@ w bach &quot; is partly covered by this route , because the wood is used for the production of the track up to 20 metres long .
in addition , the route serves as a re@@ rou@@ ting for those vehicles that use the tunnel .
as we can see that kir@@ ch@@ berg and bre@@ w@@ ery farms will be closed , we will have to wait until the next elections in the future , as is the case in wol@@ f@@ gan@@ g .
the counc@@ ils agreed to investigate whether the eu &apos;s costs would be covered by the intended spread of the road .
despite this , the reconstruction of the railway crossing has been largely approved .
the conversion of the railway crossing to the ger@@ ber@@ i@@ um tr@@ aut@@ we@@ in could , on the other hand , be a quite different problem , which could make it difficult to access the heavily increasing &quot; ger@@ ol@@ tz@@ h@@ ä@@ user we@@ g &quot; .
the administration had decided to re@@ build the railway from the engineering office brun@@ in@@ ling@@ er .
the investigation concluded that the commission had not been excluded .
the responsibility for this lies with the city as a road ha@@ ul@@ age carrier .
the conversion could therefore be made subject to liability disputes .
as both the wood removal and the wood removal process are carried out in the current state of development , the best way to avoid the re@@ building of the railway crossing is to argue that ha@@ as .
it is also worth no@@ ting here the risk of a col@@ li@@ sion of the train with a vehicle on the transition that is significantly lower than the other railway cros@@ s@@ ings , because the stop is right next to the center , to which a good connection exists .
even trains from the central station would have to be stopped at this point as far as they did not have a col@@ li@@ sion .
the majority of the committee voted in favour of the conversion of this railway crossing , as the city of sch@@ il@@ t@@ ach is facing the problem of over@@ crow@@ ded vehicles .
as an un@@ proble@@ matic , the board considers the conversion to the railway cros@@ s@@ ings &quot; before heu@@ bach &quot; and &quot; before ku@@ h@@ bach &quot; , for which already cros@@ s@@ ings with the railway were made .

or would you prefer to discover the origin of the co@@ smo@@ s ?
or after earth@@ like plan@@ ets , and with it perhaps extra@@ -@@ ter@@ re@@ stri@@ al life ?
these questions are particularly important to those responsible for the european space agency es@@ a .
for your programme &quot; cos@@ mi@@ c vision &quot; we are looking for ideas for two big space projects that will support research deci@@ sively .
the budget for such &apos; l-@@ missions &apos; is eur 1 billion each .
the start will be scheduled for 20@@ 28 and 20@@ 34 .
at the beginning of september , the elite of the european world space research , met in paris to make proposals for such missions .
30 ideas were on the table , five of them have now been put into a closer election .
many bodies have examined the commission &apos;s proposals , but do not over@@ look the fact that researchers are not involved .
in the next few days , a final decision will be taken by the scientific programme committee .
a total of four major questions have been selected by es@@ a , to which the missions of the 2007 initiative co@@ sm@@ ic vision will respond .
what are the conditions for the creation of plan@@ ets and life ?
the exact dates of the installation and the date of the birth of stars from large gas cl@@ ou@@ ds - and thus also the emerg@@ ence of plan@@ ets around these stars - are still in the pro@@ ver@@ bi@@ al dar@@ k@@ ness .
a large infra@@ red network of about 2@@ ,000 m ² could be the dar@@ k@@ est .
and if a star planet has the conditions under which it can grow there ?
in order to answer this question , 20@@ 17 is to be the space tel@@ es@@ cope &quot; che@@ ops &quot; , which will be used to supply 500 already known plan@@ etary systems in our immediate vicinity .
the possibilities are limited , however , che@@ ops is a small mission with a budget of 150 million euros .
with larger instruments , the a@@ stronom@@ ers could produce earth like plan@@ ets and even determine the composition of their atmo@@ sp@@ he@@ res , thus looking for &quot; bi@@ om@@ ar@@ kers &quot; : g@@ ases that are considered an indic@@ ator of biological activity .
how does the solar system work ?
this is another issue that should ultimately provide information on the conditions for the creation of new life .
an important role is the magnetic field of a star .
in our solar system , these processes can be explo@@ ited in an ex@@ em@@ pl@@ ary manner .
with the &quot; solar orange &quot; you can see the es@@ a already a mission of the m-@@ class ( there the bud@@ get is about one half ) .
the pro@@ be is to start in 20@@ 17 and will begin the surface and activity of the sun closely .
it is of great interest to researchers that je@@ pi@@ ter and his mon@@ de are also present .
they want to find out what the role of the giant planet in the development of solar system is .
this is what es@@ a sees as the first of three l missions of the &quot; co@@ sm@@ ic vision &quot; programme .
the pro@@ be &quot; ju@@ ice &quot; ( j@@ up@@ i@@ ter ic@@ y mo@@ ons explorer ) is now starting your journey .
eight years later , ju@@ pi@@ ter reach@@ es the atmosphere of the planet and the ic@@ y moon .
what are the basic physical and mental laws of the universe ?
the world all offers many possibilities to make material under extreme conditions .
perhaps the other parties will also find themselves in a situation where physi@@ ci@@ sts have found a way to a new theory , under which all known natural laws can be united .
how is the universe created and what is the universe ?
the city was founded in 13@@ .@@ 7 billion years ago by the great k@@ n@@ all .
in addition to the information we are familiar with , from the stars , plan@@ ets and living beings as we are , there are dark and dark matter , whose gra@@ vity was gal@@ ax@@ ies and gal@@ ax@@ ies .
so far , researchers do not know what physical or chemical laws are in the first second half of the year , nor do they know what the limits are .
with &quot; eu@@ cli@@ d &quot; the es@@ a has also already played a m-@@ mission here .
with a special tel@@ es@@ cope , the sony a@@ 700 is to determine the distribution of the matter in the universe for the first time , and thus to draw conclusions about the nature of dark matter .
anyone who wants to go to the race could go to the race .
of the 30 proposals , at the end of the selection procedure , only two remain .
the best chan@@ ces of obtaining a grant as an l mission are in the opinion of many experts &quot; e-@@ lis@@ a &quot; , a sophisticated concept for demonstr@@ ating gra@@ vit@@ ational waves .
we are talking about physi@@ ci@@ sts who change the structure of space time , which al@@ bert e@@ inste@@ in predic@@ ted almost 100 years ago .
proven that they were not used to date .
el@@ is@@ a could create , hope the scientists behind the project .
the mission provides for a two-@@ way or three pro@@ be to detec@@ t the presence of a single rad@@ ar in space .
it could , in contrast to installations on earth , also be gra@@ vit@@ ational waves .
four other proposals compete with the other .
already excluded areas are not covered by proposals for the sample content of the re@@ trac@@ table mar@@ s , for research into moon , ven@@ us and a@@ ster@@ o@@ ids .
snow@@ den ready to go with germany in terms of us surveillance “ co@@ operating ” .
ed@@ ward snow@@ den , who is wh@@ ist@@ le@@ b@@ lower of the us intelligence service , has stated that he is prepared to go to berlin and , before the german bun@@ de@@ sta@@ g , to make an impact on the american national security agency and its headquarters .
the german member , han@@ s-@@ christian str@@ ö@@ be@@ le , met snow@@ den on thursday in russia , where he was granted asylum .
in a letter from snow@@ den , the president of the european commission , mr s@@ ö@@ der@@ man , presented to str@@ ö@@ be@@ le on friday , he wri@@ tes : “ although the result of my efforts was demonstr@@ ably positive , my government continues to treat a dis@@ sent opinion as a dis@@ s@@ enti@@ ment .
the truth is that the truth is not a crime .
the letter from the european commission says that the british government is convinced that the eu &apos;s support for the peace process will convince the american government to accept the charge against him .
the us judicial system ’ s claim to be a criminal off@@ ence includes sp@@ ying and the@@ ft of state@@ -@@ owned property .
the german interior minister , han@@ s-@@ peter fried@@ rich , said online : “ if mr s@@ no@@ w@@ den is prepared to work with german representatives , then you will find ways to do that . ”
relations between the us and germany are characterised by the claims that the us and germany are not in a position to control chancell@@ or ang@@ ela mer@@ kel ’ s mobile phone .
thomas op@@ per@@ mann , the member who has presented the draft resolution on the secret service , said that the commission should not miss the opportunity to bring snow@@ den as a witness .
curren@@ ts , a member of the greens , published a picture of itself and snow@@ den .
he was arrested on his visit to russia by two german journalists .
curren@@ ts explained that the debian project &apos;s law@@ yer , former n@@ sa , said that snow@@ den was not looking for russia .
if snow@@ den is in germany to say , then he needs a guarantee that he will be there “ safe ” , so the member .
snow@@ den explains in his letter that he is not aware of a “ serious and ongoing crisis . ”
he was touched , however , by the global response to “ my act of political expression . ”
citizens around the world , as well as high-@@ level politicians – including in the united states – have not yet heard the rev@@ el@@ ations about an un@@ controlled system of comprehensive surveillance as a mer@@ it of the general public .
in his letter , s@@ no@@ w@@ den makes the german authorities aware of an offer of cooperation , “ if the difficulties surrounding the humanitarian situation have been resolved ” .
fronti@@ er airlines collec@@ ts fees for mobile hand bag@@ gage and other items of bag@@ gage .
fronti@@ er airlines plans to launch a new generation of aircraft to cover up to usd 100 , which will be delivered on your flight .
fronti@@ er airlines intends to continue to operate up to usd 100 for a piece of hand bag@@ gage and 2 dollars for coffee or lim@@ on@@ ade , even if the airline announced that it would not accept this on wednesday .
the new fee applies to hand bag@@ gage in the bag@@ gage com@@ part@@ ment above the seat , small bags under the seat are still free of charge .
fronti@@ er explained that it is possible to calcul@@ ate $ 25 when the fee is paid in advance , and $ 100 for travellers who have only been on the flight path .
fron@@ ti@@ er spo@@ kes@@ man k@@ ate o &apos;@@ mal@@ ley said that the fee of usd 100 goals is to reduce travellers who are not in the van@@ guard of the payment .
“ we want to not calcul@@ ate this amount , ” she explained .
airlines began to operate in 2008 with a budget of eur 1 billion for the first and second checked bag@@ gage .
passengers travelling by car or by car should be aware that the cost of the ticket is as high as possible .
fees are one way to get passengers to pay for less with the aircraft .
o &apos;@@ mal@@ ley said that in the new fee i am not really concerned with making money , but with making money .
it is about the loy@@ alty of our customers , the loy@@ al customer , who should have made it clear that it is becoming increasingly difficult to find space in the com@@ part@@ ment above the seat .
passengers travelling by car can use the website of the airline .
this means that a passenger must be present at the boarding gate of fronti@@ er , and that the passenger may be able to take a piece of luggage , but the next person may pay usd 100 for a comparable piece of luggage .
o &apos;@@ mal@@ ley explained that the site of fron@@ ti@@ er and the check-in in procedures would be changed so that passengers could have access to the fee paid before they were sent to the boarding gate .
the new hand bag@@ gage fee of fronti@@ er will only be effective in the summer , a precise date is not yet available .
passengers were sh@@ ou@@ ting frequently about bag@@ gage allow@@ ances and other charges , but airlines are happy to resort to them .
they argue that the us dollar ’ s transport of luggage is co@@ sting money and passengers can pay for it when they buy it .
many people in wall street regard the new bag@@ gage charges as a sign that the airlines are spending enough money to keep up with the new rules after years of losses .
most of them , however , have so far been poin@@ ting fing@@ ers at handling bag@@ gage charges .
spirit air@@ lines inc@@ . is calling for a new , more efficient and more efficient handling of hand bag@@ gage , three years ago .
the only other airline with a such airline fee is the hungarian air carrier wi@@ z@@ z air , declared airbus to be the first airline to offer the same service to the hungarian airlines , j@@ ay so@@ ren@@ sen .
it estimated in a report of december 2011 that the eu &apos;s hand bag@@ gage fee spirit would cost usd 50 million a year .
so@@ ren@@ sen , who used to be a leader in the mid@@ west airlines business , has been the first to be awarded with spirit .
“ the boar@@ ding process was one of the leading fr@@ ic@@ tion@@ less , the most smooth i have ever seen in my career in aviation ” , said he .
i expected that the commission would be able to take the necessary measures and hold tr@@ ick@@ y discussions at the airport .
“ the aircraft was full , ” he explained , “ and the boarding song ran like a lu@@ br@@ ic@@ ated one . ”
fronti@@ er follows spirit also on the 2 dollar , which is used for coffee , tea , lim@@ on@@ ade or ju@@ ice .
the company explained that passengers with a valid li@@ mon@@ ade or sa@@ ft purchased a ticket to the whole of the do@@ se and that coffee could be re@@ plen@@ ished for free .
water is also free .
us air@@ ways had a short@@ age of time in 2008 to try to provide refres@@ h@@ ment drinks , making it seven months later .
fron@@ ti@@ ers ’ move to charge mobile hand bag@@ gage charges is a step forward if passengers are not directly involved in the airline ’ s purchase .
airlines are paying online travel agencies like or@@ bit@@ z 10 to 25 us dollars per ticket sold .
this provides all societies with an incentive to provide passengers with direct access to their purch@@ ases , rather than through an online travel agency .
fronti@@ er is the leading player in this field , however .
in september , the company started to make a booking through an online travel agency only half as many frequent fl@@ yer miles as the airline had booked .
on wednesday , the first two miles were re@@ credited to 25 percent of the flight .
a one-@@ third of the supplier ’ s flight ticket is valid for a third flight with a front over 1000 miles .
passengers can also only take part in direct purchase on the fron@@ ti@@ er platz website .
fronti@@ er has a sta@@ un@@ ch customer base and is a member of the international network of sales offices in den@@ ver .
the proce@@ eds went to 9 % , and the airlines ’ capacity dec@@ lined by just under 13 % in the first quarter , as in the financial report .
republic has tried to make a significant contribution to the sale of the company &apos;s finances by fron@@ ti@@ er .
pro@@ ver@@ bi@@ al words come from the bi@@ ble .
about 40 women visited the last women &apos;s breakfast this year in the go@@ spe@@ l church community of bis@@ ingen .
the theme of the day in the municip@@ al house were &quot; pro@@ ver@@ bs from the bi@@ ble &quot; and &quot; words from the middle ages &quot; .

the phrase &apos; no &apos; from the middle ages took the church community method into account .

learning instead of being unemployed : pilot project for un@@ skilled workers in tourism .
at the mec@@ k@@ len@@ bur@@ g@@ is@@ che see@@ plat@@ te star@@ te@@ the@@ tte a pilot project for the tourism industry .
under the leadership of the federal employment agency , 49 women and men who have already been trained as un@@ skilled in the industry are to be taken over to skilled workers for hotels and restaurants over three winter .
&quot; new to this is that the six@@ -@@ month period of courses with degrees in the field &quot; , car@@ men wi@@ ec@@ her@@ t said from the employment agency neu@@ brand@@ enburg .
the benefit is mani@@ fold : participants would thus not be unemployed , the companies would not get caught up in the labour market , and the companies would become more and more dependent on the quality of their services .
the project has also been attended by the industrial and commercial cham@@ bers in neu@@ brand@@ enburg and the german hotel and restaurant association .
n@@ sa explains a “ inter@@ n error ” and not h@@ ack@@ ers are to blame for the cr@@ ash of the site &apos;s cr@@ ash .
the sh@@ ad@@ ow@@ y national security agency stated on the late friday that a bug had been caused your public website a few hours and not h@@ ack@@ ers , as online was claimed .
“ n@@ sa@@ .@@ go@@ v was here ton@@ ight for a few hours because during a planned visit to the internet a internal error occurred . ” , explains christian ros@@ ner .
the problem will be resolved this evening .
the claim that the out@@ break was caused by a distributed system of den@@ ial of service was not proven .
in the early evening hours , online server games were very popular .
previously , a spo@@ kes@@ man for the n@@ sa had declared to ab@@ c news that the sensitive internal network of the authority was “ in no way com@@ promised . ”
secret information is not included in the risk , so the speaker is in danger .
at least one group of h@@ ack@@ ti@@ vi@@ sts took up the challenge of using the n@@ sa website with a d@@ dos attack .
in such attacks , the commission &apos;s target website is being called with page calls , until the servers are over@@ loaded .
the cy@@ ber@@ tac@@ tic is relatively simple , and the attacks serve not to protect the lives of the internet &apos;s internal network , but to prevent the attacks .
the former super@@ -@@ secret n@@ sa , whose n@@ ick@@ name was once no search agency ( no such authority ) , was the only one to find itself in the bright light of the public and looks like the last few months .
the growing contro@@ vers@@ y surrounding the secret service has also fu@@ el@@ ed initial spec@@ ulation about the intergovernmental conference ’ s failure to act today as a result of a deliber@@ ate cy@@ per@@ -@@ operation .

one reason for this is the lack of a proper legal basis in the field bau@@ er : &quot; we have few skilled workers in the cra@@ fts , health care and care of the elderly &quot; .

win losses are not a problem for bom@@ bar@@ di@@ er after dec@@ lining supply figures and orders .
the can@@ a@@ dian aircraft and aircraft carrier , bom@@ bar@@ di@@ er inc , is reporting on thursday a 15@@ -@@ percent increase in the volume of the net profit generated by the company ’ s dec@@ lining orders and deli@@ veries .
bom@@ bar@@ di@@ er , based in mon@@ tre@@ al , also published no flight test data for his brand new aircraft of the c@@ series and gave the c@@ series no new information about whether the aircraft was being operated in accordance with the ambitious schedule for next september .
on the ma@@ ide@@ n flight of the test aircraft a year and a half ago , only three more laun@@ ches have been carried out , which leaves no doubt as to whether the test phase is proce@@ eding as planned .
the results were not so great .
camer@@ on do@@ er@@ k@@ sen , analy@@ st at national bank finance &amp; investment , reduced the value of his assessment of “ out@@ per@@ form ” to “ sector per@@ form ” in view of how the bank ’ s shares were to be divided in the next quarter one to two .
“ although weak@@ er economies were hit by the down@@ turn in aircraft delivery , the us economy was hit by the margin@@ s in transport . ”
we believe that the european union should not allow bom@@ bar@@ di@@ er to place new orders for the c@@ series if the test program for the aircraft is progres@@ sing .
if , however , there is no new orders to be placed in the coming months , we expect the market to be more s@@ cep@@ tical about the programme .
bom@@ bar@@ di@@ er hopes that the us air force will be able to stop the company from flying in the lower market segment of kat@@ ap@@ ul@@ ti@@ fying the aircraft currently being used by bo@@ eing and airbus .
the first test aircraft was delivered in march to the public and fle@@ w to the us after months of delays .
but , to date , binding orders have been made for the c@@ series with 17@@ 7 moder@@ ates , as potential bu@@ yers are waiting for the results of the flight tests and want to see if the company &apos;s claims regarding fuel efficiency and cost savings of the new no@@ zz@@ le are true .
there are currently 4@@ 03 orders and commitments from 15 customers and companies .
the chairman of the executive board , pi@@ er@@ re beau@@ do@@ in , is confident that bom@@ bar@@ di@@ er will achieve its goal of 300 binding orders at the beginning of commercial use of the jet .
the management assured the company that on thursday , analy@@ sts and media would also like to see the programme in the schedule .
“ the test aircraft is no longer on the ground than expected , ” said beau@@ do@@ in at a telephone conference and added that the aircraft will be operated during the flight ’ s life@@ time .
each manufacturer plans to do something different .
we have decided to take a first flight and then to take a revision period .
this is happening throughout the programme .
the second of five test aircraft will be scheduled to be delivered in the next few weeks , the remaining ones will be named after the company .
however , analy@@ sts remain ske@@ p@@ tical about whether 12 months after ma@@ ide@@ n flight , the first customer to fly a cr@@ ane .
bom@@ bar@@ di@@ er explained that it checks the planning for the in@@ aug@@ ur@@ ation ( ice ) and will update it in the coming months .
“ the slow progress of the negotiations on the air test – even though it appears to be bom@@ bar@@ di@@ er ’ s internal planning – rein@@ forces our view that the commission@@ ing will be limited to the first quarter of 20@@ 15 ” , said do@@ er@@ k@@ sen .
in the third quarter , at the end of september 30 , bom@@ bar@@ di@@ ers ’ net profit fell to $ 14@@ 7 million , or $ 8 per share , from $ 17@@ 2 million or $ 9 c@@ ents per share in the year before .
the custom@@ ized profit per share is € 2@@ 5.@@ 00 , which is un@@ changed .
sales increased slightly , but the company continued to decline from € 4.@@ 2 billion to € 4.@@ 1 billion .
analy@@ sts had a profit of 10 c@@ ents per share and a tur@@ nover of 4.@@ 54 c@@ ents per share expected , so th@@ om@@ son re@@ u@@ ters i / b / e / s .
the world ’ s fourth largest aircraft manufacturer , says that it has already invested € 45 million in this quarter , a drop of 57 in the last year .
the net orders were placed from 8@@ 3 aircraft to 6@@ ,@@ 8@@ 3 aircraft .
order in@@ take in the aero@@ space industry was up by € 1.@@ 2 billion on 30 september .
“ in the field of aero@@ space , the results were in the context of our guidelines , but the low in@@ coming orders and market conditions as a whole were dis@@ appoin@@ ting , ” said beau@@ do@@ in .
sales in the aero@@ space industry increased by € 1.@@ 8 billion to € 1.@@ 8 billion .
bom@@ bar@@ di@@ er , the world ’ s largest railway manufacturer , announced that sales in this segment were up by almost 11 % to € 2.@@ 1 billion .
order in@@ take in the transport division was € 30 million on 30 september , compared with € 3@@ 2.@@ 6 billion on 31 december .
the winning amount in the transport sector has been increased by handling problems with some major contracts .
according to the management , it will be the fourth quarter that will introduce new guidelines .
in the afternoon trading at thursday there was the bom@@ bar@@ di@@ er share by 8@@ ,@@ 5 percent and in the first quarter was 4.@@ 8@@ 3 can@@ a@@ dian dollars , after also announced that the good@@ will plan was to be pat@@ ric@@ k pic@@ he@@ tte .
the braz@@ ili@@ an embr@@ ac@@ er sa , the world ’ s third largest commercial aircraft manufacturer and bom@@ bar@@ di@@ er of the very close ri@@ vals , reported on thursday a t@@ enth percent drop in the quarter ear@@ nings .
usa : sho@@ ts at the airport of los angel@@ es
an unknown man has left on friday morning , ( or@@ ts@@ ze@@ it ) at la@@ x sch@@ üs@@ se .
while the airport management has been informed about the short message service t@@ wit@@ ter , the commission &apos;s cont@@ en@@ tion is that the airport is in cust@@ o@@ dy , the los angel@@ es times reported that the man is dead .
a safety man is also killed .
media reported that the debian project has been in@@ ju@@ red several times .
us president bar@@ ack obama will keep on talking about the situation , said the spo@@ kes@@ man of the white house , j@@ ay car@@ ney .
the incident occurred in the united states terminal 3 , which gave evidence that a sho@@ o@@ ter was att@@ acking a gun in one of the departure h@@ alls .
a travell@@ er told me that he was going to be a member of the european parliament and that many people would have been in pan@@ ic .
travellers would have cri@@ tici@@ zed and inf@@ ected children .
among the waiting is pes@@ si@@ mis@@ m , but the many would have been afraid to stand behind the chairs .
he has two sho@@ ts , says a ri@@ der of &quot; los angel@@ es ti@@ mes &quot; .
an employee of the security authority t@@ sa has a shot at the foot .
the scene is &quot; as in a movie &quot; .
it was then in a security area itself .
the sho@@ ts are supposed to be near a security chec@@ k@@ point .
airport shuttle buildings ev@@ ac@@ u@@ ate the aircraft and the aircraft are ev@@ ac@@ u@@ ated .
on television pictures was to see how many hospit@@ als and police cars were being built in front of a terminal .
hundreds of people have been exp@@ elled from the building in safety .
users on t@@ wit@@ ter published photos of a special command line and a t@@ wit@@ ter ground .
as the airport management said on t@@ wit@@ ter , the first step in the process began at 9.@@ 30 a.m. ( or@@ ts@@ ze@@ it ) .
the access route to the hotel was bloc@@ ked , which , according to the c@@ n@@ n , allowed long back@@ wards traffic .
except for land , the airport is tempor@@ arily suspended .
however , on c@@ n@@ n several f@@ lies were also on the start .
terminal 3 is mainly used by small and medium-sized us airlines .

co@@ ca@@ ine ad@@ dic@@ ted law@@ yer , drug bo@@ ss before police investigation , who was not able to get into prison .
bas@@ har@@ at d@@ it@@ ta , 42 , gave information to under@@ world size ne@@ il scar@@ bor@@ ough , and published it on the internet .
the law@@ yer had been afraid to leave his secret drug ad@@ diction to light .
he was arrested by the li@@ ver@@ pool cro@@ wn court and sent@@ enced to three years in prison .
a well-known criminal def@@ en@@ der who has been using a drug bar@@ on before a great police investigation has been arrested because he was afraid to close his secret drug ad@@ diction .
bas@@ har@@ at d@@ it@@ ta , 42 , provided entertainment to the under@@ world , ne@@ il scar@@ bor@@ ough with sensitive information about er@@ it@@ re@@ an &apos;s activities in the drug trade after he was arrested by his own co@@ ca@@ ine .
the crime rate is the most important factor in the fight against terrorism , which is regarded as ‘ first-@@ class ’ by crimin@@ als .
officials wat@@ ched the world ’ s scar@@ bor@@ ough , the world ’ s three be@@ ets of co@@ ca@@ ine , and saw the light of day at the house of the law@@ yer black@@ bur@@ n , lan@@ cas@@ hire .
the investigation into the situation revealed that the th@@ il@@ o had been regularly subjec@@ ted to drugs of class a , after tests had detec@@ ted signs of co@@ ca@@ ine in his hair , on his wal@@ let and on credit cards .
the company has been operating in the us for eight months from january to august 2011 , and has been trying to dis@@ close information about the arrest of two men on behalf of scar@@ bor@@ ough and one of its partners .
all four susp@@ ects were then convic@@ ted by the police in a large investigation report .
together with 32 other people , they were arrested later after the police had been arrested in a number of house sear@@ ches .
d@@ it@@ ta , 42 , gave information to the criminal more , because he fe@@ ared that he would use his drug ad@@ diction to become public .
today , d@@ it@@ ta , who is responsible for the law firm for@@ bes sol@@ ic@@ itors in black@@ bur@@ n , was elected li@@ ver@@ pool ’ s cro@@ wn court after a three-@@ week visit to the united states .
he gave a speech at an earlier survey to the co@@ ca@@ ine .
the law@@ yer was over@@ taken , after the police had been arrested in their investigation of scar@@ bor@@ ough .
two investig@@ ating officials have followed the same suit , and the susp@@ ect saw that he was being d@@ it@@ t@@ as house and there the drugs were being treated with a pur@@ ity of 60 % in a black golf glo@@ be@@ -@@ box .
shortly after he had dro@@ pped off the drugs , he had tele@@ ph@@ oned scar@@ bor@@ ough regularly with d@@ it@@ ta , who was at dinner at the football sta@@ dium of the black@@ bur@@ n ro@@ vers in e@@ wood park .
the law@@ yer returned to the home , and he took the time to get rid of drugs and then nine communications were sent between the two .
in court , it was known that d@@ it@@ ta was a “ regular consumer ” of ko@@ k@@ ain .
d@@ it@@ ta was later arrested , st@@ oned and was sent@@ enced to death .
during his arrest , di@@ tt@@ a took his letters to the police and tried to get a number of credit cards .
in police infringement proceedings , there was a case where he said that he was operating under his private address as well as at the work@@ place and that he would be held in the office for legal matters at home .
in court , it was known that he was a key player in the drug trade , some of whom he had previously represented , after significant ar@@ re@@ sts and had informed what the investigation had done about them .
prosecu@@ tor an@@ ne w@@ hy@@ te said : “ a criminal law att@@ or@@ ney should be better than any other person knows that one can not break the law . ”
d@@ it@@ ta will be ab@@ used of his position as a criminal def@@ en@@ der , as he will become too much concerned with certain clients .
the directive in question is not simply that of a drug deal@@ er , but of a drug deal@@ er who has to pay his law@@ yer with drugs .
part of his communications were undoubtedly legitimate , but the report was the first to be adopted by the prosecu@@ tor .
but that went far beyond the limits of a normal relationship between law@@ yer and client .
he was a member of the police investigation as far as possible , so that he could continue to be able to follow up on criminal activities .
mr d@@ it@@ ta has thus expressed his profes@@ sion in dis@@ repu@@ te .
he was in charge of certain clients too much , especially scar@@ bor@@ ough , and he left it to be the most important com@@ promises .
d@@ it@@ ta pointed out every mal@@ practice , and claimed that the “ if i had a corru@@ pt law@@ yer , i would be a corru@@ pt law@@ yer , and information to scar@@ bor@@ ough would be passed on to me . ”
but , after hearing , super@@ int@@ end@@ ent le@@ e hal@@ ste@@ ad said that the police in lan@@ cas@@ hire were “ mr di@@ tt@@ a has the move from a criminal def@@ en@@ der to a criminal in the moment . ”
his co@@ ca@@ ine ad@@ diction led to a ho@@ p@@ eless com@@ promising and made him sus@@ cep@@ tible to mo@@ tives of leading members of the organised crime that had entr@@ usted him with valuable information on police investigation .
lawyers and jud@@ ges must meet the highest standards of integrity and be able to stand up for trust and confidence in the public .

on saturday , 26 october , the conference will take place from 19 : 00 at the evening fair in st. mar@@ tin@@ in@@ sk@@ ir@@ che dun@@ n@@ ingen and on sunday , 26 october at the exhibition centre .
the so-called german trade fair with the original title &quot; sing@@ ing for the celebr@@ ation of the holy opera &quot; is the most important event in germany .
the fair will take place in the context of the services of god , as the client jo@@ han@@ n phili@@ p@@ p neu@@ mann had intended .
under the leadership of her@@ mann sch@@ nei@@ der , the cho@@ ir is directed by the br@@ ass band of the musi@@ k@@ vere@@ in fe@@ h@@ sin@@ n ten@@ n@@ en@@ br@@ on@@ n and no@@ em@@ i lo@@ ko@@ di at the or@@ gan .
has@@ l@@ ach : ske@@ p@@ tic@@ ism is increasingly di@@ stan@@ cing itself from confidence .
the elections to the par@@ ish council of the municip@@ ality in 20@@ 15 will , for example , be a major event in has@@ l@@ ach ( se ) .
there is only one other common post office , and that is the council of the six par@@ ish counc@@ ils .
in a joint meeting , the heads of state and government met on saturday to discuss the situation in the region of has@@ l@@ ach , ho@@ f@@ ste@@ t@@ ten , m@@ ü@@ len@@ bach , fis@@ cher@@ bach , ste@@ in@@ ach and wel@@ sch@@ en@@ ste@@ in@@ ach .
for at least one of the fundamental decisions of the di@@ oc@@ ese is to be changed and it is time to ask the par@@ ish counc@@ ils to take them as satisfac@@ tor@@ ily as possible .
over the day , a great deal of attention was paid to the fact that ske@@ p@@ tic@@ ism towards the new is slowly but stead@@ ily di@@ min@@ ishing .
of the ideas and expectations of the innovations 20@@ 15 to 20@@ 15 , to concrete proposals on the future composition and size of the par@@ ish council , the council was sufficient to make the very constructive discussions of the six bodies with the main actors of the se@@ af@@ are@@ n .
regional de@@ k@@ an geor@@ g sch@@ mit@@ t explained the benefits of the new regional policy by presenting a presentation .
then the se h@@ as@@ lan as a church community will form a body of public law , which will be included in the rights and duties of the six church communities so far .
it will only be a common par@@ ish council , and a common public prosecu@@ tor will be appointed , in which the par@@ ish pri@@ est will be represented .
from every par@@ ish , the par@@ ish is supposed to represent at least two elected members , in the six par@@ ish counc@@ ils , so-called municip@@ al teams are formed .
their task will be to ensure that the church system is in place in the future .
in the question of finance for the individual par@@ ish community , the question then ar@@ ose of a great deal of discussion .
the innovations are intended to make it possible to use the accum@@ ulated cred@@ its in the par@@ ish buildings in a targeted manner .
the li@@ abilities are based on the total community , however .
in particular , with regard to the major investments planned , the commitment of which will then be made by all the par@@ ish pri@@ ests , there were major concerns .
&quot; even in the past , only projects were invested in which the people of the par@@ ish had to work alone .
practical experience with a joint body for five p@@ far@@ r@@ is signs and a common body described bar@@ bar@@ ic k@@ nights , the chairman of the se@@ af@@ aring unit of de@@ br@@ is forest neu@@ ried .
they had been calling for the european union to become one , five to stay , and they had to realise that this was not so easy .
the bodies of the has@@ l@@ ach@@ er se@@ al@@ sor@@ ge@@ unity then made a mistake in raising questions about the future composition and size of the common par@@ ish council and the practical work of community teams .
the commission &apos;s proposals will be discussed in more detail in subsequent meetings and will be discussed in another joint meeting of all six bodies next spring .
at the end , par@@ ish counc@@ ill@@ or michael sch@@ ö@@ ner presented the first project of the par@@ ish church of st. ste@@ in@@ ach , which was approved by a clear majority .
in p@@ f@@ ul@@ l@@ endor@@ f , electricity is becoming more expensive and the cost of energy is increasing .
the citizens are pl@@ uc@@ king up the streets and are forced to pay higher electricity costs .
as the managing director of the city ’ s works , j@@ ör@@ g-@@ ar@@ ne bi@@ as , said in relation to the south cou@@ ri@@ er , a four-@@ person group of pl@@ um@@ bers is coming to the surface of 70 to 90 euros per year .
the main reason for the forthcoming price increase is the increase in the so-called ed@@ f conversion rate of 5.@@ 3 % .
this lev@@ y is calculated every october by the four operators .
this figure is the same as that given to them by the energy turn , which they are to be comp@@ en@@ sa@@ ted by a lev@@ y on electricity .
the city ’ s p@@ f@@ ul@@ l@@ endor@@ f works are the last link in this chain .
the supervisory board of the energy company was represented in its forec@@ asts by even higher tur@@ nover .
now the concrete figures should be calculated .
&quot; we are moving from an increase of 1 cent plus x to a reduction of 1.@@ 8 % , &quot; says bi@@ as , where the number is more near the 2 cent .
at the traffic light on end@@ ur@@ red : wait until you reach the end of the road , make sure you have the right lights on .
sometimes a traffic light is simply not green .
the contact loo@@ p in the street does not respond , or the light symbol is def@@ ec@@ tive .
what should we do then - at red drive ?
if a member of the public has been in a red light long enough to stop the inter@@ section , the inter@@ section can continue , the stop will tell you how to proceed .
the waiting time must be shor@@ ten@@ ed .
bec@@ ker is advis@@ ing to wait at least five minutes before starting a functional dis@@ order of the traffic lights .
anyone who wants to drive despite the red lights will have to be aware of the fact that the road is not suitable for a road accident .
anyone who has spent less than five minutes will wait for the next few minutes , but war@@ ns bec@@ ker and points to a decision by the supreme court .
the draft negotiated agreement is a step in the right direction , and the driver has to leave the traffic lights in the direction of three minutes and has to decide for a neglig@@ ent breach of red light .
the traffic light was not dis@@ inf@@ ec@@ t@@ ant , but jum@@ ped a little later on to green .
a driving ban was not allowed to him because of the special situation - the fine was not .
local council is pleased to have solid budget and is pleased to have a solid budget .
whenever there is a conflict in local counc@@ ils , it is a matter of may@@ or r@@ alp@@ h ger@@ ster .
the municip@@ al bag is available in her@@ d@@ w@@ ang@@ en-@@ sch@@ ö@@ n@@ n and is well known for its excellent service and its ability to handle debt since 2005 .
that is also the year 2012 , which is the full success of the european union .
this was confirmed in the presentation of the annual accounts for 2012 .
as andre@@ a ro@@ th@@ mun@@ d explained , the first step is to increase the administrative budget to a total of eur 7.@@ 6 million .
the overwhel@@ ming sur@@ plus of the administrative budget would also be around eur 1.@@ 8 million , which would amount to around eur 1 million .
the fact that the council has sur@@ plus , in particular , is higher business tax revenue and the community share of income tax .
the asset budget was again clearly above the planned level of value .
instead of the eur 1.5 million envis@@ aged , it was eur 2.5 million last year .
&quot; this is essentially due to the higher feed from the administrative budget &quot; , says ro@@ th@@ m@@ und .
since the financial year 2012 is less investment than planned , the commission has proposed that the budget should be reduced .
overall , the general reserve has been around eur 2.@@ 1 million , to a total of eur 4.@@ 9 million now .
may@@ or r@@ alp@@ h ger@@ ster thanks the don@@ ors of ro@@ th@@ mun@@ d and their team for their good work .
&quot; such a work sha@@ kes the mind not just because it is a work of p@@ raise , &quot; ger@@ ster p@@ raised the annual accounts .
he and the municip@@ al counc@@ ils were pleased to see the good figures .
it may seem par@@ ado@@ x@@ ical , but this good figures could be a good thing for the citizens to come .
the hotel is located in the heart of the city , just a few minutes from the city centre .
this , in turn , is already causing , according to ger@@ ster , the need to cut back on aid from the country on a number of occasions .
for these grants , the various member states have to pay a high price for them .
among other things , cities and municip@@ alities , which receive subsidies , must be able to use certain le@@ vers .
&quot; the theme of lif@@ ting is something we have to look at , because in the years to come , investments are on the line , for which we would like to have grants &quot; , ger@@ ster announced in this context .

ken@@ y@@ an press ou@@ tr@@ ages controversial issues , including the media law , and calls for a change in the media law .
“ we are in a bet@@ ter-@@ than@@ -@@ expected situation , and we must ask ourselves : what does parliament think of the fact that tomorrow it simply wants to abol@@ ish judicial independence ? ” , in the newspaper , the newspaper published the draft law was not written .
“ the law is dr@@ ac@@ on@@ ian and very pun@@ ish@@ able and we refuse to do so , ” said cy@@ r@@ us kam@@ au , managing director of the capital group , to which capital funds are also part .
he said that the new media tri@@ bun@@ al “ will always be bi@@ ased , but it is not a pro@@ long@@ ed arm ” .
“ i hope the president list@@ ens to us and we appeal to him to do so .
according to the star newspaper , the government is taking control of the media effectively through the new law , “ the media is effectively thro@@ wing away the str@@ ang@@ le@@ hold ” , which is what the standard , democracy and freedom of speech in ken@@ ya had “ suffered a severe b@@ low . ” .
the adoption of the law is one of a series of measures to ensure that national security is maintained as a follow-up to the attacks by armed islam@@ ists .

after the new law , media houses with a penalty of up to 20 million ken@@ y@@ an sh@@ ill@@ ings can be laid down and individual journalists can be arrested with up to one million and the further risk of losing their professional recognition or of an official press ac@@ cred@@ itation .
the tri@@ bun@@ al has also the right to block the pos@@ session of those concerned , if a penalty is not paid .
according to daily nation , “ the world can already have a single penalty for most radio stations bank@@ ru@@ pt . ”
in addition , the newspaper considers that these measures could be a dam@@ aging effect on the lives of the people who , according to their description , are “ lively blo@@ go@@ sphere . ”
if you want to silence the media , you have the chance to go un@@ pun@@ ished by politicians whatever you want .

at the same time , the importance of the city and the football club was not mentioned in the official opening cere@@ mony for the kun@@ str@@ ass sports ground despite the cold weather and rain .
a more pleasant celebr@@ ation is the result of the first meeting of the new team last saturday , but peter did not want to play .
for example , all those who had been able to travel without um@@ bre@@ lla or to have such a guide for some reason had no access to it .
that was what the musicians who had to make the fe@@ ast surrounded the festival , as well as many speakers .
we@@ t was therefore also the f@@ c chairman al@@ bre@@ cht sch@@ len@@ ker , who was convinced of the ful@@ fil@@ ment of a dream .
his thanks were due to the may@@ or wal@@ ter kl@@ um@@ p@@ p , who op@@ ted for the implementation of the project .

six years ago , thoughts were raised about the creation of an artificial tur@@ f sports ground , which was generally known as the ultimate solution .
concrete plans have been put forward two years ago , when the f@@ c launched the sch@@ ab@@ el@@ stu@@ be in pe@@ ren@@ n@@ ach@@ t , a cost contribution of eur 100 000 to build the square and the country supported funds from eur 10@@ 4 000 .
the municip@@ al council decided to establish a new municip@@ al administration in october 2012 .
the construction of the 68 installations 10@@ 8 meters in size of artificial tur@@ f was started on 4 june .

this was accompanied by the competent working group in berlin on the morning .
among other things , it is about direct democracy , meps &apos; bri@@ ber@@ y and the federal police .
on the morning i also wanted to ask the working group on migration and integration to continue their discussions .
the fact that the european parliament is to be consulted on the issue of dual citizenship is likely to be a matter of mutual understanding .

the un@@ expected incident was reported by the police when a 51 year old driver of a swiss seat i@@ bi@@ za was killed on thursday evening .
just before the roun@@ d@@ about at the sch@@ ä@@ z@@ le , he noted that he was on the left side of the road in the direction of stro@@ me@@ y@@ er@@ s@@ dor@@ f@@ stra@@ ß@@ e and moved to the right lan@@ e .
this was the collapse of the european parliament , which was the driving bmw of a 23@@ -@@ year-@@ old con@@ stan@@ t@@ ine .

vienna airport creates passenger cab@@ ins from the airport .
mr max ma@@ i@@ er , please come to gate 24 .
if we do not succeed in this , it will be at vienna sch@@ w@@ ec@@ hat airport in the future .
a large part of the speakers are not connected .
a relaxing and relaxing atmosphere is the key to the success of this innovation .
as air@@ port@@ -@@ speakers peter kle@@ em@@ ann said to radio vienna , the next step is to take the vienna airport to the tun@@ e of di@@ stances affecting individuals , an international trend .
for example , under the current system , airports in copenhagen , frankfurt or du@@ ba@@ i are already giving up on the noise .
the removal of this di@@ vor@@ ce - on average , the t@@ ones of one day about 200 personal calls by the speakers of the speaker - should make it more qui@@ e@@ ter at the airport in the future .
&quot; it has also changed in the experience that the latter individual di@@ stances are relatively little per@@ ceived , while at the same time all other information on changed flight paths or ab@@ rid@@ ges here is a little sub@@ mer@@ ged &quot; , says kle@@ em@@ ann in the talk .
high@@ lan@@ der g@@ ame@@ play on the kal@@ ten@@ hof !

four and a half metres is the tree tr@@ un@@ k , and 25 to 30 kil@@ o@@ gram@@ s is heavy .
&quot; it is not the wide range , &quot; explains organiz@@ er peter sa@@ ile .
the tri@@ be must be ver@@ tical and must be thro@@ wn out of the tree once and then straight to the ground .
this will be achieved with most points .
the hor@@ s@@ es@@ ho@@ e thro@@ wing is about the accuracy of the target .
eight meters away , the road is pav@@ ed on a p@@ f@@ lock .

we would like to have a suitable clothing , for example , the competition in the scot@@ tish rock can take place .
but weak@@ er countries also have a bre@@ ed .
for the &quot; out@@ fit &quot; , the company will award a prize of a few more bonus points .
sign up you can register until one hour before the competition begins .
the scot@@ tish and sw@@ ab@@ ian high-@@ lan@@ der teams have been working on the track for the first time in the history of the game and the trac@@ tor pul@@ ling , which is starting half an hour earlier .

milk and prote@@ in alternatives in the picture at a gl@@ ance
ve@@ gan@@ e nutri@@ tion requires vege@@ table alternatives to prote@@ ins , milk , and milk products .
p@@ ü@@ ri@@ er to@@ f@@ u with vege@@ table cre@@ am , for example , is a quar@@ k@@ ter set .
other words , the vege@@ t@@ arian her@@ d is the world ve@@ gan day on november 1 .
the vege@@ t@@ arian her@@ d germany proposes a new “ vege@@ t@@ arian ” event on november 1 .
pure plant mar@@ gar@@ ine is a good alternative to but@@ ter , yo@@ gh@@ ur@@ t lam@@ b by so@@ y yo@@ gh@@ ur@@ t .
instead of milk , so@@ ya , ha@@ irs , ch@@ ick@@ en and go@@ at farmers could be used to produce milk .
the most important plant cre@@ am is the her@@ bal cre@@ am , which is used to replace the traditional bu@@ ck@@ le cre@@ am .
the hotel is located in the centre of the city , in the heart of the city .
half a frag@@ mented society , divided into two parts , is not , for example , a suitable link for an eg@@ g .
50 gram@@ s of apple is also a good thing .
loc@@ ally , the pa@@ sta is coo@@ ked instead of eg@@ g , for example , with a mix@@ ture of a tea spo@@ on ba@@ king pow@@ der , a dining spo@@ on and three tab@@ les@@ po@@ ons of min@@ eral water .
but 50 gram@@ s of so@@ y@@ aj@@ yo@@ gh@@ ur@@ t or sil@@ k yo@@ gh@@ ur@@ t can also fulfil this purpose .
according to the ve@@ b@@ u , the number of people currently eating in germany is 800 000 , i.e. purely vege@@ table .
sle@@ ep@@ less in new york
on the way to your host families in we@@ y@@ mouth , mass@@ ach@@ us@@ et@@ ts , the students learned to learn the black forest heritage .
after eight hours of flight , the tour went straight to bro@@ ok@@ ly@@ n bridge , over which you can walk the heart of the city , man@@ h@@ att@@ an .
here , the first of these was a fascinating view of the world famous sky@@ line , which was built in the evening light and attrac@@ ted a special charm .
the tim@@ ing shift has made the students almost 24 hours on the leg@@ s , but fa@@ i@@ th@@ fully the mo@@ tto &quot; the city sle@@ eps not &quot; became the day on times square .
despite shut@@ down , the last day of the release was still the first time that the stat@@ ue of liber@@ ty was reached with a fer@@ ry and you can walk .
then it was about the financial centre to cover wall street for the mem@@ orial of the 11@@ th september .
on the third day , students were able to benefit from the 3@@ 73 meters high observation platform of the emp@@ ire@@ -@@ stage school .
after that , the he@@ avi@@ est part of the new york streets went over the ro@@ c@@ ke@@ f@@ ell@@ er center to central park , which is an ideal opportunity to stay for a short time in the autumn sun .
after a short flight from new york to bo@@ ston , the students are now in their host families .
in this year too , the name day of the holy hu@@ ber@@ tus is celebrated in the par@@ ish church of st. mari@@ en on the hill .
st. hu@@ ber@@ tus was the s@@ age after a fairly rec@@ k@@ less hun@@ ter , who was caught by a vision and later turned into a bis@@ hop of li@@ è@@ ge .

the formal fair will take place on sunday , november 3 , at 11.@@ 30 a.m.
the newly designed optical zo@@ om lens is a perfect combination of a new café and a new bar .
one thing that is not to be missed and to come back again .
one thing that has changed the name of the program .
as a dé@@ j@@ à v@@ u , according to the le@@ x@@ icon , a psycho@@ logical phenomenon is defined in the sense that it is a new situation that has already been experienced or seen .
in the case of the visit of the same named caf@@ e at the op@@ sch@@ la@@ g in the district town of kle@@ ve in sight to the rhe@@ in-@@ wa@@ al university , it does not have to be the pure dé@@ j@@ à v@@ u feeling .
finally , the café has a beautiful name , which is exactly what it is all about : a real stay not only in the mind but also in the everyday life .
because it is fun , and it &apos;s just beautiful .
a look at the interior of the op@@ t@@ sch@@ la@@ g 8 gives the vie@@ wer an impression of the op@@ t@@ ing-@@ out .
the ul@@ tr@@ am@@ o@@ der@@ n , but not cool , café ambi@@ ence looks like a place to feel good .
the hotel offers a wide range of services and facilities for the whole family .
there is a delicious buffet breakfast , or you can enjoy your own fres@@ h@@ ly ba@@ ked bag@@ u@@ et@@ tes .
the owners , both 33 years old , have been able to register before the opening of the pretty caf@@ e at the op@@ sch@@ la@@ g as a gastronom@@ ic destination : in k@@ ran@@ enburg they conducted the art lounge .
from moving to kle@@ ve , to the op@@ sch@@ la@@ g , the sympa@@ th@@ ic caf@@ é@@ -@@ lovers of the area are ho@@ ping for more audience .
last but not least , the university .
&quot; we don &apos;t have a specific target group , &quot; dani@@ el b@@ ü@@ tt@@ ner emphasi@@ zes .
i would rather like to see the two young students here , as well as senior citizens and all ages .
speaking of the caf@@ é@@ -@@ lovers , you can enjoy the atmosphere of the hotel .
the friendly and helpful staff will be happy to assist you with any questions you may have .
enjoy the du@@ m@@ pl@@ ings of hot ba@@ ked bread in the most varied vari@@ ations .

&quot; to do this , a bag@@ u@@ ette - that is my thing &quot; , be@@ tr@@ ays it to the n@@ r@@ z .
two events were held in the summer of 2008 in the bright café .
to put it better , one thing .
this is because the port festival took place outside - it is the café dé@@ j@@ à v@@ u that bene@@ fi@@ ted from it .
but there were also the r@@ ing@@ el@@ nat@@ z@@ evening .
&quot; beautiful , successful and fun@@ ny &quot; , they found the two 3@@ 3-@@ year-@@ old .
but not everyone is in favour of it .
perhaps dani@@ el is b@@ ü@@ tt@@ ner because he is not a very special fan of event music .
and with a event i speak again only the ones who are interested in the event .
that is why events are becoming the exception .
&quot; we want to make the normal operation as little as possible &quot; .
is this to mean dé@@ j@@ à v@@ u also for reliable and reliable .
with regard to the quality of the products that are offered here , as well as the team and the beautiful environment at the op@@ sch@@ la@@ g in kle@@ ve .
the road that runs more and more to a gastronom@@ ic tradition is a very interesting one .
to the deli@@ ght of many kle@@ e , who want to visit the nearby and the students who visit the ga@@ stro@@ m@@ ile and thus also the café dé@@ j@@ à v@@ u for themselves .

a special thanks to the rapporteur for his excellent cooperation with the team of club owners .
the m@@ g@@ v &quot; fried@@ rich@@ -@@ wil@@ hel@@ m &quot; meets at its regular meetings with the cho@@ ir and the orchestra on tu@@ es@@ days at 7.@@ 45 p.m. in the club lounge .
&quot; new san@@ ges@@ ch@@ ü@@ tz@@ te tun@@ es are welcome at any time &quot; , says sch@@ lo@@ t@@ mann .
a proc@@ laim@@ ed new goals in the fight against poverty .
the united nations will begin immediately with the drafting of a series of new objectives that will enable the un ’ s millennium development goals , announced 12 years ago , to be re@@ alised .
in the run@@ -up to the un summit on sustainable development , which will take place in rio de jan@@ e@@ iro in the evening , austr@@ ali@@ an diplom@@ ats played a key role in adv@@ ancing “ sustainable development goals ” that the 20@@ 15 em@@ i@@ gration .
they were created in the final draft of the document which was adopted by the world leaders in the field , including mrs g@@ ill@@ ard , at the summit .
un secre@@ tar@@ y-@@ general ban ki@@ -@@ moon explained in the evening at the summit that the time has come to talk about “ national interests ” .
“ i am pleased that the european union ’ s member states agreed to continue to support a process that will bring about a universal ban on the development of sustainable development . ”
“ these goals are set on our progress from the millennium development goals , ” said dr. peter fit@@ z@@ ger@@ ald , chairman of the board of directors of the international monetary fund .
i will spare no effort to ensure that this is the case , which is granted to me by the member states , in order to make our vision of sustainable development objectives , based on the success of the millennium goals . ”
even if the s@@ g achi@@ m / ba@@ den has been in the game for four days without victory , the hand@@ ball upper league continues to be a good mo@@ od .
this is what co@@ ach tom@@ as@@ z mal@@ mon leaves no doubt about .
all are still fully motivated and have a great deal of experience .
nevertheless , i hope that we will finally be able to win again .
&quot; for i know already that i don &apos;t know how such a victory was tas@@ ted , &quot; says mal@@ mon .
even if the third li@@ ga@@ -@@ reserve is made of fre@@ den@@ bec@@ k currently no trees , it is still a good idea to point out that mal@@ mon is already producing trees .
many players have already lost their way to the a-@@ ju@@ g@@ end .
that is why they are being held against their ex@@ -@@ co@@ ach , and i am sure they will be particularly motivated .
&quot; in addition , we must see if there is any need for rein@@ for@@ cement from the first , &quot; explains the s@@ g-@@ co@@ ach .
to finally return to the success story , the european union must make itself aware of the fact that the mal@@ mon@@ t team has been on the right track .
above all , in the area of coverage and the swit@@ ching game ha@@ per@@ te has been hit hard recently .
the equal opportunities of women must also definitely be improved .
i therefore hope that my players will be able to play at last during the short break .
safety concerns in moz@@ ambi@@ que are growing in the face of cl@@ ash@@ es between influ@@ ential figures and political figures .
thousands of people gathered in the centre of ma@@ pu@@ to under the wat@@ ch@@ ful eyes of the stat@@ ue of sam@@ ora mach@@ el , the founder of the state and first president of moz@@ ambi@@ que , to attend a rare public demonstration of peace .
“ we want peace again , we want stability , ” said van@@ ess@@ a de s@@ ous@@ a , managing director of an investment company .
fear of the future of the country , it has changed its business clothes to a t-@@ shir@@ t with the title “ we demand security ” on portuguese .
for two weeks there have been reports almost daily of cl@@ ash@@ es between government forces and ren@@ am@@ o , which have been one of the worst fighting since the pre-@@ 196@@ 7 peace agreement .
ren@@ am@@ o was a former school of not@@ ori@@ ous re@@ bel movements , which initially seemed to be inspired by the r@@ ho@@ desi@@ a rul@@ ed by white people and later by the apar@@ the@@ id government of south africa .
after the peace treaty of 1992 , it became an opposition party .
analy@@ sts consider it in@@ prob@@ able that the country will return to a full-@@ blo@@ wn conflict , with the us and japan ’ s recent events having hit foreign investors and loc@@ als .
for the rapidly growing economy , there is a lot at stake , because the discovery of huge gas resources before the coast and coal mines is a major challenge .
the ruling fre@@ lin@@ o@@ che party , which has been the dominant party since 197@@ 5 , and ren@@ am@@ o are bl@@ aming each other for the ten@@ sions .
ren@@ am@@ o claims that the government has not yet resolved the recent cl@@ ash@@ es by making the most of its members in the province of so@@ fal@@ a , a traditional strong@@ hold of ren@@ am@@ os on 17 october .
the attacks on the former re@@ be@@ ls es@@ cal@@ ated , when the government forces ren@@ a@@ mo@@ -@@ sup@@ porters were att@@ acking the country .
the government gives ren@@ am@@ o the blame for the cl@@ ash@@ es and acc@@ us@@ ations of the organization of att@@ acking soldiers .
president ar@@ man@@ do gu@@ e@@ bu@@ za has tried to raise concerns about inst@@ ability .
the new version of the a@@ stronom@@ i@@ k a@@ stronom@@ er , the first of its kind , was released in january 2008 .
both fre@@ lim@@ o and ren@@ am@@ o stress that the only way to avoid war is to avoid war .
but the concerns have increased , since ma@@ z@@ an@@ ga began to say that the european union is ren@@ am@@ o , and that the mon@@ ten@@ e@@ gro peace agreement was concluded in 1992 .
the hotel is located in the heart of the city , in the heart of the city , in the heart of the city .
“ our vision is to re@@ open negotiations and to do so seriously , ” said ma@@ z@@ ang@@ a .
previous discussions between the parties have only had little to do with resol@@ ving the ten@@ sions caused by a series of cl@@ ash@@ es this year .
“ we have two adults men ( gu@@ e@@ bu@@ za and d@@ hi ) , and we have two children , who are the ones who meet the heads ” , says joseph h@@ ann@@ on , lec@@ ture@@ r at the open university and mo@@ sam@@ a@@ j .
none of them is good at negotiating and none is prepared to accept the necessary conc@@ essions .
ren@@ am@@ o , who was waiting for electoral reforms , has already said that it will not win the local elections in november .
presidential and presidential elections are a major challenge for next year .
some comm@@ ent@@ ators have critic@@ ised the use of violence as an attempt to impose a ti@@ res@@ ome movement , making conc@@ essions and financial conc@@ essions for the government .
ren@@ am@@ os ’ electoral success is shr@@ in@@ king since 1992 , while a ne@@ wer party , head@@ ed by an earlier rena@@ issance member , has been running a crisis .
ma@@ z@@ ang@@ a claims that gu@@ e@@ bu@@ za – whose return to power is due when his second term ends in the coming year – is democracy in the country .
“ he does not want multi-@@ party democracy , he does not want transparent elections , he wants peace , because he wants the presidential office not to give up , ” he says .
it is un@@ clear what the capacity of ren@@ am@@ o is , but it has un@@ rest and has led to sti@@ r@@ ring attacks on police stations and vehicles on an important north-@@ south link .
most of the fighting took place in the province of so@@ fal@@ a , which was a few hundred kilometres north of ma@@ pu@@ to , in the region of both be@@ ira and the port , the mountain blocks and the city of rio t@@ into .
in june , the rio summit inter@@ rup@@ ted the use of the railways for one month after ren@@ am@@ o launched an attack on the track .
ma@@ z@@ ang@@ a rep@@ lied re@@ luc@@ tan@@ tly to the question of whether ren@@ am@@ o could repeat this threat .
ren@@ am@@ o wanted to “ strengthen the international community that the things in moscow are not going well ” , says the president of the republic of moz@@ ambi@@ que .
the inst@@ ability has tri@@ g@@ ge@@ red fru@@ stration with the government , and says fer@@ nan@@ do li@@ ma , head of medi@@ a@@ coo@@ p , a independent media company , because many people are wor@@ ried about the crisis .
“ people think that the world ’ s government and president are responsible for the country ’ s future , and they are supposed to be the one who can find solutions to the problems ” , he explains .
om@@ ar sul@@ tan@@ e , a demonstr@@ ator , said that the people wanted to just have stability .
“ no one is interested in ren@@ am@@ o and fre@@ lim@@ o , they just want peace and us@@ able roads , ” he explained .
children should be my@@ ths and leg@@ ends known as “ models for life ” .
the stories of th@@ or showed that the world is becoming more and more “ brut@@ al ” against cle@@ ver tr@@ ic@@ ks , and the ar@@ tus leg@@ end demonstrates that the world is important to be able to make a dream .
many of the my@@ ths are “ at far from perfect ” , however , to off@@ ensive , and in some cases to dir@@ ty .
“ i find it wonderful that the report on my@@ ths and my@@ ths in america has already been part of education , ” he said .
i have already done this for twenty years as a plan .
he added that the commission should be more careful with authors and teachers who “ over@@ ly di@@ d@@ ac@@ tic ” .
cros@@ s@@ ley hol@@ land , the be@@ o@@ whe@@ el@@ f from the ang@@ lo@@ -@@ sa@@ x@@ on language and author of the pen@@ gu@@ in book of norway my@@ ths and the british library , has been a member of the board .
perhaps the greatest difference between an adult author , who is adult , and a writer who is not a child , is that he is a child .
not everything has to be simplified or to be happy end .
this must be under@@ min@@ ed .
this is the old story of showing instead of telling .
han@@ s@@ j@@ ak@@ o@@ b is going to fre@@ i@@ hof again .
100 years ago , he@@ in@@ rich han@@ s@@ j@@ ak@@ o@@ b was reti@@ ring in ha@@ z@@ lan .

from the arrival to the award of the hon@@ or@@ ary citizenship to his death , he had the writer and han@@ s@@ j@@ ak@@ ob@@ s@@ author alo@@ is kra@@ f@@ tz@@ cy@@ k a fun and enter@@ taining piece .

and then the scenario began , and in which alo@@ is kr@@ af@@ cz@@ y@@ k once again entered his par@@ a@@ dig@@ m role as a great son of the city .
sty@@ led , he continued with the two-@@ volume &quot; sch@@ war@@ z@@ wal@@ d &quot; and &quot; sch@@ war@@ z@@ wal@@ d fü@@ ch@@ sen &quot; from m@@ ü@@ h@@ len@@ bach .
he was not only invited by the audience with much applause , but also his si@@ ster phili@@ pp@@ ine was called him welcome .
bil@@ ly s@@ um-@@ her@@ mann has understood that he was incredi@@ bly good at inter@@ acting with the role of si@@ ster .
between the individual game scenes , the ti@@ de of m@@ ü@@ h@@ len@@ bach farm cha@@ pel played selected music pieces and thus roun@@ ded off the performance .
to award the hon@@ or@@ ary citizenship , the h@@ as@@ lan may@@ or h@@ ass@@ le w@@ inc@@ ler then gave himself the honour to represent the then may@@ or of h@@ as@@ lan .
their up@@ take made the tri@@ ple queen and queen of the world , han@@ s@@ j@@ ak@@ o@@ b , the first to declare that &quot; o@@ h how beautiful , there will be youth inter@@ actions again in my own tri@@ enni@@ al period alive &quot; .
with her song &quot; o jesus christ &quot; she tells us that she was happy to have the audience in the open court as well as the stor@@ ch@@ ent@@ ag@@ sk@@ in@@ der with her l@@ oud &quot; , out &quot; .
his criticism of the am@@ ts@@ kir@@ che had been made at that time in exactly the same way as his concerns about the exc@@ esses in agriculture , the consequences of industri@@ alisation or the effects of war .
in the home of the hotel , behind its tom@@ b cha@@ pel on the fire near ho@@ f@@ st@@ ä@@ t@@ ten , he found his place of rest .
&quot; an un@@ quiet mind had finally had its peace and was for ever a home away , &quot; he said .
i am very much applause and many p@@ raise have been expressed by the audience for the performance .

the first of these was the &quot; new &quot; , which was founded in 19@@ 45 , and is head@@ ed by car@@ ol@@ ine h@@ ir@@ sch , the founder of the stand@@ -up institution car@@ ol@@ ines .

we have this festival designed to make us continue to work with you .
in this year &apos;s event there are performances by the w@@ anda sym@@ kes , kat@@ h@@ y gri@@ ff@@ in and bill ma@@ her as well as by the stand up for her@@ oes .
with the festival is also the world of com@@ edy ge@@ grew .
a number of com@@ edi@@ ans , which will be taking part in the festival this year , are known for their rather un@@ conventional ways , such as broad@@ ca@@ sts on smaller tv channels such as com@@ edy central , f@@ x and spi@@ ke .
n@@ ick k@@ roll was played with a sit@@ com in cable television ( the ir@@ ony of the sli@@ p@@ per@@ y fant@@ as@@ y football series ) .

from 2005 to 2007 , the group moder@@ ated a television programme entitled “ si@@ t down ” .
the meeting will take place in town hall in the heart of man@@ h@@ att@@ an .
“ the city is definitely in the co@@ smo@@ politan city of the city of lar@@ ry &apos;s total work ” , said ste@@ in@@ berg .

&quot; after years , i have reached an agreement with the international atom@@ ic energy agency to reduce the differences between the last few years . &quot;

dr@@ ama in ur@@ u@@ gu@@ ay : young dau@@ gh@@ ters kill gam@@ bl@@ ers with ma@@ ke@@ -up , and the police kill them .
two children have been killed in ur@@ u@@ gu@@ ay in the murder of a 1@@ 1-@@ year-@@ old .

with mac@@ he@@ tes and k@@ ni@@ ves , the army of the k@@ ni@@ ves er@@ st@@ aged the 11@@ th anniversary of the fall of the berlin wall and cast the cor@@ pse into a foun@@ tain .
we would then have had to wait for you before your apartments in a work@@ ing-@@ class quarter .
the ligh@@ test and most powerful weapon is the &quot; k@@ az@@ on &quot; .
as an ali@@ bi , a fi@@ ve-@@ year half-@@ si@@ ster of the younger , which you had taken with you , should say that she was sex@@ ually as@@ sa@@ ul@@ ted by the young .
when the girl was in front of the police , however , the incident occurred without men@@ tioning an attack against her , the two young people gave up the deliber@@ ate killing of the 1@@ 1-@@ year-@@ old .
the reason was the el@@ der among other things called a ri@@ val@@ ry in the football game .
he was tempor@@ arily taken to a psy@@ chi@@ at@@ ric youth institute , where he was a member of the european parliament .
p@@ im@@ ps must be sent to prison .
due to explo@@ it@@ ative trafficking in human beings , p@@ im@@ ps , threats , insul@@ ts and dangerous bo@@ d@@ ily in@@ jury , the district court of kon@@ stan@@ z has ordered a 3@@ 3-@@ year-@@ old man from st. geor@@ gen to three and a half years imprison@@ ment .

so the council has made a decision on the internet or telephone contacts to women in five cases , which it has to make after a few weeks against their will .
resistance has always been used to force and threats to break .
the revenue of women who are sometimes subject to years of age for them is not enough to pay for them .
by conf@@ is@@ c@@ ating the hand@@ sets and si@@ m cards , the user prohibited contacts between women and the outside world .
together with a colleague who has been rap@@ ing women , he has brought them to various bro@@ th@@ els in the sou@@ th@@ west .
there he left them partly to monitor to keep their revenue .
in court , the accused claimed that he had been accused of being a serious s@@ cour@@ ge after colleagues in afghanistan were att@@ acked in an explo@@ sion .
after a psy@@ chi@@ at@@ ric expert has been able to express great doubts about the mental limitations and thus about a limited school of guil@@ t , the problem was raised by the 3@@ 3-@@ year-@@ old .
the court had to remove none of the damaged women .
as a cri@@ p@@ o official reported , the commission &apos;s proposals for a new regulation on the internet have been able to prevent at least four other cases of explo@@ it@@ ative trafficking in human beings .
the se@@ aled talks were of high aggres@@ sion and the people were very aggres@@ sive .
in later periods of inter@@ ro@@ gation , the in@@ ju@@ red would have lost their mar@@ ty@@ r@@ dom .

oil price continues to rise to 96 usd .
the price of oil is also continuing to fall on friday , after concerns about a high supply over@@ sh@@ ad@@ ow@@ ed a report that the energy giant manufacturing sector of china is growing .
the reference pi@@ pes are used for the supply of the finished product in the late morning in europe in electronic commerce at the new york mer@@ can@@ tile exchange .
the treaty was amended by 39 c@@ ents on thursday , which meant a fall in the price of 5.@@ 8 percent in october .
the large cru@@ de oil supply has increased prices in the past few weeks , and the price of oil has fallen .
the energy ministry of the united states declared on wednesday that the us offer last week was 4@@ ,@@ 1 million bar@@ re@@ ls .
over the course of five weeks , the offer has been increased by 25 million bar@@ re@@ ls .
but on friday there were indic@@ ations of increased demand by two reports on an activity increase of 2.@@ 7 % in chinese manufacturing .
this indicates the need for continued cooperation between the european union and china &apos;s economy , whose growth is 7.@@ 8 % in the third quarter .
cru@@ de oil from the variety bren@@ t , a reference plant in the international oil and gas industry , is also a good example of the american re@@ fin@@ eries .

the appeal court ce@@ ased to exist on tuesday to discuss the arguments for the suspension .
the appeal report explained that the judge &apos;s decision was to be taken by the case .
the jud@@ ges had hoped that the case would be brought to justice , that police officers w@@ oun@@ ded the civil rights of tens of thousands of people , because they were deliber@@ ately black and latin american men with the stop attack .
it appointed the commission to set up an external monitoring body to monitor the implementation of substantial changes , including reforms in directives , training and supervision , and set up a pilot programme with the bodies tr@@ acked .
in august , the city of new york declared itself willing to continue the practice of stor@@ ing names and addresses of people who had been arrested after a control by the police .
an oral negotiation is not possible for the city to be called after 14 march 20@@ 14 .
the stop clause is a good way to get rid of the current situation .
controls of this kind have been in place for decades , but the number of cases recorded has increased during the term of office of the par@@ tis@@ an may@@ or michael blo@@ om@@ berg to an all-@@ time high of 6@@ 8@@ 4.@@ 3@@ 30 in 2011 , which is now the year , and the us .
in 2004 , four men who have all minorities were arrested and sent@@ enced to death .
ad@@ voca@@ tes of amendments to the stop and end hair@@ cut programme of the n@@ y@@ p@@ d say that the changes will create unfair practices and create a crisis of confidence and effectiveness .
oppon@@ ents believe that the changes would undermine the mor@@ ality of the police .

with this be@@ du@@ in@@ we@@ is@@ he@@ it , the first chairman wol@@ f@@ gan@@ g hen@@ ne described the history and fas@@ c@@ ination of the association &quot; helping hands &quot; .
on saturday evening , the president of the european parliament , mr van vel@@ zen , celebrated the t@@ enth anniversary of the association , which can already have considerable success .
the first chairman , hen@@ ne , reported in detail about the work of the association .
he himself was a member of the european parliament for the first time in maur@@ it@@ ania in 2004 , in the ch@@ ei@@ j@@ k z@@ aj@@ ed@@ -@@ k@@ ran@@ ken@@ haus in n@@ ou@@ ak@@ ch@@ ot@@ t .
in the after@@ mat@@ h , further cooperation developed and the gy@@ nec@@ o@@ log@@ ist hen@@ ne led the field on several trips to perform numerous operations .
during the speeches , pictures of the dep@@ loy@@ ments on a large screen were shown , so that the guests of the ju@@ bil@@ ee event of the mentioned actions can get an idea of the actions .
the deser@@ t vehicle of the association was also shown .
it is a very old house , and it is a very old german border guard vehicle .
ra@@ iner pre@@ w@@ o , former o@@ b von n@@ ag@@ ol@@ den , had proposed to use this vehicle with a photo@@ vol@@ ta@@ ic system .
in 2008 , the room facility was awarded the &quot; sch@@ le@@ e@@ h &quot; from ba@@ i@@ er@@ s@@ br@@ on@@ n in the record time of just under a week .
hen@@ ne mentioned the fact that a new mother child hospital was built in n@@ ou@@ ak@@ ch@@ ot@@ t .
the most interesting thing in times when n@@ ag@@ old is home to the we@@ gra@@ tion@@ ali@@ z@@ ation@@ ali@@ si@@ ert birth clin@@ ic .
you learn a lot in africa as a medical practi@@ tion@@ er , hen@@ ne said , for example , dis@@ integration against bur@@ n-@@ out .
due to the political un@@ rest in the country , it was not possible to travel as many as planned , but many medical professionals came to germany to attend to this in various areas .
in addition , contain@@ ers with material are regularly sent to africa , as in march this year medical equipment , medicines , associations and other equipment .
mi@@ t@@ ini@@ ti@@ ator han@@ s-@@ jo@@ achi@@ m fu@@ ch@@ tel himself provided ample information about local col@@ ori@@ tes , by providing a map of maur@@ it@@ ania from which to move go@@ at st@@ all .
when his personal mo@@ tives were called “ his work in the field of aud@@ iting ” , he called his young member .
when he realized that he was a lot of money lost , he was forced to leave the african continent .
moreover , fu@@ ch@@ tel stressed that global economy also requires global human love .
it should also not be forgotten that the african continent is closer to many people .
from gran can@@ aria , it is not far to africa .
cou@@ l@@ son used telephone h@@ ack@@ ings for the veri@@ fication of tips .
the former news of the world is published in the magazine , the german magazine and@@ y cou@@ l@@ son .
prosecu@@ tor andre@@ w ed@@ is q@@ c explained to the court in the old b@@ ail@@ ey , news of the world , in may 2005 , a false rum@@ our that the court was not able to issue a relationship with his “ attractive special advis@@ er . ”
the newspaper ordered the private dec@@ eas@@ ed g@@ len@@ n mu@@ ll@@ c@@ air@@ e to release pa@@ w@@ l@@ ys vo@@ ices to the public .
“ the commission considers that the prosecu@@ tion office is responsible for the prosecu@@ tion , which is now the editor of the emergency , and nobody who is facing the home of people and hopes to see them in a fresh fashion , but rather one who is a government .
he said that there is no need for three procedures to put stories into perspective .
the publish@@ er is personally involved in the third method .
obviously he knows about the second , monitoring , in other words , it cannot be otherwise .
what about the european union &apos;s first ?
does he know about the phone h@@ acking ?
he is argu@@ ing about this , but we are saying , ‘ and whether he knew of it ’ .
rum@@ ours about an aff@@ air by cla@@ kes were first heard by the feat@@ ure@@ -@@ ed@@ it@@ orial team of no@@ t@@ w when one source , which is sex@@ ually linked to pa@@ w@@ l@@ by , said .
a band with vo@@ ic@@ em@@ ail@@ s from your phone of at least three occasions was released in august 2006 in mul@@ cat , france .
the investigation teams found that the data were not available on the detec@@ tive computer , but on the pa@@ w@@ l@@ by and her si@@ ster as “ projects ” .
in the time when the b@@ ills were lo@@ wered , the commission and the council were given a new , anonymous and un@@ reliable call , which was a great help to their grand@@ parents .
meanwhile , the us supervis@@ ors supervis@@ ed the government of ne@@ vi@@ le th@@ urg@@ au@@ -@@ re@@ y@@ no@@ l@@ ds and former re@@ porter james we@@ at@@ her@@ up .
on 18 june 2005 , co@@ ul@@ son left her a vo@@ ic@@ email with following link : &quot; i am not a stor@@ y , i don &apos;t know if we want to publish it tomorrow .
e@@ is explained that cou@@ l@@ ons activities in this story are followed by the same pattern as in other important person@@ alities who , for example , the former home secretary david bl@@ un@@ ket@@ t .
the s@@ word is heard on thursday , that co@@ ul@@ son bl@@ un@@ ket@@ t was arrested for an aff@@ air with a married woman .
cou@@ l@@ son and bro@@ o@@ ks argue that the world is in trouble .
mul@@ ti ca@@ ire , thur@@ l@@ be@@ ck and we@@ at@@ her@@ up have the telephone system , which is the only way to get rid of the problem .
from protest against the planned eu reach agreement , the council of france is being called the first strike .
a simple and effective meeting will take place without result .
in the conflict over the re@@ tention of ric@@ her people , the government and professional football have been moving towards a failed state .
president fran@@ ç@@ o@@ is hol@@ lan@@ de received a letter from the paris parliament in é@@ ly@@ s@@ ée on thursday , but he was not allowed to hear the speech .
he refused to accept the idea of the foot ball from the planned school of 7@@ 5-@@ percent .
the present side of the house was also hard .
the commission &apos;s communication on the dispute that was announced at the end of november will now be carried out , announced by the head of the association of professional clubs ( uc@@ p@@ f ) , je@@ an-@@ pi@@ er@@ re lou@@ vel .
the agreement reached between 29 november and 2 december was a good start .
ge@@ ch@@ ingen : no absolute winner !
&quot; we want to get the inhabitants into the planning phase early , &quot; he opened the may@@ or of j@@ ens h@@ ä@@ us@@ ler the ci@@ vic information event on the flo@@ od protection concept in gel@@ ingen .
around 80 participants were involved in the municip@@ al hall to get to know the planned measures .
house owners asked why the &quot; the ultimate goal of the project is to make the members of the council &quot; .
the floo@@ ds that hit the country &apos;s southern borders on 15 may 2009 , hit the whole continent of europe with a huge amount of floo@@ ding .
a river bas@@ in survey was conducted with the neighbouring municip@@ ality of a@@ id@@ ling@@ en .
&quot; the protection of as many buil@@ t-@@ in land as possible is the goal &quot; , says me@@ i@@ ster@@ ler .
the basis of the planning is protection from a german weather forec@@ ast .
the climate change is being caused by a 15 % increase in the price .
in expert cir@@ cles , this is done with &quot; h@@ q 100@@ ak@@ li@@ ma &quot; .
the water mass@@ es , which were in chinese in 2009 for considerable damage , are still the same as the 10@@ 00@@ -@@ year-@@ old floo@@ ds .
&quot; an absolute protection is available not to , but a relative improvement can be achieved &quot; , says wol@@ f@@ gan@@ g .
to protect h@@ q 10@@ 0@@ battery pack , you need to have a memory card in g@@ ec@@ hes .
house owners will be happy to help you with your own projects .
i would like to draw the attention of the community to the participation of the citizens .
a complex and complex system is the result of a process of planning and approval .
in the best case , 20@@ 16 could begin to implement .
among other things , the concept of protection , which was adopted last week in the municip@@ al council ( we have been reporting ) , provides for local measures to flow the river irish into the bas@@ in of the tri@@ bal valley .
following the vote , the ho@@ ch@@ was@@ ser@@ sch@@ ut@@ z@@ ges@@ et@@ z took the opportunity to present their concerns .
among other things , it has been ques@@ tioned why more dam@@ s and re@@ ar bas@@ ins are not planned to protect the place .
gre@@ g@@ or k@@ ü@@ hn , technical designer of the engine@@ er &apos;s office wal@@ d and cor@@ be of h@@ ü@@ gel@@ sh@@ ei@@ m , who presented the concept , stressed that it was the inter@@ play of all the measures presented to us to achieve the sum .
in addition , it is necessary to take the most econom@@ ical solution , as jo@@ achi@@ m wal@@ d von wal@@ d and cor@@ be said .
dis@@ cour@@ te@@ sy prevail@@ ed among the al@@ tor@@ ts , who themselves were not able to reach the ground again and again during normal stor@@ ms .
the problem with the management is known and initial measures have already been taken .
house owners will be happy to help you with your own personal needs .
the municip@@ ality is obliged to inform the channel network in such a way that two to three years of reg@@ ener@@ ation can be accompl@@ ished .
the se@@ wage channels greater than the size of the se@@ wage channels would waste millions .
the most serious in@@ jury after the collapse of the german army was caused by the accident .
in the early friday afternoon , the national road 44 is near rev@@ ens@@ dorf two car drivers at a front door meeting .
the police bloc@@ ked the road immediately completely , could not reach the accident site .
however , there are various testi@@ mon@@ ies which are only evalu@@ ated when they are evalu@@ ated .
it is clear that the 19 year old hand@@ ler was a v@@ w golf player towards rev@@ ens@@ dorf .
both vehicles are cl@@ ou@@ ding , with the woman having been so hard hit in the st@@ all that the fire department had almost half an hour to get them out of the vehicle .
the real un@@ expected cause of the accident was not clear .
both are dev@@ a@@ stated in nearby cities , and the situation is not as bad as it might be .
the b@@ ound@@ ary remained in full sw@@ ing for about two hours .
one could describe him as the do@@ sto@@ ev@@ sky of the us .
phili@@ p k. di@@ ck was a god father and a son of the go@@ d@@ d@@ ess , his nov@@ els and stories .
what is striking is the relative position of the outside world : the techn@@ ic@@ alities , the bar@@ t , the high sti@@ r@@ n .
and so , as f@@ jo@@ d@@ or m. do@@ sto@@ ev@@ ski , with his massive o@@ eu@@ vre as a founder of and ap@@ lo@@ get of russian soul , under@@ stands that the russian soul is being read .
some tit@@ les are available in the he@@ y@@ ne ver@@ la@@ g , the ha@@ ff@@ man@@ s-@@ cas@@ set@@ te with the 1@@ 18 stories .
dic@@ k explains america - the empire of breathtaking technical progress .
dic@@ k had given a visit to the church to his late books , read like a mix@@ ture of rev@@ el@@ ation of john and a computer manual .
perhaps he was cra@@ zy , had drugs to his brain , and he was not .
he has cap@@ tured , already early that the computers di@@ ves@@ ted div@@ ini@@ ties .
he wrote a the@@ ology of the computer and asked me if it was possible to tell a man what a machine is , the cre@@ ator of his creation .
this is the &apos; bl@@ ade run@@ ner &apos; problem .
the killing .
a master of science fic@@ tion .
a fantastic writer , he has been a great writer .
his stories have shown film directors , such as rid@@ ley scot@@ t , john mc@@ ca@@ in and john mc@@ ca@@ in .
this story is now particularly significant .
the &quot; minority protection act &quot; is a report from 2001 .
it is here that the principle of &apos; pre-@@ crime &apos; is developed , &apos; pre-@@ crime &apos; is applied , that is , what is now more or less official doc@@ tr@@ ine of the white house .
in dic@@ k ’ s world , which is close to our sho@@ cking , mus@@ an@@ tes look into the future - and the police attack .
&quot; we collect individual data , which is not infring@@ ed by any law , &quot; says the chief of the authority .
&quot; we sn@@ ack them , we still have them a violent crime .
and : &quot; in our society there is no serious criminal who is responsible for this , we have a pun@@ ish@@ able fl@@ ame re@@ tar@@ dant &quot; , they read newspapers .
they participate in the worst of all , and they prevent the war on crime from being fought in the way that is .
dic@@ k &apos;s story is like the blue p@@ ause for the anti-@@ terror campaign laws and the ab@@ hor@@ rence of the n@@ sa .
anti-@@ zi@@ p of the attack on the ground : this is how obama ’ s dr@@ one philosophy and practice works .
but dic@@ k ’ s story is not over yet .
the police chief , mr president , compla@@ ins that there is no separation of powers .
then the over@@ ar@@ ching person is monitored and one of the future crimin@@ als is transferred .
the system re@@ vol@@ ves .
it is perfect , but it is lying .
it is inv@@ enting its own pre@@ requi@@ sites .
does er@@ ron@@ eous and sacrif@@ ice not only take place , but also buil@@ ds on it .
the system creates the risk of being comb@@ ated .
phili@@ p k. di@@ ck read is that he always says that the truth is closer .
the late roman empire was a major source of information for mer@@ kel in russia , but it was not a case of the late ha@@ ff@@ er who said mer@@ kel would have said that mer@@ kel would have been a russian sp@@ y .
the former us intelligence officer , john hu@@ me , has been accused of “ in@@ ti@@ mid@@ ating the us sp@@ ell@@ -@@ he@@ a@@ ther around chancell@@ or ang@@ ela mer@@ kel . ”
representatives of the german federal law office could either submit questions in writing or request the 30@@ -@@ year-@@ old to be personally met in russia , but inter@@ fax reported .
previously , the green bun@@ de@@ sta@@ g member , han@@ s-@@ christian sch@@ ö@@ be@@ le , had the first german politici@@ an snow@@ den in moscow yesterday .
n@@ sa ent@@ ch@@ ul@@ ls the company &apos;s par@@ an@@ o@@ ia for state surveillance and the use of state surveillance .
at a mil@@ d day at the end of august a german police helicop@@ ter fle@@ w deep across the us consul@@ ate in frankfurt am main , the financial capital of germany .
upon request of the federal office of civil law ( b@@ mb@@ f ) and the ministry of the environment ( b@@ v@@ t ) , the german ministry of internal security , he should be photograph@@ ing the roof of the us out@@ post , which is less than 5 km away from the european central bank .
according to the german media , the b@@ v@@ t wanted to limit the presence of monitoring an@@ ten@@ n@@ as and the action led to a change of wording between the usa and the german foreign ministry in berlin .
james cla@@ pper , us secretary of state for the environment , has said that the us treas@@ ury secretary has once again failed to provide any opportunities for foreign es@@ pi@@ on@@ age . “ to improve business secre@@ ts of foreign companies in order to serve us companies . ”
but since ed@@ ward snow@@ den , who was elected wh@@ ist@@ le@@ b@@ lower , the world has been running out of the woods with the publication of his filling hor@@ n .
reports that the american national security agency has been forced to take the braz@@ ili@@ an oil company petro@@ b@@ as to take over the role of american oil companies are a cause for concern , including google and y@@ a@@ ho@@ o .
the bar@@ re@@ l of the f@@ ence brought the rev@@ el@@ ation that chancell@@ or ang@@ ela mer@@ kel ’ s phone was wan@@ ting , perhaps for ten years .
if the most powerful person in europe is targeted , it is the people who are most certainly the most powerful .
snow@@ den has the inten@@ sity of cooperation between us intelligence and companies transparent and has made it clear .
i believe that it is con@@ cei@@ vable that this data could be used for mutual benefit .
“ germany must wake up ” , explains oli@@ ver green , president of the bit@@ mi , who is a small and medium-sized it company in germany .
german companies believe that the us now has an almost as great risk as china , if it is about industrial es@@ pi@@ on@@ age and data the@@ ft .
in the areas covered by snow@@ den , the european union has had a very bad record of being able to take the operational secre@@ ts of foreign companies seriously .
politicians have expressed concern that the eu is not going to be able to implement certain it and internet options and that they are increasing their dependence on the us .
companies are not s@@ cep@@ tical about this .
in the bun@@ de@@ sta@@ g , it was proposed that we should build a german google .
i can only turn my eyes and see them slowly again ...
“ that is not how it works , ” says h@@ as@@ so pl@@ att@@ ner , chairman of the german software company sap .
if you want a strong european it industry , you have to have a strong european it industry 20 years ago .
all in germany is subsid@@ ised , but the government is subsid@@ ised by the coal industry , by cars and by agriculture .
all until the last it industry .
however , reach and technical rat@@ ings are not the only way to achieve the goals set by snow@@ den rev@@ el@@ ations .
at cl@@ oud compu@@ ting , a large change is taking place because european business leaders are now more aware of the fact that in the us stored data of the legal coun@@ sel there are subject and therefore potentially end@@ ange@@ red .
according to a study conducted by cl@@ oud security alliance , the world ’ s trading organization , the us government has promised to re@@ pay the debt burden on its own people .
j@@ im sn@@ ab@@ e , depu@@ ty chairman of the board of directors of sap , says : “ we see a new question from customers who are not able to answer it a year ago – she says : where will my data be stored and can guarantee it , ” .
many german corporate leaders believe that the eu ’ s recent reports simply confirm what they call “ a new era ” anyway .
the fact that economic es@@ pi@@ on@@ age is taking place is no surprise .
that was always the case .
“ it was many years a topic and has evol@@ ved through the current discussion .
americans are sp@@ ying us on commercial grounds and in industrial terms .
the management of the company usually does not bo@@ ast about the counter@@ measures taken .
in large companies , employees have long been born .
ul@@ rich h@@ ack@@ en@@ ber@@ k , ceo of auto@@ her@@ ste@@ ller au@@ di , says that since years there has been a standard practice , a pre@@ dec@@ essor of the executive board , ga@@ thering mobile phones to discuss them as a stop@@ ping device .
the german b@@ v@@ t is advis@@ ing managers to make simple prepa@@ id hand@@ sets .
the prepa@@ id card is a standard way to get your mobile phone back .
there is , however , a concern that small and medium-sized enterprises are vulnerable to hat@@ red and corruption .
in germany , many of these companies are global market leaders in their respective nic@@ he .
“ small and medium-sized enterprises often lack the experience , the staff and the financial resources to be able to effectively combat un@@ authorized access to business secre@@ ts ” , explains the bb@@ c .
the us war@@ ns its own firms of economic es@@ pi@@ on@@ age by other countries .
according to washington post , in the us national intelligence institute , the number of people who are victims of terrorism was estimated to be at about two per cent behind china in february .

parents of a te@@ en@@ ager from geor@@ gia , who was born at tragic accident , were not allowed to believe in murder .
parents of the te@@ en@@ ager , whose body is found in a cr@@ amp@@ ed r@@ ing@@ er@@ m@@ at in the tur@@ n@@ hall of his high school , are the most convinced that their son was mur@@ dered , explained the an@@ wal@@ t of the family .
k@@ end@@ ric@@ k jo@@ hn@@ son from val@@ do@@ sta in the us state of georgia was born on january 11 in a u@@ pro@@ ar .
the committee of inquiry &apos;s officials have been working on the matter and i hope that the commission will take the necessary steps to ensure that the situation is not deterior@@ ated .
“ they are convinced that the company ’ s son was mur@@ dered , ” explained ben@@ jam@@ in cr@@ um@@ p , the law@@ yer of ken@@ ne@@ th and jac@@ qu@@ el@@ y@@ n jo@@ hn@@ son .
they would never have believed that he was so died .
“ they are of the opinion that each logic is free to create a “ new ” law against the laws of physi@@ cs and against common sense .
instead , they are convinced that the truth will be sh@@ rou@@ ded in order to protect the person or person responsible for the death of their son .
“ your son went to study in school and came to the cor@@ pse of the body , ” comm@@ ented .
us prosecu@@ tor michael mo@@ ore said on thursday that there will be a formal investigation into the death of jo@@ hn@@ son .
what was the cause of death ?
is his death due to a crime ?
the declared mo@@ ore at a press conference on thursday afternoon was .
i follow the facts , in which direction you are heading .
my aim is to make the truth known .
“ i represent the view that the most important thing is that there is a sufficient basis for formal investigation , ” he said .
mo@@ ore explained to re@@ porters that the initial response to the au@@ top@@ sy was that the “ jo@@ hn@@ son ” was not interested in the consequences of a “ posi@@ tion@@ -based suff@@ oc@@ ation . ”
a second au@@ top@@ sy , however , has another cause of death , such as mo@@ ore .
“ there is a series of questions that need to be answered or confirmed , ” he said .
mo@@ ore added that the debian project has sufficient evidence to support a criminal investigation .

parents of the te@@ en@@ ager said that they hoped to be able to watch the video rec@@ ord@@ ings of what happened to him .
c@@ dc publish aller@@ g@@ y-@@ related guidelines for schools and other institutions .
on wednesday , the european commission &apos;s cen@@ ter@@ s-@@ for dis@@ e@@ ase control and prevention published a report on the situation of the disease in the united states .
these are the first such directives that we have adopted by the us government .
one in 20 children in the united states has now been aller@@ gic to food .
the spread of food aller@@ gies among children has increased , according to the c@@ dc , by 18 % between 1997 and 2007 .
the guidelines contain information for schools that are not yet registered with the teacher and the staff for food aller@@ gies .
it will also be recommended that schools use ep@@ in@@ ep@@ hr@@ in in stock – the auto@@ -@@ in@@ ject is used to treat ep@@ ip@@ en .
the legisl@@ ators in the states have recently adopted the rules that will allow schools to use ep@@ in@@ ep@@ hr@@ in more easily .
the report also calls for a list of typical symp@@ t@@ oms that are caused by children who have a aller@@ gic reaction .
children may say , “ it feels like a child , ” but it is not .
parents of inter@@ sexual children can “ sex@@ ually im@@ pa@@ ired ” by choosing “ sex in@@ defin@@ ite ” .
germany is the first european nation to have a third nuclear gender .
new@@ born children are not born any more rigi@@ d male or female .
after the new law , parents do not have to pay for sex for such children , but can “ be in@@ defin@@ ite ” or “ un@@ defined ” on the birth certificate .
the aim of the law is to limit the pressure of parents to allow them to avoid rus@@ hing decisions in relation to operational matters for a gender perspective .
an inter@@ sexual person said , according to bb@@ c years later , “ i am neither man nor woman . ”
i maintain that pat@@ ch@@ work , which is being used by doctors , is being mu@@ ti@@ lated and full of sc@@ ars .
it is estimated that one in 2@@ ,000 children in europe die either as young or as girls every year .
they are among the inter@@ sexual , one group that is suffering the diagno@@ sis of “ sexual difference ” .
val@@ ais sim@@ son was perhaps inter@@ sexual , but he was not able to speak .
understanding the gender dimension of the work is still not very good .
the new york psy@@ chi@@ at@@ ris@@ t dr. j@@ ack dres@@ cher , who speci@@ ali@@ zes in the problem of gender identification , said that the new german law “ k@@ ling@@ e after good cause ” .
inter@@ sexual children are a moral problem .
&quot; some people have life@@ -@@ threat@@ ening ill@@ nesses that have a sur@@ g@@ ical influence on their condition , but for the majority of children , this does not apply , &quot; he said .
you can use a gender as@@ sign@@ ment without sur@@ gery and then wait for the results to develop .
the scientific data on how a child is able to develop his or her gender identity is not very accurate .
no one knows why it is happening .
it is like the secret that why people are hom@@ os@@ ex@@ ual .
in a report to the european commission from 2000 , it says that inter@@ sexual violence is a threat to trans@@ sex@@ u@@ als or trans@@ gen@@ ic people .
these characteristics showed a great deal of interest in sub@@ ordin@@ ate sexual characteristics such as mus@@ cle mass , hair , skin bre@@ asts and stat@@ ure , primarily the sexual and emo@@ tional characteristics of the child .
the report also provides an overview of discrimination , discrimination against women and children in the work@@ place , and the discrimination against women in the work@@ place .
not with gender , but with the same level of education , a special cam@@ p now has .
in the meantime , it has become a popular activity in australia and ne@@ pal , but it is also possible to use official documents male , female or “ third sex ” .
in june , austr@@ ali@@ an nor@@ ri@@ e ma@@ y-@@ wel@@ by ( 52 ) was the first “ g@@ end@@ er-@@ free ” person worldwide to be recognized after a court rul@@ ed that li@@ fel@@ ong maintenance of a “ un@@ defined ” gender status .
german pass@@ ports have a valid pass@@ port number and a third one , x for inter@@ sex@@ u@@ ell , so the ministry of the interior .
in neighbouring gu@@ a@@ tem@@ ala , gender issues are still controversial .
in 2011 , du@@ ty-@@ free french members of the strictly catho@@ lic parliament signed a peti@@ tion calling for the “ gender equality theory ” to be included in school books .
the us website cat@@ ho@@ lic online has been dedicated to the german law .
the mother of a new@@ born from mar@@ y@@ land explained to bab@@ y zone that she was going to find it better if bab@@ ies were given a baby at birth .
“ the parent company ” is the only one who has no further restrictions .
children need stability and security .
histor@@ ically , children who were both born with male and female children were treated as victims of the violence .
just ten years ago , the european union ’ s medical system regarded gender as something that could be elimin@@ ated and re@@ built .
but now the ethical and ethical foundations of an operation are in doubt , after it is now known how complex the gender identity is , and that doctors are also wr@@ ong@@ ly able because they are not aware of the impact of the child on growth .
&quot; in the middle of the 20th century , one called it psy@@ chi@@ at@@ ric emergency &quot; , said dres@@ cher .
if such a child was born , then the child was not called to the psy@@ chi@@ at@@ ris@@ t , but to the sur@@ ge@@ ons .
the ruling theory of the treatment of children with un@@ clear and ing@@ ra@@ ined gen@@ it@@ als goes to dr. john money from the jo@@ hn@@ s ho@@ p@@ k@@ ins university , who founded the view that the child ’ s sex is form@@ able .
he formed the term “ gender ” , which means that the gender dimension is not just a matter of social or environmental considerations – as parents have a child .
but in a country under the title “ john / jo@@ an ” , the us government ’ s “ no ” case was identified as controversial .
he called on parents of a young , whose pen@@ is was killed in a food security box .
mon@@ e@@ y-@@ presented this case as a successful example of a re@@ vers@@ al , which he did not . ” , he says , “ it is a sh@@ ame .
when the boy was about 15 , he changed back to the male school of music and married him .
with 38 but he did commit su@@ ici@@ de .
according to dres@@ cher , there are still doctors who have not applied this model .
but in the 1990 ’ s , with the arrival of the internet , sur@@ pl@@ uses of this gender identity were still on the public stage , and the “ un@@ happy with the outcome ” were .
for example , j@@ im bru@@ ce , a 36 year-@@ old author from mon@@ tan@@ a , who was working with x@@ y-@@ male ch@@ ro@@ mo@@ som@@ es , has been twice as conf@@ used gen@@ it@@ als .
the doctors were aware that the problem was not whether they had a big k@@ lit@@ or@@ is or a small pen@@ is and were convinced that he could never become a “ satis@@ fying life ” as a man .
so his external budget has been reduced and the ho@@ ds were soon to be born in 197@@ 6 .
at the age of 12 , he received female hor@@ mon@@ es .
“ i knew that the world was not a girl , ” explained the minister of ab@@ c@@ news@@ .com .
i was unfortunate , but i was not happy .
at the age of 18 he should be a v@@ ag@@ inal plastic .
but , as he de@@ pres@@ ses and knew that he was not doing something , he was conf@@ used with the other .
what he found was a sho@@ cking picture of .
i was asked at my birth to be ster@@ il@@ ised – and no one ever told me .
bru@@ ce was born in the united states and lives in the united states .
after he had learned the truth , he changed his way back to the male identity , and te@@ sto@@ ster@@ on-@@ injec@@ tions and let himself be se@@ ized .
the operation has made it inf@@ er@@ tile .
today , he is fighting for others in an organisation called interface project to help the interface to be accessible to inter@@ sexual people .
but anne ta@@ mar@@ -@@ mat@@ tis , managing director of the company in california , has said that the us is not a member of the legal group .
“ many activi@@ sts are concerned that the german decision to encourage parents to take rapid decisions , ” he said .
we fear that the fav@@ ours inter@@ ference .
we believe that it would be better to leave the male or female to the female sex .
but we still do not know how this law will affect , so we cannot do without spec@@ ulation .
tam@@ ar mat@@ tis said that their organization supports the austr@@ ali@@ an law , because “ it enables adults to use the term “ third sex ” to gain recognition .
“ adults should be able to learn their own decisions about their legal sex . ”
the german law is about the rights of the person who is born .
this is not a battle to which small children can be made to go at this time .
if you have grown up , you can decide yourself about your body .
but dr ar@@ len@@ e bar@@ at@@ z , a bru@@ stra@@ di@@ o@@ log@@ ist from pit@@ ts@@ burg , who has a daughter with a sexual difference , has been arrested and is hundreds of other people in a self-@@ help group .
k@@ ati@@ e , the daughter of bar@@ at@@ z , was born with male children .
because of the recep@@ tor failure of the target cells for te@@ sto@@ ster@@ one , k@@ ati@@ e developed female characteristics .
it has a v@@ ag@@ ina , but no u@@ ter@@ us and no ov@@ aries .
today , k@@ ati@@ e 29 is married and has two children .
although it is inf@@ er@@ tile , it hopes that the adoption of or a s@@ light sur@@ ro@@ gate mother will bring a child .
“ the law gives parents room to make use of it , and so they do not have to make ha@@ sty decisions , ” said bar@@ at@@ z .
it provides you with the time to test various tests and to do things and gives you as much time as you need to “ be male ” or “ female ” .
in this way , everything is fine – you pul@@ l the baby out and love it .
we have a wonderful baby , and enjoy the feeling of having a parent .
and we do not need to rus@@ h into an operation that does not move away .
“ this includes the children in the decision , and elimin@@ ates the fear that they might be re@@ war@@ ding , because they think that their children are not going to do the right thing , ” she explained .
in the end , the child deci@@ des about the sex that is better suited to him – and that is wonderful .
this will make children able to use the internet to decide for themselves .

by now , the commission &apos;s police inspection can only be carried out in a calm , hal@@ lo@@ ween night .
the officials were only appointed twice , and the commission was not able to provide them with any information on the situation .
as the house owners do this in time and the ei@@ er@@ ge@@ est immediately dist@@ ant , the house owner should not have suffered any damage .
furthermore , in the city area , some sy@@ l@@ ve@@ ster@@ b@@ ö@@ ller were ign@@ ited , but also here is no fac@@ tual damage .

actually , wal@@ tr@@ au@@ d ries lives in a dream .
your house is located in a quiet residential area of stutt@@ gart with lots of green , a old tree population , nice rooms and a nice garden .
the city has a few metro stops , and the city is only a few minutes away by public transport .
&quot; you hopefully have no fear of sp@@ id@@ ers ? &quot; , wal@@ tr@@ au@@ d ries as@@ ks and points to a f@@ at sp@@ in@@ ne on the door frame .
i am looking for a new version of apartment for my hus@@ band and me for some time .
but you know that the problem is in the case of stutt@@ gart .
the reason is not a sp@@ in@@ ning pho@@ bia , but a concern to be able to overcome the many sta@@ irs to the house and the apartment at an age that explains why .
moreover , for a men@@ is@@ k@@ us operation , the mit@@ t@@ fif@@ ti@@ er has been suffering from his own body what it means to deal with handic@@ aps .
recently , the first book by her was the &quot; new york times &quot; , a book about &quot; happy living in the age &quot; .
&apos;@@ our apartment is the best example of what happened in old age . &apos; , begins with a warm welcome .
when they were elected to the european parliament over 20 years ago , they were not allowed to stay in the apartment .
today , mid-@@ fif@@ ty , wal@@ tr@@ au@@ d ries thin@@ ks differently about it .
she knows , however , that she is one of the few people who have ever been involved in the subject of &apos; living in old &apos; .
most of them are ob@@ struc@@ ting it as long as it is possible .
the old age is only ever used for the others &apos; , she says sch@@ mun@@ z@@ el@@ nd .
only when the passion for the work is really great will we be concerned .
&apos;@@ then it can also be too late . &apos;
in her book , the interior designers of the hotel presented 17 models for a self-@@ determined living in old age .
&apos;@@ what form of living you choose , however , is always an individual decision &apos; , she explains .
d i e solution give it not for the age .
even if you are looking for reti@@ rement pension in tus@@ c@@ any or brit@@ t@@ any , you will not be sure to consider whether you are also si@@ ck .
and : &apos; without good knowledge of the national language , uni@@ fying the language of the dol@@ ce vit@@ a , &apos; gives the expert authors the chance to find out who they are .
under their models you will find classic support models , which are alternative living forms or which are often quo@@ ted as pen@@ sion@@ ers &apos; association .
at the age of five , everyone has his tic@@ ks and ma@@ k@@ ings and then m@@ ask them .
&apos;@@ for me , such a community of fl@@ ats would be nothing , &apos; she says with a win@@ k .
it is not at all like a student w@@ g with a common bath and a kitchen .
&apos;@@ at age , you just need to take your back rooms &apos; , richard ri@@ es says .
that a senior citizen &apos;s residence is nevertheless able to function is something that the book author wants to avoid .
that must then be done differently .
and sometimes you just want to keep your calm , &apos; believes you .
with this opinion , it is at least in the capital of the country .
&apos;@@ most old people in st@@ um@@ bling blocks want to stay there until they are in their own home &apos; , is also the experience of the@@ res@@ a r@@ ü@@ t@@ ten , the head of civil service life at the age of the capital .
your services are happy to advise people around the topic of &apos; older people &apos; .
that is why older people in particular would often also experience in@@ convenience and restrictions .
there are still many possibilities here today to re@@ construc@@ t the house or apartment without barriers .
he recomm@@ ends that all users who are familiar with the age limit should use the new version of their home or apartment .
today , there are also new and more flexible solutions for the ag@@ e-@@ oriented conversion .
even in the rental apartment i leave the one or other re@@ alization , and if it is only the toilet facilities , then i will clarify the interior design .
but not always can the existing apartment be adapted to the age and therefore accessible .
this experience had to be shared by wal@@ tr@@ au@@ d ries .
while it might be possible to have a sta@@ ir@@ lift inside the apartment , which is also covered with sta@@ irs , it is possible to walk to the apartment door .
it will continue to search until you find the ideal object for yourself and your hus@@ band .

the usa wants to continue to prosecu@@ te snow@@ den .
the us has changed its position on the former us intelligence officer ed@@ ward snow@@ den .
i will continue to be accused of being il@@ legally communic@@ ated information .
therefore , it must be in the us to agree to a criminal procedure , the spo@@ kes@@ man of the us department of foreign affairs , j@@ enni@@ fer p@@ sa@@ ki , in washington .
the recent statements by mr s@@ no@@ w@@ den would not change this either .
previously , the german green politici@@ an , han@@ s-@@ christian str@@ ö@@ be@@ le , had a clear message to the world ’ s leaders after a meeting with snow@@ den in moscow that he should not continue to thre@@ aten him with pun@@ ishment .
p@@ sa@@ ki emphasi@@ zed that it is a process of flu@@ id expression .
intelligence agencies are not ed@@ ward snow , but they are in principle willing to talk to german authorities .
first he wants to improve his situation .
this is what the us has been seeking , and what the n@@ sa ’ s former work@@ er has said in a letter that is not addressed , which han@@ s-@@ christian str@@ ö@@ be@@ le sent to the us on friday after a meeting with snow@@ den .
the letter has been sent to the united states after a stre@@ et@@ -@@ widespread translation :
the competent authorities must be sent to the competent authorities to ensure that the relevant authorities are informed of the results of the relevant investigations .
i was asked to give you a clear answer regarding your mass monitoring inquiry .
i welcome ed@@ ward jo@@ se@@ ph@@ -@@ snow@@ den and i used to be a contrac@@ tor or a direct job as a technical expert in the national security agency .
in my work in these institutions , i have seen systematic and systematic legislative violations of my government , which have forced me to stand up for action .
as a result of the publication of these concerns , i was faced with a serious and persi@@ stent s@@ ore , which forced me to leave my family and my home .
i live in the ex@@ ile and enjoy the best time of the year .
i am encouraged by the re@@ actions of the committee on foreign affairs and the committee on foreign affairs , human rights , common security and defence policy .
citizens around the world and also high officials are being asked - including the united states - to pay attention to the rev@@ el@@ ations about a system of all-@@ en@@ comp@@ ass@@ ing monitoring that does not hold anyone to account .
this sp@@ y policy is not only a source of proposals for new legislation , but also a source of inspiration for the new member states .
the benefits for society from these obtained knowledge are enormous .
although the outcome of my efforts has been demonstr@@ ably positive , my government is not dealing with the issue as a fi@@ ve-@@ year loy@@ alty and is seeking to make political expression crimin@@ alised and prosecu@@ ted .
nevertheless , the truth is not a crime .
i am confident that the commission &apos;s government will continue to work with the international community to put an end to this ab@@ hor@@ rent attitude .
i hope that i , when the difficulties of these humanitarian situations are resolved , will be able to make a commitment to the responsible use of this information .
i am looking forward to a meeting with you in your country , as soon as the situation is clari@@ fied and thank you for your efforts to respect international law , which is a matter of concern to all of us .

report : obama campaign over@@ looked that bi@@ den by hi@@ l@@ ary clin@@ ton is a good way to get the world to work .
the clo@@ s@@ est advis@@ ers of president bar@@ ack obama have , in secret , considered appoin@@ ting vice-president jo@@ e bi@@ den in the 2012 election campaign by h@@ ill@@ ary clin@@ ton .
the rev@@ el@@ ation is the be@@ ac@@ on of the most no@@ table surprise of the long-@@ awa@@ ited work by mark hal@@ per@@ in and john he@@ il@@ mann about the 20@@ 12 election campaign , “ double down : gaza . ”
the times is a mere example of the dem@@ o of the upcoming release .
according to jon@@ a@@ than martin , national political correspon@@ dent , the ti@@ mes , the country ’ s book thoroughly records the history of the efforts of leading campaign and white house staff to promote the cause of the white house .
the potential change was a rigor@@ ous process , and the way in which the campaign was conducted in chi@@ ap@@ as and the east pacific was a secret .
only half a do@@ zen of the en@@ ligh@@ ten@@ ed advis@@ ers of the president – including d@@ ali@@ y , the former leader of obama ’ s campaign , j@@ im mess@@ ina , and the white house ’ s white house ’ s senior advis@@ er , david ax@@ el@@ ro@@ d and w@@ right .
in double room , the room is said to have been left with the head of the effort to bring together bi@@ den despite its “ narrow , personal relationship ” .
in an interview with martin , he confirmed that the european union is a real super@@ power .
“ i expressed a whole series of things that i would like to consider .
we must be aware that the european council president was hor@@ ri@@ fic about the po@@ ll , so i thought we were saying : ‘ for god ’ s sake , what do we do ? ’
while dal@@ y was the &quot; comm@@ and@@ ment of care &quot; , he was said to the other son co@@ op@@ er of c@@ n@@ n , that during the campaign for the re-@@ election of significant effort was carried out to ensure that the results were correct .
“ in campaigns , it is not so much money that is spent on surve@@ ys and focus groups when you are not seriously thinking about something , ” said martin on ac@@ 3@@ 60 .
it is not clear , however , whether obama knew that he would be able to exchange intelligence , but he was not .
martin said that c@@ n@@ n , he thought dal@@ y was a good friend of his then bo@@ ss .
although the commission has stated that it believes that the european union &apos;s president is not aware of the possible change , there was a clear message from the former chief of staff that it was “ possible ” for obama to be aware of it .
martin added that the debian project has a &quot; double down &quot; function .
co@@ op@@ er won@@ dered why debian should be seriously thinking about obama having nothing to learn from the research about how to fix bi@@ den in the elections .
“ possible ” , rep@@ lied martin .
what happens on the way with my email ?
e-mail is actually electronic , but it is not .
was the commission not involved in design@@ ing internet service e-mail , as it is in conventional post , in technical terms ?
in the design of the early internet services , the emphasis was on making communication possible .
that is why the basic technical proto@@ col@@ s did not ensure that a stable system of rules for the consultation was established .
therefore , a conventional method of e-mail is more like an open post@@ card than a se@@ aled letter .
if user &quot; calls &quot; anna &quot; to &quot; ben@@ ni &quot; a mail will be sent , the computers of the two then directly connected ?
the email program or browser of an@@ na sch@@ ick@@ t in the first step to the mail@@ -@@ server of your service provider .
if you are looking for a g@@ mail account , for example , google would be .
this mail server sen@@ ds the contents to the provider .
on the track , the mail can be sent via many other servers on the internet .
ben@@ ni@@ e may then change the content to its provider .
are conventional and un@@ sol@@ ici@@ ted e-@@ ma@@ ils on their way through the network ?
most mac@@ in@@ to@@ sh ma@@ ils are sent several times during the journey .
the provider of the sen@@ der will be able to check whether the sen@@ der &apos;s mail is a mal@@ icious att@@ ach@@ ment .
on the recei@@ ver systems , the recei@@ ver also uses a virus check .
we also check the availability of the service .
have the robo@@ ts not yet done another task ?
for systems such as g@@ mail , the robo@@ t also determin@@ es the information g@@ mail has to place context sensitive messages .
if anna and ben@@ ni are sent by g@@ mail via their forthcoming holiday journey , the google site may provide relevant links to other holiday offers .
read also unknown people who read the em@@ ail@@ s ?
the prob@@ ability that un@@ authorized persons are given a mail is increased .
in theory , however , this is possible .
in companies , administrative tasks often have the possibility of sending electronic mail .
the criminal prosecu@@ tion authorities and secret services have also established legal means of sending e-@@ ma@@ ils or of knowing whether they are .
in addition , there are possible illegal exp@@ ul@@ sions .
is it possible to send e-@@ ma@@ ils against reading ?
with an encry@@ ption after the open@@ p@@ g@@ p standard , an e-mail can be read effectively against reading .
with high technical effort , it is also possible to use the met@@ a data of an e-mail communication , so that not even without further knowledge can be detec@@ ted who is connected to whom .
how important are y@@ a@@ ho@@ o and google on the e-mail market in germany ?
the main private and commercial postal lines are the y@@ a@@ ho@@ o and google , according to a survey by con@@ vi@@ os consulting , which took place in august 2013 , only a minor role .
while the shares of y@@ a@@ ho@@ o mail last fell , the g@@ mail server was able to clearly increase g@@ mail .

first of all , he was responsible for the death of the 8@@ 9-@@ year-@@ old , then he spent more than a year and a half .
now the council of 67 years has to resi@@ gn for fraud , as a spo@@ kes@@ man said on friday .
so the commission hi@@ d the idea of women in a forest in the vicinity of hel@@ m@@ ste@@ dt .
susp@@ ects are not the man who was arrested in may : at that time , he was found to have been arrested for the mother in need of care .
the investigation teams were told that the pen@@ sion@@ ers had lost their mother to spain .
because officials do not know this , they are told that they were not .
the result was that the two were in the process of being in a common flat for more than 15 years and he was last clean .
the 6@@ 7-@@ year-@@ old finally died of his mother , and the mother died .
a patient &apos;s application showed that the police had no evidence of a capital crime .
want to eat ice cre@@ am , which is in the dark ?
a british business@@ man has the first in the dark .
char@@ lie fran@@ ci@@ is made a commitment to flu@@ o@@ res@@ cent properties of sea ec@@ ology .
the idea came to him after he had a research work on qu@@ als .
the ice cre@@ am re@@ acts to the skin when it is consum@@ ed , which makes the ph value in the prote@@ in rise and the light sh@@ ining .
chr@@ is explains that the menu ice is not respon@@ sive to the heat of the mouth .
char@@ lie , founder of the ei@@ scre@@ mec@@ um company “ lic@@ k me i &apos;m deli@@ ght ” , has said : “ the product is incredible , very good , but still in a very early stage of production , and so you get two for two .
the hotel is located in the ic@@ ec@@ re@@ am , with the ton@@ gue at a ne@@ at , neutral ph value .
if the mouth is ta@@ sty , the prote@@ in is rising .
we are dealing with a very important issue in recent months and it seemed to us ideal to be at hal@@ lo@@ ween on the market .
it is probably the most expensive ice cre@@ am that i ever made .
each ball costs me about 14@@ 0@@ p@@ ounds .
but for this , it tas@@ tes delicious .
char@@ lie experim@@ ental music company with headquarters in bri@@ st@@ ol is famous for its excellent music and its excellent service .
but his latest creation is to be even more ambitious .
he says , ‘ i would like to see an invi@@ sible ice cre@@ am ’ .
this is in itself a impossible situation because of the light that is being sh@@ ed by the ice cryst@@ als .
the ice cre@@ am uses the flu@@ o@@ res@@ cent properties of a tor@@ ment that is produced by chinese scientists .
the ts@@ v mor@@ sum is still in the final stages after six days of play .
it is precisely now that the european team is facing a challenge for ing@@ o e@@ h@@ ler &apos;s team tomorrow .
with this game the season begins new for us .
&quot; i hope that we will finally get our head free &quot; , says the e@@ h@@ ler &apos;s behaviour optim@@ istic .
the commission has finally done something about this , with the exception of the long-@@ in@@ ju@@ red h@@ end@@ ri@@ k blo@@ h@@ me .
i also think that , as we have done , there is a temp@@ o game .
therefore , we must increase our error rate .
first and foremost , we must be able to protect ourselves against the threat of terrorism , which has been the main reason for this .
the new version of the new version of the game is now available in english .
the game was of course a house number .
but that is why we are far from the fav@@ ou@@ ri@@ tes , because in the der@@ by everything can happen .
however , p@@ and@@ it@@ z is now seeking to prove in mor@@ sum that he has already started a series .
the first thing that jan@@ -@@ mal@@ te will miss is jo@@ d@@ at .
for this , the a-@@ te@@ en@@ ager jo@@ o@@ st wind@@ swe@@ ß , who is playing with double play rights at the a-@@ youth bun@@ des@@ lig@@ a h@@ c bre@@ men , celebra@@ tes his seas@@ onal de@@ but .
anyone who is in such a game is not hot should be able to stay at home .
hal@@ lo@@ ween 2013 : in figures for the first time in figures , the number of people who have been in the past in figures for the past year in figures for the past year , in figures for the past year , the number of people who have been in the number one in the world is still in the most of the number one in the world .
when i was small , hal@@ lo@@ ween had something to do with magic .
my si@@ ster and i were allowed to s@@ wee@@ ts , eat late , stay up and take care of our neighb@@ our .
today i am more interested in hal@@ lo@@ ween mu@@ ff@@ le .
in recent two years , i have not been prepared to make use of my apartment to s@@ wee@@ p things .
but , according to statistics , i am a black she@@ ep , which is hal@@ lo@@ ween .
the majority of americans – 15@@ 8 million to be precise – are celebr@@ ating the hal@@ lo@@ ween this year and giving a total of 6.@@ 9 billion dollars for southern europe .
one thing i would like to focus on every hal@@ lo@@ ween then after all , are the trends in the game .
the cost@@ umes are made about 1.@@ 2 billion of the 6.@@ 9 billion spent us dollars .
in this year , exciting events are taking place in the city &apos;s last cr@@ y .
women must not be forced to move to sex@@ y clothes any@@ more , they can now be se@@ duc@@ tive food like piz@@ za , ham@@ bur@@ ger or car@@ ro@@ ts .
what men are looking for , i expect a lot of z@@ om@@ b@@ ies thanks to the walking dead , and i bet that the da@@ f@@ t-@@ pun@@ k space series will be a great success this year .
according to google , the most requested information is the &quot; z@@ om@@ bi@@ e &quot; , bat@@ man , pi@@ rates and wit@@ ches .
i susp@@ ect that it is not wrong to go on .
we have already had our dutch dog show last year and we have been very surprised to hear that .
indeed , americans spend $ 3@@ 30 million this year on cost@@ umes of their pe@@ ts , so the n@@ r@@ f .
these are a lot of “ hot dogs ” .
as far as s@@ wee@@ ts are concerned , we are not just a bit ti@@ mid .
americans will be spending $ 1.@@ 9 billion this year to help , the ni@@ el@@ sen company says .
these are about 2@@ 70 million kil@@ o@@ gram@@ s of chocolate , which is lu@@ ck@@ ily , bon@@ bon and rubber .
so good news for the us trade ministry 41 million people , who are living with the s@@ wee@@ ten@@ ed or aci@@ dic word by the neighbor@@ ho@@ ods .
indeed , we will have more than 40 million kil@@ o@@ gram@@ s of chocolate for hal@@ lo@@ ween and , let us not dec@@ ei@@ ve ourselves , eat .
the only thing we do not con@@ sume is to buy sugar .
these are about eur 9 billion of ma@@ ize producers .
it is a myster@@ y that we must not yet resolve .
nothing more belongs to hal@@ lo@@ ween than houses , in which there are sp@@ u@@ ts .
you have done some great names such as “ terror behind us ” , “ the people ” , and “ the people ” .
there are indeed 1,@@ 200 officially recognised sp@@ u@@ k@@ houses in the united states , which provide 500 million dollars to pay for the construction of america ha@@ un@@ ts , and that includes the wonderful world of photos , on which you can find yourself in the city .
but let us finally come to the shor@@ b@@ is .
char@@ lie brown , a young man , made us a lot of familiar with the great cu@@ p@@ boards we were children , and the cutting of a shor@@ ter version is like the decor@@ ating of the christmas tree – something we know from little to little .
fortunately , the “ baby bo@@ om ” began to be a trend only last year .
this year , americans will spend around $ 10@@ 6 million on shor@@ th@@ air , so the us cen@@ sus bureau estimates .
the shor@@ test bis@@ lat@@ er@@ als , which are slowly ro@@ ta@@ ted in the front garden , are pre@@ sum@@ ably from il@@ lin@@ o@@ is , where this year 24@@ 5 million kil@@ o@@ gram@@ s of shor@@ ter cro@@ wn@@ s were har@@ ves@@ ted .

housing is a fire in hel@@ mb@@ re@@ ch@@ ts : rescue forces are bringing in bo@@ il@@ ed cor@@ p@@ ses of cor@@ p@@ ses .
the fire bri@@ g@@ ade had to leave the room late on thursday evening in hel@@ mb@@ re@@ cht .
a three-@@ family house in the district of hof begins in the night for friday fire .
the rescue packages are still in danger of being bur@@ ied in the open house .
b@@ ail@@ outs have helped to save the lives of millions of people in a fire in hel@@ mb@@ re@@ cht .
whether it is a resid@@ ent , a person is still un@@ clear how a speaker of the police in bay@@ re@@ u@@ th said .
in the late thursday evening , i had a meeting at the ground floor of the house .
when the fire bri@@ g@@ ade entered , the soldiers of the fire struck out of a window .
the forces of intervention went into the apartment and found the body in a room .
this and another room is bur@@ ned completely .
the entire ground floor has been damaged .
all other residents were killed during the fire .
the building was not built for the time being .
the exact cause of the fire was initially not clear .
germany ’ s largest national church has an off@@ ensive structure , which is designed to provide a better job for the pa@@ st@@ or ’ s profes@@ sion .
the background is a possible par@@ ish plan , which is that the go@@ spe@@ l lu@@ ther@@ an church of the country han@@ nover resear@@ ches the extent to which the number of its current approximately 1,@@ 800 pa@@ stor@@ alists and pa@@ st@@ ors is increasing .
for young people from today , the profes@@ sion is very attractive and offers good prospects for the future , said pa@@ st@@ or ma@@ this bur@@ fi@@ en ( 43 ) in con@@ vers@@ ation with the ev@@ angel@@ ical press service .
it is attractive to see the working and daily rout@@ ine itself .
with bur@@ fi@@ en , the state church of st. john has for the first time established a pa@@ st@@ or at a full place to ap@@ point young people for the@@ ology studies .
at the moment , fewer and fewer young people are deci@@ ding on the basis of their ab@@ it@@ ur , the@@ ology .
bur@@ fi@@ en is doing this in the process of dec@@ ar@@ mon@@ ization : &quot; god &apos;s voice is quiet , the world is l@@ oud &quot; .
it is important to note that the profes@@ sion is characterised by great freedom and diversity .
i am the master of my calendar and can be my focus there .
pa@@ st@@ ors could be regarded as a pa@@ stor@@ al care@@ tak@@ er very close to the people .
it earned the reputation of being a teacher and could well live on it .
i am sure that free economy will pay more , but that is what the@@ o@@ logi@@ ans would have a safe employ@@ er .
this is a benefit to young people today who are unable to cope with not only their care@@ ers but also their own in@@ dul@@ gence .
according to the national church of the united states , which has three quarters of ni@@ e@@ der@@ s@@ ach@@ sen , around 60 pa@@ st@@ ors are currently reti@@ ring .
at the same time , about 40 gradu@@ ates from a the@@ ology studies are starting to develop their vi@@ k@@ ari@@ at .
in spar@@ sely popu@@ lated periph@@ eral areas such as the res@@ in , em@@ s@@ land and w@@ end@@ land , the situation could become difficult in the future to occup@@ y .
bur@@ fi@@ en wants to study at the university of new york , among others , and to attract prominent students to attend the the@@ ology .
the the@@ ology studies offer you a broad education .
you can even use it to become president of the federal republic .
land ro@@ ver r@@ ally series announced the launch of the new version of the land ro@@ ver r@@ ally series .
in the interior you will find racing seats and six@@ -@@ point sli@@ des .
the options range from enhanced bra@@ king to more flexible service packages , and support for bow@@ ler machines to more flexible and flexible bra@@ king systems .
dre@@ w bow@@ ler , managing director of bo@@ w@@ ler motor@@ sport , explains : “ the r@@ ally championship customers , who are part of bow@@ ler , have decided to change . ”
they are not all experienced racing drivers , but people who are looking for a new experience .
we are pleased to continue along this path in partnership with land ro@@ ver and m@@ sa .
we really enjoyed working with the dem@@ o and the new version of the game .
in addition , there are many other problems with the def@@ en@@ der challenge .

the technical rescue package is a part of the cle@@ ck@@ he@@ at@@ on fire station , which was designed to provide a safe and secure environment for the rescue of rub@@ ys who were then in a hun@@ de@@ box .
and@@ y cla@@ y@@ ton , specialist in technical re@@ hab@@ ilitation , has been working on the basis of the latest technology , saying : “ she was in a dangerous position .
it was in the hands of the ro@@ cks and was 15 meters from the top and the bottom .
they moved no bol@@ dly , while they were rescu@@ ing – they were like sti@@ ff fro@@ gs .
but now we are going to do it well .
it then adopted a few dog owners , who were not allowed to leave the dog .
that was a rather unusual step .
the fact that the h@@ ound is discovered is a incredible result .
peter la@@ u , specialist in technical re@@ hab@@ ilitation , has been working on the basis of the latest technology , saying : “ ru@@ by had a huge disaster . ”
there was the possibility that they could be seriously in@@ ju@@ red or worse .
ru@@ by was used as a veter@@ inary sur@@ ge@@ on , but it was not used in any other way than exhaus@@ tion and de@@ hy@@ dr@@ ation .
bec@@ ky hall , from h@@ ali@@ fax , west yor@@ k@@ sh@@ ire , said : “ at the rescue of zu@@ l &apos;@@ e@@ z@@ ra , it was fri@@ ghten@@ ing . ”
i could not believe that the commission really was up there .
it was wonderful to see you back in the poor .
animal doctor explained that if the detection of the de@@ ple@@ tion has become too great and had broken down , it would probably have cr@@ ash@@ ed .
the fire bri@@ g@@ ades have done a great job .
it was really cour@@ ageous what you did .
we are simply so grateful and each of you was absolutely incredible .
scot@@ t al@@ der@@ son from k@@ ei@@ gh@@ ley added that the debian project is currently in a state of fear of falling down , but she remained at the top .
the fire bri@@ g@@ ades were great .
i can hardly believe where they were .
mic@@ k j@@ ag@@ ger explains that he has been using k@@ ay per@@ ry as her eigh@@ teen .
in an interview with a austr@@ ali@@ an radio station this week , the pop star said that she had a back@@ ground record in the uk as a back@@ ground sing@@ er .
per@@ ry explained that she had been working with the al@@ tro@@ ck@@ er to evening , and that “ he asked me to sit down when i was 18 ” .
they added that the “ the only way to achieve this is to have a good time ” .
in a statement , a representative of hun@@ ters said , 70 , on thursday , that he said ‘ categ@@ or@@ ically ‘ no ’ that he had ever attemp@@ ted to bring kat@@ y per@@ ry closer to him ’ .
the representative added : “ perhaps the commission has taken him with someone else , but i am not sure whether he will . ”

george ker@@ ev@@ an : european enthusiasm for the creation of a european union is a choice for the sco@@ ts .
a new day , a new terrible story for independence .
this time we will be war@@ ned that a more independent scotland would be needed .
this provides the sample of the history of the pass@@ port controls in ber@@ w@@ ick and a list of the most important documents of the german state .
in fact , in the str@@ at@@ care world , the report refers to the potential economic benefits that could be gained by more freedom of movement in the rest of europe , but this did not , as expected , play into the head@@ lines .
the fact that the commission has not yet agreed on a common position on the subject is also something that nobody has mentioned .
as scotland is currently not part of the schengen area , it would be a serious mistake to continue to ignore brussels .
so really no story .
and one that has been in the years already , and that is that you have already been gli@@ ding like a fo@@ ssi@@ l : for the first time i have seen the “ independence means pass@@ port controls ” duc@@ k at least 40 years ago .
this is an interesting point in the constant repe@@ ti@@ tion of this ancient story .
why not talk about an independent scotland ?
why the london agreement ?
these are the real european news .
with the euro crisis , the european project has officially died .
across the eu , parties are gaining ground , eu enem@@ ies are or are threat@@ ening the euro as a common currency .
even in germany , the euro@@ s@@ cep@@ tic party could support alternative for germany – only this year – bare@@ ly five million votes at the bun@@ de@@ sta@@ g election in september .
there have always been domestic resistance to the plan , a federal europe , which is based on the principle of subsidiarity .
the current economic crisis , however , is turning out to be a turning point .
due to the berlin and the european central bank &apos;s strict monetary policy , the european central bank has been forced to make cuts in the stra@@ it@@ jack@@ et to which the national economy is bound by keeping to the single currency .
the crisis of the euro has little to do with national governments being excessive .
instead , the euro@@ system has been pus@@ hing its members to exchange rates that are too high for german ex@@ porters .
without the possibility of de@@ valu@@ ing local currency , southern europe will find itself with a buil@@ t-@@ in productivity growth dis@@ advantage compared with germany .
the only way to do this is to pay and public spending .
behind the current et@@ at and curren@@ cies problems , there is a deep shift in european productivity .
as a result of the brussels regulation on ‘ green ’ energy taxes , which is a code for subsid@@ ising energy production in france and germany , the eu is now in a position to pay a heavy price compared with the united states .
this is a par@@ aly@@ sing cost dis@@ advantage , as we have already seen in gr@@ ang@@ em@@ ou@@ th .
all wage fix@@ ing by the world protec@@ ts the european petro@@ chemical industry from being hit by cheap american oil .
as a result , a re@@ vol@@ t is rising , especially in france , the former chief er@@ ic of the eu .
after the war , the political elite of france looked at the eu as a vehicle for the eu to take action against germany in a bid to save paris on an equal foot@@ ing with washington .
but berlin needs not be more than a ga@@ te@@ way to political legitimacy , and europe has abandoned its own economic policy , which has under@@ min@@ ed the french economy .
the result : marine le p@@ ens right-@@ wing , anti-@@ sp@@ y@@ ware , anti-@@ european front has just launched a decisive campaign to win the battle for the socialist party .
the national front is now the most popular party in france with 24 % of the elec@@ tor@@ ate – a timely warning for the british labour government .
what makes le pen so special with its newly won popul@@ arity among the white french ?
it wants to support the eu elections next year to set up an anti-@@ eu , anti-@@ community currency blo@@ c in the european parliament .
if anti-@@ eu parties are not represented well in these elections – and that is very good – then they will be able to hold such a blo@@ c for the first time .
this is the point i want to make .
the eu will not dis@@ appear , but it will be more like the “ europe of ( sovereign ) states ” .
germany and a few of its satellite economies may be holding fast to the euro , but france and southern europe will be forced to exchange their own curren@@ cies .
i expect the commission to take a stand on this project in the hope that it will be able to join the united states .
however , washington ’ s growing interest in the pacific region suggests that the us should be alone in the atlantic ocean .
where is scotland ?
we can decide to create a region of ( la@@ tely ) small islands , and to do so with a small england .
or we can put our own economic interests – for which we are also in the mid@@ st of saying what berlin and brussels are capable of doing .
i susp@@ ect that scotland is in a better position to be a lo@@ ser european union .
cooperation with other , similarly con@@ cei@@ vable countries is essential in a non-@@ feder@@ ated europe of nations .
otherwise , we should consider making it easier for norway to do the same and maintaining our economic independence .
the sn@@ p government in scotland has been a great success – remarkable for the last two years .
it would be a great p@@ ity for scotland to be in favour of independence now , just to be able to benefit from berlin and brussels in order to have a policy of au@@ ster@@ ity imposed .
early pu@@ ber@@ ity : faster er@@ up@@ tion of the disease .
a@@ fro@@ -@@ american and h@@ is@@ pan@@ ic girls tend to reach the pu@@ ber@@ ity rather than their white age gen@@ os@@ is , as studies show .
physical changes mean that the body is not directly affected by the pub@@ er@@ ty .
there is no evidence that the european union is using hor@@ mon@@ es or other chemicals .
experts believe that ep@@ ide@@ mic f@@ at is the most common cause of death .
the trend towards early pu@@ ber@@ ity is less pron@@ oun@@ ced in young people , and the fact that they are not so young is less pron@@ oun@@ ced in young people .
the former c@@ n@@ n correspon@@ dent , who was a member of the european parliament , is a journ@@ alist who has focused on child health and family issues .
if a mother is concerned when her daughter is already in the age of seven or eight , she will be bre@@ ast@@ fe@@ eding and sh@@ am@@ ha@@ irs ?
in the annual conference of the nur@@ ser@@ y association american medical association , the children ’ s association of pedi@@ at@@ ric@@ s this week in or@@ lan@@ do , fl@@ ori@@ da , the pa@@ edi@@ at@@ ric en@@ do@@ cr@@ in@@ o@@ log@@ ist dr. paul k@@ ap@@ lo@@ v declared this week .
“ i spend my time in building a new home for parents , ” usually it is not a sign that they are now quickly getting the pu@@ ber@@ y , ” explains the director of k@@ ap@@ lo@@ wit@@ z .
obvious defects in the design , such as the growing bre@@ asts , ch@@ im@@ ne@@ ys and ax@@ le hair and body od@@ ors , show themselves in girls so@@ on@@ er .
however , there was only a s@@ light shift at the age of the men@@ ar@@ che ( oc@@ curren@@ ce of the first reg@@ res@@ sion ) in the last 40 years .
in the united states , the average age of the child is 12.@@ 5 years , a little less than 12.@@ 75 in 197@@ 0 .
“ if the development of bre@@ asts begins , it will take at least two to three years to get to the men@@ ar@@ che ” , said k@@ ap@@ lo@@ wit@@ z , author of the book “ early pub@@ er@@ ty at girls : the essential guide ” .
time is the most exact test , as the buff@@ er is progres@@ sing .
it is controversial that the commission should actually begin to act as a pu@@ tative but it is important to “ early e@@ gg@@ s ” when the bre@@ ast enlargement is accompanied by a growth boost a year ago from an age of eight .
in most cases , the process slow@@ es , and the process is stag@@ n@@ ating – something that a child doctor can monitor closely .
with faster response time , the us could be able to implement tests with en@@ dic@@ ro@@ lled results in a more serious way , such as t@@ um@@ ors or cy@@ sts .
there are treatment methods for dela@@ ying a early men@@ stru@@ ation and the ab@@ w@@ ick@@ ering of another consequence : the early dis@@ appearance of the bone .
the recommendations for a medic@@ inal treatment or hor@@ mon@@ al therapy are based on the principle of age of the child , development speed , age of growth and the emo@@ tional condition of mat@@ ur@@ ity .
psycho@@ social aspects are also important .
k@@ ap@@ lo@@ wit@@ z is cau@@ tious about medic@@ ations , but it is not giving up : “ the sub@@ ju@@ gation of the pub@@ er@@ ty can cause behavi@@ our@@ al problems and the emo@@ tions of girls , unlike their age gen@@ os@@ is . ”
the other major problem is understand@@ able : parents simply do not want their very young dau@@ gh@@ ters to have the period .
“ they worry about the flu@@ c@@ tu@@ ation risk or about the way they treat the hygi@@ ene and hygi@@ ene side , ” said ka@@ p@@ lo@@ wit@@ z .
“ it was a sho@@ ck , ” re@@ members a woman whose daughter , with ten , had to spend their days .
even if there are initial signs and we are talking about men@@ stru@@ ation , it was emo@@ tionally not prepared .
she came fri@@ ghten@@ ingly to the point of being ex@@ ci@@ ted from school , because she had to be the first in her friend circle .
there are many fully published articles , but there are also many more .
but there are no conclu@@ sive evidence that the us is not a hor@@ mon@@ e-@@ producing country in milk or other food , chemicals , and even in food .
young people come to the european union in the same way as girls .
k@@ ap@@ lo@@ wit@@ z believes that the persu@@ a@@ sive pre@@ mise of the “ ep@@ ide@@ mic of fe@@ tal disease ” is that it is the disease that is most convinc@@ ing .
he supported the implementation of a study in 2001 on girls in the age of six to nine years , which established a connection between body f@@ at and entering the pu@@ ber@@ ity .
other studies support this conclusion .
in this country , afric@@ an-@@ american and h@@ is@@ pan@@ ic girls tend to reach pub@@ er@@ ty rather than their white age gen@@ os@@ is .
there are different explanations for this .
glob@@ ally , an early pub@@ er@@ ty of all kinds seems to be influenced by all kinds of things , from economic conditions to climate to gen@@ es .
another myster@@ y is that , although young people have the fac@@ ial and sh@@ am@@ eless hair earlier , they are still more likely to become full-@@ grown .
other doctors on the a@@ a@@ p conference have stressed the complexity of the problem .
the emerg@@ ence of ac@@ ne and sh@@ am@@ ha@@ ar is a problem even in bab@@ ies and inf@@ ants .
“ we must be careful to see how we are going to begin the true beginning of pub@@ er@@ ty , ” said dr. law@@ rence sil@@ ver@@ man , a pa@@ edi@@ at@@ ric en@@ do@@ cr@@ ine o@@ log@@ ist at gor@@ ye@@ b chi@@ l@@ ung .
parents should not hesitate to contact their parents for advice on how to treat their children .
“ this may mean that you can use the same phone so@@ on@@ er than expected , ” said k@@ ap@@ lo@@ wit@@ z .
if you stay calm , the child usually re@@ acts well .
girls who are in@@ ju@@ red early need the insurance to leave the process a normal life .
jum@@ bo@@ -@@ manufacturer stri@@ kes in the face of big orders over seat width and height .
there are no differences between leading aircraft manufacturers .
the dispute is about whether or not to have a seat , the passengers with long flights , in the tourist industry , who are being offered a seat , not always those who are concerned most about making the most of the stated space .
airbus requested a study this week , which will be presented to the industry with a width of at least 46 cm ( 18 in@@ ches ) in the tourist class .
the debate is coming to an end at a time when the aircraft manufacturers are strugg@@ ling to make even greater versions of their two-@@ engine aircraft long-@@ hau@@ l f@@ lies .
as the re@@ ar part of the aircraft is designed , the aircraft will be equipped with a series of nine or ten seats , and will be used to determine the economic results that the new “ mini-@@ j@@ um@@ bo ” system will deliver .
bo@@ eing claims that its modern@@ ised “ 7@@ 77 ” fleet is fa@@ st-@@ 40@@ 6 people at se@@ ated in the tourist class , which has more than 17 in@@ ches wide .
airbus explains that the bank@@ rup@@ t@@ cy version of the a3@@ 50 is carrying 3@@ 50 passengers in 18 in@@ ch wid@@ ths in the tourist industry .
aircraft giant , the largest in the world , often means technical details by means of advertising in the specialist press .
now the company is appe@@ aling to the du@@ ba@@ i air@@ show where the 7@@ 7@@ 7@@ x will be delivered with more than 100 orders .
recently , the company presented an advertis@@ ement that was the beginning of a new advertising war .
“ bo@@ eing is slow to hit , ” says the german ceo , airbus president and ceo , and he is the first to say that bo@@ eing is a long-@@ range commercial partner .
given the change in food hab@@ its , the people will be th@@ ick@@ er , but aircraft seats have not rad@@ ically changed .
between the early 197@@ 0s , when the bo@@ eing 7@@ 47 was the modern lan@@ g@@ str@@ ü@@ ck@@ en@@ re@@ it@@ ung , and the end of the century , the weight of the male average man was between 40 and 49 years by 10 % .
the wa@@ ist range of the male average is about 50 % .
airbus says that its ri@@ vals are still in line with a se@@ ating concept from the 195@@ 0s , when the average body size of the newly driven aircraft was about to exceed the average .
i have said that airbus has carried out studies that show that the number of passengers travelling by air is an additional customs ( 2.@@ 54 cm ) per seat .
bo@@ eing is den@@ ying the figures from airbus , at the same time as saying that it is not in the discre@@ tion of manufacturers to decide how airlines should use the balance between airlines .
the company also decla@@ res , according to studies , that the experience han@@ gs on the aircraft from more than the width of the seat .
“ it really amounts to being able to offer airlines flexibility , so that they can do what they want to do .
you do not want us to dis@@ credit you with what you can make prof@@ itable .
you know your business better than any other .
for passengers , it is about more ell@@ en@@ bo@@ w freedom , but for manufacturers it will increasingly be about a matter that is not just about the tur@@ nover .
behind the dispute lies a race for aircraft manufacturers , with a valu@@ ed volume of at least $ 700 billion after li@@ sting prices in the coming decades , which is reflected in a sustained increase in the us or europe &apos;s export record .
how re@@ u@@ ters , for the first time in july , reported that the layout is the driving force behind the confron@@ tation over the new je@@ ts .
both airbus and the bo@@ eing 7@@ 47 claim that they have more efficiency per seat in their latest two-@@ engine long-@@ hau@@ l aircraft designs than the market leader in this segment .
the statements by bo@@ eing on the results are partly dependent on the fact that the 7@@ 7@@ 7@@ x with its ten seats per row is equipped with the original design of nine seats in the 7@@ 77 .
the increased costs of each unit are always higher than the costs of the current machines with ten seats per row .
“ bo@@ eing qu@@ et@@ sch@@ t therefore has more seats in his aircraft to make it more competitive .
on the other hand , analy@@ sts say full cab@@ ins with ten seats per row at existing 7@@ 7@@ 7@@ s indicate that the majority of passengers would choose the closer approach .
“ eigh@@ teen months of customs ” , the first time i had a flight in the united states , i was in the business for a while , but the reality is that the airbus offer is far from being a threat . ”
airbus and bo@@ eing are offering no seats in the world , but a catalogue of suppliers .
the world travel@@ ers jet sel@@ lers carry even band@@ width .
even if you want to enjoy the comfort , the hotel offers all the manufacturers je@@ ts with high compres@@ sion air conditioning .
airbus offers a a3@@ 50 with ten seat capacity , a fleet of more than 2@@ ,000 aircraft , according to its own statement .
until recently , airbus has stressed that it is important to have more adap@@ tability of cab@@ ins and to have broad seats for some je@@ ts on the cor@@ rid@@ ors .
without the support of the only other manufacturer of great modern jet , experts say that the call for a new industry standard is likely to be squ@@ ee@@ zed out , but the wave of 7@@ 7@@ 7@@ x sales is di@@ str@@ acting .
new anti-@@ nic@@ ot@@ ine vacc@@ ine for the disease could help to escape the pleasure of smoking .
scientists have launched an anti-@@ nic@@ ot@@ ine vacc@@ ine to prevent the spread of cancer .
a single do@@ se of vacc@@ ine is not yet available to m@@ ice for a life@@ time .
before testing on humans , other tests are needed to test the system , which may take some years , but professor ron@@ ald crystal has been awarded the gold cor@@ n@@ ell medical college award in new york .
“ we are very hope@@ ful that the new version of this vacc@@ ination strategy will once again bring millions of smo@@ kers to the streets to stop smoking and thereby protect all the drugs available on the market .
the new vacc@@ ine contains a har@@ sh , vir@@ al inf@@ ection that has been modified to reduce the genetic information needed to produce nic@@ ot@@ ine .
the virus inf@@ ected selec@@ tively the le@@ ver cells , the cells then have a constant stream of anti@@ bodies .
the anti@@ bodies are j@@ am the ni@@ ko@@ tin mo@@ lec@@ ules , in the blood and neutr@@ alize the mo@@ lec@@ ules before they reach the brain .
in experim@@ ents , vacc@@ inated mon@@ ks kept their cat@@ tle and e@@ gg@@ s .
m@@ ice without vacc@@ ination , on the other hand , would have taken a “ break out ” , the researchers said , a sign that the nic@@ ot@@ ine would not reach your brain .
the experim@@ ents are in the science journal of translation studies ( f@@ .@@ i.@@ l@@ .@@ a.
previous tobacco imports from the eu , however , failed because they were anti@@ bodies .
vacc@@ ination is needed to maintain the level of anti@@ bodies in the european union as often as possible , and it is expensive and un@@ practical .
but the cost of the new vacc@@ ine is probably much lower than the cost of the new vacc@@ ine , which trans@@ forms li@@ ver cells into anti@@ bodies .
as professor clin@@ ton said , the european union could be a major source of vacc@@ ine for people who are certainly not aware of children .
more likely , however , is that smo@@ kers would use it to stop .
“ you know then : if you start again to smo@@ ke , you feel a sense of in@@ security because of the nic@@ ot@@ ine vacc@@ ine .
british scientists have said that the results are interesting , but at the same time war@@ ned that further research is needed .
tri@@ po@@ di does not deny that op@@ i@@ des influenced the way they were .
the former minister of labour , mr k@@ ac@@ zy@@ ń@@ ski , from new south africa , has been accused of investig@@ ating the situation of corruption .
former n@@ s@@ w minister be@@ qu@@ ea@@ th@@ ed that the maritime safety regulations were not being applied at the request of his political ment@@ or ed@@ die o@@ be@@ id , who promised to remove the hidden participation in three land areas .
the index family of the deutsche b@@ ör@@ se group is a member of the german association of independent research institu@@ tes ( ic@@ ac ) .
now , because of the acc@@ us@@ ation that tri@@ po@@ di has been taken by o@@ be@@ id &apos;s hidden interest in the land , it has been discovered that tri@@ po@@ di@@ s has been sup@@ plying former depu@@ ty chief of staff ly@@ n@@ ne ash@@ ne ash@@ ne a@@ am@@ ne a@@ am@@ ir .
in years of experience in talks with the chinese authorities , the commission and the european parliament , the government had been waiting for public tend@@ ers for le@@ ased contracts .
the pe@@ d@@ ago@@ gues were opposed to this and wanted to keep them in a longer period .
in 2009 , the le@@ ase contracts for the companies were signed at the circuit qu@@ ay , which is the annual equivalent of 2.5 million dollars .
tri@@ po@@ di , which was held from february 2006 to november 2009 port minister , initially op@@ ted for public tend@@ ers .
but he was st@@ uck , the changes were made at the request of o@@ be@@ id , who , like tri@@ po@@ di , confirmed that he had to wait for a change in the le@@ ase arrangements of the government .
one of the ic@@ ac &apos;s tele@@ ph@@ ony reports was made available in august and september 2007 between o@@ be@@ id , tri@@ po@@ di and ste@@ ve dun@@ n , a senior official who was sent to the port ministry .
“ was this the case in these telephone conver@@ sa@@ tions ?
“ no ” , he rep@@ lied , “ no ” .
i can &apos;t remember how the people who were talking were , but that was definitely not .
definitely not between me and mr o@@ be@@ id .
israeli figh@@ ters are not allowed to attack target in syria .
israeli hun@@ ting aircraft would have been allowed to fly on thursday night in the sy@@ ri@@ an port of lat@@ ak@@ ia , but confirmed a senior government official to fo@@ x news .
the official explained that he had no idea what the goal was , but said that it was at least one .
according to associ@@ ate press , this was a case of a russian s@@ a 12@@ 5-@@ r@@ c@@ vs .

foreign workers with 4@@ 5@@ 7-@@ vis@@ as could be “ genuine te@@ st-@@ ” – and the us would be forced to accept a “ genuine test ” to help them .
the government is thinking in the context of enhanced measures on a “ authentic@@ ity test ” for foreign workers with 4@@ 5@@ 7-@@ visa .
if the test is introduced , it would be possible to have a criteri@@ on that is not to allow the system to be used to cover the occupation of un@@ skilled jobs or to be used as a back door for the access of family and friends to australia .
today , a discussion proposal by the government was published after the previous member of the laboratory commission had been arrested for the death of max@@ ine m@@ ck@@ e@@ w .
“ silent explanations like , ex@@ otic , should go back . ”
histor@@ ically , it was called the “ soft power ” that was protected .
the discussion proposal re@@ vol@@ ves around twelve measures which were once adopted by the former minister for immigration , chr@@ is bow@@ en .
immigration ministers are not only the first to speak in the european parliament , but also the second most important to the european union .
if the “ real ” crisis is not resolved , the “ real ” criteri@@ on could be imposed on someone who is requ@@ est@@ ing a visa to check whether “ the application is valid in cases where the visa is issued ” .
companies could also be obliged to provide an account of the number of 4@@ 57 visa holders in the eu , after the united states and japan have been forced to accept only a small number of workers in the past .

from the british government , a study has been announced which will examine the benefits of the h@@ s@@ 2 rail project for scotland .
in the work of h@@ s@@ 2 ltd , it is proposed to start a new project in the year 20@@ 26 , with the beginning of phase 1 , between scotland and the north of england .
transport minister bar@@ on@@ ess kra@@ mer said that the project “ will bring britain closer together ” .
the scot@@ tish transport minister , ke@@ ith brown , said that he was very pleased to work with the british government on this plan .
phase 1 consists of a new high-@@ speed line line , which connec@@ ts london and the west mid@@ lands .
after comple@@ ting phase 2 , there will be connections to man@@ ch@@ ester and le@@ eds .
in june , the commission &apos;s government correc@@ ted the estimated cost of building the high-@@ speed road between london and nor@@ den@@ g@@ land from eur 3@@ 2.@@ 7 billion to eur 4@@ 2.@@ 6 billion .
the british government , which has been very active in talks with transport scotland , has banned h@@ s@@ 2 ltd from entering into further flights .
this includes the possibility of a travel time of at least three hours or less from gl@@ as@@ go@@ w and ed@@ in@@ burgh to london .
bar@@ on@@ ess k@@ ram@@ er said : “ our goal for h@@ s@@ 2 is a truly national route network , which will bring great britain and its cities closer together . ”
we are going to the next step with h@@ s@@ 2 because there are enormous advantages .
without the support of the european union , we are facing a crisis in capacity in our rail network .
but it is also about lin@@ king 18 british cities , including gl@@ as@@ go@@ w and ed@@ in@@ burgh , which , thanks to h@@ s@@ 2 , are being improved .
the scot@@ tish secretary of state , mr ali@@ sta@@ ir car@@ michael , comm@@ ented : “ today ’ s announcement is good news for scotland . ”
on behalf of the scot@@ tish government , ke@@ ith brown has called on the scot@@ tish government to “ un@@ equi@@ voc@@ ally ” support scot@@ tish involvement in the h@@ s@@ 2 network .
brown said : “ the high speed internet is a great opportunity for people to make use of the potential of huge economic benefits for scotland , but at the same time , the scot@@ tish economy is also an argument for fast rail links throughout the uk . ”
that is why we are pleased to be able to work as a partner of the british government and to discuss the options for a high-@@ speed rail link in scotland , which will bring benefits to everyone and will make the gl@@ as@@ go@@ w ed@@ in@@ burgh link comple@@ mentary .
i am looking forward to the committee of inquiry &apos;s report with the british ministers next year .
rules on electronic equipment in aircraft remain in australia .
austr@@ ali@@ an passengers are required to continue to buy tab@@ lets and smar@@ t@@ phones at the start and lan@@ ding .
the us federal reserve board of directors has decided to re@@ new its us air force aircraft fleet to meet its new requirements , so that passengers can fly on their equipment during critical flight ph@@ ases .
during the great part of the flight , passengers are allowed to do so , but there are many people who find it ir@@ rit@@ ating that they are not allowed to use their e-@@ books when they start and land .
austr@@ ali@@ an companies are watching the decision to contribute to its implementation by the us airlines with a huge amount of work .
the air traffic control agency casa explained that it was going to look at the announcement that it would be taking action , but stressed that the restrictions on the use of electronic equipment in critical flight ph@@ ases in australia still apply .
“ the casa has a lot of specific regulations regarding the use of electronic equipment in the aircraft ” , he said .
the subject is subject to provisions that state that airlines must always maintain safety and provide passengers with the information required by cab@@ in crew .
vir@@ gin has already started to build up a new partnership with casa to expand its wi-fi network of entertainment .
“ we would like to see a review of the authorisation of electronic devices by casa , because we are convinced that this is the customer experience that would improve after we have ( wireless ) installed the new system during the flight .
q@@ ant@@ as explained that they will be able to stay at the current rules until further notice .
“ our current directives provide that the electronic equipment may be used at star@@ t-@@ up and lan@@ ding , and we have no control plans at the moment to change that , ” said the company .
the fa@@ a rules apply to us airlines that operate in the united states .
we are still interested in developments in regulations , which are of benefit to passengers , and we will be aware of the fa@@ a decision and the reasons behind it .
the decision has an impact on us companies depending on the age of the fleet .
you must prove that you have purchased the radio inter@@ ference from mobile devices and that you have the right to use manu@@ als , training materials , hand luggage programmes and customer instruc@@ tion .
“ after a airline has achieved tolerance of its fleet , the company can offer passengers a wide range of services that are port@@ able , easy to use , such as tab@@ lets , e-@@ book read@@ ers and smar@@ t@@ phones in any height ” , said .
in rare cases , when the camera is not in sight , the crew will instruc@@ t the passengers , while the equipment is being turned off .
the group recommended that the commission should be able to use he@@ avi@@ er equipment at star@@ t-@@ up and lan@@ ding safe@@ ly under the seat or in the subjects above the seat .
before the resort you will find a lot of fun and entertainment .

only five minutes before the start of the game , the player &apos;s cap@@ o er@@ k@@ lo@@ ses his po@@ dium - and the hi@@ ther@@ to almost with hands .
finally , i was , as always , the south gallery on the list - and finally here was again as usual the lau@@ gh@@ ing place in the sta@@ dium .
and at the latest when the first european union mini@@ ster@@ ial meeting was held with an@@ p@@ fi@@ ff from the south gallery , the lou@@ dly proc@@ laim@@ ed &quot; der@@ by@@ sie@@ ger stands on &quot; was all over again .
the silence previously was probably a reaction to the events of 11 september .
just before the re@@ vi@@ er@@ der@@ by turn left at f@@ c sch@@ al@@ ke 04 some of the fellow travel@@ ers b@@ v@@ b tra@@ il@@ ers had entered the spec@@ t@@ ators and on the square .

&quot; it will be a great success for the whole ul@@ tr@@ as@@ ound movement &quot; , says the director of b@@ v@@ b bo@@ ss on thursday evening .
as a rapid response , w@@ at@@ z@@ ke prohibited ul@@ tr@@ as from cho@@ re@@ o@@ graphy for the home match against the v@@ f@@ b stutt@@ gart .
&quot; i have banned that , &quot; he said .
the zero tolerance policy is a good example of how to achieve this .
in addition , ul@@ tr@@ as have been given different ways of pun@@ ishing - until tuesday we have the time to look after a crime .
otherwise , if we do not , we will be in a position to achieve the b@@ v@@ b by the end of next week .
&quot; this will be more serious &quot; , he said , &quot; i have to say .
we must be cur@@ ious to see how the re@@ actions on the south gallery will be followed .

the austr@@ ali@@ an government insi@@ sts on the tough conditions imposed by the re@@ b@@ ate package .
federal health minister tan@@ ya p@@ liber@@ se@@ k has announced that the comm@@ on@@ wealth will be the “ un@@ condi@@ tional action ” to stop the disease .
the funding for a period of four years has been increased following consul@@ tations with the independent tas@@ man@@ ian member andre@@ w wil@@ ki@@ e .
“ the government has created an emergency rescue package that will allow the country to recover its natural resources .
the 3@@ 25 mil@@ li@@ on-@@ dollar war is a good example of the need to invest in emergency aid to the poor .
further 2@@ 600 operations are carried out , including or@@ th@@ op@@ a@@ edi@@ c operations and treatments for gre@@ y star .
in addition , there is money for day@@ -@@ clin@@ ics in ho@@ b@@ art and laun@@ ce@@ ston , better after@@ care after sta@@ tionary stays , and the fac@@ h@@ har@@ z@@ bil@@ d@@ ung , services in the area of mental health and the introduction of an electronic health system .
“ these investments comply with the ideas that i have been told about in the clin@@ ic , they are the best way to improve the tas@@ man@@ ian health system , ” said dr. peter fit@@ z@@ ger@@ ald .
the minister was insi@@ sting on strict reporting requirements and on accountability .
the state should be the current financing level .
a three-@@ person group of experts will be set up to ensure that the federal state provides health services as effectively and efficiently as possible .
as wil@@ ki@@ e said today , the 3@@ 25 million dollars would be of little use if “ they are not accompanied by real reforms , which would make the public tas@@ man@@ ian health system more sustainable . ”
nevertheless , i p@@ raised the government for having been able to respond to its request for urgent help , which it had to give to the prime minister at the beginning of may .
“ i am confident that we will be able to make a major contribution to the achievement of public health in the federal state from the sor@@ row list . ”
according to the government of the state , these electoral benefits will largely reflect recent cuts in the budget .
but the health sector spo@@ kes@@ man of the opposition at the federal level , peter du@@ tt@@ on , believes that the current announcement of a new government is only a “ pl@@ aster solution . ”
“ we are therefore able to offer our customers a wide range of products and services , ” says dr. peter sch@@ mid@@ t , chairman of the board of directors of the german research foundation .
it is not acceptable that a government should be able to spend almost half a billion dollars on the system and that the comm@@ on@@ wealth should be given eur 300 million .

syria has not lost its ability to produce chemical weapons .
syria has important institutions for producing weapons of mass destruction and chemical weapons .
also on thursday , the commission announced a sy@@ ri@@ an acti@@ vis@@ t group that more than 1@@ 20@@ ,000 people have been killed since the start of the civil war three years ago .
the announcement of the organization for the prohibi@@ tion of chemical weapons ( op@@ c@@ w ) came one day before the date on the date of the date on the day of the date on the day of the date on the date of the date of the date of the end of the end of the end of the date of the date of the date of the date of the date of the date of the ban .
january 1 - the first american war in iraq is declared a national war .
the conclusion of this process , which is basically the first stage of the destruction , is a major mil@@ est@@ one in an ambitious project .
the destruction of facilities means that syria and lebanon will not be using new chemical weapons .
dam@@ as@@ c@@ us must , however , begin to use the weapons and supplies that exist .
as@@ sump@@ tions suggest that there are about 1@@ ,000 tonnes of chemicals in the country , and that includes sen@@ f@@ gas and the ner@@ vous gas of sar@@ in .
the announcement came to a time when the world bank strugg@@ les in the city of sa@@ fir@@ a were taking place on thursday , experts say that there is a production facility here for chemical weapons and storage facilities .
the activi@@ sts who are going to be working on a network of activi@@ sts in syria to reduce the number of deaths , declared on thursday , 1@@ 20@@ .@@ 2@@ 96 people died .

on 25 july , the un estimated the number of deaths in this conflict since march 2011 to 10@@ 0,000 .
this figure has not been updated .
the conflict has taken up about two million people to fle@@ e the country .
as@@ sad ’ s troops have been fighting for weeks in sa@@ fir@@ a against the re@@ be@@ ls , many of whom have links to al-@@ q@@ a@@ ed@@ a groups .
the observ@@ atory said that it was working on thursday to reduce losses on both sides , but it did not mention any details .
the fighting under@@ sco@@ res the danger posed by the chemical weapons inspec@@ tors .
according to the op@@ c@@ w , which is closely linked to the united nations , the team is “ now convinced that it will all be supported by syria ’ s important production and mix@@ ing / filling facilities . ”
therefore , “ no further inspection plans are currently planned ” .
in the beginning of the week , the inspec@@ tors said they had ordered the first round of inspec@@ tions and 21 out of 23 were in the position of dam@@ as@@ c@@ us .
due to security concerns , the visit of two facilities was not possible , the inspec@@ tors said .
on thursday , the op@@ wc , the two sites were named &quot; sy@@ ri@@ an &quot; , according to sy@@ ri@@ an pro@@ position , and the chemical weapons program objects there were transferred to other organisations named &quot; which were in@@ sp@@ ected . &quot;
it was not immediately clear whether the tri@@ be in sa@@ fir@@ a was one of the two institutions that had the op@@ c@@ w inspec@@ tors not visited .
syria has a plan for the complete destruction of its chemical weapons .

pa@@ te@@ k , who has been in the business for almost ten years as one of the most sou@@ the@@ ast asian people , has been arrested yesterday for his role in building sp@@ ra@@ ying bas@@ kets .
criminal sanctions are likely to be lif@@ ted after 15 years .
the 4@@ 5-@@ year-@@ old was accused of mass murder for which he was accused because of the attack on two night clubs in the popular tourist resort of k@@ ron@@ or .
a deb@@ tor was made in the same series of counter@@ -@@ terrorism attacks .
the prosecu@@ tor &apos;s office had a life@@ time imprison@@ ment , even if it was responsible for the man who was sent@@ enced to death for his reputation as a master bom@@ ber .
the decision has pain@@ ful consequences for the future of young core members .
t@@ ann@@ ins fought with the s@@ word , saying pa@@ te@@ k had become the death sent@@ enced .
i really think he should be in the foot@@ steps of the other gu@@ ys .
&quot; you should protect him from sho@@ oting , &quot; he said .
i must be very happy every day to have no more grand@@ children .
the sar@@ i club was awarded the ground .
peter hu@@ gh@@ es was born in pad@@ dy &apos;s bar , where only 20 seconds earlier a self-@@ mor@@ at@@ ori@@ um was found .
he fell to the ground after the attack for a month .
hu@@ gh@@ es said that pa@@ te@@ k had the same fate as the three other members of the terrorist cell y@@ em@@ a@@ ah islam@@ i@@ ah – am@@ ro@@ z@@ i , mu@@ k@@ hi , and i@@ ma@@ m sam@@ u@@ dr@@ a – who were responsible for their actions .
really , this type should be used above all others .
to make it alive – no , it is not a reason to leave it alive .
20 years to get after he was in 20@@ 2 people .
pa@@ te@@ k is the last of the bal@@ i bom@@ ber who was brought to justice .
it was taken away almost a decade from the arrest , but was eventually released in january 2011 in the pa@@ ki@@ stan@@ i city of ab@@ bot@@ tab@@ ad , where us forces were deplo@@ yed bare@@ ly four months later on al-@@ q@@ a@@ ed@@ a chief o@@ hi@@ d .
during the negotiation , a fat@@ ah leader said that the government would be able to send the message that the government was not committed to the idea of pa@@ te@@ k in pakistan .
“ he has not asked himself , ” cor@@ te@@ en said .
until recently , he did not have a re@@ ward for how much he would have inf@@ lic@@ ted on other people .
the judgment was passed before the ten@@ -@@ year anniversary of the attack in this year , which was marked with comm@@ em@@ or@@ ation cere@@ mon@@ ies in bal@@ i and australia .
“ it will be many t@@ ann@@ ins this year , ” said cor@@ te@@ en .
pa@@ te@@ k can be held in re@@ pro@@ ach against his judgment .
fa@@ a : passengers can now use electronic equipment in aircraft .
air passengers can now travel from the airport to the lan@@ ding via the electronic equipment for reading , working , playing , listening to music and watching films .
but the passengers should not expect the airlines to make these changes immediately .
how quickly it is implemented depends on the number of people involved .
the airlines must be brought to the fa@@ a to prove that aircraft comply with the new directives and that they comply with the flight staff training manu@@ als and the rules governing the sto@@ wage of equipment in accordance with the new rules .
the fa@@ a stated that it has already received information from some airlines that are not in favour of the use of port@@ able electronic equipment on aircraft .
in these airlines , the del@@ ta and je@@ tr@@ o were also included .
“ depending on the state of the plan , we could make the extended use of electronic equipment possible very soon , ” said fa@@ a in a announcement that it would be possible to use it .
at present , passengers must use smar@@ t@@ phones , tab@@ lets and other devices to switch off when the aircraft doors are closed .
you may not use them again until you have completed a height of three kilometres .
when entering the country , the passengers must be informed of the departure time and not be forced to re@@ start before the aircraft is lan@@ ded .
after the new directives , airlines that have aircraft flying electronic dis@@ orders could be exemp@@ t from the obligation to provide passengers with equipment even when they are in the air , even when they are starting , lan@@ ding and rolling .
most new traffic aircraft and other flying aircraft are in service for the use of wi@@ -@@ fi in larger hei@@ ghts .
la@@ ura gl@@ ading , president of the association of professional professionals of flight att@@ end@@ ants , welcomed the changes .
“ if the new regulation is implemented safe@@ ly – and we are working closely with the airline in this regard – both sides will benefit from it , ” comm@@ ented gl@@ ding .
we o@@ we it frank@@ ly to be w@@ ary of being par@@ aly@@ sed in this matter .
yet the internet connections to the surfing , exchange and other e-@@ ma@@ ils , text messages or downloading data have remained under three kilometres .
passengers are requested to provide smar@@ t@@ phones , tab@@ lets , and other devices in the air mode .
so still no “ word ” is available .
and he@@ avi@@ er devices such as lap@@ top@@ s must continue to be sto@@ wed , as there is a risk of in@@ jury here if they are sto@@ len by the cab@@ in .
hand@@ y conver@@ sa@@ tions during flight are also still prohibited .
the regulatory competence for telephone calls is with the federal office of communications ( f@@ p@@ p ) .
fa@@ a highlights the possibility of ban@@ ning certain electronic devices at star@@ t-@@ up and lan@@ ding on the market .
last month mark ro@@ sen@@ ker from the transport security agency said that the transport safety standards agency had been working on the implementation of the directive .
“ mobile phones are really a problem , not just because they potentially are causing dis@@ rup@@ tions to navigation devices , but because we are affected by the f@@ cc , that the transmission from the air is also trans@@ mit@@ ter ma@@ sts . ”
a consulting committee is responsible for the development of the company .
in recent years , the market pressure has increased .
cri@@ tics like the democratic sen@@ ator , cla@@ ire mc@@ ca@@ in , have been calling for the release of the new constitution .
the restrictions are also increasingly serious .
in some studies , the idea is that up to a third of passengers will be able to switch off the device .
the fa@@ a started its activities in 196@@ 6 , and the use of electronic equipment by air passengers was hal@@ ted after reports of dis@@ rup@@ tions to navigation and communication equipment were fil@@ ed by passengers .
new aircraft are much more dependent on electric equipment than on earlier models .
airlines offer passengers a wide range of services for a number of years , when the flight height is reached .
the data transmitted to wi-fi systems is encry@@ p@@ ted and protected by a secure so@@ cket layer ( ss@@ l ) .
the vast majority of the passengers are in favour of the strong@@ est use of electronic equipment after the new directives .
today &apos;s electronic devices give generally much less radio radiation than the conventional ones .
e-@@ reader , for example , only provide minimal radiation , if you use sc@@ roll@@ s .
but when downloading or sending data , the transmission speed is higher .
the most ad@@ voca@@ tes of relaxation of restrictions on the freedom of choice of equipment by passengers are the am@@ ate@@ ur radio stations .
in 2011 , corporate employees invited passengers to fly full of child@@ hood e-@@ reader and made a test flight , to experience problems .
members of the fa@@ a advisory committee are invited to express their mixed feel@@ ings about the outcome of the vote .
dou@@ gl@@ as kid@@ d from the passenger association national association of the air@@ line pacific ( n@@ f@@ c ) said that he thought the distur@@ b@@ ance by the equipment was real , even if the risk was minimal .
other com@@ i@@ tee members said that there is no single reason for this .
the committee of the european parliament recommended that the fa@@ a should not be allowed to carry out any of its activities in the event of an instrument lan@@ ding under poor vi@@ sibility .
a group of the travel industry welcomes the initiative ’ s amendments and called them reasonable .
“ we are pleased that the fa@@ a recogn@@ ises that a pleasant climate of passenger pleasure is not in contradic@@ tion with safety , ” said ro@@ ger do@@ w , ceo of the u.s. tra@@ vel association .
by air , you can reach the city of nor@@ th@@ sea or ger@@ et@@ te@@ ter by air rescue service .
a p@@ our@@ ing p@@ an service to the coast is available to the public .
the water pur@@ i@@ fication was discussed with a helicop@@ ter last month to ab@@ er@@ de@@ en .
col@@ in se@@ d@@ don , head of the centre , said : “ this water r@@ ally was probably a winter mi@@ gr@@ atory bird from northern europe , which was destroyed by the strong win@@ ds above the north sea .
it seems that the council of the de@@ vil was looking for refu@@ ge on the dr@@ ill island .
he added that the “ he could not be further flying , so we were not happy with the request for help . ”
on your release , the water pur@@ i@@ fication was back in shape and healthy .
is europe ’ s elite prepared to do business with britain ?
business for britain was founded in april with the intention of creating the economy at a table that would allow it to be defined by those who are in favour of prosperity and work in britain .
to this end , we have the largest and most comprehensive survey among british econom@@ ists .
you@@ go@@ v be@@ qu@@ ea@@ th@@ ed over 1@@ ,000 execu@@ tives from the economy who had been in about the british size , sectors , and regions .
the results of the survey will surprise many .
we have found that the commission &apos;s vast majority of member states have now been ex@@ ported and ex@@ ported to countries that are modern@@ ising and growing , while the member states in the eu are stag@@ n@@ ating .
you want us to be able to speak out on the government side about new trade links with countries such as china , india and brazil , rather than dealing with the long and ar@@ du@@ ous process that is under@@ mining ob@@ sc@@ ure eu institutions .
in the question of your opinion on certain legally regulated issues – from car@@ tel law to the product legislation – the commission has taken the view that the european union should have control of these key competences in west@@ min@@ ster .
there was general dis@@ satisfaction with the proposal for a single market , as companies say that the costs of the brussels rules have now been out@@ weigh@@ ed by the advantages of being part of europe &apos;s trade area – even 40 % of large companies agreed .
finally , and this probably says most , the commission &apos;s reason@@ ing was that the economic leaders who are responsible for the economic crisis were a clear majority of britain .
this is a recognition that has proved to be a reality for companies of all sizes and leading companies .
it is a question of a great deal – a change in the agreement and better conditions for britain would lead to a change of opinion at 16 % in favour of the survival of the eu in a referendum .
the prime minister should have no doubt : this survey shows that the british economy is lag@@ ging behind its plan for the new negotiations of british conditions for eu membership .
it also shows that the companies are facing a re@@ negotiation of a clear shift in the balance of power back to the united kingdom .
a better def@@ ect for the british economy is possible and in increasing numbers .
the priority must be jobs and growth in the uk , as the result of our survey shows , what a stronger business focus is .
alex@@ e@@ i mill@@ er from ga@@ z@@ pro@@ m is a term for the pipel@@ ine in bulgaria , which is the beginning of a new gas era .
the construction of the sou@@ th-@@ stream pipel@@ ine is scheduled to begin in bulgaria .
“ today ’ s event is a mil@@ est@@ one : the construction of the bulg@@ arian section of the south stream pipel@@ ine is proce@@ eding on a massive scale , the largest and most important project in europe , ” said the chairman of ga@@ z@@ pro@@ m .
the project is a key element in the energy security of the entire european continent .
south stream is to be used to promote greater diversity in russia &apos;s export routes through europe .
a contractual dispute between gaza and the west bank is not a matter for the eu .
mill@@ er said that direct connection to bulgaria , a member of the european union , meant that the european union , associated with transit countries , was not able to “ take off fore@@ ver . ”
bulg@@ arian consumers receive gas from south stream , which is at a dis@@ coun@@ ted rate , when the entire project is put into operation in 20@@ 15 .
according to ga@@ z@@ pro@@ m , the construction work in other sub@@ ordin@@ ate countries is to be based on the planned route at the end of the year .
the pipel@@ ine is built on an annual capacity of 6@@ 2.@@ 3 billion cu@@ b@@ ic metres of natural gas .
for national and international investors , no way is past the german real estate site .
the economic framework data are correct , and the funding opportunities are excellent .
this is the thr@@ ust of the 9@@ th day of the german stock exchange newspaper .
the german real estate markets benefit from the economic strength and the european market &apos;s strong economic conditions .
this is what christian ul@@ br@@ ich , ceo of euro@@ pa , pointed out in the middle east and africa of j@@ ones lan@@ g las@@ al@@ le , at the 9@@ th im@@ mobili@@ en@@ tag of the stock exchange newspaper .
how do you search for german commercial real estate , i show the view on the transaction network and the fact that ul@@ br@@ ich is a real estate agent .
in the first three quarters of this year , it set a record low growth rate compared to the previous year .
in the uk , the plus was only 6 % , in france 19 % .
&quot; real estate investments offer an attractive marketing opportunity for investors &quot; , said ul@@ br@@ ich .
the return value of the investment between real estate and federal bonds is at an histor@@ ically high level .
the fa@@ a is restric@@ ting the freedom of use of electronic equipment in aircraft – including , in some cases , telephone calls – and the right to use electronic equipment .

hearing before the royal assembly
two y@@ m@@ ca employees from new south america and europe work together to develop a new and innovative strategy for the treatment of sexual crimes involving children .
but in the opening statement , before the commission , the y@@ m@@ ca said that it was “ in the organization never with a pre@@ text ” of sexual abuse .
managing director phil@@ li@@ p h@@ are was appointed to a case in which he was appointed a y@@ m@@ ca employee for off@@ ences involving child por@@ no@@ graphy .
har@@ e said ga@@ il fur@@ ness , one of the commission &apos;s assi@@ sting lawyers , that he was being held ho@@ stage by the first case he knew of but the second was not aware of .
it acknowledged that the commission ’ s opening statement was a good one for the commission .
evidence of the commission shows that the commission &apos;s y@@ m@@ ca is about to be established as a model for the second lowest valu@@ ation of four possible in a quality audit of the department .
har@@ re , who was born with 21 at the y@@ m@@ ca , acknowledged that the world ’ s management had “ been interested in down@@ wards ” in the recru@@ it@@ ment of lord .
lord was born in the beginning of the year in the city of london , on account of sexual off@@ ences committed by twelve young people during his two-@@ year career .
he was sent@@ enced to at least six years in prison .
har@@ re str@@ ung , however , stopped that the y@@ m@@ ca was a cultural problem that employees knew about .
the staff said that they had infring@@ ed .
dani@@ el o@@ sk@@ well , whose lec@@ ture@@ r lord k@@ ru@@ g@@ man was asked to attend a children &apos;s protection training , because she was not arrested because of his behaviour , said from what he said that the children &apos;s services were doing .
the managing director explained that he would not accept statements by employees that these would not be tr@@ usted .
instead , as he said , i have rather been following their friend@@ ship with lord for their jud@@ g@@ ement , which is why they should not have reported him .
har@@ re explained that he has written to the board of the y@@ m@@ ca n@@ s@@ w his opinion that the le@@ x@@ icon lessons are not the right lessons for the organization .
har@@ e said that the decision to change the staff to sign secret contracts was a decision that was taken shortly after the acc@@ us@@ ations were made by the chief executive of the children &apos;s services of y@@ m@@ ca , li@@ am wh@@ it@@ ley .
he said that this should prevent contam@@ ination of the evidence .
the y@@ m@@ ca n@@ s@@ w is able to be used in the time when jon@@ a@@ than lord lord was there between 2009 and 2011 .
he explained the need for a “ serious effort to address ” the recru@@ it@@ ment , review , implementation , training , and supervision of the financial sector ’ s staff .
the hearing was held until 20 december .
ton@@ y bla@@ ir stated that he would se@@ ize the opportunity to return as british prime minister – acknowled@@ ging that the british government ’ s com@@ e@@ back is unlikely .
in an interview today , an@@ der@@ son said on the fifth anniversary of his leaving , that he was a member of the 5@@ 9-@@ year-@@ old parliament .
since its re@@ sign@@ ation in june 2007 , following a decade as head of state , bla@@ ir has largely avoided addressing the issue of british politics .
the question of whether he would like to be appointed prime minister is a matter for the council .

ho@@ wel@@ ls told me : “ the whole audience was like electricity , and all have heard him mo@@ is@@ ten and compla@@ ined .
he ran on s@@ ands the entire length of the arena and although he was so tiny , he was still able to get imag@@ in@@ ative work .
f@@ ent@@ on is cra@@ zy for animals – he lo@@ ves horses and is a trac@@ tor and farm .
just as he started , he will be unable to continue working until he is on the “ horse of the year ” show .
a spo@@ kes@@ man for the annual horse show said : “ f@@ ent@@ on is only three , but he knows how to deal with his pon@@ y . ”
together they are a great team .
the jury will apply the fin@@ ent@@ on and to@@ ff@@ ee to determine how well they are .
they respect good cooperation between pon@@ y and leaders – and since they were fun@@ on and tom@@ ess@@ y the best in the ring .
i am sure that the f@@ ent@@ on ’ s sweet clothes will do their bit to make the most of what it was .
chinese newspaper is to be “ re@@ formed ” after call .
a chinese newspaper , which is published on the front page , calls for the release of a re@@ porter who was arrested for de@@ fam@@ ation .
the report drawn up in gu@@ ang@@ z@@ ho@@ u is a new express , which had a rare public appeal for the release of the journ@@ alist chen y@@ ong@@ z@@ ho@@ u .
but chen later gave a speech on television that he was bri@@ bing .
i am now going to use the new express of a “ comprehensive rec@@ ti@@ fication ” , explained the regulatory authority .
the “ rec@@ ti@@ fication ” arrangement is a very good thing for the press and public publications , radio , film and television in gu@@ ang@@ z@@ ho@@ u .
preliminary results for the investigation are available on the basis that the new express , which is part of the y@@ ang@@ chen@@ g ev@@ ing news group , was released between september 2012 and august 2013 .
“ the ed@@ it@@ orial management of the new express was dis@@ or@@ derly , ” said the regulatory authority in a statement .
she said that we have decided to ‘ create an administrative penalty for chen y@@ ong@@ z@@ ho@@ u ’ .
i also have ‘ the y@@ ang@@ chen@@ g e@@ ven@@ ing news group ’ instruc@@ ted to provide a full rec@@ ti@@ fication of the new express and recommended that the relevant persons responsible be informed of the new express and immediately take over the management team of the new .
chen had several articles for the new express .
after he was arrested , he published a report on the situation in the country , which was published in the press .
but then chen entered the state television and gave to him that he was fighting for payment false reports .
“ in this case i have zo@@ om@@ lion estimated that i would have been affected , as did the entire news industry and its ability to win public confidence , ” he explained to the state intelligence service .
i have seen it primarily because i believe that the money and the gl@@ ory of the past .
i realise that the commission has been wrong .

drug abuse is a disease with its own railway between the us and mexico .
one of the most refined and sophisticated tun@@ nels for drug s@@ mu@@ gg@@ ling between the us and mexico , completely equipped with lighting , fix@@ tures and a wide range of electrical rail@@ s .
the us authorities described the 120 times 90 cen@@ time@@ ters of the tunnel as a huge disaster .
the tunnel , which was built in the z@@ ick@@ z@@ ack pattern over a mere six football fields , is a combination of ware@@ houses in the vicinity of ti@@ j@@ ul@@ ana , mexico , and san di@@ e@@ go , usa .
in the area there are countless un@@ spo@@ il@@ t ware@@ houses , which makes it easier to work with drugs .
the tunnel is closed , and the drugs are un@@ detec@@ ted .
in disco@@ vering the tunnel , the two sides were struck by eight and a half tonnes of mari@@ ju@@ ana and 14@@ 8 kil@@ o@@ gram@@ s of co@@ ca@@ ine , according to the court .
three men who , according to the authorities , worked as drivers were arrested for having had and inten@@ ding selling their cars .
they are threatened with a deb@@ it or a prison sentence .
in no@@ gal@@ es , ari@@ z@@ ona , dir@@ ty people set up a vast network of underground networks .
the tunnel is the a@@ e@@ ge@@ an pass@@ age , which has been in existence since 2006 in san di@@ e@@ go .
some of the largest tun@@ nels were built after the mari@@ ju@@ ana har@@ v@@ est in central mexico in october , which significantly reduced the drug car@@ te@@ ls .
in 2010 , authorities took a close 6@@ 40 metres long pass@@ age with rail@@ s that were designed by a kitchen in a residential house in ti@@ ju@@ ana to two ware@@ houses in san di@@ e@@ go .

the ve@@ gan@@ ism is , according to the le@@ xi@@ ka , subject to vege@@ tari@@ an@@ ism , different from this yet in very significant ways .
for while vege@@ tari@@ ans are looking forward to eating food from sa@@ h@@ ne@@ tor@@ te , ice or a vigor@@ ous e@@ dal@@ y , they are facing bad weather .
milk , cheese , milk , milk , eg@@ g , besides the food and meat , the ve@@ gan leaves the ve@@ gan from all consumption of animal products .
what remains , however , one might ask , but when we look at it more closely , the ve@@ gan di@@ et is characterised by a considerable ing@@ en@@ u@@ ity .
&quot; bread orders &quot; are not very popular , &quot; he explains .
also re@@ u@@ ben proc@@ tor visits the store in the cathedral hall .
for 13 years , the native of neu@@ ze@@ al@@ and has lived in ve@@ gan , lam@@ per@@ the@@ im ( almost ) everything is before him .
to celebrate the turn of the century , the next step was taken and i became ve@@ gan .
&quot; the convic@@ tion was not only expressed because of the di@@ et , but also because of the choice of shoes , &quot; says pro@@ c@@ tor , the ordinary leather pre@@ fers normal leather .
he recognized that the only way to achieve this is to have a healthy and healthy lifestyle .
first and foremost , ve@@ gan is an eth@@ ic .
&quot; i do not want animals to be dying for me , &quot; says proc@@ tor the ma@@ xi@@ m of ve@@ g@@ ans who are based on the entire consumption behaviour .
instead of bur@@ gers , sti@@ r@@ ring e@@ gg@@ s or rubber bears , the european union has been working hard to ensure that the ve@@ gan is able to re@@ produce new products quickly and enthusiasm has increased .
&quot; it is a double bonus &quot; , says pro@@ c@@ tor today , &quot; in fact , ve@@ gan does not make up for giving , not taking as@@ c@@ ese , but rather it is en@@ rich@@ ing &quot; .
and it is precisely this condi@@ tionality that has allowed some to be so well inten@@ tioned .
&quot; the ad@@ diction factor is a very important factor , which many people can quickly give up , as in smoking , &quot; he explains .
and if one : &quot; certain tas@@ tes are not at the animal , &quot; he says .
often it is the sp@@ ices or the way of ingredients that make the most of the flav@@ our .
&quot; you can also count on other ways to achieve the same effect , &quot; explains the vege@@ tation of the ve@@ gan .
at a bar@@ bec@@ ue , proc@@ tor , for example , brings au@@ ber@@ gin@@ es , mus@@ h@@ rooms and also some ve@@ gan sa@@ us@@ ages .
it takes care of a balanced , varied and healthy di@@ et , in which it is possible to taste the delicious dishes .
of course , there is a desire to have something between the te@@ eth , that is legitimate .
&quot; it should taste , but it is not .
health damage up to the level of eating dis@@ orders , another common as@@ sumption , he did not suffer .
for me , the change@@ over had a positive aspect .
i do not take any foreign cho@@ le@@ ster@@ ol and i have an increased vit@@ am@@ in content .
there are high-@@ performance machines , which are used in the field of ve@@ gan nutri@@ tion only .
&quot; my blood values are excellent , i invite you to visit me often &quot; , says the author .
especially in the absence of vit@@ am@@ in b@@ 12 , many ve@@ gan sim@@ ulation cryst@@ als war@@ n .
&quot; as animals are fed with feed , i am not going to say that they are fed with feed , but that they are fed in the meat they eat .
for ve@@ g@@ ans , there is also the possibility of using the co@@ en@@ zy@@ me in the form of tab@@ lets .
&quot; my b@@ 12@@ -@@ values are fine &quot; , explains he .
wide paths must be proc@@ tor for the food supply not to go .
basic food is available in all parts of the world and every super@@ market has now produced so@@ ya milk and other products .
all you need is a computer with internet access .
only occa@@ sion@@ ally i buy something specific .
&quot; many people over@@ look the fact that only the finished products are expensive , but so they be@@ have like that &quot; ordinary &quot; products .
in any case , the preparation of vege@@ table f@@ ats is much more beneficial and less time@@ -@@ consum@@ ing , than the usual .
&quot; in the house kitchen there is much to discover with a few small butt@@ ons , you can enjoy good , if not better results in part &quot; , says proc@@ tor .
mar@@ gar@@ ine instead of but@@ ter , a little more ba@@ king pow@@ der and carbon ac@@ id instead of e@@ gg@@ s , with its ve@@ gan che@@ es@@ es , proc@@ tor could also surprise his si@@ ster parents .
family celebra@@ tions give the ve@@ gan a new d@@ ice .
this has dynam@@ ism , if you co@@ ok together , it has a new value .
&quot; the situations that are emerging are not so great that they are different from the people themselves , &quot; says pro@@ c@@ tor .
of course , he has been s@@ cep@@ tical about this .
taste the delicious breakfast and enjoy the delicious food .

the recent incident is a whole series of small inci@@ dents , which are both minor and major , which have been reported by the stock exchange operator .

scientists have been able to sh@@ ed more light on the context in which the sw@@ ing of a dog is related to its mo@@ od .
previous research has shown that the use of happy dogs is not compatible with the tail more than with the other dog ( from the point of view of the dog ) , while ner@@ vous dogs are not allowed to move the left side .
but now scientists say that other dogs are not going to use these sub@@ tle differences and respond to them .
professor geor@@ gi@@ o v@@ all@@ ori , the director of the institute for neu@@ ro@@ logy , has said that the world is not so good .
here we have tried to explain this to us in other species .
he noted that the debian project has a very good reputation for being a good dog , just like the human being .
to learn more about how to use dogs on the side menu , please contact us .
they were the heart rate of the four-@@ leg@@ ged bre@@ e@@ der and analy@@ zed the behavior .
we will probably soon understand why the council has decided to take a look at the one , sometimes in the other direction .
professor v@@ all@@ or@@ ti@@ gar@@ a said : “ we have the hur@@ t films with dogs , but we have a natural or a very healthy version .
if the animals saw that they were being treated like an otherwise prin@@ table dog , they would be able to move the tail to the right ( from the perspective of the we@@ av@@ ing dog ) .
but was the tail tend@@ ency pre@@ domin@@ antly after left ( again out of perspective of the dog , which we@@ del@@ t ) , so the tail rose to a higher level and they saw un@@ rest .
the commission is of the opinion that professor v@@ all@@ or@@ ti@@ gar@@ a communic@@ ates not inten@@ tionally with each other through these movements .
it is , in fact , convinced that the dogs have learned from experience , in which movements they are wor@@ ried and when not .
he said : ‘ if you have met different people with other dogs and you have to we@@ t with the tail into one direction rather with friendly behaviour , you will have to respect the right side a less friendly attitude . ’
the researchers say that the most important findings of hun@@ de@@ owner are the knowledge of dog owners , veter@@ in@@ arians and tra@@ in@@ ers , which helps to better understand the emo@@ tions of their animal .
john br@@ ad@@ sha@@ w , expert on h@@ oun@@ de@@ we@@ ise and hospitality grants , has been involved in the fac@@ ul@@ ty of animal health at the university of bri@@ st@@ ol .
last year , a team of the university of l@@ inc@@ ol@@ n found out that dogs had to head to left to see if they had an aggres@@ sive dog .
in another research work on the university of vi@@ c@@ tori@@ a in canada , the following was the following : “ dogs are more likely to be ro@@ bo@@ -@@ dog when it is , tail ‘ left ’ and not right , rather than re@@ st@@ less .
according to his statement , the differences could therefore result in the fact that the dogs are the animals in the fil@@ ming or the pi@@ pe pi@@ gs in the different studies not being interpreted as dogs .
a study , such as the way dogs are respon@@ sive to real dogs , could help him explain .
“ although there are significant evidence that the us has been m@@ am@@ m@@ als , the two bra@@ ins have been responsible for different purposes , ” he said .
as your behaviour is simply un@@ fol@@ ding , you will be likely to be unable to find out what you are doing .

po@@ pe franc@@ is x@@ i appointed the president of the republic of china in february .
po@@ pe franc@@ is x@@ i &apos;@@ an will be elected for the first time on 22 february to new car@@ din@@ als of the catho@@ lic church , as the v@@ ati@@ can announced on thursday .
car@@ din@@ als are the ran@@ ks of the highest cl@@ er@@ ics in the catho@@ lic church after the po@@ pe and they are the ones who are to hold a po@@ pe , so that franc@@ is ’ s rule is the first group of men .
there are currently 20@@ 1 car@@ din@@ als .
however , a car@@ din@@ al who has an age of 80 can be considered a little more than a po@@ pe .
in a statement in which the message was announced , the commission president told us that the european union would not be able to speak with one voice on the v@@ ati@@ can .
“ po@@ pe franc@@ is ’ s book has decided to make his decision to conven@@ e the consistent story of the february congress in advance .
j@@ ack val@@ ero of cat@@ holi@@ c vo@@ i@@ ces said that the commission &apos;s number of eligible voters was over .
he explained that a po@@ pe appointed a new po@@ pe normally as many car@@ din@@ als as necessary to ensure that the number of voters could be reduced .
the consistency story is a little more than a year ago , because it is the first since the election of fran@@ z@@ is@@ k@@ us in march of this year , so val@@ ero .
at the moment , there is a certain over@@ han@@ g on the part of europe , and especially italy .
“ it will be interesting to see if the new pact is a po@@ pe car@@ din@@ al from the rest of the world .
for@@ ty per cent of ca@@ th@@ ol@@ ics live in south america , but they have only a tiny number of po@@ tat@@ oes .
the car@@ din@@ als are also used for the first to be built since the first car@@ din@@ al of the church founded by fran@@ z@@ is@@ k@@ us .
in the past , the po@@ pe decided to do everything by itself .
“ now fran@@ z@@ is@@ k@@ us has taken these eight car@@ din@@ als , which help him , ” said val@@ er@@ o .
he explained that it is “ good possible ” that franc@@ is ’ s re@@ ign of car@@ din@@ al for advice .
but , so far , we have not been able – all this is new .
val@@ ero said that the typical way to do this is to get the bis@@ ho@@ ps out of big places to car@@ din@@ al , but fran@@ z@@ is@@ c@@ us is “ full of surpris@@ es – we do not know whom to ap@@ point . ”

desper@@ ate hor@@ ror of an obama elec@@ tor@@ ate
i have asked president obama twice in the hope that he will change .
he says that obama has p@@ raised the efforts of the united states to break the dead@@ lock .
the bloc@@ king policy apo@@ log@@ ises not for the site problems of ob@@ am@@ ac@@ are , the dr@@ one attacks , the attacks on the internet , and the in@@ tru@@ sion of the internet .
obama ’ s mem@@ o@@ irs of the election campaign in 2008 are a sad remin@@ der of what happened .
na@@ than@@ i@@ el p@@ . mor@@ r@@ is is a student at the second year of har@@ v@@ ard medical university .
i read at the moment a terrible sad news picture .
it is a book that i have read of , and it would be a great pleasure to read during the dis@@ mal second year of my medical studies .
it is called the aud@@ acity to win .
if i am in the evening with my patients &apos; records and i have to go to bed , then the book brings me back to a time when politics inspi@@ res millions and gave the a@@ ur@@ ora to a speech .
the election was held at a lands@@ li@@ de and news cr@@ ack@@ er , held in@@ ne to re@@ assure the historical significance of this hour .
my class camera and win@@ k before i was happy and my parents collected all the newspapers i read .
a young team of vi@@ sion@@ ary was on the way to the white house and the nation was ready for change .
when , back in 2008 , obama came to power , he had agreed to the value of 82 % .
and then i will close the book .
to switch back to the present is a bad thing .
it is difficult to remember these optim@@ istic times .
in the years since i first started voting , i have been very concerned about the situation .
but it is simply nothing that i would have imag@@ ined .
i recognise the great efforts made by the commission and the various parties that have been made .
i agree that the european union must be more than just a political bloc@@ k@@ ade .
but , having seen countless times the obama administration ’ s counter@@ parts and acqu@@ a@@ int@@ ances , i am not satisfied with my explanations at the end .
i have one point of political des@@ pair .
republic@@ an bloc@@ k@@ ade policy cannot explain that the us is not allowed to inter@@ cep@@ t foreign heads of state .
it is unacceptable that the commission should be able to impose sanctions on the member states , and that the national security agency should be able to provide information on us private life .
it is unacceptable that the eu should not be a member of the un security council , mr an@@ war al-@@ aw@@ la@@ ki , without trial , nor should the public funding and spending limits be exce@@ eded during the presidential elections .
it justi@@ fies the results of a report which calls for the commission to make efforts to improve the situation in the region .
and , most recently , it cannot be the in@@ ability to speak in more than three years since the adoption of the affili@@ ate program .
i do not know if it is that which i would have expected .
whether i am with 18 would have understood that the government work was the same as the political campaigns prece@@ ding it .
obviously , the members &apos; office is not a predic@@ table course , as an opposition party and a ran@@ dom event like the new@@ to@@ w@@ n mass@@ ac@@ re have left public debate .
but if i look at the above examples , i can see that they seem to be largely elected by the government itself .
and that does not bo@@ ther me most .
i have proposed a new obama in 2012 , not because i am concerned about his candi@@ d@@ acy .
mit@@ t ro@@ m@@ ney presented a conf@@ using list of questions that were not sufficiently well understood , but he seemed to be moving in the direction and positions .
i had the impression that a second term for obama , free from pressure from future elections , would make the hope that he would not be disappointed for so long .
but with the fall in the level of approval for obama on below 45 % this week , the return to 2010 is marked by this book all the more severe .
it is a source of hope in me for the many promises that have been made in the air .
this week i read a section in the book that describes how to use obama to fight a severe loss against clin@@ ton in the pre-@@ election in pen@@ n@@ sy@@ l@@ v@@ ania .
in a meeting with the po@@ ll@@ ing agents following the decision , he told his staff that they had to go back to the course and follow the purpose of their case .
“ i want you to be able to reg@@ ain our magic , ” he said .
we must remember that the people we are .
it is five years later , mr pre@@ sid@@ er , and i could give you no more than that .
the measures described in this comment are not necessarily the same as those expressed by na@@ than@@ i@@ el mor@@ r@@ is .
cli@@ ve pal@@ mer claims that prime minister ton@@ y ab@@ bot@@ t has a conflict of interests in paren@@ tal leave .
the bil@@ li@@ on@@ air@@ e and fellow member , cli@@ ve pal@@ mer , says that prime minister ton@@ y ab@@ bot@@ t would be in a conflict of interest in his plans for paren@@ tal leave because his dau@@ gh@@ ters will become pregn@@ ant and could therefore benefit .
the mining mag@@ n@@ at , which is located in a judicial dispute between the two companies , is a very important factor in the fight against climate change .
the pal@@ mer united party ( pal@@ m united ) could vote up to four votes in the sen@@ ate , which are important for deci@@ ding whether the co2 and mining taxes should be abol@@ ished or reduced .
but pal@@ mer claimed that the only ministers who had conflicts of interest were ministers and that the dau@@ gh@@ ters of ab@@ bot@@ t personally would benefit from the laws .
“ he is in a great interest conflict , if it is about paid jobs , ” he said .
two months after the election , the electoral commission pal@@ mer declared that it had won 53 votes after the re@@ count .
pal@@ mer called for a revision of the process of bal@@ lot coun@@ ting so that it could be done more quickly .
ton@@ y ab@@ bot@@ t ’ s dau@@ gh@@ ters fran@@ ces and brid@@ get .
if these elections are held two months after the end of the vote ?
“ we need a better system , ” said he .
why should we not have a system where we can go into the market and get the data into a computer ?
pal@@ mer cri@@ tici@@ zed the use of p@@ enc@@ ils when marking the voting cell .
if you use them because you then want to er@@ ase the results if you want to dis@@ like them ?
today , with p@@ enc@@ ils , it is incredible .
the electoral commission has taken into account the options for electronic voting and has recently adopted a joint legislative proposal with new ze@@ al@@ and .
pal@@ mer , 59 , declared that the number of people who are in the international airport in the sun@@ shine coast was one of his policy , and that he was “ very serious ” about taking his new post .
in a public office , it is about the service of the public .
“ we are not seeking any re@@ ward other than the history , namely that we are in a critical time of this community , ” said he .
r@@ bs suspension is used to stop the exchange of foreign exchange trading and to re@@ fund the exchange rate .
the royal bank of scotland is a private bank with two deal@@ ers in the uk .
some of the world ’ s largest banks , including u@@ bs , bar@@ cla@@ ys , deutsche bank , and r@@ bs , confirmed that they were in contact with the authorities in the global largest financial market investigation , to be conducted every day 5.@@ 3 tr@@ il@@ lion dollars .
the two trad@@ ers would be the first r@@ bs employees to be able to work in the expanding survey .
the bank , which has not made a comment on the suspension , has not confirmed that it has not yet received the information requests from authorities .
“ our investigation into the matter has been continued and we are co@@ operating fully with the f@@ ca and other regulatory authorities , ” said the bank a couple of weeks ago .
last month , the situation ’ s ad@@ vers@@ aries claimed that r@@ bs had not read the records of e-@@ ma@@ ils and inst@@ ant messages sent by and to an earlier re@@ tail@@ er .
this trad@@ er , richard us@@ her , had the r@@ bs 2010 leave and is now to be replaced by its current position as european head of the fore@@ x spot trading at j@@ p@@ mor@@ gan .
ro@@ h@@ an ram@@ ch@@ and@@ ani , head of the european spot trading at ci@@ ti , was born this week .
none of these trad@@ ers have been accused of any mis@@ conduct .
to inst@@ ant mess@@ aging group of us@@ her , we included ban@@ kers at bar@@ cla@@ ys and ci@@ ti@@ group , said the situation was close to people .
u@@ bs announced this week that the new u@@ bs will take steps against some of its employees after the swiss regulatory authority fin@@ ma declared that they had made a alleg@@ ed violation of their privacy policy .
at least six authorities worldwide – the european commission , fin@@ ma , the swiss competition authority – have signed the f@@ ca , the us justice ministry , and the hong kong mon@@ et@@ ary authority .
h@@ s@@ bc , ci@@ ti@@ group , j@@ p@@ mor@@ gan and cre@@ di are registered trademarks of h@@ s@@ bc .
banks are now under@@ going inst@@ ant mess@@ aging and e-@@ ma@@ ils from several years in search of cases of mal@@ practice .
the news about these investigations has been made available to trad@@ ers in one area , which is in the last few years becoming one of the most prof@@ itable of trad@@ ing-@@ units of investment banks .
some ban@@ kers have tried to keep the aff@@ air down and said that they were almost impossible to get the money to cover the vast and highly le@@ th@@ al market .
a leading deal@@ er noted that the company was not able to provide the necessary liqui@@ dity despite the enormous daily volume of foreign exchange trading .
the news came on the same day when cre@@ di was awarded the &quot; blue flag &quot; .
the bank informed pro@@ min@@ ently of the competent authorities and co@@ operates with them .
“ we are sure that the deal@@ er will act alone and that the matter will be contained ” , says the cre@@ ator , ceo of credit su@@ is@@ se .

i would like to draw your attention to the danger of even greater ru@@ ins on the swiss me@@ ado@@ w - should the giant project fail one day .
in talking to many pas@@ ser@@ s-@@ by before the &quot; building site &quot; it became clear that some citizens believe that the re@@ alisation of the project of the city will make many go better , although not a few have the same questions to the dimension of the submitted project .
but they are beginning to re@@ sign , because the city has not yet received these rep@@ lies , it says on the part of the bi .
how to hear was , the effects of public statements on the ombudsman have also been felt .

the compla@@ int against the law was of 26 federal states and the national federal federation of independent states .

egypt is s@@ wor@@ n off the first freely elected president of the republic of egypt with the first freely elected freely elected president of the country .
mo@@ ham@@ med mur@@ si is placing the o@@ ath of office , but his day of tri@@ um@@ ph is unlikely to be the end of political dis@@ agreements in egypt .
islam is a muslim , and the islamic republic of mor@@ si promised a “ new egypt ” when he was first elected freely .
with his in@@ aug@@ ur@@ ation to the supreme constitutional court , mor@@ si was also the first freely elected islam@@ ist president of the arab world and egypt ’ s fifth head of state since the fall of the mon@@ arch@@ y some 60 years ago .
he put the o@@ ath before the 18 in black ro@@ bes , and the re@@ fe@@ ree of the court , which gave his seat on the n@@ ile and was dedicated to an ancient egyp@@ tian temple .
“ we are stri@@ ving for a better future , a new egypt , and a second republic , ” said mor@@ si during the sole@@ m@@ n cere@@ mony that took place live on state television .
“ today , the egyp@@ tian people have laid the foundation for a new life – absolute freedom , a true democracy , and stability , ” said the 60 year-@@ old mur@@ si , a us military officer .
hundreds of soldiers and police officers were guar@@ ding the building , as mur@@ si was shortly after ele@@ ven o ’ clock in a small car con@@ vo@@ y .
only a few hundred sup@@ porters had signed up to the court , to give the new president a chance to express his opinion , and , unlike the presidential pr@@ un@@ k from mu@@ bar@@ ak , the traffic was only tempor@@ arily stopped , so that the new president could be used .
as an un@@ char@@ is@@ matic “ spare wheel ” of the bro@@ ther@@ hood , the country ’ s personal presti@@ ge has been a major factor since its victory and a friday speech , in which it proved not only a candidate for islam@@ ists , but also a candidate .
“ egypt is a civilian , political , and constitutional state today , ” said the president of the republic of egypt , who declared a blue suit with red ti@@ e .
later mur@@ si continued to go to ca@@ iro university , where he began his in@@ aug@@ ural speech .
he was officially arrested by an army band .
the military leader fel@@ d@@ mar@@ sch@@ all hus@@ sein tan@@ ta@@ w@@ i was present .
in his arrival he was att@@ acked by hundreds of people in the largest aud@@ it@@ ori@@ um of the university with ch@@ or@@ ds of “ the army and the people are a hand ” .
the new hotel was built in 19@@ 08 as bas@@ tion of sec@@ ular education .
mor@@ si laid the foundations for a symbo@@ lic o@@ ath on friday , at ta@@ h@@ ir@@ -@@ platz , the birth@@ place of the u@@ pris@@ ing that was ending last year .
but with the removal of the official o@@ ath before the court and not as usual before the parliament , it prev@@ ents the will of the military to do so , indic@@ ating that the power struggle will continue .
mor@@ si ’ s speech at the ta@@ h@@ ir@@ -@@ square was full of dramatic popul@@ ist ge@@ st@@ ures .

nine months after the brut@@ al ra@@ pe and ra@@ pe of women , the 17@@ -@@ year-@@ old girl has been killed in south africa .
this was reported by the sen@@ der sab@@ c .
the victim was later on suffering the consequences of the serious in@@ jur@@ ies .
joh@@ ann@@ es k@@ ana was already in the criminal world at the beginning of the week .
the act had a nation@@ wide hor@@ ror .
the then 2@@ 1-@@ year-@@ old had an@@ ene bo@@ y@@ sen in february in an industrial site in b@@ ord@@ as@@ dor@@ p near cape town .
14 hours fought the doctors and the police for the survival of the victim , but in v@@ ain .
the sight of the young was so hor@@ ri@@ fying that the p@@ am@@ per@@ ing and si@@ sters were not given psycho@@ logical assistance .
k@@ ana had a great deal of influence during the trial , during the tat@@ night with bo@@ ys in a bar .
he acknowledged that the world was be@@ aten and ra@@ pe .
the police were initially surrounded by several crimin@@ als , but they left two susp@@ ects and two were arrested .
the prosecu@@ tor &apos;s office also stressed during the trial that it was convinced that the can@@ a had been in pos@@ session of the att@@ ack@@ er .
ra@@ pe is one of the most widespread crimes in south africa : every year , there are about 64 000 indic@@ ations of sexual violence .
these are almost ten times the amount of money available in germany , but it is still significantly higher than in the united states , with 82 million people .
police and women &apos;s organisations in south africa appreciate the dar@@ k@@ ness in sexual violence , however , to 10-@@ 2@@ 5-@@ fold .

the spec@@ t@@ ator sees that the frag@@ ment@@ ation of the ch@@ ick@@ ens continues to be hand work .
because : black forest sch@@ in@@ ken is tradi@@ tionally without b@@ ones in the shel@@ f .

they thought that travel agencies were part of the past thanks to the internet ?
flight centre seems to be moving towards a more modern approach .
the company has increased its profits for the total year .
the travel company is now moving from a clean@@ ed annual profit before taxes between 3@@ 25 and 3@@ 40 million dollars , compared with the same amount of 30@@ 5 to 3@@ 15 million dollars in its previous forec@@ ast .
if the current target values are achieved , this means a growth of 12 to 17 % in comparison with the record level of 20 % in the previous year .
as managing director gra@@ ham tur@@ ner announced , the company achieved a record level of € 4@@ 8@@ m in the first half of the year and achieved a strong start in the second half , especially in austr@@ ali@@ an and british private business .
“ since the beginning of the year our ten countries have been prof@@ itable and some of them are in good ste@@ ad towards record year income before interest and taxes , ” he explained .
these include australia and the united kingdom , which are typically among our strong@@ est ear@@ nings partners .
in australia , the leisure industry has been in a good state of recovery in the second half of the year , which is a slightly weak@@ er business travel market .
similarly good was the case for the leisure business of flight centre in the uk , while here too the business customers spend less .
the us business reco@@ vered from the seas@@ onal decline in the us market for the first half , so that the third year in a row was a gain for the full year .

in a separate initiative , o@@ f@@ qu@@ al , the supervisory authority for aud@@ its , will be re@@ organis@@ ing the g@@ c@@ se structures , including a new named ben@@ o@@ tation system and less exchange rate work .
in a speech in the summer , minister of education michael go@@ ve said that there was “ broad consensus that we should improve our audit system , in order to restore public confidence ” , with the emphasis on the need to reform g@@ c@@ ses .
studies show that in english schools fewer time is spent on mathem@@ a@@ tics .
on the other hand , austr@@ ali@@ an schools te@@ ach an average of 14@@ 3 hours a year and students in sing@@ apor@@ e receive 13@@ 8 hours .
while it will not be a formal requirement , in the timetable , to spend more time on mathem@@ a@@ tics , it is clear from a coalition of friends that the commission &apos;s comprehensive mathem@@ a@@ tics examination , combined with greater wei@@ ght@@ ings , will be carried out .
in the cur@@ ricul@@ um , more attention is paid to “ problems from the right life ” , including financial mathem@@ a@@ tics .

with this also ro@@ land b@@ aller@@ ste@@ dt , who already has two german championship tit@@ les in the du@@ ath@@ l@@ on , is the winner .
after 45 km and 9@@ 00 meters of al@@ titude , the road was pav@@ ed and the road was pav@@ ed .
pan@@ ger@@ l ra@@ ste as the first to go through the finish line .
only a second thought was given to the rou@@ ting of the b@@ aller@@ ste@@ dt to the second place in the overall ran@@ king .
at the same time , her@@ mann and war@@ th@@ mann joined the overall ran@@ king .
in the women &apos;s ran@@ king , christian co@@ h@@ s@@ mann was the fas@@ test in the main race .
the second place was won by are@@ ane bl@@ er@@ sch from bin@@ dings before na@@ ta@@ sch@@ a wer@@ ner .
sport@@ sm@@ en and help@@ ers were very satisfied with the smooth running of the event .
on the way through mu@@ d , rivers and jun@@ g@@ les for free medical care .
dr. geor@@ ges b@@ wel@@ le brings free medical assistance to remote villages and towns in camer@@ o@@ on .
b@@ wel@@ le and his team spend almost every weekend with hundreds of patients .
the west african country has a population of not many doctors , but only one in five thousand people .
do you agree here or with your mobile device ?
dr. geor@@ ges b@@ wel@@ le is one of the top 10 of the “ c@@ n@@ n her@@ oes of 2013 ” .
you can choose for him or any of the other her@@ oes in the top 10 to make him the “ c@@ n@@ n her@@ o of the year ” .
the winner will receive 2@@ 50@@ ,000 dollars to continue his extraordinary work .
21 years ago , geor@@ ges b@@ wel@@ le saw how his si@@ ck father was always to raise awareness .
j@@ ame@@ f b@@ wel@@ le was born in 198@@ 1 in the united states in an accident involving a car accident .
first he had only broken a broken arm , then he was formed .
“ there was no neu@@ ro@@ sur@@ gery , but there was no neu@@ ro@@ sur@@ gery in camer@@ o@@ on . ” says geor@@ ges b@@ wel@@ le .
we would have had him removed from camer@@ o@@ on if we had had the money .
instead , he spent b@@ wave years in his father &apos;s over@@ crow@@ ded clinical tri@@ als and hospit@@ als , and was a member of the family .
“ it is not easy , ” comm@@ ented b@@ wel@@ le .
you can reach the hotel at 5 a.m.
there are many patients .
some people even die because they are having to wait .
the situation has hardly changed , since bse was first mentioned by b@@ well &apos;s father in 2002 .
in camer@@ o@@ on , there is only one doctor for every 5@@ ,000 people , according to the world health organization .
on the other hand , the relationship in the united states is between a doctor and 4@@ 13 people .
but even if there is a doctor for you , you may be more likely to be able to afford the visit .
two out of five people live in the country below the poverty line and almost three quarters of the health expenditure in the country is private .
“ the only problem we have is that you have poverty , ” says b@@ wel@@ le .
and poverty makes it impossible to achieve the survival of life .
his father and so many of his comp@@ at@@ ri@@ ots suffered in b@@ wel@@ le the decision to leave something to do about it .
dr. geor@@ ges b@@ wel@@ le and his volunte@@ er team have worked together 700 free operations last year .
he was a doctor and works as a v@@ as@@ cu@@ lar sur@@ ge@@ on in central hospital in y@@ a@@ oun@@ d@@ é .
he also founded a non-@@ profit organization , called as@@ co@@ vi@@ me , which is involved in the rural areas at week@@ ends and which provides free medical care .
since 2008 , he and his volunte@@ ers have contributed almost 3@@ 2@@ ,000 people .
almost every friday , the council and the commission are constra@@ ining themselves by up to 30 people and are driving with the s@@ len@@ der medical equipment on the roof over un@@ pav@@ ed ter@@ rain into the villages , which need help .
not always the whole process is smooth .
more than once , they have had to replace the vehicles with rivers and mu@@ d .
but if you arrive , you will be like her@@ oes : a fe@@ ast for the soul , a sing@@ ing and a dance and the best accommodation that the place has to offer .
in these villages , free medical care is really a reason to celebrate and b@@ wel@@ le – with its wide sm@@ ile and its limit@@ less energy – is gl@@ adly at the happy hour .
the next morning the team starts with the investigation of hundreds of people who have been diagno@@ sed .
“ pro ride we treat 500 people ” , says b@@ wel@@ le .
they come from a circle of 60 kilometres and they come to the village – and this on foot .
each of these weekend clin@@ ics offers medical care in a number of areas .
many people will be sent@@ enced to death for mal@@ aria , tu@@ ber@@ cu@@ lo@@ sis , mal@@ nutri@@ tion , di@@ abe@@ tes , par@@ a@@ sites and sex@@ ually transmitted diseases .
others are getting cr@@ ut@@ ches , g@@ ho@@ stly gl@@ asses or free birth certific@@ ates – a document that is not required for school to be a school , but which many poor families simply cannot afford .
in the evening , the team carri@@ es out simple operations with local an@@ es@@ the@@ sia .
the operations are usually performed in a school , the town hall or a flat .
the lighting for the o@@ p and the dec@@ k is very small .
it is a stren@@ u@@ ous adventure , but the people of the village are usually helping to get the team motivated .
“ they dr@@ um@@ med the whole night so we could wake up and see our work continue , ” says b@@ wel@@ le .
on sunday the team will then go back to the city , ti@@ red , but proud of the work done .
the group – a mix@@ ture of camer@@ o@@ on doctors and foreign medical students – has , last year , carried out 700 free operations and knows that they are working to make a huge difference for the people who are denied help .
a man explained that the free operation of a mer@@ ce@@ des@@ -@@ ben@@ z that he received was now able to provide him with his work again .
“ this changes the future of my family , ” said the man .
in addition to the weekly clin@@ ics and his work as sur@@ ge@@ on in the hospital , b@@ wel@@ le also works in private clin@@ ics in y@@ a@@ oun@@ d@@ é at night .
with this second job , we finance 60 % of its non-@@ profit activities , so we b@@ wel@@ le ; the rest come from private don@@ ations .
“ i really do not know when he sle@@ eps , ” says k@@ ati@@ e o &apos;@@ mal@@ ley , who was born in the second year at the dre@@ x@@ el university in phil@@ ade@@ l@@ phi@@ a medicine and fre@@ el@@ ance in b@@ well@@ es .
it is always in hospital or in the hospital , or it is trying to get money for the organisation so that it can go to these campaigns .
for medical and health care professionals , the same applies to o &apos;@@ mal@@ ley , who have been exp@@ elled from the usa and europe and are supporting b@@ wel@@ le , and this is an opportunity to gain practical experience that they would never get at home .
“ we can be very successful in operations , ” said dr. peter sch@@ u@@ mann , head of the department of the department of human medicine , at the university of vienna .
that would be a medical student in america in the second year .
students pay their journey to camer@@ o@@ on usually themselves and often bring the spec@@ t@@ ators ’ health equipment with them .
are you only interested in y@@ a@@ oun@@ da , the b@@ wel@@ le company is offering you accommodation , transport and instruc@@ tion .
“ he is without doubt a her@@ o ” , says o &apos;@@ m@@ alle@@ y .
he is devoted to his life to this organization and his desire to help the camer@@ o@@ on people know no borders .
for b@@ wel@@ le , the almost constant work is not a burden .
others to be happ@@ i@@ er life .
“ i am so happy that i can make this work . ” he said .
and i am thinking of my father .
i hope he sees that he is doing what i am doing .
i am not doing it to re@@ connect people to lau@@ gh and to make the pain worse .

the role of s@@ anti@@ ago , the old man in he@@ min@@ gh@@ way@@ . it is a new &quot; the old man and the sea &quot; .
jan@@ son is himself an old hand in his di@@ et , the ac@@ tress .
the old man s@@ anti@@ ago can not be accused of fishing .
for example , the two are simply great .
they are almost saying that the wr@@ ink@@ les in the nec@@ k of the old man , of whom the fisher@@ man spe@@ aks man@@ olo , can be seen .
if s@@ anti@@ ago m@@ our@@ ns ti@@ red of life on the st@@ om@@ ach , it is the same with jan@@ son .
in addition , the role of old fishermen is by and through a character role , which jan@@ son excell@@ ently me@@ i@@ ster@@ t .
hem@@ ing@@ way is telling me the story of a figh@@ ter , a cour@@ ageous man , who has not given up and ultimately has been driven by his knowledge and also his will to fight the fish .
jan@@ son is a very popular and exclusive artist in many sectors .
it man@@ ages to draw the public &apos;s attention to itself , and to make it more accessible to the public .
his efforts to protect the fish at last to the surface of the water are so e@@ ph@@ emer@@ al that the spec@@ t@@ ators forget that the sea is only made of blue .
director of the film j@@ ens has@@ sel@@ mann lets the old man on the boat in front of the fishing village .
during the course of the performance , he continues to set the active scene in perspective : the s@@ anti@@ ago hu@@ t , the bar of the sing@@ er mari@@ e-@@ lu@@ ise g@@ un@@ st , which is decorated with her songs and her wonderful voice .

if you are visiting cologne , you will not be able to get past the cathedral .
about 15@@ 7 metres , the two to@@ wers rise into the sky and make it the second highest mountain in the world .

ra@@ iner schul@@ ze is an expert in the field of teaching cologne .
meeting point for his guided tours is the service center of cologne tourism directly at the dom .
the tour starts at an un@@ spectacular point .
in the 197@@ 0s , the british and dutch fa@@ thers wanted to build a city that is just fit for the car , and so the remains of the old city wall remained just what was not too big .
most users of the park house are therefore rus@@ hing to the roman roads today .
but if you look more closely you will discover a new dimension in the par@@ k@@ dec@@ k d@@ 2 .
the first of these is the ro@@ cky hill , which is the largest in the world .
&quot; it is the remains of the roman city wall that were built in the second half of the first century after christ .
before it returns back to day@@ light , the school leaves the participants on the top floor of the park a view into a fing@@ er of dar@@ k@@ ness , 15 metres deep .
this is the foun@@ tain of the old cathedral , which unfortunately is hardly per@@ ceived .
nearby station of the tour is the pre@@ tori@@ um , and here you can clim@@ b back down into the deep .
we are witn@@ essing the official seat of the once most powerful man north of the alps .
as regards c@@ ca@@ a , a visitor &apos;s group would like to know .
&quot; the ab@@ bre@@ vi@@ ation stands for &quot; col@@ onia cla@@ u@@ dia ara a@@ gri@@ pp@@ ina &quot; .
and , with pre@@ tori@@ um , it is the former sta@@ tely tower palace , which was built by the king of rome .
from the front room of the exhibition , a tunnel access to the roman se@@ wage channel , which is here on about 120 metres length .
&quot; you can easily make a piece along the so-called clo@@ ac@@ a maxim@@ a , but you can also see the &quot; m@@ un@@ ter@@ t schul@@ ze &quot; guests .
a surprise has been the training .
after atten@@ ding the chec@@ k@@ out , he decided to take the first place in the group at a 16 meter deep , wal@@ k@@ able sha@@ ft .
&quot; we are now able to offer a wide range of products , including the most important ones , &quot; he explains .

the first was and@@ r@@ é g@@ ö@@ tt@@ ingen , who was apparently hun@@ gr@@ y with several cars .
according to the indic@@ tment , it was about re@@ vol@@ ving batt@@ les and a power demonstration .
the two accused were the first to be arrested in early 2012 and the second was released .
a court case has been said at the time that there was no evidence that the court had been able to take part in the bloo@@ dy f@@ eu@@ d .

the federal court of justice lif@@ ted the judgment after the revision of the prosecu@@ tion and pointed it to the re@@ negotiation of the judgment to the regional court .
one of the def@@ end@@ ants is currently being held responsible for another off@@ ence in the open trial .
to launch the project , the focus was on the reconstruction of the processes in the fac@@ ade night .
as a witness , the then determined state of affairs commissioner was loaded .
in the center were mobile phone calls from the def@@ end@@ ants and other people who had been inter@@ cep@@ ted by the police .
it is difficult to imagine that ro@@ ck@@ er will almost always be able to get to a law that is worthy of them - and not to say .
this also applies to the victims .
in the first process , only one of the victims had been pack@@ aged .
prosecu@@ tor ste@@ fan gol@@ fi@@ er of the prosecu@@ tor &apos;s office frankfurt ( or ) said on request that it was since the last trial that new trac@@ es of the alleg@@ ed alleg@@ ed fraud were found .

the night was long , the music l@@ oud and the mo@@ od good , but eventually it goes home .
but the us government has been a little bit more than a year old in the trees of the people on the fron@@ t-@@ passenger and re@@ ar seats .
of course , the one or two cock@@ tail of the same kind or spar@@ k@@ ling wine will be responsible for this .
what is more obvious than to be ch@@ illed for the next drive in ?
i admit that the commission is happy to be here when it comes to late night and late night .
a few p@@ ants , a col@@ a , a bur@@ ger - and then ni@@ x as after home and into bed !
but on the way home , the obvious fears of the us and the rest of the world are becoming apparent .
for what must be missing that you can work with regular updates on your facts and figures ?
above all , at week@@ ends , there are we@@ ir@@ d paper bags on street ed@@ ges and on par@@ k@@ land .
&quot; why ? &quot; , i ask myself .
are people too do@@ of , to make the bags with after home respected ?
it is not just that the european parliament &apos;s paper is the landscape that is being squ@@ ee@@ zed out .
the bags also have traffic facilities such as guide@@ books .
we are not thinking about that , but we are not thinking about the &quot; dispos@@ able society &quot; , probably not even know what this word actually means .
if you are often in the evening , you can get a lot of people in the car , but you know how to get a re@@ ar ben@@ ch after the nights you have been through : clothing , bott@@ les and other waste door .
we would have a few bags more or less also nic@@ ely filled .
i see that the day is coming when we will be giving the people of the cities and communities the opportunity to make a break - and the fa@@ st@@ food cha@@ ins for their t@@ ins are p@@ acking .
obama ’ s withdrawal from the health policy
after intense debate , the president of obama made a back@@ ward step in his frequently repeated , un@@ equi@@ vo@@ cal promise yesterday : “ if your health insurance is popular , you can keep it . ”
after hundreds of thousands of people have been given a right to cancel , the commission war@@ ned that the new government would not be able to make a decision in the last few days .
yesterday , the commission and the council re@@ viewed their original promise .
“ the vast majority of the citizens who live in a functioning hospital insurance system are able to keep them , ” he said in a speech in bo@@ ston .
in response to the numerous media reports on the dis@@ mis@@ s@@ als , obama called on americans who wanted to receive such communications to focus on the free market after a new insurance .
most citizens could thus enjoy better , more comprehensive health insurance for the same price or lower price than pro@@ g@@ no@@ tiz@@ ed .
“ they come to a better offer , ” he said .
the government described it as little surprising that the government has been focusing on the five per cent of the population who have insurance themselves after another collective rate .
“ i want to thank these americans very directly : they have done better , ” said se@@ be@@ lis@@ k at a hearing in the european parliament on energy and trade .
se@@ beli@@ us , the most important city in the world , is the capital of the province of hu@@ ang@@ z@@ ho@@ u , located in the sou@@ the@@ ast of the country .
“ i am as fru@@ stra@@ ted and an@@ gr@@ y as everyone else , ” she said .
i am determined to restore their confidence .

government in jerusal@@ em confir@@ ms attack on sy@@ ri@@ an air base in no way confir@@ ms the existence of the sy@@ ri@@ an air base .
an american head of government , who is anonymous , said that he was not going to give a reply on thursday to the american news channel c@@ n@@ n .
the aim is &apos; missi@@ les and accessories &apos; , and the commission has already taken over the role of the israeli government .
sy@@ ri@@ an and leban@@ ese media , as well as the arab channel al-@@ arab@@ i@@ ya , had previously reported that the base in the port city of lat@@ ak@@ ia was closed at night of wednesday on thursday .
the israeli television channel chan@@ nel 2 showed satellite pictures of the base of the israeli na@@ vy in lat@@ ak@@ ia , where russian defence rad@@ ars were shot in the sh@@ en@@ z@@ hen s-@@ 12@@ 5 and a battery of sa@@ -@@ 3 missi@@ les .
un@@ certain the government of jerusal@@ em has the attack officially not confirmed .
however , the news agency quo@@ tes re@@ u@@ ters a also anonymous report from israel about the situation in gaza .
a spo@@ kes@@ man for the israeli defense ministry said at any rate : &apos; we are not comm@@ enting on these reports &apos; .
the journ@@ alist r@@ on ben@@ -@@ y@@ is@@ ha@@ i emphasi@@ zed in the daily newspaper y@@ ed@@ it@@ h a@@ hr@@ on@@ ot@@ h that the country ’ s sy@@ ri@@ an regime had already , in part , tried to prevent soil air missi@@ les .
the israeli government had repeatedly war@@ ned that the palestinian authority would be in@@ different to any attempt by syria to sup@@ press he@@ z@@ bol@@ lah with chemical or other dangerous weapons .
john ker@@ ry explains in an unprecedented interview that he has been accused of being a victim of the us es@@ pi@@ on@@ age .
john ker@@ ry suggested that he was using an un@@ expected admission that the “ new ” version of the def@@ ensive stance of the us on its surveillance problems could be a way to end the crisis .
the foreign minister also ad@@ mitted that he had no intention of making any progress with bar@@ ack obama , and that he was responsible for insi@@ sting on “ au@@ top@@ il@@ ot ” when the explo@@ sive rev@@ el@@ ations of the wh@@ ist@@ le@@ block were revealed .
the average temperature of the water in the air is below the level of the united states government &apos;s indi@@ gn@@ ation by the diplomatic stor@@ m .
in case of a video call , a speech delivered at the open government conference in london , ker@@ ry said : “ without question , the president and i , as well as others in the government , have learned some things that are almost automatic .
then , he conf@@ essed to the first high level member of the us government that he was the us sp@@ y .
he said : ‘ in some cases , the problem is inadequate .
the president is determined to clarify matters , and is therefore conduc@@ ting a thorough investigation , so that no one can feel that they are ab@@ used .
i assure you that the commission &apos;s rights are fully respected by inno@@ cent people in this process .
ker@@ ry , however , insi@@ sted that the n@@ sa should be a force of good and that its monitoring processes should save many lives .
he added that the “ we have managed to achieve a new world ” , in which people are prepared to face up to the air .
there is a radical extre@@ mis@@ m in the world , which is ob@@ s@@ cu@@ red by people who are killed and in which they are being explo@@ ited .
what would be the case if we were able to do so ?
we have indeed seen aircraft cr@@ ash@@ es , attacks on buildings and the murder of people .
meanwhile , us officials are being asked to travel to europe to address concerns about the alleg@@ ed american es@@ pi@@ on@@ age .
sen@@ ator chr@@ is mur@@ ph@@ y from connec@@ tic@@ ut said that he had already been working with representatives of the european parliament and other people this week and was concerned about their threats to get rid of him because of fru@@ stration over national security checks .
“ it is very important for national security interests to be able to ensure that the europeans are safe in terms of our joint efforts against terrorism .
i also go to europe to see that the european union is not going to be a player in the fight against terrorism , regardless of its an@@ ger over the n@@ sa programmes .
media reports that the ngos are killing millions of phone data in europe are not enough .
other rev@@ el@@ ations ci@@ ted from the s@@ no@@ w@@ den ’ s documents , according to which the n@@ sa had bought the mobile phone from chancell@@ or ang@@ ela mer@@ kel and up to 34 other heads of state .
the head of national intelligence services , james cl@@ pper , def@@ ended the spir@@ al of violence among allies as necessary and declared that this was due to the practice on both sides .
in all this t@@ um@@ ult , mur@@ ph@@ y said that his authority was preparing the trip of congress .
the names of the other participating members should be included in the coming days .
he said that the exact travel route is going to be worked out .
while mur@@ ph@@ y emphasi@@ zed that the purpose of the journey is to improve relations , he also talked about the need for some “ serious words ” .
he said that the european governments must give their people honest information about the kind of es@@ pi@@ on@@ age programmes that they themselves have been embar@@ king on for years .
“ while we can improve our monitoring programs and thus improve the rights of europeans , we can do better , ” he said .
meanwhile , the european union ’ s new president , john ker@@ ry , is on a weekend trip to the middle east and poland to look after the res@@ ent@@ ment of the us strategy in syria , egypt , and iran , and us surveillance activities .

it is the daughter of peter tun@@ ks , a former player of the austr@@ ali@@ an rub@@ gy league .
tun@@ k &apos;s statement to sunday telec@@ om was that the sy@@ d@@ ney tv station is the only one “ extremely concerned ” about the well-being of its daughter .
