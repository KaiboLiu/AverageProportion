the report : even more security for pede@@ stri@@ ans and pede@@ stri@@ ans .
they are not 100 metres apart : on tuesday , the european parliament &apos;s opinion is that the new b 3@@ 3-@@ foot amp@@ li@@ fi@@ er is to be put into operation at the village car park - in sight of the older town hall sam@@ ples .
two plants so close to each other : intention or tur@@ tle ?
this question has been addressed by the may@@ or of the city yesterday .
&quot; the town hall sam@@ ples are then installed and the city hall was built in order to secure the school way &quot; , ec@@ ker@@ t explained yesterday .
the k@@ lu@@ ser@@ -@@ traffic light both safe cy@@ cli@@ sts and bus passengers and the mountain inhabitants .
the official start of the plant was made yesterday important for the crossing area of sul@@ z@@ b@@ ach@@ we@@ g / kir@@ ch@@ stra@@ ß@@ e .
we have the museum , two churches , spa park , bus stop , a doctor and a bank , as well as the traffic flow from the resid@@ en@@ cial area gru@@ › b ‹ .
&quot; at the high traffic and pede@@ strian traffic volume , it was necessary to create another traffic light for their safety , &quot; rec@@ ker@@ t said .
this is confirmed by peter ar@@ no@@ ld of the council of land@@ rat@@ r@@ at off@@ enburg .
&quot; according to current measure@@ ments , the b 33 runs through around 12 000 vehicles daily through the municip@@ ality of gu@@ t@@ ach , of which about 10 % are heavy traffic &quot; , emphasi@@ ses ar@@ no@@ ld .
therefore , the construction of another traffic light is more than necessary : &quot; safety is simply on the way &quot; , ar@@ no@@ ld said .
in total , four traffic shows were carried out , including a roun@@ d@@ about was also considered , but due to the close proximity in the sul@@ z@@ b@@ ach@@ we@@ g / kir@@ ch@@ stras@@ se junction .
it was named ar@@ no@@ ld at the location of the traffic lights in the city .
the approximately eur 15 000 am@@ pl@@ it@@ ude plant itself is the most modern in the world at the moment .
the complex is equipped with col@@ oured le@@ ds , which are so bright that the lights are not too bright for the drivers .
and econom@@ ical it is also : the older lighting systems use about 100 wat@@ ts , the new ones only eight wat@@ ts .
the maximum distance between the two lights is 3 .
ar@@ no@@ ld explained the technique of the new plant : it is equipped with two rad@@ ar sen@@ sors .
press the pede@@ strian to turn the light button , the driver will test the upper rad@@ ar sensor to determine the traffic situation .
is the road free , comes directly green for the pede@@ strian , when not , takes a little more than 15 seconds .
another rad@@ ar sensor checks whether the rad@@ ar phase is correct for the pede@@ strian .
&quot; if a group or persons with walking dis@@ abilities should go over the street , the green phase will be extended , so everyone will be able to travel safe@@ ly , &quot; explained ar@@ no@@ ld .
of course , drivers must be a partner here and the drivers must observe the track .
this was not the case yesterday : hardly the traffic lights showed up for pede@@ stri@@ ans green , smo@@ ked a top class car , and the traffic lights were not working .

a black@@ box in the car ?
american street pl@@ ann@@ ers are looking for a monetary source that will help to reduce the dec@@ lining high@@ way system .
the devices that each user can control every kil@@ ome@@ tre of traffic and pass on information to the authorities are the core of a controversial attempt by washington and the plans for the european union .
the normally rather bor@@ ing area of road planning has suddenly reached an intensive debate with bun@@ t@@ led al@@ li@@ ances .
liber@@ tari@@ ans have been working with environmental groups and are in favour of the eu government taking the small boxes to the record the pollu@@ ted goods .
the tea party is de@@ pl@@ or@@ able .
the american civil rights association ( ac@@ l@@ u ) is also deeply concerned and deeply concerned about a number of data protection concerns .
but , while congress has not agreed on a course of action , several federal states are no longer waiting .
they are currently exam@@ ining how they can be implemented over the next ten years into a system in which drivers are paid for each m@@ ile in danger .
thousands of drivers have lost their driving lic@@ ences , many of which are equipped with g@@ ps monitoring .
that is really a must for our country .
“ it is nothing we can only use if we are able to do so , ” said has@@ an i@@ kh@@ r@@ ata , managing director of the southern california institute of technology .
the way in which we are going to pay these taxes will change .
the technology for this is there .
the initiative comes at a time when the highway tr@@ uck fleet is being used to finance the economy .
but in america , it is not so much tan@@ g@@ led as it was before .
cars con@@ sume less petro@@ l .
the state oil tax of 18@@ .@@ 4 c@@ ents per gall@@ on of government oil ( less than 4 c@@ ents per lit@@ re ) has been a non-@@ exi@@ stent for 20 years .
politicians d@@ are to take the risk of driving the tax even by a pen@@ ny , at high prices .
“ the petro@@ l tax is simply not sustainable , ” le@@ e m@@ un@@ n@@ ich said , an expert on transport legislation at the university of min@@ n@@ es@@ ot@@ a .
his state has recently bought 500 cars with tac@@ ho@@ graph@@ s , and the government has been able to create a mil@@ e-@@ based payment system .
“ this is the most sensible alternative in the long term , ” he said .
bureaucr@@ ats call it the mil@@ est@@ one based user benefit .
not surpris@@ ingly , the idea of urban liber@@ als has been embr@@ ac@@ ed , because the tax could be used to promote the driving behaviour of the way in which st@@ alls and climate damage are reduced .
california ’ s pl@@ ann@@ ers rely on the system in drawing up policies that will help to reduce the ambitious , legally en@@ shr@@ ined aims of the federal state on climate change .
but the republic@@ an bill shu@@ ff@@ le from pen@@ n@@ sy@@ l@@ v@@ ania has been a member of the house transportation committee , and has also declared that the republic@@ an party is in it the most viable long-term alternative .
free movement of goods and services is also a key issue for the reason that the reason for the success of the reason foundation is to pay drivers on a long distance .
“ this is not a tax that is paid in a black hole , ” explains adri@@ an mo@@ ore , vice president of directives at read@@ as@@ on .
people pay directly for what they do .
the movement is also supported by two former us transport ministers , who were in a report in 2011 to invite congress to take part in the mil@@ est@@ ones based on the accounting system .
the us sen@@ ate approved a new law on the subject of the death penalty last year , which was $ 90 million expensive .
but the majority in the house of representatives prevented the push and re@@ acted with it to the concerns of members from rural areas who were not represented by people who were in the everyday life often to spend many miles on their way to work or city .
several states and large cities are moving in the right direction , however .
the most dedicated is o@@ reg@@ on , the current 5@@ ,000 driver for the largest experim@@ ent of the country .
these drivers will soon be charged mil@@ e@@ age instead of the oil tax to the federal state .
ne@@ v@@ ada has already launched a pilot project .
new york city is also considering such a .
il@@ lin@@ o@@ is tests it in restricted mode and uses l@@ k@@ ws .
and the i-@@ 95 coalition is the one that the transport ministers have asked for from 17 states to participate in .
the concept is not a universal hit .
in ne@@ v@@ ada , where 50 volunte@@ ers were recently working with the equipment , car drivers were s@@ cep@@ tical about the idea of the government could control each of its movements .
“ concerns about big brother and such things were a big problem , ” explains al@@ aud@@ din k@@ hu@@ an , head of the strategy and development team at the university of hamburg .
people wanted to do it .
when the test was started , the commission war@@ ned that the ac@@ l@@ u from ne@@ v@@ ada on their website was “ it would be relatively easy to include the tac@@ ho@@ graph in full-@@ grown monitoring devices . ”
there is no need to create a gi@@ gan@@ tic , bul@@ ky technological infrastructure .
ne@@ v@@ ada is part of a number of states that are now seeking affordable technology .
i am not saying that this would mean that the public would be more reas@@ su@@ red .
hun@@ ting for this technology has led to a small star@@ tup bo@@ om company called true mic@@ key mouse in california .
the company was not originally established to provide state states with a tax on car drivers .
rather , it was their aim to create a new market for car manufacturers , which would allow them to compete with the rest of the world on the basis of the miles they have travell@@ ed .
but the information it has tested is also very important for road pl@@ ann@@ ers , because they do not work with g@@ ps and only deliver limited information that is regularly transmitted via mode@@ m .
“ people are more willing to participate in it , if their speed and location are not increased .
in some of these public pilot programmes , major mistakes have been made .
there are much cheaper and less in@@ tru@@ sive ways to implement this .
in o@@ reg@@ on , the plan@@ ner experim@@ ents with using car drivers to create a series of choices .
you can register for a device with or without g@@ ps .
or they do not choose any device at all and pay a flat fee based on the average cost of the entire journey , which is the same for all residents of the federal state .
others hope that the concept of a motion of cen@@ sure will be able to sell by using the equipment with more functions .
in new york city , transport officials want to set up a taxation device that will also reduce the cost of parking , but only provide insurance for dangerous kilometres .
“ drivers would be protected by the added value of the benefits that the system offers .
some road pl@@ ann@@ ers are wonder@@ ing whether the whole talk about paying per m@@ ile is not just a huge waste of time .
the metro@@ politan hotel trans@@ por@@ ta@@ tion. the commission for the area of san francis@@ co bay declared that officials had been working on the congress to resolve the problem of bank@@ rup@@ t@@ cy highway trust fund .
an additional one-@@ time fee or annual fee of eur 1.@@ 50 may be imposed on drivers with hy@@ bri@@ d vehicles or other vehicles that use little petro@@ l .
“ there is no reason for an operation if an asp@@ ir@@ in is also sufficient ” , explains dr. ran@@ dy r@@ def@@ ler , who is head of legislation and public affairs of the commission .
if we do that , hundreds of millions of car drivers will worry about their privacy .
the royal field : small team be@@ ats w@@ ack@@ er and the team is w@@ ack@@ er .
voluntary fire@@ figh@@ ters are ir@@ ri@@ g@@ ated by their autumn main pro@@ be despite personnel short@@ ages with brown and white .
only 11 men participated in the exercise .
the division comm@@ ander han@@ s ka@@ is@@ er had been in his usual practice and had been able to use the property fea@@ der in the bur@@ g@@ ber@@ ger stra@@ ß@@ e .
the sam@@ pling is to be made by means of a short circuit .
the resulting industry has created a new and growing trend for smo@@ ke , one of which has not yet been able to send an emergency call .
two bre@@ a@@ thing protec@@ tors of the defense were deplo@@ yed after the first check of the situation by h@@ ans kam@@ mer , ready to enter the building .
after a short time , the first person was able to find and enter the open .
the second person had to be wor@@ n .
this was not so easy , as a close sta@@ ir@@ case was to be overcome .
the building , a workshop with integrated stone and a small bar@@ n for two horses , was not easy to secure .
it was a lot of wood and also stra@@ w bal@@ es in it .
there were also electric machines for wood processing .
the first ext@@ ingu@@ ishing attack was made via the tan@@ k in the vehicle .
another management was the creation of a large over@@ hau@@ l and hy@@ dr@@ ant in about 100 metres distance .
three ho@@ les could be designed .
the new version of the new version of the new version of the original version of the original version of the original version was released .
h@@ ans kam@@ me@@ rer was the cul@@ min@@ ation of the exercise to show what was happening with little available knowledge .
in case of emergency , support is provided via the kö@@ ni@@ gs@@ fel@@ d daily operation group .
the comm@@ ander was very familiar with the course of the exercise .
net@@ working of universities and companies important for the success of the company .
during his visit to the district of bre@@ is@@ gau@@ -@@ ho@@ ch@@ sch@@ war@@ z@@ wal@@ d , rural president gui@@ do wol@@ f was able to inform himself of the situation in ti@@ tis@@ ee new stadt about where the workers of tomorrow come from .
in the high-@@ al@@ titude black forest development centre , he went to the university of hamburg together with the managing directors of vocational schools and the district gy@@ m@@ na@@ si@@ um and the parents ’ advisory committee chairs on this important issue .
&quot; education is an important factor in the location &quot; , under@@ lined cla@@ u@@ dia ste@@ l@@ le , director of the han@@ s-@@ th@@ om@@ a school , who has developed the net@@ worked education centre in ho@@ ch@@ sch@@ war@@ z@@ wal@@ d .
the first of these was the first model of the new generation of the german model .
since 2011 , the world ’ s forests have been co@@ operating successfully between the fo@@ er@@ der@@ z@@ entr@@ um , kre@@ is@@ gy@@ m@@ na@@ si@@ um and ber@@ u@@ f@@ s@@ schul@@ z@@ entr@@ um .
i also p@@ raised the family friend@@ liness of the district .
&quot; it is important not only to look at the family phase , but also to be able to cope with the period of family care due to demographic change .
he also said that the situation is becoming more and more concerned with care for and care for their families .
&quot; without the support of employers , the resulting increase in the work@@ force could lead to an end to the working relationship . &quot;
but no one can afford to buy skilled workers .
another aspect of the report is the net@@ working of high-@@ level and enterprise .
&quot; for who@@ ever has been the pre@@ cur@@ sor of the region during his studies , remains in touch with his acquired knowledge and his skills .
only if there is sufficient training places available can the european court of justice be able to cover the needs of skilled workers .
in his opinion , the location advantage of the district is its advant@@ ageous location in the sou@@ th@@ west of germany , in the immediate vicinity of france and switzerland .
moreover , he experienced a great deal of political inst@@ ability on his train journey from ti@@ tis@@ ee neu@@ stadt to fre@@ i@@ burg , which has already been made .

the more than 100 year old stone wall as a front deli@@ mit@@ ation of the old building , which is in front of the renov@@ ation , is to be re@@ opened with the cost plan of the city of br@@ ä@@ un@@ ling@@ en .
in the days before the kil@@ big was at the first works of the renov@@ ation of the front school a small tiny angle wall , to stab@@ ili@@ ze and sta@@ tic relief of the more than one hundred years old natural stone wall with bal@@ u@@ str@@ ade .
the way forward is to say , alexander mis@@ ok , that the tan@@ ning machine in the city of br@@ ä@@ un@@ ling@@ en , the land@@ marks office , should be included in the planning and a plan for re@@ hab@@ ilitation of the old wall .
after that , a cost calcul@@ ation by experts is to be carried out , which will then be made available to the municip@@ al council to decide and determine what further action to take .
a decision on this is expected to be taken as early as next year .
after the renov@@ ation , the pl@@ aster and the plan@@ ting of the old school tree , the school building was re@@ built within the two wing of the school built in 19@@ 12 .
the historic , one hundred year old de@@ mar@@ c@@ ation wall of the old school building to the church road is particularly protected by water and fro@@ st damage , since no dra@@ in@@ age is available .
deep cr@@ acks in individual br@@ ic@@ ks bear witness to weather damage , but the wall is not collap@@ sing at the moment .
a solid wall is a pre@@ requisite for a pu@@ pil@@ s using schul@@ hof , which is guaranteed by the current fix@@ ing works .
originally , the schul@@ ho@@ f@@ s@@ re@@ hab@@ ilitation was already in place in the years 2008 / 2009 , but high un@@ planned expenditure brought a shift .
one important word in the historical school wall renov@@ ation that even ex@@ isted for film rec@@ ord@@ ings is the national mon@@ ument .
if any of the terms of this agreement is found to be applicable , the city of br@@ ä@@ un@@ ling@@ en hopes to receive subsidies from the conservation authorities .
the students of the tan@@ ning school of primary school , which has now been re-@@ established in a well-@@ san@@ ded old school building with new a@@ ula , can soon experience the old school cour@@ ty@@ ard .
ö@@ z@@ dem@@ ir wants to train jazz in stutt@@ gart .
in the ongoing discussions on the future of the music universities in bad@@ en-@@ w@@ ür@@ t@@ tem@@ berg , the issue of the future of ce@@ m ö@@ z@@ dem@@ ir , federal president of the greens , has also been addressed .
&quot; i think it is wrong to ignore the ho@@ lis@@ tic training in the music college stutt@@ gart .
jazz and classical music are just at the jazz site in stutt@@ gart .
this is not the case , mr ö@@ z@@ dem@@ ir , who was born in stutt@@ gart as a fav@@ or of a direct mandate in the federal election on 22 september , the green red state government .
this forces the commission to take action on the basis of an expert study to re@@ organize the five music universities in bad@@ en-@@ w@@ ür@@ t@@ tem@@ berg .
the aim is to improve the performance of jazz and pop by the music academy in stutt@@ gart and the city of music in the direction of the munich music academy .
u.s. border : &quot; super tun@@ nels &quot; to drug s@@ mu@@ gg@@ ling discovered the world &apos;s largest drug s@@ mu@@ gg@@ ling site .
on the border between mexico and the us , investig@@ ators have created a &apos; super tunnel &apos; to s@@ mu@@ gg@@ le drugs and have dec@@ om@@ mis@@ sion@@ ed .
as the us customs authorities have said , the more than 500 metres long roman wall was not a good solution between ti@@ ju@@ ana and san di@@ e@@ go with electricity , railway tracks and an aer@@ ation system .
three susp@@ ects were thus arrested and the government sent@@ enced eight tonnes of mari@@ ju@@ ana and almost 150 kg of co@@ ca@@ ine .
the tunnel was not , according to the data , yet in use .
&quot; this car@@ te@@ ls are st@@ up@@ id when they think they could be under the rad@@ ar .
the drug gan@@ gs have been assured of du@@ ff@@ y : &apos; if you continue to use such tun@@ nels and try to use them , we are determined to do so at a huge waste of your s@@ mu@@ gg@@ ling money . &apos;
both the us authorities and the mex@@ ic@@ an security forces are in a permanent state of war against drug car@@ te@@ ls .
since 2006 , more than 7@@ 7@@ ,000 people have been killed in mexico in connection with drug crime .
experts construc@@ t a new type of machine designed by experts .
because of the extensive equipment of the tunnel , the er@@ as@@ m@@ us assume that the tunnel is designed by architec@@ ts and engineers .
the track system was equipped to allow the installation of electr@@ ically operated cars .
on mex@@ ic@@ an side , access is in a building that is 80 meters from the border .
according to the authorities , a lad@@ der leads 20 metres deep to the actual entrance of the tunnel .
the tunnel has a cross-@@ section of 1.@@ 20 metres and 90 in@@ ches of width .
it would also have been a good way of combating illegal immigration to the united states .
two of the susp@@ ects were arrested in connection with the co@@ ca@@ ine fund .
the third , a mex@@ ic@@ an , was sent@@ enced to death for se@@ iz@@ ure of mari@@ ju@@ ana .
all three face the threat of a maximum penalty of life@@ -@@ long de@@ priv@@ ation , as officials have said .
since 2006 , eight such tun@@ nels have been discovered , but they were reported to have been on the press conference in san di@@ e@@ go .
it is the first time that the european parliament has had a debate on co@@ ca@@ ine in this way .
usually co@@ ca@@ ine is used in smaller quantities and not through tun@@ nels .
this shows the &quot; desper@@ ation &quot; of the drug gan@@ gs , whose traditional routes have now been cut off , bill clin@@ ton said .
they would do everything they can to go to the us .
the de@@ tain@@ e@@ es were not given any details , at least one of them was mex@@ ic@@ ans .
they must be pun@@ ished with prison sent@@ ences of up to ten years .
in 20@@ 14 , ge@@ is@@ inger fe@@ st@@ ja@@ hr becomes the fe@@ st@@ ja@@ hr 20@@ 14 ho@@ sted festival year of the ge@@ is@@ inger fe@@ st@@ ja@@ hr .
the anniversary of the city of ge@@ is@@ ingen on the occasion of the 12@@ 50 .
the re@@ vers@@ al of the first docum@@ entary mention is getting closer and closer .
if in more than eight weeks the year is over , the anniversary of the year is over .
ho@@ stag@@ e-@@ sing@@ ing and church house@@ holds were born in 7@@ 94 for the first time together .
in churches , a certificate was produced , in which both places are mentioned .
on 15 march there will be an official start to the anniversary year of the european union , and since ge@@ is@@ ingen is not currently in a hall , this opening event will take place in the place where the first two people were mentioned 12@@ 50 years ago , in church .
in the context of the anniversary , several events are being held both in ge@@ is@@ ingen and in kir@@ ch@@ en-@@ haus@@ en .
church house in the village of k@@ az@@ im@@ i@@ er@@ z , germany , will host the 12@@ 50 church house party in july on a weekend of the 18th to 20th of july .
we are celebr@@ ating the re@@ sumption .
on friday with a fe@@ st@@ act , on saturday and sunday with a festival around the church al@@ ley .
at this weekend , there is also the church house piano festival , which takes place in the town of k@@ ap@@ run .
city music director ru@@ dol@@ f bar@@ th has created a new album for the city on the occasion of the anniversary , which will be presented at three events .
on 21 june , together with the sunday celebr@@ ation of the black forest association , on 12 july in the arena with fire@@ works and on 13 december as the first concert of the city music in the new f@@ es@@ th@@ al@@ le .
this is celebrated in the anniversary year and is in@@ aug@@ ur@@ ated , the official date is the last weekend of september , 27 and 27 august .
on the occasion of the ge@@ is@@ inger city anniversary , the exhibition will be accompanied by a new chron@@ ic@@ le .
&quot; but it should be a chron@@ ic@@ le not only of viol@@ ins themselves , but a printed book .
and the intellectual property of today also celebra@@ tes 20@@ 14 .
the new chron@@ ic@@ le will be published on 21 or 22 november in the new f@@ es@@ th@@ al@@ le in ge@@ is@@ ingen .
in 20@@ 14 , however , another year with many anniversary celebra@@ tions .
the nar@@ r@@ ation stra@@ w gl@@ on@@ ki starts on february 8 with a traditional bre@@ w@@ ery evening on the occasion of its 6@@ 0-@@ year anniversary , the harmony gu@@ t@@ mad@@ ingen will be 90 years and opened on march 29 the festival ban@@ quet and festival .
the al@@ ten@@ wer@@ k le@@ ip@@ fer@@ d@@ ingen will be 40 years old , the ge@@ is@@ inger school has been in the new location for 50 years and celebra@@ tes this on 10 may , the musi@@ k@@ vere@@ in poly@@ hy@@ m@@ nia le@@ ip@@ fer@@ d@@ ingen will be 150 years old and celebra@@ tes it .
the town of ge@@ is@@ ingen was built in a certificate of don@@ ation which is owned by the st. g@@ allen monaster@@ y in 7@@ 64 .
the certificate was issued in churches ( houses ) .
both communities are therefore able to find the same document .
reason 20@@ 14 of this 12@@ 50 year anniversary accordingly to celebrate , in addition to the municip@@ al form 40 years back .
the council takes track systems to its k@@ ne@@ es .
if the railway crossing is to be opened &quot; at h@@ ir@@ sch@@ en &quot; in a complex way to increase traffic safety ?
yes , do local authorities have decided .
sch@@ il@@ t@@ ach must be eur 2@@ 20 000 for this .
deutsche bahn wants to make the cinema show a success this coming year .
in particular , safety at the cros@@ s@@ ings of the railway should be increased - there are frequent col@@ li@@ sions between trains across germany with other vehicles .
do the communities agree to the restructuring measures , they must deal with one third of the costs they inc@@ ur , the rest share the railway and the federal government .
sch@@ il@@ t@@ ach@@ t city buil@@ der ro@@ land gri@@ e@@ ß@@ hab@@ er explained to the municip@@ al council the specific@@ ities of the ba@@ h@@ ü@@ g@@ gan@@ g &quot; am h@@ ir@@ sch@@ en &quot; .
the commission is planning to invest in the amount of the tunnel m@@ ill there in the west of the railway track .
there , larger vehicles could also be built , such as those trans@@ porting long tim@@ ber , in counter@@ -@@ traffic , without bloc@@ king the track .
gre@@ e@@ ks therefore proposed that a necessary support for the construction of a base wall should be built to prevent the city from leaving the road to the next .
this was discussed in the municip@@ al council in controversial terms , as some counc@@ ils have not recognised the need for road distribution : thomas ki@@ p@@ p , in his statement , brought the mo@@ od of cri@@ tics to the point : &apos; because of so few vehicles we have to take so few money so few cars so much ?
may@@ or thomas ha@@ as dis@@ agreed : the railway crossing &quot; h@@ ir@@ sch@@ en &quot; was regularly used for long-@@ distance transport .
even wood from the &quot; co@@ w &quot; area is partly trans@@ ported over this route , because the up to 20 metres long vehicles have left the track at the h@@ ä@@ ber@@ l@@ lar bridge because they are not included in the main road .
in addition , the route is used as a re@@ direction for those vehicles that will not use the tunnel when the main road is closed .
as it can be seen that kir@@ ch@@ berg and sch@@ los@@ s@@ berg tun@@ nels have been re@@ built and restored , as the current situation in wol@@ f@@ gan@@ g is , the railway transition could be followed by the &quot; h@@ ir@@ sch@@ en &quot; for a long period .
the counc@@ ils agreed to investigate how the eu &apos;s financial resources are to be used to spread the road .
nevertheless , the conversion of the railway crossing of the railway was approved by a majority with the pro@@ vis@@ o that the necessary support wall is built in such a way that the city can take the road to the &quot; ba@@ hn@@ ho@@ f@@ stra@@ ß@@ e &quot; if necessary for 5 , if necessary .
the reconstruction of the railway crossing at ger@@ ber@@ i tr@@ aut@@ we@@ in could , on the other hand , have a completely different problem , which could hin@@ der access to the rapidly increasing &quot; ger@@ ol@@ tz@@ h@@ ä@@ user we@@ g &quot; .
the administration had to make the plans for the railway from br@@ ü@@ inf@@ inger engineering office to investigate the problem of the construction of the railway , since it had doubts as to whether the planned connection of the ger@@ ol@@ tz@@ h@@ ä@@ user was still possible .
the investigation concluded that the commission was not able to rule out the possibility of ti@@ ghten@@ ing the road &apos;s ti@@ gh@@ tly win@@ ding conditions .
the responsibility for this lies with the city as a road load carrier .
the conversion could therefore be made without any liability .
since both the de@@ fore@@ station and the off@@ turn in the current expansion condition worked , the building should be left to the reconstruction of the railway crossing .
it is also worth men@@ tioning here the risk of a col@@ li@@ sion of the train with a vehicle standing in the transition much less than the other railway cros@@ s@@ ings , because the stop is right next to the center where a good visible connection is found .
even trains from the main station would have to be dro@@ pped here so far that the train station is not in danger of col@@ li@@ sion .
the majority of the members of the railway were agreed to the conversion of this railway crossing , as sch@@ il@@ t@@ ach was able to solve the problem of se@@ ated vehicles , as the whe@@ els of the council have decided to move to the new building .
as an un@@ proble@@ matic the panel considers the conversion to the railway crossing points &quot; before ha@@ u@@ bach &quot; and &quot; before ku@@ h@@ bach &quot; , for which already cros@@ s@@ ings with the railway have been made .
es@@ a deci@@ des on large space missions : missions for bil@@ lions of euros , and missions for bil@@ lions of dollars .
dist@@ ant plan@@ ets , gra@@ vit@@ ational waves or black ho@@ les - experts in the european space industry - are required to make their way to two major projects that they will be able to launch in the next few years .
30 proposals were selected , five are still in the race .
far worl@@ ds .
more than 1000 plan@@ ets on other stars have a@@ stronom@@ ers already found .
whether it is at least some of them , nobody knows .
the choice is difficult : should you go to gra@@ vit@@ ational waves ?
or rather the origin of the co@@ smo@@ s ?
or after earth &apos;s similar plan@@ ets , and perhaps ali@@ en planet life , ?
these questions are the ones that are particularly asking the european space agency es@@ a .
for your program &quot; co@@ sm@@ ic vision &quot; you are looking for ideas for two major space projects that will make a decisive contribution to research .
the budget for such &quot; l missions &quot; is approximately eur 1 billion each .
the start is expected to be in 20@@ 28 and 20@@ 34 .
in early september , in paris , the elite of the european space research community met to make proposals for such missions .
30 ideas were up for debate , five of them are now in the closer elections .
many bodies are exam@@ ining the proposals that h@@ ack the co@@ ins of researchers .
in the next few days , a final decision will be taken by the scientific programme committee .
four major issues have been raised by the es@@ a , which the missions of the european space agency ( co@@ sm@@ ic vision ) , initiated in 2007 , will be answered .
what are the conditions for the emerg@@ ence of plan@@ ets and lives ?
the exact procedures for the creation of new stars are described in detail in the section called “ star formation ” .
a large infra@@ red tel@@ es@@ cope with a wide range of light sources could pen@@ etr@@ ate this dark .
and if a star has a planet , under what circumstances can life arise there ?
to address this issue , 20@@ 17 is to be the space tel@@ es@@ cope &quot; che@@ ops &quot; .
the possibilities are limited , che@@ ops is a small mission with a budget of $ 150 million .
with larger instruments , a@@ stronom@@ ers could produce earth like plan@@ ets , and even determine the composition of their atmo@@ sp@@ he@@ res , thus searching for &quot; bi@@ om@@ ar@@ kers &quot; : g@@ ases that are used as an indication of biological activity .
how does the solar system work ?
this question , too , is to ultimately provide an explanation of the conditions for the creation of life .
the role of magne@@ tism is important for a star and the interaction of its magnetic field .
in our solar system , these processes can be ex@@ em@@ pl@@ ary .
the &quot; solar or@@ b@@ iting &quot; has been the first time that es@@ a has launched a m-@@ class mission ( there is the budget about half a billion euros ) for this issue .
the pro@@ be is to start in 20@@ 17 and the surface and activity of the sun is closely monitored .
i am very interested in the researchers , too , j@@ up@@ i@@ ter and his mo@@ ons .
you want to find out what role the giant pl@@ ant@@ ation plays in the development of the solar system .
the es@@ a provides for this the first of the three l missions of the &quot; co@@ sm@@ ic vision &quot; program .
the pro@@ be &quot; ju@@ ice &quot; ( j@@ up@@ i@@ ter ic@@ y mo@@ ons explorer ) begins its journey ahead of the earth in 20@@ 22 .
eight years later , j@@ up@@ i@@ ter is to reach j@@ up@@ i@@ ter and to preserve the atmosphere of the planet , as well as the ic@@ y mon@@ de europe , kal@@ lis@@ to and gan@@ y@@ med .
what are the basic physical laws of the universe ?
the space offers many possibilities to create material under extreme conditions .
perhaps the difference between the two is also evident , which will lead physi@@ ci@@ sts to a new theory , under which the whole world of natural laws mer@@ ges .
how is the universe born and what is it ?
the first of these was the creation of our co@@ smo@@ s by the big ban@@ g .
in addition to the experience of the subject , which is made up of stars , plan@@ ets and living beings like us , there are dark matter , the gra@@ vity of which is gal@@ ax@@ ies and gal@@ ax@@ ies .
so far , researchers have not known the physical laws that apply in the first few seconds , nor what the physical laws of the big ban@@ g were .
with &quot; eu@@ cli@@ d &quot; the es@@ a has already developed an m-@@ mission here .
with a special tel@@ es@@ cope , the pro@@ be is intended to determine the distribution of the matter in the universe for the first time in the entire sky , thus drawing conclusions about the nature of dark matter and dark matter .
if you could run the race , you can get the chance to win the race .
of the 30 proposals , at the end of the selection process , only two remain .
the best chance of obtaining a grant as an l mission is , according to many experts , &quot; e-@@ lis@@ a &quot; , a demanding concept for demonstr@@ ating gra@@ vit@@ ational waves .
physi@@ ci@@ sts understand changes in the structure of space time , which al@@ bert e@@ inste@@ in introduced almost 100 years ago .
it has been proven to date that they have not .
el@@ is@@ a could do so , but the scientists hope to support the project .
the mission envis@@ ages a two-@@ phase pro@@ be with a detec@@ tor that is located in the space .
it could , unlike plants on earth , be gra@@ vit@@ ational waves , which could be used in the big ban@@ g .
four other proposals still compete for the second l mission : a big x-@@ ray tube with a large x-@@ ray tube called &quot; ath@@ ena &quot; , which is black and white ho@@ les .
already out@@ dated are under construction proposals for the sam@@ pling of the re@@ tro@@ fit from mar@@ s , for the expl@@ or@@ ation of moon , ven@@ us and aster@@ o@@ ids , as well as for solar physi@@ cs .
snow@@ den ready to work with germany on us surveillance .
ed@@ ward snow@@ den , the wh@@ ist@@ le@@ b@@ lower of the us intelligence service , has stated that he is willing to go to berlin and , before the german federal parliament , to declare that the american national security agency is in office .
the german member , han@@ s-@@ christian str@@ ö@@ be@@ le , met snow@@ den on thursday in russia , where he was granted asylum , to talk to him about the situation in germany .
in a letter from snow@@ den , which was sent on friday by str@@ ö@@ be@@ le to the media in berlin , this letter says : ‘ although the outcome of my efforts has been demonstr@@ ably positive , my government is tre@@ ating a different opinion .
the truth is , however , not a crime .
in the letter , snow@@ den wri@@ tes that he believes that the european union &apos;s support for the peace process will convince the american government to stop the charge against him .
the us judicial authorities ’ appeal to the us department includes spi@@ on@@ age and the@@ ft of prisoners of state , and the prosecu@@ tion is not responsible for the prosecu@@ tion .
the german interior minister han@@ s-@@ peter fried@@ rich said to time online : “ if mr snow@@ den is willing to cooperate with german representatives , he will find a way to make that possible . ”
relations between the us and germany are characterised by the claims that the us and germany have not yet signed the mobile phone by chancell@@ or ang@@ ela mer@@ kel .
thomas op@@ per@@ mann , the member who has been the chief executive officer of the parliamentary committee responsible for the secret service , said that you should se@@ ize the opportunity to listen to snow@@ den as a witness if this is possible , ‘ without jeopar@@ dis@@ ing relations and protecting them ’ .
str@@ ö@@ be@@ le , a green me@@ p , published a picture of himself and snow@@ den in his t@@ wit@@ ter feed .
he was arrested on his visit to russia by two german journalists .
str@@ ö@@ be@@ le explained that , according to the law@@ yer of the former n@@ sa employee snow@@ den was not sent back to russia if he had left the country .
when snow@@ den is said to be in germany , then he needs an assurance that he will be “ safe ” there , the member says .
snow@@ den explains in his letter that he is committed to a “ serious and ongoing ” policy of persecu@@ tion .
however , it is touched by the global response to “ my act of political expression ” .
citizens around the world , as well as high-@@ level politicians – including in the united states – have been deeply sho@@ c@@ ked by un@@ controlled systems of comprehensive surveillance than a mer@@ it in the public .
in his letter , snow@@ den makes the german authorities an offer of cooperation , “ if the difficulties surrounding the humanitarian situation are resolved , ” he says .
fronti@@ er airlines charges a fee for hand bag@@ gage , which is charged at the airport .
fronti@@ er airlines plans to deliver up to 100 us dollars of passenger services to the united states and canada on their flight .
fronti@@ er airlines intends to deliver up to usd 100 for a piece of hand bag@@ gage and $ 2 for coffee or le@@ mon@@ ade .
the new fee applies to hand bag@@ gage in the luggage com@@ part@@ ment above the seat , small bags under the seat are still free .
fronti@@ er explained that it is calculated $ 25 if the fee is paid in advance , and $ 100 .
fron@@ t-@@ page speaker k@@ ate o &apos;@@ mal@@ ley said that the fee of 100 us dollars targets to be paid to travellers .
“ we want to avoid calcul@@ ating this amount , ” she explained .
airlines began to charge passengers for the first and second listed flight in 2008 .
passengers who tried to travel through them were not allowed to travel as much as possible .
fees are one way of forcing passengers to pay less with the same passengers .
o &apos;@@ mal@@ ley said that the new fee is about not really making a money .
it is about the most loy@@ al clients of fronti@@ er , who have clearly stated that they are always finding it har@@ der to find a place in the com@@ part@@ ment above the seat .
passengers who have purchased their tickets on the airline website will be required to pay .
this means that a passenger is not allowed to travel from front to re@@ ar of a bag@@ gage for free , but the next person is allowed to carry 100 dollars for a comparable piece of bag@@ gage .
o &apos;@@ mal@@ ley explained that the site of fronti@@ er and the check-in machine procedures would be changed so that passengers could be informed about the fee they have paid before they can get to the terminal .
the new hand bag@@ gage fee from fronti@@ er will only enter into force in the summer , and a precise date will not yet be available .
passengers ch@@ ase often over bag@@ gage allow@@ ances and other charges , but airlines often use them to do so .
they argue that the euro is a good way of carrying luggage and that passengers should not pay for it if they have wanted it .
many of the wall street ’ s new bag@@ gage charges see themselves as a sign that the airlines are taking enough money to pay for the costs of flight accidents after years of losses .
most of them , however , have so far been fing@@ ers of charges for hand bag@@ gage .
spirit airlines is a global leader in the field of aircraft maintenance and repair .
the only other airline with such a fee is the hungarian airlines wi@@ z@@ z air , explained the air@@ lin@@ e-@@ consult@@ ant j@@ ay so@@ ren@@ sen , who has paid careful attention to the additional charges .
he estimated in a report of december 2011 that the hand@@ bag@@ gage fee is $ 50 million per year .
so@@ ren@@ sen , who used to be a leader in mid@@ west airlines , was the first to introduce the company to spiritual leaders .
“ the boarding process was one of the most smooth and efficient processes in the world .
i expected to be able to avoid te@@ aring and stra@@ i@@ ght@@ forward discussions at the gate .
“ the plane was full , ” he explained , “ and the boarding ran like a lu@@ br@@ ic@@ ated aircraft . ”
fronti@@ er follows spirit also in the 2 dollars that are used for coffee , tea , le@@ mon@@ ade or ju@@ ice .
the company stated that passengers who have been carrying the le@@ mon@@ ade or ju@@ ice will be able to keep the whole can and coffee free of charge .
water remains free .
us air@@ ways had a short attempt in 2008 to provide refres@@ h@@ ment drinks .
fron@@ ti@@ er &apos;s step to charge for hand bag@@ gage is when passengers are not directly at the airport .
airlines pay online travel agencies such as or@@ bit@@ z 10 to 25 dollars per sold ticket .
this provides a stimul@@ us to all companies to provide passengers with direct purch@@ ases instead of having an online travel agency .
fronti@@ er is a very important factor in this area .
in september , the company began to provide a free travel agent for reservations only half as many frequent fl@@ yer miles as it had previously booked .
on wednesday , the most important mil@@ e@@ age was increased to 25 % of the flight .
a third party provider may not use the same flight route with fron@@ ti@@ er over 1000 miles to bring customers to the airport just 250 miles .
passengers can also only travel by direct purchase on the fron@@ ti@@ er site .
fronti@@ er has a loy@@ al customer base and is a reliable partner for the global financial markets .
the proce@@ eds were received by 9 percent and the flight capacity was shr@@ in@@ king to just 13 percent in the first quarter , as was rightly stated in the financial report published on wednesday by the parent company .
republic@@ an has tried to make a profit as part of the company &apos;s sales .
pro@@ ver@@ bs come from the bi@@ ble , and they are from the bi@@ ble .
more than 40 women attended the last women &apos;s breakfast this year in the ev@@ angel@@ ical church community of bis@@ ingen .
theme of the day in the municip@@ al house were &quot; pro@@ ver@@ bs from the bi@@ ble &quot; and &quot; re@@ de@@ mp@@ tions from the middle ages &quot; .
z@@ ita kö@@ h@@ ler , the chairman of the church council , has gone to the city after breakfast in a lec@@ ture on the bi@@ b@@ lic@@ al pro@@ ver@@ bs .
&quot; pro@@ ver@@ bs contain life@@ -@@ wis@@ dom , rules , or war@@ nings , &quot; she explained .
she compared several pro@@ ver@@ bs with the corresponding bi@@ ble places and explained the importance .
she called it pro@@ ver@@ bs like : hol@@ z@@ au@@ ge is vig@@ il@@ ant , like sc@@ ales fall from the eyes , an eye on someone who gives his hands to the lord in sleep , his hands in un@@ guil@@ ty .
several times , the depu@@ ty left her audience with advice that the project would be a case of a “ good old man ” .
the words from the middle ages were used to refer to the church community office of christ de@@ hn@@ er .
it explained the importance and origin of the speeches you made &apos; brid@@ ges to the past &apos; .
finally , a ra@@ ff@@ le was lost .
the prices were covered by a table and were hum@@ or@@ ously wra@@ pped around before they were sold to the winners .
among the visitors of the breakfast round , the choice of the may@@ or ro@@ man wag@@ ner was also mixed .
learning instead of unemployed : pilot project for un@@ skilled workers in tourism .
at the mec@@ k@@ len@@ bur@@ g@@ is@@ ches see@@ plat@@ te star@@ te@@ the@@ u@@ te a pilot project for the tourism industry .
under the leadership of the federal employment agency , 49 women and men who have already been recognised as un@@ skilled in the industry are to be able to become skilled workers for hotels and restaurants over three winter months .
&quot; new to this is that the six@@ -@@ month courses with ab@@ sch@@ l@@ uss ended , &quot; said car@@ men wi@@ ec@@ her@@ t of the employment agency neu@@ brand@@ enburg .
the benefits are varied : participants would thus not be unemployed , the firms would be given a training place , and the companies would be increasingly involved in hotels and restaurants .
the project also involves the industrial and commercial cham@@ bers in neu@@ brand@@ enburg , as well as the german hotel and restaurant association .
n@@ sa explains that an “ internal error ” and not h@@ ack@@ ers are to blame for the cr@@ ash of the site .
the sh@@ ad@@ ow@@ y national security agency explained at the late friday that a bug has been discovered by your public website for a few hours and not h@@ ack@@ ers , as was claimed online .
“ n@@ sa@@ .@@ go@@ v was a few hours out of reach ton@@ ight , as during a planned update an internal error occurred . ”
i will not solve the problem this evening .
the claim that the failure was caused by a distributed trial of den@@ ial of service , which was carried out by the d@@ dos , was not true .
in the early evening hours , online server tracking was a matter of course that the n@@ sa@@ -@@ website had at least six hours of un@@ reach@@ able for some users .
previously , a spo@@ kes@@ man for the n@@ sa stated to ab@@ c news that the eu ’ s sensitive internal network was “ in no way com@@ promised . ”
secret information is not in danger , according to the spo@@ kes@@ man .
at least one group of h@@ ack@@ ti@@ vi@@ sts claimed to have been the n@@ sa website with a d@@ dos attack la@@ h@@ ti .
in such attacks , the target site is linked to page views .
cy@@ ber@@ tac@@ tics are relatively simple , and the attacks are not intended to inter@@ f@@ ere with the internal network of the target system .
the former super@@ -@@ secret n@@ sa , whose n@@ ick@@ name was no su@@ ch agency ( no such authority ) , was found in the middle of the light of day in the public eye and is looking at the events that have been announced in recent months .
the growing contro@@ vers@@ y over the intelligence services has fu@@ el@@ ed initial spec@@ ulation about the possibility of the incident being the result of a targeted cy@@ per@@ operation .
slightly lo@@ wered is the number of people without jobs in october at 22 on 1,@@ 30@@ 7 .
although the quota is 3.@@ 1 % better than last year , and the rate is better than in september , &quot; we would have liked to have had more , &quot; says mon@@ i@@ ka fel@@ der@@ -@@ bau@@ er , depu@@ ty managing director of the agency .
many companies respon@@ ded to this with at@@ titu@@ des .
one reason for this is , according to fel@@ der@@ -@@ bau@@ er , &quot; we have few skilled workers in the cra@@ fts , health and care of the elderly &quot; .
seas@@ onal vari@@ ations have been taking place since september for staff in the hotel and restaurant sector .

profit losses in bom@@ bar@@ d@@ ments following the fall in supply and orders for the first time in the united states , following a decline in supply and orders .
the can@@ a@@ dian aircraft and railway manufacturer bom@@ bar@@ di@@ er in@@ c mel@@ de@@ t reported a 15@@ -@@ percent drop in the volume of net gains in the next quarter , having been off@@ set by dec@@ lining orders and deli@@ veries for aircraft in the third quarter .
bom@@ bar@@ di@@ er , based in mon@@ tre@@ al , also did not publish flight test data for his brand new aircraft of the c@@ series and did not issue any new information as to whether the aircraft was in operation in accordance with the ambitious timetable for next september .
on the ma@@ ide@@ n flight of the test aircraft a month and a half ago , only three more laun@@ ches have been carried out so far , which makes it question@@ able whether the test phase is going on as planned .
the results were not yet clear , and the results led to a change in the course of more than eight percent of the tor@@ onto stock exchange .
camer@@ on do@@ er@@ k@@ sen , analy@@ st at national bank financial , sen@@ ds a negative equity rating on thursday .
“ while weak@@ er supply numbers were not comp@@ en@@ sa@@ ted for as much by aircraft , the market ’ s margin@@ al development in the transport sector clearly dis@@ ap@@ points us , ” said do@@ er@@ k@@ sen in a customer letter .
we believe that the bom@@ bing of the ground has created new orders for the c@@ series , if the test programme for the aircraft is progres@@ sing .
if , however , no new orders are announced in the coming months , we expect the market to follow the programme with s@@ cep@@ tical s@@ cep@@ tic@@ ism .
bom@@ bar@@ di@@ er hopes that the aircraft travel will be more efficient and more efficient in the sub@@ ur@@ b of the market .
the first test aircraft was launched in march and was flying to the united states after months of delays .
but , so far , binding orders for c@@ series with 17@@ 7 moderate , as potential customers are waiting for the results of the flight tests and want to see if the claims of the company regarding fuel efficiency and cost savings are the new d@@ üs@@ sel@@ dorf jet .
there are currently 4@@ 03 orders and commitments from 15 customers and companies .
the chairman of the board , pi@@ er@@ re beau@@ do@@ in , is confident that bom@@ bar@@ di@@ er will achieve its goal of 300 binding orders at the start of commercial use of the jet .
the management assured the company that on thursday , the analy@@ sts and the media also assured that the programme was in the schedule .
“ the test aircraft is no longer on the ground than expected , ” said beau@@ do@@ in at a conference call and added that , while the stand@@ still of the aircraft was ground tests .
each manufacturer plans differently .
we have decided to take the first flight and then take a re@@ working period .
this is happening throughout the programme .
the second of five test aircraft is expected to be delivered in the next few weeks , the remaining shortly there@@ after , it was called from the company &apos;s side .
however , analy@@ sts remain s@@ cep@@ tical about whether twelve months after the ma@@ ide@@ n flight the first customer is to fly a c@@ series aircraft .
bom@@ bar@@ di@@ er said that it was re@@ viewing the planning for the commission@@ ing ( ice ) and will present it in the coming months .
“ the slow progress of the airlines ’ test – even if it appears to be bom@@ bar@@ di@@ er ’ s internal planning – rein@@ forces our view that the launch of the aircraft is limited to the first quarter of 20@@ 15 , ” said do@@ er@@ k@@ her@@ r .
in the third quarter , at the end of september , bom@@ bar@@ di@@ er ’ s net profit fell to $ 14@@ 7 million , or 8 c@@ ents per share of $ 17@@ 2 million , or 9 c@@ ents per share in the previous year .
the custom@@ ised profit per share is un@@ changed 9 c@@ ents .
sales were slightly lower than in the previous year , and fell from 4.@@ 2 % to 4.@@ 1 billion dollars .
analy@@ sts had a profit of 10 c@@ ents per share and a tur@@ nover of 4.@@ 56 billion dollars .
the world &apos;s fourth largest aircraft manufacturer is indic@@ ating that it has achieved a 45 % increase in the number of aircraft in this quarter , a decre@@ ase of 57 last year .
net orders fell by € 8@@ 3 billion from 8@@ 3 aircraft to € 26@@ . the order was then adjusted to € 2@@ 6.@@ 4 billion .
the order book in the aero@@ space industry was down to € 3@@ 4.@@ 5 billion on 30 september and was therefore down from € 3@@ 1.@@ 9 billion on 31 december .
“ in the field of aero@@ space , the results were in line with our specifications , but the low order in@@ take and market relations overall were dis@@ appoin@@ ting , ” said beau@@ do@@ in .
sales in the aero@@ space industry increased by € 2.@@ 2 billion to € 2.@@ 2 billion .
bom@@ bar@@ di@@ er , the world &apos;s largest railway manufacturer , announced that sales in this sa@@ tel@@ li@@ te-@@ related sector were almost 11 % up to $ 2.@@ 1 billion .
the order book in the transport sector was € 3@@ 9.@@ 4 billion on 30 september and was thus lower than december 31 , 2009 .
the profit margin@@ s in the transport sector were reduced by processing problems with some major contracts .
according to the management , the fourth quarter of the company will have new requirements .
in the after@@ no@@ ons trading on thursday , the bom@@ bar@@ di@@ er share increased by 8.@@ 5 percent and was 4.@@ 8@@ 3 can@@ a@@ dian dollars , after the announcement was also made that the google index was down from patri@@ ck pic@@ k .
the braz@@ ili@@ an embr@@ ace sa , the world &apos;s third largest commercial aircraft manufacturer , and bom@@ bar@@ di@@ ers of the clo@@ s@@ est ri@@ vals , reported on thursday a 10 % increase in the quar@@ ter@@ ly profit .
usa : sho@@ ts at the airport of los angel@@ es
an unknown has discovered a new version of the game on friday morning ( local time ) at la@@ x airport sch@@ üs@@ se .
while airport management is controlled by short-@@ time news , t@@ wit@@ ter is telling us that students are not able to get hold of the shi@@ eld , the &quot; los angel@@ es times &quot; reported , the man was dead .
a security man was killed , too .
media reported that the government has been in@@ ju@@ red .
us president bar@@ ack obama will be constantly talking about the situation , said the spo@@ kes@@ man of the white house , j@@ ay car@@ ney .
the incident occurred in the terminal of the third e@@ ye@@ wit@@ nesses indicated that they were protecting them with a gun in one of the departure h@@ alls .
a travell@@ er told the station c@@ n@@ n that many people had been in pan@@ ic protection , but they were not .
travellers would have been sh@@ ab@@ by and children .
among the waiting se@@ iz@@ ures , pan@@ ic er@@ up@@ ted , many would have liked to have hi@@ d behind chairs in fear .
he has two sho@@ ts , says a travell@@ er of &quot; los angel@@ es times &quot; .
a security authority official t@@ sa has a shot in@@ jury at the foot .
the scene is &quot; as in a movie &quot; .
after that he himself was placed in a security area , reported the man .
the sho@@ ts should be placed near a safety control area .
airport buildings ev@@ ac@@ u@@ ated by air , the hotel ev@@ ac@@ u@@ ates the air conditioning , and the hotel is ev@@ ac@@ u@@ ated by the air conditioning .
on television scre@@ ens , we saw many hospit@@ als and police cars flo@@ ating in front of a terminal .
hundreds of people were dis@@ placed from the building .
users on t@@ wit@@ ter published photos of a special mission command and a team based on the ground .
as the airport management said on t@@ wit@@ ter , the first day of the incident began at 9.@@ 30 a.m. ( local time ) .
the access roads were bloc@@ ked and the road was closed , which according to c@@ n@@ n allowed for a long time .
except for land@@ ings , air traffic is tempor@@ arily stopped , but it was said .
however , c@@ n@@ n also has several plan@@ es at launch .
terminal 3 will be mainly used by smaller us airlines .

co@@ ca@@ ine dependent law@@ yer , who is a drug bo@@ ss before police investigation war@@ ned that he was in prison .
bas@@ har@@ at d@@ it@@ ta , 42 , gave information to under@@ world size ne@@ il scar@@ bor@@ ough further .
the law@@ yer was afraid to have his secret drug ad@@ diction sh@@ ut down .
it was developed by the li@@ ver@@ pool cro@@ wn court to three years in prison .
a well-known criminal def@@ en@@ der who has a drug bar@@ on in front of a large police investigation has been arrested for being afraid of his secret drug ad@@ diction .
bas@@ har@@ at d@@ it@@ ta , 42 , supplied under@@ world size ne@@ il scar@@ bor@@ ou@@ gh with sensitive information .
the report prepared by crimin@@ alists as “ first class ” is a good example of the sp@@ it@@ z name “ bas@@ h ” , which was launched in his house in 2011 , after the police had been handed over to scar@@ bor@@ ough , who was in a member .
officials observed a lack of sc@@ ar@@ bor@@ ou@@ gh ( 32 ) three bo@@ ws of co@@ ca@@ ine at the house of the law@@ yer in black@@ bur@@ n , lan@@ cas@@ hire , ab@@ be@@ y , while this was with colleagues at a meal .
the investigation bro@@ ke out that the dis@@ honest and un@@ popular use of class a drugs was a common oc@@ curren@@ ce in d@@ it@@ ta &apos;s tests .
over a period of eight months between january and august 2011 , he tried to dis@@ semin@@ ate un@@ authorized information about the arrest of two men on behalf of scar@@ bor@@ ough and one of his partners .
all four susp@@ ects were arrested at that time by the police in a major investigation into the her@@ o@@ in and co@@ ca@@ ine trade in lan@@ ca@@ sian .
together with 32 other people , they were later arrested after the police had taken action on a number of home sear@@ ches her@@ o@@ in and co@@ ca@@ ine worth 1.5 million p@@ ounds and 200@@ ,000 p@@ ounds of cash .
d@@ it@@ ta , 42 , gave information to the crimin@@ als further because he fe@@ ared that his drug ad@@ diction could be public@@ ized .
today , d@@ it@@ ta , who is responsible for the for@@ bes soli@@ ci@@ ators law firm in black@@ bur@@ n , was born at li@@ ver@@ pool cro@@ wn court , after a three-@@ week stay in the law firm .
he gave an interview to the committee on the environment , public health and consumer policy .
the law@@ yer was transferred to the court after the police had been given the right to investigate scar@@ bor@@ ough .
two investig@@ ators were arrested and sent@@ enced to death .
shortly after he was taken off the drugs , he tele@@ ph@@ oned scar@@ bor@@ ough regularly with d@@ it@@ ta , who had been in the football sta@@ dium of black@@ bur@@ n road .
the law@@ yer returned to his home , holding a post , and then leaving the court nine communications between the two .
in court it became known that d@@ it@@ ta was a “ regular consumer ” of ko@@ k@@ ain .
d@@ it@@ ta was later arrested , st@@ aged but de@@ ported to co@@ ca@@ ine and said that he had been arrested with the alleg@@ ed de@@ al .
during his arrest , d@@ it@@ ta took his wal@@ let and tried to find a number of credit cards .
in the case of police inter@@ ro@@ gation he stated that he was operating under his private address as well as at the work@@ place an office and clients would be prosecu@@ ted at home for legal matters .
in court it became known that he was key players in the drug trade , some of whom he had previously represented , after significant ar@@ re@@ sts and informed that he was doing what the investig@@ ators were saying about them .
prosecu@@ tor anne w@@ hy@@ te said : “ a criminal case is not a matter of jud@@ g@@ ement , but of knowing that the law is not broken . ”
d@@ it@@ ta will not be able to escape the abuse of his position as a criminal def@@ en@@ der , because he is too concerned with certain clients .
the relationship in question is not simply that of a drug deal@@ er , but of a drug deal@@ er who has lost his law@@ yer with drugs .
part of his communications was undoubtedly legitimate , because he was the leader of the party .
but that went far beyond the limits of a normal relationship between law@@ yer and client .

he was responsible for the legal affairs of certain clients , in particular scar@@ bor@@ ough , and he allowed them to be com@@ promised .

but , after the hearing , super@@ int@@ ent le@@ e hal@@ ste@@ ad said that the police in lan@@ cas@@ hire said : ‘ mr d@@ it@@ ta has taken the step from a criminal def@@ en@@ der to a criminal at the moment when he was fing@@ er .
his co@@ ca@@ ine dependence has led to a ho@@ p@@ eless com@@ promising and has made him sus@@ cep@@ tible to the mo@@ tives of leading members of organised crime who have entr@@ usted him with providing valuable information on police investigations .

revolutionary new work of the church music
i have received six motions for resolutions tabled to wind up the celebr@@ ation of its 16@@ 0-@@ year existence .
after the great success of the musi@@ c@@ als &quot; rock my life &quot; , which the audience at the spring of this year was enthusi@@ astic , the song contest will be the end of the anniversary .
on saturday 26 october , the european parliament will host this extraordinary fair from 19 during the evening fair in st. mar@@ tin@@ sk@@ ir@@ che dun@@ n@@ ingen and on sunday , 26 october .
the so-called deutsche mes@@ se with its original title &quot; sing@@ ing for celebr@@ ation of the holy opera &quot; is a new event .
the fair will be held at the services of the church , as the client jo@@ han@@ n phili@@ p@@ p neu@@ mann intended .
under the direction of her@@ mann sch@@ nei@@ der , the cho@@ ir is composed of the group of members of the fun@@ k@@ vere@@ in fro@@ h@@ sin@@ n ten@@ n@@ en@@ br@@ on@@ n and no@@ em@@ i lo@@ ko@@ di at the or@@ gan .
has@@ l@@ ach : s@@ cep@@ tic@@ ism is increasingly diver@@ ting confidence from the rest of the world .
with the election of the par@@ ish council in 20@@ 15 , for example , the sa@@ il@@ or unit has@@ l@@ ach ( se ) will change fundament@@ ally .
there is only one common p@@ far@@ r community service , for all six par@@ ish counc@@ ils .
in a joint meeting , on saturday , the bodies from ha@@ z@@ el@@ nu@@ t , ho@@ f@@ ste@@ t@@ ten , m@@ ü@@ h@@ len@@ bach , fis@@ cher@@ bach , ste@@ in@@ ach and wel@@ sch@@ en@@ stein prepared for the changes .
because the fundamental decisions taken by the di@@ oc@@ ese are not the same as those taken by the di@@ oc@@ ese , and it is up to the par@@ ish authorities to implement them as satisfac@@ tor@@ ily as possible .
during the day , it became particularly clear that the s@@ cep@@ tic@@ ism about the new approach is re@@ luc@@ t@@ ant but increasingly confident .
from the ideas and expectations of the innovations in 20@@ 15 to concrete proposals on the future composition and future size of the par@@ ish church , we are not enough .
regional de@@ an geor@@ g sch@@ mit@@ t explained how the project was re@@ con@@ ceived by the german government to help the se@@ af@@ are@@ rs in the arch@@ di@@ oc@@ ese of fre@@ i@@ burg .
the se ham@@ let is then the church community of the european communities .
it will only be a common par@@ ish council , and a temporary committee .
from each par@@ ish , at least two elected members are to be represented , in the six par@@ ish churches , the local so-called comm@@ on@@ wealth teams are formed .
their task will be to make the church and the state more transparent and more transparent .
on the question of the finances of the individual par@@ ish community , considerable progress was made in consultation .
the innovations provide that the targeted information is used to cover the costs of the par@@ ish .
the li@@ abilities , on the other hand , go to the entire municip@@ ality .
it is precisely in view of the large investments that are planned , the obligation of which is then applied to all par@@ ishes , that there have been major concerns .
&quot; even in the past , only investments were made that were not carried out by the individual par@@ ish families alone .
practical experience with a joint body for five par@@ ish groups illu@@ str@@ ate the bar@@ b@@ arian k@@ nights who were the chairman of the board in the se@@ al@@ sor@@ ge@@ unity sch@@ ut@@ ter@@ wal@@ d-@@ ne@@ ur@@ ried .
they had committed themselves to the task of &apos; becoming one , five &apos; in 2006 and found that this was not so easy .
the bodies of has@@ l@@ ach sa@@ il@@ ors made their way to the world of war@@ craft to discuss the future composition and size of the common par@@ ish council and the practical work of the community teams .
the commission &apos;s work will be more concrete in further meetings and will be discussed at another joint meeting of all six bodies next spring .
in the end , par@@ ish church council michael sch@@ ö@@ ner , from ste@@ in@@ ach , presented the new logo of the sou@@ l@@ sor@@ ge unit , which was approved by a significant majority .
in p@@ f@@ ul@@ l@@ endor@@ f , the electricity is produced more expensive than the electricity produced by the local power stations .
the citizens are sh@@ y about the need to move to higher electricity costs .
as the managing director of stad@@ tw@@ er@@ ke j@@ ör@@ g-@@ ar@@ ne bi@@ as , has said , in front of the south cou@@ ri@@ er , a four-@@ head@@ ed p@@ f@@ ul@@ l@@ endor@@ fer family is 70 to 90 euro extra costs per year .
the main reason for the forthcoming price increase is the increase in so-called ed@@ f surve@@ ys of 5.@@ 2 % of the total cost of the project .
this lev@@ y is paid every october by the four operators of the major power stations in the netherlands .
this figure is the number of people who have been made redun@@ dant as a result of the energy change that they will be able to raise through a charge on electricity prices .
the city ’ s p@@ f@@ ul@@ l@@ endor@@ f municip@@ al works are the last link in this chain .
the supervisory board of the energy company was not sufficiently aware in its forec@@ asts of a higher lev@@ y , as j@@ ör@@ g-@@ ar@@ ne bi@@ as has pointed out .
now , the specific figures would have to be calculated before the urban units next week inform their customers about the exact price increase .
&quot; we are starting to increase from 1 cent plus x , &quot; said the president of the european union , who is more near the 2 c@@ ents .
at the traffic lights on permanent red : waiting time , pay attention to the time of waiting .
sometimes an lights are simply not green .
the contact loo@@ p in the street does not respond , or the light sign is def@@ ec@@ tive .
what , then , should be done - in red ?
if a person has had enough time to stop at a red light and the inter@@ section is free , he can continue to explain the stop of stutt@@ gart right away .
the waiting time must be &quot; reasonable &quot; .
bec@@ ker advis@@ es at least five minutes to break out before a function break@@ down is reported .
if you want to see the red light , you have to be in mind that the road is not suitable for a loss of life .
those who have stayed less than five minutes are waiting for not much time to wait , but bec@@ ker and point out a decision by the supreme court of ha@@ iti .
in the negotiated case , a driver had to leave the car after about three minutes of permanent red and had to stand for a neglig@@ ent red light .
the traffic lights were not def@@ ec@@ tive , they were jum@@ ping a little later on to green .
a driving ban remained in place because of the special situation - the money was not paid .
municip@@ al council is pleased about sound budgets and a solid budget .
whenever there is a local council meeting , it is the council that has the power to act .
the municip@@ al s@@ ack in her@@ d@@ w@@ ang@@ en-@@ sch@@ ö@@ n@@ ach is well filled and deb@@ ts have been un@@ aware of the administration since 2005 .
the financial year 2012 can also be used as a full success in this respect .
this was not taken into account when presenting the accounts for 2012 .
as andre@@ a ro@@ th@@ mun@@ d explained , it is the administrative budget with around eur 7.@@ 6 million that is over a million euros higher than was planned .
the sur@@ plus of the administrative budget also amounts to around eur 1.@@ 8 million , which is about eur 1 million .
the fact that the european union has sur@@ plus is mainly due to higher business tax revenue and the community share of income tax .
the asset budget was again significantly above the planned value .
instead of the eur 1.5 million envis@@ aged , it was eur 2.5 million last year .
&quot; this is mainly due to the higher input from the administrative budget , &quot; says ro@@ th@@ mun@@ d .
as the financial year 2012 saw a reduction in investment than was planned , it is also necessary to reduce the amount of re@@ funds .
overall , the overall reserve was eur 2.@@ 1 million reduced to a total of eur 4.@@ 9 million now .
may@@ or r@@ alp@@ h ger@@ ster than@@ ked the german government for their support in ro@@ th@@ mun@@ d and their team .
&quot; such a work sha@@ kes the balance not just from the sle@@ eve , &quot; p@@ raised ger@@ ster with a view to the annual accounts .
he and the local counc@@ ils were delighted to see the good figures .
it may seem par@@ ado@@ x@@ ical , but it is these good figures that will soon cost the public dear .
the good financial situation has allowed the community to gain a high level of le@@ verage in the past .
this , in turn , means that more than one subsid@@ y from the country has been cut off , according to ger@@ ster .
for these grants from various member states , the commission has already provided the necessary resources .
among other things , cities and communities that receive subsidies must be able to use certain le@@ vers .
&quot; the theme of lif@@ ting sets we have to look at , as in the years to come there are investments for which we would like to receive subsidies , &quot; ger@@ ster announced in this connection .
n@@ ag@@ old : hu@@ go wer@@ m@@ ter has been in the cho@@ ir for 60 years in the cho@@ ir of the cho@@ ir for 60 years .
at the age of 60 he is a sing@@ er , and he is a history of the male sing@@ er association ca@@ ec@@ ili@@ a almost twice as long as that of the her@@ b@@ s@@ fest , where he is celebr@@ ating his sole@@ m@@ n birth@@ day .
hu@@ bert wer@@ m@@ ter stood as usual in the colors of his male voc@@ alist , the &quot; k@@ ni@@ fe &quot; .
after 60 years , he is still able to sing with the now more than ever rec@@ alled cho@@ ir .

he is grateful for his commitment and his uni@@ form@@ ity in receiving several awards : j@@ ör@@ g ko@@ hr , pa@@ stor@@ al speaker on behalf of the ca@@ ec@@ ili@@ an association ro@@ t@@ ten@@ bur@@ g-@@ stutt@@ gar@@ t , translated by the german language .
his sing@@ er &apos;s colleagues gave him the great@@ ness of the german cho@@ ir association .
in addition to the hon@@ or , the 3@@ 1st autumn festival was held in the usual tracks : with the m@@ g@@ v be@@ tra , the song cr@@ ane salz@@ ste@@ t@@ ten , the sing@@ er ’ s department ba@@ is@@ ingen and the local music department .
the m@@ g@@ v full mar@@ in@@ gen opened its doors with atmo@@ sp@@ her@@ ic songs such as &quot; in the we@@ in@@ parad@@ ises &quot; and &quot; fun@@ ny , her bro@@ thers &quot; .
the hon@@ or@@ ary sing@@ er hu@@ bert wer@@ m@@ ter prepared a special dinner for her hon@@ or - wol@@ f@@ gan@@ g am@@ ade@@ us moz@@ art &apos;s &quot; bun@@ des@@ song &quot; .
the male sing@@ er ’ s association be@@ tra also san@@ g classical ch@@ oral songs such as “ j@@ ä@@ ger@@ wer@@ ben ” by ju@@ li@@ us w@@ eng@@ ert , “ far , far away ” by hu@@ bert go@@ is@@ er@@ n and the fol@@ k song .
the song cr@@ ane salz@@ ste@@ t@@ ten caused a great deal of trouble with his mixed cho@@ ir and his group of women - the &quot; imp@@ ul@@ se gate &quot; - for the women &apos;s quota of the festival .
the joint ch@@ or@@ us was ab@@ duc@@ ted by the ne@@ apo@@ lit@@ an fol@@ k &quot; santa lu@@ cia &quot; and &quot; evi@@ va esp@@ ana &quot; from an@@ tos gu@@ s in foreign languages .
the sing@@ er section of the b@@ ail@@ ing sports club came with &quot; what is@@ ch the sw@@ ing ? &quot; from han@@ s s@@ ü@@ s@@ sm@@ u@@ th and robert pap@@ per@@ ts &quot; bi@@ er@@ li@@ ed &quot; .
for the children there was a small additional program - &quot; grand@@ ma h@@ anne &quot; ali@@ as h@@ ann@@ el@@ ore st@@ ol@@ ste@@ im@@ er introduced a kas@@ pers@@ ky theatre and read a few stories , which the children had to write about good at noon .

ken@@ y@@ an press is ou@@ tr@@ aged by controversial media law .
“ we are in a da@@ un@@ ting situation , and we must not be surprised what is the position of parliament in the future of simply taking the judicial independence away from it ? ” was indeed the case in the newspaper which published the bill .
“ the law is dr@@ ac@@ on@@ ian and very pun@@ ish@@ able and we refuse to do so , ” cy@@ r@@ us kam@@ au , managing director of the capital group , who also includes capital international .
he said that the new media tri@@ bun@@ al “ will always be pre@@ ju@@ dic@@ ed , because it is an extended arm of the government ” , and restric@@ tion on content and advertising would be imposed on ken@@ ya ’ s position in the global economy .
“ i hope the president will listen to us and we appeal to him to take this draft law to the floor and to return to parliament , ” he said .
according to the star newspaper , the government is taking a new law , “ the media effectively into a str@@ ang@@ le@@ hold ” , while the standard , democracy and freedom of speech in ken@@ ya would have “ suffered a severe b@@ low ” and ordered .
the adoption of the law is part of a series of measures aimed at improving national security following the events of 11 september 2001 , following the attacks by armed islam@@ ists on the west gate shopping centre .
ken@@ y@@ an media moved the r@@ age of the authorities to the point that they wanted to take rec@@ ord@@ ings of security cameras that showed that the government was not taking part in the crime .
polic@@ em@@ en david ki@@ ma@@ i@@ y@@ o respon@@ ded with the introduction of two new journalists and a leading media representative .
under the new law , media houses can be sent@@ enced to 20 million ken@@ y@@ an sch@@ ill@@ ings .
the tri@@ bun@@ al has also the right to susp@@ end the pos@@ session of those affected if a penalty is not paid .
according to daily nation , “ even a single penalty can kill most radio stations in the bank@@ rup@@ t@@ cy . ”
moreover , the newspaper believes that this measure could be a dam@@ ning effect on the health of the people who describe it as “ lively blo@@ go@@ sphere ” ken@@ ya .
if you want to silence the media , you could be un@@ pun@@ ished by politicians , whatever they want .
“ no one will ever know , ” he wrote , “ the story of mu@@ t@@ um@@ a ma@@ thi@@ u , a journ@@ alist at the nation that per@@ ceived the ken@@ y@@ an media as a decisive control factor in public life .
“ if politicians are left to their own devices , they will lead the country into bank@@ rup@@ t@@ cy and back to the hun@@ ters and collec@@ tors ’ era , ” he comm@@ ented .

a more pleasant party atmosphere was achieved on the saturday of last saturday .

this was done to the musicians who had the fe@@ st@@ act fr@@ amed the same way as many speakers .

more gre@@ e@@ ting words were given to the municip@@ al sports committee hu@@ bert ba@@ i@@ er , the district chairman of the south ba@@ den football association , kun@@ o k@@ ay@@ an , and fried@@ rich k@@ nor@@ r of the planning office , the minister .
may@@ or k@@ lu@@ mp@@ p remin@@ ded us that rec@@ ur@@ ring weather events are not the cause of the crisis in the spring and autumn .
as long as 15 years ago , there was the first thought about solving the problem when a third place was built at the football club site or at the real school at sal@@ in@@ en@@ see .
both were rein@@ stated .
six years ago , thoughts came to the establishment of an artificial tur@@ f sports ground , which was generally considered the ultimate solution .
concrete plans were put forward two years ago , when the f@@ c announced the ch@@ ill@@ er ’ s stu@@ be in a here@@ d@@ it@@ ary le@@ ase , a 100 000 euro contribution to the construction of the course and the country received funding of eur 10@@ 4 000 .

kon@@ stan@@ z : bloc@@ king after accident at the sch@@ än@@ z@@ le@@ kre@@ is@@ el .
the accident was one of the most serious in the world , according to the police , when a 51 year old driver of a swiss seat i@@ bi@@ za was on thursday evening , around 8 p.m. , on the left lan@@ e of the two-@@ lan@@ e rich@@ -@@ aus@@ ch@@ au@@ stras@@ se .
shortly before the roun@@ d@@ about at the sch@@ än@@ z@@ le he noticed that he was on the left side of the road in the direction of stro@@ me@@ y@@ er@@ s@@ dor@@ f@@ stra@@ ß@@ e and moved to the right lan@@ e .
this was followed by the cl@@ ash with the bmw 1 series cou@@ p@@ é driving there .
the same damage was done to the engine which is driving behind the bmw , the v@@ w pass@@ at of a 19@@ -@@ year-@@ old .
in total , around 15@@ 000 material damage ar@@ ose , the police informed .
the road had to be re@@ built during the accident .
vienna airport creates passenger calls from the airport from the time of the flight .
mr ma@@ i@@ er , please come to gate 24 .
through how this will make it more difficult for the future to find a way out at vienna airport .
much of the speakers are delivered in a way that is not always as nois@@ y as it is .
a more relaxed atmosphere to create is the goal of this innovation .
like airport spo@@ kes@@ man peter kle@@ em@@ ann on radio vienna , the report follows the vienna airport with the c@@ ess@@ ation of break@@ through@@ s affecting individuals , an international trend .
for example , the commission has already decided to aband@@ on the airports in copenhagen , frankfurt or du@@ ba@@ i , for example .
the elimin@@ ation of these break@@ through@@ s - on average , these are being around 200 personal calls on the part of the speakers in one day - is intended to make it more quiet at the airport in the future .
&quot; it has also become apparent in experience that these individual through@@ s are relatively little per@@ ceived , while at the same time all other information on changed flight as@@ c@@ ents or departure times here is a bit lost &quot; , so kle@@ em@@ ann said .
high@@ lan@@ der games on the kal@@ ten@@ hof are a great way to get to know the world of the kal@@ ten@@ hof .
in addition to the bra@@ ke wag@@ on pul@@ ling with trac@@ tors , the autumn festival on the kal@@ ten@@ hof from 6 to 8 september also has a second competition .
on saturday , september 7@@ th , start at 1.@@ 30 p.m. the high@@ lan@@ der games .
they have a scot@@ tish tradition , but they are not on the kal@@ ten@@ hof sch@@ w@@ ä@@ bis@@ ch .
teams and sol@@ ic@@ itors are measured in the discipl@@ ines tree stem thro@@ ats , ho@@ o@@ k-@@ thro@@ ats and water bu@@ bb@@ les .
four and a half metres is the tree tr@@ un@@ k long and 25 to 30 kil@@ o@@ gram@@ s heavy .
&quot; it doesn &apos;t matter to the width , &quot; explains organiz@@ er peter sa@@ ile .
the tri@@ be must be ver@@ tically dis@@ car@@ ded , should be over@@ thro@@ wn and then just lie to the ground .
this is not the case with most of the points .
the hor@@ s@@ es@@ ho@@ e thro@@ wing is based on the target accuracy .
from 8 metres distance , a pl@@ uck is thro@@ wn on .
sk@@ ill and strength must be the key to the success of the water@@ bu@@ cket we@@ aring .
time and water in a bot@@ tle are measured at the end .
from each cl@@ an , or from team , may then two people participate in the individual competition .
the winners of the team and individual competition will receive pri@@ zes .
the training can be done from 10 am .
the desired solution is to wear a mat@@ ching clothes , for example , the sco@@ ot@@ ers can take part in the ro@@ ck@@ -@@ and-@@ roll rac@@ es .
but sch@@ w@@ ä@@ bis@@ chen we@@ aring we@@ aring we@@ aring we@@ aring we@@ aring is also allowed .
for &quot; out@@ fit &quot; , the company awards the jury a few bonus points .
you can register until a hour before the competition .
with the scot@@ tish sw@@ ab@@ ian high@@ land wind farms , and the tr@@ ac@@ tor@@ -@@ pow@@ der , which is half a hour earlier , we are on the main@@ land of the festival on saturday .
in the evening , the friends of the b@@ low@@ ing music will be pleased to enjoy .
at 7 p.m. , bi@@ ra@@ -@@ bo@@ hem@@ ian b@@ low@@ ing music from sch@@ ö@@ m@@ berg will make the big evening of entertainment .
the cha@@ pel plays fleet pol@@ ka and mar@@ ches .
to her reper@@ to@@ ire , however , emo@@ tional wal@@ tz and a sa@@ ti@@ r@@ ical big band sound are also part of her reper@@ to@@ ire .
with the new version , the new version of the album will be released on the german market .
in dor@@ n@@ h@@ an he is present at the christmas market and at the fo@@ ol@@ ish ton@@ gue .
on sunday , the musi@@ k@@ vere@@ in le@@ in@@ ste@@ t@@ ten main@@ tains a group of artists for breakfast , from 2 p.m. on the bau@@ haus cha@@ pel b@@ ö@@ n@@ ingen is a guest and the &quot; ol@@ dies &quot; will then sound the festival .
the start of the race is already on friday , the sto@@ pp@@ el@@ ack@@ er party with d@@ j r@@ al@@ f .
other programme points are available on saturday and sunday , including the ol@@ d@@ tim@@ er and sch@@ le@@ pper meeting , exhibitions of companies on the subject of agricultural and fore@@ stry .

milk and eg@@ g alternatives in overview
ve@@ gan nutri@@ tion requires vege@@ table alternatives to e@@ gg@@ s , milk and milk products .
p@@ ü@@ ri@@ ated to@@ f@@ u with plant cre@@ am is , for example , a quar@@ tz set .
another is the vege@@ t@@ arian and the world vege@@ t@@ arian day on november 1 .
the vege@@ t@@ arian germany proposes to take part in the world ve@@ gan day on november 1 a number of ve@@ gan alternatives :
pure plant mar@@ gar@@ ine is a good alternative to but@@ ter , yo@@ gur@@ t lag@@ er by so@@ y , and is a good alternative to but@@ ter .
instead of milk , so@@ ya , ha@@ irs , man@@ go and so@@ ya rice milk could be used .
fl@@ ora ju@@ ice that can be bur@@ ned replace conventional s@@ lic@@ es .
also to e@@ gg@@ s there are vege@@ table alternatives .
half a crus@@ hed , ri@@ pe ban@@ ana to say , can be used as a binding agent in a ca@@ ke .
even 50 gram@@ s of apple or a tab@@ les@@ po@@ on of gr@@ illed lun@@ ches are also available , plus three tab@@ les@@ po@@ ons of water .
loo@@ ser , the pa@@ stry is used instead of eg@@ g with a mix@@ ture of a tea spo@@ on ba@@ king pow@@ der , a spo@@ on of food star@@ ch and three tab@@ les@@ po@@ ons of min@@ eral water .

after eight hours of flight , we went straight to the bro@@ ok@@ ly@@ n bridge , which was the heart of the city , man@@ h@@ att@@ an , on foot .
here , the european parliament has already had a fascinating view of the world famous sky@@ line , which is in the evening light a special attr@@ action .
the time shift has meant that students have been on the br@@ ink for almost 24 hours , but in accordance with the mo@@ tto &quot; the city does not sleep &quot; the day was celebrated on times square .
despite shut@@ down , the second day the release of the stat@@ ue of liber@@ ty was reached with a fer@@ ry and on foot .
then we went to the financial centre around wall street to comm@@ em@@ or@@ ate the 11@@ th september .
on the third day , students were able to take a walk from the 3@@ 73 m high viewing platform of the empire state building .
then we went through the hec@@ tic hu@@ st@@ le and bu@@ st@@ le of the new york streets through the ro@@ c@@ ke@@ f@@ ell@@ er center to central park , which is an ideal opportunity to stay short in the autumn sun .
after a short flight from new york to bo@@ ston , students are now in their host families .
in this year , the name day of the holy hu@@ ber@@ tus will again be celebrated in the church of st. mari@@ en on the h@@ ul@@ s@@ ber@@ g@@ stra@@ ß@@ e .

the newly designed op@@ sch@@ l@@ ä@@ t@@ t sh@@ ines with a new café .
one that is for ling@@ ering and returning .
one that takes the name to the program .
when dé@@ j@@ à v@@ u is called the le@@ x@@ icon , a psycho@@ logical phenomenon that is reflected in the feeling of being able to create a new situation before or seen .
in case of a visit to the museum of the same name , the hotel will be able to provide you with a free ticket to the rhe@@ in-@@ wa@@ al university .
after all , the café has a beautiful name for it : a real stay not only followed by a re@@ ju@@ ven@@ ation of mind but also a hand@@ s-@@ on experience .
because it &apos;s fun and simply beautiful , it &apos;s a lot of fun .
a look into the interior of op@@ sch@@ la@@ g 8 gives the vie@@ wer a look at the image .
the ul@@ tra-@@ modern but not cool café bar ambi@@ ence looks like a place to feel good .
here , the team spo@@ ils the foun@@ ders mir@@ j@@ am van der st@@ el@@ t and dani@@ el b@@ ü@@ tt@@ ner at the top with a variety of coffee and tea specialities .
there are also delicious culinary deli@@ ghts or individually ordered fresh fish and sea@@ food .
the owners , both 33 years old , have already decided to make a statement on the hotel &apos;s website before the opening of the pretty op@@ sch@@ la@@ g caf@@ e : in k@@ ran@@ enburg they conducted the art lounge .
from moving to kle@@ ve to op@@ sch@@ la@@ g , the symp@@ t@@ oms of the day are the friendly caf@@ e lovers .
not least because of the university .
&quot; while we don &apos;t have a specific target group , &quot; dani@@ el b@@ ü@@ tt@@ ner emphasi@@ zes .
rather , the two young students here want to address just as much as senior citizens and all age groups in between .
speaking of caf@@ é@@ -@@ lovers , i have a great time in the city .
the friendly and informal owner of the hotel is behind the coffee pleasure .
enjoy the frag@@ rant hot and cold beer with a glass of wine in a variety of vari@@ ations .

two events gave it a lot in the bright café .
better said one .
the ha@@ f@@ enc@@ es@@ las festival took place outside rather than in the open air - the café dé@@ j@@ à v@@ u did not benefit from it .
but there was also the r@@ ing@@ el@@ nat@@ z evening .
&quot; nice , successful and fun@@ ny &quot; , the two 3@@ 3-@@ year-@@ ol@@ ds found .
but it is not everyone &apos;s business .
perhaps dani@@ el b@@ ü@@ tt@@ ner is not a strong sup@@ porter either because of the fact that he is a fan of event even@@ ings : &quot; you can &apos;t do it all right &quot; .
and with an event i always speak only those who are interested in the event .
this is why events will be the exception .
&quot; we want to make the very normal operation as little as possible &quot; .
is this : dé@@ j@@ à v@@ u also means reliable and reliable .
as regards the quality of products , which are offered here , as well as the team and the beautiful environment at the op@@ posi@@ t in kle@@ ve .
the road that is more and more turning into a gastronom@@ ic m@@ ile .

it was the 16@@ 5th meeting of the foundation to which the m@@ g@@ v fried@@ rich wil@@ hel@@ m din@@ ker was founded in the year .
in the club of the restaurant &quot; wi@@ do@@ w &quot; , the restaurant &quot; wit@@ te@@ bor@@ g &quot; , everyone enjoyed the harmon@@ ious co@@ existence completely in the sign of music .
tradi@@ tionally , the foundation festival is also the perfect occasion for the festival to attract hon@@ ors .

un proc@@ laim@@ s new goals at the fight against poverty .
the united nations is starting to draw up a series of new objectives , which will be able to meet the millennium goals announced twelve years ago .
in the run@@ -up to the un summit on sustainable development , which will take place in rio de jan@@ e@@ iro in the evening , austr@@ ali@@ an diplom@@ ats played a key role in pus@@ hing for “ sustainable development goals ” that will out@@ strip the millennium development goals in 20@@ 15 .
they were found in the final draft document , which was presented by world leaders .
un secre@@ tar@@ y-@@ general ban ki@@ -@@ moon declared at the evening at the summit that the time was right to “ over@@ ride national interests . ”
“ i am pleased that the member states have agreed to make the european union process more transparent and more transparent .
“ these goals are based on our progress from the millennium development goals , ” says dr. ru@@ dol@@ f sch@@ u@@ mann , ceo of s &amp; t ag , on the development framework after 20@@ 15 .
i will spare no effort to ensure that this document , which i am given by the member states , is implemented to strengthen our vision of sustainable development objectives , which are based on the success of the millennium goals . ”
although the s@@ g achi@@ m / ba@@ den has been in operation for four days , there is still a lot of confusion in the upper league of hand@@ ball players .
this is where tra@@ iner tom@@ as@@ z mal@@ mon leaves no doubt .
all remain fully motivated and willing to work with us .
i hope , however , that we can finally win again .
&quot; for i know of course no more how so a victory is tas@@ ted &quot; , he exp@@ ects mal@@ mon to be a success experience of his team .
although the third league countries reserve is being financed from fre@@ den@@ bec@@ k at the moment , the commission is still not raising any trees .
many players i have still been in a-@@ ju@@ g@@ end training .
therefore , they will be against their ex@@ -@@ co@@ ach in particular .
&quot; we must also wait to see if there is any further strengthening from the first , &quot; he explains .
to finally get back to the bottom of the success story , the mal@@ mon@@ -@@ team must be more committed to the future than it has been to previous appear@@ ances .
above all , in the coverage work and in the swit@@ ch@@ over game , it was quite hard to do .
the opportunities for exploitation must also definitely be improved .
i therefore hope that my players will be able to play the game out of their heads during the short break .
security concerns in moz@@ ambi@@ que are growing in the face of cl@@ ash@@ es between influ@@ ential figures and the opposition from the opposition parties .
thousands of people gathered in the centre of ma@@ pu@@ to among the vig@@ il@@ ant eyes of the stat@@ ue of sam@@ ora mach@@ el , the founder and first president of moz@@ ambi@@ que , to help with a rare public demonstration .
“ we want peace again , we want stability , ” said van@@ ess@@ a de s@@ ous@@ a , managing director of an investment company .
fe@@ aring the future of the country , it has been raising its business clothes against a t-@@ shir@@ t , entitled “ we demand security ” in portuguese .
for two weeks , there have been reports of cl@@ ash@@ es between government forces and ren@@ am@@ o on a nearly daily basis , which have been one of the worst batt@@ les since the peace agreement more than 20 years ago .
ren@@ am@@ o was once a not@@ ori@@ ous re@@ bel group , but was initially a member of the white government .
after the peace treaty of 1992 , it became an opposition party .
analy@@ sts think it is unlikely that the country will return to a full-@@ fle@@ d@@ ged conflict , but they have been following foreign investors and domestic investors with concern .
for the rapidly growing economy , much is at stake , because the discovery of huge gas depos@@ its is a matter of life , not of co@@ al-@@ fi@@ red power , off the coast and in the north-@@ west .
the ruling fre@@ li@@ mo party , which has been the dominant party since 197@@ 5 , and ren@@ am@@ o are bl@@ aming each other for the ten@@ sions .
ren@@ am@@ o claims that the government has not yet stopped the recent cl@@ ash@@ es by holding a referendum on 17 october on its members in the province of so@@ fal@@ a , a traditional strong@@ hold ren@@ am@@ os .
the attacks on the former re@@ be@@ ls es@@ cal@@ ated when government troops were ren@@ amed to ren@@ am@@ o bases .
the government is giving ren@@ am@@ o the blame for the cl@@ ash@@ es and acc@@ using the organization of att@@ acking soldiers .
president ar@@ man@@ do gu@@ e@@ bu@@ za has tried to raise concerns about inst@@ ability .
compared to af@@ p , the french news agency , he said on wednesday that the commission is not going to be able to act as a “ lo@@ ser ” who is “ all his remaining assets ” .
both fre@@ lim@@ o and ren@@ am@@ o stress that they are fighting a war .
but the concerns have increased since maastricht and the irish government began to say that the eu is not a viable alternative .
opposite the ft he explained , so he meant that the free@@ b@@ s@@ d agreement was no longer respected .
“ our vision is to re@@ start negotiations , and to do so seriously , ” said ma@@ z@@ ang@@ a .
earlier talks between the parties have done little to resolve the ten@@ sions , which have been exac@@ er@@ b@@ ated by a series of cl@@ ash@@ es this year .
“ we have two adults men ( gu@@ e@@ bu@@ za and dh@@ la@@ k@@ ama ) , who are the bra@@ ins .
none of them are well in negotiation and none is willing to take the necessary conc@@ essions .
ren@@ am@@ o , which is pus@@ hing for electoral reform , has already stated that it will not support the local elections in november .
presidential and parliamentary elections are essential for next year .
some comm@@ ent@@ ators have critic@@ ised the use of force as an attempt by a w@@ re@@ t@@ ched movement to make conc@@ essions and financial conc@@ essions from the government .
ren@@ am@@ os ’ election succ@@ esses have been shr@@ in@@ king since 1992 , while a ne@@ wer party , led by a former ren@@ am@@ o member , has been losing its election .
ma@@ z@@ ang@@ a claims that gu@@ e@@ bu@@ za – whose re@@ sign@@ ation is due when his second term in office begins next year – is the country ’ s democracy .
&quot; he does not want a multi-@@ party democracy , he does not want transparent elections , he does not want peace because he wants to leave the presidency . &quot; he says .
it is un@@ clear what capacity is ren@@ am@@ o , but it has un@@ ease .
most of the batt@@ les took place in the province of so@@ fal@@ a , which is a few hundred kilometres north of ma@@ pu@@ to , where the two are located , but be@@ ira is the port , the mining station , like rio t@@ into and the river .
in june , rio cut off a month from using the railways , after ren@@ am@@ o had launched an attack on the route .
ma@@ z@@ ang@@ a rep@@ lied re@@ luc@@ tan@@ tly about whether pensions were being used to justify the threat .
ren@@ am@@ o wanted to “ war@@ n the international community that things are going in moz@@ ambi@@ que not well , ” ma@@ z@@ an@@ ga said .
the inst@@ ability has increased the fru@@ stration with the government , and the government says fer@@ nan@@ do li@@ ma , head of medi@@ ac@@ o@@ op , an independent media company , because many people wor@@ ried about the government ’ s corruption .
“ people think that the government and the president are responsible for the country ’ s future , and that he is the one who should find solutions to the problems , ” he explains .
om@@ ar sul@@ tan@@ e , a demonstr@@ ator , said that people wanted to simply have stability .
“ no one interested ren@@ am@@ o and fre@@ lim@@ o , they just want peace and use the roads again ” , he explained .
children should be able to experience my@@ ths and leg@@ ends as “ models of life . ”
the stories of th@@ or showed that the “ brut@@ al force is not a chance against cle@@ ver tri@@ ks , ” and the ar@@ tu@@ s leg@@ end demonstrates that the world is important to keep the peace .
many my@@ ths are , however , “ far from wild . ”
“ i find it wonderful that in america my@@ ths are and fol@@ kl@@ ore already part of the education ” , said he .
i have been doing this for twenty years .
he added that , for authors and teachers , the most “ over-@@ the-@@ counter ” di@@ d@@ ac@@ tic , they would “ be completely sh@@ ut down ” , because in enter@@ taining stories , the bot@@ an@@ ical messages would be “ sub@@ ser@@ vi@@ ent . ”
cros@@ s@@ ley hol@@ land , the be@@ ow@@ ul@@ f of the ang@@ lo@@ -@@ sa@@ x@@ on language and author of the pen@@ gu@@ in book of nor@@ se my@@ ths and the british book of fol@@ k tal@@ es is explained : “ man can help .
perhaps the greatest difference between an adult author who is responsible for adult life and a author who wri@@ tes for children is that he is a child .
not everything must be simplified or made to happy end .
it must be sub@@ ser@@ vi@@ ent , which is mani@@ f@@ ested in history and not explained .
that is the old story of showing instead of telling .
han@@ s@@ j@@ ak@@ o@@ b is again coming to fre@@ i@@ hof to take a walk in fre@@ i@@ hof .

it was not only audi@@ ted with much applause by the public , but also its si@@ ster phili@@ pp@@ ine called him welcome .
bil@@ ly sum her@@ mann ver@@ g@@ ess@@ en , an incredi@@ bly good figure , was able to get involved in the role of the si@@ ster and gave her a warm welcome in m@@ im@@ ics and ge@@ st@@ ures .
there is a wide range of activities to be enjoyed in the region .
to award the hon@@ or@@ ary citizenship , h@@ ash@@ lam@@ s may@@ or he@@ in@@ z win@@ k@@ ler gave himself the hon@@ or of representing the then president of the republic of h@@ ä@@ t@@ ti@@ ch together with a part of the city council .

there were five games per team on the plan , each against each .

in a new ze@@ al@@ and small town , bur@@ t mur@@ o is regarded as a lo@@ ving gu@@ y because he plans to build a new world with his motor@@ cycle , built in 19@@ 20 , on a race in america .
bur@@ t is a very popular destination for tourists , despite a heart error .
with its savings of up to a few don@@ ations and a mort@@ gage on its old workshop shoes , the company is setting up a new company via ship to los angel@@ es .
after the film there are coffee , tea and ca@@ kes .
sch@@ ri@@ ell@@ es pi@@ ep@@ sen inter@@ rup@@ ts residents of the city , who live in the vicinity of the city , and who live in the vicinity , in the vicinity of the city , is distur@@ bing .
r@@ hen@@ us mid@@ g@@ ard also participated in land vigor@@ ously .
they distribute the information collected by the ships and the power of the ship .
the company has a number of iron plants in the fire at the site .
in addition to the import of coal , r@@ hen@@ us mid@@ g@@ ard also reli@@ es on wind power plants logistics .
black sh@@ imm@@ ers the coal on the bearing .
two massive blue nec@@ ks , one with a blue back@@ load and one with a sp@@ in , distribute or load the coal as needed .
in any movement of the trans@@ duc@@ ers , a stri@@ k@@ ingly war@@ n sound sounds across the ter@@ rain .
&quot; the signals serve the security and are legally prescri@@ bed &quot; , says mat@@ thi@@ as dol@@ de@@ rer .
in the case of un@@ favourable win@@ ds , this is unfortunately widely heard - and there were already some complaints from people from the city north .
he takes note of the complaints very seriously and has therefore taken up contact with the people concerned , says the 40 year-@@ old .
in close consultation with the authorities , we are now re@@ viewing the warning signals with technical measures .
in the future , he will continue to rely on open dialogue with his neighbours .
mat@@ thi@@ as sch@@ r@@ ell has not yet done much at his site .
the expansion of the lower sa@@ x@@ ony bridge means that r@@ hen@@ us mid@@ g@@ ard continues to rely on coal imports for power plants and is active in this sector as one of the major european producers .
thanks to the 18@@ .@@ 5 m deep@@ ened li@@ v@@ ing-@@ tu@@ b in front terminal , cap@@ es@@ it@@ y-@@ bul@@ ky car@@ r@@ y-@@ carri@@ ers can be manufactured here long ago .
&quot; this year we want to be the 3-@@ mil@@ li@@ on-@@ ton@@ ne tr@@ uck of the en@@ velo@@ pe , &quot; says sch@@ re@@ ll .
in addition to the e@@ on power station on the ground , import coal is going to power stations in the in@@ land .

the first time she was on the european royal class , she sold the co@@ ins and the co@@ ins for a long time , and in the decisive stages , they simply did not have been resolved .

ben green@@ man : ten years of new york com@@ edy festival : the new york stock exchange , the new york stock exchange , the new york stock exchange , the new york stock exchange , the new york stock exchange , and the new york stock exchange .
one might say that new york city is the birth@@ place of stand@@ -@@ up co@@ smo@@ politan in america .
over the years fa@@ ys innovation has been developed , as has been the latest in the new york com@@ edy festival .
the company was founded and led by car@@ ol@@ ine h@@ ir@@ sch , the founder of the stand@@ -up institution car@@ ol@@ ine , and is celebr@@ ating its 10@@ th anniversary this year .
“ most of these head@@ lin@@ ers began with car@@ ol@@ ine , and were then always more successful , until they were eventually sold to the public .
we have designed this festival to enable us to continue working with you .
at this year &apos;s event there are performances by w@@ anda sy@@ kes , k@@ ath@@ y gri@@ ff@@ in and bill ma@@ her as well as by &quot; stand up for her@@ oes &quot; , a ye@@ arly music and com@@ edy show .
the festival also marks the world of com@@ edy , which is a great success .
a number of com@@ edi@@ ans who have been atten@@ ding the festival this year are concerned about rather un@@ conventional ways of doing so , such as broad@@ ca@@ sts on smaller television channels such as com@@ edy central , f@@ x and spi@@ ke .
n@@ ick k@@ roll was played with a sit@@ com on cable tv ( the ir@@ onic key figure of the band was the one who played the game .
jen@@ ny s@@ late was a member of the “ saturday night live ” and “ parks and recre@@ ation ” group .
both k@@ roll and s@@ late and other young com@@ edi@@ ans with characteristic vo@@ ices ( the sur@@ real pes@@ si@@ mis@@ tic an@@ thro@@ po@@ logy jes@@ el@@ nik , who was ir@@ onic , on r@@ aci@@ al the@@ ories , etc . ) .
one of the biggest mag@@ net of the festival is a live interview : david ste@@ in@@ berg talks to lar@@ ry david .
ste@@ in@@ berg began as a stand@@ -up com@@ edi@@ an , but has become a respected tv and television company .
from 2005 to 2007 , he moder@@ ated a television show entitled “ si@@ t down ” , which was broad@@ cas@@ ted by david ste@@ in@@ berg .
the meeting will take place at the town hall in the middle of man@@ h@@ att@@ an .
“ the city is definitely in the com@@ edy series d@@ na of lar@@ r@@ ys ’ entire work ” , said ste@@ in@@ berg .
he told me that if he is here , he will go sometimes through the ga@@ ze between two buildings and think about : he@@ y , if i can see all my money , then le@@ be i live here .
iran satisfied with the process of nuclear negotiations
iran is showing itself a week before the next nuclear meeting with the five un ve@@ to@@ es and germany .
&quot; after years , we have reached an agreement with the international atom@@ ic energy agency to resolve the differences between the past few years &quot; , he wrote .
it would be a long way to go , but the leader of the nuclear negoti@@ ator was not satisfied with the negotiation process and was also optim@@ istic that , in the end , both sides will come to a solution .
dr@@ ama in ur@@ u@@ gu@@ ay : young k@@ ill@@ ers playing cam@@ s with mat@@ ches with mac@@ he@@ te , and the like .
two children have died in ur@@ u@@ gu@@ ay in the murder of a 1@@ 1-@@ year-@@ old .
the two 14 and 12 years old bo@@ ys had invited their sacrif@@ ice to join them in bird hun@@ ting .
with mac@@ he@@ tes and k@@ ni@@ ves armed the world with the help of the 1@@ 1-@@ year-@@ old and thre@@ w the cor@@ pse of the cor@@ pse into a well , reported the newspaper &quot; el pa@@ í@@ s &quot; on thursday .
then , before their homes , they would have been playing football in a work@@ ing-@@ class area .
the cor@@ pse was born in the following night in the village of cer@@ ro pel@@ ado , 15 km north of the exclusive village of s@@ ant &apos;@@ angel@@ o .
as an ali@@ bi , a fi@@ ve-@@ year half-@@ si@@ ster of the younger brother who had taken her along should say that she was sex@@ ually att@@ acked by the boy .
when the girl was in front of the police , however , the action was taken without men@@ tioning an attack on her , the two bo@@ ys gave up the deliber@@ ate killing of the 1@@ 1-@@ year-@@ old .
the reason for this was the el@@ der called a ri@@ val@@ ry in the football match .
he was tempor@@ arily imprison@@ ed in a psy@@ chi@@ at@@ ric youth institution .
p@@ im@@ ps must be brought into prison .
because of explo@@ it@@ ative trafficking in human beings , p@@ im@@ ps , threats , insul@@ ts and dangerous physical in@@ jury , the district court of kon@@ stan@@ z has released a 3@@ 3-@@ year-@@ old man from st. geor@@ gen to three and a half years in prison .
the former german army soldi@@ er , who was killed after two missions in afghanistan , was arrested and sent@@ enced to death in the context of a trial agreement .
so he has done five things to inform women about internet or telephone contacts .
resistance he used violence and threats to lead to breaking .
the income of women who are , in part , responsible for it for years was re@@ tained .
by conf@@ is@@ c@@ ation of mobile phones and si@@ m cards , he sub@@ ordin@@ ated contacts between women and the outside world .
together with a colleague who has mis@@ led women , he has brought them to various bro@@ th@@ els in the sou@@ th@@ west .
he left them there to monitor them to increase their revenues .
in court , the accused claimed that he had been suffering from a serious s@@ ad@@ ness after colleagues in afghanistan , alongside him , had been killed in an explo@@ sion .
after a psy@@ chi@@ at@@ ric expert had found out that he had a great deal of doubt about mental dis@@ ability and , hence , about a limited ability to blame , the 3@@ 3-@@ year-@@ old put a comprehensive conf@@ ession .
the court did not have to pay any more to the women who were in@@ ju@@ red .
as a k@@ ri@@ po official reported , the us government and the us government could not provide a single telephone number after a first notification .
the ab@@ ro@@ g@@ ated talks are of high aggres@@ sion .

oil prices continue to rise to usd 96 per bar@@ re@@ l , and the us is still the world ’ s largest producer of oil .
the price of oil has also fallen on friday , after concerns about a high supply have over@@ sh@@ ad@@ ow@@ ed a report that says that the ener@@ g@@ y-@@ hun@@ gr@@ y manufacturing sector in china is growing .
the reference cru@@ de oil variety for deli@@ veries in december was the first in the european market in electronic commerce at the new york mer@@ can@@ tile exchange .
the treaty fell by 39 c@@ ents on thursday , which is a drop of 5.@@ 5 % .
the large cru@@ de oil supply has increased prices in recent weeks , and the price of oil has increased .
the ministry of energy of the united states stated on wednesday that the us supply increased by 4.@@ 1 million bar@@ re@@ ls last week .
over the course of five weeks , the supply has been reduced by 25 million bar@@ re@@ ls .
but on friday there were signs of greater demand from two reports of an increase in activity in the chinese manufacturing industry .
this indicates a continuing decline in the us economy .

court bloc@@ ked decision to stop the use of fresh drugs .
a federal court of appeal in the united states bloc@@ ked the adoption of a judge ’ s order on thursday , which would have prevented the change to the stop and fr@@ is@@ k programme ( “ stop and search ” ) of the new york police department .
the 2nd us court of appeal declared that the decisions of judge shi@@ ra apparently had been taken .
the judge had a meeting in august , and the city was in breach of the constitution with the way in which the court of justice &apos;s programme was used to stop and ask people to carry out their requests .
the city appe@@ aled against its assessment and the action taken .
the court of appeal heard on tuesday the arguments for the request for suspension of the agreement .
the appeal report stated that the judicial authority had to be informed of the case that the court had not yet fully implemented the code of conduct for us jud@@ ges by deci@@ ding that the court of justice had given the appearance of party politics ;
the judge had refused to be sent@@ enced , police officers were in@@ ju@@ red by the civil rights of tens of thousands of people , because they were in@@ appropri@@ ately targeted black and latin american men with the stop programme .
they appointed a foreign minister to monitor the situation in the country , including reforms of directives , training and training , and service supervision , and ordered a pilot project to be launched .
in august , the city of new york agreed to re@@ consider the practice of stor@@ ing names and addresses of people who have been arrested after a control by the police .
an oral negotiation on the appointment of the city is , after march 14 , 20@@ 14 .
the stop attack is a very important step in the right direction .
controls of this kind have been in various forms for decades , but the number of recorded checks has increased during the mandate of the par@@ tis@@ an may@@ or , michael blo@@ om@@ berg , to a all-@@ time high of 6@@ 8@@ 4.@@ 3@@ 30 in 2011 , the number of which is black in 2011 , the year , the year , the year , the same latin american men in 2011 , the year , the most of which is the year , the latin american .
in 2004 , four men , all minorities , were arrested and sent@@ enced to death .
ad@@ voca@@ tes of changes to the stop and fr@@ is@@ k program of the ny@@ p@@ d say that changes will be unfair practices .
oppon@@ ents believe that the changes would reduce mor@@ ality of the police .
the judge refused to allow the police to take over the free@@ ze .

this be@@ du@@ ine wis@@ dom has given the first chairman , wol@@ f@@ gan@@ g hen@@ ne , a description of the history and fas@@ c@@ ination of the association &quot; helping hands &quot; .
on saturday afternoon , the t@@ enth birth@@ day of the association was celebrated .
the first chairman , hen@@ ne , reported at length on the work of the association .
he himself was in 2004 the first time in maur@@ it@@ ania in the che@@ ij@@ k z@@ a@@ j@@ ed@@ -@@ hospital in n@@ ou@@ ak@@ ch@@ ot@@ t .
as a result , another cooperation , and the gy@@ na@@ eco@@ log@@ ist hen@@ ne led the way on several trips to numerous sur@@ ger@@ ies .
during the speeches , pictures of the operations were taken on a large screen , so that the people could feel at home in the anniversary event .
the deser@@ t vehicle of the association was also shown .
it is a former parliament , which has been a member of the german border control council .
ra@@ iner pre@@ w@@ o , former o@@ b of n@@ ag@@ old , had suggested that this vehicle should be equipped with a photo@@ vol@@ ta@@ ic system and plans to build a new one , according to hen@@ ne , at the club .
in 2008 , the car@@ pen@@ try sch@@ le@@ e@@ h from ba@@ i@@ er@@ s@@ br@@ on@@ n has been in the position of the most advanced hospital in so@@ co@@ gi@@ m , just under a week ’ s time .
hen@@ ne also mentioned a new mother child child hospital in the region of n@@ ou@@ ak@@ ch@@ ot@@ t .
the most interesting thing in times when n@@ ag@@ ol@@ le is home to the birth clin@@ ic is to be we@@ gra@@ tion@@ alised .
you learn a lot in africa as a medical doctor , so hen@@ ne , for example , de@@ to@@ xi@@ fication against bur@@ n-@@ out .
the political un@@ rest in the country has not allowed us to travel as many as planned , but many medical professionals came to germany to take part in various activities .
in addition , contain@@ ers with material are regularly sent to africa , so in march of this year medical devices , medic@@ ations , association material , hospital beds and gl@@ asses .
mi@@ ti@@ ti@@ ator han@@ s-@@ jo@@ achi@@ m fu@@ ch@@ tel himself supplied plenty of local and international support .
when his personal mo@@ tives were called his work in the field of aud@@ iting as a young member .
when he realized that the amount of money on the way was lost , he decided to leave the afric@@ ans with the control of a budget by the people .
he also stressed that the european union ’ s global economy also needs global love for human beings .
it should not be forgotten that the african continent is closer than some people think .
from gran can@@ aria , it is not far to africa .
cou@@ l@@ son used telephone h@@ acking for the check of a tips .
the former news of the word editor , an@@ dy co@@ le , continued to use the term “ telephone h@@ acking , surveillance , and confron@@ tation ” to try to create a false ti@@ p@@ p about an aff@@ air of the then interior minister .
prosecu@@ tor andre@@ w ed@@ is q@@ c explained to the court in the old b@@ ail@@ ey , news of the world i had a wrong rum@@ or in may 2005 that he was being arrested by clar@@ ke .
the newspaper ordered the private detec@@ tive g@@ len@@ n mu@@ l@@ c@@ air@@ e to release pa@@ w@@ l@@ by &apos;s vo@@ ic@@ em@@ ail@@ s .
“ the prosecu@@ tor ’ s office believes that cou@@ l@@ son , who is now the editor of the not@@ w , is no one who is standing in front of the home of people and hopes to se@@ ize them on fresh de@@ eds , but one who is happy to be .
he said that emergency use three procedures to dis@@ pel stories investi@@ ga@@ tive .
the publish@@ er is personally involved in the third method .
obviously , he knows of the second , the monitoring , otherwise it cannot be .
what about the first ?
does he know about the phone h@@ acking ?
he argu@@ es that , but we say : and whether he is aware of it . ”
rum@@ ours about an aff@@ air of clar@@ ke were first discovered by the feature re@@ porters in the state of the art , when one source , the sexual exploitation of pa@@ w@@ l@@ by , was a member of the public .
a band with vo@@ ic@@ em@@ ail@@ s from your phone of at least three occasions was released in august 2006 in mul@@ ca@@ i@@ res apartment .
the investig@@ ators also found entries on the computer of the detec@@ tive , which they were able to access on pa@@ w@@ l@@ by and their si@@ ster as “ projects ” .
in the period when the research was in progress , the experts received a number of patents from pa@@ w@@ l@@ by .
meanwhile , the us and the former chief editor , ne@@ vi@@ l@@ le thur@@ l@@ be@@ ck , and the former re@@ porter , j@@ ames we@@ at@@ ther@@ up , supervis@@ ed the surveillance of pa@@ w@@ l@@ by ’ s movements .
on 18 june 2005 , cou@@ l@@ son left her a vo@@ ic@@ email with the following content : “ i have a story , which we will release tomorrow .
ed@@ is explained , cou@@ l@@ son ’ s activities in this story followed the same pattern as in other important person@@ alities , such as the former interior minister david bl@@ un@@ ket@@ t .
the jur@@ ors heard on thursday , that co@@ le was in the room , because of an aff@@ air with a married woman , and that she was not allowed to work with the woman who was accused .
cou@@ l@@ son and bro@@ o@@ ks argue that they should be confron@@ ted with others .

in protest against the planned en@@ rich@@ ment tax , the french football is actually going to win the first strike since 197@@ 2 .
a arbitr@@ ation meeting is a result of no results .
in the conflict over the re@@ ich@@ -@@ tax regime , the government and the professional football in france have decided to withdraw from the euro after a failed conciliation meeting .
president fran@@ ç@@ o@@ is hol@@ lan@@ de received the first prize in the paris é@@ ly@@ s@@ ée palace on thursday , but he was not allowed to hear the rest of the complaints .
he refused to accept the idea of a football match from the planned 7@@ 5-@@ percent majority of the team .
the other side of the camera remained tough .
the commission &apos;s proposal for a strike announced at the end of november will now be swe@@ pt through , and the head of the professional clubs ( uc@@ p@@ f ) , je@@ an-@@ pi@@ er@@ re lou@@ vel , announced .
the agreement reached between 29 november and 2 december was a major step forward in the league 1 and li@@ gue 2 .
ge@@ ch@@ ingen : no absolute protection possible .
&quot; we want to get the inhabitants involved in the planning at an early stage , &quot; opened may@@ or j@@ ens h@@ ä@@ u@@ ß@@ ler the ci@@ vic information event on flo@@ od protection concept in ge@@ ch@@ ingen .
around 80 participants were involved in the municip@@ al hall to look at the planned measures .
h@@ ass@@ ler made it clear : &quot; the ultimate decisions take the members of the municip@@ al council . &quot;
the floo@@ ds that were ch@@ ing@@ eing on 15 may 2009 , un@@ prepared met , was a dramatic event .
a river region study was carried out with the neighbouring community of a@@ id@@ ling@@ en .
&quot; the protection of as many cultiv@@ ated p@@ lots as possible is the goal &quot; , he added .
the underlying concept is the planning of protection against a weather service sta@@ ti@@ stic every 100 years .
climate change is caused by a 15 % reduction in the price of the product .
in professional cir@@ cles , this is explained by &quot; h@@ q 100@@ ak@@ li@@ ma &quot; .
the water mass@@ es that were produced in ge@@ ch@@ ingen in 2009 caused considerable damage were not in keeping with a 10@@ 00@@ -@@ year flo@@ od .
&quot; to provide absolute protection is not there , but a relative improvement can be achieved &quot; , he added .
in order to protect h@@ q 100@@ ak@@ li@@ ma , you must have a valid h@@ q 10@@ 00@@ 0@@ ak@@ li@@ ma in ge@@ ch@@ ingen , where the community has a total of around 70 percent of the state subsidies .
h@@ ä@@ h@@ ler pointed out , however , that it is only the promotion if a total concept is implemented .
i would like to remind the community of the citizens &apos; participation in this .
a complex and complex design and development process is not necessarily the best way to achieve this .
at best , 20@@ 16 could begin with implementation .
among other things , the concept of protection , which was adopted in the municip@@ al council last week ( we have been told ) , provides for local measures in the flow of river ir@@ m from the parent ’ s valley .
following the presentation of the flo@@ od protection concept , the member states used the opportunity to express their concerns .
among other things , it has been ques@@ tioned why not more dam@@ s and re@@ ar@@ -@@ bas@@ ins are planned to protect the place .
gre@@ g@@ or k@@ ü@@ hn , specialist plan@@ ner of the commission@@ ed engineering office wal@@ d and cor@@ be from h@@ ü@@ gel@@ sh@@ ei@@ m , who presented the concept , stressed that it was the interaction of all the measures presented to achieve the desired result .
i would also like to say that the most econom@@ ical solution , jo@@ achi@@ m wal@@ d von wal@@ d and cor@@ be , have to be found .
there was dis@@ content with the council &apos;s members &apos; en@@ tran@@ ts , who were even able to keep on being under a cong@@ es@@ tion from the channel network , even in normal stor@@ ms .
the problem is not known in the administration , and the first steps have already been taken .
h@@ ä@@ h@@ ler , however , pointed out that the guidelines for channel systems are others than for the high-@@ water protection and this is not missing .
the community is obliged to use the channel network in such a way that two to three years of reg@@ ener@@ ation can be achieved .
the se@@ wage channels larger to dimen@@ sion@@ ing would save millions of lives .
the most common cause of the in@@ jury was the in@@ jury of the german army during the war of 18@@ 8@@ 3 .
in the early afternoon on friday , the road 44 near reven@@ s@@ dorf will take two drivers to a fron@@ tal col@@ li@@ sion .
the police bloc@@ ked the street immediately , but could not get to the accident first little .
however , there are various testi@@ mon@@ ies that have only been evalu@@ ated .
it is clear that the 19 year old ste@@ ering man of a v@@ w golf is moving towards reven@@ s@@ dorf and the 3@@ 8-@@ year-@@ old man from ge@@ tt@@ or@@ f has been working with her hy@@ un@@ da@@ i .
both vehicles cl@@ ash@@ ed , with the woman having been so hard hit that she was unable to get the fire department to work for about half an hour .
the real cause of the accident was un@@ resolved .
both dev@@ a@@ stated came to nearby hospit@@ als .
the track was left for about two hours .
it could be given to the do@@ sto@@ ev@@ sky of the united states .
phili@@ p k. dic@@ k was a go@@ d-@@ looking , a mem@@ orial to me@@ ta@@ physi@@ c@@ ist , his nov@@ els and stories have also written something ser@@ ial .
the fact that the two countries are not involved in the same process is ast@@ on@@ ishing : the technical eyes , be@@ ard , the high fore@@ head .
and so , as f@@ jo@@ d@@ or m. do@@ sto@@ je@@ w@@ ski , with his massive o@@ eu@@ vre as founder and ap@@ o@@ log@@ ist of the russian soul , is to understand , phili@@ p k@@ . di@@ ck is read as american pro@@ ph@@ et .

dic@@ k explains america - the real@@ m of breathtaking technological progress , cou@@ pled with parallel processes and a wealth of security .
dic@@ k had a great experience in god , his late books read like a mix@@ ture of rev@@ el@@ ation of john and a computer game .
perhaps he was cra@@ zy , had drugs to his brain , and he was a good friend .
he has cap@@ tured , early on , that the machines div@@ ini@@ ties are .
he wrote a the@@ ology of the computer and asked whether he could have a human being different from a machine , the cre@@ ator of his cre@@ ator .
that is the bl@@ ade run@@ ner game .

a master of science fic@@ tion .
a fantastic writer .
his stories have fil@@ m@@ makers such as rid@@ ley sc@@ ot@@ t , paul ver@@ ho@@ ev@@ en and ste@@ ven spi@@ el@@ berg inspired him .
this story is now particularly significant .
the &apos; minority re@@ port@@ ation &apos; is from 2005 .
there is a question of the principle of pre-@@ crime .
in dic@@ ks world , which is the one that is like our sho@@ cking , mu@@ t@@ ants look to the future - and the police are taking action .
&quot; we collect individuals , who are not subject to any law , &quot; says the chief of the authority .
&quot; we are s@@ nu@@ b@@ bing us before you can commit a violent crime , &quot; he said .
and : &quot; in our society there are no serious crimin@@ als , for which we have a criminal prosecu@@ tor full of pes@@ u@@ do@@ -@@ crimin@@ als , &quot; they read time flows .
they assume that worst weather can happen , and prevent the state of the crimin@@ als from falling into line .
dic@@ ks nar@@ ra@@ tive works like the blue@@ print for anti-@@ terrorist action .
an@@ tiz@@ ation of the attack : this is how obama ’ s dr@@ one philosophy and philosophy works .
but dic@@ ks story is not yet finished .
the police chief den@@ oun@@ ces the fact that there are no separation of powers .
then the over@@ wat@@ cher will be monitored and a future criminal supervis@@ ed .
the system is re@@ vol@@ ving around .
it is perfect , but it is lying .
it inv@@ ents its own pre@@ requi@@ sites .
does the user accept any errors and sacrif@@ ices , but also buil@@ ds on them .
the system creates the danger that it will combat .
phili@@ p k. dic@@ k read is always saying that the truth is closer to the truth .
the hotel is very close to the city centre and the train station .
the former us intelligence service expert , john hu@@ me , has been able to explain in the us late hour that the us government is now in a position to make a significant contribution to its russian asylum .
representatives of the german federal bar association could either answer questions in writing or submit a written question to the 30@@ -@@ year-@@ old in russia , the agency inter@@ fax .
previously , the green bun@@ de@@ sta@@ g member han@@ s-@@ christian sch@@ ö@@ be@@ le had the first german politici@@ an to lead snow@@ den in moscow yesterday , to talk to him about the aff@@ air .
n@@ sa rev@@ el@@ ations are increasing corporate par@@ an@@ o@@ ia due to state surveillance and the use of the internet for state surveillance .
the hotel is situated in a quiet street in the heart of the city , close to the main shopping street , the main train station and the main shopping street .
at the federal ministry of education and research ( bun@@ des@@ am@@ t für constitutional protection und terrorism ) , the german interior intelligence service , he should re@@ build the roof of the us foreign post to be located less than 5 km from the european central bank .
according to german media , the b@@ v@@ t wanted to limit the presence of surveillance an@@ ten@@ n@@ as and the action led to a change of words between the usa and the german ministry of foreign affairs in berlin .
james cla@@ pper , us secretary of state of national intelligence , has insi@@ sted in september that the us government should not be allowed to use foreign gaming to control the us .
but since ed@@ ward snow@@ den , who was elected wh@@ ist@@ le@@ b@@ lower , the world ’ s first wh@@ ist@@ le@@ b@@ lower , began publishing his f@@ ill@@ hor@@ n to us intelligence about surveillance , european governments and businesses have been un@@ aware of .
reports that the american national security agency has been using the braz@@ ili@@ an oil company petro@@ ba@@ -@@ b@@ as to force the country to withdraw data from american cl@@ oud suppliers , including google and y@@ a@@ ho@@ o .
the bar@@ re@@ l of over@@ flow brought the rev@@ el@@ ation that chancell@@ or ang@@ ela mer@@ kel ’ s phone was inter@@ tw@@ ined , possibly for ten years .
if the most powerful person in europe is targeted , then it is with certainty that business management is also a potential target .
snow@@ den has the intense cooperation between us intelligence services and companies in a transparent manner .
i believe it is con@@ cei@@ vable that these data could be used for mutual benefit .
“ germany must wake up , ” explains oli@@ ver gr@@ ü@@ n , president of bit@@ mi , the small and medium-sized it companies in germany .
german companies believe that the us has now set an almost as great a risk as china when it comes to industrial es@@ pi@@ on@@ age and data the@@ ft , such a survey that was published in july by the advisory group .
in the snow@@ den world , the snow@@ den documents contained a number of un@@ docum@@ ented facts that the us had not yet fully respected foreign companies ’ operating secre@@ ts .
politicians have expressed concern that the eu is not being given certain it and internet opportunities .
companies are s@@ cep@@ tical about this .
in the bun@@ de@@ sta@@ g it was proposed that we should build a german google .
i can only close my eyes and slowly open them again ...
“ that is not how it works , ” says h@@ as@@ so pl@@ att@@ ner , chairman of the german software manufacturer sap .
if you want a strong european it industry , you would have been able to do so not 20 years ago .
everything in germany is subsid@@ ised , from the coal industry to cars , to agriculture .
everything except the it industry .
nevertheless , the scope and technical re@@ fin@@ ement of the services offered by the snow@@ den rev@@ el@@ ations have not been sufficiently clear .
cl@@ oud compu@@ ting is a great change .
according to a study conducted by cl@@ oud security alliance , one of the trading institutions , the united states has been war@@ ned of the negative effects of the global financial crisis following the rev@@ el@@ ations of the us data mining activities with pr@@ ism .
j@@ im sn@@ ab@@ e , depu@@ ty chief executive officer of sa@@ p , says : “ we see a new question of customers , who are facing it a year ago .
many german corporate leaders believe that the recent reports confirm that the eu is not doing what it has already known .
that economic es@@ pi@@ on@@ age is not surprising .
that has always been the case .
“ it was many years a topic and has become a very important topic in the current discussion , ” says kur@@ t bo@@ ck , chairman of the chemical company bas@@ f .
americans sp@@ y us on commercial grounds and industri@@ ally , and they are not .
the management of the company normally does not bo@@ ast about the counter@@ measures that have been taken , because that gives att@@ ack@@ ers advantages .

parents of a te@@ en@@ ager from georgia , who was born in a tragic accident , are now convinced of murder .
the parents of the te@@ en@@ ager , whose body is in a ro@@ lled co@@ w , are in the tur@@ n@@ hal@@ le of his high school .
k@@ end@@ ric@@ k jo@@ hn@@ son from val@@ do@@ sta in the u.s. state of georgia was born on january 11 in a u@@ pri@@ ght mat@@ te found , which is behind the gallery in the school tower .
the investig@@ ating officers of the sh@@ eri@@ ff of low@@ n@@ des county , who were found to be a very dangerous man in a tragic accident , were not able to do so by the family of the 17 year-@@ old .
“ they are convinced that their son was mur@@ dered , ” he explained , “ the reason for his death was that he was a law@@ yer of ken@@ ne@@ th and jac@@ qu@@ el@@ y@@ n jo@@ hn@@ son .
they would never have believed that he was dead .
“ they believe that the best way to avoid logic is to use the power of the laws of physi@@ cs as well as the common sense of the word . ”
rather , they are convinced that the truth will be conce@@ aled to protect the person or person who is responsible for the death of their son .
&quot; her son went to learn to school and came to the body bag . &quot; she comm@@ ented .
us prosecu@@ tor michael mo@@ ore said on thursday that there will be a formal investigation into the death of jo@@ hn@@ son , as a number of important questions remain un@@ resolved .
what was the cause of death ?
is his death due to a crime ?
the mo@@ ore explained at a press conference on thursday afternoon .
i follow the facts in which direction you are going .
my aim is to tell the truth .
“ i represent the view that a sufficient number of the necessary basic principles for formal identification is in place , ” he said .
mo@@ ore explained to re@@ porters who were starting to use au@@ top@@ sy to suggest that they were jo@@ hn@@ son ’ s fault for the consequences of a “ posi@@ tion-@@ related sti@@ fl@@ ing . ”
a second au@@ top@@ sy , however , has caused another death , mo@@ ore argu@@ es .
“ there are a number of questions that need answers or confirmation ” , said mr. k@@ ab@@ u@@ l .
mo@@ ore added that if there is sufficient evidence to justify the criminal investigation , or civil liability , he would be able to do so .

on wednesday , the commission published a report on the activities of the european union in the field of disease control and prevention .
these are the first such directives that the us administration has issued .
one in 20 children in the united states has now become a food aller@@ gy .
the spread of food aller@@ gies among children has , according to the c@@ dc , increased 18 % between 1997 and 2007 .
the guidelines provide information for schools , which are registered with the teacher and the staff for food aller@@ gies .
it is also recommended that schools of ep@@ ine@@ ph@@ r@@ in be able to take part in the training - the car injec@@ tion of the ep@@ ip@@ en brand is used most often - to prevent potentially fat@@ al over@@ sensi@@ tivity reaction .
the legisl@@ ators in the states recently announced the rules that would allow schools to become ep@@ in@@ ep@@ h@@ in more easily .
the report also lists typical cases of symp@@ t@@ oms , which are caused by children who are in aller@@ gy to the disease .
children may say : “ it feels like they are being born on my ton@@ gue . ”
parents of inter@@ sexual children can be “ sex v@@ ague ” , but they can choose “ sex v@@ ague ” .
germany is the first european nation in which a third sex is responsible for children .
new@@ born children are no longer rigi@@ d male , or female , and they are no longer able to be born .
under the new law , parents do not have to pay any more for sex for such children , but can be “ un@@ determined ” or “ not defined ” on birth certificate .
the aim of the law is to reduce the pressure of parents to not allow them to take ha@@ sty decisions on operational activities for a gender violence .
an inter@@ sexual person said , according to bb@@ c years later , “ i am neither man nor woman . ”
i maintain the f@@ lic@@ k@@ work that is being done by doctors , but i am not going to be able to do so .
it is estimated that one in 2 000 children in the eu comes to europe every year as neither young nor as girls .
they are among the inter@@ sexual , a group that is among the diagno@@ ses of “ sexual differenti@@ ation dis@@ order ” ( ds@@ d ) .
val@@ ais simp@@ son may have been inter@@ sex@@ u@@ ally .
understanding gender equality is a key issue in the process of developing a new approach , but most experts in the us advise that we should not use the best available information on gender allocation .
the new york psy@@ chi@@ at@@ ris@@ t dr. j@@ ack dres@@ cher , who speci@@ ali@@ zes in the problem of gender identification , said that the new german law “ bl@@ ade after a good thing ” .
inter@@ sexual children are an ethical dil@@ em@@ ma .
“ some people have life@@ -@@ threat@@ ening ill@@ nesses that cause a sur@@ g@@ ical intervention .
you can only accept gender as@@ sign@@ ment without sur@@ gery and then see how the identity will develop .
the scientific data on how a child can even have a gender identity is not very clear .
no one knows why it is happening .
it is like the secret that people are hom@@ os@@ ex@@ ual .
a report to the european commission in 2000 indicated that the european union must promote inter@@ sexual human beings from trans@@ sex@@ u@@ als or trans@@ gender violence .
these characteristics were shown in post-@@ ran@@ king sexual characteristics , and in the form of mus@@ cle mass , hair , bre@@ asts and stat@@ ure , primarily in sexual relations , and in the form of reproduction .
the report also gives an overview of discrimination , which has been committed by inter@@ sexual and trans@@ gender persons in professional life .
not with gender , but with the same sex , now have a special camp .
it is now the case in australia and ne@@ pal for adults to have access to official documents male , female or “ third sex ” .
in june , austr@@ ali@@ an nor@@ ri@@ e may wel@@ by ( 52 ) was the first “ g@@ end@@ er-@@ free ” person worldwide to be recognized after a court rul@@ ed that a li@@ fel@@ ong “ un@@ defined ” gender status was maintained .
german cards are valid for a maximum of 3 months in addition to m and w , x for inter@@ sex@@ u@@ ell , according to the ministry of the interior .
in the neighbouring france , gender issues are still the subject of contro@@ vers@@ y , such as a news report on france 24 .
in 2011 , do@@ z@@ ens of french members of the strictly catho@@ lic country signed a peti@@ tion that the “ g@@ end@@ er-@@ theory ” of scho@@ ol@@ books should be removed .
the u.s. website ca@@ th@@ ol@@ ic online has also op@@ ted out of the german law , on the grounds that “ if the world is in a new state , where the gender is a decision , it is a sexual activity but not . ”
the mother of a new@@ born from mar@@ y@@ land explained to baby zone , she cat@@ ches it better to have bab@@ ies at the birth of a sex .
“ the parent carrier is a very important part of the family ’ s life even without further restrictions , especially when you are familiar with the sex of your child , ” she said the parent ’ s website .
children need stability and security .
histor@@ ically , children who were born with both male and female parents were not treated as children .
ten years ago , the commission ’ s medical profes@@ sion considered gender to be something that could be ext@@ ingu@@ ished and then re@@ built .
but the eth@@ ics of a sur@@ gery are now being ques@@ tioned , now that it is known how complex the gender identity is , and that doctors are also wrong to seek out the ethical basis of the operation .
“ in the middle of the 20th century , one was called , psy@@ chi@@ at@@ ric emergency , ” said dres@@ cher .
if such a child was born , then it was not the psy@@ chi@@ at@@ ri@@ sts who were called , but the sur@@ ge@@ ons .
the prevail@@ ing theory about the treatment of children with un@@ clear gen@@ it@@ als dates back to dr. john money of the jo@@ hn@@ s ho@@ p@@ k@@ ins university .
he shaped the term “ gender ” and the concept of “ gender identity ” was argu@@ ed , and social and environmental stimul@@ i – like parents inven@@ ted a child – were inter@@ acting with gen@@ es and hor@@ mon@@ es of a child and influ@@ encing them .
but , in a report entitled “ john / jo@@ an ” , the us government ’ s 196@@ 6 case has been described as controversial .
he advis@@ ed the parents of a boy whose pen@@ is was killed in a bot@@ ched cro@@ p .
money was a very important example of this case , as a successful example of conversion , but it was not .
when the boy was about 15 , he moved back to the male sex .
with 38 but he did commit su@@ ici@@ de .
according to dres@@ cher , there are still doctors who use this model .
but , in the 1990 ’ s , with the adv@@ ent of the internet , survi@@ v@@ ors of these sex operations to the public have come to the attention of “ not happy with the outcome . ”
for example , j@@ im bru@@ ce , a 36 year old author from mon@@ tan@@ a who worked with x@@ y-@@ male ch@@ ro@@ mo@@ som@@ es , was a young author who had ambigu@@ ous gen@@ itali@@ a .
the doctors agreed that the situation was not as clear as it was , or was not , a large cl@@ it@@ or@@ is or a small pen@@ is .
so his external or@@ gan and the court ’ s ho@@ den were removed shortly after the birth in 197@@ 6 , and he was taken to power as a girl .
at the age of 12 he was given female hor@@ mon@@ es .
“ i knew that the world was not a girl , ” he explained to ab@@ c@@ news@@ .com that he was a girl of the same name , ab@@ c@@ news@@ .com , who was a member of the ab@@ c@@ news@@ .com group .
i was un@@ happy , but it was really difficult to ask questions .
at the age of 18 he should have a v@@ ag@@ inal plastic .
but , as he is de@@ pressed and knew that he was doing something wrong , he was demanding that the government ’ s medical records be .
what he found was sho@@ cking , and i was not able to see what he was doing .
i was born in the middle of my birth – and nobody gave me that .
bru@@ ce was played with a ds@@ d , through which his body did not have enough te@@ sto@@ ster@@ one to develop gen@@ it@@ als .
after telling the truth , he changed his mind to the male front .
the operation has made it inf@@ er@@ tile .
today , he is fighting for others in an organization called interface project to be able to use inter@@ sexual humans as normal .
but anne tam@@ ar@@ -@@ mat@@ tis , managing director of the company based in california , is not a member of the european union .
“ many activi@@ sts are wor@@ ried that the german decision will encourage parents to take quick decisions and to give the child a non-@@ fixed ‘ allocation ’ , ” she explained .
we fear that the european union will be able to intervene .
we think it would be better to leave male or female members of the family to work together .
but we do not yet know how the law will affect , so we can only spec@@ ulate .
tam@@ ar@@ -@@ mat@@ tis said that her organisation supports the austr@@ ali@@ an law , because “ it allows adults to be recognised as the third sex ” .
“ adults should be able to develop their own decisions about their legal sex .
the german law is about the allocation of the funds for the birth of children .
this is not a fight to which little children can be forced at this time .
if you are adult , you can have your own body decide .
but dr. ar@@ len@@ e bar@@ at@@ z , a bru@@ stra@@ di@@ o@@ log@@ ist from pit@@ ts@@ burg , who was a daughter with a sexual differenti@@ ation dis@@ order , and who had hundreds of others in a self-@@ help group , says that this is german .
k@@ ati@@ e , the daughter of bar@@ at@@ z , was killed with male ch@@ ro@@ mo@@ som@@ es .
because of the reception def@@ ect of the target cells for te@@ sto@@ ster@@ one k@@ ati@@ e developed female characteristics that were not yet available .
it has a v@@ ag@@ ina , but no u@@ ter@@ us and no o@@ oc@@ y@@ tes .
today k@@ ati@@ e 29 and married the other two , she works on the university of pen@@ n@@ sy@@ l@@ v@@ ania .
it is inf@@ er@@ tile , but it hopes to be replaced by adoption or temporary agency .
“ the law gives parents room to decide , which means that they do not have to take decisions hur@@ ri@@ ed@@ ly , ” said bar@@ at@@ z .
it gives you the time to test different tests and to do things and gives you the time to test them .
in this way , everything is in order – you pul@@ l the child big and lo@@ ves it .
the hotel is located in a quiet area , close to the city centre .
and you don &apos;t have to rus@@ h to do an operation that is no longer un@@ done .
“ this includes children in the decision .
in the end , the child deci@@ des on the sex that f@@ its better with him – and that is wonderful .
this will enable children to be able to make their own decisions .

in fact , wal@@ tr@@ au@@ d ries lives in a dre@@ am@@ like atmosphere .
your house is located in a quiet residential area of stutt@@ gart with a lot of green , an old tree population , nice neighbours and also not too much traffic .
the city is only a few minutes away by public transport .

i have been looking for a new apartment for my hus@@ band and myself for some time .
but you know how difficult that is in stutt@@ gart .
the reason is not a pho@@ bia of sp@@ ines , but a concern to be able to see the many steps to the house and the apartment at an old age , explains them .
moreover , since a men@@ is@@ c@@ us operation , the middle fif@@ ties have seen a significant increase in the number of women in the european union , who are suffering from handic@@ ap .
recently , a book by her appeared , for example , on the subject of &apos; happy living in old age - what form of housing is the best for me ? &apos; .
&apos;@@ our apartment is the best example of what happened in old age &apos; , begins with a refres@@ hing and pleasant experience .
when they were elected more than 20 years ago with their hus@@ band in the ma@@ is@@ on@@ et@@ te apartment , it was simply a beautiful apartment in the middle of the green .
today , with the middle fif@@ ty , wal@@ tr@@ au@@ d ries thin@@ ks differently about it .
however , she also knows that she is one of the few people who has even considered the issue of &apos; housing in old age &apos; .
most of them are pus@@ hing it out as long as it is .
old people are always only the others &apos; , she says sch@@ mun@@ z@@ el@@ nd .
only when the suffering pressure really is great do i make a thought .
&apos;@@ then it can be too late . &apos;
in her book , interior architec@@ t puts 17 home models for a self-@@ determined living in the old age .
&apos;@@ what kind of home you choose is always a personal choice . &apos;
d i e solution there is not for the age .
even those who are not sure about the reti@@ rement home in tus@@ c@@ any or brit@@ t@@ any should be aware that the european union is also a si@@ ck person .
and : &apos; without good knowledge of the national language , you will also be able to combine in the dol@@ ce vit@@ a , &apos; the specialist book author of those who wish to be excluded .
among their models are classic models of care for children , alternative forms of living , or the often quo@@ ted reti@@ rement age .
at age everyone has his tic@@ ks and his nec@@ ks and is doing his own tr@@ ic@@ ks and doing something about them .
&apos;@@ for me , such a community would be nothing &apos; , she says , with an eye cat@@ cher .
it is not like a student group who is looking for a shared bathroom and a kitchen .
&apos;@@ at age you just need to re@@ treat rooms &apos; , so you can see them .
the fact that a senior residential community can still function is something that the book author still does not want to exclu@@ de .
this should be done differently , however , than in the classical student writing .
and sometimes you just want to relax . &apos;
this is the opinion that she is in no way alone in the capital of the country .
&apos;@@ most of the old people in stutt@@ gart want to stay there until they are in their own home &apos; is also the experience of the@@ res@@ a r@@ ü@@ t@@ ten , the head of civil service life at the age of the provin@@ cial capital .
your department advis@@ es people around the subject of &apos; older people &apos; .
that is why it is precisely elderly people who often find it difficult and difficult to accept restrictions , just to stay in their usual environment .
there are many possibilities today to visit the house or the apartment barri@@ e@@ re@@ fre@@ i .
ries recomm@@ ends all users to contact the r@@ s-@@ 23@@ 2 for a re@@ configuration of their home or home .
today , there is also a new system for the re@@ building of the old age .
even in the rental apartment let the one or other re@@ ali@@ zes , and if there is only the toilet seat increase , the apartment will clarify the details .
but not always is the existing apartment suitable for the elderly and thus accessible .
this experience has been passed on to wal@@ tr@@ au@@ d ries .
although it is possible to find a sta@@ ir@@ lift inside the apartment , which is also pav@@ ed with sta@@ irs to the residential areas .
it will continue to seek out the ideal object for itself and your hus@@ band .
before moving , the camera gre@@ ets you more than before the sp@@ in@@ ning on your home door .
the us wants to further prosecu@@ te snow@@ den , but the us wants to continue prosecu@@ ting snow@@ den .
the us has changed its position on the former us intelligence officer ed@@ ward snow@@ den .
he will continue to be accused of using secret information un@@ authorised .
therefore , he must be in the us subject to a criminal procedure , said the us secretary of state , that j@@ enni@@ fer p@@ sa@@ ki , was in washington .
the recent statements by snow@@ den and the other news would not change that either .
previously , the german green politici@@ an han@@ s-@@ christian str@@ ö@@ be@@ le had a meeting with snow@@ den in moscow , where he was invited to join the us in order not to continue threat@@ ening him with pun@@ ishment .
p@@ sa@@ ki stressed that there is a need for a strong response to the anti-@@ democratic s@@ enti@@ ments of a parliam@@ ent@@ arian , not a german member of the government .
intelligence services are now being replaced by ed@@ ward snow@@ den , who is in fact willing to talk to the german authorities .
first , however , he wants to clarify his situation .
the report presented by the united states has done so by the former n@@ sa staff in an un@@ addressed letter , which the founder of the green party , han@@ s-@@ christian str@@ ö@@ be@@ le , sent to the united states on friday after a meeting with snow@@ den .
the letter has been sent after a debate that was widely distributed by str@@ ö@@ be@@ le :
the competent authorities must be notified of any complaints to the competent authorities .
i was asked to give you a brief reply regarding your investigation into mass surveillance .
i am ed@@ ward joseph , the son of the lord of the r@@ ings , and i was previously contrac@@ ted or directly appointed as technical expert at the national security agency ( n@@ sa ) , the central intelligence agency .
in my work in these institutions , i have seen systematic violations of the law of my government , which have left me mor@@ ally obliged to act .
as a result of the publication of these concerns , i faced a serious and persi@@ stent s@@ cep@@ tic@@ ism that forced me to leave my family and my home .
i live in ex@@ ile and enjoy the best time in the world for temporary asylum , which the russian federation has granted me under international law .
i am encouraged by the response from the commissioner to my political action , both in the united states and elsewhere .
citizens around the world and high officials are also very much in favour of the european union &apos;s dis@@ clo@@ sures .
this sp@@ y de@@ hu@@ br@@ is was a source of many proposals for new laws and directives , which were based on the previously hidden principles of abuse of public confidence .
the benefits for society from these gained data are not only recognised by the state , but also by the public and private sectors , the risks taken into account have been significantly reduced .
although the result of my efforts has been demonstr@@ ably positive , my government is tre@@ ating dis@@ sent as a breach of trust and stri@@ ving to promote political expression .
nevertheless , to tell the truth is not a crime .
i am confident that the government of the united states , with the support of the international community , will take this ab@@ hor@@ rent position .
i hope that , when the difficulties of these humanitarian situations are resolved , i will be able to give my support to the responsible implementation of the experts &apos; report on the humanitarian situation in the media .
i look forward to a meeting with you in your country as soon as the situation has been clari@@ fied and thank you for your efforts to up@@ hold international law , which protec@@ ts us all .

ob@@ am@@ a-@@ campaign report considered , bi@@ den by h@@ ill@@ ary clin@@ ton , to be a substitu@@ te for h@@ ill@@ ary clin@@ ton .
the clo@@ s@@ est advis@@ ers of president bar@@ ack obama have , in secret , considered inv@@ iting vice-president jo@@ e bi@@ den to the european parliament in the 2012 election campaign by h@@ ill@@ ary clin@@ ton , according to the new york times .
the rev@@ el@@ ation is the considerable number of the most remarkable surprise of the long-@@ awa@@ ited work by mark hal@@ per@@ in and john he@@ ile@@ mann about the election campaign in 2012 , “ double down ” .
times is a unique example of the same name that will be published soon .
according to jon@@ a@@ than martin , national correspon@@ dent of the ti@@ mes , the country ’ s book is thoroughly records the history of the efforts of leading campaign and white house employees to establish a “ green ” , in particular the former white house chief of staff .
the potential change was a strictly controlled process , which was not always easy to understand .
only half a do@@ zen of en@@ demic advis@@ ers from the president – including dal@@ ey , the former campaign leader obama , j@@ im mes@@ sin@@ a , and the former chief of advis@@ er to the white house , david ax@@ el@@ ro@@ d and david david david david .
in double down , the “ double down ” is claimed to have led the effort to create a bi@@ den despite her “ close relationship ” with the be@@ es .
in an interview with martin , the d@@ ali@@ e confirmed that the government was actually considering how to make bi@@ den by clin@@ ton .
“ i expressed a whole series of things that could be considered , ” he said .
we must remember that the european council president at that time had terrible po@@ ll values , so that the people of europe thought : ‘ for god ’ , what are we doing ? ’
while dal@@ ey was the first to be treated as a &quot; due care &quot; , martin told an@@ der@@ son co@@ op@@ er of c@@ n@@ n that during the campaign for the re-@@ election of the child , considerable effort was made to find out if a child was a child .
“ in campaigns , not so much money is spent on surve@@ ys and focus groups , when one does not seriously think about something ” , he explained on ac@@ 3@@ 60 .
however , it is not clear whether obama knew that he would be able to exchange intelligence and intelligence .
martin said to c@@ n@@ n that he had asked dal@@ ey whether his dam@@ al@@ er bo@@ ss had been informed of the possible change .
although there is a statement by dal@@ ey that he does not believe that the president of the possible change was “ aware of ” , the former chief of staff ad@@ mitted that it was “ possible ” that obama knew of it .
martin added that the “ dou@@ ble down ” is not a defini@@ tive answer to the question : what is the political song ?
co@@ op@@ er asked martin if he was seriously thinking of obama having nothing to learn from the studies on how he could be a be@@ e@@ ke@@ eper in the election .
“ possible ” , rep@@ lied martin .
what happens on my email ?
e-mail is actually called electronic letter .
has the design of the internet service e-mail been similar to the conventional mail system techn@@ ically the secret of the letter ?
the design of the early internet services focused on the need to make communication possible .
therefore , the basic technical proto@@ col@@ s did not ensure that a stable and stable foundation for a hearing protection letter was laid .
therefore , a conventional email is more like an open post@@ card than a se@@ aled letter .
if user &quot; anna &quot; is interested in &quot; ben@@ ni &quot; send an email to the computers of the two are then directly connected ?
the email program or browser of anna sch@@ ick@@ t sen@@ ds the mail to the mail server in the first step of the service provider .
if you are a g@@ mail account , for example , the google .
this mail server sen@@ ds the content to the provider , the user ben@@ ni uses .
on the route , the mail can be sent via several other servers on the internet .
ben@@ ni@@ e can then check the content with his provider .
if conventional e-@@ ma@@ ils are sent through the network , the user can see the message .
most mail will be sent multiple times by software robo@@ ts .
the provider of the sen@@ der will be charged for checking whether the mail is a mal@@ icious program .
the recei@@ ver systems use a usb port to connect to the computer .
moreover , the providers check whether they are a ri@@ dic@@ ulous and un@@ wanted don@@ ation .
have the robo@@ ts still another task ?
in systems such as g@@ mail , the robo@@ t also determin@@ es the information that google has to provide for context advertising .
if anna and ben@@ ni are sent via g@@ mail to your next holiday destination , google may provide links to holiday information .
read also unknown people to read the em@@ ail@@ s ?
the prob@@ ability that un@@ authorized persons have received an email is very high .
in theory , however , this is possible .
in companies , administr@@ ators often have the ability to read electronic mail .
the law enforcement agencies and secret services have also been given legal opportunities to send e-@@ ma@@ ils or to take note of them .
in addition , possible illegal sp@@ elling actions are to be added .
is it possible to send e-@@ ma@@ ils against reading ?
with encry@@ ption according to the open@@ p@@ g@@ p standard , an e-mail can be encry@@ p@@ ted effectively against read .
with a high technical effort it is also possible to use the met@@ ad@@ ata of an e-mail communication , so that not even the user can easily be identified who is connected with whom .
how important are y@@ a@@ ho@@ o and google on the e-mail market in germany ?
the main private ones are the mail boxes of y@@ a@@ ho@@ o and google , according to an investigation by con@@ vi@@ os consulting in august 2013 , only a sub@@ ordin@@ ate role .
while the shares of y@@ a@@ ho@@ o-@@ mail were last dro@@ pped , g@@ mail was able to significantly increase g@@ mail .
mother in the forest is missing and pension k@@ assi@@ ves the old man .
when his bet@@ tered mother died , he for@@ ged a man from wol@@ f@@ sburg to build a plan .
he bur@@ ied the dead in a forest - and k@@ ass@@ ed the dead .
to continue to pay pensions and care money , we have to make sure that a 67 year old wol@@ f bur@@ ger has lost his mother &apos;s dead after investig@@ ating the police in the forest .
first of all , he has condemned the death of the 8@@ 9-@@ year-@@ ol@@ ds , then he has spent the money for more than one and a half years .
now the 6@@ 7-@@ year-@@ old has to be held responsible for fraud , as a spo@@ kes@@ man said on friday .
so the commission ’ s man hi@@ d the woman in a forest near hel@@ m@@ ste@@ dt .
susp@@ ected was the man already in may : at that time , the police had to pay for the people in need of care .
the investig@@ ators told me that the pen@@ sion@@ er , his mother was travelling to spain .
because officials are not aware of this , they have shown that they are doing so .
it was revealed that the two countries had been in the process of living in a common flat for more than 15 years and he had last looked after them .
the 6@@ 7-@@ year-@@ old eventually died his mother , and he was released from prison .
an ob@@ session ar@@ ose according to the police , no evidence of a capital crime .
want to see ice cre@@ am in the dark ?
a british entreprene@@ ur has the first in the dark sh@@ ining e@@ is@@ . the company has developed a new type of co@@ ating with the help of pain@@ ts .
char@@ lie fran@@ c@@ is was the cur@@ ator of the flu@@ o@@ res@@ cent properties of marine animals .
the idea was born after he had completed a research on tor@@ ments .
the ice cre@@ am re@@ acts to the skin with the ton@@ gue , which makes the ph in the prote@@ in higher and the light is more effective .
chr@@ is explains that the menu ice was respon@@ sive to the war@@ m@@ th in his mouth and g@@ lows – the more you can lic@@ k , the bri@@ ghter it becomes .
char@@ lie , founder of the ice cre@@ am company “ lic@@ k me i &apos;m delicious ” , has been saying : “ the product is incredible .
the eg@@ g is used in the ice cre@@ am to respond to the ton@@ gue in a neutral ph@@ -@@ value .
if the mouth is the prote@@ in war@@ ms , the blood pressure increases .
we have seen it in recent months , and it has appeared to us ideal to make it hal@@ lo@@ ween on the market .
it is probably the most expensive ice cre@@ am i ever made .
each ball costs me about 1@@ 40 p@@ ounds .
but for this it tas@@ tes delicious .
char@@ lie ’ s experim@@ ental company based in bri@@ st@@ ol is famous for its un@@ conventional and elegant design .
but his latest creation is to be even more ambitious .
he says : ‘ i would like to see an invi@@ sible ice cre@@ am . ’
this is , in itself , impossible because of the light re@@ fr@@ action caused by the ice cryst@@ als .
the ice cre@@ am uses flu@@ o@@ res@@ cent properties of a tor@@ n which are used by chinese scientists to produce arti@@ fici@@ ally .
the ts@@ v mor@@ sum is the winner of the european championship after six days of play , and it is still not at all a point in the hand@@ ball league .
it is now precisely the time for the team at ing@@ o e@@ h@@ ler to join the der@@ by against the ts@@ v da@@ ver@@ den , who was the winner last weekend of his first victory .
with this game begins the season new for us .
&quot; i hope that we can finally get our heads off the ground &quot; , e@@ h@@ ler &apos;s behavior is optim@@ istic .
he finally got a good idea , except for the in@@ ju@@ red h@@ end@@ ri@@ k blo@@ h@@ me , his complete k@@ ad@@ er .
in the same way , da@@ ver@@ n reli@@ es on temp@@ o game .
we must therefore increase our error rate .
first and foremost , however , we must be careful to increase the coverage , which is not a safe one at the last .
the hotel is located in the heart of the city , close to the famous shopping street , the famous &quot; k@@ ol@@ ping square &quot; and the &quot; k@@ ol@@ k@@ ata &quot; .
the game was of course a house number .
that is why we are far from being the favourite , because in the der@@ by everything can always happen .
i would , however , like to add that pan@@ it@@ z is now going to post in mor@@ sum to start a series .
jan@@ -@@ mal@@ t jo@@ d@@ at is missing .
for this , the a-@@ ju@@ g@@ end@@ lic@@ he jo@@ o@@ st wind@@ ß@@ u@@ ß , who is a member of the a-@@ ju@@ g@@ end@@ lig@@ ist h@@ c bre@@ men , is taking part in the season de@@ but .
anyone who plays in such a game is not to be at home .
hal@@ lo@@ ween 2013 : in numbers 2 , 3 , 4 , 5 , 7 , and 7 : 30 , the number of the new year ’ s eve : the world ’ s largest news , the world ’ s largest news channel , is now available in the world .
when i was small , hal@@ lo@@ ween had something mag@@ ical .
my si@@ ster and i were allowed to have c@@ and@@ les , to stay late and to prepare for our neighbor@@ hood .
today i am more like a hal@@ lo@@ ween mu@@ ff@@ le .
in the last two years , i have not declared myself willing to go from my home to s@@ wee@@ ts , and i will probably not be able to do so this year either .
but , according to statistics , i am a black she@@ ep , which hal@@ lo@@ ween is concerned .
the majority of americans – 15@@ 8 million to be precise – celebrate this year h@@ all@@ o@@ we@@ en and spend a total of 6.@@ 9 billion dollars on southern african s@@ wee@@ ts , cost@@ umes , and decor@@ ations .
one thing that i would like to focus on every hal@@ lo@@ ween then is the fact that the trend values are .
the cost@@ umes are sold about 1.@@ 2 billion of the 6.@@ 9 billion issued us dollars .
this year , the most exciting un@@ le@@ ash@@ ing items are the last cr@@ y .
women do not have to be dres@@ sed in sex@@ y clothes any@@ more , they can now also enjoy temp@@ ting food such as piz@@ za , ham@@ bur@@ ger or car@@ ro@@ ts .
as for men , i expect a lot of z@@ om@@ b@@ ies thanks to the walking dead , and i bet that the d@@ af@@ t pun@@ k world tour will be a success .
according to google , the most sought en@@ co@@ dings zo@@ di@@ ac are the bat@@ man , pi@@ rates and h@@ ex@@ en .
i susp@@ ect it is not a bad thing of tradition .
last year we adopted our dogs and we were able to make a good impression on them not alone .
indeed , americans spend $ 3@@ 30 million this year on cost@@ umes of their pe@@ ts , according to the n@@ r@@ f .
these are a lot of hot dogs , but they are not .
as far as s@@ wee@@ ts are concerned , we are not in@@ significant .
americans will be spending $ 1.@@ 9 billion this year , according to the ni@@ el@@ sen company .
these are about eur 2@@ 70 million in chocolate drinks .
so good news for the us department of commerce 41 million people who are strugg@@ ling with the s@@ log@@ an “ sweet or s@@ our ” through the neighbor@@ ho@@ ods .
in fact , we will have to import over 40 million kil@@ o@@ gram@@ s of chocolate for hal@@ lo@@ ween and – let us not de@@ lu@@ de ourselves – eat .
the only thing we do not want to con@@ sume is sugar sweet can@@ dy cor@@ n ; yet we are going to import 15 million kil@@ o@@ gram@@ s of it by hal@@ lo@@ ween , according to the national association of conf@@ ec@@ tion@@ ery manufacturers .
these are about nine billion cor@@ n gra@@ ins .
it is a myster@@ y that i still do not have the capacity to resolve .
nothing more can be heard at hal@@ lo@@ ween than houses where there are sp@@ u@@ kt .
you have great names like “ terror ” , “ the death of the wall ” , and i think that this is a real prison , “ ho@@ w@@ l-@@ o-@@ scre@@ am ” and “ the house of sho@@ ck ” .
there are indeed 1,@@ 200 officially recognised sp@@ uk@@ h@@ ä@@ user in the united states , which receives $ 500 million .
but let us finally move to the shor@@ test b@@ ite .
char@@ lie brown made us a great player with the big pum@@ p@@ k@@ in when we were children , and the cutting of a shor@@ ter lan@@ ter@@ n is like decor@@ ating christmas tree .
fortunately , the “ baby in the shor@@ test possible time ” trend began only last year thanks to pe@@ inte@@ st , so most of us have grown up with it to make the pum@@ p@@ k@@ in and not , in it .
this year , americans will spend about $ 10@@ 6 million on shor@@ ter b@@ ills , according to the us cen@@ sus bureau .
the shor@@ ter lan@@ ter@@ n , which slowly turns into the front garden , is probably from il@@ lin@@ o@@ is , where this year 2@@ 45 million kil@@ o@@ gram@@ s of shor@@ tw@@ a@@ ve were har@@ ves@@ ted .

housing fire in hel@@ m@@ bre@@ cht : rescue services , but also the supply of bo@@ iled cor@@ p@@ ses , which are not in the pipel@@ ine , are at risk of bur@@ nt .
the fire bri@@ g@@ ade had to leave the city late on thursday evening in hel@@ m@@ bre@@ cht .
a three-@@ family house in the district of hof begins at night to fire on friday .
the rescue forces are facing a ta@@ sting of the body , which is not a problem .
rescue forces have played a major role in a fire in hel@@ m@@ bre@@ cht .
whether it is a resid@@ ent handle , is still un@@ clear how a speaker of the police in bay@@ re@@ u@@ th said .
in the late thursday evening , the committee on the environment , public health and consumer policy had bur@@ ned down on the ground floor of the house .
when the fire bri@@ g@@ ade entered , the two fl@@ ames already hit out of a window .
the forces were sent to the home and found the cor@@ pse in a room .
this and another room bur@@ ned out completely .
the entire ground floor has been damaged .
all other residents were killed during the fire .
the building was not ready for the time being .
the exact cause of the fire was not clear at first .
germany &apos;s largest national church has an off@@ ensive capacity .

for young people today , the profes@@ sion is very attractive and offers good prospects for the future , said pa@@ st@@ or ma@@ this bur@@ fi@@ en ( 43 ) in con@@ vers@@ ation with the ev@@ angel@@ ical press service .
it is attractive to increase the working and daily working life itself .
with bur@@ fi@@ as , the state church has for the first time set up a pa@@ st@@ or on a full site to ap@@ point young people for the study of the@@ ology .
at present , fewer and fewer young people are choosing to study , the@@ ology and the arts .
bur@@ fi@@ as is doing this in the process of dec@@ on@@ struc@@ ting : &quot; god &apos;s voice is quiet , the world is lou@@ dly &quot; .
the cal@@ v@@ ad@@ os are the most beautiful and most beautiful places in the world .
i am the lord of my calendar and i can present my priorities there where there is an important point of view for me .
pa@@ st@@ ors could be considered as sa@@ il@@ ors very close to the people .
she earned so much as teachers and could do well to live from it .
certainly , in the free economy , more is paid , but the@@ o@@ logi@@ ans would have a safe employ@@ er .
that is something that will help young people today who are not only about career but also about a sin@@ ner filled work@@ .
according to the national church , which has three quarters of lower sa@@ x@@ ony , the number of deaths in the country is currently around 60 per year .
at the same time , some 40 students of a the@@ ology studies begin their vi@@ k@@ ari@@ at .
in spar@@ sely popu@@ lated periph@@ eral areas such as the res@@ in , em@@ s@@ land or the w@@ end@@ land , it may be difficult to fill jobs in the future .
bur@@ fi@@ as wants to promote , among other things , student days for young people and also to invite prominent people to study the@@ ology .
the the@@ ology studies offer a broad training .
it is even possible to become the president of the federal republic .

fire bri@@ g@@ ade to rescue a bit@@ ch is called , which has been 15 meters above the ground on a dangerous rock .

the fire bri@@ g@@ ade managed to get a bit@@ ch in safety .
the nine months old co@@ ck@@ er@@ sp@@ ani@@ el@@ -@@ bit@@ ch ru@@ by was killed after a road accident on sunday afternoon .
scot@@ t al@@ der@@ son , 25 , and his friends , be@@ ec@@ ky hal@@ l , 20 , who were denied the dog , came to the quar@@ ry fl@@ app@@ it in den@@ hol@@ me , west yor@@ k@@ sh@@ ire to ru@@ by again .

it was in the middle of the rock wall – 15 meters from top and the ground .
she did not move a mus@@ cle during her rescue – she was like sti@@ ff fro@@ zen .
but now it is doing well .
it subsequently took a few dogs and was then taken to the hospital .
this was a rather unusual use .
the fact that the dog is discovered is a incredible experience .
peter la@@ u , specialist in technical rescue services , has been working on the project “ ru@@ by had a huge problem .
there was the possibility that they would be very seriously in@@ ju@@ red or worse .
ru@@ by was born in the uk , where he was born in the united states .

i could not believe that they were really up there .
it was wonderful to see you back in the poor .
the veter@@ in@@ arian explained that if exhaus@@ tion is too large and they have collap@@ sed , it would probably have cr@@ ash@@ ed .
the fire bri@@ g@@ ades have done a great job .
it was really cour@@ ageous to do what you did .
we are simply so grateful and each of them was absolutely incredible .

george ker@@ ev@@ an : european un@@ bun@@ d@@ ling gives the sco@@ ts the choice
a new day , a new story of terror about independence .
this time we will be war@@ ned that an independent scotland would not be necessary to protect the schengen area .
this provides the keyword for stories and stories about pass@@ port controls in ber@@ w@@ ick and a story of bar@@ bed wire .
indeed , in the street hall of the city of strasbourg , reference was made to the possible economic benefits that could be gained by greater freedom of travel in the rest of europe , but this was , as is expected , not included in the head@@ lines .
nor did anyone mention that the eu member states often take their strict rules on themselves .
since scotland is not currently a member of the schengen area , the continued use of the schengen agreement would be just a small conc@@ ession for brussels in exchange for what we can really expect from the sco@@ ts .
so really no story .
and one that has already been in the years , that they have already been exposed to a fo@@ ssi@@ l : the first time i have called the “ independence means pass@@ port controls ” -@@ ente at least 40 years ago .
a very interesting point is the constant repe@@ ti@@ tion of this ancient story .
why talk of an independent scotland ?
why the london j@@ ail against the europe of brussels ?
these are the real european news : the great , after the war , europe &apos;s plan to un@@ ite is dead .
the euro crisis has brought the european project officially to a stand@@ still .
throughout the eu , parties are gaining ground , the anti-@@ eu parties are losing the euro as a common currency .
even in germany , the euro@@ s@@ cep@@ tic party could not find alternative for germany – founded only this year – almost five million votes in the german federal election in september .
there have always been domestic opposition to the plan to create a federal europe .
the current economic crisis , however , is a turning point .
because of the berlin and the european central bank &apos;s strict au@@ ster@@ ity policies linked to the stra@@ it@@ jack@@ et , which the government of each country has invested in by stic@@ king to the single currency , the many people of europe believe that the project is a success .
the crisis in the euro has little to do with national governments ’ taking excessive fiscal deficits – the most recent crisis in greece .
instead , the euro@@ system has extended its members to exchange rates , which are not acceptable to german ex@@ porters .
without the possibility of de@@ valu@@ ing the local currency , southern europe will find itself with a buil@@ t-@@ in productivity dis@@ advantage over germany .
the only way is to cut wages and public spending , and that is to encourage investment in berlin .
behind the current et@@ at and currency problems , there is a deep o@@ sc@@ ill@@ ation of european productivity .
as a result of the regulations laid down by brussels on &apos; green &apos; energy lines – a code for subsid@@ ising french farmers and german energy companies on the expense of consumers – the european industry is paying a little more than the united states .
this is a par@@ aly@@ sing cost dis@@ advantage , as we have already seen in green@@ mouth .
all wage fix@@ ing in the world protec@@ ts european petro@@ chemical industry from being hit by cheap american oil .
as a result , a re@@ vol@@ t is emerging , especially in france , the former che@@ er@@ leader of the eu .
after the war , the political elite of france saw the eu as a vehicle for the destruction of the country ’ s economy .
but berlin does not need paris more than a ga@@ te@@ way to political legitimacy , and has pus@@ hed europe ’ s own economic policy , thereby fu@@ eling the trou@@ b@@ led french economy .
the result : marine le pen ’ s right-@@ wing , eu ho@@ sti@@ le front national has just launched a decisive re-@@ election , thereby increasing the power of the socialists .
the national front is now the most popular party in france , with 24 % of the elec@@ tor@@ ate – a timely warning to the british labour government .
what makes le pen so special with its newly won popul@@ arity among the white french workers ?
it wants to hold the eu elections next year to set up an anti-@@ eu , anti-@@ community blo@@ c in the european parliament .
if the anti-@@ eu parties are well represented in these elections – and this is very possible – they will be able to take place for the first time in this block .
this is the point that i would like to make : in the not too dist@@ ant future , the growing res@@ ent@@ ment of the eu and the single currency will lead to the abolition of the euro .
the eu will not dis@@ appear , but it will be more like the “ europe of ( sovereign ) states . ”
germany and a few of its satellite economies may be stic@@ king to the euro , but france and southern europe will be forced to withdraw to their own curren@@ cies .
i expect the commission to be guided by this project in the hope that it will be able to join the united states .
but washington is not showing growing interest in the pacific region , as the us and japan alone are doing in the atlantic rain .
where is scotland in all this ?
we can decide to create a region of ( ultimately ) small ( england ) that is not a part of england .
or we can put our own economic interests to rest – including , berlin and brussels – in saying what they want to get where they are .
i susp@@ ect scotland will be able to play a more lo@@ ose european union .
cooperation with others , similar to the united states , is not possible in a europe of nations that is not feder@@ ated .
otherwise , we should consider making it more similar to norway and increasing our economic independence .
the sn@@ p government in scotland is a very important partner for the european union , remark@@ ably .
it would be a ri@@ dic@@ ulous thing for scotland to now op@@ t for independence , just to be able to get a savings policy from berlin and brussels .
early pub@@ er@@ ty : faster adult growth , and the ability to grow up faster .
a@@ fro@@ -@@ american and h@@ is@@ pan@@ ic girls tend to reach pub@@ er@@ ty rather than their white counter@@ parts , as studies show .
physical changes mean not yet directly the pub@@ er@@ ty of the body , but the physical and mental health of the body .
there is no evidence that the hor@@ mon@@ es or other chemicals are not responsible .
experts believe that the ep@@ ide@@ mic of ob@@ es@@ ity is a tri@@ gger of early pub@@ er@@ ty .
the trend towards early pub@@ er@@ ty is less pron@@ oun@@ ced among young people .
the former c@@ n@@ n correspon@@ dence was sent to the us by p@@ at e@@ ther@@ id@@ ge , a journ@@ alist speci@@ alizing in child health and family issues .
if a mother is wor@@ ried when her daughter is already at the age of seven or eight years of bre@@ asts and sh@@ am@@ po@@ os ?
the annual conference of the pa@@ edi@@ at@@ r@@ ici@@ an association american academy of pedi@@ at@@ ric@@ s will be held this week in or@@ lan@@ do , fl@@ ori@@ da , the pa@@ edi@@ at@@ ric en@@ do@@ cr@@ ine doctor declared dr. paul k@@ ap@@ lan .
“ i spend a lot of time trying to re@@ assure parents – usually the problem is not a sign of their being able to quickly recover .
obvious ads of the development , such as growing bre@@ asts , sh@@ am@@ po@@ os and ar@@ mp@@ it hair as well as body sm@@ ell , are more common in girls .
however , there was only a s@@ light shift in the age of men@@ ar@@ ch ( the first rec@@ ur@@ rence of the disease ) over the last 40 years .
in the united states , the average age of the population is 12.@@ 5 years , slightly less than 12.@@ 75 in 197@@ 0 .
&quot; if the development of bre@@ asts begins , it still takes at least two to three years to get to the men@@ ar@@ che , &quot; said k@@ ap@@ lo@@ wit@@ z , also author of the book &quot; early pub@@ er@@ ty at girls : the essential advis@@ er .
time is the most accurate test of how the pub@@ er@@ ty progres@@ ses .
it is controversial that what is actually the beginning of pub@@ er@@ ty is , but it is “ early reti@@ rement ” that is needed if bre@@ ast enlargement is to be accompanied by a boost of growth before an age of eight .
in most cases , the process slow@@ es down or stag@@ nation .
for faster progress , the us government could allow tests to be carried out by a en@@ di@@ k@@ ron@@ o@@ log@@ ist , so that serious problems such as t@@ um@@ ors or cy@@ sts can be excluded .
there are treatment methods for dela@@ ying early men@@ str@@ ual and early de@@ population .
the recommendations for a drug policy or hor@@ mon@@ al therapy are based on the principle of age of the child , the speed of development , the rate of growth and the emo@@ tional mat@@ ur@@ ity .
psycho@@ social aspects are also important .
k@@ ap@@ lo@@ wit@@ z is re@@ luc@@ t@@ ant as regards medic@@ ation , but he ad@@ mits : “ sup@@ pressing the pub@@ er@@ ty can cause behavi@@ oral problems and feel@@ ings of girls to mi@@ ti@@ gate , unlike their old friends .
the other major problem is understand@@ able : parents simply do not want their very young dau@@ gh@@ ters to have the period .
“ they worry about the pregn@@ ancy risk , or about how much they can reduce the hygi@@ en@@ ic side . ”
“ it was a sho@@ ck , ” a woman re@@ members , whose daughter was killed ten days after her death .
although there are initial signs and we are talking about men@@ stru@@ ation , it was emo@@ tional .
she was afraid to say that she was not a member of the european parliament , and she was ex@@ ci@@ ted and ex@@ ci@@ ted about her school .
there are many widely public@@ ised the@@ ories about the causes of early de@@ pression .
but there are no conclu@@ sive evidence that the us is not able to control hor@@ mon@@ es in milk or other food , chemicals in the environment or sexual health .
bo@@ ys are coming to the pu@@ b like girls .
k@@ ap@@ lo@@ wit@@ z believes that the most convinc@@ ing pre@@ mise is the ep@@ ide@@ mic of fe@@ tal stem cells .
he supported the implementation of a study in 2001 on girls aged between six and nine years old , which was linked to body f@@ at and the entry into the pub@@ er@@ ty .
other studies support this conclusion , but it does not include many other factors that could play a role .
in this country , afric@@ an-@@ american and h@@ is@@ pan@@ ic girls tend to reach pub@@ er@@ ty rather than their white counter@@ parts .
there are different explanations for this .
glob@@ ally , an early pub@@ er@@ ty of all kinds seems to be influenced by economic conditions , the climate , and the gen@@ es .
another myster@@ y : although young people do not know the face and sh@@ am@@ po@@ o hair earlier , it is still a trend that leads to a full-@@ fle@@ d@@ ged earlier pub@@ er@@ ty .
other doctors on the a@@ ap conference are emphasi@@ sing the complexity of the issue .

jum@@ bo manufacturer stri@@ kes in the face of large orders for seat width and seat width , and the manufacturer is argu@@ ing against the same rules in the face of large orders for large orders over seat width .
between leading aircraft manufacturers , it is clear that the new technology is not enough to cover the wide range of seats in the tourist class .
the dispute is about the future of the seat , the pass@@ port of long flights , the seat width of the passenger class – not always the ones to be dealt with by the airlines most , but this is the stated space .
airbus called for a new fire to be created this week , which will allow for a minimum of 46 cm ( 18 in@@ ches ) in the tourist class .
the debate comes at a time when the aircraft industry is facing the prospect of a new type of aircraft being manufactured .
like the re@@ ar part of the aircraft , the aircraft is designed to be ro@@ ws with nine or ten seats – and the most important factor for the economic results that the new “ mini-@@ ” aircraft will bring .
bo@@ eing claims that its modern@@ ised 7@@ 7@@ 7@@ x was a bo@@ eing 4@@ 06 person se@@ ated in the tourist class , which had more than 17 in@@ ches wide .
airbus decla@@ res that the compe@@ ting version of the a3@@ 50 will be delivered to 3@@ 50 passengers in 18 in@@ ch wid@@ ths in the tourist class , with nine per row .
aircraft gi@@ ants share a common belief that the us is the best place to discuss technical details through advertising .
now airbus is appe@@ aling to the du@@ ba@@ i air@@ show where the 7@@ 7@@ 7@@ x is equipped with more than 100 orders .
recently , the company posted an ad that marked the beginning of a new ad war .
“ bo@@ eing is proposing long-@@ hau@@ l flights in seats that are nar@@ ro@@ wer than regional tur@@ bo@@ -@@ pro@@ ps , ” says airbus sales manager , airbus .
in view of the changing di@@ etary hab@@ its , people become th@@ ick@@ er , but aircraft seats have not rad@@ ically changed .
between the early 197@@ 0s , when the bo@@ eing 7@@ 47 was the modern long-@@ range journey , the city was given a new name , and the weight of the male average man was increased by between 40 and 49 years .
the wa@@ ist range of the male average is about 10 % .
airbus says its ri@@ val is not in line with a se@@ ating concept from the 19@@ 50 ’ s , when the average body size of the newly launched “ je@@ t set ” was reduced .
i think that airbus has carried out investigations which have shown that the use of an additional customs duty ( 2.@@ 5@@ 4 cm ) per seat will not improve the quality of sleep by 53 % .
bo@@ eing is den@@ ying the figures of airbus at the se@@ ven@@ -@@ mil@@ li@@ on-@@ dollar rate , and says that it is not the manufacturers &apos; discre@@ tion to decide how airlines should balance flight tari@@ ffs and equipment .
the company also states that according to studies , the experience on the aircraft of more than the seat width is decreas@@ ing .
“ it really is about giving airlines flexibility , ” says the rapporteur , who is responsible for the safety of passengers .
you do not want us to dict@@ ate to you what you make prof@@ itable .
you know your business better than anyone else .
for passengers , it is about more el@@ bo@@ ws freedom , but for manufacturers it will increasingly be more difficult to find a solution to the problem of sales .
behind the argument is a race for aircraft orders with a estimated price of $ 3@@ 00@@ b@@ n .
how re@@ u@@ ters first reported in july that the project is now in its se@@ ating layout .
both airbus and bo@@ eing have claimed that 20 percent more efficiency per seat is achieved in their latest two-@@ engine long-@@ hau@@ l designs and that the market leader in this segment is the 3@@ 6@@ 5-@@ seat a3@@ 20 family .
the statements by bo@@ eing on the results depend in part on the fact that the 7@@ 7@@ 7@@ 7@@ x , with its ten seats per row , is compatible with the original design of nine seats in the 7@@ 77 .
the increased costs per unit are still too small for the current eu machinery with ten seats per row .
“ bo@@ eing qu@@ et@@ sch@@ t therefore squ@@ ee@@ zes more seats into his plane to make it more competitive to our products , ” says k@@ ev@@ in ken@@ ist@@ on , head of passenger comfort at the european air@@ bus .
on the other hand , analy@@ sts say that full cab@@ ins with ten seats per row are worth of the 7@@ 7@@ 7@@ s indicated that many passengers would choose closer arrangement .
“ eigh@@ teen d@@ war@@ ves of seat width would be great for passengers who are not really aware of the fact that , from an economic point of view , the airbus offer is not affected by the threat posed by the 7@@ 77 ” , says mar@@ y .
airbus and bo@@ eing offer no seats in the european union , but a catalogue of suppliers , from which the airlines can choose which to choose .
the world travel@@ er jet sel@@ lers even carry band@@ width .
even if you want to enjoy comfort , the rooms are equipped with je@@ ts with high compres@@ sion rates .
airbus offers an a3@@ 50 with ten@@ -@@ se@@ ater ro@@ ws , but it has not yet sold , according to its own statement .
until recently , airbus has stressed how important it is to make cab@@ ins more adap@@ table and to provide a wide range of seats for some je@@ ts .
without the support of the only other manufacturer of large modern je@@ ts , experts say that the call for a new industry standard is likely to dis@@ appear , but from the wave of 7@@ 7@@ 7@@ x sales .
new anti-@@ nic@@ ot@@ ine vacc@@ ine could help the pleasure of smoking .
scientists have developed an anti-@@ nic@@ ot@@ ine vacc@@ ine to help the fun of smoking .
a single do@@ se of vacc@@ ine could be used to treat m@@ ice for life before nic@@ ot@@ ine ad@@ diction .
before testing humans , further tests are needed , which is still a few years away , but professor ron@@ ald c@@ ry@@ st@@ al of the we@@ ill cor@@ n@@ ell medical college has been working in new york to prepare the first results .
“ we are very hope@@ ful that this type of vacc@@ ination strategy will bring millions of smo@@ kers to the world to try to stop smoking while taking all the drugs available on the market .
the new vacc@@ ine contains a harm@@ less virus that is so modified that it will not affect the genetic information on the production of nic@@ ot@@ ine crops .
the virus inf@@ ected selec@@ tively the li@@ ver cells , which then cause a constant flow of anti@@ bodies and are then produced .
the anti@@ bodies ja@@ en the ni@@ ko@@ tin mo@@ lec@@ ules and the blood .
in attempts , vacc@@ inated m@@ ice kept the animals from being fed and then left the animal to feed the normal activity level .
m@@ ice without vacc@@ ination , on the other hand , would have taken a “ time out ” , the researchers declared , a sign that the nic@@ ot@@ ine would reach its brain .
the experim@@ ents are published in the science translation journal .
earlier tobacco vacc@@ ines suggested that the disease could be prevented , and that is why the disease was not so widespread .
vacc@@ inations had to be used to maintain the anti@@ body pe@@ el .
but the costs of the new vacc@@ ine are probably much lower than they are , because it trans@@ forms li@@ ver cells into anti@@ bodies .
as professor crystal said , the european union could be a source of vacc@@ ine for people who are in a safe position to be ad@@ min@@ istered to children before they are temp@@ ted to take a ci@@ gare@@ tte .
but it is more likely that smo@@ kers would use it to stop .
“ you then know : if you start to smo@@ ke again , you feel very un@@ comfortable because of nic@@ ot@@ ine vacc@@ ine .
british scientists have said that the results are interesting , but at the same time war@@ ned that further research is needed .
tri@@ po@@ di den@@ ies that from o@@ be@@ id influenced by the fact that he was born to o@@ be@@ id , he was a man of the same name .
the former minister of the laboratory party jo@@ e tri@@ po@@ di from new som@@ alia , who is now being investig@@ ated by the state corruption commission , is being in@@ sti@@ g@@ ated .
the former n@@ s@@ w minister is den@@ ying that the rules on maritime surveillance are not being applied at the request of his political ment@@ or ed@@ die ob@@ id , who has been hi@@ ding hidden hol@@ dings in three sites on state level .
the independent group of the european people &apos;s party ( christian democrats ) and european democrats has voted against the report .
now , because of the acc@@ us@@ ation , tri@@ po@@ di has been taken from o@@ be@@ id &apos;s hidden interest in the properties .
for years , i have been talking about the situation in the united states , which began in 2005 , and i think that the government has been pressing for public tend@@ ers for le@@ ase contracts .
the po@@ pes were opposed to this and wanted longer mat@@ ur@@ ities .
in 2009 , le@@ asing contracts for companies on the circuit qu@@ ay were awarded to the o@@ be@@ ids ann@@ ually for eur 2.5 million .
tri@@ po@@ di , who was born in february 2006 to november 2009 , had originally op@@ ted for public tend@@ ers .
but he st@@ um@@ b@@ led upon the changes at the request of o@@ be@@ id , who , like tri@@ po@@ di , confirmed that he had been prepared to re@@ design the le@@ ase arrangements of the government .
one of the ic@@ ac &apos;s telephone letters showed conver@@ sa@@ tions from august and september 2007 between o@@ be@@ id , tri@@ po@@ di and ste@@ ve dun@@ n , a leading official who was sent to the ministry of ports .
“ was this the case in these telephone conver@@ sa@@ tions about the development of commercial packaging technology ?
no , he rep@@ lied , &quot; no . &quot;
i cannot remember the words that were discussed , but that was what it was definitely not .

israeli figh@@ ter plan@@ es are att@@ acking targets in syria .
israeli hun@@ ting plan@@ es would have been a target on thursday night in the sy@@ ri@@ an port of lat@@ ak@@ ia , confirmed a leading government official against fo@@ x news .
the official explained that he was not going to do anything about it , but he said that it was at least one .
according to associated press , it was a “ new generation of russian sa@@ -@@ 12@@ 5-@@ ro@@ c@@ kets . ”
at least twice , israel has already launched air stri@@ kes on missi@@ le supplies to syria this year .
foreign workers with 4@@ 5@@ 7-@@ visa could “ be authentic@@ ated to veri@@ fy authentic@@ ity ” , and the country ’ s government could be required to carry out a “ real test ” to ensure that the visa is valid .
the government is considering , within the framework of extended measures , a “ real test ” for foreign workers with 4@@ 57 vis@@ as .
if the test is introduced , it would come through a criteri@@ on for which the test should not be used .
today , a proposal for discussion by the government has been published after the former labour party members , ma@@ x@@ ine m@@ ck@@ em@@ w , have with@@ drawn the government &apos;s comments on foreign workers .
“ l@@ oud statements like being foreign@@ ers should be at the back of the country , ” and austr@@ ali@@ ans first set up are a very un@@ pleasant re@@ treat in times when trade unions are seeking a protected labour market , ” she said the president .
histor@@ ically , the concept of “ soft power ” was to be protected – and , if some in the region were to see a echo of this historical ar@@ te@@ fact , they would not have me surprised .
the proposal for discussion out@@ lines twelve measures that were once adopted by the former minister for immigration , chr@@ is bow@@ en .
immigration ministers bren@@ dan o &apos;@@ con@@ nor , who was sent@@ enced to talks yesterday on trafficking in human beings in s@@ ri lan@@ ka , has taken five of the recommended changes .
if the &quot; real crisis criteri@@ on &quot; is adopted , then the person who has a visa to apply for it could be interpreted as saying that the &quot; real person &apos;s application was valid in the cases where the visa was requested .
firms could also be obliged to account for the number of 4@@ 57 vis@@ as sent to the united states after the european union had previously refused to grant a small number of workers .

the british government has launched a study which will show the benefits of h@@ s@@ 2 rail for scotland .
in the work of h@@ s@@ 2 ltd is proposed to start from the beginning of phase 1 in 20@@ 26 high-@@ speed connections between scotland and the uk .
transport minister bar@@ on@@ ess k@@ ram@@ er said that the project ‘ will bring britain closer together ’ .
the scot@@ tish transport minister , ke@@ ith brown , stated that he was very pleased to work with the british government on this plan .
phase 1 consists of a new high-@@ speed railway connection between london and the west mid@@ lands .
after comple@@ ting phase 2 , there will be connections to man@@ ch@@ ester and le@@ eds .
in june , the government correc@@ ted the estimated cost of building the high-@@ speed rail network between london and norway .
the british government , which has been in talks with transport scotland , has been using h@@ s@@ 2 ltd to seek further stress tests .
this includes the possibility of a travel period of at least three hours or less from gl@@ as@@ go@@ w and ed@@ in@@ burgh to london .
bar@@ on@@ ess k@@ ram@@ er said : ‘ our goal for h@@ s@@ 2 is a truly national route network , which will bring great britain and its cities closer together . ’
we are going with h@@ s@@ 2 because it is a huge benefit .
without it , we face a crisis of capacity in our rail network .
but it is also about the link between 18 british cities , including gl@@ as@@ go@@ w and ed@@ in@@ burgh , which , thanks to h@@ s@@ 2 , is improved .
the scot@@ tish secretary of state ali@@ sta@@ ir car@@ michael comm@@ ented : “ today ’ s announcement is a good news for scotland .
on behalf of the scot@@ tish government , ke@@ ith brown car@@ michael called for “ un@@ equi@@ vo@@ cal ” support for the scot@@ tish integration into the h@@ s@@ 2 network .
brown said , “ the high-@@ speed internet is a huge threat to the environment .
we are therefore pleased to be able to act as a partner of the british government and to discuss the options for a high-@@ speed rail link in scotland , which will bring benefits to everyone and make the gl@@ as@@ go@@ w-@@ ed@@ in@@ burgh link more effective .
i look forward to continuing the report with the british ministers .
rules on electronic equipment in aircraft remain un@@ changed in australia for the time being .
austr@@ ali@@ an passengers must also continue to be able to buy tab@@ lets and smar@@ t@@ phones at the start and lan@@ ding , despite efforts in the us to improve the regulations governing such equipment .
the us federal aviation authority ( f@@ da ) is a global leader in aviation and aviation services .
during most of the flight , pass@@ port holders are already allowed to do so , but many people find it an@@ no@@ ying that they are not able to leave their e-@@ books at the start and the lan@@ ding .
austr@@ ali@@ an companies observe the decision to use the us government to implement them un@@ du@@ ly .
the air traffic control agency casa also stated that it would be necessary to look at the announcement , but stressed that the restrictions on the use of electronic equipment in critical air ph@@ ases in australia were still not in force .
“ casa has currently no specific regulations regarding the use of electronic devices .
the issue is subject to provisions that state that airlines must maintain safety at all times and that passengers must be able to use the safety instructions given by cab@@ in personnel .
vir@@ gin has already started with the casa discussions about a expansion of use of his wi-fi entertainment program .
“ we would be looking at the authorisation of electronic devices by casa , but we are not convinced that the directive will improve the customer experience , having been adopted ( d@@ n@@ v ) .
q@@ ant@@ as explained that one would not be able to apply the current regulations for the time being .
“ our current directives provide that electronic devices must be checked at the start and lan@@ ding stage , and we have at present no plans to use them . ” the european commission explained .
the fa@@ a rules apply to us airlines .
however , we are always interested in developments in regulations that affect passengers .
the decision will have a negative impact on us societies depending on the age of the fleet .
they must prove that their aircraft are capable of preventing radio inter@@ ference from mobile devices , and mobile hand@@ books , training materials , mobile phone bag@@ gage programs , and customer instruc@@ tion must be changed .
“ after an airline has exce@@ eded the tolerance of its fleet , it can offer passengers the use of port@@ able , ligh@@ t-@@ weight electronic devices such as tab@@ lets , e-@@ book read@@ ers and smar@@ t@@ phones in any height . ”
in rare cases , when the camera is not visible , the crew will instruc@@ t the passengers , while the equipment is turned off during the lan@@ ding .
the group recommended that the main causes of the problem should be to control he@@ avi@@ er devices safe@@ ly under the seat or in the com@@ part@@ ments over se@@ ated .

the first was the first time that the guests were listening to their songs .
the southern grand@@ stands , on the other hand , where the loy@@ al members of the loy@@ al and lou@@ dest b@@ v@@ b fans are , were initially excep@@ tionally quiet : no healthy voice , no voice , no batt@@ le@@ calls .
the po@@ dium of cap@@ o , which otherwise would be the joint mo@@ tivation , remained in the open .
and right at the front of the grand@@ stand , the crow@@ ds of the european parliament , with the in@@ scri@@ ption &quot; section ban sta@@ dium &quot; , were blo@@ wn out .
only as a go@@ al@@ ke@@ eper roman we@@ iden@@ f@@ ell@@ er as always the first b@@ v@@ b player entered the place , short time je@@ al@@ ous bur@@ st up .
when his team colleagues followed , there was a l@@ oud ch@@ ant and a r@@ aging scar@@ f - but not everywhere .
the central blocks of 12 and 13 of the south grand@@ stand represent the scene of nothing .
also that sta@@ dium spo@@ kes@@ man nor@@ bert dic@@ kel once again had the positive experiences of recent days - der@@ by victory , victory over ar@@ sen@@ al , treaty extension of tra@@ iner j@@ ür@@ gen k@@ lo@@ p@@ p - sor@@ ted out not for the event .
only five minutes before the launch , the commission took a decision on the cap@@ o .
finally , like always , the south grand@@ stand was on the line - and finally here again as usual was the lau@@ gh@@ est place in the sta@@ dium .
and at the latest as with an@@ p@@ fe@@ ff from the southern grand@@ stand the l@@ oud call &quot; der@@ by@@ winner is on &quot; came , was again everything like always .
the silence previously was probably a reaction to what happened in the past few days .
just before the re@@ vi@@ er@@ der@@ by at the f@@ c sch@@ al@@ ke 04 , some of the travel@@ ers of b@@ v@@ b had launched light missi@@ les into the public ran@@ ks and into the square .

&quot; i for@@ bi@@ dden this , &quot; he explained .
zero tolerance is a fundamental principle of the py@@ ro@@ techn@@ ics .
in addition , the ul@@ tr@@ as have been given various possibilities of pun@@ ishment - until tuesday they have time to choose a more op@@ a@@ que one .
otherwise , i would say , the commission will be forced to withdraw its proposal by the end of next week .

for this reason , millions of people in the region are turning to p@@ f@@ and@@ h@@ ä@@ user after families have increased the pressure from rising living costs and increasing household and consumer debt .
after five years of robust growth since the global financial crisis and cheap loans due to a lo@@ ose fiscal policy in the developed economies , families with low income and poor families are seeking p@@ f@@ and@@ houses to help them get the best out of the economy .

rescue packages are needed for the next ten years .
austr@@ ali@@ an government insi@@ sts on the har@@ sh conditions imposed by the rescue package .
federal health minister t@@ any@@ a p@@ liber@@ se@@ k announced that the comm@@ on@@ wealth office will be “ promp@@ t action ” to ensure that the crisis is a@@ ver@@ ted by a ag@@ eing population of the island state , a higher rate of population , a higher level of chr@@ onic disease .
the funding for a period of four years was increased following consul@@ tations with the independent tas@@ man@@ ian me@@ p andre@@ w wil@@ ki@@ e .
“ the government has created an emergency rescue package that will help to restore the country ’ s economy .
the 3@@ 2@@ 5-@@ million d@@ ol@@ lar@@ -@@ package includes 31 million dollars of emergency aid for election services .
the new version of the new version of the new version of the original version of the original version of the original version is now available .
there are also money for day@@ care clin@@ ics in ho@@ b@@ art and laun@@ ce@@ ston , better after@@ care after stal@@ in and the rest of the family are specialised in the training of specialists , psycho@@ logical health services and the introduction of a system for drawing up .
“ these investments are in line with the ideas that have been put to me by clin@@ ic staff who have told me that they are the best way to improve the tas@@ man@@ ian health system , ” said tan@@ ya p@@ liber@@ se@@ k .
the minister insi@@ sted on strict reporting and monitoring of the situation .
the state must be able to maintain the current level of funding to finance money from the comm@@ on@@ wealth .
a three-@@ member government is going to be set up to ensure that the federal state provides health services as effectively and efficiently as possible .
like wil@@ ki@@ e today , the 3@@ 25 million dollars would be of little use if “ they were not backed by real reform , but that would make the public tas@@ man@@ ian health system sustainable . ”
despite this , he p@@ raised the government for having respon@@ ded to his request for urgent help , which he initially addressed to the prime minister at the beginning of may .
“ i am confident that the federal aid will make a major contribution to ensuring the public health system of the federal state is exemp@@ t from the worry list , ” said wil@@ ki@@ e .
according to the government of the federal state , these electoral benefits will largely reflect the recent cuts .
but the health spo@@ kes@@ man for the opposition at federal level , peter du@@ tt@@ on , is of the opinion that today &apos;s announcement is just a “ pav@@ ing solution ” .
“ we are therefore in a position to today because the laboratory state government has 4@@ 30 million dollars to pay from the health system ” , said he said to ab@@ c tv .
it is not acceptable that a government of state should have spent nearly half a billion dollars out of the system and that the comm@@ on@@ wealth should pay 300 million .
du@@ tt@@ on called for the liber@@ se@@ k to guarantee that not a single member of the rescue package would be able to provide additional bureaucracy .

also on thursday , a sym@@ posi@@ um of sy@@ ri@@ an activi@@ sts announced that more than 1@@ 20@@ ,000 people have been killed since the civil war began three years ago .
the announcement by the organization for the prohibi@@ tion of chemical weapons ( op@@ c@@ w ) came one day before the date on the day before the date on the day of the date on the day of the date on the day of the date on the day of the day of the day of the day of the day of the day of the day of the day of the day of the day of the day of the day of the day of the day of the release of the day of the day of the
november 1 , which the united nations general assembly , based in the h@@ ague , has set up to take over all the facilities for the manufacture of chemical weapons or to “ in@@ oper@@ ably ” to prevent them from being used , including all the machinery for mix@@ ing chemicals .
the conclusion of this process , which is basically the first stage of destruction , is a major mil@@ est@@ one in an ambitious plan for the future .
the destruction of facilities means that syria has no new chemical weapons .
dam@@ as@@ c@@ us , however , must begin to use existing weapons and supplies to prevent the destruction of the country .
it is assumed that there are about 1@@ ,000 tonnes of chemicals in the country , including the chemical and ar@@ sen@@ ic gas and the ner@@ ve gas sar@@ in .
the announcement came at a time when the european parliament was strugg@@ ling on thursday in sa@@ fir@@ a , from which experts say that the situation is very different .
the group of activi@@ sts who have a network of activi@@ sts in syria who have reduced the number of deaths explained on thursday , 1@@ 20@@ .@@ 2@@ 96 people were dead .
of these , 6@@ 1,@@ 0@@ 67 were civili@@ ans , including 6@@ ,@@ 3@@ 65 children .
on the government side , 2@@ 9.@@ 9@@ 54 of them were the army of president bas@@ ha@@ r as@@ sad , 18@@ .@@ 6@@ 7@@ 8 were government friendly figh@@ ters and 18@@ 7 leban@@ ese soldiers were killed .
also among the dead are 2.@@ 20@@ 2 deser@@ ted arm@@ ies , and the 5.@@ 3@@ 75 batt@@ le@@ men of the opposition , many of them foreign@@ ers .
on 25 july , the un estimated the number of deaths this conflict had been estimated at 10@@ 0,000 since march 2011 .
this figure has not been updated .
the conflict has claimed about two million people from the country .
as@@ sad ’ s troops have been fighting for weeks in sa@@ fir@@ a against the re@@ be@@ ls , many of which have links with al-@@ q@@ a@@ ed@@ a groups .
the centre said that it has not been able to prevent losses on both sides on thursday , but it has not given any details .
the fighting under@@ lines the danger that the chemical weapons inspec@@ tors face .
according to the op@@ c@@ w , which is closely linked to the united nations , the “ now convinced that the world is all about syria ” team is there .
that is why we are not yet able to carry out any further inspection activities .
at the beginning of the week the inspec@@ tors said they had not completed the first round of inspec@@ tions and that 21 out of 23 of the sites designated by dam@@ as@@ c@@ us were visited .
because of security concerns , the visit of two institutions was not possible , the inspec@@ tors said .
on thursday , the op@@ wc , the two sites were named after sy@@ ri@@ an statement , “ abandoned ... and the existing objects of the chemical weapon program were at other named facilities . ”
it was not immediately clear whether the site was in sa@@ fir@@ a one of the two facilities that the opposition had to carry out .
syria has a plan for the complete destruction of its chemical weapons , which will be discussed next month by the executive committee of the op@@ wc .
&quot; i prefer the hat to the bag of bra@@ very and courage , which you all have to show when ful@@ filling the most challenging mission that has ever been carried out by this organisation . &quot;
since three years , the sun@@ ni musli@@ ms , who are mainly sun@@ ni , have been fighting against as@@ sad ’ s government and its security forces , who have been a source of inspiration to many members of the al@@ a@@ wi@@ tes .
with regard to further developments , the head of the observ@@ atory , ram@@ i ab@@ dur@@ ra@@ h@@ man , said that there was a strong explo@@ sion in an air defence facility in the sy@@ ri@@ an coastal province of lat@@ ak@@ ia on wednesday .
the cause of the explo@@ sion is not known , he explained .
an@@ ger at judgment for bom@@ b@@ ings of bal@@ i
survi@@ v@@ ors and rela@@ tives of the 20@@ 2 people who died in 2002 at the bom@@ b attack in bal@@ i were not able to respond to the an@@ ger that was expressed in the last of the in@@ sti@@ g@@ ators who were tried .
pa@@ te@@ k , who was born just under ten years as one of the most sought after people in south-@@ east asia , was arrested yesterday for his role in building a sp@@ ur@@ ious bom@@ b .
with the suspension of the penalty , it could be dis@@ missed after 15 years .
the 4@@ 5-@@ year-@@ old was accused of mass murder and has been sent@@ enced to death for the attack on two night clubs in the popular tourist district of ku@@ ta , where he was killed by 20@@ 2 people , including 88 austr@@ ali@@ ans .
a claim for guil@@ t was also made in a number of terrorist charges .
the prosecu@@ tor had a life@@ time prison sentence .
the decision has had pain@@ ful mem@@ ories at june core .
with te@@ ars , the man in charge said that pa@@ te@@ k had been condemned to death .
i really think it should be included in the foot@@ steps of the other gu@@ ys .
&quot; he should be protected from a sho@@ oting command , &quot; he said .
i have to live with the fact that i do not have to get any more grand@@ children and i never see my dau@@ gh@@ ters any more .
the sar@@ i club was built on the ground when the first club was founded on 12 october 2002 , shortly after 23 : 00 , in a small b@@ last , which was opened before the night club .
peter hu@@ gh@@ es was in pad@@ dy &apos;s bar , where only 20 seconds earlier a self-@@ mor@@ tal attack was carried out .
he fell after the attack , a month after the attack , and “ died . ” three times , while he was dying of a life re@@ aring system .
hu@@ gh@@ es said pa@@ te@@ k did the same fate as the three other members of the terrorist cell y@@ em@@ a@@ ah islam@@ i@@ ah – am@@ ro@@ z@@ i , mu@@ k@@ hu@@ gh@@ las , and i@@ ma@@ m sam@@ u@@ dr@@ a – who were in for the victims .
really , this type should be above all else the death penalty .
to keep him alive – no , there is no reason to leave him alive .
20 years to get after he had 20@@ 2 people killed and many hundreds killed .
pa@@ te@@ k is the last of the bal@@ i bom@@ ber who was in court .
he was almost a decade away from for@@ ging , but was eventually released in january 2011 in the pa@@ ki@@ stan@@ i city of ab@@ bot@@ tab@@ ad , where us forces were deplo@@ yed almost four months later to replace former al-@@ q@@ a@@ ed@@ a chief os@@ ama os@@ ama .
during the negotiation , a f@@ bi agent said that he would not be able to read the report that he had been in the process of being arrested in pakistan to be b@@ in la@@ den with the aim of establishing the link between south east asian terrorist groups .
“ he has not been asked , ” said cor@@ teen .
until recently , he has not received any rep@@ ent@@ ance as to how much suffering he has inf@@ lic@@ ted on other people .
the judgment was passed before the ten@@ -@@ year anniversary of the attack in london this year , which was accompanied by comm@@ em@@ or@@ ative cere@@ mon@@ ies in bal@@ i and australia .
“ it will be a lot of te@@ ars this year , ” said cor@@ teen .
pa@@ te@@ k can protest against his judgment even more appe@@ als .
fa@@ a : passengers can now use electronic devices in aircraft ( but no mobile phones are in use ) .
passengers can now benefit from the departure of their flight to the lan@@ ding and read , work , play , listen to music and watch films .
but passengers should not expect to be able to make these changes immediately .
how quickly it would be implemented is dependent on the respective airline .
the airlines must be able to prove to the fa@@ a that aircraft comply with the new directives and that they are using the training manu@@ als of the air crew and the rules for stor@@ ing the equipment in accordance with the new regulations .
the fa@@ a explained that it has already been asked by some airlines to make plans to allow the use of port@@ able electronic equipment in aircraft .
among these airlines , del@@ ta and je@@ tw@@ ro@@ e were also .
“ depending on the state of the plan , we could facilitate the increased use of electronic devices very soon , ” said the fa@@ a in a statement by the european parliament .
at present , passengers need to use smar@@ t@@ phones , tab@@ lets and other devices when the aircraft is not closed .
you may not re@@ start them until the aircraft has reached a height of three kilometres .
when entering the lan@@ ding , the airlines must inform them of the flight and not leave them .
under the new directives , airlines whose aircraft are subject to electronic inter@@ ference could be able to offer passengers the possibility of using the equipment at launch , lan@@ ding and on the whe@@ el@@ ed .
most new transport aircraft and other aircraft are already in service for the use of wi-fi .
la@@ ura gla@@ ding , president of the professional association of professional flight att@@ end@@ ants , welcomed the changes .
&quot; when the new regulation is implemented safe@@ ly – and we are working closely with the airline in this respect – both sides will benefit from it , &quot; comm@@ ented gla@@ ding .
we are frank@@ ly ti@@ red of being divided on this issue as if it were more atten@@ tive .
however , internet connections to sur@@ f , exchange data and to share text messages or downloading files were not allowed under three kilometres .
passengers are requested to use smar@@ t@@ phones , tab@@ lets and other devices in the airline mode .
so still no “ words with fresh ideas ” .
and he@@ avi@@ er devices such as lap@@ top@@ s must continue to be du@@ sty , as there is a risk of in@@ jury if they are driven by the cab@@ in .
mobile calls during the flight remain un@@ changed .
the regulatory competence for telephone calls is the federal reserve ’ s responsibility .
fa@@ a may lift a ban on certain electronic devices at launch and lan@@ ding on the basis of the data provided for the flight .
last month mark ro@@ sen@@ ker said of the road safety authority national transportation safety authority that the european union should be responsible for national traffic safety experts .
“ mobile phones are really a problem , not only because they are potentially dis@@ rup@@ tive to navigation devices , but because we are dependent on the f@@ cc to know that the transmission from the air is also trans@@ mit@@ ter ma@@ sts ” , says .
a consul@@ tative committee of the industry , which is led by the fa@@ a to study this issue , will be recomm@@ ending that the commission should present a report on the matter more widely .
in recent years , the pressure on the facts has increased , restrictions on the free use of fa@@ a have been lif@@ ted .
cri@@ tics , such as the democratic sen@@ ator cla@@ ire mc@@ cas@@ k@@ ill of mis@@ sour@@ i , believe that it is not possible to have a valid security basis for the ban .
the restrictions are also increasingly heavy , and the fact that the use of the equipment has become u@@ bi@@ qu@@ it@@ ous .
some studies have shown that the problem of the death of up to one third of passengers is the problem of swit@@ ching off the equipment .
the fa@@ a began in 196@@ 6 to promote the use of electronic equipment by air passengers .
new aircraft are much more dependent on electric systems than previous ones .
airlines offer passengers a wide range of services for wi-fi , air conditioning and heating .
the software supplied to wi-fi systems is compatible with the standard windows .
the vast majority of passengers are from the eu member states and should be responsible for the greater use of electronic equipment under the new directives , said hu@@ er@@ ta .
today &apos;s electronic devices generally give much less radi@@ ance than the previous ones .
e-@@ reader , for example , only give minimal radiation when you are able to sc@@ roll over .
however , when downloading or sending data , the transfer values are stronger .
among the def@@ enders of eas@@ ing the restrictions on the freedom of use of equipment by passengers is am@@ a@@ z@@ on@@ .@@ com@@ .
in 2011 , company employees invited a passenger plane full of kin@@ dle e-@@ reader and made a test flight to solve problems .
members of the fa@@ a advisory committee are expressing their concern about the situation in the middle east .
dou@@ gl@@ as kid@@ d of the national association of passengers &apos; rights ( n@@ c@@ p ) said that he was of the opinion that the dis@@ ru@@ ption of the equipment was genuine , even if the risk was minimal .
other committees have been saying that there are no more than a few reports from pi@@ vo@@ t , who are responsible for dis@@ rup@@ ting aircraft systems by the equipment .
the committee recomm@@ ends that the fa@@ a should not allow pi@@ rates to fly , however , for instr@@ um@@ ental lan@@ ding under poor vi@@ sibility .
a group of the travel industry welcomed the changes and the name of the group as a reasonable accommodation for travellers who are now travelling exten@@ sively with technology .
“ we are pleased that the fa@@ a recogn@@ ises that a pleasant passenger ship experience is not in@@ compatible with safety ” , said ro@@ ger do@@ w , ceo of the u.s.
by air tre@@ adm@@ ill from north sea port bo@@ re@@ lands ger@@ re@@ t@@ te@@ ter vo@@ gel fre@@ ed again .
a light , airy , comfortable bed and a comfortable bathroom are at your disposal .
the water r@@ alls were closed last month with a helicop@@ ter after ab@@ er@@ de@@ en .
col@@ in se@@ d@@ don , head of the centre , said : “ this water r@@ all was probably a winter mi@@ gr@@ atory bird from northern europe that was bur@@ ied in the sea by the strong win@@ ds .
it seems that the er@@ ra@@ tic vo@@ gel was seeking refu@@ ge on the dr@@ ill island .
he added : “ he could not do more flying , so we had to start asking for help .
when they were released , the water r@@ alls were fit and healthy again .
is europe ’ s elite prepared to do business with britain ?
business for britain was founded in april with the intention of improving the economy to a table .
to this end , we have developed the largest and most comprehensive survey among british economic leaders .
you@@ go@@ v inter@@ viewed about 1.@@ 000 leaders in the industry and asked them about the number of british companies in the company , sectors and regions .
the results of the survey will surprise many .
we have found that the overwhel@@ ming majority of the companies now operate outside europe .
you want us to have a clear and transparent link between government and countries like china , india and brazil .
in their view on certain legally regulated regulations , the council of ministers , the commission and the council have been very successful in the field of the environment .
there was general dis@@ satisfaction about the internal market , as the commission says that companies are paying the cost of the brussels rules .
finally , and this is probably the most important thing , our survey of economic leaders showed that the economic situation in the region is characterised by a clear majority .
this re@@ alization , which has been reflected in companies of all sizes and leading companies , shows that the economy is heading for a “ meaning@@ ful change , ” which will be the re@@ mit of action to britain .
it is a lot – a change in the agreement and better conditions for britain would be at 16 % to change opinion in favour of the eu remaining in a referendum .
the prime minister should have no doubt that this survey shows that the british economy is behind its plan for re@@ negotiation of british conditions for eu membership .
it also shows that companies are being hit by a re@@ negotiation .
a better deal for the british economy is possible and in increasing need of it , after the eurozone has now moved towards a closer union with the economy and the fiscal union .
the priority must be jobs and growth in britain , as is the result of our survey , which is a major focus for companies on trade and a fundamental shift in the brussels budget .
alex@@ e@@ i mill@@ er of ga@@ z@@ pro@@ m is a pipel@@ ine in bulgaria that marks the beginning of a new gas era in the country .
the construction of the sou@@ th-@@ stream pipel@@ ine is scheduled to start in bulgaria .
“ today ’ s event is a mil@@ est@@ one : construction work on the bulg@@ arian section of the south stream gas pipel@@ ine has been completed , the biggest and most important project in europe , ” said the previous president of the board of directors of gas pipel@@ ine .
the project is a key element in energy security for the entire european continent .
south stream is to be used to bring about greater diversity in russia &apos;s export routes through europe .
a contract dispute between ga@@ z@@ pro@@ m and its counter@@ parts in the ukraine , in which the majority of russia &apos;s gas is dest@@ ined for europe , is a matter of concern for increased risk of conventional gas emissions .
mill@@ er said that the direct link to bulgaria , a member of the european union , means that the problems associated with transit countries will be resolved .
bulg@@ arian consumers receive gas from south stream to distribute at reduced tari@@ ffs , if the entire project is completed in 20@@ 15 .
according to ga@@ z@@ pro@@ m , construction works are to be carried out in other secondary countries on the planned route at the end of the year .
the pipel@@ ine is designed to cover an annual capacity of 6@@ 2.@@ 3 billion cu@@ b@@ ic metres of natural gas .
for national and international investors , no way is past germany ’ s real estate site .
the economic framework data are correct , and the funding opportunities are excellent .
this is the thr@@ ust of the 9@@ th real estate day of the exchange newspaper .
german real estate markets benefit from the economic strength and the investments made in the european comparison .
this is what christian ul@@ br@@ ich , ceo of europe , has called for in the middle east and africa by j@@ ones lan@@ g las@@ al@@ le , on the 9@@ th real estate day of the exchange newspaper .
as requested by german commercial real estate , the german property market is looking at the transaction volume , so ul@@ bri@@ ch .
in the first three quarters of this year , it showed a sur@@ plus of 2.@@ 3 % compared to the previous year .
in britain , plus was only 6 % , in france it was 19 % .
&quot; real estate investments offer an attractive consumption opportunity for the future , &quot; said ul@@ br@@ ich .
the yi@@ eld gap between real estate and bun@@ des@@ bonds is at a histor@@ ically high level .
the fa@@ a has eas@@ ed restrictions on the use of electronic equipment in aircraft – even if the number of calls is limited by the mobile phone .
combat aircraft are a major weapon in the battle against russian missi@@ les .
this is obviously a continuation of the israeli campaign , which is aimed at preventing the spread of weapons in the middle east .

hearing before the royal commission : two y@@ m@@ ca members of staff before acc@@ us@@ ations against jon@@ a@@ than lor@@ d for sexual abuse .
two y@@ m@@ ca employees from new south wal@@ es ( n@@ s@@ w ) are due to be arrested for sexual off@@ ences related to children .
but at the opening declaration before the commission , the y@@ m@@ ca stated that it had “ been able to do with a pre@@ cur@@ sor of sexual abuse ” in the organisation .
managing director phil@@ li@@ p h@@ are was informed about a case in which a y@@ m@@ ca team member was charged with off@@ ences involving child por@@ no@@ graphy .
h@@ are said ga@@ il fur@@ ness , one of the commission assi@@ sting lawyers , that he was informed of the first case .
he acknowledged that the opening cere@@ mony was a very important step towards the commission .
evidence before the commission shows that the council of ministers has been informed that the situation in y@@ m@@ ca is the second lowest of four possible cases in a quality audit of the department of justice .
h@@ are , who was born at the y@@ m@@ ca with 21 , ad@@ mitted that the management had “ of me ” ab@@ war@@ ts .
lord was a member of the united states army at the beginning of the year for sexual off@@ ences against 12 bo@@ ys during his two-@@ year term .
he was sent@@ enced to at least six years in prison .
h@@ are st@@ aged , however , that the y@@ m@@ ca was a cultural problem that employees were prevented from using the l@@ ord@@ s. he was not able to investigate or prosecu@@ te lor@@ ds for violations of children &apos;s safety .
the staff said they had committed violations , but they were not aware of lor@@ d alone .
dani@@ elle o@@ ck@@ well , whose chief executive lord of the r@@ ings was asked to attend a training session on child protection , because she was unable to attend because of his behaviour , said that the child services were not available in jac@@ qu@@ i .
the managing director said that he would not accept statements from employees that they would not d@@ are to be able to meet their superi@@ ors .
instead , he said , he has shown their friend@@ ship with lord their judgment .
h@@ are explained that he had given the board of the y@@ m@@ ca n@@ s@@ w his view that the le@@ x@@ icon that the organization had learned from the “ jon@@ a@@ than l@@ ord@@ -@@ interim ” incident was too weak .
h@@ are said that the decision to make employees sign contracts is a decision that was made shortly after the acc@@ us@@ ations were made , was taken by the child services director of the y@@ m@@ ca , li@@ am wh@@ it@@ ley .
he said that this should prevent contam@@ ination of the evidence .
the y@@ m@@ ca n@@ s@@ w is a very popular and popular destination during the time jon@@ a@@ than lord was there between 2009 and 2011 .
he explained that the problem is “ serious ” .
the hearing was held until 20 december and was scheduled for the first time .
ton@@ y bla@@ ir said that he would lose the chance of a return as british prime minister – but ad@@ mits that a co@@ co@@ ach is unlikely .
in an interview ton@@ ight on the occasion of the fifth anniversary of his reti@@ rement from the post , he announced that the 5@@ 9-@@ year-@@ old had expressed his views on various domestic issues .
since his re@@ sign@@ ation in june 2007 , after a decade of leadership , bla@@ ir has largely avoided the need to break up into british politics , and his comments mostly reflect the views of foreign policy and his role as en@@ vo@@ y of the quar@@ tet .
in response to the question of whether he would like to be elected prime minister , the first question was raised by the ev@@ ing standard in london , which said : ‘ yes , yes , yes , but it is unlikely that the situation will happen ’ .

a chinese newspaper , which is on the front page calling for the release of a re@@ porter who was sent@@ enced to death for de@@ fam@@ ation , has been sent@@ enced to 18 months in prison .
the gu@@ ang@@ z@@ ho@@ u an@@ gel , based in gu@@ ang@@ z@@ ho@@ u , had a rare public call for the journ@@ alist chen y@@ ong@@ z@@ ho@@ u to be released .
but chen later announced on television that he would use bri@@ bes to kill his brother .
now the new express of a “ comprehensive rec@@ ti@@ fication ” is being subjec@@ ted , the regul@@ ator declared .
the “ rec@@ ti@@ fication order ” is a concept developed by the press and publishing authority , radio , film and television in gu@@ ang@@ d@@ ong , germany .
preliminary re@@ mit@@ tan@@ ces showed that the market was not able to cope with the new express , which was added to the y@@ ang@@ chen@@ g even@@ ing news group , between september 2012 and august 2013 .
“ the ed@@ it@@ orial management of the new express was dis@@ organised , ” the regul@@ ator gave a statement that .

drug tunnel with its own railway between the usa and mexico disco@@ vers the most dangerous and dangerous con@@ jun@@ c@@ tions of the world between the us and mexico .
one of the most sophisticated tun@@ nels for the drug s@@ mu@@ gg@@ ling between the us and mexico , which is completely equipped with lighting , v@@ enti@@ lation and electric railway .
the us authorities described the 120 times 90 cen@@ time@@ ters measuring tunnel as a way of measuring the most sophisticated pass@@ ages ever made .
the tunnel , which was built in the z@@ ick@@ z@@ ack pattern for a length of just under six football fields , connec@@ ts ware@@ houses near the ti@@ ju@@ ana , mexico , and san di@@ e@@ go , usa .
in the area there are countless un@@ imag@@ in@@ able ware@@ houses , which makes it easier to deal with drugs contam@@ inated tr@@ uc@@ ks .
the tunnel is closed , before drugs are un@@ detec@@ ted in it .
the discovery of the tunnel was a matter of eight and a half tonnes of mari@@ ju@@ ana and 14@@ 8 kil@@ o@@ gram@@ s of co@@ ca@@ ine , according to the records of the court .
three men , who , according to the authorities , worked as drivers , were sent@@ enced to death for the ownership and intended sale of mari@@ ju@@ ana and co@@ ca@@ ine .
they are threatened with a guil@@ ty sentence .
in no@@ gal@@ es , ari@@ z@@ ona , s@@ mu@@ gg@@ lers are putting their faith in an extensive underground network of de@@ wat@@ ering plants .
the tunnel is the eigh@@ th large pass@@ age that has been in san di@@ e@@ go since 2006 .
some of the largest tun@@ nels were built after the mari@@ hu@@ ana har@@ v@@ est in central mexico in october , which made drug car@@ te@@ ls challenging the task of making their product safe .
in 2010 , authorities took a total of 6@@ 40 metres long pass@@ age with rail@@ s , which were carried by a kitchen in a residential house in ti@@ ju@@ ana to two ware@@ houses in san di@@ e@@ go .

&quot; we will be supporting each other and love to be parents of fl@@ y@@ n@@ n &quot; .
ker@@ r and blo@@ om have been married since 2010 , but in 2011 , their s@@ ons and dau@@ gh@@ ters fl@@ y@@ n@@ n were born .
ve@@ gan@@ ism is , according to le@@ xi@@ ka , the vege@@ tari@@ an@@ ism is sub@@ ordin@@ ated , but diff@@ ers from this in a very significant way .
for while vege@@ tari@@ ans are aware of the consumption of cre@@ am ca@@ kes , e@@ gg@@ s or a powerful e@@ da@@ -@@ mer , they are not at the centre of the menu .
milk , cheese , eg@@ g , in addition to the ren@@ un@@ ci@@ ation of meat and fish , ve@@ gan leaves the ve@@ gan from all animal products - even hon@@ ey .
what remains , you may wonder , but on closer inspection , the picture is different .
&quot; bread roll@@ s are very popular , &quot; says the ute hen@@ kel@@ mann , who is the owner of the local bread reform house , who has a wide range of special products for ve@@ gan .
re@@ u@@ ben proc@@ tor also visits the store in the dom@@ gas@@ se .
for 13 years , the native neu@@ ze@@ al@@ and@@ er ve@@ gan , living in lam@@ pe@@ re@@ the@@ im ( almost ) , has found everything he could need to live &quot; in 1997 i put my di@@ et and became vege@@ tari@@ ans &quot; .
at the turn of the century , the next step was taken and i became ve@@ gan .
&quot; the convic@@ tion came not only because of nutri@@ tion , but because of the sho@@ e choice , &quot; proc@@ tor says the art leather normal leather .
he realized that there were also other everyday problems , such as animal diseases , which are not included in the scope of the directive .
first and foremost , ve@@ gan is an eth@@ ics .
&quot; i do not want animals to die for me , &quot; says proc@@ tor the ma@@ xi@@ m of ve@@ g@@ ans who are based on the entire consumer behavior .
instead of bur@@ gers , sti@@ r@@ ring e@@ gg@@ s or rubber bears , we are now in the ve@@ gan state of being able to find all new products that increase enthusiasm .
&quot; it is a double bonus &quot; , says proc@@ tor today , &quot; actually , ve@@ gan does not ren@@ oun@@ ce , no as@@ ce@@ tic , but it is an en@@ rich@@ ment &quot; .
and it is precisely these conditions that have allowed some to be more well-@@ inten@@ tioned .
&quot; the ad@@ diction factor is a very important factor that many quickly give up , similar to the smo@@ ke &quot; , explains prof@@ tor .
and applies : &quot; certain tas@@ tes are not at the animal st@@ amp &quot; .
often it is the sp@@ ices or the type of preparation that make up the taste .
&quot; but you can also use other means the same effect , &quot; explains the difference between ve@@ gan and ve@@ gan .
a bar@@ bec@@ ue festival is held by proc@@ tor , for example , au@@ ber@@ gin@@ s , mus@@ h@@ rooms and a few ve@@ gan sa@@ us@@ ages .
he is looking at a balanced , varied di@@ et , with a focus on the quality of life .
of course , there is a desire to have something between the te@@ eth , that is legitimate .
&quot; it should taste , but the thing is not only on animal nutri@@ tion .
health damage up to eating dis@@ orders , further widespread mal@@ nutri@@ tion , has been un@@ successful .
for me , the change@@ over has had a positive aspect .
i do not take any foreign cho@@ le@@ ster@@ ol and have an increased vi@@ ag@@ ra content .
there are high-@@ performance a@@ xes for the use of only vege@@ table prote@@ ins .
&quot; my blood values are excellent , i let me often check . &quot; i am not sure if proc@@ tor is the right person .
in particular , the lack of vit@@ am@@ in b@@ 12 war@@ ns many ve@@ gan@@ si@@ m cri@@ tics .
&quot; because animals are fed with feed , we must not allow them to be fed on the pa@@ st@@ ure , &quot; he said .
ve@@ gan b@@ red meat is also available in the co@@ en@@ zy@@ me .
&quot; my b@@ 12 values are fine &quot; , explains the author .
wide paths must be made for proc@@ tor to provide food .
basic foods are not available everywhere , and every super@@ market has so@@ ya milk and other products .
everything i need is a good idea , but i can &apos;t help it .
only occa@@ sion@@ ally i buy something special .
&quot; many people over@@ look the fact that only the finished products are expensive , but so is the situation with &quot; ordinary products &quot; .
in any case , the preparation of ve@@ gan dishes is far more favourable and less time@@ -@@ consum@@ ing , than is generally assumed .
&quot; in the kitchen there is much to discover with a few small cold dishes .
mar@@ gar@@ ine instead of but@@ ter , a little more ba@@ king pow@@ der and car@@ b@@ onic instead of e@@ gg@@ s , with its ve@@ gan cheese ca@@ ke proc@@ tor could also ast@@ on@@ ish his parents .
family celebra@@ tions give ve@@ gan a new flav@@ our .
this has dynam@@ ism if we co@@ ok together , it has a new significance .
&quot; the situations that arise are not the same as those that people themselves &quot; , says pro@@ c@@ tor .
of course , he was already s@@ cep@@ tical .
taste the delicious food i have ea@@ ten .
&quot; should i now feel bad because i am milk ?
&quot; i reject the people not , but i am part of this society , &quot; proc@@ tor does not want to be a enc@@ la@@ ve within the dead@@ lines .
and , more specifically , the everyday world does not appear as ve@@ gan as it is susp@@ ected - and ve@@ gan does not appear as much in everyday life as in general .
almost food is also allowed .
pom@@ mes is available everywhere !
&quot; many d@@ ö@@ ner shops offer fal@@ a@@ fe@@ l , or just a vege@@ t@@ arian yu@@ f@@ ka &quot; , says pro@@ c@@ tor .
in a piz@@ zer@@ ia , he is swit@@ ching to pa@@ sta dishes , or just ordered a piz@@ za without cheese , everything a question of hab@@ its .
the restaurants are so slow to adjust to it .
&quot; when i was arrested 13 years ago , i was ve@@ gan .
&quot; if there are enough en@@ qui@@ ries , you may be inc@@ lined to ask the menu . &quot;
ve@@ gan@@ e restaurants are developing , such as the com@@ b@@ ines in man@@ n@@ heim or the café vo@@ gel@@ fre@@ i .
proc@@ tor has the desire to be able to offer at least a ve@@ gan dish on the menu .
basically , vege@@ tari@@ ans are prepared for all .
everyone can eat them , so they are exactly the opposite of exclusive .
&quot; meat dishes are exclusive , on the other hand , in the true sense of the word , because they exclu@@ de others &quot; , states proc@@ tor .
&quot; if food scand@@ als are to be avoided , ve@@ gan ism is a safe way to help the most part of the world from the outset .
purchasing ve@@ gan@@ er products can be used at the beginning , however .
especially when you learn to understand the fact that it is also used in pe@@ an@@ u@@ ts as a color gener@@ ator , you seem to be satisfied with following the eth@@ ics of so many hur@@ d@@ les and tr@@ aps fast of courage .
not only for this reason , re@@ u@@ ben proc@@ tor and lars th@@ om@@ sen wrote a book : &quot; ve@@ gan@@ is@@ sim@@ o - animal ingredients and their alternatives &quot; explains the many ingredients of this book .
&quot; gradually , we develop a scan@@ ner view and know where the sign@@ atures and lo@@ gos are to be observed &quot; it is sometimes better to take small steps than to stand by or to stand by .
ve@@ gan@@ ism , it is an important moral fing@@ er , it is a human right that is kno@@ cking on the consci@@ ousness .
perhaps he is not quite able to make his hab@@ its known , but at least he can convince the consumer that he is using his hab@@ its cri@@ tically .
the stock exchange operator nas@@ da@@ q om@@ x holds its customers in a@@ eri@@ al .
trade in the nas@@ da@@ q options market is now closed on friday afternoon of german time .
in a communication the operator made technical problems responsible .
the other 11 us options markets , including the two most na@@ zi party , om@@ x , continued their business un@@ impe@@ ded .
the recent incident calls for a whole series of smaller and larger break@@ down@@ s in the stock market operator .
only on tuesday the indian authorities were able to determine the in@@ d@@ ices of nas@@ da@@ q for errors in data transport for an hour .
in august of this year , in a week alone , there were two break@@ down@@ s .
first , the us investment bank gol@@ d@@ man s@@ ach@@ s had suffered massive technical problems in purchasing orders that were def@@ ec@@ tive on a massive scale .
the commission then needed to take a nearly one-@@ year break , and the or@@ ders had to wait for the order to be sc@@ ra@@ pped .
two days later , half of the total share trading in the us came to an end because of a computer cr@@ ash on the nas@@ da@@ q stock exchange for several hours .
for the first time , the european stock exchange was closed for the first time last year .
nas@@ da@@ q &apos;s systems were the most powerful of the con@@ sole and the bul@@ k of sales and purchase orders , but later the stock market orders were the subject of se@@ c supervision and the company became a major source of income .
kon@@ stan@@ z : cy@@ cli@@ sts drive 6@@ 3-@@ year-@@ old at around 10 : 00 pm .
the accident was one of the worst in the world , according to the police , when a 26 year-@@ old man died on thursday evening , around 10 p.m. , on a women &apos;s bicycle .
when a 6@@ 3-@@ year-@@ old man suddenly came from a local to his way , he could not find a bicycle driver , according to the police , in time .
the following col@@ li@@ sion marked the pede@@ strian against the house wall .
a rescue cou@@ ri@@ er team brought the dev@@ a@@ station to the medical care facility .
british police are putting ass@@ ange on ex@@ tradition and are making a statement on ex@@ tradition to the united kingdom .
the british police have now issued a statement on ex@@ tradition to wi@@ kil@@ ea@@ ks founder ju@@ lian ass@@ ange .
scotland yard has explained that it has been given the 4@@ 0-@@ year-@@ old austr@@ ali@@ an a “ call to face up ” to help the country to appear in a police squ@@ ad .
ass@@ ange is threat@@ ening to ex@@ tradition to sweden for the charges in a sexual abuse case .
as he fears that stockholm will become a part of the us , he had to leave the country on 19 june in ecu@@ ad@@ ori@@ an emb@@ ass@@ y in london .
scotland yard has a “ one 4@@ 0-@@ year-@@ old man a call to the government to take up a job we chose at a police squ@@ ad . ”
it continues to viol@@ ate the conditions of his release on ba@@ il .
the message did not comment on the delivery of police inv@@ it@@ ations .
ass@@ ange fears that he will be taken to the united states by sweden and will be sent@@ enced there for possible sp@@ ying charges .

tax on foreign real estate owners against london ’ s spec@@ u@@ lative bu@@ b@@ ble
the treas@@ ury has provided temporary funding for c@@ g@@ t , and the federal government is waiting for the commission to conclude the decision .
already , the revenue from the ste@@ m@@ ming tax on housing is already exce@@ eding the western min@@ ster and ken@@ sing@@ ton &amp; ch@@ el@@ sea districts , which are already in fiscal year 2012 / 13 at 7@@ 08 million p@@ ounds .
co@@ ok said : “ after the increases in the st@@ amp tax on high-@@ price initiatives , the us government has decided to increase its tax on high-@@ price housing .
“ but this step could lead some foreign investors to be more cau@@ tious in buying real estate in london , or owners of property could stop selling . ” he added .
first class properties – the top five to ten percent of the housing market at price – are in the weal@@ thy london south west end g@@ love , which is surrounded by full ham to wi@@ m@@ ble@@ don .
prices in central london were equal to the annual average growth of 5.@@ 3 % .
scientists could have given more light to the context in which the co@@ ag@@ ulation of a dog is related to its mo@@ od .
previous research has shown that the gam@@ bling of dogs with the tail is more like a dog .
but now scientists say that other dogs do not understand these sub@@ tle differences and are respon@@ ding to them .
professor geor@@ gio v@@ all@@ ora is a professor of the new york university neu@@ ros@@ ci@@ enti@@ gar@@ a , said : “ human beings are well aware that the left and right are bra@@ ins .
here we have tried to take this into account with other species .
he also noted that the h@@ ounds were just as much in the way they were in humans as the right brain half for the lef@@ t-@@ hand movement and vice vers@@ a , and that the two h@@ emis@@ ph@@ ere roles played different roles in the feel@@ ings .
to learn more about how h@@ ats are placed on the side of the tail of their species , please visit the website of the animal welfare organization .
they measure heart rate of the four-@@ leg@@ ged and analy@@ zed the behavior .
we will probably soon understand why the vo@@ gue is in the one , sometimes in the other .
professor v@@ all@@ or@@ ti@@ gar@@ a said : “ we have the dogs movies with dogs , but we have either a natural or a very good quality .
if the animals saw how a otherwise out@@ dated model of dog would have been able to turn the tail to the right ( from the perspective of the we@@ av@@ ing dog ) , they would remain completely relaxed .
but was the co@@ ck tend@@ ency mainly after the left ( again from the perspective of the dog , the we@@ dge ) , so the tail of your heart and you sat on un@@ cal@@ le@@ dly .
in the opinion of professor v@@ all@@ or@@ ti@@ gar@@ a , the dogs do not deliber@@ ately communicate with each other through these movements .
it is more convinced that the dogs are born of experience and that they have been able to worry about what they are going to do and when they should not .
he said : ‘ if you have different meetings with other dogs and you have to w@@ ash your co@@ ck with one another in one direction , you have to be kind and the right side is a less friendly behaviour , then you are re@@ acting on the basis . ’ .
researchers say that the number of findings is un@@ de@@ res@@ ti@@ mated by dog owners , veter@@ in@@ arians and tra@@ in@@ ers to better understand the emo@@ tions of their animal .
john br@@ ad@@ sha@@ w , expert in dog bre@@ eding and ga@@ thering , is a member of the fac@@ ul@@ ty of animal health at the university of bri@@ st@@ ol , explained that this is not the first study in which the study was studied whether or not .
last year , a team of the university of l@@ inc@@ ol@@ n found that dogs had their head turned left , when they had an aggres@@ sive dog .
in another research on the university of vi@@ tic@@ tori@@ a in canada , the following stated : “ dogs are more likely to be on a robo@@ t dog if his , tail , is we@@ del@@ t and not on the right , rather than become re@@ st@@ less .
according to his statement , the differences could therefore arise that dogs are not allowed to use animals in the film in the various studies or the robo@@ t dogs as dogs .
a study , such as dogs on real dogs , could help to explain why .
“ although there are considerable evidence of many different m@@ am@@ m@@ als that the two had been bra@@ in@@ stor@@ ms for various purposes , they are still necessary to understand many of the details – and dogs are there no exception . ”
as their behaviour is simply recorded , however , i will probably not be able to wait for us to understand why the pregn@@ ancy sometimes turns into a one , sometimes into the other .

po@@ pe fran@@ z@@ is@@ k@@ us ap@@ points the first kar@@ din@@ a@@ e@@ le in february .
po@@ pe fran@@ z@@ is@@ k@@ us will be visiting new kar@@ din@@ a@@ e@@ le of the catho@@ lic church for the first time on 22 february , as the v@@ ati@@ can announced on thursday .
car@@ din@@ als are the most senior cl@@ er@@ ics in the catal@@ an society .
there are currently 20@@ 1 car@@ din@@ als .
however , a car@@ din@@ al who has an age of 80 years can not be ad@@ mitted to the po@@ pe &apos;s election – that is a matter for a group of 120 “ eligible car@@ din@@ als ” .
in a statement that states that the commission has not yet published the information , father feder@@ ico l@@ om@@ bar@@ di , a spo@@ kes@@ man for the v@@ ati@@ can , said that there will be a meeting of all car@@ din@@ als before the cere@@ mony is held .
“ po@@ pe fran@@ z@@ is@@ k@@ us has decided to re@@ consider his decision to conven@@ e the consistency story in february .
j@@ ack val@@ ero of ca@@ th@@ ol@@ ic vo@@ ices said that the number of electoral candidates is rising .
he explained that a po@@ pe was appointed to the greatest extent that car@@ din@@ als were necessary to ensure that the number of voters was not increased .
the consistency story in the next year is important because it is important to have the first since the election of francis@@ c@@ us in march this year to have been so val@@ ero .
at present there is a certain over@@ han@@ g on the part of europe and , in particular , italy .
“ it will be interesting to see if the new po@@ pe kar@@ din@@ a@@ e@@ le from the rest of the world will ap@@ point to restore the balance , ” said him .
for@@ ty per cent of ca@@ th@@ ol@@ ics live in south america , but they have only a tiny number of car@@ din@@ als .
the car@@ din@@ als are also the first to be used since the formation of the church of st. franc@@ is , founded by the car@@ din@@ al council .
in the past , the po@@ pe decided everything alone .
“ now franc@@ is has won these eight car@@ din@@ als , which are now helping him , ” he said .
he explained that it is “ possible ” that fran@@ z@@ is@@ k@@ us would not have to replace the car@@ din@@ als .
but so far we have not been able to do so – that is all very new .
val@@ ero said that typically , the most bi@@ b@@ lic@@ al bis@@ ho@@ ps from large places to call car@@ din@@ als , but put franc@@ is to &quot; full of surpris@@ es – we know not what to call him .

desper@@ ation for a obama administration
i have twice asked president obama to do so in the hope that change is possible .
he says obama has pra@@ is@@ e@@ worthy efforts to improve the quality of the work done by the republic@@ ans ’ bloc@@ k@@ ade tac@@ tics .
the policy of bloc@@ k@@ ade does not apo@@ logi@@ ze for ob@@ am@@ ac@@ are &apos;s web site problems , the dr@@ one attacks and the in@@ ti@@ mi@@ dation of the dr@@ one attacks in the west .
obama ’ s mem@@ o@@ irs of the 2008 election campaign are a sad remin@@ der of what happened .
na@@ than@@ i@@ el p. mor@@ r@@ is is a student in the second year at har@@ v@@ ard medical university in new york .
i am currently reading a d@@ read@@ fully sad book .
it is a book that i have believed to be worth reading .
it is called the aud@@ acity to win .
when i talk to my patients in the evening , and when i go to bed , i get the book back to a time when the politics was inspired by millions and listened to a speech .
the election was a lands@@ li@@ de victory and news fe@@ at .
my class@@ mates we@@ ren &apos;t happy and my parents collected them all time .
a young team of vi@@ sion@@ aries was on the way to the white house and the nation was ready for change .
when , in 2008 , obama took office , he agreed to the value of 82 % .
and then i close the book .
re@@ location to the present is a bad thing .
it is difficult to remember these optim@@ istic times .
in the years since i first voted , i have been very concerned about the situation .
but it is simply nothing i would have imag@@ ined .
i recognise the great and versa@@ tile things that have been done by obama , from the adoption of the aff@@ or@@ da agreement to the implementation of the health insurance package to the military withdrawal from the country , the end of the ar@@ re@@ sts .
i agree that the european union &apos;s party political bloc@@ k@@ ade is too many to be desired .
but , having heard the obama administration many times in relation to colleagues and acqu@@ a@@ int@@ ances , i am not satisfied with my attempts to explain .
i have one point of political des@@ pair .
the republic@@ an bloc@@ k@@ ade policy cannot explain why it is not possible to prevent the inter@@ cep@@ tion of foreign leaders or to stop the killing of inno@@ cent children by means of dr@@ ones over@@ seas .
it cannot explain why the national security agency has not been able to collect data on the private lives of americans and why wh@@ ist@@ le@@ b@@ lower is being pun@@ ished , which has prevented government mis@@ conduct .
it cannot explain why an@@ war al-@@ a@@ wr@@ a ’ s , a us citizen , is not allowed to be mur@@ dered without trial , nor why public financing and spending programs are being cut during the presidential elections .
it does not justify the results of a report which states that the efforts of the white house to calm down the media are the ‘ aggres@@ sive ’ actions of the last few years since the ni@@ x@@ on government .
and , more recently , it cannot be the in@@ ability to find a solution in the more than three years since the adoption of the affir@@ d@@ able care act .
i do not know whether that is what i would have expected .
whether i was with 18 , i would have understood that the government &apos;s work is in line with the previous political campaigns .
obviously , the me@@ p is not a predic@@ table course , as an opposition party and party are ran@@ dom events like the new@@ town@@ -@@ mass@@ ac@@ re .
but when i look at the examples above , i think they seem to be widely supported by the government itself .
and that does not bo@@ ther me most .
i have again been elected obama in 2012 , not because i am concerned about his candi@@ d@@ acy .
mit@@ t ro@@ m@@ ney was a conf@@ using and un@@ balanced figure of alternative .
i had the impression that a second term for obama , free from pressure from future elections , would undermine the hope that the us will have been able to see for so long .
but with the fall in the approval values for obama on below 45 % of this week , the return to 2008 is marked by this book , all the more severe .
it is a source of an@@ xi@@ ety for the many promises that have been made .
this week i read a section in the book descri@@ bing how to make obama a severe loss against clin@@ ton in the talks ’ pre-@@ election .
in a meeting with the election workers following the decision , he told his staff that they had to return to course and that they would follow the purpose of their cause .
“ i want us to be able to re@@ discover our magic , ” he said .
we must remember that who we are .
there are five years later , mr. president of the commission , and i could not agree more with you .

cli@@ ve pal@@ mer claims that prime minister ton@@ y ab@@ bot@@ t has won paren@@ tal leave conflicts of interest .
the bil@@ li@@ on@@ air@@ e and m@@ r@@ s. cli@@ ve pal@@ mer say that prime minister ton@@ y ab@@ bot@@ t would be in conflict of interest in his plans for paren@@ tal leave , because his dau@@ gh@@ ters are pregn@@ ant and could therefore benefit .
the mining mag@@ n@@ at , which is located in a judicial dispute over the payment of 6 million dollars to co2 tax , is the most alleg@@ ed claim that the mining mag@@ n@@ at had been trying to wi@@ pe out questions about whether it had been resolved .
the pal@@ mer united party could be the largest party to have up to four votes in the sen@@ ate , which are important for deci@@ ding whether the co2 and mining taxes should be cut or cut .
but pal@@ mer claimed that only ministers of interest have conflicts of interest and that the dau@@ gh@@ ters of ab@@ bot@@ t were personally benef@@ iting from the laws .
“ he is in a great conflict of interests when it comes to paid paren@@ tal leave .
two months after the election , the pal@@ mer electoral commission declared with 53 votes ahead of the new election .
pal@@ mer called for a revision of the voting process to be carried out so that it could proceed more quickly .
ton@@ y ab@@ bot@@ t ’ s dau@@ gh@@ ters fran@@ ces and brid@@ get .
if these elections are held two months after the end of the vote ?
“ we need a better system , ” he said .
why should we not have a system where we can enter ?
pal@@ mer also cri@@ tici@@ zed the use of p@@ enc@@ ils when marking the bal@@ lot papers .
use it because you then have to compare the results .
today , with p@@ enc@@ ils , it is incredible .
the election commission has examined the options for an electronic election and recently adopted a common legislative proposal with new ze@@ al@@ and .
pal@@ mer , 59 , explained that to his policy a global airport for the sun@@ sh@@ ine co@@ a@@ sting , he was the only one to take over his new office .
in a public office , it is about the public service .
“ we do not seek re@@ ward except for those of history , which is that we live in a critical time of this community , ” he said .
r@@ bs sus@@ pen@@ ds two fore@@ x deal@@ ers and sel@@ ls two foreign exchange trad@@ ers .
the royal bank of scotland has two deal@@ ers from its foreign exchange department sus@@ pen@@ ds , so two people who are dealing with the situation ; this is a further indic@@ ator that the uk government is not responsible for the global regulatory investigation .
some of the world ’ s largest banks , including u@@ bs , bar@@ cla@@ ys , deutsche bank , and r@@ bs , have confirmed that they have been working with the authorities in the world ’ s largest financial market , where 5.@@ 3 tr@@ il@@ lion dollars a day is spent .
the two deal@@ ers would be the first r@@ bs staff to be employed in the expanding investigation .
the bank , which has not made any comment on the suspension , has confirmed that the bank has not yet signed any information requests from the authorities .
“ our investigations into this issue are continuing and we are co@@ operating fully with the f@@ ca and other regulatory authorities ” , said the bank recently .
last month , the situation of close people indicated that the r@@ bs had not read the record of e-@@ ma@@ ils and inst@@ ant messages sent by and to an earlier trad@@ er .
this deal@@ er , richard us@@ her , had the r@@ bs 2010 and is now to be released from its current position as european leader of fore@@ x spot trading at j@@ p@@ mor@@ gan .
ro@@ h@@ an ram@@ ch@@ and@@ ani , head of the european spot trading at cit@@ i , was arrested this week .
none of these trad@@ ers has been accused of any mis@@ conduct .
the inst@@ ant mess@@ aging group of us@@ her included ban@@ kers in bar@@ cla@@ ys and the ci@@ ti@@ group , they said to the situation close to the people .
u@@ bs announced this week that they have taken steps against some of their employees after the swiss regulatory authorities have found fin@@ ma to have been forced to take a susp@@ ected man@@ ip@@ ulation of the fore@@ x market in a number of swiss banks .
at least six worldwide authorities – the european commission , fin@@ ma , the swiss competition authority we@@ ko , the f@@ ca , the us ministry of justice , and hong kong monetary institute – have signed a contract with the swiss federal ministry of justice .
h@@ s@@ bc , ci@@ ti@@ group , j@@ p@@ mor@@ gan and cred@@ its su@@ is@@ se have also carried out internal investigations or have received information requests from authorities , said with the situation familiar people .
banks are in@@ stan@@ tane@@ ous messages and em@@ ail@@ s from several years on the search for cases of mis@@ conduct .
the news of these investigations has hit the trad@@ ers in one area of tur@@ mo@@ il that has been growing in recent years to be one of the most prof@@ itable of the trading units of investment banks , but this year among others .
some ban@@ kers have tried to ignore the aff@@ air and said that they are almost impossible to avoid the ex@@ or@@ bit@@ ant and highly vo@@ la@@ tile exchange of currency .
a leading trad@@ er noted that , despite the huge daily volume of foreign exchange trading , the frag@@ ment@@ ation of liqui@@ dity in the exchange markets has been largely un@@ sustainable .
the news came on the same day as cred@@ its suites , which announced that they had not received a trad@@ er of their london exchange tr@@ aded funds this week .
the bank informed promp@@ tly the competent authorities and works with them to develop a new approach .
“ we are sure that the deal@@ er is acting alone and that the matter will be contained ” , he explained .
the f@@ ence on the be@@ ch@@ t@@ le p@@ lot is pain@@ ted with a beautiful and beautiful wood .
a group of citizens &apos; initiative &quot; swiss me@@ ado@@ w &quot; has opened the f@@ ence on the bec@@ h@@ le p@@ lot at the kur@@ fü@@ r@@ st@@ end@@ am@@ m in bad her@@ ren@@ al@@ b .
in addition , the government pur@@ ged and wi@@ den@@ ed the foot@@ path , according to a press release .
the planned cover of the dec@@ om@@ mis@@ sion@@ ing house in the back part of the property was not available for security reasons , because the site threat@@ ens to sli@@ de .
al@@ f@@ red ab@@ el , who has currently managed the property , had the beauti@@ fication agenda of the village with his colleague rein@@ hard dom@@ ke of the bi .
before the action of the bi was a transparent with the message &quot; we are for it &quot; .
the situation was distur@@ bing for the 20 or so members of the citizens &apos; initiative .
your mo@@ tto on the big pos@@ ter was &quot; the best we are against bau@@ ru@@ ins &quot; .
in doing so , she wanted to respond to the risk of even larger ru@@ ins on the swiss me@@ ado@@ w - the giant project should one day fail .
in con@@ vers@@ ation with many pas@@ ser@@ s-@@ by before the &quot; construction site &quot; it became clear that some citizens believe that the project of the city is going to be better for many , although not a few people have the same questions about the dimension of the project presented .
but they start to re@@ sign@@ ate because the city has not yet received these answers , it says .
as you have heard , the effects of public statements by the may@@ or are also having an effect .
may had a very strong presence in the municip@@ al assembly that it would be going to put an end to the thermal bath , if the population had to take a stand against the plans for a bathing and wellness complex on the swiss me@@ ado@@ w .
some appear to be mis@@ gi@@ v@@ ings , because others are more inc@@ lined to think of them as &apos; cru@@ de attempts to black@@ mail &apos; the population , as stated in the bi press release .
the bi than@@ ked the don@@ ors for the color and all help@@ ers .

&quot; there is currently a dangerous tend@@ ency that man@@ e and al@@ an are going to fall into the category of s@@ wal@@ low k@@ ings , &quot; he took the two off@@ en@@ si@@ v@@ wir@@ bl@@ er on thursday at a press conference in salzburg .
the most recent occasion for the ran@@ king was that yellow was for man@@ e at the 3 : 0 against gr@@ ö@@ di@@ g last sunday , at which the sen@@ eg@@ al@@ ese was given a supposed ac@@ tress to be fat@@ ally fat@@ al - which is not .
&quot; a star@@ k mis@@ jud@@ g@@ ement , &quot; ran@@ gn@@ ick said , the re@@ fe@@ ree har@@ k@@ sed as &quot; completely over@@ stret@@ ched &quot; .
har@@ k@@ in would also have &quot; his part &quot; to es@@ cal@@ ate between salzburg co@@ ach ro@@ ger sch@@ mid@@ t and gr@@ ö@@ di@@ g tra@@ iner ad@@ i h@@ ü@@ t@@ ter after the match .
he was the first to be elected president of the united states , and he was the first to be elected president of the european parliament .
sch@@ mid@@ t himself wants to be the first to be able to contact the customer after the sch@@ nit@@ z@@ el with his hu@@ t .
i do not know why .
&quot; for i am the one who h@@ ath insul@@ ted , &quot; he stressed the 4@@ 6-@@ year-@@ old .
given the success of the project , the senior management of the company agreed to a pra@@ ising of the company .
&quot; there is only two words for this : right well &quot; , he said .
there is not much to be said about .
the way in which the commission has conducted its work is particularly impressive .
this is to continue .
changes in the winter season in the transfer time will hardly be possible .
there is no great reason to do anything about it .
&quot; except a player is entering with the desire that he should win out of the club , &quot; said ran@@ gn@@ ick .
supreme course : the first is obama ’ s health law
it is a great victory for the obama administration : the us supreme court , the supreme court , decided today that the country ’ s relationship with bar@@ ack obama is not constitutional .
with five to four votes , the jud@@ ges rul@@ ed that the single mandate of the patient protection and aff@@ or@@ d@@ able care act was not enough to prevent us officials from taking action by 20@@ 14 .
the supreme judge john ro@@ ber@@ ts proposed to the government &apos;s side of the four more liberal members of the chamber , while the jud@@ ges sc@@ alia , thomas , ali@@ to and ken@@ ne@@ dy decided against .
the court confirmed that the re@@ tention of the remaining sections of the 27@@ 00 pages law was not applicable , and it also argu@@ ed that the health law , according to which states should either meet the conditions for access to medic@@ aid or should otherwise extend all state aid .
the legal proceedings against the law were suspended from 26 states and the national federation of in@@ deb@@ ted persons .
the law was adopted by all leading republic@@ an presidential candidates , including the ultimate challenge of co@@ in ro@@ m@@ ney , in the pre-@@ election campaign of 2012 .

this basic idea gave rise to a long tradition in the village of her@@ ak@@ lion since 19@@ 13 .

frankfurt parking fees are to increase shar@@ p@@ ly .
parking in frankfurt could soon be sensitive more expensive .
the mag@@ i@@ str@@ ate of the city is discussing the future of the transport system this morning .
so the parking charges should be reduced by 50 % .
but this is not the reason for increasing prices , but the time inter@@ val of parking spaces and parking tickets .
in december , the city debt order regulation assembly will have to decide .
the retail committee of the i@@ h@@ k frankfurt considers this to be &quot; not a good idea &quot; .
the hotel is very clean and the staff is very friendly .
the traffic club germany believes that the use of the two decades &apos; increase is &apos; entirely appropriate and , in fact , long over@@ due &apos; .
public transport will also be more expensive .

the el@@ ders were not at all familiar with an experienced team , but they were not .
soon , however , it became clear that , even in terms of age , they were not satisfied with the rapid action of the city of fre@@ u@@ den@@ stadt .
with the hard and placed orders , the us and the uk , germany , and france , the united kingdom , took a very difficult step .

ner@@ v@@ ousness on both sides caused a major b@@ low in the bal@@ lo@@ on and score gi@@ fts ; even in the pa@@ st@@ ures , the precision was sometimes lacking .
in this highly sophisticated , high-@@ performance meeting , the group of the t@@ v-@@ team at mar@@ c@@ us bl@@ as@@ u@@ tto voted consistently in favour of the great physical effort and a pleasant commitment of both teams .

egypt s@@ wor@@ e first freely elected president
mo@@ ham@@ med mor@@ si is putting the o@@ ath of office , but his day of tri@@ um@@ ph should not be the end of political disputes in egypt .
islam@@ ist mo@@ ham@@ ma@@ d mur@@ si has promised a “ new egypt . ” when he was the first freely elected president of the country to be s@@ wor@@ n out , and thus the success@@ or of hus@@ ni mu@@ bar@@ ak , who had 16 months .
in his in@@ aug@@ ur@@ ation before the supreme constitutional court , mor@@ si was also elected for the first freely elected president of the arab world and egypt ’ s fifth head of state since the fall of the mon@@ arch@@ y some 60 years ago .
he put the o@@ ath before the 18 in black ro@@ bes , and put it to the jud@@ ges of the court , which is based on the n@@ ile and is dedicated to an ancient egyp@@ tian temple .
“ we are stri@@ ving for a better future , a new egypt , and a second republic , ” said mor@@ si at the f@@ es@@ tive cere@@ mony that took place live on state television .
“ today , the egyp@@ tian people have laid the foundations for a new life – absolute freedom , a true democracy and stability , ” said the 6@@ 0-@@ year-@@ old mor@@ si , a us trained and experienced engine@@ er and member of the muslim bro@@ ther@@ hood .
hundreds of soldiers and police officers were guar@@ ding the building when mur@@ si was briefly taken to the city centre after 11 o &apos;@@ clock local time .
just a few hundred follow@@ ers had been tried in the court to help the new president .
as an un@@ char@@ is@@ matic “ spare wheel ” of bro@@ ther@@ hood , the man in charge of his personal presti@@ ge has been a major player since his victory and a friday speech , in which he has not only been a candidate for islam@@ ists , but also of all .
“ egypt is now a civilian , national , constitutional , and modern state , ” he declared in a blue sky .
later mor@@ si went to the university of ca@@ iro where he started his in@@ aug@@ ural speech .
he was officially arrested by a army cha@@ pel , which was the national an@@ them , who had been killed in the town .
the military leader , fel@@ d@@ mar@@ sch@@ all hus@@ sein tan@@ ta@@ w@@ i , was present .
upon his arrival , he was att@@ acked by hundreds of people in the university ’ s largest aud@@ it@@ ori@@ um with ch@@ or@@ uses of “ the army and the people are one hand . ”
the company was founded in 19@@ 08 as a bas@@ tion of sec@@ ular education and is now a university of ca@@ iro .
mor@@ si presented a symbo@@ lic o@@ ath on friday at the ta@@ h@@ ir@@ -@@ square , the birth@@ place of the u@@ pris@@ ing that took place last year at the end of author@@ itarian mu@@ bar@@ ak ’ s rule , and he p@@ raised .
but , with the dis@@ plac@@ ement of the official o@@ ath to the court , and not , as usual , before parliament , it bo@@ ws to the will of the military , indic@@ ating that the power struggle will continue .

ra@@ pe in south africa : twice life imprison@@ ment
nine months after the brut@@ al ra@@ pe and mu@@ ti@@ lation of a 17@@ -@@ year-@@ old girl , the police and the military have been the victim on friday to twice life &apos;s death .
this was reported by the sen@@ der sab@@ c .
the victim was later involved in the consequences of the serious in@@ jur@@ ies .
joh@@ ann@@ es k@@ ana was in the police station at the beginning of the week .
the act had dis@@ cour@@ aged nation@@ wide sho@@ ck .
the then 2@@ 1-@@ year-@@ old had a daughter an@@ ene boo@@ y@@ sen in february in an industrial site in bre@@ d@@ as@@ dor@@ p near cape town .
14 hours fought the doctors for the survival of the victim , but he was in v@@ ain .
the sight of young people was so hor@@ ri@@ fying that the care@@ rs and s@@ na@@ ils had to be psycho@@ logical assistance .
k@@ ana had been promised during the process of being able to work with boo@@ y@@ ses in a bar .
he also acknowledged that she was be@@ aten and rap@@ ed .
the police were initially informed by several perpe@@ tr@@ ators , but they were released from two susp@@ ects .
the prosecu@@ tor &apos;s office also stressed during the trial that it was convinced that can@@ a was not able to take legal action at the time of the attack .
ra@@ pe is a crime in south africa almost as much as a day of life : every year , there are around 64 000 indic@@ ations of sexual violence .
these are almost ten times the amount in germany , but they are the highest in the world with 82 million people than south africa ( 50 million ) .
police and women &apos;s organisations in south africa appreciate the number of cases of sexual violence but the 10 to 2 % of the population .

the spec@@ t@@ ator sees that the dis@@ assembly of the ch@@ ests continues to be carried out by hand .
because black forests are sh@@ in@@ king tradi@@ tionally without b@@ ones in the shel@@ f .
the secret of the ham is the quality of the sp@@ ices with the sal@@ ty .
the hotel is located in the heart of the city , close to the main shopping area and the main shopping street .
the tr@@ ick : p@@ ine branches make a good job here in smo@@ ke .

they thought that travel agencies are a part of the past thanks to internet ?
flight centre seems to be moving towards a more open and more transparent way of dealing with the problem .
the company has increased its profits for the whole year and exp@@ ects record ear@@ nings of holiday makers in australia and the uk .
the travel company is now moving from a adjusted annual profit before taxes between 3@@ 25 and 3@@ 40 million dollars , compared with the 30@@ 5 to 3@@ 15 million dollars in its previous forec@@ ast .
if the current target values are achieved , then this means growth of 12 to 17 % compared to the record level of 3 % of gdp .
as managing director gra@@ ham tur@@ ner announced , the company ’ s flight centre achieved a total of eight percent profit in the first half of the year , and it achieved a strong start in the second half , especially in austr@@ ali@@ an and british private business .
“ since the beginning of the year , our ten countries have been prof@@ itable and some of them are in a good position to move towards record annual income before interest and taxes , ” he explained .
these include australia and the united kingdom , which are typically among our strong@@ est benefici@@ aries .
in australia , recre@@ ation has become a major industry in the second half of the year , which has created a slightly weak@@ er market for business trips .
the same was true of the leisure business of flight centre in the uk , while here too the business customers spent less .
the us business reco@@ vered from the seas@@ onal weak@@ ness of the first half of the year , so that the third con@@ secu@@ tive year saw a profit expected for the whole year .
the shares of flight centre increased by € 3 billion yesterday to € 3@@ 8.@@ 20 .
schools are encouraged to focus more on mathem@@ a@@ tics , legal education , and gram@@ mar .
in courses on english literature , you must learn at least one piece of sha@@ kes@@ pe@@ are , one robo@@ t of the 19th century , a romantic ly@@ ric@@ s and contemporary art in the uk .
the test also includes “ un@@ seen texts ” , which are used to provide a broader reading .
the combined course of english literature is a great way to get rid of the problem .
from 20@@ 15 , students must have a separate g@@ c@@ se test for language , and there must be strong incentives for eng@@ lish@@ -@@ language literature to be recognised as a separate quali@@ fication .
the ministry of education will be presenting the new cur@@ ricul@@ a for english and mathem@@ a@@ tics tomorrow – the first subjects that need radical re@@ design .
other core subjects will be discussed next year .
in a separate initiative , of@@ qu@@ al , the supervisory authority for aud@@ its , will be re@@ organis@@ ing the g@@ c@@ se structures , including a new bench@@ marking system .

sal@@ em : joh@@ anna ra@@ h@@ ner at the ec@@ um@@ en@@ ical forum of talks in vienna .
the next ec@@ um@@ en@@ ical forum on monday , 21 october will be held in the new museum of the castle , which will be devoted to the topic of &quot; hel@@ l with hel@@ l - the@@ ological considerations on how to deal with the last things &quot; .
lec@@ ture@@ r in the field of bio@@ logy , he is professor joh@@ anna ra@@ h@@ ner .
the ec@@ um@@ en@@ ical forum for talks is an initiative of the catho@@ lic and ev@@ angel@@ ical church communities of sal@@ em , the sal@@ em castle and the k@@ ul@@ tur@@ am@@ tes lake con@@ stance district .
joh@@ anna ra@@ h@@ ner wants to be able to look into the forum on how people are now going to be able to see the &quot; last things &quot; after death .
if the people of the past centuries had been too much aware of this , and had been able to look at those images of heav@@ en and hel@@ l , &quot; which still shape our ideas to this day , &quot; the contemporary pro@@ ph@@ ec@@ y doc@@ tr@@ ine of complete is drawing from us .
&quot; the greater hope is for christi@@ ans through the religi@@ ons .
she has &quot; met us with so many question marks that we are not satisfied with the ex@@ cl@@ am@@ ations .
joh@@ anna ra@@ h@@ ner goes on to say , &quot; but the crucial challenge remains the an@@ ger of death &quot; .
this is linked to the question of the long@@ ing for &quot; the dream of the end of everything to be good &quot; .
joh@@ anna ra@@ h@@ ner , born in 196@@ 2 in bad@@ en-@@ ba@@ den , studied chem@@ i@@ stry at the university of bad@@ en-@@ ba@@ den from 198@@ 2 to 1989 .
she gradu@@ ated from the university of applied sciences in 1997 as dr. the@@ ol .
the hab@@ ilitation for fundamental the@@ ology and eastern ec@@ um@@ en@@ ical the@@ ology followed in 2003 at the west@@ ph@@ ali@@ an wil@@ hel@@ ms university .
since 2010 joh@@ anna ra@@ h@@ ner has been teaching at the fac@@ ul@@ ty of systematic the@@ ology at the institute of catho@@ lic the@@ ology of the university of kas@@ sel .
ge@@ is@@ ling@@ en : more than 100 young catho@@ lic from the small heu@@ berg re@@ affir@@ m their commitment to the church at the company .
in two services of god 10@@ 1 15@@ - and 16@@ -@@ year-@@ old te@@ en@@ ag@@ ers of the se@@ al@@ or@@ ge@@ unity were fir@@ med at the small heu@@ berg .
the service is accompanied by a visit to the group lau@@ dat@@ o-@@ si in the morning , in the afternoon of the youth cho@@ ir the spirit .
the reception of the fir@@ m@@ sac@@ ram@@ ent was a great opportunity for young people to say yes to their b@@ ap@@ tism and to ask for the power of the holy spirit .
the fir@@ m@@ lin@@ s had changed significantly in recent months , under the direction of di@@ ak@@ on rein@@ er stre@@ h@@ ner and the help of numerous community members on the large festival day .
in various projects , they met various tasks of christian community and were able to experience the same status as a youth day .
ill@@ men@@ see : second mountain bike trail in the salz@@ kam@@ mer@@ gu@@ t region , en@@ thr@@ alled participants from all over the world .
with beautiful weather , 2@@ 14 bicycle ri@@ ders arrived to ill@@ men@@ see to explore the circuit on foot .
this tells ul@@ rich kno@@ bel of the organiz@@ ing sports club ill@@ men@@ see .
among the participants were , especially at the short distance over 15 kilometers and 300 meters of al@@ titude , numerous je@@ der@@ man@@ n@@ s@@ rad@@ ler who had their ho@@ b@@ by in competition once .
two junior drivers of the german top class were in this race as well .
these two could not , as expected , leave the field .
as in the previous year , fe@@ li@@ x bad@@ er was able to make a small advance in time and def@@ ended his title as overall winner of the short distance .
in second place , pa@@ z@@ al tre@@ u@@ bel was again able to win the title .
the staff were very friendly and helpful .
in second and third place anne am@@ ade@@ us and her family came from ill@@ men@@ see and leon@@ ie drivers from o@@ w@@ ingen .
a pleasant development is the increasing number of people travelling by car , which is a major problem in the community .
not only in terms of performance , the whole range of services was very much represented .
age structure also suff@@ ices from ten years of the most recent up to 70 years of age among the oldest star@@ ters .
in the main race this year more absolute top stars were on the race track .
four drivers could not be convinced of the regional leaders .
phili@@ p@@ p pan@@ ger@@ l , a mountain bike expert , has been selected by the black tus@@ k race team to be the first mountain bike champi@@ on in the world .
pan@@ ger@@ l was a team member who had been the world champi@@ on two times during the 12@@ -@@ hour race .
this year he was the european champi@@ on in this special discipline .
with this , ro@@ land b@@ aller@@ ste@@ dt , who already won two german championship tit@@ les in the du@@ ath@@ l@@ on .
after 45 kilometers and 9@@ 00 meters of al@@ titude , a jo@@ ke came to the final in the final race .
pan@@ ger@@ l r@@ ack first on the finishing line .
only one second behind it was able to see the rout@@ ine b@@ aller@@ ste@@ dt for second in the overall rating .
at the same time , her@@ mann and war@@ th@@ mann , as the third of the overall ran@@ king , came to the finish .
in the women &apos;s ran@@ king , christian co@@ h@@ s@@ mann was the fas@@ test in the main race .
the second place was awarded to are@@ ane bl@@ er@@ sch from b@@ ing@@ e compul@@ sions in front of nat@@ as@@ ch@@ a wer@@ ner from stutt@@ gart .
athle@@ tes and help@@ ers were very satisfied with the ty@@ re and the good organization of the event .
on the way through mu@@ d , rivers and jun@@ g@@ les for free medical care .
dr. geor@@ ges b@@ wel@@ le provides free medical assistance in remote villages in camer@@ o@@ on , where the children are still being treated .
b@@ sha@@ fen and his team spend almost every weekend trying to get hundreds of patients treated .
in the west african country there are not many doctors , only one for 5@@ ,000 people .
do you agree with your mobile or other voice devices ?
dr. geor@@ ges b@@ wel@@ le is one of the top 10 of the “ c@@ n@@ n her@@ oes of 2013 ” .
you can choose to pay for him or any of the other her@@ oes in the top 10 to make him the “ c@@ n@@ n her@@ o of the year ” .
the winner will receive $ 25@@ 0.@@ 000 to continue his exceptional work .
for 21 years , geor@@ ges b@@ wel@@ le saw with him how his si@@ ck father constantly conf@@ used the consci@@ ousness and led to hospit@@ als that were not informed about the means to make him .
j@@ ame@@ f b@@ sha@@ ft was born in 198@@ 1 in the vicinity of y@@ a@@ oun@@ d@@ é , the capital of camer@@ o@@ on .
he was born in the city of k@@ ent@@ uc@@ ky , and was a member of the royal family .
“ there was no neu@@ ro@@ sur@@ gery in camer@@ o@@ on , ” geor@@ ges br@@ wel@@ le said .
we should have made him out of camer@@ o@@ on if we had had the money .
instead , bar@@ b@@ arian people spent years trying to persu@@ ade his father to over@@ crow@@ ded clin@@ ics and hospit@@ als to take care of his treatment .
“ it is not easy , ” comments b@@ sha@@ ft .
you can leave at 5 in the morning and go to the hospital , to help the first one , and is still not the first .
there are a great many patients .
some people even die because they have to wait .
the situation has hardly changed since bse was born in 2002 .
in camer@@ o@@ on , there is only one doctor for every 5@@ ,000 people , according to the world health organisation .
on the other hand , the relationship in the united states is with a doctor for 4@@ 13 people .
but even if there is a doctor for them , the costs of most camera manufacturers could not afford to visit .
two out of five people in the country live below the poverty line and nearly three-@@ quarters of health spending in the country is private .
“ the only problem you have is that you are in poverty , ” says b@@ wel@@ le .
and poverty makes it impossible to save life .
his father and so many of his comp@@ at@@ ri@@ ots had to see in b@@ sha@@ fen the decision to do something about it .
dr. geor@@ ges b@@ wel@@ le and his volunte@@ er team have worked 700 free opera projects last year .
he was himself a doctor and worked as a v@@ as@@ cu@@ lar sur@@ ge@@ on in the central hospital in y@@ a@@ oun@@ d@@ é .
he also founded a non-@@ profit organization called as@@ co@@ vi@@ me , which is working on week@@ ends in rural areas .
since 2008 , he and his group have spent almost 3@@ 2@@ ,000 people .
almost every friday , he and until the last 30 people are forced to go to the bus and ride with the snow@@ y medical equipment on the roof over un@@ fa@@ st@@ ened ter@@ rain .
not always , everything is going smo@@ o@@ thly .
for more than one time , they had to pass through rivers and s@@ lu@@ dge .
but if you arrive , you will be like her@@ oes : a f@@ es@@ tive , sing@@ ing and dance and the best accommodation , the best place to offer .
in these villages , free medical care is really a reason to celebrate and b@@ sha@@ ft – with its wide sm@@ ile and its boun@@ dless energy – is popular with the fro@@ sty guests .
the next morning the team starts with the examination of hundreds of patients .
“ per ride we treat 500 people ” , says b@@ sha@@ ft .
they come from a region of 60 kilometres around the village – and that is on foot .
each of these weekend clin@@ ics offers medical care in a number of areas .
many people are being held ho@@ stage to mal@@ aria , tu@@ ber@@ cu@@ lo@@ sis , mal@@ nutri@@ tion , di@@ abe@@ tes , par@@ a@@ sites , and sex@@ ually transmitted diseases .
others get cr@@ ut@@ ches , don@@ ated gl@@ asses or free birth certific@@ ates – a document that is important for school .
in the evening , the team conduc@@ ts simple operations with local an@@ es@@ the@@ sia .
the operations usually take place in a school , the town hall or an apartment ; after the entrance , the sur@@ gery is placed on the patient and the rest area is left to take place for the next .
the lighting for the op and the de@@ sin@@ fe@@ k@@ tion equipment is controlled by the gener@@ ator of the group and thus work b@@ sha@@ ft and its volunte@@ ers to the early morning hours of sunday .
it is a challenging pen@@ sum , but the people of the village help to make the team mo@@ tivation .
&quot; they dr@@ um@@ mer all night , so we wake up and let our work continue , &quot; says b@@ wel@@ le .
on sunday the team will then go back to the city , ti@@ red but proud of the work done .
the group – a mix@@ ture of camer@@ o@@ on doctors and foreign medical students – has been awarded 700 free operations last year and knows that they are very satisfied with their work .
a man said that the free operation of a br@@ ute cr@@ ash that he had received was now available to him again .
“ this changes the future of my family , ” said the man .
in addition to the weekend clin@@ ics and his work as a sur@@ ge@@ on in the hospital , b@@ wel@@ le also works at night in private clin@@ ics in y@@ a@@ oun@@ d@@ é .
this second job financed the company ’ s 60 % of its non-@@ profit activities , according to b@@ sha@@ fen ; the rest of the family from private don@@ ations .
“ i really do not know when he sle@@ eps , ” k@@ ati@@ e o &apos;@@ mal@@ ley says , who was born in the second year at the dre@@ x@@ el university in phil@@ ade@@ l@@ phi@@ a medicine and volunte@@ ered in bre@@ men .
he is always in the hospital or tried to spend money on the organization , so he can go to these campaigns .
for medical and nur@@ sing care students like o &apos;@@ m@@ alle@@ y , who come from the usa and europe and are b@@ sha@@ ft , this is an opportunity to gain practical experience , which they can use at home .
“ we can be very helpful in operations where we help to save blood , ” says dr. ru@@ dol@@ f sch@@ um@@ ach@@ er , ceo of the company .
that would be a medical student in america in the second year .
students pay for their trip to camer@@ o@@ on themselves and often bring lo@@ ose san@@ itation and medical equipment .
but are you in y@@ a@@ oun@@ d@@ é first , b@@ wel@@ le takes over the accommodation , transport and instruc@@ tion .
“ he is without doubt a her@@ o , ” says o &apos;@@ mal@@ ley .
he de@@ votes his life to this organisation and his desire to help the camer@@ o@@ on people , knows no b@@ ounds .
for b@@ sha@@ ft the almost permanent work is not a burden .
others to a happ@@ i@@ er life , and thus a promise to live in a better life , to live in a better world .
“ i am so happy when i have this work , ” says the ceo of b@@ wel@@ le .
and i am thinking of my father .
i hope he will see what i am doing .
i will do it to re@@ connect people to lau@@ ghter and to make the pain felt .
visit the website of as@@ co@@ vi@@ me and learn how to use it .
excellent the fight , but the best way to win the fight is to get the best of both worl@@ ds .
the role of s@@ anti@@ ago , the old man in hem@@ ing@@ way &apos;s no@@ ve@@ le &quot; the old man and the sea &quot; , is hor@@ st jan@@ son on the cor@@ pse .
jan@@ son himself is an old hand in his meeting , the actor &apos;s art .
the old man s@@ anti@@ ago cannot be seen when fishing .
this is how the two are simply great .
it is almost thought that the fol@@ ds in the nec@@ k of the old man , of whom the fisher@@ man &apos;s boy , man@@ olo , spe@@ aks , can be seen .
if s@@ anti@@ ago is ti@@ red of life , he is on the chair and he is not in the chair , then jan@@ son is really .
in addition , the role of the old fisher@@ man is through and through a character role that jan@@ son excell@@ ently masters .
hem@@ ing@@ way told the story of a figh@@ ter who was a bra@@ ve man , who was not abandoned and who was ultimately replaced by his knowledge and his will .
jan@@ son is widely known as the sole actor on the stage .
it man@@ ages to draw the public &apos;s attention to itself and to make it more visible .
his efforts to finally get fish to the surface of the water are a step in the right direction that the vie@@ wers forget , that the sea is only made of blue .
director j@@ ens ha@@ z@@ el@@ mann has left the old man in front of the fishing village .
in the course of the performance , he sets the active scene in the light : the cab@@ in of s@@ anti@@ ago , the bar of the sing@@ er mari@@ e-@@ lu@@ ise gun@@ st , the bar , which is playing with her songs and her splendid voice .
the four musicians play cuba &apos;s r@@ ha@@ e@@ to-@@ style rhy@@ th@@ m and are also guests of the bar .
tourism : des@@ cent to the roman@@ s
the hotel is situated in a quiet area , just a few steps from the city centre .
if you visit cologne , you will not be missed .
around 15@@ 7 metres the two tur@@ re@@ ts rise into the sky and make it the second highest point of the church in europe .
but few visitors who have seen the two f@@ ili@@ gre@@ e church to@@ wers are aware of the fact that the city is also known as the cathedral .
ra@@ iner schul@@ ze is an expert in cologne and is a member of the leading german society .
meeting point for his guided tours is the service center of cologne tourism directly at the du@@ om@@ o .
the tour starts at a very un@@ spectacular stage : &quot; we start in the underground garage .
in the 197@@ 0s , the city v@@ ä@@ r@@ rers wanted car fit@@ ting town , and that is why the remains of the old city wall remained only standing what was not too big .
most users of the e@@ ye@@ -@@ cat@@ ching park are now also interested in the remains of roman times and only make their cars available .
but who knows more about it , disco@@ vers the beauty of the park dec@@ k d@@ 2 , which is separated by metal lat@@ ti@@ ce bars .
the museum is located in the old town of k@@ az@@ im@@ i@@ er@@ z , in the old town of k@@ az@@ im@@ i@@ er@@ z .
&quot; it is remains of the roman city wall that were built in the second half of the first century after christ .
before returning to the day@@ light , the sho@@ e is made to the upper side of the park by schul@@ ze .
that is the well of the old cathedral , which unfortunately is hardly seen .
the clo@@ s@@ est station of the tour is the pra@@ et@@ ori@@ um , where the participants clim@@ b down into the depth .
we are witn@@ essing the inc@@ um@@ b@@ ent of the once most powerful man north of the alps , the champi@@ on of the c@@ ca@@ a .
as far as c@@ ca@@ a is concerned , a visitor wants to know what c@@ ca@@ a means .
&quot; the ab@@ bre@@ vi@@ ation stands for &quot; col@@ onia cla@@ u@@ dia ara ag@@ ri@@ pp@@ in@@ en@@ si@@ um &quot; , which is in german as much as &quot; city of roman law and city of ag@@ ri@@ pp@@ ine .
and when the pra@@ et@@ ori@@ um is the former sta@@ tely holder palace , the building of power , the roman empire , the palace of the empire .
from the hall of the exhibition , a tunnel access to the roman se@@ wage channel , which is located here at about 120 metres long .
&quot; you can enjoy a piece of the so-called clo@@ ac@@ a maxim@@ a .
a surprise has schul@@ ze yet .
after taking part in the cash prize , he will lead the team to a small , 16 metres deep , covered with a wal@@ k-@@ in box .
&quot; we are now in the mi@@ k@@ we , a rit@@ ual jewish bath , &quot; explains the author .
the jewish community built its bathroom deep in the ground , to be adapted to the gr@@ ound@@ water , which is essential for rit@@ ual washing .
to date , the lower end of the mi@@ k@@ we , the origin@@ s of which date back to the eigh@@ th century , has seen various levels of water from the rh@@ ine .
the mi@@ k@@ we will be part of an archae@@ ological area on the town hall square , for which the construction works will start shortly .
until completion , however , some years will be left .
le@@ g almost ch@@ op@@ ped : re@@ run of ro@@ ck@@ er process .
a bloo@@ dy attack in the ro@@ ck@@ er@@ mil@@ i@@ eu is going to be launched after more than four years .
a trial that tried to kill , end@@ an@@ ger the body and damage to property for two 30@@ -@@ year-@@ old has taken place before the district court of frankfurt ( oder ) .
it is accompanied by strict safety precau@@ tions .
the def@@ end@@ ants were silent on the start .
they should be used in the ro@@ ck@@ er scene and then become the ban@@ di@@ dos .
the prosecu@@ tor raises the question of whether he should be able to take part in the trial in fin@@ ow@@ furt in june 2009 , together with unknown accompl@@ ices , in a car .
all the victims were seriously in@@ ju@@ red , a man would almost have lost his le@@ g .
the victims are to be forced to compete with hel@@ ls ang@@ els , who are the only ones who have been killed .
one is to be a high-@@ level member from berlin .
this was followed by a series of persecu@@ tion , apparently involving several cars .
according to the indic@@ tment , the issue was of re@@ vi@@ er@@ fi@@ k@@ fighting and a demonstration of power .
the two def@@ end@@ ants were in j@@ ail at the beginning of 2012 in a first trial .
a court of law said at the time that it was not proven that the european union &apos;s men were interested in the bloo@@ dy f@@ eu@@ d .
the perpe@@ tr@@ ators had carried mas@@ ks and were not recognized .
the federal court of justice has ann@@ ul@@ led the judgment after the revision of the prosecu@@ tion and referred it to the re@@ trial of the court of justice .
one of the def@@ end@@ ants is currently in prison for another off@@ ence .
the first of these was the creation of the new castle , the new building of the castle .
as a witness , the then determined commissioner was loaded .
the centre was on hand@@ -@@ held talks between the accused and other people who had inter@@ cep@@ ted the police .
it is difficult for ro@@ ck@@ ers to be able to get involved in a crime that they find difficult to en@@ force in court - and not statements .
this also applies to the victims .
in the first process , only one of the victims had been un@@ packed .
prosecu@@ tor ste@@ fan gol@@ fi@@ er of the public prosecu@@ tor &apos;s office frankfurt ( oder ) said at demand that there were no cases of new trac@@ es since the last trial .
for the process , ele@@ ven further negotiating days are scheduled .
the dispos@@ able company does not think of the company as a whole .
the night was long , the music l@@ oud and the mo@@ od good , but at some point it goes home .
but in the trees of the people on the fron@@ t-@@ passenger and re@@ ar seats , the hun@@ ger is notic@@ eable .
of course , one or two cock@@ tails may be the best choice .
what is more obvious than being ch@@ illed for the next dri@@ ve-@@ in ?
i admit that i am happy to be with you when it comes to late night or late night .
a few pom@@ mes , a col@@ a , a bur@@ ger - and then ni@@ x as from home and into bed !
but the way home is not only a reflection of the obvious differences between myself and other hun@@ gr@@ y dis@@ co go@@ ers .
what is needed to make a mistake about having to deal with its facts with constant regul@@ arity ?
in particular , at the week@@ ends , the swe@@ eping paper bags are on street borders and on par@@ k@@ places .
&quot; why ? &quot; , i wonder .
are people too do@@ of to the t@@ acks with after home respected .
it is not just the case that the paper product is changing the landscape , but also the paper production .
bags are also already available in transport facilities such as control panels , which have caused accidents .
i am not sure what the said &quot; dispos@@ able society &quot; thin@@ ks about , but probably she does not even know what this word actually means .
if you have to spend time in the evening , especially with several people in the car , you know how to get back to the car after a busy night : kla@@ mo@@ tte , fl@@ ash@@ es and other things .
a few t@@ ents would be more or less nic@@ ely cut out - in contrast to the street where no one is on the food lef@@ to@@ vers of other rum@@ p .
i can see the day when the commission will be able to give the cities and communities the chance to make a start - and the fa@@ st-@@ food directive will be a good idea for their bags .
obama ’ s back@@ l@@ ash in health policy
after much criticism , president obama made a back@@ l@@ ash yesterday in his frequently repeated , un@@ ambigu@@ ous promise : “ if your hospit@@ als are happy to provide you with health insurance , then you can keep it . ”
after hundreds of thousands of their insu@@ rers have announced a letter of notice , they have raised their concerns about the future of the country to the president .
yesterday , the obama rela@@ ti@@ sed his original promise .
“ the vast majority of citizens who are seeking a functioning health insurance are not able to keep it , ” he said at a speech in bo@@ ston .
in response to the numerous media reports on the redun@@ dan@@ cies , obama ur@@ ged those americans who received such communications to sign up to the free market .
most citizens could thus have a better , more comprehensive health insurance for the same price or cheaper than forec@@ ast .
“ you will get a better deal , ” he said .
the government described it as un@@ surprising that the us and the world ’ s five per cent who had insurance themselves are still in the process of re@@ viewing another tari@@ ff , as their contract did not meet the new standards under the affir@@ d@@ able care .
“ i would like to thank these americans very directly : they deserve better , ” se@@ be@@ lit@@ z said at a hearing before the energy and climate trade committee of the house of representatives in washington .
se@@ beli@@ us , who is responsible for implementing the affir@@ d@@ able care act , is a member of the european commission , explained that the launch of the online platform was “ mis@@ er@@ able ” since october .
“ i am as fru@@ stra@@ ted and an@@ gr@@ y as others , ” she said .
i am determined to reg@@ ain your trust .
this statement is not true of an out@@ cast se@@ be@@ li@@ us , a phrase that is behind her sitting advis@@ er at yesterday &apos;s hearing in the house of representatives .
after more than three hours of consultation , lon@@ g se@@ be@@ lit@@ z repeatedly be@@ sie@@ ged the issue of why the “ architec@@ t ” of the affir@@ d@@ able care act was not released volun@@ tar@@ ily .
government in jerusal@@ em confir@@ ms attack on sy@@ ri@@ an air base not only in the area of the sy@@ ri@@ an air base but also in the area of the sy@@ ri@@ an air base .
an american government official who was anonymous , and who wanted to remain anonymous , said to the american intelligence service , c@@ n@@ n , that israeli combat officers had been arrested .
the aim is to &apos; missi@@ les and related equipment &apos; , which are the israeli army &apos;s fear .
sy@@ ri@@ an and leban@@ ese media , as well as the arab al-@@ arab@@ i@@ ya channel previously reported that the base in the port city of lat@@ ak@@ ia was in the night of wednesday .
the israeli television channel , channel 2 , showed satellite images of the base in la@@ ta@@ ki@@ a , on which russian missi@@ les were deplo@@ yed from the s-@@ 12@@ 5 ne@@ wa and a bat@@ ter@@ ie of sat@@ -@@ 3 missi@@ les .
un@@ certain about the government in jerusal@@ em has officially failed to confirm the attack .
however , the news agency quo@@ tes re@@ u@@ ters a similarly anonymous israeli journ@@ alist , who is saying that he believes that the israeli state &apos;s attack was carried out , but is not certain .
one speaker from the israeli ministry of defence said , in any case , &apos; we do not comment on these reports &apos; .
the journ@@ alist ron ben@@ -@@ y@@ is@@ ha@@ i stressed that the european union &apos;s policy on the protection of human rights is not based on the principle of fair competition .
the israeli government has repeatedly war@@ ned that it will not allow syria to make any attempt to use he@@ z@@ bol@@ lah with chemical or other dangerous weapons .
john ker@@ ry explains in an unprecedented interview that the us government has been unable to stop the es@@ pi@@ on@@ age .
john ker@@ ry indicated with an un@@ expected in@@ d@@ entation that he was not prepared to accept the def@@ ensive stance of the united states on its surveillance programs .
the foreign minister also acknowledged that he was dec@@ ei@@ ving bar@@ ack obama and that he was responsible for not being “ au@@ top@@ il@@ ot ” .
the integrated and un@@ broken information makes the us government more involved in a diplomatic stor@@ m of indi@@ gn@@ ation on the part of its allies .
in a video connection , the speech on the open government platform was presented to the public by ker@@ ry : “ there is no doubt that the president and myself , as well as others in the government , have learned of some things that are almost au@@ top@@ il@@ ot .
then he ad@@ mitted as the first high-@@ level member of the us government that the us government was not responsible for the border .
he said : ‘ in some cases , this is in@@ appropri@@ ately gone too far . ’
the president is determined to make it clear and is therefore conduc@@ ting a thorough investigation so that no one feels that he is being ab@@ used .
i assure you that the rights of inno@@ cent people are respected in this process .
