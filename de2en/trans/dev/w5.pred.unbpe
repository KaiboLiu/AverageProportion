review : more security for pedestrians !
they are not 100 metres from each other : on tuesday , a conference will be held in gutach on the new b 33-pedestrian traffic light at the village parking lot - within sight of the older town hall buildings .
two plants so close together : intention or tortoise ?
this question was raised yesterday by the mayor of gután .
&quot; the town hall sample was installed at the time because it was the school trail &quot; , explains the cornert yesterday .
kluser-traffic lights secure both cyclists and bus passengers and mountain residents .
the agreement officially launched yesterday is important for the crossing area of sulzbachweg / kirchstraße .
we have the museum , two churches , spa gardens , the bus stop , a doctor and a bank as well as the traffic flow from the residential area › grub ‹ .
&quot; the high traffic and pedestrian traffic had to be ensured by another amplifier , &quot; says eckert .
peter arnold from the council of the offenburg region confirms this .
&quot; according to current measurements , the b 33 daily passes through the municipality of gutach , approximately 10 percent of which are heavy goods vehicles , &quot; arnold emphasizes .
therefore , the construction of a further traffic light is more than necessary : &apos; safety is just a matter of urgency &apos; , arnold says .
in total , four transport shows have been carried out , and a roundabout has been thought about , but because of the close connection in the crossing area sulzbachweg / kirchstraße .
according to arnold , the location of the traffic light mast was tested before : &quot; using a special for us with particularly long wooden stains , the traffic was reduced to a minimum .
the approximately eur 15 000 expensive traffic light system itself is the &quot; most modern thing it has on the market &quot; , explains the arnld .
the complex is decorated with coloured leds , which are so powerful that the light is shining from the drivers , for example , even when the sun is low .
and it is also economical : the older lighting systems use up to 100 watts , the new just eight watts .
there are three light systems per direction .
arnold explained the new equipment technology : it is equipped with two radar sensors .
if the pedestrian pushes the traffic light button , the upper radar sensor tests the traffic situation .
if the road is free , the green is immediately for the pedestrian , if not , it takes about 15 seconds .
another radar sensor checks whether the green phase for the pedestrian has been finished .
&quot; if a group or disabled person were to go out on the streets , the green phase will be extended , so everyone will come safely via the train , &quot; arnold said .
of course , drivers must be considered partners here and the track monitored .
that was not the case yesterday : hardly had the traffic lights green on , smoked in a top lamp and the traffic was not even visible .
josef winkler has been writing for more than 30 years the needs of his childhood and youth from the soul .
the disasters of its catholic village childhood - the lack of voice , the inclination to raw violence and blunt sexuality , the close and joylessness - have left carinthia &apos;s poet many times .
the büchner prize winner is known mainly as the author of prose , theatre texts are written in his work rar .
collage from prosatextes gerhard fresacher presents for his performance &quot; wetterluss auf der zungen &quot; , which is now in garage x at st. peter &apos;s square .
the theatre maker combines elements from the autobiographical style of roman &quot; der leigenen &quot; ( 1987 ) with prosaminierung from &quot; corpus , his family belauerd &quot; ( 2003 ) .
on the largely empty stage - important requisitous : a crumbling bass , a glass of champagne and a glass of champagne .
the director seems to have been rather slow to trust the text .
the 70-minute performance is exaggerated with a wealth of new features and features .
the actresses in particular are sometimes somewhat questionable scenic transpositions .
they are hard-pressed , with their head under water , with their evening rays at the wall , and with their heads .
forced into cellophane or tender , stacces them to dangerously high sticks through the staging , either monolith or the volume of the sun is completely silent .
the text is based on this hard-working approach , however , and hardly gives any indication .
the best moments have the evening when sung - the bandwidth is from deep pong to the night .
only towards the end comes the overlapping performance a little to calm , and winkler &apos;s absurd humor looks up .
a black box in the car ?
american road planners are looking for a source of money to stop the declining highway system .
the devices that carry every kilometre and store the information to the authorities are core to a controversy that has been attempted by washington and the planning offices of the states to make the outdated system of us financing american banks .
the normally rather boring area of road planning has suddenly caused an intense debate with colourful alliances .
libertarians have joined forces with environmental groups and advocate the need for the government to protect small boxes .
the tea party is horrified .
the american civil rights association ( aclu ) is also deeply concerned and expresses a series of data protection concerns .
but , while congress does not agree on a course of action , several states no longer wait .
they are currently examining how they can be achieved over the next ten years to a system where drivers can earn more than one mile .
thousands of car drivers have been using the tachograph , some of which are equipped with gps surveillance , and have already been tested .
this really is a must for our country .
“ it is not something we will only use , ” hasan ikhrata , managing director of the southern hemisphere , said .
the way we have managed to pay these taxes will change .
the technology is there .
the initiative comes at a time when the highway trust fund , the national central bank financed by taxes , is being pushed to the fuel dispenser .
but america is not getting as much fuel as it used to .
cars use less petrol .
the government mineral oil tax of 18.4 cents per gallon ( less than 4 euro cents per litre ) has not been rising for 20 years .
politicians dare not dare to tax even at a crunch .
“ the gas tax is simply not sustainable , ” says lee munnich , an expert on transport legislation at the university of minnesota .
his federal state recently built 500 cars with tachographs , which would allow a mile-based payment system to be tested .
“ this is the most sensible alternative in the long term , ” he said .
bureaucrats call it mile-based user charges .
not surprisingly , the idea of urban liberals is well received , because the tax could be used to promote the driving habits as if they were stalled and climate damaging waste emissions .
the california planners are relying on the system to develop strategies to address the ambitious , legislative and political challenges that the federal state has set for climate change .
but the republican bill shuster of pennsylvania , chairman of the house transportation committee , has been pushing for a more effective and effective policy .
free marketers of the reason foundation are also affected by the idea that drivers should be returned to the market after the distance travelled .
“ this is not a tax that is disappearing in a black hole , ” explains adrian moore , vice president of guidelines at reason .
people pay directly for what they get .
the movement is also supported by two former us transport ministers who have been calling for the 2011 congress to take part in the process of mile-based disclosure .
the us senate approved a 90 million dollars expensive program last year , which would cost $ 10,000 cars .
but the majority in the house of representatives prevented the move and responded to the concerns of members from rural areas who were trying to represent people who were in everyday life often lost many miles on the way to work or to the city .
several states and major cities are nevertheless moving in the right direction at their own pace .
the most committed is oregon , which currently has 5,000 riders for the country ’ s largest experiment .
these drivers will soon be able to pay mileage fees instead of mineral oil taxes to the state .
nevada has already completed a pilot project .
new york city is also considering one .
illinois tests it in a limited way with trucks .
and the i-95 coalition , to which the transport ministries of 17 states are associated on the east coast ( including maryland , pennsylvania , virginia and florida ) , is currently examining how to see this change .
the concept is not a universal hit .
in nevada , where 50 volunteers recently equipped with the equipment , drivers were sceptical about the idea of the government taking any of its movements .
“ concerns about big brother and such things were a big problem , ” explains alauddin khan , head of the strategy and result management at the united states transport ministry .
people did not want it .
when the test started , the aclu warned of nevada on your site : “ it would be relatively easy to read the tachograph in full-blown surveillance equipment .
there is no need to create a gigantic , bulky technological infrastructure that is inevitably bound to lead to the creation of data on the daily movements of individuals .
nevada is part of a number of states that are now seeking affordable technology .
so , khan argued , the public would be more reassured .
the hunt for this technology has led some authorities to become a small startup company called true mileage in california .
the company was not originally registered to help states with the taxation of car drivers .
rather , it was their aim to create a new market for car insurance , which is now in a state of emergency , in which drivers are entitled to pay on the basis of the miles they have been driving .
but the tests it has tested are also very useful for road planners , because they do not work with gps and provide limited information that is regularly transmitted via modem .
“ people are more prepared to participate , if their speed and stability are not recorded , ” says the president of ryan morrison , managing director of true michel .
some of these public pilot programs have made major mistakes .
there are much cheaper and less intrusive ways of doing this .
in oregon , the planters experiment with making car drivers perform a series of choices .
you can register for a device with or without gps .
or you do not choose any device at all and pay a lump sum fee based on the average of the hazards of all the inhabitants of the state .
others hope to see the concept of a suspicious public sell by using the devices with more functions .
in new york city , traffic officers want to develop a tax device that can also pay parking fees , provide insurance only for dangerous vehicles .
“ drivers would be made more aware of the benefits the system offers , ” says the president of the commission , “ motorists would be encouraged to participate ” .
some transport planters , however , are wondering whether all the talk about paying per mile is not just a huge diversion .
the metropolitan transport co. kg is a member of the san francisco bay transport commission , which has declared that the congress can solve the problem of bankruptcy highway trust fund easily by increasing the number of fuel taxes .
an additional one-off fee or annual fee could be a disincentive for drivers with hybrid vehicles or other vehicles that use little petrol .
“ there is no reason for an operation if an aspirin is also sufficient , ” explains randy rentschler , the head of legislation and public affairs of the commission .
if we do that , hundreds of millions of drivers are worried about their privacy and many other things .
königsfeld : small team beats wacker
the voluntary fire brigade managed its autumn diaphragm despite lack of personnel with bravour .
only eleven men took part in the exercise .
department commander hans kammerer was in his usual practice assumption to defend the estate feather in the burgberger straße .
the sawing process is to be short .
the fire and the smoke development have led to two injuries , one of which could have an emergency call .
two respiratory trays of the armed forces were in a state of emergency after the first review of the situation by hans kammerer .
after a short time , the first person was found and moved to the outdoors .
the second person had to be borne .
this was not so easy , as a narrow staircase had to be overcome .
the building , a workshop with integrated stalling for two horses , was not easy to secure .
it stored a lot of wood and also straw bales in it .
the first two were the electric machines for wood processing .
the first extinction took place via the tank in the vehicle .
another line was given by a overfloor hydrant in about 100 meters away .
now three extinguishers could be designed .
the building also used a hollow beam pipe .
hans kammerer was about the practice to show that what happened with little available space was not possible .
in case of emergency , support is provided through the königsfeld daycare group .
the commander was shown to be in good hands with the procedure .
networking of universities and companies important to the success of universities and companies .
during his visit to the breisgau high black forest district , the president of the country , guido wolf , was also informed in titisee-neustadt of where the workforce of tomorrow comes from .
the federal ministry of education and research ( bmbf ) has launched a new project to promote the federal ministry of education and research ( bmbf ) .
&quot; education is an important factor in the location &quot; , claudia stelle , director of the hans-thoma school , emphasizing networked school project education center hochschwarzwald .
wolf was impressed by the model projects for training .
since 2011 , there has been successful cooperation between the support centre , kreisgymnasium and vocational school centre in the forest city .
he also praised the family-friendly atmosphere in the district .
&quot; it is important not only to look at the family phase , but also to look at the family phase , due to demographic changes , to care for relatives , &quot; wolf said .
he also stated that more and more employees are concerned about the care and care of their families .
&quot; without the support of employers , the resulting unemployment cannot be reduced .
but no one can afford to employ skilled workers , he said .
another factor , particularly important , is the networking of universities and businesses .
&quot; for those who have already experienced the benefits of the region during their studies , the hotel remains in the hands of their acquired knowledge and skills .
only if there is sufficient training place available can the professional person be able to cover the needs of the skilled .
in his opinion , the location advantage of the district is its advantageous location in the south-west of germany , close to france and switzerland .
he also experienced a great deal of emotion during his train journey from titisee-neustadt to freiburg , in order to develop public transport .
&quot; stay persistent and stay at home .

for 15 years , the kaul family has been inviting the dietinger seniors to coffee , cake and then to a vesper .
in the past , the elderly were forced to rest in the resting place .
meanwhile , this afternoon , the st. josef nursing home is being held .
the residents were looking forward to the delicious cakes and cakes .
later , there was salad salad .

the more than 100 years old natural stone wall as the front line of the old school courtyard to the kirchstrasse is to be rebuilt with the rehabilitation plan of the city of bräunlingen .
in the days before the kilbig , the first sanitation work of the front school was completed with a small corner wall , to stabilize and static relief of the more than a hundred years old stone wall with balustrade .
the way forward , alexander milok said , is to be elected by the bräunlinger stadtbaumamt , the landeslandmalamt , and to propose a rehabilitation concept for the old wall .
after that , a cost calculation is to be carried out by experts , who will then be sent to the municipal council to decide and decide on the further course of action .
a decision on this is expected to be taken next year .
after renovation , pavement and planting of the old school building , the building was rebuilt and the building was rebuilt in 1912 .
the historic , one-hundred years old seal of the old school court to kirchstraße , is characterised by water and frost damage , as no drainage is present , remedial needs and has a bow .
deep cracks in individual stones bear witness to the damage caused by weather , but the wall is not at present at risk of collapse .
a firm wall is a prerequisite for a school yard that students use , which is guaranteed by the current fixing works .
the school court renovation was originally already in use in 2008-2009 , but high unplanned expenditure was not a good idea .
an important word in the history of school building renovation , which has even been used for film shots , is the landeslandmalamt .
if you have any suggestions from this site , the city of bräunlingen hopes to receive grants from the conservation authorities .
the students of the bräunlinger elementary school , who have now returned to a well renovated old school building with new aula , can soon find the old school yard .
özdemir wants to train jazz in stuttgart .
the ongoing discussions on the future of music universities in baden-württemberg have now also focused on cem özdemir , federal chairman of the greens .
&quot; i think it is wrong to call holistic education at the musikhochschule stuttgart , &quot; said özdemir the &quot; stuttgart news &quot; .
jazz and classical music are part of the festival at the jazz location in stuttgart .
this is contrary to what özdemir , who was the favorite of a direct mandate from the bundestag in stuttgart on 22 september , was the green red provincial government .
this will push forward , on the basis of an expert study , a reorganization of the five music colleges in baden-württemberg .
the study programme is to be conducted by jazz and pop from the musikhochschule stuttgart to the musikhochschule mannheim .
us border : &quot; super tunnel &quot; to smuggling discovered drugs .
on the border between mexico and the us , investigators have found a &apos; super tunnel &apos; to smuggle drugs and decommission them .
as the us customs authorities have said , the more than 500 meter long tube between tijuana and san diego was equipped with electricity , rails and a bevilification system .
three suspects have therefore been arrested , eight tonnes of marijuana and almost 150 kilograms of cocaine .
the tunnel was still not in use , according to the information .
&quot; these cartels are stupid if they think they can be under the radar &quot; , said the director-general of the us district , somatern california , loua duffy .
the drug gangs are insured duffy : &quot; if you continue to build such tunnels and try to use them , we are determined to make that a huge waste of your dirty money .
both the us authorities and the mexican security forces are in a permanent struggle against drug cartels .
since 2006 , more than 77,000 people have been killed in mexico in connection with drug-related crime .
the new system is designed by experts and designed by experts .
due to the elaborate equipment of the tunnel , the investigators assume that he is being trained by architects and engineers .
the track system was equipped to allow electrical connections to the vehicle .
on the mexican side , there is access in a building that is 80 meters from the border .
according to the authorities , a ladder leads into the deep 20 meters to the actual tunnel entrance .
the tunnel has a cross section of 1.20 meters height and 90 centimeters width .
it would have been a suitable means of preventing illegal immigration towards the united states .
two of the suspects were arrested in connection with the cocaine fund .
the third , a mexican , was arrested for seized marijuana , and the government is now in a state of emergency .
all three are threatened with life-long deprivation of liberty , as officials have said .
since 2006 , eight such tunnels have been discovered , they have been said at the press conference in san diego .
but it is the first time that in such a tunnel building cocaine has been found .
cocaine is usually produced in smaller quantities and not through tunnels .
this shows the &quot; desperation &quot; of drug gangs whose traditional routes have now been cut off , bill sherman said of the drug flag .
they would do everything to go to the us .
the detainees have not been given any details , at least one is mexican , they have been told .
they must be punished with prison sentences of up to ten years .
in 2014 , the geisinger festival will be held in 2014 , the geisinger festival of the year 2014 .
the anniversary of the city of geisingen on the occasion of the 1250 .
the first documentary mention of the town is getting closer .
if , in just over eight weeks , the end of the year is over , the anniversary year will be upon us .
goddess and church houses were built for the first time in 794 together .
in churches a certificate was produced , in which both places are mentioned .
on 15 march there will be an official start to the anniversary year , and since there are scourges currently no hall , this show takes place .
during the anniversary , several important events have been organized in the area of geisingen and kirchen-hausen .
kirchen-hausen will be hosting a festival weekend from july 18th to 20th , the 1250 .
celebrating the return of life
on friday with a ceremony , on saturday and sunday with a party around the church hall .
on this weekend of the festival , the church house of the saints is also open .
director of the city music of rudolf barth has presented for the city a contract composition for the anniversary which will be published on three dates .
on 21 june , together with the sunday celebration of the black forest association , on 12 july at the arena with fireworks and on 13 december as the first concert of urban music in the new festival hall .
this will be the final year of the anniversary and will be the official date of the last weekend of september , 27 and 27 .
on the occasion of the geisinger city anniversary , a new chronicle will be released .
&quot; but it should not only be a chronicle of the spirits themselves , but a printed work about the spiritual scourge of today , which is precisely due to sings , church houses , copper works , aulls , aulls , and aulls .
and the scourge of today also celebrates 2014 birthday , 1974 was the present space with the communitizations .
the new chronicle will be released on 21 or 22 november in the new festhalle in geisingen .
in 2014 , however , there will be many anniversaries .
the narrative of straw glonki starts on february 8 with a night of worship on the occasion of its 60-year existence , the harmony gutmadingen will be 90 years and has opened the festival banquet and celebration on march 29 and 4 .
altenwerk leipferdingen is 40 years old , the geisinger school has been in the new location for 50 years and celebrates this on 10 may , the musikverein polyhymnia leipferdingen is 150 years old and celebrates it .
the city of geisingen was founded in a gift certificate owned by the monastery of st. gallen in the year 764 .
the document was written in churches ( hausen ) , which was then court place .
both communities are therefore in the same document .
the city of kazakhstan is the largest city in the world , and is the largest city in the country .
the council is targeting rail systems , which are not only in the field of rail but also in the field of rail systems .
if the railway crossing is to be laboriously converted , the railway pass &quot; am hirschen &quot; will be extended to increase road safety ?
yes , have the local councils decided .
schiltach must pay eur 220 000 for this .
deutsche bahn wants to introduce the kinzigtal railway line next year .
the aim is to ensure the safety of railway crossings in particular - there are regular collisions between trains and other vehicles across germany .
do the communities agree with the restructuring measures , they must comply with the costs of a third , the rest share the railways and the covenant .
schiltach ’ s mayor roland grießhaber explained to the municipal council the special features of the bahübergang &quot; am hirschen &quot; .
the city plans to build a new tunnel in the area , which is located west of the railway track .
larger vehicles could also be built there , such as long-timber vehicles , with counter-traffic without having to block the tracks .
greek cypriot suggested that a necessary wall of support be constructed in such a way that the city would not be able to open the road that followed in due course to ensure a smooth flow of traffic .
this was discussed in the municipal council , because some councils have not yet fully understood the need for road distribution : thomas kipp expressed the sentiment of critics to the point : &apos; do we have to pay so much money in so few vehicles ?
mayor thomas haas disagreed : the railway crossing &quot; hirschen &quot; is regularly used for long-wood transports .
even wood from the area &quot; kuhbach &quot; is partially transported over this route because the up to 20 meters long vehicles will be the route along the häberlesbrücke bridge because they are not going to take the main road .
in addition , the route served as a redirection for those vehicles that do not use the tunnel when the main road is closed .
it should be foreseen that kirchberg and schlossbergtunnel will be rebuilt and renovated , as is currently the case in wolfach , so that the railway pass on &quot; am &quot; can be used for a longer period .
the councils agreed to allow an investigation into the costs of the intended extension of the road , and the council agreed to do so .
nevertheless , the reconstruction of the railway transition has been approved by a majority with the requirement that the necessary support wall be built in such a way that the city can take the subsequent road towards &quot; bahnhofstrasse &quot; where appropriate for encounters traffic .
the reconstruction of the railway crossing at gerberi trautwein could , however , pose a quite different problem , which would have prevented access to the rapidly rising &quot; geroltz houses &quot; .
the administration had announced the railway plans of the engineering office breinlinger , since they had doubts about the availability of the planned connection to the geroltz building by way , and would then be possible without further ado .
the investigation concluded that not enough was to be ruled out that the tightening conditions of the road could lead to longer vehicles being put on .
the responsibility for this , in turn , lies with the city as a road construction loader .
the reconstruction could therefore be subject to liability disputes .
since the logging and the bending of the current extension are working , the system should be adapted to the reconstruction of the railway crossing .
it is also worth mentioning the risk of a collision of the train with a passing vehicle significantly lower than the other rail passes , because the train itself is directly next to the center .
even trains from the main station would have to be stopped at this point to the point that no collision threatens .
the majority of the building was devoted to the transformation of this railway transition , as the city of schiltach had to deal with the problem of recalling vehicles , according to the councils , as the railway was closed .
the hotel is not problematic to consider the changes on the railway passes &quot; before heubach &quot; and &quot; before cohbach &quot; , for which kreuzungsverbindung has already been concluded with the railway .
esa decides on major space missions : missions for billions of dollars , billions of dollars , dollars , dollars , dollars , and billions of dollars , dollars , and dollars , and dollars , and dollars , and dollars .
remote planets , gravity waves or black holes - experts from the european space agency have been asked to look at two major projects .
thirty proposals were on the table , five are still in the race .
remote worlds .
more than 1000 planets in other stars have already found astronomers .
whether it is at least alive on some of them , nobody knows .
the choice is difficult : if you want to search for gravity waves ?
or rather the origin of the cosmos explore ?
or to earth like planets , and thus perhaps aliens to discover life ?
these are the questions that the european space agency &apos;s leaders are asking themselves .
for your cosmic vision program , look for ideas for two major space projects that will support research significantly .
the budget for such &quot; l-missions &quot; is approximately one billion euros each .
the start is expected to be in 2028 and 2034 .
at the beginning of september , the elite of the european space research community met in paris to discuss proposals for such missions .
thirty ideas were discussed , five of them now being put to the close vote .
many bodies have assessed the proposals , hooks to researchers .
in the next few days , a final decision will be taken by the scientific programme committee .
there are four major questions that the esa has chosen , which will be the focus of the missions of the cosmic vision programme , which was launched in 2007 .
what are the conditions for the creation of planets and lives ?
the exact procedure of the creation of stars from large gas clouds - and thus also the emergence of planets that make these stars circle - is always in the spell of the dark sky .
a large infrared telescope in space could illuminate this dark .
and if a star has a planet , under what circumstances can live there ?
to look into this issue , the space telescope will be named &quot; cheops &quot; in 2017 , with which 500 already known planets systems will be installed in our vicinity .
the possibilities are limited , however , cheops is a small mission with a budget of eur 150 million .
with greater instruments , astronomers could discern earth like planets , and even analyze the composition of their atmospheres , searching for &quot; biomarkers &quot; : gases that are considered to be an indication of biological activity .
how does the solar system work ?
this issue , too , is ultimately to give an indication of the conditions that exist for the creation of life .
the magnitude of a star &apos;s magnetic activity and the interaction of its magnetic field , as well as the effect of particle radiation , are important factors .
in our solar system , these processes can be exemplary .
the solar orbiter has been designed to provide the european union with a m class mission ( which is where the budget is about half a billion euros ) for this issue .
the probe is to start and surface and activity of the sun closely observe in 2017 .
of great interest to researchers are also jupiter and his moon .
you want to find out what role giant planet plays in the development of the solar system .
the esa sees this as the first of the three l missions of the &quot; cosmic vision &quot; programme .
the probe &quot; juice &quot; ( jupiter icy moons explorer ) starts its journey probably in 2022 .
eight years later , jupiter is supposed to rediscover the atmosphere of the planet and the icy moons of europe , kallisto and ganymed .
what are the basic physical laws of the universe ?
the space offers many possibilities to find material under extreme conditions .
there may also be some deviations that point the way to a new theory for physicists , under whose roof all known natural laws can be united .
what was the universe of the universe and what is it ?
eur 13.7 billion ago , our cosmos was born by the big bang .
in addition to the material we know from the stars , planets and living beings as we are , there are dark matter .
so far , researchers have not yet known what physical laws were in the first fraction of the hurricane .
with &quot; euclid &quot; esa has already launched an m-mission here , whose launch is planned for 2020 .
with a special telescope , the probe is supposed to determine the distribution of matter in the universe for the first time , thus drawing conclusions about the nature of dark matter .
if you could run the race , you can get a chance to win .
of the 30 proposals , the commission only has two left at the end of the selection process .
the best chances of obtaining an l-mission are , according to many experts , &quot; e-lisa &quot; , a challenging concept for verifying gravitational waves .
physicists understand changes in the structure of spatial time , which albert einstein predicted almost 100 years ago .
they have not been proven to date .
elisa could do that , the scientists hope behind the project .
the mission envisages a two-thirds probes detector that will be installed in space .
it could be used as a gravity , unlike plants on earth .
four other proposals are still competing for the second l-mission : a large x-ray telescope called &quot; athena &quot; , which is used , among other things , to explore black holes , &quot; icy planets &quot; , another .
already retired are proposals for proving the rear transport from mars , for exploring the mond , veins and amortization .
snowden ready to work with germany on us surveillance , and to do so in the us .
edward snowden , the whistleblower of the us intelligence service , has said that he is ready to travel to berlin and to appear before the german bundestag when the american national security agency is in power and its headquarters .
the german member , hans-christian ströbele , met snowden in russia on thursday , where this asylum was granted , in order to make it possible to discuss the situation in germany with him .
in a letter from snowden , which was sent on friday by ströbel to the media in berlin , he writes : “ even if the outcome of my efforts was demonstrably positive , my government is treating a dissent as a continue view .
to tell the truth is not a crime .
in the letter , snowden writes that he is convinced that the support of the international community will convince the american government to stop the charges against him .
the security council , which is charged by the us department of justice , includes espionage and theft of state property .
german interior minister hans-peter friedrich said to zeit online : “ if mr snowden is prepared to meet german representatives , then we will find ways to do that . ”
relations between the us and germany are characterised by claims that the nsa has not yet fully understood the mobile phone of chancellor angela merkel .
thomas oppermann , the member who has been appointed to the secretariat of the parliamentary committee responsible , said that we should seize the opportunity to listen to snowden as a witness , if possible , to ‘ risk without him and to jeopardize relations ’ .
ströbele , a member of the greens , published a picture of himself and snowden in his twitter feed .
he was arrested by two german journalists when he visited russia .
ströbel explained that according to the lawyer of the former nsa employee snowden did not return to russia , if he had visited the country .
if snowden in germany testifies , then he needs an assurance that he will be “ safe ” there , as the honourable member said .
snowden states in his letter that he is committed to “ serious and ongoing ” pursuit campaign .
however , it is touched by the worldwide response to “ my act of political expression . ”
citizens all over the world , as well as senior politicians – including in the united states – have been deeply shocked by the revelations about an uncontrolled system of comprehensive surveillance .
in his letter , snowden makes a proposal to the german authorities of cooperation “ if the difficulties surrounding the humanitarian situation have been resolved ” .
frontier airlines charges a fee for hand baggage allowances , which is a charge for hand baggage allowances for baggage that is not included in the price of the baggage .
frontier airlines plans to supply up to usd 100 from passengers who have already paid for their flight .
frontier airlines intends to supply up to usd 100 for a piece of hand baggage and usd 2 for coffee or lemonade , even if the announcement does not mention the same in the announcement on wednesday that passengers will be leaving the whole dock .
the new fee applies to hand baggage in the luggage compartment above the seat , small bags under the seat are still free .
frontier explained that it is calculated to be 25 us dollars if the fee is paid in advance , and 100 u.s. dollars for travellers who arrive at the gate .
front-line speaker kate o &apos;malley said the fee of 100 u.s. dollars aims to make travellers pay more than they would expect .
“ we don ’ t want to calculate this amount , ” she explained .
airlines began to pay for the first and second issued passenger baggage in 2008 , and the airline was able to do so .
passengers who tried to use them were forced to leave so much of the handbag as possible .
fees are one way of encouraging passengers to travel less on board .
o &apos;malley said that the new fee is not really about getting money .
it concerns the most loyal customers of frontier , who have clearly stated that there are always more difficult to find room in the compartment above the seat .
passengers who wish to purchase their tickets on the airline website do not have to pay .
this means that a passenger is not allowed to travel to the airport at the gate of frontier , which is the next person for a flight of 100 dollars for a similar item of baggage .
o &apos;malley explained the site of frontier and the check-in procedures would be changed so the passengers can be informed about the fee that is paid before they arrive at the gate .
the new frontier handling fee will not enter into force until the summer , and the exact date is not yet available .
passengers are often stranded by baggage allowances and other charges , but airlines like to resort to this .
they argue that transport of luggage is money , and that passengers are not entitled to pay for this service if they so wish .
many on wall street view the new baggage charges as a sign that the airlines are taking enough money to pay for the aircraft after years of losses .
most , however , have so far been pointing the finger at charges for hand luggage .
spirit airlines inc. requested a new a320 family aircraft three years ago .
the only other airline with such a charge is the hungarian wizz air , the airline-consultant jay sorensen , who has paid the extra charges attentively .
he estimated in a report of december 2011 that the handling charge spirit will cost eur 50 million per year .
sorensen , who was previously a leading player at midwest airlines , is now a leading airline in europe .
“ the boarding process was one of the smooth processes of the company that i have been able to follow in my career in aviation , ” he said .
i expected to be teeth cracking and tangible discussions on the gate , but i am not sure if i am going to be able to see the next flight .
“ the plane was full , ” he explained , “ and boarding was as lubricated . ”
frontier also follows spirit at the 2 dollars spent on coffee , tea , lemonade or juice .
the company explained that passengers travelling to the limone or juice could not travel the whole can .
water is still free .
we airways had briefly tried to provide refreshment drinks in 2008 , but made this a matter of seven months later .
frontier &apos;s step to charge for hand baggage when passengers are not travelling directly to the airline is a step in the recent initiative to deal with customers at their own website .
airlines pay online travel agencies such as orbitz 10 to 25 us dollars per ticket sold .
this provides an incentive for all companies to encourage passengers to buy directly from them rather than via an online travel agency .
frontier is , however , the furthest area in this area .
in september , the company began to make reservations through an online travel agency only half as many frequent flyer miles when booking .
on wednesday , the mileage was reduced to 25 percent of the route .
a third party booking confirmation is required .
passengers can also only buy from the website of frontier places when buying directly .
frontier has a loyal customer base at its headquarters in denver , but the business is shrinking and the company is losing money .
the proceeds were reduced by 9 % and the flight capacity contracted by just under 13 % in the first quarter , as stated in the financial report published on wednesday .
republic has tried to make a profit in the context of the sale of the company , and to get the finances of frontier under control .
proverbs come from the bible
more than 40 women attended this year ’ s last women ’ s breakfast in the evangelical church of bisingen .
the theme of the day in the municipal house were &quot; proverbs from the bible &quot; and &quot; medieval phrases &quot; .
zita köhler , the chairman of the church council , went to the church council after breakfast in a lecture on the biblical proverbs .
&quot; proverbs contain lifestyles , rules , or warnings , &quot; she explained .
she compared several proverbs with the corresponding biblical places and explained the meaning .
she called proverbs like : catch a guard , keep a guard , as scales fall from the eyes , an eye on someone who gives his own , the lord in sleep , his hands in unfault .
the referenda have repeatedly let their listeners advise what kind of saying it is .
the words of the middle ages took the church community movement to the heart of the city , and the church was the first to be mentioned by the church .
it explained the meaning and origin of the words that they used to call &quot; bridges to the past &quot; .
in conclusion , a raffle was lost .
the prices were covered on a table and were humorously rewritten before they were sold to the winners .
among the visitors of the breakfast round , there was also mayor roman wailey , who was the mayor of the city .
learning instead of being unemployed : pilot project for unskilled tourism in the tourism industry .
the mecklenburg lake district is home to the most famous and famous lake district in europe .
under the leadership of the federal employment agency , 49 women and men who have already been recognised as unskilled in the industry are to be skilled workers for hotels and restaurants over three winter periods .
&quot; what is new is that the six-month courses with degrees end &quot; , said carmen wiechert of the employers &apos; agency .
the benefits are many : the participants would not be unemployed , the firms would be trained to work , the people would become more and more involved in hotels and restaurants , and the agency would not have to finance unemployment .
the project also includes industrial and commercial chambers in neubrandenburg and the german hotel and management board in berlin .
nsa explains that an “ internal error ” and not hackers are guilty of the crash of the site &apos;s website crash and not hackers are guilty of the crash of the site &apos;s website .
the shadow national security agency declared on 23 december last that a mistake occurred in public website some hours lahti and not hazard as online claims .
“ nsa.gov was a few hours away from the hotel , because during a planned update an internal error occurred ” , explains mr. gov .
the problem will be fixed this evening .
the claim that failure is caused by a distributed denial of service is not justified .
in the early hours of the evening , online server trackers noticed that the nsa website had at least six hours of unavailable access and this was still not possible for some users .
previously , a nsa speaker had been told to abc news that the eu ’ s sensitive internal network was “ in no way compromised . ”
secret information is not in danger , the speaker said .
at least one group of hacktists claimed to have the nsa website with a ddos attack .
in the event of such attacks , the target site will be flooded with page views until the server is overloaded and the website collapses .
cybertactics are relatively simple , and attacks are not designed to interfere with the target system &apos;s internal network .
the former super-secret nsa , whose nickname was once no such agency ( no such authority ) , is now in the bright light of the public and is looking for the information that has been made known in recent months .
the growing controversy over the secret service fueled initial speculation about the possibility of the incident being the result of a targeted cyper operation .
slightly falling is the number of people without jobs in october at 22 to 1,307 .
although the 3.1 % quota was better than last year , and even better than in september , &apos; we would have liked to see more &apos; , monika felder says .
many businesses have reacted to attitudes .
one reason for this is , according to felder bauer : &quot; we have few skilled workers in the craft sector , in health care and in care of the elderly &quot; .
the annual schedule of the year is also being extended to include vacancies for hotel and restaurant personnel since september .
in mid-december the winter season begins there .

loss of profits in bombardier following decline in supply and orders , and the loss of jobs in the region , are a major factor in the global economy .
the canadian aircraft and railway manufacturers bombardier inc reported on the first 15-percent increase in the aircraft network on thursday .
bombardier , based in montreal , did not publish flight test data for its brand new aircraft of the cseries , nor did it provide any new information on whether the aircraft was flying according to the ambitious schedule in september .
on the test aircraft ’ s maiden flight a month and a half ago , only three more flights have been launched , which makes it questionable whether the test phase is going as planned .
the results remained behind the forecasts and led to a price drop of eur 28.5 billion in the 2008 toronto stock market .
cameron doerksen , analyst at national bank financial , reduced sales by $ 1.9 billion on thursday .
“ while weaker delivery numbers for aircraft have been largely expected , the us navy ’ s marginal development has been clearly disappointing , ” said doerksen in a customer letter .
we believe that bombardier should be placing new orders for the cseries if the test program for the aircraft is moving forward .
however , if no new orders are announced in the coming months , we expect the market to follow the program with more scepticism .
bombardier hopes that the air travel of the cseries will make the company into the lower market segment of katapultien , which is currently being developed by boeing and airbus .
the first test aircraft was presented to the public in march and flew to the market for the first time in september after months of delays .
but , until now , binding orders for the cseries have been moderate with 177 , as potential buyers can wait for the results of the flight tests and see if the company ’ s claims regarding fuel efficiency and cost saving potential of the new jet are correct .
there are currently 403 orders and commitments from 15 customers and companies .
ceo pierre beaudoin is confident that the bombarddier will achieve his goal of 300 binding orders at the beginning of commercial use of the jet .
the company management confirmed to analysts and media on thursday that the programme was in the schedule .
“ the test aircraft is no longer on the ground than expected , ” said beaudoin at a phone conference and added , while the service life of the aircraft was ground tests and software updates .
each manufacturer is planning a different way .
we have decided to take a first flight and then to start a review period , which we have also done .
this is done throughout the flight programme .
the second of five test aircraft is expected to be launched in the next few weeks , the rest shortly afterwards , it was said from the corporate side .
yet analysts remain sceptical about whether 12 months after the maiden flight , the first customer will launch a cseries aircraft .
bombardier said it is checking the planning for the commissioning ( ice ) and will publish it in the coming months .
“ slow progress in air test – even if it is obviously bombardier ’ s internal planning – reinforces our view that the world ’ s launch should be limited to the first quarter of 2015 , ” said doerkerkert .
in the third quarter , at the end of september 30 , bombardier ’ s net profit fell to $ 147 million , or $ 8 cents per share , respectively , from $ 172 million , or 9 cents per share a year earlier .
the adjusted profit per share is unchanged at 9 cents .
sales were slightly lower and fell by 3.5 % to € 4.3 billion ( year-end 2005 : $ 4.1 billion ) .
analysts had a profit of 10 cents per share and a turnover of 4.56 billion dollars , according to thomson reuters i / b / e / s .
the world ’ s fourth largest aircraft manufacturer claims that it has delivered 45 aircraft this quarter , a decline of 5.7 % last year .
net orders fell from 83 aircraft to 26.9 .
the order book in the aerospace division stood at € 39.9 billion on 30 september and was thus slightly lower than december 31 .
“ in the aerospace sector , the results were achieved within our guidelines , but the low intake of orders and overall market conditions were disappointing , ” said beaudoin .
sales in the aerospace sector were up by € 13 percent to € 2 billion .
bombardier , the world ’ s largest railway manufacturer , announced that sales in this sector were down by nearly 11 percent to $ 2.1 billion .
the order book in the transport division stood at € 32.6 billion on 30 september , and thus slightly increased compared to december 31 .
the profit margin in the transport sector has been reduced by processing problems in some major contracts .
according to the management , it will be possible to set new targets for the fourth quarter .
in the afternoon trading on thursday the bombardier share increased by 8.5 percent and was 4.5 percent .
the brazilian embraer sa , the world ’ s third largest commercial aircraft manufacturer and bombardier of the closest rival , reported a ten-percent decline in q4 sales on thursday .

cocaine addict , the drug boss in front of police investigation warned , must be imprisoned .
basharat ditta , 42 , gave information on subworld size neil scarborough .
the lawyer was afraid to use his secret drug addiction .
he was arrested by the crown court of liverpool to three years in prison .
a well-known criminal defender who has a drug baron in front of a major police investigation because he was afraid to use his secret drug addiction could be discovered , has been sentenced to three years in prison .
basharat ditta , 42 , supplied subworld size neil scarborough with sensitive information about erasmus to investigate its activities in drug trafficking after being replaced by its own cocaine addiction .
the war that criminalists call “ first-class . ”
officials observed how scarborough ( 32 ) had three bags of cocaine on the house of the lawyer in blackburn , lancashire , absentee , while this was with colleagues at a dinner the evening .
the investigation revealed that the dit &apos;pol regularly uses drugs of class a , which had been tested to detect traces of cocaine in his hair , on his wallet and on credit cards .
over a period of eight months between january and august 2011 , he tried to gather unauthorized information about the arrest of two men on behalf of scarborough and one of his partners .
all four suspects were then arrested by the police in a major investigation into the heroin and coca cola trade in lancashire , cumbria , merseyside , berkshire and west yorkshire .
together with 32 other people , they were later arrested after the police had been arrested in a number of house searches heroin and cocaine worth £ 1.5 million and pounds 200,000 of cash .
ditta , 42 , gave information to the criminals because he feared that his drug addiction could be publicized .
today ditta , who is responsible for forbes solicitors ’ law firm in blackburn , was born at liverpool crown court after a three-week period of work in two charges .
he said at an earlier survey that the cocaine ownership was in place .
the lawyer was transferred after the police had been arrested in their investigations against scarborough .
two investigators followed the prosecution and the saddam hussein &apos;s execution .
shortly after he had delivered the drugs , scarborough regularly telephoned with ditta , who was in the football stadium at blackburn rovers at ewood park for dinner .
the lawyer returned home , picking up the drugs and then being released nine communications between the two trained and trained .
the court of justice has been informed that ditta is a “ regular consumer ” of cocaine after tests of the class a drugs have been found in his hair , his wallet and on his credit cards .
ditta was later arrested , but denied , cocaine was taken and said he had been working with the alleged dealer , because he had lost his client .
during his arrest , ditta took his wallet and tried to make a number of credit cards removed , but they were secured and he was given a hair sample .
in the case of police interrogation , he stated that he was operating under his private address as well as at the workplace , and that clients would be leaving him at home for legal matters .
the court of justice has been informed that it has been able to identify important actors in the drug trade , some of which he had represented previously , following significant arrests and informed what the investigators knew about them .
prosecutor anne whyte said : “ a criminal prosecutor should be better than any other , that he is not allowed to break the law . ”
ditta will not be held liable for abuse of his position as a criminal defender , because he is too much involved with certain clients .
the relationship in question is not simply that of a drug dealer , but of a drug dealer who has his advocates supplied with drugs .
some of his communications were undoubtedly legitimate , because he was the advocate of these people .
but that went far beyond the bounds of a normal relationship between lawyer and client .
he was the chief prosecutor of the police , so that they could continue to investigate their criminal activities .
mr ditta brought his profession into disrepute .
he was available to certain clients , particularly scarborough , and he left it to be his own independence compromised .
ditta dismissed any misconduct and claimed that “ if i am a corrupt lawyer , what i do not , and information to scarborough would be passed on , i would be unable to spend 15 hours waiting , ”
but , after the hearing , superintendent lee halstead said from the police in lancashire : “ mr ditta took the step from a criminal defender to a criminal at the moment he started to attack .
its cocaine dependence led to a hopeless compromises and made it vulnerable to the motives of leading members of organised crime , who appointed him to provide valuable information on police investigation .
lawyers must have the highest standards of integrity and be able to stand up for trust and confidence in the public .
ditta has lost that trust and has tried to hide behind the facade of his profession .
the serious and organized crime unit of lancashire leaned the investigation into the disability of ditta , which also led to a conviction in three cases on account of the possession of cocaine and the disability of justice .
this case should give a warning to criminals and show that no one is in the arm of the law .
we find them and bring them to justice .
scarborough himself was sentenced to 14 years in prison after he had been accused of conspiring to the heroin , cocaine and cannabis trade .
thirty-five more people involved in drug trafficking were sentenced to total penalties of 153 years for drug offences .
on his website ditta published a section with questions and answers about himself in which he said his dream job was to be to be considered a lawyer .
revolutionary work of the church music
at the end of the celebrations on the occasion of its 160-year existence , the song crane dunningen will perform two services with the &quot; deutsche messe &quot; by franz schubert .
after the great success of the musicals &quot; rock my life &quot; , which the spectators will be delighted to hear this spring , the song crane will be ready for the anniversary year .
on saturday , 26 october , this extraordinary exhibition will be held from 19 during the evening fair in the st. martinskirche dunningen and on sunday 27 october , from 10 : 15 am at the gottesdienst in .
the so-called deutsche messe , with its original title &quot; singing for the celebration of the holy sacrifice of the fair &quot; , d 872 , is a spiritual music work of the composer franz schubert , who was born in 1826 .
the fair will take place within the framework of the services , as the client johann philipp neumann had in mind .
under the direction of hermann schneider , the choir is led by the brass group of the music association frehsinn tennenbronn and noemi lokodi at the organ .
haslach : skepticism is increasingly dim in confidence .
the elections to the parish council in 2015 will , for example , have a positive effect on the situation in the haslach ( se ) seafaring unit .
there is only one common parish church council for all six parish groups .
in a joint meeting , on saturday the committees of haslach , hofstetten , mühlenbach , fischerbach , steinach and welschensteinach prepared for the changes .
the fundamental decisions of the diocese are not in doubt .
during the day it became particularly clear : skepticism about the new is slowly but tentatively becoming a confident one .
from the ideas and expectations of the innovations in 2015 to concrete proposals on the future composition and size of the parish church council , the commission &apos;s extremely constructive discussions were enough .
georg schmitt regional dean explained the current state of the art and the new rules for seafaring units in the archdiocese of freiburg .
after that , the se haslach as a church community will form a public law body that will be fully integrated into the rights and obligations of the six individual church communities to date .
there will only be a common parish council and a foundation council .
from each parish , at least two elected members should be represented , in the six parish churches , so called commonwealth teams are formed .
your task in future will be to protect church life in the village .
when it comes to the finances of the individual parish , there was a great need for discussion .
the innovations provide that collected data can be used in the pparish realms .
liabilities , on the other hand , go to the entire municipality .
in view of the large planned investments , which all pfarries will then be obliged to make , there were major concerns .
&quot; in the past , only investment was made in projects that were approved by the individual parishes alone .
practical experience with a joint body for five parish ceremonies described barbarar ritter , the chairman of the committee in the seafaring unit of the schutterwald neurged .
they had committed themselves to becoming one in 2006 , five remaining in 2006 , and found that it was not that easy .
the haslacher seafarers ’ council bodies then sought to answer questions about the future composition and size of the common parish council and the practical work of the community teams .
the preparation will be more concrete in further meetings and will be discussed in another joint meeting of all six bodies next spring .
in the end , parish council michael schöner of steinach presented the new logo of the seaside unit , which was approved by a clear majority .
in pfullendorf the electricity is more expensive than the electricity produced in the city .
the citizens of pfullendorf must be prepared for higher electricity costs .
as the managing director of the stadtwerke , jörg-arne bias , confirmed to the south kurier , a four-headed poulendorfer family of 70 to 90 euros add extra costs per year .
the main reason for the price increase that is due is the rise in the so-called ec levy of 5.277 to 6.3 cents per kilowatt-hour .
this levy is paid every october by the four operators of the major power tracks .
these figures , which are available to you from the turn of energy , are the additional costs that you will have to pay via a levy on electricity prices .
the city ’ s pflullendorf ( city works ) are the last link in this chain .
the supervisory board of the energy company was even convinced in its forecasts of a higher levy , as jörg-arne bias reports .
now the actual figures should be calculated before the city centres are able to inform their customers next week about the exact price increase .
&quot; we are starting from an increase of 1 cent plus x , &quot; says bias , with the number more near the 2 cents .
traffic lights on forever red : look for waiting time .
sometimes a traffic light is simply not green .
the contact loop in the street does not react , or the light sign is broken .
what should be done then - drive on red ?
if a person has been affected long enough at a red light and the intersection is free , he can continue , the stutgarter rechtsanwalt ralf becker explains in the magazine &quot; motorrad &quot; .
the waiting time must be &apos; reasonable &apos; , which is to be different from one case to another .
becker advises that at least five minutes before a function interference of the traffic lights is expected .
if you want to continue the journey despite red light , you must be aware that the journey is not suitable for a loss of life caused by it .
if you have not tolerated less than five minutes , you may not wait long enough , becker warns and refers to a decision by the hamm supreme court .
the case under discussion was followed by a driver who had to leave the traffic lights for about three minutes and had to decide to take a careless offence in red light .
the traffic lights were not broken , but jumped little later on on green to get around .
a driving ban was not imposed on him because of the special situation - but the fine is not .
the municipal council is pleased to have a solid budget and a strong budget .
whenever there is a problem in town councils with the budget , mayor ralph gerster laughs well .
the parish bag in herdwangen-schönach is well filled and debt management has not been familiar with since 2005 .
the 2012 budget year can also be seen as a complete success in this respect .
this was confirmed when the annual accounts for 2012 were presented .
as andrea rothmund explained , the administrative budget is around 7.6 million euros over a million euros .
the surplus of the administrative budget is also around 1.8 million euros , which is around eur 1 million above the approach .
it is thanks to the surplus , above all , of higher business tax revenue and the municipal share of income tax .
the budget was also significantly above the planned values .
instead of the eur 1.5 million envisaged , last year it was eur 2.5 million .
&quot; this is mainly due to the higher intake from the administrative budget &quot; , says rothmund .
since the 2012 budget year will have less investment than planned , it is also necessary to increase the return on the goods .
overall , the overall reserve was reduced by around eur 2.1 million to a total of eur 4.9 million .
mayor ralph gerster thanked rothmund and her team for the good work they have done .
&quot; such a work is not shaking out of the sleeve , &quot; gerster praised gerster with regard to the annual accounts .
he and the municipal councils were visibly delighted with the good figures .
it may sound paradoxical , but it is precisely these good figures that could soon cost the citizens dear .
the good financial situation has enabled the community to react to high leverage in the past .
but this , in turn , has often meant that subsidies have been cut off from the country , according to gerster .
the commission has proposed a eur 1.7 billion budget for these subsidies from various offsets .
cities and municipalities that are eligible for subsidies must , among other things , be able to offer certain levers .
&quot; the subject of rebels we have to look at , because investment is due in the coming years , for which we would like to have subsidies , &quot; gerster announced in this context .
nagold : hugo wermter has been in the choir for 60 years in the choir for the choir of the choir for 60 years .
with 60 years as a singer , hubert wermter ’ s story is a success at the male singing club caecilia almost twice as long as that of the autumn festival in which he was honoured .
hubert wermter was as usual in the colors of his male vocalist club on stage .
even after 60 years , singing with the now more than loved one makes him a true singer .
in the association , wermter was also active for 28 years as a member of the committee .
for his commitment and his loyalty , he received several awards : jörg kohr , pastoral lecturer on behalf of the cäcilienverband rottenburg-stuttgart , transposed him to the public .
his singers presented him the judgement of the german choir association and a tomb of the artist ’ s choir .
besides the honor , the 31st autumn festival took place in usual tracks : with the mgv betra , the song crane salzstetten , the singer department baisingen and the local jazz club .
the mgv full-marinage opened its doors with atmospheric songs such as &quot; im weinparadies &quot; and &quot; funny , her brothers &quot; .
your honorary singer hubert wermter prepared a book for the honour of being a little boy - wolfgang amadeus mozart &apos;s &quot; bundeslied-lied &quot; .
the male singing association betra sang classical choir songs as well as &quot; jägerwerben &quot; by julius wengert , &quot; far , far away &quot; by hubert goisern and the folk song &quot; .
the song crane salzstetten with its mixed choir and its female group - the &quot; impulse &quot; - provided the voice for the festival ’ s female quota .
the mixed choir kidnapped the neapolitan folk &quot; santa lucia &quot; and &quot; eviva espana &quot; from antos gus in foreign languages .
the singer department of the bailiff sports club came together with &quot; what isch der schwoben ? &quot; by hans soussmuth and robert papperts &quot; beerlied &quot; back to home filmed .
the children were given a small secondary programme - &quot; oma hanne &quot; alias hannelore stollsteimer led a kasperltheater and read a few stories that the children had to read about good lunches .

kenyan press outraged controversial media law .
“ we are in a frightening situation and we must ask ourselves : what does parliament think about the need to simply take the judicial independence tomorrow ?
“ the law is draconian and very penal and we refuse to do so , ” said cyrus kamau , managing director of the capital group , to which capital is also a member , one of the most respected radio stations .
he said that the new media tribunal “ will always be prejudiced , because it is an extended arm of the government ” , and restrictions on content and advertising would force kenya ’ s position in the global economy .
“ i hope the president listens to us and we appeal to him to reject this draft law and to send it back to parliament , ” he said .
according to the newspaper the star , the government is taking a more effective approach to the issue through the new law , “ the media effectively enters into a stranglehold . ”
the adoption of the law is part of a series of measures designed to improve national security in the wake of the armed conflict attacks .
the kenyan media attracted the authorities ’ anger because they were taking pictures of security cameras , where there was a need to see the people involved in the crime scene .
police chief david kimaiyo responded with the order of two journalists and one of the leading media representatives .
under the new law , media houses may be granted a fine of up to 20 million kenyan shillings and individual journalists may be sentenced to up to one million and the further risk of losing their professional recognition or being accredited by an official press .
the tribunal also has the right to refuse to confiscate the possession of the persons concerned if a penalty is not paid .
according to daily nation , “ only one punishment can transmit most radio stations to bankruptcy . ”
moreover , the newspaper considers that these measures could have a devastating effect on the “ living conditions of blogosphere ” of kenya .
if you want to silence the media , politicians could be incriminated , whatever they want .
“ no one will ever know , ” mutuma mathiu wrote , journalist at the nation , who had visited the kenyan media as a crucial factor in public life control .
“ leaving politicians to their own devices , they lead the country into bankruptcy and return us to the time of hunters and collectors , ” he commented .
kenyan legislators have been the public era in the past .
in may , they voted to remove the national remuneration commission ’ s cuts .
bad-dürrheim : a dream becomes true for the fc dürrheim .
the city and the football club of the city have been undermined by the official opening ceremony for the artificial turf sport , despite the cold weather and the rain .
a more pleasant party was on the last saturday all the people would have liked , but peter did not want to play with him .
so all those who had been looking for it without umbrella or for some reason had not kept it .
this was a great help to the musicians who framed the feast , as well as to many speakers .
wet was therefore also the fc chairman albrecht schlenker , who was talking about fulfilling a dream .
his thanks were primarily due to mayor walter klupp , who has worked for the implementation of the project , the municipal council , the participating companies and associations .
here lothar hero , paul weizenegger , heiner gail and peter graf .
the retired people who worked in the company moved 400 square metres of pavement stones for the new paths .
this remarkable volunteer commitment honoured the landtag mep karl rombach .
other greeting words were addressed to the municipal sports committee hubert baier , district chairman of the south baden football association , kuno kayan , and friedrich knorr from the planning office .
mayor klumpp reminded us that recurring weather conditions are affecting the spring of and autumn .
15 years ago , the first consideration was given to solving the problem when a third place was being built at the football club or at the real school at salinensee .
both have been dismissed again .
six years ago , thoughts came up about the creation of an artificial grass sport site , which is generally considered the ultimate solution .
concrete plans were launched two years ago , when the fc had closed the chabelstube in inheritance lease , a cost contribution of eur 100 000 for the construction of the place and the country received funding of eur 104 000 .
the municipal council decided to adopt the new municipal council in october 2012 , which will provide the remaining eur 356 000 in total costs of eur 560 000 , summarised klumpp .
the construction of the 68 mts 108 m artificial grass course started on 4 june .
during the three-month period of construction , 3000 cubic metres of ground were carried out , of which half were destined for the creation of a dirt-bike track .
the union and the spd have resumed their coalition negotiations with the issues of justice and home affairs .
the relevant working group was also present in berlin in the morning .
among other things , it is about direct democracy , the bribery of members and the federal police .
in the morning , the working group on migration and integration also wanted to continue its consultations .
among other things , this should be about dual citizenship , which is a subject on which both sides have conflicting ideas .
the spd wants to reduce the pressure on german immigrant children to take up a too low position .
on the subject of transport , which is not on the agenda this friday , the spd underpinned its rejection of a decision taken by the csu to lift the toll on cars .
a vignette is a &quot; flat rate for the multiplicity and thus counterproductive ecologically , &quot; explained the spd negotiator for the subject of transport , florian pronold , in a letter to his group .
there was the threat of eviction on land roads , which are already the main areas of accident .
the introduction of a toll on all cars would be a good idea from the pronolds point of view .
&quot; there is a danger that at a later date the compensation for german punitive workers will be cancelled , &quot; he said .

vienna airport provides passenger calls from the airport to the airport .
mr max maier , please come to gate 24 .
predictions like this will be made at vienna schwechat airport in the future .
most of the loudspeakers are not connected - the noise level is to be reduced so that the noise level is reduced .
a more relaxing atmosphere is the goal of this innovation .
as airport speaker peter kleemann said to radio vienna , the first international airport in vienna is the vienna airport , which has set up its own breakthroughs concerning individuals .
for example , airports in copenhagen , frankfurt or dubai already do not have the noise of calls .
the elimination of these breakthroughs - on average , one day , around 200 personal calls from the speakers will cause the volume to rise quieter in the future at the airport .
&quot; it has also been shown in experience that these individual breakthroughs are relatively unnoticed , but at the same time all other information on changed flight or departure times here is a bit undone &quot; , says kleemann in the book .
highlander games on the kaltenhof

milk and egg alternatives
vegan nutrition requires alternative vegetable eggs , milk and dairy products .
the room was very clean and the bathroom was very nice .
the other is the vegetarian heritage of world vegetation day on 1 november .
the vegetarian heritage germany proposes , on the occasion of world vegans on 1 november , a number of vegan alternatives :
pure plant margarine is a good alternative to butter , yoghurt leave by sojayoghurt .
instead of milk , soya , oats , almond or rice milk could be used .
break-out cream replaces conventional bucklecream .
there are also vegetable alternatives to eggs .
half a crushed , ripe banana , for example , can be used as a binding agent in a cake .
even 50 grams of apple or tablespoon ground , which is grilled , plus three tablespoons of water , are suitable for this .
loosely dough is made with egg , for example , with a mixture of a teaspoon baking powder , a tablespoon of starch and three tablespoons of mineral water .
but also 50 grams of soya yoghurt or silk stove can fulfil this purpose .

sleepless in new york
on the way to their host families in weymouth , massachusetts , the students of the black forest gymnastic learned the american metropolis new york .
after eight hours of flight , we went straight to brooklyn bridge , which was the heart of the city , manhattan , on foot .
this was a fascinating moment to see the world famous skyline , which was built in the evening light and which is a great attraction .
the time shift has left students almost 24 hours on their legs , but faithfully following the motto &quot; the city sleeps not &quot; , the day was decided at times square .
despite shutdown , the second day the statue of liberty was closed with a ferry and it was possible to walk .
then , it went on to cross the financial center around wall street to commemorate 11 september .
on the third day , students were able to benefit from the 373 meter high viewing platform of the empire state building .
then it went through the hectic pace of new york ’ s streets , through the rockefeller center to central park , which was an ideal opportunity to stay short in the autumn sun .
after a short flight from new york to boston , students have now returned to their host families and experience the weymouth high school in the school .
this year , the german association of the international community of the saints , hubertus , will again be present at the st. marien parish church on the hulsbergstraße .
st. hubertus was the legend after a rather ruthless hunter who was inspired by a vision and later became the bishop of liège .
the hunting horn group of hunting three westphalia under the direction of brigitte kluth is playing on parforcehörner ( nature horns in the mood it ) according to old french melodies .
the leaves wear riding clothes because they are mainly smooth and durable .
the festive fair will take place on sunday , november 3 , at 11.30 a.m.
the newly designed opp glitter with a new café .
one that is essential to stay and revisit .
one that is called the program .
as déjà vu , the term lexicon refers to a psychological phenomenon that is reflected in the feeling that a new situation has been experienced or seen before .
in the event of the visit of the café of the same name at the opschlag in the district town of kleve , within sight of the rhein-waal university , it is not necessary to remain at the pure déjà vu feeling .
finally , the café has exactly what it wants to do with its beautiful name : a real stay not only in mind but always in a comfortable way to experience again and again .
because it &apos;s fun and just great .
a look at the inner life at opschlag 8 gives the viewer a good feeling at first .
the ultra-modern , but not cool cafe ambience looks like a place to feel good .
the team will spoil you with the founders mirjam van der stet and daniel büttner at the top with a variety of coffee and cocktails .
there is also a delicious cake or freshly baked baguettes .
the owners , both 33 years old , have already registered themselves before the opening of the lovely cafe at the opschlag as a gastronomer : in kranenburg they led the &quot; art lounge &quot; .
from moving to kleve to opschlag , the sympathetic café-lovers of the village hope to see more audience .
not least by the university .
&quot; while we do not have a specific target group , &quot; says daniel büttner .
rather , the two students here would like to address young students in the same way as senior citizens and all age groups in between .
speaking of café-lovers .
the friendly owner &apos;s couple is behind the coffee table and the hotel is very well located .
enjoy the fragrant hot brew in the most varied variations .
expressos is a german language spoken by the french and german speaking community .
daniel büttner is more of a expresso fan and mirjam van der stelle the cappuccino drinker .
&quot; to add a baguette - that &apos;s my thing , &quot; she tells the nrz .
two events were already available in the bright café .
better , one .
the port festival took place outside - that is the café déjà vu , not benefiting from it .
but there was also the ringelnatz evening .
&quot; good , successful and funny &quot; , the two 33-year-olds found .
but not everyone &apos;s business .
perhaps daniel büttner is not a particularly enthusiastic fan of event abends. he is not able to say &quot; you can &apos;t all of them &quot; .
and i am always talking about the event that is also suitable for the special event .
that is why events will be the exception .
&quot; we want to keep the normal operation as little as possible &quot; .
this is to say : déjà vu also stands for reliability .
as regards the quality of the products offered here , as well as the team and the beautiful surroundings at the opschlave .
the road , which is becoming a gastronomic mile , is becoming a real highlight .
to the delight of many klever , who has guests from near and far and students who love the gastromile and thus the café déjà vu for themselves .

a day of thanks to mgv in dinker
it was the 165th festival of foundation to which the mgv &quot; friedrich wilhelm dinker &quot; was invited this year and 52 guests , active sänger and their spouses , were happy to come .

un announces new goals for poverty reduction in africa .
the united nations is now starting to draw up a series of new objectives that will help to implement the millennium development goals , which were announced 12 years ago , to combat poverty .
in the run-up to the un summit on sustainable development , which is to be held in rio de janeiro this evening , australian diplomats played a key role in pushing for “ sustainable development goals ” that the 2015 millennium development goals are about .
they were included in the final draft document , which was adopted by world leaders , including mrs gillard , at the summit .
un secretary-general ban ki-moon said at the summit in the evening that the time has come to go ‘ beyond national interests ’ .
“ i am pleased that the member states agree that the european union should initiate a process that will allow universal human rights and democracy to be established . ”
“ these goals will be based on our progress in the millennium development goals and will form an integral part of the global environment for development after 2015 .
i will spare no effort to make this document available to me by the member states , so as to promote our vision of sustainable development goals , which is based on the success of the millennium goals .
even if sg achim / baden has been without victory for four days of the games , the handball upper league remains in a good mood .
this is why trainer tomasz malmon leaves no doubt at all .
all are still fully motivated to do so .
i hope , however , that we will finally win again .
&quot; i know nothing more , how many people have won .
although the third league reserve is made up of fredenbeck , there are currently no trees out of the reserve , malmon will highlight in advance the need to warn the pointer finger .
many players i have seen in the a-youth .
that is why they will vote against their ex-coach in particular .
&quot; furthermore , we must wait to see if there is further reinforcement from the first one , &quot; explains the sg-coach .
to finally get back to the track record , the country ’ s malmon-team must be able to move forward to the next level in comparison to the previous appearances .
above all , in the work of covering and switching over to the game , it was a tremendous success .
the use of opportunities must definitely improve too .
i therefore hope that my players will be able to get their heads free during the short break .
security concerns in mozambique are growing , given clashes between influential personalities and political leaders .
thousands of people gathered in the centre of maputo under the vigilant eyes of the statue of samora machel , the founder and first president of mozambique , to be held in a rare public demonstration of peace .
“ we want peace again , we want stability , ” said vanessa de sousa , managing director of an investment company .
fearing the country ’ s future , she has changed her business clothing to a t-shirt with the label “ we demand security ” in portuguese and has changed her name to the chinese independent market on thursday of the crowd .
for two weeks , there have been reports of almost daily clashes between government forces and renamo , which have been one of the worst battles since the peace agreement more than 20 years ago .
renamo was once a notorious rebel movement that initially opposed the regime ’ s white rebel regime .
after the 1992 peace treaty , it became an opposition party .
analysts think it is unlikely that the country will return to a full-blown conflict , but the recent events have left foreign investors and indigenous people worried .
for the fast-growing economy , there is much at stake , because the discovery of vast gas deposits off the coast and coal layers in the northwest could generate investment of more than $ 50 billion from firms like rio tinto rio .
the ruling frelimo party , since 1975 the dominant force , and renamo are giving each other the blame for tensions .
renamo claims that the government has been provoking the recent clashes by launching its members in the province of sofala , a traditional stronghold of renamos on 17 october .
the attacks on the former rebels escalated as government troops renamo-bases and the military were attacked .
the government gives renamo the blame for the clashes and accuses the organization of attacking soldiers .
president armando guebuza has tried to raise concerns about instability .
compared to afp , the french news agency , he said on wednesday that dhi had been a great success .
both frelimo and renamo stress that they must avoid war .
but concerns have increased since mazanga began to speak of the need to renamo .
he declared to the ft that he meant that frelimo would not accept the agreement .
“ our vision is to restart negotiations and to do so seriously , ” said mazanga .
earlier talks between the parties have done little to resolve the tensions caused by a number of clashes in the country this year .
“ we have two adult men here ( guebuza and dhlakama ) who are the ones who meet together , ” says joseph smith hanlon , lecturer at the open university and mozart university .
none of them is good at negotiating , and none is prepared to make the necessary concessions .
renamo , who is pressing for electoral reforms , has already said that it will not be boycotting the november local elections .
presidential and parliamentary elections are planned for next year .
some commentators have suggested the use of force as an attempt by an ailing movement to make concessions and financial concessions to the government .
renamo ’ s electoral successes have been shrinking since 1992 , while a newer party , headed by a former renamo member , has been blocking the election .
mazanga claims that guebuza – whose resignation is due when his second term comes to an end next year – is destroying the country ’ s democracy .
“ he does not want multi-party democracy , he does not want transparent elections , he does not want peace because he does not want to give up the presidency , ” says mazanga .
it is unclear what capacities renamo has , but it has caused disquiet and incitement to police stations and vehicles on an important north-south line .
most of the battles took place in the province of sofala , which was several hundred kilometres north of maputo , but in which beira is located , the port , the mining industry such as rio tinto and várt .
in june , rio interrupted the use of the railways for a month after renamo launched an attack on the track .
mazanga replied reluctantly to the question whether renamo would repeat this threat .
renamo wanted to warn the international community that things are going wrong in mozambique , ” said mazanga .
instability has fueled frustration over the government , says fernando lima , head of mediamoop , a non-governmental media company , because many people have worried about the corruption that they have been experiencing .
&quot; people think that the government and the president are responsible for the country &apos;s future and he is the one who is going to find solutions to the problems , &quot; he explains .
omar sultane , a demonstrator , said that people simply wanted stability .
“ no one interested renamo and frelimo , they just want peace and usable roads again , ” he explained .
children should be able to understand myths and legends as “ models for life , ” says an author .
the stories of thor showed that “ brutal force is not a chance to fight clever tricks , ” and the artus legend demonstrate that the power of the two is important .
many of the myths , however , are “ far too wild , too offensive , and in some cases too dirty to be taught at schools . ”
“ i think it is wonderful that in america myths and folklore are already part of education , ” he said .
i have been doing this for twenty years now .
he added that authors and teachers are not allowed to &quot; overly didactic &quot; , but children would be “ completely shut down ” because in entertaining stories would be the messages “ entertaining . ”
crossley holland , the beowulf from the anglo-saxon country , and the author of the penguin book of norse myths and the british folk tales , said : “ you can &apos;t be wrong . ”
perhaps the greatest difference between an adult author who writes for adults and an author who is for children , is in the fact that he needs to convey hope .
not everything needs to be simplified or added to the happy end , but there is an intrinsic sense of good and evil .
this must be presented in a subtle way , revealed by history , and not explained .
this is the old story of showing rather than telling .
hansjakob moves to freihof again .
100 years ago heinrich hansjakob rests in haslach , on sunday the company was relocated to the &quot; freihof &quot; .
the many spectators were impressed by the extremely short cast of scenes .
from arrival through the award of honorary citizenship to his death , drehbuchautor and hansjakobarker alois kraftzcyk had a fun piece to create , which was directed by the director .
marcus zagermann took the audience as spokesperson through the ten different scenes , explained contexts and bridged jumps from the youth to the close pensioning .

and then the scene game began , in which alois krafczyk once again played in his paraderolle as the great son of the city .
he went on to breathe in silence with the twin-shaving and the black forest foxes from erich becherer from mühlenbach .
it was not only received by the audience with much applause , but also his sister philippine welcomed him .
billy sum hermann understood it incredibly well to be in the role of sister .
the game was played between the scenes of the mühlenbach farmer &apos;s chapel with carefully selected music and thus rounded off the performance .
the city of bonn was then admitted to the honorary dignity of mayor heinz winkler , who was in charge of the former office of the former ape hättich along with a part of the city council .
their upkeep then made the tri-king singers , the hansjakob to the call : &quot; oh how beautiful , there will again be youth memories of my own tri-king period alive &quot; .
with your song &quot; o jesulein &quot; you enjoyed the audience at the open air and the storchentagskinder with their loud &quot; out , out &quot; .
his criticism of the church of the holy virgin had been expressed by hansjakob at the time , as did his concerns about the excesses in agriculture , the consequences of industrialisation or the effects of war .
in the home , behind its tomb chapel on the fire at hofstetten , he found his retirement .
&quot; a troubled mind had finally found his calm and had gone forever &quot; , it was said at the end of the scene play .
much applause and many words of praise were given by the audience for the performance .
basketball : the hope of the neckar giant grows more and more giants &apos; hope is growing .
the chances of the league remaining in the sporty downhill ludwigsburger bundesliga basketball league have increased .

in a new zealand small town burt muro is considered a charming caucasus because he has decided to travel to the city by motorcycle , built in 1920 , in a race in america .
burt is a good place to start your dream , despite a heart error .
with its savings , a few donations and a mortgage on its old workshop shoes , the company is setting up a new office for the company by ship to los angeles .
after the movie there is coffee , tea and cake .
schilles piepsen disturbs the residents of the area and disturbs the residents of the town .
rhenus midgard also has a strong investment on land .
they distribute the ships &apos; combustion coal to the hald .
the company has several iron in its plant .
in addition to coal imports , rhenus midgard also relies on wind-storage logistics .
black glows the coal on the campsite in front of the dam .
two massive blue shots and a backpack for the rechargeable device either distribute or load the coal as needed .
every movement of the transshipment unit sounds a shiny warning noise overflowing across the terrain .
&quot; the signals serve to protect the safety and are prescribed by law , &quot; says matthias schrell , managing director of rhenus midgard in wilhelmshaven .
in case of unfavourable wind , the wind is unfortunately widely heard - and there have been some complaints from people from the north of the city .
he takes the complaints very seriously and has therefore contacted those concerned , says the 40-year-old .
in close consultation with the authorities , we are now in the process of sending out the warning signals with technical measures .
he continues to rely on open dialogue with his neighbours .
matthias schrell has a lot to do with the site .
with the expansion of the niedersachsenbrücke rhenus midgard continues to rely on coal imports for power stations and is one of the largest in europe in this sector .
thanks to the 18.5 meter long reclining tub , the front terminal can be used for longer even capesize bulkcarriers .
&quot; this year we want to use the 3 million tonne transshipment mark &quot; , says schrell .
in addition to the on-site eon power station , import coal is used for power plants in the interior .
if the gdf suez power station is added to the grid , a good 5 million tonnes of coal imports per year are realistic .
the three ship chargers on the bridge and the second transport tape could save up to 10 million .

we have sent out the message : there is basketball in munich too !
the first time she appeared in the european premier class , the munich re members sold themselves very well , but in the crucial stages of the game , they simply didn &apos;t know enough .
the guests first made the trick of creating a 15-point backlog 13 minutes before the end of a tour , before piraeus joined the game again .
&quot; we have been incredibly reluctant to fight the twice euroleague champion , but then again to be reckless . &quot;

ben greenman : ten years of new york comedy festival : the new yorker
one might say that new york city is the birthplace of stand-up comedy in america : a year ago , the american film director , william shatner , began to perform as a conférencier in the palace .
over the years , fays innovation has been expanded , as was the most recent at the new york comedy festival .
founded and directed by caroline hirsch , founder of the stand-up-institut carolines , the festival celebrates its 15th anniversary this year .
“ most of these headliners started with caroline and were then increasingly successful , until they were finally found to be known to be in a club . ”
we have designed this festival so that we can continue to work with you .
at this year &apos;s event there are performances by wanda sykes , kathy griffin and bill maher as well as from “ stand up for heroes ” , an annual music and comedy show .
the festival also brings the world of comedy to life .
a number of comedians who will participate in the festival this year are delighted by the rather unconventional ways , such as broadcasts on smaller television channels such as comedy central , fx and spike .
nick kroll was awarded a sitcom on cable tv ( the ironic slip on the fantasy football-series “ the leading football ” on fxx ) and has now published his own sketch show .
jenny slate was present at the saturday night live as well as at the parks and recreation .
both kroll and slave and other young comedians with characteristic voices ( the surreal pessimistic anthony jeselnik , the ironic , on racial theories ) .
the biggest magnet visitors of the festival include an interview : david steinberg talks with larry david .
steinberg began as a stand-up comedian , but has become a respected television and film director .
from 2005 to 2007 he hosted a television programme entitled “ sit down ” , which was broadcast by david steinberg on tv land .
the meeting will take place in the town hall in the middle of manhattan .

iran satisfied with the process of nuclear negotiations
iran is showing itself a week before the next nuclear meeting with the five un vetoes and germany satisfied with the negotiating process .
&quot; after years , agreement has now been reached with the international atomic energy agency to resolve the differences of recent years , &quot; he wrote .
it would be a long way off , but the nuclear negotiator is not satisfied with the negotiation process and is also optimistic that both sides will end up finding a solution .
drama in uruguay : young kill gamesrades with machete , and the killer are killed .
two children have been killed in uruguay by a 11-year-old .
the two 14 and 12 year-old boys had invited their victims to go bird hunting with them .
with machetes and knives , they arrived in the city on tuesday , and were throwing the corpse into the fire .
they would then have to be in a working-class area of football in front of their homes .
the body was found in the following night in the village of cerro pelado , 15 km north of the exclusive beach there punta del este .
as an alibi , a five-year half-sister of the younger one who took her away should say that she was sexually attacked by the boy .
but when the girl was in front of the police without mentioning an attack against her , she gave the two boys the deliberate killing .
the reason why the older person called a rivalry in the football game .
he was temporarily transferred to a psychiatric youth institution .
pimps must be released into prison .
because of exploitative human trafficking , pimps , threats , insults and dangerous physical injury , the court of konstanz has sentenced a 33-year-old man from st. georgen to three and a half years in prison .
the former german military soldier , who was killed in afghanistan as a doorsteer , was in charge of a trial agreement .
so in five cases he has sent women via internet or telephone contacts .
he used to resist violence and threats .
women &apos;s income , which has been earmarked for them for some years , has remained at a standstill .
confiscation of mobile phones and sim cards underbended the women &apos;s contacts to the outside world .
together with a colleague who communicates women , he brought them to various bordels in the south-west .
there he had some monitoring of them to control their revenue .
in court , the defendant first claimed that he was suffering from a serious trauma after colleagues in afghanistan were dying alongside him in an explosion .
after a psychiatric expert has expressed serious doubts about the mental restriction and hence about a limited liability for the injury , he has put forward a proposal for a comprehensive confession .
the court had to inform no more of the women who were injured .
as a cripo official reported , the number of people who had been arrested for using telephone surveillance measures was at least four more cases of exploitative trafficking .
the interviews were highly aggressive , and the talks were very much in evidence .
later on , the estimated damage would have been the result of their martyrdom .
another witness , in which one of the women was blue stains on the whole body , has not yet made any statement .
it is a &apos; completely broken constitution &apos; .
the defendant regretted his behaviour yesterday .
&quot; he has been dissolved from these circles and wants to be a normal life after the detention , &quot; he said .
oil prices continue to rise to usd 96 per barrel .
the price of oil has also fallen on friday , after concerns about a high supply have overshadowed a report that the energy-intensive manufacturing sector in china is growing .
the reference crude oil for deliveries in december was late in the morning in europe in electronic commerce at the new york mercantile exchange .
the treaty fell by 39 cents on thursday , which resulted in a 5.8 % drop in the price of october .
the large range of crude oil has increased prices in recent weeks .
the us department of energy declared on wednesday that the us offer had been reduced by 4.1 million barrels .
over five weeks , the offer had been expanded by 25 million barrels .
but on friday there were indications of increased demand by two reports on an increase in chinese manufacturing activities .
this suggests a continued recovery in the chinese economy , whose growth is set at 7.8 % in the third quarter .

the court blocks the decision on stop-and-frisk of the nypd &apos;s stop-and-frisk directive .
a federal appeals court in the us blocked the order of a judicial authority on thursday to make changes to the stop and freeze regime .
the second us court of appeal stated that judges shira ’ s decisions would be suspended until more than a call for the city was made .
the judge had been urged in august to suspend the city against the constitution with the way in which it was implemented for the anchoring and questioning of people .
the city appealed against its assessment and the ordered dissuasive measures , including the decision to establish a monitoring centre to monitor the activities of the police in changing its directive and the appropriate training programme .
the court of appeal heard the arguments on tuesday that the suspension of the court of appeal was called for .
the appeal report stated that the judge must be informed of the case and that the court must be informed of the code of conduct for us judges by determining whether the case is the judge .
the judge had ruled that police officers were injured in the civil rights of tens of thousands of people because they were inappropriately targeted black people and latin american men with the stalling mechanism .
she appointed an external unit to monitor the implementation of essential changes , including reforms to directives , training and staff supervision , and ordered the commission to launch a pilot programme aimed at improving the quality of cameras in neighborhoods where the most are .
in august , the city of new york agreed to review the practice of storing names and addresses of people who are searching for control by the police .
an oral negotiation on the appointment of the city is scheduled after 14 march 2014 .
the stop and frisk-tactic has been used by a number of civil rights defenders .
controls of this kind have been in place for decades in various forms , but the number of recorded checks during the term of office of the partisan mayor michael bloomberg has risen to an all-time high of 684.330 in 2011 black american men and the year in 2011 .
in 2004 , four men belonging to all minorities were brought to court , who were guilty of a collective action .
advocates of changes to the stop and frisk program of the nypd say that changes will end unfair practices and create a more trusted and effective strategy for police and the way in which they operate .
opponents believe that the changes will change the morale of the police , but not criminality ; nor would money be wasted and the broader problem of a police force that is forced to leave after thousands of posts have been lost in the last decade .
the judge pointed out that the judge had not been able to verify the stop and frisk practice , the constitutional practice of which was only the type of implementation of the controls by the nypt .
the happiness of the dreamy camels
happiness is an oasis that only dreamt camels can achieve .
with this bedouin wisdom , the first chairman wolfgang henne described the history and fascination of the association &quot; helping hands &quot; .
on saturday afternoon , the tenth birthday of the association was celebrated , which was already considerable .
the first chairman , henne , has reported at length on the work of the association .
he himself was the first time in 2004 in mauritania in the cheijk-zaed hospital in nouakchott .
as a result , further cooperation developed , and gynaecologist henne was on the spot carrying out numerous operations on several trips .
during the speeches , pictures of the operations were taken on a large canvas , so guests of the anniversary ceremony of the aforementioned actions can make a picture .
the desert vehicle of the association was also shown .
it is a former federal border protection vehicle .
rainer prewo , the former ob of nagold , had proposed to use this vehicle with a photovoltaic system and is now planning to build a new one , according to henne , at the club in consultation .
in 2008 , zimmerei schleeh from baiersbronn won the first prize in the record time of almost a week in socogim , a misery quarter on the edge of the capital city .
henne also mentioned a new mother child hospital in novo mesto , where she was born .
especially interesting in times when the birth rate in nagold is becoming increasingly widespread .
you learn a lot in africa as a medical doctor , according to henne , for example , depression against burn-out .
the political unrest in the country has not allowed us to make as many journeys as we had planned , but many medical doctors came to germany for hospitalization in various areas .
in addition , containers are sent regularly to africa , so in march of this year medical equipment , medicines , bandages , hospital beds and bricks .
the company has been operating in the field of software development since 1987 .
as his personal motives were called his work in the area of auditing as a young member .
when he realized how much money was lost on the way , he decided to help the africans in controlling a budget .
fuchtel also stressed that the global economy also needs global love of humanity .
nor should it be forgotten that africa is closer than some think .
from gran canaria , not far to africa .
coulson used telephone hacking to check a tip .
the former news of the word editor andy coulson reportedly put “ telephone-hacking , surveillance , and confrontation ” in an attempt to get a wrong tip about an affair of the then interior minister charles de gaulson .
public prosecutor andrew edis qc explained to the court in the old bailey , news of the world sent a false rumor in may 2005 that clarke was a relationship with his “ attractive special adviser . ”
the newspaper commissioned the private detective glenn mulcaire to investigate pawlby &apos;s voicemails .
“ according to the public prosecutor , coulson , who is now the editor of the federal state security and defence agency , is not a person who stands in front of the home of people and hopes to catch them fresh , but one who knows .
he said that notw uses three procedures to write stories investigative .
the publisher is personally involved in the third method .
obviously he knows of the second , the monitoring , otherwise it cannot be .
what about the first ?
does he know about phone hacking ?
he denies that , but we say , ‘ and whether he knew about it ’ .
rumors of an affair of clarkes were first heard by the feature editorial of notw. when one source , the sexual nature of pawlby , was discovered .
a volume with voicemails from your phone of at least three occasions was published in august 2006 in mulcaires apartment .
the investigators also found entries on the detektive &apos;s computer where pawlby and their sister were named “ projects ” .
in the time when research was running , the results of the research were given by the grandparents of pawlby anonymous calls asking for information about them .
meanwhile , the former chief executive officer , neville , supervised the entire company , including the former reporter , j. weattherup , to monitor the movements of pawlby .
on 18 june 2005 , coulson left her a voicemail with the following content : “ i have a story that we will release tomorrow , about which i would like to talk to charles . ”
edis explained that coulson &apos;s activities at this story followed the same pattern as in other important personalities , such as the former interior minister david blunkett .
the jury heard on thursday that cole &apos;s blunkett was not allowed to be released because of an affair with a married woman when he himself was involved in the charges .
coulson and brooks quarrel to talk to others .
mulcaire , thurlbeck and weatherup have the telephone hazard .
in protest against the planned wealth tax , the french football is actually going to be the first strike since 1972 .
a conciliation meeting is a fruitless end .
in the conflict over the wealth tax , the government and the professional football have been forced to fight for their rights in france after a failed conciliation meeting .
president françois hollande received a very warm welcome from the french president , who was elected to the paris élysée palace on thursday , and also heard their complaints .
he refused to accept the foot ball from the planned world cup 75-percent .
the other side also remained tough .
the plan for the strike announced for the end of november will now be followed , the chief association of professional clubs ( ucpf ) , jean-pierre louvel , announced .
the agreement reached between 29 november and 2 december is a step forward in ligue 1 and ligue 2 .
geechinges : no absolute protection possible .
&quot; we want to involve the inhabitants early on in planning , &quot; mayor jens häusler opened the citizens &apos; information event on the flood protection concept in gechingen .
around 80 participants were invited to the municipal hall to see the planned measures .
chiefs made it clear that the final decisions will be taken by the members of the municipal council .
the floods , the ginging on 15 may 2009 , unprepared , were a dramatic blow to the european union &apos;s ability to protect its citizens .
a river basin investigation was conducted with the neighbouring town of aidlingen , which is now the basis for the flood protection concept in gechingen .
&quot; the protection of as many cultivated land as possible is the goal &quot; , so skinning .
the planning is based on the planning of protection against a statistically 100 years weather service forecast flooding every 100 years .
climate change is caused by a 15 % surcharge .
in specialist circles , this is done with &quot; hq 100aklima &quot; .
the water masses that were found in gechingen in 2009 caused considerable damage were equivalent to a 1000-year flood .
&quot; there is no absolute protection , but relative improvement can be achieved &quot; , says the chief economist .
to protect the hq 100aklima , you must have a ginged about four million euros , with the community having a land subsidy in the amount of around 70 percent .
chiefs , however , pointed out that it only makes the promotion possible if a global approach is implemented .
to this end , the municipality should be dependent on the participation of the citizens .
a complex planning and implementation process is a necessary part of the process .
at best , 2016 could begin implementation .
among other things , the protection concept , which was already adopted last week in the municipal council ( we reported ) , provides for local measures in the flow of the river irm from the stammheim valley .
after the presentation of the flood protection concept , participants took the opportunity to discuss their concerns .
among other things , it was questioned why no more dams and restraint basins were planned for the protection of the place .
gregor kühn , the specialist planner of the commissioned engineering office wald and corbe from hügelsheim , who presented the concept , stressed that it needed to interact with all the measures presented in order to achieve the sum .
it is also necessary to consider the most economical solution , as joachim wald von wald and corbe said .
displeasure prevailed among altort lovers , who even in normal thunderstorms were repeatedly subjected to overload of the channel network .
the problem is known to the administration and the first steps have already been taken .
chiefs , however , pointed out that the guidelines for channel systems are different from those for the floods protection and not to be confused .
the municipality is obliged to develop the channel network in such a way that two to three years of regeneration can be compensated .
the sewerage channels larger to dimensionally would devour millions .
serious injuries after collision
early friday afternoon , the national road 44 is near revensdorf and two drivers are driving a frontal collision .
the police closed the street immediately completely , but could not go to the accident first .
however , there are various testimonies that need to be evaluated first .
it is a fact that the 19 year-old steering of a vw golf is heading towards revensdorf and that the 38-year-old gettorf man has been standing with his hyundai .
both vehicles clashed , with the woman being so hard pressed to get the fire brigade for nearly half an hour , to be driven out of the vehicle wreck .
the actual cause of the accident was not clear at first .
both of them were killed in nearby hospitals .
the route remained fully maintained for about two hours .
it could be called the dostoevsky of the us .
philip k. dick was a god-seeker , a metaphysicist , his novels and stories also have a serial .
astonishing the kinship in the outer : the stellar eyes , beard , the high forehead .
and so , as fjodor m. dostoevski with his massive oeuvre as founder and aploget of russian soul to understand , is the russian soul reads philip k . dick as american prophet .
some titles are published by heyne verlag , the haffmans cassette with 118 stories distributed two-thousand copies .
dick explains america - the realm of breathtaking technical progress , coupled with paranoia , security madness , and the belief that america is chosen .
dick had divine experiences , his late books read like a mixture of the revelation of john and a computer manual .
perhaps he was crazy , had drugs left his brain .
he has captured , early on , that the computers are divinities .
he wrote a theology of the computer and asked what a man could expect from a machine he created , the creator of his creation .
this is the &apos; blade runner &apos; problem .
killing .
a master of science fiction .
a fantastic writer .
his stories have given film directors such as ridley scott , paul verhoeven and steven spielberg inspiration .
this story is now particularly significant .
the &quot; minority report &quot; comes from the year 1956 , but it exudes the smell of the cold war and the mccarthy tribunal .
the principle of &apos; pre-crime &apos; is being developed here , &apos; pre-crime &apos; , in other words what has now become more or less official doctrine of the white house .
in dick ’ s world , which is like ours frightening , mutants look to the future - and the police are intervening .
&quot; we collect individuals who do not pass any law , &quot; says the chief of the authority .
&quot; we take them to us even before they commit a violent crime , &quot; he said .
and : &quot; in our society there are no serious criminals , for which we have a punishment flags full of pesudo criminals &quot; , they read time streams .
they assume that bad things happen and prevent the war criminals from being used in practice .
dick ’ s narrative acts as the blueprint for anti-terrorist laws and the interrogation of nsa .
anticipation of the attack : this is how obama ’ s drone philosophy and practice works .
but dicks story is not finished yet .
the police chief complains that there is no separation of powers .
then the supervisor will be supervised and a future crime will be carried out .
the system is rotating .
it is perfect , but it lies .
it invents its own prerequisites .
if errors and sacrifices are not only accepted , but also built upon them .
the system creates the danger that it is fighting against .
philip k. dick reading is always saying , closer to the truth .
the staff were very friendly and helpful .
former us intelligence exam
representatives of the german federal attorney could either ask questions in writing or ask the 30-year-old personally in russia , interfax reported .
previously , the federal green party member hans-christian schöbele had been the first german politician to have made snowden in moscow yesterday to discuss the future of the affair with him .
nsa revelations reinforce corporate paranoia due to state surveillance .
on a mild day at the end of august , a german police helicopter flew deep across the us consulate in frankfurt am main , the german financial capital .
at the instruction of the federal office for constitutional protection and the fight against terrorism ( bvt ) , the german internal security service , it should be able to take photographs of the roof of the us outpost , which is less than 5 km away from the european central bank .
according to the german media , the bvt wanted to prevent the presence of surveillance antennas and the action led to a change of language between the us and the german foreign ministry in berlin .
james clapper , us director of national intelligence , has been in september to insist once again that the us has no means of overseas espionage , “ to reduce company secrets . ”
but since edward snowden , who was a whistleblower , was a former employee with the publication of his horn to us surveillance secrets , he has been unaware of european governments and business leaders .
reports that the us national security agency has been reporting to the brazilian oil company petrobas have been on the move and that data from american cloud suppliers , including google and yahoo , have been disrupted .
the barrel of overflowing brought the revelation that chancellor angela merkel ’ s phone was wounded , perhaps for ten years .
if the most powerful person in europe can be targeted , then surely the most powerful of the companies are potential targets .
snowden has developed the intensive cooperation between us intelligence services and companies in a transparent manner .
i think it is conceivable that these data will be used for mutual benefit .
“ germany must wake up , ” explains oliver grün , president of bitmi , who is a small and medium-sized it company in germany .
german companies believe that the us has now posed an almost equal risk to china when it comes to industrial espionage and data theft , such a survey that has shown that it is likely to be supported by ey &apos;s consultants in july .
snowden ’ s snowden leaked documents , however , have not provided evidence that the us has broken trade secrets from foreign companies to its own companies .
politicians have expressed concern that the euro will be deprived of certain it and internet opportunities and that it will reduce its dependence on the us .
companies are sceptical about this .
in the bundestag , it was suggested that we should build a german google .
i can only close my eyes and open them slowly ...
“ this is not how things work , ” hasso plattner , chairman of the german software manufacturer sap .
if we want a strong european it industry , then we should not have had it 20 years ago .
everything in germany is subsidised , from coal to cars to oil and agriculture .
everything except the it industry .
nevertheless , scope and technical refinement of the snowmobile ’ s revelations have not yet reached the limits of the us spy authorities .
cloud computing is undergoing a major change , because european business leaders are now more aware that in the us , stored data of the legal jurisprudence is subject to and therefore potentially endangered .
according to a survey conducted by the cloud security alliance , a commercial institution , the united states government has issued a survey of the most recent financial crises in the world .
jim snabe , deputy managing director of sap , says : “ we see a new question from customers who are not there before a year ago .
many german business leaders believe that the latest reports simply confirm what they have done anyway .
the fact that economic espionage is taking place is no surprise .
that has always been the case .
“ it has been a topic for many years and has not fundamentally changed as a result of the current discussion , ” says kurt bock , chairman of the chemical company basf .
americans are spying us on commercial and industrial fronts , as we have done .
the management normally does not boast about the remedies that have been taken , because that gives attackers advantages .
in large companies , employees have long been aware that co-ownership is a key factor in the success of a free usb stick at a trade fair or the unguarded letting of a laptop in the hotel room .
ulrich hackenberk , member of the board of automanufacturer audi , says that it has been a standard practice for years , before a board meeting , to collect cell phones so that they are not used as interceptors .
the german bvt advises executives to make simple prepaid phones , if they are based on international travel , because smart phones are not likely to be compromised .
the prepaid phones are then discarded .
however , there is a concern that small and medium-sized enterprises are vulnerable to hacking and surveillance .
in germany , many of these companies are global market leaders in their respective niche .
“ small and medium-sized enterprises often lack the experience , staff and financial resources to be able to effectively protect business secrets against unauthorized access , ” the bvt warns in a report .
the us warns its own firms against economic espionage by other countries .
according to washington post , the us national intelligence estimate in february brought france , russia , and israel back to china in rank two of the countries that committed themselves to obtaining economic data from the hackings .
a member of the executive board of a german blue chip company agreed when it came to economic espionage , “ the french are the worst . ”
bernard squarcini , former head of the french internal security service , dcrl , was arrested this month in an interview with the following words : “ the secret services are well aware that all countries , even if they do not fight terre in the first round .

us prosecutor michael moore said on thursday that there will be a formal investigation into the death of johnson , because a number of important questions remain unanswered .
what was the cause of death ?
is his death a crime ?
the moore declared at a press conference on thursday afternoon .
i follow the facts in which you are leading .
my aim is to find out the truth .
“ i believe that a sufficient number of factors are needed to form a formal investigation , ” said he .
moore told reporters that the initial autopsy suggests that the us would be a good place to be judged by the consequences of a “ postation-related suffocation . ”
a second autopsy , however , has caused another death , according to moore .
“ there are a number of questions that need to be answered or confirmed , ” he said .
moore added if there is sufficient evidence for a criminal investigation .
a representative of the county sheriffs authority was waiting for our request on thursday , but was not able to comment immediately .
a dish in southern georgia ordered a new round of talks on wednesday that the authorities would publish all surveillance videos that were intended to facilitate the investigation .
the parents of the teenager said they hoped that the video recordings would contain evidence of how he died .
cdc publish allergic reactions for schools and schools in the eu and other countries in the eu .
on wednesday , the centers for dieting control ( ccp ) released a report on the situation in the united states .
these are the first directives of this kind that the us government has issued , as the number of compulsory children in school is growing , with food allergies .
one in 20 children in the united states now has a food allergy .
the spread of food allergies among children has , according to the cdc , increased by 18 % between 1997 and 2007 .
the guidelines contain information for schools that are registered with the teacher and staff for food allergies .
it is also recommended that schools use epinephrin in stock – the auto injection of the brand epidemic is most commonly used – to prevent a potentially lethal oversensitivity effect .
the legislators in the states have recently amended the rules so that schools can provide epinephri with easier access .
the report also contains a list of typical symptoms that children can have , which are allergic to them .
children may say , “ it feels as if something is on my tongue ” , “ my tongue feels like it is on the surface , as if a hair is on it ” or “ my tongue is cribbing ” .
parents of intersexual children can “ be sexually imdetermined ” , but they can choose “ sex impersonated ” .
germany is the first european nation to have a third gender for children .
newborn children are no longer being subjected to rigid male or female assignments .
under the new law , parents no longer have to declare sex for such children , but can be “ undetermined ” or “ not fixed ” on the birth certificate .
the aim of the law is to reduce the pressure of parents so that they do not take hasty decisions on operations for a gender breeding in newborn children .
an intersexual person said , according to bbc years later , “ i am neither man nor woman . ”
i remain the patchwork that is being created by doctors , mutilated and full of scars .
it is estimated that one in 2 000 children are not considered young or girls every year .
they are intersexual , a group that is suffering from the diagnosis of “ sexual differentiation disorder ” ( dsd ) , a collective crime concept .
wallis simpson was perhaps intersexually .
understanding gender identification is still a long way from being developed , but the majority of experts in the us suggest that it is the best available information to help us to identify gender .
the new york psychiatrist dr. jack drescher , who focuses on the problem of gender identification , said that the new german law “ klinge for a good cause ” .
intersexual children are an ethical dilemma .
“ some people have life-threatening diseases that require surgical intervention , ” says the rapporteur .
you can use gender assignment without surgery and then wait for the identity to develop .
the scientific data on how a child can possibly even develop its gender identity is not very accurate .
no one knows why it is happening .
it is like the secret why people are gay .
in a report to the european commission in 2011 , it says that intersexual people are excluded from transsexual or transgenic treatment .
these characteristics were reflected in secondary sexual characteristics .
the report also gives an overview of the discrimination that intersexual and transgender women face in the workplace .
not in line with the gender image , there is now a special camp .
it is now a matter of life and death for adults in australia and nepal to have male , female or “ third gender ” on official documents .
in june , australian norrie may-welby ( 52 ) was the first “ gender-free ” person in the world after a court had declared the lifetime of a “ undefined ” gender status .
german passports have a future role in the allocation of m and w , x for intersexuality , according to the ministry of the interior .
in neighbouring france , gender issues are still controversial .
in 2011 , dozens of french members of the strictly catholic country signed a petition that the “ gender theory ” of school books should be removed .
the american website catholic online has also opposed the german law , which has stated that &quot; if the world is in a new state , it will be in a new state where gender is a decision to stop sexual activity , but then forgive it .
the mother of a newborn from maryland explained to baby zone that she would find it better if babies were born in a sexually explicit baby .
“ parents are the best people for their family , ” says dr. heinrich schmitt , director of the association of children of the family .
children need stability and security .
historically , children who had been treated with both male and female sex were not treated as children .
ten years ago , medicine looked at gender as something that is not enough to wipe out and then rebuild .
but the ethical foundations of an operation are now being questioned , as we know how complex gender issues are .
“ in the middle of the 20th century , one was called psychiatric emergency , ” drescher said .
when such a child was born , it was not the psychiatrist who was called , but the surgeon .
the prevailing theory of treating children with unclear genitals is based on dr john money from johns hopkins university .
he coined the term “ gender identity ” and argued that social and environmental issues were induced – as parents had to raise a child – interaggerated with the genes and hormones of a child , and influenced it .
but in a paper published under the title “ john / joan ” from 1978 , the number of theories that he had known was controversial .
he advised the parents of a boy whose penis was in a pledged circumcision .
“ money presented this case as a successful example of a transformation that was not yet possible . ”
when the boy was about 15 , he switched back to the male sex and married a woman .
with 38 but he did commit suicide .
according to drescher , there are still doctors who practice this model .
but in the 1990 ’ s , with the advent of the internet , survivors of these sex operations have come to the public , who “ are not happy with the result . ”
for example , jim bruce , a 36 year-old author from montana who worked with xy-male chromosomes , but was ambiguous genitalia .
the doctors were unclear as to whether he had a large clitoris or a small penis , and were convinced that he could never be a “ satisfactory life ” as a man .
so his external body and the hands were taken to the hospital shortly after birth in 1976 .
at the age of 12 , he received female hormones .
“ i knew i was not a girl , ” he explained to abcnews.com that i was a girl .
i was unfortunate , but it was really hard to ask questions .
at the age of 18 , he should be given a vaginal plastic .
but , as he was depressed , and knew that something was wrong , he demanded that the world ’ s medical records be brought to bear .
what he found out was shocking .
i was born sterilized – and no one gave me that .
bruce was born with a dsd through which his body is not enough testosterone to develop genitals .
after knowing the truth , he changed to the male , and he was given testosteron-injections and let himself be his breasts removed .
the surgery has made it infertile .
today he is fighting for others in an organization called interface project to make intersexual people as normal .
but anne tamar-mattis , managing director of the california based company , is a very important figure in the field of intellectual property rights .
“ many activists are concerned that the german decision may encourage parents to make quick decisions and give the child a “ not specified ” assignment , ” she said .
we fear that this will encourage intervention .
we think it would be better to have male or female gender included in the list and then wait .
yet we do not know how the law will affect it , so we can only speculate .
tamar-mattis said that her organization supports the australian law , because “ it allows adults to be recognised as a third sex . ”
“ adults should be able to make their own decisions about their legal gender ” , he explained .
the german law concerns the allocation of funds to the child at birth .
this is not a fight to which young children can be forced at this time .
if they are grown up , they can decide for themselves about their bodies .
but dr. arlene baratz , a brustradiologist from pittsburg , who was a daughter with a sexual disorder , and has hundreds of others in a self-help group , says that this is the german law .
katie , the daughter of baratz , was born with male chromosomes , but has a dsd named complete androgen-resistance .
due to the receptor failure of the target cells for testosteron katie developed female characteristics .
she has a vagina but no uterus and no ovaries .
today katie 29 and married ; she works on the university of chicago , california .
it is infertile , but hopes to be eliminated by adoption or surrogate mother , though .
“ the law gives parents room to act in haste , ” says the president of the court of justice .
it gives you the time to do various tests and to clarify things and gives you the time to do them before they are “ male ” or “ female ” .
this way everything is fine – you pull the child big and love it .
the hotel is located in the heart of the city , close to the main train station and the main shopping street .
and you do not have to do an operation hastily that can no longer be undone .
“ this includes children in the decision and eliminates the fear that parents are taking over the life of their parents because they believe that they do not do the right thing , ” she explained .
ultimately , the child decides on sex , which fits better with it – and that is wonderful .
this will enable children to learn to make the decision themselves .
unknown injure girls by shot from car
unknown people have been killed by a bullet from a car in saxony-anhalt for twelve years .
the perpetrators had been arrested in gene with an air pressure weapon on a group of children on thursday evening .
the police in burg shared this .
the girl is easily attached to the left wade .
rescue forces brought the girl to hospital .
the shot came from a small car that was attached to a group of six children and suddenly had to stop .
witnesses saw two people sitting in the car .
the perpetrators also shot at a bus stop .
a disc broke .
they then went on to do so .
the criminal police investigate , said it was on friday .
until now , the police inspection kempten has been able to stop at a quiet halloween night .
the officials were only elected twice to a working child , who had to defend them against house facades .
since homeowners recognized this in time and the remains of the same time were removed , no material damage would have been caused .
the city has also been home to several sylvesterböller , but also here , no material damage has been caused .
an area of the bishop friendorfer-way reported that its car was equipped with a stone-wrapped pad and its wheel-edging apertures stolen .
until the police arrived , the man has left his wheeled apertures in the immediate vicinity all again , so the police cannot continue to operate .
living with a future
waltraud ries is actually living in a dream .
your house is situated in a quiet residential area of stuttgart with lots of green , an old tree population , nice neighbours and not too much traffic .
the city is only a few minutes away by public transport .
&quot; i hope you don &apos;t be afraid of spiders ? &quot; , waltraud ries asks and points to a fat spinning on the door frame .
i have been looking for a new apartment for my husband and myself for some time .
but you know how difficult this is in stuttgart .
the reason is not spider phobia , but the concern to make the many staircases to the house and the apartment out of the way in old age , explains them .
moreover , since a meniscus operation , the middle-aged woman has had to experience at her own body what it means to deal with handicap from floor to floor .
recently , a book by her has been published on the subject of &apos; happy living in old age - what is the best way of living for me ? &apos; .
&apos;our apartment is the best example of what is not possible in old age &apos; , she begins to tell .
when you started working with your husband in the maisonette apartment more than 20 years ago , it was simply a beautiful apartment in the middle of the green .
today , with the middle of fifty , waltraud reeds thinks differently .
but she also knows that she is one of the few people who has ever had to deal with the issue of &apos; living in old age &apos; .
most people are obstructing it as long as it goes .
the old are always the others &apos; , she says schmunzelnd .
only when the suffering is really great do we make a thought .
&apos;then it can be too late &apos; , however , is it ?
in her book , interior architect presents 17 models for self-determined living in old age .
&apos; what type of residence you choose is always an individual decision &apos; , explains it .
d i e solution do not give it for age .
even those who choose retirement home in tuscany or brittany can afford to take advantage of the fact that they can also be sick .
and : &apos; without good knowledge of the national language , the dolce vita , &apos; there is no doubt that the author of the book will be willing to consider the possibility of taking out a position .
among their models , classical care models , alternative housing , or the often cited retirement pension fund are found .
at old age , everyone has his own tips and tricks and makes a mask .
&apos;for me , such a community would not be anything &apos; , she says with a wink .
not even like a student wg with a common bathroom and a kitchen .
&apos;in old age you just need to have your retreat rooms &apos; , she says .
the fact that a senior citizens &apos; housing community can still function does not mean that the author of the book is excluded .
but that would have to be different from the classical student writing programme .
and sometimes you just want to rest , &apos; she believes .
with this view , at least in the capital of the country , it is not alone .
&apos;most old people in stuttgart want to stay away from home as long as it goes , &apos; is also the experience of theresa rutten , the head of civil services living at the age of the state capital .
your services advise people around the subject of &apos; getting older &apos; .
that is why the elderly in particular would often find themselves in difficulties and restrictions , just to be able to live in their familiar environment , which is also the experience of the warehousing foundation .
there are many ways of getting the house or apartment accessible without barriers today .
ries recommends that all those who are interested in the appropriate renovation of their house or apartment in the age of 18 should first get a thorough overview and not use the first best craftsman .
today there is also a system for the rebuilding of old age specialists .
even in the apartment let one or other reality .
but the existing flat cannot always be adapted to the age and thus accessible , even if it is still as beautiful .
waltraud ries had to do that experience .
while the apartment is located in a quiet street , the stairlift is also fitted with staircases and is easy to reach .
she will continue to search until she is the ideal object for her and her husband .
before moving , your car will gray more than before the spider at your home .
the us wants to prosecute snowden further .
the us has changed its position on former us intelligence officer edward snowden .
he is still accused of using unauthorized secret information .
therefore , it must be subject to criminal proceedings in the united states , as the us secretary of state , jennifer psaki , said in washington .
the recent statements by snowden would not change that either .
previously , the german green politician hans-christian ströbele had a meeting with snowden in moscow to discuss the us .
psaki emphasized that stretch of the air is a very strong statement by a parliamentarian , not a german government member .
intelligence enthlers edward snowden is generally invited to talk to german authorities .
first , however , he wants to know his situation .
this is what the united states sought from former nsa staff in a non-addressed letter made clear , which the founder of the green party , hans-christian ströbele , sent on friday after a meeting with snowden , sent to them .
the letter was written after a rough translation of the following :
i would like to ask the competent authorities to make a request to the relevant authorities .
i have been asked to give you a written reply regarding your inquiry into mass surveillance .
i would like to welcome edward joseph snowden and previously was in agreement with the council of ministers and the commission , or as a technical expert directly .
in the course of my work in these institutions , i have witnessed systematic violations of the law by my government , which prompted me to act on a moral basis .
as a result of the publication of these concerns , i felt compelled to face a serious and sustained lever that forced me to leave my family and my home .
i live in exile and i enjoy temporary work and i am very happy to see the russian federation grant me under international law .
i am encouraged by the response to my political action , both in the united states and elsewhere .
citizens around the world , and senior officials - including the united states - have been watching the revelations to create a system of all-encompassing surveillance that does not hold anyone accountable .
this espionage revelations brought many proposals for new laws and directives , which are based on the previously concealed abuse of public confidence in the eu .
the benefits to society from these knowledge are clear .
although the outcome of my efforts has been demonstrably positive , my government continues to treat dissent as a breach of trust and seeks to secure political expression .
nevertheless , to speak the truth is not a crime .
i am confident that the united states government , with the support of the international community , will be able to put this negative attitude to the fore .
i hope that when the difficulties of this humanitarian situation are resolved , i will be able to speak to the commission &apos;s responsible enlightenment of the situation regarding the media activities .
i look forward to a meeting with you in your country as soon as the situation has been clarified and thank you for your efforts to respect international law , which protects us all .
edward snowden testifies to hans-christian ströbele ’ s work in the “ kulturplanner ” .
kindergarten has found a private buyer
&quot; the building is in good hands &quot; , says winterlingen &apos;s mayor michael maier .
the former nursery in the garden street has been handed over to a private person .
the association of the municipal council approved the sale in its most recent meeting in the non-public part .
the building changed its owner to a &quot; reasonable &quot; price .
&quot; the municipality is satisfied &quot; , emphasizes maier .
the budget had allocated eur 100 000 .
it is not yet clear how the new owner will use the former kindergarten .
the mayor is entitled to say that winterlingen is responsible for the building before winter to someone else and therefore no longer responsible for the maintenance of the house .
&quot; this effort is now gone , &quot; maier is pleased .
the concert will take place at high summer temperatures .
the hammereisenbach music association is giving a concert on the terrace of the gasthaus hammer .
as conductor bianca willmann , at 7.30 p.m. , took the clock stock , the thermometer always shows 25 degrees .
about 50 listeners enjoy the sound of the hackers .
president manuela honeck explains the music .
honeck thanked everyone who helped to make the event a success .
report : obama ’ s campaign considered replacing biden with hillary clinton .
the closest advisers to president barack obama have secretly considered becoming vice president joe biden in the 2012 election campaign by hillary clinton , so the new york times said .
the revelation is the most remarkable surprise of the long awaited workshop .
the times is a copy of the upcoming issue of the book , and it also reported that on thursday afternoon , the book was published by the top advisers of the president , “ extensive group meetings and surveys at the end of 2011 . ”
according to jonathan martin , national political correspondent of times , the book presents a thorough account of the history of efforts by leading campaign and white house officials to bring about a change in the former white house chief .
the potential change was a strictly guarded secret of the world ’ s campaign infrastructure .
only half a dozen of closest presidential advisers – including daley , the former campaign leader obama , jim messina , and former chief executive adviser of the white house , david axelrod , and david .
in double down , it is claimed that dale has been at the forefront of efforts to keep biden alive despite their “ close , personal relationship . ”
in an interview with martin , daly confirmed that the government was indeed considering whether to take biden by clinton .
“ i expressed a whole series of things that could be considered , but i did not say that , ” he said .
it is worth remembering that the president then had terrible poll figures , that is , we thought : ‘ for god ’ s sake , what do we do ? ’
while daley was the &quot; due diligence &quot; of the investigations , martin said to anderson cooper of cnn that during the campaign for re-election considerable effort had been made to find out what was going on .
“ campaigns do not spend as much money on polls and focus groups , when they do not think seriously about something ” , he said on ac360 .
it is not clear , however , whether obama knew that his team would have an exchange .
martin said to cnn , he asked daley whether his then boss had been informed about the potential change .
although daley said he does not believe that the president of the possible change is “ aware ” , the former president of the stable said that there was “ possible ” .
martin added that “ double down ” is not a definitive answer to the question of whether the new political sondages will be obama ’ s desk .
cooper asked martin if he really think obama has not heard of the investigations about how the us government could buy bids in the elections .
“ possible , ” martin replied .
what happens to my email ?
e-mail actually means electronic letters .
has been sent in the design of the internet service email as in the case of conventional mail technically the secret letter ?
when designing early internet services , the emphasis was on making communication possible .
that is why , in the basic technical protocols , no attention was paid to establishing a solid foundation for a hearing of safe correspondence .
therefore , a conventional e-mail corresponds more to an open postcard than to a sealed letter .
if the user is interested in &quot; anna &quot; to &quot; benni &quot; , the hosts of the two then are directly connected ?
the email program or the browser of anna sends in the first step the mail to the mail server of your service provider .
for example , if you have a gmail account , google would be .
this mail server sends the content to the provider , the benni uses .
the route can be extended by several other servers on the internet .
bennie can then send the content to his provider .
if conventional e-mails are sent through the network ?
most mails are sent multiple times by software robots on the go .
the sender &apos;s provider is usually checked to see if the mail is a malicious program .
the receiver systems also have a virus checkbox .
the providers also check whether the service is a cumbersome and unwanted spam mail .
if the robots have another task ?
on systems such as gmail , the robot will also determine the information google needs to place context advertising .
if anna and benni are informed by gmail about your next holiday , google may provide links to holiday offers .
read also unknown people who have emails with ?
the probability that unauthorized persons will read a mail is extremely low .
in theory , however , this is possible .
in companies , administrators often have the opportunity to read electronic mail .
law enforcement agencies and secret services have also been given legal opportunities to intercept or notice e-mails .
in addition , there are possible illegal expressions .
is it possible to send e-mails against reading ?
with encryption after the openpgp standard , an e-mail can be effectively encrypted against reading .
with a high level of technical effort , it is also possible to disguise the metadata of e-mail communication , so that it is not even easy to identify who communicated with whom .
how important are yahoo and google on the email market in germany ?
the most commonly used mailboxes are yahoo and google , according to a survey by convios consulting , from august 2013 , only play a minor role .
while yahoo mail &apos;s share was last declined , gmail from google could significantly increase .
mother in the forest discarded and retired
when his betazed mother died , a man from wolfsburg forged a plan .
he gave the dead in a forest - and cashed the dead in a forest and continued to pay for their pensions and care allowances .
to continue to provide pensions and care allowances , the commission has proposed a 67-year-old wolfsburg to leave his dead mother after an investigation by the police in the forest .
first , he had the death of the 89-year-old , then he had to pay the money for more than a year and a half .
now the 67-year-old must be held responsible for fraud , as a speaker said on friday .
so the man hid the woman in a forest near the helmstedt .
the suspicion was already in may : at that time , it was discovered that there was a risk of the mother being left with medication .
investigators told the pensioner that his mother was sent to spain .
because the officials are curious about this , they further investigated .
it emerged that the two had been working in a common flat for more than 15 years and he was last cared for .
i was a 67-year-old who finally admitted the death of his mother .
an obduction , according to the police , did not show any evidence of a capital crime .
want to use ice cream , which is lit in the dark ?
a british entrepreneur has been the first in the dark shining ice – using qualms .
charlie francis made the fluorescent properties of the sea esters to benefit from and created a new kind of luminous delicacy .
the idea came to him after carrying out a research on jellyfish and persuading chinese scientists to use the bright protein artificially .
the ice cream reacts to the skin when consumed , thus reducing the ph value in the protein and preventing the light from being released .
chris explains that the ice cream responds to the warmth in his mouth and luminates – the more you lick , the brighter it becomes .
charlie , founder of the ice cream company &quot; lick me i &apos;m delicious &quot; , says : &quot; the product is incredible , it &apos;s still in a very early production phase .
the ice cream is used in the reactions with the tongue when a neutral ph value is applied .
if the mouth is the protein warmed , the ph value increases and the ice is shining .
we have seen it over the last few months and it seemed ideal to pass it on halloween to the market .
it is probably the most expensive ice cream i have ever produced , because the jellyfish is four times tougher than gold .
every ball costs me about 140 pounds .
but it tastes delicious for that .
charlie experimental company based in bristol is famous for its uncommon and unusual taste .
but his latest creation is to be even more ambitious .
he says , ‘ i would like to see an invisible ice cream ’ .
this is impossible in itself because of the refractive light caused by the ice crystals .
the ice cream uses fluorescent properties of a jellyfish , which is artificially manufactured by chinese scientists .
tsv morsum is the first german football league to be held in the world cup in 2010 after six days of play .
it is now precisely this that the ingo ehlers team will be voting tomorrow against the tsv daverden , who was held last weekend his first victory .
this game starts the season for us .
&quot; i hope that we finally get our head free , &quot; ehler &apos;s behavior is optimistic .
he has finally , except for permanent injured hendrik blohme , lost his complete cadre .
daverden , like us , relies on speed play .
we must therefore reduce our error rate .
first of all , however , we must increase the coverage that , at the end of the day , has left anything but a certain impression .
the best way to relax is to visit daverden ’ s coach thomas panitz after the first season ’ s victory against nordhorn .
the game was , of course , a house number .
but that is why we are far from being the favorite , because in derby everything can always happen .
however , panitz now wants to make a mockery in morsum to start a series .
the absence of jan-malte jodat .
the a-jugendliche joost windsweß , who has a double playing right at the a-jugend-bundesliga league , is celebrating his season debut .
if you don &apos;t have such a game , you should stay at home .
halloween 2013 : in figures , the world ’ s most famous summer holiday in the world is in fact the “ real ” : in figures , the world ’ s biggest in the world is not the “ real ” of the year .
when i was small , halloween had a magic .
my sister and i could not eat sweets late and let us take care of the neighbourhood .
today i am more inclined to halloween .
over the last two years , i have not agreed to move from my home to sweets , and i will probably not do so this year either .
but , according to statistics , i am a black sheep , as far as halloween is concerned .
the majority of americans – 158 million , to be precise – celebrate this year ’ s halloween celebration with a total of $ 6.9 billion for sweets , costumes , and decorations , according to the american association .
one thing i have to focus on every halloween then is the fact that the trend values are .
the costumes will be about 1.2 billion of the 6.9 billion u.s. dollars spent , so the nrf .
this year are exciting unfathomable items the last cry .
women no longer have to be dressed in sexy clothes , they can now also enjoy seductive food such as pizza , hamburgers or carrots .
as far as men are concerned , i expect lots of zombies thanks to the walking dead , and i bet the daft-punk space man will be this year in the inca race .
according to google , the most popular costumes are zombies , batman , pirates , and witches .
i suspect that there is nothing wrong with tradition .
last year we opened our dogs and we were very happy with it .
indeed , americans spend $ 330 million this year on costume of their pets , according to the nrf .
these are a lot of hot dogs .
as for sweets , we are not squeamish .
americans will be spending $ 1.9 billion this year , according to the nielsen company .
that is about 270 million kilograms of chocolate , loathing , sweets and rubbercocks .
so good news for the us department of trade , which has sent 41 million people to the tune of “ sweet or sour ” .
in fact , we will be producing more than 40 million kilograms of chocolate and , let us not deceive ourselves , eat .
the only thing we do not want to consume is the sugar-sweet candy corn ; yet 15 million kilograms of it are sold by halloween , according to the national association of confectionery producers .
that is about nine billion grains of maize .
it is a mystery that i have not yet been able to solve .
nothing is more to halloween than houses where there is a spice .
they have great names like “ terror ” , “ the wall ” ( which is also in a real prison ) , and “ howl-o-scream ” , and “ the house of shock ” .
there are , in fact , 1,200 officially recognised spuckhouses in the united states , which earn $ 500 million , according to america haunts , and that includes the wonderful photos that the us is currently taking .
but let us finally come to the shorts .
charlie brown made us a little bit familiar with the big pumpkin when we were children , and the cutting of a pumpkin lantern is like decorating the christmas tree – something we have made from a small age .
fortunately , the “ baby in the pumpkin ” trend began only last year thanks to pintest , so most of us have grown up to take the pumpkin and not to fall into it .
this year , americans will spend about $ 106 million on shortening , according to the us census bureau .
the pumpkin lamps , slowly rotting in the front garden , are probably from illinois , where this year 245 million kilograms of pumpkin were harvested .
if you want to score points , call tim and susan mathisdon in napa , california and cut the cart a little bit .
apartment fire in helbrecht : rescue forces are bestowing coal barrels of corpses and the fire is being burned down .
the fire brigade had to leave in helmbrecht late thursday evening .
a three-family house in the district of hof begins in the night for friday fire .
the rescue forces are responsible for a coiled body from the house .
rescue workers have lost their jobs in a fire in helbrecht .
whether it is a occupant handle is still unclear as a spokesman of the police in bayreuth said .
on late thursday evening , the earthquake in the house had burned .
when the fire brigade arrived , the flames already swept out of a window .
the forces of intervention went into the apartment and found the corpse in a room .
this and one more room burned out completely .
the entire ground floor has been damaged .
all other inhabitants were not too at home during the fire , the police spokesman continued to explain .
the building was not inhabitable for the time being .
the exact cause of the fire was not clear at first .
germany ’ s largest church of the country has launched an offensive to promote the occupation of the pastoral .
background is a possible parish shortage : the evangelic-lutheran church of the state hanover expects to be in a state of decline of approximately 1,800 pastoralists and pastors .
for today ’ s young people , the profession is very attractive and offers good prospects , said pastor mathis burfien ( 43 ) talking to the evangelical press service .
it is attractive to reduce the workload and the daily workload .
with burfia , the district church has for the first time opened a pastor in a full place to attract young people to study theology .
at present , fewer and fewer young people are choosing to study theology after graduation .
burfia is leading this to the process of deception : &quot; god &apos;s voice is quiet , the world is loudly &quot; .
the profession of great freedom and diversity is the hallmark of this profession .
i am mr of my calendar and can i set my priorities where it is important for me .
pastors could be very close to the people as pastors .
they earned as much as teachers , and could well live off it .
certainly , more money is paid in the free economy , but theologians would have a safe employer for that .
this will benefit today &apos;s young people , who are not only concerned with careers , but also with a work that is full of ideas .
according to the national church , which is located three quarters of lower saxony , about 60 pesticides are currently retiring each year .
at the same time , some 40 graduates of a theology studies begin their vikariat .
in sparsely populated peripheral areas such as resin , emsland or wendland , it may be difficult to find jobs in the future .
burfien wants to organize , among other things , study days for young people and invite celebrities to study theology .
the theology studies offer a broad education .
it can even become the president of the federal republic .
land rover rally series announced the release of land rover rally series rally series rally series .
the interior features racing seats and six-point seats .
the options range from reinforced brakes , a service package with support of bowler works meetings , and a range of logistic support to the vehicle invitations between events .
drew bowler , managing director of bowler motorsport , says : “ the rally customers who are invited to bowler are very happy .
they are not all experienced racing drivers , but people who are looking for excitement and adventure and for a reach for the next world class race .
we are pleased to continue this path in partnership with land rover and the msa and believe that the format will open up new possibilities that can be used to cover the various rally disciplines in the uk and abroad .
we really had fun getting the most defender challenge car .
moreover , there are many different ways to get the challenge done .
fire brigade to save a bitch called the &quot; dog &quot; , which is 15 meters above the ground on a dangerous rock edge in a quarry .
cockerspaniel bitch ruby was born after a minor road accident .
three days later , she was taken by a walker in the quarry in her unpleasant location .
firefighters rolled on the cliff wall and saved the dog from the safe storm .
the fire brigade managed to get a bitch safely , which was on a 15-metre high lead in a rocky wall .
the nine months old cockerspaniel bitch ruby was born after a road accident on sunday afternoon and passed away in the village alone for three days before she died on wednesday .
scott alderson , 25 , and his girlfriend becky hall , 20 , who was the dog , came to the quarry of flappit in denholme , west yorkshire to see ruby again .
they had desperately asked for their missing female .
around 14 : 15 on wednesday , a walk around the city looked like a dog .
the technical rescue team of cleckheaton fire station eightte was in the position of rolled out to rescue rubry .
andy clayton , specialist in the technical rescue team , said : “ you were in a dangerous situation , ” he said .
it was in the middle of the cliff – 15 meters from the top and the ground .
she did not move muscle during her rescue – she was like stiff frozen .
but now it is doing well .
she then took a few dog cakes and was very happy to have them .
that was a rather unusual effort .
the fact that the dog was discovered is incredible .
peter lau , specialist in the technical rescue team , said : “ ruby had a giant team of people . ”
there was a possibility that they were seriously injured or worse .
ruby was declared a veterinarian , but he was not exhausted and dehydration .
becky hall from halifax , west yorkshire , said : “ the rescue is watching us go out of the water . ”
i could not believe that they really was up there .
it was wonderful to see them again in the poor .
the vet explained that if exhaustion became too large and collapsed , it would have been presumably crashed .
the firefighters have done a great job .
it was really courageous what you did .
we are so grateful and each of you was absolutely incredible .
scott alderson from keghley added : “ we had been afraid that they would fall , but we were not able to do so . ”
the fire fighters were great .
i can hardly believe where it was .
mick jagger says he has never told katy perry when she was 18 .
in an interview with an australian radio station this week , the pop star said that she had been a background singer at hunting sings song “ old habits the hard ” from the year 2004 .
perry explained that she had been working with the altrocker to dinner , and that “ he has bagged me when i was 18 . ”
she added : “ that ’ s been a long time ago and he was very kind to me . ”
in a statement , a representative of jaggers , 70 , said on thursday that he was ‘ categorically against ever trying to bring katy perry closer together ’ .
the representative added : “ perhaps she has compared him with someone else . ”
perry was one of the singers who played at the rolling stones-tour this year .
her new album „ prism “ landed on the first place at the first place this week .
george kerevan : european unbundling gives scots the choice of being the scottish choice .
a new day , a new story of terror about independence .
this time we are warned that an independent scottish is required to be able to join the schengen area as a condition for eu membership .
this is the key word for stories about passport controls in berwick and a story with barbed wire .
indeed , the strathclyde template refers to the potential economic benefits that more travel freedom can bring to the rest of europe .
nor has anyone mentioned that eu member states often want to abide by their strict rules when it comes to making it more favourable to them .
as scotland is not currently part of the schengen area , the continued non-compliance with the treaty would be a small concession for brussels in exchange for what we have really heard from the scots .
so actually no story .
and one that has been in the years that it has already been subjected to a fossil : the first time i have called the “ independence means passport control ” -ente at least 40 years ago .
an interesting point is the constant repetition of this ancient history .
why should an independent scotland be expected to be able to do so under the european pipe ?
why the london yoke against the brussels embargo is particularly dangerous now ?
these are the real european news : the great , post-war , plan to unite europe has stalled .
the euro crisis has officially launched the european project .
across the eu , parties are gaining ground that are hostile to the eu or that are seeking to throw the euro overboard as a common currency .
even in germany , the eurosceptic party could not support alternative for germany – only this year – almost five million votes in the bundestag election in september , effectively undermining free democrats ( the equivalent of the german constitution ) .
there have always been domestic opposition to the plan to create a federal europe .
the current economic crisis , however , turns out to be a turning point .
because of the financial crisis imposed by berlin and the european central bank , in connection with the straitjacket in which the national economy is being penalised by sticking to the single currency , many people are of the opinion that the project is far .
the crisis in the euro has little to do with the fact that national governments are causing excessive budget deficits – that was only the case in greece .
instead , the eurosystem has focused its members on exchange rates , which are very important for german exporters – and we want german politicians to leave that as they are .
without the possibility of devaluing the local currency , southern europe will find itself with an integrated productivity disadvantage over germany .
the only way to do this is to cut wages and public spending – inspired by berlin .
behind the current budget and monetary problems lies a deep and profound problem in europe ’ s productivity .
as a result of the green policies imposed by brussels , the energy directive – a code for subsidizing french energy and german energy companies on the expense of consumers – the european industry is paying a high price compared to the united states .
this is a crippling cost , as we have already seen in granemouth .
all the world ’ s wage fixtures protect the european petrochemical industry from being dependent on cheap american shale gas .
as a result , a revolt is rising , especially in france , the former cheerleader of the eu .
after the war , france ’ s political elite saw the eu as a vehicle to use the eu to help germany .
but berlin no longer needs paris as a gateway to political legitimacy , and has thrown europe back on its own economic policies , which is what the struggling french economy is struggling with .
the result : marine le pens right-wing eu enemy forces have been blocked by a very significant second round , and thus the ruling socialists have been put in third place .
the national front is now the most popular party in france , with 24 % of the vote – a timely warning to the british labour government .
what makes le pen so popular with its newly won popularity among the white french working class ?
it wants to hold next year &apos;s eu elections to an anti-eu , anti-community monetary bloc in the european parliament .
if the anti-eu parties were to do well in these elections – and this is very possible – the first such bloc could undermine the european parliament .
this is the point i want to make : in the not too distant future , the growing resentment of the eu and the single currency will be combined to abolish the euro .
the eu will not disappear , but it will be more like a “ europe of ( sovereign ) nations . ”
germany and some of its satellite economies may hold on to the euro , but france and southern europe will be forced to return to their own currencies .
i expect britain to distance itself from this project in the hope of being able to join the united states .
but washington ’ s growing interest in the pacific region suggests that the united kingdom alone will be the world ’ s only rain .
where is scotland with all this ?
we can decide to create a region of ( ultimately ) small england .
or we can defend our own economic interests – including berlin and brussels – and we can defend them wherever they go .
i suspect that scotland could be in a looser european union .
cooperation with other similar countries is in a non-federal state .
otherwise , we should consider making norway the same and making our economic independence .
the snp government in scotland is – remarkably – a leader of the most successful political movement against the austerity policies in europe , and has played a spectacular majority in 2011 , owing to the rejection of the proposed ( and implemented ) cuts .
it would be ridiculous for scotland to opt for independence now , just to be removed from berlin and brussels by austerity .
early puberty : the early growth of the population is faster than early puberty : it is faster to grow up .
afro-american and hispanic girls tend to reach puberty rather than their white senses , as studies show .
physical changes do not mean directly puberty , but rather the physical changes of the body .
there is no evidence that hormones or other chemicals are responsible .
experts believe that the epidemic obesity is a trigger for early puberty .
the trend towards early puberty is less pronounced in young people .
the former cnn correspondent pat etheridge is a journalist who has been focusing on child health and family issues .
if a mother is worried if her daughter is already at the age of seven or eight years breasts and shampoos grow ?
at the annual conference of the children ’ s medical association american academy of peace , the children ’ s medical association held this week in orlando , florida , the paediatric endocrinologist paul kaploge declared that he was relatively unologist paul kaploge .
&quot; i spend a lot of time reassuring parents – usually the only thing that does not indicate that they are now quickly getting into puberty , &quot; explained kaplowitz .
obvious advertisements of the development , such as growing breasts , shampoo and armpit hair , as well as body odor , show themselves earlier in girls .
however , there was only a slight shift in the age of the menark ( appearance of the first rule bleeding ) over the last 40 years .
in the united states , the average age is 12.5 years , slightly less than 12.75 in the 1970 ’ s .
“ if the development of the breasts begins , it takes at least two to three years to reach the menarche , ” said kaplowitz , also author of the book “ early puberty at girls : the essential advisor .
time is the most accurate test of how to advance puberty .
it is controversial what actually marks the beginning of puberty , but we must “ start early ” the process when the breast size is not affected by a growth boost before an age of eight years .
in most cases , the pace of the process or stagnating – something that a child ’ s doctor can monitor closely .
if the progress is faster , tests could be replaced by an endikronologist to avoid serious problems such as tumors or cysts .
there are treatment methods for delaying early menstruation and discouraging another consequence : the premature use of ageing of bones , ultimative to growth barriers .
the recommendations for a medicinal or hormonal therapy are based on age of the child , age of development , age of growth and the emotional nature of the patient .
psychosocial aspects are also important .
kaplowitz is cautious about drugs , but he does give that : “ the suppression of the puberty can cause behavioral problems and feelings of girls who are not like their age colleagues . ”
the other major problem is understandable : parents simply do not want their very young daughters to have the period .
“ they worry about abortion risk or about how to treat the hygenic condition of the child , ” said kaplowitz .
“ it was a shock , ” recalls a woman whose daughter , at ten , had been given her days .
although there were initial signs and we were talking about menstruation , it was not emotionally prepared .
she came frightened and excited from school home , because she had the first in her friend &apos;s life .
there are many widely published theories about the causes of early putin ’ s puberty .
but there is no conclusive evidence that the hormone in milk-based milk or other foods , chemicals , is a serious threat to the environment or to sexual messages in the media .
boys come to the puberty in a similar way to girls .
kaplowitz believes that the most compelling premise is the epidemic of obesity .
he supported the implementation of a study in 2001 on girls aged six to nine years old who had a link between body fat and entry into the puberty .
other studies support this conclusion , but there are many other factors that require a role .
in this country , african-american and hispanic girls tend to reach puberty rather than their white age comrades .
there are different explanations for this .
globally , early puberty seems to have influenced all sorts of things , from economic conditions to the climate to genes .
another puzzle : although boys have the facial and shampoo hair growth earlier , the trend towards full-blown hair growth has been reversed .
other doctors on the aap conference highlighted the complexity of the issue and highlighted the importance of the issue .
the emergence of acne and shamhair is even more common in babies and infants .
“ we must be careful how we know the real beginning of puberty , ” said dr. lawrence silverman , a paediatric teacher of the university of vienna .
parents should not hesitate to let their pediatrician advise on how to communicate with their child .
“ this can mean that you can have a meeting earlier than expected , ” riet kaplowitz .
if you stay calm , the child usually reacts well .
girls who bloom early need the insurance to help the process become a normal part of life , even if they used to be thought .
jumbo manufacturers are arguing against the world ’ s leading manufacturers in the face of large orders over seat width and distances .
there is a clear distinction between leading aircraft manufacturers over the wide seating in the tourist class at long distance flights .
the dispute is about the seat width , the passport for long flights , in the tourist industry , and the number of passengers in the cabin .
airbus this week called for a standard of industry that includes a seat width of at least 46 cm ( 18 inches ) in the tourist class .
the debate comes at a time when aircraft construction is asking for it .
like the rear part of the aircraft is designed – especially if it is rows with nine or ten seats – it is crucial for the economic results indicated , which the new “ mini jumbo ” model will deliver .
boeing claims that its modernized “ 777x ” barrel will hold 406 people sitting in the tourist class , which has 17 inches wide and thus 10 per row .
airbus declares that the competing a350 aircraft will be delivered to 350 passengers in 18 inches wide seats in the tourist class , with nine per row .
aircraft giants often share the same view of technical details through advertising in the technical press .
now , before the dubai airshow , where the 77x was the first to be delivered with more than 100 orders , airbus is calling directly on the public .
recently , the company presented an ad that marked the beginning of a new ad war and could provide donors with a picture showing three people gathering .
&quot; boeing beats long-haul flights in seats that are more tighter than regional turbo props , &quot; says airbus sales chef john leahy .
given the changing dietary habits , people become thicker , but aircraft seats have not radically changed .
between the early 1970 ’ s , when the boeing 747 was the most modern long-distance journey , and the end of the century , the weight of the male average american between 40 and 49 years increased by 10 % .
the waist size of the male average american in the 21st century is , according to us health statistics , 100.8 cm .
airbus says its rival is keeping to a seat concept from the 1950s , when the average passenger comfort was about 30 % higher than the average body size of the newly baptized “ jet set ” .
the airbus said that there have been investigations , which have shown that an additional customs duty ( 2.54 cm ) per seat would reduce the quality of sleep by 53 % .
boeing denies the numbers of airbus to the seated and says it is not in the discretion of the manufacturers to decide how airlines will use the balance between air fares and equipment .
the company also states , according to research , that the experience in the aircraft is greater than the seat width .
“ it really amounts to giving airlines flexibility , so that they can do what they want to do , ” said the rapporteur .
they do not want us to dictate to them what they make profitable .
you know your business better than anyone .
for passengers , it is about more elbow freedom , but it will become increasingly difficult for manufacturers to deal with the issue of sales .
behind the fight is a race to order aircraft with an estimated volume of at least $ 700 billion to list prices in the coming decades , which is reflected in a sustainable impact on the us or europe ’ s export balance .
as reuters reported for the first time in july , the layout of the seat is the driving force behind the battle over the new aircraft .
both airbus and boeing claim 20 percent more efficiency per seat at their latest twin-engine long-haul design .
the statements by boeing on the results are partly based on the fact that the 77x with its ten seats per row is compatible with the original design of nine seats in the 777 .
the increased cost per unit is still lower than at present used machines with ten seats per row .
&quot; boeing is therefore squeezing more seats into his plane to make it more competitive with our products &quot; , says kevein keniston , head of passenger transport comfort at the european airways .
on the other hand , analysts say that full cabins with ten seats per row at existing 777s indicate that many passengers would be interested in the closer arrangement , which would be more expensive .
“ eighteen customs seats in the world would be great for passengers , but the reality is : from an economic point of view , the airbus a380 offer is threatened by the 777-series .
airbus and boeing do not offer seats , but a catalogue of suppliers .
the world traveller jet sellers even carry bandwidth to cover the equipment in the competition .
even if you are a guest at the comfort of your home , all manufacturers offer jet high-compressed jet jet engines for low-cost airlines and regional flights .
airbus offers an a350 with ten-seater aircraft , but , according to its own statement , it has not yet sold any .
until recently , airbus has stressed the importance of making cabins more adaptable and of providing a wide range of seats for some aircraft .
without the support of the only other manufacturer of large modern jet , experts say that the call for a new industry standard is likely to be shut down , but the wave of 77x sales is likely to distract .
new anti-nicotine vaccine could be a great help to the pleasure of smoking .
scientists have developed an anti-nicotine vaccine that will keep the fun of smoking out .
a single dose of the vaccine could cause mice to remain in the hands of nicotine addiction for a lifetime .
before human tests are carried out , further tests are needed , which may take some years to complete , but professor ronald crystal of the weill cornell medical college in new york said that the first results were good .
“ we are very hopeful that this type of vaccination strategy will once again help millions of smokers who have tried to stop and take advantage of all the methods available on the market .
the new vaccine contains a harmless virus that has been modified to cause the genetic modification of the infections .
the virus selectively infects the liver cells , which then generates a constant stream of antibodies .
antibodies hunt down the nicotine molecules in the blood and neutralize the disease , before they can use the brain .
in trials , vaccinated mice , who had been administered to nicotine , maintained their normal level of activity .
mice without vaccination , on the other hand , would have taken a “ time out ” , the researchers declared , a sign that nicotine has reached its brain .
the experiments are published in the journal science translational medicine .
earlier vaccines against tobacco failed , because they were antibodies to prevent the disease .
vaccinations had to be used to maintain the antibody level so often that the vaccination was tantamount to expensive and impractical .
but the cost of the new vaccine is likely to be significantly lower , because it transforms liver cells into antibody factories .
as professor crystal said , the european union could have a future vaccine for people who are quite certain that they are children .
more likely , however , smokers would use it to stop .
&quot; you know then : if you start smoking again , you will feel a lot of pain because of the nicotine vaccine .
british scientists said that the results were interesting , but at the same time warned that further research is needed .
tripodi denies , from obeid has been influenced to be .
against the former minister of the lab party joe tripodi from new south wales , an investigation is being carried out by the state corruption supervision .
the former nsw minister denies that maritime safety rules are not being applied at the request of his political mentor eddie .
the independent committee of the european commission ( eib ) is responsible for the implementation of the measures adopted by the european commission on friday .
now , because of the accusation , tripodi has been arrested by obid &apos;s hidden interest in the grounds .
in years of discussions , which began in 2005 , the government had insisted on public tenders for the lease contracts .
the peasants were against it and also wanted longer term .
in 2009 , the leasing contracts for companies were awarded to the circular quay , which awarded the above 2.5 million dollars a year , without any public tender .
tripodi , which will be open from february 2006 to november 2009 , was originally in favour of public tenders .
but he refused to accept the changes at the request of obeid , who , as tripodi confirmed , was on a reorganization of the lease arrangements of the government .
one of the icac telephone records showed talks from august and september 2007 between obeid , tripodi and steve dunn , a leading provider of the icac port ministry .
“ was that what was discussed in these telephone conversations the preparation of commercial leasing arrangements ? ” asked the deputy chief executive of andré-léonard , who is responsible for the matter .
&quot; no , &quot; tripodi replied .
i cannot remember what was discussed , but that was not the case .
definitely not between me and mr obeid .
israeli fighter planes attack targets in syria , but the official sources say that they are using official sources , such as official sources of the world , are not safe .
israeli hunting aircraft would have been an objective in syrian port of latakia on thursday night , confirmed a leading government employee to fox news .
the official did not explain what the aim was to do , but said that it was at least one .
according to the associated press , the aim was to produce russian sa-125 rockets .
at least twice this year , israel has already carried out airstrikes on missile supplies in syria .
foreign workers with 457 visas could be “ real test ” .
the government is thinking , within the framework of extended measures , about a “ real test ” for foreign workers with 457 visas .
if the test were to be introduced , it would have a criterion that would prevent the ban on 457 being used for filling unqualified jobs or being used as a back door for the immigration of family and friends to australia .
today , a proposal for discussion by the government was published after the former labour party mep maxine mckew has signed the comments of the government regarding foreign workers .
“ loud declarations like that foreigners should be standing in the back , ” and , australians first stop , are a very unpleasant backlash in times when trade unions are demanding a protected labor market , ” they said to the court .
historically , what was meant was that white workers were to be protected – and if some in the region had been echoed by this historical artefact , the whole thing would not surprise me .
the discussion proposal outlines twelve measures that were once adopted by the former immigration minister , chris bowen .
immigration minister brendan o &apos;connor , who was invited to talk yesterday about human smuggling in sri lanka , has identified five of the recommended amendments that other countries will be considered .
if the “ authenticity criterion ” is accepted , someone who has a visa could be sent to the country to check whether the visa is valid .
companies could also be required to account for the number of 457 visa holders .
meanwhile , a 35-year-old sri lankan asylum seeker probably died from a heart attack , after having been arrested this week with a refugee boat on the christmas island .
the disturbed nine-year-old son of the man who came with him to australia has been killed since his father &apos;s death on wednesday by an adult cousinn .
australian authorities brought the man to the christmas island hospital .
the british government has announced a study which will examine the benefits of the hs2 railway project for scotland .
in the work of hs2 ltd it is proposed to start with phase 1 in 2026 high-speed connections between scotland and ireland .
transport minister baroness kramer said that the project “ will bring britain closer together ” .
the scottish transport minister , keith brown , said that he was very pleased to work with the british government on this plan .
phase 1 consists of a new high-speed rail link between london and the west midlands .
after phase 2 , there will be connections to manchester and leeds .
in june , the government corrected the estimated cost of building the high-speed line between london and nordengland from 32.7 billion pounds to 42.6 billion pounds .
the british government , which was involved in talks with transport scotland , has called hs2 ltd to look for further capacity and travel time improvements for norway .
this includes the possibility of a travel time of three hours or less of glasgow and edinburgh to london .
baroness kramer said : “ our goal for hs2 is a truly national route network that brings great britain and its cities closer together . ”
we go with hs2 because it offers enormous advantages .
without it , we are facing a capacity crisis in our rail network .
but it is also about the link between 18 british cities , including glasgow and edinburgh , which have been improved thanks to hs2 .
the scottish secretary of state alistair carmichael commented : “ the announcement today is good news for scotland .
on behalf of the scottish government , keith brown carmichael called for the words “ unequivocal ” to be declared as the scottish integration into the hs2 network .
brown said , “ the high-speed rail link entails the potential for huge economic benefits for scotland , ireland , while providing a good infrastructure for the economy . ”
we are therefore pleased to be a partner of the british government and to make the options for a high-speed rail link in scotland possible , which will benefit everyone and will facilitate the connection between glasgow edinburgh , which is the scottish government .
i look forward to receiving the report of inquiry with british ministers next year .
regulations on electronic equipment in aircraft remain in force for the time being in australia .
australian passengers must continue to receive pills and smartphones when they start and land .
the us federal aviation administration ( fsa ) allows us airlines to fly their pre-conditions and to make passengers travel on their equipment during critical flight hours .
during most of the flight , passengers are already allowed to do so , but many people find it annoying that they are not allowed to travel on board when they start and land .
australian companies are watching the decision to implement the us airlines to buy a lot of work , and are not pursuing immediate plans to change their rules .
the air navigation agency casa also stated that it would take into account the announcement , but stressed that the restriction on the use of electronic equipment in critical air travel phases in australia remains unclear .
“ the casa does not have any specific regulations regarding the use of electronic equipment on the aircraft , ” said .
the subject is subject to rules that allow airlines to maintain safety at all times and to allow passengers to use the safety requirements provided by cabin crew .
virgin has already started with the casa talks about an extension of use of his wi-fi entertainment system on flights .
“ we would prefer a review of the authorisation of electronic devices by the casa , because we are convinced that this is a way to improve customer experience , now that we have ( wireless entertainment ) installed during the flight ” , said mr. barack obama .
qantas said that they will be available until further notice in the current regulations .
“ our current directives require electronic devices to be installed at the start and landing stage , and we currently have no plans to do so . ” he said .
faa rules apply to us airlines .
however , we are always interested in developments in regulations that passengers can benefit from and will be aware of the faa decision and the reasons behind it .
the decision has an impact on us companies depending on the age of the fleet .
they must prove that their aircraft have caused radio interference by mobile devices , and they must provide manuals , training materials , hand baggage programmes and customer instruction .
“ after an airline has shown the tolerance of its fleet , it can offer passengers the use of portable , light electronic devices such as tablets , e-book readers and smart phones .
in rare cases , when the eye is not on , the crew will instruct the passengers to use the equipment during the landing .
the group also recommended that heavier devices be used safely under the seat or in the subjects of the seats when they were started and landed .
in front of the regerby against schalke , bvb trailers with light-powered missiles had been equipped with ugly scenes in the veltins arena .
borussia dortmund announced that she would be forced to take the necessary steps .
before the friday match of the football bundesliga against the vfb stuttgart reacted to the ultras with a silence - first .
it was an unusual , almost speculative acoustics that was exposed to the viewer until just before the start of the bundesliga game between the german vice champion borussia dortmund and the vfb .
the main part of the audience was the guests ’ fans with their songs .
the south gallery , on the other hand , is where the most loyal of the loyal - and loudest - fans of bvb , initially presented themselves exceptionally quietly : no singings , no battle calls .
the podium of capo , which otherwise would have to coordinate the joint moisture , remained unfilled .
and right at the front of the gallery , lonely , a great flag blew with a label &quot; section stadium ban &quot; .
only as a goalkeeper roman weidenfeller as always the first bvb player to take the place , branded short-time cheer .
when his team colleagues followed , there were vocal vocals and flourishing scarves - but not everywhere .
the central blocks 12 and 13 of the south grandstand were full of hostility .
the fact that stadium spokesman norbert dickel once again describes the positive experiences of the last few days - derby victory , victory over arsenal , contract extension by trainer jürgen klopp - did not worry .
only five minutes before the whistle , the capo erupted his podium - and the hitherto almost with hands tangible tensions .
finally , as always , the south gallery was in the gallery - and finally there was again as usual the loudest place in the stadium .
and as soon as the first person to be attacked by the south grandstand , the loud call &quot; derby winner is up &quot; was again , as always .
the silence before that was probably a response to what has happened in recent days .
just before the vierderby at the fc schalke 04 some of the other bvb fans had light missiles in the spectators ’ ranks and placed on the square - and almost torchmen were rolled .
the game was played because of the chaotic scenes delayed .
bvb-boss hans-joachim watzke had the top of the dortmund ultras in his office .
&quot; it will be a massive challenge for the entire ultrasound movement , &quot; the bvb boss announced on thursday evening on a podium-discussion in frankfurt .
as a matter of urgency , watzke banned the ultras from performing a choreography for the home game against the vfb stuttgart .
&quot; i forbidden that , &quot; he explained .
zero tolerance is a key element in the development of the pyrotechnic sector .
in addition , the ultras have been shown various ways of punishing them - by tuesday they now have time to decide for one .
otherwise , he argues , the bargain will be deferred until the end of next week .
&quot; this will be drastic , &quot; watzke assured .
we can be curious about the reactions on the southern gallery .
deposit houses are booming in singapore , as the crisis in the middle class has arrived .
in a deposit house in the shopping centre of bendemeer in singapore janani amirthallinga exchanges a golden armreif , a ring and a few earrings to make the school fees of their children .
&quot; my husband and i have just bought a house , there is all my money in it , &quot; amirthallinga says .
although it has 3,000 singapore dollars ( about 1,730 euros ) every month as an administrative employee , and her husband also works , the monthly salary of the family does not suffice , it explains .
indeed , demand in parts of south-east asia – where debt in households is increasing – has been so large that valuemax , where it exceeds its exchange rate , will be the third deposit house this week .
the pledging of jewelry is not only a fast way to get money – 1,300 singapore dollars in the case of janani amirtthalinga – but also almost as cheap as a cheap way to buy a product .
typically , deposit houses in singapore demand effective annual interest rates of 17 % , which are only barely above the 15.4 % that the united overseas investment bank ( lfp ) demands .
however , deposit houses offer the advantage that no credit rating is verified or retained .
for this reason , millions of people in the region are turning to deposit houses after families have been subjected to pressure from rising living costs and increased household and consumer debt .
after five years of robust growth since the global financial crisis and cheap loans due to loose fiscal policies in developed economies , families with low income and middle class are looking for depositaries to help stotter families .
this week , the credit rating agency standard &amp; poor &apos;s growing household debt in the us , mainly due to rising mortgages , called a risk factor for the creditworthiness of asian banks .
malaysia , thailand , and singapore have , according to the agency ’ s assessment , the highest household debt in asia in relation to gdp .
malaysia is the world ’ s leading supplier of oil , accounting for 80 % of gdp , and a 60 % increase in 2008 .
economists worry about the high level of consumer debt in thailand , which is due to rise just this week from a technical recession .
on thursday , the data showed a continuing export-vigilance and a decline in consumer demand .
“ in the end , this means that , with rising costs , middle to lower people will be more likely to be less likely to be in the middle to lower classes of income .
historical peaks in gold prices over the past two years have increased the trend of pledging personal items .
in singapore , about 70 % of the pledged items are stored in the 200 deposit houses of the city state gold .
people say , “ gold prices look good , laugh , and let us be grandmother ’ s gold chain , and return next month . ”
the largest thai deposit house operator , easymoney , has in its branches in a 20-percent mortgage lending to the uk in recent months .
the growth in the deposit business is so strong that valuemax , the owner of the branch in bendemeer and 15 others in singapore , is not only able to export to neighbouring malaysia – where the company is located .
the company finances the company with 60 % of the 66 million singapore dollars it will be using this week with the sinhalese stock exchange .
while some lenders are being forced to cross the fire due to high interest rates , yeah says that deposit houses are not only cheaper interest rates than other lenders , but also not directly raise debt .
“ clients borrow items they already own , and the liquid personal information is used to increase the value of the household . ”
the deposit leasing business is increasingly seen as a short-term , secured financing in society .
nor are all the people who are using pfandleigh in financial difficulties .
rich people from singapore also come to the stores of valuemax to buy gold bars and rolex watches .
we have clients from all social backgrounds .
“ these include wealthy people who need to do something for a business or investment in the short term , or small businesses that are exposed to bottlenecks in cash flow , ” says yeah .
sometimes you just need money very quickly .
nsa collects data from google and yahoo - snowden will help to help snowden help .
the intelligence disclosure enthlers edward snowden has a fundamental interest in helping germany to enlighten the increasingly volatile nsa spähaffenies .
after presenting the federal green party member hans-christian böbele , it was his surprise that led to his meeting with snowden in russia , which conditions were required for ex-intelligence personnel to be brought before a german public prosecutor or prosecutor .
snowden has reacted to his complex legal situation , said ströbele to the ard magazine &quot; panorama &quot; .
bailout of eur 325 million from australia for tasmanian health care
the australian government insists on the tough conditions imposed by the bailout package of over 325 million australian dollars for the tasmanian health system .
federal health minister tanya plibersek has announced that the commonwealth will be “ taking immediate action ” to prevent a crisis .
the funding for a period of four years was increased after consultations with the independent tasmanian mep andrew wilkie .
“ the government has created an emergency rescue package , ” said the government , which we believe will address the unique challenges facing the federal state in the coming years . ”
the 325 million dollar mark is a package of 31 million dollars in emergency aid to the country ’ s electoral output .
the company has also been involved in several 2600 operations , including orthopaedic operations and treatments for cataract .
moreover , there is money for day-care clinics in hobart and launceston , better post-patient care after stationary stays , and the training of specialist staff , mental health services and the introduction of a system of electronic surveillance .
“ these investments are in line with the ideas that i have been affected by clinics , who have said that they are the best way to improve the tasmanian health system , ” said tanya plibersek .
the minister insisted on a strict reporting and accountability procedure .
the state must keep the current level of funding in order to get money from the commonwealth , and monthly loans must be made to report where the additional money has been spent .
a three-member commission will be set up to ensure that the state will provide health services as effectively and efficiently as possible .
like wilkie today , the 325 million dollars would be of little use if “ they were not accompanied by real reforms that would make the tasmanian public health system sustainable . ”
nevertheless , he praised the government for responding to his request for urgent help , which he had initially sent to the prime minister at the beginning of may .
“ i am confident that federal aid will make a major contribution to improving public health systems in the state of the state from the list of concerns , ” said wilkie .
according to the government of the state , these election benefits will largely reflect the recent cuts .
but the health policy spokesman of the opposition at federal level , peter dutton , believes that today &apos;s announcement is only a “ plaster over the past . ”
“ we are therefore in the present situation because the laboratory state government has allocated $ 430 million from the health system ” , said he said to abc tv .
it is not acceptable for a government of the state to pay nearly half a billion dollars out of the system and for the commonwealth to invest 300 million and then pretend that it is good news .
dutton called for plibersek to guarantee that not a single dollar of the bailout for additional bureaucracy would be spent .
guillaume nicloux &apos; adaption of the novel by denis diderot impresses with its extraordinary production equipment and contemporary details , but is also more difficult to find than necessary .
the &quot; monumental &quot; action , which was played in france in the 1760s , tells the exciting story of suzanne , a young nobleman sent by her family to the monastery .
when she rebelled , she was confronted with the extreme cruelty of an extremely sadistic upper and becomes the object of erotic fascination of another .
the film never slides into liars or sensationalism – and in this his problem lies .
the solemn seriousness with which the film is told makes it a popular place for the audience .
syria has lost its ability to manufacture chemical weapons , such a surveillance group would have to put in place a panel of inspectors to monitor the situation .
syria has important facilities for producing chemical weapons and gitftgas ammunition destroyed , the global surveillance group on chemical weapons declared on thursday , while it was in the north of the country to have serious clashes near one of the two .
on thursday , a syrian activist group also announced that more than 120,000 people have died since the civil war began three years ago .
the announcement by the organisation for the ban on chemical weapons ( opcw ) came one day before the deadline of 1 january 2010 , when the commission announced its intention to ban them .
1 november , which the conference of presidents of the hague based organisation , damascus , set up to replace all the facilities for producing chemical weapons or to replace them “ inoperable ” , including all machines for mixing chemicals .
the conclusion of this process , which is basically the first stage of destruction , is an important milestone in an ambitious timetable for the implementation of the destruction of all chemical weapons .
the destruction of facilities means that syria cannot create new chemical weapons .
damascus , however , still has to start using the weapons and stocks available .
it is believed that there are about 1,000 tonnes of chemicals and weapons in the country , including mustard gas and nerve gas sarin .
the announcement came at a time when , on thursday , fighting in the city of safira took place , which experts say that there is a production facility for chemical weapons and storage facilities .
the activists who have a network of activists in syria have reduced the number of deaths , declared on thursday , 120.296 people had died .
of these , 61,067 civilians , including 6,365 children .
the government has had 29,954 of them belonging to president bashar assad &apos;s army , 18,678 being pro-government fighters and 187 lebanese hitchcock soldiers .
also among the dead were 2,202 deserted army soldiers and 5,375 fighters of the opposition , many of them foreigners .
on 25 july , the un estimated the number of deaths in this conflict since march 2011 to 100,000 .
this figure has not been updated .
the conflict has left some two million people fleeing the country .
assad ’ s troops have been fighting in safira for weeks against the rebels , many of whom have links to al-qaeda groups .
the observatory said that it suffered losses on both sides on thursday , but did not say any details .
the fighting underlines the danger that the chemical weapons inspectors are exposed to , because their mission to liberate syria from its poisonous arsenal of weapons is a race against time in the midst of a raging civil war .
the opcw , which is closely linked to the united nations , says that the team is “ now convinced that it can meet all the major production and mixing / filling standards mentioned by syria and that it is experiencing destruction . ”
therefore , ‘ no further inspection activities are planned at the moment ’ .
earlier this week , the inspectors said they had launched the first round of checks and that they had completed 21 of the 23 of the sites mentioned by damascus .
due to security concerns , the visit of two institutions was not possible , the inspectors said .
on thursday , the opwc said that the two sites are not in the open , according to syrian statement .
it was not immediately clear whether the site in safira was one of the two facilities that the opcw inspectors could not visit .
syria has drawn up a plan for the complete destruction of its chemical weapons , which will be adopted next month by the opwc executive committee .
&quot; i prefer to be a brave and passionate man , who is all in charge of fulfilling the most challenging mission ever undertaken by this organisation .
for three years now , the mostly sunni muslim rebels have been fighting assad ’ s government and its security forces in this civil war , which has left many members of the alawites , in the secession of shia islam .
with regard to further developments , the head of the observatory said that rami abdurrahman , there was a strong explosion on wednesday in an air defence facility in the syrian coastal province of latakia .
the cause of the explosion was not known , he explained .
anger at bombings by bali
survivors and relatives of the 202 people who died in 2002 during the bali bomb attack were the victims of the attacks .
patek , who was one of the most popular and respected people in south-east asia on the run for almost ten years , was yesterday awarded the prize for his role in the construction of explosives for the bomb attack .
with a suspension of penalties , it could be dismissed after 15 years .
the 45-year-old was sentenced to mass murder for the alleged attack on two night clubs in the popular tourist resort area of kuta , where he was killed by 202 people , including 88 australians .
a guilt was also made in a number of terrorist charges against the united states , including a wave of explosive weapons .
the prosecutor had a life sentence , but he was not prosecuted for the man who was sentenced to death for his reputation as a masterful bomber builder .
the decision has painful memories of june corteen , who is a mother of perth who has lost her 39 year-old twin towers , jane and jenny , in the patek family .
with tears , she said , patek had become dead .
i really think it should be read in the footsteps of the other guys .
“ it should be warned of being shot , ” he said .
i have to live with the fact that i cannot get any more grandchildren and i never see my daughters again .
the sari club was made to the ground when on october 12 , 2002 , a massive crowd of bombs was buried in a small truck , which was in front of the club .
peter hughes was in paddy &apos;s bar where only 20 seconds earlier a suicide bomber arrived at a sprawl .
he fell into a state of emergency for a month after the attack and “ died ” three times while he was on a life preservation system .
hughes said patek deserved the same fate as the other three members of the jemaah islamiah terrorist cell – amrozi , mukhlas , and imam samudra – who were responsible for the disease .
really , this type should above all receive the death penalty .
to keep it alive – no , there is no reason to keep it alive .
to get 20 years after he killed 202 people and killed many hundreds of people is not much .
patek is the last of the bali bombers to be tried .
he almost escaped the arrest of a decade , but was eventually arrested in january 2011 in the pakistani city of abbottabad , where us forces were forced to resume former al-qaeda chief , osama bin less than four months later .
during the negotiation , an fbi agent said that secret service reports would make the point that the security council had not been in pakistan .
&quot; he did not stand up , &quot; said corteen .
until recently , he has shown no repentance for the suffering he inflicts on other people .
the judgment was made before the ten-year anniversary of the attack this year , which was marked by commemorations in bali and australia .
“ there will be many tears this year , ” said corteen .
patek may still appeal against his judgment .
faa : passengers can now buy electronic equipment in aircraft ( but no mobile phone calls ) .
passengers can now benefit from a free flight from the departure to landing , to read , work , play , listen to music and watch films , but not to travel with the mobile phone , so the new guidelines that are to be adopted on thursday .
but passengers should not expect these changes to be implemented immediately .
how quickly they would be implemented depends on the airline concerned , explained faa staff michael huerta on a press conference .
airlines must be able to prove to the faa that aircraft comply with the new rules and that they have read the flight instruction manuals and the regulations governing the storage of equipment in accordance with the new regulations .
the faa has stated that it has already received plans from some airlines to ban the use of portable electronic equipment in aircraft .
among these airlines , delta and jetblue were also .
“ depending on the state of the plan , we could use the extended use of electronic devices very soon , ” said faa in a statement that it was not .
at present , passengers must use smartphones , tablets and other devices when aircraft are being closed .
you may not restart it until the plane has reached a height of three kilometers and the captain has given the green light .
when entering the landing strip , passengers must return to their seats and must not restart them before the plane is landed .
under the new directives , airlines whose aircraft are protected against electronic disturbances could provide passengers with the opportunity to use the equipment even when they are on board , even when they are on the runway .
most new aircraft and other aircraft , which are essential for the use of wi-fi in larger heights , are now in service .
laura glading , president of professional association of professional cabin crew , welcomed the changes .
“ if the new regulation is implemented safely – and we are working closely with the airline in this regard – both sides will benefit , ” glading commented .
we are quite honestly tired of being too obsessed with this issue .
however , internet connections to surf , exchange email , text messages or download files remained under three kilometre .
passengers are asked to purchase smartphones , tablets and other devices in flight mode .
so still no word with friends !
and heavier devices like laptops must continue to be dusty , as they pose a risk of injury if they are flying through the cabin .
mobile calls during the flight will also remain prohibited .
the regulatory competence for telephone calls lies with the federal communications commission .
faa may lift a ban on certain electronic devices at start and landing on the mobile phones at startup and landing .
last month mark rosenker said of the national transport safety authority that the national transport safety board , safety experts for national transport issues on cbs news , mobile phones would still be considered a risk .
“ mobile phone is really a problem , not only because they potentially interfere with navigation devices , but because we are dependent on the fcc to know that the transmission from the air is also transmitting masts . ”
a consultative committee of the industry , led by the faa to study this issue , has been recommending that the industry should be given a clear , more effective use of personal electronic equipment .
in recent years , pressure on factories has increased , restrictions on trade in goods and services have been eased .
critics such as the democratic senator claire mccaskill from missouri believe that it is possible to have no valid security reasons for banning the ban .
the restrictions are also increasingly difficult to enforce , because the use of equipment has become ubiquitous .
some studies suggest that the level of the disease is up to a third of passengers who are unable to switch off the device .
the faa began in 1966 to ban the use of electronic equipment by air passengers after reports of disturbances in navigation and communication equipment were published by passengers .
new aircraft are much more dependent on electrical systems than previous generations of aircraft , but they are also so constructive that they are dependent on faa .
airlines offer passengers a wide range of wi-fi internet access for a number of years , when the flight is reached .
the software , which is adapted to wi-fi systems , is also insensitive to the interference of the aircraft .
the vast majority of passenger aircraft should be designed for greater use of electronic equipment according to the new directives , as huerta said .
today &apos;s electronic equipment generally produces much less radiant radiation than previous generations .
e-reader , for example , only yields minimal radiation when you flip .
but downloading or sending data requires the transfer values to be higher .
those who advocate relaxing restrictions on the use of equipment include the use of the new amazon.com.
in 2011 , company employees invited a passenger aircraft full of kindle e-reader and made a test flight to investigate problems that could be detected but not found .
members of the faa advisory committee expressed their views on mixed feelings , which increased the risk of using equipment .
douglas kidd from the passenger association national association of airline passengers .
other committee members said that there is only a few isolated reports from pirates .
the committee recommended that the faa should , however , allow pilots to travel to the united states on instrument landing under poor visibility conditions .
a group from the travel industry welcomed the changes and called them reasonable and appropriate adjustment for travellers who are now travelling extensively equipped with technology .
“ we are pleased that the faa recognizes that a pleasant passenger experience does not conflict with safety , ” said roger dow , ceo of the u.s. trade show association .
by air rescue service from nordsee drilling island , sailed bird , returned to the island of ibiza .
a car parked by air service to the coast is a very popular way of getting to know the island .
the water ral was closed last month with a helicopter to aberdeen , where it was taken from the scottish animal welfare organisation spca in their rescue centre in alloma .
colin seddon , head of the center , said , “ this water purse was probably a winter migratory bird from northern europe that was caused by the strong winds above the north sea . ”
it seems that the exhausted bird was looking for refuge on the drill island .
he added , “ he could not continue flying , which is why we asked for help . ”
when they were released , the water ral was fit and healthy again .
is europe ’ s elite prepared to do business with britain ?
business for britain was founded in april with the intention of bringing the economy together and of bringing it to a conclusion , which is what those who in britain want to bring wealth and work in our relations with the eu want to change .
to this end , we have created the largest and most comprehensive survey among british economic leaders and have asked them what they think about britain , the economy , and the eu .
yougov inquired about 1,000 executives from the economy who had roughly the british company sizes , sectors , and regions .
the results of the survey will surprise many .
we have found that the vast majority of companies have now grown outside europe and are relying on countries that need to modernise and grow , while the states in the eu are stagnating .
they want to see a new trade relationship with countries like china , india , and brazil favoured by government , rather than dealing with the long and exhausting process that has been the arcane eu institutions .
asked for your opinion on certain issues regulated by law – from cartel law to product legislation – the majority of economic leaders in the world believe that control of these key competences should be exercised in westminster .
there was widespread dissatisfaction with the internal market , as companies say that the cost of the brussels rules has now been outweighed by the benefits of being part of europe &apos;s trade area – even 40 % of large companies agreed .
finally , and probably most importantly , our evidence of the survey of economic leaders showed that a clear majority of people would like to see britain move towards a change in the agreement and establish a relationship with the eu based on trade , not politics .
this realization , which is reflected in companies of all sizes and leading companies , shows that the economy is heading for a “ meaningful change ” that the leitmotif of action brings back to britain .
it is a lot – an amendment to the agreement and better conditions for britain would lead to a 16 % change of opinion in favour of remaining in the eu in a referendum .
the prime minister should have no doubt : this survey shows that the british economy is lagging behind his plan for renegotiating the british conditions for eu membership .
it also shows that companies are dependent on a renegotiation to clearly shift their balance of power back to britain .
a better deal for the british economy is possible and , increasingly , necessary after the eurozone has joined the euro zone in the direction of closer economic and fiscal union .
the priority must be jobs and growth in britain , as the result of our survey shows , what increased attention is being given to businesses to trade and a fundamental change in the brussels approach to rules .
alexei miller of gazprom calls pipeline in bulgaria the beginning of a new gas era in bulgaria as the beginning of a new gas era in the new gas era .
construction of the south stream pipeline is under way in bulgaria , starting a new one for one of the largest european energy projects , gazprom ’ s board of directors declared .
“ today ’ s event is a milestone : the construction work on the bulgarian section of the south stream gas pipeline , the largest and most important project in europe , has begun , ” said the ceo of gazprom .
the project is a key element in the energy security of the whole of the european continent .
south stream is to ensure greater diversity in russia &apos;s export routes through europe .
a dispute between gazprom and its counterparts in ukraine , where the euro is largely a source of gas for europe , is a serious matter .
miller said that the direct link to bulgaria , a member of the european union , meant that the costs associated with transit countries would be much higher “ forever . ”
bulgarian consumers receive gas from south stream at a reduced rate , if the entire project is to be operational in 2015 .
gazprom says that construction works in other subordinate countries should be carried out on the planned route at the end of the year .
the pipeline is limited to an annual capacity of 62.3 billion cubic metres of natural gas .
for national and international investors , there is no way around the german real estate site .
the economic framework data are right , and the funding possibilities are excellent .
this is the thrust of the 9th real estate day of the börsen newspaper .
german real estate markets benefit from the economic strength and the economic recovery costs , which are good in europe .
christian ulbrich , ceo of europa , has pointed this out to africa by jones lang lasalle , on the 9th day of the börsen newspaper ’ s real estate day .
how do german commercial properties need to be listed , show the view of the volume of transactions , according to ulbrich .
in the first three quarters of this year , the share of gdp rose by 31 % compared to the previous year ’ s section .
in britain , the plus was only 6 % , in france , 19 % .
&quot; real estate investments offer attractive interest rates &quot; , said ulbrich .
the return gap between real estate and government bonds is on a historically high level .

hearing before the royal commission : two ymca staff in front of accusations against jonathan lord for sexual offences .
two ymca employees from new south wales ( nsw ) were arrested for sexual offences associated with children .
but the opening statement before the commission did not take into account the ymca ’ s statement that ‘ never had an incident of sexual abuse in the organisation at all . ’
managing director phillip hare was consulted on a case in which a ymca employee was convicted of offences involving child pornography .
hare said gail furness , one of the assisting lawyers of the commission , that he was aware of the first case , the second but not known .
he admitted that the opening declaration of the ymca to the commission was also inaccurate in claiming that ‘ it was external experts who carried out external inspections of the ymca in which the ymca was found to be at the front .
evidence to the commission is that the ymca is informed about how the ymca is the second lowest assessment of four possible cases in a quality audit of the department of economic and monetary affairs .
hardy , who was 21 at the ymca , admitted that the management had “ been led by me down . ”
lord was arrested early this year for sexual offences against twelve boys during his two-year term of office for the ymca .
he was sentenced to at least six years in prison .
but hare denied that the ymca is a cultural problem , which employees are prevented from using the lords offences in relation to the safety of children .
the staff said they had observed violations , including the fact that lords alone could not cope with children , but they were able to keep them privately as babysitters , let them sit on their lap , said that he was .
danielle ockwell , whose chief lord was and is still seeking a training for the child protection , was a member of the committee on legal affairs and the internal market , saying that child services were concerned about child abuse .
the managing director said he would not accept statements by employees that they are not dared to pay their executive notice .
instead , he said , they have lost their friendship with lord their judgment .
haere explained that he has advised the board of the ymca nsw to state his view that the lesson the organization learns from the jonathan lord ’ s incident is to be learned .
hare said the decision to force employees to sign confidentiality obligations shortly after the accusations occurred was a decision taken by the director of the child services of the ymca , liam whitley .
he said that this should prevent contamination of the evidence , but that is “ over-zealous ” and badly implemented .
the ymca nsw was in the time when jonathan lord was in charge of the building between 2009 and 2011 , no organization safe for children , professor stephen smallbone said of the griffith university .
he explained that there is “ serious problems ” in recruiting , verifying , including training , and recruiting supervisors .
the hearing was postponed until 20 december .
tony blair stated that he would have the chance to return as british prime minister – but admits that a comeback is unlikely .
in an interview tonight on the occasion of the fifth anniversary of his leaving the office , the president of the 59-year-old announced his views on various domestic issues .
since his resignation in june 2007 , after a decade of leadership , blair has largely avoided becoming british prime minister .
when asked whether he would like to be appointed prime minister , i would like to ask him whether he was going to be re-elected from the evening standard from london , saying ‘ yes , safe , but it is unlikely that that will happen ... ’
when the horse show experts met in droves in cardiff , they were able to put the horse back of the year , they knew that a hard horse would be a battle .
but no one was on the three-year-old fenton kirkland prepared .
the knirps , which has not even been in the kindergarten and only made its first steps a few months ago , and its shetland pony toffee traded loosely through the three rounds and retripled the course .
the inseparable pair , both equal , were forced to leave the country because of their occurrence , behavior , and style .
in his performance in competition with men and women with elegant melons , he had his leghold cap in a cheeky angle and led the two years old daughter of the toffee through the ring .
fenton was chosen by the jurors for his natural abilities in dealing with the pony , which goes well beyond his age .
and toffee received bestmarks for his appearance and personality .
fenton had visited toffee last march as a gift for his third birthday and since then , every day , he has been practicing with the shetland pony .
his mother , donna , 30 , said : “ fenton and toffee are a great chord . ”
they had to fight against the entire field and are equipped with goldpokal and rosette from the square .
it was only the second time that he was working with toffee in a competition and we were all delighted that he was won .
completely strangers in the arena thought him so phenomenal that he could not be photographed with him .
the little boy from the village nantyglo near ebbing , near the vale , south wales , follows in the footsteps of his aunt sharon howell , who has been in horse for more than ten years .
howell ’ s story told : “ the whole audience was electrified and everyone fired and lamented him . ”
he ran on sand the entire length of the arena and although he was so tiny he was not able to make fantastic work .
fenton is crazy about animals – he loves horses , tractors and farms and has two hens of chickens to look around .
as it is started , it will not take long for it to be on the “ horse of the year ” show – and i am sure that it will be well done .
a spokesman of the annual horse show said : “ fenton is only three , but he knows how to deal with his pony . ”
together they are a great team .
the jury evaluated fenton and toffee for how well they had beaten themselves and performed in the performance ring .
they are looking for good cooperation between pony and leader – and here , fenton and toffee were the best in the ring .
i am sure that fenton &apos;s sweet clothes will have played their part in making it really perfect for the occasion .
chinese newspaper is to be “ reformed ” after calling for a “ reform ” of china ’ s newspaper .
a chinese newspaper , on the front page , calling for the release of a reporter who was arrested for defamation , has been accused of being defamed , has declared a press review .
the guangzhou based company , the new express , had a rare public call for the release of the journalist chen yongzhou .
but chen later admitted on television that he had taken up bribes to send reports of a supranational company .
now the new express will be a “ comprehensive rectification ” , the regulatory authority declared .
the “ rectification order ” came from the authority for press and publications , radio , film and television in guangzhou .
preliminary investigations have shown that the council &apos;s new express , the express route to the yangcheng evening news group , is between september 2012 and august 2013 to be found to contain several inaccurate reports on the listed company .
“ editorial management of the new express was disordered , ” the regulator announced in a statement .
she said that she decided to ‘ impose administrative punishment for chen yongzhou ’ and to give him his report-licence ’ .
in addition , “ the yangcheng evening news group ” has instructed to provide a full rectification of the new express and recommended to inform the relevant managers at the new express and to immediately inform the management team of the new express .
chen had several articles for the new express , in which he wrote about alleged financial irregularities with a manufacturer of construction machinery called zoomlion .
after being arrested , he published a paper on the death penalty .
but then chen appeared on state television and admitted that he was making false reports against pay .
“ in this case i have appreciated zoomlion , as well as the entire news industry and its ability to win the public ’ s trust , ” he explained to the state news station cctv .
i have done so primarily because i am looking for money and glory .
i have realised that i have acted incorrectly .
following chen ’ s apology , the new express issued an apology on the front page , explaining that it was missed .
various suspects have recently been arrested and sentenced to death on television .
experts say that confessions are still routine , and that the only way to get them right at the beginning of the year is to ban the authorities from exporting people to buy themselves .
drug tunnel with own railway between the us and mexico discovers the potential of a new type of drug tunnel between mexico and mexico .
one of the most sophisticated tunnels for drug smuggling between the us and mexico , which is completely equipped with lighting , ventilation and electrical railway operations , is now closed .
the us authorities described the 120 times 90 centimeters tunnel as a major source of information for the european union .
the tunnel that is in the zigzag pattern , which is about six football fields , connects warehouses in the vicinity of tijuana , mexico , and san diego , usa .
there are countless unseemingly endless shores in the area , making it easier to cope with drug-loaded lorries .
the tunnel has been closed before drugs are transported undetected , but the authorities have said that .
the discovery of the tunnel made eight and a half tonnes of marijuana and 148 kilograms of cocaine , so the recordings of the court were secured .
three men , according to the authorities , who worked as drivers , were arrested for possessing and selling marshal and the kokain intended .
they face the threat of imprisonment in the event of a guilt of between ten years and life .
in nogales , arizona , smugglers are relying on an extensive underground network of drainage channels .
the tunnel is the eighth large passage that has been in san diego since 2006 .
some of the largest tunnels were built after the marijuana harvest in central mexico in october , which made the drug cartels challenging , as they can quickly bring their product to consumers .
in 2010 , authorities found a 640 metre long passage with rails , which was taken from a kitchen in a residential house in tijuana to two storehouses in san diego .

veganism , according to lexicas , is subject to vegetarianism , but differs from this in quite a significant way .
because while vegetarians are eating food from sahne-cake , ice or a strong eda-herb , these poor people are not on the menu .
milk , cheese , egg , besides giving up meat and fish , the vegan leaves the vegan with all the food from animal products - even honey .
what remains , one might wonder , but when you look at it , vegan nutrition is characterised by a considerable degree of ingenuity .
&quot; bread sticks are very popular &quot; , explains ute henkelmann , the owner of the hisican reform house , who has a variety of special products for vegan .
also reuben proctor visits the shop in the cathedral street .
for 13 years , the native new zealand , vegan , has lived in lampertheim ( almost ) everything he has to do . &quot; in 1997 i presented my diet and became a vegetarian .
at the turn of the century , the next step was taken and i became vegan .
&quot; but the conviction came not only because of food , but because of footwear selection , &quot; proctor says , the artificial leather ordinary leather prefers normal leather .
he realized that there were also problems in other everyday matters without animal products .
vegan is a group of people who have a strong sense of ethics .
&quot; i do not want animals to die for me , &quot; says proctor the maxim of vegans , who are focused on the whole consumption behaviour .
instead of burgers , stirrers or rubber bears , the european union has a new vegan experience .
&quot; it is a double bonus , &quot; proctor says today , &quot; actually , vegan does not make his renunciation , not an ascence , but rather an enrichment &quot; .
and it is precisely these conditions that have left many well-intentioned attempts to fail .
&quot; the addictive factor is a very decisive factor that leaves many quickly abandoned , just like smoking , &quot; proctor makes a comparison .
and if one applies : &quot; certain tastes are not fixed at the animal &quot; .
often it is the spices or the type of preparation that make up the taste .
&quot; you can also use the same effect in other ways , &quot; explains the vegan .
a barbecue will take place at proctor , for example , in the open air , in the mushrooms and in the vegan cups .
it takes care of balanced , varied diet , where there is a good deal of fat .
of course , you want to have something between your teeth , that is legitimate .
&quot; it should taste , but that is not only animal food , but also food , &quot; said proctor .
health damage , including eating disorders , further widespread assumption , has not been suffered .
for me , the changeover has had a positive aspect .
i don &apos;t take a foreign cholesterol and have a higher vitamin content .
there are high performance satellites that are exclusively nutritional to vegan .
&quot; my blood values are good , i often let myself check , &quot; he tells proctor .
in particular , the lack of vitamin b12 warns many vegansius critics .
&quot; since animals are fed with feedingstuffs rather than being fed on pastures , it is questionable whether there is a proper meat in the meat that is being bought in the refrigerator .
for vegans , there is also the possibility to use the coenzyme in the form of tablets .
&quot; my b12 values are fine , &quot; he explains .
the main reason for this is that proctor has to go far in the area of food procurement .
basic foodstuffs are available everywhere and every supermarket has now produced soya milk and other products .
all i need is a very good idea .
only occasionally i buy something special .
&quot; many people overlook that just the finished products are expensive , but so behaves like that in &quot; ordinary &quot; finished products known to be the same . &quot;
in any case , the preparation of vegan dishes is much cheaper and less time-consuming than the usual presumption .
&quot; in the kitchen there is a lot to discover , with a few small kniffes you can buy good , if not partially better results , &quot; proctor says .
margarine instead of butter , a little more baking powder and carbonic acid instead of egg , with its vegan cheese cakes , proctor could also amaze his parents-in-law .
family celebrations give vegan a new spice .
this has dynamism when you cook together , it has a new significance .
&quot; the situations that can arise are so different as the people themselves , &quot; says proctor .
of course , he has already been met with scepticism .
does my food not taste you ?
&quot; should i feel bad now because i drink milk ? &quot; - when i do that , i have to ask as a vegan to be fingerprinted .
&quot; i do not deny people , i am part of this society , &quot; proctor does not want to be an enclave .
and , more precisely , the everyday world does not seem so veganistic as it is suspected - and vegan does not seem so restricted in everyday life as it is generally assumed .
fast food is also allowed .
pomes gibt es ganz !
&quot; many döner shops offer falafel , or even a vegetarian yufka , &quot; proctor says .
in a pizzeria he switches to pasta dishes , or just orders a pizza without cheese , everything a question of habit .
the restaurants are slowly starting to face it .
&quot; when i started 13 years ago vegan became a diet , everything was still much more difficult &quot; , the novelist can take a development that will help to make the world more comfortable .
&quot; if enough enquiries are made , they may be inclined to make an addition to the menu , &quot; he hopes .
vegan restaurants develop , such as combustion in mannheim or the café vogelfrei .
proctor wants to see other restaurants at least have a vegan dish on the menu .
in fact , vegan dishes are there for everyone .
everyone can eat it , so they are exactly the opposite of exclusive .
&quot; meat dishes are exclusive , on the other hand , in the truest sense of the word , because they exclude others , &quot; proctor notes .
&quot; when you avoid food scandals , veganism is a safe way to prevent the vast majority of all the prejudices . &quot;
vegan purchases may , however , be a little difficult at the beginning .
especially when you learn to understand that is also in peanuts animal additives as color encoders , you seem to be satisfied with observing the ethics on so many hurdles and fast fall the courage to leave .
not only because of this , reuben proctor and lars thomsen have written a book : &quot; veganissimo - animal ingredients and their alternatives &quot; explains the many ingredients that make up food but also cleansing .
&quot; gradually , a scanner view is developed and white is the characters and logos to be observed &quot; it is sometimes better to take small steps than standing on the screen or to stumble &quot; , says proctor .
veganism , it is an important moral finger , which is aimed at consciousness .
perhaps he will not quite manage to change his habits , but at least he can help consumers to make their habits critical .

tax on foreign property owners against london &apos;s bubble
the treasury has provisionally issued the cgt measure , but is still waiting for the final decision .
already , the revenue from the stamp tax on housing in the districts of western minster and kensington &amp; chelsea exceeds the tax rate of 2012 / 13 at 708 million pounds .
cook said , “ after the stempl-tax increases on high-price housing and the introduction of the associated legislation against a circumvent , it is hard to say that high quality properties are too low taxed , regardless of the impact .
“ but this move could be a reluctant move by some foreign investors in buying real estate in london , or by preventing owners from selling them , ” he added .
first class real estate – the top five to ten percent of the housing market at price – in the wealthy southwest belt of london , which is bordered by fulham to wimbledon , has grown around the corner .
central london prices were uniform , for example , at 5.5 % per year , but were not adjusted by an emerging “ infantry market . ”
scientists could shed more light on the context in which the pregnancy of a dog is related to its mood .
earlier research showed that gambling is a very good way to get a better chance of getting a good dog .
but now scientists say that other dogs will not accept these subtle differences and can respond to them .
professor georgio vallortigara , a neuroscientist at the university of trento , said : “ it is well known to humans that the left and right half of the brain can react differently to stimuli , positive or negative .
here we have tried to take this on board other species .
he also noted that in dogs , just like in humans , the right half of the brain is responsible for movement on the left side and vice versa , and that the two hemispheres have different roles in emotions .
to learn more about how dogs can be pushed on the side tail sleeve of their companions , the forcibly supervised the animals while these films were being shown by other dogs .
they measure the heart rate of the four-legs and analyzed the behaviour .
we will probably soon understand why the tail is getting into one , sometimes in the other .
professor vallortigara said : “ we have seen the dogs movies with dogs – either a natural or a true version of the dog .
when the animals saw how an otherwise volatile dog had to take the tail to the right ( from the perspective of the wearing dog ) , the dog was left with a completely relaxed breath .
but was the cock tendency mainly to the left ( again from the dog &apos;s perspective , the dog wedelt ) , their heart rate increased and they saw unrest .
professor vallortigara commented that the dogs do not intentionally communicate with each other through these movements .
it is rather convinced that the dogs have learned from experience , which movements they feel concerned about .
he said , ‘ if you have different encounters with other dogs and you want to make weaving with the tail in a direction more linked to friendly behavior and the right side is a less friendly behavior , then you are responding on the basis .
researchers say that the findings hounded dog owners who had been using them , vets and trainers , to understand the emotions of their animal .
john bradshaw , expert for dog behaviour and hospitality grants , has been working on the faculty of animal health at the university of bristol , which said that this was not the first study to be examined whether it was necessary .
last year a team of the university of lincoln found that dogs had to turn their head to the left when they had an aggressive dog , and to the right when it was a breeding dog .
in another research at the university of victoria in canada , the following was : “ dogs go to a robot dog rather than a dog . ”
according to his statement , the differences could be caused by the dogs being the animals in the films. the robot-dog is not considered as dogs .
a study of how dogs are responding to real dogs could help , he explained .
“ while there is considerable evidence for many different mammals that the two brains are responsible for various purposes , the two have to be considered in detail .
but as their behavior is simply recorded , it will probably not take long before we understand that the problem is not a problem .

pope francis appointed the president of the republic of cyprus in february .
pope francis will be arrested for the first time on 22 february for new cardinals of the catholic church , as the vatican announced on thursday .
cardinals are the most senior clerics in the catholic church after the pope and they are the ones who have a pope .
there are currently 201 cardinals .
however , a cardinal who has an age of 80 can no longer participate in the pope election – the result is a group of 120 “ eligible voters . ”
in a statement that announces the news , pater federica said lombardi that a speaker of the vatican was saying that it would be a meeting of all cardinals before the ceremony was held .
“ pope francis decided to reconsider his decision to convene the consistent story of the february 2010 congress .
jack valero of catholic voices said that the number of electoral elites in the cardinals was likely to have fallen by february .
he explained that a pope usually appoints as many cardinals as necessary to ensure that the number of eligible voters is reduced .
the consistency story next year is important because it is a key first since the election of france ’ s president in march this year .
there is a certain overhang on the part of europe at the moment , and particularly italy .
“ it will be interesting to see if the new pope cardinals came from the rest of the world , to make the balance clear , ” he said .
forty per cent of catholics live in south america , but they have only a tiny number of cardinals .
the cardinals will also be the first to have been awarded the prize since the formation of the council of cardinals , founded by francis , a group of eight cardinals from all over the world who have been appointed .
in the past , the pope decided everything alone .
&quot; now francis has the eight cardinals chosen to give him a helping hand , &quot; said valero .
he said it was “ possible ” that francis was the cardinal of the order to advise .
but so far we have not been in this situation – that is all quite new .
valero said that typically the biblical bishops come from large places to cardinals , but stick francis &apos;s “ full of surprises – we know not what he is .

general motors calls almost 19,000 of his brand new chevrolet silveradobe and gmc sierra pickup trucks with construction year 2014 to solve a problem with manual deceleration of seat .
some of the cars may have a defect in the mechanism for the restraint of the front seat backrest .

the delivery of gm trucks began in june and represents the most important model launch of the leading american car manufacturer since the insolvency restructuring in 2009 .
gm informed vehicle owners in the first october half of the year about the defect .
the nhtsa was unable to reach a compromise because of the 16-day government shutdowns , which had a negative impact on car sales .

desperation cry from an obama electorate
i have elected president obama twice in the hope that change will be possible .
he says obama has commendable efforts to address the blockade detail of the republican party .
the blocking policy does not excuse the site problems of obamacare , the drone attacks on the internet , the drone attacks on the drone attacks on the internet , the drone attacks on the people .
obama ’ s memoirs of the 2008 election campaign are a sad memory of what is possible .
nathaniel p. morris is a student in the second year at harvard medical school .
i am reading a terrible sad letter at the moment .
it is a book i thought i had read , but it would not be worth my while the dismal second year of my medical studies .
it is called the audacity to win ( courage to win ) and describes the memotion series .
when i talk to my patient ’ s records in the evening and go to bed , the book will lead me back to a time when politics inspired millions and followed a speech with a breath .
the election became a landslide victory and news spokesmen held , to justify the historic significance of this time .
my classmates wept for joy and my parents gathered all newspapers , which they find .
a young team of visionaries was on the way to the white house and the nation was ready for change .
when obama took office in 2008 , he agreed to change his views from 82 % .
and then i close the book .
switch back to the present is a bad awakening , as if you were drawn from a dream .
it is difficult to recall these optimistic times – they seem to be a vague memory , a sad memory , and a sad reminder of missed opportunities .
in the years since i first voted , i have been able to change a little .
but it is simply not something i could have imagined .
i recognise the great and versatile things that obama has achieved , from which he has adopted the affirmative call for a new international health insurance scheme to the military withdrawal from the iraq war .
i agree that the party political blockade should be avoided too much .
but after having heard the obama administration countless times to colleagues and acquaintances , i am not satisfied with my explanation attempts .
i have a point of political despair .
the republican blockade cannot explain why the interception of foreign heads of state is allowed .
it cannot explain why the national security agency has not collected data on the privacy of americans .
it cannot explain why anwar al-awlaki , a us president , has been imprisoned without trial .
it does not justify the results of a report which states that the efforts of the white house to calm the media are the ‘ aggressive &apos; ... since the nineteenth government &apos; .
and , most recently , it cannot excuse the inability to make progress in the more than three years since the adoption of the affordable care act .
i do not know whether this is what i should have expected .
i can have understood that the government &apos;s work was the result of the previous political campaigns .
obviously , the office of deputy is not a predictable course , as an opposition party and random events such as the newtown massacre have dominated public debate .
but when i look at the examples above , they seem to be largely determined by the government itself .
and that bothers me most .
i have re-elected obama in 2012 , not because i am delighted with his candidacy .
mitt romney posed a confusing and unsophisticated alternative .
i had the impression that a second term for obama , free from pressure from future elections , would fulfil the hope that we have been hearing about for so long .
but , with the decline in the approval ratings for obama below 45 % this week , returning to 2008 is a little more severe than the book ’ s return to 2008 .
it awakens in me the longing for the many promises that are disappearing .
this week i read a section in the book describing how obama can make a serious loss against clinton in the us presidential election .
in a meeting with the election agents after the decision , he told his staff that they would have to come back on course and follow the purpose of their case .
“ i want us to rediscover our magic , ” he said .
we must remember who we are .
five years later , mr president , the commission and i could not give you more support .
the views expressed in this comment are solely those of nathaniel morris .
clive palmer claims that prime minister tony abbott has been a conflict of interest in parental leave in the united states during parental leave conflict .
the billionaire and mep clive palmer says , prime minister tony abbott is in conflict of interest in his parental leave plans because his daughters will become pregnant and therefore benefit from it .
the mining magnat , located in a judicial dispute over the payment of 6 million dollars to co2 tax , is the most recent allegation that the country has been left out of the table to ask whether it is in conflict .
the palmer united party could host up to four votes in the senate , which are important for deciding whether the co2 and mining industry taxes should be abolished or reduced .
but palmer claimed that only ministers have conflicts of interest and that the daughters of abbott were able to benefit personally from the laws .
“ he is in a major conflict of interest when it comes to paid parental leave , because if a person is a pregnant , he has a right to life .
two months after the election , the palmer electoral commission declared its lead by 53 votes after the recount officially declared the winner of the sunshine coast congress .
palmer called for a revision of the voting counting process so that it can be carried out more quickly .
tony abbott &apos;s daughters frances and bridget .
if these elections were to take place two months after the end of the vote ?
“ we need a better system , ” he said .
why should we not have a system in which we can go in and store the data in a computer , then immediately choose and then go back to the office at 6 : 30 a.m.
palmer also criticized the use of pencils when marking the ballot papers .
use them because they will then be wiped out if they are not pleasing to you ?
nowadays , to vote with pencils is incredible .
the electoral commission has examined the options for an electronic election and recently adopted a joint legislative proposal with new zealand .
palmer , 59 , explained that to his policy an international airport for the sunshine coast of was belonging to and that he would take his new office “ very seriously . ”
in a public office , it is about public service .
“ we are not seeking rewards other than those of history , namely that we should be able to serve at a critical time of this community , ” he said .
rbs suspends two foreign exchange traders
the royal bank of scotland has two dealers from its forex department , so two people who have been involved in the situation ; this is a further indication of how the situation has deteriorated worldwide .
some of the world ’ s largest banks , including ubs , barclays , deutsche bank , and rbs , confirmed that they had worked with the authorities in the investigation into the world ’ s largest financial market , where $ 5.3 trillion would change daily .
the two dealers would be the first rbs employees to be found in the expanding investigation , which would be the scandal of the libor interbank business .
the bank that has not commented on suspensions has not confirmed that the fund has been in a state of emergency for information from authorities .
“ our investigations on this subject continue and we cooperate fully with the fca and other regulatory authorities . ”
last month , the people close to the situation stated that the rbs had not read the records of emails and instant messages sent by and to a former retailer to the uk regulatory authority , the financial consulting .
this dealer , richard usher , had the rbs 2010 left and is now to be replaced by his current position as european leader of the forex spot trading at jpmorgan .
rohan ramchandani , head of the european spot trading at citi , was beaten this week and matt gardiner , formerly chief currency trader at barclays and ubs , was arrested this week by standard .
none of these traders was accused of any misconduct .
instant message group is a part of the usher group of bankers in barclays and citigroup , said to the people close to the situation .
ubs announced this week that they are taking steps against some of their employees after the swiss regulatory authority finma declared that they would have a suspected breach of the law on foreign exchange at a number of swiss banks .
at least six authorities worldwide – the european commission , finma , the swiss competition authority weko , the fca , the us justice ministry , and hong kong monetary authority – have been employing the latest technology .
hsbc , citigroup , jpmorgan and credit suisse also have started internal investigations or received requests from authorities for information , said with the situation familiar people .
banks are going through instant messages and emails from several years in search of cases of misconduct .
the news of these investigations has been sent to retailers in one area that has been growing at a rate of profitability in recent years .
some bankers have tried to shut down the affair and said that it was almost impossible to stop the vast and highly developed liqueous foreign-exchange market .
a leading trader noticed that , despite the enormous daily volume of foreign exchange trading , the fragmentation of the liquidity between the various trading platforms was not a factor in the increasing use of internal platforms by banks .
the news came out the same day , when credit suisse announced that she had sent a trader of their london exchange traded funds to a trader this week after he had been in a loss of just six million dollars at the end .
the bank promptly informed the competent authorities and cooperated with them .
“ we are sure that the dealer has acted alone and that the matter is contained , ” credite suisse said .
the fence on the bechtle-plot painted by the artist .
a group of citizens &apos; initiative , the swiss meadow , has put the building fence on the bechtle-plot on the spa promenade in bad herrenalb .
moreover , cleaned and widened the footpath , it says in a press release .
the planned covering of the decommissioning house in the rear part of the property was not allowed for security reasons , because the site threatens to slip off .
alfred abel , who currently manages the property , had the embellishment campaign with his colleague reinhard domke of the bi .
before the bi &apos;s action , a transparent with the message &quot; we are for it &quot; was appropriate .
this disturbed the approximately 20 members of the citizens &apos; initiative little in their action .
your motto on the big poster was &quot; we are against building ruins &quot; .
in doing so , it wanted to respond to the threat of even larger ruins on the swiss meadow - if the giant project fails one day .
in conversation with many passers-by before the construction site , it became clear that some citizens believe that it is possible to better manage the realization of the project of the city , although many have the same questions about the dimension of the bi presented project .
but they are beginning to resign because the city continues to delay these responses , it says on the part of the bi .
as has been said , public opinion has also been influenced by the mayor &apos;s statements .
may had a very good reason to say in the municipal council that he would be afraid of the spa if the population were to vote against the plans for a bathing and wellness complex at the swiss spa area during the citizens &apos; decision .
some seem to be frightened , while others feel that they are being &apos; stupid &apos; attempts at blackmail .
the bi thanked donors for the color and all helpers .
rangnick ranked for shiris : mane no swallow king
ralf rangnick is so happy with the current high-form of bundesliga table leader red bull salzburg , so disappointing was the sportdirector of the &quot; bulls &quot; from the arbitrators .
&quot; there is a dangerous tendency at present for mane and alan to fall into the category of swallow kings , &quot; he took the two offensive spiders on a press conference in salzburg on thursday .
the most recent reason for rangnick ’ s critique was yellow for mane at the 3 : 0 versus grödig last sunday , when the senegalese was given a alleged show - the free-for-all .
&quot; a blatant misjudgement , &quot; said rangnick , the referee harkam as &quot; completely overloaded &quot; .
harkam would also have played his part in the escalation between salzburg coach roger schmidt and grödig trainer adi hütter after the match .
his german compatriot was decidedly defended : &quot; i would have behaved the same way in every single situation as roger schmidt . &quot;
schmidt himself wants to be the first to have a contact with his colleague after the scharmützel with his wife .
i do not know why .
&quot; for i am the one who insulted , &quot; he stressed .
given the course of success , rangnick agreed to a praiseworthy achievement .
&quot; there are only two words for this : really good , &quot; he noted .
there is not much to be found .
the way in which the team has played is particularly impressive .
that is what we should do .
cadres in winter transfer time will be difficult to achieve .
there are no great reasons to change .
&quot; except a player asks to be able to join the association , &quot; he said , rangnick made clear .
supreme court confirms obama ’ s health law
it is a great victory for the obama administration : the us supreme court decided to make a decision today that it is closely linked to barack obama ’ s health law .
with five votes to four , the judges ruled that the patient ’ s individual mandate was “ protection and affordable care act ” – forcing the us to accept the decision by 2014 .
the supreme judge john roberts suggested that the united states should be on the side of the four more liberal members of the chamber , while judges scalia , thomas , alito and kennedy decided against it .
the court also confirmed the remaining sections of the 2700 pages comprehensive law and provided for the legal provisions of the code of conduct .
the legal action against the law was initiated by 26 states and the national federation of independent states .
the law was adopted by all leading republican presidential candidates , including the ultimate challenger mitt romney , in the 2012-pre-election campaign .
norway : norwegian town is a place with giant mirrors of light .
with huge mirrors , the inhabitants of a norwegian village have shed light into their dark valley .
because of the low sunset level , the vegetation in vestfjord valley is falling from autumn to early spring , usually in the shade of the surrounding mountains .
with three gigantic reflectors at 45 meters height , a centuries-old space was realised on wednesday .
&quot; finally ! &quot; , citizens swore steinar bergsland at the start ceremony in the broadcaster tv2 .
some people in the valley were right to move sunchairs , while others sat sunglasses for safety .
until now , sun-hungry winter had to reach a nearby summit with a cable car .
ten years ago , the local artist martin andersen presented the proposal to use mirrors to steer rays into the valley .
this basic idea was already in place since 1913 .
after several years of debate , the council finally had the 5 million crowns ( around 615 000 euros ) expensive project adopted .
a similar construction has provided the italian alpine resort of viganella with wintry sunshine for several years .
post leaves very little to be left on sundays .
&quot; many citizens will not notice it yet , the red dots for sunday nights will be in the streets of various letters .
a request from the fdp confirmed this .
on sundays and public holidays , only the post office building will be open in the ernst ludwig-straße 36 and the jakob müller-straße 1 in hüttenfeld .
whether in hofheim and rosengarten even empty sunday , i will say in response to the fdp &apos;s request that it be answered .
the social and youth policy spokesperson of the fdp , fritz röhrenbeck , wants to make a check here .
sunday evasion is particularly important for terminpost , and it is a very important postal service .
&quot; these are the things that make this venture thin despite the price increase for letters in january 2013 , and which are radically and unreasonable . &quot;
thomas bittner , group and city council chairman of the liberals , supports his group colleague , mr billon : &quot; what annoys me is the fact that knee-jerk has changed the lead times here or even cancelled .
close to the citizens , the post office is miles away .
&quot; at least the mailboxes in the districts of neuschlossgarten and neuschlossgarten must be emptied again on sundays &quot; , says bittner and roehrenbeck unisono .
the city of the city was also subject to the rule that non-mobile citizens should have to purchase a sunday void mailbox on foot .
the first time that the city had been named after the city , the city council asked whether the city administration would be planning to hold talks with the post office about this matter .
mayor erich maier replied that the post office did not communicate with lampertheim .
he knows that there are no such cases in hofheim .
your party has opted for privatisation .
&quot; then decisions are taken elsewhere , &quot; said maier .
the price of the parking is to rise sharply .
the hotel is located in a quiet street , but the rooms are very small and the breakfast is very expensive .
the magistrate of the city is discussing a proposal this morning for traffic devotees stefan major ( green ) .
the parking fees are to be increased by 50 percent .
however , this is not to increase prices , but to increase the time interval of parking and parking ticket machines from 30 to 20 minutes .
in december , the city council will have to decide .
the retail committee of the ihk frankfurt considers this &quot; not a good idea &quot; .
the hotel was very clean and the staff were very friendly and helpful .
the traffic club germany believes that an increase after two decades &quot; is entirely appropriate and actually long overdue &quot; .
public transport will also be more expensive .
city of joy : quick action is a host of events that will surprise your hosts and your guests with a great deal of fun .
with a narrow cadre , the lords i of tsv freudenstadt had to be replaced by the lords of the schiller school gymnastics in reutlingen against the tg göningen .
the elders were in contact with an experienced team but they were not able to find the right team .
but it soon became apparent that , even in terms of age , it was not satisfied with the rapid action taken by the city of freudenstadt .
with the hard and placed surcharges , the gönninger made extremely difficult .
repeatedly , they failed to implement the new technologies developed by simon schenk and eduard schulz cleanly across the middle of the network and were unable to escape the blocking .
two high first prizes clearly expressed the superiority of the freudenstadt in all matters .
in the face of this crushing and play-determining performance , the third set was then slightly loud and silently reduced to the 3 : 0 end level ( 25 : 13 , 25 : 14 , 25 : 22 ) .
on 2 november , the tv baiersbronn , which is clearly visible in nagold , will be a much more powerful opponent in the field .
tsv freudenstadt i : dominik bäuerle , yannik büchle , sebastian dölker , felix pälchen , stefan räller , simon schenk and eduard schulz .
in the b class , the murgtalhalle in baiersbronn had the second baiersbronn and freudenstadt teams .
they provided a highly competitive two-way round matching that was a success .
nervousness on both sides caused a great deal of trouble , especially when the ball was taken up ; the passports were also designed to be precise , sometimes with poor quality and sometimes with critical play scenes .
in this highly balanced meeting , the team agreed to a new approach to the tv-team of marcus blasutto , but the great physical effort and a pleasant commitment of both teams .
the day of care at the small english-speaking hut
the fifth nursing day in the aftermath of the natura 2000 project obere hotzenwald met a group of dedicated participants at the small english-speaking hut in ibach .
on the basis of popular suggestions , a new approach should be adopted on this day in the cabin of the view into the valley , said mayor helmut kaiser .
many hikers , according to emperor , referred to this area as the glittering piece of the gorge on which the landscape is situated , the ideal setting for wonderful views .
he thanked those present for their willingness to cooperate and stressed that the carers day was a suitable day for taking care of the connection between people and nature .
it offers every citizen the opportunity to live in nature and to make his own choices .
the hotel is also close to the tourist attractions and the ecological aspects .
this ecological aspect was explained by friederike tribukait from the department of nature conservation of the freiburg government bureau following the welcome by landrat tilman bollacher , who was taken over the patronage .
the tourist destination of the view is the same as tribukait , with the aim of making the old everyday life that has grown to a large extent with its specific protected habitat types .
certain species , such as rare butterflies and grass supporters , can create barriers in the form of forest areas .
you need these free links to maintain your species .
tribukait said she wanted to do it here .
i am also happy to say that the current measure does not only seamlessly integrate with this plan .
a biosphere reserve also offers the opportunity to make sustainable economic and ecological progress .
after these different designs , the chief of the area of the area , christoph wehle and life project manager cornelia bischoff , divided the helpers into groups .
the larger trees were already smashed in the run-up , the forestry tractor may be available for retrieval .
a group of helpers should be looking for the release of wax hangers and care for a dry stone bar .
the aim was to have a free view at the viewpoint .
luffingen : heads still only one candidate , but the other is still the only candidate .

google , samsung , huawei due to nortel patents , has been sued for a patent lawsuit against the u.s. patent office .
the group that had thousands of previous nortel patents stricken the rules of procedure on thursday by an avalanche of complaints for patent infringement against mobile phone manufacturers , including google , the company that was involved in the bankruptcy auction .
rockstar , the consortium that is the nortel patents for usd 4.5 billion , is the first to claim samsung electronics ’ s “ co. ltd . ” patent system .
rockstar is owned by apple , microsoft , blackstar , and the ericsson company .
google will use the term &quot; patent infringement &quot; in seven cases .
patents affect technology that allows search terms to be combined with relevant advertising on the internet .
samsung , huawei , htc and rockstar were not directly accessible .
samsung , huawei and htc make mobile phones that work with google &apos;s operating system .
in 2011 , google launched an initial bid to make more than $ 900 million available for nortel patents .
google increased its offer several times and offered last 4.4 billion us dollars .
after the nortel patents of rockstar were overbid , the company acquired a new name for its motorola mobility for $ 12.5 billion , a business that also partly benefited from motorola ’ s library of patents .
“ although google failed in its attempt to make the case for the patent infringement at the auction , google has not yet infringed the patents and continues to do so , ” says the lawyer .
rockstar claims a high amount of damages from google as it claims to have caused google &apos;s patent infringement intentionally , so the accusation .
egypt sworn first freely elected presidents
mohammed morsi is the oath of authority , but his day of triumph is not likely to mark the end of egypt ’ s political disputes .
the islamist mohammed morsi promised a “ new egypt , ” when he was the first freelance president of the country to be sworn in , thereby undermining the succession of husni mubarak , who had been elected 16 months earlier .
with its inauguration in the supreme constitutional court , morsi became the first freely elected islamic president of the arab world and egypt ’ s fifth head of state since the fall of the monarchy some 60 years ago .
he put the oath before the 18 in black robes dressed judges of the court , which is located at the nile and has an ancient egyptian temple .
“ we are striving for a better future , a new egypt and a second republic , ” said morsi at the ceremony that will take place live on state television .
“ today , the egyptian people have laid the foundations for a new life – absolute freedom , real democracy and stability , ” said the 60-year-old morsi , a us educated engineer and member of the muslim brotherhood .
hundreds of soldiers and police officers guarded the building when morsi was relocated shortly after 11 o &apos;clock in a small car convoy .
only a few hundred supporters had been gathered before the court to give the new president credit , and , unlike the presidential prunk , the president of the mubarak era was only briefly arrested .
as an uncharismatic “ spare wheel ” of the brotherhood , his personal prestige has been lost since his victory and a friday speech , when he was not only a candidate for the islamic republic of iran , but also a candidate for all of those present .
“ egypt is today a civil , national , constitutional , and modern state , ” said the president of egypt , who was in a blue suit with red tie , declared the judges of the wooden church .
later morsi went to the university of cairo , where he delivered his inaugural address .
it was officially ordered by an army band that had been the anthem , who was able to play the national anthem in possession .
the military leader , feldmarshal hussein tantawi , was present .
on his arrival , he was murdered by hundreds of people in the university ’ s largest auditorium , with spokesmen from “ the army and the people are one hand . ”
the company , founded in 1908 as a bastion of secular education , was founded by cairo university in the 1970 ’ s as a stronghold of islamic student groups .
morsi presented a symbolic oath on the tahir square on friday , the birthplace of the uprising that took place last year at the end of authoritarian mubarak ’ s rule , and he praised it .
but , with the imposition of official oath in the court , rather than in parliament as usual , it bows to the will of the military , which indicates that the power struggle will continue .
morsi ’ s speech at tahir-square was full of dramatic populist gestures .
falkenberger disco provides two great nights for a great evening .
the new season in falkenberger disco &quot; blue velvet &quot; has begun .
on friday evening , the words &quot; pump this party &quot; are being used to say , on saturday evening , we will be having an ü 25 party tomorrow .
fat beats and cool sounds are produced by the organisers on both days .
workers crashed from leaders : severely injured
when a defective external sensor is switched off , a 51-year old worker in eggelsberg fell from a ladder on thursday and was seriously injured .
the man from lamprechtshausen wanted to make a defective heating feeling on the outside facade of a inn .

raped people in south africa : two life imprisonment
nine months after the brutal rape and mutilation of a 17-year-old girl in south africa , the perpetrator was sentenced to two life imprisonment on friday .
this was reported by the sabc station .
the victim was later suffering the consequences of serious injuries .
johannes kana was already at the beginning of the week of crime found guilty .
the act had horrified nationwide .
the then 21 year-old had anene booysen in february in an industrial site in bredasdorp near cape town .
14 hours the doctors fought for the survival of the victim , but in vain .
the sight of the young was so horrific that the carers and sisters were given psychological assistance .
kana had admitted during the trial that he had been with booysen in a bar during the night .
he also confessed to smash and raped them , but denied that they were responsible for the death of the girl .
the police were initially trained by several offenders , but they dismissed two suspects from prison because the occupying evidence against them was not sufficient .
the public prosecutor also stressed during the procedure that it was convinced that kana was not in a position to act at the time of the attack .
rape is a crime in south africa : every year there are about 64 000 reports of sexual violence .
that is nearly ten times the amount in germany , but it is still significantly more inhabitants , with 82 million people than south africa ( 50 million ) .
police and women &apos;s associations in south africa appreciate the darkness of sexual violence at 10-25-times the rate .
jumbo visits the black forest ham , the main dish of the island .
jumbo looking for the &quot; best ham &quot; of the world : for the tv-show &quot; galileo &quot; she visited the pro7-star bonndorf .
the speaker is right at the start to make it clear that the most important thing for ham is the pig &apos;s eceulene , turbomast is not a good prerequisite .
can ham , which can be bought in any supermarket , that is , a quality product ?
uli , as head of the big ham factory in the black forest , declared jumbo the operation of the company &quot; adler &quot; in bonndorf .
&quot; germany &apos;s favourite ham &quot; , as jumbo put the black forest ham out , is a true example .
only with hair protection and kittel he comes into the interior of the factory .
jumbo must also be able to disinfect his hands before he can get to the microphone .

&quot; here i get a lot of work , &quot; the tv make-up artist , black forest ham as a mass product .
16,000 keuwls speak for themselves every week .
weight , fat content , color : uli explains what it is about quality .
most pigs are slaughtered at six months .
television with a level ?
details such as the ph value of the meat also play a role .
the darker the meat , the higher the ph value .
&quot; i am curious if your roberto blanco measurements what will happen then &quot; , says jumbo zynisch .
the level of private television is set in pure culture .
but watching is still worthwhile .
the spectator sees that the decomposition of the culls continues to be handcrafted .
because black forests ham is traditionally without bones in the shelf .
the secret of ham is the soup of the chicken with the salt .
smoke tower and smoke humidity remind jumbo optically of a &quot; u-boat &quot; .
the trick : fir branches make for the special taste of black forest shingles in smoke .

they thought travel agencies were part of the past thanks to the internet ?
flight centre seems to be resisting the trend .
the company has increased its profit prospects for the entire year and expects record revenues from holidaymakers in australia and the uk .
the travel company is now moving from adjusted annual earnings before taxes between 325 and 340 million dollars , compared to 305 to 315 million dollars in its previous forecast .
if the current target values are achieved , then this will mean growth of 12 % to 17 % compared to the record gain of 290.4 million dollars in the period 2011 / 12 .
as managing director graham turner announced , flight centre achieved a turnover of eight percent in the first half of the year and made a strong start into the second half , especially in australia and uk private business .
“ since the beginning of the year , our ten countries have been profitable , and some of them are well on the way to record annual income from interest and taxes , ” he said .
these include australia and great britain , which are typically among our strongest earnings providers .
in australia , the leisure industry has grown steadily in the second half of the year , creating a slightly weaker market for business trips .
it was equally good for the leisure business of flight centre in the uk , while here too business customers were spending less .
the us business recovered from a weaker growth in the first half of the year due to seasonal weakness , and thus achieved a profit for the entire year for the third consecutive year .
the shares of flight centre increased by 3 cents yesterday to 38.20 dollars .
schools will become more focused on mathematics , spelling , and grammar .
in courses on english literature , students must have at least one piece of shakespeare , a novel of the 19th century , romantic lyrics and contemporary literature from british history .
the test also includes “ unseen texts ” to determine whether the text is to be read more widely .
the combined course from english literature and language is abolished .
from 2015 onwards , pupils must undertake an independent gcse examination of language , with strong incentives to use english literature as a separate qualification .
the ministry of education will present the new curricula for english and mathematics tomorrow – the first subjects that have been radically redesigned .
other core subjects will be changed next year .
in a separate initiative , oftorture , the supervisory authority for audits , will propose a reorganization of the gcse structures , including a new bending system and less course work .
in a speech in the summer , minister for education michael gove said that there is a “ broad consensus that we need to reform our audit system to restore public confidence , ” emphasising that the gcc ’ s would “ emerge . ”
studies show that in english schools less time is spent on mathematics – 116 hours a year or three hours a week per school year – than in most other countries .
australia ’ s schools , on the other hand , teach an average of 143 hours a year and students in singapore receive 138 hours a day .
there will be no formal requirement to work in the timetable for the maths , but it is not for koalily-skepticism that we should use the comprehensive mathematical examination , combined with a greater emphasis on the subject .
the curriculum focuses more on “ problems from the right life ” , including financial mathematics .

if people had been convinced in the past centuries that they had been too much , and had been taken on the pictures of heaven and hell , &quot; which still shape our ideas to this day , &quot; the contemporary prophetic doctrine is draw from the contemporary prophetic prophet .
&quot; the greater hope is christians through the religious critics belonging to a substantial degree . &quot;
she called &quot; we are so many question marks that the interpretation of the rules of procedure is not enough .

illmensee : second mountain bike tour in the alps .
in the case of good weather , 214 cyclists came to illmensee to take the round trip across the hills around the lake .
the ulrich knobel , which organizes the sports club illmensee , is also responsible for the organisation .
among the participants , especially at short distance over 15 kilometres and 300 metres of altitude , were also numerous people .
two junior riders of the top german class were also at the start of this race : felix bader from bad waldsee and pascal treubel from aach-linz came with the recommendation good placements with the german champions .
these two could , as expected , disappear from the field .
as in the previous year , felix bader was able to achieve a small advance to the finish line and defended his title as overall winner of short distance .
in second place , pascal treubel was again able to place himself in fiubel .
the room was very clean and the staff were very friendly and helpful .
in second place , anne adele from illmensee and leonie treiber from owingen came in .
a welcome development is the increasing number of drivers who have been able to live or work in the community .
not only in terms of performance , the whole range of athletes was represented .
the age structure was also sufficient for the youngest up to 70 years of age at the oldest starters .
in the main race there were even more absolute topathems at the start this year .
four riders were able to move away from the regional top riders .
among them philipp pangerl , a mountain bike half-pro from the black tusk racing team .
pangerl was a member of the team and won two world championships in the 12-hour world championship .

along the way through mud , rivers and jungle for free medical care ,
dr. georges bwelle provides free medical assistance to remote villages in cameroon .
bwelle and his team spend almost every weekend to help hundreds of patients .
in the west african country , there are not many doctors , only one for 5,000 people , and only one for 5,000 people .
do you agree with this or your mobile device ?
dr. georges bwelle is one of the top 10 of the “ cnn heroes of 2013 ” .
you can create a new character for him or any of the other heroes in the top 10 to make him the “ cnn hero of the year ” .
the winner will receive $ 250,000 to continue his exceptional work .
for 21 years , georges bwelle saw his sick father again and again losing consciousness and becoming hospitals .
jamef bwelle was born in 1981 in the vicinity of yaoundé , the capital of cameroon .
first he had only a broken arm , but then he formed a disinfected arm , which was on his face .
“ there was no neurosurgeons in cameroon , ” says georges bwelle .
we should have released it from cameroon if we had had had the money .
instead , bwelle spent years in overcrowding clinics and hospitals , and spent many years with his father to improve treatment .
“ it is not easy , ” commented bwelle .
it is possible to leave the house at five o &apos;clock in the morning and race to the hospital to be the first , and it is not the first .
there are a great many patients .
some people even die because they have to wait .
the situation has hardly changed since bwell &apos;s father died in 2002 .
in cameroon , there is only one physician for 5,000 people , according to the world health organization .
on the other hand , the relationship in the united states is with a doctor for 413 people .
but even if there was a doctor for them , most cameroons could not afford to visit .
two out of five people live below the poverty line in the country , and nearly three-quarters of health spending in the country is private .
“ the only problem you have is poverty , ” says bwelle .
and poverty makes it impossible to enjoy life .
his father and so many of his compatriots suffered in bwelle , and decided to do something about it .
dr. georges bwelle and his volunteer team have last year carried out 700 free operations .
he became a doctor and worked as a vascular surgeon in the central hospital in yaoundé .
he also founded a non-profit organization called ascovime , which is held in rural areas on weekends and offers free medical care .
since 2008 he and his volunteers have contributed almost 32,000 people .
almost every friday he and up to 30 people are forced to move into minibuses and drive with the snooted medical equipment on the roof over unpaved terrain into the villages that need help .
not always everything goes smoothly .
more than once , they had to drive the vehicles through rivers and mud .
but when they arrive , they will be received like heroes : a feast , vocals and dance , and the best accommodation that the place has to offer .
in these villages , free healthcare is really a reason to celebrate and bwelle – with its wide smile and its limitless energy – is happy to help with the happy celebration .
the next morning the team will start examining hundreds of patients .
“ for each trip we treat 500 people ” , says bwelle .
they come from a distance of 60 kilometers around the village – and that is on foot .
each of these weekly clinics offers medical care in a number of areas .
many people are arrested for malaria , tuberculosis , malnutrition , diabetes , parasites , and sexually transmitted diseases .
others get crutches , donated glasses or free birth certificates – a document that is required for the school , but that takes many poor families away .
in the evening , the team will perform simple operations with local anaesthesia .
operations are normally carried out in a school , town hall or apartment ; after the entry , the patient is on the receiving end and go to the recreation area to make room for the next .
the lighting for the op and the disinfection equipment is controlled by the generator of the group and so work bshaft and its volunteers to the early morning hours on sunday .
it is a hard task , but the village musicians are helping to make the team motivation and to make it a success .
&quot; they drummer all night , so that we can stay awake and continue our work , &quot; says bwelle .
on sunday the team will return to the city , tired but proud of the work done .
the group – a mixture of cameroon doctors and foreign medical students – has won 700 free operations last year , and knows that they are making a huge difference to people .
one man explained that the free operation of a broken load he had received was a success .
“ this is changing the future of my family , ” said the man .
in addition to the weekend clinics and his work as a surgeon in the hospital , bwelle also works at night in private clinics in yaoundé .
with this second job he finances 60 % of his non-profit activities , so bwelle ; the rest come from private donations .
“ i really do not know when he sleeps , ” says katie o &apos;malley , who died at the drexel university in philadelphia medicine in the second year and voluntarily went to bwell .
it is always either in the hospital or trying to raise money for the organization so that it can go to these campaigns .
for medical and nursing students , such as o &apos;malley , who come from the us and europe and support the bwelle , this is an opportunity to gain practical experience that they never get at home .
“ we can be involved in operations where we help to dissolve blood or to use the instruments for dr. bwelle , ” explains o &apos;malley .
that would be a bad thing in america as a medical student in the second year .
students pay for their journey to cameroon themselves and often bring sanitation material to the school .
but once you &apos;ve been in yaoundé , bwelle will take over the accommodation , transport and instruction .
“ he is without doubt a hero , ” says o &apos;malley .
he dedicates his life to this organisation and his desire to help the cameroon people knows no boundaries .
for bwelle , almost constant work is no burden .
to make others happier and thus to make a promise , which he has given his father , is a great pleasure for him .
“ i am so happy when i make this work , ” says bwelle .
i am thinking of my father .
i hope he will see what i do .
i do it to bring people back to laugh and to overcome the pain .

excellent fighting , the team has been able to make the fight a success .
the role of santiago , the old man in hemingway novelle &quot; the old man and the sea &quot; , is horst janson on the lighter bones .
janson is an old hand in his own metier , the art of acting .
the old man santiago cannot be left to fish .
the two simply complement each other in a great way .
it is almost said that the folds in the neck of the old man , of whom the fishing boy is talking , can be seen .
if santiago is tired of life on the chair sited , it is a good idea at janson .
in addition , the role of the old fisherman is a distinct character that janson has excellently mastered .
hemingway told the story of a fighter , a courageous man who was not giving up and was ultimately defeated by his knowledge and his strength of will , by the fight against the fish .
janson was a member of the star trek : voyager series episode &quot; the best of the worlds &quot; .
it manages to attract the audience ’ s attention and to make sure that the audience ’ s monologues don ’ t get bored for a moment .
his efforts to finally bring the fish to the surface of the water are as genuine as the breeze that the spectators forget that the sea is only lit from blue water bottles .
director jens hasselmann leaves the old man on board in front of the fishing village .
in the course of the performance , he puts the active scene in the light : the hut of santiago , the bar of singer marie-luise gunst , which with her songs and her splendid voice will make the life easier .
the four musicians play cuba ’ s rhythm and are guests of the bar .
tourism : descent to the romans
the hotel is situated in the heart of the old town of cologne , only a few steps from the main railway station .
if you are visiting cologne , you will not be missed by the cathedral .
about 157 meters high , the two towers rise into the sky and make it the second highest church in europe .
but few visitors who visit the two filigree church towers can see azeroth .
rainer schulze is an expert in cologne &apos;s underworld .
meeting point for his guided tours is the service center of cologne tourism directly at the dom .
the tour starts in an unspectacular way : &quot; we start in the underground garage &quot; , says schulze .
in the 1970s , the city &apos;s fathers wanted to build a city that is suited to their cars , and so the remains of the old city wall remained only what was not too big .
most users of the multi-storey car park are therefore also hurting at the roman remains and only cars .
but if you look more closely , you will discover a new , metal-grid structure in the d2 parking deck .
the view is about five meters high ruins of hand-made stones .
&quot; it is the remains of the roman city wall that were destroyed in the second half of the first century after christ , &quot; he tells schulze .
before returning to the daylight , schulze leaves participants on the upper floor of the park a look into a dark and dark , 15-metre shaft .
this is the well of the old cathedral , which unfortunately is hardly noticed .
next station of the tour is the pretorium , and here the participants go down again into the depth .
we are witnessing the official seat of the once most powerful man north of the alps , the precursor of the ccaa .
what ccaa means is that a visitor wants to know .
&quot; the abbreviation stands for &quot; colonia claudia ara agrippinensium &quot; , which in a good german means &quot; city roman right and city of agrippina &quot; .
and the pretorium is the former fortress of st. peter , which was the centre of power of the roman empire on the rhine .
from the entrance hall of the exhibition , a tunnel access to the roman sewerage canal , which is being maintained here at about 120 meters in length .
&quot; you can quietly take a piece along the so-called cloaca maxima if you want , &quot; she brave schulze the guests up .
one surprise still has schulze .
after being paid at the cash desk , he will take the group to a 16 meter deep , then walk to the main square .
&quot; we are now in the mikwe , a ritual jewish bath , &quot; he explains .
the jewish community built its bathroom deep into the ground to adapt to the groundwater that was used for ritual washing .
to date , at the bottom of the mikwe , whose origins date back to the eighth century , different water levels have been caused by changing levels of the rhine .
the mikwe is part of an archaeological zone on the town hall square for which the construction work will begin shortly .
until completion , however , some years will pass .
leg almost hacked : new edition of rocker process .
a bloody attack in the rockermileu will be resumed after more than four years .
a trial for attempted killing , dangerous physical injury and damage to property against two thirty years old has been filed before the district court of frankfurt ( oder ) .
it is supported by strict security measures .
the defendants remain silent for the start .
they are supposed to have been active in the rocker scene and have been part of the banditos at that time .
the public prosecutor accuses them of having , in june 2009 , taken to court in finowfurt , together with unknown accomplices , three men in a car and taken on .
all victims were seriously injured , a man would almost have lost his leg .
victims are to become competing groups hell &apos;s angels .
one is to be a high-ranking member from berlin .
the premise was apparently a hunt for persecution with several cars .
the charge was about the area of the fighting of the reign of augustus and a demonstration of power .
the two defendants were in a first trial at the beginning of 2012 .
a court spokesman said then that it did not have the opportunity to prove that men were interested in the bloody feud .
the perpetrators had carried masks and had not been recognized .
the federal court of justice lifted the judgment after the revision of the public prosecutor &apos;s office and rewarded it for the district court .
one of the defendants is currently being held in open for another offence .
the first time was the introduction of the rebuilding of the processes in tatnacht .
as a witness , the commissioner who was then investigating was loaded .
the focus was on mobile phone calls from the defendants and other people who had been intercepted by the police .
it is difficult for rockers to almost always remember a man who is eternal in court - not to say .
this also applies to the victims .
in the first trial , only one of the victims had been paid out .
public prosecutor stefan golfier of the public prosecutor &apos;s office in frankfurt ( or ) said on request that new donations have been made since the last trial .
eleven other negotiating parties are required for the process .
the disposable society does not think that it is a society which is displaced does not think it is a society which does not think it is not thinking of the future .
the night was long , the music loud and the mood good , but eventually it goes home .
but in the trees of people on the front-passenger and rear seat the hunger is noticeable .
of course , some cocktails may be a good idea .
what could be more obvious than chill-out for the next drive-in to get a little bit of a treat ?
i admit that i am happy to be with you when it comes late at night or early in the morning .
a few pommes , a cola , a burger - and then nix as home and in bed !
but on the way home , the obvious differences between me and other hungry disco goers are noticeable .
what should you miss out on the fact that you can always check your fast-food bags from the car window with constant regularity ?
the hotel is located in the centre of the city , close to the main shopping street and the main shopping street .
&quot; why ? &quot; i wonder .
are people too doof to put the bags home ?
it is not only the case that the paper product discharges the landscape .
bags have already been equipped with transport facilities such as control panels , which has caused accidents .
what does the word &quot; disposable society &quot; think about , but not after , probably she does not even know what that word actually means .
the hotel is very close to the main train station and the bus stop is very close .
there would be a few bags more or less even nowhere - unlike the street , where no one is on the food residues of other rumbles .
i can already see the day when cities and municipalities will be given the opportunity to make their way - and the facts are already there .
obama ’ s retraction in health policy
after a heavy criticism , president obama made a retreat yesterday to his frequently repeated , clear pledge : “ if your health insurance is what you like , you can keep it . ”
after hundreds of thousands of people have received a notice of termination from their insurers , the republicans threw a warning to the president in recent days that he has misled the american public .
yesterday , obama relatised his original promise .
“ the vast majority of citizens who want a functioning health insurance system can take it for granted , ” he said when he spoke in boston .
in response to the numerous media reports on redundancies , obama called on those americans who received such communications to focus on the free market .
most citizens could thus have a better , more comprehensive health insurance for the same price , or less favorably , than forecast .
&quot; you come with a better offer , &quot; he said .
the government described it as unsurprising that the five per cent of the population , who themselves have insurance , are looking for a different tariff .
“ i want to say to these americans quite directly : they deserve better , ” sebelius said at a hearing before the energy and trade committee of the representative office of the house of representatives in washington .
sebelius , who is responsible for the implementation of the affordable care act , has declared that the fund &apos;s launch is a long time since october .
“ i am as frustrated and angry as anyone else , ” she said .
i am determined to regain your trust .
this statement of an excited sebelius at a meeting behind her , at the meeting yesterday , was a clear example of this .
after more than three hours of hearing , long sebelius repeatedly pressed the question why the “ architects ” were not able to make a decision .
government in jerusalem confirms attack on syrian air force base no longer confirms the attack on syrian air base base .
an american government official who is anonymous is not allowed to be informed of the outcome of the vote on thursday against the american news channel cnn .
the goal is to launch &quot; missiles and related equipment , &quot; the israeli government fears that the us will be responsible for lebanon &apos;s security .
syrian and lebanese media , as well as the arab channel al-arabiya , had previously reported that the port of latakia was located at the night of wednesday on thursday .
the israeli television channel 2 showed satellite images of the base .
uncertain the government of jerusalem has not officially confirmed the attack .
however , the news agency reuters quotes an equally anonymous israeli government official with the words that he believes that israel is going to carry out the attack , but is not sure .
a spokesman for the israeli defense ministry said , &apos; we are not commenting on these reports &apos; .
the journalist ron ben-yishai emphasized in the daily yedioth ashraf that the eu is a very important country in the world earlier , partly successfully .
the israeli government has repeatedly warned that any attempt to isolate syria from the hezbollah with chemical or other dangerous weapons would be a step in the wrong direction .
john kerry , in an unprecedented attempt to impose the financial crisis on the us spy , says that the us has gone “ unreasonably too far . ”
john kerry suggested that the us would be a little more cautious in his view , with an unexpected admission of its defensive stance on its surveillance programs .
the foreign minister also admitted that he would be acting in tandem with barack obama to ensure that “ autopilot ” was switched when the explosive bombs were being launched .
the leaked information makes us government in a diplomatic position .
if a video call is given at the open government conference in london , kerry said : “ without question , the president and i , as well as others in the government , have learned of some things that are almost autopilot .
he then became the first high-level member of the us government to admit that the us spy was a border crossing .
he said : “ in some cases , this has gone too far . ”
the president is determined to clarify matters and is therefore conducting a thorough investigation so that no one can feel that i am being abused .
i assure you that the rights of innocent people will be respected in this process .
kerry insisted , however , that the nsa be a force of good , and that its surveillance processes saved many lives .
he added : “ we are dealing with a new world , where the people are ready to move themselves into the air . ”
there is a radical extremism in the world that is sinful of people being killed , and in which the people are being killed .
so what if you were able to do that ?
we have indeed seen aircraft crashes , attacks on buildings and the killing of people because we have been very careful in the run-up to such plans .
meanwhile , us legislators will travel to europe to address concerns about the alleged american espionage .
senator chris murphy from connecticut said he had this week met with representatives of the european parliament and others and was concerned about their threats to withdraw from the european parliament because of frustration with national security .
“ it is very important for national security interests of the us that europeans are not too distracted from our joint efforts against terrorism . ”
i also go to europe to make it clear that we in the fight against terrorism must continue to work together , regardless of your anger at the nsa programmes .
media reports that the nsa has lost millions of telephone data in europe have seriously damaged relations with some us allies .
other revelations quoted from snowden ’ s documents that the government of nsa had to remove the mobile phone from chancellor angela merkel and up to 34 other heads of state .
the head of national intelligence , james clapper , defended the espionage of allies as necessary , and stated that this was customary on both sides .
in all the tumult , murphy said that his authority is preparing the congress ’ s journey , which is to take place this year , and hoped that the delegation would be members from both parties and chambers .
the names of the other participating members will be published in the coming days .
he said that the exact route will be worked out .
while murphy stressed that the purpose of the journey was to improve relations , he also said that there are some “ serious words ” that would be true .
he said that european governments should be honest with their people about the kind of spy programmes that they themselves have been using for years .
“ while we can change our surveillance programs to protect the rights of europeans , they must also be able to address the fact that the european union is not the only ones to be spying , ” says murphy .
meanwhile , john kerry will be on a weekend trip to the middle east and poland to see how he can get out of the bush with the resentment about the us strategy in syria , egypt , and iran , and us surveillance activities .

australian is appealing to prison in thailand .
a 21-year-old woman from sydney who was to be in prison in phuket for 15 days because she was mistakenly claiming to be tortured by a taxi driver was killed against the ruling .
stevie rochelle bamford was first tried by a provincial court in phuket on 15 june .
later , however , the recordings of a video camera showed that she had safely arrived at her hotel after she had been separated from her australian friend .
the police in phuket interrogated bamford for two days until they agreed to look at history .
until the trial , she was there in police custody .
bamford was sentenced to 15 days in prison in a prison prison .
she is the daughter of peter tunks , a former player of the australian rubgy-league , who is addressing the foreign ministry in canberra with the request for help for his daughter .
tunks declared to the sunday telegraph in sydney that the whole family was “ extremely concerned ” about the welfare of his daughter and wanted to take them back to australia .
“ we are naturally very concerned , but we hope that you will be back to home as soon as possible , ” said tunks .
bamford has appealed against the judgment and is against a deposit of 50,000 baht on free foot .
in australian reports , they were reported to have been in the meantime in the resort krabi in southern thailand .
the court has said that bahamford will be replaced by a local lawyer in phuket .
however , it is also possible that thailand will be in a state of emergency following the recent assassination of the traveler michelle smith in phuket .
