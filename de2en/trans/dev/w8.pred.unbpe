gutach : even more safety for pedestrians
they are not 100 metres apart : on tuesday , the new b 33-foot walk in gutach is set up at the village parking lot - in sight of the older town hall building .
two plants so close together : intention or torturer ?
this question was answered clearly by gutach ’ s mayor yesterday .
&quot; the city hall ampel was installed at the time because it secures the school path , &quot; eckert explained yesterday .
the kluser traffic lights are safe for both cyclists and bus passengers and the mountain residents .
the plant that was officially launched yesterday was important for the intersection of sulzbachweg / kirchstraße .
we have the museum , two churches , spa park , bus stop , a doctor and a bank , as well as traffic flow from the residential area › grub ‹ .
&quot; at the high traffic and pedestrian traffic volumes , another traffic light had to be produced for their safety , &quot; eckert said .
peter arnold of the offenburg county council also confirms this .
&quot; according to current measurements , on the b 33 daily about 12 000 vehicles pass through the municipality of gutach , about 10 percent of which are heavy goods traffic , &quot; arnold emphasizes .
so the construction of another light is more than necessary : &apos; safety is just ahead &apos; , says arnold .
four traffic routes have been carried out , a roundabout has been planned , but due to the narrow intersection of sulzbachweg / kirchstraße .
according to arnold , the number of traffic light poles was tested in the location of the traffic light masts : &quot; by means of an extra for us with particularly long trunks of loaded trucks we have tested whether these vehicles come from the sulphur .
the traffic light system itself , which costs around 15 000 euros , is the &quot; most modern thing that exists on the market &quot; , explained arnold .
the system is equipped with coloured leds that shine so strongly that the lights are covered by the drivers , for example , even in the sunset .
and it is economical : the older light systems use about 100 watts , the new eight watts .
there are three lighting systems per direction .
arnold explained the technology of the new plant : this is equipped with two radar sensors .
if the pedestrian pushes the traffic light button , the upper radar sensor will test the traffic situation .
if the road is free , the pedestrian will be immediately green , if not , it will take about 15 seconds .
another radar sensor checks whether the footprint is finished for the pedestrian .
&quot; should a group or handicapped people go out of the street , the groundwork will be extended , so everyone will be safely on the road , &quot; arnold said .
of course , drivers must be able to think about this as partners and observe the road .
this was not the case yesterday : hardly the traffic lights for pedestrians green , a sky-high vehicle rushed through - for the bright red .
josef winkler has been writing for more than 30 years the plight of his childhood and youth from the soul .
the disasters of his catholic village childhood - the lack of language , the inclination to raw violence and blunt sexuality , which have been close and joyless - have left the carinthian poet many times .
the büchner prize winner is known primarily as prose author , theatre texts are in his work rar .
collage of prosatextes gerhard fresacher presents for his performance &quot; weather lights on the tongue &quot; , which are now in garage x on petersplatz .
the theatre maker combines elements from the autobiographical novel &quot; der leigene &quot; ( 1987 ) with prosaminaturen from &quot; leichnam , his family belauerd &quot; ( 2003 ) .
the stage , which is largely empty , is important : a broken surface , a sliced sofa , on which the koppuliert and masturbation are anchored , the eight-person team hangs .
in this context , director fresacher seems to have little faith in the text .
the 70-minute performance exaggerates the template with a wealth of filmmaking , known from the repertoire of postdramatic play forms .
the actresses in particular are often the ones who are in the process of sometimes questionable scenic realisation .
they are severely attacked , immersed in the water with their heads , tacked with their evening robes on the wall .
the first of these is the &quot; schlacher &quot; ( the &quot; schlacher &quot; ) , which is the most important trade fair for the german market .
the text is , however , hardly conveyed in this way .
the best moments have the evening when sung - the range extends from deep purple to deep folk dance .
only towards the end comes the over-shot performance a little to rest , and winkler ’ s downright absurd humor is flashing .
a blackbox in the car ?
us street planners are looking for a source of money to finance the looming highway system , and do they believe the solution in a small black box ?
the equipment that records every kilometre travelled and reports the information to the authorities is at the heart of a controversial attempt by washington and the eu ’ s planning offices to outdated system for financing us dollars .
the area of road planning , usually boring , suddenly had an intense debate with colourful alliances .
libertarians have allied with environmental groups and argue that the government should not use the small boxes to record the kilometres that have been travelled – and possibly also where they have been driven – and then use the information for calculating .
the tea party is appalled .
the american civil rights association ( aclu ) is also deeply concerned and expresses a number of data protection concerns .
but , while congress did not agree to act , several states no longer wait .
they are currently looking at how they can change over the next ten years to a system in which drivers pay per mile in danger .
thousands of drivers have been killed by the tachographs , some of which are equipped with gps monitoring .
this is really a must for our country .
“ it is nothing we will possibly use , ” said hasan ikhrata , managing director of southern calyptus corporation .
the way we pay these taxes will change .
the technology is there .
the initiative comes at a time when the highway trust fund , which is financed from taxes , is bringing the americans to the gas pipe , pouring it down .
but america is no longer tank as much as it used to .
cars use less petrol .
the government ’ s 18.4 cents per gallon ( less than 4 cents per litre ) tax on mineral oil has not increased for 20 years .
politicians do not dare to tax the tax by a single cent at high prices in the economy .
“ the gasoline tax is simply not sustainable , ” says lee munnich , a transport lawyer at the university of minnesota .
his state recently sold 500 cars with tachographs that could be used to set up a mileage payment system .
“ this is the most sensible option in the long term , ” he said .
bureaucrats call it mile-based user service .
it is not surprising that the idea has attracted urban liberals , because the tax could be used , for example , to influence driving behaviour in such a way as to prevent congestion and harmful emissions from the climate .
californian planners rely on the system in drawing up strategies to support ambitious , legally enshrined goals of the state on climate change .
but the republican bill shuster of pennsylvania , chairman of the house transportation committee , also declared that the house was in favour of the most viable long-term alternative .
the free marketers of the reason foundation are also inspired by the idea of sending drivers to a relocated route .
“ this is not a tax that disappears in a black hole , ” explains adrian moore , vice president of directives at reason .
people pay directly for what they get .
the movement is also supported by two former us transport ministers , who in a report in 2011 called on congress to move towards mile-based settlement .
the us senate approved a $ 90 million pilot project last year , which would cover 10,000 cars .
but the majority in the house of representatives prevented the initiative , responding to the concerns of members from rural areas who represent people who are in everyday life often many miles on the way to work or into the city .
several states and large cities are nevertheless moving towards their own accord .
oregon is the most committed driver , currently 5,000 riders for the country ’ s largest experiment .
these drivers will soon be charging the mileage instead of the mineral oil tax to the state .
nevada has already completed a pilot project .
new york city is also considering such a thing .
illinois is testing it with trucks to a limited extent .
and the i-95 coalition , to which the transport ministries of 17 states on the east coast belong ( including maryland , pennsylvania , virginia , and florida ) , is currently investigating change .
the concept is not a universal hit .
in nevada , where recently 50 volunteers were equipped with the equipment , drivers were sceptical about the idea that the government could follow any of their movements .
“ objections to big brother and such things were a big problem , ” explains alauddin khan , head of the strategy and results management department of the nevada ministry of transport .
people did not want it .
when the test started , the aclu warned nevada on their website : “ it would be relatively easy to find the tachograph in full-grown surveillance devices . ”
there is no need to create a gigantic , bulky technological infrastructure that will inevitably be used to support data on the daily movements of individual people .
nevada is a member of a number of states that are now looking for affordable technology to enable the state to control the kilometres that are being travelled , but not exactly when and where .
that , khan said , would also calm the public .
hunting for this technology has led some authorities to a small startup company called true mileage in california .
the company was not originally established to assist states in taxing drivers .
instead , it was their aim to create a more competitive market for motor insurance , where drivers are able to compete on the basis of the miles they have been made .
but the devices it tests are also very interesting for road planners , because they do not work with gps and only provide limited information that is regularly uploaded by modem .
“ people are more willing to participate if their speed and locations are not recorded ” , said ryan morrison , ceo of eads .
some of these public pilot programmes have made major mistakes .
there are much cheaper and less intrusive ways to implement this .
in oregon , planners are experimenting with offering drivers a range of choices .
you can choose a device with or without gps .
or you do not select any device at all and instead pay a flat fee based on the average risk of mileage from all the inhabitants of the state .
others hope to reconsider the concept of a distrust public by using more functions to equip the devices than with less .
in new york city , transport officials want to develop a tax-payer device that can also pay parking fees , a insurance just for dangerous kilometres , and a different speed record from other vehicles in real time , thanks to which they can be made .
“ the added value of the benefits offered by the system would motivate drivers to take part , ” says a planning document from the city .
some transport planners wonder , however , whether all talk of paying per mile is not just a huge distraction .
in the metropolitan transportation commission for the area of san francisco bay , officials declared that the congress was unable to resolve the problem of bankrupt highway trust fund .
an additional one-off fee or an annual levy could be imposed on drivers using hybrid vehicles or other vehicles that use little petrol .
“ there is no reason for an operation if an aspirin is sufficient , ” explains randy rschwanler , head of the commission ’ s legislation and public affairs .
if we do that , hundreds of millions of drivers are concerned about their privacy and many other things .
king : small team is wacker &apos;s first team to win the title of the title of the title of the title of the title of the title of the title of the title .
the voluntary fire brigade managed its autumn main test despite lack of personnel with bravour .
only eleven men took part in the exercise .
hans kammerer , commander of the department , had taken the ownership of the feder estate in burgberger straße in his acceptance of practice .
the sawing process is to be short .
the resulting fire and the smoke have injured two people , one of whom was able to send an emergency call .
two respiratory carriers of the armed forces were on the way to the first examination of the situation by hans kammerer to enter the building .
after a short time , the first person was found and led to the open .
the second person had to be worn .
this was not so easy , as it was also possible to overcome a narrow staircase .
the building , a workshop with integrated stables for two horses , was not easy to secure .
there was a lot of wood and also straw bales in it .
there were also electrical machines for woodworking .
the first extinguishing attack was carried out via the tank in the vehicle .
another line was built using a high heat-hydrate at about 100 meters distance .
now three ransom attacks have been made .
the use of this system was also made in the building .
hans kammerer was also interested in showing what is meant with little available space .
in case of emergency , support is provided via the königsfeld daily task group .
the commander showed himself satisfied with the course of the exercise .
networking of universities and companies important
during his visit to the county of breisgau high black forest , president guido wolf was also able to inform himself in titisee new town about where the workers of tomorrow come from .
he went to the hochschwarzwald school school school school heads and the kreisgymnasium and the parental advisory board chairmen .
&quot; education is an important factor in location , &quot; stressed claudia stelle , director of the hans-thoma school , who supports the networked school project hochschwarzwald education center .
wolf was impressed by the model projects for training .
since 2011 , a successful collaboration between the support centre , the district gymnasium and the vocational school centre has been in existence in the forest town .
he also praised the family-friendly nature of the county .
&quot; it is important not only to have a look at the family phase , but also to have a look at the care of family members due to demographic change , &quot; wolf explained .
he also said that more and more employees are concerned with the care and care of their relatives .
&quot; without the support of employers , the resulting workforce burden can lead to an end to the employment relationship , &quot; wolf said .
but no one can afford to lose a skilled workforce , he said .
another particularly important factor is the networking of universities and companies .
&quot; for anyone who has already experienced the benefits of the region during his studies , will remain satisfied with his acquired knowledge and skills of the regional economy , which will help to strengthen the region , &quot; the rural day showed .
only when there are sufficient training places can the skilled workforce be covered .
in his opinion , the region ’ s advantage is its advantageous location in south-west germany , close to france and switzerland .
he also experienced a great deal of traffic on his train journey from titisee-neustadt to freiburg , where efforts have already been made to develop public transport .
&quot; stay firm and ensure that you are not the only one to improve public transport , &quot; he said to the attendants of local politicians .
with music an enjoyable afternoon experience
the kaul family has been inviting dietinger seniors for coffee , cakes and a vegan for 15 years .
in the past , the elderly were served in the resting place .
meanwhile , the st. josef nursing home is taking place this afternoon .
the home residents were looking forward to the delicious cakes and cakes .
later there was sausage salad .
with popular melodies silvia kimmich-bandle and her father karl kimmich entertained .
the more than 100 years old stone wall , as the front demarcation of the old school courtyard to the kirchstraße , is to be rebuilt with the rehabilitation plan of the city of bräunlingen .
in the days before the kilbig was the first works of the rehabilitation of the front school yard a small wall , to stabilize and to relieve the static relief of the natural stone wall with balustrade over a hundred years .
the next step , alexander misok said , is to be taken by the bräunlinger stadtbauamt , to include the national heritage office in the planning and to develop a rehabilitation concept for the old wall .
the aim is to calculate costs by experts who will then be able to submit a proposal to the local council to decide and determine the next step .
a decision on this is expected to be made next year .
after the renovation , paving and planting of the old school farm within the two sides of the 1912 building school , the school must be closed as a follow-up measure for the foreseeable future , which will require renovation .
the historic , one-hundred year old barrier of the old school court to the kirchstraße , is mainly caused by water and frost damage , as there is no drainage , and has a arc tendency and a arch .
deep cracks in individual stones testify to weather damage , but the wall is not at present at risk of collapse .
a strong wall is a prerequisite for a school court used by students , which is what has been done by the current fortifications .
originally , the school court rehabilitation was even planned for the years 2008 / 2009 , but high unplanned expenditure brought a postponement .
an important word in the historical renovation of the school walls , which was even used for film shoots , will be the regional heritage office .
if you have any suggestions from this site , the city of bräunlingen hopes to receive subsidies from the monument preservers .
the students of bräunlinger primary school , who have now returned to a well restored old school building with new aula , can soon visit the old school courtyard .
özdemir wants to receive jazz training in stuttgart .
in the ongoing discussions about the future of the music colleges in baden-württemberg , cem özdemir , the german green party chairman , has now also joined .
&quot; i think it is wrong to take holistic training in the musikhochschule stuttgart &quot; , said özdemir the &quot; stuttgart news &quot; .
jazz and classical are just some of the most important elements of the jazz scene in stuttgart .
this is a contradiction to özdemir , who in stuttgart was the favorite for a direct mandate at the german elections on 22 september , who is the green red government .
this is based on a study by experts , which is aimed at reorganising the five music schools in baden-württemberg .
after that , the programme of study , jazz and pop , is to be launched from the musikhochschule stuttgart to the mannheim university of music .
us border : &quot; super tunnel &quot; to smuggle drugs discovered
on the mexican and us border , investigators have built a &quot; super tunnel &quot; to smuggle drugs and have closed them .
as the us customs authorities have said , the more than 500 metre long tube between tijuana and san diego was covered with electricity , railway tracks and an ventilation system .
three suspects have therefore been arrested , eight tonnes marijuana and almost 150 kilograms of cocaine confiscated .
the tunnel , according to the data , had not yet been used .
&quot; these cartels are stupid if they think they could be digging under the radar , &quot; said the attorney general of southern california &apos;s southern california district .
the drug gangs are insured by duffy : &quot; if you continue to build such tunnels and try to use them , we are determined to make a huge waste of your dirty money &quot; .
both the us authorities and the mexican security forces are in a permanent struggle against drug cartels .
since 2006 , mexico has seen more than 77,000 people killed in connection with drug crime .
constructed by experts
due to the elaborate equipment of the tunnel , the investigators assume that it was designed by architects and engineers and that the construction was carried out for about a year .
the track was equipped to provide electrically operated cars .
on the mexican side , the access is in a building that is 80 metres from the border .
according to the authorities , a ladder takes 20 meters into the depth to the actual tunnel entrance .
the tunnel has a cross-section of 1.20 meters height and 90 centimeters width .
it would have been a good way of encouraging illegal immigration towards the united states .
two of the suspects were arrested in connection with the cocaine fund .
the third , a mexican , was arrested for the seizure marijuana .
all three face the threat of lifelong deprivation of freedom , as officials have said .
eight such tunnels have been discovered since 2006 , and the press conference in san diego has continued to do so .
however , it is the first time that kokain has been found in such a tunnel .
cocaine is usually produced in smaller quantities and not by tunnels .
this shows the &apos; desperation &apos; of drug gangs , whose traditional routes have now been cut off , bill sherman said of the drug search dea in san diego .
they would do everything they can to get to the us .
no details have been made available on the detainees , at least one of them was mexicans .
they must be given prison sentences of up to ten years .
2014 is the feast of the year 2014 of the geisinger festjahr
the anniversary of the city of geisingen on the occasion of the 1250 .
the first mention of the church is coming back .
if the year ends in just over eight weeks , the anniversary year is approaching .
geisingen und kirchen-hausen were first mentioned in documents together in 794 .
a document was produced in churches , in which both places are mentioned .
on 15 march there will be an official start to the anniversary year , and since geisingen currently has no hall , this opening event will take place in the place where a new exhibition was held 1250 years ago , both of which were mentioned .
during the anniversary , several events have been held in geisingen , as well as in kirchen-hausen .
kirchen-hausen will be held in july on a festival weekend from 18th to 20th july the 1250 .
celebrate reversal .
on friday with a ceremony , on saturday and sunday with a festival around the church hall .
on this weekend the church house church of st. martin is also celebrated .
city music director rudolf barth has presented a new album of works for the city on the occasion of the anniversary .
on june 21 , together with the sunday anniversary of the schwarzwaldverein , on july 12 in the arena with fireworks and on december 13 as the first concert of the city music in the new festhalle .
this will be completed in the anniversary year and inaugurated , the official date is last september weekend , 27 and 28 september .
on the occasion of the geisinger city anniversary , a new chronicle is also being published .
&quot; but a chronicle should not only be of hostage itself , but a printed work about the hostage of today , which is also made of geisingen , kirchenhausen , leipzig , aulfingen .
and today ’ s howling celebrates 2014 birthday , 1974 was the first space with the commonalities .
the new chronicle will be published on november 21 or 22 in the new festhalle in geisingen .
2014 is also a year of many anniversaries .
the narration strahglonki starts on february 8 with a traditional evening on the occasion of its 60-year old existence , the harmony gutmadingen will be 90 years and has been celebrating the festival on march 29 and then .
the old leipferdingen plant is 40 years old , the geisinger school has been in its new location for 50 years and celebrates it on 10 may , the musikverein polyhymnia leipersweig celebrates 150 years old and celebrates this in july .
the city of geisingen was founded in a donation document owned by the monastery of st. gallen in 764 for the first time .
the certificate was issued in churches ( hausen ) , which was then court .
both communities are thus mentioned in the same document .
this 1250 year old is celebrating the same reason in 2014 , and the municipal reform is also 40 years back .
the council is targeting track systems
should the railway transition be laboriously reconstructed to reduce traffic safety ?
yes , the local councils have decided .
schiltach must provide eur 220 000 for this .
deutsche bahn is planning to open the kinzigtal railway next year .
in particular , it is intended to increase safety at railway crossings - there are regular collisions between trains and other vehicles across the country .
do the municipalities agree to the restructuring measures , they must contribute by one third to the costs , the rest share the railways and the federal government .
schiltach &apos;s mayor roland grießhaber explained to the local council the peculiarities of the bah transition &quot; am hirschen &quot; .
the city plans to build a new railway station in the same area , in the same way as the tunnelmund there to the west of the railway tracks .
larger vehicles , such as those transporting long-distance wood , could also be in contact with the traffic without the need to block the tracks .
greek owners therefore proposed to create a necessary support wall in such a way that the city could be the next street in due course .
this was discussed controversial in the local council , as some councils stressed the need for road distribution : thomas kipp put the mood of critics to the point : &apos; do we have to be so much money in so few vehicles &apos; ?
mayor thomas haas disagreed : the railway crossing &quot; hirschen &quot; was used regularly for long-distance transport .
even wood from the &quot; kuhbach &quot; area is partly transported over this route , because the vehicles up to 20 metres long make it impossible to use the route at the häberles bridge because they could not turn into the main road .
the route also serves as a redirecting for those vehicles that cannot use the tunnel when the main road is closed , arguably because of the fact that haas is not allowed to use it .
it is clear that the church mountain and castle tunnel are being reconstructed and renovated .
the councils agreed to investigate the costs of the planned extension of the road and to investigate the possible consequences .
despite this , several member states agreed to the restructuring of the railway transition , with the proviso that the necessary support wall should be built in such a way that the city could take the road that leads to the &quot; bahnhofstraße &quot; to &quot; ( 5,5 km ) for meeting point where necessary ) for meeting traffic .
the reconstruction of the railway crossing at the gerberium trautwein could , however , lead to a quite different problem , which would make it easier to access the grossly rising &quot; geroltshäuser weg &quot; .
the administration had to implement the railway reconstruction plans from the engineering office of the engineering company brunlinger , because she had doubts about whether the planned connection of the geroltshäuser would be possible without further ado .
the investigation concluded that it was not possible to rule out that the conditions of road inclination could lead to longer vehicles being seated .
the city , in turn , bears responsibility for this as a road loader .
the rebuilding could therefore lead to liability disputes .
since both the wood removal and the bending are working in the current state of expansion , the rebuilding of the railway transition should not be approved , haas argued .
it is also worth noting that there is a risk of a collision of the train with a vehicle on the transition stage that is much lower than the other crossings because the stop is right next to the middle , which is well connected .
even trains from the central station would have to be braked to the point where no collision threatens .
the majority of the members voted against the restructuring of this railway transition , as the city of schiltach has &quot; mastered &quot; the problem of vehicles in the way they are seated , as the railways are withdrawing responsibility from the construction work .
the board considers the modifications of the railway crossings &quot; before heubach &quot; and &quot; before kuhbach &quot; , for which the agreements with the railway have already been made .
esa decides on major space missions : missions for billions of people , for billions of dollars , for billions of dollars , for the world &apos;s largest projects : missions for billions of dollars , for billions of dollars ,
distant planets , gravitational waves or black holes - experts from the european space agency must now focus on two major projects that they will be able to launch in the next few years .
30 proposals were on the table , five are still in the race .
distant worlds .
more than 1000 planets in other stars have already found astronomers .
whether or not there are at least some of them , no one knows .
the choice is hard : if you are looking for gravitational waves ?
or would you prefer to explore the origin of the cosmos ?
or search for planets similar to earth , and thus discover alien life ?
these are the questions that the european space agency esa is responsible for .
for your program &quot; cosmic vision &quot; you are looking for ideas for two major space projects that will make a decisive contribution to the research .
the budget for such &quot; l missions &quot; is approximately eur 1 billion each .
the launch is expected to be in 2028 and 2034 .
in early september , the elite of european space research met in paris to put forward proposals for such missions .
thirty ideas were on the table , five of them have now come to the closer elections .
numerous bodies are assessing the proposals to make hooks for researchers .
a final decision is to be taken in the next few days by the scientific programme committee .
the esa has selected four major questions , to which the missions of the cosmic vision programme , which was launched in 2007 , should respond .
what are the conditions for the creation of planets and lives ?
the exact processes of the formation of stars from large gas clouds - and thus the creation of planets that convert these stars - are always in the spotlight .
a large infrared telescope in space could penetrate this dark .
and if a star owns planets , what circumstances can live there ?
in order to address this issue , the space telescope &quot; cheops &quot; is to be launched in 2017 , with which 500 already known planetary systems will be examined in more detail in our vicinity .
however , the possibilities are limited , cheops is a small mission with a budget of 150 million euros .
with larger instruments , astronomers could map earth like planets and even analyze the composition of their atmospheres , and thus search for &quot; biomarkers &quot; : gases that are considered indications of biological activity .
how does the solar system work ?
this issue , too , should ultimately be clarified as to what conditions exist for the creation of life .
magnetic activity is an important factor in a star and the interaction of its magnetic field and the magnetic field of particle radiation with the planetary x-ray system .
in our solar system , these processes can be investigated exemplarily .
with the &quot; solar orbiter &quot; , esa has already launched a m class mission ( where the budget is about half a billion euros ) for this question .
the probe was to start in 2017 and monitor the surface and activity of the sun closely .
it is also of great interest to researchers that jupiter and his moon are also present .
they want to find out what role the giant planet plays in the development of the solar system .
the esa sees this as the first of the three l-missions of the cosmic vision programme .
the probe &quot; juice &quot; ( jupiter icy moons explorer ) is expected to start their journey in 2022 .
eight years later , she reached jupiter and was supposed to experience the atmosphere of the planet and the icy moon of europe , kallisto and ganymed .
what are the basic physical laws of the universe ?
the space offers many possibilities to study and study matter in extreme conditions , and to investigate whether the laws of nature we know are still valid there .
perhaps there are also deviations that could pave the way for physicists to develop a new theory under which all known natural laws can be united .
how did the universe come into being and what is it made of ?
our company was created 13.7 billion years ago by the big bang .
in addition to the material we know , from the stars , planets and living beings as we exist , there are dark matter , whose gravity galaxies and galaxies are clustered together , and dark .
so far , researchers have not known which physical laws were enacted in the first fraction of the big bang , nor what dark words were derived from it .
with &quot; euclid &quot; , esa has already approved an m-mission here , which is scheduled to start in 2020 .
a special telescope is used to determine the distribution of the matter in the universe for the first time in the sky , thus providing information on the nature of dark matter and dark matter .
who could run the race
of the 30 proposals , only two are left at the end of the selection process .
the best chance of obtaining an l mission has , according to many experts , been &quot; e-lisa &quot; , a challenging concept for the detection of gravitational waves .
this means physicists understand changes in the structure of space , which albert einstein predicted nearly 100 years ago .
they have not been proven to date .
elisa could do that , hope the scientists behind the project .
the mission consists of two or three probes and is located in space .
it could also be gravitational wavelengths , unlike plants on earth , which were created at the big bang , and thus provide new insights into the formation of the cosmos .
four other proposals are still competing around the second l mission : a great x-ray telescope called &quot; athena &quot; , which includes black holes .
the hotel is located in the heart of the city , close to the main train station and the main train station .
snowden ready to cooperate with germany in terms of us surveillance ,
edward snowden , the whistleblower of the us intelligence service , has declared that he is ready to travel to berlin and to leave for the german bundestag if the american national security agency and its representative are present .
german mep hans-christian ströbele met snowden in russia on thursday , where he received asylum in order to discuss with him the statement in germany .
in a letter from snowden , which was sent to the media in berlin by ströbele on friday , he writes : “ although the outcome of my efforts was demonstrably positive , my government continues to treat a dissenting opinion as a dissentient .
but telling the truth is not a crime .
in the letter snowden writes that he is convinced that the support of the international community will convince the american government to withdraw the charge against him .
the united states department of justice ’ s indictment includes espionage and theft of state property .
german interior minister hans-peter friedrich said to time online : “ if mr snowden is prepared to talk to german representatives , then we will find ways to make that possible . ”
us-germany relations have been strained by claims that the nsa has not yet fully supported chancellor angela merkel ’ s cell phone .
thomas oppermann , the member who asked the parliamentary committee responsible for the secret service , said that we should take the opportunity to witness snowden as a witness , if that is possible , ‘ without jeopardising relations and strengthening relations ’ .
ströbele , a member of the greens , published a picture of himself and snowden in his twitter feed .
he was visited by two german journalists during his visit to russia .
ströbele explained that according to the lawyer of the former nsa employee snowden could not return to russia if he left the country .
if snowden in germany says , then he needs a assurance that he will be “ safe ” there , according to the honourable member .
snowden explains in his letter that he is committed to a “ serious and ongoing ” persecution campaign that would exclude him from his home country .
however , it was touched by the global response to “ my act of political expression . ”
citizens around the world , as well as high-level politicians – including in the united states – have been watching the revelations about an uncontrolled system of comprehensive surveillance as a credit to the general public .
in his letter , snowden makes a offer to the german authorities of cooperation “ if the humanitarian difficulties have been resolved ” .
frontier airlines charges a handling fee for hand baggage .
frontier airlines plans to invest up to 100 us dollars from passengers travelling on their flight .
frontier airlines intends to pay up to usd 100 for one piece of hand baggage and two dollars for coffee or lemonade , even though the announcement on wednesday was to be read that passengers were not paying the whole can .
the new fee applies to hand baggage in the luggage compartment above the seat , small bags under the seat are still free .
frontier said that it would be calculated to pay 25 us dollars in advance , and $ 100 in the case of passengers who arrive at the gate .
frontier spokeswoman kate o &apos;malley said the fee of 100 us dollars targets to encourage travellers to move ahead on payment .
“ we do not want to calculate this sum , ” she explained .
airlines began to pay for the first and second piece of baggage in 2008 .
passengers who tried to bypass them have therefore paid as much as possible in their hand baggage , which means that they are not allowed to carry luggage over the seat .
charges are a way of encouraging passengers to take less on board .
o &apos;malley said that the new fee is not really about making money .
it is about the most loyal customers of frontier who have clearly stated that it will be increasingly difficult to find a place in the compartment above the seat .
passengers who have purchased their tickets on the airline website do not have to pay .
this means that a passenger on the plane may be required to carry a baggage with him , the next person , but $ 100 for a similar piece of baggage .
o &apos;malley explained the site of frontier and the check-in procedures would be changed so that passengers would be informed of the charge before they travel to the gate .
frontier ’ s new hand baggage fee only enters into force in the summer , and a date is not yet in place .
passengers often smell of baggage allowances and other charges , but airlines like to resort to them .
they argue that the transportation of luggage costs money and passengers can pay for this service if they wish .
many on wall street view the new baggage charges as a sign that airlines are taking enough money to pay the cost of air travel after years of losses .
most , however , have so far been letting the fingers of hand baggage charges .
spirit airlines inc. requested three years ago the first charges for hand baggage and later allegiant air , also a low-cost airline .
the only other airline with such a charge is the hungarian wizz air , the airline advisor jay sorensen , who has paid the extra charges attentively .
he estimated in a report of december 2011 that the wrist hand baggage fee would bring in usd 50 million a year .
sorensen , who previously held a leading position at midwest airlines , is recently awarded with spirit .
“ the boarding process was one of the most smooth i have ever seen in my career in aviation .
i expected to crack teeth and handy discussions at the gate .
“ the plane was full , ” he said , “ and boarding ran as lumbered . ”
frontier also follows spirit with the 2 dollars that are used for coffee , tea , lemonade or juice .
the company stated that passengers who have to buy lemonade or juice must keep the whole can and buy coffee for free .
water is still free .
us airways had briefly tried to provide a refrigeration for soft drinks in 2008 , but made it undo seven months later , after passengers complained and no other major company had followed .
frontiers &apos; move to impose charges on hand baggage if passengers are not buying directly from the airline is the latest initiative to enable customers to access their own website .
airlines pay online travel agencies such as orbitz $ 10 to $ 25 per ticket sold .
this will give all companies an incentive to buy passengers directly from them rather than through an online travel agency .
however , frontier has gone the furthest in this area .
in september , the company began to offer only half the number of frequent flyer flights on booking through an online travel agency .
on wednesday , the mileage was increased to 25 percent of the route .
a contract with a third party with frontier over 1000 miles brings customers a single mileage of 250 miles .
passengers can also only buy tickets directly on the frontier website .
frontier has a loyal customer base at its headquarters in denver , but the business is shrinking and the company is losing money .
the proceeds were down by 9 % and the capacity was down by just under 13 percent in the first quarter , as the financial report , which was published on wednesday by the parent company , republic airlines .
republics has tried to use the company &apos;s sales to finance frontier .
proverbs come from the bible
some 40 women attended the last women ’ s breakfast this year in the evangelical parish of bisingen .
the theme of the day in the municipal house were &quot; proverbs from the bible &quot; and &quot; redemptions from the middle ages &quot; .
zita köhler , the chairman of the church council , went to a lecture on the biblical proverbs after breakfast .
&quot; proverbs contain wisdom , rules , or warnings , &quot; she explained .
she compared several proverbs with the corresponding bible posts and explained the meaning .
she called proverbs like : &quot; catch the hose , &quot; as scales fall from the eyes , cast an eye on someone who gives his lord &apos;s sleep , his hands in unguilty .
the speaker has repeatedly let her listeners know which proverb was the subject of this debate .
the medieval phrase used to refer to the church community of christ dehner .
she explained the importance and origin of the words she used to call &apos; bridges to the past &apos; .
in the end , a raffle was lost .
the price was covered on a table and were humorously rewritten before they were handed over to the winners .
among the visitors to the breakfast round , the mayor roman waizenegger mixed up .
learning instead of unemployed : pilot project for unskilled people in tourism
at the mecklenburgische lake-startetheite a pilot project for the tourism industry .
under the leadership of the german employment agency , 49 women and men who are already working as unskilled in the industry are to become professionals for hotels and restaurants over three winter years .
&quot; what is new is that the six-month courses end with degrees , &quot; said carmen wiechert of the employment agency neubrandenburg .
the benefits are diverse : the participants would not be unemployed , the firms would be trained professionals , who would be increasingly active in hotels and restaurants , and the agency would have to avoid financing unemployment .
the project also includes the chamber of commerce in neubrandenburg and the german hotel and restaurant association .
nsa declares that an “ internal error ” and not hackers are to blame for the crash of the site ’ s website , and not hackers are to blame for the crash of the site .
the shadowy national security agency said late friday that a mistake had left your public website a few hours lamented and not hackers , as was claimed online .
“ nsa.gov was unreachable for a few hours this night because during a planned update an internal error occurred , ” explained the espionage agency in an e-mail sent to us .
the problem will be fixed this evening .
the claim that the failure is due to a distributed denial of service attack ( ddos ) is a nonsense .
in the early hours of the evening , online server trackers noticed that the nsa website was not reachable for at least six hours and that this is still not possible for some users .
previously , a nsa spokesman had declared to abc news that the agency ’ s sensitive internal network was “ not at all ” compromised .
secret information is not in danger , the speaker says .
at least one group of hacktivists claimed to have created the nsa website with a ddos attack .
such attacks will cause the target site to be flooded with page views until the servers are overloaded and the site collapses .
cybertactics are relatively simple and the attacks do not serve to interfere with the internal network of the target system .
the former super-secret nsa , whose nickname once used to be no such agency , is now in the bright light of the public and is looking for the new ones that have emerged in recent months .
the growing dispute over intelligence has fueled initial speculation that the incident today is the result of a targeted and targeted cypersurgery .
the number of people without jobs fell slightly by 22 in october to 1.307 .
although the rate was better than last year , at 3.1 % , and better than in september , &apos; we would have hoped for more &apos; , says monika felder bauer , deputy head of the agency &apos;s business unit .
many businesses have reacted to recruitment practices .
one reason for this is , according to felder bauer : &quot; we have few skilled workers in the crafts , in the health sector and in the care of the elderly &quot; .
since september , job offers for employees in the hotel and restaurant sector have been running again due to the seasons .
the winter season begins there in mid-december .

losses in bombardier after declining supply and orders ,
the canadian aircraft and railway manufacturer bombardier inc reported a 15-percent increase in the net share of the profits on thursday after he had been hit by declining orders and deliveries on aircraft in the third quarter .
bombardier , based in montreal , also did not publish flight test data for his brand new cseries aircraft and did not provide any new information as to whether the aircraft was being delivered in accordance with the ambitious timetable for next september .
on the maiden flight of the test aircraft a month and a half ago , only three more were launched , which makes it questionable whether the test phase is proceeding as planned .
the results have fallen short of the forecasts and led to a drop in the share price of more than eight percent at the toronto stock exchange .
cameron doerksen , analyst at national bank financial , reduced his assessment of “ outreach ” on “ sector performance ” in terms of how the bank ’ s shares are expected to grow in the next one or two quarters .
“ although weaker delivery figures for aircraft were expected to the greatest extent , the margins in the transport sector were clearly disappointed , ” says doerksen in a customer letter .
we believe that bombardier should place new orders for the cseries if the test program for the aircraft is progressing .
if , however , no new orders are announced in the coming months , we expect the market to become more sceptical about the programme .
bombardier hopes that the cseries aircraft will take the company to the lower market segment of catapultised , which is currently being developed by boeing and airbus .
the first test aircraft was presented to the public in march and flew for the first time in september after months of delays .
however , binding orders for the cseries have been moderate at 177 , as potential buyers are waiting for the results of the flight tests and want to see if the company ’ s claims regarding fuel efficiency and cost-saving potential of the new nozzle are accurate .
there are currently 403 orders and commitments from 15 customers and companies .
ceo pierre beaudoin is confident that bombardier will achieve his goal of 300 binding orders at the beginning of commercial use of the jet .
on thursday , the management insured against analysts and the media that the program was in the schedule .
“ the test aircraft has stopped standing on the ground than expected , ” said beaudoin at a telephone conference and added that during the flight ’ s life there were ground tests and software updates scheduled .
each manufacturer plans differently .
we have decided to take a first flight and then to add a period of reworking , which we have done .
this is happening throughout the entire programme .
the second of five test aircraft is expected to start in the next few weeks , the rest shortly after , it was said by the company side .
yet analysts remain skeptical about whether 12 months after the maiden flight the first customer will be able to take a cseries aircraft into service .
bombardier explained that it will check the planning for commissioning ( ice ) and will be updated in the coming months .
“ the slow progress of the flight test – even though it seems to be in line with bombardier ’ s internal planning – reinforces our view that commissioning should be postponed to the first quarter of 2015 , ” said doersen .
in the third quarter , at the end of september 30 , bombardier ’ s net gain fell to $ 147 million , or $ 8 cents per share , from $ 172 million , respectively , to $ 9 cents per year earlier .
the adjusted profit per share is 9 cents .
sales decreased slightly , falling from 4.2 to 4.1 billion dollars .
analysts had a profit of 10 cents per share and a turnover of 4.56 billion dollars , so thomson reuters i / b / e / s .
the world ’ s fourth largest aircraft manufacturer says that it has delivered 45 aircraft in this quarter , a decline of 57 last year .
net orders fell from 83 aircraft to 26 .
the order book for the aerospace division was 32.9 billion dollars on 30 september , and was thus unchanged compared to 31 december .
“ in the aerospace sector , the results were within our limits , but the low order intake and the overall market conditions were disappointing , ” said beaudoin .
sales in the aerospace division fell by 13 percent to two billion dollars .
bombardier , the world ’ s largest railway manufacturer , announced that sales in this sector were down by just under 11 percent to $ 2.1 billion .
the transport division ’ s order book stood at $ 32.6 billion on 30 september , slightly increasing compared with 31 december .
the profit margin in the area of transport was reduced by resolution problems in some major contracts .
according to the management , there will be new requirements for the fourth quarter .
in the afternoon trading on thursday , the bombardier share dropped by 8.5 percent and stood at 4.83 canadian dollars after it was announced that the google financial board would support patrick pichette .
the brazilian embraer sa , the world ’ s third largest commercial aircraft manufacturer and bombardier ’ s closest rival , reported a 10 % decline in quarterly profit on thursday .

cocaine addicted lawyer , the drug boss warned against police investigation , must be put in prison .
basharat ditta , 42 , gave information on underworld size neil scarborough further .
the lawyer was afraid that his secret drug dependence might come to light .
it was founded by the liverpool crown court to three years in prison .
a well-known criminal defender who has a drug baron in front of a major police investigation because he was afraid to declare his secret drug addiction was too late for three years .
basharat ditta , 42 , supplied underworld size neil scarborough with sensitive information on investigations of its activities in the drug trade after he had been replaced by his own cocaine addiction .
the “ first ” crime prize , praised by criminalists , with the nickname “ bash ” , was arrested in his house in 2011 , after the police took over scarborough , whom he had previously been in a police force .
officials observed how scarborough ( 32 ) had three bags cocaine at the house of lawyer in blackburn , lancashire , abbreviated while this was working with colleagues at a dinner of the bar .
the investigation revealed that ditta regularly uses class a drugs , which were used after testing had found traces of cocaine in his hair , on his wallet , and on credit cards .
over a period of eight months between january and august 2011 , he tried to obtain unauthorised information on the arrest of two men on behalf of scarborough and one of his partners .
all four suspects were arrested by the police at the time in a major investigation into the heroin and cocaine trade in lancashire , cumbria , merseyside , berkshire and west .
together with 32 other people , they were arrested later after the police had been killed in a series of house searches for heroin and cocaine worth £ 1.5 million and £ 200,000 in cash .
ditta , 42 , passed information to the criminals because he feared that his drug addiction could become public .
today ditta , who is responsible for the law firm forbes solicitors in blackburn , was listed on the liverpool crown court after a three-week trial in two charges for disabled people .
he gave the cocaine ownership on an earlier survey .
the lawyer was transferred after the police were not allowed to take part in their investigations against scarborough , finding that he was arrested on a regular basis in february 2011 .
two investigators followed the suspect and saw how he was sentenced to ditta &apos;s house and banned drugs with a purity of 60 % in a black glove under the moll .
shortly after he had delivered the drugs , scarborough regularly telephoned with ditta , who was on the street at the dinner in the blackburn rovers stadium in ewood park .
the lawyer returned home , took the drugs and then nine members of the police were expelled .
in court , ditta became known as a “ regular consumer ” of cocaine after drugs from the class a test were found in his hair , his wallet , and on his credit cards .
ditta was later arrested , but refused to take cocaine and said he had been with the alleged dealer that he was not able to meet his client , and claimed that her discussion was subject to discussion .
during his arrest , ditta took his wallet and tried to buy a series of credit cards , but they were secured and he was given a hair check .
in the case of police interrogation , he said that he was operating a police office under his private address and at work , and clients would be calling him at home for legal matters .
he was known to be important actors in the drug trade , some of which he had previously represented , after significant arrests and informed what the investigation was about .
prosecutor anne whyte said : “ a criminal attorney should know better than anyone that the law cannot be broken . ”
ditta will not be able to prosecute the abuse of his position as a criminal defender , because he has been too involved with certain clients .
the relationship in question is not simply that of a drug dealer , but of a drug dealer who supplies his lawyer with drugs .
part of his communications was undoubtedly legitimate , because he was the advocate of these people .
but that went far beyond the bounds of a normal relationship between lawyer and client .
he was involved in police investigations as much as possible , so that he could continue to pursue criminal activities .
mr ditta has thus discredited his profession .
he was too close to certain clients , especially scarborough , and he allowed his independence to be compromised .
ditta pointed out any misconduct and claimed : “ if i am a corrupt lawyer , what i am not , and information to scarborough , i would be very grateful .
but after the hearing , superintent lee halstead said of the police in lancashire : “ mr ditta took the step from a criminal defender to a criminal at the moment he began to drugs .
his cocaine dependence led to hopeless compromises and made him receptive to the motives of leading members of organized crime who charged him with valuable information on police investigations .
lawyers must be able to maintain the highest standards of integrity and to ensure public confidence and confidence .
ditta has lost this trust and tried to hide behind the facade of his profession .
the serious and organized crime unit of lancashire was the head of the investigation against ditta , which also led to a conviction in three cases for the possession of cocaine and disability of justice .
this case should be a warning to criminals and show that no one can escape the arm of the law .
we find them and bring them to justice .
scarborough himself was sentenced to 14 years in prison after he joined the conspiracy to kill heroin , cocaine , and cannabis .
thirty-five other &apos; people involved in the drug trade have been sentenced to total sentences of 153 years for drug offences .
ditta published a section with questions and answers about himself , where he indicated his dream job was to be to be considered a lawyer client .
revolutionary work of church music
to conclude the celebrations of its 160-year existence , the liederkranz dunningen will host two services of worship with the &quot; deutsche messe &quot; by franz schubert .
after the great success of the musicals &quot; rock my life &quot; , which the viewers will be delighted in spring this year , the song crane will be closed at the end of the anniversary year two services with the performance of the german music .
on saturday 26 october , this extraordinary fair will take place from 19 at the evening fair in st. martinskirche dunningen and on sunday 27 october , from 10 : 15 a.m. at the divine service in the city of st. john .
the so-called german fair with the original title &quot; singing for the celebration of the holy sacrifice of the fair &quot; , d 872 , is a spiritual music work by the composer franz schubert from 1826 and 1826 .
the fair is held in the framework of the services of god , as the client johann philipp neumann intended .
under the leadership of hermann schneider , the choir is led by the brass band of the musikverein freusinn tennenbronn and noemi lokodi at the organ .
haslach – skepticism is increasingly diminishing confidence , and confidence is shaping up .
the elections to the parish council in 2015 , for example , will bring a new dimension to the haslach ( se ) seafaring unit .
there is only one common council of parish councils for all six parishes .
at a joint meeting on saturday the hasslach , hofstetten , mühlenbach , fischerbach , steinach and welschensteinach committees prepared for the changes .
the fact is that the fundamental decisions of the diocese are still unchanged and it is up to the local councils to make them as satisfactory as possible .
during the day , it became particularly clear that the scepticism toward the new , reluctant but increasingly confident , has been growing .
the ideas and expectations for the innovations in 2015 and the concrete proposals for the future composition and size of the parish council were the most constructive discussions of the six bodies with the main groups .
regional dean georg schmitt explained the redefined guidelines for seafaring units in the archdiocese by means of a presentation .
after that , se haslach , as a parish of the church , will form a body of public law that is bound up with the rights and duties of the six individual church communities that have been established up to now .
there is only one common parish council and a board of trustees , in which the priest is appointed .
every parish should have at least two elected members , in the six parish churches , so called public and private groups .
in the future , it will be their task to promote the church &apos;s life in the area .
when it comes to the finances of the individual parish , there was a great need for discussion .
the innovations provide that accumulated credit will be stored in the parish ring-fenced .
liabilities , on the other hand , go to the entire community .
it is precisely with regard to the major planned investments , the obligation of which all the parishes meet , that there were great concerns .
&quot; in the past , too , only investments were made in projects that were managed by the individual parish councils , &quot; said haslachs parish church council president .
practical experience with a common board for five parishes depicted barbar ritter , the chairman of the board of the seafaring unit of the schutterwald-neuried lake district .
they had set themselves the task in 2006 of becoming one , staying five , and found that it was not so easy .
the bodies of the haslach soul group then set to discuss the questions of the future composition and size of the common parish council and the practical work of the municipal teams .
the work will be made more concrete in further meetings and will be discussed at another joint meeting of all six bodies next spring .
in the end , the parish council michael schöner from steinach presented the new logo of the seelsorgunity , which was approved by a clear majority .
in pfullendorf , the electricity is produced more expensive than the electricity generated by the city &apos;s electricity .
the citizens of pfullendorf must be prepared for higher electricity costs .
as the managing director of the stadtwerke , jörg-arne bias , confirmed to the south kurier , a four-headed pflendorfer family from 70 to 90 euros extra costs per year are added .
the main reason for the forthcoming price increase is the increase in the so-called ec levy of 5.277 to 6.3 cents per kilowatt-hour .
this levy is calculated every year in october by the four operators of the major electricity routes .
these figures are the ones that will result from the change in energy , which will be covered by a levy on the electricity price .
the city works of pfullendorf are the last link in this chain .
the supervisory board of the energy company was even convinced in its forecasts of a higher levy , as jörg-arne bias reported .
now the actual figures should be calculated before the town factories inform their customers next week about the exact price increase .
&quot; we are expecting an increase of 1 cent plus x , &quot; says bias , with the number more close to the 2 cent .
light on permanent red : keep on waiting for the next time .
sometimes a light simply does not turn green .
the contact loop in the road does not respond , or the light sign is broken .
what should we do then - driving in red ?
has a person been affected by this long enough waiting at a red light and the intersection is free , he can continue , the stuttgart lawyer ralf becker explains in the magazine &quot; motorrad &quot; .
the waiting time must be &quot; reasonable &quot; , which varies from one case to the next .
becker advises that at least five minutes should be left before the traffic lights get disturbed .
if you want to continue the journey despite the red lights , you must be aware that you will be responsible for the full liability of an accident that has been caused .
those who tolerate less than five minutes may not wait long enough , warns becker and refers to a decision by the supreme court of hamm .
in the case under discussion , a driver had the amplitude of ignoring the light after about three minutes and had to opt for a negligent red light violation .
the traffic lights were not defective , but rather jumped to green shortly afterwards .
he was not allowed to drive because of the special situation - but the fine was not .
the council of ministers is delighted with the solid budget and the solid budget of the local councillor .
whenever there are community councils dealing with the budget , mayor ralph gerster laughs well .
the community bag in herdwangen-schönnach is well filled and the administration has not known the administration since 2005 .
the 2012 financial year can also be considered a complete success in this respect .
this was confirmed when the annual accounts were presented for 2012 .
as andrea rothmund explained , the administrative budget was set at around eur 7.6 million , above a million .
the administrative budget surplus would also be around eur 1.8 million , which would be around eur 1 million above the approach .
the surplus is mainly due to higher business tax revenue and the community &apos;s share of income tax .
the asset budget was also well above the planned values .
instead of the eur 1.5 million envisaged , it was eur 2.5 million last year .
&quot; this is mainly due to the higher allocation from the administrative budget , &quot; says rothmund .
since there was less investment than planned in 2012 , the commission &apos;s retention rate is also higher .
overall , the overall reserve was reduced by around eur 2.1 million to a total of eur 4.9 million .
mayor ralph gerster thanked rothmund and her team for their good work .
&quot; this is not just a work that you shake out of your sleeve , &quot; gerster praised with a view to the annual accounts .
he and the local councils were obviously pleased with the good figures .
it may sound paradoxical , but it is these very good figures that could soon cost the citizens dear .
due to the good financial situation , the community has been able to avoid high levels of leverage in the past .
this , in turn , has been said by gerster to have cut subsidies from the country on many occasions .
the commission has proposed a new approach to this aid from various compensatory sticks .
the towns and communities that receive subsidies must , among other things , be able to show certain levels of leverage .
&quot; the issue of hoists must be looked at , because there are investments to be made in the coming years , for which we would like to have subsidies , &quot; gerster announced in this context .
nagold : hugo wermter has been in the choral for 60 years in hugo wermter for 60 years .
with 60 years as a singer , hubert wermter ’ s story is with the men ’ s singing association cacilia almost twice as long as that of the herbsfeste , in which he was honoured .
hubert wermter stood in the colours of his male singer ’ s band as usual .
after 60 years , he is still able to sing with the now probably well-won chorus .
wermter was also active in the association , including for 28 years as a member of the committee .
he received a very good honor for his commitment and his loyalty : jörg kohr , pastoral referee on behalf of the cäcilienverband rottenburg-stuttgart , who presented him .
his singer colleagues handed him the german choral band &apos;s certificate and a graviated zinnteller .
in addition to the award , the 31st autumn festival was held in the usual trainings : with mgv betra , the liederkranz salzstetten , the singer department baisingen and the local music association .
the mgv vollmaringen opened with atmospheric songs like &quot; im weinparadies &quot; and &quot; funny , her brothers &quot; .
in the last few years , the band has been a member of the international association of the german association for the promotion of the german social democratic republic ( bmbf ) .
the men &apos;s singing association betra sang also classical choral songs like &quot; hunters &quot; by julius wengert , &quot; far , far away &quot; by hubert goisern and the folk song &quot; .
the liederkranz salzstetten , with its mixed choir and its women &apos;s group - the &quot; impulse &quot; - provided the women &apos;s quota for the festival .
the mixed choir abducted with the neapolitan folk song &quot; santa lucia &quot; and &quot; eviva espana &quot; by antos gus to foreign lands , while the &quot; impulse &quot; also abducted foreign languages .
the singer department of the baisinger sports association came up with &quot; what isch der schwob ? &quot; by hans süsmuth and robert papperts &quot; bierlied &quot; back in the home film industry .
the children were given a small programme - &quot; oma hanne &quot; alias hannelore stollsteimer performed a kasperl theatre and read some stories that the children had about well employed at lunch .

kenyan press outraged at controversial media law
“ we are in a daunting situation and one may ask : what does parliament think of simply disregarding the judicial independence tomorrow ?
“ the law is draconian and very punishable and we reject it , ” cyrus kamau , managing director of the capital group , who also includes capitalfm , said one of the most respected independent radio stations .
he said that the new media tribunal “ will always be biased , because it is an extended arm of the government , ” and restrictions on content and advertising would be kenya ’ s position in the global economy .
“ i hope the president will listen to us and we appeal to him to reject this bill and to return it to parliament , ” he said .
according to the star newspaper , the government is taking the new law “ effectively the media into a stranglehold ” , while the standard , democracy , and freedom of speech in kenya would have suffered “ a heavy blow , ” and betitelte .
the adoption of the law is one of a series of measures which will improve national security following the attacks by armed islamists on the west gas market .
the kenyan media have been attracting the authorities ’ anger because they have published photographs of security cameras showing how the people involved in the crime were being shot .
david kimaiyo , the chief of the police , responded by appointing two journalists and a leading media representative , even though the subpoena was a result of a media outcry .
under the new law , media houses can be punished with a penalty of up to 20 million kenyan schillings and individual journalists with up to one million and the further risk of losing their professional recognition or being excluded from official press access .
the tribunal also has the right to seize the possession of those affected if a penalty is not paid .
according to daily nation , “ even one single punishment can bankrupt most radio stations . ”
furthermore , the newspaper believes that these measures could have a devastating effect on the “ lively blogosphere ” of kenya , as you describe it .
if you silence the media , politicians could go unpunished , whatever they want .
“ no one will ever know , ” mutuma mathiu , journalist at the nation that has been using the kenyan media as a decisive factor in public control .
“ leaving politicians to their own devices , let them bankrupt the country and let us return to the time of hunters and collectors , ” he commented .
kenyan legislators have been running the public trouble in the past .
in may , they voted to reduce the amount of compensation ordered by the national compensation commission .
bad-dürrheim : a dream comes true for the fc .
the importance of the city and the football club was dismissed as official opening ceremony for the artificial turf sports field despite the cold weather and the rain .
the hotel was very clean and the staff were very helpful .
so all those who had lost their sight without umbrella or who had not kept one for any reason .
this was done to the musicians who framed the ceremony , as well as to many speakers .
wet was also the fc chairman albrecht schlenker , who spoke of fulfilling a dream .
his gratitude was to the fore mayor walter klumpp , who was very committed to the implementation of the project , the municipal council , the companies involved and members of the association that came into being .
here , especially lothar hero , paul weizenegger , heiner gail and peter graf .
the retired people laid 400 square metres of pavement stones for the new paths .
this remarkable volunteer commitment also honoured the landtag member karl rombach .
further greeting words were addressed to the municipal sports committee hubert baier , district chairman of the south badian football association , kuno kayan , and friedrich knorr from the planning office of the city of berlin .
mayor klumpp reminded us that recurring weather related influences in spring and autumn are due to the original lawn in such a way that it could not be played .
the first reflections on how to solve the problem were already 15 years ago , when construction of a third place at the football club or at the real school on the salinensee .
both were rejected again .
six years ago , thoughts were raised about the creation of an artificial turf sports ground , which was generally regarded as the ultimate solution .
concrete plans were launched two years ago when the fc opened the schabelstube in erbacht , a cost share of eur 100 000 for the construction of the site and the country was receiving eur 104 000 .
the local council decided in october 2012 to take over the remaining 356 000 euros from the total cost of 560 000 euros , klumpp summarised .
the construction of the 68 x 108 m artificial turf was started on june 4 .
during the construction phase lasting more than three months , 3000 cubic metres of earth were carried away , half of which was used for the creation of a dirt bike route .

the relevant working group was also met in berlin in the morning .
it is about direct democracy , bribery for members and the federal police .
the migration and integration working group also wanted to continue its deliberations this morning .
this should include , among other things , dual citizenship , where both sides have conflicting ideas .
the spd wants to reduce the pressure on immigrant children born in germany to choose one - the union is opposed to a double passport .
the issue of transport , which is not on the agenda for this friday , was underpinned by the spd in its rejection of a csu call for toll on cars .
a vignette is a &quot; flat rate for multiplied driving and thus environmentally counterproductive &quot; , the spd negotiator declared for transport , florian pronold , in a letter to his group .
there were risks of evasive traffic on rural roads , which were already the main areas of accident .
the introduction of a toll for all cars would also be a first step from the perspective of pronolds .
&quot; there is a risk that the compensation will be paid for germans at a later stage , &quot; he said .

airport vienna creates passenger calls from customers
mr max maier , please come to gate 24 .
breakthroughs like this will be impossible at wien-schwechat airport in the future .
most of the speakers are lost - the noise level is to be reduced so much that it is possible to do so .
creating a more relaxed atmosphere is the goal of this innovation .
as peter kleemann ’ s airport-spokesman announced to radio vienna , vienna airport follows the course of the recruitment of announcements concerning individuals , an international trend .
for example , the airports in copenhagen , frankfurt or dubai are already refusing to make the noisy calls .
by eliminating these averages - on average , around 200 personal calls from the loudspeakers a day - there will be more quiet at the airport in the future .
&quot; it has also been shown in experience that these individual announcements have been perceived relatively little , but at the same time all other information on changed flight and departure times has been somewhat lost here , &quot; says kleemann in the interview .

sleepless in new york
on the way to your host families in weymouth , massachusetts , the students of the black forest school learned the american grand city of new york .
after eight hours of flight , the brooklyn bridge was just off the road , which was a walk to the heart of the city , manhattan .
here a fascinating view of the world famous skyline , which was built in the evening light , gave a special charm .
the time shift meant that students were on their feet for almost 24 hours , but faithfully , the motto &quot; the city does not sleep &quot; was decided on the day at times square .
despite shutdown , the liberty statue was rebuilt on the second day with a ferry and was knocked down on foot .
the financial centre was then on wall street as the memorial of september 11 .
on the third day , the students were able to take part in the observation platform of the empire-state building , which is located 373 metres high , and gain an overview of the fascinating city while enjoying the view .
after that , the hectic pace of new york streets over rockefeller center went to central park , which is an ideal opportunity to spend a short time in the autumn sun .
after a short flight from new york to boston , students have now arrived in their host families and experience the weymouth high school .
this year , the name of the holy hubertus is celebrated in the parish church of st. marien at hulsbergstraße , a hubertus fair .
st. hubertus was a rather ruthless hunter , who was driven by a vision and later turned to the bishop of liège .
the hunting horn group of the western falcon hunting tribes , led by brigitte kluth , is performing on parforcehorns ( nature horns in the mood ) according to old , originally french melodies .
the breasts wear riding clothes because they are mainly riders , horses and dog owners on bad conditions .
the festive fair takes place on sunday , november 3 , at 11.30 a.m.
the newly designed option-shake shines with a new cafe .
one that allows you to stay and return .
one that wants to make the name of the program .
déjà vu is a psychological term , according to the dictionary , which is expressed in the feeling of having a new situation before or having seen .
in the case of visiting the café of the same name at the opschlag in the district town of kleve , within sight of the university of rhine-waal , it does not have to remain a pure déjà vu feeling .
finally , the café with its beautiful name has the very aim of making a real stay not only mentally but also hand-crafted , always enjoyable .
because it &apos;s fun and simply beautiful .
a look at the inner life at opschlag 8 gives the viewer a good feeling at first hand .
the ultra-modern , but not cool , café-ambience looks like a place to feel at ease .
here the team pampers the founders mirjam van der stelt and daniel büttner at the top with various coffee-and cocktail varieties .
the restaurant offers delicious cakes or individually prepared fresh baguettes .
the owner , both 33 years old , has already registered for the opening of the lovely café at the opschlag as a gastronomic specialty. in kranenburg they conducted the &quot; art lounge &quot; .
from the move to kleve to the opschlag , the friendly cafe-lovers are hoping for more audience .
not least by the university .
&quot; we don &apos;t have a specific target group &quot; , daniel büttner emphasizes .
the two students here would rather like to address the issue of the elderly and the elderly .
speaking of cafe-lovers .
the friendly owner couple is behind the coffee enjoyment .
enjoy the fragrant hot tanning in a variety of different variations .
expressofan
daniel büttner is more the expresso fan and mirjam van der stelt the cappuccino drinker .
&quot; a baguette is my thing , &quot; she tells the nrz .
two events have already been held in the bright café .
better , one .
the port festival was held outside , and café déjà vu did not benefit from it .
but there was also the ringelnatzevening .
&quot; beautiful , successful and funny &quot; , the two 33-year-olds found .
but not everyone &apos;s business .
perhaps daniel büttner is not a fan of event-evenings either : &quot; you can &apos;t be alone !
and with an event i always talk to those who are also interested in the special event .
that is why events will be the exception .
&quot; we want to disrupt normal operation as little as possible &quot; .
should it be : déjà vu also stands for reliability .
in terms of the quality of the products offered here , as well as the team and the beautiful surroundings at the opschlag in kleve .
the road , which is becoming more and more a gastronomic mile .
to the delight of many klevers , guests from near and far and students who want to visit the gastromile and thus the café déjà vu for themselves .

a day of thanks to the mgv in dinker
it was the 165th anniversary of the foundation of the mgv &quot; friedrich wilhelm dinker &quot; , which was attended by 52 guests , active singers and their wives , who were happy to come .
in the club restaurant witteborg in dinker genossen all the harmonious coexistence was born in the name of music .
traditionally , the foundation festival is always the right festival to honor .
about the special award &quot; singer of the year &quot; was the occasion for the remembrance of writer rolf wagener .
&quot; you have not only written much for us , but you have also turned some laps for us , for which our heartfelt thanks &quot; , says the chorus erich schlotmann .
the awards for participation in the performances and choir rehearsals by means of activity shoots were presented this year to the choral director dieter schulze with 44 participations , followed by the honorary chairman horst pier-b.
the first of the four finalists was the artur brückner .
a special thank you was given by the board to the team of association insider pier-ribbert , who once again created a menu of the extra class and sent to gerda pier-ribbert for table decoration .
the mgv &quot; friedrich-wilhelm &quot; meets at his regular choir rehearsals at 7.45 p.m. in the club hall .
&quot; new sangle-loving voices are always welcome &quot; , schlotmann said .
un announces new goals in poverty reduction .
the united nations is now starting to work out a series of new objectives to meet the millennium development goals announced 12 years ago in order to combat poverty .
in the run-up to the un summit on sustainable development , which began in rio de janeiro in the evening , australian diplomats played a key role in pushing for “ sustainable development goals ” that will bring about the 2015 millennium development goals .
they were included in the final draft of the document drawn up by world leaders , including mrs gillard , at the summit .
un secretary-general ban ki-moon said at the summit last night that the time was right to think ‘ about national interests ’ .
“ i am pleased that the member states have agreed to initiate a process that will enable universal access to sustainable development goals .
“ these goals are based on our progress from the millennium development goals and will form an integral part of the framework for development after 2015 .
i will spare no effort to support this proposal , which has been given to me by the member states , in order to achieve our vision of sustainable development objectives , which is based on the success of the millennium goals . ”
even though the sg achim / baden has been without victory for four days , the handball oberligist continues to be in good mood .
this is where trainer tomasz malmon leaves no doubt .
all are still fully motivated .
i hope , however , that we will finally win again .
&quot; for i don &apos;t know how a victory tastes anymore , &quot; malmon expects a success story from his team .
even if the third league reserve from fredenbeck is not yet a tree , the third league reserve , in the run-up to the event , alerts malmon .
many players i have trained myself in the a-youth .
they will therefore be able to be particularly motivated against their ex-coach .
&quot; it is also important to see whether reinforcement from the first one is available , &quot; the sg-coach clearly states .
to finally return to the track of success , the malmon team must be more than happy with the previous performances .
in the areas of coverage and the haperte shift , in particular , it has been a huge hit .
the exploitation of opportunities must definitely also improve .
i hope that my players will finally get their heads free during the short break .
security concerns in mozambique are growing in the face of clashes between influential personalities and politicians .
thousands of people gathered in the center of maputo under the watchful eyes of the statue of samora machel , the founder of the state and first president of mozambique to attend a rare public demonstration calling for peace .
“ we want peace again , we want stability , ” vanessa de sousa , managing director of an investment company , said .
for fear of the country ’ s future , it has tied its business clothes against a t-shirt with the inscription “ we demand security ” in portuguese and on thursday it was on the independence square of the capital .
for two weeks , there have been reports almost daily of clashes between government forces and renamo , which have led to the worst battles since the peace agreement over 20 years ago .
renamo was once a notorious rebel movement , initially supported by white ruled rhodesia and later by apartheid government in south africa .
after the 1992 peace treaty , it became an opposition party .
analysts find it unlikely that the country will return to a full-scale conflict , but recent events have left foreign investors and domestic concerns uneasy .
the fast-growing economy is at stake , because discovering huge gas deposits off the coast and coal mines in the north-west could be a major investment in over 50 billion us dollars of companies like rio tinto .
the ruling frelimo party , which has been the dominant force since 1975 , and renamo blames each other for the tensions .
renamo claims that the government has provoked recent clashes by inviting its members to the province of sofala , a traditional renamos stronghold on 17 october .
the attacks on the former rebels escalated when government troops renamo bases attacked attacks on and tried to stop afonso dharma .
the government is blaming renamo for the clashes and accuses the organization of having attacked soldiers .
president armando guebuza has tried to play down concerns about instability .
the french news agency , afp , said that on wednesday , dhlakama would prove to be a “ loser , ” the “ all its remaining ones ” .
frelimo and renamo both emphasize that they want to avoid war .
but concerns have increased since mazanga quoted the words renamo gave the peace agreement of 1992 to the letter .
he said to the ft that he meant that frelimo would no longer respect the agreement .
“ our vision is to reopen negotiations and to start serious negotiations , ” said mazanga .
earlier talks between the parties have done little to resolve the tensions caused by a series of clashes this year .
“ we have two adults men here ( guebuza and dhlakama ) who have the heads clashing , ” says joseph hanlon , lecturer at the open university and mozambique .
none of them is well negotiated , and none is prepared to make the necessary concessions .
renamo , who pushed for electoral reform , has already declared that she will boycott the november local elections .
presidential and parliamentary elections are scheduled for next year .
some commentators have described the use of force as an attempt by a ailing movement to seek concessions and financial benefits from the government .
renamo ’ s election successes have been shrinking since 1992 , while a newer party , founded by a former renamo member , is the moçambique moçambique ( mdm ) party , presumably .
mazanga claims that guebuza – whose resignation is due when his second term ends next year – is destroying the country ’ s democracy .
“ he does not want multi-party democracy , he does not want transparent elections , he does not want peace because he does not want to give up the presidency , ” says mazanga .
it is unclear what capacity renamo has , but it has caused unrest attacks on police stations and vehicles on an important north-south link .
most of the battles took place in the province of sofala , which is a few hundred kilometers north of maputo , but in which beira is located , the port , the mining companies such as rio tinto and vvvv .
in june , rio interrupted the use of the railway for a month after renamo announced an attack on the line .
mazanga responded cautiously to the question of whether renamo would repeat this threat .
renamo wanted to “ warn the international community that things are not going well in mozambique , ” said mazanga .
instability has triggered frustration with the government , says fernando lima , head of mediacoop , an independent media company , because many people were already concerned about corruption , the slow pace of change .
“ people think that the government and the president are responsible for the country ’ s future , and he should be the one who finds solutions to the problems , ” he explains .
omar sultane , a demonstrator , said that people simply wanted stability .
&quot; renamo and frelimo are not interested , they just want peace and usable roads , &quot; he explained .
children should call myths and legends “ a role model for life , ” an author says .
the stories of thor showed that “ brutal force has no chance against clever tricks , ” and the artus legend demonstrates how important it is to build a dream .
many myths , however , are “ far too wild , too offensive , and , in some cases , too dirty to be taught in schools . ”
“ i find it wonderful that in america myths and folklore are already part of education , ” he said .
i have been proposing this as a plan for twenty years .
he added that there is a lot of interest among authors and teachers who are “ excessively didactic , ” because in entertaining stories , children would “ turn off ” .
crossley holland , the beowulf from anglo-saxon , and author of the penguin book of norse myths and the british folk tales , explained : “ you can ’ t be wrong .
perhaps the greatest difference between an adult author who writes for adults and an author who writes for children is the need to create hope .
not everything needs to be simplified or lead to happy ending , but there is an immanent sense of good and evil .
this must be underlined , history must be revealed , and not explained .
this is the old story of showing instead of telling .
hansjakob is revisiting freihof again , but hansjakob is revisiting freihof .
100 years ago , heinrich hansjakob established his retirement home in haslach , and on sunday his last years were living in the &quot; freihof &quot; .
the many spectators were impressed by the extremely circular scene game .
from arrival to the award of honorary citizenship to his death , script writer and hansjacobs actor alois kraftzcyk had an entertaining piece designed to make it a reality under the direction of elia .
marcus zagermann took the audience as a speaker with through the ten different scenes , explained connections and bridged time jumps from the youth to the approaching retirement .
on october 22 , 1913 , hansjakob heim entered his childhood ’ s skies , in his open-air courtyard .
and then began the scene game in which alois krafczyk once again appeared in his paraderolle as the great son of the city .
he continued with the two shaper and &quot; black forest foxes &quot; by erich becherer , mühlenbach .
it was not only received with much applause by the audience , but also by his sister philippine , he was welcome .
billy sum hermann understood it incredibly well to become involved in the role of the sister and gave her a lot of experience in mimics and gestures .
between the scenes the mill of the peasant chapel played selected music pieces and rounded off the performance .
there was then a new party called the mayor heinz winkler to give the honour of the honorary citizen , who was the representative of the then incumbent hättich , together with a part of the city council .
their appearance made the tri-king singers , the hansjacob led to the call : &quot; oh how beautiful , there are again youth memories of my own tri-king period alive &quot; .
with her song &quot; o jesulein &quot; they enjoyed the audience in the freihof as well as the storchentagskinder with their loud &quot; out , out &quot; .
his criticism of the church was as much expressed by hansjacob as his concerns about the excesses of agriculture , the consequences of industrialisation or the effects of war .
in the home , behind its tomb chapel on fire near hofstetten , he found his resting place .
&quot; a restless spirit had finally found its peace and had gone home forever , &quot; it was said at the end of the scene .
much applause and many praises were given by the audience for the performance .
basketball : the hope of the neckar giants grows the hope of the giant neckar giants grows growing .
the chances of remaining in the league of the sporty sidelined ludwigsburg bundesliga basketball players have increased .
if there is a wildcard procedure , there is no problem for the neckar giants .
the hamburg towers basketball project does not apply for a job for a possible after-work place .
&quot; we will not participate in the wildcard process , &quot; said ex-national player pascal roller , who has been the concept for a professional club in the hanseatic city since 2012 .
a first breathing was not possible from ludwigsburg .
&quot; we did not deal with the wildcard process until it was clear that düsseldorf does not receive a licence , &quot; said neckar-riesen-boss alexander reil of our newspaper .
until may 23rd , climbers can still download baskets from the arbitration court and submit their economic bundesliga suitability .
until now , however , the rhine countries have been denied the licence twice .
the arbitration court is the last instance .

in a small new zealand town burt muro is considered a loving cheek because he has decided to go on a motorcycle , built in 1920 , to participate in a race in america .
burt is not convinced of his dream despite a heart failure .
with its saved , pairs of donations and a mortgage on its old workshop scales , it is transferring by ship to los angeles .
after the film there is coffee , tea and cakes .
the first of these is the &quot; new &quot; , the &quot; new &quot; , &quot; new york city &quot; , which is the capital of the united states .
rhenus midgard has also invested heavily on land .
they distribute the coal coming from the ships to the halves .
the company has already built several iron in the fire at the site .
in addition to coal imports , rhenus midgard also relies on wind farm logistics .
black shimmers the coal on the storage area in front of the dam .
two huge blue collar and rechargeable devices distribute or load the coal here to the customer as required .
every time transshipment equipment is moved , a shiny warning sounds over the terrain .
&quot; the signals serve for safety and are legally prescribed , &quot; says matthias schrell , ceo of rhenus midgard in wilhelmshaven .
in the event of unfavourable winds , this is unfortunately widely heard - and so there have already been some complaints from people from the north of the city .
he takes the complaints very seriously and has therefore contacted the people affected , says the 40 year-old .
in close consultation with the authorities , we are now in the process of softening the warning signals with technical measures .
he will continue to press for open dialogue with his neighbours .
matthias schrell has some things to do at the site .
the extension of the lower saxony bridge continues to be the focus of rhenus midgard &apos;s efforts to import coal for power plants and is one of the largest in europe in this sector .
thanks to the 18.5 meter deepening tank in front of the terminal , capesize bulk carriers can be processed here for a long time .
&quot; this year we want to win the 3 million ton mark in the envelope , &quot; schrell said .
in addition to the on-site eon power plant , the import coal is going to power plants in the inland country .
if the gdf-suez power station is to be put on the grid , there will be a good 5 million tonnes of coal imports per year .
the three ship loaders on the bridge and the second conveyor belt could create up to 10 million .

ben greenman : ten years new york comedy festival : the new york comedy festival : the new york city : the new york city .
one might say that new york city is the birthplace of stand-up comedy in america : just under a hundred years ago , the varieteartist frank fay , who was known as conférencier in the american palace .
over the years , fays innovation has been developed , as was most recently the new york comedy festival .
created and directed by caroline hirsch , the founder of the stand-up institution carolines , celebrates the festival this year its 10th anniversary .
“ most of these headliners began with carolines and became more and more successful until they became known at some point in order to appear in a club , ” hirsch said .
we have designed this festival so that we can continue working with you .
at this year &apos;s event , wanda sykes , kathy griffin and bill maher will perform as well as stand up for heroes , an annual music and comedy festival .
the festival also marks the beginning of the world of comedy .
a number of comedians who will be participating in the festival this year are familiar with the more unconventional ways of broadcasting , for example on smaller television channels such as comedy central , fx and spike .
nick kroll was awarded a sitcom on cable television ( the ironic-slippery fantasy football series &quot; the league &quot; on fxx ) and has now developed its own sketch show .
jenny slate was present at “ saturday night live ” as well as at “ parks and recreation ” , although she was the most famous for her viral video series “ marcel the shell with shot ” .
both kroll and slate and other young comedians with characteristic voices ( the surreal pessimistic anthony jeselnik , the ironic , racial subject concentrated w caumat ) .
the festival ’ s biggest visitors ’ magnets include an interview : david steinberg talks with larry david .
steinberg began as a stand-up comedian , but has become a respected television and film director and an unofficial comedy film history artist .

the meeting will take place in the town hall in the heart of manhattan .
“ the city is definitely in the comedy dna of larry ’ s entire work , ” said steinberg .
he told me when he is here , then he sometimes goes through the street between two buildings and thinks : hey , when i lose all my money , then i may live here .

&quot; after years , an agreement has been reached with the international atomic energy agency to resolve the differences of recent years , &quot; foreign minister mohammed dschawad sarif wrote at his facebook page .

drama in uruguay : young kills gambling chamderades with machete and machete .
two children have died in uruguay of a 11-year-old .
the two 14 and 12 year-old boys had invited their victims to go on bird hunting with them .
with machetes and knives they staged the 11-year-old on tuesday and threw the corpse into a well , reported the story of &quot; el páís &quot; on thursday .
they would then have to play football in front of their homes in a working-class quarter .
the corpse was found in the village of cerro pelado , 15 kilometers north of the exclusive beach there punta del este , 15 kilometers north .
as an alibi , a five-year half-sister of the younger , who took them with them , should say that it was sexually attacked by the boy .
but when the girl was in front of the police , without mentioning an attack on her , the two boys gave the deliberate killing of the 11 year-old .
the older one , among other reasons , called rivalry in the football game .
he was temporarily transferred to a psychiatric youth institution .
pimps must be put in prison
the exploitative trafficking of human beings , pimpering , threat , insult and dangerous physical injury have resulted in the konstanz district court turning a 33-year-old man from st. george into three and a half years in prison .
the former german military soldier , who was the turkish president after two operations in afghanistan , set up a military barrage in a process agreement .
he has therefore , in five cases , met women through internet or telephone contacts , which he has been able to put to the bottom of the matter after a few weeks against their will .
he used to resist by using force and threats to break .
women &apos;s income , which has been partly generated for them for years , has been kept .
by confiscating mobile phones and sim cards , he was able to foster contacts between women and the outside world .
together with a colleague who told women , he brought them to various brothels in the southwest .
there he had some monitoring to control their revenue .
in court , the defendant initially claimed that he was suffering from a severe trauma , after colleagues in afghanistan died alongside him in an explosion .
after a psychiatric expert had expressed great doubts about mental restraint , and thus about a limited guilt , the 33-year-old set a comprehensive confession .
the court had no longer had to hear any of the women who were injured .
as a kripo official reported , after an initial display by telephone monitoring measures at least four more cases of exploitative trafficking in human beings could be identified .
the interrogated talks were marked by high aggression .
in later interrogation , the injured party would have confirmed their martyrdom .
another witness , where one of the women is blue spots on the whole body , has not yet made any statement .
it is &apos; a completely broken personality &apos; , which perpetuates violence and exploitation in this profession as normal .
the defendant regretted his behaviour yesterday .
&quot; he has dissolved from these circles and wants to live a normal life after being imprisoned , &quot; he said .
oil prices continue to rise to usd 96 per barrel .
the price of oil continued to fall on friday , after concerns over a high supply overshadowed a report that the energy-hungry manufacturing sector in china is growing .
the reference crude oil variety for deliveries in december was in electronic commerce in europe at the new york mercantile exchange in the late morning of december , at 14 cents to 96.24 usd per barrel .
the contract fell by 39 cents on thursday , which means a 5.8 percent drop in the price in october .
the large range of crude oil has put a strain on prices in recent weeks .
the us department of energy declared on wednesday that the us offer had increased by 4.1 million barrels last week .
over the course of five weeks , the offer had risen by 25 million barrels .
but on friday there were indications of increased demand by two reports of an increase in chinese manufacturing activity .
this suggests a continued recovery of china ’ s economy , with growth reaching 7.8 % in the third quarter , after the economic slowdown in the previous quarter .
crude oil from the brent variety , a reference value for international crude oil , which is also used by us refineries , fell to the ice extinguishing plant in london by 26 cents .
court blocks decision on stop-and-frisk directive of the nypd .
a federal appeal court in the united states blocked the appointment of a judge on thursday that would bring about changes to the stop and frisk programme ( “ stop and search ” ) of the new york police department .
the 2nd us court of appeal declared that judge shira schütdlin ’ s decisions would be suspended until a court of appeal had been decided .
the judge had judged in august that the city was in breach of the constitution by the way in which the programme for stopping and questioning people was implemented .
the city appealed against its assessment and the ordered remedies , including the decision to create a monitoring centre to monitor the police in the change of their directive and the corresponding training programme .
the court of appeal heard the arguments on tuesday about the required suspension .
the appeal report stated that the judge must be freed from the case , since it does not respect the code of conduct for us judges by determining that a judge may appear to be partisan ; this is something that should be avoided in part of the case .
the judge had judged that police officers were violating the civil rights of tens of thousands of people because they were inadequately targeted in black and latin american men with the stop-attack .
she appointed an external monitoring unit to monitor the implementation of significant changes , including reforms to directives , training and service supervision , and appointed a pilot programme with body carrying equipment .
in august , the city of new york agreed to end the practice of storing names and addresses of people who were searching for police control .
an oral negotiation to call the city is scheduled for 14 march 2014 .
the stop and frisk tactics have been developed by a number of civil rights defenders .
such controls have been in various forms for decades , but the number of checks recorded during the term of the partisan mayor michael bloomberg has risen to an all-time high of 684.330 in 2011 , most of which is latin america .
in 2004 , four men , including all minorities , brought a complaint , which turned out to be a collective action .
supporters of stop and frisk changes to the nypd say that changes will lead to unfair practices and create a trustworthy and effective policy .
opponents believe that the changes will dampen the morality of the police , but not criminality ; money would also be wasted and the broader problem of a police force that has been left behind after the loss of thousands of jobs in the last decade .
the judge pointed out that she had not yet signed the stop and frisk practice , which was constitutionally based , but only the nature of the implementation of checks by the nypd .
the luck of the dreaming camels
happiness is an oasis that can only reach dreaming camels succeed .
with this prayer wisdom , the first chairman , wolfgang henne , described the history and fascination of the association &quot; helping hands &quot; .
on saturday afternoon , the tenth birthday of the association was celebrated , which has already had considerable success .
the first chairman , henne , reported in detail about the work of the association .
he was the first to visit mauritania in the cheijk zajed hospital in nouakchott in 2004 .
as a result , further cooperation has developed , and gynaecologist henne has performed numerous operations on the spot on several trips .
during the speeches , pictures of the missions on a large screen were shown , so that the guests of the anniversary event can distinguish themselves from the actions mentioned .
the association &apos;s desert vehicle was also shown .
it is a former federal border protection vehicle .
rainer prewo , the former ob of nagold , had made the proposal to equip this vehicle with a photovoltaic system and now plans to participate in the association in an advisory capacity , according to hanne .
in 2008 , zimmeri schleeh from baiersbronn won the first medical treatment in socogim , a miserable district on the edge of the capital , honorary honorary .
henne also mentioned a new parent child hospital in nouakchott , where he was working on the project .
especially interesting in times when nagold was born in nagoland .
you learn a lot in africa as a medical doctor , hanne said , for example , detoxification against burn-out .
the country ’ s political unrest has not allowed us to make as many journeys as planned , but many doctors have come to germany to hospitate in various areas .
in addition , containers are regularly sent to africa with material , so in march this year medical devices , medicines , bandages , hospital beds and glasses .
joint venture with the german federal ministry of economics and technology ( bmwi ) .
as his personal motivation , he called his work in auditing as a young member of parliament .
when he realized how much money was lost on the road , he decided to help the africans control a budget by the people .
fuchtel also stressed that global economy also requires global love of human beings .
nor should it be forgotten that africa is closer than some think .
from gran canaria , it is not far from africa .
coulson used telephone hacking to check a tip .
the previous news of the word editor andy coulson claimed to have put “ telephone-hacking , surveillance , and confrontation ” in an attempt to get a wrong tip about an affair of the then interior minister , charles .
prosecutor andrew edis qc declared to the court in the old bailey , news of the world had a false rumor in may 2005 that clarke had a relationship with his “ attractive special adviser ” .
the newspaper commissioned glenn mulcaire to investigate pawlbys voicemails .
“ the prosecutor ’ s office believes that coulson , who is now the publisher of the notw , is no man standing in front of the home of people and hopes to catch them on fresh deed , but rather a story of people .
he said that notw uses three methods to investigate stories investigatively : telephone hazards , surveillance , and confrontation .
the publisher is personally involved in the third method .
he obviously knows of the second , the monitoring , otherwise it cannot be .
what about the first ?
does he know about telephone hacking ?
he is denying that , but we say , ‘ and whether he knew of it ’ .
rumors of a clarkes affair were first heard by the feature editorial at notw when a source that was sexually linked to pawlby was said .
a band with voicemails from your phone from at least three occasions was recorded in august 2006 in mulcaires apartment .
the investigators also found entries on the computer of the detective , on the pavlby and their sister as “ projects ” .
in the time when the search was going , the grandparents of pawlby received anonymous calls to make them look for information about them .
meanwhile , former chief reporter neville thurlberk and the former chief executive officer neville thurlbeck overseen surveillance of movements of pawlby .
on 18 june 2005 , coulson left her a voicemail with the following content : “ i have a story that we want to release tomorrow , about which i would like to talk to charles . ”
edis explained that coulson &apos;s activities in this story followed the same pattern as other important personalities , such as former interior minister david blunkett .
the juries heard on thursday that coulson blunkett was arrested for an affair with a married woman when he himself was facing the co-accused .
coulson and brooks argue to confront others , between the 3rd october 2000 and the 9th august 2006 .
mulcaire , thurlbeck and weatherup have the telephone hacking admitted .
in protest against the planned wealth tax , french football will indeed be the first strike since 1972 .
a conciliation meeting will end without results .
in the conflict over the wealth tax , the government and professional football in france have been looking for a failed arbitration meeting in a saddle .
president françois hollande received a speech at the élysée palace in paris on thursday , which was attended by representatives of the association and listened to their complaints .
he refused to play the football from the planned 75-percent increase in the number of players in the tournament .
the other side , too , was tough .
the strike announced at the end of november will now be carried through , the chief association of professional clubs ( ucpf ) , jean-pierre louvel , announced .
the agreement reached between 29 november and 2 december in the ligue 1 and ligue 2 is therefore expired .
gearing : no absolute protection possible
&quot; we want to involve the inhabitants early in the planning , &quot; opened mayor jens häußler the civic information event on flood protection in gechingen .
around 80 participants had come to the municipal hall to explain the planned measures , ask questions , raise concerns and present ideas .
he made it clear : &quot; the final decisions are made by the members of the municipal council &quot; .
the floods that hit the country on 15 may 2009 were an unprepared disaster .
a river basin survey was conducted with the neighbouring municipality of aidlingen , which now forms the basis for the flood protection concept in gechingen .
&quot; the protection of as many cultivated plots as possible is the goal , &quot; says haggler .
the planning of protection against a weather service according to german statistics is based on a statistical analysis of the expected floods every 100 years .
climate change is being tackled by a 15 % surcharge .
in the field of research this is described as &quot; hq 100aklima &quot; .
the water masses that caused considerable damage in 2009in gechingen were equivalent to a 1000-year-old flood .
&quot; there is no absolute protection , but a relative improvement we can achieve , &quot; says hugely .
to protect hq 100aklima , you must have around four million euros invested in echingen , with the municipality receiving state subsidies of around 70 percent .
but haunted pointed out that it was only possible to promote it if an overall concept was implemented .
the community should be dependent on the participation of the citizens .
a complex planning and approval procedure must be completed .
in the best case , implementation could begin in 2016 .
among other things , the concept of protection , which was presented in the council of municipalities last week ( we reported ) provides for local measures in the flow of the river irm from the local valley .
following the presentation of the flood protection concept , participants took the opportunity to contribute their concerns .
one of the questions raised was why more dams and reservoirs were not planned to protect the site .
gregor kühn , the technical planner of the commissioned engineering firm wald and corbe from hügelsheim , who presented the concept , stressed that it needed the interaction of all presented measures to achieve the desired goal .
in addition , it is necessary to find the most economical solution , according to joachim wald von wald and corbe .
there was dissatisfaction among altore &apos;s residents , who were still in the cold during normal rain .
the problem is well known to the administration and initial measures have already been taken .
but haunted pointed out that the channel system guidelines are different from those for flood protection , not forgetting that .
the municipality is obliged to interpret the channel network in such a way that two to three years of regeneration could be conquered .
the sewage channels to scale up would devour millions .
after collision
on friday afternoon , 44 people are on the state road 44 near revensdorf , near two drivers were seriously injured in a frontal collision .
the police immediately closed the road completely , but could not do much to the accident .
however , there are various testimonies that should be evaluated first .
it is clear that the 19-year-old driver of a vw golf has gone in the direction of revensdorf and that the 38-year-old gettorf man has come to her with his hyundai .
both vehicles clashed , with the woman so badly trapped that the fire brigade took almost half an hour to get them out of the wreck .
the actual cause of the accident was initially unclear .
both of the unhappy came to nearby hospitals .
the track remained closed for about two hours .
it could be called the dostoyevsky of the united states .
philip k. dick was a god-search , a metaphysicist , his novels and stories have also something serial .
the relationship in the outer world is astonishing : the eyes , beard , high forehead .
and as fjodor m. dostoevski with his massive oeuvre as founder and apologist of the russian soul is to be understood , philip k. dick is read as an american prophet .
some titles have been published by heyne verlag , the haffmans cassette with the 118 stories distributed by two thousand .
thick explains america - the realm of breathtaking technical progress , coupled with paranoia , security mania , and the belief that it is chosen .
thick had experience of god , his late books read like a mixture of the revelation of john and a computer manual .
perhaps he was crazy , had put drugs on his brain .
he has captured , early on , that the computers are divinities .
he wrote a computer theology and asked what a human being can do from a machine that the creator had from his creature .
this is the &quot; blade runner &quot; problem .
killing .
a master of science fiction .
a fantastic writer .
his stories have been directed by film directors such as ridley scott , paul verhoeven and steven spielberg .
this story is now particularly significant .
the &quot; minority report &quot; dates from 1956 , it exudes the smell of cold war and the mccarthy report .
the principle of &apos; pre-crime &apos; is being developed here , &apos; pre-crime &apos; , that is , what has become more or less official doctrine of the white house .
in dick ’ s world , which resembles our terrifying , mutants look to the future – and the police are intervening .
&quot; we collect individuals who do not violate any law , &quot; says the chief of the authority .
&quot; we are snapping us even before they can commit a violent crime .
and : &quot; in our society there are no serious criminals , for which we have a criminal court full of pesudo criminals &quot; .
they assume that bad things are happening and prevent the criminal idea from being put into practice .
dick ’ s narrative works like the blueprint for anti-terrorist laws and the nsa ’ s eavesdropping of the nsa .
anticipation of the attack : that is how obama ’ s drone philosophy and practice works .
but dick &apos;s story is not over yet .
the chief of the police complains that there is no longer any separation of powers , the military controls everyday life - and what remains of the state .
then the supervisor will be monitored and a future crime will be carried out .
the system is turning through .
it is perfect , but it lies .
it is creating its own preconditions .
does errors and victims not only purchase , but also build on it .
the system creates the danger it is fighting .
philip k. dick read is to keep coming closer to the truth .
merkel ’ s late hatch for russia
the former us intelligence expert edward snowden could be in the us late hatch for federal chancellor angela merkel , also in his russian asylum .
representatives of the german federal bar association could either ask questions in writing or give the 30 year-old a personal meeting in russia , the agency interfax reported .
previously , the green federal deputy hans-christian ströbele was the first german politician to introduce snowden in moscow yesterday to discuss with him the affair .
nsa revelations reinforce paranoia of the company due to state surveillance .
on a mild day at the end of august , a german police helicopter flew deep across the us consulate in frankfurt am main , the financial capital of germany .
on the orders of the federal office for constitutional protection and counter-terrorism ( bvt ) , the german internal security service , he should be the photographer of the roof of the us post office , which is less than 5 km from the european central bank .
according to german media , the bvt wanted to check the presence of surveillance antennas and the action led to a change of words between the us and the german foreign ministry in berlin .
james clapper , american director of national intelligence , was again insisting in september that the us should not allow the possibility of overseas espionage “ to protect the business secrets of foreign companies on behalf of us companies .
but since edward snowden , who was turned into whistleblowers , with the release of his corn to us surveillance secrets , the us has become increasingly aware of the need for european governments and corporate heads .
reports that the us national security agency has not yet informed the brazilian oil company petroba and is collecting data from american cloud suppliers , including google and yahoo , have not yet fully covered the company divisions .
the overflow has brought the revelation that chancellor angela merkel ’ s telephone was intertwined , possibly for ten years .
if the most powerful person in europe can be targeted , then it is certain that company management will also be potential targets .
snowden has continued the intensive cooperation between us intelligence services and companies .
i think it is conceivable that this data will be used for mutual benefit .
“ germany must wake up , ” explains oliver green , president of bitmi , the small and medium-sized it companies in germany .
german companies believe that the us now poses almost as great a risk as china in terms of industrial espionage and data theft , such a survey that was conducted by the berater company ey in july .
in the areas leaked by snowden , however , there has been no evidence that the us has not yet fully disclosed the business secrets of foreign companies to its own companies .
politicians have expressed concern that the eu has not been given certain it and internet opportunities and that they have reduced their dependence on the us .
businesses are sceptical about this .
in the bundestag it was suggested that we should build a german google .
i can only close my eyes and slowly open them again ...
“ that ’ s not how it works , ” says hasso plattner , chairman of the german software manufacturer sap .
if we want a strong european it industry , we would not have had to let it die out 20 years ago .
all of this is subsidised in germany , from coal to cars to agriculture .
everything except for the it industry .
however , reach and technical refinement have enabled the snowden revelations to reach the us spy authorities .
cloud computing is a major change , because european business leaders are now more aware that in the us stored data of their legal systems are subject to their jurisdiction and therefore potentially vulnerable .
according to a survey carried out by the cloud security alliance , a commercial institution , the number of people in the world was high , following the revelations about us data mining activities with prism .
jim snabe , deputy managing director of sap , says : “ we see a new question from customers who had it a year ago – they are : where will my data be stored and can they guarantee that they will be protected .
many german corporate leaders believe that the latest reports simply confirm what they have already known .
the fact that economic espionage is taking place is no surprise .
that has always been the case .
“ it was a topic for many years and has not changed fundamentally through the current discussion , ” says kurt bock , chairman of the chemical company basf .
the americans are spying on us at both commercial and industrial level , just as we are doing , because it is in the national interest to defend our companies .
the management normally does not boast about the countermeasures that have been taken , because that gives an attacker benefits .
in large companies , employees have long been aware that taking a free usb stick on a trade fair or unattended computer is a major problem .
ulrich hackenberk , member of the board of directors of automanufacturer audi , says that it has been a standard practice for years to collect the mobile phones before a board meeting so that they are not used as interceptors .
the german bvt advises leaders to use simple prepaid phones when they are on trips abroad , because smart phones are not possible to compromise .
the prepaid phones are thrown away afterwards .
there is concern , however , that small and medium-sized enterprises are vulnerable to hacking and monitoring .
in germany , many of these companies are global market leaders in their respective niche .
“ small and medium-sized enterprises often lack the experience , the staff and the financial resources to effectively protect trade secrets against unauthorised access , ” the bvt warns in a report .
the us warns its own firms about economic espionage by other countries .
according to washington , the us national intelligence estimate in february brought france , russia , and israel into second place behind china , two of the countries that have committed themselves to obtaining hackings ’ economic data .
a member of the board of directors of a german blue-chip company agreed to take a lead in the area of industrial espionage , then “ the french are the worst ” .
bernard squarcini , former head of the french internal security service dcrl , was interviewed this month with the following words : “ the intelligence services know very well that all countries , even if they are in the war .

the teenager &apos;s parents , whose body is found in a rolled rolled ringermatte in the gym of his high school , are convinced that their son was murdered , the lawyer explained the family on thursday .
kendrick johnson of valdosta in the us state of georgia was arrested on 11 january in a mate. this matte was placed behind the gallery in the school gym .
sheriff &apos;s investigators at lowndes county came to the conclusion that johnson was a member of the un security council in a tragic accident , which the family of 17 years doubted .
“ they are convinced that their son was murdered , ” benjamin crump , the lawyer of kenneth and jacquelyn johnson , declared himself to be murdered by foxnews.com.
they would never have believed that he had died as the sheriff had swallowed .
“ they believe that it is unthinkable to violate the laws of physics as well as common sense .
instead , they are convinced that the truth is being concealed to protect the person or person responsible for the death of their son .
&quot; her son went to school to learn and returned to the corpse , &quot; he commented .
us prosecutor michael moore said on thursday that there will be a formal investigation into the death of johnson , as a number of important questions remain unresolved .
what was the cause of death ?
is his death due to a crime ?
moore explained this at a press conference on thursday afternoon .
i follow the facts , whichever direction you are heading in .
my goal is to find out the truth .
“ i believe that a sufficient basis for a formal investigation of the data is available , ” he said .
moore explained to reporters who interpret initial autopsy that johnson was unaware of the consequences of a “ position-related stiflation . ”
a second autopsy , however , caused another death , so moore .
“ there are a number of questions that need to be answered or confirmed , ” he said .
moore added , if there is sufficient evidence for criminal or civil law investigation of the death of johnson , that would be the fatal test of the fbi in carrying out the investigation .
a representative of county sheriff &apos;s authority was present at our request on thursday , not ready to comment .
a court in southern georgia ordered the trial of the authorities to cease all surveillance videos on wednesday .
the teenager ’ s parents said that they hoped that the video recordings contained evidence of how he died .
cdc publish allergy guidelines for schools and schools .
on wednesday , the centers for disease control published a report on the prevention of cancer in the united states .
these are the first such directives that the us government issued , as the number of school children with food allergies is increasing .
one in 20 children in the united states now have food allergy .
the spread of food allergies among children has , according to the cdc , increased by 18 % between 1997 and 2007 .
the guidelines contain information for schools that is sensitive to food allergies by the teachers and staff and how children are treated .
it is also recommended that schools supply epinephrin – the auto injection of epipen is most common .
the legislators in the states have recently amended the rules so that schools can easily supply epinephrin .
the report also lists typical symptoms caused by children who are suffering from allergic reactions .
children may say , “ it feels like something is on my tongue , ” “ my tongue feels like it is on my face , as if a hair is on it , ” or “ my tongue is ribbelt . ”
parents of intersexual children can choose “ sex varies ” .
germany is the first european nation to have a third sex recognised for children who are not accompanied by unequivocal genitalia .
newborn babies are no longer made rigidly male or female .
under the new law , parents no longer have to declare sex for such children , but can be “ undetermined ” or “ not determined ” on the birth certificate .
the aim of the law is to take the pressure from parents so that they do not take hasty decisions on operations for the assignment of sexes to newborn children , and to combat discrimination against intersexual people .
according to the bbc , an intersexual person said years later : “ i am neither a man nor a woman . ”
i remain the patchwork created by doctors , mutilated and full of scars .
it is estimated that one in 2,000 children die every year neither as a boy nor as a girl .
they are among the intersexuals , a group that is under the diagnosis of ‘ sexual differentiation disorder ’ ( dsd ) , a collective term for people with atypical chromosomes , germs and other diseases .
wallis simpson may have been intersexual .
understanding gender identification is still not very well developed , but most experts in the us suggest that they should not use the best available information on gender .
the new york psychiatrist dr. jack drescher , who focuses on the problem of gender identification , said that the new german law “ blessing for a good cause ” .
intersexual children are an ethical dilemma .
“ some people have life-threatening diseases that can lead to surgical intervention , but for most children this is not true , ” he said .
you can do sexual assignment without surgery and then wait for identity to develop .
the scientific data on how a child develops its gender identity at all is not very accurate .
no one knows why it is happening .
it is like the secret why people are homosexual .
in a report to the european commission in 2011 , it is stated that intersexual people are excluded from transsexual or transgender persons , because their status is not gender .
these features were shown in secondary sexual characteristics such as muscle mass , hair loss , frying and stature , mainly in sexual and psychological aspects such as reproductive and physical activity .
the report also provides an overview of discrimination , which affects intersexual and transgender people in professional life , and the extent of harassment , violence and prejudice crises .
not in line with the gender picture , now have a special camp .
in the meantime , it is possible for adults in australia and nepal to access official documents male , female or “ third sex . ”
in june , australian norrie may-welby ( 52 ) was chosen as the world ’ s first “ gender-free ” person after a court ruled that a “ undetermined ” gender status had been maintained for life .
german cards will have a third assignment , x for intersexuality , alongside m and w , so the ministry of the interior will .
in neighbouring france , gender issues are still controversial , so a news post has shown that the french are 24 .
in 2011 , dozens of french meps from the strictly catholic country signed a petition that “ gender theory ” would be removed from school books .
the u.s. website catholic online also has an objection to german law , with the justification : “ if the world had been dragged into a new state where sex is a decision to be sexual activity but not sexual activity , then we do not .
the mother of a newborn from maryland explained to baby zone , they would be better off if babies were a sex at birth .
“ being parents is also possible without further restrictions .
children need stability and security .
historically , children who have worked with both male and female sexes have been given the opportunity to study hermaphrodite , after the attractive greek god who both sexes had .
ten years ago , medicine regarded sex as something that could be wiped out and then rebuilt .
but now the ethical foundations of an operation are being questioned , now that we know how complex the gender identity is and that doctors are able to lie wrong because they do not know how the child is growing up with the child .
“ in the middle of the twentieth century , one was called a “ psychiatric emergency , ” said drescher .
if such a child was born , then no one called the psychiatrist , but the surgeon .
the prevailing theory on the treatment of children with unclear genital organs is based on dr. john money from johns hopkins university , who believed that gender was a formal factor .
he coined the term “ gender identity , ” arguing that social and environmental incentives – as the parents have a child – are interagonised with genes and hormones of a child and shaped them as such .
but , in a report known as john / joan , published in 1966 , his theories were controversial .
he advised the parents of a boy whose penis was killed by a pleated circumcision , to leave the child completely .
“ money presented this case as a successful example of a transformation , but it was not , ” says drescher .
when the boy was about 15 , he moved back to the male sex and married a woman .
he was a member of the royal family of the royal family of the united states .
according to drescher , there are still doctors who would practice this model .
but , in the 1990 ’ s , with the internet ’ s entry , survivors of these gender operations came to the public , “ not happy with the outcome . ”
for example , at jim bruce , a 36-year-old author from montana who worked with xy-male chromosomes but who was ambiguous genitalia .
doctors were unaware of whether he had a great clitoris or a small penis and were convinced that he could never achieve a “ satisfactory life ” as a man .
so its external body and the teeth were quickly removed shortly after birth in 1976 , and he was taken up as a girl .
at the age of 12 he was given female hormones .
“ i knew i am not a girl , ” he explained to abcnews.com that i am not a girl .
i was unhappy , but it was really difficult to ask questions .
at the age of 18 he should receive a vaginal plastic .
but , as he was and knew that something was not right , he demanded that his medical acts. he was not a man of the same name .
what he found was shocking .
i was sterilised at birth – and no one ever told me .
bruce was born with a dsd , through which his body did not have enough testosterone to develop genitalia .
after hearing the truth , he moved to the male identity again , received testosteron injections and let his breasts be removed .
the surgery has made it infertile .
today , he is fighting for others in an organization called interface project to ensure that intersexual people are perceived as normal .
but anne tamar-mattis , managing director of the california based legal group advocates for informed-choice , is concerned that the law of germany “ is not a stamp and stitching . ”
“ many activists are worried that the german decision could encourage parents to make quick decisions and give the child a “ undetermined ” , she explained .
we fear that this will favour intervention .
we think it would be better to take into account the male or female sex and then wait .
but we do not yet know what the law will do , so we can only speculate .
tamar-mattis said that her organisation supports the australian law , because “ it allows adults to be recognised as a third sex ” .
“ adults should be able to make their own decisions on their legal sex , ” she explained .
german law is about the allocation of birth .
this is not a fight at which small children should be forced to do so at this stage .
when they are grown up , they can decide for themselves on their bodies .
but dr arlene baratz , a brustradiologist from pittsburg who was a daughter with a sexual differentiation disorder and hundreds of others in a self-help group , says german law .
katie , the daughter of baratz , was born with male chromosomes , but has a dsd called complete androgenic resistance .
the hotel is located in the heart of the city , close to the city centre and the main train station .
she has a vagina , but no uterus and no ovaries .
today katie is 29 and married ; she is a student at the university of pennsylvania .
it is infertile , but hopes to achieve a positive result by adopting or surrogacy .
“ the law gives parents space , so they do not have to make hasty decisions , ” baratz said .
it gives you the time to do different tests and to clarify things , giving you time before you become “ male ” or “ female ” .
in this way everything is fine – you are pulling the child big and you love it .
you have a wonderful baby and enjoy your parental happiness .
and you do not have to rush into an operation that can no longer be reversed .
“ this includes the children in the decision and eliminates the fear of mocking parents because they feel that they are not the right thing . ” explains the “ i am not going to do it . ”
ultimately , the child decides on the gender that suits him better – and that is wonderful .
this will enable children to make the decision themselves .
unknown girls injure women by shot from cars
unknown people have a 12-year-old in saxony-anhalt when shooting from a car .
the perpetrators had probably been in genthin with an air force on a group of children on thursday evening .
this was the message the police sent to the police in burg .
the girl was slightly wounded at the left wade .
rescue forces brought the girl to hospital .
the shot came from a small car that was on a group of six children and suddenly stopped .
witnesses saw two people sitting in the car .
the perpetrators also shot at a bus stop .
a disc broke .
they then came from it .
the criminal police investigated , it was said on friday .
up to now , the police inspection kempten can look forward to a quiet halloween night .
the officials were only given two egg children who were thrown to the house .
since the homeowners recognized this in good time and the egg deposits were removed immediately , no material damage should have arisen .
the city also has some new sylvesterböller , but also here there is no material damage .
a local residents in the bischof friendorfer way reported that his car was wrapped in paper and his wheel ornamental apertures were stolen .
until the police arrived , the man did not wear his wheel ornaments in the immediate vicinity , so the police could not continue to work .
living with a future
waltraud ries actually lives dreamlike .
your house is located in a quiet residential area of stuttgart with plenty of green , an old tree population , nice neighbors and not too much traffic .
the city is only a few minutes away by public transport .
&quot; hopefully you are not afraid of spiders ? &quot; , waltraud ries asks and points to a fat spider on the door frame .
i have been looking for a new apartment for my husband and myself for some time .
but you know how difficult this is in stuttgart .
the reason is not spider phobia , but the concern to use the many staircases to the house and the apartment at old age , explains it .
moreover , since a meniscus operation , the midfiftieth woman has had to learn her own hand what it means to deal with handicap from the floor .
recently , a book by her appeared on the theme of &apos; happily living in old age - what kind of housing is the best for me ? &apos; .
&apos;our apartment is the best example of what is not possible in old age &apos; , she begins to tell .
when you were in the maisonette apartment with your husband more than 20 years ago , it was just a beautiful apartment in the middle of the green .
today , in mid-fifty , waltraud ries thinks differently about this .
but she also knows that she is one of the few people who are actually concerned with the issue of &apos; living in old age &apos; .
most people are exporting it as long as it is possible .
only the others are old , &apos; she says smile .
only when the suffering is really great can one think .
&apos;then it may be too late , &apos; says ries .
in her book , the interior architect presents 17 models of living for self-determined living in old age .
&apos;what type of housing you choose is always an individual choice &apos; , she explains .
d i e solution do not exist for the age .
even if you are looking for a retirement home in tuscany or brittany , you should always consider that you will also be ill .
and &apos; without good knowledge of the national language , you can also agree in the dolce vita , &apos; gives the author of the book to consider resettlement .
among their models are classic models of care , alternative forms of housing or the often cited pensioners &apos; covenant .
at age , everyone has their own ticks and fancy , and this is how everyone has their own ticks and fancy things to do .
&quot; for me , such a community would be nothing , &quot; she says with an eye catcher .
even not like a student world cup with a shared bathroom and kitchen .
&quot; in old times , you just need your retreat rooms , &quot; says ries .
that a senior housing community can still function , the author wants to remain indifferent .
this should then be done differently from the classic student coin .
and sometimes you just want your peace , &apos; she believes .
it is at least not alone in the capital of the country .
&apos;most of the old people in stuttgart want to stay in their own home as long as possible &apos; , is also the experience of teresa rütten , the head of civil service living in the age of the state capital .
your department advises people on the subject of &apos; getting older &apos; .
that is why it is often the elderly who would accept inconvenience and restrictions just to be able to stay in their usual environment , that is also the experience of the foundation .
there are many ways to get to the house or apartment without any barriers .
ries recommends that all those who are concerned with the rebuilding of their homes or homes according to age , first read carefully and not find the best craftsman .
today , there are also specialists for the rebuilding of old buildings .
even in the apartment , let some of them realize , and if it is only the toilet seat increase , the interior architect will clarify .
but the existing apartment cannot always be adapted to the age and therefore without barriers , even if it is still so beautiful .
waltraud ries had to do this experience .
the room was very small and the bed was very comfortable .
it will continue until you find the ideal object for yourself and your husband .
before moving , she is more gray than she was before the spider at her apartment door .
the us wants to continue prosecuting snowden
the us has changed its stance on former us intelligence officer edward snowden .
he is still accused of disclosing unauthorised secret information .
he must therefore engage in criminal proceedings in the united states , said the us state department spokeswoman jennifer psaki in washington .
the recent statements by snowden would not change this either .
previously , german green politician hans-christian ströbele had a meeting with snowden in moscow with the us to call on him not to punish him any further .
psaki stressed that stranglehold was one of parliamentarians &apos; misgivings , not that of a german member of the government .
edward snowden is basically a conversation with german authorities .
first , however , he wants to know his situation .
this is what the former nsa employee , sought by the us , made clear in an unaddressed letter that the green politician hans-christian ströbele sent to the us on friday after a meeting with snowden and sent to the federal government .
the letter was written after a translation widely used by ströbele :
to the competent authorities
i have been asked to write to you about your inquiry into mass surveillance .
my name is edward joseph snowden and i was previously contracted or directly employed as a technical expert at the national security agency .
as i work in these institutions , i have seen systematic violations of the law by my government , which have led me to act out of a moral duty .
as a result of the publication of these concerns , i have been subjected to a serious and persistent hate that forced me to leave my family and my homeland .
i live in exile and enjoy temporary asylum .
i am encouraged by the response to my political action , both in the us and elsewhere .
citizens around the world , and also senior officials - including the united states - have been making revelations about a system of all-encompassing surveillance that nobody can account for as a service to the public .
this spying revelations attracted many proposals for new laws and directives that were based on the previously concealed abuse of public confidence .
the benefits to society from these findings are becoming increasingly clear , while the risks involved have been clearly concealed .
although the result of my efforts has been demonstrably positive , my government continues to treat dissens as a staunch and seeks to criminalise political expression and to prosecute it .
yet to speak the truth is not a crime .
i am confident that the united states government , with the support of the international community , will put an end to this harmful attitude .
i hope that , if i have resolved the difficulties of this humanitarian situation , i will be able to participate in the responsible investigation of the facts concerning the problems of the media , particularly in relation to truth and authenticity .
i look forward to a discussion with you in your country as soon as the situation is resolved and thank you for your efforts to respect international law , which protects us all .
edward snowden testifies to the fact that hans-christian ströbele is a member of the hans-christian ströbele group .
kindergarten has found a private buyer .
&quot; the building is in good hands &quot; , says winterlingen &apos;s mayor michael maier .
the former kindergarten in the garden street has been sold to a private individual .
the local council approved the sale in its recent meeting in the non-public part .
the building changed its owner at a &quot; reasonable &quot; price .
&quot; the community is satisfied , &quot; says maier .
the budget was set at eur 100 000 .
it is not yet clear how the new owner intends to use the former kindergarten .
the mayor is right that winterlingen should take responsibility for the building before the winter to someone else and should not be held responsible for the entertainment of the house , such as heating , after the garden and watching .
&quot; this effort is now gone , &quot; maier is pleased .
concert at high summer temperatures
the musikverein hammereisenbach gives a concert on the terrace of the gasthaus hammer .
as conductor bianca willmann at 7.30 p.m. , he raised the clock stock , the thermometer still shows 25 degrees .
about 50 listeners enjoy the sounds of the hammric musicians .
president manuela honeck explains the music .
in this context , honeck thanked all those who helped to successfully build the first hock of musicians .
report : obama campaign considered biden by hillary clinton to replace biden with hillary clinton .
president barack obama ’ s closest advisers have kept secret , vice president joe biden , in 2012 , through hillary clinton , so the new york times .
the revelation is the most noteworthy surprise of the long-awaited work of mark halperin and john heilemann on the 2012 campaign , “ double down : game change ” 2012 .
the times is a copy of the upcoming book .
according to jonathan martin , the times ’ national political correspondent , the book thoroughly records the history of the efforts of leading campaign and white house staff , notably the former whitehouse chaired by the former white house chief of staff .
the potential change was a strictly guarded secret within the campaign infrastructure in chicago and in the oval office .
only half a dozen of the president ’ s closest advisers – including daley , obama ’ s former campaign leader , jim messina , and the former white house ’ s senior adviser , david axelrod , and david .
in “ double down ” it is claimed that daley was at the forefront of efforts to protect biden despite its “ close , personal relationship ” before it was eventually turned against such a move .
in an interview with martin daley confirmed that the government had indeed considered using bids by clinton .
“ i said a whole series of things that should be considered , and that was one of them , ” says daley to the magazine .
it is worth remembering that the president at the time had terrible poll figures , so we thought : “ for god ’ s sake , what are we doing ? ”
while daley described the investigations as “ due diligence , ” martin said to anderson cooper of cnn that during the campaign for re-election there was considerable effort to find out if a new one was in place .
“ in campaigns not so much money is spent on surveys and focus groups if you do not think seriously about something , ” said martin on ac360 .
but it is not clear whether obama knew that his team had an exchange .
martin said to cnn that he asked daley whether his boss at the time was aware of the potential change .
although daley said that he did not believe that the president was “ aware of the possible change , ” the former chief of staff admitted that it was “ possible ” that obama knew that he would .
martin added that “ double down ” is not a definitive answer to the question of whether the political explorations of obama ’ s desk have reached .
cooper asked martin if he seriously think obama did not know anything about the studies of whether to use bids in the elections .
&quot; possible &quot; , martin replied .
what happens on the way with my email ?
e-mail is actually called electronic letter .
was e-mail used in the design of the internet service as in the case of conventional mail technically the secret of letters ?
in the design of early internet services , the emphasis was on making communication possible .
that is why the basic technical protocols have not been careful to lay a firm foundation for a hearing-safe exchange of letters .
therefore , a conventional e-mail corresponds to an open postcard rather than a sealed letter .
if the user &quot; anna &quot; an &quot; benni sends a mail , the computers of the two are then connected directly ?
the email program or the browser of anna sends the mail to the mail server of your service provider in the first step .
for example , if you have a gmail account , google would be .
this mail server sends the content to the provider that uses benni .
on the track , the mail can be run over a number of other servers on the internet .
bennie can then call the content of his provider .
if conventional e-mails are read through the web ?
most mails are sent by software robots on the move .
the sender &apos;s provider usually checks whether the mail is a malicious program as an attachment .
the receiver systems also use a virus check .
furthermore , providers check whether it is a troublesome and unwanted spam mail that is deleted immediately or at least converted into a spam folder .
if the robots have yet another task ?
for systems like gmail , the robot also determines the information google needs to place context advertising .
when anna and benni talk about their upcoming holiday trip via gmail , google can provide links to holiday offers .
read the emails with unknown people too .
the likelihood that unauthorized persons will read an email is extremely small .
in theory , however , this is possible .
in companies , administrators often have the possibility to read electronic mail .
law enforcement agencies and intelligence agencies also have legal means of intercepting or noticing e-mails .
in addition , there are possible illegal dismissal actions .
is it possible to protect e-mails against reading ?
encryption according to the openpgp standard can encrypt an email against reading .
with a high technical effort it is also possible to disguise the metadata of an email communication , so that it is not even easy to recognize who communicated with whom .
how important are yahoo and google on the email market in germany ?
the most commonly used mailboxes are yahoo and google , according to a survey by convios consulting , which dates back to august 2013 , only play a minor role .
while yahoo-mail ’ s shares were last dropped , gmail could increase significantly from google .
mother in the forest hides and retires pension .
when his betazed mother died , a man from wolfsburg forged a plan .
he buried the dead in a forest - and continued to collect their pensions and care allowances .
to continue pension and care allowance , the commission has proposed a 67-year-old wolfsburg mother to be found dead after police investigations in the forest .
first , he covered up the death of the 89 year-old , then he spent the money for more than a year and a half .
now , the 67 year old must be responsible for fraud , as a speaker said on friday .
so the man hid the woman in a forest near helmstedt .
the man was suspected already in may : at that time , it was clear that the needy mother had no longer needed any medication .
the investigators told the pensioner that his mother had travelled to spain .
because the officials found this strange , they continued to investigate .
it emerged that the two have been working in a shared apartment for more than 15 years and he had recently maintained it .
the 67 year-old finally admitted the death of his mother .
according to the police , an obduction did not give any evidence of a capital crime .
want to see ice cream shining in the dark ?
a british entrepreneur has the first glowing ice in the dark – with the help of quals .
charlie francis made the fluorescent properties of marine organisms to use and created a new leaning space for the sea animals .
he got the idea after he had read a research on torment and persuaded chinese scientists to take the luminous protein artificially .
the ice cream reacts with the tongue when consuming , which reduces the ph value in the protein and triggers the light .
chris explains that the ice cream responds to the heat in the mouth and luminaire – the more you lick , the brighter it becomes .
charlie , founder of the ice cream company &quot; lick me i &apos;m delicious &quot; , says : &quot; the product is incredible , but still in a very early production phase , and so you get two grams for the first time .
the proton used in the ice cream reacts with the tongue in a neutral ph .
when the mouth warm the protein , the ph value increases and the ice shines .
we have tested it over the last few months and it seemed ideal to us to use it on halloween , because it is such wonderful luminaires effect .
it is probably the most expensive ice cream i have ever made , because the torch light is four times more expensive than gold .
every ball costs me about 140 pounds .
but for that it tastes delicious .
charlies experimental company based in bristol is famous for its unusual flavours , which include bier , cheese , cheese , beef and cheese .
but his latest creation is to become even more ambitious .
he says : “ i would like to develop an invisible ice cream . ”
this is impossible in itself because of the light break caused by the ice crystals , from which ice cream is made ; but i suspect we can find a way to do it .
the ice cream uses fluorescent properties of a torch that is artificially produced by chinese scientists .
the tsv morsum is still untouched after six days of play in the handball league .
it is now the case that ingo ehlers &apos; team will be coming to the derby against the tsv daverden , who celebrated his first victory last weekend .
this game starts the season new for us .
&quot; i hope that we finally have our head free , &quot; ehler &apos;s behavior gives himself optimistic .
he has finally done so , except for the long-time injured hendrik blohme , his complete cadre .
daverden is also committed to speed games .
we must therefore keep our error rate low .
but it is primarily a question of increasing coverage , which is , in the last analysis , far from a certain impression .
the city of daverden &apos;s coach thomas panitz is far more relaxed after the first season &apos;s victory against nordhorn .
the game was , of course , a house number .
but that &apos;s why we &apos;re still far from the favorite , because everything can happen in the derby .
however , panitz now wants to prove in morsum to launch a series .
missing is jan-malted jodat .
for this purpose , the a-youthful joost windsweetness , who has a double right to play at the a-youth league ligists hc bremen , celebrates his season debut .
if you are not hot in such a game , you should stay at home .
halloween 2013 : in figures
when i was small , halloween had something magical .
my sister and i were allowed to eat sweets , stay late and dresse us for the neighbourhood .
today i am more interested in halloween .
i have not been prepared to move from my apartment to sweets for the last two years and i am sure i will not do so this year either .
but , according to the statistics , i am a black sheep in terms of halloween .
the majority of americans – 158 million to be precise – celebrate halloween this year , spending a total of $ 6.9 billion on candy , costumes , and decorations , so the us president said .
one thing i can count on every halloween then is the trend values .
the costumes will be about 1.2 billion of the $ 6.9 billion spent , according to the nrf .
this year , exciting unanimated objects are the last cry .
women no longer need to wear sexy clothes , they can now enjoy seductive food such as pizza , hamburgers or carrots .
as far as men are concerned , i expect a lot of zombies thanks to the walking dead , and i bet that the daft-punk space men will put it in the instagram feeds this year .
according to google , the most sought after costumes are zombies , batman , pirates and witches .
i suspect that there is nothing wrong with tradition .
we have our dogs dressed up last year and so i am surprised that we were not alone .
indeed , americans spend $ 330 million this year on costumes of their pets , according to the nrf .
these are a lot of hot dogs .
as far as candy is concerned , we are not indulgent .
americans will spend $ 1.9 billion this year , the nielsen company says .
that is about 270 million kilograms of chocolate bars , lozers , candy and rubber barrels .
so good news for the us department of trade , 41 million people who are living with the sweets or saures saying .
indeed , we will be producing more than 40 million kilograms of chocolate for halloween and – let us not fool ourselves – eating .
the only thing we do not want to consume is the sweet candy corn ; yet 15 million kilograms of it are sold by halloween , according to the national association of confectionery manufacturers .
that is about nine billion grains of maize .
it is a mystery that i have not yet been able to resolve .
nothing belongs more to halloween than houses where it spits .
they have given great names such as “ terror behind the walls ” ( which is what is in a real prison , incidentally ) , “ howl-o-scream ” and “ the house of shock ” .
there are indeed 1,200 officially recognised spuk-houses in the united states , which generate $ 500 million in revenue , according to america haunts , and that includes the wonderful photos on which you are currently sitting in pants .
but let us finally get to the pumpkins .
charlie brown made us familiar with the big pumpkin when we were children , and cutting a pumpkin lantern is like decorating the christmas tree – something we have seen from a small age .
fortunately , the “ baby in pumpkin ” trend began only last year thanks to pinterest , so most of us grew up with the pumpkin straps and not , to sit in it .
this year , americans will spend about $ 106 million on pumpkin , the us census bureau says .
the pumpkin lanterns , slowly rotting in the front garden , probably originated from illinois , where this year was harvested 245 million kilograms of pumpkin .

the home brand in helbrecht : rescue forces are coated corpses of corpses .
the fire department had to be in helbrecht on late thursday evening .
a three-family house in the courtyard begins the night to friday fire .
the rescue forces are a decolonised body from the house .
rescue forces have lost their lives in a fire in helbrecht , a decolonised body in a three-family house .
whether it is a resident is still unclear how a police spokesman said in bayreuth .
on the late thursday evening , it had been burned on the ground floor of the house .
when the fire brigade arrived , the flames struck out of a window .
the staff went into the apartment and found the corpse in a room .
this and another room were burned out completely .
the entire ground floor was damaged .
all other residents were not at home during the fire , the police spokesman continued .
the building was not habitable for the time being .
the exact cause of the fire was not clear at first .
germany &apos;s largest church has launched an offensive to fight for the profession of pastor .
background is a possible shortage of priests : the evangelic-lutheran church of hanover expects that the number of people living in the region of 1,800 will increase .
for young people today , the profession is very attractive and offers good prospects , said pastor mathis burfien ( 43 ) in conversation with the evangelical press service .
it is attractive to keep track of the work and daily routine .
with burfia , the church of the state has built a pastor in a full place for the first time to inspire young people for the study of theology .
at present , fewer and fewer young people are choosing to study theology after the abitur .
burfia is leading this back to the process of deconstruction : &quot; god &apos;s voice is quiet , the world is loud &quot; .
the profession was characterised by great freedom and diversity .
i am the master of my calendar and can focus on where i think it is important .
pastors could be very close to the people as a pastor .
they earned as much as teachers and could live well on it .
certainly , in the free economy , more will be paid , but theologians would have a safe employer .
this is what is happening today , in the face of young people who are not only concerned with their careers , but also with a work that is full of meaning .
according to the local church , which has three quarters of lower saxony , some 60 pastors are currently retiring per year .
at the same time , about 40 graduates of a theological study begin their vikariat .
in sparsely populated peripheral areas such as the resin , the emsland or the wendland , it may be difficult to fill posts in the future .
burfien wants to organise study days for young people and also to invite celebrities to study theology .
the study of theology offers a broad education .
you can even become president of the federal republic .

fire brigade to save a bitch that is 15 meters above the ground on a dangerous rock head .
cockerspaniel bitch ruby was out of the air after a minor traffic accident .
three days later , a walker took her to her uncomfortable position in the quarry and discovered her in her uncomfortable position .
fire fighters rolled off on a rock wall and saved the dog from safe death .
the fire department managed to find a dog in safety that was on a 15-metre high lead in a rock wall .
the nine month old cockerspaniel bitch ruby was a member of the team after a road accident on sunday afternoon and survived three days alone before she left a quarry on wednesday .
scott alderson , 25 , and his girlfriend becky hall , 20 , who belongs to the dog , came to the quarry flappit in denholme , west yorkshire , to welcome ruby again .
they had desperately looked for their missing bitch and asked for help in social networks .
around 14 : 15 p.m. on wednesday , a walker who had left his dog saw the hunted beaten ruby on the 15-metre high paragraph in quarry .
the cleckheckheaton fire station ejection technical rescue team rushed to the place and rolled to rescue rubies , which were then buried in a dog box .
andy clayton , specialist of the technical rescue team , said : “ she was in a dangerous situation .
it was located in the middle of the rock wall – 15 meters from the top and the ground .
she did not move muscles during her rescue – she was as stiffly frozen .
but now it is doing well .
she then took a few dog cakes .
this was a rather unusual effort .
the fact that the dog was discovered is incredible .
peter lau , specialist in the technical rescue team , said : “ ruby had a huge accident . ”
there was a possibility that it was seriously injured or worse .
ruby was brought to the vet for investigation , but he was not dehydration or dehydration .
becky hall from halifax , west yorkshire said : “ to watch the rescue was frightening . ”
i could not believe that she was really up there .
it was wonderful to keep them back in the poor .
the veterinarian explained that if exhaustion became too large and it had collapsed , it would probably have fallen .
the firefighters have done a great job .
what they did was really courageous .
we are simply so grateful and each of them was absolutely incredible .
scott alderson from keighley added : “ we were afraid that it would fall down , but she stayed up . ”
the firemen were great .
i can hardly believe where it was .
mick jagger explains that he never made kary perry when she was 18 .
in an interview with an australian radio station this week , the pop star said that she was playing as a background singer at jaggers ’ song “ old habits the hard ” from 2004 .
perry explained that she had spent dinner with the altrocker , and that “ he drew me when i was 18 ” .
she added : “ it ’ s been a long time ago and he was very kind to me . ”
in a statement , a representative of jaggers , 70 , said on thursday that he was “ categorically denying that he had ever made attempts to bring things closer to katy perry . ”
the representative added : “ perhaps she confused him with someone else . ”
perry was one of the singers who played at the rolling stones tour this year .
her new album “ prism ” was released in the first place this week .
george kerevan : european unbundling gives scots the choice
a new day , a new story of terror for independence .
this time we are warned that an independent scotland is needed to join the schengen area as a condition for eu membership .
this is the key word for stories about passport controls in berwick and a stack-and-wire border along the hadrian wall .
in fact , the strathclyde proposal pointed out the possible economic benefits that could mean more freedom of travel in the rest of europe , but , as expected , this was in the headlines .
nor has anyone mentioned that eu member states often have to comply with their strict rules when they are more favourable to them .
since scotland is not currently a member of the schengen area , continued non-compliance with brussels would be only a small concession in exchange for what it really wants to get from the scots .
so , really not a story .
and one that has already come in the years that they already glide like a fossil : for the first time i have called the “ independence means passport controls ” -duck at least 40 years ago .
one interesting point is the constant repetition of this ancient story .
why should we expect an independent scotland to have a european pipe ?
why the london yoke against the brussels one , especially now ?
these are the real european news : the great post-war plan to unite europe has stalled .
the euro crisis officially killed the european project .
across the eu , parties are gaining ground that are anti-eu or that want to throw the euro out as a single currency .
even in germany , the eurosceptic party could create alternative for germany – only this year – just under five million votes in the september election .
there has always been domestic opposition to the plan to create a federal europe .
the current economic crisis , however , is turning out to be a turning point .
the political and economic sanctions imposed by berlin and the european central bank , in conjunction with the straitjacket into which the national economy is bound by the maintenance of the single currency , have forced many people to think that the project is far off .
the crisis in the euro has little to do with national governments running excessive budget deficits – only in greece .
instead , the eurosystem has tied its members to exchange rates , which are beneficial to german exporters – and that is what german politicians would like to leave .
without the possibility of devaluation of the local currency , southern europe will find itself with a built-in productivity disadvantage over germany .
the only way is to cut wages and public spending – spurred on by berlin .
behind the current fiscal and monetary problems lies a deeper european productivity deficit .
as a result of the “ green ” energy directives imposed by brussels – a code for the subsidisation of french and german energy companies at the expense of consumers – european industry pays a price compared to the united states .
this is a crippling cost disadvantage , as we have seen in grangomouth .
all wage fixing in the world does not protect the european petrochemical industry from being hit by cheap american shale gas .
as a result , a revolt is rising , especially in france , the former eu cheerleader .
after the war , france ’ s political elite saw the eu as a vehicle to use to blow germany and to build paris on an equal footing with washington .
but berlin no longer needs paris as a gateway to political legitimacy , and has pushed europe ’ s own economic policy , which has been a struggle for the failing french economy .
the result : marine le pens ’ right-wing , anti-eu front national has just won a decisive election , thus bringing the ruling socialists to the top three .
the national front is now the most popular party in france , with 24 % of the vote – a timely warning to the british labour party that it is not likely to accept a split in the right .
what makes le pen with its newly won popularity among the white french working class ?
it wants to use next year &apos;s eu elections to create an anti-eu anti-community monetary bloc in the european parliament .
if the anti-eu parties do well in these elections – and this is very possible – then for the first time such a bloc could dominate the european parliament .
that is the point i want to make : in the not too distant future , the growing resentment against the eu and the single currency will come together to abolish the euro .
the eu will not disappear , but it will be more like the “ europe of ( sovereign ) nations , ” general de gaulle favored .
germany and some of its satellites may hold on to the euro , but france and southern europe will return to their own currencies .
i expect britain to distance itself from this project in the hope of appealing to the us .
but washington ’ s growing interest in the pacific suggests that britain alone will be in the atlantic rain .
where is scotland in all this ?
we can decide to create a region of ( last in consequence ) small england .
or we can defend our own economic interests – including , to say , berlin and brussels what they can be stuck in .
i suspect that scotland could be in a looser european union if we were to use our own currency .
cooperation with other similar countries is not a federalist europe of nations .
otherwise , we should consider sharing norway &apos;s responsibility and maintaining our economic independence .
the snp government in scotland is – remarkably – the most successful political movement against the austerity policies in europe , and has made a spectacular majority in 2011 , by rejecting the proposed ( and made ) cuts .
it would be ridiculous for scotland to decide now for independence only to be able to demand savings from berlin and brussels .
early puberty : growing faster , the growth of the body is faster , and the growth of the body is faster .
afro-american and hispanic girls tend to reach puberty rather than their white peers , as studies show .
physical changes do not directly imply puberty , but are not yet immediately adulterated .
there is no evidence that hormones or other chemicals are responsible for the disease .
experts believe that the epidemic obesity is a trigger of early puberty .
the trend towards early puberty is less pronounced among young people and is less pronounced in young people .
the former cnn correspondent pat etheridge is a journalist who specializes in child health and family issues .
if a mother is concerned when her daughter is already seven or eight years old , she is growing breasts and shamhairs ?
at the annual conference of the american academy of pedicule association , this week in orlando , florida , the paediatric endocrine expert explained dr. paul kaplovnik .
“ i spend a lot of time reassuring parents – normally this is not a sign that the puberity is now rapidly becoming apparent , ” kaplowitz explained .
obvious indications of development , such as growing breasts , sham- and axle hair , as well as body smell , are visible earlier in girls .
however , there was only a slight shift in the age of the menarche ( the first bleeding occurs ) in the last 40 years .
in the united states , the average age is 12.5 years , slightly less than 12.75 in 1970 .
“ when the breasts develop , it takes at least two to three years to reach the menarche , ” kaplowitz said , also author of the book “ early puberty for girls : the essential advisor .
time is the most accurate test of how puberty progresses .
it is controversial what actually marked the beginning of puberty , but it is important to “ anticipate ” the breast enlargement of a growth trap before an age of eight years .
in most cases , the process or stagnant – something that a child doctor has to monitor closely .
if progress is made more quickly , tests by endikronologist could be indicated to prevent serious problems such as tumours or cysts .
there are treatments for delaying an early menstruation and defense of another consequence : the premature ageing of the bones , the ultimate in the growth impediment and thus clouds .
the recommendations for medication or hormonal therapy are based on the age of the child , the speed of development , the rate of growth and the emotional maturity .
psychosocial aspects are also important .
kaplowitz is cautious in terms of medication , but he admits : “ suppressing puberty can cause behavioral problems and the feelings of girls , unlike their peers .
the other major problem is understandable : parents simply do not want their very young daughters to have the period .
&quot; they worry about the risk of pregnancy or about how to improve the hygienic side , &quot; kaplowitz said .
“ it was a shock , ” recalls a woman whose daughter was given her days with ten .
even though there were initial signs and we had talked about menstruation , it was not emotionally prepared .
she was frightened and excited by the school to come home because she was the first in her friends circle .
there are many widely publicized theories about the causes of early puberty .
but there is no conclusive evidence that hormones are produced in milk or other food , chemicals in the environment or sexual health .
boys come into puberty in the past , similar to girls .
kaplowitz believes that the most compelling premise is the epidemic of obesity .
he supported the implementation of a study in 2001 on girls aged six to nine , which established a connection between body fat and entering the puberty .
other studies support this conclusion , but there are many other factors that have played a role .
in this country , african-american and hispanic girls tend to reach puberty rather than their white peers .
there are different explanations for this .
global seems to have an early puberty of all kinds influenced by economic conditions , climate , genes .
another mystery : although boys have been able to use facial and shaman hair before , the trend towards a full-scale earlier puberty is not as marked as in girls .
other doctors at the aap conference stressed the complexity of the issue .
the appearance of acne and shamhaar is not common even among babies and infants .
“ we must be careful how we can prevent the true beginning of puberty , ” said dr. lawrence silverman , a paediatric endocrinologist at goryeb children .
parents should not hesitate to consult their pediatrician about how to talk to their child .
“ this may mean that you have to talk earlier than expected , ” kaplowitz said .
if you remain calm , the child usually reacts well .
girls who flourish early need the insurance that the process is a normal part of life , even if it is earlier than intended .
jumbo manufacturers argue against the need to reduce the seating width of their cars in the face of large orders .
it has become a dispute between leading aircraft manufacturers over the width of seats in the tourist class with long-haul flights , which is the tone for a bitter collision on the dubai airshow this month .
the dispute is about the seat width , the passenger &apos;s seat width on long flights in the tourist class – not always those to whom the flight is best addressed .
airbus this week called for an industry standard that would allow a seat width of at least 46 cm ( 18 inches ) in the tourist class , but the us archery council was not able to agree .
the dispute comes at a time when the aircraft builders are competing to produce even larger versions of their two-engine long-range aircraft .
like the rear part of the aircraft is designed – especially if it is series with nine or ten seats – is crucial for the economic results indicated , which are the new “ mini jumbo ” design .
boeing claims that its modernised 77x keg 406 seats 406 people in the tourist class , which has 17 inch wide and thus has ten per row .
airbus declares that the competing version of the a350 carries 350 people in 18 inch wide seats in the tourist class , with nine per row .
aircraft giants often share the highest level of technical details through advertising in the press .
now , airbus appeals before the dubai airshow , where the 77x with over 100 orders is expected to make the race , directly to the public .
recently , the company presented an ad that marks the beginning of a new advertising war and gives a picture to the donors that brought three people together in a restaurant .
“ boeing is proposing long-haul flights in seats that are more closely tied to regional turbo props , ” says airbus ’ chief sales officer , john leahy .
given changes in eating habits , people will become thicker , but aircraft seats have not changed radically .
between the early 1970 ’ s , when the boeing 747 defined the modern long-distance journey , and the end of the century , the weight of the male average american has increased from 40 to 49 years .
the waist size of the male average american in the 21st century is about 100.8 cm according to us health statistics .
airbus says that its rival is following a seating concept from the 1950s , when the average body size of the newly baptized “ jet set ” was narrower .
according to airbus , investigations have been carried out to show that an additional customs ( 2.54 cm ) per seat would reduce the sleep quality by 53 % .
boeing denies the numbers of airbus in terms of the seating and says that it is not at the discretion of the manufacturers to decide how airlines will maintain the balance between fares and equipment .
the company also explains that according to studies the experience on the aircraft is more than the width of the seat .
“ it really is about giving airlines flexibility so that they can do what they think they need to do in order to be successful , ” explains the airline cabin expert .
you do not want us to dictate what makes you profitable .
you know your business better than anyone else .
passengers are concerned with greater elbow freedom , but for manufacturers , it will increasingly be a subject that relates to sales .
behind the contest there is a race for aircraft orders with an estimated volume of at least $ 700 billion at list prices in the coming decades , which will have a lasting impact on the us or europe &apos;s export balance .
as reuters reported for the first time in july , the seat layout is the driving force behind the battle for the new jets .
both airbus and boeing are claiming 20 % more efficiency per seat with their latest twin-engine long-range designs than the market leader in this segment , which is the 365 seater boeing 77-300er .
the statements made by boeing on the results are partly dependent on the 77x being equipped with the original design of nine seats in the 777 seats per row .
the increased cost per unit is still lower than that of currently used machines with ten seats per row .
“ boeing is therefore squeezing more seats into its aircraft to make it more competitive with our products , ” says kevin keniston , head of passenger comfort at the european airbus .
on the other hand , analysts say full cabins with ten seats per row at existing 77s indicate that many passengers are in favour of closer arrangement , which would mean cheaper fares .
“ eighteen inch seat width would be great for passengers , but the reality is that from an economic point of view , the airbus offer is threatened by the 777-200 threat . ”
airbus and boeing do not offer seats , but a catalogue of suppliers from which the airlines can choose .
the world travelers jet sellers even carry bandwidth with them to help the equipment in the competition .
even if you praise comfort , all manufacturers offer high-speed , high-density jets .
airbus offers a ten-seater a350 , but it has not yet sold it .
until recently , airbus stressed the importance of greater cabin adaptability and of broadening seats for some jet &apos;s passenger seats .
without the support of the only other manufacturer of large modern jets , experts say that the call for a new industry standard is likely to be puffed , but the wave of 77x sales could be distracted .
new anti-nicotine vaccine could give the pleasure of smoking a boost .
scientists have taken an anti-nicotine vaccine that will increase the fun of smoking .
a single dose of the vaccine has been able to protect mice from smoking for a lifetime .
before testing on humans , further tests are needed , which may take some years , but professor ronald crystal of weill cornell medical college has been working in new york to explain the first results .
“ we are very hopeful that this kind of vaccination strategy will help millions of smokers who have tried to stop and will be able to use all the methods available on the market , but have had to see their nikon dust .
the new vaccine contains a harmless virus that has been modified to contain genetic information on the production of nicotine antibodies .
the virus selectively infects the liver cells , which then produce a constant stream of antibodies .
the antibodies hunt the nicotine molecules in the blood and neutralize them before they can spread the brain , thus creating a smoker no nicotine high .
in trials vaccinated mice , which were administered nicotine , maintained their normal level of activity .
mice without vaccination , on the other hand , would have taken a “ time out , ” the researchers declared , a sign that nicotine has reached its brain .
the experiments are described in the journal science translational medicine .
earlier tobacco vaccines failed because they had antibodies and were not vaccinated .
vaccinations had to be used to maintain the antibody level as often as they were expensive and unpractical .
but the cost of the new vaccine is probably much lower , because it transforms liver cells into antibody factories .
as professor crystal said , a future vaccine for people who are not very sure about whether they are administered could be used before they are tempted to give a cigarette .
but it is more likely that smokers will use it to stop .
&quot; you know , then : if you start smoking again , you feel a lot of pain because of the nicotine vaccine , and that helps you to get rid of your habit , &quot; he explains .
british scientists have said that the results are interesting , but at the same time warned that further research is needed .
tripodi argues that obeid has influenced his work to be a part of the world .
against the former labour party minister joe tripodi of new south wales , an investigation by the government corruption authorities is being initiated .
the former nsw minister denies that the maritime packaging regulations are being revised at the request of his political mentor , eddie obeid , the concealed shareholding on three land at the state-controlled level .
the independent commission against corruption commission ( iacs ) is an independent commission for corruption and has published its investigations on friday on the question of whether obeid is a different state minister .
now , the accusation is being made that tripodi had been led by obeid &apos;s hidden interest in the land after tripodi &apos;s former deputy secretary general was appointed lynne ashram .
in years of talks , which began in 2005 , the government had responded to public tenders for lease contracts .
the paedors were opposed to this and also wanted longer maturities .
in 2009 , the lease contracts for the companies were signed on the circular quay , which annually brought the obeids $ 2.5 million , without any public tender .
tripodi , who was minister for ports from february 2006 to november 2009 , was originally in favour of public tenders .
but he resisted making the changes at obeid ’ s request , who , as tripodi confirmed , insisted on a redesign of government lease regulations .
one of the icac telephone records showed talks from august and september 2007 between obeid , tripodi and steve dunn , a senior official who was sent to the port ministry , after he had been under obeid .
“ was the issue discussed in these telephone conversations the development of commercial packaging regulations ? ” , the deputy commissioner asked anthony kroeber .
&quot; no &quot; , replied tripodi .
i cannot remember what was discussed , but that was definitely not the case .
definitely not between me and mr obeid .
israeli fighter planes are targeting syria , according to official sources , and according to israel ’ s sources , they are targeting the country , according to official sources .
israeli fighters could have set a target in the syrian port of latakia on thursday night , confirmed a senior government official ’ s opposition to fox news .
the official did not explain what the objective was , but said that it was at least one .
according to associated press , the goal was russian sa-125 missiles .
at least twice this year , israel has already delivered air strikes on missile supplies in syria .
foreign workers with 457-visas could be subjected to ‘ real-estate ’ tests , which would be a good idea .
the government is thinking about a “ real-estate test ” for foreign workers of 457-visas as as part of expanded measures .
if the test were to be introduced , it would be a criterion for preventing the 457 from being used as a recruitment or a back door for the entry of family and friends into australia .
today , a government proposal for discussion was published after the former labour party mep , maxine mckew , had read the government &apos;s comments on foreign workers .
“ loud explanations such as foreigners should sit back in the back , ” and , australians first set , “ is a very unpleasant backslide in times when trade unions were demanding a protected labour market , ” said australia today .
historically , this meant that white workers should be protected – and if some in the region have an echo of this historical artifact , then that is the way i would not be surprised .
the proposal for discussion outlines 12 measures that were once proposed by the former minister for immigration , chris bowen .
minister of immigration , brendan o &apos;connor , who spoke yesterday about human trafficking in sri lanka , has mentioned five of the recommended changes , which other countries will have considered .
if the &apos; criterion of authenticity &apos; is adopted , then someone who applied for a visa could be checked to see whether &apos; the application is in the real case , in which the applicant is in the visa &apos; s case .
firms could also be obliged to account for the number of 457 visa holders after the elections in the past have been held by companies that initially had only a small number of workers , eventually hundreds .
meanwhile , a 35-year-old sri lankan asylum seeker probably died in a heart attack after he was killed with a refugee boat on the christmas eve island this week .
the disturbed nine-year-old son of the man who had come with him to australia , has been arrested since the death of his father on wednesday by an adult cousin , who was also on the boat .
australian authorities brought the man to the christmas island hospital where he died .
the british government announced a study which would highlight the benefits of the hs2 rail project for scotland .
in the work of hs2 ltd it is proposed to create a new high speed internet connection between scotland and scotland from the beginning of phase 1 in 2026 .
transport minister baroness kramer said that the project “ will bring britain closer together ” .
the scottish transport minister , keith brown , said that he was very pleased to work with the british government on this plan .
phase 1 consists of a new high-speed rail link between london and the west midlands .
after phase 2 is completed , there will be connections to manchester and leeds .
in june , the government corrected the estimated costs of building the high-speed road between london and nordengland of £ 32.7 billion to £ 42.6 billion .
the british government , which is in talks with transport scotland , has commissioned hs2 ltd to seek further capacity and improved travel times for nordengland and scotland .
this includes the possibility of a travel time of finally three hours or less from glasgow and edinburgh to london .
baroness kramer said : “ our goal for hs2 is a truly national network of routes that brings britain and its cities closer together . ”
we are making progress with hs2 because it brings enormous benefits .
without it , we are facing a capacity crisis in our rail network .
but it is also about the link between 18 british cities , including glasgow and edinburgh , which is being improved thanks to hs2 .
the scottish secretary of state , alistair carmichael , commented : “ today ’ s announcement is good news for scotland . ”
on behalf of the scottish government , keith brown carmichael called for a “ unequivocal ” commitment to the hs2 network .
brown said , “ the high-speed rail link has the potential of enormous economic benefits for scotland , while at the same time providing scotland ’ s economic power an argument for fast rail links throughout the uk . ”
we are therefore pleased to work as a partner of the british government and to improve the options for high-speed rail links in scotland , which will bring benefits to everyone and make the glasgow-edinburgh link , which is the government .
i look forward to discussing the report of inquiry with the british ministers next year and to working together to decide on the next steps .
rules on electronic equipment in aeroplanes remain provisionally in force in australia .
australian air passengers must continue to use tablets and smartphones when they start and land , despite efforts in the us to improve the rules for such devices .
the us federal aviation administration ( faa ) allows us airlines to meet their requirements , so that passengers can be on their machines while critical flight phases e-books , watch videos or play videos , provided they are in the “ air ” mode .
during most of the flight , passengers are already allowed to do so , but many people find it annoying that they are losing their e-books when they start and land .
australian societies are watching the decision to be taken by us airlines to do a lot of work in implementing them , but are not planning to change their rules directly .
casa , the air traffic control authority , also stated that it would look at the announcement , but stressed that the restrictions on the use of electronic equipment in critical flight phases in australia still apply .
“ casa has no specific regulations regarding the use of electronic equipment on the aircraft at the moment , ” was announced .
this issue is governed by provisions that allow airlines to maintain safety at all times and allow passengers to use the safety instructions given by cabin crew .
virgin has already started discussions with casa to extend its wi-fi entertainment program .
“ we would welcome a review of the approval of electronic equipment by casa , because we are convinced that this would improve the customer experience after we have ( wireless interconnection ) been in use during the flight , ” said one .
qantas explained that you will remain with the current rules until further notice .
“ our current guidelines provide that electronic devices can not be used at startup and landing , and we currently have no plans to change this , ” the company declared .
the faa rules apply to us airlines .
however , we are always interested in regulatory developments that can benefit passengers and will be followed by the faa decision and the reasons behind it .
the decision has an impact on us companies depending on the age of the fleet .
they must prove that their aircraft are tolerating the radio disturbances caused by mobile devices , and manuals , training materials , hand baggage programs and customer instruction can change .
“ after an airline has confirmed the tolerance of its fleet , it can make it easier for passengers to use portable , easy-to-use electronic devices such as tablets , e-book readers and smart phones at any height , ” he announced .
in rare cases , when the crew is in a bad light , the passengers will instruct them to switch off the equipment during landing .
the group also recommended that heavier devices be safely placed under the seat or in the compartment over the seats when starting and landing .
before the &quot; schalke &quot; reversal , the bvb trailers with luminous missiles had traveled to the veltins arena .
borussia dortmund subsequently announced tough consequences .
before the friday match of the bundesliga against the vfb stuttgart , the ultras responded with a silence - first .
it was an unfamiliar , almost ghostly acoustics , which were still unheard of by the viewer until shortly before the bundesliga was launched between the german vice champion borussia dortmund and vm .
the hotel was very clean and the staff were very friendly and helpful .
the southern gallery , on the other hand , where the most loyal - and loud - fans of bvb were standing , initially presented themselves exceptionally quietly : no songs , no battlegrounds .
the podium of capo , which otherwise coordinates joint fire-fighting , remained unfilled .
and at the front of the gallery , lonely threw a great flag with a title &quot; section ban &quot; .
only as goalkeeper roman willow feller as always first bvb player entered the course , broke up short-term cheerful .
when his team colleagues followed , there were vocal and wretched scarves - but not everywhere .
in the central blocks 12 and 13 of the southern grandstand , nothing was stirring .
the fact that stadium speakers norbert dickel once again took advantage of the positive experiences of the last few days - derbysieg , victory over arsenal , extension of the contract by trainer jürgen klopp .
only five minutes before the start of the attack the capo erupted his podium - and the podium was almost with hands .
finally , as always , the southern gallery was the turn - and finally here was again the loudest place in the stadium .
and at the latest as with a touch from the southern grandstand the loudly call &quot; derbysieger stands up &quot; , everything was as always .
the silence before that was probably a response to what has happened in recent days .
just before the rivierby at fc schalke 04 , some of the truck drivers had bvb beamers in the audience ranks and placed in the square - and almost torhat .
the game was lost due to the chaotic scenes belatedly .
bvb-boss hans-joachim watzke had the heads of the dortmund ultras then received in his office - and believed watzke &apos;s words , was this a more important message for the fan representatives .
&quot; it is used for the entire ultra-movement to make massive cuts , &quot; the bvb boss announced on thursday evening on a panel discussion in frankfurt .
as an emergency measure , watzke banned the ultras from playing a choreography for the home game against the vfb stuttgart .
&quot; i forbidden that , &quot; he explained .
the zero tolerance policy on pyrotechnics cannot be abandoned .
in addition , the ultras have been shown various ways of punishing them - until tuesday they have time to decide for one .
otherwise , he will be the bvb until the end of next week .
&quot; this will be drastic &quot; , insured watzke .
you can be curious about how the reactions in the southern gallery will then be .
pfandhouses are booming in singapore , as the crisis has hit the middle class .
in a pfandhaus in the bendemeer shopping centre in singapore , janani amirthalinga exchanges a golden armreif , a ring and a few earrings to kill off the school fees of her .
“ my husband and i have just bought a house , there ’ s all my money in it , ” says amirthalinga .
although they receive 3,000 singapore dollars ( about 1,730 euros ) each month as a management employee and their husband also works , the monthly family income does not extend , she explains .
indeed , demand in parts of south-east asia – where household debt is rising – is so large that valuemax , where it can sustain its exchange , is the third pfandhaus this week .
the pledging of jewellery is not only a quick way to get money – 1,300 singapore dollars in the case of janani amirthalinga – but also almost as favorable as an unsecured darkness .
typically , pfandhouses in singapore demand an effective annual rate of 17 % , which is just above 15.4 % , which the united overseas bank requires , a local interest in lending .
however , pfandhouses offer the advantage that no verification of creditworthiness or income evidence is required here , which makes loans possible more quickly than in banks .
that is why millions of people in the region turn to pfandhouses , as families have been pushed to reduce the pressure by increasing living costs and increasing household and consumer debt .
after five years of robust growth since the global financial crisis and cheap loans due to loose fiscal policies in developed economies , families with lower and middle-income families are looking for shelters to stay at stotternid economies .
this week , the rating agency called standard &amp; poor &apos;s growing budget debt , mainly due to rising mortgages , a risk-factor for credit rating .
malaysia , thailand , and singapore , according to the agency , have the highest budget debt in asia in terms of gdp .
malaysia , with 80 % of gdp , is at the top of the list , with 60 % still rising in 2008 .
economists also worry about the high consumer debt in thailand , which this week was just out of a technical recession .
on thursday , the data showed that there is still a weakness in exports and a decrease in consumer demand .
“ in the final analysis , this means that , with rising costs , people in the middle to lower segment ( the income scale ) will try to supplement their income wherever possible . ”
historical gold price peaks over the past two years have reversed the trend of pledging personal items , as people have taken the opportunity to buy the jewellery of the family in cash .
in singapore , about 70 % of the pledged items are in the 200 pledge houses of the city state of gold .
people say , “ the gold price looks good , let us be grandmother ’ s gold chain pledged and recover next month . ”
the largest thai pfandhaus operator , easymoney , has a 20 % discount on its stores .
the growth in the deposit business is so strong that valuemax , the operator of the branch in bendemeer and 15 others in singapore , not only to the neighboring malaysia , would like to expand – where that .
the company finances the company , with 60 % of the 66 million singapore dollars it received this week with the singapore stock market .
while some lenders are crumbling over high interest rates , yeah explains that pfandhouses are not only cheaper interest rates than other lenders , but also not directly financing the debt .
“ customers borrow items that they already own , and the liquefied personal valuables do not increase household debt , ” she explains .
the deposit business is increasingly seen as short-term , secured financing in the social sphere .
nor are all people who use pfandbrief loans in financial difficulties .
rich people from singapore also come to valuemax branches to buy gold bars and rolex watches .
we have clients from all social backgrounds .
“ these include wealthy people who can do something for a business or investment in the short term , or small businesses that have bottlenecks in cash flow , ” says yeah .
sometimes you just need money very quickly .
nsa absorbs data from google and yahoo - snowden wants to help you to find the right snowden .
the intelligence advisor edward snowden has a fundamental interest in helping germany to clarify the increasingly explosive advertising of the nsa at the end of the war .
according to the presentation of the green federal member hans-christian ströbele , his surprising meeting with snowden in russia was about the conditions under which the ex-intelligence service staff could be prosecuted by a german prosecutor or public prosecutor .
snowden has pointed to his complicated legal situation , ströbele told the ard magazine &quot; panorama &quot; .
rescue package over 325 million australian dollars for tasmanian health care .
the australian government insists on the harsh conditions that the $ 325 million rescue package will bring to the tasmanian health care sector .
federal minister for health tanya plibersek announced that the commonwealth will be taking “ immediate action ” to avert a crisis caused by an aging population of the island state , a higher quota to chicken .
the funding for a four-year period was agreed with the independent tasmanian mep andrew wilkie after government consultations .
“ the government has proposed an emergency rescue package that will , in our view , address the unique challenges facing the federal state in terms of its own , ” said plibersek today .
the $ 325-million package includes $ 31 million of emergency aid for electoral services .
the new 2600 surgery , including orthopaedic operations and treatments for grey star , will eliminate residues .
in addition , there is money for day-to-day clinics in hobart and launceston , better aftercare after stationary stays , facharzeugtraining , services in the field of mental health and the introduction of a data system for local health .
“ these investments are in line with the ideas that affected clinical staff have told me that they are the best way to improve the tasmanian health system , ” said tanya plibersek .
the minister insisted on a strict reporting and accountability of the tasmanian government .
the state must maintain the current level of funding to finance commonwealth .
a three-member commission will be set up to ensure that the state provides health services as effectively and efficiently as possible .
as wilkie said today , the $ 325 million would be of little use if “ they are not accompanied by real reforms that will drive public tasmania health care to a more sustainable course . ”
despite this , he praised the government for responding to his request for urgent help , which he first made to the prime minister at the beginning of may .
“ i am confident that the federal aid will make a major contribution to improving the state ’ s public health system from the list of concerns , ” said wilkie .
according to the state government , these electoral benefits will largely offset the recent cuts .
but the opposition ’ s federal health spokesman , peter dutton , believes that today ’ s announcement is only a “ paving solution . ”
“ we are in the present situation because the laboratory-state government has withdrawn $ 430 million from the health system , ” he said to abc tv .
a state government cannot be allowed to run almost half a billion dollars out of the system and the commonwealth should be eur 300 million and then put in place as if it were good news .
dutton asked plibersek to guarantee that not a single dollar of the rescue package would be spent on additional bureaucracy .

syria has made its way to producing chemical weapons destroyed , a monitoring group , a group of people have said that it would not be able to do so , a monitoring group that would be set up to monitor the situation .
syria has established important facilities for the production of chemical weapons and gitting gas ammunition , declared the global monitoring group for chemical weapons on thursday , while it has caused severe clashes in the north of the country near a site .
a syrian activists group also announced on thursday that more than 120,000 people have been killed since the start of the civil war , but soon three years ago .
the announcement by the organization for the ban on chemical weapons ( opcw ) came one day before the date on which the ban was due on the day before the date on 12 january 2007 .
november 1 , which the hague based organisation damascus had set up to provide all the facilities for the production of chemical weapons or to prevent “ inoperable ” , including all the machines for mixing of chemical weapons .
the conclusion of this process , which is , in fact , the first stage of destruction , is an important milestone in an ambitious timetable aimed at destroying all chemical weapons in syria by mid-2014 .
the destruction of the facilities means that syria will no longer be able to produce new chemical weapons .
damascus , however , must begin to use the weapons and stocks that exist .
it is believed that there are about 1,000 tonnes of chemicals and weapons in the country , including mustard gas and the nervous gas sarin .
the announcement came at a time when on thursday fighting in the city of safira took place , by the experts say that there was a production facility for chemical weapons and storage facilities here , such as those based in the uk .
the activist group , which has a network of activists in syria persecuting the number of dead , declared on thursday 120,296 people dead .
of these , 61,067 civilians , including 6,365 children .
the government had 29,954 of them committed to president bashar assad ’ s army , 18,678 were pro-government fighters , and 187 lebanese hizbollah militias .
the death toll is 2.202 deserted army soldiers and 5,375 opposition fighters , many of them foreigners .
on 25 july , the un estimated the number of deaths in this conflict since march 2011 to 100,000 .
this number has not been updated .
the conflict has led to the exodus of some two million people .
assad ’ s troops have been fighting the rebels in safira for weeks , many of whom have links with al qaeda groups .
the observatory said that there were losses on thursday on both sides , but did not mention details .
the fighting underlines the danger posed to the chemical weapons inspectors , because their mission to liberate syria from its toxic weapons arsenal is a race against time amidst a raging civil war .
according to the opcw , which cooperates closely with the united nations , the team was “ now convinced that it would be able to meet all the important production and mixing / filling facilities mentioned by syria and to see their destruction . ”
therefore , “ no further inspection activities are planned at the moment . ”
earlier this week , the inspectors said that they had completed the first round of checks and that they had completed 21 out of 23 of the sites indicated by damascus .
due to security concerns , the visit of two facilities was not possible , the inspectors said .
on thursday , opwc stated that the two sites were “ abandoned ” according to syrian statements ... and the chemical weapons program objects there were transferred to other facilities named , which were inspected . ”
it was not immediately clear whether the site in safira was one of the two facilities that the opcw inspectors could not visit .
syria has a plan for the complete destruction of its chemical weapons , which will be approved next month by the opwc executive committee .
“ i take my hat off to the bravery and courage that you all showed in fulfilling the most challenging mission ever undertaken by this organisation .
for three years now , the mainly sunni muslim rebels have been fighting assad ’ s government and its security forces , which have led many members of the alawites , to a secession of shia islam .
with regard to further developments , the head of the observatory , rami abdurrahman , said that there was a strong explosion in an air defence facility in the syrian coastal province of latakia on wednesday .
the cause of the explosion was not known , he explained .
anger over judgement of bomb depositors of bali
survivors and relatives of the 202 people who died in 2002 during the bali bomb attack responded to anger over the sentence of the last of the instigators , which was brought to justice .
patek , who was one of the most southeast asian people on the run for almost ten years , was nominated yesterday for his role in the construction of explosives for the bomb attack .
with a penalty suspension , it could be made redundant after 15 years .
the 45 year-old was found guilty of mass murder for the attack on two night clubs in the popular tourist area of kuta , where the 202 people died .
a conviction was also made in a number of terrorist charges , including a wave of spurious substances .
the prosecutor had demanded a life sentence , even if it was not acceptable to the man who was considered to be a master bomber maker for his reputation as a “ demolition man ” .
the decision has brought painful memories to june corteen , a mother from perth who had lived her 39 year-old twin daughters jane and jenny in the poetry of patek and his co-plots almost ten years ago .
fighting with tears , she said that patek should have been condemned to death .
i really think he should be in the footsteps of the other guys .
“ you should protect him from a shooting command , ” said corteen to aap .
i have to live with the fact that i am not going to get any further grandchildren and i will never see my daughters again .
the sari club was made the same as the ground when , on 12 october 2002 , a massive bomb was exploded in a small truck that was beaten up in front of the night club .
peter hughes was in paddy &apos;s bar , where only 20 seconds earlier a suicide bomber killed a man filled with explosives .
he fell for a month after the attack and “ died ” three times , while he was in a life preservation system .
hughes said that patek deserved the same fate as the other three members of the yemaah islamiah – amrozi , mukhlas , and imam samudra – terrorist cell responsible for the war .
really , this type should be given the death penalty above all others .
to keep him alive – no , there is no reason to keep him alive .
20 years after he killed 202 people and hundreds wounded , is not much .
patek is the last of the bali bombers to be tried .
he was evicted almost a decade from arrest , but was finally arrested in january 2011 in the pakistani town of abbottabad , where us forces replaced former al-qaeda chief osama , barely four months later .
during the negotiation , an fbi agent said that intelligence reports would point out that the government of patek had committed suicide in pakistan .
“ he didn ’ t stand up , ” said corteen .
until recently , he has not shown any remorse for the suffering he has inflicted on other people .
the judgment was delivered before the ten years of this year &apos;s attack , which was marked by commemorative celebrations in bali and australia .
“ there will be many tears this year , ” said corteen .
patek may appeal against his judgment .
faa : passengers can now use electronic devices on aircraft ( but do not run mobile phone calls ) .
passengers can now travel from the departure to landing to read , work , play , listen to music and watch movies .
but passengers should not expect these changes to be implemented immediately .
how fast they would be implemented depends on the airline , faa employee michael huerta explained on a press conference .
the airlines must prove to the faa that aircraft comply with the new directives and that they have compiled the training manuals of the airline staff and the rules governing the storage of equipment in accordance with the new regulations .
the faa has stated that it has already received plans from some airlines to prohibit the use of portable electronic devices in aircraft .
among these airlines were delta and jetblue .
“ depending on the status of the plan , we could approve the extended use of electronic devices very soon , ” the faa announced in a statement .
currently , passengers must purchase smartphones , tablets and other devices if the airplane doors are closed .
you may not reboot them until the aircraft reaches a height of three kilometres and the captain has the green light .
the ticket for the landing must be turned off by passengers and not rebooted before the aircraft ends .
the new directives would allow airlines whose aircraft are protected from electronic disruptions to allow their passengers to use the equipment even when they start , land and roll fields , declared faa .
most new aircraft and other aircraft that are required to use wi-fi in larger halls are now in use .
laura glading , president of professional aviation companions , welcomed the changes .
“ if the new regulation is implemented safely – and we work closely with the airline in this regard – both sides will benefit , ” commented glading .
we are frankly tired of being a watchdog on this issue .
however , internet connections to surfing , exchanging emails , text messages or downloading data under three kilometres remained prohibited , explained the authority .
passengers are asked to purchase smartphones , tablets and other devices in flight mode .
so there is still no word with friends , the scrabble resembles online game that the actor alec baldwin has launched in 2011 on his smartphone as he publicized public .
and heavier devices like laptops must continue to be stowed , as there is a risk of injury if they fly through the cabin .
mobile calls during the flight remain prohibited as well .
the regulatory competence for telephone calls lies with the federal communications commission ( fcc ) , not with the fact-finding mission .
faa may lift the ban on certain electronic devices when they start and land on the land on startup and landing at faa .
last month , mark rosenker said that he had been arrested by the national transport safety board , security expert on domestic transport issues on cbs news , mobile phones would still be considered as a risk .
“ mobile phones are really a problem , not only because they potentially cause disruption in navigation devices , but because we know from the fcc that the transmission from the air also transports disrupt transmitters , ” said .
a consulting committee of the industry , which was set up by the faa to investigate this issue , last month recommended that the government should draw up a broader deployment of personal electronic equipment .
in recent years , pressure on the faa has increased , restrictions on use have been relaxed .
critics like the democratic senator claire mccaskill of missouri argue that there is no valid legal security .
the restrictions are also increasingly difficult to enforce , because the use of the equipment has become ubiquitous .
some studies have mentioned that up to one third of passengers can be prevented from turning off the equipment or ignored .
the faa began in 1966 to ban the use of electronic equipment by air passengers after reports of disturbances in navigation and communication equipment were replaced by reports by ucits carried by passengers .
new aircraft are much more dependent on electrical systems than previous generations of aircraft , but they are also designed and built by the faa , that they can be provided with electronic interference .
airlines have been offering wi-fi internet access for several years now , when the flight height is reached .
the software solutions adapted to wi-fi systems are also insensitive to the interference of the user .
the vast majority of passenger aircraft should be electronically operated according to the new directives .
today ’ s electronic devices generally produce much less radio radiation than previous generations .
e-readers , for example , only give minimal radiation when you scroll .
however , when downloading or sending data , the transmission values are stronger .
among the advocates of easing restrictions on the use of passenger equipment , amazon.com.
in 2011 , corporate employees ordered a passenger aircraft full of kindle e-reader and made a test flight to identify problems , but could not detect them .
members of the faa advisory committee have expressed mixed feelings about the risk of using faa equipment .
douglas kidd , from the national association of airline passengers , said that he felt that the disruption caused by the equipment was genuine , even if the risk was minimal .
other committee members said that there are only a few reports from pilots who are responsible for disruption of aircraft systems by the equipment .
the committee recommended the faa , however , to allow pilots to take part in instrumental landing under poor visibility conditions by preventing the equipment from being turned off by passengers .
a group from the travel industry welcomed the changes and called them a sensible adjustment for travellers who are now well equipped with technology .
“ we are pleased that the faa recognizes that a pleasant passenger experience is not incompatible with safety , ” said roger dow , ceo of the u.s. travel association .
by air rescue service from north sea drill island rescued bird again .
a car park which is flown by air rescue service to the coast , which is exhausted on a north sea drill island , has been reintegrated into nature .
the water purals were delivered last month with a helicopter to aberdeen , where they were taken from the scottish animal welfare organisation spca to their rescue centre in alloa .
colin seddon , head of the center , said : “ this water purale was probably a winter migratory bird from northern europe , which was buried by the strong winds above the north sea . ”
apparently , the exhausted bird sought refuge on the drill island .
he added : “ he could no longer fly , so we are contacted with the request for help . ”
when they were released , the water purals were fit and healthy again .
is europe ’ s elite prepared to do business with britain ?
business for britain was launched in april with the intention of bringing the economy to a table and defining what those who are in the uk fighting for prosperity and jobs will want to change in our relations with the eu .
to this end , we have launched the largest and most comprehensive survey among british economic leaders and asked them what they thought about britain , the economy and the eu .
yougov inquired about 1,000 business executives who had roughly the uk corporate size , sectors , and regions .
the results of the survey will surprise many .
we have found that the vast majority of companies now export outside europe and rely on countries that are modernising and growing , while the states in the eu are stagnating .
they want new trade links with countries such as china , india and brazil to be favoured by the government , rather than dealing with the long and demanding process that has made the eu ’ s obscure institutions reform .
in demand of their view on certain issues regulated by law – from antitrust law to product legislation – the majority of economic leaders believe that control of these key competences should be based on westminster .
there was general dissatisfaction with the internal market , because according to companies , the cost of the brussels rules has now outweighed the benefits of being part of europe ’ s trade area – even 40 % of large companies agreed .
finally , and probably the most important thing , our survey of economic leaders revealed that a clear majority had moved away from britain in the direction of changing the agreement and that a relationship with the eu based on trade is not political .
this recognition , which has proven to be widely shared by companies of all sizes and leading groups , shows that the economy is pushing for a “ meaningful change ” that will bring the leg of action back to britain .
it is about a lot – a change in the agreement and better conditions for britain would lead to a change of opinion at 16 % in favour of staying in the eu in a referendum .
the prime minister should have no doubt : this survey shows that the british economy is behind its plan to renegotiate british membership conditions .
it also shows that companies are clearly moving away from renegotiation and that the balance of power is clearly shifting back to britain .
a better deal for the british economy is possible and increasingly necessary , as the eurozone is moving toward closer economic integration and fiscal consolidation .
the priority must be jobs and growth in the uk , as the result of our survey shows , what increased attention is paid to trade and fundamental change in the brussels approach to regulation .
alexei miller of gazprom calls the pipeline in bulgaria the beginning of a new gas era in the country the beginning of a new gas era .
the construction of the south stream pipeline in bulgaria marks the start of one of the largest european energy projects , the gazprom board declared .
“ today ’ s event is a milestone : construction work on the bulgarian section of the south stream gas pipeline , the largest and most important project in europe , has begun , ” said gazprom ceo alexandria .
the project is a key element in the energy security of the entire european continent .
south stream is to ensure more diversity in russia &apos;s export routes through europe .
a gazprom contract with his counterparts in ukraine , where most of russia ’ s gas is poured for europe , is a source of increased risk in terms of conventional pipelines , as was suggested by official sources .
miller said the direct link to bulgaria , a member of the european union , meant that the links with transit countries were not “ for ever ” .
bulgarian consumers receive south stream gas at discounted rates when the whole project is up and running in 2015 .
gazprom says that construction work in other subordinate countries should be completed on the planned route at the end of the year .
the pipeline is estimated to have an annual capacity of 62.3 billion cubic metres of natural gas .

hearing before the royal commission : two ymca staff before accusations against jonathan lord for sexual offences .
two new south wales ymca employees ( nsw ) were arrested for sexual offences involving children .
but when the commission opened its doors , the ymca said that ‘ in the organisation there was never a case of sexual child abuse ’ .
managing director phillip hare was interviewed about a case in which a ymca employee was arrested for crimes involving child pornography , and a different case in which a sports teacher from the ymca .
hare said gail furness , one of the commission assisting lawyers , that he knew of the first case , but did not know the second .
he admitted that the opening declaration of the ymca to the commission was also vague in the assertion that “ there were external reviews of the ymca , in which the ymca was seen as the front line .
evidence before the commission shows that the ymca has been informed that it has not yet received the second lowest assessment of four possible in a quality audit of the department of education and communication .
hare , who started with 21 at the ymca , admitted that the management had “ started downwards from me ” in appointing lord .
lord was arrested at the beginning of the year for sexual offences against twelve boys during his two-year activity for the ymca .
he was sentenced to at least six years in prison .
hare , however , insisted that the ymca had a cultural problem that prevented employees from using lords ’ s offences in relation to children ’ s safety .
the staff said that they had observed violations , including that lord was alone with children , they had been privately treated as babysitters , they were on his lap , and said that they had not liked it .
danielle ockwell , whose chief executive was lord and who was asked to provide a child protection training because of his behavior , was concerned that he was not a child .
the managing director stated that he would not accept statements from employees that they would not have dared to reimburse their superiors .
instead , he said , their friendship with lord has affected their judgment , which is why they have not reported it .
hare explained that he has appointed the board of the ymca nsw his view that the lesson the organization learns from the “ jonathan lord intermediary ” incident .
hare said to have taken the decision to brief the staff to sign confidentiality obligations after the accusations occurred , was taken by the ymca ’ s chief child services officer liam whitley .
he said that this should prevent contamination of the evidence , but this is “ overzealous ” and poorly implemented .
the ymca nsw was in the time when jonathan lord was working there between 2009 and 2011 , not a safe organization for children , professor stephen smallbone explained by the griffith university .
he explained that there are “ serious problems ” in hiring , checking , training , and supervising the work of the employees .
the hearing was postponed until 20 december .
tony blair said that he would seize the opportunity to return as british prime minister – but admits that a comeback is unlikely .
in an interview this evening on the fifth anniversary of his retirement from office , the president of the european union , the 59 , announced his views on various domestic issues .
since his resignation in june 2007 , after a decade as head of state , blair has largely avoided expressing his views on british politics , and his comments mostly on foreign policy and his role as envoy of the quartet .
in response to the question of whether he would like to return to the post of prime minister , blair was awarded the eving standard in london by saying , ‘ yes , yes , but it is unlikely that this will happen ... ’
when horse-drawn experts in cardiff found themselves in cardiff to be the horse of the year , they knew that a hard competitor was imminent .
but no one was on the three year-old fenton kirkland .
the knirps , which is not even in the kindergarten and only a few months ago did his first steps , and his shetland pony toffee pulled loosely through the three rounds and hit the first adult .
the inseparable pair , both equal size , were chosen for their appearance , behavior and style in the annual competition .
in his appearance in competition with men and women with elegant melons , he had his leghold cap in a cheeky angle and led the two year-old toffee through the ring .
fenton was chosen by the jurors for its natural skills in handling the pony , which is much higher than its age .
and toffee received best-marks for his performance and personality .
fenton had toffee last march as a gift for his third birthday and since then has been working with the shetland pony every day .
his mother , donna , 30 , said : “ fenton and toffee are a great strand . ”
they had to compete against the entire participants and are covered with gold pockets and rosettes .
it was only the second time that he participated in a competition with toffee , and we were all delighted when he won .
completely strangers in the arena thought he was so phenomenal that they could be photographed with him .
the little boy from the village of nantyglo near ebbw vale , south wales , follows in the footsteps of his aunt sharon howells , who has been holding horses for over ten years .
howell ’ s story : “ the entire audience was as electricized , and everyone fired and clapped him . ”
he ran on sand the entire length of the arena and although he looked so tiny , he has fantastic work done .
fenton is crazy about animals – he loves horses , tractors and farms and has two chickens to feed .
as it is launched , it will not take long before it is on the “ horse of the year ” show – and i am sure he will be well done .

according to the appeal , the chinese newspaper is to be “ reformed ” after “ reformed ”
a chinese newspaper , which called on the front page for the release of a reporter who was charged with defamation , should be reformed .
the guangzhou based new express had a rare public appearance , and the government was not prepared to give up the journalist chen yongzhou .
but chen later admitted on television that he had taken bribes to report a sub-state company that was not in the process of being counterfeited .
now the new express is being subjected to “ comprehensive rectification , ” the regulatory authority declared .
the “ rectification order ” was issued by the press and publications , radio , film and television agency in guangdong .
preliminary investigations showed that the new express , the new express , which was added to the yangcheng evening news group , was closed between september 2012 and august 2013 .
“ the new express editorial management was disordered , ” the regulatory authority announced in a statement .
she said that she decided to “ impose an administrative penalty on chen yongzhou and to give him his reporter license ” .
in addition , the yangcheng evening news group was instructed to introduce a complete rectification of the new express and to recommend that the relevant persons be identified at the new express and immediately notify the new express management team .
chen had written several articles for the new express , in which he reported alleged financial irregularities at a manufacturer of construction machinery called zoomlion .
after being arrested , the newspaper published two calls for his release on the title page and presented itself behind his journalist slogans .
but then chen appeared on state television and admitted that he had published false reports for payment .
“ in this case i have damaged zoomlion , as well as the entire news industry and its ability to win public confidence , ” he declared to the state news channel cctv .
i did so primarily because i was looking for money and glory .
i realized that i was wrong .
following chen ’ s apology , the new express published an apology on the front page , stating that it failed to read the reports correctly .
several well-known suspects have recently been on television confessions .
experts say that confessions are still routinely forced , despite a legislative change in early this year , in which the authorities were banned from imposing someone .
drogentunnels with their own railway between the usa and mexico are discovered by the us and mexico .
one of the most refined tunnels for drug smuggling between the us and mexico , which is completely covered with lighting , ventilation and electric railway operations , has now been discovered .
the us authorities described the 120 x 90 centimeters tunnel as one of the most sophisticated passages that they have ever found .
the tunnel , which is covered in the zigzag pattern over a length of almost six football fields , connects warehouses near tijuana , mexico , and san diego , usa .
there are countless unseemly warehouses in the area , making it easier to use drug-loaded lorries .
the tunnel had been closed before drugs were transported undetected in it , the authorities declared .
when the tunnel was discovered , eight and a half tonnes of marijuana and 148 kilograms of cocaine were secured , according to the court &apos;s records .
three men , according to the authorities , who were drivers , were arrested for the possession and the intended sale of marijuana and cocaine .
they are threatened with prison in a sentence of ten years and for life .
in nogales , arizona , smugglers are relying on an extensive underground network of drainage channels .
the tunnel is the eighth large passage that has been discovered since 2006 in san diego .
some of the largest tunnels were built after marijuana harvest in central mexico in october , which protected the drug cartels from the challenge of how they could quickly bring their product to the consumers .
in 2010 , authorities found a passage of almost 640 metres long with rails that were used by a kitchen in a residential house in tijuana to two storehouses in san diego .

veganism , according to lexika , is subordinate to vegetarianism , but differs from this in a very significant way .
for while vegetarians are dedicated to eating cream cakes , ice cakes or a strong edam , these bad things are not on the menu .
milk , cheese , egg , besides the abandonment of meat and fish , the vegan let the vegan diet of all animal products - even honey is denied .
what remains , one might wonder , but , on closer inspection , vegan nutrition is characterized by a considerable imagination .
&quot; bread spreads are very popular , &quot; explains ute henkelmann , the owner of the local reform house , who has developed a variety of special products for vegans .
reuben proctor also visits the shop in domgasse .
for 13 years , the native vegan , born in new zealand , finds ( almost ) everything that he needs to live in lampertheim . &quot; in 1997 i was introduced to my diet and became a vegetarian .
at the turn of the century , the next step was taken and i became vegan .
&quot; however , the conviction came not only because of nutrition , but because of the choice of shoes , &quot; says proctor , the art leather prefers normal leather .
he realized that there were also other everyday concerns without animal products .
vegan is first and foremost an ethic .
&quot; i do not want animals to die for me , &quot; proctor speaks the vegans &apos; maxim , which extends to the whole consumption behaviour .
instead of burgers , stirring eggs or rubberbears , the vegans quickly discovered new products that could increase enthusiasm .
&quot; it is a double bonus , &quot; proctor says today , &quot; &quot; in fact , vegan does not represent a renunciation , not an ascetic , &quot; the assumption that you can live with the diet .
and it is precisely these conditions that have allowed some of the well-intentioned attempts to fail .
&quot; the addiction factor is a very important factor that many quickly give up , similar to smoking , &quot; proctor makes a comparison .
and applies one : &quot; certain flavors are not fixed to the animal &quot; .
often it is the spices or the type of preparation that make up the taste .
&quot; but you can also create the same effect in other ways , &quot; the vegans clearly point .
procon , for example , brings eggplants , mushrooms and also a few vegan sausages to a barbecue festival .
it is a balanced , varied diet , with a good taste for the food .
of course , we want to have something between the teeth , that is legitimate .
&quot; it should taste , but this is not only to reduce animal food &quot; , says proctor .
health damage , up to eating disorders , another widespread assumption , he did not suffer .
for me , the changeover has had a positive aspect .
i don &apos;t take any foreign cholesterol and i have an increased vitamin content .
there are high performance yachts that are exclusively fed to vegan .
&quot; my blood values are excellent , i let me check them often , &quot; says proctor .
in particular , the lack of vitamin b12 warns many vegansists .
&quot; since animals are fed with feed , rather than being grazed on the pasture , it is doubtful whether the meat they eat in the refrigerator is the vitamin b12 content high . &quot;
vegans also have the opportunity to use the coenzyme in the form of tablets .
&quot; my b12 values are fine , &quot; he explains .
long distances must not be made by proctor for food procurement .
after all , basic foodstuffs exist everywhere and every supermarket has now soya milk and other products .
all i need is locally .
i buy something special only from time to time .
&quot; many people overlook the fact that only the finished products are expensive , but that is the way it is known for &quot; ordinary &quot; finished products .
in any case , vegan dishes are much cheaper and less time-consuming than conventional vegan dishes .
&quot; there is a lot to discover in the kitchen , with a few small snacks you can get good , if not sometimes better results , &quot; says proctor .
margarine instead of butter , a little more baking powder and carbon acid instead of egg , with its vegan cheese cakes proctor could also astound his faithful parents .
family celebrations give vegans a new spice .
this is dynamic when you cook together , and it has a new significance .
&quot; the situations that may arise are as different as the people themselves , &quot; says proctor .
of course , he has already been sceptical .
do you not like my meal any more ?
&quot; should i feel bad now because i drink milk ? &quot; - at such a situation i have to ask as vegans with fingertips .
&quot; i do not reject people , i am part of this society , &quot; proctor does not want to be an enclave .
and , more precisely , the everyday world does not appear as vegan alien as suspected - and vegans are not as restricted in everyday life as they usually assume .
fast food is also allowed .
pommes are everywhere !
&quot; many döner shops offer falafel , or even a vegetarian yufka , &quot; says proctor .
in a pizzeria , he is a little more than pasta dishes , or he orders a pizza without cheese , all a matter of habit .
the restaurants are so slowly settling down on it .
&quot; when i started to get vegan 13 years ago , everything was much more difficult , &quot; the new-zealand country can identify a development : &quot; you have to be with people who need it to be alert &quot; .
&quot; if there are enough enquiries , they may be inclined to add to the menu , &quot; he hopes .
vegan restaurants evolve , such as the mannheim combustle or the café bird free .
proctor wishes that other restaurants , too , can serve at least a vegan dish on the menu .
in fact , vegan dishes are available for all .
everyone can eat them , so they are exactly the opposite of exclusive .
&quot; meat dishes are exclusive , and are literally , because they close other people out , &quot; proctor notes .
&quot; if we want to avoid food scandals , veganism is a sure way to protect the vast majority of the population from the outset , &quot; says proctor .
vegans can be a bit difficult to buy at the beginning .
especially when you learn to understand that is also used in peanuts animal additives as a color giver , you seem to be satisfied with adherence to the ethics of so many obstacles and fall quickly out of courage .
not only for this reason , reuben proctor and lars thomsen have written a book : &quot; veganissimo - animal ingredients and their alternatives &quot; explains the many ingredients that make food and also cleaning products .
&quot; gradually , you develop a scanner view and know which characters and logos you have to look at &quot; it is sometimes better to do small steps than to stand or stumble &quot; , says proctor .
veganism , it is an important moral finger pointing to consciousness .
perhaps he does not quite manage to put his habits on hold , but at least he can teach the consumer to critically question his habits .
the exchange operator nasdaq omx keeps its customers in breath .
trade at the nasdaq options market was made on friday afternoon german time .
in a communication the operator made technical problems responsible .
the other 11 us options markets , including two nasdaq omx , continued their business unhindered .
the recent incident involves a whole series of smaller and larger flaws in the stock exchange operator .
only on tuesday the indices of nasdaq were closed due to errors in data transport for an hour .
in august of this year , two breakdowns occurred in one week alone .
first , the us investment bank goldman sachs had a massive number of flawed purchase orders to the options markets because of technical problems .
the stock market operators then needed almost a day to process the orders .
two days later , half of the total us equity trade came to the us because of a computer crash at the nasdaq exchange for several hours .
last year , the stock market of facebook was also responsible for a stir .
the nasdaq systems were the flood of sales and purchase orders , and the number of customers was not increasing .

british police are issuing assange a delivery statement to the british police to inform him of the extradition of the extradition of the british police .
the british police have today sent a delivery notification to wikileaks founder julian assange , who is in the ecuadorian embassy in london to seek refuge and seek asylum .

assange is threatening extradition to sweden for indictment in a sexual offence after his possibilities to do so under british law .
he fears that stockholm will send him to the united states , and on 19 june he had a meeting in the ecuadorian embassy in london to discuss the south american country for political asylum .
scotland yard has been a “ forty-year-old man who has been asked to sign up at a police guard that we have chosen ” , said a spokesman .
he continues to violate the conditions of his release on bail .
the message did not make any comment on the delivery of the police request .

tax on foreign property owners against london ’ s speculative bubble
the treasury has provisionally scaled the cgt measure , but is still waiting for the final decision of chancellor george osborne to replace the cgt in 2012 .
already , the revenue from the stamp tax on residential property in westminster and kensington &amp; chelsea districts , which is the largest in the fiscal year 2012 / 13 , is 708 million pounds , earmarked .
cook said : “ after the increases in the stamp tax on high-price housing and the introduction of the associated legislation can be avoided .
“ but this move could make some foreign investors more cautious about buying property in london , or discourage owners from selling it , ” he added .
first class real estate – the top five to ten percent of the housing market at a price – in the wealthy south west belt in london , which stretches from fulham to wimbledon , has grown around the reef .
prices in central london were growing at a level of 5.6 % per year , but were accompanied by rising “ domestic ” markets .
scientists have been able to shed more light on the connection between the pregnancy of a dog and its mood .
previous research showed that happy dogs with the tail are more right than they are ( from the point of view of the dog ) , while nervous dogs are more likely to be left .
but now scientists say that other dogs perceive these subtle differences and can respond to them .
professor georgio vallortigara , a neuroscientist from the university of trento , said : “ man knows well that the left and right half of the brain react differently to stimuli , which are positive or negative . ”
we have tried to address this in other species .
he also noticed that in dogs , just as in humans , the right half of the brain is responsible for the movement of the left side and vice versa , and that the two hemispheres played different roles in emotions .
to learn more about how dogs are pushed to the side of the tail , please check the dog &apos;s page .
it measures the heart rate of the four legs and analyzed the behavior .
we will probably soon understand why the cock is in one , one direction , another .
professor vallortigara said : “ we have been showing dogs films with dogs – either a natural version or a silhouette to make distraction other aspects .
when the animals saw a much-depressing dog sucking the cock to the right ( from the perspective of the boiling dog ) , they bore the whole thing in a relaxed state .
but was the inclination mainly to the left ( again from the perspective of the dog , who wears ) , so their heart rate rose and they saw uneasy .
according to professor vallortigara , the dogs do not deliberately communicate with each other through these movements .
he is convinced that the dogs have learned from experience which movements they are worried about and when not .
he said , ‘ if you have different encounters with other dogs and you want to wound with the tail in one direction , you have to be friendly and the right side is more like a less friendly behavior , then you respond on the basis . ’
researchers say that the findings have been passed on to owners of dogs , vets and coaches to help them understand the emotions of their animal .
john bradshaw , expert in dog behaviour and guest scholarship at the faculty of animal medicine at the university of bristol , declared that this was not the first study to be studied whether links were being accepted .
last year , a team from lincoln university found out that dogs are turning their heads to the left when they have to look at an aggressive dog , and right when it is a satisfied dog .
in another research work at the university of victoria in canada , the following stated : “ dogs are more likely to go to a robot dog if his tail is left wearing and not right instead of uneasy .
according to his statement , the differences could stem from the fact that the dogs in the various studies were the animals in the films or the robot dogs not interpreted as dogs .
a study on how dogs react to real dogs could help , he explained .
“ while there is considerable evidence of many different mammals that the two halves of the brain are used for different purposes , many of the details still need to be determined – and dogs are no exception , ” says braddsw .
but as their behavior is easy to record , it will probably not take long before we understand why the cock sometimes turns into one , sometimes into another .

pope francis appoints the first cardinals in february .
pope francis will be publishing new cardinals of the catholic church on 22 february , as the vatican announced on thursday .
cardinals are the highest clerics in the catholic church after the pope and they are also the ones who make a pope , so that franciscus can be the first group of men .
there are currently 201 cardinals .
however , a cardinal reaching 80 years can no longer be part of the pope ’ s election – a group of 120 “ electorate . ”
in a statement in which the message was announced , father federico lombardi , a spokesman of the vatican , said that there would be a meeting of all cardinals before the ceremony was held .
&quot; pope francis has decided to postpone his decision to convene the story in february in advance , so that other meetings that will allow the participation of cardinals from all over the world can be planned . &quot;
jack valero of cathic voices said that the number of eligible cardinals by february is likely to have fallen .
he declared that a pope normally appoints as many cardinals as needed to keep the number of cardinals entitled to vote 120 again , and so many cardinals over 80 , as he would like .
next year &apos;s consistency is therefore important because it is the first since the election of franciscus in march this year , so valero .
there is currently a certain overhang on the part of europe and , in particular , italy .
“ it will be interesting to see whether the new pope will be cardinals from the rest of the world to restore balance , ” he said .
forty percent of catholics live in south america , but they have only a tiny number of cardinals .
the cardinals will also be the first to be created since the creation of the council of cardinals , founded by francis , a group of eight cardinals from around the world who are responsible for the work .
in the past , the pope decided everything alone .
&quot; now , francis has chosen these eight cardinals to help him , &quot; said valero .
he said that it is “ possible ” that francis was the cardinals for advice .
but so far we have not been in this position – that is all new .
valero said that typically the bishops from large places become cardinals , but stecke francis is “ full of surprises – we know not to whom he is appointed .
gm calls new pickup trucks in the usa to repair the seat backrest .
general motors call almost 19,000 of his brand new chevrolet silverado and gmc sierra pickup trucks built in 2014 to solve a problem with the manual seatbelt .
some of the cars may have a defect in the mechanism for the restraint of the front seat backrest .
for this reason , they do not comply with the federal regulations on vehicle safety in headrests .
“ when the vehicle is mounted from the back , it is possible that the head restraint is not properly protecting the occupants , so that there is an increased risk of injury , ” the news was on the national highway website .
the recalled models were made between august 1 and september 10 .
the delivery of the gm trucks began in june and represents the main model launch of the leading us car manufacturer since the insolvency restructuring in 2009 .
gm informed the vehicle owners in the first half of october about the defect .
the nhtsa was able to take advantage of the 16 day government shutdown to check the notification letter , which had a negative impact on car sales in october .
the sale of silverado and sierra trucks , which are newly developed for the 2014 model year , has been reduced by 20 percent in the first ten months of the year , gm declared on friday .
in october , gm 42.660 silverado and 16.503 sierra pickup trucks sold .
gm shares rose to € 1.4 percent on the new york stock exchange , to $ 37.47 on friday afternoon .
the desperation cry of an obama elector
i have twice elected president obama in the hope that change is possible .
he says that obama has made a laudable effort to address the problems of republicans ’ blockade .
the blocking policy does not excuse the site problems of obamacare , the drone attacks , the drone attacks , the drone attacks and the other side attacks .
obama ’ s memoirs of the 2008 election campaign are a sad reminder of what could have been possible .
nathaniel p. morris is a student in the second year at harvard medical school .
i am currently reading a terribly sad book .
it is a book that i thought it would help me to be able to find a way to help me during the deceptive second year of my medical studies .
it is called the audacity to win ( courage to win ) and describes the memoirs barack obama ’ s presidential election in 2008 .
when i talk to the patient in the evening and go to bed , the book will take me back to a time when politics inspired millions and gave the goddess to talk .
the election was turned into a landslide victory and news spokesmen held in order to show the historical significance of this hour .
my classmates wept with joy and my parents collected all the newspapers they could find .
a young team of visionaries was on the way to the white house and the nation was ready for change .
when obama came into office in 2008 , he had received approval ratings of 82 % .
and then i close the book .
switching back to the present is a bad awakening as if you are being torn out of a dream .
it is difficult to remember these optimistic times – they seem to be a vague memory , a sad reminder of missed opportunities .
in the years since i first voted , there has indeed been a change .
but it is simply not something i could have imagined .
i recognise the great and diverse things that obama has achieved , from adopting the afforda treaty to adopting the eu ’ s health insurance scheme to military withdrawal from the iraq war , the end of the enforced disappeared .
i agree that the partisan blockade approach is too ambitious .
but , having heard the obama administration countless times over colleagues and acquaintances , i am not happy with my attempts to explain .
i have reached a point of political despair .
republican blockade policy cannot explain why it is not possible to stop foreign heads of state intercepting or to stop the killing of innocent children by drones overseas .
it cannot explain why the national security agency has made data available on the private lives of americans and why whistleblowers , the state &apos;s misconduct , are being punished .
it cannot explain why anwar al-awlaki , an american citizen , was murdered without trial , nor why public funding and public spending programmes were closed during the presidential election .
it does not justify the results of a report which states that the white house &apos;s efforts to calm the media are the “ most aggressive ... since the nixon government . ”
recently , it cannot excuse the inability to make progress in the more than three years since the adoption of the affirmative care act , a simple website .
i do not know if that is what i should have expected .
whether i should have understood by 18 that the government ’ s work contradicts the political campaigns that preceded it .
obviously , the position of the mep is not a predictable one , since an opposition party and random events such as the newtown massacre shape public debate .
but if i look at the examples mentioned above , they seem to be largely chosen by the government itself .
and that bothers me most .
i re-elected obama in 2012 , not because i was enthusiastic about his candidacy .
mitt romney was a confusing and unsophisticated alternative , he seemed to be moving in the direction and positions he was in .
i had the impression that obama had a second term , free of pressure from future elections , would fulfil the hope that we have heard of for so long .
but , with the decline in approval values for obama to below 45 % this week , the return to 2008 by this book has become all the harder .
it awakens my longing for the many promises that have disappeared into thin air .
this week i read a section in the book that describes how obama could make a serious loss against clinton in the pennsylvania pre-election .
in a meeting with the election workers following the decision , he told his staff that they had to get back on track and follow the purpose of their cause .
“ i want us to rediscover our magic , ” he said .
we must remember who we are .
five years later , mr president , i could not give you more support .
the views expressed in this comment are exclusively those of nathaniel morris .
clive palmer claims that prime minister tony abbott has raised conflict of interest in parental leave with prime minister tony abbott .
the billionaire and member clive palmer says that prime minister tony abbott is in conflict of interest in his parental leave plans because his daughters are pregnant and could therefore benefit from them .
the mining magnat , which was found in a court dispute over the payment of $ 6 million in co2 tax , claimed that the mining magnat was wiping off the table asking whether it was in conflict .
the palmer united party could hold up to four votes in the senate , which are important for deciding whether the co2 and mining taxes should be cut or cut .
but palmer claimed that only ministers could have conflicts of interest and the daughters of abbott would benefit personally from the laws .
“ he is in a great conflict of interest when it comes to paid parental leave , because if one of his daughters becomes pregnant , he has a direct interest in whether or not she receives holidays , ” said palmer .
two months after the election , palmer ’ s electoral commission declared the election with 53 votes in the lead after the recount the official winner of the sunshine coast seat of fairfax .
palmer called for a revision of the voting count process to be carried out more quickly .
tony abbott ’ s daughters frances and bridget .
if these elections are held two months after the end of the vote ?
“ we need a better system , ” he said .
why should we not have a system in which we invade , transfer the data into a computer , immediately choose and then press the data on the table at 6.30 a.m.
palmer also criticized the use of pencils when marking ballot papers .
use them because they can then erase the results if you don &apos;t like them ?
it is incredible to vote with pens today .
the electoral commission has examined the options for an electronic election and recently adopted a joint legislative proposal with new zealand .
palmer , 59 , explained that to its policy an international airport for the sunshine coast belonged and that he had to leave his new office “ very seriously . ”
a public office is about public service .
“ we are not seeking any reward other than that of history , namely that we can serve in a critical time of this community , ” he said .
rbs suspending two foreign exchange traders
the royal bank of scotland has two traders from its foreign exchange department suspended , so two people are familiar with the situation ; this is another indication of how the bank &apos;s global regulatory inquiries are mutually supportive .
some of the world ’ s largest banks , including ubs , barclays , deutsche bank , and rbs , confirmed that they had been in contact with the authorities in the world ’ s largest financial market , with 5.3 trillion dollars a day .
the two dealers would be the first rbs employees to be suspended in the expanding investigation that followed the scandal of the libor interbank business .
the bank , which has no comment on the suspensions , confirmed this month that it will be able to receive requests for information from authorities .
“ our investigations on this subject are continuing and we are fully cooperating with the fca and other regulatory authorities , ” said the bank two weeks ago .
last month , people close to the situation indicated that the rbs would not receive the records of emails and instant messages sent by and to a former trader .
this trader , richard usher , had left rbs 2010 and is now expected to move from his current position as european head of forex spot trading at jpmorgan .
rohan ramchandani , head of the european spot trading at citi , was detained this week and matt gardiner , formerly the chief currency dealer at barclays and ubs , was awarded standard .
none of these traders were accused of any misconduct .
the instant message group of usher included bankers at barclays and citigroup , said the people close to the situation .
ubs announced this week that they have taken steps against some of their employees after the swiss regulatory authority finma declared that it had committed a alleged manipulation of the foreign exchange market in a number of swiss banks .
at least six authorities worldwide – the european commission , finma , the swiss competition authority weko , the fca , the us ministry of justice and the hong kong monetary authority – are currently engaged in accusations that are not being made .
hsbc , citigroup , jpmorgan and credit suisse have also initiated internal investigations or received information requests from authorities , said with the situation familiar persons .
banks get instant messages and emails from several years in search of cases of misconduct .
the news of these investigations has stirred up traders in an area that has become one of the most profitable of trading-units of investment firms in recent years , but this year under pressure .
some bankers have tried to play down the affair and said that it is almost impossible to avoid the vast and highly liquid financial markets that are now in the process of being exploited by leading traders .
a leading trader noted that despite the enormous daily volume of foreign exchange trading , the fragmentation of liquidity between the various trading platforms and the growing demand for own exchange services has increased by banks .
the message came out the same day , when credit suisse announced that it had sent a dealer in its london exchange traded funds office this week after he had left the bank with a loss of just under $ 6 million at the end of last year .
the bank promptly informed the competent authorities and cooperates with them .
“ we are sure that the trader has acted alone and that the matter is contained , ” said credit suisse .

in addition , it cleaned and broadened the footpath , as stated in a press release .
the planned covering of the decaying house in the back of the plot was not allowed for security reasons , because the site is threatened to slip .
alfred abel , who currently manages the property , had the beautification action with his colleague reinhard domke of the bi .
before the bi &apos;s action was a transparent with the message &quot; we are for it &quot; was given .
this disturbed the roughly 20 members of the citizens &apos; initiative , however , little in their action .
your motto on the big poster was &quot; we are against ruins of the building &quot; .
in doing so , it wanted to avoid the risk of even larger ruins on the swiss meadow - should the giant project fail one day .
in conversation with many passers-by before the construction site , it became clear that some people believe that the realisation of the city &apos;s project will be better for many , although not a few have the same questions on the dimension of the presented project .
but they are beginning to resigned because the city is further delaying these responses , the bi says .
as has been said , the public statements by the mayor are also working .
may was said at the council that he would not use the thermal bath .
some therefore seem to be quite frightened , others perceive it as a &apos; crude attempt at blackmail &apos; by the population , as the bi &apos;s press release continues .
the bi thanked the donor for the color and all the helpers .
rangnick schiris : mane no swallow king , no swallow king , no swallow king , no swallow king .
so satisfied ralf rangnick with the current high shape of bundesliga table leader red bull salzburg is also , so the sportdirector of the &quot; bulls &quot; showed disappointed by the referees .
&quot; there is a dangerous tendency at the moment that mane and alan are classified as swallowing kings , &quot; he took the two offensive whirlers at a press conference in salzburg in schutz on thursday .
the latest occasion for rangnick ’ s critique was yellow for mane at 3 : 0 against grödig last sunday , where the senegalese was given a presumed actress - but not a single .
&quot; a blatant misdecision , &quot; rangnick said , the referee harkam described as &quot; totally overstretched &quot; .
harkam would also have contributed &quot; to the escalation between salzburg coach roger schmidt and grödig trainer adi hütter after the match .
he defended his german compatriot decidedly : &quot; i would have acted in every situation as well as roger schmidt &quot; .
schmidt himself wants to be a friend of his colleague after the scharmützel .
i do not know why .
&quot; for i am the one who was insulted , &quot; the 46-year-old stressed .
in view of the success , rangnick agreed to a prayer hymn .
&quot; there are only two words for this : really good , &quot; he said .
there is not much to be said .
the way in which the team plays is particularly impressive .
that is a good thing to continue .
the winter transfer time changes will hardly be the case .
there are no great reasons to change anything .
&quot; except for a player , he or she desires to leave the club , &quot; rangnick made clear .
supreme court confirms obama ’ s health law
it is a great victory for the obama administration : the us supreme court decided today that the us was closely linked to barack obama ’ s health law .
by five votes to four , the judges ruled that the patient ’ s individual mandate was to protect and affordable care act – it forces us citizens to wait until 2014 for health insurance or to punish .
chief judge john roberts proposed to side with the four more liberal members of the chamber , while judges scalia , thomas , alito , and kennedy decided against .
the court also confirmed the remaining sections of the 2700 pages law and also represented the view that the preference for the health act , according to which states must either meet the conditions of access to medicaid or else meet all public health requirements .
the lawsuit was brought by 26 states and the national federation of independent states .
the law was signed by all leading republican presidential candidates , including the eventual challenger mitt romney , in the 2012 pre-election campaign .
norway : norway is the place where giant mirrors are illuminated with light , light , and light , and the sun is shining .
with huge mirrors , the inhabitants of a norwegian village have brought light to their dark valley .
due to the low level of sunlight the sunlight generated in the vestfjord valley is falling from autumn to spring usually in the shadow of the surrounding mountains .
with three gigantic reflectors at an altitude of 45 meters , a centuries-long dream came true on wednesday .
&apos;finally ! &apos; , mayor steinar bergsland warmed at the start ceremony in the transmitter tv2 .
some talents were using sunchairs , others used sunglasses for safety purposes .
until now , sun-hungry people had to go to a nearby summit with a cable car in winter .
ten years ago , the local artist martin andersen had proposed to turn the rays into the valley with mirrors .
however , this basic idea has existed in the village since 1913 .
after several years of debate , the city council finally approved the sek 5 million ( around eur 615 000 ) expensive project .
a similar construction has been giving the italian alpine village of viganella winter sunshine for some years .
post does not leave on sundays
&quot; many citizens will not have noticed the red points for sunday afternoon tea .
a fdp request has confirmed this .
on sundays and public holidays , only before the post office building in the ernst ludwig-straße 36 and in the jakob-müller-straße 1 in hüttenfeld are emptied .
whether in hofheim and rosengarten is also emptied sunday , the answer to the fdp ’ s question will not be answered .
the social and youth policy spokesman of the fdp , fritz rohrenbeck , wants to follow suit .
sunday cleaning is a very important post service at terminpost .
&quot; this company thinks of this despite the increase in the price of letters on january 2013 radically and unreasonable &quot; .
thomas bittner , group and city council chairman of the liberals , supports his group colleague , &apos; what annoys me is the fact that there are klammingly no longer changes or even increased periods of emptying . &apos;
the post office is a long way from the people &apos;s point of view .
&quot; at least the mail boxes in the districts of neuchâtel and rosengarten must be emptied again on sundays &quot; , says bittner and rohrenbeck unisono .
the city of the heart , too , is the case , especially not mobile citizens , with a sunday empty post box , also having to be reached by foot .
in the city parliament , rohrenbeck asked whether the city administration would plan to hold talks with the post on this matter .
mayor erich maier replied that the post did not communicate with lampertheim .
but , as he knows , there is also a sunday lesson in hofheim .
your party has argued in favour of privatisation .
&quot; then decisions are taken elsewhere , &quot; said maier .
the hotel is located in the heart of frankfurt , close to the main train station and the city centre .
the hotel is very close to the city centre and the train station .
the town ’ s magistrate is discussing a presentation this morning of the transport decorative stefan majer ( green ) .
so parking fees are to be increased by 50 percent .
but this is not about raising prices , but about reducing the time interval of parking clocks and parking ticket machines from 30 to 20 minutes .
in december , the municipal council of decrees will have to decide .
the retailer committee of ihk frankfurt considers that the &quot; is not a good idea &quot; .
the hotel was very clean and comfortable .
the verkehrsclub deutschland believes that an increase after two decades is &apos; appropriate and actually long overdue &apos; .
public transport is also becoming more expensive .
freudenstadt : fast action captivates hosts and hosts .
the men i of the tsv had to work with a narrow cadre in the schiller school gym in reutlingen against the tg gönningen from the swabian alb .
the elders were with an experienced team on the other side of the net .
soon , however , it became apparent that , even in the age of the city , they could not quite keep up with the rapid actions of the freudenstüdenstädter .
with the hard and placed surges , the patronage was extremely difficult .
they repeatedly missed the sweets of simon schenk and eduard schulz neatly over the network and were unable to resist blockade .
two high first prizes clearly demonstrated the superiority of the freudenstädter in all aspects .
in the face of this crushing and play-determining performance , the third sentence was then slightly lax and lackluster at the 3 : 0 end ( 25 : 13 , 25 : 14 , 25 : 22 ) .
the tv baiersbronn , which is in nagold , will be a much more powerful opponent on the field on november 2 .
tsv freudenstadt i : dominik bäuerle , yannik büchle , sebastian dölker , felix pälchen , stefan räller , simon schenk and eduard schulz .
in the b-class , the murgtalhalle in baiersbronn were the second teams from baiersbronn and freudenstadt .
they delivered a highly competitive two-hour match .
nervousness on both sides caused a lot of trouble and punctuation when approving the ball ; the precision of the passports was also at times scarce and in some critical game scenes prevented the over-zealous view .
in this highly balanced encounter , the tv-team of marcus blasutto voted consistently for the great physical commitment and a rewarding commitment of both teams .
the day of care at the small engländerhütte ( the engländerhütte ) mountain hut is a day of care for the children .
the first day of the treatment is now the fifth day of the natura 2000 project of upper hotzenwald .
the public &apos;s suggestions should be taken into account in the area of the hut , and civic mayor helmut kaiser said .
many hikers , he argued , described this area as the shining part of the gorge on which the landscape is the ideal setting for wonderful excursions and walks .
he thanked the present for their willingness to cooperate and stressed that the day of care is a suitable instrument for improving the connection between man and nature .
it offers every citizen the opportunity to create a special touch in nature .
at the same time , the tourist aspect could also take account of the ecological aspect .
friederike tribute was an ecological aspect of the department of the protection of nature of the fribourg government council following the welcome by landrat tilman bollacher , who was the patron of the action .
the tourist destination of the wide-view is , according to tribukait , the goal of bringing together the old allmendweidfeld with its specific protected habitat types through opening and connecting to the still existing ones .
certain species , such as rare butterflies and grass copers , can break down barriers in the form of forest land .
you need these free links to conservation .
tribukait said that she did not want to miss this place to break a lance for the planned biosphere area .
this plan does not only fit seamlessly into the current measure .
a biosphere area also offers the opportunity for sustainable economic and ecological development in the context of the internationally recognised unesco world heritage and thus a continuous development of the unesco heritage .
after these different designs , christoph wehle and life project manager divided the divisions between the two divisions .
the larger trees had already been beaten in advance , the forest trailer may be available .
a group of helpers should be concerned with the exemption of juniper bushes and the maintenance of a dry rock bar .
the aim was to have a free view at the viewpoint .
löffingen : heads are still the only candidate who can be a candidate for the first time .
internet information : although the town of löffingen , with its 7514 inhabitants , an intact infrastructure , a forward-looking school , children &apos;s , youth and seniors society , is a major part of the internet , as well .
as the only candidate to succeed the race that is no longer a candidate for age , norbert brugger is the 46-year-old bank merchant and business manager dieter köpfler from löffingen .
the application period expires on monday , 11 november at 6 p.m.
google , samsung , huawei for nortel patents sued .
the group , which has thousands of previous nortel patents , made a avalanche of complaints on thursday about patent infringement against mobile phone manufacturers , including google , the company that was not present at the insolvency increase .
rockstar , the consortium that holds the nortel patents for $ 4.5 billion , sued samsung electronics to the court of auditors .
rockstar is owned by apple , microsoft , blackberry , ericsson and sony .
google is accused of patent infringement in seven cases .
patents cover technology that uses search terms on the internet with relevant advertising .
samsung , huawei , htc and rockstar representatives were not directly accessible .
samsung , huawei and htc produce mobile phones that are compatible with google &apos;s android operating system , which is in sharp competition with mobile products from apple and microsoft .
in 2011 , google gave an initial bid of $ 900 million for the nortel patents .
google increased its offer several times and last offered 4.4 billion dollars .
after the nortel patents of rockstar outbid it , google acquired motorola mobility for 12,5 billion dollars , a deal that was also sold to some motorola &apos;s library .
“ although google failed in its attempt to ban the patent for legal action at the auction , google has infringed the patents and continues to do so , ” said the lawyer .
rockstar claims a high level of compensation from google , as it claims that google ’ s patent infringement is deliberate , so the accusation .
egypt sworn the first freely elected president
mohammed morsi is deferring the oath of office , but his day of triumph should not be the end of political disputes in egypt .
the islamist mohammed morsi promised a “ new egypt ” when he was the first freely elected president of the country , thus bringing the succession of husni mubarak to power .
with his inauguration in the supreme constitutional court , morsi was also elected the first freely elected islamist president of the arab world and egypt ’ s fifth head of state since the fall of the monarchy around 60 years ago .
he put the oath before the 18 black robes dressed judges of the court , which is located at the nile and dedicated to an ancient egyptian temple .
“ we are striving for a better future , a new egypt and a second republic , ” morsi said at the ceremony that was broadcast live on state television .
“ today , the egyptian people have laid the foundations for a new life – absolute freedom , a true democracy and stability , ” said the 60-year-old morsi , a us trained engineer and a member of the muslim brotherhood .
hundreds of soldiers and police guarded the building when morsi was in ortshire shortly after 11 o &apos;clock in a small autoconvoy .
only a few hundred supporters had gathered in court to listen to the new president , and , unlike the presidential prunk , the mubarak era was not allowed to take off for a while , so that the car could be used .
as an uncharismatic “ replacement wheel ” of the brotherhood , his personal prestige has been a source of increasing power since his victory and a friday speech , in which he has not only been a candidate for the islamists , but all .
“ egypt is now a civilian , national , constitutional , and modern state , ” the united states ’ blue suit , declared .
later morsi moved to the university of cairo , where he was supposed to make his inaugural speech .
he was officially welcomed by an army band that had played the national anthem he was in habnachtstelle .
the military leader , feldmarshall hussein tantawi , was present .
on his arrival , he was welcomed by hundreds of people present in the university ’ s largest auditorium with chorus of “ the army and the people are a hand . ”
the hotel , built in 1908 as a bastion of secular education , has grown in the 1970s to become a stronghold of islamist student writing groups .
morsi put on friday a symbolic oath on tahir-square , the birthplace of the uprising , which ended last year at the end of mubarak ’ s authoritarian rule , and he vowed power .
but , with the official oath being handed over to the court , and not , as usual , before parliament , it is bowing to the will of the military , which indicates that the power struggle will continue .
morsi ’ s speech at tahir-square was full of dramatic populist gestures .
falkenberger disco provides two great evenings for two evenings .
the new season in the falkenberg disco &quot; blue velvet &quot; has begun .
today &apos;s friday evening it &apos;s called &quot; pump this party &quot; , tomorrow saturday evening it &apos;s going to be with an ü 25 party .
fat beats and cool sounds are naturally played on both days by the organizers .
workers fell from leaders : hurt
when changing a defective outer feeling , a 51-year-old worker crashed in eggelsberg on thursday and was seriously injured .
the man from lamprechshausen wanted to make a defective heating sensing fan on the exterior of an inn .

he suffered serious injuries and was injured with the rescue helicopter &quot; christophorus 6 &quot; in the landeskrankenhaus salzburg .
rapes in south africa : two life imprisonment
nine months after the brutal rape and mutilation of a 17-year-old girl in south africa , the perpetrator was sentenced to two lifetime sentences on friday .
the sender sabc reported this .
the victim was later killed by the consequences of the severe injuries .
johannes kana was already guilty at the beginning of the week of crime .
the fact caused horror nationwide .
the then 21-year-old had anene booysen in february in an industrial site in bredasdorp near cape town .
the doctors fought for the survival of the victim for 14 hours , but in vain .
the sight of young people was so appalling that the carers and sisters needed psychological assistance .
kana admitted during the trial that he had boomed in a bar at night .
he also confessed to beaten and raped them , but he denied to pay for the death of the girl .
the police had initially assumed several offenders , but dismissed two suspects from prison because the evidence against them was not sufficient .
the prosecutor also stressed during the trial that it was convinced that kana was not able to do anything at the time of the attack .
rape is almost a daily occurrence in south africa : there are around 64 000 indications of sexual violence every year .
that is almost ten times the figure in germany , but it is a lot more populated than south africa ( 50 million ) , with 82 million people .
police and women &apos;s associations in south africa estimate the number of people in the event of sexual violence to be 10-25 times .
jumbo visits the black forest ham , ham , and the red sea .
jumbo looking for the &quot; best ham of the world &quot; : for the tv show &quot; galileo &quot; visited the pro7-star bonndorf .
the speaker makes it clear at the outset that the most important thing for ham is the pig culls , turbomast is not a good precondition .
can ham that you can get in any supermarket , i.e. be a quality product ?
uli , the head of the large ham factory in the black forest , explains how jumbo works with the company &quot; adler &quot; in bonndorf .
&quot; germany &apos;s favourite ham &quot; , as jumbo wrote about the black forest ham .
only with hair protection and kittel he comes into the interior of the factory .
jumbo must also disinfect the hands before he can go to the microphone .
jumbo for strengthening fast bite in waldshut sighted , the sickening of the bite in forest shut .
&quot; i &apos;m working on a lot of things here , &quot; the tv makers , black forest ham as a bulk product are astonished .
16,000 keulen per week speak for themselves .
weight , fat content , color : uli explains what quality is all about .
most pigs are slaughtered at six months .
television with level ?
details such as ph value of the meat play a role .
the darker the meat , the higher the ph value .
&quot; i am curious if your roberto blanco measures what happens then &quot; , jumbo zynisch says .
this is where the level of private television is presented in pure culture .
but watching is worth watching .
the spectator sees that the disassembly of the culls is still hand-crafted .
because black forests ham is traditionally available on the shelf without bones .
the secret of ham is the spicy mixture with salt .
smoke tower and smoke fire remind jumbo visually of a &quot; submarine &quot; .
the trick : fir branches provide the special flavor of black forest ham in the smoke .
20 days in the smoke make the ham almost black .
&quot; now the disc disappears in jumbo , &quot; he announces the test feeding .
&quot; he &apos;s really delicious &quot; , according to the conclusion of the tv star .
this will allow all parties to live with it .
they thought that travel agencies are a thing of the past thanks to the internet ?
flight centre seems to be resisting the trend .
the company has increased its profit prospects for the year as a whole and expects record income from holidaymakers in australia and the uk .
the travel company now expects a adjusted annual profit before taxes between 325 and 340 million dollars , compared to 305 to 315 million dollars in its earlier forecast .
if the current targets are met , that will mean growth of 12 to 17 % compared to the record gain of 290.4 million dollars in the period 2011 / 12 .
as managing director graham turner announced , flight centre achieved eight percent profit in the first half of the year and a strong start in the second half , especially in australia and the uk .
“ since the beginning of the year , our ten countries have been profitable , and some of them are well on track to record annual revenues before interest and taxes , ” he said .
these include australia and the united kingdom , which are typically among our strongest earners .
in australia , the leisure industry has recovered in the second half of the year , which is a slightly weaker business travel market .
it was similarly good for the leisure business of flight centre in the uk , while business customers were spending less here as well .
the us business recovered from its weaker first half year in season-related terms , and thus generated a gain for the full year for the third consecutive year .
the shares of flight centre rose by 3 cents to $ 38.20 yesterday .
schools will focus more on mathematics , spelling , and grammar .
in courses on english literature , pupils will have to learn at least one piece of shakespeare , a novel of the nineteenth century , romantic lyrics and contemporary british novels from 1914 .
the test also includes “ unseen texts ” to help read more widely .
the combined course of english literature and language is abolished .
from 2015 , students will have to submit a separate gcse test for language , with strong incentives to use english literature as a separate qualification .
the ministry of education will tomorrow present the new curricula for english and mathematics – the first subjects that have been radically redesigned .
other core subjects will be changed next year .
in a separate initiative , ofqual , the auditing authority , will propose a reorganisation of the gcse structures , including a new benotation system and less exchange rate work .
in a summer speech , education minister michael gove said that there is a “ broad consensus that we need to reform our audit system to restore public confidence , ” emphasising that the g-cc ’ s “ exit from the cold . ”
studies show that english schools have less time for mathematics – 116 hours per year or three hours a week per school year – than most other countries .
by contrast , australian schools teach an average of 143 hours a year and students in singapore receive 138 hours .
although there will be no formal requirement to spend more time on mathematics in the timetable , coalition members will not be able to use the comprehensive mathematics test , combined with a stronger weighting of the subject .
the curriculum focuses more on “ real life problems ” , including financial mathematics .

salem : johanna rahner at the ecumenical forum of talks in the ecumenical forum of the ecumenical forum of the world of dialogue in the ecumenical forum of the ecumenical dialogue .
the next ecumenical forum on monday 21 october in the new museum of the castle is about the topic &quot; hell with hell - theological considerations on how to deal with the last things &quot; .
professor is professor johanna rahner .
the ecumenical forum is an initiative of the catholic and evangelical church communities of salem , the castle of salem and the kulturamtes bodenseekreis .
johanna rahner wants to discuss in the forum the question of how people can now see the &quot; last things &quot; after death .
if people had benefited too much from this in the past centuries , and had been put on the images of heaven and hell , &apos; which are still our ideas &apos; , contemporary prophetic teaching is characterized by the teachings of the people .
&quot; the greater hope is christians through the critique of religion , sufficiently exalted , &quot; says the speaker .
you have provided us with so many question marks that the exclamation signs have been lost to us .
johanna rahner continues to say : &quot; but the crucial challenge remains the anger of death &quot; .
this raises the question of the longing for &apos; dreaming that everything should be good in the end &apos; .
johanna rahner , born in baden-baden in 1962 , studied catholic theology and biology at the albert ludwigs-university freiburg from 1982 to 1989 .
she received her doctorate in 1997 as dr. theol . , also in freiburg .
the habilitation of fundamentals theology and ecumenical theology followed in 2003 at the westphalian wilhelms university .
since 2010 , johanna rahner has held a chair of systematic theology at the institute of catholic theology of the university of kassel .

illmensee : second mountain bike race enthuses participants in the mountain bike race and enthuses participants in the second mountain bike race .
in good weather 214 cyclists came to illmensee to complete the tour across the hills around the lake .
this will inform ulrich knobel of the organising sports club illmensee .
among the participants were , especially at short distance of more than 15 kilometers and 300 meters of altitude , numerous jedermannsraders who once used their hobby in competition atmosphere .
two german junior drivers were in this race as well : felix bader from bad waldsee and pascal treubel from asach-linz came with the recommendation to have a good place at the german championships .
these two could , as expected , move away from the field .
as in the previous year , felix bader was able to save a small time lead to the finish and defended his title as a total winner of short distance .
in second place , pascal was again able to play trusteeship .
the ladies were theresa duelli of team nightmare , who made it to the top of the winning stadium .
in second and third place anne adel from illmensee and leonie drivers from owingen .
one positive development is the increasing number of drivers who are living in the community or working .
not only in terms of performance , the range of athletes was represented .
the age structure was also sufficient for the youngest to over 70 years among the oldest starters .
in the main race this year there were even more top athletes .
four drivers were able to leave the regional champions .
among them philipp pangerl , a semi-professional mountain bike from the black tusk racing team .
pangerl and a team member have already been world champions for the 12-hour race .
this year he became european champion in this special discipline .
roland ballerstedt , who has won two german titles in the duathlon , also played his part in this .
after 45 kilometres and 900 metres of altitude , the final of the eye-catching final in the final round in front of the three-lake halle was reached .
pangerl was the first to hit the finish line .
only a second behind it , the routine ballerstedt won second place in the overall race .
at the same time , hermann and warthmann were the third to win the overall prize .
in the ladies &apos; ranking , christian cohsmann was the fastest in the main race .
the second place was in the second place , areane blersch from bindings in front of natascha werner from stuttgart .
athletes and helpers were very pleased with the smooth and well-organised running of the event .
on the way through mud , rivers and jungles for free medical care , and through mud , rivers and jungles for free
dr. georges bwelle provides free medical assistance to remote villages in cameroon , cameroon , and other parts of the country .
bwave and his team spend almost every weekend treating hundreds of patients , and are doing so almost every weekend .
in the west african country , there are not many doctors , only one for 5,000 people , but one for 5,000 people .
please contact us here or with your mobile phone .
dr. georges bwelle is one of the top 10 of the “ cnn heroes of 2013 ” .
you can choose to play for him or any of the other heroes in the top 10 to call him the “ cnn hero of the year ” .
the winner receives $ 250,000 to continue his exceptional work .
for 21 years , georges bwelle was watching his sick father lose consciousness and go to hospitals that were not able to provide the necessary resources to help him .
jamef bwelle was born in 1981 in a car accident near yaoundé , the capital of cameroon .
at first he had only a broken arm , but then an inflammation formed which spread to his brain .
“ there were no neurosurgeons in cameroon , ” says georges bwelle .
we should have got him out of cameroon if we had had the money .
instead , bwelle spent years relocating his father to overcrowded clinics and hospitals to improve treatment there , which she had to offer .
“ it is not easy , ” comments bwave .
the hotel is very clean and the staff is very friendly and helpful .
there are a great many patients .
some people are even dying because they have to wait .
the situation has hardly changed since bwelle &apos;s father died in 2002 .
in cameroon , there is only one doctor for every 5 000 people , according to the world health organisation .
in contrast , the relationship in the united states is with a doctor for 413 people .
but even if there was a doctor for them , most cameramen could not afford to visit .
two out of five people in the country live below the poverty line and almost three-quarters of health spending in the country is private .
“ the only problem they have is poverty , ” says bwelle .
and poverty makes it impossible to enjoy life .
his father and so many of his compatriots suffered to see in bwelle the decision to do something about it .
dr. georges bwelle and his volunteer team have carried out 700 free operations last year .
he became a doctor and works as a vascular surgeon in the central hospital in yaoundé .
he also founded a non-profit organization called ascovime , which was involved in weekends in rural areas and offered free medical care there .
since 2008 , he and his volunteer group have helped nearly 32,000 people .
almost every friday he and up to 30 people are forced to travel in minibuses and drive with the straightforward medical equipment on the roof over unpaved terrain to the villages that need help .
not always things go smoothly .
more than once they had to push the vehicles through rivers and mud .
but when they arrive , they are received like heroes : a feast , singing , and dance , and the best accommodation the place has to offer .
in these villages , free medical care is really a reason to celebrate and bwelle – with its wide smile and its boundless energy – is happy to be part of the happy celebration .
the next morning , the team starts to investigate hundreds of patients .
“ we treat 500 people per journey ” , says bwelle .
they come from a radius of 60 kilometres around the village – and that on foot .
each of these weekend clinics offers medical care in a number of areas .
many people are being held hostage for malaria , tuberculosis , malnutrition , diabetes , parasites and sexually transmitted diseases .
others receive crutches , donated glasses or free birth certificates – a document that is required for school , but which many poor families simply cannot afford .
in the evening , the team conducts simple operations with local anaesthesia .
the operations usually take place in a school , town hall or apartment ; after the operation , patients are on and go to the rest area to make room for the child .
the lighting for the op and the disinfection equipment is provided by the group generator and so bwave and its voluntary work up to the early morning hours of sunday .
it is a demanding task , but the village musicians usually help to bring the team to work .
“ they are drumming all night so that we can wake up and continue our work , ” says bwelle .
on sunday the team will return to the city , tired but proud of the work done .
the group – a mixture of cameroon doctors and foreign medical students – has carried out 700 free operations last year and knows that their work has made a huge difference for the people to whom it helps .
a man explained that the free operation of a leg break he received now allows him to return to work .
“ this changes the future of my family , ” the man said .
in addition to weekend clinics and his work as surgeon in the hospital , bwelle also works in private clinics in yaoundé at night .
with this second job he will finance 60 % of his non-profit activities , so bwelle ; the rest come from private donations .
“ i really do not know when he is sleeping , ” says katie o &apos;malley , who will be attending drexel university in philadelphia medicine for the second year and volunteered in bwelles .
he is always either in hospital or trying to raise money for the organization so that he can go to these campaigns .
for medical and nursing students such as o &apos;malley , who come from the usa and europe and support bwelle , this is an opportunity to gain practical experience that they never would have at home .
“ we can be there to help in operations where we can help to collect blood or use the instruments for dr bwelle , ” explains o &apos;malley .
that would be a medical student in america in the second year .
students usually pay for their trip to cameroon themselves and bring frequently donated sanitary material .
but once you have arrived in yaoundé , bwelle will take care of the accommodation , transportation and instruction .
“ he is undoubtedly a hero , ” says o &apos;malley .
he devotes his life to this organisation and his desire to help the cameroon people know no borders .
for bwelle , the almost constant work is not a burden .
to make others happy and to make a promise to do so that he can deliver to his father is a great pleasure .
“ i am so happy to do this work , ” says bwelle .
and i am thinking of my father .
i hope he will see what i do .
i do it to make people laugh again and to relieve the pain .

excellent fighting ,
the role of santiago , the old man in hemingway &apos;s novelle &quot; the old man and the sea &quot; , is horst janson cut to the body .
janson is himself an old hare in his profession of acting .
the old man santiago cannot be deceived by fishing .
the two are perfectly complementary .
it is almost thought that the wrinkles in the neck of the old man , of which the fishing boy speaks manolo , can be seen .
when santiago is tired of life , sitting on the chair , janson echt is .
the role of the old fisherman is also a character role that janson plays most excellently .
hemingway told the story of a fighter , a courageous man who does not give up and who ultimately , through his knowledge and also his will , wins the fight against fish .
janson was a single actor on stage in many parts of the show .
he manages to attract the attention of the audience , so that his monolics do not have a moment boring .
his efforts to finally bring the fish to the surface of the water are so real that the viewers forget that the sea is only made of blue illuminated water bottles .
director jens hasselmann leaves the old man on the boat in front of the fishing village .
during the performance he puts the active scene in the light : the refuge of santiago , the bar of singer marie-luise gunst , the bar with her songs and her wonderful voice .
the four musicians play cuba ’ s rhythm and are also guests of the bar .
tourism : descent to the romans
the city of cologne is a sewage channel from the roman era , which is approximately 120 metres long .
if you visit cologne , you will not miss the cathedral .
the two towers rise to the sky about 157 meters and make it the second highest church building in europe .
but few visitors who visit the two filigree church towers have a sense that there is a great variety of interesting places to visit under the cathedral .
rainer schulze is an expert in the field of cologne .
the meeting point for his guided tours is the service centre of cologne tourism directly at the cathedral .
the tour starts in a very unspectacular way : &quot; we start in the underground garage &quot; , says schulze .
in the 1970s , the town fathers wanted a car city , and so the remains of the old city walls were only what the city was not too big .
most users of the multi-storey car park therefore rush past the roman remains and only leave their cars .
but those who look more closely will find a metal glitter in the parking deck d2 .
the ruins of the island are about five metres high , made of hand-made stones .
&quot; there are remains of the roman city wall , which was built in the second half of the first century after christ , &quot; schulze tells .
before it goes back to the daylight , schulze leaves the participants at the upper level of the park to take a look at a dark , 15 metres deep shaft .
this is the well of the old cathedral , which is unfortunately hardly noticed .
the next station of the tour is the pretorium , and here the participants descend into the depth again .
we are witnessing the official seat of the once most powerful man north of the alps , the precursor of the ccaa .
what ccaa means is for a visitor to know .
&quot; the abbreviation stands for &quot; colonia claudia ara agrippinensium &quot; , which in good german means &quot; city of roman right and city of agrippinenser , founded under emperor kaisereus .
and the pretorium is the former statutory palace , the center of power of the roman empire on the rhine .
from the hall of the exhibition , there is a tunnel access to the roman sewage channel , which is preserved here on about 120 meters length .
&quot; you can easily find a piece along the so-called cloaca maxima if you want , &quot; says schulze the guests .
schulze still has a surprise .
after he had picked the key at the checkout desk , he leads the group to a 16 metre deep walkable shaft .
&quot; we are now in the mikwe , a ritual jewish bath , &quot; he explains .
the jewish community built its bath deep into the ground to get to the groundwater , which is essential for ritual washing .
to this day , at the bottom of the mikwe , whose origins date back to the eighth century , different water levels have been readable through varying levels of the rhine .
mikwe is part of an archaeological zone on the town hall square , for which construction work is to begin shortly .
however , a few years will go by before completion .
leg almost hacked : rerun of rocker process .
a bloody attack in the rockermilieu is rerolled after more than four years .
a trial for attempted death , dangerous injury and material damage against two thirty years old has taken place in the district court in frankfurt ( oder ) .
it is accompanied by strict security measures .
the defendants remain silent as a prelude .
they were supposed to have been active in the rocker scene and then belonged to the bandidos .
the prosecutor accuses them of having , in june 2009 , been working with unknown accomplices in finowfurt on three men in a car and stepping in .
all the victims were seriously injured , a man almost lost his leg .
the victims are to be angels &apos; competing group .
one is to have been a high-level member from berlin .
it seems that there was a chase with several cars .
the indictment was about battles of the region and a demonstration of power .
the two defendants were released in a first trial in early 2012 .
a court spokesman said at the time that it was not possible to prove that men were actually involved in the bloody feud .
the perpetrators had carried masks and had not been recognized .
the federal court of justice voiced the judgment after the court &apos;s review and referred it to the country court for further negotiation .
one of the defendants is currently in the open for another offence .
the first was the reconstruction of the processes in the facade of tatnacht .
as a witness , the commissioner who was investigating at the time was invited .
the centre was mobile phone calls from the defendants and other people who had listened to the police .
it is difficult that rockers in court almost always adhere to a law that they have ehrend - and not statements .
this also applies to the victims .
in the first process , only one of the victims had caught up .
prosecutor stefan golfier of the public prosecutor , frankfurt ( or ) said on demand that new spheres have appeared since the last trial .
eleven other days of negotiations have been set for the process .
the disposable company does not think
the night was long , the music loud and the mood good , but at some point it goes home .
but in the people ’ s bellies on the front-passenger and rear seat , hunger is noticeable .
of course , some cocktails or sparkling wine may be responsible for this !
what could be more obvious than chilling for the next drive-in to get a little bit of something ?
i admit that i am happy to be with you when there is a late night or early morning fastfood pick .
a few pommes , a cola , a burger - and then nix like home and in bed !
but , on the way home , the obvious differences between me and other hungry disco goers are noticeable .
what is missing , that you can always use your fastfood bag ?
the hotel is located in a quiet area , close to the city centre and the main shopping street .
&quot; why ? &quot; i wonder .
are people too doof to take the bags home with respect until the next dustbin ?
it is not just the paper industry that spills the landscape .
bags have also been used to cover traffic facilities such as control panels , causing accidents .
about so what thinks said &quot; disposable society &quot; but does not reflect , probably does not even know what that word actually means .
the hotel is located in a quiet area , but is very close to the city centre .
a few bags would be more or less like a nix - unlike the street where no one is on the food residues of other trumps .
i can see the day when the people of the cities and the municipalities are being left to fade - and fastfood chains are being thrown in for their bags .
obama ’ s health policy backtracking
after a lot of criticism , president obama yesterday backtracking on his frequently repeated , unequivocal promise : “ if you like your health insurance , you can keep it . ”
after hundreds of thousands of insurers received a letter of cancellation , the republicans threw a spell on the president in recent days to the effect that he misled the american public .
yesterday , obama put his original promise into perspective .
“ the vast majority of citizens who have a functioning health insurance can keep it , ” he said in a speech in boston .
in response to the numerous media reports on the redundancies , obama called on the americans who received such communications to be able to find a new insurance in the free market .
most citizens could thus benefit from better , more comprehensive health insurance at the same price or less than forecast .
“ they come up with a better offer , ” he said .
the government was not surprised that the five percent of the population , which had insurance cover , had to look for another fare .
“ i would like to say to these americans quite directly : they deserve better , ” said sebelius at a hearing before the european parliament ’ s energy and trade committee in washington .
sebelius , who is responsible for implementing the affirmative care act , explained that the launch of the online platform has been “ miserabel ” since october .
“ i am as frustrated and angry as anyone else , ” she said .
i am determined to regain your confidence .
this expression of an excited sebelius to a behind her assistant at yesterday &apos;s hearing in the representative house was made after a dispute with the republican mep billy long .
after more than three hours of hearing , long sebelius repeatedly clashed with the question of why the “ architect ” of the affordable care act was not willing to respond to a state-sponsored insurance policy .
government in jerusalem confirms attack on syrian air base not only confirms attack on syrian air base but also confirms the attack on syrian air base .
an american government official who wanted to remain anonymous has made a statement to the american news channel cnn on thursday that israeli fighters are not allowed to enter the country one day before .
the aim is to &quot; missiles and related equipment &quot; , of which the israeli government feared that it was not responsible for the lebanese hezbollah , was it said , according to cnn .
syrian and lebanese media , as well as the arab channel al-arabiya , had previously reported that the base in the port city of latakia was closed on wednesday night , from wednesday to thursday , and the israeli government had .
the israeli television channel channel channel channel 2 showed satellite images of the base in latakia , where russian defense missiles of the type s-125 newa and a battery of sa-3 missiles were deployed .
insecure the government in jerusalem has not officially confirmed the attack .
however , the news agency reuters quotes an equally anonymous israeli government official saying that he believes israel can stop the attack , whether it is safe or not .
a spokesman for the israeli ministry of defence said , &apos; we are not commenting on these reports &apos; .
the journalist ron ben-yishai stressed in the daily yedioth ahronoth that the syrian regime had already been in power , sometimes successfully , in trying to use ground air missiles in the past .
the israeli government has repeatedly warned that any attempt by syria to retreat hezbollah with chemical or other dangerous weapons would be a serious threat to the crossing of a &apos; red line &apos; .
john kerry explains in an unprecedented acknowledgement that the us espionage is “ inappropriate to go too far ” .
john kerry suggested an unexpected admission of a softening of the defensive attitude of the us in its surveillance programs .
the foreign minister also admitted that he , together with barack obama , would be responsible for pushing for “ autopilot ” when the explosive devestations of the whistleblower were uncovered .
the leaked information has left the us government in a diplomatic storm of indignation from its allies .
in a video call to the open government conference in london , kerry said , “ there is no question that the president and i , as well as others in the government , have learned of some things that are virtually autopilot .
he was then the first senior member of the us government to admit that the us espionage had crossed a border , but he also stressed that no rights had been abused .
he said , ‘ in some cases this has gone unreasonably too far . ’
the president is determined to create clarity , and is therefore conducting a thorough investigation so that no one has to feel that abuse is taking place here .
i assure you that the rights of innocent people will not be affected in this process .
but kerry insisted that the nsa was a force of good , and that its surveillance operations saved many lives .
he added : “ we are dealing with a new world in which people are prepared to live in the air themselves , ” he said .
there is radical extremism in the world that is obsessed with killing people , invading the air , and destroying governments .
so what if one were able to catch up and stop this before it happens ?
we have indeed seen aircraft crashes , attacks on buildings and the murder of people because we are still not ready to do so .
meanwhile , us legislators will travel to europe to address concerns about america ’ s supposed espionage , and to convince europeans of the need to make progress in the anti-terrorism effort .
senator chris murphy from connecticut said he had met representatives of the european parliament and other people this week and was concerned about their threats to move on to the european parliament because of frustration with the monitoring agency .
“ it is very important for us national security interests that europeans should be more flexible in our joint efforts to combat terrorism . ”
i also go to europe to make it clear that we must continue to work together in the fight against terrorism , regardless of their anger over the nsa programmes .
media reports that the nsa collects millions of telephone data in europe have strengthened relations with some us allies , although the us head of the intelligence service has declared this week that the reports are incorrect and based on a set of principles .
other revelations cited from the documents passed on by snowden , according to which the nsa was used by chancellor angela merkel and up to 34 other heads of state worldwide .
the head of the national intelligence services , james clapper , defended espionage among allies as necessary and declared that this was common on both sides .
in all this turmoil , murphy said that his authority was preparing the congress ’ s trip , which is due to take place this year , and hoped that the delegation would include members from both parties and chambers .
the names of the other participating members are to be published in the coming days .
he said that the exact route is still being worked out .
while murphy stressed that the purpose of the journey was to improve relations , he also said that there were some “ serious words . ”
he said that european governments should be honest with their people about the type of spy programmes they have been using for years .
“ while we can change our surveillance programs , thus protecting europeans ’ rights better , they must also be able to accept the fact that we are not the only ones to spy ” , murphy says .
meanwhile , john kerry will be on a weekend trip to the middle east and poland to meet the resentment of the us strategy in syria , egypt , and iran , as well as the us surveillance activities .

australian has appealed against prison sentences in thailand
a 21-year-old sydney woman who had been imprisoned in phuket for falsely carrying out allegations of a taxi-driver raped her .
stevie rochelle bamford was first tried by a provincial court in phuket on 15 june , to make a false statement that had not been accepted by the thai police .
later , however , the video camera &apos;s photographs showed that she had safely entered her hotel after she was separated from her australian friend .
the police in phuket interrogated bamford for two days until they confessed to have conceived history .
until the trial , she was in police custody on the ground .
bamford was sentenced to 15 days &apos; imprisonment in a low-level prison unit on the fringe of phuket , instead of being held in prison for adults .
she is the daughter of peter tunks , a former player of the australian rubgy league who addressed the foreign ministry in canberra asking for help for his daughter .
tunks declared to the sunday telegraph in sydney that the whole family was “ extremely concerned ” about the well-being of his daughter and wanted to have her back in australia .
“ we are naturally very concerned , but we hope that you will come back home as soon as possible , ” said tunks .
bamford appealed against the judgment and is not liable for a deposit of 50,000 baht .
australian reports have said that they have been in the meantime staying in the krabi resort in southern thailand .
the court has said that bamford is being replaced by a local lawyer in phuket , and that he has been warned that the appeal will also be used to impose a higher sentence of up to two years in prison .
however , it is also possible that thailand will be able to remain in the united states after the recent murder of the tourist clerk michelle smith in phuket .
