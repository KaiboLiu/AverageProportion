gu@@ t@@ ach : even more safety for pede@@ stri@@ ans
you are not 100 metres apart : on tuesday , the new b 3@@ 3-@@ pede@@ strian traffic light is opened in gu@@ t@@ ach at the village parking lot - within the view of the older town hall lights .
two plants so close to each other : intention or tur@@ n@@ sti@@ le ?
this question was clearly answered yesterday by gu@@ t@@ ach@@ s may@@ or .
&quot; the city hall temple was installed at the time because it sec@@ ures the school path , &quot; ec@@ ker@@ t explained yesterday .
the k@@ lu@@ ser@@ -@@ light traffic light is a safe place for cy@@ cli@@ sts , bus passengers and mountain residents .
the plant officially put into operation yesterday is important for the cros@@ s@@ roads of sul@@ z@@ b@@ ach@@ we@@ g / kir@@ ch@@ stra@@ ß@@ e .
we have the museum , two churches , spa park , the bus stop , a doctor and a bank as well as the flow of traffic from the residential area › gru@@ b ‹ .
&quot; the high traffic and pede@@ strian traffic had to add another traffic light to their safety &quot; , ec@@ ker@@ t says .
peter ar@@ no@@ ld of the off@@ enburg council office confir@@ ms this .
&quot; according to current measure@@ ments , the b 33 trans@@ ports approximately 12 000 vehicles daily to the municip@@ ality of gu@@ t@@ ach , of which around 10 % are heavy goods vehicles , &quot; ar@@ no@@ ld points out .
therefore , the construction of another traffic light is more than necessary : &apos; safety is just the way forward &apos; , ar@@ no@@ ld says .
in total , four transport shows had been carried out , and a circle of traffic was also planned , but because of the close in the kre@@ u@@ z@@ b@@ ach@@ we@@ g / kir@@ ch@@ stra@@ ß@@ e inter@@ section .
according to ar@@ no@@ ld , the traffic light po@@ les had been tested out before : &quot; with an extra for us with particularly long tr@@ un@@ ks of lo@@ ad@@ -@@ bearing tr@@ un@@ ks , we tested whether these vehicles were taken from the sul@@ z@@ base .
the traffic light system itself , which costs around eur 15 000 , is the &apos; most modern thing currently available on the market &apos; , explained ar@@ no@@ ld .
the complex is equipped with col@@ oured le@@ ds , which are so bright that the lights are shi@@ fted from the drivers , for example , even in the low sun .
and it is also econom@@ ical : the older lighting systems use about 100 wat@@ ts , the new just eight wat@@ ts .
there are three light systems per direction .
ar@@ no@@ ld explained the technique of the new plant : this is equipped with two rad@@ ar sen@@ sors .
if the pede@@ strian pus@@ hes the traffic light , the upper rad@@ ar sensor will test the traffic situation .
if the road is free , it will immediately green for the pede@@ strian , if not , it will take about 15 seconds .
another rad@@ ar sensor checks whether the green phase for the pede@@ strian can be completed .
&quot; should a group or disabled people go by road , the green phase will be extended , so everyone will be safe on the road , &quot; ar@@ no@@ ld said .
of course , the driver must think along the road as a partner and observe the driving path .
this was not the case yesterday : the traffic lights for pede@@ stri@@ ans showed green , a class car r@@ ash@@ ed through - at sh@@ ining red .
jo@@ se@@ f win@@ k@@ ler has been writing for more than 30 years the p@@ light of his child@@ hood and youth .
the disasters of his catho@@ lic village child@@ hood - the lack of voice , the tend@@ ency to raw violence and bl@@ un@@ t sex@@ u@@ ality , the clo@@ sen@@ ess and the lack of joy - have made the car@@ in@@ th@@ ian po@@ et more frequent .
the b@@ ü@@ ch@@ ner prize winner is known primarily as pro@@ sa@@ author , theatre texts are in his ra@@ r work .
coll@@ age from pro@@ sa@@ tex@@ tes ger@@ hard fres@@ ach@@ er presents for his performance &quot; weather lights on the ton@@ gue &quot; , which is now in garage x at st. peter &apos;s square , therefore a col@@ l@@ age from pro@@ sa@@ tex@@ er .
the theatre maker combines elements from the auto@@ bio@@ graphical novel &quot; the be@@ i@@ gen@@ e &quot; ( 198@@ 7 ) with pro@@ sam@@ ini@@ atures from &quot; le@@ ich@@ nam , his family be@@ wit@@ ched &quot; ( 2003 ) .
on the largely empty stage - important requirement : a cr@@ um@@ bling bu@@ ck@@ led sof@@ a , on which there is a h@@ int of cop@@ ulation and ma@@ st@@ ur@@ b@@ ation - han@@ gs the eigh@@ t-@@ head .
director fres@@ ach@@ er seems to have little faith in the text .
the 7@@ 0-@@ minute performance is a perfect addition to the template with a wealth of government in@@ jur@@ ies known from the reper@@ to@@ ire of post-@@ dramatic forms of play .
the ac@@ t@@ res@@ ses in particular are the most important actors in the sometimes question@@ able scen@@ ic trans@@ positions .
they are har@@ d-@@ hit , di@@ pped with their heads under water , with their d@@ ust ta@@ pped to the wall .
im@@ pre@@ gnated with cel@@ lo@@ ph@@ ane or bo@@ d@@ ice , they st@@ ack on danger@@ ously high stic@@ ks through the st@@ aging , either mono@@ logi@@ ze lou@@ dly or lie completely silent on the stage floor .
the text , however , is hardly conve@@ yed in this har@@ d-@@ hit@@ ting way .
the best moments has the evening when sung - the band@@ width ran@@ ges from deep pur@@ ple to fol@@ k music .
the over@@ shot performance is only a little calm towards the end , and win@@ k@@ ler ’ s down@@ right absur@@ d hum@@ or is striking .
a black@@ box in the car ?
us road pl@@ ann@@ ers are looking for a source of money to stop the dec@@ lining high@@ way system , and do they believe the solution in a small black box to be found in the fit@@ ting box ?
the equipment that records every kil@@ ome@@ tre of operation and reports the information to the authorities is at the heart of a controversial attempt by washington and the planning offices of the states to disman@@ tle the ob@@ sole@@ te system for financing us roads .
the usually bor@@ ing area of road planning suddenly has a intense debate with colour@@ ful al@@ li@@ ances .
liber@@ tari@@ ans have al@@ lied with environmental groups and are argu@@ ing that the government should use the small boxes to record the kilometres travell@@ ed – and possibly even where they were driven – and then use the information for calcul@@ ating tax .
the tea party is hor@@ ri@@ fied .
the american civil rights association ( ac@@ l@@ u ) is also deeply concerned and expres@@ ses a number of data protection concerns .
but , while congress cannot agree on a course of action , several states are no longer waiting .
they are currently exam@@ ining how they can switch to a system over the next ten years where drivers pay for each m@@ ile they fly .
thousands of drivers have used tac@@ ho@@ graph@@ s , some of which are g@@ ps surveillance .
this is really a must for our country .
“ it is not something we will only possibly use , ” said has@@ an i@@ kh@@ r@@ ata , managing director of the southern california as@@ n@@ n , of governments that have a record of the risks .
the way we pay these taxes will change .
the technology is there .
the initiative comes at a time when the highway trust fund , financed from taxes , is killing the americans at the ta@@ p .
but in america , the tan@@ k is no longer as much tan@@ k as it used to be .
cars use less petro@@ l .
the government min@@ eral oil tax of 18@@ .@@ 4 c@@ ents per gall@@ on ( less than 4 c@@ ents per lit@@ re ) has not increased for 20 years .
politicians do not d@@ are to raise taxes even by a cent at high fuel prices .
“ the gas@@ ol@@ ine tax is simply not sustainable , ” says le@@ e mun@@ n@@ ich , an expert on transport legislation at the university of min@@ n@@ es@@ ot@@ a .
his state recently sold 500 cars with tac@@ ho@@ graph@@ s to collect a mil@@ est@@ one payment system .
“ this is the most sensible option in the long run , ” he said .
bureaucr@@ ats call it m@@ ile based user fees .
it is not surprising that the idea has received popular support from urban liber@@ als , because the tax could be used , for example , to influence driving behaviour in such a way that cong@@ es@@ tion and emissions that are harmful to the climate are reduced .
california ’ s pl@@ ann@@ ers rely on the system to develop strategies that address the ambitious , legally an@@ cho@@ red goals of the federal state on climate change .
but republic@@ an bill shu@@ ster from pen@@ n@@ sy@@ l@@ v@@ ania , chairman of the house transportation committee , also declared that the country would not accept the most viable long-term alternative .
the free marke@@ ters of the reason foundation are also inspired by the idea of re@@ loc@@ ating drivers after a long distance .
“ this is not a tax that dis@@ appears in a black hole , ” explains adri@@ an mo@@ ore , vice president of reason guidelines .
people pay directly for what they get .
the movement is also supported by two former american transport ministers who , in a report in 2011 , called on congress to move toward m@@ il@@ -based accounting .
last year , the us sen@@ ate approved a $ 90 million pilot project , which would have included 10@@ ,000 cars .
but the majority in the house of representatives prevented the push , respon@@ ding to the concerns of rural m@@ ps who represent people who are living often in many miles on the road to work or in the city in everyday life .
several states and cities are nevertheless moving in their own direction .
o@@ reg@@ on , currently holding 5@@ ,000 drivers for the largest experim@@ ent in the country , is the most committed .
these drivers will soon be paying mil@@ e@@ age fees instead of the min@@ eral oil tax to the federal state .
ne@@ v@@ ada has already completed a pilot project .
new york city is also considering such a thing .
il@@ lin@@ o@@ is is testing it to a limited extent with tr@@ uc@@ ks .
and the i-@@ 95 coalition , to which the transport mini@@ stri@@ es of 17 states on the east coast belong ( including mar@@ y@@ land , pen@@ n@@ sy@@ l@@ v@@ ania , vir@@ g@@ ini@@ a and fl@@ ori@@ da ) , is currently investig@@ ating the change .
the concept is not a universal hit .
in ne@@ v@@ ada , where 50 volunte@@ ers have recently been equipped with the equipment , drivers were s@@ cep@@ tical about the idea that the government could follow any of its movements .
“ concerns about big brother and such things were a big problem , ” al@@ aud@@ din kh@@ an , head of strategy and result management in the ministry of transport , explains .
people did not want it .
when the test was running , the ac@@ l@@ u war@@ ned of ne@@ v@@ ada on their website : “ it would be relatively easy to convert the tac@@ ho@@ graph into full-@@ grown surveillance devices . ”
there is no need to create a gi@@ gan@@ tic , bul@@ ky technological infrastructure that inevitably uses to create a data base on the daily movements of individuals .
ne@@ v@@ ada is part of a number of states that are now looking for affordable technology that will allow the state to travel the kilometres travell@@ ed , but not exactly when and where .
so , kh@@ an argu@@ ed , the public would be more reas@@ su@@ red .
the hun@@ t for this technology has made some authorities a small star@@ tup company called true mil@@ e@@ age in california .
the company was not originally involved in helping states to tax drivers .
rather , it was their aim to create a new market for motor insurance in an emerging market , where drivers are expected to earn miles based on the miles they have travell@@ ed .
but the devices it tests are also interesting for road pl@@ ann@@ ers , because they do not work with g@@ ps and only provide limited information that is regularly up@@ loaded by mode@@ m .
&quot; people are more willing to participate if their speed and locations are not recorded , &quot; ry@@ an mor@@ r@@ ison explained , managing director of true mis@@ e@@ age .
some of these public pilot programmes have made great mistakes .
there are much cheaper and less in@@ tru@@ sive ways to implement this .
in o@@ reg@@ on , pl@@ ann@@ ers are experim@@ enting with offering mo@@ tori@@ sts a range of choices .
you can choose a device with or without g@@ ps .
or you choose no device at all and pay a flat rate based on the average of the risks of mil@@ e@@ age travell@@ ed by all the inhabitants of the state .
others hope to re@@ think the concept of a susp@@ icious public by using the devices with more functions than with less .
in new york city , transport officials want to develop a taxation device that can also pay for parking fees , and to pay for insurance for kilometres of road travel , and to transfer speed data from other vehicles in real time , thanks to which you are .
“ drivers would gain a better living by adding value to the benefits offered by the system , ” says a planning document in the city .
some transport pl@@ ann@@ ers , however , wonder whether all the talk about paying per m@@ ile is not just a huge di@@ version .
the metro@@ politan transport commission for the san fran@@ ç@@ o@@ is bay area was attended by officials who declared that congress could solve the problem of bank@@ ru@@ pt highway trust fund .
an additional one-@@ off fee or annual tax could be used to pay drivers with hy@@ bri@@ d vehicles or other vehicles that use little petro@@ l to pay for it .
“ there is no reason for an operation if an asp@@ ir@@ in is sufficient , ” r@@ and@@ y r@@ un@@ s@@ ent@@ ler , the head of the commission ’ s legislative and public affairs , explains .
if we do that , hundreds of millions of drivers will worry about their privacy and many other things .
k@@ ings field : small team w@@ ack@@ er be@@ ats w@@ ack@@ er and his team
the voluntary fire bri@@ g@@ ade managed its autumn main test despite the lack of personnel with flying colours .
only ele@@ ven people participated in the exercise .
the division comm@@ ander h@@ ans kam@@ me@@ rer had taken the estate of fea@@ der in the bur@@ g@@ ber@@ ger stra@@ ß@@ e in his training .
a short circuit should have ar@@ is@@ en during sa@@ wing .
the resulting fire and smo@@ ke have in@@ ju@@ red two people , one of whom was able to send an emergency call .
two bre@@ a@@ thing protection vehicles of the armed forces made a decision on the matter after the first inspection by h@@ ans kam@@ me@@ rer .
after a short time it was possible to find the first person and lead them outside .
the second person had to be wor@@ n .
this was not so easy , as there was also a narrow sta@@ ir@@ case to overcome .
the building , a workshop with an integrated stab@@ les for two horses , was not easy to secure .
it stored a lot of wood and also bal@@ es of stra@@ w .
there were also electric machines for wo@@ od@@ working .
the first ext@@ ingu@@ ishing attack was carried out via the tan@@ k in the vehicle .
another line was performed by an over@@ floor hy@@ d@@ ran@@ t at about 100 meters distance .
now three ext@@ ingu@@ ishing attacks could be made .
the building also used a tube of cav@@ ity .
h@@ ans kam@@ me@@ rer also wanted to show what is meant by little available .
in case of emergency , support is provided through the kö@@ ni@@ gs@@ fel@@ d daily operation group .
the comm@@ ander was satisfied with the course of the exercise .
net@@ working of universities and companies
on his visit to the bre@@ is@@ ga@@ u high@@ sch@@ war@@ z@@ wal@@ d region , the president of the country , gui@@ do wol@@ f , also explained to ti@@ ti@@ ti@@ see , where the workers of tomorrow come from .
in the sch@@ war@@ z@@ wal@@ d development centre , he went to the university of hamburg together with the managing school directors of the vocational schools and the district school of gy@@ m@@ na@@ si@@ um and the parent advisory board chair@@ men .
&quot; education is an important location factor &quot; , cla@@ u@@ dia ste@@ l@@ le , director of the han@@ s-@@ th@@ om@@ a school , emphasi@@ zed the net@@ worked school project education center ho@@ ch@@ sch@@ war@@ z@@ wal@@ d .
wol@@ f was impres@@ sed by the model projects for training .
since 2011 , the wal@@ d@@ stadt district has been a successful cooperation between the funding centre , the district gy@@ m@@ na@@ si@@ um and the vocational school centre .
he also p@@ raised the family-@@ friendly atmosphere in the county .
&quot; it is important not only to have a view of the family phase , but also to have a period of care for rela@@ tives , due to demographic change , &quot; wol@@ f explained .
he also stated that more and more employees are concerned with the care and care of their rela@@ tives .
&quot; without the support of employers , the resulting burden on employees can lead to an end to the employment relationship , &quot; said wol@@ f .
but no one can afford to lose skilled labor , he continued .
another , particularly important factor is the net@@ working of universities and companies .
&quot; for who@@ ever has known the region &apos;s advantages during his studies remains with his acquired knowledge and skills often the regional economy .
only if sufficient training places were offered can the need for skilled workers be met .
in his opinion , the district ’ s location advantage is its advant@@ ageous location in the south-@@ west of germany , in the immediate vicinity of france and switzerland .
he also experienced the same thing on his train journey from ti@@ ti@@ se@@ e-@@ neu@@ stadt to fre@@ i@@ burg , where he made an effort to develop public transport .
&quot; remain persi@@ stent and ensure that the public access to the public transport system is improved , &quot; he said to the local authorities present .
with music a fun afternoon is spent with music .
for 15 years , the k@@ au@@ l family has been inv@@ iting the di@@ et@@ inger sen@@ i@@ ors to have coffee , ca@@ kes and afterwards to a ves@@ per .
in the past , the elderly were treated as residents of the re@@ sting place .
meanwhile , the st. jo@@ se@@ f nur@@ sing home is held this afternoon .
the residents were delighted with the delicious ca@@ kes and ca@@ kes .
later , there was a sa@@ usage sal@@ ad .
with popular me@@ lo@@ dies , sil@@ via k@@ immi@@ ch-@@ ban@@ t@@ le and her father kar@@ l k@@ im@@ m@@ ich enter@@ tained .
the over 100 years old natural stone wall , which is the front de@@ mar@@ c@@ ation of the old school court of the church street , which was re@@ constructed , is to be re@@ built with the re@@ hab@@ ilitation costs plan of the city of br@@ ä@@ un@@ ling@@ en .
in the days before kil@@ big , the first works of renov@@ ation of the front school cour@@ ty@@ ard were performed with a small angle wall , which was used to stabil@@ ise and reli@@ eve the sta@@ tic load of the over one hundred years old natural stone wall with bal@@ u@@ str@@ ade .
the next step , according to alexander mis@@ ok of the br@@ ä@@ un@@ ling@@ er stad@@ t@@ ba@@ u , will include the state mon@@ ument office in the planning and will provide a re@@ hab@@ ilitation plan for the old wall .
after that , a cost calcul@@ ation will be carried out by experts who will then be able to report to the local council to decide and decide on the way forward .
a decision on this will probably be taken next year .
after the renov@@ ation , pav@@ ing and plan@@ ting of the old school cour@@ ty@@ ard within the two side w@@ ings of the school built in 19@@ 12 , a follow-up action must be taken in the fores@@ ee@@ able future to remove the wall from need .
the historic , one hundred year old bridge of the old school of kir@@ ch@@ stra@@ ß@@ e is connected mainly by water and fro@@ st damage , as there is no dra@@ in@@ age , which needs to be re@@ medi@@ ed and has a cur@@ ve .
deep cr@@ acks in single stones are evidence of weather damage , but the wall is not currently in danger of collapse .
a firm wall is a pre@@ requisite for a school cour@@ ty@@ ard used by students , which has been done by the current for@@ ti@@ fications .
originally , the school ’ s renov@@ ation was planned in 200@@ 8-@@ 2009 , but large un@@ planned spending brought a postpon@@ ement .
an important word in the historical restoration of the school walls , which was even used for film rec@@ ord@@ ings , will be given by the state mem@@ orial office .
if there are any requirements from this site , the city of br@@ ä@@ un@@ ling@@ en hopes to receive grants from the mon@@ ument preser@@ vers .
the students of the br@@ ä@@ un@@ ling@@ er primary school , who are now back in a well refurb@@ ished old school building with a new a@@ ula , can soon use the old school cour@@ ty@@ ard .
ö@@ z@@ dem@@ ir wants to receive jazz training in stutt@@ gart .
the ongoing discussions on the future of the music col@@ leg@@ es in bad@@ en-@@ w@@ ür@@ t@@ tem@@ berg have now also been followed by ce@@ m ö@@ z@@ dem@@ ir , federal chairman of the greens .
&quot; i think it is wrong to include ho@@ lis@@ tic education in the musi@@ k@@ ho@@ ch@@ sch@@ u@@ le stutt@@ gart , &quot; said ö@@ z@@ dem@@ ir of the &quot; stutt@@ gart news &quot; .
jazz and classical music are a part of the jazz festival in stutt@@ gart .
this contradic@@ ts ö@@ z@@ dem@@ ir , who was chosen for a direct mandate in stutt@@ gart for the federal elections on 22 september , who was the green and red state government .
this is pus@@ hing for a new order of the five music universities in bad@@ en-@@ w@@ ür@@ t@@ tem@@ berg , based on an expert study .
the programme will then include jazz and pop from the musi@@ k@@ ho@@ ch@@ sch@@ u@@ le stutt@@ gart to the musi@@ k@@ ho@@ ch@@ sch@@ u@@ le man@@ n@@ heim .
u.s. border : &quot; super@@ -@@ tunnel &quot; to drug s@@ mu@@ gg@@ ling discovered
on the mex@@ ic@@ an border with the usa , investig@@ ators have found a &apos; super@@ -@@ tunnel &apos; for drug s@@ mu@@ gg@@ ling and have closed down .
as the us customs authorities have said , the more than 500 metr@@ e long pi@@ pe between ti@@ ju@@ ana and san di@@ e@@ go was equipped with electricity , rail tracks and an air conditioning system .
three susp@@ ects have therefore been arrested , eight tonnes of mari@@ ju@@ ana and almost 150 kil@@ o@@ gram@@ s of co@@ ca@@ ine conf@@ is@@ c@@ ated .
the tunnel was not yet in use , according to the information .
&quot; these car@@ te@@ ls are st@@ up@@ id when they think they can di@@ g through under the rad@@ ar , &quot; said the us district secretary general sou@@ ther@@ n cali@@ for@@ ni@@ a , lau@@ ra du@@ ff@@ y .
insu@@ red do@@ om@@ s@@ day to drug gan@@ gs said : &quot; if you continue building such tun@@ nels and try to use them , we are determined to make a huge waste of your dir@@ ty money &quot; .
both the us authorities and the mex@@ ic@@ an security forces are engaged in a permanent battle against the drug car@@ te@@ ls .
since 2006 , mexico has had more than 7@@ 7@@ ,000 people killed in the context of drug crime .
designed by experts
the tunnel &apos;s complex features make it difficult for investig@@ ators to assume that it is being used by architec@@ ts and engineers and that the construction is going to take about a year .
the track system was equipped to allow electric cars to be used there .
on the mex@@ ic@@ an side , access is in a building 80 metres from the border .
according to the authorities , a lad@@ der leads to the dep@@ ths of the tunnel to the actual entrance .
the tunnel has a cross-@@ section of 1.@@ 20 metres in height and 90 cm in width .
it would have been a good idea to promote illegal immigration to the united states .
two of the susp@@ ects were arrested in connection with the co@@ ca@@ ine fund .
the third , a mex@@ ic@@ an , was arrested for the se@@ iz@@ ure of mari@@ ju@@ ana .
all three face the threat of life imprison@@ ment as the maximum penalty , as officials said .
eight such tun@@ nels have been discovered since 2006 , as stated at the press conference in san di@@ e@@ go .
it is the first time , however , that co@@ ca@@ ine has been found in such a tunnel construction .
co@@ ca@@ ine is usually produced in smaller quantities , not through tun@@ nels .
this demonstrates the &apos; des@@ pair &apos; of drug gan@@ gs , whose traditional routes have now been cut off , said bill sh@@ er@@ man of drug flag@@ ging de@@ a in san di@@ e@@ go .
they would do everything to get to the us .
no details have been given to the de@@ tain@@ e@@ es , at least one is mex@@ ic@@ an , they said .
they must be given prison sent@@ ences of up to ten years .
in 20@@ 14 , ge@@ is@@ inger will be celebr@@ ating the 20@@ 14 year of the year
the anniversary of the city of ge@@ is@@ ingen on the occasion of the 12@@ 50 .
the first mention of the town is coming closer .
if the year ends in just eight weeks , the anniversary year is appro@@ aching .
ge@@ is@@ ingen and kir@@ ch@@ en-@@ haus@@ en were first mentioned together in documents in 7@@ 94 .
a document was produced in churches , in which both places are mentioned .
on 15 march , there will be an official start to the anniversary year , and as ho@@ stages currently have no hall , this opening event will take place in the place where 12@@ 50 years ago both were mentioned for the first time , in the city .
in the context of the anniversary , several events are held in ge@@ is@@ ingen as well as in kir@@ ch@@ en-@@ haus@@ en .
kir@@ ch@@ en-@@ haus@@ en will be held in july on a festival weekend from july 18th to 20th the 12@@ 50 .
re@@ union is celebr@@ ating .
on friday with a party , on saturday and sunday with a party around the church hall .
the church of the house of the church is also celebrated this weekend .
city music director ru@@ dol@@ f bar@@ th has written a book for the city on the occasion of the anniversary , which is listed on three dates .
on june 21 , together with the son@@ n@@ w@@ end@@ fe@@ i@@ er of the sch@@ war@@ z@@ wal@@ d@@ vere@@ in , on july 12 in the arena with fire@@ works and on december 13 as the first concert of city music in the new fe@@ st@@ hal@@ le .
this will be completed and in@@ aug@@ ur@@ ated in the anniversary year , the official date is on the last weekend of september , 27 and 28 .
on the occasion of the ge@@ is@@ ing city anniversary , a new chron@@ ic@@ le is also released .
&quot; but a chron@@ ic@@ le is not only to be made by ge@@ is@@ ingen itself , but a printed work on the sin@@ king of today , which is simply made of ge@@ is@@ ingen , kir@@ ch@@ en-@@ haus@@ en , fing@@ ers and cor@@ p@@ ses &quot; .
and the ge@@ is@@ ingen of today also celebra@@ tes 20@@ 14 birth@@ day , in 197@@ 4 the present space was completed with the associations .
the new chron@@ ic@@ le is due to be held on 21 or 22 november in the new festival hall in ge@@ is@@ ingen .
20@@ 14 is also another year with many ju@@ bil@@ ee .
the nar@@ ren@@ z@@ un@@ ft stro@@ h@@ gl@@ on@@ ki begins on 8 february with a traditional evening on the occasion of its 6@@ 0-@@ year existence , the harmony gu@@ t@@ mad@@ ingen will be 90 years and has the fe@@ ast ban@@ quet on 29 march and 4 .
the old le@@ i@@ fer@@ d@@ ingen plant is 40 years old , the ge@@ is@@ inger school has been in the new location for 50 years and celebra@@ tes this on may 10 , the musi@@ k@@ vere@@ in poly@@ hy@@ m@@ nia le@@ i@@ fer@@ d@@ ingen will celebrate 150 years old in the 4th .
the city of ge@@ is@@ ingen was given a gift certificate owned by the monaster@@ y of st. g@@ allen in 7@@ 64 .
the document was produced in churches ( haus@@ en ) , which was then a court .
both communities are therefore mentioned in the same document .
reason 20@@ 14 to celebrate this 12@@ 50 year , additionally there is the municip@@ al reform 40 years ago .
r@@ at targets track systems
should the railway crossing be lab@@ ori@@ ously re@@ constructed to reduce road safety ?
yes , the local counc@@ ils have decided .
sch@@ il@@ t@@ ach must provide eur 2@@ 20 000 for this .
the deutsche bahn is planning to open up the kin@@ zi@@ g@@ tal@@ -@@ bahn line next year .
in particular , safety at rail cros@@ s@@ ings is to be increased - there are regularly conflicts of trains with other vehicles across the country .
do communities agree to the reconstruction effort , they must share a third of the cost , the rest are shared by the railway and the federal government .
sch@@ il@@ t@@ ach &apos;s town buil@@ der ro@@ land gri@@ e@@ h@@ hab@@ er explained to the municip@@ al council the special features of the transfer of the ba@@ h@@ rain railway .
the city plans to build a new town in the height of the tun@@ nel@@ mun@@ d to the west of the railway track .
larger vehicles , such as those trans@@ porting long-@@ wood , could also be in the same position in the case of counter@@ -@@ traffic without having to block the tracks .
greek officials therefore proposed that a necessary support wall be constructed in such a way that the city could cross the road that followed it in due course to ensure a smooth flow of traffic .
this was discussed controversial in the local council , as some counc@@ ils have ques@@ tioned the need for road traffic : thomas ki@@ p@@ p , by saying that he had brought the s@@ enti@@ ment of cri@@ tics to the point : &apos; do we have to take so much money in the hands because of so few vehicles ?
may@@ or thomas ha@@ as dis@@ agreed : the railway crossing &quot; h@@ ir@@ sch@@ en &quot; is used regularly for long-@@ tim@@ ed trans@@ ports .
even wood from the area &quot; ku@@ h@@ bach &quot; is trans@@ ported in part over this route , because the vehicles up to 20 metres long do not use the route at the h@@ ä@@ ber@@ les@@ br@@ ü@@ c@@ ke because they could not turn into the main road .
the route also serves as a route for those vehicles that do not have to use the tunnel when the main road is closed , argu@@ ed that ha@@ as .
as it is to be expected that kir@@ ch@@ berg and sch@@ los@@ s@@ berg tun@@ nels will have to be re@@ built and re@@ built , as is currently the case in wol@@ fac@@ h , the railway crossing can be extended for a longer period .
the counc@@ ils agreed to investigate the costs of the intended wid@@ ening of the road .
despite this , the majority of the members agreed to re@@ structure the railway transition , with the pro@@ vis@@ o that the necessary support wall should be built in such a way that the city can use the road leading to ba@@ hn@@ ho@@ f@@ stras@@ se around 5.@@ 00 where appropriate for encounter traffic .
the conversion of the railway line at the ger@@ ber tr@@ aut@@ wine could , on the other hand , cause a completely different problem , which would make access to the rapidly increasing &quot; war@@ m-@@ houses away &quot; .
the administration had taken over the railway conversion plans from the engineering office in bre@@ in@@ ling@@ er , as it had doubts as to whether the planned connection of the for@@ tress office would be possible without further ado .
the investigation concluded that it was not possible to exclu@@ de the fact that the road &apos;s inc@@ lin@@ ation rati@@ os could lead to longer vehicles being put on hold .
the city , in turn , bears responsibility for this as a road construction lo@@ ad@@ er .
the conversion could therefore result in disputes regarding liability .
as both the lo@@ gging and ben@@ ding are in the current state of construction , the conversion of the railway line should not be agreed , the ham@@ mer argu@@ ed .
the risk of a col@@ li@@ sion of the train with a passing vehicle is also much lower than that of other railway cros@@ s@@ ings , because the next stop is the mit@@ te stop .
even trains from the main station would have to be slow@@ ed down to the point where no col@@ li@@ sion would occur .
the majority of the members voted against the re@@ organisation of this railway crossing , as the city of sch@@ il@@ t@@ ach &quot; un@@ covered the problem with vehicles on its seats &quot; , according to the counc@@ ils , since the railway was taking responsibility for the construction work .
the board considers the re@@ building of railway cros@@ s@@ ings &apos; before heu@@ bach &apos; and &apos; before ku@@ h@@ bach &apos; , which already have cros@@ s@@ roads agreements with the railways , to be un@@ proble@@ matic .
es@@ a deci@@ des on major space missions : missions for bil@@ lions of dollars
dist@@ ant plan@@ ets , gra@@ vit@@ ational waves or black ho@@ les - experts from the european space agency must now focus on two major projects that they will have to start in the coming years .
thir@@ ty proposals were on the table , five are still in the race .
remote worl@@ ds .
more than 1000 plan@@ ets in other stars have already found a@@ stronom@@ ers .
whether there are at least some of them , nobody knows .
the selection is difficult : should you look for gra@@ vit@@ ational waves ?
or would you rather explore the source of the co@@ smo@@ s ?
or to search earth like plan@@ ets and thus perhaps discover ali@@ en life ?
these are the questions that the leaders of the european space agency , es@@ a , are asking themselves .
for your program &quot; co@@ sm@@ ic vision &quot; you are looking for ideas for two major space projects that will make decisive progress in research .
the budget for these &apos; l missions &apos; is approximately eur 1 billion each .
the start is expected to be 20@@ 28 and 20@@ 34 .
in early september , the elite of european space research met in paris to discuss proposals for such missions .
thir@@ ty ideas were on the table , five of which have now been put to the vote .
numerous committees have assess@@ ed the proposals to make sure that researchers are not in trouble .
a final decision will be taken by the scientific programme committee in the next few days .
a total of four major questions have been selected by the es@@ a , on which the missions of the co@@ sm@@ ic vision programme , which was launched in 2007 , are to be answered .
what are the conditions for the emerg@@ ence of plan@@ ets and life ?
the exact processes in the formation of stars from large gas cl@@ ou@@ ds - and thus the emerg@@ ence of plan@@ ets that circle these stars - are still in the pro@@ ver@@ bi@@ al dark .
a large infra@@ red tel@@ es@@ cope in space could pen@@ etr@@ ate this dark .
and if a star has a planet , under what circumstances can life arise there ?
in order to address this issue , the space tel@@ es@@ cope &quot; che@@ ops &quot; is to be launched in 20@@ 17 , which will enable 500 already known plan@@ etary systems to be examined in more detail in our immediate vicinity .
the possibilities are limited , however , and che@@ ops is a small mission with a budget of eur 150 million .
with larger instruments , a@@ stronom@@ ers could map earth plan@@ ets and even analy@@ ze the composition of their atmo@@ sp@@ he@@ res , looking for &quot; bi@@ om@@ ar@@ kers &quot; : g@@ ases that are considered indic@@ ative of biological activity .
how does the solar system work ?
this issue too should ultimately provide an indication of the conditions for life to be created .
magnetic activity of a star plays an important role , and the interaction of its magnetic field and the partic@@ le radiation it produces with the plan@@ etary system .
in our solar system , these processes can be explo@@ red in an ex@@ em@@ pl@@ ary way .
the &quot; solar or@@ bi@@ ter &quot; has already sent the es@@ a a mission of the m-@@ class ( there the budget is about half a billion euros ) to this issue .
the pro@@ be is to start in 20@@ 17 and monitor the surface and activity of the sun closely .
the research is also very interesting for j@@ up@@ i@@ ter and his mo@@ ons .
you want to find out what role the giant planet plays in the development of the solar system .
the es@@ a sees the first of the three l missions of the co@@ sm@@ ic vision programme .
the pro@@ be &quot; ju@@ ice &quot; ( j@@ up@@ i@@ ter ic@@ y mo@@ ons explorer ) is expected to start its journey in 20@@ 22 .
eight years later , j@@ up@@ i@@ ter was to experience the atmosphere of the planet and the ic@@ y mo@@ ons of europe , k@@ all@@ is@@ to and gan@@ y@@ med .
what are the basic physical laws of the universe ?
space offers many possibilities to control matter under extreme conditions and to study it in ways that make the natural laws we know valid there .
perhaps there are also de@@ vi@@ ations that would pa@@ ve the way for physi@@ ci@@ sts to develop a new theory under which all known laws of nature can be united .
how did the universe arise and what is it made of ?
our co@@ smo@@ s was created by the big ban@@ g 13@@ .@@ 7 billion years ago .
in addition to the familiar matter , from the stars , plan@@ ets and living cre@@ atures as we exist , there are dark matter , whose gra@@ vity is gal@@ ax@@ ies and gal@@ ax@@ ies cl@@ us@@ ter , and dark matter .
so far , researchers have not known what physical laws have been adopted in the first fr@@ actions of the big ban@@ g , nor have they seen any evidence of dark matter and dark energy .
with &quot; eu@@ c@@ li@@ d &quot; , the es@@ a has already approved an m-@@ mission in this area , which is scheduled to start in 2020 .
a special tel@@ es@@ cope is used to determine the distribution of matter in the universe for the first time in the sky , thus drawing conclusions about the nature of dark matter and dark matter .
anyone who could do the race
of the 30 proposals , only two will remain at the end of the selection process .
the best chan@@ ces of obtaining an l-@@ mission is , according to many experts , &quot; e-@@ lis@@ a &quot; , an ambitious concept for pro@@ ving gra@@ vit@@ ational waves .
this means physi@@ ci@@ sts making changes to the spa@@ tial structure that al@@ bert e@@ inste@@ in predic@@ ted almost 100 years ago .
they have not been proved to this day .
el@@ is@@ a could do that , hope the scientists behind the project .
the mission is to identify a detec@@ tor consisting of two or three prob@@ es that is sta@@ tioned in space .
unlike plants on earth , it could also detec@@ t gra@@ vity waves that are visible in the big ban@@ g , creating new insi@@ ghts into the formation of the co@@ smo@@ s .
four other proposals still compete for the second l mission : a large x-@@ ray tel@@ es@@ cope called &quot; ath@@ ena &quot; , which includes black ho@@ les .
proposals for pro@@ tot@@ y@@ ping re@@ patri@@ ation from mar@@ s , research into mon@@ d , ven@@ us and a@@ ster@@ o@@ ids are already out of the equ@@ ation , and for solar physi@@ cs .
snow@@ den ready to cooperate with germany in terms of us surveillance .
ed@@ ward snow@@ den , the wh@@ ist@@ le@@ b@@ lower of the us intelligence service , has said that he is ready to go to berlin and to promise to the german bun@@ de@@ sta@@ g when the us national security agency and its president are not in charge .
the german me@@ p , h@@ ans christian str@@ ö@@ be@@ le , met snow@@ den in russia on thursday , where he received asylum in order to discuss with him the statement in germany .
in a letter from snow@@ den , which sent to the media in berlin on friday , str@@ ö@@ be@@ le wrote : “ even though the result of my efforts was demonstr@@ ably positive , my government is tre@@ ating a dis@@ s@@ enting opinion as continuing to be treated .
but telling the truth is not a crime .
in the letter snow@@ den wri@@ tes that he is convinced that support from the international community will convince the american government to susp@@ end the charge against him .
the acc@@ us@@ ation issued by the us justice department includes es@@ pi@@ on@@ age and the@@ ft of state property .
the german interior minister , han@@ s-@@ peter fried@@ rich , said to time online : “ if mr snow@@ den is prepared to talk to german representatives , then we will find ways to make this possible . ”
us@@ -@@ germany relations are bur@@ den@@ ed by the claims that the n@@ sa has taken chancell@@ or ang@@ ela mer@@ kel ’ s mobile phone off .
thomas op@@ per@@ mann , the member who has led the parliamentary committee responsible for the secret service , said that we should se@@ ize the opportunity to listen to snow@@ den as a witness , if that is possible , ‘ without jeopar@@ dis@@ ing him or her , and strengthening relations with the us . ’
str@@ ö@@ be@@ le , a member of the greens , published a picture of himself and snow@@ den in his t@@ wit@@ ter feed .
he was visited by two german journalists .
str@@ ö@@ be@@ le explained that according to the law@@ yer of former n@@ sa employee snow@@ den could not return to russia if he left the country .
if snow@@ den in germany say , then he needs an assurance that he is “ safe ” there , the member says .
snow@@ den says in his letter that he is committed to a “ serious and ongoing ” campaign of persecu@@ tion that would take him out of his hom@@ eland .
it is , however , affected by the global response to “ my act of political expression . ”
citizens around the world , as well as senior politicians – including in the united states – have been deeply concerned about the rev@@ el@@ ations about an un@@ controlled system of comprehensive surveillance .
in his letter , snow@@ den makes an offer of cooperation to the german authorities “ if the problems surrounding the humanitarian situation have been resolved ” .
fronti@@ er airlines charges hand@@ bag@@ gage fees for bag@@ gage .
fronti@@ er airlines plans to receive up to $ 100 from passengers travelling on their flight .
fronti@@ er airlines intends to pay up to $ 100 for a piece of hand bag@@ gage and 2 dollars for coffee or le@@ mon@@ ade , even though the announcement on wednesday said that it would not be available to passengers .
the new fee applies to cab@@ in bag@@ gage in the luggage com@@ part@@ ment above the seat , while small bags below the seat are still free of charge .
fronti@@ er explained that if the fee is paid in advance , you will be charged usd 25 and usd 100 for passengers who arrive at the boarding gate .
fronti@@ er spo@@ kes@@ person k@@ ate o &apos;@@ mal@@ ley said the fee of $ 100 targets to encourage travel@@ ers to move , to prepare for payment .
“ we don ’ t want to calcul@@ ate this amount , ” she explained .
airlines began to pay for the first and second piece of bag@@ gage checked in in in 2008 .
passengers who tried to by@@ pass them have therefore lost as much as possible in their hand bag@@ gage , which has resulted in the bag@@ gage com@@ part@@ ments being frequently over@@ filled .
charges are a way of encouraging passengers to take on board less .
o &apos;@@ mal@@ ley said that the new fee is not really about making money .
it is about the most loy@@ al customers of fronti@@ er , who would have made it clear that it would be increasingly difficult to find space in the com@@ part@@ ment above the seat .
passengers who have purchased their tickets on the airline &apos;s website do not have to pay .
this means that a passenger on the platform of fronti@@ er may have to carry one piece of bag@@ gage with him for free , but the next person will have to pay $ 100 for a similar piece of bag@@ gage .
o &apos;@@ mal@@ ley explained the site of fronti@@ er and the check-in procedures would be changed so that passengers are informed of the fee before they can go to the boarding gate .
the new fronti@@ er hand bag@@ gage fee will only enter into force in the summer , and no exact date has yet been set .
passengers often compla@@ in about bag@@ gage allow@@ ances and other charges , but airlines like to use them .
they argue that the transportation of luggage costs money and passengers pay this service when they leave the bag@@ gage .
many on wall street see the new bag@@ gage charges as a sign that airlines are taking enough money to pay the cost of air travel after years of losses .
most of them , however , have been fing@@ ers of hand bag@@ gage charges .
spirit airlines inc@@ . was the first to demand hand@@ bag@@ gage charges three years ago , and later alle@@ gi@@ ant air , also a low-@@ cost carrier , followed .
the only other airline with such a charge is the hungarian wi@@ z@@ z air , explained the airline consult@@ ant j@@ ay so@@ ren@@ sen , who follows the additional charges closely .
he estimated in a report of december 2011 that the spirit hand@@ bag@@ gage fee could bring in $ 50 million ann@@ ually .
so@@ ren@@ sen , who form@@ erly held a senior position at mid@@ west airlines , recently joined spirit .
“ the boarding process was one of the most smooth i have seen in my career in aviation .
i expected to be te@@ eth cr@@ ack@@ ling and hand@@ y discussions at the boarding gate .
&quot; the plane was full , &quot; he said , &quot; and boarding was running like lu@@ br@@ ic@@ ated . &quot;
fronti@@ er also follows spirit for the 2 dollars spent on coffee , tea , le@@ mon@@ ade or ju@@ ice .
the company stated that passengers travelling with le@@ mon@@ ade or ju@@ ice could keep the whole can and have coffee free of charge .
water is still free .
in 2008 , us air@@ ways had briefly tried to demand money for soft drinks , but made it back seven months later , after passenger passengers had compla@@ ined and had no other large company .
fronti@@ ers has taken the step of imposing charges on hand bag@@ gage if passengers do not buy directly from the airline , is the latest initiative to link customers to their own website .
airlines pay online travel agencies such as or@@ bit@@ z 10 to 25 usd per ticket sold .
this will give all companies an incentive to encourage passengers to buy directly from them , rather than through an online travel agency .
fronti@@ er has gone fur@@ th@@ est in this area , however .
in september , the company began to make reservations through an online travel agency only half the number of frequent fl@@ yer miles .
on wednesday , miles were once again reduced to 25 % of the route .
a flight reservation booked with a third party provider with fronti@@ er over 1000 miles will therefore only bring customers 250 miles .
passengers can also only buy directly on the fronti@@ er platz website .
fronti@@ er has a loy@@ al customer base in den@@ ver , but the business is shr@@ in@@ king and the company is losing money .
the proce@@ eds were down 9 % and the flight capacity was down by almost 13 % in the first quarter , as the financial report shows , which was published on wednesday by the parent company , republic air@@ ways hol@@ land .
republic has tried to use the company &apos;s sales to improve fronti@@ er &apos;s finances .
pro@@ ver@@ bs come from the bi@@ ble
more than 40 women visited the last female breakfast this year in the ev@@ angel@@ ical par@@ ish of bis@@ ingen .
the theme of the day in the municip@@ al house were &quot; pro@@ ver@@ bs from the bi@@ ble &quot; and &quot; medieval phr@@ ases &quot; .
z@@ ita kö@@ h@@ ler , the chairman of the council of church communities , went to the bi@@ b@@ lic@@ al pro@@ ver@@ bs in a lec@@ ture after breakfast .
&quot; pro@@ ver@@ bs contain life@@ styles , rules , or war@@ nings , &quot; she explained .
it compared several pro@@ ver@@ bs with the corresponding bi@@ ble sites and explained the meaning .
she called pro@@ ver@@ bs like : hol@@ z@@ z@@ z@@ au@@ ge is vig@@ il@@ ant , as d@@ and@@ ru@@ ff falls from the eyes , cast an eye on someone who gives his own , the lord in sleep , w@@ ash his hands of inno@@ c@@ ence .
the speaker has also advis@@ ed the audience to know what pro@@ ver@@ b it was .
the phrase from the middle ages was taken by the par@@ ish counc@@ ill@@ or , christ@@ el de@@ h@@ ner : all good things are three , blue making , something he@@ wn up .
it explained the meaning and origin of the phr@@ ases that they called &apos; brid@@ ges to the past &apos; .
a ra@@ ff@@ le was ra@@ ff@@ led at the end .
the prices were placed on a table and were hum@@ or@@ ously en@@ um@@ er@@ ated before being handed over to the winners .
among the visitors of the breakfast round , the may@@ or candidate roman wai@@ z@@ en@@ e@@ gger also bl@@ ended .
learning instead of being unemployed : pilot project for un@@ skilled in tourism
the region was founded in 18@@ 8@@ 3 by the pil@@ ots of the mec@@ k@@ len@@ bur@@ g@@ is@@ che see lake district .
under the leadership of the federal employment agency , 49 women and men who are already un@@ skilled in the industry are expected to become experts in hotels and restaurants over three winter .
&quot; what is new is that the six@@ -@@ month courses end with degrees , &quot; said car@@ men wi@@ ec@@ her@@ t of the labour agency neu@@ brand@@ enburg .
the benefits are varied : the participants would not be unemployed , the companies would be trained professionals , the companies would become increasingly involved in hotels and restaurants , and the agency would not have to finance unemployment .
the project also includes the chamber of commerce and industry in neu@@ brand@@ enburg and the german hotel and restaurant association ( de@@ ho@@ ga ) mec@@ k@@ len@@ bur@@ g-@@ vor@@ pom@@ mer@@ n .
n@@ sa decla@@ res that it is an “ internal error ” and not h@@ ack@@ ers are responsible for the cr@@ ash of the website .
the shadow national security agency declared on late friday that a bug had caused your public website to par@@ aly@@ se for a few hours and not h@@ ack@@ ers , as was claimed online .
“ n@@ sa@@ .@@ go@@ v was un@@ reach@@ able for a few hours this night , because an internal error occurred during a planned update , ” explains the es@@ pi@@ on@@ age agency in a message sent by e-mail .
the problem will be fixed this evening .
the claim that the failure was caused by a den@@ ial of service attack ( d@@ dos ) performed on a distributed basis is not true .
in the early evening , online server tr@@ ack@@ ers had noticed that the n@@ sa website had not been reach@@ able for at least six hours and that this is still not possible for some users .
previously , a n@@ sa spo@@ kes@@ man had told ab@@ c news that the authority ’ s sensitive internal network was “ not com@@ promised in any way . ”
secret information is not in danger , the speaker said .
at least one group of h@@ ack@@ ti@@ sts claimed to have linked the n@@ sa website with a d@@ dos attack .
in the event of such attacks , the target site is floo@@ ded with page views until the servers are over@@ loaded and the site collap@@ ses .
cy@@ ber@@ tac@@ tics are relatively simple , and attacks do not serve to inter@@ f@@ ere with the target system &apos;s internal network .
the former super@@ -@@ secret n@@ sa , whose n@@ ick@@ name was once no such agency ( no such authority ) , is now in the bright light of the public and looks at the known events in recent months .
the growing contro@@ vers@@ y over the intelligence service fu@@ el@@ ed initial spec@@ ulation that the incident today was the result of a targeted cy@@ per@@ operation .
the number of people without a job fell slightly in october by 22 to 1,@@ 30@@ 7 .
although the 3.@@ 1 % rate is better than last year and better than in september , &quot; we would have hoped for more , &quot; mon@@ i@@ ka fel@@ der@@ -@@ bau@@ er , depu@@ ty director of the business agency , says .
many companies have re@@ acted to date with recru@@ it@@ ment .
one reason for this is , according to fel@@ der bau@@ er : &quot; we have hardly any skilled workers in the craft sector , in the health sector and in care for the elderly &quot; .
the number of jobs for staff in the hotel and restaurant sector has been increasing since september , due to the seas@@ onal conditions .
the winter season begins in mid-@@ december .

winning losses in bom@@ bar@@ di@@ er after delivery and orders dec@@ lines
the can@@ a@@ dian aircraft and railway manufacturer bom@@ bar@@ di@@ er inc announced a 15@@ -@@ percent decre@@ ase in net profit on thursday after he had been forced to withdraw from the market by dec@@ lining orders and deli@@ veries for third quarter aircraft .
bom@@ bar@@ di@@ er , based in mon@@ tre@@ al , did not publish flight test data for his brand new c@@ series aircraft , nor did he give any new information as to whether the aircraft was in line with the ambitious schedule next september .
the flight of the test aircraft a year and a half ago was followed by only three more star@@ t-@@ ups , which makes it question@@ able whether the test phase is proce@@ eding as planned .
the results were below the forec@@ asts and led to a fall of more than 8 % on the tor@@ onto stock exchange .
camer@@ on do@@ er@@ k@@ sen , analy@@ st at national bank financial , reduced his evaluation on thursday of “ out@@ per@@ form ” to “ sector per@@ form ” in view of the fact that the share will be in the next one to two quarters .
“ although weak@@ er delivery numbers were expected to be as high as possible in the case of aircraft , we are clearly disappointed by the mar@@ gin development in the transport sector , ” do@@ er@@ k@@ sen said in a customer ’ s letter .
we believe that bom@@ bar@@ di@@ er should be given new orders for c@@ series when the testing program for the aircraft progres@@ ses .
if you do not receive any new orders in the coming months , we expect the market to be more s@@ cep@@ tical about the program .
bom@@ bar@@ di@@ er hopes that the aircraft crew of the c@@ series will take the company to the lower market segment , which is currently being explo@@ ited by bo@@ eing and airbus .
the first test aircraft was presented to the public in march and fle@@ w for the first time in september after months of delays .
but so far , binding orders for the c@@ series are moderate with 17@@ 7 , as potential bu@@ yers are waiting for the results of the flight tests and want to see if the company ’ s claims regarding fuel efficiency and cost savings are zu@@ e@@ sen@@ sing .
currently , there are 4@@ 03 orders and commitments from 15 customers and companies .
ceo pi@@ er@@ re beau@@ do@@ in is confident that bom@@ bar@@ di@@ er will achieve his 300 binding orders at the beginning of commercial use of the jet .
the company management confirmed on thursday that the program was in the schedule for analy@@ sts and media .
“ the test aircraft has stopped on the ground than expected , ” said beau@@ do@@ in at a telephone conference and added that during the aircraft ’ s life ground tests and software updates were scheduled .
each manufacturer plans differently .
we have decided to take a first flight and then add a review period , which we have done .
this is done throughout the entire programme .
the second of five test aircraft is expected to start in the next few weeks , the remaining aircraft shortly there@@ after , it was said from the company side .
yet analy@@ sts remain ske@@ p@@ tical about whether 12 months after the ma@@ ide@@ n flight the first customer can take a c@@ series aircraft into operation .
bom@@ bar@@ di@@ er explained that it is re@@ viewing the star@@ t-@@ up planning and will be planning to update it in the coming months .
“ the slow progress of the flight test – even though it is clearly bom@@ bar@@ di@@ ers of internal planning – rein@@ forces our view that commission@@ ing is limited to the first quarter of 20@@ 15 , ” said do@@ er@@ k@@ ner .
in the third quarter , at the end of september 30 , bom@@ bar@@ di@@ ers ’ net gain fell to $ 14@@ 7 million , or $ 8 c@@ ents per share , from $ 17@@ 2 million , or $ 9 c@@ ents per share , a year .
the adjusted ear@@ nings per share are un@@ changed at 9 c@@ ents .
sales decreas@@ ed slightly , from 4.@@ 2 to 4.@@ 1 billion dollars .
analy@@ sts had a profit of 10 c@@ ents per share and a tur@@ nover of $ 4.@@ 56 billion , according to th@@ om@@ son re@@ u@@ ters i / b / e / s .
the world &apos;s fourth largest aircraft manufacturer states that it has issued 45 aircraft this quarter , a drop of 57 last year .
net orders fell from 8@@ 3 aircraft to 26 .
the order book in the aero@@ space division was 3@@ 2.@@ 9 billion dollars on 30 september , and was therefore un@@ changed compared to 31 december .
“ in the aero@@ space sector , the results were within the framework of our specifications , but the low order in@@ take and market conditions as a whole were dis@@ appoin@@ ting , ” said beau@@ do@@ in .
sales in the aero@@ space sector fell 13 percent to two billion dollars .
bom@@ bar@@ di@@ er , the world ’ s largest railway manufacturer , announced that sales in this segment increased by almost 11 percent to $ 2.@@ 1 billion .
the order book in the transport sector amoun@@ ted to usd 3@@ 2.@@ 6 billion on 30 september , and was thus slightly higher than 31 december .
the profit mar@@ gin in the transport sector has been affected by settlement problems in some major contracts .
according to the management , there will be new pres@@ ets for the fourth quarter .
in the after@@ no@@ on-@@ day trading on thursday , the bom@@ bar@@ di@@ er share dro@@ pped 8.@@ 5 percent and stood at 4.@@ 8@@ 3 can@@ a@@ dian dollars , after it was also announced that the google finance executive , pat@@ ric@@ k pic@@ h@@ ette .
the braz@@ ili@@ an em@@ bra@@ er sa , the world &apos;s third largest commercial aircraft manufacturer and bom@@ bar@@ di@@ ers of the clo@@ s@@ est ri@@ val , announced a 10 % drop in quar@@ ter@@ ly profit on thursday .
usa : sho@@ ts at los angel@@ es airport
an unknown man has to wait for the la@@ x airport on friday morning ( local time ) .
while the airport is being operated via t@@ wit@@ ter &apos;s short message service , the sho@@ o@@ ter was in cust@@ o@@ dy , the los angel@@ es times reported that the man was dead .
a security officer was also killed .
media also reported several in@@ ju@@ red people .
us president bar@@ ack obama is being kept informed on a regular basis , said the white house spo@@ kes@@ man , j@@ ay car@@ ney .
the incident occurred in terminal 3 e@@ ye@@ wit@@ nesses announced that a sho@@ o@@ ter with a gun in one of the departure h@@ alls was seen as several media reported .
a travell@@ er told the station c@@ n@@ n that many people had been looking for protection in pan@@ ic .
travellers would have cr@@ acked and cr@@ acked children .
among the waiting ones was pan@@ ic , many would have been hi@@ ding behind chairs for fear .
he heard two sho@@ ts , says a travel@@ er of the &quot; los angel@@ es times &quot; .
one security officer , t@@ sa , has suffered a shot in@@ jury at his foot .
the scene was &quot; as in a movie &quot; .
after that , he himself had been brought into a security area , the man reported .
the sho@@ ts should have fallen close to a security control area .
airport buildings ev@@ ac@@ u@@ ated
on television scre@@ ens , we saw many am@@ bul@@ ance and police cars in front of a terminal .
hundreds of people were taken out of the building in safety .
users published on t@@ wit@@ ter photos of a special mission command and a ri@@ f@@ le on the ground .
as the airport management told us via t@@ wit@@ ter , the incident began at 9.@@ 30 in the morning ( local time ) .
access roads have been bloc@@ ked , which , according to the c@@ n@@ n , has resulted in long back@@ roads .
the air traffic had been tempor@@ arily stopped except for land@@ ings .
however , on c@@ n@@ n several aircraft were also observed at the start .
terminal 3 is operated by smaller us airlines .
the la@@ x airport of los angel@@ es is one of the largest airports in the united states .
co@@ ca@@ ine ad@@ voca@@ te-@@ ad@@ voca@@ te-@@ general , the drug bo@@ ss war@@ ned against police investigation , must be imprison@@ ed .
bas@@ har@@ at d@@ it@@ ta , 42 , gave information to sub@@ world size ne@@ il scar@@ bor@@ ough further .
the law@@ yer was afraid that his secret drug ad@@ diction could come to light .
he was awarded the li@@ ver@@ pool cro@@ wn court for three years in prison .
a well-known criminal def@@ en@@ der who had a drug bar@@ on war@@ ned against a major police investigation because he was afraid to see his secret drug ad@@ diction revealed was sent@@ enced to three years in prison .
bas@@ har@@ at d@@ it@@ ta , 42 , supplied sub@@ world size ne@@ il scar@@ bor@@ ough with sensitive information on investigations into its activities in the drug trade , after having been replaced by its own co@@ ca@@ ine search .
the “ first-@@ class ” p@@ raised law@@ yer by crimin@@ alists with the n@@ ick@@ name “ bas@@ h ” was arrested in 2011 in his house after the police scar@@ bor@@ ough over@@ seen .
officials observed scar@@ bor@@ ough ( 32 ) dis@@ car@@ ded three bags of co@@ ca@@ ine at the house of the law@@ yer in black@@ bur@@ n , lan@@ cas@@ hire , who had been killed with colleagues at a meal of the law@@ yer &apos;s bar .
the investigation revealed that d@@ it@@ ta regularly uses class a drugs , after the tests sp@@ ur@@ red trac@@ es of co@@ ca@@ ine in its hair , on its wal@@ let and on credit cards .
for a period of eight months between january and august 2011 , he tried to dis@@ close un@@ authorised information about the arrest of two men on behalf of scar@@ bor@@ ough and one of his partners .
all four susp@@ ects were arrested by the police at the time in a major investigation into her@@ o@@ in and co@@ ca@@ ine trafficking in lan@@ cas@@ hire , cum@@ bri@@ a , mer@@ se@@ y@@ side , ber@@ k@@ sh@@ ire and west .
together with 32 other people , they were arrested later , after the police had her@@ o@@ in and co@@ ca@@ ine in a series of house sear@@ ches worth £ 1.5 million , and g@@ b@@ p 200@@ ,000 in cash .
d@@ it@@ ta , 42 , gave information to the crimin@@ als because he fe@@ ared that his drug ad@@ diction could be published .
today , d@@ it@@ ta , who is responsible for the firm for@@ bes sol@@ ic@@ itors in black@@ bur@@ n , was awarded the li@@ ver@@ pool cro@@ wn court after a three-@@ week trial in two do@@ ssi@@ ers for dis@@ ability .
he gave a previous survey on co@@ ca@@ ine ownership .
the law@@ yer was transferred after the police had been involved in their investigation of scar@@ bor@@ ough , and in february 2011 , they were sent by telephone to di@@ et@@ ta .
two investig@@ ating officials followed the susp@@ ect and saw how he could become d@@ it@@ ta &apos;s house and use drugs with a pur@@ ity of 60 % in a black golf g@@ love .
shortly after he had delivered the drugs , scar@@ bor@@ ough made regular telephone calls with d@@ it@@ ta , who was at the dinner at the black@@ bur@@ n ro@@ vers football sta@@ dium in e@@ wood park .
the law@@ yer returned home , took drugs and then nine fellow communications were sent between the two .
in court , d@@ it@@ ta was known to be a “ regular consumer ” of co@@ ca@@ ine after testing class a drugs in its hair , its letter tag@@ s , and its credit cards .
d@@ it@@ ta was arrested later , but refused to take co@@ ca@@ ine and said that he had been in@@ dul@@ ged in talking to the susp@@ ected deal@@ er because he was his client and claimed that his discussion was not open to discussion .
during his arrest , d@@ it@@ ta took his wal@@ let and tried to collect a number of credit cards , but they were secured and he was given a hair@@ sample .
in the case of police inter@@ ro@@ gation , he said that he was operating an office and client services under both his private address and the work@@ place , and that clients would call him at home for legal matters .
it became known in court that he was a major player in the drug trade , some of which he had previously represented , and had called for significant ar@@ re@@ sts and informed what the investig@@ ators knew about them .
prosecu@@ tor anne wh@@ y@@ te said : “ a criminal prosecu@@ tor should know better than anyone that the law cannot be broken . ”
d@@ it@@ ta is accused of ab@@ using his position as a criminal def@@ en@@ der , because he has been too involved with certain clients .
the relationship in question is not just that of a drug deal@@ er , but of a drug deal@@ er who supplies his law@@ yer with drugs .
part of his communications were undoubtedly legitimate , because he was the advoc@@ ate of these people .
but that went far beyond the limits of a normal relationship between law@@ yer and client .
he acted as far as possible in the police investigation , so that they could continue their criminal activities .
mr d@@ it@@ ta brought his profes@@ sion into dis@@ repu@@ te .
he was too close to certain clients , particularly scar@@ bor@@ ough , and he allowed his independence to be com@@ promised .
d@@ it@@ ta dis@@ missed any mis@@ conduct and claimed that “ if i were a corru@@ pt law@@ yer , which i am not , and that i would pass on information to scar@@ bor@@ ough , i would not wait 15 hours , but would wait . ”
but after the hearing , super@@ int@@ ent le@@ e hal@@ ste@@ ad said of the police in lan@@ cas@@ hire : “ mr d@@ it@@ ta has taken the step from a criminal def@@ en@@ der to a criminal at the moment he started to start drugs .
his co@@ ca@@ ine ad@@ diction led to a ho@@ p@@ eless com@@ promising and made him sus@@ cep@@ tible to the mo@@ tives of leading members of organised crime , who en@@ do@@ wed him with the collection of valuable information on police investigations .
lawyers must maintain the highest standards of integrity and ensure public confidence and confidence .
d@@ it@@ ta has lost that confidence and tried to hide behind the fa@@ ç@@ ade of his profes@@ sion .
the serious and organized crime unit of lan@@ cas@@ hire led the investigation of di@@ tt@@ a , who also led to a convic@@ tion in three cases for the pos@@ session of co@@ ca@@ ine and judicial dis@@ ability .
this case should be a warning to crimin@@ als and shows that no one can escape the arm of the law .
we find them and bring them to justice .
scar@@ bor@@ ough himself was sent@@ enced to 14 years in prison after he had con@@ spir@@ ed to her@@ o@@ in , co@@ ca@@ ine , and can@@ n@@ ab@@ is trafficking .
thir@@ ty-@@ five other people involved in the drug trade have been sent@@ enced to total penalties of 15@@ 3 years for drug off@@ ences .
d@@ it@@ ta published a section of questions and answers about itself on his website , where he stated that his dream job was to be a law@@ yer in the death penalty cell in america .
revolutionary work of church music
at the end of the celebra@@ tions for the occasion of its 16@@ 0-@@ year anniversary , the song cr@@ ane dun@@ n@@ ingen will offer two services of wor@@ ship with the &quot; deutsche mes@@ se &quot; by fran@@ z sch@@ u@@ bert .
after the great success of the musi@@ c@@ al &quot; rock my life &quot; , which the audience will be delighted this spring , the song cr@@ an@@ k will be released at the end of the anniversary year with the opening of two services of the german mass .
on saturday , october 26@@ th , this exceptional fair will be held from 19 during the evening fair in the st. mar@@ tin@@ is@@ kir@@ che dun@@ n@@ ingen and on sunday , october 27@@ th , from 10.@@ 15 at the church of god in st. john .
the so-called deutsche mes@@ se ( german fair ) , with the original title &quot; sing@@ ing to celebrate the sac@@ red victim of the fair &quot; , d 8@@ 72 , is a spiritual music work of compos@@ er fran@@ z sch@@ u@@ bert from 18@@ 26 .
the fair will be listed as part of the services of god , as the client jo@@ han@@ n phili@@ p@@ p neu@@ mann intended .
under the direction of her@@ mann sch@@ nei@@ der , the cho@@ ir is gre@@ e@@ ted by the group of the music association fro@@ h@@ sin@@ n ten@@ n@@ en@@ br@@ on@@ n and no@@ em@@ i lo@@ ko@@ di at the or@@ gan .
has@@ l@@ ach : ske@@ p@@ tic@@ ism is moving toward confidence .
the elections to the par@@ ish council in 20@@ 15 will , for example , bring about a change in the soul unit has@@ l@@ ach ( se ) .
there is only one other par@@ ish council for all six par@@ ish counc@@ ils .
in a joint meeting on saturday , the has@@ l@@ ach , ho@@ f@@ ste@@ t@@ ten , m@@ ü@@ h@@ len@@ bach , fis@@ cher@@ bach , ste@@ in@@ ach and wel@@ sch@@ en@@ ste@@ in@@ ach bodies prepared for the changes .
the fundamental decisions of the di@@ oc@@ ese can no longer be changed and the par@@ ish church of the par@@ ish counc@@ ils must be able to implement them as satisfac@@ tor@@ ily as possible .
during the day , it became particularly clear that ske@@ p@@ tic@@ ism about the new soft but increasingly confident .
we are still a long way from the ideas and expectations of the innovations in 20@@ 15 to concrete proposals on the future composition and size of the par@@ ish council , and the extremely constructive discussions between the six bodies and the main officials of the ministry of the sea .
regional de@@ an geor@@ g sch@@ mit@@ t explained the new guidelines for sea org@@ ans in the er@@ z@@ di@@ oc@@ ese by means of a presentation .
after that , the se has@@ l@@ ach church community will form a public law body that will be included in the rights and duties of the six individual church communities that have so far been divided .
there will be only one joint par@@ ish council and one foundation council , in which the par@@ ish council will have office .
at least two elected members from each par@@ ish are to be represented , and in the six par@@ ishes so-called local community teams are formed .
their task will be to make the church life in the village more attractive .
when it comes to the finances of the individual par@@ ish , there was a great need for dialogue .
the innovations provide for the transfer of collected funds into the par@@ ish for purposes .
li@@ abilities , on the other hand , extend to the entire community .
it is precisely in view of the major investments planned , the obligation of which then affects all par@@ ishes , that there were great concerns .
&quot; in the past , too , only projects were invested in which the individual par@@ ishes could manage alone , &quot; rela@@ ti@@ sed has@@ la@@ ch &apos;s par@@ ish church council , president br@@ un@@ o prin@@ z@@ bach .
practical experience with a joint body for five par@@ ish por@@ tr@@ ay@@ ed bar@@ b@@ arian rit@@ ter , the chair of the body in the w@@ ut@@ ter@@ wal@@ d-@@ neu@@ ried .
they had set themselves the task of &apos; becoming one , staying five &apos; in 2006 and found that this is not so easy .
the bodies of the has@@ l@@ ach sou@@ l@@ keeping unit then set to discuss the questions about the future composition and size of the joint par@@ ish council and the practical work of the local teams .
the work will be given concrete shape in subsequent meetings and will be presented at a further joint meeting of all six bodies next spring .
in the end , the par@@ ish council michael sch@@ ö@@ ner from ste@@ in@@ ach presented the new logo of the soul unit , which was approved by a clear majority .
in p@@ ful@@ l@@ endor@@ f , the electricity is becoming more expensive .
the citizens of p@@ ful@@ l@@ endor@@ f must adapt to higher electricity costs .
as the managing director of the city ’ s works , j@@ ör@@ g-@@ ar@@ ne bi@@ as , confirmed to the south cou@@ ri@@ er , a four-@@ person p@@ ful@@ l@@ endor@@ fer family will pay a supplementary fee of 70 to 90 euros per year .
the main reason for the forthcoming price increase is the rise in the so-called ec lev@@ y from 5.@@ 27@@ 7 to 6.@@ 3 c@@ ents per kil@@ ow@@ att@@ -@@ hour .
this lev@@ y is ann@@ ually implemented by the four operators of the large power lines in october .
these figures are the ones that will be incur@@ red by the change of energy that you will have to pay through a lev@@ y on the price of electricity .
the municip@@ al works of p@@ ful@@ l@@ endor@@ f form the last link in this chain .
in its forec@@ asts , the supervisory board of the energy company even assumed a higher lev@@ y , as j@@ ör@@ g-@@ ar@@ ne bi@@ as reported .
the concrete figures would have to be calculated before the city works next week inform their customers of the exact price increase .
&quot; we are moving from a 1 cent plus x increase , &quot; says bi@@ as , where the number is closer to the 2 cent .
traffic lights on permanent red : wait until the first stop .
sometimes a traffic light just doesn &apos;t green .
the contact loo@@ p in the street does not respond , or the light sign is broken .
what can we do then - drive in red ?
if an affected person has wa@@ ited long enough at a red light and the crossing is free , he can continue , the stutt@@ gart law@@ yer r@@ al@@ f be@@ ec@@ ker explains in the magazine &quot; motor@@ ra@@ d &quot; .
the waiting time must be &quot; appropriate &quot; , which v@@ aries from case to case .
bec@@ ker advis@@ es to wait at least five minutes before starting to cause a functional dis@@ ru@@ ption of the traffic lights .
if you continue the ride despite the red lights , you must be aware that it is not responsible for an accident that has been caused .
if you have your pati@@ ence for less than five minutes , you may not wait long enough , bec@@ ker war@@ ns you and refers to a decision of the upper regional court of ham@@ m .
in the case negotiated , a driver had to leave the traffic lights after about three minutes and had to sign up for a neglig@@ ent red off@@ ence .
the traffic lights were not broken , but jum@@ ped to green a little later .
he was not allowed to travel because of the special situation - but the fine was not .
municip@@ al council is pleased with sound budget
whenever local counc@@ ils are concerned with the budget , may@@ or r@@ alp@@ h ger@@ ster lau@@ gh@@ s well .
the municip@@ al bag in her@@ d@@ w@@ ang@@ en-@@ sch@@ ö@@ n@@ ach is well filled and debt has not been in the administration since 2005 .
the 2012 budget year can also be said to have been a complete success in this respect .
this was confirmed in the presentation of the 2012 annual accounts .
as andre@@ a ro@@ th@@ mun@@ d explained , the administrative budget of around eur 7.@@ 6 million was higher than a million .
the budget sur@@ plus was also around 1.@@ 8 million euros , and around eur 1 million was above the level of the approach .
the sur@@ plus is mainly due to higher business tax revenue and the local share of income tax .
the asset budget was also well above the planned values .
instead of the eur 1.5 million that was ear@@ marked , it was eur 2.5 million last year .
&quot; this is essentially due to higher access from the administrative budget , &quot; said ro@@ th@@ mun@@ d .
since less investment than planned has been made in the 2012 financial year , the return provision has also been higher .
overall , the overall reserve has been reduced by around eur 2.@@ 1 million to a total of eur 4.@@ 9 million now .
may@@ or r@@ alp@@ h ger@@ ster than@@ ked ro@@ th@@ mun@@ d and her team for their good work .
&quot; you don &apos;t sha@@ ke a work like this out of your sle@@ eve , &quot; comm@@ ended ger@@ ster with a view to the annual accounts .
he and the local counc@@ ils were obviously delighted with the good figures .
it may sound par@@ ado@@ x@@ ical , but it is precisely these good figures that citizens could soon pay de@@ arly .
the good financial situation has allowed the community to avoid high levels of ho@@ b@@ by in the past .
the room was very small and the bathroom was very small .
for these subsidies from various compens@@ atory po@@ c@@ kets , there are conditions .
among other things , the towns and communities applying for grants must submit certain lif@@ ting pro@@ positions .
&quot; we need to look at the issue of lif@@ ting , as investment is in the coming years , for which we would like subsidies , &quot; ger@@ ster announced in this context .
n@@ ag@@ old : hu@@ go wer@@ m@@ ter has been in the cho@@ ir for 60 years in the cho@@ ir of hu@@ go wer@@ m@@ ter in the cho@@ ir for 60 years .
at the age of 60 , hu@@ bert wer@@ m@@ ter ’ s history is at the c@@ ä@@ c@@ ili@@ a male sing@@ ing club nearly twice the length of the autumn festival in which he is hon@@ oured .
hu@@ bert wer@@ m@@ ter was as usual in the colors of his male sing@@ ing club on stage .
after 60 years , sing@@ ing with the now probably more than dear cho@@ ir still makes him a lot of fun .
wer@@ m@@ ter was also active in the association , for 28 years as a member of the committee .
he received a number of awards for his commitment and his commitment to uni@@ fying them : j@@ ör@@ g ko@@ hr , pa@@ stor@@ al speaker on behalf of the c@@ ä@@ c@@ ili@@ en@@ ver@@ band ro@@ t@@ ten@@ bur@@ g-@@ stutt@@ gart , the ch@@ or@@ t , .
his sing@@ ers gave him the german ch@@ oral association &apos;s certificate and a gra@@ vi@@ ent tin book .
in addition to the hon@@ or , the 3@@ 1st autumn festival was held in the usual track : the m@@ g@@ v be@@ tra , the song cr@@ an@@ k salz@@ ste@@ t@@ ten , the sing@@ er department of ba@@ is@@ ingen and the local mar@@ tial music association had a joint .
the m@@ g@@ v vol@@ l@@ mar@@ ingen opened a new world of music with atmo@@ sp@@ her@@ ic songs such as &quot; in the wine paradise &quot; and &quot; fun@@ ny , your bro@@ thers &quot; .
your hon@@ or@@ ary sing@@ er hu@@ bert wer@@ m@@ ter prepared a small stand - wol@@ f@@ gan@@ g am@@ ade@@ us moz@@ art &apos;s &quot; bun@@ des@@ lied &quot; for the hon@@ or .
the male sing@@ ing association be@@ tra also san@@ g classical cho@@ ir songs like &quot; hun@@ ter sp@@ ell@@ s &quot; by ju@@ li@@ us w@@ eng@@ ert , &quot; far , far away &quot; by hu@@ bert go@@ is@@ er@@ n and the fol@@ k song &quot; .
the song cr@@ an@@ es salz@@ ste@@ t@@ ten created a unique atmosphere with its mixed cho@@ ir and women &apos;s group - the &quot; imp@@ ul@@ se &quot; - for the women &apos;s quota of the festival .
the mixed cho@@ ir kid@@ n@@ app@@ ed with the ne@@ apo@@ lit@@ an fol@@ k &quot; santa lu@@ cia &quot; and &quot; evi@@ va esp@@ ana &quot; by an@@ tos c@@ us in foreign countries , during the &quot; imp@@ ul@@ se &quot; also returned to foreign languages .

ken@@ y@@ an press ou@@ tr@@ ages at controversial media law
“ we are in a fri@@ ghten@@ ing position and one may wonder what parliament thin@@ ks of simply calling tomorrow the judicial independence of the european union ? ” was the subject of the newspaper that published the draft law .
“ the law is dr@@ ac@@ on@@ ian and very pun@@ ish@@ able , ” cy@@ r@@ us kam@@ au , ceo of the capital group , said , including capital fund .
he said that the new media tri@@ bun@@ al “ will always be bi@@ ased , because it is an extended arm of the government , ” and restrictions on content and advertising would have made ken@@ ya ’ s position in the global economy har@@ der .
“ i hope the president will listen to us and we appeal to him to reject this draft law and send it back to parliament , ” he said .
according to the star newspaper , the government is taking a cu@@ d@@ g@@ ling role by means of the new law , “ the media effectively in a str@@ ang@@ le@@ hold ” , which stipu@@ lates that democracy and freedom of speech in ken@@ ya have suffered “ a severe b@@ low ” , and that “ dra@@ g . ”
the adoption of the law is part of a series of measures aimed at ensuring national security following the attacks by armed islam@@ ists on the west gate shopping centre in september .
the ken@@ y@@ an media have attrac@@ ted the authorities ’ an@@ ger by publishing images of security cameras that could be seen to show how the people who were sent to the scene sup@@ pos@@ ed@@ ly had been the luxurious shopping m@@ all .
police chief david k@@ im@@ ai@@ y@@ o respon@@ ded by or@@ dering two journalists and a leading media representative to inter@@ ro@@ gate , even though the sub@@ po@@ ena was re@@ vo@@ ked after a cr@@ y from the media .
under the new law , media houses can be fined up to 20 million ken@@ y@@ an sch@@ ill@@ ings , and individual journalists can be held in a position of up to one million and the further risk of losing their professional recognition or of losing their professional credit or of an official press ac@@ cred@@ its .
the tri@@ bun@@ al also has the right to conf@@ is@@ c@@ ate the pos@@ session of the persons concerned if a penalty is not paid .
according to daily nation , “ a single penalty can put most radio stations into bank@@ rup@@ t@@ cy . ”
the newspaper also believes that these measures could have a dev@@ ast@@ ating effect on what it describes as the “ lively blo@@ go@@ sphere ” of ken@@ ya .
if you silence the media , politicians could do without pun@@ ishment whatever they want .
“ no one will ever know , ” mu@@ t@@ um@@ a ma@@ thi@@ u wrote , a journ@@ alist at the nation that described the ken@@ y@@ an media as a decisive factor in public control .
&quot; if politicians are left to themselves , they lead the country into bank@@ rup@@ t@@ cy and back to the time of hun@@ ters and collec@@ tors , &quot; he comm@@ ented .
ken@@ y@@ an legisl@@ ators have already , in the past , been attrac@@ ting public an@@ ger .

the city and the football club were not the only reason for the official opening cere@@ mony for the kun@@ str@@ as@@ en@@ sport@@ platz despite the cold weather and the rain .
a more pleasant party had probably all wanted last saturday , but peter wanted to not play with it .
so all those who had no um@@ bre@@ lla or who had a bad idea for any reason could not keep such a thing .
this was to the musicians who fr@@ amed the festival , just as many speakers .
n@@ ass was also the f@@ c chairman al@@ bre@@ cht sch@@ len@@ ker , who spoke of ful@@ filling a dream .
his thanks were mainly due to may@@ or wal@@ ter k@@ lu@@ mp@@ p , who has been very committed to the implementation of the project , the local council , the companies involved and the members of the association involved who have interven@@ ed .
here is especially lo@@ th@@ ar her@@ o , paul we@@ iz@@ en@@ e@@ gger , he@@ iner ga@@ il and peter gra@@ f .

as long as 15 years ago , the first thoughts were given on solving the problem when the construction of a third place at the football club or at the real school at the sal@@ in@@ en@@ see .
both have been dis@@ car@@ ded .
six years ago , there were thoughts about setting up an artificial tur@@ f , which is generally considered the ultimate solution .
concrete plans were launched two years ago , when the f@@ c had le@@ ased the lab@@ el@@ -@@ shop in le@@ ase , a cost share of eur 100 000 for the construction of the square and the country received funding of eur 10@@ 4 000 .
the municip@@ al council decided to take over the remaining 3@@ 56 000 euros in the total cost of 5@@ 60 000 euros , in october 2012 , and the lu@@ mp@@ p combined .
the construction of the 68 x 10@@ 8 meter artificial tur@@ f square was started on 4 june .
during the construction period lasting over three months , 3@@ 000 cu@@ b@@ ic metres of soil were de@@ grad@@ ed , half of which were used for the construction of a dir@@ t bike route .
the union and the sp@@ d have concluded their coalition negotiations on the issues of justice and home affairs .

con@@ stan@@ cy : post-@@ accident bloc@@ king at the sch@@ än@@ z@@ le roun@@ d@@ about
the accident happened to the police when a 51 year-@@ old driver of a swiss seat i@@ bi@@ za was killed on thursday evening , around 8 p.m. , on the left lan@@ e of the two-@@ lan@@ e real@@ it@@ au@@ stra@@ ß@@ e .
just before the sch@@ än@@ z@@ le roun@@ d@@ about , he noticed that he was on the left side of the road towards stro@@ me@@ y@@ er@@ s@@ dor@@ f@@ stra@@ ß@@ e and swit@@ ched to the right lan@@ e .
this was in conflict with the bmw of a 23@@ -@@ year-@@ old con@@ stan@@ t@@ ner .
the bmw driving v@@ w pass@@ at of a 19@@ -@@ year-@@ old was also damaged .
in total , some 15@@ ,000 material damage was done , the police informed .

vienna airport provides passenger calls from vienna
mr max ma@@ i@@ er , please come to gate 24 .
it will be possible to say how this will be done at vienna airport in the future .
a large part of the volume of the lou@@ d@@ speakers is lost - the noise level is to be reduced so much .
creating a more relaxed atmosphere is the aim of this innovation .
as airport spo@@ kes@@ man peter kle@@ em@@ ann announced to radio vienna , vienna airport follows with the recru@@ it@@ ment of individual people surve@@ ys , an international trend .
for example , airports in copenhagen , frankfurt or du@@ ba@@ i are already ref@@ using to make the nois@@ y calls .
by abol@@ ishing these can@@ als - on average , around 200 personal calls are heard in a day by the speakers - it is expected to be more quiet at the airport in the future .
&quot; experience has also shown that these individual break@@ through@@ s were per@@ ceived relatively little , but at the same time all other information on changed flights or depar@@ tures has been slightly lost here &quot; , says kle@@ em@@ ann in the con@@ vers@@ ation .
high@@ lan@@ der games on the kal@@ ten@@ hof
besides bra@@ ke wag@@ on tra@@ k@@ tor , there is also a special offer at the farm autumn festival on the kal@@ ten@@ hof from 6 to 8 september .
on saturday , september 7 , the high@@ lan@@ der games start at 1.@@ 30 pm .
they have a scot@@ tish tradition , but they are sw@@ ab@@ ian on the kal@@ ten@@ hof .
teams and individual figh@@ ters compete in the discipl@@ ines of tree tr@@ un@@ k thro@@ wing , hor@@ se@@ -@@ thro@@ wing and water ha@@ z@@ ards .
four and a half metres long , 25 to 30 kil@@ o@@ gram@@ s heavy .
&quot; it doesn &apos;t matter to the b@@ are , &quot; explains organiz@@ er peter sa@@ ile .
the tr@@ un@@ k must be pul@@ led ver@@ tically , should over@@ look each other and then just come to a stand@@ still .
this is assess@@ ed in most respects .
when it comes to thro@@ wing hor@@ se@@ -@@ drawn objects , it is important to be precise .
eight metres away , the p@@ ile is thro@@ wn on .
the participants must be sk@@ il@@ ful and ener@@ ge@@ tic in carrying water for more than 50 metres .
time and water in a bot@@ tle are measured at the end .
from each cl@@ an or team , two participants are allowed to participate in the single competition .
the winners of the team and single competi@@ tions will receive pri@@ zes .
you can train from 10 am .
we would like to have a suitable clothing , for example , the ri@@ ders can take part in the scot@@ tish rock .
but sw@@ ab@@ ian co@@ stu@@ me is also allowed .
for out@@ fit , the jury will award a few bonus points .
you can register up to one hour before the start of the race .
with the scot@@ tish sw@@ ab@@ ian high@@ lan@@ der games and the trac@@ tor pul@@ ling , which takes half an hour earlier , the festival area on saturday already has a lot of action to take .
in the even@@ ings , the friends of the b@@ low@@ music will be happy to help you .
at 7 pm the bi@@ ra@@ bo@@ hem@@ ian bl@@ as@@ music from sch@@ ö@@ m@@ berg will be the great evening of entertainment .
the cha@@ pel plays the fleet of pol@@ ka and mar@@ ches .
her reper@@ to@@ ire also includes s@@ enti@@ ent wal@@ kers and a ju@@ ic@@ y bi@@ g-@@ band sound .
the sing@@ er wir@@ t and black@@ sa@@ usage bar@@ on , known as the sing@@ ing host and black@@ sa@@ usage bar@@ on , is also being taken out of the tr@@ un@@ k .
in dor@@ n@@ h@@ an , he is at the christmas market and at the fo@@ o@@ th@@ z@@ un@@ ft .

overview of milk and eg@@ g alternatives
ve@@ gan nutri@@ tion requires her@@ bal alternatives to e@@ gg@@ s , milk , and d@@ airy products .
pu@@ red to@@ f@@ u with vege@@ table cre@@ am is , for example , a quar@@ ry set .
the vege@@ t@@ arian in@@ herit@@ ance is called the world ve@@ gan day on november 1 .
the german vege@@ t@@ arian heritage and vege@@ t@@ arian heritage is proposing on the occasion of world ve@@ gan day on november 1 a number of ve@@ gan alternatives :
pure plant mar@@ gar@@ ine is a good alternative to but@@ ter , yo@@ gh@@ ur@@ t let through so@@ ya yo@@ gur@@ t .
instead of milk , so@@ ya , o@@ at , al@@ mon@@ d or rice milk can be used .
the ta@@ pe@@ red plant cre@@ am substitu@@ tes traditional s@@ cru@@ b cre@@ am .
there are also vege@@ table alternatives to e@@ gg@@ s .
half crus@@ hed , ri@@ pe ban@@ ana for example , an eg@@ g can be used as a bin@@ der in a ca@@ ke .
also 50 gram@@ s of apple or a tab@@ les@@ po@@ on of ground can@@ ned see@@ ds plus three tab@@ les@@ po@@ ons of water are suitable .
the ba@@ king process is made with a mix@@ ture of a te@@ as@@ po@@ on pow@@ der , a spo@@ on of table star@@ ch and three tab@@ les@@ po@@ ons of min@@ eral water , rather than with eg@@ g .
but also 50 gram@@ s of so@@ ya yo@@ gur@@ t or sil@@ k to@@ f@@ u can fulfil this purpose .
according to ve@@ b@@ u , there are currently around 800 000 people in germany eating ve@@ gan , i.e. purely vege@@ table .
sle@@ e@@ pl@@ ess in new york
on the way to your host families in we@@ y@@ mouth , mass@@ ach@@ us@@ et@@ ts , students of the sch@@ war@@ z@@ wal@@ d-@@ gy@@ m@@ na@@ si@@ um met the american city of new york .
after eight hours of flight , we went straight to bro@@ ok@@ ly@@ n bridge , which is the heart of the city , man@@ h@@ att@@ an , on foot .
a fascinating view of the world-@@ famous sky@@ line , which was built in the evening light and which attrac@@ ted a lot of visitors .
the time delay meant that the students were on their feet for almost 24 hours , but true to the mo@@ tto &quot; the city does not sleep &quot; the day was decided on at times square .
despite shut@@ down , the stat@@ ue of liber@@ ty was reached on the second day by a fer@@ ry and could be clim@@ bed on foot .
the financial center then went on to comm@@ em@@ or@@ ate the 11@@ th of september .
on the third day , the students could enjoy the 3@@ 73 m high viewing platform of the empire state building .
after that , the hec@@ tic hu@@ st@@ le and bu@@ st@@ le of new york streets went through the ro@@ c@@ ke@@ f@@ ell@@ er center to central park , which is an ideal opportunity to spend a short time in the autumn sun .
after a short flight from new york to bo@@ ston , students have now arrived in their host families and experience the world of the school at we@@ y@@ mouth high school .
this year , the name of saint hu@@ ber@@ tus will be celebrated again in the par@@ ish church of st. mari@@ en on the h@@ ul@@ s@@ ber@@ g@@ stra@@ ß@@ e .
st. hu@@ ber@@ tus was a ru@@ th@@ less hun@@ ter who was driven by vision and later turned to bis@@ hop of l@@ ü@@ t@@ ti@@ ch .
the hun@@ ting hor@@ n bre@@ e@@ ze group of the west@@ ph@@ alia hun@@ ting tri@@ bes , under the direction of bri@@ g@@ it@@ te k@@ lu@@ th , is musi@@ cally dres@@ sed on par@@ s@@ ons ( natural hor@@ ns in the mo@@ od it ) according to old french me@@ lo@@ dies originally .
the ve@@ ins wear riding clothes because they are mainly hor@@ se@@ -@@ riding , hor@@ se@@ -@@ riding and hun@@ ting dog .
the f@@ es@@ tive fair will take place on sunday , november 3rd at 11.@@ 30 a.m.
the newly designed op@@ sch@@ la@@ g sh@@ ines with a new caf@@ e .
one that invi@@ tes you to stay and come back .
one that wants to make the name the program .
dé@@ j@@ à v@@ u is a psycho@@ logical phenomenon , according to le@@ x@@ icon , which mani@@ fe@@ sts itself in the sense that a new situation has already been experienced or seen .
in the event of the visit of the café at the op@@ sch@@ la@@ g in the district town of kle@@ ve , in view of the university of r@@ hin@@ e-@@ wa@@ al , it does not have to remain pure dé@@ j@@ à v@@ u feeling .
finally , the café with its beautiful name has the very aim : to make a real stay not only ment@@ ally but also hand@@ -@@ proof and rec@@ ur@@ ring .
because it &apos;s fun and it &apos;s just beautiful .
a look into the inner life at op@@ sch@@ la@@ g 8 gives the vie@@ wer a good feeling right away .
the ul@@ tra-@@ modern , but not cool , caf@@ é@@ -@@ ambi@@ ence looks like a place to feel at ease .
here the team spo@@ ils with the foun@@ ders mir@@ j@@ am van der ste@@ lt and dani@@ el b@@ ü@@ tt@@ ner at the top of the team with a variety of coffee and cock@@ tail vari@@ ations .
there is also a delicious ca@@ ke or a fres@@ h@@ ly prepared bag@@ u@@ et@@ tes .
the owners , both 33 years old , have already registered themselves before the opening of the charming caf@@ e at op@@ sch@@ la@@ g as a gastronom@@ er : in k@@ ran@@ enburg they conducted the &quot; art lounge &quot; .
from moving to kle@@ ve to the op@@ sch@@ la@@ g , the friendly caf@@ e lovers will be gre@@ e@@ ted with more crow@@ ds .
not least , through the university .
&quot; while we do not have a specific target group , &quot; dani@@ el b@@ ü@@ tt@@ ner emphasi@@ zes .
instead , the two students here want to address the same as senior citizens and all ages between them .
speaking of caf@@ é@@ -@@ lovers .
the friendly owner pair stands behind the coffee enjoy@@ ment .
enjoy the sm@@ ell@@ s of hot bro@@ w in different vari@@ ations .
expres@@ so@@ fan
dani@@ el b@@ ü@@ tt@@ ner is rather the expres@@ so fan and mir@@ j@@ am van der ste@@ t@@ t the cap@@ pu@@ c@@ c@@ ino drin@@ ker .
&quot; i would like to add a bag@@ u@@ ette - that is my thing , &quot; she tells the n@@ r@@ z .
two events were already taking place in the bright café .
better said , one thing .
the harbour festival was held outside - café dé@@ j@@ à v@@ u did not benefit from it .
but there was also the r@@ ing@@ el@@ nat@@ z evening .
&quot; beautiful , successful and fun@@ ny &quot; , found the two 3@@ 3-@@ year-@@ ol@@ ds .
but it is not everyone &apos;s business .
perhaps dani@@ el b@@ ü@@ tt@@ ner is not a fan of event even@@ ings either : &quot; you can &apos;t miss it !
and with an event i always talk to those who also have an interest in the special event .
that is why events will be the exception .
&quot; we want to dis@@ ru@@ pt the normal operation as little as possible &quot; .
should it be : dé@@ j@@ à v@@ u also stands for reliability .
as regards the quality of the products offered here , as well as the team and the beautiful surroundings at the op@@ sch@@ la@@ g in kle@@ ve .
the road , which is becoming more and more a gastronom@@ ic m@@ ile .
to the deli@@ ght of many kle@@ vers , guests from close and far , and students who enjoy the ga@@ stro@@ m@@ ile and therefore also the café dé@@ j@@ à v@@ u for themselves .

a day of thanks to m@@ g@@ v in din@@ ker
it was the 16@@ 5th anniversary of the foundation of the &quot; fried@@ rich wil@@ hel@@ m din@@ ker &quot; ( german society for the foundation ) which was celebrated this year with 52 guests , active sing@@ ers and their wi@@ ves .
the restaurant &quot; wit@@ te@@ bor@@ g &quot; in din@@ ker enjoyed all the hard work of the harmon@@ ious co@@ existence , in the name of music .
tradi@@ tionally , the festival of foundations is also the right festi@@ vity to hold hon@@ ors .
the special award &quot; sing@@ er of the year &quot; was a pleasure for the writer ro@@ l@@ f wag@@ en@@ er .
&quot; you have written a lot for us , but have also done some roun@@ ds for us , for which we would like to express our sinc@@ ere thanks , &quot; said the chairman of the cho@@ ir er@@ ich sch@@ lo@@ t@@ mann .
the awards for participation in the performances and cho@@ ir sam@@ ples by means of activity sh@@ ru@@ bs went to the cho@@ ir leader di@@ e@@ ter schul@@ ze with 44 atten@@ de@@ es , followed by the hon@@ or@@ ary hor@@ st pi@@ er-@@ ch@@ oral chair .
the first place was placed in the category of ar@@ tu@@ r br@@ ü@@ ck@@ ner .
one particular thanks was addressed to the board of directors to the team of club owner ange pi@@ er-@@ ri@@ b@@ bert , who once again created a menu of the very high class and sent to ger@@ da pi@@ er-@@ ri@@ b@@ bert for the table decor@@ ation .
the m@@ g@@ v &quot; fried@@ rich@@ -@@ wil@@ hel@@ m &quot; meets his regular ch@@ oral sam@@ ples every tuesday at 7.@@ 45 pm in the club restaurant .
&quot; we are always welcome to hear new vo@@ ices of s@@ anti@@ ago , &quot; sch@@ lo@@ t@@ mann says .
un proc@@ laim@@ s new goals in the fight against poverty
the united nations is now starting to work out a series of new objectives to address the millennium development goals announced 12 years ago in order to combat poverty .
in the run@@ -up to the un summit on sustainable development , which began in rio de jan@@ e@@ iro in the evening , austr@@ ali@@ an diplom@@ ats played a key role in pus@@ hing “ sustainable development goals ” that will drive the millennium development goals that exp@@ ired in 20@@ 15 .
they were included in the final draft document drawn up by world leaders , including mrs g@@ ill@@ ard , at the summit .
un secre@@ tar@@ y-@@ general ban ki@@ -@@ moon said at the evening ’ s summit that the time had come to “ think beyond national interests . ”
“ i am pleased that the member states have agreed to start a process that will allow universal access to human rights and to promote sustainable development , ” he said .
“ these goals are based on our progress from the millennium development goals and will form an integral part of the post-@@ 20@@ 15 framework .
i will spare no effort to support this proposal , which has been given to me by the member states , in order to realise our vision of sustainable development goals , which is based on the success of the millennium goals . ”
even if s@@ g achi@@ m / ba@@ den has been without victory for four days of the match , the hand@@ ball upper lig@@ ist still has a good mo@@ od .
this is what co@@ ach tom@@ as@@ z mal@@ mon leaves no doubt about .
all of them remain fully motivated .
however , i hope that we will finally win again .
&quot; because i don &apos;t know how a victory tas@@ tes like that any@@ more , &quot; mal@@ mon exp@@ ects a success experience from his team at the v@@ f@@ l fre@@ den@@ bec@@ k ii .
even though the third league reserve from fre@@ den@@ bec@@ k has not yet demo@@ lish@@ ed trees , mal@@ mon is raising the issue of al@@ er@@ ting the poin@@ ting fing@@ er in advance .
i have met many players in the a-@@ youth .
they will therefore certainly be particularly motivated against their ex@@ -@@ co@@ ach .
&quot; it is also important to see if there is some rein@@ for@@ cement from the first one , &quot; explains the s@@ g co@@ ach .
to finally return to the pu@@ rest of success , the mal@@ mon team must be more flexible than the previous appear@@ ances .
above all , in the coverage work and the shift game , it was really huge .
there is also a need for better use of opportunities .
i hope that my players will finally be able to get their heads free during the short break .
security concerns in moz@@ ambi@@ que are growing in the face of cl@@ ash@@ es between influ@@ ential figures and the power of the democratic republic of moz@@ ambi@@ que .
thousands of people gathered in the centre of ma@@ pu@@ to under the wat@@ ch@@ ful eyes of the stat@@ ue of sam@@ ora mac@@ hel , the founder of the state and first president of moz@@ ambi@@ que to call for peace at a rare public demonstration .
“ we want peace again , we want stability , ” said van@@ ess@@ a de s@@ ous@@ a , managing director of an investment company .
for fear of the country ’ s future , she has put her business clothes against a t-@@ shir@@ t with the label “ we demand security ” in portuguese and has settled on the thursday of crow@@ d in the independence square of the capital .
for two weeks , there have been reports of cl@@ ash@@ es between government forces and ren@@ am@@ o almost daily , which are one of the worst batt@@ les since the peace agreement more than 20 years ago .
ren@@ am@@ o was once a not@@ ori@@ ous re@@ bel movement , initially led by the white rul@@ ed r@@ ho@@ desi@@ a and later by the apar@@ the@@ id government of south africa in an effort to dis@@ credit the country ’ s independent government .
after the 1992 peace treaty , it became an opposition party .
analy@@ sts believe that the country is unlikely to return to a full-@@ blo@@ wn conflict , but recent events have left foreign investors and domestic wor@@ ries .
a lot is at stake for the rapidly growing economy , because disco@@ vering huge reserves of gas off the coast and coal depos@@ its in the nor@@ th@@ west could generate investment of more than $ 50 billion from firms like rio t@@ into in the next few years .
the ruling fre@@ li@@ mo party , the dominant force since 197@@ 5 , and ren@@ am@@ o blame each other for the ten@@ sions .
ren@@ am@@ o claims that the government has pro@@ vo@@ ked recent cl@@ ash@@ es by inv@@ ading its members in the province of so@@ fal@@ a , a traditional strong@@ hold of ren@@ am@@ os , on 17 october .
the attacks on the former re@@ be@@ ls es@@ cal@@ ated when ren@@ am@@ o bases in government att@@ acked the re@@ be@@ ls and tried to dis@@ courage af@@ on@@ so dh@@ la@@ k@@ ama , who had been the leader of the group .
the government bl@@ ames ren@@ am@@ o for the cl@@ ash@@ es , and bl@@ ames the organization for att@@ acking soldiers .
president ar@@ man@@ do gu@@ e@@ bu@@ za has tried to down@@ play concerns about inst@@ ability .
the commission has said to af@@ p , the french news agency , that on wednesday dh@@ la@@ k@@ ama felt that he was “ los@@ ers ” who “ had lost all his remaining forces to help prove that he was “ a man . ”
both fre@@ li@@ mo and ren@@ am@@ o stress that they want to avoid war .
but concerns have increased since ma@@ z@@ ang@@ a was quo@@ ted as saying that ren@@ am@@ o is giving up the 1992 peace agreement .
he told the ft that he meant that fre@@ li@@ mo had no longer respected the agreement .
“ our vision is to re@@ open negotiations and to do so seriously , ” ma@@ z@@ ang@@ a said .
earlier discussions between the parties have done little to resolve the ten@@ sions caused by a series of cl@@ ash@@ es this year .
“ we have two adults here ( gu@@ e@@ bu@@ za and dh@@ la@@ k@@ ama ) who are ga@@ thering heads together , ” says joseph han@@ l@@ on , do@@ z@@ ens of open university students and mo@@ sam@@ b@@ is university .
none of them is well in the negotiating process , and none is willing to make the necessary conc@@ essions .
ren@@ am@@ o , who is pressing for electoral reform , has already stated that it will bo@@ y@@ cot@@ t the local elections in november .
presidential and parliamentary elections are planned for next year .
some comm@@ ent@@ ators have described the use of force as an attempt to off@@ end a ail@@ ing movement , to make conc@@ essions and financial conc@@ essions by the government .
ren@@ am@@ os has been shr@@ in@@ king since 1992 , while a ne@@ wer party , led by a former ren@@ am@@ o member , was building movi@@ men@@ to demo@@ cr@@ á@@ tic@@ o de mo@@ ç@@ ambi@@ que ( m@@ d@@ m ) , will probably improve in elections .
ma@@ z@@ ang@@ a claims that gu@@ e@@ bu@@ za – whose re@@ sign@@ ation is due when his second term ends next year – will destroy the country ’ s democracy .
“ he does not want a multi-@@ party democracy , he does not want transparent elections , he does not want peace , because he does not want to give up the presidency , ” ma@@ z@@ ang@@ a says .
it is un@@ clear what capacity ren@@ am@@ o has , but it has not allowed trou@@ bling attacks on police stations and vehicles on an important north-@@ south connection .
most of the batt@@ les took place in the province of so@@ fal@@ a , which is a few hundred kilometers north of ma@@ pu@@ to , but is located in be@@ ira , the port , the mining companies such as rio t@@ into and v@@ ale .
in june , rio inter@@ rup@@ ted the use of the railways for a month after ren@@ am@@ o announced an attack on the track .
ma@@ z@@ ang@@ a re@@ acted cau@@ ti@@ ously to the question of whether ren@@ am@@ o will repeat this threat .
ren@@ am@@ o wanted to “ war@@ n the international community that things in moz@@ ambi@@ que are not going well , ” said ma@@ z@@ ang@@ a .
inst@@ ability has fu@@ el@@ ed the fru@@ stration over the government , says fer@@ nan@@ do li@@ ma , director of medi@@ ac@@ o@@ op , an independent media company , because many people were already wor@@ ried about corruption , slow progress , and lack of confidence .
“ people think that the government and the president are responsible for the country ’ s future , and that he should be the one who finds solutions to the problems , ” he explains .
om@@ ar sul@@ tan@@ e , a demonstr@@ ator , said that people simply wanted stability .
“ no one is interested in ren@@ am@@ o and fre@@ li@@ mo , they just want peace and us@@ able roads again , ” he explained .
children should be seen as “ models for life ” for my@@ ths and leg@@ ends , an author says .
the stories of th@@ or showed that “ brut@@ al force has no chance of being against cle@@ ver tr@@ ic@@ ks , ” and the ar@@ tus leg@@ end demonstrates how important it is to have a dream .
many of the my@@ ths , however , are “ far too wild , too off@@ ensive , and in some cases too dir@@ ty to be taught at schools , ” which is why cros@@ s@@ ley hol@@ land argu@@ es for “ careful education . ”
“ i find it wonderful that in america my@@ ths and fol@@ kl@@ ore are already part of education , ” he said .
i have proposed this as a plan for twenty years .
he added that , for authors and teachers who are “ exc@@ es@@ sively di@@ d@@ ac@@ tic , ” children would “ dis@@ connect completely ” , because in enter@@ taining stories , the messages would “ sub@@ side ” conve@@ y .
cros@@ s@@ ley hol@@ land , the be@@ ow@@ ul@@ f from the ang@@ lo@@ -@@ sa@@ x@@ on and author of the pen@@ gu@@ in book of nor@@ se my@@ ths and the british fol@@ k valle@@ ys , said : “ you can follow certain things .
perhaps the greatest difference between an adult author writing for adults and an author writing for children is that of the need to create hope .
not everything needs to be simplified or brought to a happy end , but there is an in@@ tr@@ in@@ sic sense of good and evil .
this must be sub@@ du@@ ed , through which history is revealed and not explained .
this is the old story of showing instead of telling .
han@@ s@@ j@@ ak@@ o@@ b is again drawing in fre@@ i@@ hof
100 years ago he@@ in@@ rich han@@ s@@ j@@ ak@@ o@@ b took his reti@@ rement home in has@@ l@@ ach , and on sunday his last years in the &quot; fre@@ i@@ hof &quot; became alive .
the many spec@@ t@@ ators were enthusi@@ astic about the extremely cur@@ ious scene game .
from arrival to the award of hon@@ or@@ ary citizenship to his death , script writer and han@@ s@@ j@@ ak@@ ob@@ ar@@ ist alo@@ is kra@@ ft@@ z@@ cy@@ k had an enter@@ taining piece designed under the direction of the cor@@ ne@@ lia .
mar@@ c@@ us z@@ ag@@ er@@ mann took the audience as spo@@ kes@@ man through the ten different scenes , explained connections and brid@@ ged jum@@ ps from youth to the appro@@ aching reti@@ rement .
on october 22 , 19@@ 13 , han@@ s@@ j@@ ak@@ o@@ b heim ent@@ ers his children &apos;s heav@@ en , in his cour@@ ty@@ ard .
and then began the scene game , in which alo@@ is kra@@ f@@ cz@@ y@@ k once again played in his par@@ ad@@ er@@ ol@@ le as the great son of the city .
he dro@@ ve the sp@@ ine with style and &quot; black forest fo@@ xes &quot; by er@@ ich bec@@ he@@ rer from m@@ ü@@ h@@ len@@ bach .
he was gre@@ e@@ ted not only by the audience with a lot of applause , but also his si@@ ster phili@@ pp@@ ine welcomed him .
bil@@ ly sum@@ -@@ her@@ mann understood it incredi@@ bly well to take on the role of si@@ ster and gave her a place in m@@ im@@ ic and ge@@ st@@ ures of immen@@ se life .
the m@@ ill b@@ ach@@ er farm@@ er cha@@ pel played selected music and run@@ de the stage between the different play scenes .
the hon@@ or@@ ary citizenship was then given to has@@ la@@ h ’ s may@@ or he@@ in@@ z win@@ k@@ ler , who was appointed to represent the then inc@@ um@@ b@@ ent ha@@ et@@ ti@@ ch , along with a part of the city council .
the re@@ building was followed by the tri@@ o sing@@ ers who made han@@ s@@ j@@ ak@@ o@@ b the ex@@ cl@@ am@@ ation : &quot; o@@ h how beautiful , there are again youth mem@@ ories of my own three-@@ king period &quot; .
with her song &quot; o jes@@ u@@ le@@ in &quot; they enjoyed the public in the fre@@ i@@ hof as well as the stor@@ ch@@ ent@@ ag@@ sk@@ in@@ ders with their l@@ oud &quot; out , &quot; out .
his criticism of the church of the state of han@@ s@@ j@@ ak@@ o@@ b was as vo@@ cal as his concerns about the agricultural exc@@ esses , the consequences of industri@@ alisation or the effects of war .
in the home , behind its tom@@ b cha@@ pel on fire at ho@@ f@@ ste@@ t@@ ten , he found his reti@@ rement place .
&quot; a re@@ st@@ less spirit had finally found its peace and had gone home fore@@ ver , &quot; it was said at the end of the game of scenes .
much applause and many pra@@ is@@ e@@ worthy words were given by the audience for the performance .
bas@@ ket@@ ball : the hope of nec@@ k@@ ar gi@@ ants gro@@ ws .
the chan@@ ces of remaining a league for the sport@@ y , down@@ grad@@ ed lu@@ d@@ wi@@ gs@@ bur@@ ger bun@@ des@@ lig@@ a bas@@ ket@@ ball team have increased .
if there is a wil@@ d@@ card procedure , there is no longer any money for the nec@@ k@@ ar giant .
the hamburg to@@ wers bas@@ ket@@ ball project does not apply for a possible future back@@ yard .
&quot; we will not participate in the wil@@ d@@ card process , &quot; said ex@@ -@@ national player pas@@ cal roll@@ er , who has been the concept for a professional club in the han@@ se@@ atic city since 2012 .
the first bre@@ a@@ thing was not to be heard from lu@@ d@@ wi@@ gs@@ burg .
&quot; we did not deal with the wil@@ d@@ card procedure until it is clear that d@@ üs@@ sel@@ dorf does not get a licence , &quot; said nec@@ k@@ ar giant bo@@ ss alexander re@@ il of our newspaper .
the au@@ ction can be held until may 23 , d@@ üs@@ sel@@ dorf bas@@ kets can submit documents to the arbitr@@ ation court and prove its economic federal league su@@ it@@ ability .
until now , however , the r@@ hin@@ eland has been denied the licence twice .
the arbitr@@ ation court is the last instance .

snow@@ den could also say in russia
the former us intelligence expert ed@@ ward snow@@ den could be more critical in the us sp@@ ä@@ ha@@ ff@@ ä@@ re ’ s russian asylum .
representatives of the federal public prosecu@@ tor could either ask questions in writing or meet the 30@@ -@@ year-@@ old person in russia personally .
the agency inter@@ fax has reported this on the basis of un@@ named cir@@ cles , which are familiar with the situation .
such a question could be resolved between states , it was said .

in a small new ze@@ al@@ and town bur@@ t mur@@ o is considered a lovely k@@ au@@ z because he has decided to go on his motor@@ cycle , built in 19@@ 20 , in a race in america .
bur@@ t is not to be de@@ duc@@ ted from his dream despite a heart failure .

r@@ hen@@ us mid@@ g@@ ard has also invested heavily on land .
they distribute the coal coming from the ships to the p@@ ile .
the company has several iron in the fire at the site .
in addition to coal imports , r@@ hen@@ us mid@@ g@@ ard also uses wind plant logistics .
black sh@@ im@@ mer the coal on the storage area in front of the de@@ ak .
two huge blue sh@@ red@@ der and re@@ char@@ ging devices are distribu@@ ting or distribu@@ ting coal as needed .
every time the trans@@ shi@@ pment devices move , a r@@ inging warning sound is sh@@ ining across the ter@@ rain .
&quot; the signals are for safety and are legally required &quot; , says mat@@ thi@@ as sch@@ re@@ ll , managing director of r@@ hen@@ us mid@@ g@@ ard in wil@@ hel@@ m@@ sha@@ ven .
in the event of un@@ favourable win@@ ds , this is unfortunately widely heard - and there have already been some complaints from people from the north of the city .
he takes the complaints very seriously and has therefore cont@@ acted the people concerned , says the 40 year old .
in close consultation with the authorities , we are now in the process of sof@@ ten@@ ing the warning signals with technical measures .
he will continue to work in open dialogue with neighbours .
mat@@ thi@@ as sch@@ re@@ ll has a lot to offer at the site .
the expansion of the lower sa@@ x@@ ony bridge continues to place r@@ hen@@ us mid@@ g@@ ard on the import of coal for power stations and is one of the major players in europe in this sector .
thanks to the mo@@ oring tu@@ b , which is deep@@ ened at 18@@ .@@ 5 metres in front of the terminal , ca@@ pe@@ size bul@@ k carri@@ ers can be processed here for a long time .
&quot; this year we want to use the 3 million ton@@ ne mark in the en@@ velo@@ pe , &quot; sch@@ re@@ ll says .
besides the e@@ on power station on the ground , import coal is going to power stations in the in@@ land .
if the g@@ d@@ f su@@ e@@ z power station is to be connected , a good 5 million tonnes of coal imports a year would be realistic .
the three ship lo@@ ad@@ ers on the bridge and the second transport band could create up to 10 million .

at the time of their third appearance in the european royal class , the munich people sold themselves very well for a long time , but were not clear enough in the decisive stages .
the guests first created the piece of art , a 15@@ -@@ point back@@ log 13 minutes before the end of a tour , before pi@@ ra@@ eu@@ s had yet another turn of the game .

ben green@@ man : ten years new york com@@ edy festival : the new york city festival : the new yor@@ ker
it could be said that new york city was the birth@@ place of stand@@ -@@ up com@@ edy in america : nearly a hundred years ago , the artist frank f@@ ay , who was known as conf@@ é@@ ren@@ ci@@ er at the palace .

iran satisfied with the process of nuclear negotiations
iran is showing its commitment to the un ’ s five ve@@ to@@ es and germany one week before the next nuclear meeting .
&quot; after years , an agreement has now been reached with the international atom@@ ic energy agency to eliminate the differences of recent years , &quot; foreign minister mo@@ ham@@ med ji@@ aw@@ ad s@@ ar@@ if wrote at his fac@@ e@@ book@@ shop page .

dr@@ ama in ur@@ u@@ gu@@ ay : young k@@ ill@@ ers of game com@@ part@@ ments with mac@@ he@@ te ,
two children have been mur@@ dered in ur@@ u@@ gu@@ ay by a 1@@ 1-@@ year-@@ old .
the two young people , aged 14 and 12 , had invited their sacrif@@ ice to go bird hun@@ ting with them .
armed with mac@@ he@@ tes and k@@ ni@@ ves , they inv@@ aded the 1@@ 1-@@ year-@@ old tuesday and thre@@ w the cor@@ pse into a well , reported the newspaper &quot; el pa@@ í@@ s &quot; on thursday .
they would have been able to play football before their homes in a working quarter .
the cor@@ pse was discovered in the following night in the village cer@@ ro pel@@ ado , 15 kilometers north of the exclusive pun@@ ta del est@@ e beach .
an ali@@ bi should be a fi@@ ve-@@ year half-@@ si@@ ster of the younger , who had taken them with him , saying that she had been sex@@ ually att@@ acked by the young .
when the girl was un@@ mentioned in front of the police , however , when she described the crime without men@@ tioning an attack on her , the two bo@@ ys ad@@ mitted the deliber@@ ate killing of the 1@@ 1-@@ year-@@ old .
the reason given was that the elderly called , among other things , a ri@@ val@@ ry in the football game .
he was provi@@ sion@@ ally transferred to a psy@@ chi@@ at@@ ric youth institution .
p@@ im@@ ps must be put in j@@ ail
the explo@@ it@@ ative trafficking in human beings , p@@ im@@ ples , threats , insul@@ ts and dangerous body in@@ jur@@ ies have resulted in the district court of kon@@ stan@@ z sent@@ encing a 3@@ 3-@@ year-@@ old man from st. geor@@ gen to three and a half years in prison .
the former german military soldi@@ er , who was appointed do@@ or@@ ste@@ wards after two operations in afghanistan , set up a conf@@ ession in a process agreement .
so in five cases he has met women through internet or telephone contacts , which he had to re@@ visit in the net after a few weeks against their will .
he used to break resistance with violence and threats .
the income of women , who have been ear@@ ning for him for some years , has been re@@ tained .
by conf@@ is@@ c@@ ating mobile phones and si@@ m cards , he under@@ lined women ’ s contacts with the outside world .
together with a colleague who conve@@ yed the women , he brought them to various bro@@ th@@ els in the sou@@ th@@ west .
there he left some of them to monitor their revenue .
the def@@ end@@ ant claimed in court that he suffered a severe tra@@ um@@ a after colleagues in afghanistan had been killed alongside him in an explo@@ sion .
after a psy@@ chi@@ at@@ ric expert had serious doubts about mental re@@ stra@@ int and thus about a limited ability to blame , the 3@@ 3-@@ year-@@ old submitted a comprehensive conf@@ ession .
the court had to stop hearing any of the women who had been in@@ ju@@ red .
as a k@@ ri@@ po official reported , after a first notification by telephone surveillance measures , at least four more cases of explo@@ it@@ ative trafficking could be identified .
the inter@@ cep@@ ted talks had been marked by high aggres@@ sion .
in later inter@@ ro@@ gation , the in@@ ju@@ red would have confirmed their mar@@ ty@@ r@@ dom .
another female female witness , who has blue spots on the whole body , has not yet made any statement .
it is a &apos; completely broken person@@ ality &apos; which is explo@@ iting violence and exploitation in this profes@@ sion as a normal thing .
the def@@ end@@ ant regre@@ t@@ ted his behaviour yesterday .
&quot; he has dis@@ solved from these cir@@ cles and , after de@@ tention , wants to lead a normal life , &quot; he said .
oil prices continue to rise to $ 96 per bar@@ re@@ l .
the price of oil continued to fall on friday , after wor@@ ries about high supply over@@ sh@@ ad@@ ow@@ ed a report that china ’ s ener@@ g@@ y-@@ hun@@ gr@@ y manufacturing sector is growing .
the reference cru@@ de oil variety for deli@@ veries in december was in europe late morning in electronic commerce at the new york mer@@ can@@ tile exchange by 14 c@@ ents to 9@@ 6.@@ 24 usd per bar@@ re@@ l .
the contract fell by 39 c@@ ents on thursday , which represents a 5.@@ 8 % drop in the october price .
the large range of cru@@ de oil has been a burden on prices in recent weeks .
the us department of energy declared on wednesday that the us supply increased by 4.@@ 1 million bar@@ re@@ ls .
over five weeks , the offer had increased by 25 million bar@@ re@@ ls .
but on friday there was evidence of increased demand by two reports of an increase in chinese production activity .
this suggests a continued recovery in china ’ s economy , whose growth is attribu@@ table to 7.@@ 8 % in the third quarter , after the fall of the us dollar in the previous quarter .
cru@@ de oil from the b@@ rent variety , a reference value for international cru@@ de oil , also used by us re@@ fin@@ eries , is falling by the ice exchange rate .
court blocks the decision to stop and fr@@ is@@ k of the ny@@ p@@ d
a federal appeal court in the united states bloc@@ ked the order of a judge on thursday to make changes to the stop and fr@@ is@@ k program ( “ stop and search ” ) of the new york police department .
the second us court of appeal declared that judge sh@@ ira sch@@ ei@@ d@@ lin &apos;s decisions would be suspended until a decision was made on the appeal of the city .
the judge had rul@@ ed in august that the city was in breach of the constitution with the way in which the programme for stop@@ ping and ques@@ tioning people was implemented .
the city appe@@ aled against its assessment and the re@@ medi@@ es ordered , including the decision to set up a monitoring body to monitor the police in changing their directive and the relevant training programme .
the court of appeal heard the arguments on tuesday about the suspension that was being called for .
the appeal report stated that the judge must be dis@@ charged from the case , as she has adopted the code of conduct for us jud@@ ges by speci@@ fying that a judge may have the appearance of par@@ tis@@ an ;
the judge had rul@@ ed that police officers were in@@ ju@@ red with the civil rights of tens of thousands of people because they were un@@ reason@@ ably targeted in targeted black and latin american men with the stop and fr@@ is@@ ky programme .
she appointed an external monitoring unit to monitor the implementation of significant changes , including reforms of directives , training and supervision , and ordered a pilot programme to be carried out with cameras carried on the body in districts where most controls were carried out .
in august , the city of new york agreed to continue the practice of stor@@ ing names and addresses of people who have been re@@ patri@@ ated after police control .
an oral hearing on the voc@@ ation of the city is planned after march 14 , 20@@ 14 .
the stop and fr@@ is@@ k tac@@ tics have been used by a number of civil rights def@@ enders .
controls of this kind have been in place for decades , but the number of checks recorded during the term of the par@@ tis@@ an may@@ or michael blo@@ om@@ berg rose to an all-@@ time high of 6@@ 8@@ 4@@ ,@@ 3@@ 30 in 2011 , and most latin american men in 2011 .
in 2004 , four men belonging to all minorities brought a compla@@ int , which became a collective action .
ad@@ voca@@ tes of changes to the n@@ y@@ p@@ d stop and fr@@ is@@ k program say that changes will end unfair practices and create a more tru@@ st@@ worthy and effective police force , as well as influence the way in which other governments operate .
oppon@@ ents believe that the changes would d@@ amp@@ en police mor@@ ality , but not crime ; money would also be was@@ ted and the broader problem of a police force that has been forced to leave thousands of posts in the last decade .
the judge pointed out that she had to stop and fr@@ is@@ k practice .

with this be@@ dou@@ in wis@@ dom , the first chair wol@@ f@@ gan@@ g hen@@ ne described the history and fas@@ c@@ ination of the association &quot; helping hands &quot; .
on saturday afternoon , the t@@ enth anniversary of the association &apos;s birth was celebrated , which has already had considerable success .
the first chair , mr hen@@ ne , spoke in detail about the association &apos;s work .
he himself was the first time in maur@@ it@@ ania in ch@@ ei@@ j@@ k-@@ z@@ aj@@ ed hospital in n@@ ou@@ ak@@ ch@@ ot@@ t in 2004 .
as a result , another cooperation developed , and the gy@@ na@@ eco@@ log@@ ist hen@@ ne performed numerous operations on the spot on several trips .
during the speeches , images of the inser@@ ts were shown on a large screen , so that guests can enjoy the ju@@ bil@@ ee event from the mentioned actions .
the deser@@ t vehicle of the association was also shown .
it is a former federal border protection vehicle .
ra@@ iner pre@@ w@@ o , the former o@@ b of n@@ ag@@ old , had made the proposal to equi@@ p this vehicle with a photo@@ vol@@ ta@@ ic system and is now planning to work with the association in advisory function , according to hen@@ ne .
in 2008 , the zim@@ mer@@ re@@ i sch@@ le@@ e@@ h from ba@@ i@@ er@@ s@@ br@@ on@@ n took over the hospital in so@@ co@@ gi@@ m , a mis@@ ery quarter on the out@@ sk@@ ir@@ ts of the capital , hon@@ or@@ ary work .
hen@@ ne also mentioned a new mo@@ ther@@ -@@ child hospital in n@@ ou@@ ak@@ ch@@ ot@@ t .
especially interesting at times when the birth clin@@ ic we@@ gr@@ ab@@ i@@ kt is to be moved .
you learn a lot in africa as a medical doctor , according to hen@@ ne , for example des@@ c@@ end@@ ants against bur@@ n-@@ out .
the country ’ s political un@@ rest has not allowed it to travel as many as planned , but many medical professionals came to germany to get hospit@@ als in various areas .
in addition , contain@@ ers with material are sent to africa regularly , so in march this year medical equipment , medicines , association material , hospital beds and gl@@ asses .
the co-@@ initi@@ ator han@@ s-@@ jo@@ achi@@ m fu@@ ch@@ tel himself supplied plenty of local color@@ ation by producing a variety of wines from maur@@ it@@ ania to the mobile go@@ at bar@@ n .
when his personal mo@@ tivation was he called his work in the area of aud@@ iting as a young me@@ p .
when he realized how much money was lost on the road , he decided to help afric@@ ans control a budget by the people .
fu@@ ch@@ tel also stressed that global economics requires global human love .
nor should it be forgotten that africa is closer than some think .
gran can@@ aria is not far from africa .
cou@@ l@@ son used phone h@@ acking to check a tip .
the former news of the word editor and@@ y cou@@ l@@ son sup@@ pos@@ ed@@ ly put “ telephone h@@ acking , surveillance , and confron@@ tation ” in an attempt to get a false tip about an aff@@ air by then home secretary charles .
public prosecu@@ tor andre@@ w ed@@ is q@@ c told the court in the old b@@ ail@@ ey , news of the world had a false rum@@ our in may 2005 that clar@@ ke had a relationship with his “ attractive special advis@@ er . ”
the newspaper commission@@ ed gl@@ en@@ n mul@@ ca@@ ire , a private detec@@ tive , to investigate pa@@ w@@ l@@ by ’ s vo@@ ic@@ em@@ ail@@ s , and persecu@@ ted them , but cou@@ l@@ son also called them and left messages behind .
“ in the opinion of the public prosecu@@ tor , cou@@ l@@ son , who is now the editor of the no@@ tary , is not anyone who stands before the home of people and hopes to catch them in fresh de@@ eds , but one that is people .
he said that not@@ w uses three methods to investi@@ ga@@ tive stories : phone ha@@ z@@ ards , surveillance , and confron@@ tation .
the publish@@ er is personally involved in the third method .
he obviously knows about the second , the monitoring , it cannot be otherwise .
what about the first ?
does he know about the phone h@@ acking ?
he is argu@@ ing , but we say , “ and if he knew of it . ”
rum@@ ours of an aff@@ air clar@@ kes were first heard by the feature ed@@ it@@ orial team of no@@ tw@@ w , as a source that sex@@ ually transmitted to pa@@ w@@ l@@ by , was said : “ don ’ t waste your time .
a band with vo@@ ic@@ em@@ ail@@ s from your phone of at least three occasions was recorded in august 2006 in mul@@ ca@@ i@@ res apartment .
the investig@@ ators also found entries on the detec@@ tive computer on which pa@@ w@@ l@@ by and her si@@ ster were lab@@ elled “ projects ” .
in the time when the research was running , the grand@@ parents of pa@@ w@@ l@@ by received anonymous calls calling in which they were asked for information about them , ed@@ is explained .
meanwhile , former chief re@@ porter ne@@ ville thur@@ l@@ be@@ ck and the former former re@@ porter of j@@ ack we@@ at@@ her@@ up over@@ saw the surveillance of pa@@ w@@ l@@ by ’ s movements .
on june 18 , 2005 , cou@@ l@@ son left her a vo@@ ic@@ email with the following content : “ i have a story that we want to release tomorrow , about which i would like to talk to charles . ”
ed@@ is explained that cou@@ l@@ son &apos;s activities at this story followed the same pattern as other major person@@ alities , such as former home secretary david bl@@ un@@ ket@@ t .
the jury heard on thursday that cou@@ l@@ son bl@@ un@@ ket@@ t was accused of an aff@@ air with a married woman when he himself was facing the co@@ ven@@ ant re@@ bel .
cou@@ l@@ son and bro@@ o@@ ks are fighting to have con@@ spir@@ ed with others between october 3 , 2000 and august 9 , 2006 to h@@ ack phones .
mul@@ ca@@ ire , thur@@ l@@ bec@@ k and wea@@ ther@@ up have announced the telephone h@@ acking .
in protest against the planned tax on the empire , french football will indeed be the first strike since 197@@ 2 .
a conciliation meeting will end without results .
in the conflict over the wealth tax , the government and professional football in france have re@@ signed after a failed dispute over the real@@ m tax .
president fran@@ ç@@ o@@ is hol@@ lan@@ de received a speech at the paris é@@ ly@@ s@@ ée palace on thursday , representing associations and members of the association , and also heard their complaints .
he refused to play football from the planned 7@@ 5-@@ percent mar@@ gin .
the other side , too , remained tough .
the strike announced for the end of november will now be passed , the chief of the professional club ( uc@@ p@@ f ) , je@@ an-@@ pi@@ er@@ re lou@@ vel , announced .
the agreement reached between 29 november and 2 december in the li@@ gue 1 and li@@ gue 2 is therefore out .
ge@@ ch@@ ingen : no absolute protection possible
&quot; we want to involve the inhabitants in the planning at an early stage &quot; , opened may@@ or j@@ ens h@@ ä@@ u@@ ß@@ ler the citizens &apos; information event on the flo@@ od protection concept in ge@@ ch@@ ingen .
about 80 participants had arrived in the municip@@ al hall to explain the planned measures , ask questions , express concerns and come up with ideas .
sk@@ id@@ ler made it clear : &quot; the final decisions are made by the members of the local council &quot; .
the floo@@ ds that hit on 15 may 2009 , un@@ prepared , were a dr@@ astic event , which had raised the question of protection measures for the future .
a river bas@@ in survey was conducted with the neighbouring town of a@@ id@@ ling@@ en , which now forms the basis of the flo@@ od protection concept in ge@@ ch@@ ingen .
&quot; the protection of as many buil@@ t-@@ in p@@ lots as possible is the goal , &quot; said h@@ ä@@ u@@ gl@@ er .
the planning is based on the protection against a german weather service statis@@ tically every 100 years expected floo@@ ds .
climate change is being put on the table by a 15 % supple@@ ment .
in experts , this is done with &quot; h@@ q 100@@ ak@@ li@@ ma &quot; .
the water mass@@ es that caused significant damage in ge@@ ch@@ ingen in 2009 amoun@@ ted to a 10@@ 00@@ -@@ year flo@@ od .
&quot; there is no absolute protection , but we can achieve a relative improvement &quot; , says h@@ ä@@ u@@ ß@@ ler .
to protect the h@@ q 100@@ ak@@ li@@ ma , you have to pay around four million euros in g@@ ech@@ ingen , with local grants to the community of about 70 percent .
but chi@@ ef@@ tain pointed out that there is only support if an overall concept is implemented .
the community must therefore be able to count on the participation of the citizens .
a complex planning and approval procedure must be completed .
at best , implementation could begin in 20@@ 16 .
among other things , the protection concept , which was presented in the local council last week ( we reported ) provides for local measures in the influ@@ x of river ir@@ m from the parent valley .
following the presentation of the flo@@ od protection concept , participants took advantage of the opportunity to bring their concerns .
one of the questions raised was why there was no more dam@@ s and back@@ -@@ p@@ ads planned to protect the place .
gre@@ g@@ or k@@ ü@@ hn , the specialist plan@@ ner of the commission@@ ed engineering office wal@@ d and cor@@ be from h@@ ü@@ gel@@ sh@@ ei@@ m , emphasi@@ zed that it is the interaction of all the measures presented that are required to achieve the desired sum .
moreover , it is necessary to find the most econom@@ ical solution , according to jo@@ achi@@ m wal@@ d von wal@@ d and cor@@ be .
dis@@ content re@@ ign@@ ed among the al@@ tor@@ ts ’ li@@ v@@ ing-@@ parties , who , even in normal stor@@ ms , were constantly suffering from over@@ load of the channel network .
the problem is known to the administration and first steps have already been taken .
but the house of comm@@ ons pointed out that the guidelines for channel systems are different from those for flo@@ od prevention and that this should not be mixed up .
the municip@@ ality is obliged to design the channel network in such a way that two to three years of reg@@ ener@@ ation could be overcome .
the se@@ wage channels to be larger would dev@@ our millions .
serious in@@ jur@@ ies after the collapse
on friday afternoon , on the provin@@ cial road 44 near rev@@ ens@@ dorf , two drivers were seriously in@@ ju@@ red in a fron@@ tal col@@ li@@ sion .
the police immediately closed the street completely , but could not say much about the accident .
however , there are various testi@@ mon@@ ies that should be evalu@@ ated first .
what is certain is that the 19 year old guide of a v@@ w golf went towards rev@@ ens@@ dorf and the 3@@ 8-@@ year-@@ old man from ge@@ tt@@ or@@ f met her with his hy@@ un@@ da@@ i .
both vehicles collap@@ sed , with the woman being so hard to hold in , that the fire department needed about half an hour to get her out of the vehicle w@@ rec@@ k .
the actual cause of the accident was not clari@@ fied .
both of them went to nearby hospit@@ als .
the track was closed for about two hours .
he could be called the do@@ sto@@ ev@@ sky of the us .
phili@@ p k. dic@@ k was a god view@@ fin@@ der , a me@@ ta@@ physi@@ c@@ ist , his nov@@ els and nar@@ ra@@ tives also have something ser@@ ial .
the kin@@ ship of the ou@@ ter is amazing : the ste@@ pping eyes , the be@@ ard , the high fore@@ head .
and so , as f@@ jo@@ d@@ or m. do@@ sto@@ je@@ w@@ ski , with his massive o@@ eu@@ vre as founder and apo@@ lo@@ ge@@ e of the russian soul , one reads phili@@ p k. dic@@ k as american pro@@ p@@ he@@ ts .
some tit@@ les have been published by he@@ y@@ ne ver@@ la@@ g , the ha@@ ff@@ man@@ s cas@@ set@@ te with the 1@@ 18 stories is selling two thousand .
dic@@ k explains america - the real@@ m of breathtaking technical progress , cou@@ pled with par@@ an@@ o@@ ia , in@@ security , and belief in being chosen .
dic@@ k had a div@@ ine experience , his late books read like a mix@@ ture of the rev@@ el@@ ation of john and a computer manual .
perhaps he was cra@@ zy , drugs had added to his brain .
he has realized that the computers are di@@ vin@@ ity early on .
he wrote a computer the@@ ology and asked what a person could distingu@@ ish from a machine , the cre@@ ator from his creature .
this is the &apos; bl@@ ade run@@ ner &apos; problem .
that is killing .
a master of science fic@@ tion .
a fantastic writer .
his stories have brought film directors like rid@@ ley scot@@ t , paul ver@@ ho@@ even and ste@@ ven spi@@ el@@ berg together .
this story is now particularly significant .
the &quot; minority report &quot; dates from 195@@ 6 , it ex@@ u@@ des the sm@@ ell of the cold war and the mc@@ car@@ thy tri@@ bun@@ als .
the principle of &apos; pre-@@ crime &apos; is being developed , &apos; pre-@@ crime &apos; , that is , what has become more or less official doc@@ tr@@ ine of the white house .
in dic@@ k &apos;s world , which res@@ emb@@ les our fri@@ ghten@@ ing , mu@@ t@@ ants look to the future - and the police are taking action .
&quot; we collect individuals who have not vio@@ lated any law , &quot; says the head of the authority .
&quot; we gr@@ as@@ p them before they can commit a violent crime .
and : &quot; in our society there are no serious crimin@@ als , for which we have a criminal with pes@@ u@@ do crimin@@ als &quot; , which read flows of time .
they assume that the worst is happening and prevent the criminal thought from being implemented .
dic@@ k &apos;s nar@@ ra@@ tive looks like the blue@@ print for the anti-@@ terrorist laws and the inter@@ ro@@ gation of the n@@ sa .
anticip@@ ation of the attack : this is how obama ’ s dr@@ one philosophy and practice works .
but dic@@ ks story is not over yet .
the chief of the police compla@@ ins that there is no longer any separation of powers , the military controls everyday life - and what remains of the state .
the supervis@@ or will then be monitored and transferred to a future crime .
the system is turning through .
it is perfect , but it lies .
it inv@@ ents its own pre@@ conditions .
does not only accept mistakes and sacrif@@ ices , but buil@@ ds upon them .
the system creates the danger that it is fighting .
reading phili@@ p k. dic@@ k means constantly getting closer to the truth .
late bro@@ thers around mer@@ kel in russia
the former us intelligence expert ed@@ ward snow@@ den could be more critical in the us sp@@ ä@@ ha@@ ff@@ ä@@ re of chancell@@ or ang@@ ela mer@@ kel in his russian asylum .

previously , the green bun@@ de@@ sta@@ g member , han@@ s-@@ christian str@@ ö@@ be@@ le , was the first german politici@@ an to meet snow@@ den in moscow yesterday to discuss the aff@@ air with him .

on the orders of the federal office for constitutional protection and counter@@ -@@ terrorism ( b@@ v@@ t ) , the german internal intelligence service , he should replace the us out@@ post ’ s roof , which is less than 5 km from the european central bank .
according to the german media , the b@@ v@@ t wanted to prove the presence of surveillance an@@ ten@@ n@@ as and the action led to a change of wording between the us and the german foreign ministry in berlin .
james cla@@ pper , us director of national intelligence , re@@ signed in september to the us ’ s failure to provide opportunities for foreign es@@ pi@@ on@@ age , “ to break the trade secre@@ ts of foreign companies on behalf of us corpor@@ ations .
but since ed@@ ward snow@@ den , who was named wh@@ ist@@ le@@ b@@ lower , was dis@@ missed by the publication of his hor@@ n of f@@ ill@@ ings to us surveillance secre@@ ts , european governments and entreprene@@ urs have surely not been sure whether they are .
reports that the us national security agency has been using the braz@@ ili@@ an oil company petro@@ b@@ as and has obtained data from american cl@@ oud providers , including google and y@@ a@@ ho@@ o , have confirmed the company &apos;s operations .
the bar@@ re@@ l of over@@ flow@@ ing revealed that chancell@@ or ang@@ ela mer@@ kel ’ s phone had been sh@@ rou@@ ded , possibly for ten years .
if the most powerful person in europe can be targeted , then it is certain that management is also potential targets .
snow@@ den has strongly supported the close cooperation between us intelligence services and companies .
i believe that it is con@@ cei@@ vable that these data should be used for mutual benefit .
“ germany must wake up , ” explains oli@@ ver green , president of bit@@ mi , the small and medium-sized it companies in germany .
german companies believe that the us was now almost as ris@@ ky as china when it comes to industrial es@@ pi@@ on@@ age and data the@@ ft , a survey conducted in july by the ber@@ at@@ er@@ firm ey .
the snow@@ den le@@ ak@@ ed documents have not yet shown that the european union is not using its trade secre@@ ts to the detri@@ ment of foreign companies .
politicians have expressed concern that certain it and internet opportunities are lacking in the eu and that they are reducing their dependence on the us .
businesses are s@@ cep@@ tical about this .
in the bun@@ de@@ sta@@ g , it was proposed that we should build a german google .
i can only close my eyes and slowly open them again ...
“ that is not how it works , ” says h@@ as@@ so pl@@ att@@ ner , chairman of the german software producer sap .
if we had wanted a strong european it industry , we would not have let it die out 20 years ago .
everything in germany is subsid@@ ised , from coal to cars to agriculture .
everything except the it industry .
yet , reach and technical re@@ fin@@ ement have not changed the range and re@@ fin@@ ement of the us sp@@ y authorities revealed by snow@@ den rev@@ el@@ ations to companies that had previously been the greatest sp@@ ying risk in china .
cl@@ oud compu@@ ting is under@@ going a major change , because european business leaders are now more aware that data stored in the us is not subject to the jurisdiction there , and are therefore potentially at risk .
according to a policy developed by the cl@@ oud security alliance , a trading institution , the eu ’ s financial markets ’ rev@@ el@@ ations of the us data mining act were dis@@ closed with pris@@ m for about 10 % of non-@@ us data processing operations .
j@@ im sn@@ ab@@ e , depu@@ ty managing director of sap , says : “ we see a new question from customers who did not have it a year ago – it is : where will my data be stored and can guarantee it .
many german business leaders believe that the latest reports simply confirm what they already knew .
the fact that economic es@@ pi@@ on@@ age is taking place is no surprise .
that has always been the case .
“ it has been a topic for many years and has not changed fundament@@ ally through the current discussion , ” says kur@@ t bo@@ ck , chairman of the chemical company bas@@ f .
the americans are sp@@ ying us on the commercial and industrial level , as we are doing , because it is in the national interest to defend our companies .
corporate governance is not normally bo@@ a@@ sting about the re@@ medi@@ es that have been taken , because that gives att@@ ack@@ ers advantages .
in large companies , employees have long been convinced that taking a free usb stick on a trade fair or un@@ attended song is not a problem .
ul@@ rich h@@ ack@@ en@@ ber@@ k , member of the board of directors of au@@ di car manufacturers , says that it has been a standard practice for years to ga@@ ther mobile phones before a board meeting , so that they cannot be used as e@@ av@@ es@@ dro@@ pp@@ ers .
the german b@@ v@@ t advis@@ es managers to use simple prepa@@ id phones when they are travelling abroad , because smart cards are not likely to be com@@ promised .
the prepa@@ id phones are thro@@ wn away afterwards .
however , there is concern that small and medium-sized enterprises are vulnerable to h@@ acking and surveillance .
in germany , many of these companies are world market leaders in their respective nic@@ he markets .
“ small and medium-sized enterprises often lack the experience , staff and financial resources to effectively protect business secre@@ ts against un@@ authorized access , ” the b@@ v@@ t war@@ ns in a report .
the us is warning its own companies against economic es@@ pi@@ on@@ age by other countries .
according to washington post , the us national intelligence esti@@ m@@ ate killed france , russia , and israel in february , second place behind china , among the countries that committed to acqu@@ iring economic data for h@@ ack@@ ings .
a member of the board of a german blue chi@@ p company agreed to es@@ pi@@ on@@ age , then “ are the french the worst ” .
bern@@ ard squ@@ ar@@ cin@@ i , former head of the french home secretary d@@ cr@@ l , was inter@@ viewed this month in an interview , saying : “ the intelligence services know very well that all countries , even if they fight against ter@@ re@@ stri@@ al .

parents of a te@@ en@@ ager from georgia who died in a tragic accident believe in murder and death .
the te@@ en@@ ager &apos;s parents , whose body is found in a ro@@ lled r@@ ing@@ er@@ mat@@ te in the gym of his high school , are convinced that their son was mur@@ dered , the law@@ yer of the family explained .
k@@ end@@ ric@@ k jo@@ hn@@ son from val@@ do@@ sta in the state of the united states of georgia was arrested on 11 january in a u@@ pri@@ ght m@@ at , which was placed behind the grand@@ stand in the school gym .
the sh@@ eri@@ ff ’ s investi@@ ga@@ tive officers from low@@ n@@ des county concluded that jo@@ hn@@ son was not at fault in a tragic accident , which the family of the 17@@ -@@ year-@@ old doub@@ ted .
&quot; they are convinced that their son was mur@@ dered , &quot; said ben@@ jam@@ in cr@@ um@@ p , the law@@ yer of ken@@ ne@@ th and jac@@ qu@@ el@@ y@@ n jo@@ hn@@ son , to fo@@ x@@ new@@ s.@@ com@@ .
they would never have believed that he had died as the sh@@ eri@@ ff had tor@@ n .
&quot; they believe that there is no logic in oppos@@ ing the laws of physi@@ cs and of healthy living .
rather , be convinced that the truth is conce@@ aled to protect the person or persons responsible for the death of their son .
&quot; your son went to school and came back in the bag of cor@@ p@@ ses , &quot; he comm@@ ented .
us prosecu@@ tor michael mo@@ ore said on thursday that a formal investigation into the death of jo@@ hn@@ son would take place , as a number of important issues have not yet been clari@@ fied .
what was the cause of death ?
is his death a crime ?
mo@@ ore explained this at a press conference on thursday afternoon .
i follow the facts , in whatever direction they take .
my aim is to find out the truth .
“ i believe that a sufficient basis for formal investigation is in place , ” he said .
mo@@ ore told re@@ porters that the initial au@@ top@@ sy suggests that jo@@ hn@@ son was not interested in the consequences of a “ posi@@ tion-@@ related suff@@ oc@@ ation . ”
a second au@@ top@@ sy , however , caused another death , according to mo@@ ore .
“ there are a number of questions that need to be answered or confirmed , ” he said .
mo@@ ore added , if there is sufficient evidence for criminal or civil law investigation of the death of jo@@ hn@@ son , i will not use the f@@ bi for carrying out the investigation .
a representative of the county sh@@ eri@@ ff authority was in response to our request on thursday not immediately ready to comment .
a court in southern georgia ordered on wednesday that the authorities should review all watch videos .
the te@@ en@@ ager parents said they hoped that the video rec@@ ord@@ ings contained indic@@ ations of how he died .
c@@ dc publish aller@@ gy aller@@ gy guidelines for schools
on wednesday , the centers for disease control and prevention published a report on the implementation of a new directive on the prevention of food aller@@ gies by children .
these are the first such directives that the us administration issued , as the number of scho@@ ol@@ -@@ age children with food aller@@ gies is rising .
one in 20 children in the united states now has food aller@@ gy .
the spread of food aller@@ gies among children has increased by 18 % , according to the c@@ dc , between 1997 and 2007 .
the guidelines contain information for schools that raise awareness of food aller@@ gies to the teacher and the staff and how to deal with children who have aller@@ gic re@@ actions .
it is also recommended that schools have ep@@ in@@ ep@@ hr@@ in in stock – the auto injec@@ tion of the brand e@@ pi@@ pen is used most frequently – to prevent potentially fat@@ al hyper@@ -@@ sensi@@ tivity .
the legisl@@ ators in the states have recently changed the rules to make schools ep@@ ine@@ ph@@ or@@ ine easier to hold .
the report also contains a list of typical symp@@ t@@ oms that are mentioned by children who have an aller@@ gic reaction .
children may say , “ it feels like something is pus@@ hing my ton@@ gue , ” “ my ton@@ gue feels like a child ’ s hair is lying on it ” or “ my ton@@ gue cri@@ b@@ bel@@ t ” .
parents of inter@@ sexual children can choose “ gender in@@ defin@@ ite ”
germany is the first european nation to have a third sex for children who are suffering from un@@ certain gen@@ ital gen@@ ital conditions .
new@@ born children are no longer ad@@ dic@@ ted to rigi@@ d male or female .
under the new law , parents no longer have to declare gender for such children , but can be “ un@@ determined ” or “ not determined ” on the birth certificate .
the aim of the law is to remove the pressure from parents to avoid making ha@@ sty decisions on operations for sexual orientation .
according to the bb@@ c , an inter@@ sexual person said years later : “ i am neither man nor woman . ”
i remain the pat@@ ch@@ work created by doctors , mu@@ ti@@ lated and full of sc@@ ars .
it is estimated that one in 2 000 children does not come into the world as young or as girls every year .
they are among the inter@@ sexual , a group that has been diagno@@ sed with “ sexual differenti@@ ation dis@@ order ” ( d@@ s@@ d ) , a concept of a collective for people with at@@ y@@ pical ch@@ ro@@ mo@@ som@@ es , ger@@ ms .
wall@@ is simp@@ son may have been inter@@ sexual .
understanding gender identification is still not very well developed , but most experts in the us suggest that you use the best available information to identify the gender .
the new york psy@@ chi@@ at@@ ris@@ t dr. j@@ ack dres@@ cher , who speci@@ ali@@ zes in the issue of gender identification , said that the new german law “ k@@ ling@@ e for a good thing ” .
inter@@ sexual children are an ethical dil@@ em@@ ma .
&quot; some people have life@@ -@@ threat@@ ening diseases that require sur@@ g@@ ical intervention , but for most children the same is not true , &quot; he said .
you can assi@@ gn sex without sur@@ gery and then wait to see how identity develops .
scientific data on how a child develops his or her gender identity is not very precise .
no one knows why it is happening .
it is like the secret why people are hom@@ os@@ ex@@ ual .
in a report to the european commission in 2011 , it is said that inter@@ sexual people are affected by trans@@ gender or trans@@ gender people , because their status is not gender .
these characteristics were reflected in sub@@ ordin@@ ate sexual characteristics such as mus@@ cle mass , hair , bre@@ asts and stat@@ ure , priority sexual characteristics , and sexual characteristics such as reproduction org@@ ans and gen@@ it@@ als .
the report also gives an overview of the discrimination that inter@@ sexual and trans@@ gender people face in their professional lives and the extent of har@@ ass@@ ment , violence and pre@@ jud@@ ice .
the young people who do not agree with the gender picture now have a special camp .
in the meantime , it is possible for adults in australia and ne@@ pal to access official documents by male , female , or “ third sex . ”
in june , austr@@ ali@@ an nor@@ ri@@ e may wel@@ by ( 52 ) was chosen as the world ’ s first “ g@@ end@@ er-@@ free ” person after a court had called for life@@ time maintenance of “ un@@ defined ” gender status .
the german identity cards have a third as@@ sign@@ ment , x for inter@@ sexual , in addition to m and w , in the future .
in neighbouring france , gender issues are still controversial , as a news story on fran@@ ce-@@ 24 .
in 2011 , do@@ z@@ ens of french members of the strictly catho@@ lic country signed a peti@@ tion that the “ gender theory ” should be removed from school books .
the us catho@@ lic online website has also opposed the german law on the grounds that “ if the world is in a new state , where the sex is a decision , then sex is a decision , but not sexual activity , then it is two more .
the mother of a new@@ born from mar@@ y@@ land told her about baby zone , she would find it better if bab@@ ies were to be assigned a gender at birth .
“ paren@@ tal life is already stret@@ ched and stres@@ s@@ ful without any further restrictions , especially when you look at the sex of your child , ” she said to the parents ’ website .
children need stability and security .
histor@@ ically , children who have been treated with both male and female gen@@ ital parts were treated as her@@ ma@@ ph@@ ro@@ di@@ tes , according to which attractive greek god , who had both sex@@ es , was born .
as recently as ten years ago , medicine regarded gender as something that could be wi@@ ped out and then re@@ built .
but the ethical foundations of an operation are now being ques@@ tioned , now that it is known how complex the gender identity is , and that doctors can be wrong because they do not know how the child can develop with the inf@@ ant when it gro@@ ws up .
“ in the middle of the tw@@ enti@@ eth century , one was called “ psy@@ chi@@ at@@ ric emergency , ” said dres@@ cher .
when such a child was born , it was not the psy@@ chi@@ at@@ ris@@ t who was called , but the sur@@ ge@@ on .
the prevail@@ ing theory about the treatment of children with un@@ equi@@ vo@@ cal gen@@ it@@ als goes back to dr. john money of jo@@ hn@@ s ho@@ p@@ k@@ ins university , who argu@@ ed that gender is form@@ able .
he co@@ ined the term “ gender identity ” and argu@@ ed that social and environmental stimul@@ us – as parents have been educ@@ ating a child – inter@@ acted with gen@@ es and hor@@ mon@@ es of a child and thus shaped the child .
but in a report known as “ john / jo@@ an ” in 196@@ 6 , his the@@ ories were controversial and controversial .
he called upon the parents of a boy whose pen@@ is had been cut off from a bo@@ iled circum@@ ci@@ sion to kill the child al@@ together and also to keep his te@@ stic@@ les removed and then to bring him up as a girl .
“ money presented this case as a successful example of transformation , but it was not , ” says dres@@ cher .
when the boy was about 15 , he swit@@ ched back to the male sex and married a woman .
but he was su@@ ici@@ dal when he was 38 .
according to dres@@ cher , there are still doctors who would practice this model .
but , in the 1990 ’ s , with the internet , survi@@ v@@ ors of these gender operations became public , the “ un@@ happy with the outcome . ”
for example , j@@ im bru@@ ce , a 3@@ 6-@@ year-@@ old author from mon@@ tan@@ a who worked with x@@ y-@@ male ch@@ ro@@ mo@@ som@@ es , but who was ambigu@@ ous gen@@ it@@ als .
the doctors were un@@ clear about whether he was a big cl@@ it@@ or@@ is or a small pen@@ is , and were convinced that he could never have a “ satisfactory life ” as a man .
so his external or@@ gan and the te@@ stic@@ les were sur@@ ge@@ on removed shortly after birth in 197@@ 6 and he was raised as a girl .
at the age of 12 he received female hor@@ mon@@ es .
&quot; i knew i am not a girl , &quot; he explained to ab@@ c@@ news@@ .com that i am a girl .
i was unfortunate , but it was really difficult to ask questions .
at the age of 18 he should be given a v@@ ag@@ inal plastic .
but , since he was de@@ pressed , and knew that something was wrong , he demanded his medical records .
what he found out was sho@@ cking .
i was ster@@ ili@@ zed at my birth – and nobody ever told me .
bru@@ ce was born with a ds@@ d that could not bring te@@ sto@@ ster@@ on enough to develop gen@@ it@@ als .
after learning the truth , he changed to male identity , received te@@ sto@@ ster@@ on-@@ injec@@ tions , and became his bre@@ asts .
the operation has made it inf@@ er@@ tile .
today he is fighting for others in an organization called interface project to ensure that inter@@ sexual people are per@@ ceived as normal .
but anne tam@@ ar@@ -@@ mat@@ tis , managing director of the california law group ad@@ vo@@ cat@@ es for in@@ for@@ med@@ . she is also responsible for the lack of information on the german law .
“ many activi@@ sts are wor@@ ried that the german decision could encourage parents to take quick decisions and give the child “ not fixed ” , she explained .
we fear that this will encourage intervention .
we think it would be better to have male or female sex and then wait .
but we do not yet know what the impact of the law will be , so we can only spec@@ ulate .
tam@@ ar@@ -@@ mat@@ tis said that her organization supports the austr@@ ali@@ an law , because “ it allows adults to be recognized as a third gender . ”
“ adults should be able to make their own decisions about their legal sex , ” she said .
the german law is about the allocation at birth .
this is not a fight to force small children at this time .
if you are grown up , you can decide for yourself about your body .
but dr ar@@ len@@ e bar@@ at@@ z , a brus@@ sel@@ s-@@ based physi@@ o@@ log@@ ist from pit@@ ts@@ burg , who had a daughter with a sexual differenti@@ ation dis@@ order and had supported hundreds of others in a self-@@ help group , says .
k@@ ati@@ e , the daughter of bar@@ at@@ z , was born with male ch@@ ro@@ mo@@ som@@ es , but has a ds@@ d called complete and@@ ro@@ id resistance .
due to the recep@@ tor def@@ ect of the target cells for te@@ sto@@ ster@@ on , k@@ ati@@ e developed female characteristics .
it has a v@@ ag@@ ina , but no u@@ ter@@ us and no ov@@ aries .
today is k@@ ati@@ e 29 and married ; she works at the university of pen@@ n@@ sy@@ l@@ v@@ ania as a collabor@@ ator in the psy@@ chi@@ at@@ ry of children .
it is inf@@ er@@ tile , but hopes to be able to protect a child through adoption or sur@@ ro@@ gate mother .
“ the law gives parents room , which means that they do not have to make ha@@ sty decisions , ” said bar@@ at@@ z .
it gives you the time to do various tests and to clarify matters and gives you time to be “ male ” or “ female ” .
in this way everything is in order – you can take your child big and love it .
you have a wonderful baby and enjoy paren@@ tal happ@@ iness .
and you do not have to rus@@ h into an operation that can no longer be un@@ done .
“ this includes children in the decision and elimin@@ ates the fear that parents are being driven around because they think that they would not do the right thing , ” she explained .
ultimately , the child deci@@ des on the gender that su@@ its him better – and that is wonderful .
this will enable children to make the decision themselves .
unknown in@@ jur@@ ies in@@ j@@ ure girls by shot
unknown people have a 12@@ -@@ year-@@ old in sa@@ x@@ on an@@ hal@@ t in sho@@ cks from a car .
the perpe@@ tr@@ ators probably had a lu@@ min@@ ous weapon on a group of children in gen@@ th@@ . on thursday evening , they were fi@@ red with an air pressure weapon .
the police told us that in burg .
the girl was slightly in@@ ju@@ red at the left w@@ ade .
rescue workers brought the girl to the hospital .
the shot came from a small car that was passing by a group of six children and suddenly stopped .
wit@@ nesses saw two people sitting in the car .
the perpe@@ tr@@ ators also shot on a bus stop .
a dis@@ c bro@@ ke .
they then dro@@ ve from it .
the criminal police investig@@ ated , it was said on friday .
until now , the police inspection team can expect k@@ emp@@ ten to have a quiet hal@@ lo@@ ween night .
officials were only given two cases of eg@@ g workers who had war@@ ned them against house fac@@ ades .
as home@@ owners recognized this in time and removed the iron stra@@ in immediately , no material damage should have been done .
the city also has a number of new year &apos;s eve b@@ alls , but there is no material damage .
a bis@@ hop friendly or@@ fer@@ -@@ we@@ g resid@@ ent reported that his car was wra@@ pped in a p@@ at paper and that his wheel decor@@ ative ap@@ er@@ tures were sto@@ len .
until the police arrived , the man has kept his wheel decor@@ ations close to all , so the police can not continue to work .
living with a future
wal@@ tr@@ au@@ d ries actually lives dream .
your house is located in a quiet residential area of stutt@@ gart with a lot of green , an old tree population , nice neighb@@ ors and not too much traffic .
the city is just a few minutes away by public transport .
&quot; i hope you don &apos;t fear sp@@ id@@ ers ? &quot; , as@@ ks wal@@ tr@@ au@@ d ries and points to a f@@ at spi@@ der at the door .
i have been looking for a new apartment for my hus@@ band and myself for some time .
but you know how difficult it is in stutt@@ gart .
the reason for this is not spi@@ der@@ pho@@ bia , but the concern to move the many steps to the house and the apartment in the old age from the beginning , explains it .
moreover , since a men@@ is@@ c@@ us operation , the mid@@ d@@ le-@@ fif@@ ties have had to learn at their own per@@ il what it means to deal with handic@@ ap from floor to floor .
recently , she published a book on &quot; happy living in old age - what form of living is the best for me ? &quot; .
&apos;@@ our apartment is the best example of what is not possible in old age &apos; , she begins to tell .
when she was with her hus@@ band in the ma@@ is@@ on@@ ette apartment more than 20 years ago , it was simply a beautiful apartment in the middle of the green .
today with fif@@ ty center thin@@ ks wal@@ tr@@ au@@ d ries differently about it .
but she also knows that she is one of the few people who even deal with the issue of &apos; living in old age &apos; .
most people are squ@@ ee@@ zing it out as long as it is possible .
only the others , &quot; she says , sm@@ ile .
only when the pressure of suffering is really great do you worry .
&apos;@@ then it may be too late , &apos; says ries .
in her book , interior architec@@ t presents 17 models of living for self-@@ determined living in old age .
&apos;@@ whatever form of living you choose , however , is always an individual choice &apos; , explains it .
d i e solution there is not for age .
even those who have reti@@ red in tus@@ c@@ any or brit@@ t@@ any should always be aware that the age of reti@@ rement may also be si@@ ck .
and : &apos; without good knowledge of the language of the country , you can also un@@ ite in dol@@ ce vit@@ a , &apos; the specialist book author points out that she is willing to leave .
among their models are classic care models , alternative forms of housing or the often quo@@ ted pen@@ sion@@ er w@@ g .
at old age , everyone has his tic@@ ks and ma@@ k@@ eu@@ p , so everyone can have their tic@@ ks and ma@@ k@@ eu@@ p .
&apos;@@ for me , such a community of d@@ well@@ ers would be nothing &apos; , she means with an eye win@@ ker .
not like a student w@@ g with a shared bathroom and a kitchen .
&quot; in old age , you just need your re@@ treat rooms , &quot; says ries .
the fact that a residential senior can still work is something that the author does not want to rule out .
this would then have to be different from the classic student club .
and sometimes you just want your peace , &apos; she believes .
it is not alone in the capital of the country , at least .
&apos;@@ most of the old people in stutt@@ gart want to stay in their own home as long as possible &apos; is also the experience of the@@ res@@ a r@@ ü@@ t@@ ten , the head of the civil service life at the age of the state capital .
your department advis@@ es people on the subject of &apos; getting older &apos; .
that is why it is the elderly who would often accept in@@ convenience and constra@@ ints , just to stay in their familiar surroundings , that is the foundation ’ s experience of product testing .
there are many ways to reach the house or apartment without barriers today .
ries recomm@@ ends that all those who are interested in the re@@ building of their house or apartment , should first get in-@@ depth information and not be the first cra@@ ft@@ sman .
today , there are also specialists for the re@@ building of the old age .
even in the rental apartment let yourself realize one or two things , and if there is only the toilet seat increase , the interior designer clari@@ fies .
but the existing apartment cannot always be ren@@ ted in a way that is suitable for the elderly and therefore accessible , even if it is so beautiful .
wal@@ tr@@ au@@ d ries had to make this experience .
the room was very small and the bathroom was very small .
she will continue to search until she finds the ideal object for her@@ self and her hus@@ band .
before moving , you are gre@@ edy more than before the spi@@ der on your home door .
the usa wants to prosecu@@ te snow@@ den further
the us has changed its stance on former us intelligence official ed@@ ward snow@@ den .
he is still accused of dis@@ semin@@ ating un@@ authorised secret information .
he must therefore face criminal proceedings in the united states , said the us state secretary , j@@ enni@@ fer p@@ sa@@ ki , in washington .
the recent statements by snow@@ den would not change this either .
previously , the german green politici@@ an han@@ s-@@ christian str@@ ö@@ be@@ le had a meeting with snow@@ den in moscow to appeal to the us not to pun@@ ish him any further .
p@@ sa@@ ki emphasi@@ zed that str@@ ingent statements are those of a parliam@@ ent@@ arian and not those of a german government member .
intelligence en@@ th@@ ü@@ ller ed@@ ward snow@@ den is always ready to talk to german authorities .
first , however , he wants to know his situation .
that is what the former n@@ sa employee sought by the us in an un@@ addressed letter that the green politici@@ an han@@ s-@@ christian h@@ ö@@ l@@ be@@ le sent to the european parliament on friday after a meeting with snow@@ den and sent to the federal government .
the letter has been published after a str@@ ö@@ be@@ le translation :
to the competent authorities
i have been asked to write to you about your investigation into mass surveillance .
i am named ed@@ ward joseph snow@@ den and used to be contrac@@ ted or directly employed as technical expert at the national security agency ( n@@ s@@ c ) , which is the central intelligence agency ( cia ) and the national security agency ( cia ) .
as i worked in these institutions , i witn@@ essed systematic violations of the law by my government , which led me to act out of a moral duty .
as a result of the publication of these concerns , i have been subjec@@ ted to a serious and persi@@ stent s@@ ore which has forced me to leave my family and my home .
i live in ex@@ ile and enjoy temporary asylum , which i have received from the russian federation under international law .
i am encouraged by the response to my political actions , both in the united states and elsewhere .
citizens all over the world , and also senior officials - including the united states - have made the rev@@ el@@ ations a system of all-@@ en@@ comp@@ ass@@ ing surveillance that nobody is accoun@@ table as a service to the public .
these es@@ pi@@ on@@ age rev@@ el@@ ations brought many proposals for new laws and directives based on the previously hidden abuse of public confidence in the european union .
the benefits to society from these findings are becoming increasingly clear , while the costs of taking these risks have been vi@@ sibly reduced .
although the result of my efforts has been demonstr@@ ably positive , my dis@@ s@@ ens government continues to treat dis@@ sent as a breach of faith and to crimin@@ alise political expression and prosecu@@ te it .
yet to speak the truth is not a crime .
i am confident that the united states government , with the support of the international community , will take this harmful attitude .
i hope that , if the difficulties of this humanitarian situation are resolved , i will be able to participate in the responsible clari@@ fication of the issues relating to the actions taken in the media , particularly with regard to truth and authentic@@ ity .
i look forward to a meeting with you in your country as soon as the situation is resolved and thank you for your efforts to up@@ hold international law that protec@@ ts us all .

&quot; the building is in good hands &quot; , says w@@ inter@@ ling@@ en &apos;s may@@ or michael ma@@ i@@ er .
the former kin@@ der@@ gar@@ ten in the garden street sold the commun@@ e to a private person .

the building changed its owner at a &quot; reasonable &quot; price .

the budget was eur 100 000 .
it is not yet clear how the new owner will use the former kin@@ der@@ gar@@ ten .
the may@@ or is right that w@@ inter@@ ling@@ en should take responsibility for the building before winter to someone else and thus no longer be responsible for the entertainment of the house , how to heat , after the garden and to look for the garden .

report : obama campaign considered to replace bi@@ den by h@@ ill@@ ary clin@@ ton .
president bar@@ ack obama ’ s clo@@ s@@ est advis@@ ers have secre@@ tly con@@ tem@@ pla@@ ted supporting vice-president jo@@ e bi@@ den in the 2012 election campaign with h@@ ill@@ ary clin@@ ton , the new york times .
the rev@@ el@@ ation is the most remarkable surprise of the long-@@ awa@@ ited work of mark hal@@ per@@ in and john he@@ il@@ em@@ ann about the 2012 election campaign , “ double down : game change ” .
the times is a copy of the book that will be published soon and she reported on thursday evening that the book had been published by the president ’ s top advis@@ ers “ at the end of 2011 ” to find out .
according to jon@@ a@@ than martin , national political correspon@@ dent of times , the book thoroughly describes the history of the campaign ’ s efforts by leading officials and the white house , notably the former white house chief of staff .
the potential change was a strictly guar@@ ded secret within the campaign infrastructure in chic@@ ago and the o@@ val office .
only half a do@@ zen of the president ’ s clo@@ s@@ est advis@@ ers – including dal@@ ey , the former campaign leader obama , j@@ im mess@@ ina , and the former white house leader , david ax@@ el@@ ro@@ d , and david p@@ loo@@ t .
in double down , dal@@ ey claims to have been at the fore@@ front of efforts to protect bi@@ den despite her “ close , personal relationship ” , before being able to resi@@ st such a box .
in an interview with martin , dal@@ ey confirmed that the government had indeed considered replac@@ ing bi@@ den with clin@@ ton .
“ i said a whole series of things to consider , and that was one of them , ” dal@@ ey told the magazine .
it is worth re@@ member@@ ing that the president had terrible po@@ ll figures at the time , so we thought : “ for god &apos;s sake , what are we doing ? ”
while dal@@ ey described the investigations as “ due d@@ ili@@ gence , ” martin told an@@ der@@ son co@@ op@@ er of c@@ n@@ n that during the campaign for re-@@ election considerable effort had been made to find out whether such a thing was possible .
“ campaigns do not spend so much money on po@@ lls and focus groups unless they are seriously thinking about something , ” martin on ac@@ 3@@ 60 .
but it is not clear whether obama knew that his team had an exchange in mind .
martin said to c@@ n@@ n that he asked dal@@ ey if his then bo@@ ss had been informed about the potential change .
although dal@@ ey explained that he did not believe that the president was “ aware ” of the possible change , the former chief of staff ad@@ mitted that it was “ possible ” that obama knew it .
martin added that “ double down ” is not a defini@@ tive answer to the question of whether the political pro@@ tests of obama ’ s desk had reached .
co@@ op@@ er asked martin if he seriously think obama has not known anything about the investigation of whether bi@@ den was to be dro@@ pped in the election .
“ possible , ” martin rep@@ lied .
what happens on the way with my email ?
e-mail actually means electronic mail .
was used in the design of the internet service email similar to conventional mail techn@@ ically trans@@ posed the letter secret ?
in the concep@@ tion of early internet services , the focus was on making communication possible .
that is why the basic technical proto@@ col@@ s have not been careful to establish a stable basis for hear@@ ing-@@ safe correspon@@ dence .
therefore , a conventional e-mail correspon@@ ds more to an open post@@ card than a se@@ aled letter .
if user &quot; anna &quot; an &quot; ben@@ ni &quot; sen@@ ds an email , the hosts of the two are connected directly ?
anna sch@@ ick@@ t ’ s email program or browser will first send the mail to the mail server of your service provider .
for example , if you have a g@@ mail account , it would be g@@ mail .
this mail server sen@@ ds the content to the provider that ben@@ ni uses .
on the track , mail can be sent via several other servers on the internet .
ben@@ ni@@ e can then call the content from his provider .
if conventional e-@@ ma@@ ils are read through your web site ?
most ma@@ ils are sent several times by software robo@@ ts on the way .
the provider of the sen@@ der usually checks whether the mail is a mal@@ icious program as an att@@ ach@@ ment .
on the recei@@ ver systems , a virus check is also carried out .
in addition , the providers check whether this is a trou@@ bl@@ es@@ ome and un@@ wanted sp@@ am mail that is deleted immediately or at least removed in a sp@@ am folder .
if the robo@@ ts have another task , do they have to do it ?
for systems like g@@ mail , the robo@@ t also determin@@ es the information google needs to place context advertising .
if anna and ben@@ ni are communic@@ ating via g@@ mail about their upcoming holiday trip , google can show relevant links to holiday offers .
read the em@@ ail@@ s also by unknown people ?
the prob@@ ability that un@@ authorized persons read an email is extremely small .
in theory , however , this is possible .
in companies , administr@@ ators often have the option of reading electronic mail .
the law enforcement agencies and secret services also have legal means of inter@@ cep@@ ting or taking note of e-@@ ma@@ ils .
in addition , there are possible illegal sp@@ ying actions .
is it possible to protect e-@@ ma@@ ils against reading ?
with an encry@@ ption according to the open@@ p@@ g@@ p standard , an email can be encry@@ p@@ ted effectively against reading .
with a high technical effort , it is also possible to hide the met@@ ad@@ ata of an email communication , so that it is not even easy to recognize who has communic@@ ated with whom .
how important are y@@ a@@ ho@@ o and google on the email market in germany ?
the main priv@@ ately used mail@@ boxes are y@@ a@@ ho@@ o and google , according to a survey by con@@ vi@@ os consulting from august 2013 , playing only a minor role .
while the shares of y@@ a@@ ho@@ o mail had fallen last , g@@ mail could increase significantly from google .
mother in the forest is dis@@ gu@@ ised and reti@@ rement is paid .
when his be@@ loved mother died , a man from wol@@ f@@ sburg wrote a plan .
he bur@@ ied the dead in a forest - and continued to collect their pension and care@@ rs .
to continue to receive pensions and care benefits , a 6@@ 7-@@ year-@@ old wol@@ f@@ s@@ bur@@ ger has left his dead mother after police investigation in the forest .
he first saw the death of the 8@@ 9-@@ year-@@ ol@@ ds , then he spent the money for more than a year and a half .
now , the 67 year-@@ old must answer for fraud , as a speaker said on friday .
so the man hi@@ d the woman in a forest near hel@@ m@@ ste@@ dt .
the man was susp@@ ected in may : it was then that the care needs of the mother had no medic@@ ation needed .
the pen@@ sion@@ ers told the investig@@ ators that their mother had travell@@ ed to spain .
because officials were strange , they continued to determine .
the two had been in a common flat for more than 15 years and he had been maintaining them .
the 67 year old finally gave birth to his mother .
the police said that an ob@@ duc@@ tion did not provide any evidence of a capital crime .
would you like to have ice cre@@ am that sh@@ ines in the dark ?
a british entreprene@@ ur has taken the first ice cre@@ am in the dark , with the help of j@@ ell@@ y@@ fish .
char@@ lie franc@@ is made the flu@@ o@@ res@@ cent properties of marine animals use and sho@@ ot them into a lu@@ min@@ ous delic@@ acy .
the idea came to him after reading a research on qu@@ al@@ ms and convinc@@ ing chinese scientists to use the lu@@ min@@ ous prote@@ in arti@@ fici@@ ally .
the ice cre@@ am re@@ acts with the ton@@ gue in the process of consumption , raising the ph value in the prote@@ in and tri@@ g@@ ger@@ ing the light .
chr@@ is explains that the ice cre@@ am respon@@ ds to the war@@ m@@ th in the mouth and lu@@ min@@ air@@ e – the more you lic@@ k , the bri@@ ghter it becomes .
char@@ lie , founder of the ice cre@@ am company &quot; lic@@ k me i &apos;m delicious &quot; , says : &quot; the product is incredible , but still in a very early production phase , and so you get two gram@@ s for two gram@@ s &quot; .
the prote@@ in used in the ice cre@@ am re@@ acts with the ton@@ gue at a neutral ph value .
when the mouth war@@ ms the prote@@ in , the ph value and the ice g@@ lows .
we have tested it over the last few months and we thought it was ideal to test it in hal@@ lo@@ ween , because it would not be possible to achieve this wonderful lu@@ min@@ ance effect .
it is probably the most expensive ice cre@@ am i have ever produced , because the qu@@ al@@ le lu@@ min@@ air@@ e is four times more expensive than gold .
each ball costs me about 1@@ 40 p@@ ounds .
but it tas@@ tes delicious for that .
char@@ lies experim@@ ental company based in bri@@ st@@ ol is famous for its unusual flav@@ ors , including bi@@ er , cheese , and r@@ in@@ se meat .
but his latest creation is to become even more ambitious .
he says , “ i would like to develop an invi@@ sible ice cre@@ am . ”
this is in itself impossible because of the break@@ down in light caused by the ice cryst@@ als from which ice cre@@ am is made ; but i susp@@ ect we will find a way to achieve it .
the ice cre@@ am uses the flu@@ o@@ res@@ cent properties of a qu@@ al@@ ine that is arti@@ fici@@ ally produced by chinese scientists .
the ts@@ v mor@@ sum is still out of the reach of every point in the hand@@ ball league after six days of the match .
it is now the very time for ing@@ o e@@ h@@ lers &apos; team to join the der@@ by against the ts@@ v da@@ ver@@ den , who celebrated his first victory last weekend .
with this game the season begins again for us .
&quot; i hope that we have finally got our head free , &quot; e@@ h@@ ler &apos;s behavior is optim@@ istic .
he finally got the chance to do so , except for the permanently in@@ ju@@ red h@@ end@@ ri@@ k blo@@ h@@ me .
like us , this is also a game of speed .
we therefore need to keep our error rate low .
however , the first thing we need to do is to increase coverage , which , at the end of the day , has left far from a certain impression .
da@@ ver@@ ns co@@ ach thomas pan@@ it@@ z is much more relaxed after the first season &apos;s victory against n@@ ord@@ hor@@ n .
the game was of course a house number .
but that &apos;s why we &apos;re far from the favourite , because everything can always happen in the der@@ by .
pan@@ it@@ z , however , now wants to em@@ ulate mor@@ sum in order to launch a series .
j@@ od@@ at is missing .
the a-@@ you@@ th@@ ful jo@@ o@@ st wind@@ swe@@ ise , who is playing at the a-@@ ju@@ g@@ end@@ -@@ bun@@ des@@ lig@@ ist h@@ c bre@@ men with double gaming law , is celebr@@ ating his seas@@ onal de@@ but .

hal@@ lo@@ ween 2013 :
when i was small , hal@@ lo@@ ween had something mag@@ ical .
my si@@ ster and i were allowed to eat s@@ wee@@ ts , stop late and d@@ ress up for the neighbourhood .
today i am more a hal@@ lo@@ ween mu@@ ff@@ le .
over the last two years , i have not agreed to take s@@ wee@@ ts from my home and i think that this year will not .
but , according to statistics , i am a black she@@ ep when it comes to hal@@ lo@@ ween .
the majority of americans – 15@@ 8 million to be precise – are celebr@@ ating hal@@ lo@@ ween this year , spending a total of $ 6.@@ 9 billion on s@@ wee@@ ts , cost@@ umes , and decor@@ ations , according to the us association of organizations .
one thing i can focus on every hal@@ lo@@ ween then is the trend values .
the cost@@ umes will cost about 1.@@ 2 billion of the $ 6.@@ 9 billion spent , according to the n@@ r@@ f .
this year , exciting , un@@ anim@@ ate items are the last cr@@ y .
women no longer need to wear sex@@ y clothes , they can now also enjoy se@@ duc@@ tive food such as piz@@ za , ham@@ bur@@ gers or car@@ ro@@ ts .
as far as men are concerned , i expect a lot of z@@ om@@ b@@ ies thanks to the walking dead , and i bet that the da@@ f@@ t-@@ pun@@ k world space men will put it into the inst@@ ag@@ ram fe@@ eds this year .
according to google , the most sought after cost@@ umes are z@@ om@@ b@@ ies , bat@@ man , pi@@ rates and wit@@ ches .
i susp@@ ect that there is nothing wrong with tradition .
last year we had our dogs dres@@ sed up and so i was surprised not only .
indeed , americans spend $ 3@@ 30 million this year on cost@@ umes for pe@@ ts , according to the n@@ r@@ f .
these are a lot of hot dogs .
as far as s@@ wee@@ ts are concerned , we are not cr@@ amp@@ ed .
americans will spend $ 1.@@ 9 billion this year , according to the ni@@ el@@ sen company .
that is about 2@@ 70 million kil@@ o@@ gram@@ s of chocolate , suc@@ kers , c@@ and@@ y and rubber bears .
so good news for the us department of commerce , according to 41 million people who are tr@@ app@@ ed by the s@@ wee@@ ts or aci@@ ds saying .
in fact , we will have over 40 million kil@@ o@@ gram@@ s of chocolate for hal@@ lo@@ ween and – let us not fo@@ ol ourselves – food .
the only thing we do not want to con@@ sume is the su@@ gar@@ -@@ sweet c@@ and@@ y cor@@ n ; yet , 15 million kil@@ o@@ gram@@ s of it are sold hal@@ lo@@ ween , the national association of conf@@ ec@@ tion@@ ery producers .
that is about nine billion ma@@ ize bodies .
it is a myster@@ y that i have not yet been able to resolve .
nothing is more hal@@ lo@@ ween than houses where it is sp@@ uc@@ ked .
they have great names like “ terror behind the walls ” ( which inci@@ dentally is in a real prison ) , “ ho@@ w@@ l-@@ o-@@ scre@@ am ” and “ the house of sho@@ ck ” .
there are indeed 1,@@ 200 officially recognized sp@@ uk@@ houses in the united states that earn $ 500 million , america ha@@ un@@ ts said , and that includes the wonderful photos .
but let us finally get to the cu@@ d@@ d@@ ling .
char@@ lie brown made us familiar with the big pum@@ p@@ k@@ in when we were children , and car@@ ving a shor@@ ter lan@@ ter@@ n is like decor@@ ating the christmas tree – something we saw from the small up .
fortunately , the “ baby in the k@@ ür@@ b@@ is ” trend only began last year thanks to p@@ inte@@ rest , so most of us grew up to cope with the pum@@ p@@ k@@ in and not sitting in it .
this year , americans will spend about $ 10@@ 6 million on pum@@ p@@ k@@ in , according to the us cen@@ sus bureau .
the shor@@ ter l@@ amps , which slowly rot@@ ate in the front garden , are probably from il@@ lin@@ o@@ is , where this year 24@@ 5 million kil@@ o@@ gram@@ s of shor@@ ten@@ ed were har@@ ves@@ ted .
if you want to score points correctly , call ti@@ m and sus@@ an ma@@ th@@ is@@ don in nap@@ a , california and sc@@ roll out something pretty from their 9@@ 21 kil@@ o@@ gram@@ s .

the fire department had to be in hel@@ mb@@ re@@ cht on the late thursday evening .
a three-@@ family house in the hof district cat@@ ches fire during the night to friday .
the rescue forces have a co@@ al@@ es@@ cent cor@@ p@@ us from the house .
rescue workers have been killed during a fire in hel@@ mb@@ re@@ cht in a three-@@ family house .
whether it is a inhabit@@ ant &apos;s handle is still un@@ clear as a spo@@ kes@@ man of the police in bay@@ re@@ u@@ th said .
on the late thursday evening , the hotel bur@@ nt on the ground floor of the house .
when the fire bri@@ g@@ ade arrived , the fl@@ ames were already be@@ ating out of a window .
the forces of the army went to the apartment and found the cor@@ p@@ ses in a room .
this and another room bur@@ ned out completely .
the entire ground floor has been damaged .
all other residents were not at home during the fire , the police officer explained .
the building was not us@@ able for the time being .

germany &apos;s largest national church has launched an off@@ ensive to promote the profes@@ sion of the pa@@ st@@ or .
background is a possible short@@ age of pri@@ ests : the ev@@ angel@@ ic@@ -@@ lu@@ ther@@ an church han@@ nover exp@@ ects to see the number of their present around 1,@@ 800 pa@@ stor@@ alists and pa@@ st@@ ors dec@@ lining according to current law by 20@@ 30 .
for young people today , the profes@@ sion is very attractive and offers good prospects , said pa@@ st@@ or ma@@ this bur@@ fi@@ en ( 43 ) in con@@ vers@@ ation with the ev@@ angel@@ ical press service .
it is attractive to determine the work@@ flow and the daily rout@@ ine .
with bur@@ fi@@ en , the provin@@ cial church for the first time has entr@@ usted a pa@@ st@@ or on a full site to en@@ th@@ use young people for the@@ ology studies .
at the moment , fewer and fewer young people are choosing to study the@@ ology after gradu@@ ating .
bur@@ fi@@ a leads this back to the process of sec@@ ul@@ ar@@ isation : &quot; god &apos;s voice is quiet , the world is l@@ oud &quot; .
the profes@@ sion is characterised by great freedom and diversity .
i am the master of my calendar and can focus where it is important to me .
pa@@ st@@ ors could be close to the people as a sou@@ l@@ be@@ arer .
they earned as much as teachers and could live well from them .
certainly , more is paid in the free economy , but the@@ o@@ logi@@ ans would have a safe employ@@ er for that .
this is what is happening to the young people of today , who are not only concerned with care@@ ers , but with a work of a kind that is full of meaning .
according to the local church , which comprises three quarters of lower sa@@ x@@ ony , around 60 pa@@ st@@ ors are currently reti@@ ring each year .
at the same time , some 40 gradu@@ ates of a the@@ ological studies begin their vi@@ k@@ ari@@ at .
in spar@@ sely popu@@ lated periph@@ eral areas such as res@@ in , em@@ s@@ land , or w@@ end@@ land , it could be difficult to fill jobs in the future .
bur@@ fi@@ en wants to organise study days for young people and to invite prominent people to study the@@ ology .
the@@ ology studies offer a broad range of training .
it can even become the federal president .

fire bri@@ g@@ ade to save a bit@@ ch , 15 meters above the ground on a dangerous rock pro@@ tru@@ sion in a quar@@ ry .
co@@ ck@@ er@@ sp@@ ani@@ el bit@@ ch ru@@ by was out of the road after a small traffic accident .
three days later , she was taken by a wal@@ ker in the quar@@ ry in her p@@ ecu@@ li@@ ar location .
fire bri@@ g@@ ades ro@@ lled down to a cli@@ ff and saved the dog from the safe death of the dog .
the fire department managed to keep a dog safe , which was on a 15@@ -@@ metr@@ e high lead in a rock wall .
the nine months old co@@ ck@@ er@@ sp@@ ani@@ ard bit@@ ch ru@@ by was in the air after a traffic accident on sunday afternoon and survi@@ ved three days alone before she left a stone quar@@ ry on wednesday .
scot@@ t al@@ der@@ son , 25 , and his gir@@ l@@ friend bec@@ ky hall , 20 , who belongs to the dog , came to quar@@ ry fla@@ pp@@ it in den@@ hol@@ me , west yor@@ k@@ sh@@ ire to meet ru@@ by again .
they desper@@ ately had their missing female and they helped to get help in social networks .
around 2 : 15 pm on wednesday a wal@@ ker who saw his dog was walking the crow@@ ded and the str@@ an@@ ded ru@@ by on the 15@@ -@@ meter high paragraph in the quar@@ ry .
cle@@ ck@@ he@@ at@@ on fi@@ re station technical rescue team rus@@ hed to the site and ro@@ lled out to rescue rub@@ ys .
and@@ y cla@@ y@@ ton , specialist in the technical rescue team , said : “ she was in a dangerous position .
it was in the middle of the cli@@ ff wall – 15 meters from the top and the ground .
she did not move a mus@@ cle during her rescue – she was like sti@@ ff@@ -@@ fro@@ zen .
but now it is doing well .
she then gave a few ca@@ kes to her dog .
this was a rather unusual effort .
the fact that the dog was discovered is incredible .
peter la@@ u , specialist in the technical rescue team , said : “ ru@@ by had a giant accident . ”
it was possible that she was seriously in@@ ju@@ red or worse .
ru@@ by was taken to the veter@@ inary sur@@ ge@@ on , but he did not find anything except exhaus@@ tion and de@@ hy@@ dr@@ ation .
bec@@ ky hall from h@@ ali@@ fax , west yor@@ k@@ sh@@ ire , said : “ watch out for rescue was fri@@ ghten@@ ing . ”
i could not believe that she was really up there .
it was wonderful to keep them back in the poor .
the veter@@ in@@ arian explained that if exhaus@@ tion became too great and had collap@@ sed , it would probably have cr@@ ash@@ ed .
the fire@@ figh@@ ters have done great work .
it was really cour@@ ageous what you did .
we are simply so grateful and each of them was absolutely incredible .
scot@@ t al@@ der@@ son from ke@@ i@@ th@@ ley added : “ we were afraid that she would fall down , but she stayed up . ”
the fire@@ figh@@ ters were great .
i can hardly believe where it was .
mic@@ k j@@ ag@@ ger explained that he never made kat@@ y per@@ ry when she was 18 .
in an interview with an austr@@ ali@@ an radio station this week , the pop star said that she had been playing hun@@ ting song as a back@@ gr@@ oun@@ d-@@ sing@@ er of j@@ ag@@ gers song “ old hab@@ its die hard ” from 2004 .
per@@ ry explained that she had dinner with the al@@ tro@@ ck@@ er , and that “ he dre@@ w me away when i was 18 ” .
she added : “ this has been a long time ago and he was very kind to me . ”
in a statement , a representative j@@ ag@@ ger , 70 , said on thursday that he “ categ@@ or@@ ically denied that he had ever tried to approach kat@@ y per@@ ry . ”
the representative added : “ maybe she conf@@ used him with someone else . ”
per@@ ry was one of the sing@@ ers who played at the roll@@ ing-@@ stone tour this year .
her new album „ pris@@ m “ was released in 1st place this week .
george ke@@ rev@@ an : european un@@ bun@@ d@@ ling gives the sco@@ ts the choice of a new europe .
a new day , a new story of hor@@ ror about independence .
this time we are war@@ ned that an independent scotland is needed to join the schengen area as a condition for eu membership .
this is the key word for stories about pass@@ port controls in ber@@ w@@ ick and a bar@@ bed wire secured border along the h@@ adri@@ ans@@ wall@@ . the story is a story of the past .
in fact , the str@@ th@@ cl@@ y@@ de proposal referred to the possible economic benefits that would allow greater freedom of travel in the rest of europe , but this was , as expected , in the head@@ lines .
nor has anyone mentioned that eu member states often comply with their strict rules when it comes to making it cheaper for them .
as scotland is not part of the schengen area at the moment , continued non-@@ compliance with brussels would be a small conc@@ ession in return for what is really being demanded of the sco@@ ts .
so really not a story .
and one that has already come so long that it is already similar to a fo@@ ssi@@ l : for the first time i have called the &quot; independence means pass@@ port control &quot; -@@ duc@@ k at least 40 years ago .
an interesting point is that the repe@@ ti@@ tion of this ancient history is lost .
why expect an independent scotland to be able to operate under the european pi@@ pe ?
why the london yo@@ ke against the brussels one , especially now ?
these are the real european news : the great plan to un@@ ite europe after the war has st@@ alled .
with the euro crisis , the european project has officially died .
across the eu , parties that are anti-@@ eu or that regard the euro as a common currency are gaining ground .
even in germany , the euro@@ s@@ cep@@ tic party alternative for germany – founded only this year – could win bare@@ ly five million votes in the september federal election , effectively destro@@ ying free democrats ( the equivalent of the us .
there has always been domestic opposition to the plan to create a federal europe .
the current economic crisis , however , turns out to be a turning point .
because of the strict rules imposed by berlin and the european central bank in connection with the stra@@ it@@ jack@@ et into which the national economy is being driven by the de@@ tention of the single currency , many people believe that the project is far too far-@@ reaching for europe .
the euro crisis has little to do with national governments ’ excessive fiscal deficits – which was only the case in greece .
instead , the euro@@ system has se@@ aled its members ’ exchange rates , which are beneficial to german ex@@ porters – and german politicians would like to leave that as it should .
without the possibility of de@@ valu@@ ing the local currency , southern europe will find itself at a buil@@ t-@@ in productivity dis@@ advantage compared to germany .
the only way to cut wages and public spending is to use the sp@@ ur@@ red berlin initiative .
behind the current budgetary and monetary problems lies a de@@ eper european productivity problem .
as a result of the “ green ” energy guidelines imposed by brussels – a code for subsidi@@ zing french and german energy companies at the consumer ’ s expense – european industry pays a great deal of extra money compared to the united states .
this is a cri@@ p@@ pling cost dis@@ advantage , as we have seen in green@@ mouth .
all wage fix@@ ations in the world do not protect the european petro@@ chemical industry from being hit by cheap american sh@@ ale gas .
as a result , a re@@ vol@@ t is rising , especially in france , the eu ’ s former che@@ er@@ leader .
after the war , france ’ s political elite saw the eu as a vehicle to help germany in its wake and to bring paris to the same level as washington .
but berlin no longer needs paris as a ga@@ te@@ way to political legitimacy , and has put its own economic policy on hold , which is the gri@@ p of the ail@@ ing french economy .
the result : marine le pen &apos;s right-@@ wing , anti-@@ eu front national has just won a decisive post-@@ election , thereby weak@@ ening the ruling socialists to third place .
the front national is now the most popular party in france , with 24 % of the vote – a timely warning to the british labour party that it does not expect to be divided in the right wing .
what makes le pen with its newly won popul@@ arity among the white french of the working class ?
it wants to use next year &apos;s eu elections to create an anti-@@ eu , anti-@@ community monetary blo@@ c in the european parliament .
if anti-@@ eu parties do well in these elections – and this is very much possible – then such a block could be the dominant position in the european parliament for the first time .
that is the point i want to make : in the not too dist@@ ant future , the growing res@@ ent@@ ment against the eu and the single currency will un@@ ite to the abolition of the euro .
the eu will not dis@@ appear , but it will be more like the “ europe of ( sovereign ) nations ” that general de ga@@ ul@@ le fav@@ ored .
germany and some of its satellite economies may be holding onto the euro , but france and southern europe will return to their own curren@@ cies .
i expect britain to distance itself from this project in the hope of sh@@ at@@ tering itself with the united states .
but washington ’ s growing interest in the pacific region suggests that britain , alone , is in the atlantic rain .
where is scotland in all this ?
we can decide to create a region of ( ultimately ) small england .
or we can defend our own economic interests – including saying that berlin and brussels should say what they can get to where .
i susp@@ ect that scotland could be in a loo@@ ser european union , provided we have our own currency .
cooperation with other similar countries is essential in a non-@@ federal europe of nations .
otherwise , we should consider the same thing as norway and maintaining our economic independence .
the sn@@ p government in scotland is – remark@@ ably – the most successful political movement against the au@@ ster@@ ity policies in europe , and has a spectacular majority in 2011 , owing to the rejection of the proposed ( and made ) cuts .
it would be ri@@ dic@@ ulous for scotland to op@@ t for independence now only to be able to make a au@@ ster@@ ity policy imposed by berlin and brussels .
early pub@@ er@@ ty : grow up faster
a@@ fro@@ -@@ american and h@@ is@@ pan@@ ic girls tend to reach pub@@ er@@ ty rather than their white con@@ tempor@@ aries , as studies show .
physical changes do not directly imp@@ ly pub@@ er@@ ty .
there is no evidence that hor@@ mon@@ es or other chemicals are responsible .
experts believe that ep@@ ide@@ mic ob@@ es@@ ity is a tri@@ gger of early pub@@ er@@ ty .
the trend towards early pub@@ er@@ ty is less pron@@ oun@@ ced in young people and is more pron@@ oun@@ ced in young people .
the former c@@ n@@ n correspon@@ dent p@@ at e@@ ther@@ id@@ ge is a journ@@ alist who focuses on child health and family issues .
if a mother is wor@@ ried when her daughter is bre@@ ast and sh@@ am@@ eless at the age of seven or eight ?
at the annual conference of the american academy of pedi@@ at@@ r@@ ici@@ ans association , this week in or@@ lan@@ do , fl@@ ori@@ da , the pa@@ edi@@ at@@ ric en@@ do@@ cr@@ ine doctor explained dr. paul ka@@ paul k@@ ap@@ lo@@ log@@ ist .
“ i spend a lot of time re@@ ass@@ uring parents – usually this is not a sign that the pub@@ er@@ ty is now fast , ” explains cap@@ lo@@ wit@@ z .
obvious indic@@ ations of development , such as growing bre@@ asts , sh@@ am@@ po@@ o and ar@@ mp@@ it ha@@ irs , and body od@@ or , are found in girls earlier .
however , there was only one s@@ light shift in the age of men@@ ar@@ che ( first rule ble@@ eding ) over the last 40 years .
in the united states , the average age is 12.@@ 5 years , slightly less than 12.@@ 75 in 197@@ 0 .
&quot; when the bre@@ ast is developing , it takes at least two to three years to get to the men@@ ar@@ k , &quot; said k@@ ap@@ lo@@ wit@@ z , also author of the book “ early pub@@ er@@ ty in girls : the essential guide to tre@@ ating girls .
time is the most accurate test of how pub@@ er@@ ty progres@@ ses .
it is controversial what actually marked the beginning of pub@@ er@@ ty , but it is “ early in the morning ” when bre@@ ast enlargement is accompanied by a growth boost before an age of eight .
in most cases , the process is slow@@ ing or stag@@ n@@ ating – something that a pedi@@ at@@ r@@ ici@@ an can monitor closely .
if progress is faster , tests could be performed by an en@@ dic@@ ron@@ o@@ log@@ ist to avoid serious problems such as t@@ um@@ ors or cy@@ sts .
there are treatment methods for dela@@ ying early men@@ stru@@ ation and resi@@ sting another consequence : pre@@ mature aging of the b@@ ones , ul@@ ti@@ ma@@ tive treatment of growth barriers .
the recommendations for medic@@ inal or hor@@ mon@@ al therapy are based on the age of the child , the rate of development , the rate of growth and the emo@@ tional mat@@ ur@@ ity .
psycho@@ social aspects are also important .
cap@@ lo@@ wit@@ z is re@@ tic@@ ent about drugs , but he ad@@ mits : “ sup@@ pressing pub@@ er@@ ty can solve behavi@@ oral problems and the feel@@ ings of girls , unlike their age gen@@ ome .
the other major problem is understand@@ able : parents simply do not want their very young dau@@ gh@@ ters to have the period .
&quot; they worry about pregn@@ ancy risk or how to improve hygi@@ ene .
“ it was a sho@@ ck , ” a woman who had a daughter with ten days had re@@ mem@@ bered .
although there were initial signs and we talked about men@@ stru@@ ation , it was not emo@@ tionally prepared .
she came fri@@ ghten@@ ed and ex@@ ci@@ ted from school home because she was the first in her circle of friends .
there are many widely published the@@ ories about the causes of early pub@@ er@@ ty .
but there is no conclu@@ sive evidence that hor@@ mon@@ es are found in milk or other foods , chemicals in the environment or sexual mess@@ aging in the media .
bo@@ ys , like girls , come to pub@@ er@@ ty in the past .
k@@ ap@@ lo@@ wit@@ z believes that the most convinc@@ ing pre@@ mise is the ep@@ ide@@ mic of ob@@ es@@ ity .
he supported the conduct of a study in 2001 on girls aged six to nine , which showed a link between body f@@ at and ad@@ ol@@ es@@ cent pub@@ er@@ ty .
other studies support this conclusion , but there are many other factors that have played a role .
in this country , a@@ fro@@ -@@ american and h@@ is@@ pan@@ ic girls tend to reach pub@@ er@@ ty rather than their white con@@ tempor@@ aries .
there are different explanations for this .
glob@@ ally , early pub@@ er@@ ty seems to have been influenced by all sor@@ ts of things , from economic conditions to the climate to gen@@ es .
another pu@@ zz@@ le : although bo@@ ys have had the fac@@ ial and sh@@ am@@ bo@@ y@@ ant hair growing earlier , the trend towards a full-@@ fle@@ d@@ ged earlier pub@@ er@@ ty is not as pron@@ oun@@ ced as girls .
other doctors at the a@@ ap conference under@@ lined the complexity of the issue .
the appearance of ac@@ ne and sh@@ am@@ hair is even common in bab@@ ies and inf@@ ants .
“ we must be careful how we can identify the real beginning of pub@@ er@@ ty , ” said dr. law@@ rence sil@@ ver@@ man , a pa@@ edi@@ at@@ ric en@@ do@@ cr@@ in@@ o@@ log@@ ist at gor@@ ye@@ b children .
parents should not hesitate to contact their pedi@@ at@@ r@@ ici@@ an to discuss how to talk to their child .
“ this can mean that you need to talk earlier than expected , ” says k@@ ap@@ lo@@ wit@@ z .
if you stay calm , the child usually re@@ acts well .
girls who fl@@ our@@ ish early need the insurance that the process is a normal part of life , even if it occurs earlier than intended .
jum@@ bo manufacturers are argu@@ ing in favour of large orders over seat width and time limits in the face of large orders .
there has been a dispute between leading aircraft manufacturers over the width of tourist seats in long-@@ range flights .
the dispute is about the seat width , passengers on long flights in the tourist class are offered , not always those who are not interested in the airlines most .
airbus has been calling for industry standards this week , with a minimum seat width of 46 cm ( 18 in@@ ches ) in the tourist class , but the us ore bu@@ ll is still in the news .
the dispute comes at a time when the plan@@ e-@@ buil@@ ders are compe@@ ting to buy even larger versions of their two-@@ engine long-@@ hau@@ l aircraft , and the us is taking part in the event from november 17@@ th to 21st .
how the re@@ ar part of the aircraft is designed – especially if it is ro@@ ws with nine or ten seats – is crucial to the economic results indicated , which will make the new “ mini jum@@ bo ” design .
bo@@ eing claims that its modern@@ ised “ 7@@ 7@@ x ” fas@@ se has 4@@ 06 people with seats in the tourist class , which are more than 17 in@@ ches wide and thus allow ten per row .
airbus decla@@ res that it will be possible to carry 3@@ 50 passengers in 18 in@@ ch wide seats in the tour@@ istic class , with nine per row .
aircraft gi@@ ants often share technical details through advertising in the specialized press .
now , before the du@@ ba@@ i air@@ show , where the 7@@ 7@@ 7@@ x with more than 100 orders is expected to take the race , directly to the public .
recently , the company presented an advertis@@ ement that marks the beginning of a new advertising war and that showed don@@ ors an image of three people squ@@ ee@@ zing together in a restaurant , and the title : “ would you accept that ? ”
&quot; bo@@ eing is proposing long-@@ hau@@ l flights in seats that are nar@@ ro@@ wer than regional tur@@ bo@@ -@@ pro@@ ps , &quot; said airbus sales director john lea@@ h@@ y .
given changing di@@ etary hab@@ its , people become th@@ ick@@ er , but aircraft seats have not rad@@ ically changed .
between the early 197@@ 0 ’ s , when bo@@ eing 7@@ 47 defined the modern long distance journey , and the end of the century , the weight of the male average american has increased from 40 to 49 years by ten percent .
the wa@@ ist range of the average male in the 21st century is about 10@@ 0.@@ 8 cm , according to us health statistics .
airbus says its ri@@ val is in line with a seat concept from the 195@@ 0s , when the average body size of the newly b@@ ap@@ tiz@@ ed “ jet set ” was nar@@ ro@@ wer .
it has carried out studies , airbus has said , to show that an additional customs duty ( 2.@@ 54 cm ) per seat would increase sleep quality by 53 % .
bo@@ eing den@@ ies airbus ’ figures for the seat , saying that it is not at the manufacturers ’ discre@@ tion to decide how airlines should strike the balance between fa@@ res and equipment .
the company also explains , according to studies , that the experience on the plane is more than the width of the seat .
“ it really amounts to giving airlines flexibility to do so , as they see fit .
you do not want us to dict@@ ate to you what makes you prof@@ itable .
you know your business better than anyone else .
passengers are concerned about more freedom from el@@ bo@@ ws , but manufacturers are increasingly facing a subject that has an impact on sales .
behind the battle is a race for aircraft orders with an estimated volume of at least $ 700 billion according to list prices in the coming decades , which has a lasting impact on the us or europe ’ s export record .
as re@@ u@@ ters reported for the first time in july , the seat layout is the driving force behind the battle for the new je@@ ts .
both airbus and bo@@ eing claim that 20 % more efficiency per seat is achieved with their latest two-@@ engine long-@@ hau@@ l designs than the market leader in this segment , which has 3@@ 65 seats bo@@ eing 7@@ 7-@@ 3@@ 00@@ er .
bo@@ eing ’ s statements on the results are partly dependent on the 7@@ 7@@ 7@@ x , with its ten seats per row , being designed with the original design of nine seats in the 7@@ 77 .
the increased cost per unit is still lower than that currently used on ten seats per row .
&quot; bo@@ eing therefore qu@@ its more seats on its aircraft to make it more competitive with our products , &quot; says k@@ ev@@ in ken@@ i@@ ston , head of passenger comfort at the european airbus .
on the other hand , analy@@ sts say that full cab@@ ins with ten seats per row at 7@@ 7@@ 7@@ s indicate that many passengers were in favour of the ti@@ ghter arrangement , which would be accompanied by cheaper fa@@ res .
&quot; eigh@@ teen in@@ ch seat width would be great for passengers , but the reality is : from an economic point of view , the airbus offer is excluded from the 7@@ 77 threat .
airbus and bo@@ eing do not offer seats , but a catalogue of suppliers from which the airlines can choose .
the world &apos;s travel@@ er jet sel@@ lers even carry band@@ width to help the equipment in competition .
even if you promote comfort , all manufacturers offer high speed , high den@@ sity je@@ ts .
airbus offers an a3@@ 50 with ten seat ro@@ ws , but it has not sold it .
until recently , airbus has stressed the importance of greater flexibility in cab@@ ins and of having wide seats on the cor@@ rid@@ ors for some je@@ ts .
without the support of the only other manufacturer of large modern je@@ ts , experts say that the call for a new industry standard is likely to cr@@ um@@ ble , but will be dis@@ cour@@ aged from the 7@@ 7@@ 7@@ x sales wave .
new anti-@@ nic@@ ot@@ ine vacc@@ ine could give the pleasure of smoking a k@@ ick start .
scientists have developed an anti-@@ nic@@ ot@@ ine vacc@@ ine that reduces the fun of smoking .
a single do@@ se of the vacc@@ ine could protect m@@ ice from nic@@ ot@@ ine ad@@ diction for life .
before human testing , further tests are needed , which may take some years , but professor ron@@ ald crystal of the we@@ ill cor@@ n@@ ell medical college in new york said that the first results were good .
“ we are very hope@@ ful that this type of vacc@@ ination strategy can help millions of smo@@ kers who have tried to stop smoking , using all the methods available on the market to try , but have had to experience that their ni@@ pp@@ ies are stronger than they .
the new vacc@@ ine contains a harm@@ less virus that has been modified to dis@@ close genetic information to produce nic@@ ot@@ ine anti@@ bodies .
the virus selec@@ tively inf@@ ects the li@@ ver cells , which then produces a constant stream of anti@@ bodies .
the anti@@ bodies hun@@ t the nic@@ ot@@ ine mo@@ lec@@ ules in blood and neutr@@ alize them before they can dis@@ pose of the brain , causing a smo@@ ker to not smo@@ ke a high nic@@ ot@@ ine .
in experim@@ ents held vacc@@ inated m@@ ice that nic@@ ot@@ ine was ad@@ min@@ istered , their normal level of activity .
m@@ ice without vacc@@ ination , on the other hand , would have taken a “ time out , ” the researchers said , a sign that nic@@ ot@@ ine has reached its brain .
the experim@@ ents are published in the fac@@ h@@ bl@@ at@@ t science trans@@ la@@ tional medicine .
earlier vacc@@ ines against tobacco failed because they were anti-@@ bodies .
vacc@@ ination had to be used to maintain the anti@@ body level so often that it would be expensive and im@@ practical .
but the cost of the new vacc@@ ine is probably much lower , because it trans@@ forms li@@ ver cells into anti@@ body fac@@ tories .
as professor crystal said , a future vacc@@ ine for people who have no doubt about the safety of children could be used before they are temp@@ ted to have a ci@@ gare@@ tte .
more likely , though , smo@@ kers would use it to stop .
&quot; you know then : when you start smoking again , you feel a little more un@@ comfortable because of the nic@@ ot@@ ine vacc@@ ine , and that helps you to get rid of hab@@ it , &quot; he explains .
british scientists said that the results were interesting , but at the same time war@@ ned that further research is needed .
tri@@ po@@ di den@@ ies , to have been influenced by o@@ be@@ id to be influenced by .
against former minister jo@@ e tri@@ po@@ di of the labor@@ -@@ market party , an investigation by the government corruption commission is being launched .
the former n@@ s@@ w minister den@@ ies that the rules on maritime transport are being re@@ viewed at the request of his political ment@@ or , ed@@ die o@@ be@@ id , who has hidden interests in three land areas on state@@ -@@ controlled land .
the independent commission against the us government has decided to introduce a new policy for the fight against corruption .
now , the acc@@ us@@ ation is being investig@@ ated that tri@@ po@@ di has been accused of ob@@ i@@ den &apos;s hidden interest in the land after tri@@ po@@ di &apos;s former depu@@ ty chief of staff , ly@@ n@@ ne a@@ a@@ a@@ a@@ a@@ a@@ a@@ a@@ a@@ a@@ a@@ a@@ a@@ a@@ a@@ a@@ a@@ a@@ a@@ a@@ a@@ a@@ a .
in years of discussions that began in 2005 , the government had insi@@ sted on public ten@@ der for le@@ ase contracts .
the po@@ ets opposed this and also wanted longer mat@@ ur@@ ities .
in 2009 , the le@@ ase contracts for the companies were awarded to the cir@@ cu@@ lar qu@@ ay , which earned the o@@ be@@ di@@ ds $ 2.5 million ann@@ ually , without public ten@@ der .
tri@@ po@@ di , the port minister from february 2006 to november 2009 , initially spoke out in favour of public tend@@ ers .
but he refused to accept the changes at o@@ be@@ id ’ s request , which , as tri@@ po@@ di confirmed , was aimed at a re@@ design of the government ’ s le@@ ase arrangements .
one of the ic@@ ac ’ s written records showed talks between o@@ be@@ id , tri@@ po@@ di , and ste@@ ve dun@@ n , a senior official who went to the port ministry .
“ was the subject discussed in these telephone conver@@ sa@@ tions the development of commercial le@@ asing arrangements ? ” the depu@@ ty commissioner , an@@ th@@ ony w@@ he@@ al@@ y , asked tri@@ po@@ di .
“ no , ” tri@@ po@@ di rep@@ lied .

israeli figh@@ ter plan@@ es attack targets in syria , according to official sources .
israeli figh@@ ter plan@@ es would have a destination on thursday night in lat@@ ak@@ ia sy@@ ri@@ an port , confirmed a senior government official to fox news .
the official did not explain what the objective was , but said that it was at least one .
according to the associated press , the goal was russian sa@@ -@@ 12@@ 5 missi@@ les .
israel has already , this year at least twice , carried out air stri@@ kes on missi@@ le deli@@ veries in syria .
foreign workers with 4@@ 57 vis@@ as could be subjec@@ ted to “ real test ”
the government is thinking about a “ real test ” for foreign workers with 4@@ 5@@ 7-@@ visa requirements as part of extended measures .
if the test is introduced , it would be used beyond a criteri@@ on that would prevent the 4@@ 57 being used to fill un@@ skilled jobs or as a back door for the family and friends to australia .
a proposal for a government discussion was published today , after the former labour party m@@ ps , max@@ ine m@@ c@@ ke@@ w , had taken note of the government &apos;s comments on foreign workers , because they were not considered by australia &apos;s neighb@@ ors .
“ l@@ oud statements such as foreign@@ ers should take place behind themselves , ” and , if austr@@ ali@@ ans are to be first prepared , a very un@@ pleasant back@@ l@@ ash in times when unions demanded a protected labor market , ” she told australia .
histor@@ ically , it was said that white workers should be protected – and if some in the region echo the echo of this historic arti@@ fact , they would not be able to surprise me .
the proposal for discussion out@@ lines twelve measures that were form@@ erly adopted by the former immigration minister chr@@ is bow@@ en .
immigration minister bren@@ dan o &apos;@@ con@@ nor , who spoke yesterday about trafficking in human beings in s@@ ri lan@@ ka , has identified five of the recommended changes that other countries will make , and the others will be considered .
if the ‘ authentic@@ ity criteri@@ on ’ is adopted , then someone who applied for a visa could be re@@ viewed to see whether ‘ the application is valid in the cases where it is not accepted ’ .
companies could also be obliged to account for the number of 4@@ 57 visa holders after the 4@@ 57 companies that had initially only a small number of workers were willing to support , after all , hundreds have been hi@@ red .
meanwhile , a 35 year-@@ old s@@ ri lan@@ k@@ an asylum see@@ ker probably died from a heart attack after being killed this week with a refugee boat on the christmas island .

the austr@@ ali@@ an authorities brought the man to the christmas island hospital , where he died .
the british government has announced a study that will examine the benefits of the h@@ s@@ 2 rail project for scotland .
in the work of h@@ s@@ 2 ltd is proposed to start from the beginning of phase 1 in 20@@ 26 high-@@ speed connections between scotland and the north of england .
transport minister bar@@ on@@ ess k@@ ram@@ er said that the project “ will bring britain closer ” .
the scot@@ tish transport minister , ke@@ ith brown , said that he was very pleased to work with the british government on this plan .
phase 1 consists of a new high-@@ speed rail link between london and the west mid@@ lands .
after phase 2 has been completed , there will be connections to man@@ ch@@ ester and le@@ eds .
in june , the government correc@@ ted the estimated cost of building the high-@@ speed road between london and northern england from eur 3@@ 2.@@ 7 billion to g@@ b@@ p 4@@ 2.@@ 6 billion .
the british government , which is in talks with transport scotland , has entr@@ usted h@@ s@@ 2 ltd to look for further capacity and travel time improvements for northern england and scotland .
this includes the possibility of a travel time of three hours or less by gl@@ as@@ go@@ w and ed@@ in@@ burgh to london .
bar@@ on@@ ess k@@ ram@@ er said : “ our goal for h@@ s@@ 2 is a truly national route network that brings britain and its cities closer together . ”
we are going ahead with h@@ s@@ 2 because it brings enormous advantages .
without it , we are facing a capacity crisis in our rail network .
but it is also about connecting 18 british cities , including gl@@ as@@ go@@ w and ed@@ in@@ burgh , which is improved thanks to h@@ s@@ 2 .
the scot@@ tish secretary of state ali@@ sta@@ ir car@@ michael comm@@ ented : “ today ’ s announcement is good news for scotland . ”
on behalf of the scot@@ tish government , ke@@ ith brown car@@ michael called for the scot@@ tish constitution to be ‘ un@@ equi@@ vo@@ cal ’ .
brown said , “ the high-@@ speed rail link has the potential to bring enormous economic benefits to scotland , but at the same time scotland ’ s economic power also provides an argument for fast rail links throughout the uk . ”
we are therefore pleased to work as a partner of the british government and to improve the options for a high-@@ speed rail link in scotland , which will bring benefits to everyone and will make the gl@@ as@@ go@@ w-@@ ed@@ in@@ burgh government more efficient .
i look forward to discussing the report of the inquiry with the british ministers next year and to taking the next steps together .
regulations on electronic equipment in aircraft remain in force in australia for the time being .
austr@@ ali@@ an air passengers must continue to use tab@@ lets and smar@@ t@@ phones at the start and lan@@ ding , despite efforts in the us to improve the regulation of such devices .
the us federal aviation administration ( fa@@ a ) allows us airlines to change their specifications so that passengers can fly on their equipment during critical flight ph@@ ases .
during most of the flight passengers are already allowed to do so , but many people find it an@@ no@@ ying that they are not able to use their e-@@ books when starting and lan@@ ding .
austr@@ ali@@ an companies are watching the decision that the us airlines have to do a lot of work to implement , but they are not pursuing immediate plans to amend their rules .
the casa air traffic control authority also stated that it would look at the announcement , but stressed that the restrictions on the use of electronic equipment were not fully met in critical flight ph@@ ases in australia .
“ casa has no specific regulations regarding the use of electronic equipment on aircraft at the moment ” , has been announced .
the subject is subject to provisions that allow airlines to maintain safety at all times and to allow passengers to exercise the safety instructions given by cab@@ in crew .
vir@@ gin has already started talks with casa about extending the use of its wi-fi entertainment system to flights and explains how you are open to change , that you need to be initiated by the legisl@@ ator .
“ we would like to see the casa approval review , because we are convinced that this is the way to improve customer experience , now that we have ( wireless entertainment ) used the system during the flight ” , said one speaker .
q@@ ant@@ as explained that they will remain in the current rules for the time being .
“ our current directives provide that electronic equipment is not used at start and lan@@ ding , and we do not have any plans to change it at the moment , ” the company explained .
the fa@@ a rules apply to us airlines .
however , we are always interested in developments in regulations that can benefit passengers and we will be very concerned about the fa@@ a decision and the reasons behind it .
the decision affects us companies differently depending on the age of the fleet .
you must prove that your aircraft toler@@ ates the inter@@ ference from mobile devices , and that manu@@ als , training materials , hand bag@@ gage programs and customer instruc@@ tion change .
“ after an airline has confirmed the tolerance of its fleet , it can allow passengers to use port@@ able , ligh@@ ter electronic devices such as tab@@ lets , e-@@ book read@@ ers and smar@@ t@@ phones at all levels ” , announced the airline ’ s .
in rare cases , the crew will attack passengers who are not able to control the equipment during the lan@@ ding .
the group also recommended that he@@ avi@@ er devices be safe@@ ly installed under the seat or in the com@@ part@@ ments over the seats when they are lan@@ ded or when they are in the lan@@ ding area .
before the sch@@ al@@ ke re@@ vi@@ er@@ der@@ by , a group of travel@@ ed b@@ v@@ b sup@@ porters had equipped lu@@ min@@ ous missi@@ les for u@@ g@@ ly scenes in the vel@@ t@@ ins arena .
bor@@ us@@ sia dor@@ t@@ mun@@ d announced hard consequences .
before the friday match of the bun@@ des@@ lig@@ a football league against the v@@ f@@ b stutt@@ gart , the ul@@ tr@@ as respon@@ ded with a silence - first .
it was an un@@ familiar , almost already g@@ ho@@ stly ac@@ ous@@ tics that was shown to the vie@@ wer until just before the start of the bun@@ des@@ lig@@ a game between german vice champi@@ on bor@@ us@@ sia dor@@ t@@ mun@@ d and the v@@ v@@ v@@ v@@ v@@ v@@ v@@ f@@ d .
the guest fans were mostly listening to their songs .
the southern grand@@ stand , on the other hand , is where the fa@@ i@@ th@@ ful - and lou@@ dest - fans of b@@ v@@ b were initially extremely quiet : no sing@@ ing , no battle calls .
the po@@ dium of cap@@ o , which otherwise coordin@@ ates the joint mo@@ ist@@ ure , remained un@@ occupied .
and right in the front of the grand@@ stand , lon@@ ely w@@ av@@ ed a big flag with the title &apos; section ban@@ ning sta@@ dium &apos; .
only as a go@@ al@@ ke@@ eper roman we@@ iden@@ f@@ ell@@ er as always the first b@@ v@@ b player entered the square , bur@@ ned temporary che@@ er .
when his team colleagues followed , there was a l@@ oud voice and we@@ aring scar@@ ves - but by no means everywhere .
in the central blocks 12 and 13 of the southern grand@@ stand , nothing was bo@@ thered .
the sta@@ dium spo@@ kes@@ man nor@@ bert dic@@ kel also has to re@@ visit the positive experiences of the last few days - der@@ by victory , victory over ar@@ sen@@ al , contract renew@@ al by tra@@ iner j@@ ür@@ gen k@@ lo@@ p@@ p - did not make for the event .
only five minutes before the attack , the cap@@ o will get its po@@ dium - and the two players will be able to cope with the real tension .
finally , as always , it was the turn of the southern grand@@ stand - and finally the lou@@ dest place in the sta@@ dium was here again as usual .
and at the latest as with wh@@ ist@@ le from the south grand@@ stand the lou@@ dly call &quot; der@@ by@@ sie@@ ger stands on &quot; came , again , was everything as usual .
the silence that prece@@ ded it was probably a response to what has happened over the past few days .
just before the inv@@ ad@@ ers at f@@ c sch@@ al@@ ke 04 , some of the co@@ ach fans had a lu@@ min@@ ous missi@@ le in the ran@@ ks and in the square - and they had almost tor@@ n down .
the game was dela@@ yed due to the cha@@ otic scenes .
b@@ v@@ b-@@ bo@@ ss han@@ s-@@ jo@@ achi@@ m wat@@ z@@ ke had the top of the dor@@ t@@ mun@@ d ul@@ tr@@ as then received in his office - and believe wat@@ z@@ ke &apos;s words , this was a rather un@@ comfortable appointment for the fan representatives .
&quot; it is used for the entire ul@@ tra movement to make massive cuts , &quot; the b@@ v@@ b bo@@ ss announced on thursday evening at a panel discussion in frankfurt .
as an immediate measure , wat@@ z@@ ke prohibited the ul@@ tr@@ as from performing a cho@@ re@@ o@@ graphy for home mat@@ ches against the v@@ f@@ b stutt@@ gart .
&quot; i for@@ bi@@ dden that , &quot; he said .
the zero tolerance policy on py@@ ro@@ techn@@ ics cannot be abandoned .
in addition , the ul@@ tr@@ as have been given various opportunities for pun@@ ishment - until tuesday they now have time to choose one .
otherwise , according to wat@@ z@@ ke , the b@@ v@@ b will have to impose a sanc@@ tion by the end of next week .
&quot; this will be a big change &quot; , assured wat@@ z@@ ke .
we can look forward to seeing the re@@ actions in the southern gallery .
p@@ f@@ and@@ haus are bo@@ om@@ ing in sing@@ apor@@ e , as the mid@@ d@@ le-@@ class crisis has arrived .
in a p@@ f@@ and@@ haus in the b@@ end@@ er@@ me@@ er shopping centre in sing@@ apor@@ e , jan@@ ani am@@ ir@@ th@@ al@@ ing@@ a ex@@ u@@ des a golden arm@@ re@@ if , a ring and a few ear@@ r@@ ings to pay the school fees .
“ my hus@@ band and i have just bought a house , my money is in it , ” am@@ ir@@ th@@ al@@ ing@@ a says .
although she is usd 3@@ ,000 per month ( about 1,@@ 7@@ 30 euros ) as an administrative employee and her hus@@ band also work , the monthly sal@@ ary of the family is not sufficient , she explains .
indeed , in parts of south-@@ east asia – where household debt is rising – demand is so large that valu@@ em@@ a@@ x , where it can be ex@@ changed , will be the third deposit this week .
the ple@@ d@@ ging of je@@ wel@@ ry is not only a quick way to get money – 1,@@ 300 sing@@ apor@@ e dollars in the jan@@ ani am@@ ir@@ th@@ al@@ ing@@ a case – but also almost as cheap as a cheap bank .
typically , p@@ f@@ and@@ houses in sing@@ apor@@ e require an effective 17 % annual rate , which is just above 15@@ .@@ 4 % , which the united over@@ seas bank requires , to be a local len@@ der with a local lo@@ an of one .
however , p@@ f@@ and@@ h@@ ä@@ user offers the advantage that no credit rating or income veri@@ fication is required , which means that loans are faster than banks can .
that is why millions of people in the region turn to p@@ f@@ and@@ haus , as families are put under increased living costs and increased household and consumer debt .
after five years of robust growth since the global financial crisis and cheap loans due to lo@@ ose fiscal policies in the developed economies , families with lower and mid@@ d@@ le-@@ income seek p@@ f@@ and@@ haus homes to help the country ’ s st@@ ot@@ ter@@ n economy .
this week , the credit rating agency called standard &amp; poor &apos;s growing budget debt , mainly due to rising mort@@ g@@ ages , a risk factor for cred@@ it@@ wor@@ thin@@ ess of asian banks .
mal@@ ay@@ sia , thailand , and sing@@ apor@@ e have , according to the agency ’ s assessment , the highest budget debt in asia relative to gdp .
mal@@ ay@@ sia is the top country in the world , accounting for 80 % of gdp , and a 60 % increase in 2008 .
econom@@ ists are also wor@@ ried about thailand ’ s high consumer debt , which comes just out of a technical recession this week .
on thursday , the data showed a continued export weak@@ ness and a reduction in consumer demand .
“ in the end , this means that , with rising costs , people in the middle to bottom segment ( the income scale ) will try to supple@@ ment their income wherever possible . ”

the company finances this at 60 % of the 66 million sing@@ apor@@ e dollars it has received this week with the sing@@ apor@@ e stock exchange .
while some l@@ enders are on the br@@ ink of a crus@@ hing fire for high interest rates , ye@@ ah decla@@ res that p@@ f@@ and@@ houses are not only cheaper than other l@@ enders , but also did not raise the debt directly .
“ customers bor@@ row items that they already own , and the liquid personal valu@@ ables do not increase household in@@ deb@@ te@@ dness , ” she explains .

rescue package of over 3@@ 25 million austr@@ ali@@ an dollars for tas@@ man@@ ic health care
the austr@@ ali@@ an government insi@@ sts on the tough conditions that the rescue package has created over 3@@ 25 million austr@@ ali@@ an dollars for the tas@@ man@@ ian health care to ensure that the country ’ s government is doing the job .
federal minister of health , t@@ any@@ a p@@ liber@@ se@@ k , has announced that the comm@@ on@@ wealth will take “ immediate action ” to a@@ ver@@ t a crisis caused by an ag@@ eing population of the island state , a higher rate of chr@@ onic diseases .
funding for a period of four years has been re@@ sumed after government consul@@ tations with the independent tas@@ man@@ ian member andre@@ w wil@@ ki@@ e .
“ the government has failed to produce an emergency rescue package that we believe will address the unique challenges that the federal state faces . ”
the $ 3@@ 25 million package includes $ 31 million in emergency aid for electoral performance .
further 26@@ 00 operations , including or@@ tho@@ pe@@ dic sur@@ gery and treatment for gra@@ y star , are intended to eliminate resi@@ du@@ es .
there is also money for day@@ -@@ clin@@ ics in ho@@ b@@ art and laun@@ ce@@ ston , better post-@@ operative care after sta@@ tionary stays , specialist training , services in the field of mental health and the introduction of a system of electronic recording .
“ these investments are in line with the ideas that patients have told me that they are the best way to get the tas@@ man@@ ian health system to improve , ” said t@@ any@@ a p@@ liber@@ se@@ k .
the minister insi@@ sted on strict reporting and accountability of the tas@@ man@@ ian government .
the state must maintain the current level of funding to finance money from the comm@@ on@@ wealth , and be able to report monthly on where the additional funds were spent .
a three-@@ member commission will be set up to ensure that the federal state provides health services as effectively and efficiently as possible .
as wil@@ ki@@ e has explained today , the $ 3@@ 25 million would be of little use if “ they are not accompanied by genuine reforms that would undermine the public tas@@ man@@ ian health system on a more sustainable path . ”
nevertheless , he p@@ raised the government for respon@@ ding to his request for urgent assistance , which he first offered to the prime minister at the beginning of may .
“ i am confident that federal aid will make a major contribution to improving the state ’ s public health system from the list of wor@@ ries , ” wil@@ ki@@ e said .
according to the state government , these election results will largely compens@@ ate for the recent cuts .
but the opposition ’ s spo@@ kes@@ man on health policy , peter du@@ tt@@ on , believes that today ’ s announcement is only a “ pal@@ li@@ ative . ”
“ we are in a position today because the la@@ b government has with@@ drawn $ 4@@ 30 million from the health system , ” he said to ab@@ c tv .
it is not acceptable for a state government to get almost half a billion dollars out of the system and the comm@@ on@@ wealth to invest 300 million in it and then pre@@ tend that the good news is good news .
du@@ tt@@ on asked pl@@ es@@ se@@ k to guarantee that not a single dollar of the b@@ ail@@ out package would be spent on additional bureaucracy .

syria has lost its ability to produce chemical weapons , according to a monitoring group , a surveillance group has suggested that the country should not be allowed to close its arms .
syria has established important facilities for the production of chemical weapons and g@@ it@@ f@@ g@@ ases , declared the global monitoring group on chemical weapons on thursday , while there are still serious conflicts in the north of the country near one of the world ’ s major sites .
on thursday , too , a sy@@ ri@@ an activi@@ sts announced that more than 1@@ 20@@ ,000 people have died from the civil war ’ s on@@ set soon three years ago .
the announcement by the organisation for the prohibi@@ tion of chemical weapons ( op@@ c@@ w ) came a day before the date of the first meeting of the european parliament on 11 september .
1 november , which the h@@ ague based organisation dam@@ as@@ c@@ us had set up to complete all facilities for the manufacture of chemical weapons or to “ operate in@@ oper@@ able ” , including all machinery for mix@@ ing chemicals .
the conclusion of this process , which is , in fact , the first stage of destruction , is an important mil@@ est@@ one in an ambitious timetable aimed at the destruction of all chemical weapons in syria by mid-@@ 20@@ 14 .
the destruction of facilities means that syria will no longer be able to produce new chemical weapons .
dam@@ as@@ c@@ us , however , still has to start destro@@ ying the weapons and supplies that are available .
it is estimated that there are about 1@@ ,000 tonnes of chemicals and weapons in the country , including mu@@ st@@ ard gas and ner@@ ve gas sar@@ in .
the announcement came at a time when thursday fi@@ ghts in the city of sa@@ fir@@ a were taking place , from which experts say that there is a production facility for chemical weapons and storage facilities , as the uk based company , was doing .
the group of activi@@ sts who have a network of activi@@ sts in syria persecu@@ ted the number of dead declared on thursday , 1@@ 20@@ ,@@ 2@@ 96 people died .
6@@ 1,@@ 0@@ 67 civili@@ ans , including 6@@ ,@@ 3@@ 65 children , are among these .
on the government side , 2@@ 9@@ ,@@ 9@@ 54 of them were under the army of president bas@@ ha@@ r as@@ sad , 18@@ ,@@ 6@@ 78 were govern@@ ment@@ -@@ friendly figh@@ ters and 18@@ 7 leban@@ ese he@@ z@@ bol@@ lah mil@@ i@@ ti@@ as .
the dead also had 2,@@ 20@@ 2 deser@@ ted army soldiers and 5@@ ,@@ 3@@ 75 opposition figh@@ ters , many of whom were foreign@@ ers .
on 25 july , the un estimated the number of deaths in this conflict since march 2011 to 10@@ 0,000 .
this number has not been updated .
the conflict has led to the dis@@ appearance of some two million people .
as@@ sad ’ s troops have been fighting the re@@ be@@ ls in sa@@ fir@@ a for weeks , many of whom have links with al-@@ q@@ a@@ ed@@ a groups .
the observ@@ atory said that there was losses on both sides on thursday , but did not mention details .
the fighting under@@ sco@@ res the danger that chemical weapons inspec@@ tors face , because their mission to liber@@ ate syria from its tox@@ ic ar@@ sen@@ al of arms is a race against time in the mid@@ st of a dead@@ ly civil war .
according to op@@ c@@ w , which works closely with the united nations , the team is “ now convinced that it can support all of the major production and mix@@ ing / filling facilities mentioned by syria and witness their destruction . ”
therefore , “ no further inspection activities are planned at the moment . ”
at the beginning of the week , the inspec@@ tors said that they had completed the first round of checks and that 21 out of 23 of the sites indicated by dam@@ as@@ c@@ us had visited .
due to security concerns , the visit of two institutions was not possible , the inspec@@ tors said .
on thursday , the op@@ wc stated that the two sites had been “ abandoned , ” according to sy@@ ri@@ an statement , and the existing objects of the chem@@ i@@ stry weapons programme had been transferred to other institutions that were in@@ sp@@ ected . ”
it was not immediately clear whether the site in sa@@ fir@@ a was one of the two facilities that the op@@ c@@ w inspec@@ tors could not visit .
syria has put forward a plan for the complete destruction of its chemical weapons , to be approved by the op@@ wc executive committee next month .
“ i prefer to take the hat off the bra@@ very and courage that you all have shown in ful@@ filling the most challenging mission ever undertaken by this organisation . ”
for three years now , the mainly sun@@ ni muslim re@@ be@@ ls have been fighting as@@ sad ’ s government and security forces , which have killed many members of the al@@ a@@ wi@@ tes , in this civil war , of sec@@ ession .
in view of further developments , the head of the observ@@ atory , ram@@ i ab@@ dur@@ ra@@ h@@ man , said that there was a strong explo@@ sion in an air defence facility in the sy@@ ri@@ an coastal province of lat@@ ak@@ ia on wednesday .
the cause of the explo@@ sion was not known , he explained .
an@@ ger at the judgment of bal@@ i bom@@ bers
survi@@ v@@ ors and rela@@ tives of the 20@@ 2 people who died in bal@@ i in 2002 in the bom@@ b attack respon@@ ded with an@@ ger at the ruling for the last of the in@@ sti@@ g@@ ators who were brought to justice .
pa@@ te@@ k , who was considered one of the most sought after people in south-@@ east asia for nearly ten years , was yesterday awarded the title of president for his role in building explo@@ sive tan@@ ks for the bom@@ bing .
with a suspension , he could be released after 15 years .
the 45 year old was convic@@ ted of mass murder for the attack on two night clubs in the popular tourist district of k@@ ut@@ a , where the 20@@ 2 people died .
a guil@@ ty ver@@ dic@@ t was also made in a series of terrorist charges , including a wave of explo@@ si@@ ves on churches in indonesia .
the public prosecu@@ tor had demanded a life sentence , even though it was a pun@@ ishment for the man who was accused of being a master bom@@ b buil@@ der because of his reputation as a “ demo@@ lition man ” .
the decision has pain@@ ful mem@@ ories of june cor@@ teen , a mother from per@@ th who had spent her 3@@ 9-@@ year-@@ old twin to@@ wers jan@@ e and jen@@ ny in the pa@@ te@@ k and his fellow con@@ spir@@ ators .
she said , fighting with te@@ ars , that pa@@ te@@ k should have been sent@@ enced to death .
i really think that he should follow in the foot@@ steps of the other gu@@ ys .
&quot; one should take him to a sho@@ oting command , &quot; said cor@@ teen to a@@ ap .
i have to live every day with the fact that i will not get any more grand@@ children and i will never see my dau@@ gh@@ ters .
the sar@@ i club was made equal to the ground when , on 12 october 2002 , a huge bom@@ b was explo@@ ded in a small tr@@ uck just after 23 : 00 , which had been par@@ ked in front of the night club .
peter hu@@ gh@@ es was at pad@@ dy &apos;s bar , where only 20 seconds earlier a su@@ ici@@ de bom@@ ber killed a bom@@ b .
he fell into com@@ a for a month after the attack and “ died ” three times while he was working on a life support system .
hu@@ gh@@ es said that pa@@ te@@ k deserves the same fate as the other three members of the terrorist cell y@@ em@@ ah islam@@ i@@ ah – am@@ ro@@ zi , mu@@ kh@@ las , and i@@ ma@@ m sam@@ u@@ dr@@ a – who were responsible for the bloo@@ d@@ sh@@ ed .
really , this type should be given the death penalty before anyone else .
to keep him alive – no , there is no reason to let him live .
20 years after killing 20@@ 2 people and having in@@ ju@@ red many hundreds , is not much .
pa@@ te@@ k is the last of the bal@@ i bom@@ bers who stood trial .
he es@@ cap@@ ed arrest for almost a decade , but was eventually arrested in january 2011 in the pa@@ ki@@ stan@@ i city of ab@@ bot@@ tab@@ ad , where us forces killed the former al-@@ q@@ a@@ ed@@ a leader , o@@ ta@@ h , less than four months later .
during the negotiation , a f@@ bi agent said that intelligence reports provided the indication that the pa@@ te@@ k had been in pakistan , in order to visit b@@ in la@@ den , with the aim of strengthening the link between south-@@ east asian groups .
&quot; he did not stand , &quot; said cor@@ teen .
until recently , he has shown no re@@ mor@@ se for the suffering he has inf@@ lic@@ ted on other people .
the judgment was passed before the t@@ enth anniversary of the attack this year , which was celebrated with comm@@ em@@ or@@ ations in bal@@ i and australia .
“ there will be many te@@ ars this year , ” said cor@@ teen .
pa@@ te@@ k may still appeal against his ver@@ dic@@ t .
fa@@ a : passengers can now use electronic equipment in aircraft ( but do not have mobile phone calls ) .
passengers can now travel from the departure to the lan@@ ding to read , work , play , listen to music and use the image of films , but not with the mobile phone , so the new guidelines that will be published on thursday by the federal aviation administration .
but passengers should not expect these changes to be implemented immediately .
how quickly it would be implemented depends on the airline concerned , fa@@ a staff member michael hu@@ er@@ ta stated at a press conference .
airlines must prove to the fa@@ a that aircraft comply with the new guidelines and that they have read the training manu@@ als of the airline staff and the regulations governing the sto@@ wing of equipment in accordance with the new regulations .
the fa@@ a stated that it has already received plans from some airlines to allow the use of port@@ able electronic equipment in aircraft .
among these airlines were del@@ ta and j@@ et@@ blue .
“ depending on the plan ’ s condition , we could approve the extended use of electronic devices very soon , ” said the fa@@ a in a statement .
currently , passengers must have smar@@ t@@ phones , tab@@ lets and other devices swit@@ ched off when the aircraft doors are closed .
you may not re@@ start them until the aircraft reach@@ es a height of three kilometres and the captain has the green light .
when entering the country , passengers must turn it off again and not re@@ start it before the aircraft has lan@@ ded .
under the new directives , airlines whose aircraft are insu@@ red against electronic dis@@ ru@@ ption could allow their passengers to use the equipment even at start , lan@@ ding and on the roll@@ er field , the fa@@ a declared .
most new aircraft and other aircraft used for the use of wi-fi in larger hei@@ ghts are now available .
la@@ ura gl@@ ading , president of the professional cab@@ in crew association , welcomed the changes .
“ if the new regime is safe@@ ly implemented – and we work closely with the airline in this regard – both sides will benefit , ” comm@@ ented gl@@ ading .
we are , frank@@ ly , ti@@ red of having to feel like a wat@@ ch@@ dog on this issue .
however , internet connections remained un@@ available for surfing , ex@@ changing em@@ ail@@ s , text messages or downloading data under three kilometres , explained the authority .
passengers are invited to use smar@@ t@@ phones , tab@@ lets and other devices in flight mode .
so there is still no word with friends , the scr@@ ab@@ ble online game that is the most popular one , the actor al@@ ec bal@@ d@@ win 2011 .
and he@@ avi@@ er devices such as lap@@ top@@ s must continue to be sto@@ wed , as there is a risk of in@@ jury if they fly through the cab@@ in .
mobile phone calls during the flight remain prohibited .
the regulatory authority for telephone calls lies with the federal communications commission ( f@@ cc ) , not with the fa@@ a .
fa@@ a may lift a ban on certain electronic devices at start and lan@@ ding on the basis of the launch and lan@@ ding of electronic equipment at the start and lan@@ ding of the vehicle at the airport .
last month , mark ro@@ sen@@ ker said of the road safety board , safety expert , safety advis@@ er for national transport issues on c@@ bs news , mobile phones are still considered a risk .
“ mobile phones are a real problem , not only because they potentially cause distur@@ ban@@ ces in navigation devices , but because we know from the f@@ cc that the transfer from the air also inter@@ f@@ ere with trans@@ mit@@ ter ma@@ sts ” , says .
a advisory committee of the industry , which has been invited by the fa@@ a to investigate this issue , recommended last month that the government should take a wider approach to personal electronic equipment .
in recent years , pressure on the fa@@ a has increased to loo@@ sen restrictions on use .
cri@@ tics like the democratic sen@@ ator cla@@ ire mc@@ cas@@ kill from mis@@ sour@@ i argue that there is no valid security reason for the ban .
the restrictions are also increasingly difficult to en@@ force , because the use of equipment has become u@@ bi@@ qu@@ it@@ ous .
some studies have suggested that up to a third of passengers are prevented from swit@@ ching off the equipment or from doing so .
the fa@@ a began in 196@@ 6 to restrict the use of electronic equipment by air passengers after reports of distur@@ ban@@ ces to navigation and communication equipment were reported by passengers .
new aircraft are much more dependent on electrical systems than previous generations of aircraft , but they are also designed in this way and approved by the fa@@ a , so that electronic inter@@ ference does not make them any .
airlines have been offering wi-fi , if the airline is up to the flight level for several years .
the custom@@ ized fl@@ yers adapted to wi-fi systems are also more in@@ sensitive to inter@@ ference .
the vast majority of passenger aircraft should be used more effectively in accordance with the new directives , said hu@@ er@@ ta .
today &apos;s electronic devices generally give much less radio radiation than previous generations .
e-@@ read@@ ers , for example , only give minimal radiation when you sc@@ roll around .
but when downloading or sending data , the transmission values are stronger .
among those who support eas@@ ing restrictions on the use of equipment by passengers is amaz@@ on@@ .@@ com@@ .
in 2011 , corporate employees invited a passenger plane full of kin@@ dle e-@@ reader and made a test flight to identify problems , but could not find them .
members of the fa@@ a advisory committee expressed mixed feel@@ ings about the risk of using the equipment .
dou@@ gl@@ as kid@@ d of the national association of airline passengers said he was the head of the dis@@ order caused by the app@@ li@@ ances , even though the risk was minimal .
other committee members said that there were only isolated reports from pil@@ ots who were in charge of distur@@ bing aircraft systems by the aircraft .
the committee recommended that the fa@@ a should allow pil@@ ots to use the instrument lan@@ ding under poor conditions of vision .
a group from the travel industry welcomed the changes and described them as a reasonable accommodation for travellers who are now heavily equipped with technology .
“ we are pleased that the fa@@ a recogn@@ iz@@ es that a pleasant passenger experience does not conflict with safety , ” said ro@@ ger do@@ w , ceo of the u.s. travel association .

is europe &apos;s elite prepared to do business with britain ?
business for britain was launched in april with the intention of bringing the economy together and defining what those who want to do in britain for prosperity and jobs can do in our relations with the eu .
to this end , we have launched the largest and most comprehensive survey among british economic leaders , asking them what they think about britain , the economy , and the eu .
you@@ go@@ v ques@@ tioned more than 1@@ ,000 business leaders who had roughly the size of the uk , sectors , and regions .
the results of the survey will surprise many .
we found that the vast majority of companies are now ex@@ ported outside europe and are focused on countries that need to modern@@ ise and grow , while eu states are stag@@ n@@ ating .
they want the government to establish new trade links with countries like china , india and brazil , rather than to engage in the long and demanding process .
asked about your view on certain legal issues – from anti@@ trust legislation to product legislation – the majority of the economic leaders believe that control of these key competences should be controlled by west@@ min@@ ster .
there was general dis@@ satisfaction with the internal market , as companies have said that the cost of brussels legislation now out@@ weigh@@ s the benefits of being part of europe ’ s trade area – even 40 % of large companies agreed to the same .
finally , and this probably says most , our survey of economic leaders showed that a clear majority had been moving from britain to change the agreement and that a relationship with the eu based on trade was not based on politics .
this re@@ alization , which has been shared by companies of all sizes and leading groups , shows that the economy is pressing for “ meaning@@ ful change ” that will re@@ open the issue of action to britain .
there is a lot at stake – a change to the agreement and better conditions for britain would result in 16 % change in opinion in favour of remaining in the eu in a referendum .
the prime minister should have no doubt : this survey shows that the british economy is behind its plan for re@@ negotiating the british conditions for eu membership .
it also shows that companies are moving from re@@ negotiation to a significant shift in the balance of power back to the uk .
a better deal for the british economy is possible and increasingly necessary , as the eurozone moves toward closer integration of the economy and fiscal union .
the priority must be jobs and growth in britain , as the result of our survey shows , what makes business more concerned about trade and about fundamental change in the brussels approach to regulation .
alex@@ e@@ i mill@@ er of ga@@ z@@ pro@@ m calls the pipel@@ ine in bulgaria the beginning of a new gas era
the construction of the south stream pipel@@ ine in bulgaria marks the start of one of the largest european energy projects , declared the ga@@ z@@ pro@@ m board .
“ today ’ s event is a mil@@ est@@ one : construction work on the bulg@@ arian section of the south stream gas pipel@@ ine , the largest and most important project in europe , has begun , ” said ga@@ z@@ pro@@ m ceo .
the project is a key element in the energy security of the entire european continent .
south stream is to be used for greater diversity in russia ’ s export routes through europe .
a dispute over the treaty between ga@@ z@@ pro@@ m and its counter@@ parts in ukraine , where the majority of russian gas is stored for europe , is a cause for increased risk in conventional routes , such as those of official operators .
mill@@ er said that the direct link to bulgaria , a member of the european union , means that the countries linked to transit countries &apos; geo@@ political risks will be “ dis@@ connected fore@@ ver . ”
bulg@@ arian consumers receive gas from south stream at reduced rates if the entire project is to be launched in 20@@ 15 .
according to ga@@ z@@ pro@@ m , construction works in other secondary countries are to be completed on the planned route at the end of the year .
the pipel@@ ine is estimated to have an annual capacity of 6@@ 2.@@ 3 billion cu@@ b@@ ic metres of natural gas .

hearing before the royal commission : two y@@ m@@ ca staff members are protected from acc@@ us@@ ations against jon@@ a@@ than lord for sexual off@@ ences .
two y@@ m@@ ca employees from new south wal@@ es ( n@@ s@@ w ) are accused of sexual off@@ ences in connection with children before they are accused of being on the child care provider jon@@ a@@ than lor@@ d in 2011 .
but the opening declaration before the commission had stated that the y@@ m@@ ca had never been associated with an incident of sexual violence in the organisation .
phil@@ li@@ p h@@ are was consulted on a case in which a y@@ m@@ ca employee was accused of child por@@ no@@ graphy off@@ ences .
h@@ are said ga@@ il fur@@ ness , one of the commission assi@@ sting law@@ yer , that he knew of the first case , but the second one did not know .
he ad@@ mitted that the y@@ m@@ ca &apos;s opening statement to the commission was also in@@ accurate in claim@@ ing that ‘ there have been external checks by the y@@ m@@ ca to make the y@@ m@@ ca a member of the front line .
evidence to the commission shows , rather , that the y@@ m@@ ca was informed that it had the secon@@ d-@@ lowest assessment of four possible cases in a quality audit of the department of education and communities ( education ministry ) .
h@@ are , who started with 21 at the y@@ m@@ ca , ad@@ mitted that the management had “ gone down@@ wards from me ” in the recru@@ it@@ ment of lord and did not ensure that employees were aware of their obligations .
lord was arrested at the beginning of the year for sexual off@@ ences against twelve bo@@ ys during his two years of activity for the y@@ m@@ ca .
he was sent@@ enced to at least six years in prison .
h@@ are , however , refused to allow the y@@ m@@ ca to be a cultural problem that prevented staff from prosecu@@ ting lord ’ s violations of children ’ s safety .
the staff said that they had observed violations , including that lord had been alone with children , that they had been priv@@ ately treated as bab@@ y@@ sit@@ ters , that they had to sit on his la@@ p , to one that he liked it .
dani@@ elle oc@@ k@@ well , whose chief lord was and who was asked to give a child protection training because she was not allowed to be involved , said that he was not allowed to be a child care officer , jac@@ qu@@ i bar@@ i .
the managing director declared that he would not accept statements from employees that they had not d@@ ared to re@@ im@@ bur@@ se their superi@@ ors .
instead , he said , they have instead expressed their friend@@ ship with lord &apos;s jud@@ g@@ ement , which is why they did not report him .
h@@ are explained that he has sent a letter to the board of the y@@ m@@ ca n@@ s@@ w that the lesson that the organization learned from the jon@@ a@@ than lord incident was too great .
h@@ are said that the decision to force employees to sign confid@@ enti@@ ality obligations shortly after the acc@@ us@@ ations were made was taken by the managing director of the children &apos;s services of y@@ m@@ ca , li@@ am wh@@ it@@ ley .
he said that this should prevent contam@@ ination of the evidence , but it should be ‘ over-@@ ze@@ al@@ ous ’ and po@@ or@@ ly implemented .

the hearing was postpon@@ ed until 20 december .
ton@@ y bla@@ ir said he would miss the chance to return as british prime minister – but ad@@ mits that a com@@ e@@ back is unlikely .
in an interview this evening on the occasion of the fifth anniversary of his reti@@ rement , the 5@@ 9-@@ year-@@ old announced his views on various domestic issues .
since his re@@ sign@@ ation in june 2007 , after a decade of state leadership , bla@@ ir has largely avoided expressing an opinion on british politics , and his comments mostly relate to foreign policy and its role as en@@ vo@@ y of the quar@@ tet peace mission .
when asked whether he would like to return to the prime minister ’ s post , bla@@ ir was removed from london by the london evening standard saying , “ yes , sure , but it is unlikely that it will happen ... ”
when hor@@ se@@ -@@ drawn experts in dro@@ ves found themselves in car@@ di@@ ff to p@@ oun@@ ce the year , they knew that a har@@ sh competition was taking place .
but no one was born on the three years old f@@ ent@@ on kir@@ k@@ land .
the k@@ n@@ ir@@ ps , who is not even in the kin@@ der@@ gar@@ ten and only a few months ago made his first steps , and his sh@@ et@@ land pon@@ y to@@ ff@@ ee dri@@ fted through the three roun@@ ds and got the first round .
the in@@ separ@@ able pair , both equal , were dis@@ placed because of their appearance , behavior and style in the annual competition , which was held by sun@@ ny@@ bank equ@@ e@@ strian centre in ru@@ dry .
in his appearance in competition with men and women with elegant mel@@ ons , he had his hel@@ met in a che@@ e@@ ky corner and led the two years old to@@ ff@@ ee through the ring .
f@@ ent@@ on was chosen by the jur@@ ors for his natural skills in handling the pon@@ y , which lay well above his age .
and to@@ ff@@ ee received top marks for his performance and person@@ ality .
f@@ ent@@ on had to@@ ff@@ ee last march as a gift to his third birth@@ day and since then every day with the sh@@ et@@ land pon@@ y practic@@ ed .
his mother , don@@ na , 30 , said : “ f@@ ent@@ on and to@@ ff@@ ee are a great sp@@ an . ”
they had to compete against the entire field of participants and are filled with gold cup and ro@@ set@@ te .
it was only the second time that he was participating in a competition with to@@ ff@@ ee , and we were all delighted when he won .
he was so per@@ ple@@ x@@ ing that the arena was so beautiful that it was intended to be photograph@@ ed with him .
the little boy from the village of nan@@ ty@@ gl@@ o near eb@@ b@@ w val@@ e , south wal@@ es , follows in the foot@@ steps of his a@@ un@@ t shar@@ on ho@@ wel@@ ls who has been pro@@ p@@ elling horses for over ten years .
ho@@ well ’ s story was : “ the entire audience was like electr@@ ic@@ ised , and everyone fi@@ red and cla@@ pped him . ”
he ran on sand the entire length of the arena and although he looked so tiny , he has done fantastic work .
f@@ ent@@ on is cra@@ zy about animals – he lo@@ ves horses , trac@@ tors and farms and has two ch@@ ick@@ ens to make him look after .
as it has started , it will not take long for it to be on the “ horse of the year ” show – and i am sure that it will do well .
a spo@@ kes@@ man for the annual hor@@ se@@ -@@ show said : “ f@@ ent@@ on is only three , but he knows how to handle his pon@@ y . ”
together they are a great team .
the jury evalu@@ ated f@@ ent@@ on and to@@ ff@@ ee for how well they be@@ aten and presented in the demonstration ring .
they are looking for good cooperation between pon@@ y and leader – and f@@ ent@@ on and to@@ ff@@ ee were the best in the ring .
i am sure f@@ ent@@ on &apos;s sweet clothes have played their part in making this a perfect occasion .
chinese newspaper is said to be “ re@@ formed ” after appeal
a chinese newspaper that has called for the release of a re@@ porter on the front page , accused of de@@ fam@@ ation , should be re@@ formed .
the gu@@ ang@@ z@@ ho@@ u based new express had a rare public call to release the former journ@@ alist chen y@@ ong@@ z@@ ho@@ u .
but chen later ad@@ mitted on television that he had accepted bri@@ bes to write reports about a sub-@@ state company .
now the new express will be subjec@@ ted to “ comprehensive rec@@ ti@@ fication , ” the regul@@ ator explained .
the “ rec@@ ti@@ fication order ” was issued by the press and publications authority , radio , film and television in gu@@ ang@@ d@@ ong .
preliminary investigations have shown that the new express , which is part of the y@@ ang@@ chen@@ g evening news group , will be available between september 2012 and august 2013 , several in@@ accurate reports on the listed company .
“ the ed@@ it@@ orial management of the new express was dis@@ or@@ derly , ” the regulatory authority announced in a statement .
she said that they decided to impose “ administrative pun@@ ishment on chen y@@ ong@@ z@@ ho@@ u and to give him his re@@ porter ’ s license . ”
in addition , the y@@ ang@@ chen@@ g evening news group has been instruc@@ ted to carry out a complete rec@@ ti@@ fication of the new express and has recommended that the relevant persons in charge of the new express be identified and immediately ap@@ point the new express executive team .
chen had written several articles for the new express in which he reported alleg@@ ed financial ir@@ regul@@ arities with a manufacturer of construction machinery called zo@@ om@@ lion .
after being arrested , the newspaper published two calls for his release at the front page and turned behind his journ@@ alist &apos;s work .
but chen then appeared on state television and ad@@ mitted that he had published false reports on pay .
“ in this case , i have damaged zo@@ om@@ lion as well as the entire news industry and its ability to win the public ’ s trust , ” he explained to the state news channel c@@ c@@ tv .
i did so primarily because i was looking for money and gl@@ ory .
i have re@@ alised that i have acted incorrec@@ tly .
following chen ’ s apo@@ logy , the new express released an apo@@ logy on the front page , saying that it failed to read the reports correctly .
several known susp@@ ects have recently been on television making conc@@ essions .
experts say that conf@@ essions are still rout@@ inely en@@ forced , despite a change in legislation at the beginning of the year , in which the authorities were prohibited from forcing anyone to acc@@ use themselves .
the drug tunnel , which has its own railway system , is being discovered between the usa and mexico , is being explo@@ red by the us and mexico .
one of the most sophisticated tun@@ nels for drug s@@ mu@@ gg@@ ling between the us and mexico , which is completely equipped with lighting , v@@ enti@@ lation and electric railway , has now been discovered .
the us authorities described the 120 times 90 cen@@ time@@ ters tunnel as one of the most sophisticated pass@@ ages they have ever found .
the tunnel , which is a zi@@ g@@ z@@ ag pattern over a length of just under six football fields , connec@@ ts storage h@@ alls near ti@@ ju@@ ana , mexico , and san di@@ e@@ go , usa .
there are countless un@@ seen ware@@ houses in the area , making it easier to use dru@@ g-@@ loaded tr@@ uc@@ ks .
the tunnel was closed before drugs were un@@ detec@@ ted in it , the authorities declared .
the tunnel was discovered by means of eight and a half tonnes of mari@@ ju@@ ana and 14@@ 8 kil@@ o@@ gram@@ s of co@@ ca@@ ine , as the court &apos;s records indicate .
three men , according to the authorities , who worked as drivers were arrested for pos@@ session and intended sale of mari@@ ju@@ ana and co@@ ca@@ ine .
they are threatened with prison sent@@ ences of between ten years and a life@@ time if they are guil@@ ty of guil@@ t .
in no@@ gal@@ es , ari@@ z@@ ona , s@@ mu@@ gg@@ lers rely on an extensive underground network of de@@ wat@@ ering channels .
the tunnel is the eigh@@ th large pass@@ age that has been discovered since 2006 in san di@@ e@@ go .
some of the largest tun@@ nels were built after the mari@@ ju@@ ana har@@ v@@ est in central mexico in october , which poses the challenge of the drug car@@ te@@ ls to quickly bring their product to the consumers .
in 2010 , authorities found a pass@@ age of almost 6@@ 40 metres long with rail@@ s , which were taken from a kitchen in a residential house in ti@@ ju@@ ana to two ware@@ houses in san di@@ e@@ go .

actors or@@ lan@@ do blo@@ om has committed himself to separation from his wife , top@@ model mir@@ anda ker@@ r .
in an interview with us journ@@ alist k@@ ati@@ e cou@@ ric , who was on friday ( local time ) , the german press said that blo@@ om , &quot; life sometimes does not go exactly as we would like it to be or planned .

&quot; we will support each other and love each other as parents of fl@@ y@@ n@@ n &quot; .

ve@@ gan@@ ism is , according to le@@ xi@@ ka , sub@@ ordin@@ ated to vege@@ tari@@ an@@ ism , but is very different from this one .
because while vege@@ tari@@ ans are interested in eating cre@@ am ca@@ kes , ice cre@@ am or a powerful ed@@ am , these fe@@ e@@ der@@ ies are not on the menu of a ve@@ gan .
milk , cheese , eg@@ g , besides the wai@@ ver of meat and fish , the ve@@ g@@ ans will not let any animal products - even hon@@ ey will be denied .
what remains , you may ask yourself , but the ve@@ gan di@@ et is characterised by a considerable amount of imag@@ ination .
&quot; bread spre@@ ads are very popular &quot; , explains ute hen@@ kel@@ mann , the owner of the local reform house , who has a variety of special products for ve@@ g@@ ans .
re@@ u@@ ben proc@@ tor also visits the shop at dom@@ gas@@ se .
for 13 years , the native new ze@@ al@@ and ve@@ gan has lived , and in lam@@ per@@ the@@ im he finds ( almost ) everything he needs to live . &quot; in 1997 i completed my di@@ et and became a vege@@ t@@ arian .
the turn of the century was followed by the next step and i became ve@@ g@@ ans .
&quot; the convic@@ tion came not only because of the di@@ et , but because of the sho@@ e selection &quot; , says proc@@ tor , the artificial leather pre@@ fers normal leather .
he realized that it is possible to do it without animal products in other everyday concerns .
ve@@ gan is primarily an eth@@ ics .
&quot; i do not want animals to die for me , &quot; says proc@@ tor the ma@@ xi@@ m of ve@@ g@@ ans who have to cover the whole consumption behaviour .
instead of bur@@ gers , ri@@ gs or rubber bears , i have decided to use the ve@@ gan to quickly discover new products that have increased enthusiasm .
&quot; it &apos;s a double bonus , &quot; says proc@@ tor today , &quot; in fact , ve@@ gan does not represent a ren@@ un@@ ci@@ ation , not an as@@ ce@@ tic , but an en@@ rich@@ ment &quot; .
and it is precisely these conditions that led to the failure of some , even so well-@@ inten@@ tioned , attempts .
&quot; the ad@@ diction factor is a decisive factor that quickly gives up many , similar to smoking , &quot; proc@@ tor represents a comparison .
and applies one : &quot; certain flav@@ ours are not to be found on the animal &quot; .
often it is the sp@@ ices or the type of preparation that make the taste .
&quot; however , you can also produce the same effect in other ways , &quot; explains the ve@@ g@@ ans .
for example , proc@@ tor brings au@@ ber@@ gin@@ es , mus@@ h@@ rooms and a few ve@@ gan sa@@ us@@ ages to the bar@@ bec@@ ue festival .
he is concerned about balanced , varied di@@ et , which is also a very good choice for a while .
of course , you want to have something between your te@@ eth , that is legitimate .
&quot; it should taste , but this is not only to reduce to animal food , &quot; proc@@ tor said .
health damage , food dis@@ orders , another common as@@ sumption , he did not suffer .
for me , the change@@ over has had a positive aspect .
i do not take a foreign cho@@ le@@ ster@@ ol and i have an increased vit@@ am@@ in content .
there are high-@@ performance hall dedicated exclusively to ve@@ gan nutri@@ tion .
&quot; my blood values are excellent , i often check myself , &quot; tells proc@@ tor .
in particular , the lack of vit@@ am@@ in b@@ 12 war@@ ns many ve@@ gan@@ si@@ cs .
&quot; because animals are fed with feed , rather than gra@@ zing in pa@@ st@@ ures , it is question@@ able whether there is a lack of food in the meat that is bought in the re@@ fri@@ ger@@ ator .
ve@@ g@@ ans also have the option of using the co@@ en@@ zy@@ me in the form of tab@@ lets .
&quot; my b@@ 12 values are fine , &quot; he explains .
pro@@ c@@ tor should not go in the direction of food procurement .
after all , basic food@@ stuffs are everywhere and every super@@ market now has so@@ ya milk and other products .
all i need is on the spot .
i only buy something special from time to time .
&quot; many people over@@ look the fact that only finished products are expensive , but that is the case with &quot; ordinary &quot; finished products .
anyway , the preparation of ve@@ gan dishes is much cheaper and less time@@ -@@ consum@@ ing than is generally assumed .
&quot; there is a lot to discover in the kitchen , with a few small sn@@ acks you can achieve good , if not better results in part , &quot; says proc@@ tor .
mar@@ gar@@ ine instead of but@@ ter , a little more ba@@ king pow@@ der and car@@ b@@ onic ac@@ id instead of eg@@ g , with its ve@@ gan cheese ca@@ ke , proc@@ tor could also ast@@ on@@ ish his bro@@ ther@@ -@@ in-@@ law .
family celebra@@ tions give ve@@ g@@ ans a new sp@@ ice .
this is dynamic when you co@@ ok together , and it has a new value .
&quot; the situations that may arise are as different as the people themselves , &quot; says proc@@ tor .
of course , he was also s@@ cep@@ tical .
do you not taste my meal any more ?
&quot; should i feel bad now because i drink milk ? &quot; - at such a question you should ask as a ve@@ gan with fing@@ er@@ tips .
&quot; i do not reject the people , i am part of this society , &quot; proc@@ tor does not want to be a conc@@ ession .
and , more precisely , everyday life does not seem as un@@ familiar as it might be - and ve@@ g@@ ans are not as restricted in everyday life as they usually do .
fast food is also allowed .
pom@@ mes is everywhere !
&quot; many d@@ ö@@ ner shops offer fal@@ a@@ fe@@ l or a vege@@ t@@ arian yu@@ f@@ ka , &quot; says proc@@ tor .
in a piz@@ zer@@ ia he de@@ vi@@ ates from pa@@ sta dishes , or orders a piz@@ za without cheese , all a question of hab@@ it .
the restaurants are slowly getting into this .
&quot; when i started to te@@ ach ve@@ gan to feed myself 13 years ago , it was all much har@@ der , &quot; the new ze@@ al@@ and can identify a development : &quot; you have to talk to people to make them aware of it .
&quot; when there are enough questions , they may be inc@@ lined to add to the menu , &quot; he hopes .
ve@@ gan restaurants develop , such as the com@@ b@@ ü@@ se in man@@ n@@ heim or the café vo@@ gel@@ fre@@ i .
proc@@ tor wants other restaurants to have at least a ve@@ gan dish on the menu .
in fact , ve@@ gan dishes are available for all .
everyone can eat them , so they are exactly the opposite of exclusive .
&quot; meat dishes are exclusive , in the true sense of the word , because they exclu@@ de others , &quot; proc@@ tor says .
&apos;@@ if we want to avoid food scand@@ als , ve@@ gan@@ ism is a safe way of getting the vast majority of it out of the question , &apos; says proc@@ tor .
but buying ve@@ gan products can be a bit difficult at the beginning .
especially if you learn to understand that animal addi@@ tives are also used in pe@@ an@@ u@@ ts as colour@@ ing agents , you seem to be in a position to be satisfied with the eth@@ ics of so many hur@@ d@@ les and quickly fall out of courage .
not only because of this , re@@ u@@ ben proc@@ tor and lars th@@ om@@ sen wrote a book : &quot; ve@@ gan@@ is@@ sim@@ o - animal ingredients and their alternatives &quot; explains the many ingredients that are not only nutri@@ tional but also nutri@@ tional .
&quot; gradually , you develop a scan@@ ner view and know what characters and lo@@ gos you have to pay attention to &quot; it is sometimes better to do small steps than to stand or st@@ um@@ ble , &quot; says proc@@ tor .
ve@@ gan@@ ism , it is an important moral fing@@ er , which stri@@ kes at consci@@ ousness .
perhaps he does not manage to aband@@ on his hab@@ its , but at least he can te@@ ach consumers to take a critical look at his hab@@ its .

tax on foreign property owners against london ’ s bu@@ b@@ ble
the treas@@ ury has provi@@ sion@@ ally calculated the c@@ g@@ t measure , but is still waiting for the final decision of treas@@ ury chancell@@ or george os@@ borne , who has been included in the 2012 budget a st@@ amp tax of $ 1.@@ 25 .
already , revenue from st@@ amp taxes on residential property in the west@@ min@@ ster and ken@@ sing@@ ton &amp; ch@@ el@@ sea districts is exce@@ eding the tax rate of $ 2@@ 7.@@ 8 million in 2012 / 13 .
co@@ ok said : “ after the increases in st@@ amp taxes on high-@@ pric@@ ed housing and the introduction of related legislation against one , it is difficult to claim that high-quality properties are too low tax@@ ed , regardless of the impact of the al@@ ert .
“ but this move could make some foreign investors more re@@ luc@@ t@@ ant to buy property in london , or prevent owners from selling , ” he added .
first-@@ class real estate – the top five to ten percent of the housing market by price – in london ’ s weal@@ thy sou@@ th@@ west bel@@ t , which stret@@ ches from ful@@ ham to w@@ im@@ ble@@ don , has been around the record .

scientists could sh@@ ed more light on the context in which a dog ’ s pregn@@ ancy is related to its mo@@ od .
past research has shown that happy dogs are more like the tail to the right ( from the point of view of the dog ) , while there are hor@@ ny dogs with left side .
but now scientists say that other dogs per@@ cei@@ ve these sub@@ tle differences and can respond to them .
professor geor@@ gio v@@ all@@ or@@ ti@@ gar@@ a , a neu@@ ros@@ ci@@ enti@@ st from the university of tren@@ to , said : “ people know well that the left and right half of the brain respond differently to stimul@@ i , which have positive or negative effects .
here we tried to look at this with other species .
he also noticed that dogs , like humans , have the right half of the brain for movement on the left and vice vers@@ a , and that the two h@@ emis@@ ph@@ ere have different roles in emo@@ tions .
to learn more about how dogs are applied to the lateral pregn@@ ancy of their bre@@ thre@@ n , the researchers supervis@@ ed the animals while they were watching other dogs .
they measured the heart rate of the four-@@ leg@@ ged and analy@@ zed the behavior .
we will probably soon understand why the co@@ ck is getting into one direction , sometimes in the other direction .
professor v@@ all@@ or@@ ti@@ gar@@ a said : “ we have shown dogs movies – either a natural fi@@ del@@ ity or a sil@@ hou@@ ette to make di@@ str@@ acting other aspects .
if the animals saw how an otherwise un@@ prin@@ table dog could move the tail to the right ( from the perspective of the we@@ av@@ ing dog ) , they stayed completely relaxed .
but was the tail tend@@ ency mainly left ( again from the perspective of the dog , the we@@ del@@ t ) , so their heart rate increased and they saw un@@ easy .
professor v@@ all@@ or@@ ti@@ gar@@ a believes that dogs do not inten@@ tionally communicate with each other through these movements .
he is convinced that the dogs had learned from experience what movements they are wor@@ ried about and when not .
he said , “ if you have different encoun@@ ters with other dogs and you want to use we@@ av@@ ing with your tail in one direction more with friendly behavior and the right side produces a less friendly behavior , then you react on the basis of that . ”
researchers say that the findings dog owners , veter@@ in@@ arians and tra@@ in@@ ers can help to better understand the emo@@ tions of their animals .
john br@@ ad@@ sha@@ w , expert in dog behaviour and guest schol@@ ar@@ ship at the fac@@ ul@@ ty of animal health at the university of bri@@ st@@ ol stated that this is not the first study to be examined whether links were being left or wrong .
last year , a team from the university of l@@ inc@@ ol@@ n found that dogs turned their head to the left when they watch an aggres@@ sive dog , and to the right when it is a satisfied dog .
in another research at the university of victori@@ a in canada , the following was : “ dogs are more likely to go to a robo@@ t dog when his tail is we@@ av@@ ed on the left and not right , rather than being un@@ easy .
according to his statement , the differences could arise because the dogs in the various studies the animals in the films or the robo@@ t dogs are not interpreted as dogs .
a study of how dogs react to real dogs could help , he explained .
“ although there is considerable evidence of many different m@@ am@@ m@@ als that the two bra@@ ins are used for different purposes , many of the details still need to be determined – and dogs are no exception to this , ” bra@@ id@@ s@@ w said .
but since their behaviour is simply recorded , it will probably not take long for us to understand why the tail sometimes turns into one , sometimes into the other .

po@@ pe franc@@ is ap@@ points car@@ din@@ als in february , and the first car@@ din@@ als in the city of florence will be appointed in february .
po@@ pe franc@@ is will be presenting new car@@ din@@ als for the first time on 22 february , as the v@@ ati@@ can announced on thursday .
car@@ din@@ als are the most senior cl@@ er@@ ics in the catho@@ lic church after the po@@ pe and they are also the ones who el@@ ect a po@@ pe , so that franc@@ is becomes the first group of men to ap@@ point .
there are currently 20@@ 1 car@@ din@@ als .
however , a car@@ din@@ al that has reached an age of 80 can no longer participate in the po@@ pe ’ s election – a group of 120 “ eligible car@@ din@@ als . ”
in a statement in which the message was announced , father feder@@ ico l@@ om@@ bar@@ di , a speaker of the v@@ ati@@ can , said that there would be a meeting of all car@@ din@@ als before the cere@@ mony was held .
“ po@@ pe franc@@ is has decided to re@@ consider his decision to conven@@ e the consi@@ st@@ ori@@ e in february in advance , so that others can meet to celebrate car@@ din@@ al participation from around the world .
j@@ ack val@@ ero of catho@@ lic vo@@ ices said that the number of eligible car@@ din@@ als will probably be reduced by february .
he said that a po@@ pe usually ap@@ point as many car@@ din@@ als as necessary to reduce the number of eligible car@@ din@@ als to 120 , and so many car@@ din@@ als were killed over 80 , as he would like .
the consistency story next year is important because it is the first since the election of franc@@ is in march this year , so val@@ er@@ o says .
there is currently a certain over@@ han@@ g on the part of europe , and italy in particular .
“ it will be interesting to see if the new po@@ pe car@@ din@@ als are to be appointed from the rest of the world to restore balance , ” he said .
for@@ ty per cent of ca@@ th@@ ol@@ ics live in south america , but they have only a tiny number of car@@ din@@ als .
the car@@ din@@ als will also be the first to be involved since the formation of the council of car@@ din@@ als founded by franc@@ is , a group of eight car@@ din@@ als from all over the world who have the task of carrying out reforms .
in the past , the po@@ pe decided everything on its own .
&quot; now franc@@ is has chosen these eight car@@ din@@ als to help him , &quot; said val@@ ero .
he said that it is “ possible ” that franc@@ is would have to ask the car@@ din@@ als for advice .
but , so far , we have not been in this position – all of this is new .
val@@ ero said that typically the bis@@ ho@@ ps from large places were called car@@ din@@ als , but ste@@ ak francis@@ co “ full of surpris@@ es – we know not to know who he was appointed . ”

the returned models were delivered between august 1 and september 10 .
the delivery of the g@@ m tr@@ uc@@ ks began in june and represents the most important model start of the leading us car manufacturer since the in@@ solv@@ ency restructuring in 2009 .

the cr@@ y for des@@ pair of an obama elec@@ tor@@ ate
i have elected president obama twice in the hope that change is possible .
he says that obama has made comm@@ end@@ able efforts to break the dead@@ lock of republic@@ ans .
bloc@@ king policy does not exc@@ use the site problems of ob@@ am@@ ac@@ are , the dr@@ one attacks , the bloc@@ k@@ ade attacks , and the attacks on the internet .
obama ’ s mem@@ o@@ irs of the 2008 election campaign are a sad remin@@ der of what might have been possible .
na@@ than@@ i@@ el p. mor@@ r@@ is is a student at har@@ v@@ ard medical school in the second year .
i am reading a terrible sad book at the moment .
it is a book i thought it would be a great help to me during the dec@@ ep@@ tive second year of my medical studies and to give me hope again .
it is called &quot; the aud@@ acity to win &quot; ( courage to win ) and describes the mem@@ o@@ irs bar@@ ack obama ’ s presidential election in 2008 .
when i finish with my patients &apos; records in the evening and go to bed , the book takes me back to a time when politics inspired millions and gave a speech bre@@ ath .
the election was a lands@@ li@@ de victory , and news spo@@ kes@@ men held to underline the historic significance of this hour .
my class@@ mates we@@ pt with joy and my parents collected all the newspapers they could find .
a young team of vi@@ sion@@ aries was on the way to the white house and the nation was ready for change .
when obama came into office in 2008 , he had an agreement value of 82 % .
and then i close the book .
swit@@ ching back to the present is a bad awa@@ k@@ ening as if you were taken out of a dream .
it is difficult to remember these optim@@ istic times – they seem to be a v@@ ague memory , a sad remin@@ der of missed opportunities .
in the years since i first voted , something has actually changed .
but it is simply not something i could have imag@@ ined .
i recognise the great and versa@@ tile things that obama has achieved , from the adoption of the affordable care act ( c@@ c@@ p ) to military take@@ -@@ off .
i agree that the party political bloc@@ k@@ ade is too much in the way of over@@ la@@ pping our nation &apos;s efforts to move our nation forward : immigration reform , a public option for hospit@@ als and the closing of public health insurance .
but , having repeatedly accused the obama administration of having been a member of colleagues and acqu@@ a@@ int@@ ances , i have ended with my attempts to explain .
i have reached a point of political des@@ pair .
republic@@ an bloc@@ k@@ ade politics cannot explain why ta@@ pping foreign leaders is not allowed .
it cannot explain why the national security agency should collect data on the privacy of americans and why wh@@ ist@@ le@@ b@@ low@@ ers are pun@@ ished , which is open to state mis@@ conduct .
it cannot explain why an@@ war al-@@ aw@@ la@@ ki , an american citizen , was mur@@ dered without trial , nor why public funding and education policies had been exce@@ eded during the presidential elections .
it does not justify the results of a report which says that the white house &apos;s efforts to calm the media are the “ most aggres@@ sive ... since the ni@@ x@@ on government . ”
and , more recently , it cannot exc@@ use the in@@ ability to make progress in the more than three years since the adoption of the affordable care act .
i do not know if that is what i should have expected .
whether i should have understood at 18 that the work of government contradic@@ ts the political campaigns that prece@@ ded it .
it is clear that the members &apos; office is not a predic@@ table course , as an opposition party and inci@@ dental events such as the new@@ town mass@@ ac@@ re shape public debate .
but when i look at the examples above , they seem to be largely elected by the government itself .
and that bo@@ thers me the most .
i voted again in 2012 for obama , not because i was delighted with his candi@@ d@@ acy .
mit@@ t ro@@ m@@ ney posed a conf@@ using and un@@ sophisticated alternative , he seemed to be unable to define his direction and positions .
i had the impression that a second term for obama , free from pressure from future elections , would ful@@ fill the hope we have heard about for so long .
but , with the decline in the approval rat@@ ings for obama to below 45 % this week , the return to 2008 has become har@@ der .
it is a reason for my long@@ ing for the many promises that have dis@@ appeared into th@@ in air .
this week i read a section in the book that describes how obama can avoid a severe loss against clin@@ ton in the pen@@ n@@ sy@@ l@@ v@@ ania pre-@@ election .
in a meeting with the election agents following the decision , he told his staff that they had to get back on track and follow the purpose of their cause .
“ i want us to re@@ discover our magic , ” he said .
we must remember who we are .
five years later , mr president , and i could not agree more with you .
the views expressed in this comment are exclusively those of nat@@ han@@ i@@ el mor@@ r@@ is .
cli@@ ve pal@@ mer claims that prime minister ton@@ y ab@@ bot@@ t has had a conflict of interests over paren@@ tal leave .
the bil@@ li@@ on@@ air@@ e and me@@ p cli@@ ve pal@@ mer say that prime minister ton@@ y ab@@ bot@@ t would be in conflict of interest in his plans for paren@@ tal leave because his dau@@ gh@@ ters would become pregn@@ ant and could therefore benefit from it .
the mining mag@@ n@@ at , which is engaged in a judicial dispute over the payment of $ 6 million in co2 tax , claimed that when he asked questions from the table , whether he was in a conflict .
the pal@@ mer united party could win up to four votes in the sen@@ ate , which are important for deci@@ ding whether to lower co2 and mining taxes or cut them .
but pal@@ mer claimed that only ministers could have conflicts of interest and that the dau@@ gh@@ ters of ab@@ bot@@ t would benefit personally from the laws .
&quot; he is in a great conflict of interest when it comes to paid paren@@ tal leave , because if one of his dau@@ gh@@ ters becomes pregn@@ ant , he has a direct interest in whether or not she gets holiday , &quot; said pal@@ mer .
two months after the election , the pal@@ mer election commission declared pal@@ mer ahead with 53 votes after the re@@ count officially the winner of the sun@@ shine coast seat of fair@@ fax .
pal@@ mer called for a review of the voting coun@@ ting process to speed up .
ton@@ y ab@@ bot@@ t &apos;s daughter fran@@ ces and brid@@ get .
if these elections were to be decided two months after the end of the vote ?
“ we need a better system , ” he said .
why should we not have a system where we can mar@@ ry in , enter the data into a computer , immediately choose and then leave at 6.@@ 30 am ?
pal@@ mer also cri@@ tici@@ zed the use of p@@ enc@@ ils when marking the bal@@ lot papers .
use them because you can then wi@@ pe out the results if you do not like them ?
tun@@ ing p@@ enc@@ ils today is incredible .
the electoral commission has examined the options for electronic voting and recently adopted a joint legislative proposal with new ze@@ al@@ and .
pal@@ mer , 59 , explained that to its policy is an international airport for the sun@@ shine coast and that it will be “ very serious ” to take its new office .
a public office is about public service .
“ we are not seeking any re@@ ward other than that of history , namely that we can serve at a critical time of this community , ” he said .
r@@ bs is sus@@ pending two fore@@ x trad@@ ers
the royal bank of scotland has two deal@@ ers from its fore@@ x department , so two people who are familiar with the situation ; this is another indication that the currency is being used worldwide .
some of the world ’ s largest banks , including u@@ bs , bar@@ cla@@ ys , deutsche bank , and r@@ bs , confirmed that they had been in contact with the authorities in the world ’ s largest financial market , which daily gener@@ ates 5.@@ 3 tr@@ il@@ lion dollars .
the two deal@@ ers would be the first r@@ bs employees to be suspended in the expanding investigation that has been followed by the li@@ b@@ or inter@@ bank scand@@ al .
the bank , which has not comm@@ ented on the suspension , confirmed this month that it will receive information requests from authorities .
“ our investigations on this subject are continuing and we are working fully with the f@@ ca and other regulatory authorities , ” said the bank two weeks ago .
last month , people close to the situation said that the r@@ bs had not read the records of e-@@ ma@@ ils and inst@@ ant messages sent from and to a previous deal@@ er to the uk regul@@ ator , the financial conduct commission .
this deal@@ er , richard us@@ her , had left r@@ bs 2010 and is now expected to de@@ part from its current position as european head of fore@@ x spot trading at j@@ p@@ mor@@ gan .
ro@@ h@@ an ram@@ ch@@ and@@ ani , head of the european spot trading at cit@@ i , was released this week and mat@@ t gar@@ din@@ er , form@@ erly the leading currency trad@@ er at bar@@ cla@@ ys and u@@ bs , was appointed by char@@ ity .
none of these deal@@ ers has been accused of any mis@@ conduct .
the us@@ her inst@@ ant message group included ban@@ kers in bar@@ cla@@ ys and ci@@ ti@@ group , said the people close to the situation .
u@@ bs announced this week that they have taken steps against some of their staff after the swiss regul@@ ator fin@@ ma had declared that they had committed alleg@@ ed man@@ ip@@ ulation of the currency market in a number of swiss banks under investigation .
at least six authorities worldwide – the european commission , fin@@ ma , the swiss competition authority we@@ ko , the f@@ ca , the us department of justice and the hong kong monetary authority – are currently dealing with alleg@@ ations of a lack of transparency .
h@@ s@@ bc , ci@@ ti@@ group , j@@ p@@ mor@@ gan and credit su@@ is@@ se have also launched internal investigations or have received information requests from authorities , said familiar people about the situation .
banks are going through inst@@ ant messages and e-@@ ma@@ ils from several years in search of cases of mis@@ conduct .
the news of these investigations has left trad@@ ers in a com@@ motion in an area that has become one of the most prof@@ itable in trading units of investment banks in recent years , but this year is under pressure because of low vol@@ umes , which are so different .
some ban@@ kers have tried to play the aff@@ air down and said that it is almost impossible to ignore the extensive and highly liquid currency exchange market .
a leading trad@@ er noticed that despite the huge daily volume of foreign exchange trading , the frag@@ ment@@ ation of liqui@@ dity between the various trading platforms and the increasing use of their own internal platforms was not allowed to lead to banks ’ “ becoming a problem .
the news came out the same day , when credit su@@ is@@ se announced that she had sent a london exchange tr@@ aded fund vend@@ or this week .
the bank immediately informed the competent authorities and co@@ operates with them .
“ we are sure that the trad@@ er has acted alone and that the matter has been contained , ” credit su@@ is@@ se explained .
the f@@ ence on the be@@ ch@@ t@@ le p@@ lot pain@@ ts the f@@ ence of the building on the p@@ lot .
a group of the citizens &apos; initiative &quot; sch@@ we@@ iz@@ er wi@@ ese &quot; has created the f@@ ence on the bec@@ h@@ t@@ le p@@ lot at the spa promen@@ ade in bad her@@ ren@@ al@@ b .
it also clean@@ ed and wi@@ den@@ ed the foot@@ path , it says in a press release .
the planned covering of the dec@@ ay@@ ing house in the re@@ ar part of the property was not allowed for security reasons , as the site is threatened with sli@@ pping .
al@@ f@@ red ab@@ el , who currently man@@ ages the property , had completed the decor@@ ation campaign with his colleague rein@@ hard dom@@ ke of the bi .
before the action of the bi was a transparent with the message &apos; we are for &apos; .
this distur@@ bed the 20 or so members of the citizens &apos; initiative little in their action .
her mo@@ tto on the big pos@@ ter was &quot; we are against building ru@@ ins &quot; .
it wanted to raise the risk of even bigger ru@@ ins on the swiss me@@ ado@@ w - should the giant project fail one day .
in con@@ vers@@ ation with many pas@@ ser@@ s-@@ by before the &quot; building site &quot; it became clear that some citizens believe that the re@@ alisation of the city project will be a better thing for many , although not a few have the same questions about bi &apos;s dimension .
but they are beginning to re@@ sign , because the city is drag@@ ging on with these answers , they are said to be from the bi ’ s side .
as has been said , the public statements made by the may@@ or also have an impact .
may had said in the local council meeting that he had not thought it would be possible for the thermal ba@@ ths to be closed if the population decided against the plans for a swimming and wellness complex on the swiss me@@ ado@@ w .
some people seem to be quite fri@@ ghten@@ ed , others see them as &apos; cru@@ de attempts at black@@ mail &apos; on the part of the population , as stated in the press release of the bi .
the bi than@@ ked the don@@ ors for the color and all the help@@ ers .
ran@@ gn@@ ick sch@@ el@@ len for sch@@ ir@@ is : man@@ e no s@@ wal@@ low king
so satisfied r@@ al@@ f ran@@ gn@@ ick with the current high form of bun@@ des@@ lig@@ a table leader red bu@@ ll salzburg is also , so disappointed was the sports director of the &quot; bu@@ lls &quot; demonstrated by the re@@ fe@@ re@@ es .
&quot; there is currently a dangerous tend@@ ency for man@@ e and al@@ an to fall into the category of s@@ wal@@ low k@@ ings , &quot; he took the two off@@ ensive wi@@ z@@ ards at a press conference in salzburg in sch@@ wal@@ ben@@ k@@ ings on thursday .
the most recent cause for ran@@ gn@@ ick ’ s criticism was yellow for man@@ e at 3 : 0 v@@ s. gr@@ ö@@ di@@ g last sunday , when the sen@@ eg@@ al@@ ese were accused of acting - which was not a bad thing .
&quot; a star@@ k mis@@ decision , &quot; ran@@ gn@@ ick said , the re@@ fe@@ ree har@@ k@@ am described as &quot; completely over@@ bur@@ den@@ ed &quot; .
har@@ k@@ am would also have contributed &quot; his part &quot; to the es@@ cal@@ ation between salz@@ bur@@ g-@@ co@@ ach ro@@ ger sch@@ mid@@ t and gr@@ ö@@ di@@ g tra@@ iner ad@@ i h@@ ü@@ t@@ ter after the match .
he def@@ ended his german comp@@ at@@ ri@@ ot , saying : &quot; i would have beha@@ ved in the same way as ro@@ ger sch@@ mid@@ t in every single situation . &quot;
sch@@ mid@@ t himself wants to be out of touch with his colleague after the sch@@ arm@@ ü@@ t@@ ter had been in contact with his hus@@ band .
i do not know why .
&quot; for i am the one who was off@@ ended , &quot; emphasi@@ zed the 4@@ 6-@@ year-@@ old .
in view of the success of the event , ran@@ gn@@ ick agreed to a p@@ raise .
&quot; there are only two words for that , &quot; he said .
there is not much to be said .
the way the team plays is particularly impressive .
that is something that should continue .
change of the car@@ pet during the winter transfer time will be very rare .
there are no great reasons to change anything .
&quot; except a player as@@ ks for the wish that he or she will leave the club , &quot; ran@@ gn@@ ick made it clear .
supreme court confir@@ ms obama ’ s health law
it is a great victory for the obama administration : the us supreme court decided today that the close to bar@@ ack obama is a key health law .
by five votes to four , the jud@@ ges rul@@ ed that the individual mandate of the patient protection and affordable care act – it comp@@ els us citizens to reach a satisfactory level of health insurance by 20@@ 14 or to pay a penalty by 20@@ 14 .
the supreme judge john ro@@ ber@@ ts sid@@ ed with the four more liberal members of the chamber , while the jud@@ ges sc@@ alia , thomas , ali@@ to , and ken@@ ne@@ dy decided against it .
the court also confirmed the remaining sections of the 27@@ 00 pages law and also expressed the view that the requirement for the health law that states should either accept or comply with the conditions for access to medic@@ aid is sufficient .
the legal proceedings against the law were conducted by 26 states and the national federation of independent business .
the law was en@@ forced by all leading republic@@ an presidential candidates , including the ultimate challeng@@ er mit@@ t ro@@ m@@ ney , in the 2012 pre-@@ election campaign .
norway : nor@@ we@@ gian village is making itself felt with giant mir@@ r@@ ors of light .
with huge mir@@ r@@ ors , the inhabitants of a nor@@ we@@ gian village have brought light to their dark valley .
due to the low sun@@ light level , the ve@@ st@@ f@@ jor@@ d valley in r@@ ju@@ k@@ an sin@@ ks in the shadow of the surrounding mountains from autumn to spring .
with three gi@@ gan@@ tic refl@@ ec@@ tors at 45 metres al@@ titude , a century dream came true on wednesday .
&quot; finally ! &quot; , may@@ or ste@@ in@@ ar ber@@ gs@@ land sh@@ ou@@ ted at the start cere@@ mony in t@@ v@@ 2 .
some of the inhabitants of the valley were able to sit on sun@@ chairs , while others were using sun@@ gl@@ asses for safety .
until now , sun@@ -@@ hun@@ gr@@ y people had to go to a nearby summit with a cable car in winter .
ten years ago , the local artist martin an@@ der@@ sen presented the proposal to ste@@ er the ra@@ ys with mir@@ r@@ ors into the valley .
but this basic idea has ex@@ isted in the village since 19@@ 13 .
after several years of debate , the council had finally obtained the 5 million k@@ ron@@ er ( around eur 6@@ 15 000 ) expensive project .
a similar construction has been giving vi@@ gan@@ ella , the italian alpine village , a winter sun@@ shine for several years .
post is hardly emp@@ ti@@ ed on sun@@ days
&quot; many citizens will not have noticed the red points for sunday sle@@ eping are still on various letters .
a f@@ dp request confirmed this .
on sun@@ days and public holidays , only in front of the post office building in ern@@ st-@@ lu@@ d@@ wi@@ g-@@ stras@@ se 36 and in j@@ ak@@ o@@ b m@@ ü@@ ll@@ er-@@ stras@@ se 1 in h@@ ü@@ t@@ ten@@ fel@@ d .
whether in ho@@ f@@ heim or ros@@ eng@@ ar@@ ten , empty also sunday , the answer to the f@@ dp question will not be answered .
the f@@ d@@ p ’ s social and youth policy spo@@ kes@@ man , fr@@ it@@ z r@@ ö@@ h@@ ren@@ bec@@ k , wants to make up for this .
sunday sle@@ eping is an important postal service , especially at termin@@ als .
&quot; this company is th@@ in despite the price increase for letters on january 2013 rad@@ ically and un@@ reasonable &quot; .
thomas bit@@ t@@ ner , group and city committee chairman of the liberal group , supports his group colleagues : &apos; what an@@ no@@ ys me is the fact that there are cl@@ am@@ eless empty hours here or that they have been deleted .
the post office is a long way from being close to the people .
&quot; at least the mail@@ boxes in the neu@@ ch@@ â@@ tel and ros@@ eng@@ ar@@ ten districts must be emp@@ ti@@ ed again on sun@@ days , &quot; says bit@@ t@@ ner and r@@ ö@@ h@@ ren@@ bec@@ k un@@ is@@ on@@ o .
the city of the city of the city , too , was rul@@ ed by the fact that , especially non-@@ mobile citizens , a let@@ ter@@ box with sunday sle@@ eping could also be reached on foot .
r@@ ö@@ h@@ ren@@ bec@@ k in the municip@@ al parliament asked if the city council plans to talk to the post about this .
may@@ or er@@ ich ma@@ i@@ er rep@@ lied that the post did not communicate with lam@@ per@@ the@@ im .
however , as he knows , there is also a sunday sle@@ eping in ho@@ f@@ heim .
your party has indeed voted in favour of priva@@ tisation .
&quot; then decisions are taken elsewhere , &quot; ma@@ i@@ er said .
frankfurt parking fees should increase significantly
the hotel is very clean and the staff is very friendly .
the city &apos;s mag@@ i@@ str@@ at is discussing a proposal for a traffic de@@ z@@ ent ste@@ fan maj@@ er ( green ) this morning .
the parking fee is therefore to be increased by 50 % .
however , it is not the price that should be raised , but the time inter@@ val of parking c@@ loc@@ ks and parking ticket machines should be reduced from 30 to 20 minutes .
in december , the city council will have to decide on the next meeting of the municip@@ al authorities .
the retail committee of the i@@ h@@ k frankfurt considers this &apos; not a good idea &apos; .
the hotel is very clean and the staff are friendly .
the german transport association believes that an increase after two decades &apos; &apos; is &quot; quite appropriate and actually long over@@ due &quot; .
public transport will also become more expensive .
fre@@ u@@ den@@ stadt : fast action is the host for the fast action !
the men i of the ts@@ v fre@@ u@@ den@@ stadt had to be brought to the sch@@ ill@@ er school gym in re@@ ut@@ ling@@ en with a narrow cad@@ re against the t@@ g g@@ ö@@ n@@ ingen by the sw@@ ab@@ ian al@@ b .
the el@@ ders were on the other side of the net with an experienced team .
it soon became apparent that she , even for age reasons , was not entirely satisfied with the rapid actions of the city &apos;s enthusi@@ asts .
with the hard and placed sur@@ charges , the go@@ wn@@ inger did not get very easy .
they repeatedly missed the opportunity offered by sim@@ on sch@@ en@@ k and e@@ du@@ ard schul@@ z to clean up pass@@ ports and attacks via the network and were not at the disposal of block defence .
two high first row win@@ s clearly demonstrated the superi@@ ority of the city of fre@@ u@@ den@@ stadt in all matters .
in view of this crus@@ hing and determin@@ ing performance , the third set was then made a little la@@ x and s@@ nee@@ zing at the 3 : 0 final ( 25 : 13 , 25 : 14 , 25 : 22 ) .
on 2 november the tv ba@@ i@@ er@@ s@@ br@@ on@@ n , who is able to win a clear victory in n@@ ag@@ old , will be a much more powerful oppon@@ ent on the field .

in the b-@@ class , the mur@@ g@@ tal@@ hal@@ le in ba@@ i@@ er@@ s@@ br@@ on@@ n was home to the second ba@@ i@@ er@@ s@@ br@@ on@@ n and fre@@ u@@ den@@ stadt teams .
they delivered a highly competitive two-@@ hour match .
ner@@ v@@ ousness on both sides caused errors and pun@@ c@@ tu@@ ation , especially in ball pic@@ king ; even on pass@@ ports , precision was sometimes poor and in some critical game scenes prevented it from over@@ coming .
in this high-@@ performance , very balanced encounter , the t@@ v-@@ team of mar@@ c@@ us bl@@ as@@ ut@@ to consistently voted for the great physical effort and a pleasant commitment of both teams .
day of care at the small eng@@ lish@@ -@@ hu@@ t .
the fifth day of care in the after@@ mat@@ h of the natur@@ a 2000 project &quot; ob@@ er@@ ho@@ tz@@ en@@ wal@@ d &quot; was attended by a group of committed participants at the small eng@@ lish@@ -@@ speaking hu@@ t in ib@@ ach .
the report is based on the suggestions from the public that the view into the valley should be cut off from this day in the area of the hu@@ t , said may@@ or hel@@ mu@@ t ka@@ is@@ er .
many hi@@ kers , ka@@ is@@ er said , described this area as the gl@@ am@@ our of the gor@@ ge platform where the landscape is the ideal setting for wonderful views .
he than@@ ked the present for their willingness to cooperate and stressed that the day of care was a suitable instrument for facilit@@ ating the connection between man and nature .
it gives every citizen the opportunity to acc@@ ent@@ u@@ ate in nature itself .
at the same time , the tourist aspect can also be taken into account in ecological terms .
fri@@ e@@ deri@@ ke tri@@ bu@@ ka@@ it , the department of nature conservation of the presidency of the federal republic of fri@@ e@@ deri@@ ke tri@@ bu@@ ka@@ it explained this ecological aspect following the welcome given by ti@@ l@@ man bol@@ l@@ ach@@ er , who had taken over the pat@@ ron@@ age of good .
the tourist destination of the wide@@ -@@ ranging view is , according to tri@@ bu@@ ka@@ it , the goal of keeping the old all@@ m@@ end@@ we@@ id@@ fel@@ d with its specific protected habit@@ at types , which has grown up to a certain extent .
certain species , such as rare but@@ ter@@ f@@ lies and gr@@ ass buff@@ s , can no longer overcome barriers in the form of forest land .
they need these free links to conservation .
tri@@ bu@@ ka@@ it said that she did not want to miss this opportunity to break a l@@ ance for the planned bio@@ sphere area .
this planning includes not only se@@ am@@ less integration of the current measure .
a bio@@ sphere area also offers the opportunity to achieve sustainable economic and ecological development based on the internationally recognised unesco world heritage list and thus to ensure a continuous addition to the world heritage list of the world heritage sites .
after these different versions , the head of the territory of chri@@ stop@@ h we@@ h@@ le and life project manager cor@@ ne@@ lia bis@@ ch@@ off shared the help@@ ers in groups .
the larger trees had already been be@@ aten in advance , the fore@@ stry tr@@ uck may be available .
a group of help@@ ers should be concerned about the release of wa@@ x bus@@ hes and about the maintenance of a dry stone bar .
the aim was to have a clear view at the view@@ point .

google , sam@@ sung , hu@@ a@@ we@@ i for nor@@ tel patents su@@ ed for nor@@ tel patents
the group that has thousands of previous nor@@ tel patents ti@@ ghten@@ ed an av@@ al@@ an@@ che of complaints about patent infringement against mobile phone manufacturers on thursday , including google , the company that was involved in in@@ solv@@ ency au@@ ction .
ro@@ ck@@ star , the con@@ sor@@ ti@@ um that has awarded nor@@ tel patents for $ 4.@@ 5 billion , has been claim@@ ing sam@@ sung electronics co lt@@ d. , ht@@ c cor@@ p , hu@@ a@@ we@@ i , and four other companies .
ro@@ ck@@ star is owned by apple , microsoft , black@@ ber@@ ry , er@@ ic@@ s@@ son and sony .
google is accused in seven cases of patent infringement .
patents concern technology , which includes search terms on the internet with relevant advertising , such as the compla@@ int that this is at the heart of google &apos;s search engine business .
sam@@ sung ’ s representatives , hu@@ a@@ we@@ i , ht@@ c and ro@@ ck@@ star were not immediately accessible .
sam@@ sung , hu@@ a@@ we@@ i and ht@@ c are producing mobile phones that are threatened with use of google &apos;s and@@ ro@@ id operating system , which is in sharp competition with apple and microsoft mobile products .
in 2011 , google issued an initial bid of $ 9@@ 00 million for nor@@ tel patents .
google increased its offer several times and last offered $ 4.@@ 4 billion .
after the nor@@ tel patents of ro@@ ck@@ star were out@@ bid , google motor@@ ola acquired mobility for 12.@@ 5 billion dollars , a business that was also used in part by motor@@ ol@@ as library to patent .
“ although google failed to address the issue of patents in the au@@ ction , it has not yet won the patents , and is continuing to do so , ” says the law@@ yer .

mo@@ ham@@ med mor@@ si is leaving the o@@ ath , but his tri@@ um@@ ph day should not be the end of egypt ’ s political disputes .
the islam@@ ist mo@@ ham@@ med mor@@ si promised a “ new egypt ” when he was the first freely elected president of the country , thereby s@@ wor@@ n the success@@ or of hus@@ ni mu@@ bar@@ ak , who spent 16 months earlier .
with his in@@ aug@@ ur@@ ation in the supreme constitutional court , mor@@ si was also the first freely elected islam@@ ist president of the arab world and egypt ’ s fifth head of state since the fall of the mon@@ arch@@ y about 60 years ago .
he put the o@@ ath before the 18 ri@@ bb@@ ons dres@@ sed in black ro@@ bes of the court , which is located at the n@@ ile and has followed an ancient egyp@@ tian temple .
“ we are stri@@ ving for a better future , a new egypt , and a second republic , ” said mor@@ si at the cere@@ mony that was broad@@ cast live on state television .
“ today , the egyp@@ tian people have laid the foundation for a new life – absolute freedom , real democracy , and stability , ” said 6@@ 0-@@ year-@@ old mor@@ si , an engine@@ er and member of the muslim bro@@ ther@@ hood , a us engine@@ er .
hundreds of soldiers and police guar@@ ded the building when mor@@ si was att@@ acked shortly after 11 o &apos;@@ clock in a small car con@@ vo@@ y .
only a few hundred sup@@ porters had gathered in the court to appla@@ u@@ d the new president , and , unlike the presidential pr@@ un@@ k , the mu@@ bar@@ ak era , traffic was only hal@@ ted for a short time , so that the car could be stopped .
as an un@@ char@@ is@@ matic “ spare wheel ” of the bro@@ ther@@ hood , his personal presti@@ ge has been a success since his victory and a friday speech , in which he has not only been a candidate for the islam@@ ists , but also for all .
“ egypt is now a civil , national , constitutional , and modern state , ” he declared in a blue suit with red ti@@ e .
mor@@ si later went to ca@@ iro university , where he was supposed to make his in@@ aug@@ ural speech .
he was officially welcomed by an army cha@@ pel that played the national an@@ them , which he listened to in his position of lord .
the military leader of the field mar@@ sh@@ al hus@@ sein tan@@ ta@@ w@@ i was present .
on his arrival , he was welcomed by hundreds of people present in the largest aud@@ it@@ ori@@ um of the university , with speakers from “ the army and the people are one hand ” .
the bas@@ tion sec@@ ular education , built in 19@@ 08 , was a university of ca@@ iro that developed in the 197@@ 0 ’ s into a strong@@ hold of islamic student groups .
mor@@ si put a symbo@@ lic o@@ ath on ta@@ h@@ ir square on friday , the birth@@ place of the u@@ pris@@ ing that took place last year at the end of mu@@ bar@@ ak ’ s author@@ itarian rule , and he vo@@ wed power .
but , with the official o@@ ath being laid before the court , and not before parliament as usual , it bo@@ ws to the will of the military , indic@@ ating that the power struggle will continue .
mor@@ si ’ s speech at ta@@ h@@ ir square was full of dramatic popul@@ ist ge@@ st@@ ures .
fal@@ ken@@ ber@@ ger dis@@ co offers two great even@@ ings .
the new season in the fal@@ ken@@ ber@@ ger dis@@ co &quot; blue vel@@ ve@@ t &quot; has begun .
today &apos;s friday evening is called &quot; pum@@ p this party &quot; , tomorrow saturday evening we will be having a 10-@@ 25 party .
hot be@@ ats and cool sounds are naturally played by the organiz@@ ers on both days .
workers cr@@ ash@@ ed from lad@@ der : heavy in@@ jury
when replac@@ ing a def@@ ec@@ tive ou@@ ter felt , a 5@@ 1-@@ year-@@ old work@@ er cr@@ ash@@ ed on thursday in eg@@ gel@@ s@@ berg from a lad@@ der and seriously in@@ ju@@ red .
the man from lam@@ pre@@ ch@@ t@@ sha@@ us@@ en wanted to have a broken heating sen@@ s@@ ation on the outside fac@@ ade of a gu@@ es@@ thouse .
when he came to the roof tr@@ un@@ k , the path sli@@ pped and the man fell on the concrete floor .
he suffered severe in@@ jur@@ ies and was killed with the rescue helicop@@ ter &quot; chri@@ stop@@ hor@@ us 6 &quot; in the state hospital salzburg .
rap@@ es in south africa : two life imprison@@ ment
nine months after the brut@@ al ra@@ pe and mu@@ ti@@ lation of a 17@@ -@@ year-@@ old girl in south africa , the off@@ en@@ der has twice been sent@@ enced to life on friday .
the station sab@@ c reported this .
the victim later died from the consequences of severe in@@ jur@@ ies .
joh@@ ann@@ es k@@ ana was already guil@@ ty at the beginning of the week of crime .
the act had caused hor@@ ror nation@@ wide .
the 2@@ 1-@@ year-@@ old an@@ ene boo@@ y@@ sen had been in bre@@ d@@ as@@ dor@@ p near cape town in february in an industrial area .
the doctors fought for the survival of the victim for 14 hours , but in v@@ ain .
the young people &apos;s sight was so hor@@ ri@@ fic that the care@@ rs and si@@ sters needed psycho@@ logical support .
k@@ ana had ad@@ mitted during the trial that he was in a bar on the night of the night with boo@@ y@@ ses .
he also conce@@ ded to have be@@ aten and rap@@ ed them , but he denied to pay for the death of the girl .
the police initially started with several off@@ enders , but made two susp@@ ects redun@@ dant because the evidence against them was not enough .
the public prosecu@@ tor also stressed during the process that she was convinced that k@@ ana was alone at the time of the attack .
ra@@ pe is already a common oc@@ curren@@ ce in south africa : around 64 000 advertis@@ ements are made every year for sexual violence .
that is almost ten times the amount in germany , but with 82 million people , it has a significantly higher population than south africa ( 50 million ) .
police and women &apos;s associations in south africa do not , however , appreciate the dark figure in the event of sexual violence at 10 to 25 times .
jum@@ bo visits black forest ham
jum@@ bo looking for the &quot; best ham in the world &quot; : for the tv broad@@ cast &quot; galile@@ o &quot; , the pro@@ 7-@@ star bon@@ n@@ dorf visited .
the speaker makes it clear right from the start : the most important thing for ham is the por@@ k ec@@ cles , tur@@ bom@@ ast is not a good pre@@ requisite .
can ham you get in any super@@ market , that is , a quality product ?
ul@@ i , the head of the big ham factory in the black forest , explains jum@@ bo how the company &quot; ad@@ ler &quot; works in bon@@ n@@ dorf .
&quot; germany &apos;s favourite ham &quot; , as jum@@ bo gave to black forest ham .

16@@ ,000 cu@@ ps per week speak for themselves .
weight , f@@ at content , colour : ul@@ i explains what quality matters .
most pi@@ gs are slau@@ gh@@ tered at six months .
television with the same level ?
details such as ph value of meat also play a role .
the dar@@ ker the meat , the higher the ph value .
&quot; i am e@@ ager to see you measure ro@@ ber@@ to blan@@ co , what happens , &quot; says jum@@ bo cy@@ n@@ ical .
this is where the level of private television is presented in pure culture .
but watching is still worth watching .
the vie@@ wer sees that the disman@@ t@@ ling of the cul@@ ls is still a handic@@ ap .
because : black forest ham is tradi@@ tionally available without b@@ ones on the shel@@ f .
the secret of the ham is the mix@@ ture of sp@@ ices with the salt .
smo@@ ke tower and smo@@ ke hum@@ i@@ di@@ fication remind you op@@ tically of a &quot; sub@@ marine &quot; .
the tr@@ ick : f@@ ir branches provide the special taste of the black forest ham in the smo@@ ke .
20 days in smo@@ ke make the ham almost black .

&quot; he is really delicious &quot; , according to the conclusion of the tv star .

they thought travel agencies are a thing of the past thanks to internet ?
flight centre seems to be resi@@ sting the trend .
the company has increased its profit prospects for the full year and exp@@ ects record revenues from holi@@ day@@ makers in australia and the uk .
the travel company now assum@@ es adjusted pre-@@ tax annual profit from between $ 3@@ 25 and $ 3@@ 40 million , compared to 30@@ 5 to $ 3@@ 15 million in its previous forec@@ ast .
if the current target values are met , this will mean growth of 12 to 17 % compared to the record profit of $ 2@@ 9@@ 0.@@ 4 million in the period 2011 / 12 .
as gra@@ ham tur@@ ner announced , flight centre achieved a total of eight percent profit in the first six months and made a strong start in the second half of the year , particularly in australia and the uk ’ s private business .
“ since the beginning of the year , our ten countries have been prof@@ itable , and some of them are well on track to record annual income before interest and taxes , ” he said .
these include australia and the united kingdom , which are typically among our strong@@ est ear@@ nings recipi@@ ents .
in australia , the leisure industry reco@@ vered in the second half of the year , creating a slightly weak@@ er market for business trips .
it was equally good for the flight centre leisure business in the uk , while business customers spend less here too .
the us business reco@@ vered from the seas@@ onal weak@@ er first six months , so that a profit of € 1.@@ 7 billion is expected for the third con@@ secu@@ tive year .
flight centre shares increased by 3 c@@ ents yesterday to $ 3@@ 8.@@ 20 .
schools will become more focused on mathem@@ a@@ tics , sp@@ elling and gram@@ mar .
in courses on english literature , students will have to learn at least one piece of sha@@ kes@@ pe@@ are , a novel of the 19th century , romantic ly@@ ric@@ s and contemporary british nov@@ els from 19@@ 14 .
the examination also includes “ un@@ seen texts ” to help wider reading .
the combined course is composed of english literature and language .
from 20@@ 15 , students must take an independent g@@ c@@ se ex@@ am for language , with strong incentives to use english literature as a separate quali@@ fication .
the ministry of education will tomorrow present the new english and mathem@@ a@@ tics cur@@ ricul@@ um – the first subjects that have been rad@@ ically re@@ designed .
other nuclear areas will be modified next year .
in a separate initiative , of@@ qu@@ al , the supervisory authority for aud@@ its , will be known for a re@@ organization of the g@@ c@@ se structures , including a new ben@@ ding system and less course work .
in a speech in the summer , education minister michael go@@ ve said that there is “ broad consensus that we need to reform our audit system to restore public confidence , ” emphasi@@ sing that g@@ c@@ ses would “ challenge . ”
studies show that in english schools less time is spent on mathem@@ a@@ tics – 1@@ 16 hours a year or three hours a week per school year – than in most other countries .
by contrast , austr@@ ali@@ an schools te@@ ach on average 14@@ 3 hours a year and students in sing@@ apor@@ e are given 13@@ 8 hours .
there will be no formal requirement to allow more time for mathem@@ a@@ tics in the timetable , but for coalition cir@@ cles , it is said that the comprehensive mathem@@ a@@ tical test – combined with a greater weight of the subject in the ran@@ king system – will be combined .
the cur@@ ricul@@ um focuses more on “ problems from the right life ” , including financial mathem@@ a@@ tics .

sal@@ em : joh@@ anna ra@@ h@@ ner at the ec@@ um@@ en@@ ical forum of talks in sal@@ em .
at the next ec@@ um@@ en@@ ical discussion forum on monday , october 21 , in the new museum of the castle , the topic is &quot; to hel@@ l with hel@@ l - the@@ ological considerations on how to deal with the last things today &quot; .
professor joh@@ anna ra@@ h@@ ner is professor .
the ec@@ um@@ en@@ ical forum of talks is an initiative of the catho@@ lic and ev@@ angel@@ ical par@@ ishes sal@@ em , the sal@@ em castle and the cul@@ tur@@ am@@ tes bo@@ den@@ see county .
joh@@ anna ra@@ h@@ ner wants to investigate the question in the forum of how people are today taking the &quot; last things &quot; after death .
if people in the past had known too much about this in the past centuries and had taken pictures of heav@@ en and hel@@ l , &quot; which have shaped our imag@@ ination to date , &quot; the contemporary pro@@ p@@ he@@ tic doc@@ tr@@ ine of the world is characterized .
&quot; the greater hope is christian through the religious critique .
she &apos; provided us with so many question marks that the ex@@ cl@@ am@@ ation signs had come to us &apos; .
joh@@ anna ra@@ h@@ ner continues : &quot; but the crucial challenge remains the an@@ ger of death . &quot;
this is linked to the question of the long@@ ing &quot; dre@@ aming that everything ends well &quot; .
joh@@ anna ra@@ h@@ ner , born in bad@@ en-@@ ba@@ den in 196@@ 2 , studied catho@@ lic the@@ ology and bio@@ logy at the al@@ ber@@ t-@@ lu@@ d@@ wi@@ gs university of fre@@ i@@ burg from 198@@ 2 to 1989 .
she received her ph@@ .@@ d. in 1997 as a dr. the@@ ol , also in fre@@ i@@ burg .
the hab@@ ilitation of fundamental the@@ ology and ec@@ um@@ en@@ ical the@@ ology followed in 2003 at the west@@ f@@ ali@@ an wil@@ hel@@ ms university .
since 2010 , joh@@ anna ra@@ h@@ ner has been a chair of systematic the@@ ology at the institute of catho@@ lic the@@ ology at the university of kas@@ sel .
ho@@ is@@ ling@@ en : more than 100 young ca@@ th@@ ol@@ ics from kle@@ ine heu@@ berg confirm their commitment to the firm at the time of its launch .
in two services of wor@@ ship , 10@@ 1 young people aged 15 and 16 from the ministry of the ministry of the little heu@@ berg have been fir@@ med .
the morning of the religious service was accompanied by the group lau@@ dat@@ o-@@ si , in the afternoon of the youth cho@@ ir the spirit .
the reception of the firm &apos;s sac@@ ram@@ ent gave young people a say in their b@@ ap@@ tism and asked for the strength of the holy spirit .
the company &apos;s activities have been growing in recent months , under the direction of di@@ ak@@ on rein@@ er stre@@ h@@ ner and the cooperation of numerous local members on the great festival .
in various projects , they learned about various tasks of christian community life and together they experienced the youth day in sub@@ mis@@ sive valley .
ill@@ men@@ see : second mountain bike race will deli@@ ght participants with a lot of fun .
in beautiful weather 2@@ 14 cy@@ cli@@ sts came to ill@@ men@@ see to complete the round course on the hill cha@@ ins around the lake .
this is what ul@@ rich kno@@ bel from the organiz@@ ing sports association ill@@ men@@ see tells .
the participants included , in particular , the short distance of 15 kilometres and 300 metres of al@@ titude , numerous bi@@ kers who had their ho@@ b@@ by in competi@@ tions .
two german top junior ri@@ ders were also at the start of this race : fe@@ li@@ x bad@@ er from bad wal@@ d@@ see and pas@@ cal tre@@ u@@ bel from a@@ ach@@ -@@ lin@@ z came up with the recommendation to take the german champion@@ ships .
these two could , as expected , be dec@@ lining from the field .
as in the previous year , fe@@ li@@ x bad@@ er managed to save a small advance into the finish and def@@ ended his title as overall winner of short distance .
in second place , pas@@ cal was again able to be fi@@ du@@ ci@@ bly placed .
the ladies were te@@ res@@ a du@@ ell@@ i of the team night@@ m@@ are , which made it to the top of the winning sta@@ ir@@ case .
in second and third place anne ade@@ l from ill@@ men@@ see and leon@@ ie drivers from ow@@ ingen .
a positive development is the increasing number of drivers who live or work in the municip@@ ality .
not only in terms of performance , the whole range of athle@@ tes was represented .
the age structure was also very high in the last 70 years , at the youn@@ g@@ est and more than 70 years , among the oldest star@@ ters .
in the main race this year even more absolute top athle@@ tes were on the start .
four drivers were able to resi@@ st the regional top drivers .
among them phili@@ p@@ p pan@@ ger@@ l , a mountain@@ bike semi-@@ pro from the black tus@@ k racing team .
pan@@ ger@@ l and his team team team co@@ operated two times with world champi@@ ons in the 12@@ -@@ hour driving .
this year he became european champi@@ on in this special discipline .
ro@@ land b@@ aller@@ ste@@ dt , who has already won two german championship tit@@ les in the du@@ ath@@ l@@ on , also played his part .
after 45 kilometres and 9@@ 00 metres of al@@ titude , a wh@@ im@@ per hit fin@@ ale was reached in the finish in front of the three-@@ lake hall .
pan@@ ger@@ l is the first to race over the finish line .
only one second behind it was the rout@@ ine b@@ aller@@ ste@@ dt who won second place in the overall ran@@ king .
at the same time , her@@ mann and war@@ th@@ mann came to the finish as the third of the overall ran@@ king .
in the women &apos;s rating , christi@@ ane co@@ h@@ s@@ mann was the fas@@ test time in the main race .
are@@ ane bl@@ er@@ sch won second place in the category of binding force before nat@@ as@@ ch@@ a wer@@ ner from stutt@@ gart .
athle@@ tes and help@@ ers were very satisfied with the smooth and well-@@ organized running of the event .
on the way through mu@@ d , rivers and jun@@ g@@ le , free medical care and free medical care for the kids
dr. geor@@ ges b@@ wel@@ le provides free medical assistance in remote villages in camer@@ o@@ on .
b@@ wel@@ le and his team spend almost every weekend tre@@ ating hundreds of patients .
there are not many doctors in the west african country , just one for 5@@ ,000 people , only one for 5@@ ,000 people .
vote here or with your mobile device
dr. geor@@ ges b@@ wel@@ le is one of the top 10 of the “ c@@ n@@ n her@@ oes of 2013 ” .
you can be a top 10 vote for him or any other her@@ o to make him the “ c@@ n@@ n her@@ o of the year ” .
the winner will receive $ 2@@ 50@@ ,000 to continue his exceptional work .
for 21 years , geor@@ ges b@@ wel@@ le saw his si@@ ck father lose his consci@@ ousness and became hospit@@ als , which were not equipped with the means to help him .
j@@ ame@@ f b@@ wel@@ le was born in 198@@ 1 in an accident near y@@ a@@ oun@@ d@@ é , the capital camer@@ o@@ on .
he had only one broken arm at first , but then a infl@@ am@@ mation was formed that was related to his brain and was able to cause a hem@@ at@@ om there that would cause him to be inf@@ ected for the rest of his life .
“ there was no neu@@ ro@@ sur@@ ge@@ on in camer@@ o@@ on , ” says geor@@ ges b@@ wel@@ le .
we would have got it out of camer@@ o@@ on if we had had the money .
instead , b@@ wel@@ le spent years trying to turn his father into over@@ crow@@ ded clin@@ ics and hospit@@ als to seek treatment , which she had to offer .
“ it is not easy , ” comments b@@ wel@@ le .
the hotel is located in the heart of the city , just a few minutes from the main shopping street and the main shopping street .
there are a great many patients .
some people are even dying because they have to wait .
the situation has hardly changed since b@@ wel@@ le &apos;s father died in 2002 .
in camer@@ o@@ on , there is only one doctor for every 5@@ ,000 people , according to the world health organisation .
in contrast , the relationship in the united states is with a doctor for 4@@ 13 people .
but even if there was a doctor for them , most camer@@ o@@ ons could not afford to visit .
two out of five people in the country live below the poverty line and almost three-@@ quarters of health spending in the country is private .
“ the only problem you have is poverty , ” says b@@ wel@@ le .
and poverty makes it impossible to enjoy life .
his father and so many of his comp@@ at@@ ri@@ ots suffered to see b@@ wel@@ le decided to do something about it .
dr. geor@@ ges b@@ wel@@ le and his volunte@@ er team conducted 700 free operations last year .
he became a doctor himself and works as a v@@ as@@ cu@@ lar sur@@ ge@@ on in the central hospital in y@@ a@@ oun@@ d@@ é .
he also founded a non-@@ profit organization called as@@ co@@ vi@@ me , which is travelling to rural areas on week@@ ends and offers free medical care there .
since 2008 he and his voluntary group have helped nearly 3@@ 2@@ ,000 people .
almost every friday he co@@ ws and up to 30 people are in mini@@ buses and ride with the snow@@ -@@ covered medical equipment on the roof over un@@ pav@@ ed ter@@ rain to the villages that need help .
not always , everything goes smo@@ o@@ thly .
once again , they have had to push the vehicles through rivers and mu@@ d .
but when they arrive , they will be received like her@@ oes : a ban@@ quet , sing@@ ing and dance , and the best accommodation the place has to offer .
in these villages , free medical care is really a reason to celebrate and b@@ wel@@ le – with its wide sm@@ ile and its boun@@ dless energy – is happy to be at the happy party .
the next morning the team starts exam@@ ining hundreds of patients .
“ we treat 500 people per journey ” , says b@@ wel@@ le .
they come from a radi@@ us of 60 kilometres around the village – and this on foot .
each of these weekend clin@@ ics offers medical care in a number of areas .
many people are accused of mal@@ aria , tu@@ ber@@ cu@@ lo@@ sis , mal@@ nutri@@ tion , di@@ abe@@ tes , par@@ a@@ sites and sex@@ ually transmitted diseases .
others receive cr@@ ut@@ ches , don@@ ated gl@@ asses or free birth certific@@ ates – a document that is required for school , but that many poor families simply cannot afford .
in the evening , the team carri@@ es out simple operations with local an@@ aes@@ the@@ sia .
the operations are usually carried out in a school , town hall or apartment ; after the procedure , patients are up and go to the recre@@ ation area to make room for the next .
the lighting for the op and dis@@ inf@@ ection equipment is provided by the group gener@@ ator and thus b@@ wel@@ le and his volunte@@ ers work until early morning hours at the company .
it is a stren@@ u@@ ous pen@@ sum , but the village musicians usually help to keep the team motivated .
&quot; they are dr@@ um@@ ming all night , so that we can remain awa@@ ke and continue our work , &quot; says b@@ wel@@ le .
on sunday the team will go back to the city , ti@@ red but proud of the work done .
the group – a mix@@ ture of camer@@ o@@ on doctors and foreign medical students – conducted 700 free operations last year , knowing that they had made a huge difference in their work for the people to whom they helped .
a man explained that the free operation of a broken post he received now allows him to re@@ work .
“ this is changing the future of my family , ” the man said .
besides the weekend clin@@ ics and his sur@@ ge@@ on at the hospital b@@ wel@@ le also works in private clin@@ ics in y@@ a@@ oun@@ d@@ é at night .
with this second job he finances 60 % of his char@@ itable activity , so b@@ wel@@ le ; the rest comes from private don@@ ations .
“ i really do not know when he sle@@ eps , ” says k@@ ati@@ e o &apos;@@ mal@@ ley , who died at dre@@ x@@ el university in phil@@ ade@@ l@@ phi@@ a medicine in the second year and volun@@ tar@@ ily joined the group in b@@ wel@@ les .
he is always either in hospital or trying to raise money for the organization so that he can go on these campaigns .
for medical and nur@@ sing students such as o &apos;@@ mal@@ ley , who come from the usa and europe and support b@@ wel@@ le , this is a chance to gain practical experience that they would never have at home .
“ we can be in the process of operations where we help to dis@@ gu@@ ise blood or hold the instruments for dr. b@@ wel@@ le , ” explains o &apos;@@ mal@@ ley .
that would be impossible in america as a medical student in the second year .
students usually pay for their journey to camer@@ o@@ on themselves and bring frequently don@@ ated san@@ itation material .
once you have arrived in y@@ a@@ oun@@ d@@ é , b@@ wel@@ le will take care of accommodation , transport and instruc@@ tion .
“ he is without doubt a her@@ o , ” says o &apos;@@ mal@@ ley .
he dedic@@ ates his life to this organisation and his desire to help the camer@@ o@@ on people knows no borders .
for b@@ wel@@ le , the almost constant work is not a burden .
to help others to live happ@@ i@@ er and thereby fulfil a promise he made to his father gives him great pleasure .
“ i am so happy to do this work , ” says b@@ wel@@ le .
and i am thinking of my father .
i hope he will see what i do .
i do it to bring people back to lau@@ gh and to alle@@ vi@@ ate the pain .

excell@@ ently mas@@ tered the fight
the role of the s@@ anti@@ ago , the old man in hem@@ ing@@ way &apos;s nov@@ elle &quot; the old man and the sea &quot; , hor@@ st jan@@ son is cut to the body .
jan@@ son himself is an old h@@ ate in his profes@@ sion , the art of acting .
the old man s@@ anti@@ ago cannot be fo@@ ol@@ ed by fishing .
so the two simply comple@@ ment each other tremend@@ ously .
it is almost assumed that the wr@@ ink@@ les in the nec@@ k of the old man , of whom the fisher@@ man spe@@ aks man@@ olo , can be seen .
when s@@ anti@@ ago ti@@ red of life , sitting on the chair , jan@@ son e@@ ht .
in addition , the role of the old fisher@@ man is completely a character role that jan@@ son excell@@ ently man@@ ages .
hem@@ ing@@ way told the story of a figh@@ ter , a cour@@ ageous man who does not give up and ultimately , through his knowledge and his will , fought against the fish .
jan@@ son is widely considered the sole actor on stage .
he man@@ ages to attract the audience ’ s attention , so that his mono@@ lo@@ gues do not have a moment of bo@@ re@@ dom .
his efforts to finally bring the fish to the surface of the water are so real that the spec@@ t@@ ators forget that the sea is made of blue illu@@ min@@ ated water bott@@ les .
director j@@ ens has@@ sel@@ mann is leaving the old man in the boat in front of the fishing village .
during the performance he brings the active scene into light : the hu@@ t of s@@ anti@@ ago , the bar of sing@@ er mari@@ e-@@ lu@@ ise gun@@ st , the bar , which with her songs and her splendid voice the life of ku@@ b@@ as .
the four musicians play cuba &apos;s rhy@@ th@@ m and are also guests of the bar .
tourism : des@@ cent to the roman@@ s
the town of cologne is a se@@ wage canal from the roman age , which is about 120 metres long .
if you visit cologne , don &apos;t miss the cathedral .
the two to@@ wers rise into the sky about 15@@ 7 metres and make it the second highest church building in europe .
but few visitors who visit the two f@@ ili@@ gre@@ e church to@@ wers , susp@@ ect that there are also a lot to discover under the cathedral .
ra@@ iner schul@@ ze is an expert in the subject of cologne un@@ ter@@ wel@@ t .
the service centre of cologne tourism is the meeting point for its guided tours directly at the cathedral .
the tour begins quite un@@ spectacular : &quot; we start in the underground garage &quot; , says schul@@ ze .
in the 197@@ 0s , the city ’ s fa@@ thers wanted a car@@ -@@ free city , and therefore remained only the standing of the rem@@ n@@ ants of the old city wall , which was not too big .
most users of the multi-@@ sto@@ rey car park are therefore also rus@@ hing past the remains of the roman empire and only park their car .
but if you look more closely , you will find a metal mes@@ h separ@@ ating arch@@ et@@ y@@ pe in the park dec@@ k d@@ 2 .
the ru@@ ins of the pal@@ e@@ oli@@ th@@ ic stone are about five metres high .
&quot; there are remains of the roman city wall that were built in the second half of the first century after christ , &quot; says schul@@ ze .
before it goes back to the light of day , schul@@ ze is leaving the participants at the upper level to take a look at a dark , 15 meters deep sha@@ ft .
this is the well of the old cathedral , which is unfortunately hardly seen .
the next stop of the tour is the pre@@ tori@@ um , and here the participants get back into the depth .
we are witn@@ essing the seat of the once most powerful man north of the alps , the pre@@ cur@@ sor of the c@@ ca@@ a .
what c@@ ca@@ a means is that a visitor wants to know .
&quot; the ab@@ bre@@ vi@@ ation stands for &quot; col@@ onia cla@@ u@@ dia ara ag@@ ri@@ pp@@ in@@ en@@ si@@ um &quot; , which means &quot; city of roman right and city of ag@@ ri@@ pp@@ ina , founded under the name of la@@ us@@ anne .
and the pre@@ t@@ ori@@ um is the former palace of state , the center of power of the roman empire on the rh@@ ine .
from the fo@@ o@@ th@@ ills of the exhibition , a tunnel access to the roman se@@ wage channel is maintained here on about 120 metres in length .
&quot; you can qui@@ e@@ tly play a piece along the so-called clo@@ ac@@ a maxim@@ a if you want , &quot; schul@@ ze che@@ ers the guests .
schul@@ ze is a surprise .
after getting the key at the chec@@ k@@ out , he will lead the group to a 16 meter deep , wal@@ k@@ able sha@@ ft .
&quot; we are now in the mi@@ k@@ we , a rit@@ ual jewish bath , &quot; he explains .
the jewish community built its bath deep into the ground to get to the gr@@ ound@@ water that was used for rit@@ ual washing .
to this day , the lower end of the mi@@ k@@ we , whose origin@@ s date back to the eigh@@ th century , has been marked by var@@ ying levels of the rh@@ ine .
the mi@@ k@@ we will be part of an archae@@ ological zone in the town hall square , for which construction will begin shortly .
however , a few years will still be passed before completion .
le@@ g almost ch@@ op@@ ped : re@@ circulation of ro@@ ck@@ er process
a bloo@@ dy attack in the ro@@ ck@@ er@@ mil@@ i@@ eu will be re@@ ro@@ lled after more than four years .
a trial of attemp@@ ted death , dangerous physical in@@ jury and material damage against two thir@@ ty years has been tried by the district court of frankfurt ( oder ) .
it is accompanied by strict security measures .
the def@@ end@@ ants remained silent .
they should have been active in the ro@@ ck@@ er scene and were then among the band@@ i@@ dos .
the public prosecu@@ tor acc@@ uses you of having to work in fin@@ ow@@ fur@@ t with unknown accompl@@ ices in june 2009 on three men in a car and have taken it upon them .
all the victims were seriously in@@ ju@@ red , a man would almost have lost his le@@ g .
the victims are to become the compe@@ ting group of hel@@ ls ang@@ els .
one is said to have been a high-@@ ran@@ king member from berlin .
it seems that a hun@@ t had been prece@@ ded by several cars .
the charges have been lev@@ elled at batt@@ les and a demonstration of power .
the two def@@ end@@ ants were acqu@@ it@@ ted in the first trial in early 2012 .
a court spo@@ kes@@ man said at the time that it was impossible to prove that men were actually involved in the bloo@@ dy f@@ eu@@ d .
the perpe@@ tr@@ ators had wor@@ n mas@@ ks and had not been recognized .
the federal court of justice rejected the judgment after the public prosecu@@ tor &apos;s court had re@@ viewed the court and referred it back to the court of land for further trial .
one of the def@@ end@@ ants is currently open for another off@@ ence .
the first was the reconstruction of the processes in the actual night .
as a witness , the commissioner to be identified at the time was charged .
the focus was on mobile phone calls from the def@@ end@@ ants and other people who had inter@@ cep@@ ted the police .
the difficulty is that ro@@ ck@@ er almost always appe@@ aled to a law that they o@@ be@@ y - not to say .
the same applies to the victims .
in the first process , only one of the victims had been packed out .
prosecu@@ tor ste@@ fan gol@@ fi@@ er of the public prosecu@@ tor &apos;s office frankfurt ( oder ) said on demand that new trac@@ es have appeared since the last trial .
ele@@ ven other days of negotiation have been set for the process .
the thro@@ wing away society does not think
the night was long , the music l@@ oud and the mo@@ od good , but eventually it goes home .
but in the bel@@ ly of the people on the fron@@ t-@@ passenger and back@@ -@@ seat hun@@ ger is felt .
of course , some cock@@ tail or spar@@ k@@ ling wine may be responsible for this !
what is more obvious than ch@@ illed to go to the next drive in order to get a little bit of fun ?
i admit that i am happy to be there when there is late night or early morning at fa@@ st@@ food .
a few pom@@ mes , a col@@ a , a bur@@ ger - and then ni@@ x like back home and into bed !
but on the home road , the obvious differences between me and other hun@@ gr@@ y dis@@ co fans are notic@@ eable .
what can you fail to be able to keep your fast food bag on a regular basis ?
the weekend is a great place to have a dis@@ car@@ ded bag of paper on the streets and on parking lots .
&apos;@@ why ? &apos; i wonder .
are people too do@@ of to respect the bags home with respec@@ table until the next du@@ st@@ b@@ in ?
it is not just that the paper product has sh@@ un@@ ned the landscape .
the bag has already covered up traffic facilities such as traffic control panels and caused accidents .
what does that mean by the said &apos; dispos@@ able society &apos; but not &apos; , it probably does not even know what that word actually means .
the hotel is very clean and the staff are friendly .
there would be a few bags of bags that would be more or less ni@@ x - unlike the street where no one can sit on the food resi@@ du@@ es of other rum@@ m@@ els .
i can see that the day is coming when cities and municip@@ alities are being bloc@@ ked - and the fa@@ st-@@ food policy is being used for their bags .
obama ’ s health re@@ treat
after intense criticism , president obama yesterday back@@ fi@@ red on his of@@ t-@@ repeated , clear promise : “ if you like your health insurance , you can keep it . ”
after hundreds of thousands of their insu@@ rer received a letter of termin@@ ation , the republic@@ ans thre@@ w a warning to the president over the last few days that he was dec@@ ei@@ ving the american public .
yesterday , obama rela@@ ti@@ sed his original promise .
“ the vast majority of citizens who have a working health insurance can keep it , ” he said in a speech in bo@@ ston .
in response to the numerous media reports on dis@@ mis@@ s@@ als , obama called on the americans who received such communications to seek a new insurance in the free market .
most citizens could thus obtain better , more comprehensive health insurance at the same price or more cheap@@ ly than predic@@ ted .
“ they come a better deal , ” he said .
the government found it un@@ surprising that the five percent of the population who had taken out insurance themselves were looking for a different tari@@ ff , because their contract did not meet the new standards after the affordable c@@ are .
“ i would like to say to these americans directly : they deserve better , ” said se@@ beli@@ us at a hearing before the european parliament ’ s energy and trade committee in washington .
se@@ beli@@ us , who is responsible for implementing the affordable care act , explained that the start of the online platform since october “ mis@@ er@@ able ” was mis@@ er@@ able .
“ i am as fru@@ stra@@ ted and an@@ gr@@ y as everyone else , ” she said .
i am determined to reg@@ ain their trust .
this phrase of an up@@ set se@@ beli@@ us to a consult@@ ant behind her at yesterday &apos;s hearing in the representative &apos;s house was rejected after a dispute with the republic@@ an member , bil@@ ly long .
after more than three hours of hearing , long se@@ beli@@ us repeatedly be@@ gged the question of why the “ architec@@ t ” of the affordable care act could not be volun@@ tar@@ ily transferred to a govern@@ ment@@ -@@ spon@@ so@@ red insurance .
government in jerusal@@ em confir@@ ms attack on sy@@ ri@@ an air base does not confirm attack on sy@@ ri@@ an air base not to be an air base .
an american government official who wanted to remain anonymous has made a statement to the american news channel c@@ n@@ n on thursday to the effect that israeli figh@@ ter plan@@ es had plan@@ ed an air base in syria one day earlier .
the aim is to have &apos; ro@@ c@@ kets and equipment &apos; , which the israeli government fe@@ ared would be detri@@ mental to the leban@@ ese he@@ z@@ bol@@ lah , said the president of the c@@ n@@ n .
sy@@ ri@@ an and leban@@ ese media and the arab al-@@ arab@@ i@@ ya station had previously reported that the base in the port city of lat@@ ak@@ ia was closed on wednesday night , thursday .
the israeli television channel channel 2 showed satellite images of the base in lat@@ ak@@ ia , on which russian missi@@ les were deplo@@ yed in the s-@@ 12@@ 5 new@@ a and a battery of sa@@ -@@ 3 missi@@ les .
in@@ security the government of jerusal@@ em has officially not confirmed the attack .
however , the news agency re@@ u@@ ters quo@@ tes an equally anonymous israeli government official saying that he believes that israel is carrying out the attack , but that it is not sure .
a israeli defense minister spo@@ kes@@ man said , in any case , &apos; we do not comment on these reports &apos; .
the journ@@ alist ron ben@@ -@@ y@@ is@@ ha@@ i emphasi@@ zed in the daily newspaper ye@@ di@@ oth a@@ hr@@ on@@ oth that the sy@@ ri@@ an regime had already , or has been successful , tried to launch ground air missi@@ les .
the israeli government has repeatedly war@@ ned that any attempt by syria to use he@@ z@@ bol@@ lah with chemical or other dangerous weapons would be a threat to the pass@@ age of a &apos; red line &apos; .
john ker@@ ry explains in an unprecedented admission that the us sp@@ ying is “ un@@ reasonable . ”
john ker@@ ry suggested with an un@@ expected admission that the de@@ fl@@ ation of the us stance on the country ’ s surveillance programs would be sof@@ ten@@ ed by saying that es@@ pi@@ on@@ age was “ un@@ reasonable in certain cases . ”
the foreign minister also ad@@ mitted that he was dec@@ ei@@ ving himself with bar@@ ack obama in the responsibility of being “ au@@ top@@ il@@ ot ” when the explo@@ sive rev@@ el@@ ations of wh@@ ist@@ le blo@@ om were un@@ covered .
the le@@ ak@@ ed information has turned the us government into a diplomatic stor@@ m of indi@@ gn@@ ation by its allies .
in a video interview speech at the open government conference in london , ker@@ ry said : “ there is no question that the president and i , and others in the government , have learned of some things that are almost done by au@@ top@@ il@@ ot .
he then became the first high-@@ ran@@ king member of the us government to admit that us es@@ pi@@ on@@ age has cros@@ sed a border , but also emphasi@@ zed that no rights have been ab@@ used .
he said : ‘ in some cases this has gone too far in@@ appropri@@ ately . ’
the president is determined to create clarity and is therefore conduc@@ ting a thorough investigation so that no one has to feel that abuse is being used .
i assure you that the rights of inno@@ cent people will not be affected in this process .
ker@@ ry , however , insi@@ sted that the n@@ sa was a force of good , saving many lives through its surveillance operations .
he added : ‘ we are dealing with a new world in which people are willing to take themselves into the air .
there is radical extre@@ mis@@ m in the world that is ob@@ s@@ essed with killing people , bre@@ a@@ thing in the air , and att@@ acking governments .
so what if we were able to inter@@ cep@@ t and stop this before it happens ?
we have indeed seen aircraft cr@@ ash@@ es , attacks on buildings and the killing of people , because we have had experience of such plans in the run@@ -up to them .
meanwhile , us legisl@@ ators will travel to europe to address concerns about america ’ s supposed es@@ pi@@ on@@ age , and to convince europeans of the need to remain competitive in the anti-@@ terrorism effort .
sen@@ ator chr@@ is mur@@ ph@@ y from connec@@ tic@@ ut said he had spoken with representatives of the european parliament and other people this week and was concerned about their threats to get to gri@@ ps with the surveillance of national security agency .
“ it is very important for us national security interests that europeans are more sensitive to global warming in terms of our joint efforts ” , mur@@ ph@@ y said , who was a democr@@ at for the first time in the sen@@ ate and who was president .
i also go to europe to make it clear that we must continue to work together in the fight against terrorism , regardless of your an@@ ger over the n@@ sa programmes .
media reports that the n@@ sa collec@@ ts millions of telephone data in europe have improved relations with some us allies , although the head of the intelligence service has said this week that the reports are incorrec@@ t and based on a single report .
other rev@@ el@@ ations quo@@ ted from documents passed by snow@@ den that the n@@ sa had taken over the mobile phone from chancell@@ or ang@@ ela mer@@ kel and up to 34 other heads of state worldwide .
the head of the national intelligence services , james cla@@ pper , def@@ ended es@@ pi@@ on@@ age among allies as necessary , and declared that this was common on both sides .
in all this u@@ pro@@ ar , mur@@ ph@@ y said that his administration was preparing the congress ’ s trip , which is due to take place this year , and hoped that the delegation would include members from both parties and cham@@ bers .
the names of the other participating members will be published in the coming days .
he said that the exact it@@ iner@@ ary is still being worked out .
while mur@@ ph@@ y emphasi@@ zed that the purpose of the journey is to improve relations , he also said that there should be some “ serious words . ”
he said that european governments must be honest with their people about the kind of sp@@ ying programmes that they themselves have been using for years .
“ while we can change our surveillance programs to better protect europeans ’ rights , they must also address the fact that we do not have to be the only ones to sp@@ y , ” says mur@@ ph@@ y .
meanwhile , john ker@@ ry is on the weekend for a trip to the middle east and poland to get the res@@ ent@@ ment about the us strategy in syria , egypt , and iran , as well as the us surveillance activities .

austr@@ ali@@ an is appe@@ aling against a prison sentence in thailand
a 2@@ 1-@@ year-@@ old woman from sy@@ d@@ ney who was imprison@@ ed in ph@@ uk@@ et for 15 days because she mista@@ ken@@ ly claimed to be arrested by a taxi driver .
ste@@ vi@@ e ro@@ ch@@ elle b@@ am@@ ford was first tried by a provin@@ cial court in ph@@ uk@@ et on june 15 , a false statement .
later , however , the sho@@ oting of a video camera showed that she had safe@@ ly arrived at your hotel after being separated from her austr@@ ali@@ an friend .
the police in ph@@ uk@@ et inter@@ ro@@ g@@ ated b@@ am@@ ford for two days until they thought the story out .
she was there in police forces until the trial .
b@@ am@@ ford was sent@@ enced to 15 days in prison in a de@@ tention centre with a low level of security on the out@@ sk@@ ir@@ ts of ph@@ uk@@ et , rather than in a prison for adult women .
she is the daughter of peter tun@@ ks , a former player of the austr@@ ali@@ an ru@@ b@@ g@@ y-@@ league , who has been cont@@ acting the can@@ ber@@ ra foreign ministry for help with his daughter .
tun@@ ks declared to the sunday te@@ leg@@ raph in sy@@ d@@ ney that the whole family was “ extremely concerned ” about the welfare of its daughter and wanted to have them back in australia .
“ we are naturally very concerned , but we hope that you will be back home as soon as possible , ” said tun@@ ks .
b@@ am@@ ford appe@@ aled against the judgment and is opposed to a deposit of 50@@ ,000 ba@@ ht at large .
austr@@ ali@@ an reports have said that they have since moved to the resort of kr@@ ab@@ i in southern thailand .
the court heard that b@@ am@@ ford was being replaced by a local law@@ yer in ph@@ uk@@ et and was war@@ ned that the government &apos;s appeal would also be used to impose a higher sentence of up to two years in prison .
however , it is also possible that , following the recent ass@@ ass@@ ination of the travel cl@@ er@@ k mic@@ hel@@ le sm@@ ith in ph@@ uk@@ et , thailand might try to end its tar@@ n@@ ished tourist image and thus make it more attractive .
