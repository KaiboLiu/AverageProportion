review : more security for pede@@ stri@@ ans !
they are not 100 metres from each other : on tuesday , a conference will be held in gu@@ t@@ ach on the new b 3@@ 3-@@ pede@@ strian traffic light at the village parking lot - within sight of the older town hall buildings .
two plants so close together : intention or tor@@ to@@ ise ?
this question was raised yesterday by the may@@ or of gu@@ t@@ á@@ n .
&quot; the town hall sample was installed at the time because it was the school trail &quot; , explains the cor@@ ner@@ t yesterday .
k@@ lu@@ ser@@ -@@ traffic lights secure both cy@@ cli@@ sts and bus passengers and mountain residents .
the agreement officially launched yesterday is important for the crossing area of sul@@ z@@ b@@ ach@@ we@@ g / kir@@ ch@@ stra@@ ß@@ e .
we have the museum , two churches , spa gardens , the bus stop , a doctor and a bank as well as the traffic flow from the residential area › gru@@ b ‹ .
&quot; the high traffic and pede@@ strian traffic had to be ensured by another amp@@ li@@ fi@@ er , &quot; says ec@@ ker@@ t .
peter ar@@ no@@ ld from the council of the off@@ enburg region confir@@ ms this .
&quot; according to current measure@@ ments , the b 33 daily passes through the municip@@ ality of gu@@ t@@ ach , approximately 10 percent of which are heavy goods vehicles , &quot; ar@@ no@@ ld emphasi@@ zes .
therefore , the construction of a further traffic light is more than necessary : &apos; safety is just a matter of urgency &apos; , ar@@ no@@ ld says .
in total , four transport shows have been carried out , and a roun@@ d@@ about has been thought about , but because of the close connection in the crossing area sul@@ z@@ b@@ ach@@ we@@ g / kir@@ ch@@ stra@@ ß@@ e .
according to ar@@ no@@ ld , the location of the traffic light m@@ ast was tested before : &quot; using a special for us with particularly long wooden sta@@ ins , the traffic was reduced to a minimum .
the approximately eur 15 000 expensive traffic light system itself is the &quot; most modern thing it has on the market &quot; , explains the ar@@ n@@ ld .
the complex is decorated with col@@ oured le@@ ds , which are so powerful that the light is sh@@ ining from the drivers , for example , even when the sun is low .
and it is also econom@@ ical : the older lighting systems use up to 100 wat@@ ts , the new just eight wat@@ ts .
there are three light systems per direction .
ar@@ no@@ ld explained the new equipment technology : it is equipped with two rad@@ ar sen@@ sors .
if the pede@@ strian pus@@ hes the traffic light button , the upper rad@@ ar sensor tests the traffic situation .
if the road is free , the green is immediately for the pede@@ strian , if not , it takes about 15 seconds .
another rad@@ ar sensor checks whether the green phase for the pede@@ strian has been finished .
&quot; if a group or disabled person were to go out on the streets , the green phase will be extended , so everyone will come safe@@ ly via the train , &quot; ar@@ no@@ ld said .
of course , drivers must be considered partners here and the track monitored .
that was not the case yesterday : hardly had the traffic lights green on , smo@@ ked in a top lam@@ p and the traffic was not even visible .
jo@@ se@@ f win@@ k@@ ler has been writing for more than 30 years the needs of his child@@ hood and youth from the soul .
the disasters of its catho@@ lic village child@@ hood - the lack of voice , the inc@@ lin@@ ation to raw violence and bl@@ un@@ t sex@@ u@@ ality , the close and jo@@ y@@ less@@ ness - have left car@@ in@@ th@@ ia &apos;s po@@ et many times .
the b@@ ü@@ ch@@ ner prize winner is known mainly as the author of pro@@ se , theatre texts are written in his work ra@@ r .
coll@@ age from pro@@ sa@@ tex@@ tes ger@@ hard fres@@ ach@@ er presents for his performance &quot; we@@ t@@ ter@@ l@@ uss auf der z@@ un@@ gen &quot; , which is now in garage x at st. peter &apos;s square .
the theatre maker combines elements from the auto@@ bio@@ graphical style of ro@@ man &quot; der le@@ i@@ gen@@ en &quot; ( 198@@ 7 ) with pro@@ sam@@ ini@@ er@@ ung from &quot; cor@@ p@@ us , his family be@@ lau@@ er@@ d &quot; ( 2003 ) .
on the largely empty stage - important re@@ qu@@ is@@ it@@ ous : a cr@@ um@@ bling bas@@ s , a glass of champ@@ ag@@ ne and a glass of champ@@ ag@@ ne .
the director seems to have been rather slow to trust the text .
the 7@@ 0-@@ minute performance is ex@@ ag@@ ger@@ ated with a wealth of new features and features .
the ac@@ t@@ res@@ ses in particular are sometimes somewhat question@@ able scen@@ ic trans@@ positions .
they are har@@ d-@@ pressed , with their head under water , with their evening ra@@ ys at the wall , and with their heads .
forced into cel@@ lo@@ ph@@ ane or ten@@ der , st@@ acc@@ es them to danger@@ ously high stic@@ ks through the st@@ aging , either mon@@ ol@@ ith or the volume of the sun is completely silent .
the text is based on this har@@ d-@@ working approach , however , and hardly gives any indication .
the best moments have the evening when sung - the band@@ width is from de@@ ep p@@ ong to the night .
only towards the end comes the over@@ la@@ pping performance a little to calm , and win@@ k@@ ler &apos;s absur@@ d hum@@ or looks up .
a black box in the car ?
american road pl@@ ann@@ ers are looking for a source of money to stop the dec@@ lining high@@ way system .
the devices that carry every kil@@ ome@@ tre and store the information to the authorities are core to a contro@@ vers@@ y that has been attemp@@ ted by washington and the planning offices of the states to make the out@@ dated system of us financing american banks .
the normally rather bor@@ ing area of road planning has suddenly caused an intense debate with colour@@ ful al@@ li@@ ances .
liber@@ tari@@ ans have joined forces with environmental groups and advoc@@ ate the need for the government to protect small boxes .
the tea party is hor@@ ri@@ fied .
the american civil rights association ( ac@@ l@@ u ) is also deeply concerned and expres@@ ses a series of data protection concerns .
but , while congress does not agree on a course of action , several states no longer wait .
they are currently exam@@ ining how they can be achieved over the next ten years to a system where drivers can earn more than one m@@ ile .
thousands of car drivers have been using the tac@@ ho@@ graph , some of which are equipped with g@@ ps surveillance , and have already been tested .
this really is a must for our country .
“ it is not something we will only use , ” has@@ an i@@ k@@ h@@ r@@ ata , managing director of the southern h@@ emis@@ ph@@ ere , said .
the way we have managed to pay these taxes will change .
the technology is there .
the initiative comes at a time when the highway trust fund , the national central bank financed by taxes , is being pus@@ hed to the fuel dispens@@ er .
but america is not getting as much fuel as it used to .
cars use less petro@@ l .
the government min@@ eral oil tax of 18@@ .@@ 4 c@@ ents per gall@@ on ( less than 4 euro c@@ ents per lit@@ re ) has not been rising for 20 years .
politicians d@@ are not d@@ are to tax even at a cr@@ un@@ ch .
“ the gas tax is simply not sustainable , ” says le@@ e mun@@ n@@ ich , an expert on transport legislation at the university of min@@ n@@ es@@ ot@@ a .
his federal state recently built 500 cars with tac@@ ho@@ graph@@ s , which would allow a mil@@ e-@@ based payment system to be tested .
“ this is the most sensible alternative in the long term , ” he said .
bureaucr@@ ats call it mil@@ e-@@ based user charges .
not surpris@@ ingly , the idea of urban liber@@ als is well received , because the tax could be used to promote the driving hab@@ its as if they were st@@ alled and climate dam@@ aging waste emissions .
the california pl@@ ann@@ ers are rel@@ ying on the system to develop strategies to address the ambitious , legislative and political challenges that the federal state has set for climate change .
but the republic@@ an bill shu@@ ster of pen@@ n@@ sy@@ l@@ v@@ ania , chairman of the house transportation committee , has been pus@@ hing for a more effective and effective policy .
free marke@@ ters of the reason foundation are also affected by the idea that drivers should be returned to the market after the distance travell@@ ed .
“ this is not a tax that is dis@@ appe@@ aring in a black hole , ” explains adri@@ an mo@@ ore , vice president of guidelines at reason .
people pay directly for what they get .
the movement is also supported by two former us transport ministers who have been calling for the 2011 congress to take part in the process of mil@@ e-@@ based dis@@ closure .
the us sen@@ ate approved a 90 million dollars expensive program last year , which would cost $ 10@@ ,000 cars .
but the majority in the house of representatives prevented the move and respon@@ ded to the concerns of members from rural areas who were trying to represent people who were in everyday life often lost many miles on the way to work or to the city .
several states and major cities are nevertheless moving in the right direction at their own pace .
the most committed is o@@ reg@@ on , which currently has 5@@ ,000 ri@@ ders for the country ’ s largest experim@@ ent .
these drivers will soon be able to pay mil@@ e@@ age fees instead of min@@ eral oil taxes to the state .
ne@@ v@@ ada has already completed a pilot project .
new york city is also considering one .
il@@ lin@@ o@@ is tests it in a limited way with tr@@ uc@@ ks .
and the i-@@ 95 coalition , to which the transport mini@@ stri@@ es of 17 states are associated on the east coast ( including mar@@ y@@ land , pen@@ n@@ sy@@ l@@ v@@ ania , vir@@ g@@ ini@@ a and fl@@ ori@@ da ) , is currently exam@@ ining how to see this change .
the concept is not a universal hit .
in ne@@ v@@ ada , where 50 volunte@@ ers recently equipped with the equipment , drivers were s@@ cep@@ tical about the idea of the government taking any of its movements .
“ concerns about big brother and such things were a big problem , ” explains al@@ aud@@ din kh@@ an , head of the strategy and result management at the united states transport ministry .
people did not want it .
when the test started , the ac@@ l@@ u war@@ ned of ne@@ v@@ ada on your site : “ it would be relatively easy to read the tac@@ ho@@ graph in full-@@ blo@@ wn surveillance equipment .
there is no need to create a gi@@ gan@@ tic , bul@@ ky technological infrastructure that is inevitably bound to lead to the creation of data on the daily movements of individuals .
ne@@ v@@ ada is part of a number of states that are now seeking affordable technology .
so , kh@@ an argu@@ ed , the public would be more reas@@ su@@ red .
the hun@@ t for this technology has led some authorities to become a small star@@ tup company called true mil@@ e@@ age in california .
the company was not originally registered to help states with the taxation of car drivers .
rather , it was their aim to create a new market for car insurance , which is now in a state of emergency , in which drivers are entitled to pay on the basis of the miles they have been driving .
but the tests it has tested are also very useful for road pl@@ ann@@ ers , because they do not work with g@@ ps and provide limited information that is regularly transmitted via mode@@ m .
“ people are more prepared to participate , if their speed and stability are not recorded , ” says the president of ry@@ an mor@@ ris@@ on , managing director of true mic@@ hel .
some of these public pilot programs have made major mistakes .
there are much cheaper and less in@@ tru@@ sive ways of doing this .
in o@@ reg@@ on , the plan@@ ters experim@@ ent with making car drivers perform a series of choices .
you can register for a device with or without g@@ ps .
or you do not choose any device at all and pay a lu@@ mp sum fee based on the average of the ha@@ z@@ ards of all the inhabitants of the state .
others hope to see the concept of a susp@@ icious public sell by using the devices with more functions .
in new york city , traffic officers want to develop a tax device that can also pay parking fees , provide insurance only for dangerous vehicles .
“ drivers would be made more aware of the benefits the system offers , ” says the president of the commission , “ mo@@ tori@@ sts would be encouraged to participate ” .
some transport plan@@ ters , however , are wonder@@ ing whether all the talk about paying per m@@ ile is not just a huge di@@ version .
the metro@@ politan transport co@@ . kg is a member of the san francis@@ co bay transport commission , which has declared that the congress can solve the problem of bank@@ rup@@ t@@ cy highway trust fund easily by increasing the number of fuel taxes .
an additional one-@@ off fee or annual fee could be a dis@@ incentive for drivers with hy@@ bri@@ d vehicles or other vehicles that use little petro@@ l .
“ there is no reason for an operation if an asp@@ ir@@ in is also sufficient , ” explains r@@ and@@ y r@@ ent@@ sch@@ ler , the head of legislation and public affairs of the commission .
if we do that , hundreds of millions of drivers are wor@@ ried about their privacy and many other things .

the sa@@ wing process is to be short .
the fire and the smo@@ ke development have led to two in@@ jur@@ ies , one of which could have an emergency call .
two resp@@ ir@@ atory tr@@ ays of the armed forces were in a state of emergency after the first review of the situation by h@@ ans kam@@ me@@ rer .
after a short time , the first person was found and moved to the out@@ doors .
the second person had to be borne .
this was not so easy , as a narrow sta@@ ir@@ case had to be overcome .
the building , a workshop with integrated st@@ all@@ ing for two horses , was not easy to secure .
it stored a lot of wood and also stra@@ w bal@@ es in it .
the first two were the electric machines for wood processing .
the first ext@@ inc@@ tion took place via the tan@@ k in the vehicle .
another line was given by a over@@ floor hy@@ d@@ ran@@ t in about 100 meters away .
now three ext@@ ingu@@ ish@@ ers could be designed .
the building also used a hol@@ low be@@ am pi@@ pe .
h@@ ans kam@@ me@@ rer was about the practice to show that what happened with little available space was not possible .
in case of emergency , support is provided through the kö@@ ni@@ gs@@ fel@@ d day@@ care group .
the comm@@ ander was shown to be in good hands with the procedure .

during his visit to the bre@@ is@@ ga@@ u high black forest district , the president of the country , gui@@ do wol@@ f , was also informed in ti@@ ti@@ se@@ e-@@ neu@@ stadt of where the work@@ force of tomorrow comes from .
the federal ministry of education and research ( b@@ mb@@ f ) has launched a new project to promote the federal ministry of education and research ( b@@ mb@@ f ) .

wol@@ f was impres@@ sed by the model projects for training .
since 2011 , there has been successful cooperation between the support centre , kre@@ is@@ gy@@ m@@ na@@ si@@ um and vocational school centre in the forest city .
he also p@@ raised the family-@@ friendly atmosphere in the district .
&quot; it is important not only to look at the family phase , but also to look at the family phase , due to demographic changes , to care for rela@@ tives , &quot; wol@@ f said .
he also stated that more and more employees are concerned about the care and care of their families .
&quot; without the support of employers , the resulting unemployment cannot be reduced .
but no one can afford to emplo@@ y skilled workers , he said .
another factor , particularly important , is the net@@ working of universities and businesses .
&quot; for those who have already experienced the benefits of the region during their studies , the hotel remains in the hands of their acquired knowledge and skills .
only if there is sufficient training place available can the professional person be able to cover the needs of the skilled .
in his opinion , the location advantage of the district is its advant@@ ageous location in the south-@@ west of germany , close to france and switzerland .
he also experienced a great deal of emo@@ tion during his train journey from ti@@ tis@@ e@@ e-@@ neu@@ stadt to fre@@ i@@ burg , in order to develop public transport .

the more than 100 years old natural stone wall as the front line of the old school cour@@ ty@@ ard to the kir@@ ch@@ stras@@ se is to be re@@ built with the re@@ hab@@ ilitation plan of the city of br@@ ä@@ un@@ ling@@ en .
in the days before the kil@@ big , the first san@@ itation work of the front school was completed with a small corner wall , to stab@@ ili@@ ze and sta@@ tic relief of the more than a hundred years old stone wall with bal@@ u@@ str@@ ade .
the way forward , alexander mil@@ o@@ k said , is to be elected by the br@@ ä@@ un@@ ling@@ er stad@@ t@@ ba@@ um@@ am@@ t , the land@@ es@@ land@@ mal@@ am@@ t , and to propose a re@@ hab@@ ilitation concept for the old wall .
after that , a cost calcul@@ ation is to be carried out by experts , who will then be sent to the municip@@ al council to decide and decide on the further course of action .
a decision on this is expected to be taken next year .
after renov@@ ation , pav@@ ement and plan@@ ting of the old school building , the building was re@@ built and the building was re@@ built in 19@@ 12 .
the historic , one-@@ hundred years old se@@ al of the old school court to kir@@ ch@@ stra@@ ß@@ e , is characterised by water and fro@@ st damage , as no dra@@ in@@ age is present , re@@ medi@@ al needs and has a bo@@ w .
deep cr@@ acks in individual stones bear witness to the damage caused by weather , but the wall is not at present at risk of collapse .
a firm wall is a pre@@ requisite for a school yard that students use , which is guaranteed by the current fix@@ ing works .
the school court renov@@ ation was originally already in use in 200@@ 8-@@ 2009 , but high un@@ planned expenditure was not a good idea .
an important word in the history of school building renov@@ ation , which has even been used for film sho@@ ts , is the land@@ es@@ land@@ mal@@ am@@ t .
if you have any suggestions from this site , the city of br@@ ä@@ un@@ ling@@ en hopes to receive grants from the conservation authorities .
the students of the br@@ ä@@ un@@ ling@@ er ele@@ mentary school , who have now returned to a well renovated old school building with new a@@ ula , can soon find the old school yard .
ö@@ z@@ dem@@ ir wants to train jazz in stutt@@ gart .
the ongoing discussions on the future of music universities in bad@@ en-@@ w@@ ür@@ t@@ tem@@ berg have now also focused on ce@@ m ö@@ z@@ dem@@ ir , federal chairman of the greens .
&quot; i think it is wrong to call ho@@ lis@@ tic education at the musi@@ k@@ ho@@ ch@@ sch@@ u@@ le stutt@@ gart , &quot; said ö@@ z@@ dem@@ ir the &quot; stutt@@ gart news &quot; .
jazz and classical music are part of the festival at the jazz location in stutt@@ gart .
this is contrary to what ö@@ z@@ dem@@ ir , who was the favorite of a direct mandate from the bun@@ de@@ sta@@ g in stutt@@ gart on 22 september , was the green red provin@@ cial government .
this will push forward , on the basis of an expert study , a re@@ organization of the five music col@@ leg@@ es in bad@@ en-@@ w@@ ür@@ t@@ tem@@ berg .
the study programme is to be conducted by jazz and pop from the musi@@ k@@ ho@@ ch@@ sch@@ u@@ le stutt@@ gart to the musi@@ k@@ ho@@ ch@@ sch@@ u@@ le man@@ n@@ heim .
us border : &quot; super tunnel &quot; to s@@ mu@@ gg@@ ling discovered drugs .
on the border between mexico and the us , investig@@ ators have found a &apos; super tunnel &apos; to s@@ mu@@ gg@@ le drugs and dec@@ om@@ mission them .
as the us customs authorities have said , the more than 500 meter long tube between ti@@ ju@@ ana and san di@@ e@@ go was equipped with electricity , rail@@ s and a be@@ v@@ ili@@ fication system .
three susp@@ ects have therefore been arrested , eight tonnes of mari@@ ju@@ ana and almost 150 kil@@ o@@ gram@@ s of co@@ ca@@ ine .
the tunnel was still not in use , according to the information .
&quot; these car@@ te@@ ls are st@@ up@@ id if they think they can be under the rad@@ ar &quot; , said the director@@ -@@ general of the us district , som@@ at@@ er@@ n c@@ ali@@ for@@ ni@@ a , lou@@ a du@@ ff@@ y .
the drug gan@@ gs are insu@@ red du@@ ff@@ y : &quot; if you continue to build such tun@@ nels and try to use them , we are determined to make that a huge waste of your dir@@ ty money .
both the us authorities and the mex@@ ic@@ an security forces are in a permanent struggle against drug car@@ te@@ ls .
since 2006 , more than 7@@ 7@@ ,000 people have been killed in mexico in connection with dru@@ g-@@ related crime .
the new system is designed by experts and designed by experts .
due to the elabor@@ ate equipment of the tunnel , the investig@@ ators assume that he is being trained by architec@@ ts and engineers .
the track system was equipped to allow electrical connections to the vehicle .
on the mex@@ ic@@ an side , there is access in a building that is 80 meters from the border .
according to the authorities , a lad@@ der leads into the deep 20 meters to the actual tunnel entrance .
the tunnel has a cross section of 1.@@ 20 meters height and 90 cen@@ time@@ ters width .
it would have been a suitable means of preventing illegal immigration towards the united states .
two of the susp@@ ects were arrested in connection with the co@@ ca@@ ine fund .
the third , a mex@@ ic@@ an , was arrested for se@@ ized mari@@ ju@@ ana , and the government is now in a state of emergency .
all three are threatened with life@@ -@@ long de@@ priv@@ ation of liber@@ ty , as officials have said .
since 2006 , eight such tun@@ nels have been discovered , they have been said at the press conference in san di@@ e@@ go .
but it is the first time that in such a tunnel building co@@ ca@@ ine has been found .
co@@ ca@@ ine is usually produced in smaller quantities and not through tun@@ nels .
this shows the &quot; desper@@ ation &quot; of drug gan@@ gs whose traditional routes have now been cut off , bil@@ l s@@ her@@ man said of the drug flag .
they would do everything to go to the us .
the de@@ tain@@ e@@ es have not been given any details , at least one is mex@@ ic@@ an , they have been told .
they must be pun@@ ished with prison sent@@ ences of up to ten years .
in 20@@ 14 , the ge@@ is@@ inger festival will be held in 20@@ 14 , the ge@@ is@@ inger festival of the year 20@@ 14 .
the anniversary of the city of ge@@ is@@ ingen on the occasion of the 12@@ 50 .
the first docum@@ entary mention of the town is getting closer .
if , in just over eight weeks , the end of the year is over , the anniversary year will be upon us .
go@@ d@@ d@@ ess and church houses were built for the first time in 7@@ 94 together .
in churches a certificate was produced , in which both places are mentioned .
on 15 march there will be an official start to the anniversary year , and since there are s@@ cour@@ ges currently no hall , this show takes place .
during the anniversary , several important events have been organized in the area of ge@@ is@@ ingen and kir@@ ch@@ en-@@ haus@@ en .
kir@@ ch@@ en-@@ haus@@ en will be hosting a festival weekend from july 18th to 20th , the 12@@ 50 .
celebr@@ ating the return of life
on friday with a cere@@ mony , on saturday and sunday with a party around the church hall .
on this weekend of the festival , the church house of the sa@@ ints is also open .
director of the city music of ru@@ dol@@ f bar@@ th has presented for the city a contract composition for the anniversary which will be published on three dates .
on 21 june , together with the sunday celebr@@ ation of the black forest association , on 12 july at the arena with fire@@ works and on 13 december as the first concert of urban music in the new festival hall .
this will be the final year of the anniversary and will be the official date of the last weekend of september , 27 and 27 .
on the occasion of the ge@@ is@@ inger city anniversary , a new chron@@ ic@@ le will be released .
&quot; but it should not only be a chron@@ ic@@ le of the spir@@ its themselves , but a printed work about the spiritual s@@ cour@@ ge of today , which is precisely due to s@@ ings , church houses , cop@@ per works , a@@ ul@@ ls , a@@ ul@@ ls , and a@@ ul@@ ls .
and the s@@ cour@@ ge of today also celebra@@ tes 20@@ 14 birth@@ day , 197@@ 4 was the present space with the comm@@ uni@@ tiz@@ ations .
the new chron@@ ic@@ le will be released on 21 or 22 november in the new fe@@ st@@ hal@@ le in ge@@ is@@ ingen .
in 20@@ 14 , however , there will be many anni@@ vers@@ aries .
the nar@@ ra@@ tive of stra@@ w gl@@ on@@ ki starts on february 8 with a night of wor@@ ship on the occasion of its 6@@ 0-@@ year existence , the harmony gu@@ t@@ mad@@ ingen will be 90 years and has opened the festival ban@@ quet and celebr@@ ation on march 29 and 4 .
al@@ ten@@ wer@@ k le@@ ip@@ fer@@ d@@ ingen is 40 years old , the ge@@ is@@ inger school has been in the new location for 50 years and celebra@@ tes this on 10 may , the musi@@ k@@ vere@@ in poly@@ hy@@ m@@ nia le@@ ip@@ fer@@ d@@ ingen is 150 years old and celebra@@ tes it .
the city of ge@@ is@@ ingen was founded in a gift certificate owned by the monaster@@ y of st. g@@ allen in the year 7@@ 64 .
the document was written in churches ( haus@@ en ) , which was then court place .
both communities are therefore in the same document .
the city of k@@ az@@ ak@@ h@@ stan is the largest city in the world , and is the largest city in the country .
the council is targe@@ ting rail systems , which are not only in the field of rail but also in the field of rail systems .
if the railway crossing is to be lab@@ ori@@ ously converted , the railway pass &quot; am h@@ ir@@ sch@@ en &quot; will be extended to increase road safety ?
yes , have the local counc@@ ils decided .
sch@@ il@@ t@@ ach must pay eur 2@@ 20 000 for this .
deutsche bahn wants to introduce the kin@@ zi@@ g@@ tal railway line next year .
the aim is to ensure the safety of railway cros@@ s@@ ings in particular - there are regular col@@ li@@ sions between trains and other vehicles across germany .
do the communities agree with the restructuring measures , they must comply with the costs of a third , the rest share the railways and the co@@ ven@@ ant .
sch@@ il@@ t@@ ach ’ s may@@ or ro@@ land gri@@ e@@ ß@@ hab@@ er explained to the municip@@ al council the special features of the ba@@ h@@ ü@@ ber@@ gan@@ g &quot; am h@@ ir@@ sch@@ en &quot; .
the city plans to build a new tunnel in the area , which is located west of the railway track .
larger vehicles could also be built there , such as long-@@ tim@@ ber vehicles , with counter@@ -@@ traffic without having to block the tracks .
greek cy@@ pri@@ ot suggested that a necessary wall of support be constructed in such a way that the city would not be able to open the road that followed in due course to ensure a smooth flow of traffic .
this was discussed in the municip@@ al council , because some counc@@ ils have not yet fully understood the need for road distribution : thomas ki@@ p@@ p expressed the s@@ enti@@ ment of cri@@ tics to the point : &apos; do we have to pay so much money in so few vehicles ?
may@@ or thomas ha@@ as dis@@ agreed : the railway crossing &quot; h@@ ir@@ sch@@ en &quot; is regularly used for long-@@ wood trans@@ ports .
even wood from the area &quot; ku@@ h@@ bach &quot; is partially trans@@ ported over this route because the up to 20 meters long vehicles will be the route along the h@@ ä@@ ber@@ les@@ br@@ ü@@ c@@ ke bridge because they are not going to take the main road .
in addition , the route served as a re@@ direction for those vehicles that do not use the tunnel when the main road is closed .
it should be fores@@ een that kir@@ ch@@ berg and sch@@ los@@ s@@ ber@@ g@@ tun@@ nel will be re@@ built and renovated , as is currently the case in wol@@ fac@@ h , so that the railway pass on &quot; am &quot; can be used for a longer period .
the counc@@ ils agreed to allow an investigation into the costs of the intended extension of the road , and the council agreed to do so .
nevertheless , the reconstruction of the railway transition has been approved by a majority with the requirement that the necessary support wall be built in such a way that the city can take the subsequent road towards &quot; ba@@ hn@@ ho@@ f@@ stras@@ se &quot; where appropriate for encoun@@ ters traffic .
the reconstruction of the railway crossing at ger@@ ber@@ i tr@@ aut@@ we@@ in could , however , pose a quite different problem , which would have prevented access to the rapidly rising &quot; ger@@ ol@@ tz houses &quot; .
the administration had announced the railway plans of the engineering office bre@@ in@@ ling@@ er , since they had doubts about the availability of the planned connection to the ger@@ ol@@ tz building by way , and would then be possible without further ado .
the investigation concluded that not enough was to be rul@@ ed out that the ti@@ ghten@@ ing conditions of the road could lead to longer vehicles being put on .
the responsibility for this , in turn , lies with the city as a road construction lo@@ ad@@ er .
the reconstruction could therefore be subject to liability disputes .
since the lo@@ gging and the ben@@ ding of the current extension are working , the system should be adapted to the reconstruction of the railway crossing .
it is also worth men@@ tioning the risk of a col@@ li@@ sion of the train with a passing vehicle significantly lower than the other rail passes , because the train itself is directly next to the center .
even trains from the main station would have to be stopped at this point to the point that no col@@ li@@ sion threat@@ ens .
the majority of the building was devoted to the transformation of this railway transition , as the city of sch@@ il@@ t@@ ach had to deal with the problem of rec@@ alling vehicles , according to the counc@@ ils , as the railway was closed .
the hotel is not proble@@ matic to consider the changes on the railway passes &quot; before heu@@ bach &quot; and &quot; before co@@ h@@ bach &quot; , for which kre@@ u@@ z@@ un@@ gs@@ ver@@ bin@@ d@@ ung has already been concluded with the railway .
es@@ a deci@@ des on major space missions : missions for bil@@ lions of dollars , bil@@ lions of dollars , dollars , dollars , dollars , and bil@@ lions of dollars , dollars , and dollars , and dollars , and dollars , and dollars .
remote plan@@ ets , gra@@ vity waves or black ho@@ les - experts from the european space agency have been asked to look at two major projects .
thir@@ ty proposals were on the table , five are still in the race .
remote worl@@ ds .
more than 1000 plan@@ ets in other stars have already found a@@ stronom@@ ers .
whether it is at least alive on some of them , nobody knows .
the choice is difficult : if you want to search for gra@@ vity waves ?
or rather the origin of the co@@ smo@@ s explore ?
or to earth like plan@@ ets , and thus perhaps ali@@ ens to discover life ?
these are the questions that the european space agency &apos;s leaders are asking themselves .
for your co@@ sm@@ ic vision program , look for ideas for two major space projects that will support research significantly .
the budget for such &quot; l-@@ missions &quot; is approximately one billion euros each .
the start is expected to be in 20@@ 28 and 20@@ 34 .
at the beginning of september , the elite of the european space research community met in paris to discuss proposals for such missions .
thir@@ ty ideas were discussed , five of them now being put to the close vote .
many bodies have assess@@ ed the proposals , ho@@ o@@ ks to researchers .
in the next few days , a final decision will be taken by the scientific programme committee .
there are four major questions that the es@@ a has chosen , which will be the focus of the missions of the co@@ sm@@ ic vision programme , which was launched in 2007 .
what are the conditions for the creation of plan@@ ets and lives ?
the exact procedure of the creation of stars from large gas cl@@ ou@@ ds - and thus also the emerg@@ ence of plan@@ ets that make these stars circle - is always in the sp@@ ell of the dark sky .
a large infra@@ red tel@@ es@@ cope in space could illu@@ min@@ ate this dark .
and if a star has a planet , under what circumstances can live there ?
to look into this issue , the space tel@@ es@@ cope will be named &quot; che@@ ops &quot; in 20@@ 17 , with which 500 already known plan@@ ets systems will be installed in our vicinity .
the possibilities are limited , however , che@@ ops is a small mission with a budget of eur 150 million .
with greater instruments , a@@ stronom@@ ers could dis@@ cer@@ n earth like plan@@ ets , and even analy@@ ze the composition of their atmo@@ sp@@ he@@ res , searching for &quot; bi@@ om@@ ar@@ kers &quot; : g@@ ases that are considered to be an indication of biological activity .
how does the solar system work ?
this issue , too , is ultimately to give an indication of the conditions that exist for the creation of life .
the mag@@ nit@@ ude of a star &apos;s magnetic activity and the interaction of its magnetic field , as well as the effect of partic@@ le radiation , are important factors .
in our solar system , these processes can be ex@@ em@@ pl@@ ary .
the solar or@@ bi@@ ter has been designed to provide the european union with a m class mission ( which is where the budget is about half a billion euros ) for this issue .
the pro@@ be is to start and surface and activity of the sun closely observe in 20@@ 17 .
of great interest to researchers are also j@@ up@@ i@@ ter and his moon .
you want to find out what role giant planet plays in the development of the solar system .
the es@@ a sees this as the first of the three l missions of the &quot; co@@ sm@@ ic vision &quot; programme .
the pro@@ be &quot; ju@@ ice &quot; ( j@@ up@@ i@@ ter ic@@ y mo@@ ons explorer ) starts its journey probably in 20@@ 22 .
eight years later , j@@ up@@ i@@ ter is supposed to re@@ discover the atmosphere of the planet and the ic@@ y mo@@ ons of europe , kal@@ lis@@ to and gan@@ y@@ med .
what are the basic physical laws of the universe ?
the space offers many possibilities to find material under extreme conditions .
there may also be some de@@ vi@@ ations that point the way to a new theory for physi@@ ci@@ sts , under whose roof all known natural laws can be united .
what was the universe of the universe and what is it ?
eur 13@@ .@@ 7 billion ago , our co@@ smo@@ s was born by the big ban@@ g .
in addition to the material we know from the stars , plan@@ ets and living beings as we are , there are dark matter .
so far , researchers have not yet known what physical laws were in the first fr@@ action of the hur@@ ric@@ ane .
with &quot; eu@@ c@@ li@@ d &quot; es@@ a has already launched an m-@@ mission here , whose launch is planned for 2020 .
with a special tel@@ es@@ cope , the pro@@ be is supposed to determine the distribution of matter in the universe for the first time , thus drawing conclusions about the nature of dark matter .
if you could run the race , you can get a chance to win .
of the 30 proposals , the commission only has two left at the end of the selection process .
the best chan@@ ces of obtaining an l-@@ mission are , according to many experts , &quot; e-@@ lis@@ a &quot; , a challenging concept for veri@@ fying gra@@ vit@@ ational waves .
physi@@ ci@@ sts understand changes in the structure of spa@@ tial time , which al@@ bert e@@ inste@@ in predic@@ ted almost 100 years ago .
they have not been proven to date .
el@@ is@@ a could do that , the scientists hope behind the project .
the mission envis@@ ages a two-@@ thir@@ ds prob@@ es detec@@ tor that will be installed in space .
it could be used as a gra@@ vity , unlike plants on earth .
four other proposals are still compe@@ ting for the second l-@@ mission : a large x-@@ ray tel@@ es@@ cope called &quot; ath@@ ena &quot; , which is used , among other things , to explore black ho@@ les , &quot; ic@@ y plan@@ ets &quot; , another .
already reti@@ red are proposals for pro@@ ving the re@@ ar transport from mar@@ s , for exploring the mon@@ d , ve@@ ins and am@@ or@@ tiz@@ ation .
snow@@ den ready to work with germany on us surveillance , and to do so in the us .
ed@@ ward snow@@ den , the wh@@ ist@@ le@@ b@@ lower of the us intelligence service , has said that he is ready to travel to berlin and to appear before the german bun@@ de@@ sta@@ g when the american national security agency is in power and its headquarters .
the german member , han@@ s-@@ christian str@@ ö@@ be@@ le , met snow@@ den in russia on thursday , where this asylum was granted , in order to make it possible to discuss the situation in germany with him .
in a letter from snow@@ den , which was sent on friday by str@@ ö@@ bel to the media in berlin , he wri@@ tes : “ even if the outcome of my efforts was demonstr@@ ably positive , my government is tre@@ ating a dis@@ sent as a continue view .
to tell the truth is not a crime .
in the letter , snow@@ den wri@@ tes that he is convinced that the support of the international community will convince the american government to stop the charges against him .
the security council , which is charged by the us department of justice , includes es@@ pi@@ on@@ age and the@@ ft of state property .
german interior minister han@@ s-@@ peter fried@@ rich said to ze@@ it online : “ if mr snow@@ den is prepared to meet german representatives , then we will find ways to do that . ”
relations between the us and germany are characterised by claims that the n@@ sa has not yet fully understood the mobile phone of chancell@@ or ang@@ ela mer@@ kel .
thomas op@@ per@@ mann , the member who has been appointed to the secre@@ tari@@ at of the parliamentary committee responsible , said that we should se@@ ize the opportunity to listen to snow@@ den as a witness , if possible , to ‘ risk without him and to jeopar@@ di@@ ze relations ’ .
str@@ ö@@ be@@ le , a member of the greens , published a picture of himself and snow@@ den in his t@@ wit@@ ter feed .
he was arrested by two german journalists when he visited russia .
str@@ ö@@ bel explained that according to the law@@ yer of the former n@@ sa employee snow@@ den did not return to russia , if he had visited the country .
if snow@@ den in germany testi@@ fies , then he needs an assurance that he will be “ safe ” there , as the honourable member said .
snow@@ den states in his letter that he is committed to “ serious and ongoing ” pursu@@ it campaign .
however , it is touched by the worldwide response to “ my act of political expression . ”
citizens all over the world , as well as senior politicians – including in the united states – have been deeply sho@@ c@@ ked by the rev@@ el@@ ations about an un@@ controlled system of comprehensive surveillance .
in his letter , snow@@ den makes a proposal to the german authorities of cooperation “ if the difficulties surrounding the humanitarian situation have been resolved ” .
fronti@@ er airlines charges a fee for hand bag@@ gage allow@@ ances , which is a charge for hand bag@@ gage allow@@ ances for bag@@ gage that is not included in the price of the bag@@ gage .
fronti@@ er airlines plans to supply up to usd 100 from passengers who have already paid for their flight .
fronti@@ er airlines intends to supply up to usd 100 for a piece of hand bag@@ gage and usd 2 for coffee or le@@ mon@@ ade , even if the announcement does not mention the same in the announcement on wednesday that passengers will be leaving the whole do@@ ck .
the new fee applies to hand bag@@ gage in the luggage com@@ part@@ ment above the seat , small bags under the seat are still free .
fronti@@ er explained that it is calculated to be 25 us dollars if the fee is paid in advance , and 100 u.s. dollars for travellers who arrive at the gate .
fron@@ t-@@ line speaker k@@ ate o &apos;@@ mal@@ ley said the fee of 100 u.s. dollars aims to make travellers pay more than they would expect .
“ we don ’ t want to calcul@@ ate this amount , ” she explained .
airlines began to pay for the first and second issued passenger bag@@ gage in 2008 , and the airline was able to do so .
passengers who tried to use them were forced to leave so much of the hand@@ bag as possible .
fees are one way of encouraging passengers to travel less on board .
o &apos;@@ mal@@ ley said that the new fee is not really about getting money .
it concerns the most loy@@ al customers of fronti@@ er , who have clearly stated that there are always more difficult to find room in the com@@ part@@ ment above the seat .
passengers who wish to purchase their tickets on the airline website do not have to pay .
this means that a passenger is not allowed to travel to the airport at the gate of fronti@@ er , which is the next person for a flight of 100 dollars for a similar item of bag@@ gage .
o &apos;@@ mal@@ ley explained the site of fronti@@ er and the check-in procedures would be changed so the passengers can be informed about the fee that is paid before they arrive at the gate .
the new fron@@ ti@@ er handling fee will not enter into force until the summer , and the exact date is not yet available .
passengers are often str@@ an@@ ded by bag@@ gage allow@@ ances and other charges , but airlines like to resort to this .
they argue that transport of luggage is money , and that passengers are not entitled to pay for this service if they so wish .
many on wall street view the new bag@@ gage charges as a sign that the airlines are taking enough money to pay for the aircraft after years of losses .
most , however , have so far been poin@@ ting the fing@@ er at charges for hand luggage .
spirit airlines inc@@ . requested a new a3@@ 20 family aircraft three years ago .
the only other airline with such a charge is the hungarian wi@@ z@@ z air , the air@@ lin@@ e-@@ consult@@ ant j@@ ay so@@ ren@@ sen , who has paid the extra charges atten@@ tively .
he estimated in a report of december 2011 that the handling charge spirit will cost eur 50 million per year .
so@@ ren@@ sen , who was previously a leading player at mid@@ west airlines , is now a leading airline in europe .
“ the boarding process was one of the smooth processes of the company that i have been able to follow in my career in aviation , ” he said .
i expected to be te@@ eth cr@@ acking and tangible discussions on the gate , but i am not sure if i am going to be able to see the next flight .
“ the plane was full , ” he explained , “ and boarding was as lu@@ br@@ ic@@ ated . ”
fronti@@ er also follows spirit at the 2 dollars spent on coffee , tea , le@@ mon@@ ade or ju@@ ice .
the company explained that passengers travelling to the lim@@ one or ju@@ ice could not travel the whole can .
water is still free .
we air@@ ways had briefly tried to provide refres@@ h@@ ment drinks in 2008 , but made this a matter of seven months later .
fron@@ ti@@ er &apos;s step to charge for hand bag@@ gage when passengers are not travelling directly to the airline is a step in the recent initiative to deal with customers at their own website .
airlines pay online travel agencies such as or@@ bit@@ z 10 to 25 us dollars per ticket sold .
this provides an incentive for all companies to encourage passengers to buy directly from them rather than via an online travel agency .
fronti@@ er is , however , the fur@@ th@@ est area in this area .
in september , the company began to make reservations through an online travel agency only half as many frequent fl@@ yer miles when booking .
on wednesday , the mil@@ e@@ age was reduced to 25 percent of the route .
a third party booking confirmation is required .
passengers can also only buy from the website of fronti@@ er places when buying directly .
fronti@@ er has a loy@@ al customer base at its headquarters in den@@ ver , but the business is shr@@ in@@ king and the company is losing money .
the proce@@ eds were reduced by 9 % and the flight capacity contrac@@ ted by just under 13 % in the first quarter , as stated in the financial report published on wednesday .
republic has tried to make a profit in the context of the sale of the company , and to get the finances of fronti@@ er under control .
pro@@ ver@@ bs come from the bi@@ ble
more than 40 women attended this year ’ s last women ’ s breakfast in the ev@@ angel@@ ical church of bis@@ ingen .
the theme of the day in the municip@@ al house were &quot; pro@@ ver@@ bs from the bi@@ ble &quot; and &quot; medieval phr@@ ases &quot; .
z@@ ita kö@@ h@@ ler , the chairman of the church council , went to the church council after breakfast in a lec@@ ture on the bi@@ b@@ lic@@ al pro@@ ver@@ bs .
&quot; pro@@ ver@@ bs contain life@@ styles , rules , or war@@ nings , &quot; she explained .
she compared several pro@@ ver@@ bs with the corresponding bi@@ b@@ lic@@ al places and explained the meaning .
she called pro@@ ver@@ bs like : catch a guard , keep a guard , as sc@@ ales fall from the eyes , an eye on someone who gives his own , the lord in sleep , his hands in un@@ fault .
the referen@@ da have repeatedly let their list@@ en@@ ers advise what kind of saying it is .
the words of the middle ages took the church community movement to the heart of the city , and the church was the first to be mentioned by the church .
it explained the meaning and origin of the words that they used to call &quot; brid@@ ges to the past &quot; .
in conclusion , a ra@@ ff@@ le was lost .
the prices were covered on a table and were hum@@ or@@ ously re@@ written before they were sold to the winners .
among the visitors of the breakfast round , there was also may@@ or roman w@@ ail@@ ey , who was the may@@ or of the city .
learning instead of being unemployed : pilot project for un@@ skilled tourism in the tourism industry .
the mec@@ k@@ len@@ burg lake district is home to the most famous and famous lake district in europe .
under the leadership of the federal employment agency , 49 women and men who have already been recognised as un@@ skilled in the industry are to be skilled workers for hotels and restaurants over three winter periods .
&quot; what is new is that the six@@ -@@ month courses with degrees end &quot; , said car@@ men wi@@ ech@@ ert of the employers &apos; agency .
the benefits are many : the participants would not be unemployed , the firms would be trained to work , the people would become more and more involved in hotels and restaurants , and the agency would not have to finance unemployment .
the project also includes industrial and commercial cham@@ bers in neu@@ brand@@ enburg and the german hotel and management board in berlin .
n@@ sa explains that an “ internal error ” and not h@@ ack@@ ers are guil@@ ty of the cr@@ ash of the site &apos;s website cr@@ ash and not h@@ ack@@ ers are guil@@ ty of the cr@@ ash of the site &apos;s website .
the shadow national security agency declared on 23 december last that a mistake occurred in public website some hours la@@ h@@ ti and not ha@@ z@@ ard as online claims .
“ n@@ sa@@ .@@ go@@ v was a few hours away from the hotel , because during a planned update an internal error occurred ” , explains mr. go@@ v .
the problem will be fixed this evening .
the claim that failure is caused by a distributed den@@ ial of service is not justified .
in the early hours of the evening , online server tr@@ ack@@ ers noticed that the n@@ sa website had at least six hours of un@@ available access and this was still not possible for some users .
previously , a n@@ sa speaker had been told to ab@@ c news that the eu ’ s sensitive internal network was “ in no way com@@ promised . ”
secret information is not in danger , the speaker said .
at least one group of h@@ ack@@ ti@@ sts claimed to have the n@@ sa website with a d@@ dos attack .
in the event of such attacks , the target site will be floo@@ ded with page views until the server is over@@ loaded and the website collap@@ ses .
cy@@ ber@@ tac@@ tics are relatively simple , and attacks are not designed to inter@@ f@@ ere with the target system &apos;s internal network .
the former super@@ -@@ secret n@@ sa , whose n@@ ick@@ name was once no such agency ( no such authority ) , is now in the bright light of the public and is looking for the information that has been made known in recent months .
the growing contro@@ vers@@ y over the secret service fu@@ el@@ ed initial spec@@ ulation about the possibility of the incident being the result of a targeted cy@@ per operation .
slightly falling is the number of people without jobs in october at 22 to 1,@@ 30@@ 7 .
although the 3.@@ 1 % quota was better than last year , and even better than in september , &apos; we would have liked to see more &apos; , mon@@ i@@ ka fel@@ der says .
many businesses have re@@ acted to at@@ titu@@ des .
one reason for this is , according to fel@@ der bau@@ er : &quot; we have few skilled workers in the craft sector , in health care and in care of the elderly &quot; .
the annual schedule of the year is also being extended to include vac@@ an@@ cies for hotel and restaurant personnel since september .
in mid-@@ december the winter season begins there .

loss of profits in bom@@ bar@@ di@@ er following decline in supply and orders , and the loss of jobs in the region , are a major factor in the global economy .
the can@@ a@@ dian aircraft and railway manufacturers bom@@ bar@@ di@@ er inc reported on the first 15@@ -@@ percent increase in the aircraft network on thursday .
bom@@ bar@@ di@@ er , based in mon@@ tre@@ al , did not publish flight test data for its brand new aircraft of the c@@ series , nor did it provide any new information on whether the aircraft was flying according to the ambitious schedule in september .
on the test aircraft ’ s ma@@ ide@@ n flight a month and a half ago , only three more flights have been launched , which makes it question@@ able whether the test phase is going as planned .
the results remained behind the forec@@ asts and led to a price drop of eur 2@@ 8.@@ 5 billion in the 2008 tor@@ onto stock market .
camer@@ on do@@ er@@ k@@ sen , analy@@ st at national bank financial , reduced sales by $ 1.@@ 9 billion on thursday .
“ while weak@@ er delivery numbers for aircraft have been largely expected , the us na@@ vy ’ s margin@@ al development has been clearly dis@@ appoin@@ ting , ” said do@@ er@@ k@@ sen in a customer letter .
we believe that bom@@ bar@@ di@@ er should be placing new orders for the c@@ series if the test program for the aircraft is moving forward .
however , if no new orders are announced in the coming months , we expect the market to follow the program with more s@@ cep@@ tic@@ ism .
bom@@ bar@@ di@@ er hopes that the air travel of the c@@ series will make the company into the lower market segment of kat@@ ap@@ ul@@ ti@@ en , which is currently being developed by bo@@ eing and airbus .
the first test aircraft was presented to the public in march and fle@@ w to the market for the first time in september after months of delays .
but , until now , binding orders for the c@@ series have been moderate with 17@@ 7 , as potential bu@@ yers can wait for the results of the flight tests and see if the company ’ s claims regarding fuel efficiency and cost saving potential of the new jet are correct .
there are currently 4@@ 03 orders and commitments from 15 customers and companies .
ceo pi@@ er@@ re beau@@ do@@ in is confident that the bom@@ bar@@ d@@ di@@ er will achieve his goal of 300 binding orders at the beginning of commercial use of the jet .
the company management confirmed to analy@@ sts and media on thursday that the programme was in the schedule .
“ the test aircraft is no longer on the ground than expected , ” said beau@@ do@@ in at a phone conference and added , while the service life of the aircraft was ground tests and software updates .
each manufacturer is planning a different way .
we have decided to take a first flight and then to start a review period , which we have also done .
this is done throughout the flight programme .
the second of five test aircraft is expected to be launched in the next few weeks , the rest shortly afterwards , it was said from the corporate side .
yet analy@@ sts remain s@@ cep@@ tical about whether 12 months after the ma@@ ide@@ n flight , the first customer will launch a c@@ series aircraft .
bom@@ bar@@ di@@ er said it is checking the planning for the commission@@ ing ( ice ) and will publish it in the coming months .
“ slow progress in air test – even if it is obviously bom@@ bar@@ di@@ er ’ s internal planning – rein@@ forces our view that the world ’ s launch should be limited to the first quarter of 20@@ 15 , ” said do@@ er@@ k@@ er@@ ker@@ t .
in the third quarter , at the end of september 30 , bom@@ bar@@ di@@ er ’ s net profit fell to $ 14@@ 7 million , or $ 8 c@@ ents per share , respectively , from $ 17@@ 2 million , or 9 c@@ ents per share a year earlier .
the adjusted profit per share is un@@ changed at 9 c@@ ents .
sales were slightly lower and fell by 3.@@ 5 % to € 4.@@ 3 billion ( year-@@ end 2005 : $ 4.@@ 1 billion ) .
analy@@ sts had a profit of 10 c@@ ents per share and a tur@@ nover of 4.@@ 56 billion dollars , according to th@@ om@@ son re@@ u@@ ters i / b / e / s .
the world ’ s fourth largest aircraft manufacturer claims that it has delivered 45 aircraft this quarter , a decline of 5.@@ 7 % last year .
net orders fell from 8@@ 3 aircraft to 2@@ 6.@@ 9 .
the order book in the aero@@ space division stood at € 3@@ 9.@@ 9 billion on 30 september and was thus slightly lower than december 31 .
“ in the aero@@ space sector , the results were achieved within our guidelines , but the low in@@ take of orders and overall market conditions were dis@@ appoin@@ ting , ” said beau@@ do@@ in .
sales in the aero@@ space sector were up by € 13 percent to € 2 billion .
bom@@ bar@@ di@@ er , the world ’ s largest railway manufacturer , announced that sales in this sector were down by nearly 11 percent to $ 2.@@ 1 billion .
the order book in the transport division stood at € 3@@ 2.@@ 6 billion on 30 september , and thus slightly increased compared to december 31 .
the profit mar@@ gin in the transport sector has been reduced by processing problems in some major contracts .
according to the management , it will be possible to set new targets for the fourth quarter .
in the afternoon trading on thursday the bom@@ bar@@ di@@ er share increased by 8.@@ 5 percent and was 4.@@ 5 percent .
the braz@@ ili@@ an em@@ bra@@ er sa , the world ’ s third largest commercial aircraft manufacturer and bom@@ bar@@ di@@ er of the clo@@ s@@ est ri@@ val , reported a ten@@ -@@ percent decline in q@@ 4 sales on thursday .
usa : sho@@ ts at los angel@@ es airport

co@@ ca@@ ine ad@@ dic@@ t , the drug bo@@ ss in front of police investigation war@@ ned , must be imprison@@ ed .
bas@@ har@@ at d@@ it@@ ta , 42 , gave information on sub@@ world size ne@@ il scar@@ bor@@ ough .
the law@@ yer was afraid to use his secret drug ad@@ diction .
he was arrested by the cro@@ wn court of li@@ ver@@ pool to three years in prison .
a well-known criminal def@@ en@@ der who has a drug bar@@ on in front of a major police investigation because he was afraid to use his secret drug ad@@ diction could be discovered , has been sent@@ enced to three years in prison .
bas@@ har@@ at d@@ it@@ ta , 42 , supplied sub@@ world size ne@@ il scar@@ bor@@ ough with sensitive information about er@@ as@@ m@@ us to investigate its activities in drug trafficking after being replaced by its own co@@ ca@@ ine ad@@ diction .
the war that crimin@@ alists call “ first-@@ class . ”
officials observed how sc@@ ar@@ bor@@ ou@@ gh ( 32 ) had three bags of co@@ ca@@ ine on the house of the law@@ yer in black@@ bur@@ n , lan@@ cas@@ hire , ab@@ sen@@ tee , while this was with colleagues at a dinner the evening .
the investigation revealed that the di@@ t &apos;@@ pol regularly uses drugs of class a , which had been tested to detec@@ t trac@@ es of co@@ ca@@ ine in his hair , on his wal@@ let and on credit cards .
over a period of eight months between january and august 2011 , he tried to ga@@ ther un@@ authorized information about the arrest of two men on behalf of scar@@ bor@@ ough and one of his partners .
all four susp@@ ects were then arrested by the police in a major investigation into the her@@ o@@ in and co@@ ca col@@ a trade in lan@@ cas@@ hire , c@@ um@@ bri@@ a , mer@@ se@@ y@@ side , ber@@ k@@ sh@@ ire and west yor@@ k@@ sh@@ ire .
together with 32 other people , they were later arrested after the police had been arrested in a number of house sear@@ ches her@@ o@@ in and co@@ ca@@ ine worth £ 1.5 million and p@@ ounds 200@@ ,000 of cash .
d@@ it@@ ta , 42 , gave information to the crimin@@ als because he fe@@ ared that his drug ad@@ diction could be public@@ ized .
today d@@ it@@ ta , who is responsible for for@@ bes sol@@ ic@@ itors ’ law firm in black@@ bur@@ n , was born at li@@ ver@@ pool cro@@ wn court after a three-@@ week period of work in two charges .
he said at an earlier survey that the co@@ ca@@ ine ownership was in place .
the law@@ yer was transferred after the police had been arrested in their investigations against scar@@ bor@@ ough .
two investig@@ ators followed the prosecu@@ tion and the sadd@@ am hus@@ sein &apos;s execution .
shortly after he had delivered the drugs , sc@@ ar@@ bor@@ ou@@ gh regularly tele@@ ph@@ oned with d@@ it@@ ta , who was in the football sta@@ dium at black@@ bur@@ n ro@@ vers at e@@ wo@@ od park for dinner .
the law@@ yer returned home , pic@@ king up the drugs and then being released nine communications between the two trained and trained .
the court of justice has been informed that d@@ it@@ ta is a “ regular consumer ” of co@@ ca@@ ine after tests of the class a drugs have been found in his hair , his wal@@ let and on his credit cards .
d@@ it@@ ta was later arrested , but denied , co@@ ca@@ ine was taken and said he had been working with the alleg@@ ed de@@ al@@ er , because he had lost his client .
during his arrest , d@@ it@@ ta took his wal@@ let and tried to make a number of credit cards removed , but they were secured and he was given a hair sample .
in the case of police inter@@ ro@@ gation , he stated that he was operating under his private address as well as at the work@@ place , and that clients would be leaving him at home for legal matters .
the court of justice has been informed that it has been able to identify important actors in the drug trade , some of which he had represented previously , following significant ar@@ re@@ sts and informed what the investig@@ ators knew about them .
prosecu@@ tor anne wh@@ y@@ te said : “ a criminal prosecu@@ tor should be better than any other , that he is not allowed to break the law . ”
d@@ it@@ ta will not be held liable for abuse of his position as a criminal def@@ en@@ der , because he is too much involved with certain clients .
the relationship in question is not simply that of a drug deal@@ er , but of a drug deal@@ er who has his ad@@ voca@@ tes supplied with drugs .
some of his communications were undoubtedly legitimate , because he was the advoc@@ ate of these people .
but that went far beyond the b@@ ounds of a normal relationship between law@@ yer and client .
he was the chief prosecu@@ tor of the police , so that they could continue to investigate their criminal activities .
mr d@@ it@@ ta brought his profes@@ sion into dis@@ repu@@ te .
he was available to certain clients , particularly scar@@ bor@@ ough , and he left it to be his own independence com@@ promised .
d@@ it@@ ta dis@@ missed any mis@@ conduct and claimed that “ if i am a corru@@ pt law@@ yer , what i do not , and information to sc@@ ar@@ bor@@ ough would be passed on , i would be unable to spend 15 hours waiting , ”
but , after the hearing , super@@ int@@ end@@ ent le@@ e hal@@ ste@@ ad said from the police in lan@@ cas@@ hire : “ mr d@@ it@@ ta took the step from a criminal def@@ en@@ der to a criminal at the moment he started to attack .
its co@@ ca@@ ine dependence led to a ho@@ p@@ eless com@@ promises and made it vulnerable to the mo@@ tives of leading members of organised crime , who appointed him to provide valuable information on police investigation .
lawyers must have the highest standards of integrity and be able to stand up for trust and confidence in the public .
d@@ it@@ ta has lost that trust and has tried to hide behind the fac@@ ade of his profes@@ sion .
the serious and organized crime unit of lan@@ cas@@ hi@@ re le@@ an@@ ed the investigation into the dis@@ ability of d@@ it@@ ta , which also led to a convic@@ tion in three cases on account of the pos@@ session of co@@ ca@@ ine and the dis@@ ability of justice .
this case should give a warning to crimin@@ als and show that no one is in the arm of the law .
we find them and bring them to justice .
scar@@ bor@@ ough himself was sent@@ enced to 14 years in prison after he had been accused of con@@ spir@@ ing to the her@@ o@@ in , co@@ ca@@ ine and can@@ n@@ ab@@ is trade .
thir@@ ty-@@ five more people involved in drug trafficking were sent@@ enced to total penalties of 15@@ 3 years for drug off@@ ences .
on his website d@@ it@@ ta published a section with questions and answers about himself in which he said his dream job was to be to be considered a law@@ yer .
revolutionary work of the church music
at the end of the celebra@@ tions on the occasion of its 16@@ 0-@@ year existence , the song cr@@ ane dun@@ n@@ ingen will perform two services with the &quot; deutsche mes@@ se &quot; by fran@@ z sch@@ u@@ bert .
after the great success of the musi@@ c@@ als &quot; rock my life &quot; , which the spec@@ t@@ ators will be delighted to hear this spring , the song cr@@ ane will be ready for the anniversary year .
on saturday , 26 october , this extraordinary exhibition will be held from 19 during the evening fair in the st. mar@@ tin@@ sk@@ ir@@ che dun@@ n@@ ingen and on sunday 27 october , from 10 : 15 am at the got@@ te@@ s@@ di@@ en@@ st in .
the so-called deutsche mes@@ se , with its original title &quot; sing@@ ing for the celebr@@ ation of the holy sacrif@@ ice of the fair &quot; , d 8@@ 72 , is a spiritual music work of the compos@@ er fran@@ z sch@@ u@@ bert , who was born in 18@@ 26 .
the fair will take place within the framework of the services , as the client jo@@ han@@ n phili@@ p@@ p neu@@ mann had in mind .
under the direction of her@@ mann sch@@ nei@@ der , the cho@@ ir is led by the br@@ ass group of the music association fre@@ h@@ sin@@ n ten@@ n@@ en@@ br@@ on@@ n and no@@ em@@ i lo@@ ko@@ di at the or@@ gan .
has@@ l@@ ach : ske@@ p@@ tic@@ ism is increasingly di@@ m in confidence .
the elections to the par@@ ish council in 20@@ 15 will , for example , have a positive effect on the situation in the has@@ l@@ ach ( se ) se@@ af@@ aring unit .
there is only one common par@@ ish church council for all six par@@ ish groups .
in a joint meeting , on saturday the committees of has@@ l@@ ach , ho@@ f@@ ste@@ t@@ ten , m@@ ü@@ h@@ len@@ bach , fis@@ cher@@ bach , ste@@ in@@ ach and wel@@ sch@@ en@@ ste@@ in@@ ach prepared for the changes .
the fundamental decisions of the di@@ oc@@ ese are not in doubt .
during the day it became particularly clear : ske@@ p@@ tic@@ ism about the new is slowly but ten@@ ta@@ tively becoming a confident one .
from the ideas and expectations of the innovations in 20@@ 15 to concrete proposals on the future composition and size of the par@@ ish church council , the commission &apos;s extremely constructive discussions were enough .
geor@@ g sch@@ mit@@ t regional de@@ an explained the current state of the art and the new rules for se@@ af@@ aring units in the arch@@ di@@ oc@@ ese of fre@@ i@@ burg .
after that , the se has@@ l@@ ach as a church community will form a public law body that will be fully integrated into the rights and obligations of the six individual church communities to date .
there will only be a common par@@ ish council and a foundation council .
from each par@@ ish , at least two elected members should be represented , in the six par@@ ish churches , so called comm@@ on@@ wealth teams are formed .
your task in future will be to protect church life in the village .
when it comes to the finances of the individual par@@ ish , there was a great need for discussion .
the innovations provide that collected data can be used in the p@@ par@@ ish real@@ ms .
li@@ abilities , on the other hand , go to the entire municip@@ ality .
in view of the large planned investments , which all p@@ far@@ r@@ ies will then be obliged to make , there were major concerns .
&quot; in the past , only investment was made in projects that were approved by the individual par@@ ishes alone .
practical experience with a joint body for five par@@ ish cere@@ mon@@ ies described bar@@ bar@@ ar rit@@ ter , the chairman of the committee in the se@@ af@@ aring unit of the sch@@ ut@@ ter@@ wal@@ d ne@@ ur@@ ged .
they had committed themselves to becoming one in 2006 , five remaining in 2006 , and found that it was not that easy .
the has@@ l@@ ach@@ er se@@ af@@ are@@ rs ’ council bodies then sought to answer questions about the future composition and size of the common par@@ ish council and the practical work of the community teams .
the preparation will be more concrete in further meetings and will be discussed in another joint meeting of all six bodies next spring .
in the end , par@@ ish council michael sch@@ ö@@ ner of ste@@ in@@ ach presented the new logo of the se@@ aside unit , which was approved by a clear majority .
in p@@ ful@@ l@@ endor@@ f the electricity is more expensive than the electricity produced in the city .
the citizens of p@@ ful@@ l@@ endor@@ f must be prepared for higher electricity costs .
as the managing director of the stad@@ tw@@ er@@ ke , j@@ ör@@ g-@@ ar@@ ne bi@@ as , confirmed to the south kur@@ i@@ er , a four-@@ head@@ ed p@@ oul@@ end@@ or@@ fer family of 70 to 90 euros add extra costs per year .
the main reason for the price increase that is due is the rise in the so-called ec lev@@ y of 5.@@ 27@@ 7 to 6.@@ 3 c@@ ents per kil@@ ow@@ att@@ -@@ hour .
this lev@@ y is paid every october by the four operators of the major power tracks .
these figures , which are available to you from the turn of energy , are the additional costs that you will have to pay via a lev@@ y on electricity prices .
the city ’ s p@@ fl@@ ul@@ l@@ endor@@ f ( city works ) are the last link in this chain .
the supervisory board of the energy company was even convinced in its forec@@ asts of a higher lev@@ y , as j@@ ör@@ g-@@ ar@@ ne bi@@ as reports .
now the actual figures should be calculated before the city centres are able to inform their customers next week about the exact price increase .
&quot; we are starting from an increase of 1 cent plus x , &quot; says bi@@ as , with the number more near the 2 c@@ ents .
traffic lights on fore@@ ver red : look for waiting time .
sometimes a traffic light is simply not green .
the contact loo@@ p in the street does not react , or the light sign is broken .
what should be done then - drive on red ?
if a person has been affected long enough at a red light and the inter@@ section is free , he can continue , the st@@ ut@@ gar@@ ter re@@ ch@@ t@@ san@@ wal@@ t r@@ al@@ f bec@@ ker explains in the magazine &quot; motor@@ ra@@ d &quot; .
the waiting time must be &apos; reasonable &apos; , which is to be different from one case to another .
bec@@ ker advis@@ es that at least five minutes before a function inter@@ ference of the traffic lights is expected .
if you want to continue the journey despite red light , you must be aware that the journey is not suitable for a loss of life caused by it .
if you have not toler@@ ated less than five minutes , you may not wait long enough , bec@@ ker war@@ ns and refers to a decision by the ham@@ m supreme court .
the case under discussion was followed by a driver who had to leave the traffic lights for about three minutes and had to decide to take a care@@ less off@@ ence in red light .
the traffic lights were not broken , but jum@@ ped little later on on green to get around .
a driving ban was not imposed on him because of the special situation - but the fine is not .
the municip@@ al council is pleased to have a solid budget and a strong budget .
whenever there is a problem in town counc@@ ils with the budget , may@@ or r@@ alp@@ h ger@@ ster lau@@ gh@@ s well .
the par@@ ish bag in her@@ d@@ w@@ ang@@ en-@@ sch@@ ö@@ n@@ ach is well filled and debt management has not been familiar with since 2005 .
the 2012 budget year can also be seen as a complete success in this respect .
this was confirmed when the annual accounts for 2012 were presented .
as andre@@ a ro@@ th@@ mun@@ d explained , the administrative budget is around 7.@@ 6 million euros over a million euros .
the sur@@ plus of the administrative budget is also around 1.@@ 8 million euros , which is around eur 1 million above the approach .
it is thanks to the sur@@ plus , above all , of higher business tax revenue and the municip@@ al share of income tax .
the budget was also significantly above the planned values .
instead of the eur 1.5 million envis@@ aged , last year it was eur 2.5 million .
&quot; this is mainly due to the higher in@@ take from the administrative budget &quot; , says ro@@ th@@ mun@@ d .
since the 2012 budget year will have less investment than planned , it is also necessary to increase the return on the goods .
overall , the overall reserve was reduced by around eur 2.@@ 1 million to a total of eur 4.@@ 9 million .
may@@ or r@@ alp@@ h ger@@ ster than@@ ked ro@@ th@@ mun@@ d and her team for the good work they have done .
&quot; such a work is not sha@@ king out of the sle@@ eve , &quot; ger@@ ster p@@ raised ger@@ ster with regard to the annual accounts .
he and the municip@@ al counc@@ ils were vi@@ sibly delighted with the good figures .
it may sound par@@ ado@@ x@@ ical , but it is precisely these good figures that could soon cost the citizens dear .
the good financial situation has enabled the community to react to high le@@ verage in the past .
but this , in turn , has often meant that subsidies have been cut off from the country , according to ger@@ ster .
the commission has proposed a eur 1.@@ 7 billion budget for these subsidies from various off@@ sets .
cities and municip@@ alities that are eligible for subsidies must , among other things , be able to offer certain le@@ vers .
&quot; the subject of re@@ be@@ ls we have to look at , because investment is due in the coming years , for which we would like to have subsidies , &quot; ger@@ ster announced in this context .

besides the hon@@ or , the 3@@ 1st autumn festival took place in usual tracks : with the m@@ g@@ v be@@ tra , the song cr@@ ane salz@@ ste@@ t@@ ten , the sing@@ er department ba@@ is@@ ingen and the local jazz club .
the m@@ g@@ v full-@@ mar@@ in@@ age opened its doors with atmo@@ sp@@ her@@ ic songs such as &quot; im we@@ in@@ par@@ a@@ dies &quot; and &quot; fun@@ ny , her bro@@ thers &quot; .

the song cr@@ ane salz@@ ste@@ t@@ ten with its mixed cho@@ ir and its female group - the &quot; imp@@ ul@@ se &quot; - provided the voice for the festival ’ s female quota .
the mixed cho@@ ir kid@@ n@@ app@@ ed the ne@@ apo@@ lit@@ an fol@@ k &quot; santa lu@@ cia &quot; and &quot; evi@@ va esp@@ ana &quot; from an@@ tos gu@@ s in foreign languages .

be creative with your children and surprise the young jury of the action kin@@ der@@ gar@@ ten building site .
a jury composed of representatives of black forest offered to design a building and a savings bank z@@ ol@@ ler@@ al@@ b , choo@@ ses from all sub@@ missions three wishes .
what are the requirements for participation ?
the wish should be fulfilled with building material worth a maximum of 2000 euros and at a ( action ) day .
moreover , the winner must be for many har@@ d-@@ working people .
what has happened to the day of action and the aid workers ?
bau@@ haus , with the support of the savings bank z@@ ol@@ ler@@ al@@ b , makes the material available .
it will be available in the kin@@ der@@ gar@@ ten on the agreed day and will then be processed directly by the help@@ ers .

ken@@ y@@ an press ou@@ tr@@ aged controversial media law .
“ we are in a fri@@ ghten@@ ing situation and we must ask ourselves : what does parliament think about the need to simply take the judicial independence tomorrow ?
“ the law is dr@@ ac@@ on@@ ian and very pen@@ al and we refuse to do so , ” said cy@@ r@@ us kam@@ au , managing director of the capital group , to which capital is also a member , one of the most respected radio stations .
he said that the new media tri@@ bun@@ al “ will always be pre@@ ju@@ dic@@ ed , because it is an extended arm of the government ” , and restrictions on content and advertising would force ken@@ ya ’ s position in the global economy .
“ i hope the president list@@ ens to us and we appeal to him to reject this draft law and to send it back to parliament , ” he said .
according to the newspaper the star , the government is taking a more effective approach to the issue through the new law , “ the media effectively ent@@ ers into a str@@ ang@@ le@@ hold . ”
the adoption of the law is part of a series of measures designed to improve national security in the wake of the armed conflict attacks .
the ken@@ y@@ an media attrac@@ ted the authorities ’ an@@ ger because they were taking pictures of security cameras , where there was a need to see the people involved in the crime scene .
police chief david k@@ im@@ ai@@ y@@ o respon@@ ded with the order of two journalists and one of the leading media representatives .
under the new law , media houses may be granted a fine of up to 20 million ken@@ y@@ an sh@@ ill@@ ings and individual journalists may be sent@@ enced to up to one million and the further risk of losing their professional recognition or being ac@@ credited by an official press .
the tri@@ bun@@ al also has the right to refuse to conf@@ is@@ c@@ ate the pos@@ session of the persons concerned if a penalty is not paid .
according to daily nation , “ only one pun@@ ishment can trans@@ mit most radio stations to bank@@ rup@@ t@@ cy . ”
moreover , the newspaper considers that these measures could have a dev@@ ast@@ ating effect on the “ living conditions of blo@@ go@@ sphere ” of ken@@ ya .
if you want to silence the media , politicians could be inc@@ ri@@ min@@ ated , whatever they want .
“ no one will ever know , ” mu@@ t@@ um@@ a ma@@ thi@@ u wrote , journ@@ alist at the nation , who had visited the ken@@ y@@ an media as a crucial factor in public life control .
“ leaving politicians to their own devices , they lead the country into bank@@ rup@@ t@@ cy and return us to the time of hun@@ ters and collec@@ tors , ” he comm@@ ented .
ken@@ y@@ an legisl@@ ators have been the public era in the past .
in may , they voted to remove the national re@@ mun@@ er@@ ation commission ’ s cuts .

the city and the football club of the city have been under@@ min@@ ed by the official opening cere@@ mony for the artificial tur@@ f sport , despite the cold weather and the rain .
a more pleasant party was on the last saturday all the people would have liked , but peter did not want to play with him .
so all those who had been looking for it without um@@ bre@@ lla or for some reason had not kept it .
this was a great help to the musicians who fr@@ amed the fe@@ ast , as well as to many speakers .
we@@ t was therefore also the f@@ c chairman al@@ bre@@ cht sch@@ len@@ ker , who was talking about ful@@ filling a dream .
his thanks were primarily due to may@@ or wal@@ ter k@@ lu@@ p@@ p , who has worked for the implementation of the project , the municip@@ al council , the participating companies and associations .

may@@ or k@@ lu@@ mp@@ p remin@@ ded us that rec@@ ur@@ ring weather conditions are affecting the spring of and autumn .
15 years ago , the first consideration was given to solving the problem when a third place was being built at the football club or at the real school at sal@@ in@@ en@@ see .
both have been dis@@ missed again .
six years ago , thoughts came up about the creation of an artificial gr@@ ass sport site , which is generally considered the ultimate solution .
concrete plans were launched two years ago , when the f@@ c had closed the ch@@ ab@@ el@@ stu@@ be in in@@ herit@@ ance le@@ ase , a cost contribution of eur 100 000 for the construction of the place and the country received funding of eur 10@@ 4 000 .
the municip@@ al council decided to adopt the new municip@@ al council in october 2012 , which will provide the remaining eur 3@@ 56 000 in total costs of eur 5@@ 60 000 , summar@@ ised k@@ lu@@ mp@@ p .
the construction of the 68 m@@ ts 10@@ 8 m artificial gr@@ ass course started on 4 june .

among other things , this should be about dual citizenship , which is a subject on which both sides have conflic@@ ting ideas .

vienna airport provides passenger calls from the airport to the airport .
mr max ma@@ i@@ er , please come to gate 24 .
predic@@ tions like this will be made at vienna sch@@ w@@ ec@@ hat airport in the future .
most of the lou@@ d@@ speakers are not connected - the noise level is to be reduced so that the noise level is reduced .
a more relaxing atmosphere is the goal of this innovation .
as airport speaker peter kle@@ em@@ ann said to radio vienna , the first international airport in vienna is the vienna airport , which has set up its own break@@ through@@ s concerning individuals .
for example , airports in copenhagen , frankfurt or du@@ ba@@ i already do not have the noise of calls .
the elimin@@ ation of these break@@ through@@ s - on average , one day , around 200 personal calls from the speakers will cause the volume to rise qui@@ e@@ ter in the future at the airport .
&quot; it has also been shown in experience that these individual break@@ through@@ s are relatively un@@ noticed , but at the same time all other information on changed flight or departure times here is a bit un@@ done &quot; , says kle@@ em@@ ann in the book .
high@@ lan@@ der games on the kal@@ ten@@ hof
besides the bra@@ ke car dra@@ g with trac@@ tors , there are also a few other events at the annual autumn festival on the kal@@ ten@@ hof from 6 to 8 september .

four and a half metres long , the tr@@ un@@ k is th@@ ick and 25 to 30 kil@@ o@@ gram@@ s heavy .
&quot; it does not matter the expan@@ se , &quot; says organiz@@ er peter sa@@ ile .
the tri@@ be must be thro@@ wn ver@@ tically , if it is to over@@ throw itself and then just come to lie .
this is being assess@@ ed with most points .
when thro@@ wing hor@@ s@@ es@@ ho@@ es , the goal is to be precise .
the village is situated 8 metres from the hotel .
sk@@ ill and strength must be the participants in we@@ aring water bu@@ c@@ kets over 50 meters .
time and water in a bot@@ tle are measured at the end .

but sw@@ ab@@ ian co@@ stu@@ me is also allowed .
for the out@@ fit , the j@@ ür@@ gen jury will award a few bonus points .
you can register for free until one hour before the start of the race .
the scot@@ tish sw@@ ab@@ ian high@@ lan@@ der games and the tr@@ ak@@ tor game are a great way to get the most out of the game .

ve@@ gan nutri@@ tion requires alternative vege@@ table e@@ gg@@ s , milk and d@@ airy products .
the room was very clean and the bathroom was very nice .
the other is the vege@@ t@@ arian heritage of world vege@@ tation day on 1 november .
the vege@@ t@@ arian heritage germany proposes , on the occasion of world ve@@ g@@ ans on 1 november , a number of ve@@ gan alternatives :
pure plant mar@@ gar@@ ine is a good alternative to but@@ ter , yo@@ gh@@ ur@@ t leave by so@@ ja@@ yo@@ gh@@ ur@@ t .

sle@@ e@@ pl@@ ess in new york
on the way to their host families in we@@ y@@ mouth , mass@@ ach@@ us@@ et@@ ts , the students of the black forest gy@@ m@@ n@@ astic learned the american metro@@ polis new york .
after eight hours of flight , we went straight to bro@@ ok@@ ly@@ n bridge , which was the heart of the city , man@@ h@@ att@@ an , on foot .
this was a fascinating moment to see the world famous sk@@ y@@ line , which was built in the evening light and which is a great attr@@ action .
the time shift has left students almost 24 hours on their leg@@ s , but fa@@ i@@ th@@ fully following the mo@@ tto &quot; the city sle@@ eps not &quot; , the day was decided at times square .
despite shut@@ down , the second day the stat@@ ue of liber@@ ty was closed with a fer@@ ry and it was possible to walk .
then , it went on to cross the financial center around wall street to comm@@ em@@ or@@ ate 11 september .
on the third day , students were able to benefit from the 3@@ 73 meter high viewing platform of the empire state building .
then it went through the hec@@ tic pace of new york ’ s streets , through the ro@@ c@@ ke@@ f@@ ell@@ er center to central park , which was an ideal opportunity to stay short in the autumn sun .
after a short flight from new york to bo@@ ston , students have now returned to their host families and experience the we@@ y@@ mouth high school in the school .
this year , the german association of the international community of the sa@@ ints , hu@@ ber@@ tus , will again be present at the st. mari@@ en par@@ ish church on the h@@ ul@@ s@@ ber@@ g@@ stra@@ ß@@ e .
st. hu@@ ber@@ tus was the leg@@ end after a rather ru@@ th@@ less hun@@ ter who was inspired by a vision and later became the bis@@ hop of li@@ è@@ ge .
the hun@@ ting hor@@ n group of hun@@ ting three west@@ ph@@ alia under the direction of bri@@ g@@ it@@ te k@@ lu@@ th is playing on par@@ for@@ ce@@ h@@ ör@@ ner ( nature hor@@ ns in the mo@@ od it ) according to old french me@@ lo@@ dies .
the leaves wear riding clothes because they are mainly smooth and dur@@ able .
the f@@ es@@ tive fair will take place on sunday , november 3 , at 11.@@ 30 a.m.
the newly designed op@@ p g@@ lit@@ ter with a new café .
one that is essential to stay and re@@ visit .
one that is called the program .
as dé@@ j@@ à v@@ u , the term le@@ x@@ icon refers to a psycho@@ logical phenomenon that is reflected in the feeling that a new situation has been experienced or seen before .
in the event of the visit of the café of the same name at the op@@ sch@@ la@@ g in the district town of kle@@ ve , within sight of the rhe@@ in-@@ wa@@ al university , it is not necessary to remain at the pure dé@@ j@@ à v@@ u feeling .
finally , the café has exactly what it wants to do with its beautiful name : a real stay not only in mind but always in a comfortable way to experience again and again .
because it &apos;s fun and just great .
a look at the inner life at op@@ sch@@ la@@ g 8 gives the vie@@ wer a good feeling at first .
the ul@@ tra-@@ modern , but not cool caf@@ e ambi@@ ence looks like a place to feel good .
the team will spo@@ il you with the foun@@ ders mir@@ j@@ am van der ste@@ t and dani@@ el b@@ ü@@ tt@@ ner at the top with a variety of coffee and cock@@ tails .
there is also a delicious ca@@ ke or fres@@ h@@ ly ba@@ ked bag@@ u@@ et@@ tes .
the owners , both 33 years old , have already registered themselves before the opening of the lovely caf@@ e at the op@@ sch@@ la@@ g as a gastronom@@ er : in k@@ ran@@ enburg they led the &quot; art lounge &quot; .
from moving to kle@@ ve to op@@ sch@@ la@@ g , the sympa@@ thetic caf@@ é@@ -@@ lovers of the village hope to see more audience .
not least by the university .
&quot; while we do not have a specific target group , &quot; says dani@@ el b@@ ü@@ tt@@ ner .
rather , the two students here would like to address young students in the same way as senior citizens and all age groups in between .
speaking of caf@@ é@@ -@@ lovers .
the friendly owner &apos;s couple is behind the coffee table and the hotel is very well located .
enjoy the frag@@ rant hot bre@@ w in the most varied vari@@ ations .
expres@@ so@@ s is a german language spoken by the french and german speaking community .
dani@@ el b@@ ü@@ tt@@ ner is more of a expres@@ so fan and mir@@ j@@ am van der ste@@ l@@ le the cap@@ pu@@ c@@ c@@ ino drin@@ ker .
&quot; to add a bag@@ u@@ ette - that &apos;s my thing , &quot; she tells the n@@ r@@ z .
two events were already available in the bright café .
better , one .
the port festival took place outside - that is the café dé@@ j@@ à v@@ u , not benef@@ iting from it .
but there was also the r@@ ing@@ el@@ nat@@ z evening .
&quot; good , successful and fun@@ ny &quot; , the two 3@@ 3-@@ year-@@ ol@@ ds found .
but not everyone &apos;s business .
perhaps dani@@ el b@@ ü@@ tt@@ ner is not a particularly enthusi@@ astic fan of event ab@@ end@@ s. he is not able to say &quot; you can &apos;t all of them &quot; .
and i am always talking about the event that is also suitable for the special event .
that is why events will be the exception .
&quot; we want to keep the normal operation as little as possible &quot; .
this is to say : dé@@ j@@ à v@@ u also stands for reliability .
as regards the quality of the products offered here , as well as the team and the beautiful surroundings at the op@@ sch@@ la@@ ve .
the road , which is becoming a gastronom@@ ic m@@ ile , is becoming a real highlight .
to the deli@@ ght of many kle@@ ver , who has guests from near and far and students who love the ga@@ stro@@ m@@ ile and thus the café dé@@ j@@ à v@@ u for themselves .

a day of thanks to m@@ g@@ v in din@@ ker
it was the 16@@ 5th festival of foundation to which the m@@ g@@ v &quot; fried@@ rich wil@@ hel@@ m din@@ ker &quot; was invited this year and 52 guests , active s@@ än@@ ger and their sp@@ ous@@ es , were happy to come .
in the club hall of the restaurant &quot; wit@@ te@@ bor@@ g &quot; in din@@ ker all enjoyed the harmon@@ ious co@@ existence right under the sign of music .
tradi@@ tionally , the foundation festival is also the appropriate festival of festi@@ vity to hon@@ or .
the special award &quot; sing@@ er of the year &quot; was a great pleasure for the writer ro@@ l@@ f wag@@ en@@ er .
&quot; you have not only written a lot for us , but you have also done some la@@ ps for us , for which we thank you very much &quot; , says the chairman of the cho@@ ir er@@ ich sch@@ lo@@ t@@ mann .
the awards for participation in the performances and cho@@ ir performances are awarded by the association of the best sing@@ ers in the world .
the first was the first to be awarded the prize of the no@@ ten@@ w@@ art ar@@ tu@@ r br@@ ü@@ ck@@ ner .
a special thank you was given to the management of the association and to the team of club in@@ sid@@ er ange pi@@ er-@@ ri@@ b@@ bert , who once again had a menu of outstanding quality and sent it to ger@@ da pi@@ er-@@ ri@@ b@@ bert for the table decor@@ ation .
the m@@ g@@ v &quot; fried@@ rich@@ -@@ wil@@ hel@@ m &quot; meets at its regular ch@@ oral sam@@ ples always on tu@@ es@@ days at 7.@@ 45 p.m. at the club venue .
&quot; new s@@ wee@@ the@@ art vo@@ ices are welcome at any time &quot; , says sch@@ lo@@ t@@ mann .
un announ@@ ces new goals for poverty reduction in africa .
the united nations is now starting to draw up a series of new objectives that will help to implement the millennium development goals , which were announced 12 years ago , to combat poverty .
in the run@@ -up to the un summit on sustainable development , which is to be held in rio de jan@@ e@@ iro this evening , austr@@ ali@@ an diplom@@ ats played a key role in pus@@ hing for “ sustainable development goals ” that the 20@@ 15 millennium development goals are about .
they were included in the final draft document , which was adopted by world leaders , including mrs g@@ ill@@ ard , at the summit .
un secre@@ tar@@ y-@@ general ban ki@@ -@@ moon said at the summit in the evening that the time has come to go ‘ beyond national interests ’ .
“ i am pleased that the member states agree that the european union should initi@@ ate a process that will allow universal human rights and democracy to be established . ”
“ these goals will be based on our progress in the millennium development goals and will form an integral part of the global environment for development after 20@@ 15 .
i will spare no effort to make this document available to me by the member states , so as to promote our vision of sustainable development goals , which is based on the success of the millennium goals .
even if s@@ g achi@@ m / ba@@ den has been without victory for four days of the games , the hand@@ ball upper league remains in a good mo@@ od .
this is why tra@@ iner tom@@ as@@ z mal@@ mon leaves no doubt at all .
all are still fully motivated to do so .
i hope , however , that we will finally win again .
&quot; i know nothing more , how many people have won .
although the third league reserve is made up of fre@@ den@@ bec@@ k , there are currently no trees out of the reserve , mal@@ mon will highlight in advance the need to war@@ n the poin@@ ter fing@@ er .
many players i have seen in the a-@@ youth .
that is why they will vote against their ex@@ -@@ co@@ ach in particular .
&quot; furthermore , we must wait to see if there is further rein@@ for@@ cement from the first one , &quot; explains the s@@ g-@@ co@@ ach .
to finally get back to the track record , the country ’ s mal@@ mon@@ -@@ team must be able to move forward to the next level in comparison to the previous appear@@ ances .
above all , in the work of covering and swit@@ ching over to the game , it was a tremend@@ ous success .
the use of opportunities must definitely improve too .
i therefore hope that my players will be able to get their heads free during the short break .
security concerns in moz@@ ambi@@ que are growing , given cl@@ ash@@ es between influ@@ ential person@@ alities and political leaders .
thousands of people gathered in the centre of ma@@ pu@@ to under the vig@@ il@@ ant eyes of the stat@@ ue of sam@@ ora mac@@ hel , the founder and first president of moz@@ ambi@@ que , to be held in a rare public demonstration of peace .
“ we want peace again , we want stability , ” said van@@ ess@@ a de s@@ ous@@ a , managing director of an investment company .
fe@@ aring the country ’ s future , she has changed her business clothing to a t-@@ shir@@ t with the label “ we demand security ” in portuguese and has changed her name to the chinese independent market on thursday of the crow@@ d .
for two weeks , there have been reports of almost daily cl@@ ash@@ es between government forces and ren@@ am@@ o , which have been one of the worst batt@@ les since the peace agreement more than 20 years ago .
ren@@ am@@ o was once a not@@ ori@@ ous re@@ bel movement that initially opposed the regime ’ s white re@@ bel regime .
after the 1992 peace treaty , it became an opposition party .
analy@@ sts think it is unlikely that the country will return to a full-@@ blo@@ wn conflict , but the recent events have left foreign investors and indigenous people wor@@ ried .
for the fa@@ st-@@ growing economy , there is much at stake , because the discovery of vast gas depos@@ its off the coast and coal la@@ yers in the nor@@ th@@ west could generate investment of more than $ 50 billion from firms like rio t@@ into rio .
the ruling fre@@ li@@ mo party , since 197@@ 5 the dominant force , and ren@@ am@@ o are giving each other the blame for ten@@ sions .
ren@@ am@@ o claims that the government has been pro@@ vo@@ king the recent cl@@ ash@@ es by laun@@ ching its members in the province of so@@ fal@@ a , a traditional strong@@ hold of ren@@ am@@ os on 17 october .
the attacks on the former re@@ be@@ ls es@@ cal@@ ated as government troops ren@@ am@@ o-@@ bases and the military were att@@ acked .
the government gives ren@@ am@@ o the blame for the cl@@ ash@@ es and acc@@ uses the organization of att@@ acking soldiers .
president ar@@ man@@ do gu@@ e@@ bu@@ za has tried to raise concerns about inst@@ ability .
compared to af@@ p , the french news agency , he said on wednesday that d@@ hi had been a great success .
both fre@@ lim@@ o and ren@@ am@@ o stress that they must avoid war .
but concerns have increased since ma@@ z@@ ang@@ a began to speak of the need to ren@@ am@@ o .
he declared to the ft that he meant that fre@@ li@@ mo would not accept the agreement .
“ our vision is to re@@ start negotiations and to do so seriously , ” said ma@@ z@@ ang@@ a .
earlier talks between the parties have done little to resolve the ten@@ sions caused by a number of cl@@ ash@@ es in the country this year .
“ we have two adult men here ( gu@@ e@@ bu@@ za and dh@@ la@@ k@@ ama ) who are the ones who meet together , ” says joseph sm@@ ith han@@ l@@ on , lec@@ ture@@ r at the open university and moz@@ art university .
none of them is good at negotiating , and none is prepared to make the necessary conc@@ essions .
ren@@ am@@ o , who is pressing for electoral reforms , has already said that it will not be bo@@ y@@ cot@@ ting the november local elections .
presidential and parliamentary elections are planned for next year .
some comm@@ ent@@ ators have suggested the use of force as an attempt by an ail@@ ing movement to make conc@@ essions and financial conc@@ essions to the government .
ren@@ am@@ o ’ s electoral succ@@ esses have been shr@@ in@@ king since 1992 , while a ne@@ wer party , head@@ ed by a former ren@@ am@@ o member , has been bloc@@ king the election .
ma@@ z@@ ang@@ a claims that gu@@ e@@ bu@@ za – whose re@@ sign@@ ation is due when his second term comes to an end next year – is destro@@ ying the country ’ s democracy .
“ he does not want multi-@@ party democracy , he does not want transparent elections , he does not want peace because he does not want to give up the presidency , ” says ma@@ z@@ ang@@ a .
it is un@@ clear what capacities ren@@ am@@ o has , but it has caused dis@@ quiet and inci@@ tement to police stations and vehicles on an important north-@@ south line .
most of the batt@@ les took place in the province of so@@ fal@@ a , which was several hundred kilometres north of ma@@ pu@@ to , but in which be@@ ira is located , the port , the mining industry such as rio t@@ into and v@@ á@@ r@@ t .
in june , rio inter@@ rup@@ ted the use of the railways for a month after ren@@ am@@ o launched an attack on the track .
ma@@ z@@ ang@@ a rep@@ lied re@@ luc@@ tan@@ tly to the question whether ren@@ am@@ o would repeat this threat .
ren@@ am@@ o wanted to war@@ n the international community that things are going wrong in moz@@ ambi@@ que , ” said ma@@ z@@ ang@@ a .
inst@@ ability has fu@@ el@@ ed fru@@ stration over the government , says fer@@ nan@@ do li@@ ma , head of medi@@ am@@ o@@ op , a non-@@ governmental media company , because many people have wor@@ ried about the corruption that they have been experiencing .
&quot; people think that the government and the president are responsible for the country &apos;s future and he is the one who is going to find solutions to the problems , &quot; he explains .
om@@ ar sul@@ tan@@ e , a demonstr@@ ator , said that people simply wanted stability .
“ no one interested ren@@ am@@ o and fre@@ li@@ mo , they just want peace and us@@ able roads again , ” he explained .
children should be able to understand my@@ ths and leg@@ ends as “ models for life , ” says an author .
the stories of th@@ or showed that “ brut@@ al force is not a chance to fight cle@@ ver tr@@ ic@@ ks , ” and the ar@@ tus leg@@ end demonstrate that the power of the two is important .
many of the my@@ ths , however , are “ far too wild , too off@@ ensive , and in some cases too dir@@ ty to be taught at schools . ”
“ i think it is wonderful that in america my@@ ths and fol@@ kl@@ ore are already part of education , ” he said .
i have been doing this for twenty years now .
he added that authors and teachers are not allowed to &quot; over@@ ly di@@ d@@ ac@@ tic &quot; , but children would be “ completely sh@@ ut down ” because in enter@@ taining stories would be the messages “ enter@@ taining . ”
cros@@ s@@ ley hol@@ land , the be@@ ow@@ ul@@ f from the ang@@ lo@@ -@@ sa@@ x@@ on country , and the author of the pen@@ gu@@ in book of nor@@ se my@@ ths and the british fol@@ k tal@@ es , said : “ you can &apos;t be wrong . ”
perhaps the greatest difference between an adult author who wri@@ tes for adults and an author who is for children , is in the fact that he needs to conve@@ y hope .
not everything needs to be simplified or added to the happy end , but there is an in@@ tr@@ in@@ sic sense of good and evil .
this must be presented in a sub@@ tle way , revealed by history , and not explained .
this is the old story of showing rather than telling .
han@@ s@@ j@@ ak@@ o@@ b moves to fre@@ i@@ hof again .
100 years ago he@@ in@@ rich han@@ s@@ j@@ ak@@ o@@ b re@@ sts in has@@ l@@ ach , on sunday the company was re@@ located to the &quot; fre@@ i@@ hof &quot; .
the many spec@@ t@@ ators were impres@@ sed by the extremely short cast of scenes .
from arrival through the award of hon@@ or@@ ary citizenship to his death , dre@@ h@@ bu@@ ch@@ au@@ tor and han@@ s@@ j@@ ak@@ ob@@ ar@@ ker alo@@ is kra@@ f@@ tz@@ cy@@ k had a fun piece to create , which was directed by the director .
mar@@ c@@ us z@@ ag@@ er@@ mann took the audience as spo@@ kes@@ person through the ten different scenes , explained contex@@ ts and brid@@ ged jum@@ ps from the youth to the close pen@@ sion@@ ing .
on october 22 , 19@@ 13 han@@ s@@ j@@ ak@@ o@@ b heim comes to his children &apos;s heav@@ en , his open-@@ air cour@@ ty@@ ard .
and then the scene game began , in which alo@@ is kra@@ f@@ cz@@ y@@ k once again played in his par@@ ad@@ er@@ ol@@ le as the great son of the city .
he went on to bre@@ a@@ the in silence with the tw@@ in-@@ sha@@ ving and the black forest fo@@ xes from er@@ ich bec@@ he@@ rer from m@@ ü@@ h@@ len@@ bach .
it was not only received by the audience with much applause , but also his si@@ ster phili@@ pp@@ ine welcomed him .
bil@@ ly sum her@@ mann understood it incredi@@ bly well to be in the role of si@@ ster .
the game was played between the scenes of the m@@ ü@@ h@@ len@@ bach farm@@ er &apos;s cha@@ pel with carefully selected music and thus roun@@ ded off the performance .
the city of bon@@ n was then ad@@ mitted to the hon@@ or@@ ary dignity of may@@ or he@@ in@@ z win@@ k@@ ler , who was in charge of the former office of the former ap@@ e h@@ ä@@ t@@ ti@@ ch along with a part of the city council .
their up@@ keep then made the tri@@ -@@ king sing@@ ers , the han@@ s@@ j@@ ak@@ o@@ b to the call : &quot; o@@ h how beautiful , there will again be youth mem@@ ories of my own tri@@ -@@ king period alive &quot; .
with your song &quot; o jes@@ u@@ le@@ in &quot; you enjoyed the audience at the open air and the stor@@ ch@@ ent@@ ag@@ sk@@ in@@ der with their l@@ oud &quot; out , out &quot; .
his criticism of the church of the holy vir@@ gin had been expressed by han@@ s@@ j@@ ak@@ o@@ b at the time , as did his concerns about the exc@@ esses in agriculture , the consequences of industri@@ alisation or the effects of war .
in the home , behind its tom@@ b cha@@ pel on the fire at ho@@ f@@ st@@ et@@ ten , he found his reti@@ rement .
&quot; a trou@@ b@@ led mind had finally found his calm and had gone fore@@ ver &quot; , it was said at the end of the scene play .
much applause and many words of p@@ raise were given by the audience for the performance .

if there is a wil@@ d@@ card procedure , then there is no guarantee for the nec@@ k@@ ar giant that a competi@@ tor will be less .
the bas@@ ket@@ ball project hamburg to@@ wers does not allow any application for a possible post-@@ match event .
&quot; we will not participate in the wil@@ d@@ card process , &quot; said ex@@ -@@ national player pas@@ cal roll@@ er , who has been using the concept for a professional club in the han@@ se@@ atic city since 2012 .
a first bre@@ ath was from lu@@ d@@ wi@@ gs@@ burg not to be heard .
&quot; we did not deal with the wil@@ d@@ card procedure , as long as it is not clear that d@@ üs@@ sel@@ dorf will receive a licence &quot; , said nec@@ kar@@ -@@ ri@@ es@@ en-@@ bo@@ ss alexander re@@ il of our newspaper .

in a new ze@@ al@@ and small town bur@@ t mur@@ o is considered a charming cau@@ cas@@ us because he has decided to travel to the city by motor@@ cycle , built in 19@@ 20 , in a race in america .
bur@@ t is a good place to start your dream , despite a heart error .
with its savings , a few don@@ ations and a mort@@ gage on its old workshop shoes , the company is setting up a new office for the company by ship to los angel@@ es .

in addition to coal imports , r@@ hen@@ us mid@@ g@@ ard also reli@@ es on win@@ d-@@ storage logistics .
black g@@ lows the coal on the camp@@ site in front of the dam .
two massive blue sho@@ ts and a back@@ pack for the re@@ char@@ ge@@ able device either distribute or load the coal as needed .
every movement of the trans@@ shi@@ pment unit sounds a sh@@ iny warning noise over@@ flow@@ ing across the ter@@ rain .
&quot; the signals serve to protect the safety and are prescri@@ bed by law , &quot; says mat@@ thi@@ as sch@@ re@@ ll , managing director of r@@ hen@@ us mid@@ g@@ ard in wil@@ hel@@ m@@ sha@@ ven .
in case of un@@ favourable wind , the wind is unfortunately widely heard - and there have been some complaints from people from the north of the city .
he takes the complaints very seriously and has therefore cont@@ acted those concerned , says the 4@@ 0-@@ year-@@ old .
in close consultation with the authorities , we are now in the process of sending out the warning signals with technical measures .
he continues to rely on open dialogue with his neighbours .

ben green@@ man : ten years of new york com@@ edy festival : the new yor@@ ker
one might say that new york city is the birth@@ place of stand@@ -@@ up com@@ edy in america : a year ago , the american film director , wil@@ li@@ am sh@@ at@@ ner , began to perform as a conf@@ é@@ ren@@ ci@@ er in the palace .
over the years , f@@ ays innovation has been expanded , as was the most recent at the new york com@@ edy festival .
founded and directed by car@@ ol@@ ine h@@ ir@@ sch , founder of the stand@@ -@@ up@@ -@@ institu@@ t car@@ ol@@ ines , the festival celebra@@ tes its 15@@ th anniversary this year .
“ most of these head@@ lin@@ ers started with car@@ ol@@ ine and were then increasingly successful , until they were finally found to be known to be in a club . ”
we have designed this festival so that we can continue to work with you .
at this year &apos;s event there are performances by w@@ anda sy@@ kes , ka@@ thy gri@@ ff@@ in and bill ma@@ her as well as from “ stand up for her@@ oes ” , an annual music and com@@ edy show .
the festival also brings the world of com@@ edy to life .
a number of com@@ edi@@ ans who will participate in the festival this year are delighted by the rather un@@ conventional ways , such as broad@@ ca@@ sts on smaller television channels such as com@@ edy central , f@@ x and spi@@ ke .
n@@ ick k@@ roll was awarded a sit@@ com on cable tv ( the ir@@ onic sli@@ p on the fant@@ as@@ y foot@@ b@@ all-@@ series “ the leading football ” on f@@ x@@ x ) and has now published his own ske@@ tch show .
jen@@ ny s@@ late was present at the saturday night live as well as at the parks and recre@@ ation .
both k@@ roll and sla@@ ve and other young com@@ edi@@ ans with characteristic vo@@ ices ( the sur@@ real pes@@ si@@ mis@@ tic an@@ th@@ ony jes@@ el@@ nik , the ir@@ onic , on r@@ aci@@ al the@@ ories ) .
the biggest mag@@ net visitors of the festival include an interview : david ste@@ in@@ berg talks with lar@@ ry david .
ste@@ in@@ berg began as a stand@@ -up com@@ edi@@ an , but has become a respected television and film director .
from 2005 to 2007 he ho@@ sted a television programme entitled “ sit down ” , which was broad@@ cast by david ste@@ in@@ berg on tv land .
the meeting will take place in the town hall in the middle of man@@ h@@ att@@ an .
“ the city is definitely in the com@@ ed@@ y-@@ d@@ na of lar@@ ry ’ s entire work , ” said ste@@ in@@ berg .
he told me when he is here , i go to see him sometimes through the street between two buildings and think : he@@ y , if i have all my money lo@@ ose , i live perhaps here .
iran satisfied with the process of nuclear negotiations
iran is showing itself a week before the next nuclear meeting with the five un ve@@ to@@ es and germany satisfied with the negotiating process .
&quot; after years , agreement has now been reached with the international atom@@ ic energy agency to resolve the differences of recent years , &quot; he wrote .
it would be a long way off , but the nuclear negoti@@ ator is not satisfied with the negotiation process and is also optim@@ istic that both sides will end up finding a solution .
dr@@ ama in ur@@ u@@ gu@@ ay : young kill gam@@ es@@ r@@ ades with mac@@ he@@ te , and the k@@ ill@@ er are killed .
two children have been killed in ur@@ u@@ gu@@ ay by a 1@@ 1-@@ year-@@ old .
the two 14 and 12 year-@@ old bo@@ ys had invited their victims to go bird hun@@ ting with them .
with mac@@ he@@ tes and k@@ ni@@ ves , they arrived in the city on tuesday , and were thro@@ wing the cor@@ pse into the fire .
they would then have to be in a work@@ ing-@@ class area of football in front of their homes .
the body was found in the following night in the village of cer@@ ro pel@@ ado , 15 km north of the exclusive beach there pun@@ ta del est@@ e .
as an ali@@ bi , a fi@@ ve-@@ year half-@@ si@@ ster of the younger one who took her away should say that she was sex@@ ually att@@ acked by the boy .
but when the girl was in front of the police without men@@ tioning an attack against her , she gave the two bo@@ ys the deliber@@ ate killing .
the reason why the older person called a ri@@ val@@ ry in the football game .
he was tempor@@ arily transferred to a psy@@ chi@@ at@@ ric youth institution .
p@@ im@@ ps must be released into prison .
because of explo@@ it@@ ative human trafficking , p@@ im@@ ps , threats , insul@@ ts and dangerous physical in@@ jury , the court of kon@@ stan@@ z has sent@@ enced a 3@@ 3-@@ year-@@ old man from st. geor@@ gen to three and a half years in prison .
the former german military soldi@@ er , who was killed in afghanistan as a do@@ or@@ ste@@ er , was in charge of a trial agreement .
so in five cases he has sent women via internet or telephone contacts .
he used to resi@@ st violence and threats .
women &apos;s income , which has been ear@@ marked for them for some years , has remained at a stand@@ still .
conf@@ is@@ c@@ ation of mobile phones and si@@ m cards under@@ b@@ ended the women &apos;s contacts to the outside world .
together with a colleague who communic@@ ates women , he brought them to various bor@@ de@@ ls in the south-@@ west .
there he had some monitoring of them to control their revenue .
in court , the def@@ end@@ ant first claimed that he was suffering from a serious tra@@ um@@ a after colleagues in afghanistan were dying alongside him in an explo@@ sion .
after a psy@@ chi@@ at@@ ric expert has expressed serious doubts about the mental restric@@ tion and hence about a limited liability for the in@@ jury , he has put forward a proposal for a comprehensive conf@@ ession .
the court had to inform no more of the women who were in@@ ju@@ red .
as a cri@@ po official reported , the number of people who had been arrested for using telephone surveillance measures was at least four more cases of explo@@ it@@ ative trafficking .
the inter@@ views were highly aggres@@ sive , and the talks were very much in evidence .
later on , the estimated damage would have been the result of their mar@@ ty@@ r@@ dom .
another witness , in which one of the women was blue sta@@ ins on the whole body , has not yet made any statement .
it is a &apos; completely broken constitution &apos; .
the def@@ end@@ ant regre@@ t@@ ted his behaviour yesterday .
&quot; he has been dis@@ solved from these cir@@ cles and wants to be a normal life after the de@@ tention , &quot; he said .
oil prices continue to rise to usd 96 per bar@@ re@@ l .
the price of oil has also fallen on friday , after concerns about a high supply have over@@ sh@@ ad@@ ow@@ ed a report that the ener@@ g@@ y-@@ intensive manufacturing sector in china is growing .
the reference cru@@ de oil for deli@@ veries in december was late in the morning in europe in electronic commerce at the new york mer@@ can@@ tile exchange .
the treaty fell by 39 c@@ ents on thursday , which resulted in a 5.@@ 8 % drop in the price of october .
the large range of cru@@ de oil has increased prices in recent weeks .
the us department of energy declared on wednesday that the us offer had been reduced by 4.@@ 1 million bar@@ re@@ ls .
over five weeks , the offer had been expanded by 25 million bar@@ re@@ ls .
but on friday there were indic@@ ations of increased demand by two reports on an increase in chinese manufacturing activities .
this suggests a continued recovery in the chinese economy , whose growth is set at 7.@@ 8 % in the third quarter .

the court blocks the decision on stop@@ -@@ and-@@ fr@@ is@@ k of the n@@ y@@ p@@ d &apos;s stop@@ -@@ and-@@ fr@@ is@@ k directive .
a federal appe@@ als court in the us bloc@@ ked the order of a judicial authority on thursday to make changes to the stop and free@@ ze regime .
the second us court of appeal stated that jud@@ ges shi@@ ra ’ s decisions would be suspended until more than a call for the city was made .
the judge had been ur@@ ged in august to susp@@ end the city against the constitution with the way in which it was implemented for the an@@ ch@@ oring and ques@@ tioning of people .
the city appe@@ aled against its assessment and the ordered dis@@ su@@ a@@ sive measures , including the decision to establish a monitoring centre to monitor the activities of the police in changing its directive and the appropriate training programme .
the court of appeal heard the arguments on tuesday that the suspension of the court of appeal was called for .
the appeal report stated that the judge must be informed of the case and that the court must be informed of the code of conduct for us jud@@ ges by determin@@ ing whether the case is the judge .
the judge had rul@@ ed that police officers were in@@ ju@@ red in the civil rights of tens of thousands of people because they were in@@ appropri@@ ately targeted black people and latin american men with the st@@ alling mechanism .
she appointed an external unit to monitor the implementation of essential changes , including reforms to directives , training and staff supervision , and ordered the commission to launch a pilot programme aimed at improving the quality of cameras in neighbor@@ ho@@ ods where the most are .
in august , the city of new york agreed to review the practice of stor@@ ing names and addresses of people who are searching for control by the police .
an oral negotiation on the appointment of the city is scheduled after 14 march 20@@ 14 .
the stop and fr@@ is@@ k-@@ tac@@ tic has been used by a number of civil rights def@@ enders .
controls of this kind have been in place for decades in various forms , but the number of recorded checks during the term of office of the par@@ tis@@ an may@@ or michael blo@@ om@@ berg has ris@@ en to an all-@@ time high of 6@@ 8@@ 4.@@ 3@@ 30 in 2011 black american men and the year in 2011 .
in 2004 , four men belonging to all minorities were brought to court , who were guil@@ ty of a collective action .
ad@@ voca@@ tes of changes to the stop and fr@@ is@@ k program of the n@@ y@@ p@@ d say that changes will end unfair practices and create a more tr@@ usted and effective strategy for police and the way in which they operate .
oppon@@ ents believe that the changes will change the mor@@ ale of the police , but not crimin@@ ality ; nor would money be was@@ ted and the broader problem of a police force that is forced to leave after thousands of posts have been lost in the last decade .
the judge pointed out that the judge had not been able to veri@@ fy the stop and fr@@ is@@ k practice , the constitutional practice of which was only the type of implementation of the controls by the n@@ y@@ pt .

with this be@@ dou@@ in wis@@ dom , the first chairman wol@@ f@@ gan@@ g hen@@ ne described the history and fas@@ c@@ ination of the association &quot; helping hands &quot; .
on saturday afternoon , the t@@ enth birth@@ day of the association was celebrated , which was already considerable .
the first chairman , hen@@ ne , has reported at length on the work of the association .
he himself was the first time in 2004 in maur@@ it@@ ania in the che@@ ij@@ k-@@ z@@ a@@ ed hospital in n@@ ou@@ ak@@ ch@@ ot@@ t .
as a result , further cooperation developed , and gy@@ na@@ eco@@ log@@ ist hen@@ ne was on the spot carrying out numerous operations on several trips .
during the speeches , pictures of the operations were taken on a large can@@ v@@ as , so guests of the anniversary cere@@ mony of the a@@ fore@@ mentioned actions can make a picture .
the deser@@ t vehicle of the association was also shown .
it is a former federal border protection vehicle .
ra@@ iner pre@@ w@@ o , the former o@@ b of n@@ ag@@ old , had proposed to use this vehicle with a photo@@ vol@@ ta@@ ic system and is now planning to build a new one , according to hen@@ ne , at the club in consultation .
in 2008 , zim@@ mer@@ e@@ i sch@@ le@@ e@@ h from ba@@ i@@ er@@ s@@ br@@ on@@ n won the first prize in the record time of almost a week in so@@ co@@ gi@@ m , a mis@@ ery quarter on the edge of the capital city .
hen@@ ne also mentioned a new mother child hospital in nov@@ o mes@@ to , where she was born .
especially interesting in times when the birth rate in n@@ ag@@ old is becoming increasingly widespread .
you learn a lot in africa as a medical doctor , according to hen@@ ne , for example , de@@ pression against bur@@ n-@@ out .
the political un@@ rest in the country has not allowed us to make as many jour@@ ne@@ ys as we had planned , but many medical doctors came to germany for hosp@@ itali@@ zation in various areas .
in addition , contain@@ ers are sent regularly to africa , so in march of this year medical equipment , medicines , band@@ ages , hospital beds and br@@ ic@@ ks .
the company has been operating in the field of software development since 198@@ 7 .
as his personal mo@@ tives were called his work in the area of aud@@ iting as a young member .
when he realized how much money was lost on the way , he decided to help the afric@@ ans in controlling a budget .
fu@@ ch@@ tel also stressed that the global economy also needs global love of humanity .
nor should it be forgotten that africa is closer than some think .

cou@@ l@@ son used telephone h@@ acking to check a tip .
the former news of the word editor and@@ y cou@@ l@@ son re@@ porte@@ dly put “ tele@@ ph@@ one-@@ h@@ acking , surveillance , and confron@@ tation ” in an attempt to get a wrong tip about an aff@@ air of the then interior minister charles de ga@@ ul@@ son .
public prosecu@@ tor andre@@ w ed@@ is q@@ c explained to the court in the old b@@ ail@@ ey , news of the world sent a false rum@@ or in may 2005 that c@@ lar@@ ke was a relationship with his “ attractive special advis@@ er . ”
the newspaper commission@@ ed the private detec@@ tive gl@@ en@@ n mul@@ ca@@ ire to investigate pa@@ w@@ l@@ by &apos;s vo@@ ic@@ em@@ ail@@ s .
“ according to the public prosecu@@ tor , cou@@ l@@ son , who is now the editor of the federal state security and defence agency , is not a person who stands in front of the home of people and hopes to catch them fresh , but one who knows .
he said that not@@ w uses three procedures to write stories investi@@ ga@@ tive .
the publish@@ er is personally involved in the third method .
obviously he knows of the second , the monitoring , otherwise it cannot be .
what about the first ?
does he know about phone h@@ acking ?
he den@@ ies that , but we say , ‘ and whether he knew about it ’ .
rum@@ ors of an aff@@ air of clar@@ kes were first heard by the feature ed@@ it@@ orial of no@@ tw@@ . when one source , the sexual nature of pa@@ w@@ l@@ by , was discovered .
a volume with vo@@ ic@@ em@@ ail@@ s from your phone of at least three occasions was published in august 2006 in mul@@ ca@@ i@@ res apartment .
the investig@@ ators also found entries on the de@@ te@@ k@@ tive &apos;s computer where pa@@ w@@ l@@ by and their si@@ ster were named “ projects ” .
in the time when research was running , the results of the research were given by the grand@@ parents of pa@@ w@@ l@@ by anonymous calls asking for information about them .
meanwhile , the former chief executive officer , ne@@ ville , supervis@@ ed the entire company , including the former re@@ porter , j@@ . we@@ at@@ ther@@ up , to monitor the movements of pa@@ w@@ l@@ by .
on 18 june 2005 , cou@@ l@@ son left her a vo@@ ic@@ email with the following content : “ i have a story that we will release tomorrow , about which i would like to talk to charles . ”
ed@@ is explained that cou@@ l@@ son &apos;s activities at this story followed the same pattern as in other important person@@ alities , such as the former interior minister david bl@@ un@@ ket@@ t .
the jury heard on thursday that co@@ le &apos;s bl@@ un@@ ket@@ t was not allowed to be released because of an aff@@ air with a married woman when he himself was involved in the charges .

in protest against the planned wealth tax , the french football is actually going to be the first strike since 197@@ 2 .
a conciliation meeting is a fru@@ it@@ less end .
in the conflict over the wealth tax , the government and the professional football have been forced to fight for their rights in france after a failed conciliation meeting .
president fran@@ ç@@ o@@ is hol@@ lan@@ de received a very warm welcome from the french president , who was elected to the paris é@@ ly@@ s@@ ée palace on thursday , and also heard their complaints .
he refused to accept the foot ball from the planned world cup 7@@ 5-@@ percent .
the other side also remained tough .
the plan for the strike announced for the end of november will now be followed , the chief association of professional clubs ( u@@ c@@ p@@ f ) , je@@ an-@@ pi@@ er@@ re lou@@ vel , announced .
the agreement reached between 29 november and 2 december is a step forward in li@@ gue 1 and li@@ gue 2 .
ge@@ ech@@ ing@@ es : no absolute protection possible .
&quot; we want to involve the inhabitants early on in planning , &quot; may@@ or j@@ ens h@@ ä@@ us@@ ler opened the citizens &apos; information event on the flo@@ od protection concept in ge@@ ch@@ ingen .
around 80 participants were invited to the municip@@ al hall to see the planned measures .
chi@@ efs made it clear that the final decisions will be taken by the members of the municip@@ al council .
the floo@@ ds , the g@@ ing@@ ing on 15 may 2009 , un@@ prepared , were a dramatic b@@ low to the european union &apos;s ability to protect its citizens .
a river bas@@ in investigation was conducted with the neighbouring town of a@@ id@@ ling@@ en , which is now the basis for the flo@@ od protection concept in ge@@ ch@@ ingen .
&quot; the protection of as many cultiv@@ ated land as possible is the goal &quot; , so sk@@ in@@ ning .
the planning is based on the planning of protection against a statis@@ tically 100 years weather service forec@@ ast floo@@ ding every 100 years .
climate change is caused by a 15 % sur@@ charge .
in specialist cir@@ cles , this is done with &quot; h@@ q 100@@ ak@@ li@@ ma &quot; .
the water mass@@ es that were found in ge@@ ch@@ ingen in 2009 caused considerable damage were equivalent to a 10@@ 00@@ -@@ year flo@@ od .
&quot; there is no absolute protection , but relative improvement can be achieved &quot; , says the chief econom@@ ist .
to protect the h@@ q 100@@ ak@@ li@@ ma , you must have a g@@ ing@@ ed about four million euros , with the community having a land subsid@@ y in the amount of around 70 percent .
chi@@ efs , however , pointed out that it only makes the promotion possible if a global approach is implemented .
to this end , the municip@@ ality should be dependent on the participation of the citizens .
a complex planning and implementation process is a necessary part of the process .
at best , 20@@ 16 could begin implementation .
among other things , the protection concept , which was already adopted last week in the municip@@ al council ( we reported ) , provides for local measures in the flow of the river ir@@ m from the st@@ am@@ m@@ heim valley .
after the presentation of the flo@@ od protection concept , participants took the opportunity to discuss their concerns .
among other things , it was ques@@ tioned why no more dam@@ s and re@@ stra@@ int bas@@ ins were planned for the protection of the place .
gre@@ g@@ or k@@ ü@@ hn , the specialist plan@@ ner of the commission@@ ed engineering office wal@@ d and cor@@ be from h@@ ü@@ gel@@ sh@@ ei@@ m , who presented the concept , stressed that it needed to inter@@ act with all the measures presented in order to achieve the sum .
it is also necessary to consider the most econom@@ ical solution , as jo@@ achi@@ m wal@@ d von wal@@ d and cor@@ be said .
dis@@ pleasure prevail@@ ed among al@@ tor@@ t lovers , who even in normal th@@ under@@ stor@@ ms were repeatedly subjec@@ ted to over@@ load of the channel network .
the problem is known to the administration and the first steps have already been taken .
chi@@ efs , however , pointed out that the guidelines for channel systems are different from those for the floo@@ ds protection and not to be conf@@ used .
the municip@@ ality is obliged to develop the channel network in such a way that two to three years of reg@@ ener@@ ation can be comp@@ en@@ sa@@ ted .
the se@@ wer@@ age channels larger to dimen@@ sion@@ ally would dev@@ our millions .
serious in@@ jur@@ ies after col@@ li@@ sion
early friday afternoon , the national road 44 is near rev@@ ens@@ dorf and two drivers are driving a fron@@ tal col@@ li@@ sion .
the police closed the street immediately completely , but could not go to the accident first .
however , there are various testi@@ mon@@ ies that need to be evalu@@ ated first .
it is a fact that the 19 year-@@ old ste@@ ering of a v@@ w golf is heading towards rev@@ ens@@ dorf and that the 3@@ 8-@@ year-@@ old ge@@ t@@ tor@@ f man has been standing with his hy@@ un@@ da@@ i .
both vehicles cl@@ ash@@ ed , with the woman being so hard pressed to get the fire bri@@ g@@ ade for nearly half an hour , to be driven out of the vehicle w@@ rec@@ k .
the actual cause of the accident was not clear at first .
both of them were killed in nearby hospit@@ als .
the route remained fully maintained for about two hours .
it could be called the do@@ sto@@ ev@@ sky of the us .
phili@@ p k. dic@@ k was a go@@ d-@@ see@@ ker , a me@@ ta@@ physi@@ c@@ ist , his nov@@ els and stories also have a ser@@ ial .

dic@@ k had div@@ ine experiences , his late books read like a mix@@ ture of the rev@@ el@@ ation of john and a computer manual .
perhaps he was cra@@ zy , had drugs left his brain .
he has cap@@ tured , early on , that the computers are div@@ ini@@ ties .
he wrote a the@@ ology of the computer and asked what a man could expect from a machine he created , the cre@@ ator of his creation .
this is the &apos; bl@@ ade run@@ ner &apos; problem .
killing .
a master of science fic@@ tion .
a fantastic writer .
his stories have given film directors such as rid@@ ley scot@@ t , paul ver@@ ho@@ even and ste@@ ven spi@@ el@@ berg inspiration .
this story is now particularly significant .
the &quot; minority report &quot; comes from the year 195@@ 6 , but it ex@@ u@@ des the sm@@ ell of the cold war and the mc@@ car@@ thy tri@@ bun@@ al .
the principle of &apos; pre-@@ crime &apos; is being developed here , &apos; pre-@@ crime &apos; , in other words what has now become more or less official doc@@ tr@@ ine of the white house .
in dic@@ k ’ s world , which is like ours fri@@ ghten@@ ing , mu@@ t@@ ants look to the future - and the police are interven@@ ing .
&quot; we collect individuals who do not pass any law , &quot; says the chief of the authority .
&quot; we take them to us even before they commit a violent crime , &quot; he said .
and : &quot; in our society there are no serious crimin@@ als , for which we have a pun@@ ishment flag@@ s full of pes@@ u@@ do crimin@@ als &quot; , they read time stre@@ ams .
they assume that bad things happen and prevent the war crimin@@ als from being used in practice .
dic@@ k ’ s nar@@ ra@@ tive acts as the blue@@ print for anti-@@ terrorist laws and the inter@@ ro@@ gation of n@@ sa .
anticip@@ ation of the attack : this is how obama ’ s dr@@ one philosophy and practice works .
but dic@@ ks story is not finished yet .
the police chief compla@@ ins that there is no separation of powers .
then the supervis@@ or will be supervis@@ ed and a future crime will be carried out .
the system is rot@@ ating .
it is perfect , but it lies .

former us intelligence ex@@ am
representatives of the german federal att@@ or@@ ney could either ask questions in writing or ask the 30@@ -@@ year-@@ old personally in russia , inter@@ fax reported .
previously , the federal green party member han@@ s-@@ christian sch@@ ö@@ be@@ le had been the first german politici@@ an to have made snow@@ den in moscow yesterday to discuss the future of the aff@@ air with him .
n@@ sa rev@@ el@@ ations reinforce corporate par@@ an@@ o@@ ia due to state surveillance .
on a mil@@ d day at the end of august , a german police helicop@@ ter fle@@ w deep across the us consul@@ ate in frankfurt am main , the german financial capital .
at the instruc@@ tion of the federal office for constitutional protection and the fight against terrorism ( b@@ v@@ t ) , the german internal security service , it should be able to take photographs of the roof of the us out@@ post , which is less than 5 km away from the european central bank .
according to the german media , the b@@ v@@ t wanted to prevent the presence of surveillance an@@ ten@@ n@@ as and the action led to a change of language between the us and the german foreign ministry in berlin .
james cla@@ pper , us director of national intelligence , has been in september to insist once again that the us has no means of over@@ seas es@@ pi@@ on@@ age , “ to reduce company secre@@ ts . ”
but since ed@@ ward snow@@ den , who was a wh@@ ist@@ le@@ b@@ lower , was a former employee with the publication of his hor@@ n to us surveillance secre@@ ts , he has been un@@ aware of european governments and business leaders .
reports that the us national security agency has been reporting to the braz@@ ili@@ an oil company petro@@ b@@ as have been on the move and that data from american cl@@ oud suppliers , including google and y@@ a@@ ho@@ o , have been dis@@ rup@@ ted .
the bar@@ re@@ l of over@@ flow@@ ing brought the rev@@ el@@ ation that chancell@@ or ang@@ ela mer@@ kel ’ s phone was w@@ oun@@ ded , perhaps for ten years .
if the most powerful person in europe can be targeted , then surely the most powerful of the companies are potential targets .
snow@@ den has developed the intensive cooperation between us intelligence services and companies in a transparent manner .
i think it is con@@ cei@@ vable that these data will be used for mutual benefit .
“ germany must wake up , ” explains oli@@ ver gr@@ ü@@ n , president of bit@@ mi , who is a small and medium-sized it company in germany .
german companies believe that the us has now posed an almost equal risk to china when it comes to industrial es@@ pi@@ on@@ age and data the@@ ft , such a survey that has shown that it is likely to be supported by ey &apos;s consult@@ ants in july .
snow@@ den ’ s snow@@ den le@@ ak@@ ed documents , however , have not provided evidence that the us has broken trade secre@@ ts from foreign companies to its own companies .
politicians have expressed concern that the euro will be depri@@ ved of certain it and internet opportunities and that it will reduce its dependence on the us .
companies are s@@ cep@@ tical about this .
in the bun@@ de@@ sta@@ g , it was suggested that we should build a german google .
i can only close my eyes and open them slowly ...
“ this is not how things work , ” h@@ as@@ so pl@@ att@@ ner , chairman of the german software manufacturer sap .
if we want a strong european it industry , then we should not have had it 20 years ago .
everything in germany is subsid@@ ised , from coal to cars to oil and agriculture .
everything except the it industry .
nevertheless , scope and technical re@@ fin@@ ement of the snow@@ mobile ’ s rev@@ el@@ ations have not yet reached the limits of the us sp@@ y authorities .
cl@@ oud compu@@ ting is under@@ going a major change , because european business leaders are now more aware that in the us , stored data of the legal juris@@ pru@@ dence is subject to and therefore potentially end@@ ange@@ red .
according to a survey conducted by the cl@@ oud security alliance , a commercial institution , the united states government has issued a survey of the most recent financial crises in the world .
j@@ im sn@@ ab@@ e , depu@@ ty managing director of sap , says : “ we see a new question from customers who are not there before a year ago .
many german business leaders believe that the latest reports simply confirm what they have done anyway .
the fact that economic es@@ pi@@ on@@ age is taking place is no surprise .
that has always been the case .

k@@ end@@ ric@@ k jo@@ hn@@ son from val@@ do@@ sta in the state of georgia in the united states was arrested on january 11 in an u@@ pri@@ ght m@@ at han@@ ging behind the grand@@ stand in the school gym .
the s@@ cour@@ ge &apos;s investig@@ ators at low@@ n@@ des county university came to the conclusion that the jo@@ hn@@ son was not able to help in a tragic accident , which caused the family of the 17@@ -@@ year-@@ old , however .
“ they are convinced that their son was mur@@ dered , ” ben@@ jam@@ in cr@@ um@@ p , the law@@ yer of ken@@ ne@@ th and jam@@ in cr@@ um@@ p , declared jo@@ hn@@ son to fo@@ x@@ new@@ s.@@ com@@ .
they would never have believed that he had died as it was in the sh@@ eri@@ ff &apos;s mind .
“ they believe that everyone is free of logic , but that the laws of physi@@ cs , as well as common sense , are not .
instead , they are convinced that the truth is being conce@@ aled to justify the person or person responsible for the death of their son .
&quot; her son went to school to learn and came to the body bag , &quot; comments he .
us prosecu@@ tor michael mo@@ ore said on thursday that there will be a formal investigation into the death of jo@@ hn@@ son , because a number of important questions remain un@@ answered .
what was the cause of death ?
is his death a crime ?
the mo@@ ore declared at a press conference on thursday afternoon .
i follow the facts in which you are leading .
my aim is to find out the truth .
“ i believe that a sufficient number of factors are needed to form a formal investigation , ” said he .
mo@@ ore told re@@ porters that the initial au@@ top@@ sy suggests that the us would be a good place to be jud@@ ged by the consequences of a “ post@@ ation@@ -@@ related suff@@ oc@@ ation . ”
a second au@@ top@@ sy , however , has caused another death , according to mo@@ ore .
“ there are a number of questions that need to be answered or confirmed , ” he said .
mo@@ ore added if there is sufficient evidence for a criminal investigation .
a representative of the county sh@@ eri@@ ffs authority was waiting for our request on thursday , but was not able to comment immediately .

c@@ dc publish aller@@ gic re@@ actions for schools and schools in the eu and other countries in the eu .
on wednesday , the cen@@ ters for di@@ e@@ ting control ( c@@ c@@ p ) released a report on the situation in the united states .
these are the first directives of this kind that the us government has issued , as the number of compulsory children in school is growing , with food aller@@ gies .
one in 20 children in the united states now has a food aller@@ gy .
the spread of food aller@@ gies among children has , according to the c@@ dc , increased by 18 % between 1997 and 2007 .
the guidelines contain information for schools that are registered with the teacher and staff for food aller@@ gies .
it is also recommended that schools use ep@@ ine@@ ph@@ r@@ in in stock – the auto injec@@ tion of the brand ep@@ ide@@ mic is most commonly used – to prevent a potentially le@@ th@@ al over@@ sensi@@ tivity effect .
the legisl@@ ators in the states have recently amended the rules so that schools can provide ep@@ in@@ ep@@ h@@ ri with easier access .
the report also contains a list of typical symp@@ t@@ oms that children can have , which are aller@@ gic to them .
children may say , “ it feels as if something is on my ton@@ gue ” , “ my ton@@ gue feels like it is on the surface , as if a hair is on it ” or “ my ton@@ gue is cri@@ b@@ bing ” .
parents of inter@@ sexual children can “ be sex@@ ually im@@ determined ” , but they can choose “ sex im@@ person@@ ated ” .
germany is the first european nation to have a third gender for children .
new@@ born children are no longer being subjec@@ ted to rigi@@ d male or female as@@ sign@@ ments .
under the new law , parents no longer have to declare sex for such children , but can be “ un@@ determined ” or “ not fixed ” on the birth certificate .
the aim of the law is to reduce the pressure of parents so that they do not take ha@@ sty decisions on operations for a gender bre@@ eding in new@@ born children .
an inter@@ sexual person said , according to bb@@ c years later , “ i am neither man nor woman . ”
i remain the pat@@ ch@@ work that is being created by doctors , mu@@ ti@@ lated and full of sc@@ ars .
it is estimated that one in 2 000 children are not considered young or girls every year .
they are inter@@ sexual , a group that is suffering from the diagno@@ sis of “ sexual differenti@@ ation dis@@ order ” ( ds@@ d ) , a collective crime concept .

understanding gender identification is still a long way from being developed , but the majority of experts in the us suggest that it is the best available information to help us to identify gender .
the new york psy@@ chi@@ at@@ ris@@ t dr. j@@ ack dres@@ cher , who focuses on the problem of gender identification , said that the new german law “ k@@ ling@@ e for a good cause ” .
inter@@ sexual children are an ethical dil@@ em@@ ma .
“ some people have life@@ -@@ threat@@ ening diseases that require sur@@ g@@ ical intervention , ” says the rapporteur .
you can use gender as@@ sign@@ ment without sur@@ gery and then wait for the identity to develop .
the scientific data on how a child can possibly even develop its gender identity is not very accurate .
no one knows why it is happening .
it is like the secret why people are gay .
in a report to the european commission in 2011 , it says that inter@@ sexual people are excluded from trans@@ sexual or trans@@ gen@@ ic treatment .
these characteristics were reflected in secondary sexual characteristics .
the report also gives an overview of the discrimination that inter@@ sexual and trans@@ gender women face in the work@@ place .
not in line with the gender image , there is now a special camp .
it is now a matter of life and death for adults in australia and ne@@ pal to have male , female or “ third gender ” on official documents .
in june , austr@@ ali@@ an nor@@ ri@@ e ma@@ y-@@ wel@@ by ( 52 ) was the first “ g@@ end@@ er-@@ free ” person in the world after a court had declared the life@@ time of a “ un@@ defined ” gender status .
german pass@@ ports have a future role in the allocation of m and w , x for inter@@ sex@@ u@@ ality , according to the ministry of the interior .
in neighbouring france , gender issues are still controversial .
in 2011 , do@@ z@@ ens of french members of the strictly catho@@ lic country signed a peti@@ tion that the “ gender theory ” of school books should be removed .
the american website catho@@ lic online has also opposed the german law , which has stated that &quot; if the world is in a new state , it will be in a new state where gender is a decision to stop sexual activity , but then for@@ give it .
the mother of a new@@ born from mar@@ y@@ land explained to baby zone that she would find it better if bab@@ ies were born in a sex@@ ually explicit baby .
“ parents are the best people for their family , ” says dr. he@@ in@@ rich sch@@ mit@@ t , director of the association of children of the family .
children need stability and security .
histor@@ ically , children who had been treated with both male and female sex were not treated as children .
ten years ago , medicine looked at gender as something that is not enough to wi@@ pe out and then re@@ build .
but the ethical foundations of an operation are now being ques@@ tioned , as we know how complex gender issues are .
“ in the middle of the 20th century , one was called psy@@ chi@@ at@@ ric emergency , ” dres@@ cher said .
when such a child was born , it was not the psy@@ chi@@ at@@ ris@@ t who was called , but the sur@@ ge@@ on .
the prevail@@ ing theory of tre@@ ating children with un@@ clear gen@@ it@@ als is based on dr john money from jo@@ hn@@ s ho@@ p@@ k@@ ins university .
he co@@ ined the term “ gender identity ” and argu@@ ed that social and environmental issues were in@@ duc@@ ed – as parents had to raise a child – inter@@ ag@@ ger@@ ated with the gen@@ es and hor@@ mon@@ es of a child , and influenced it .
but in a paper published under the title “ john / jo@@ an ” from 197@@ 8 , the number of the@@ ories that he had known was controversial .
he advis@@ ed the parents of a boy whose pen@@ is was in a ple@@ d@@ ged circum@@ ci@@ sion .
“ money presented this case as a successful example of a transformation that was not yet possible . ”
when the boy was about 15 , he swit@@ ched back to the male sex and married a woman .
with 38 but he did commit su@@ ici@@ de .
according to dres@@ cher , there are still doctors who practice this model .
but in the 1990 ’ s , with the adv@@ ent of the internet , survi@@ v@@ ors of these sex operations have come to the public , who “ are not happy with the result . ”
for example , j@@ im bru@@ ce , a 36 year-@@ old author from mon@@ tan@@ a who worked with x@@ y-@@ male ch@@ ro@@ mo@@ som@@ es , but was ambigu@@ ous gen@@ itali@@ a .
the doctors were un@@ clear as to whether he had a large cl@@ it@@ or@@ is or a small pen@@ is , and were convinced that he could never be a “ satisfactory life ” as a man .
so his external body and the hands were taken to the hospital shortly after birth in 197@@ 6 .
at the age of 12 , he received female hor@@ mon@@ es .
“ i knew i was not a girl , ” he explained to ab@@ c@@ news@@ .com that i was a girl .
i was unfortunate , but it was really hard to ask questions .
at the age of 18 , he should be given a v@@ ag@@ inal plastic .
but , as he was de@@ pressed , and knew that something was wrong , he demanded that the world ’ s medical records be brought to bear .
what he found out was sho@@ cking .
i was born ster@@ ili@@ zed – and no one gave me that .
bru@@ ce was born with a ds@@ d through which his body is not enough te@@ sto@@ ster@@ one to develop gen@@ it@@ als .
after knowing the truth , he changed to the male , and he was given te@@ sto@@ ster@@ on-@@ injec@@ tions and let himself be his bre@@ asts removed .
the sur@@ gery has made it inf@@ er@@ tile .
today he is fighting for others in an organization called interface project to make inter@@ sexual people as normal .
but anne tam@@ ar@@ -@@ mat@@ tis , managing director of the california based company , is a very important figure in the field of intellectual property rights .
“ many activi@@ sts are concerned that the german decision may encourage parents to make quick decisions and give the child a “ not specified ” as@@ sign@@ ment , ” she said .
we fear that this will encourage intervention .
we think it would be better to have male or female gender included in the list and then wait .
yet we do not know how the law will affect it , so we can only spec@@ ulate .
tam@@ ar@@ -@@ mat@@ tis said that her organization supports the austr@@ ali@@ an law , because “ it allows adults to be recognised as a third sex . ”
“ adults should be able to make their own decisions about their legal gender ” , he explained .
the german law concerns the allocation of funds to the child at birth .
this is not a fight to which young children can be forced at this time .
if they are grown up , they can decide for themselves about their bodies .
but dr. ar@@ len@@ e bar@@ at@@ z , a bru@@ stra@@ di@@ o@@ log@@ ist from pit@@ ts@@ burg , who was a daughter with a sexual dis@@ order , and has hundreds of others in a self-@@ help group , says that this is the german law .
k@@ ati@@ e , the daughter of bar@@ at@@ z , was born with male ch@@ ro@@ mo@@ som@@ es , but has a ds@@ d named complete and@@ ro@@ gen@@ -@@ resistance .
due to the recep@@ tor failure of the target cells for te@@ sto@@ ster@@ on k@@ ati@@ e developed female characteristics .
she has a v@@ ag@@ ina but no u@@ ter@@ us and no ov@@ aries .
today k@@ ati@@ e 29 and married ; she works on the university of chic@@ ago , california .
it is inf@@ er@@ tile , but hopes to be elimin@@ ated by adoption or sur@@ ro@@ gate mother , though .
“ the law gives parents room to act in ha@@ ste , ” says the president of the court of justice .
it gives you the time to do various tests and to clarify things and gives you the time to do them before they are “ male ” or “ female ” .
this way everything is fine – you pul@@ l the child big and love it .
the hotel is located in the heart of the city , close to the main train station and the main shopping street .
and you do not have to do an operation has@@ ti@@ ly that can no longer be un@@ done .
“ this includes children in the decision and elimin@@ ates the fear that parents are taking over the life of their parents because they believe that they do not do the right thing , ” she explained .
ultimately , the child deci@@ des on sex , which f@@ its better with it – and that is wonderful .
this will enable children to learn to make the decision themselves .
unknown in@@ j@@ ure girls by shot from car
unknown people have been killed by a bul@@ let from a car in sa@@ x@@ on@@ y-@@ an@@ hal@@ t for twelve years .
the perpe@@ tr@@ ators had been arrested in gen@@ e with an air pressure weapon on a group of children on thursday evening .
the police in burg shared this .
the girl is easily attached to the left w@@ ade .
rescue forces brought the girl to hospital .
the shot came from a small car that was attached to a group of six children and suddenly had to stop .
wit@@ nesses saw two people sitting in the car .
the perpe@@ tr@@ ators also shot at a bus stop .
a dis@@ c bro@@ ke .
they then went on to do so .
the criminal police investigate , said it was on friday .
until now , the police inspection k@@ emp@@ ten has been able to stop at a quiet hal@@ lo@@ ween night .
the officials were only elected twice to a working child , who had to defend them against house fac@@ ades .
since home@@ owners recognized this in time and the remains of the same time were removed , no material damage would have been caused .
the city has also been home to several sy@@ l@@ ve@@ ster@@ b@@ ö@@ ller , but also here , no material damage has been caused .
an area of the bis@@ hop friend@@ or@@ fer@@ -@@ way reported that its car was equipped with a st@@ one-@@ wra@@ pped p@@ ad and its whe@@ el@@ -@@ ed@@ ging ap@@ er@@ tures sto@@ len .
until the police arrived , the man has left his whe@@ el@@ ed ap@@ er@@ tures in the immediate vicinity all again , so the police cannot continue to operate .
living with a future
wal@@ tr@@ au@@ d ries is actually living in a dream .
your house is situated in a quiet residential area of stutt@@ gart with lots of green , an old tree population , nice neighbours and not too much traffic .
the city is only a few minutes away by public transport .
&quot; i hope you don &apos;t be afraid of sp@@ id@@ ers ? &quot; , wal@@ tr@@ au@@ d ries as@@ ks and points to a f@@ at sp@@ in@@ ning on the door frame .
i have been looking for a new apartment for my hus@@ band and myself for some time .
but you know how difficult this is in stutt@@ gart .
the reason is not spi@@ der pho@@ bia , but the concern to make the many sta@@ ir@@ cases to the house and the apartment out of the way in old age , explains them .
moreover , since a men@@ is@@ c@@ us operation , the mid@@ d@@ le-@@ aged woman has had to experience at her own body what it means to deal with handic@@ ap from floor to floor .
recently , a book by her has been published on the subject of &apos; happy living in old age - what is the best way of living for me ? &apos; .
&apos;@@ our apartment is the best example of what is not possible in old age &apos; , she begins to tell .
when you started working with your hus@@ band in the ma@@ is@@ on@@ ette apartment more than 20 years ago , it was simply a beautiful apartment in the middle of the green .
today , with the middle of fif@@ ty , wal@@ tr@@ au@@ d re@@ eds thin@@ ks differently .
but she also knows that she is one of the few people who has ever had to deal with the issue of &apos; living in old age &apos; .
most people are ob@@ struc@@ ting it as long as it goes .
the old are always the others &apos; , she says sch@@ mun@@ z@@ el@@ nd .
only when the suffering is really great do we make a thought .
&apos;@@ then it can be too late &apos; , however , is it ?
in her book , interior architec@@ t presents 17 models for self-@@ determined living in old age .
&apos; what type of residence you choose is always an individual decision &apos; , explains it .
d i e solution do not give it for age .
even those who choose reti@@ rement home in tus@@ c@@ any or brit@@ t@@ any can afford to take advantage of the fact that they can also be si@@ ck .
and : &apos; without good knowledge of the national language , the dol@@ ce vit@@ a , &apos; there is no doubt that the author of the book will be willing to consider the possibility of taking out a position .
among their models , classical care models , alternative housing , or the often ci@@ ted reti@@ rement pension fund are found .
at old age , everyone has his own tips and tr@@ ic@@ ks and makes a m@@ ask .
&apos;@@ for me , such a community would not be anything &apos; , she says with a win@@ k .
not even like a student w@@ g with a common bathroom and a kitchen .
&apos;@@ in old age you just need to have your re@@ treat rooms &apos; , she says .
the fact that a senior citizens &apos; housing community can still function does not mean that the author of the book is excluded .
but that would have to be different from the classical student writing programme .
and sometimes you just want to rest , &apos; she believes .
with this view , at least in the capital of the country , it is not alone .
&apos;@@ most old people in stutt@@ gart want to stay away from home as long as it goes , &apos; is also the experience of the@@ res@@ a ru@@ t@@ ten , the head of civil services living at the age of the state capital .
your services advise people around the subject of &apos; getting older &apos; .
that is why the elderly in particular would often find themselves in difficulties and restrictions , just to be able to live in their familiar environment , which is also the experience of the ware@@ housing foundation .
there are many ways of getting the house or apartment accessible without barriers today .
ries recomm@@ ends that all those who are interested in the appropriate renov@@ ation of their house or apartment in the age of 18 should first get a thorough overview and not use the first best cra@@ ft@@ sman .
today there is also a system for the re@@ building of old age specialists .
even in the apartment let one or other reality .
but the existing flat cannot always be adapted to the age and thus accessible , even if it is still as beautiful .
wal@@ tr@@ au@@ d ries had to do that experience .
while the apartment is located in a quiet street , the sta@@ ir@@ lift is also fitted with sta@@ ir@@ cases and is easy to reach .
she will continue to search until she is the ideal object for her and her hus@@ band .
before moving , your car will gra@@ y more than before the spi@@ der at your home .
the us wants to prosecu@@ te snow@@ den further .
the us has changed its position on former us intelligence officer ed@@ ward snow@@ den .
he is still accused of using un@@ authorized secret information .
therefore , it must be subject to criminal proceedings in the united states , as the us secretary of state , j@@ enni@@ fer p@@ sa@@ ki , said in washington .
the recent statements by snow@@ den would not change that either .
previously , the german green politici@@ an han@@ s-@@ christian str@@ ö@@ be@@ le had a meeting with snow@@ den in moscow to discuss the us .
p@@ sa@@ ki emphasi@@ zed that stre@@ tch of the air is a very strong statement by a parliam@@ ent@@ arian , not a german government member .
intelligence en@@ th@@ lers ed@@ ward snow@@ den is generally invited to talk to german authorities .
first , however , he wants to know his situation .
this is what the united states sought from former n@@ sa staff in a non-@@ addressed letter made clear , which the founder of the green party , han@@ s-@@ christian str@@ ö@@ be@@ le , sent on friday after a meeting with snow@@ den , sent to them .
the letter was written after a r@@ ough translation of the following :
i would like to ask the competent authorities to make a request to the relevant authorities .
i have been asked to give you a written reply regarding your inquiry into mass surveillance .
i would like to welcome ed@@ ward joseph snow@@ den and previously was in agreement with the council of ministers and the commission , or as a technical expert directly .
in the course of my work in these institutions , i have witn@@ essed systematic violations of the law by my government , which promp@@ ted me to act on a moral basis .
as a result of the publication of these concerns , i felt comp@@ elled to face a serious and sustained le@@ ver that forced me to leave my family and my home .
i live in ex@@ ile and i enjoy temporary work and i am very happy to see the russian federation grant me under international law .
i am encouraged by the response to my political action , both in the united states and elsewhere .
citizens around the world , and senior officials - including the united states - have been watching the rev@@ el@@ ations to create a system of all-@@ en@@ comp@@ ass@@ ing surveillance that does not hold anyone accoun@@ table .
this es@@ pi@@ on@@ age rev@@ el@@ ations brought many proposals for new laws and directives , which are based on the previously conce@@ aled abuse of public confidence in the eu .
the benefits to society from these knowledge are clear .
although the outcome of my efforts has been demonstr@@ ably positive , my government continues to treat dis@@ sent as a breach of trust and seeks to secure political expression .
nevertheless , to speak the truth is not a crime .
i am confident that the united states government , with the support of the international community , will be able to put this negative attitude to the fore .
i hope that when the difficulties of this humanitarian situation are resolved , i will be able to speak to the commission &apos;s responsible en@@ ligh@@ ten@@ ment of the situation regarding the media activities .
i look forward to a meeting with you in your country as soon as the situation has been clari@@ fied and thank you for your efforts to respect international law , which protec@@ ts us all .
ed@@ ward snow@@ den testi@@ fies to han@@ s-@@ christian str@@ ö@@ be@@ le ’ s work in the “ k@@ ul@@ tur@@ plan@@ ner ” .

the former nur@@ ser@@ y in the garden street has been handed over to a private person .
the association of the municip@@ al council approved the sale in its most recent meeting in the non-@@ public part .
the building changed its owner to a &quot; reasonable &quot; price .
&quot; the municip@@ ality is satisfied &quot; , emphasi@@ zes ma@@ i@@ er .

it is not yet clear how the new owner will use the former kin@@ der@@ gar@@ ten .

report : obama ’ s campaign considered replac@@ ing bi@@ den with h@@ ill@@ ary clin@@ ton .
the clo@@ s@@ est advis@@ ers to president bar@@ ack obama have secre@@ tly considered becoming vice president jo@@ e bi@@ den in the 2012 election campaign by h@@ ill@@ ary clin@@ ton , so the new york times said .
the rev@@ el@@ ation is the most remarkable surprise of the long awa@@ ited workshop .
the times is a copy of the upcoming issue of the book , and it also reported that on thursday afternoon , the book was published by the top advis@@ ers of the president , “ extensive group meetings and surve@@ ys at the end of 2011 . ”
according to jon@@ a@@ than martin , national political correspon@@ dent of times , the book presents a thorough account of the history of efforts by leading campaign and white house officials to bring about a change in the former white house chief .
the potential change was a strictly guar@@ ded secret of the world ’ s campaign infrastructure .
only half a do@@ zen of clo@@ s@@ est presidential advis@@ ers – including d@@ al@@ ey , the former campaign leader obama , j@@ im mess@@ ina , and former chief executive advis@@ er of the white house , david ax@@ el@@ ro@@ d , and david .
in double down , it is claimed that d@@ ale has been at the fore@@ front of efforts to keep bi@@ den alive despite their “ close , personal relationship . ”
in an interview with martin , dal@@ y confirmed that the government was indeed considering whether to take bi@@ den by clin@@ ton .
“ i expressed a whole series of things that could be considered , but i did not say that , ” he said .
it is worth re@@ member@@ ing that the president then had terrible po@@ ll figures , that is , we thought : ‘ for god ’ s sake , what do we do ? ’
while dal@@ ey was the &quot; due d@@ ili@@ gence &quot; of the investigations , martin said to an@@ der@@ son co@@ op@@ er of c@@ n@@ n that during the campaign for re-@@ election considerable effort had been made to find out what was going on .
“ campaigns do not spend as much money on po@@ lls and focus groups , when they do not think seriously about something ” , he said on ac@@ 3@@ 60 .
it is not clear , however , whether obama knew that his team would have an exchange .
martin said to c@@ n@@ n , he asked dal@@ ey whether his then bo@@ ss had been informed about the potential change .
although dal@@ ey said he does not believe that the president of the possible change is “ aware ” , the former president of the stable said that there was “ possible ” .
martin added that “ double down ” is not a defini@@ tive answer to the question of whether the new political son@@ d@@ ages will be obama ’ s desk .
co@@ op@@ er asked martin if he really think obama has not heard of the investigations about how the us government could buy bi@@ ds in the elections .
“ possible , ” martin rep@@ lied .
what happens to my email ?
e-mail actually means electronic letters .
has been sent in the design of the internet service email as in the case of conventional mail techn@@ ically the secret letter ?
when design@@ ing early internet services , the emphasis was on making communication possible .
that is why , in the basic technical proto@@ col@@ s , no attention was paid to establishing a solid foundation for a hearing of safe correspon@@ dence .
therefore , a conventional e-mail correspon@@ ds more to an open post@@ card than to a se@@ aled letter .
if the user is interested in &quot; anna &quot; to &quot; ben@@ ni &quot; , the hosts of the two then are directly connected ?
the email program or the browser of anna sen@@ ds in the first step the mail to the mail server of your service provider .
for example , if you have a g@@ mail account , google would be .
this mail server sen@@ ds the content to the provider , the ben@@ ni uses .
the route can be extended by several other servers on the internet .
ben@@ ni@@ e can then send the content to his provider .
if conventional e-@@ ma@@ ils are sent through the network ?
most ma@@ ils are sent multiple times by software robo@@ ts on the go .
the sen@@ der &apos;s provider is usually checked to see if the mail is a mal@@ icious program .
the recei@@ ver systems also have a virus chec@@ k@@ box .
the providers also check whether the service is a cum@@ ber@@ some and un@@ wanted sp@@ am mail .
if the robo@@ ts have another task ?
on systems such as g@@ mail , the robo@@ t will also determine the information google needs to place context advertising .
if anna and ben@@ ni are informed by g@@ mail about your next holiday , google may provide links to holiday offers .
read also unknown people who have em@@ ail@@ s with ?
the prob@@ ability that un@@ authorized persons will read a mail is extremely low .
in theory , however , this is possible .
in companies , administr@@ ators often have the opportunity to read electronic mail .
law enforcement agencies and secret services have also been given legal opportunities to inter@@ cep@@ t or notice e-@@ ma@@ ils .
in addition , there are possible illegal expres@@ sions .
is it possible to send e-@@ ma@@ ils against reading ?
with encry@@ ption after the open@@ p@@ g@@ p standard , an e-mail can be effectively encry@@ p@@ ted against reading .
with a high level of technical effort , it is also possible to dis@@ gu@@ ise the met@@ ad@@ ata of e-mail communication , so that it is not even easy to identify who communic@@ ated with whom .
how important are y@@ a@@ ho@@ o and google on the email market in germany ?
the most commonly used mail@@ boxes are y@@ a@@ ho@@ o and google , according to a survey by con@@ vi@@ os consulting , from august 2013 , only play a minor role .
while y@@ a@@ ho@@ o mail &apos;s share was last dec@@ lined , g@@ mail from google could significantly increase .
mother in the forest dis@@ car@@ ded and reti@@ red
when his be@@ ta@@ zed mother died , a man from wol@@ f@@ sburg for@@ ged a plan .
he gave the dead in a forest - and cas@@ hed the dead in a forest and continued to pay for their pensions and care allow@@ ances .
to continue to provide pensions and care allow@@ ances , the commission has proposed a 6@@ 7-@@ year-@@ old wol@@ f@@ sburg to leave his dead mother after an investigation by the police in the forest .
first , he had the death of the 8@@ 9-@@ year-@@ old , then he had to pay the money for more than a year and a half .
now the 6@@ 7-@@ year-@@ old must be held responsible for fraud , as a speaker said on friday .
so the man hi@@ d the woman in a forest near the hel@@ m@@ ste@@ dt .
the susp@@ ici@@ on was already in may : at that time , it was discovered that there was a risk of the mother being left with medic@@ ation .
investig@@ ators told the pen@@ sion@@ er that his mother was sent to spain .
because the officials are cur@@ ious about this , they further investig@@ ated .
it emerged that the two had been working in a common flat for more than 15 years and he was last ca@@ red for .
i was a 6@@ 7-@@ year-@@ old who finally ad@@ mitted the death of his mother .
an ob@@ duc@@ tion , according to the police , did not show any evidence of a capital crime .
want to use ice cre@@ am , which is lit in the dark ?
a british entreprene@@ ur has been the first in the dark sh@@ ining ice – using qu@@ al@@ ms .
char@@ lie franc@@ is made the flu@@ o@@ res@@ cent properties of the sea est@@ ers to benefit from and created a new kind of lu@@ min@@ ous delic@@ acy .
the idea came to him after carrying out a research on j@@ ell@@ y@@ fish and persu@@ ading chinese scientists to use the bright prote@@ in arti@@ fici@@ ally .
the ice cre@@ am re@@ acts to the skin when consum@@ ed , thus reducing the ph value in the prote@@ in and preventing the light from being released .
chr@@ is explains that the ice cre@@ am respon@@ ds to the war@@ m@@ th in his mouth and lu@@ min@@ ates – the more you lic@@ k , the bri@@ ghter it becomes .
char@@ lie , founder of the ice cre@@ am company &quot; lic@@ k me i &apos;m delicious &quot; , says : &quot; the product is incredible , it &apos;s still in a very early production phase .
the ice cre@@ am is used in the re@@ actions with the ton@@ gue when a neutral ph value is applied .
if the mouth is the prote@@ in war@@ med , the ph value increases and the ice is sh@@ ining .
we have seen it over the last few months and it seemed ideal to pass it on hal@@ lo@@ ween to the market .
it is probably the most expensive ice cre@@ am i have ever produced , because the j@@ ell@@ y@@ fish is four times t@@ ough@@ er than gold .
every ball costs me about 1@@ 40 p@@ ounds .
but it tas@@ tes delicious for that .
char@@ lie experim@@ ental company based in bri@@ st@@ ol is famous for its un@@ common and unusual taste .
but his latest creation is to be even more ambitious .
he says , ‘ i would like to see an invi@@ sible ice cre@@ am ’ .
this is impossible in itself because of the re@@ fr@@ active light caused by the ice cryst@@ als .
the ice cre@@ am uses flu@@ o@@ res@@ cent properties of a j@@ ell@@ y@@ fish , which is arti@@ fici@@ ally manufactured by chinese scientists .
ts@@ v mor@@ sum is the first german football league to be held in the world cup in 2010 after six days of play .
it is now precisely this that the ing@@ o e@@ h@@ lers team will be voting tomorrow against the ts@@ v da@@ ver@@ den , who was held last weekend his first victory .
this game starts the season for us .
&quot; i hope that we finally get our head free , &quot; e@@ h@@ ler &apos;s behavior is optim@@ istic .
he has finally , except for permanent in@@ ju@@ red h@@ end@@ ri@@ k blo@@ h@@ me , lost his complete cad@@ re .
da@@ ver@@ den , like us , reli@@ es on speed play .
we must therefore reduce our error rate .
first of all , however , we must increase the coverage that , at the end of the day , has left anything but a certain impression .
the best way to relax is to visit da@@ ver@@ den ’ s co@@ ach thomas pan@@ it@@ z after the first season ’ s victory against n@@ ord@@ hor@@ n .
the game was , of course , a house number .
but that is why we are far from being the favorite , because in der@@ by everything can always happen .
however , pan@@ it@@ z now wants to make a mo@@ ck@@ ery in mor@@ sum to start a series .
the absence of jan@@ -@@ mal@@ te jo@@ d@@ at .
the a-@@ ju@@ g@@ end@@ lic@@ he jo@@ o@@ st wind@@ swe@@ ß , who has a double playing right at the a-@@ ju@@ g@@ end@@ -@@ bun@@ des@@ lig@@ a league , is celebr@@ ating his season de@@ but .
if you don &apos;t have such a game , you should stay at home .
hal@@ lo@@ ween 2013 : in figures , the world ’ s most famous summer holiday in the world is in fact the “ real ” : in figures , the world ’ s biggest in the world is not the “ real ” of the year .
when i was small , hal@@ lo@@ ween had a magic .
my si@@ ster and i could not eat s@@ wee@@ ts late and let us take care of the neighbourhood .
today i am more inc@@ lined to hal@@ lo@@ ween .
over the last two years , i have not agreed to move from my home to s@@ wee@@ ts , and i will probably not do so this year either .
but , according to statistics , i am a black she@@ ep , as far as hal@@ lo@@ ween is concerned .
the majority of americans – 15@@ 8 million , to be precise – celebrate this year ’ s hal@@ lo@@ ween celebr@@ ation with a total of $ 6.@@ 9 billion for s@@ wee@@ ts , cost@@ umes , and decor@@ ations , according to the american association .
one thing i have to focus on every hal@@ lo@@ ween then is the fact that the trend values are .
the cost@@ umes will be about 1.@@ 2 billion of the 6.@@ 9 billion u.s. dollars spent , so the n@@ r@@ f .
this year are exciting un@@ fa@@ th@@ om@@ able items the last cr@@ y .
women no longer have to be dres@@ sed in sex@@ y clothes , they can now also enjoy se@@ duc@@ tive food such as piz@@ za , ham@@ bur@@ gers or car@@ ro@@ ts .
as far as men are concerned , i expect lots of z@@ om@@ b@@ ies thanks to the walking dead , and i bet the d@@ af@@ t-@@ pun@@ k space man will be this year in the inc@@ a race .
according to google , the most popular cost@@ umes are z@@ om@@ b@@ ies , bat@@ man , pi@@ rates , and wit@@ ches .
i susp@@ ect that there is nothing wrong with tradition .
last year we opened our dogs and we were very happy with it .
indeed , americans spend $ 3@@ 30 million this year on co@@ stu@@ me of their pe@@ ts , according to the n@@ r@@ f .
these are a lot of hot dogs .
as for s@@ wee@@ ts , we are not squ@@ e@@ am@@ ish .
americans will be spending $ 1.@@ 9 billion this year , according to the ni@@ el@@ sen company .
that is about 2@@ 70 million kil@@ o@@ gram@@ s of chocolate , lo@@ a@@ thing , s@@ wee@@ ts and rub@@ ber@@ co@@ cks .
so good news for the us department of trade , which has sent 41 million people to the tun@@ e of “ sweet or s@@ our ” .
in fact , we will be producing more than 40 million kil@@ o@@ gram@@ s of chocolate and , let us not dec@@ ei@@ ve ourselves , eat .
the only thing we do not want to con@@ sume is the su@@ gar@@ -@@ sweet c@@ and@@ y cor@@ n ; yet 15 million kil@@ o@@ gram@@ s of it are sold by hal@@ lo@@ ween , according to the national association of conf@@ ec@@ tion@@ ery producers .
that is about nine billion gra@@ ins of ma@@ ize .
it is a myster@@ y that i have not yet been able to solve .
nothing is more to hal@@ lo@@ ween than houses where there is a sp@@ ice .
they have great names like “ terror ” , “ the wall ” ( which is also in a real prison ) , and “ ho@@ w@@ l-@@ o-@@ scre@@ am ” , and “ the house of sho@@ ck ” .
there are , in fact , 1,@@ 200 officially recognised sp@@ uc@@ k@@ houses in the united states , which earn $ 500 million , according to america ha@@ un@@ ts , and that includes the wonderful photos that the us is currently taking .
but let us finally come to the shor@@ ts .
char@@ lie brown made us a little bit familiar with the big pum@@ p@@ k@@ in when we were children , and the cutting of a pum@@ p@@ k@@ in lan@@ ter@@ n is like decor@@ ating the christmas tree – something we have made from a small age .
fortunately , the “ baby in the pum@@ p@@ k@@ in ” trend began only last year thanks to p@@ inte@@ st , so most of us have grown up to take the pum@@ p@@ k@@ in and not to fall into it .
this year , americans will spend about $ 10@@ 6 million on shor@@ ten@@ ing , according to the us cen@@ sus bureau .
the pum@@ p@@ k@@ in l@@ amps , slowly ro@@ tting in the front garden , are probably from il@@ lin@@ o@@ is , where this year 2@@ 45 million kil@@ o@@ gram@@ s of pum@@ p@@ k@@ in were har@@ ves@@ ted .
if you want to score points , call ti@@ m and sus@@ an ma@@ th@@ is@@ don in nap@@ a , california and cut the car@@ t a little bit .
apartment fire in hel@@ bre@@ cht : rescue forces are be@@ sto@@ wing coal bar@@ re@@ ls of cor@@ p@@ ses and the fire is being bur@@ ned down .
the fire bri@@ g@@ ade had to leave in hel@@ m@@ bre@@ cht late thursday evening .
a three-@@ family house in the district of hof begins in the night for friday fire .
the rescue forces are responsible for a co@@ iled body from the house .
rescue workers have lost their jobs in a fire in hel@@ bre@@ cht .
whether it is a occup@@ ant handle is still un@@ clear as a spo@@ kes@@ man of the police in bay@@ re@@ u@@ th said .
on late thursday evening , the earth@@ qua@@ ke in the house had bur@@ ned .
when the fire bri@@ g@@ ade arrived , the fl@@ ames already swe@@ pt out of a window .
the forces of intervention went into the apartment and found the cor@@ pse in a room .
this and one more room bur@@ ned out completely .
the entire ground floor has been damaged .
all other inhabitants were not too at home during the fire , the police spo@@ kes@@ man continued to explain .
the building was not in@@ hab@@ itable for the time being .
the exact cause of the fire was not clear at first .
germany ’ s largest church of the country has launched an off@@ ensive to promote the occupation of the pa@@ stor@@ al .
background is a possible par@@ ish short@@ age : the ev@@ angel@@ ic@@ -@@ lu@@ ther@@ an church of the state han@@ over exp@@ ects to be in a state of decline of approximately 1,@@ 800 pa@@ stor@@ alists and pa@@ st@@ ors .
for today ’ s young people , the profes@@ sion is very attractive and offers good prospects , said pa@@ st@@ or ma@@ this bur@@ fi@@ en ( 43 ) talking to the ev@@ angel@@ ical press service .
it is attractive to reduce the work@@ load and the daily work@@ load .
with bur@@ fi@@ a , the district church has for the first time opened a pa@@ st@@ or in a full place to attract young people to study the@@ ology .
at present , fewer and fewer young people are choosing to study the@@ ology after gradu@@ ation .
bur@@ fi@@ a is leading this to the process of dec@@ ep@@ tion : &quot; god &apos;s voice is quiet , the world is lou@@ dly &quot; .
the profes@@ sion of great freedom and diversity is the h@@ all@@ mark of this profes@@ sion .
i am mr of my calendar and can i set my priorities where it is important for me .
pa@@ st@@ ors could be very close to the people as pa@@ st@@ ors .
they earned as much as teachers , and could well live off it .
certainly , more money is paid in the free economy , but the@@ o@@ logi@@ ans would have a safe employ@@ er for that .
this will benefit today &apos;s young people , who are not only concerned with care@@ ers , but also with a work that is full of ideas .
according to the national church , which is located three quarters of lower sa@@ x@@ ony , about 60 p@@ esti@@ ci@@ des are currently reti@@ ring each year .
at the same time , some 40 gradu@@ ates of a the@@ ology studies begin their vi@@ k@@ ari@@ at .
in spar@@ sely popu@@ lated periph@@ eral areas such as res@@ in , em@@ s@@ land or w@@ end@@ land , it may be difficult to find jobs in the future .
bur@@ fi@@ en wants to organize , among other things , study days for young people and invite cele@@ bri@@ ties to study the@@ ology .
the the@@ ology studies offer a broad education .
it can even become the president of the federal republic .

fire bri@@ g@@ ade to save a bit@@ ch called the &quot; dog &quot; , which is 15 meters above the ground on a dangerous rock edge in a quar@@ ry .
co@@ ck@@ er@@ sp@@ ani@@ el bit@@ ch ru@@ by was born after a minor road accident .
three days later , she was taken by a wal@@ ker in the quar@@ ry in her un@@ pleasant location .
fire@@ figh@@ ters ro@@ lled on the cli@@ ff wall and saved the dog from the safe stor@@ m .
the fire bri@@ g@@ ade managed to get a bit@@ ch safe@@ ly , which was on a 15@@ -@@ metr@@ e high lead in a ro@@ cky wall .
the nine months old co@@ ck@@ er@@ sp@@ ani@@ el bit@@ ch ru@@ by was born after a road accident on sunday afternoon and passed away in the village alone for three days before she died on wednesday .
scot@@ t al@@ der@@ son , 25 , and his gir@@ l@@ friend bec@@ ky hall , 20 , who was the dog , came to the quar@@ ry of fla@@ pp@@ it in den@@ hol@@ me , west yor@@ k@@ sh@@ ire to see ru@@ by again .
they had desper@@ ately asked for their missing female .
around 14 : 15 on wednesday , a walk around the city looked like a dog .
the technical rescue team of cle@@ ck@@ he@@ at@@ on fire station ei@@ ght@@ te was in the position of ro@@ lled out to rescue ru@@ br@@ y .
and@@ y cla@@ y@@ ton , specialist in the technical rescue team , said : “ you were in a dangerous situation , ” he said .
it was in the middle of the cli@@ ff – 15 meters from the top and the ground .
she did not move mus@@ cle during her rescue – she was like sti@@ ff fro@@ zen .
but now it is doing well .
she then took a few dog ca@@ kes and was very happy to have them .
that was a rather unusual effort .
the fact that the dog was discovered is incredible .
peter la@@ u , specialist in the technical rescue team , said : “ ru@@ by had a giant team of people . ”
there was a possibility that they were seriously in@@ ju@@ red or worse .
ru@@ by was declared a veter@@ in@@ arian , but he was not exhaus@@ ted and de@@ hy@@ dr@@ ation .
bec@@ ky hall from h@@ ali@@ fax , west yor@@ k@@ sh@@ ire , said : “ the rescue is watching us go out of the water . ”
i could not believe that they really was up there .
it was wonderful to see them again in the poor .
the ve@@ t explained that if exhaus@@ tion became too large and collap@@ sed , it would have been pre@@ sum@@ ably cr@@ ash@@ ed .
the fire@@ figh@@ ters have done a great job .
it was really cour@@ ageous what you did .
we are so grateful and each of you was absolutely incredible .
scot@@ t al@@ der@@ son from ke@@ gh@@ ley added : “ we had been afraid that they would fall , but we were not able to do so . ”
the fire figh@@ ters were great .
i can hardly believe where it was .
mic@@ k j@@ ag@@ ger says he has never told kat@@ y per@@ ry when she was 18 .
in an interview with an austr@@ ali@@ an radio station this week , the pop star said that she had been a background sing@@ er at hun@@ ting s@@ ings song “ old hab@@ its the hard ” from the year 2004 .
per@@ ry explained that she had been working with the al@@ tro@@ ck@@ er to dinner , and that “ he has bag@@ ged me when i was 18 . ”
she added : “ that ’ s been a long time ago and he was very kind to me . ”
in a statement , a representative of j@@ ag@@ gers , 70 , said on thursday that he was ‘ categ@@ or@@ ically against ever trying to bring kat@@ y per@@ ry closer together ’ .

george ke@@ rev@@ an : european un@@ bun@@ d@@ ling gives sco@@ ts the choice of being the scot@@ tish choice .
a new day , a new story of terror about independence .
this time we are war@@ ned that an independent scot@@ tish is required to be able to join the schengen area as a condition for eu membership .
this is the key word for stories about pass@@ port controls in ber@@ w@@ ick and a story with bar@@ bed wire .
indeed , the stra@@ th@@ cl@@ y@@ de template refers to the potential economic benefits that more travel freedom can bring to the rest of europe .
nor has anyone mentioned that eu member states often want to ab@@ ide by their strict rules when it comes to making it more favourable to them .
as scotland is not currently part of the schengen area , the continued non-@@ compliance with the treaty would be a small conc@@ ession for brussels in exchange for what we have really heard from the sco@@ ts .
so actually no story .
and one that has been in the years that it has already been subjec@@ ted to a fo@@ ssi@@ l : the first time i have called the “ independence means pass@@ port control ” -@@ ente at least 40 years ago .
an interesting point is the constant repe@@ ti@@ tion of this ancient history .
why should an independent scotland be expected to be able to do so under the european pi@@ pe ?
why the london yo@@ ke against the brussels embar@@ go is particularly dangerous now ?
these are the real european news : the great , post-@@ war , plan to un@@ ite europe has st@@ alled .
the euro crisis has officially launched the european project .
across the eu , parties are gaining ground that are ho@@ sti@@ le to the eu or that are seeking to throw the euro over@@ board as a common currency .
even in germany , the euro@@ s@@ cep@@ tic party could not support alternative for germany – only this year – almost five million votes in the bun@@ de@@ sta@@ g election in september , effectively under@@ mining free democrats ( the equivalent of the german constitution ) .
there have always been domestic opposition to the plan to create a federal europe .
the current economic crisis , however , turns out to be a turning point .
because of the financial crisis imposed by berlin and the european central bank , in connection with the stra@@ it@@ jack@@ et in which the national economy is being pen@@ alised by stic@@ king to the single currency , many people are of the opinion that the project is far .
the crisis in the euro has little to do with the fact that national governments are causing excessive budget deficits – that was only the case in greece .
instead , the euro@@ system has focused its members on exchange rates , which are very important for german ex@@ porters – and we want german politicians to leave that as they are .
without the possibility of de@@ valu@@ ing the local currency , southern europe will find itself with an integrated productivity dis@@ advantage over germany .
the only way to do this is to cut wages and public spending – inspired by berlin .
behind the current budget and monetary problems lies a deep and profound problem in europe ’ s productivity .
as a result of the green policies imposed by brussels , the energy directive – a code for subsidi@@ zing french energy and german energy companies on the expense of consumers – the european industry is paying a high price compared to the united states .
this is a cri@@ p@@ pling cost , as we have already seen in gran@@ em@@ ou@@ th .
all the world ’ s wage fix@@ tures protect the european petro@@ chemical industry from being dependent on cheap american sh@@ ale gas .
as a result , a re@@ vol@@ t is rising , especially in france , the former che@@ er@@ leader of the eu .
after the war , france ’ s political elite saw the eu as a vehicle to use the eu to help germany .
but berlin no longer needs paris as a ga@@ te@@ way to political legitimacy , and has thro@@ wn europe back on its own economic policies , which is what the strugg@@ ling french economy is strugg@@ ling with .
the result : marine le p@@ ens right-@@ wing eu enemy forces have been bloc@@ ked by a very significant second round , and thus the ruling socialists have been put in third place .
the national front is now the most popular party in france , with 24 % of the vote – a timely warning to the british labour government .
what makes le pen so popular with its newly won popul@@ arity among the white french working class ?
it wants to hold next year &apos;s eu elections to an anti-@@ eu , anti-@@ community monetary blo@@ c in the european parliament .
if the anti-@@ eu parties were to do well in these elections – and this is very possible – the first such blo@@ c could undermine the european parliament .
this is the point i want to make : in the not too dist@@ ant future , the growing res@@ ent@@ ment of the eu and the single currency will be combined to abol@@ ish the euro .
the eu will not dis@@ appear , but it will be more like a “ europe of ( sovereign ) nations . ”
germany and some of its satellite economies may hold on to the euro , but france and southern europe will be forced to return to their own curren@@ cies .
i expect britain to distance itself from this project in the hope of being able to join the united states .
but washington ’ s growing interest in the pacific region suggests that the united kingdom alone will be the world ’ s only rain .
where is scotland with all this ?
we can decide to create a region of ( ultimately ) small england .
or we can defend our own economic interests – including berlin and brussels – and we can defend them wherever they go .
i susp@@ ect that scotland could be in a loo@@ ser european union .
cooperation with other similar countries is in a non-@@ federal state .
otherwise , we should consider making norway the same and making our economic independence .
the sn@@ p government in scotland is – remark@@ ably – a leader of the most successful political movement against the au@@ ster@@ ity policies in europe , and has played a spectacular majority in 2011 , owing to the rejection of the proposed ( and implemented ) cuts .
it would be ri@@ dic@@ ulous for scotland to op@@ t for independence now , just to be removed from berlin and brussels by au@@ ster@@ ity .
early pub@@ er@@ ty : the early growth of the population is faster than early pub@@ er@@ ty : it is faster to grow up .
a@@ fro@@ -@@ american and h@@ is@@ pan@@ ic girls tend to reach pub@@ er@@ ty rather than their white sen@@ ses , as studies show .
physical changes do not mean directly pub@@ er@@ ty , but rather the physical changes of the body .
there is no evidence that hor@@ mon@@ es or other chemicals are responsible .
experts believe that the ep@@ ide@@ mic ob@@ es@@ ity is a tri@@ gger for early pub@@ er@@ ty .
the trend towards early pub@@ er@@ ty is less pron@@ oun@@ ced in young people .
the former c@@ n@@ n correspon@@ dent p@@ at e@@ ther@@ id@@ ge is a journ@@ alist who has been focusing on child health and family issues .
if a mother is wor@@ ried if her daughter is already at the age of seven or eight years bre@@ asts and sh@@ am@@ po@@ os grow ?
at the annual conference of the children ’ s medical association american academy of peace , the children ’ s medical association held this week in or@@ lan@@ do , fl@@ ori@@ da , the pa@@ edi@@ at@@ ric en@@ do@@ cr@@ in@@ o@@ log@@ ist paul k@@ ap@@ lo@@ ge declared that he was relatively un@@ o@@ log@@ ist paul k@@ ap@@ lo@@ ge .
&quot; i spend a lot of time re@@ ass@@ uring parents – usually the only thing that does not indicate that they are now quickly getting into pub@@ er@@ ty , &quot; explained k@@ ap@@ lo@@ wit@@ z .
obvious advertis@@ ements of the development , such as growing bre@@ asts , sh@@ am@@ po@@ o and ar@@ mp@@ it hair , as well as body od@@ or , show themselves earlier in girls .
however , there was only a s@@ light shift in the age of the men@@ ar@@ k ( appearance of the first rule ble@@ eding ) over the last 40 years .
in the united states , the average age is 12.@@ 5 years , slightly less than 12.@@ 75 in the 197@@ 0 ’ s .
“ if the development of the bre@@ asts begins , it takes at least two to three years to reach the men@@ ar@@ che , ” said k@@ ap@@ lo@@ wit@@ z , also author of the book “ early pub@@ er@@ ty at girls : the essential advis@@ or .
time is the most accurate test of how to advance pub@@ er@@ ty .
it is controversial what actually marks the beginning of pub@@ er@@ ty , but we must “ start early ” the process when the bre@@ ast size is not affected by a growth boost before an age of eight years .
in most cases , the pace of the process or stag@@ n@@ ating – something that a child ’ s doctor can monitor closely .
if the progress is faster , tests could be replaced by an en@@ di@@ k@@ ron@@ o@@ log@@ ist to avoid serious problems such as t@@ um@@ ors or cy@@ sts .
there are treatment methods for dela@@ ying early men@@ stru@@ ation and dis@@ cour@@ aging another consequence : the pre@@ mature use of ag@@ eing of b@@ ones , ul@@ ti@@ ma@@ tive to growth barriers .
the recommendations for a medic@@ inal or hor@@ mon@@ al therapy are based on age of the child , age of development , age of growth and the emo@@ tional nature of the patient .
psycho@@ social aspects are also important .
k@@ ap@@ lo@@ wit@@ z is cau@@ tious about drugs , but he does give that : “ the sup@@ pression of the pub@@ er@@ ty can cause behavi@@ oral problems and feel@@ ings of girls who are not like their age colleagues . ”
the other major problem is understand@@ able : parents simply do not want their very young dau@@ gh@@ ters to have the period .
“ they worry about abor@@ tion risk or about how to treat the hy@@ gen@@ ic condition of the child , ” said ka@@ p@@ lo@@ wit@@ z .
“ it was a sho@@ ck , ” rec@@ alls a woman whose daughter , at ten , had been given her days .
although there were initial signs and we were talking about men@@ stru@@ ation , it was not emo@@ tionally prepared .
she came fri@@ ghten@@ ed and ex@@ ci@@ ted from school home , because she had the first in her friend &apos;s life .
there are many widely published the@@ ories about the causes of early putin ’ s pub@@ er@@ ty .
but there is no conclu@@ sive evidence that the hor@@ m@@ one in mil@@ k-@@ based milk or other foods , chemicals , is a serious threat to the environment or to sexual messages in the media .
bo@@ ys come to the pu@@ ber@@ ty in a similar way to girls .
k@@ ap@@ lo@@ wit@@ z believes that the most comp@@ elling pre@@ mise is the ep@@ ide@@ mic of ob@@ es@@ ity .
he supported the implementation of a study in 2001 on girls aged six to nine years old who had a link between body f@@ at and entry into the pub@@ er@@ ty .
other studies support this conclusion , but there are many other factors that require a role .
in this country , afric@@ an-@@ american and h@@ is@@ pan@@ ic girls tend to reach pub@@ er@@ ty rather than their white age com@@ r@@ ades .
there are different explanations for this .
glob@@ ally , early pub@@ er@@ ty seems to have influenced all sor@@ ts of things , from economic conditions to the climate to gen@@ es .
another pu@@ zz@@ le : although bo@@ ys have the fac@@ ial and sh@@ am@@ po@@ o hair growth earlier , the trend towards full-@@ blo@@ wn hair growth has been rever@@ sed .
other doctors on the a@@ ap conference highlighted the complexity of the issue and highlighted the importance of the issue .
the emerg@@ ence of ac@@ ne and sh@@ am@@ hair is even more common in bab@@ ies and inf@@ ants .
“ we must be careful how we know the real beginning of pub@@ er@@ ty , ” said dr. law@@ ren@@ ce sil@@ ver@@ man , a pa@@ edi@@ at@@ ric teacher of the university of vienna .
parents should not hesitate to let their pedi@@ at@@ r@@ ici@@ an advise on how to communicate with their child .
“ this can mean that you can have a meeting earlier than expected , ” ri@@ et k@@ ap@@ lo@@ wit@@ z .
if you stay calm , the child usually re@@ acts well .
girls who blo@@ om early need the insurance to help the process become a normal part of life , even if they used to be thought .
jum@@ bo manufacturers are argu@@ ing against the world ’ s leading manufacturers in the face of large orders over seat width and di@@ stances .
there is a clear distinction between leading aircraft manufacturers over the wide se@@ ating in the tourist class at long distance flights .
the dispute is about the seat width , the pass@@ port for long flights , in the tourist industry , and the number of passengers in the cab@@ in .
airbus this week called for a standard of industry that includes a seat width of at least 46 cm ( 18 in@@ ches ) in the tourist class .
the debate comes at a time when aircraft construction is asking for it .
like the re@@ ar part of the aircraft is designed – especially if it is ro@@ ws with nine or ten seats – it is crucial for the economic results indicated , which the new “ mini jum@@ bo ” model will deliver .
bo@@ eing claims that its moder@@ ni@@ zed “ 7@@ 7@@ 7@@ x ” bar@@ re@@ l will hold 4@@ 06 people sitting in the tourist class , which has 17 in@@ ches wide and thus 10 per row .
airbus decla@@ res that the compe@@ ting a3@@ 50 aircraft will be delivered to 3@@ 50 passengers in 18 in@@ ches wide seats in the tourist class , with nine per row .
aircraft gi@@ ants often share the same view of technical details through advertising in the technical press .
now , before the du@@ ba@@ i air@@ show , where the 7@@ 7@@ x was the first to be delivered with more than 100 orders , airbus is calling directly on the public .
recently , the company presented an ad that marked the beginning of a new ad war and could provide don@@ ors with a picture showing three people ga@@ thering .
&quot; bo@@ eing be@@ ats long-@@ hau@@ l flights in seats that are more ti@@ ghter than regional tur@@ bo pro@@ ps , &quot; says airbus sales ch@@ ef john lea@@ h@@ y .
given the changing di@@ etary hab@@ its , people become th@@ ick@@ er , but aircraft seats have not rad@@ ically changed .
between the early 197@@ 0 ’ s , when the bo@@ eing 7@@ 47 was the most modern long-@@ distance journey , and the end of the century , the weight of the male average american between 40 and 49 years increased by 10 % .
the wa@@ ist size of the male average american in the 21st century is , according to us health statistics , 10@@ 0.@@ 8 cm .
airbus says its ri@@ val is keeping to a seat concept from the 195@@ 0s , when the average passenger comfort was about 30 % higher than the average body size of the newly b@@ ap@@ tiz@@ ed “ jet set ” .
the airbus said that there have been investigations , which have shown that an additional customs duty ( 2.@@ 5@@ 4 cm ) per seat would reduce the quality of sleep by 53 % .
bo@@ eing den@@ ies the numbers of airbus to the se@@ ated and says it is not in the discre@@ tion of the manufacturers to decide how airlines will use the balance between air fa@@ res and equipment .
the company also states , according to research , that the experience in the aircraft is greater than the seat width .
“ it really amounts to giving airlines flexibility , so that they can do what they want to do , ” said the rapporteur .
they do not want us to dict@@ ate to them what they make prof@@ itable .
you know your business better than anyone .
for passengers , it is about more el@@ bo@@ w freedom , but it will become increasingly difficult for manufacturers to deal with the issue of sales .
behind the fight is a race to order aircraft with an estimated volume of at least $ 700 billion to list prices in the coming decades , which is reflected in a sustainable impact on the us or europe ’ s export balance .
as re@@ u@@ ters reported for the first time in july , the layout of the seat is the driving force behind the battle over the new aircraft .
both airbus and bo@@ eing claim 20 percent more efficiency per seat at their latest tw@@ in-@@ engine long-@@ hau@@ l design .
the statements by bo@@ eing on the results are partly based on the fact that the 7@@ 7@@ x with its ten seats per row is compatible with the original design of nine seats in the 7@@ 77 .
the increased cost per unit is still lower than at present used machines with ten seats per row .
&quot; bo@@ eing is therefore squ@@ ee@@ zing more seats into his plane to make it more competitive with our products &quot; , says ke@@ ve@@ in ken@@ i@@ ston , head of passenger transport comfort at the european air@@ ways .
on the other hand , analy@@ sts say that full cab@@ ins with ten seats per row at existing 7@@ 7@@ 7@@ s indicate that many passengers would be interested in the closer arrangement , which would be more expensive .
“ eigh@@ teen customs seats in the world would be great for passengers , but the reality is : from an economic point of view , the airbus a3@@ 80 offer is threatened by the 7@@ 7@@ 7-@@ series .
airbus and bo@@ eing do not offer seats , but a catalogue of suppliers .
the world travell@@ er jet sel@@ lers even carry band@@ width to cover the equipment in the competition .
even if you are a guest at the comfort of your home , all manufacturers offer jet high-@@ compres@@ sed jet jet engines for low-@@ cost airlines and regional flights .
airbus offers an a3@@ 50 with ten@@ -@@ se@@ ater aircraft , but , according to its own statement , it has not yet sold any .
until recently , airbus has stressed the importance of making cab@@ ins more adap@@ table and of providing a wide range of seats for some aircraft .
without the support of the only other manufacturer of large modern jet , experts say that the call for a new industry standard is likely to be sh@@ ut down , but the wave of 7@@ 7@@ x sales is likely to di@@ str@@ act .
new anti-@@ nic@@ ot@@ ine vacc@@ ine could be a great help to the pleasure of smoking .
scientists have developed an anti-@@ nic@@ ot@@ ine vacc@@ ine that will keep the fun of smoking out .
a single do@@ se of the vacc@@ ine could cause m@@ ice to remain in the hands of nic@@ ot@@ ine ad@@ diction for a life@@ time .
before human tests are carried out , further tests are needed , which may take some years to complete , but professor ron@@ ald crystal of the we@@ ill cor@@ n@@ ell medical college in new york said that the first results were good .
“ we are very hope@@ ful that this type of vacc@@ ination strategy will once again help millions of smo@@ kers who have tried to stop and take advantage of all the methods available on the market .
the new vacc@@ ine contains a harm@@ less virus that has been modified to cause the genetic modi@@ fication of the inf@@ ec@@ tions .
the virus selec@@ tively inf@@ ects the li@@ ver cells , which then gener@@ ates a constant stream of anti@@ bodies .
anti@@ bodies hun@@ t down the nic@@ ot@@ ine mo@@ lec@@ ules in the blood and neutr@@ alize the disease , before they can use the brain .
in tri@@ als , vacc@@ inated m@@ ice , who had been ad@@ min@@ istered to nic@@ ot@@ ine , maintained their normal level of activity .
m@@ ice without vacc@@ ination , on the other hand , would have taken a “ time out ” , the researchers declared , a sign that nic@@ ot@@ ine has reached its brain .
the experim@@ ents are published in the journal science trans@@ la@@ tional medicine .
earlier vacc@@ ines against tobacco failed , because they were anti@@ bodies to prevent the disease .
vacc@@ inations had to be used to maintain the anti@@ body level so often that the vacc@@ ination was t@@ ant@@ amount to expensive and im@@ practical .
but the cost of the new vacc@@ ine is likely to be significantly lower , because it trans@@ forms li@@ ver cells into anti@@ body fac@@ tories .
as professor crystal said , the european union could have a future vacc@@ ine for people who are quite certain that they are children .
more likely , however , smo@@ kers would use it to stop .
&quot; you know then : if you start smoking again , you will feel a lot of pain because of the nic@@ ot@@ ine vacc@@ ine .
british scientists said that the results were interesting , but at the same time war@@ ned that further research is needed .
tri@@ po@@ di den@@ ies , from o@@ be@@ id has been influenced to be .
against the former minister of the la@@ b party jo@@ e tri@@ po@@ di from new south wal@@ es , an investigation is being carried out by the state corruption supervision .
the former n@@ s@@ w minister den@@ ies that maritime safety rules are not being applied at the request of his political ment@@ or ed@@ die .
the independent committee of the european commission ( ei@@ b ) is responsible for the implementation of the measures adopted by the european commission on friday .
now , because of the acc@@ us@@ ation , tri@@ po@@ di has been arrested by ob@@ id &apos;s hidden interest in the grounds .
in years of discussions , which began in 2005 , the government had insi@@ sted on public tend@@ ers for the le@@ ase contracts .
the pe@@ as@@ ants were against it and also wanted longer term .
in 2009 , the le@@ asing contracts for companies were awarded to the circu@@ lar qu@@ ay , which awarded the above 2.5 million dollars a year , without any public ten@@ der .
tri@@ po@@ di , which will be open from february 2006 to november 2009 , was originally in favour of public tend@@ ers .
but he refused to accept the changes at the request of o@@ be@@ id , who , as tri@@ po@@ di confirmed , was on a re@@ organization of the le@@ ase arrangements of the government .
one of the ic@@ ac telephone records showed talks from august and september 2007 between o@@ be@@ id , tri@@ po@@ di and ste@@ ve dun@@ n , a leading provider of the ic@@ ac port ministry .
“ was that what was discussed in these telephone conver@@ sa@@ tions the preparation of commercial le@@ asing arrangements ? ” asked the depu@@ ty chief executive of and@@ ré@@ -@@ l@@ é@@ on@@ ard , who is responsible for the matter .
&quot; no , &quot; tri@@ po@@ di rep@@ lied .
i cannot remember what was discussed , but that was not the case .
definitely not between me and mr o@@ be@@ id .
israeli figh@@ ter plan@@ es attack targets in syria , but the official sources say that they are using official sources , such as official sources of the world , are not safe .
israeli hun@@ ting aircraft would have been an objective in sy@@ ri@@ an port of lat@@ ak@@ ia on thursday night , confirmed a leading government employee to fo@@ x news .
the official did not explain what the aim was to do , but said that it was at least one .
according to the associated press , the aim was to produce russian sa@@ -@@ 12@@ 5 ro@@ c@@ kets .
at least twice this year , israel has already carried out air@@ stri@@ kes on missi@@ le supplies in syria .
foreign workers with 4@@ 57 vis@@ as could be “ real test ” .
the government is thinking , within the framework of extended measures , about a “ real test ” for foreign workers with 4@@ 57 vis@@ as .
if the test were to be introduced , it would have a criteri@@ on that would prevent the ban on 4@@ 57 being used for filling un@@ qualified jobs or being used as a back door for the immigration of family and friends to australia .
today , a proposal for discussion by the government was published after the former labour party me@@ p max@@ ine m@@ ck@@ e@@ w has signed the comments of the government regarding foreign workers .
“ l@@ oud declarations like that foreign@@ ers should be standing in the back , ” and , austr@@ ali@@ ans first stop , are a very un@@ pleasant back@@ l@@ ash in times when trade unions are demanding a protected labor market , ” they said to the court .
histor@@ ically , what was meant was that white workers were to be protected – and if some in the region had been ec@@ ho@@ ed by this historical ar@@ te@@ fact , the whole thing would not surprise me .
the discussion proposal out@@ lines twelve measures that were once adopted by the former immigration minister , chr@@ is bow@@ en .
immigration minister bren@@ dan o &apos;@@ con@@ nor , who was invited to talk yesterday about human s@@ mu@@ gg@@ ling in s@@ ri lan@@ ka , has identified five of the recommended amendments that other countries will be considered .
if the “ authentic@@ ity criteri@@ on ” is accepted , someone who has a visa could be sent to the country to check whether the visa is valid .
companies could also be required to account for the number of 4@@ 57 visa holders .
meanwhile , a 3@@ 5-@@ year-@@ old s@@ ri lan@@ k@@ an asylum see@@ ker probably died from a heart attack , after having been arrested this week with a refugee boat on the christmas island .
the distur@@ bed n@@ in@@ e-@@ year-@@ old son of the man who came with him to australia has been killed since his father &apos;s death on wednesday by an adult cou@@ sin@@ n .
austr@@ ali@@ an authorities brought the man to the christmas island hospital .
the british government has announced a study which will examine the benefits of the h@@ s@@ 2 railway project for scotland .
in the work of h@@ s@@ 2 ltd it is proposed to start with phase 1 in 20@@ 26 high-@@ speed connections between scotland and ireland .
transport minister bar@@ on@@ ess k@@ ram@@ er said that the project “ will bring britain closer together ” .
the scot@@ tish transport minister , ke@@ ith brown , said that he was very pleased to work with the british government on this plan .
phase 1 consists of a new high-@@ speed rail link between london and the west mid@@ lands .
after phase 2 , there will be connections to man@@ ch@@ ester and le@@ eds .
in june , the government correc@@ ted the estimated cost of building the high-@@ speed line between london and n@@ ord@@ eng@@ land from 3@@ 2.@@ 7 billion p@@ ounds to 4@@ 2.@@ 6 billion p@@ ounds .
the british government , which was involved in talks with transport scotland , has called h@@ s@@ 2 ltd to look for further capacity and travel time improvements for norway .
this includes the possibility of a travel time of three hours or less of gl@@ as@@ go@@ w and ed@@ in@@ burgh to london .
bar@@ on@@ ess k@@ ram@@ er said : “ our goal for h@@ s@@ 2 is a truly national route network that brings great britain and its cities closer together . ”
we go with h@@ s@@ 2 because it offers enormous advantages .
without it , we are facing a capacity crisis in our rail network .
but it is also about the link between 18 british cities , including gl@@ as@@ go@@ w and ed@@ in@@ burgh , which have been improved thanks to h@@ s@@ 2 .
the scot@@ tish secretary of state ali@@ sta@@ ir car@@ michael comm@@ ented : “ the announcement today is good news for scotland .
on behalf of the scot@@ tish government , ke@@ ith brown car@@ michael called for the words “ un@@ equi@@ vo@@ cal ” to be declared as the scot@@ tish integration into the h@@ s@@ 2 network .
brown said , “ the high-@@ speed rail link en@@ tails the potential for huge economic benefits for scotland , ireland , while providing a good infrastructure for the economy . ”
we are therefore pleased to be a partner of the british government and to make the options for a high-@@ speed rail link in scotland possible , which will benefit everyone and will facilitate the connection between gl@@ as@@ go@@ w ed@@ in@@ burgh , which is the scot@@ tish government .
i look forward to receiving the report of inquiry with british ministers next year .
regulations on electronic equipment in aircraft remain in force for the time being in australia .
austr@@ ali@@ an passengers must continue to receive p@@ ills and smar@@ t@@ phones when they start and land .
the us federal aviation administration ( f@@ sa ) allows us airlines to fly their pre-@@ conditions and to make passengers travel on their equipment during critical flight hours .
during most of the flight , passengers are already allowed to do so , but many people find it an@@ no@@ ying that they are not allowed to travel on board when they start and land .
austr@@ ali@@ an companies are watching the decision to implement the us airlines to buy a lot of work , and are not pursuing immediate plans to change their rules .
the air navigation agency casa also stated that it would take into account the announcement , but stressed that the restric@@ tion on the use of electronic equipment in critical air travel ph@@ ases in australia remains un@@ clear .
“ the casa does not have any specific regulations regarding the use of electronic equipment on the aircraft , ” said .
the subject is subject to rules that allow airlines to maintain safety at all times and to allow passengers to use the safety requirements provided by cab@@ in crew .
vir@@ gin has already started with the casa talks about an extension of use of his wi-fi entertainment system on flights .
“ we would prefer a review of the authorisation of electronic devices by the casa , because we are convinced that this is a way to improve customer experience , now that we have ( wireless entertainment ) installed during the flight ” , said mr. bar@@ ack obama .
q@@ ant@@ as said that they will be available until further notice in the current regulations .
“ our current directives require electronic devices to be installed at the start and lan@@ ding stage , and we currently have no plans to do so . ” he said .
fa@@ a rules apply to us airlines .
however , we are always interested in developments in regulations that passengers can benefit from and will be aware of the fa@@ a decision and the reasons behind it .
the decision has an impact on us companies depending on the age of the fleet .
they must prove that their aircraft have caused radio inter@@ ference by mobile devices , and they must provide manu@@ als , training materials , hand bag@@ gage programmes and customer instruc@@ tion .
“ after an airline has shown the tolerance of its fleet , it can offer passengers the use of port@@ able , light electronic devices such as tab@@ lets , e-@@ book read@@ ers and smart phones .
in rare cases , when the eye is not on , the crew will instruc@@ t the passengers to use the equipment during the lan@@ ding .
the group also recommended that he@@ avi@@ er devices be used safe@@ ly under the seat or in the subjects of the seats when they were started and lan@@ ded .
in front of the reg@@ er@@ by against sch@@ al@@ ke , b@@ v@@ b tra@@ il@@ ers with ligh@@ t-@@ powered missi@@ les had been equipped with u@@ g@@ ly scenes in the vel@@ t@@ ins arena .

before the friday match of the football bun@@ des@@ lig@@ a against the v@@ f@@ b stutt@@ gart re@@ acted to the ul@@ tr@@ as with a silence - first .
it was an unusual , almost spec@@ u@@ lative ac@@ ous@@ tics that was exposed to the vie@@ wer until just before the start of the bun@@ des@@ lig@@ a game between the german vice champi@@ on bor@@ us@@ sia dor@@ t@@ mun@@ d and the v@@ f@@ b .
the main part of the audience was the guests ’ fans with their songs .
the south gallery , on the other hand , is where the most loy@@ al of the loy@@ al - and lou@@ dest - fans of b@@ v@@ b , initially presented themselves excep@@ tionally qui@@ e@@ tly : no sing@@ ings , no battle calls .
the po@@ dium of cap@@ o , which otherwise would have to coordinate the joint mo@@ ist@@ ure , remained un@@ filled .
and right at the front of the gallery , lon@@ ely , a great flag ble@@ w with a label &quot; section sta@@ dium ban &quot; .
only as a go@@ al@@ ke@@ eper roman we@@ iden@@ f@@ ell@@ er as always the first b@@ v@@ b player to take the place , bran@@ ded short-@@ time che@@ er .
when his team colleagues followed , there were vo@@ cal voc@@ als and fl@@ our@@ ishing scar@@ ves - but not everywhere .
the central blocks 12 and 13 of the south grand@@ stand were full of ho@@ sti@@ lity .
the fact that sta@@ dium spo@@ kes@@ man nor@@ bert dic@@ kel once again describes the positive experiences of the last few days - der@@ by victory , victory over ar@@ sen@@ al , contract extension by tra@@ iner j@@ ür@@ gen k@@ lo@@ p@@ p - did not worry .

finally , as always , the south gallery was in the gallery - and finally there was again as usual the lou@@ dest place in the sta@@ dium .
and as soon as the first person to be att@@ acked by the south grand@@ stand , the l@@ oud call &quot; der@@ by winner is up &quot; was again , as always .
the silence before that was probably a response to what has happened in recent days .
just before the vi@@ er@@ der@@ by at the f@@ c sch@@ al@@ ke 04 some of the other b@@ v@@ b fans had light missi@@ les in the spec@@ t@@ ators ’ ran@@ ks and placed on the square - and almost tor@@ ch@@ men were ro@@ lled .

deposit houses are bo@@ om@@ ing in sing@@ apor@@ e , as the crisis in the middle class has arrived .
in a deposit house in the shopping centre of b@@ end@@ em@@ e@@ er in sing@@ apor@@ e jan@@ ani am@@ ir@@ th@@ all@@ ing@@ a exchanges a golden arm@@ re@@ if , a ring and a few ear@@ r@@ ings to make the school fees of their children .
&quot; my hus@@ band and i have just bought a house , there is all my money in it , &quot; am@@ ir@@ th@@ all@@ ing@@ a says .
although it has 3@@ ,000 sing@@ apor@@ e dollars ( about 1,@@ 7@@ 30 euros ) every month as an administrative employee , and her hus@@ band also works , the monthly sal@@ ary of the family does not suff@@ ice , it explains .
indeed , demand in parts of south-@@ east asia – where debt in house@@ holds is increasing – has been so large that valu@@ em@@ a@@ x , where it exce@@ eds its exchange rate , will be the third deposit house this week .
the ple@@ d@@ ging of je@@ wel@@ ry is not only a fast way to get money – 1,@@ 300 sing@@ apor@@ e dollars in the case of jan@@ ani am@@ ir@@ t@@ th@@ al@@ ing@@ a – but also almost as cheap as a cheap way to buy a product .
typically , deposit houses in sing@@ apor@@ e demand effective annual interest rates of 17 % , which are only bare@@ ly above the 15@@ .@@ 4 % that the uni@@ ted over@@ seas investment bank ( l@@ f@@ p ) demands .
however , deposit houses offer the advantage that no credit rating is veri@@ fied or re@@ tained .
for this reason , millions of people in the region are turning to deposit houses after families have been subjec@@ ted to pressure from rising living costs and increased household and consumer debt .
after five years of robust growth since the global financial crisis and cheap loans due to lo@@ ose fiscal policies in developed economies , families with low income and middle class are looking for depos@@ it@@ aries to help st@@ ot@@ ter families .
this week , the credit rating agency standard &amp; poor &apos;s growing household debt in the us , mainly due to rising mort@@ g@@ ages , called a risk factor for the cred@@ it@@ wor@@ thin@@ ess of asian banks .
mal@@ ay@@ sia , thailand , and sing@@ apor@@ e have , according to the agency ’ s assessment , the highest household debt in asia in relation to gdp .
mal@@ ay@@ sia is the world ’ s leading supplier of oil , accounting for 80 % of gdp , and a 60 % increase in 2008 .
econom@@ ists worry about the high level of consumer debt in thailand , which is due to rise just this week from a technical recession .
on thursday , the data showed a continuing ex@@ port@@ -@@ vig@@ il@@ ance and a decline in consumer demand .
“ in the end , this means that , with rising costs , middle to lower people will be more likely to be less likely to be in the middle to lower classes of income .
historical pe@@ aks in gold prices over the past two years have increased the trend of ple@@ d@@ ging personal items .
in sing@@ apor@@ e , about 70 % of the ple@@ d@@ ged items are stored in the 200 deposit houses of the city state gold .
people say , “ gold prices look good , lau@@ gh , and let us be grand@@ mother ’ s gold chain , and return next month . ”
the largest th@@ ai deposit house operator , eas@@ y@@ money , has in its branches in a 20@@ -@@ percent mort@@ gage l@@ ending to the uk in recent months .
the growth in the deposit business is so strong that valu@@ em@@ a@@ x , the owner of the branch in b@@ end@@ em@@ e@@ er and 15 others in sing@@ apor@@ e , is not only able to export to neighbouring mal@@ ay@@ sia – where the company is located .
the company finances the company with 60 % of the 66 million sing@@ apor@@ e dollars it will be using this week with the sin@@ hal@@ ese stock exchange .
while some l@@ enders are being forced to cross the fire due to high interest rates , ye@@ ah says that deposit houses are not only cheaper interest rates than other l@@ enders , but also not directly raise debt .
“ clients bor@@ row items they already own , and the liquid personal information is used to increase the value of the household . ”
the deposit le@@ asing business is increasingly seen as a short-term , secured financing in society .
nor are all the people who are using p@@ f@@ and@@ le@@ i@@ gh in financial difficulties .
rich people from sing@@ apor@@ e also come to the stores of valu@@ em@@ a@@ x to buy gold bars and ro@@ le@@ x wat@@ ches .
we have clients from all social back@@ grounds .
“ these include weal@@ thy people who need to do something for a business or investment in the short term , or small businesses that are exposed to bott@@ len@@ ec@@ ks in cash flow , ” says ye@@ ah .
sometimes you just need money very quickly .

b@@ ail@@ out of eur 3@@ 25 million from australia for tas@@ man@@ ian health care
the austr@@ ali@@ an government insi@@ sts on the tough conditions imposed by the b@@ ail@@ out package of over 3@@ 25 million austr@@ ali@@ an dollars for the tas@@ man@@ ian health system .
federal health minister t@@ any@@ a p@@ liber@@ se@@ k has announced that the comm@@ on@@ wealth will be “ taking immediate action ” to prevent a crisis .
the funding for a period of four years was increased after consul@@ tations with the independent tas@@ man@@ ian me@@ p andre@@ w wil@@ ki@@ e .
“ the government has created an emergency rescue package , ” said the government , which we believe will address the unique challenges facing the federal state in the coming years . ”
the 3@@ 25 million dollar mark is a package of 31 million dollars in emergency aid to the country ’ s electoral output .
the company has also been involved in several 26@@ 00 operations , including or@@ th@@ op@@ a@@ edi@@ c operations and treatments for cat@@ ar@@ act .
moreover , there is money for day@@ -@@ care clin@@ ics in ho@@ b@@ art and laun@@ ce@@ ston , better post-@@ patient care after sta@@ tionary stays , and the training of specialist staff , mental health services and the introduction of a system of electronic surveillance .
“ these investments are in line with the ideas that i have been affected by clin@@ ics , who have said that they are the best way to improve the tas@@ man@@ ian health system , ” said t@@ any@@ a p@@ liber@@ se@@ k .
the minister insi@@ sted on a strict reporting and accountability procedure .
the state must keep the current level of funding in order to get money from the comm@@ on@@ wealth , and monthly loans must be made to report where the additional money has been spent .
a three-@@ member commission will be set up to ensure that the state will provide health services as effectively and efficiently as possible .
like wil@@ ki@@ e today , the 3@@ 25 million dollars would be of little use if “ they were not accompanied by real reforms that would make the tas@@ man@@ ian public health system sustainable . ”
nevertheless , he p@@ raised the government for respon@@ ding to his request for urgent help , which he had initially sent to the prime minister at the beginning of may .
“ i am confident that federal aid will make a major contribution to improving public health systems in the state of the state from the list of concerns , ” said wil@@ ki@@ e .
according to the government of the state , these election benefits will largely reflect the recent cuts .
but the health policy spo@@ kes@@ man of the opposition at federal level , peter du@@ tt@@ on , believes that today &apos;s announcement is only a “ pl@@ aster over the past . ”
“ we are therefore in the present situation because the laboratory state government has allocated $ 4@@ 30 million from the health system ” , said he said to ab@@ c tv .

syria has lost its ability to manufacture chemical weapons , such a surveillance group would have to put in place a panel of inspec@@ tors to monitor the situation .
syria has important facilities for producing chemical weapons and g@@ it@@ ft@@ gas am@@ m@@ uni@@ tion destroyed , the global surveillance group on chemical weapons declared on thursday , while it was in the north of the country to have serious cl@@ ash@@ es near one of the two .
on thursday , a sy@@ ri@@ an acti@@ vis@@ t group also announced that more than 1@@ 20@@ ,000 people have died since the civil war began three years ago .
the announcement by the organisation for the ban on chemical weapons ( op@@ c@@ w ) came one day before the deadline of 1 january 2010 , when the commission announced its intention to ban them .
1 november , which the conference of presidents of the h@@ ague based organisation , dam@@ as@@ c@@ us , set up to replace all the facilities for producing chemical weapons or to replace them “ in@@ oper@@ able ” , including all machines for mix@@ ing chemicals .
the conclusion of this process , which is basically the first stage of destruction , is an important mil@@ est@@ one in an ambitious timetable for the implementation of the destruction of all chemical weapons .
the destruction of facilities means that syria cannot create new chemical weapons .
dam@@ as@@ c@@ us , however , still has to start using the weapons and stocks available .
it is believed that there are about 1@@ ,000 tonnes of chemicals and weapons in the country , including mu@@ st@@ ard gas and ner@@ ve gas sar@@ in .
the announcement came at a time when , on thursday , fighting in the city of sa@@ fir@@ a took place , which experts say that there is a production facility for chemical weapons and storage facilities .
the activi@@ sts who have a network of activi@@ sts in syria have reduced the number of deaths , declared on thursday , 1@@ 20@@ .@@ 2@@ 96 people had died .
of these , 6@@ 1,@@ 0@@ 67 civili@@ ans , including 6@@ ,@@ 3@@ 65 children .
the government has had 2@@ 9@@ ,@@ 9@@ 54 of them belonging to president bas@@ ha@@ r as@@ sad &apos;s army , 18@@ ,@@ 6@@ 78 being pro-@@ government figh@@ ters and 18@@ 7 leban@@ ese hit@@ ch@@ co@@ ck soldiers .
also among the dead were 2,@@ 20@@ 2 deser@@ ted army soldiers and 5@@ ,@@ 3@@ 75 figh@@ ters of the opposition , many of them foreign@@ ers .
on 25 july , the un estimated the number of deaths in this conflict since march 2011 to 10@@ 0,000 .
this figure has not been updated .
the conflict has left some two million people fle@@ eing the country .
as@@ sad ’ s troops have been fighting in sa@@ fir@@ a for weeks against the re@@ be@@ ls , many of whom have links to al-@@ q@@ a@@ ed@@ a groups .
the observ@@ atory said that it suffered losses on both sides on thursday , but did not say any details .
the fighting under@@ lines the danger that the chemical weapons inspec@@ tors are exposed to , because their mission to liber@@ ate syria from its po@@ is@@ on@@ ous ar@@ sen@@ al of weapons is a race against time in the mid@@ st of a r@@ aging civil war .
the op@@ c@@ w , which is closely linked to the united nations , says that the team is “ now convinced that it can meet all the major production and mix@@ ing / filling standards mentioned by syria and that it is experiencing destruction . ”
therefore , ‘ no further inspection activities are planned at the moment ’ .
earlier this week , the inspec@@ tors said they had launched the first round of checks and that they had completed 21 of the 23 of the sites mentioned by dam@@ as@@ c@@ us .
due to security concerns , the visit of two institutions was not possible , the inspec@@ tors said .
on thursday , the op@@ wc said that the two sites are not in the open , according to sy@@ ri@@ an statement .
it was not immediately clear whether the site in sa@@ fir@@ a was one of the two facilities that the op@@ c@@ w inspec@@ tors could not visit .
syria has drawn up a plan for the complete destruction of its chemical weapons , which will be adopted next month by the op@@ wc executive committee .
&quot; i prefer to be a bra@@ ve and pas@@ sion@@ ate man , who is all in charge of ful@@ filling the most challenging mission ever undertaken by this organisation .
for three years now , the mostly sun@@ ni muslim re@@ be@@ ls have been fighting as@@ sad ’ s government and its security forces in this civil war , which has left many members of the al@@ a@@ wi@@ tes , in the sec@@ ession of shi@@ a islam .
with regard to further developments , the head of the observ@@ atory said that ram@@ i ab@@ dur@@ ra@@ h@@ man , there was a strong explo@@ sion on wednesday in an air defence facility in the sy@@ ri@@ an coastal province of lat@@ ak@@ ia .
the cause of the explo@@ sion was not known , he explained .
an@@ ger at bom@@ b@@ ings by bal@@ i
survi@@ v@@ ors and rela@@ tives of the 20@@ 2 people who died in 2002 during the bal@@ i bom@@ b attack were the victims of the attacks .
pa@@ te@@ k , who was one of the most popular and respected people in south-@@ east asia on the run for almost ten years , was yesterday awarded the prize for his role in the construction of explo@@ si@@ ves for the bom@@ b attack .
with a suspension of penalties , it could be dis@@ missed after 15 years .
the 4@@ 5-@@ year-@@ old was sent@@ enced to mass murder for the alleg@@ ed attack on two night clubs in the popular tourist resort area of k@@ ut@@ a , where he was killed by 20@@ 2 people , including 88 austr@@ ali@@ ans .
a guil@@ t was also made in a number of terrorist charges against the united states , including a wave of explo@@ sive weapons .
the prosecu@@ tor had a life sentence , but he was not prosecu@@ ted for the man who was sent@@ enced to death for his reputation as a master@@ ful bom@@ ber buil@@ der .
the decision has pain@@ ful mem@@ ories of june cor@@ te@@ en , who is a mother of per@@ th who has lost her 39 year-@@ old twin to@@ wers , jan@@ e and jen@@ ny , in the pa@@ te@@ k family .
with te@@ ars , she said , pa@@ te@@ k had become dead .
i really think it should be read in the foot@@ steps of the other gu@@ ys .
“ it should be war@@ ned of being shot , ” he said .
i have to live with the fact that i cannot get any more grand@@ children and i never see my dau@@ gh@@ ters again .
the sar@@ i club was made to the ground when on october 12 , 2002 , a massive crow@@ d of bom@@ bs was bur@@ ied in a small tr@@ uck , which was in front of the club .
peter hu@@ gh@@ es was in pad@@ dy &apos;s bar where only 20 seconds earlier a su@@ ici@@ de bom@@ ber arrived at a sp@@ ra@@ w@@ l .
he fell into a state of emergency for a month after the attack and “ died ” three times while he was on a life preser@@ vation system .
hu@@ gh@@ es said pa@@ te@@ k deser@@ ved the same fate as the other three members of the j@@ em@@ a@@ ah islam@@ i@@ ah terrorist cell – am@@ ro@@ zi , mu@@ kh@@ las , and i@@ ma@@ m sam@@ u@@ dr@@ a – who were responsible for the disease .
really , this type should above all receive the death penalty .
to keep it alive – no , there is no reason to keep it alive .
to get 20 years after he killed 20@@ 2 people and killed many hundreds of people is not much .
pa@@ te@@ k is the last of the bal@@ i bom@@ bers to be tried .
he almost es@@ cap@@ ed the arrest of a decade , but was eventually arrested in january 2011 in the pa@@ ki@@ stan@@ i city of ab@@ bot@@ tab@@ ad , where us forces were forced to re@@ sume former al-@@ q@@ a@@ ed@@ a chief , os@@ ama b@@ in less than four months later .
during the negotiation , an f@@ bi agent said that secret service reports would make the point that the security council had not been in pakistan .
&quot; he did not stand up , &quot; said cor@@ te@@ en .
until recently , he has shown no rep@@ ent@@ ance for the suffering he inf@@ lic@@ ts on other people .
the judgment was made before the ten@@ -@@ year anniversary of the attack this year , which was marked by comm@@ em@@ or@@ ations in bal@@ i and australia .
“ there will be many te@@ ars this year , ” said cor@@ te@@ en .
pa@@ te@@ k may still appeal against his judgment .
fa@@ a : passengers can now buy electronic equipment in aircraft ( but no mobile phone calls ) .
passengers can now benefit from a free flight from the departure to lan@@ ding , to read , work , play , listen to music and watch films , but not to travel with the mobile phone , so the new guidelines that are to be adopted on thursday .
but passengers should not expect these changes to be implemented immediately .
how quickly they would be implemented depends on the airline concerned , explained fa@@ a staff michael hu@@ er@@ ta on a press conference .
airlines must be able to prove to the fa@@ a that aircraft comply with the new rules and that they have read the flight instruc@@ tion manu@@ als and the regulations governing the storage of equipment in accordance with the new regulations .
the fa@@ a has stated that it has already received plans from some airlines to ban the use of port@@ able electronic equipment in aircraft .
among these airlines , del@@ ta and j@@ et@@ blue were also .
“ depending on the state of the plan , we could use the extended use of electronic devices very soon , ” said fa@@ a in a statement that it was not .
at present , passengers must use smar@@ t@@ phones , tab@@ lets and other devices when aircraft are being closed .
you may not re@@ start it until the plane has reached a height of three kilometers and the captain has given the green light .
when entering the lan@@ ding strip , passengers must return to their seats and must not re@@ start them before the plane is lan@@ ded .
under the new directives , airlines whose aircraft are protected against electronic distur@@ ban@@ ces could provide passengers with the opportunity to use the equipment even when they are on board , even when they are on the run@@ way .
most new aircraft and other aircraft , which are essential for the use of wi-fi in larger hei@@ ghts , are now in service .
la@@ ura gl@@ ading , president of professional association of professional cab@@ in crew , welcomed the changes .
“ if the new regulation is implemented safe@@ ly – and we are working closely with the airline in this regard – both sides will benefit , ” gl@@ ading comm@@ ented .
we are quite hon@@ est@@ ly ti@@ red of being too ob@@ s@@ essed with this issue .
however , internet connections to sur@@ f , exchange email , text messages or download files remained under three kil@@ ome@@ tre .
passengers are asked to purchase smar@@ t@@ phones , tab@@ lets and other devices in flight mode .
so still no word with friends !
and he@@ avi@@ er devices like lap@@ top@@ s must continue to be du@@ sty , as they pose a risk of in@@ jury if they are flying through the cab@@ in .
mobile calls during the flight will also remain prohibited .
the regulatory competence for telephone calls lies with the federal communications commission .
fa@@ a may lift a ban on certain electronic devices at start and lan@@ ding on the mobile phones at star@@ tup and lan@@ ding .
last month mark ro@@ sen@@ ker said of the national transport safety authority that the national transport safety board , safety experts for national transport issues on c@@ bs news , mobile phones would still be considered a risk .
“ mobile phone is really a problem , not only because they potentially inter@@ f@@ ere with navigation devices , but because we are dependent on the f@@ cc to know that the transmission from the air is also trans@@ mitting ma@@ sts . ”
a consul@@ tative committee of the industry , led by the fa@@ a to study this issue , has been recomm@@ ending that the industry should be given a clear , more effective use of personal electronic equipment .
in recent years , pressure on fac@@ tories has increased , restrictions on trade in goods and services have been eas@@ ed .
cri@@ tics such as the democratic sen@@ ator cla@@ ire mc@@ cas@@ k@@ ill from mis@@ sour@@ i believe that it is possible to have no valid security reasons for ban@@ ning the ban .
the restrictions are also increasingly difficult to en@@ force , because the use of equipment has become u@@ bi@@ qu@@ it@@ ous .
some studies suggest that the level of the disease is up to a third of passengers who are unable to switch off the device .
the fa@@ a began in 196@@ 6 to ban the use of electronic equipment by air passengers after reports of distur@@ ban@@ ces in navigation and communication equipment were published by passengers .
new aircraft are much more dependent on electrical systems than previous generations of aircraft , but they are also so constructive that they are dependent on fa@@ a .
airlines offer passengers a wide range of wi-fi internet access for a number of years , when the flight is reached .
the software , which is adapted to wi-fi systems , is also in@@ sensitive to the inter@@ ference of the aircraft .
the vast majority of passenger aircraft should be designed for greater use of electronic equipment according to the new directives , as hu@@ er@@ ta said .
today &apos;s electronic equipment generally produces much less radi@@ ant radiation than previous generations .
e-@@ reader , for example , only yi@@ el@@ ds minimal radiation when you f@@ li@@ p .
but downloading or sending data requires the transfer values to be higher .
those who advoc@@ ate relaxing restrictions on the use of equipment include the use of the new am@@ az@@ on@@ .@@ com@@ .
in 2011 , company employees invited a passenger aircraft full of kin@@ dle e-@@ reader and made a test flight to investigate problems that could be detec@@ ted but not found .
members of the fa@@ a advisory committee expressed their views on mixed feel@@ ings , which increased the risk of using equipment .
dou@@ gl@@ as kid@@ d from the passenger association national association of airline passengers .
other committee members said that there is only a few isolated reports from pi@@ rates .
the committee recommended that the fa@@ a should , however , allow pil@@ ots to travel to the united states on instrument lan@@ ding under poor vi@@ sibility conditions .
a group from the travel industry welcomed the changes and called them reasonable and appropriate adjustment for travellers who are now travelling exten@@ sively equipped with technology .
“ we are pleased that the fa@@ a recogn@@ iz@@ es that a pleasant passenger experience does not conflict with safety , ” said ro@@ ger do@@ w , ceo of the u.s. trade show association .
by air rescue service from n@@ ord@@ see dr@@ illing island , sa@@ iled bird , returned to the island of i@@ bi@@ za .
a car par@@ ked by air service to the coast is a very popular way of getting to know the island .
the water r@@ al was closed last month with a helicop@@ ter to ab@@ er@@ de@@ en , where it was taken from the scot@@ tish animal welfare organisation sp@@ ca in their rescue centre in all@@ om@@ a .
col@@ in se@@ d@@ don , head of the center , said , “ this water pur@@ se was probably a winter mi@@ gr@@ atory bird from northern europe that was caused by the strong win@@ ds above the north sea . ”
it seems that the exhaus@@ ted bird was looking for refu@@ ge on the dr@@ ill island .
he added , “ he could not continue flying , which is why we asked for help . ”
when they were released , the water r@@ al was fit and healthy again .
is europe ’ s elite prepared to do business with britain ?
business for britain was founded in april with the intention of bringing the economy together and of bringing it to a conclusion , which is what those who in britain want to bring wealth and work in our relations with the eu want to change .
to this end , we have created the largest and most comprehensive survey among british economic leaders and have asked them what they think about britain , the economy , and the eu .
you@@ go@@ v in@@ qui@@ red about 1@@ ,000 execu@@ tives from the economy who had roughly the british company sizes , sectors , and regions .
the results of the survey will surprise many .
we have found that the vast majority of companies have now grown outside europe and are rel@@ ying on countries that need to modern@@ ise and grow , while the states in the eu are stag@@ n@@ ating .
they want to see a new trade relationship with countries like china , india , and brazil fav@@ oured by government , rather than dealing with the long and ex@@ hau@@ sting process that has been the ar@@ can@@ e eu institutions .
asked for your opinion on certain issues regulated by law – from car@@ tel law to product legislation – the majority of economic leaders in the world believe that control of these key competences should be exerc@@ ised in west@@ min@@ ster .
there was widespread dis@@ satisfaction with the internal market , as companies say that the cost of the brussels rules has now been out@@ weigh@@ ed by the benefits of being part of europe &apos;s trade area – even 40 % of large companies agreed .
finally , and probably most importantly , our evidence of the survey of economic leaders showed that a clear majority of people would like to see britain move towards a change in the agreement and establish a relationship with the eu based on trade , not politics .
this re@@ alization , which is reflected in companies of all sizes and leading companies , shows that the economy is heading for a “ meaning@@ ful change ” that the le@@ it@@ mo@@ ti@@ f of action brings back to britain .
it is a lot – an amendment to the agreement and better conditions for britain would lead to a 16 % change of opinion in favour of remaining in the eu in a referendum .
the prime minister should have no doubt : this survey shows that the british economy is lag@@ ging behind his plan for re@@ negotiating the british conditions for eu membership .
it also shows that companies are dependent on a re@@ negotiation to clearly shift their balance of power back to britain .
a better deal for the british economy is possible and , increasingly , necessary after the eurozone has joined the euro zone in the direction of closer economic and fiscal union .
the priority must be jobs and growth in britain , as the result of our survey shows , what increased attention is being given to businesses to trade and a fundamental change in the brussels approach to rules .
alex@@ e@@ i mill@@ er of ga@@ z@@ pro@@ m calls pipel@@ ine in bulgaria the beginning of a new gas era in bulgaria as the beginning of a new gas era in the new gas era .
construction of the south stream pipel@@ ine is under way in bulgaria , starting a new one for one of the largest european energy projects , ga@@ z@@ pro@@ m ’ s board of directors declared .
“ today ’ s event is a mil@@ est@@ one : the construction work on the bulg@@ arian section of the south stream gas pipel@@ ine , the largest and most important project in europe , has begun , ” said the ceo of ga@@ z@@ pro@@ m .
the project is a key element in the energy security of the whole of the european continent .
south stream is to ensure greater diversity in russia &apos;s export routes through europe .
a dispute between ga@@ z@@ pro@@ m and its counter@@ parts in ukraine , where the euro is largely a source of gas for europe , is a serious matter .
mill@@ er said that the direct link to bulgaria , a member of the european union , meant that the costs associated with transit countries would be much higher “ fore@@ ver . ”
bulg@@ arian consumers receive gas from south stream at a reduced rate , if the entire project is to be operational in 20@@ 15 .
ga@@ z@@ pro@@ m says that construction works in other sub@@ ordin@@ ate countries should be carried out on the planned route at the end of the year .
the pipel@@ ine is limited to an annual capacity of 6@@ 2.@@ 3 billion cu@@ b@@ ic metres of natural gas .

hearing before the royal commission : two y@@ m@@ ca staff in front of acc@@ us@@ ations against jon@@ a@@ than lord for sexual off@@ ences .
two y@@ m@@ ca employees from new south wal@@ es ( n@@ s@@ w ) were arrested for sexual off@@ ences associated with children .
but the opening statement before the commission did not take into account the y@@ m@@ ca ’ s statement that ‘ never had an incident of sexual abuse in the organisation at all . ’
managing director phil@@ li@@ p h@@ are was consulted on a case in which a y@@ m@@ ca employee was convic@@ ted of off@@ ences involving child por@@ no@@ graphy .
h@@ are said ga@@ il fur@@ ness , one of the assi@@ sting lawyers of the commission , that he was aware of the first case , the second but not known .
he ad@@ mitted that the opening declaration of the y@@ m@@ ca to the commission was also in@@ accurate in claim@@ ing that ‘ it was external experts who carried out external inspec@@ tions of the y@@ m@@ ca in which the y@@ m@@ ca was found to be at the front .
evidence to the commission is that the y@@ m@@ ca is informed about how the y@@ m@@ ca is the second lowest assessment of four possible cases in a quality audit of the department of economic and monetary affairs .
har@@ dy , who was 21 at the y@@ m@@ ca , ad@@ mitted that the management had “ been led by me down . ”
lord was arrested early this year for sexual off@@ ences against twelve bo@@ ys during his two-@@ year term of office for the y@@ m@@ ca .
he was sent@@ enced to at least six years in prison .
but h@@ are denied that the y@@ m@@ ca is a cultural problem , which employees are prevented from using the l@@ ord@@ s off@@ ences in relation to the safety of children .
the staff said they had observed violations , including the fact that lor@@ ds alone could not cope with children , but they were able to keep them priv@@ ately as bab@@ y@@ sit@@ ters , let them sit on their la@@ p , said that he was .
dani@@ elle oc@@ k@@ well , whose chief lord was and is still seeking a training for the child protection , was a member of the committee on legal affairs and the internal market , saying that child services were concerned about child abuse .
the managing director said he would not accept statements by employees that they are not d@@ ared to pay their executive notice .
instead , he said , they have lost their friend@@ ship with lord their judgment .
ha@@ ere explained that he has advis@@ ed the board of the y@@ m@@ ca n@@ s@@ w to state his view that the lesson the organization lear@@ ns from the jon@@ a@@ than lord ’ s incident is to be learned .
h@@ are said the decision to force employees to sign confid@@ enti@@ ality obligations shortly after the acc@@ us@@ ations occurred was a decision taken by the director of the child services of the y@@ m@@ ca , li@@ am wh@@ it@@ ley .
he said that this should prevent contam@@ ination of the evidence , but that is “ over-@@ ze@@ al@@ ous ” and badly implemented .
the y@@ m@@ ca n@@ s@@ w was in the time when jon@@ a@@ than lord was in charge of the building between 2009 and 2011 , no organization safe for children , professor ste@@ ph@@ en small@@ b@@ one said of the gri@@ ff@@ ith university .

when asked whether he would like to be appointed prime minister , i would like to ask him whether he was going to be re-@@ elected from the evening standard from london , saying ‘ yes , safe , but it is unlikely that that will happen ... ’
when the horse show experts met in dro@@ ves in car@@ di@@ ff , they were able to put the horse back of the year , they knew that a hard horse would be a battle .
but no one was on the three-@@ year-@@ old f@@ ent@@ on kir@@ k@@ land prepared .
the k@@ n@@ ir@@ ps , which has not even been in the kin@@ der@@ gar@@ ten and only made its first steps a few months ago , and its sh@@ et@@ land pon@@ y to@@ ff@@ ee tr@@ aded loo@@ sely through the three roun@@ ds and re@@ tri@@ pled the course .

in his performance in competition with men and women with elegant mel@@ ons , he had his leg@@ hold cap in a che@@ e@@ ky angle and led the two years old daughter of the to@@ ff@@ ee through the ring .
f@@ ent@@ on was chosen by the jur@@ ors for his natural abilities in dealing with the pon@@ y , which goes well beyond his age .
and to@@ ff@@ ee received be@@ st@@ marks for his appearance and person@@ ality .
f@@ ent@@ on had visited to@@ ff@@ ee last march as a gift for his third birth@@ day and since then , every day , he has been practic@@ ing with the sh@@ et@@ land pon@@ y .
his mother , don@@ na , 30 , said : “ f@@ ent@@ on and to@@ ff@@ ee are a great ch@@ or@@ d . ”
they had to fight against the entire field and are equipped with gol@@ d@@ po@@ k@@ al and ro@@ set@@ te from the square .
it was only the second time that he was working with to@@ ff@@ ee in a competition and we were all delighted that he was won .
completely str@@ ang@@ ers in the arena thought him so phenomen@@ al that he could not be photograph@@ ed with him .

he ran on sand the entire length of the arena and although he was so tiny he was not able to make fantastic work .
f@@ ent@@ on is cra@@ zy about animals – he lo@@ ves horses , trac@@ tors and farms and has two h@@ ens of ch@@ ick@@ ens to look around .
as it is started , it will not take long for it to be on the “ horse of the year ” show – and i am sure that it will be well done .

together they are a great team .

chinese newspaper is to be “ re@@ formed ” after calling for a “ reform ” of china ’ s newspaper .
a chinese newspaper , on the front page , calling for the release of a re@@ porter who was arrested for de@@ fam@@ ation , has been accused of being de@@ fam@@ ed , has declared a press review .
the gu@@ ang@@ z@@ ho@@ u based company , the new express , had a rare public call for the release of the journ@@ alist chen y@@ ong@@ z@@ ho@@ u .
but chen later ad@@ mitted on television that he had taken up bri@@ bes to send reports of a su@@ pr@@ an@@ ational company .
now the new express will be a “ comprehensive rec@@ ti@@ fication ” , the regulatory authority declared .
the “ rec@@ ti@@ fication order ” came from the authority for press and publications , radio , film and television in gu@@ ang@@ z@@ ho@@ u .
preliminary investigations have shown that the council &apos;s new express , the express route to the y@@ ang@@ chen@@ g evening news group , is between september 20@@ 12 and august 2013 to be found to contain several in@@ accurate reports on the listed company .
“ ed@@ it@@ orial management of the new express was dis@@ ordered , ” the regul@@ ator announced in a statement .
she said that she decided to ‘ impose administrative pun@@ ishment for chen y@@ ong@@ z@@ ho@@ u ’ and to give him his re@@ port@@ -@@ licence ’ .
in addition , “ the y@@ ang@@ chen@@ g evening news group ” has instruc@@ ted to provide a full rec@@ ti@@ fication of the new express and recommended to inform the relevant managers at the new express and to immediately inform the management team of the new express .
chen had several articles for the new express , in which he wrote about alleg@@ ed financial ir@@ regul@@ arities with a manufacturer of construction machinery called zo@@ om@@ lion .
after being arrested , he published a paper on the death penalty .
but then chen appeared on state television and ad@@ mitted that he was making false reports against pay .
“ in this case i have appreciated zo@@ om@@ lion , as well as the entire news industry and its ability to win the public ’ s trust , ” he explained to the state news station c@@ c@@ tv .
i have done so primarily because i am looking for money and gl@@ ory .
i have re@@ alised that i have acted incorrec@@ tly .
following chen ’ s apo@@ logy , the new express issued an apo@@ logy on the front page , expla@@ ining that it was missed .
various susp@@ ects have recently been arrested and sent@@ enced to death on television .
experts say that conf@@ essions are still rout@@ ine , and that the only way to get them right at the beginning of the year is to ban the authorities from ex@@ porting people to buy themselves .
drug tunnel with own railway between the us and mexico disco@@ vers the potential of a new type of drug tunnel between mexico and mexico .
one of the most sophisticated tun@@ nels for drug s@@ mu@@ gg@@ ling between the us and mexico , which is completely equipped with lighting , v@@ enti@@ lation and electrical railway operations , is now closed .
the us authorities described the 120 times 90 cen@@ time@@ ters tunnel as a major source of information for the european union .
the tunnel that is in the zi@@ g@@ z@@ ag pattern , which is about six football fields , connec@@ ts ware@@ houses in the vicinity of ti@@ j@@ u@@ ana , mexico , and san di@@ e@@ go , usa .
there are countless un@@ seem@@ ingly endless sho@@ res in the area , making it easier to cope with dru@@ g-@@ loaded lor@@ ries .
the tunnel has been closed before drugs are trans@@ ported un@@ detec@@ ted , but the authorities have said that .
the discovery of the tunnel made eight and a half tonnes of mari@@ ju@@ ana and 14@@ 8 kil@@ o@@ gram@@ s of co@@ ca@@ ine , so the rec@@ ord@@ ings of the court were secured .
three men , according to the authorities , who worked as drivers , were arrested for poss@@ essing and selling mar@@ sh@@ al and the ko@@ k@@ ain intended .
they face the threat of imprison@@ ment in the event of a guil@@ t of between ten years and life .
in no@@ gal@@ es , ari@@ z@@ ona , s@@ mu@@ gg@@ lers are rel@@ ying on an extensive underground network of dra@@ in@@ age channels .
the tunnel is the eigh@@ th large pass@@ age that has been in san di@@ e@@ go since 2006 .
some of the largest tun@@ nels were built after the mari@@ ju@@ ana har@@ v@@ est in central mexico in october , which made the drug car@@ te@@ ls challenging , as they can quickly bring their product to consumers .
in 2010 , authorities found a 6@@ 40 metr@@ e long pass@@ age with rail@@ s , which was taken from a kitchen in a residential house in ti@@ ju@@ ana to two sto@@ re@@ houses in san di@@ e@@ go .

ve@@ gan@@ ism , according to le@@ x@@ ic@@ as , is subject to vege@@ tari@@ an@@ ism , but diff@@ ers from this in quite a significant way .
because while vege@@ tari@@ ans are eating food from sa@@ h@@ ne@@ -@@ ca@@ ke , ice or a strong e@@ da@@ -@@ her@@ b , these poor people are not on the menu .
milk , cheese , eg@@ g , besides giving up meat and fish , the ve@@ gan leaves the ve@@ gan with all the food from animal products - even hon@@ ey .
what remains , one might wonder , but when you look at it , ve@@ gan nutri@@ tion is characterised by a considerable degree of ing@@ en@@ u@@ ity .
&quot; bread stic@@ ks are very popular &quot; , explains ute hen@@ kel@@ mann , the owner of the hi@@ si@@ can reform house , who has a variety of special products for ve@@ gan .
also re@@ u@@ ben proc@@ tor visits the shop in the cathedral street .
for 13 years , the native new ze@@ al@@ and , ve@@ gan , has lived in l@@ amp@@ er@@ the@@ im ( almost ) everything he has to do . &quot; in 1997 i presented my di@@ et and became a vege@@ t@@ arian .
at the turn of the century , the next step was taken and i became ve@@ gan .
&quot; but the convic@@ tion came not only because of food , but because of foot@@ wear selection , &quot; proc@@ tor says , the artificial leather ordinary leather pre@@ fers normal leather .
he realized that there were also problems in other everyday matters without animal products .
ve@@ gan is a group of people who have a strong sense of eth@@ ics .
&quot; i do not want animals to die for me , &quot; says proc@@ tor the ma@@ xi@@ m of ve@@ g@@ ans , who are focused on the whole consumption behaviour .
instead of bur@@ gers , sti@@ r@@ rers or rubber bears , the european union has a new ve@@ gan experience .
&quot; it is a double bonus , &quot; proc@@ tor says today , &quot; actually , ve@@ gan does not make his ren@@ un@@ ci@@ ation , not an as@@ c@@ ence , but rather an en@@ rich@@ ment &quot; .
and it is precisely these conditions that have left many well-@@ inten@@ tioned attempts to fail .
&quot; the ad@@ dic@@ tive factor is a very decisive factor that leaves many quickly abandoned , just like smoking , &quot; pro@@ c@@ tor makes a comparison .
and if one applies : &quot; certain tas@@ tes are not fixed at the animal &quot; .
often it is the sp@@ ices or the type of preparation that make up the taste .
&quot; you can also use the same effect in other ways , &quot; explains the ve@@ gan .
a bar@@ bec@@ ue will take place at proc@@ tor , for example , in the open air , in the mus@@ h@@ rooms and in the ve@@ gan cu@@ ps .
it takes care of balanced , varied di@@ et , where there is a good deal of f@@ at .
of course , you want to have something between your te@@ eth , that is legitimate .
&quot; it should taste , but that is not only animal food , but also food , &quot; said proc@@ tor .
health damage , including eating dis@@ orders , further widespread as@@ sumption , has not been suffered .
for me , the change@@ over has had a positive aspect .
i don &apos;t take a foreign cho@@ le@@ ster@@ ol and have a higher vit@@ am@@ in content .
there are high performance sa@@ tel@@ li@@ tes that are exclusively nutri@@ tional to ve@@ gan .
&quot; my blood values are good , i often let myself check , &quot; he tells pro@@ c@@ tor .
in particular , the lack of vit@@ am@@ in b@@ 12 war@@ ns many ve@@ gan@@ si@@ us cri@@ tics .
&quot; since animals are fed with feed@@ ing@@ stuffs rather than being fed on pa@@ st@@ ures , it is question@@ able whether there is a proper meat in the meat that is being bought in the re@@ fri@@ ger@@ ator .
for ve@@ g@@ ans , there is also the possibility to use the co@@ en@@ zy@@ me in the form of tab@@ lets .
&quot; my b@@ 12 values are fine , &quot; he explains .
the main reason for this is that proc@@ tor has to go far in the area of food procurement .
basic food@@ stuffs are available everywhere and every super@@ market has now produced so@@ ya milk and other products .
all i need is a very good idea .
only occa@@ sion@@ ally i buy something special .
&quot; many people over@@ look that just the finished products are expensive , but so beha@@ ves like that in &quot; ordinary &quot; finished products known to be the same . &quot;
in any case , the preparation of ve@@ gan dishes is much cheaper and less time@@ -@@ consum@@ ing than the usual pre@@ sumption .
&quot; in the kitchen there is a lot to discover , with a few small k@@ ni@@ ff@@ es you can buy good , if not partially better results , &quot; proc@@ tor says .
mar@@ gar@@ ine instead of but@@ ter , a little more ba@@ king pow@@ der and car@@ b@@ onic ac@@ id instead of eg@@ g , with its ve@@ gan cheese ca@@ kes , proc@@ tor could also am@@ a@@ ze his paren@@ t@@ s-@@ in-@@ law .
family celebra@@ tions give ve@@ gan a new sp@@ ice .
this has dynam@@ ism when you co@@ ok together , it has a new significance .
&quot; the situations that can arise are so different as the people themselves , &quot; says proc@@ tor .
of course , he has already been met with s@@ cep@@ tic@@ ism .
does my food not taste you ?
&quot; should i feel bad now because i drink milk ? &quot; - when i do that , i have to ask as a ve@@ gan to be fing@@ er@@ printed .
&quot; i do not deny people , i am part of this society , &quot; proc@@ tor does not want to be an enc@@ la@@ ve .
and , more precisely , the everyday world does not seem so ve@@ gan@@ istic as it is susp@@ ected - and ve@@ gan does not seem so restricted in everyday life as it is generally assumed .
fast food is also allowed .
pom@@ es gi@@ b@@ t es gan@@ z !
&quot; many d@@ ö@@ ner shops offer fal@@ a@@ fe@@ l , or even a vege@@ t@@ arian yu@@ f@@ ka , &quot; proc@@ tor says .
in a piz@@ zer@@ ia he swit@@ ches to pa@@ sta dishes , or just orders a piz@@ za without cheese , everything a question of hab@@ it .
the restaurants are slowly starting to face it .
&quot; when i started 13 years ago ve@@ gan became a di@@ et , everything was still much more difficult &quot; , the nov@@ el@@ ist can take a development that will help to make the world more comfortable .
&quot; if enough en@@ qui@@ ries are made , they may be inc@@ lined to make an addition to the menu , &quot; he hopes .
ve@@ gan restaurants develop , such as com@@ bus@@ tion in man@@ n@@ heim or the café vo@@ gel@@ fre@@ i .
proc@@ tor wants to see other restaurants at least have a ve@@ gan dish on the menu .
in fact , ve@@ gan dishes are there for everyone .
everyone can eat it , so they are exactly the opposite of exclusive .
&quot; meat dishes are exclusive , on the other hand , in the tru@@ est sense of the word , because they exclu@@ de others , &quot; proc@@ tor notes .
&quot; when you avoid food scand@@ als , ve@@ g@@ an@@ ism is a safe way to prevent the vast majority of all the pre@@ jud@@ ices . &quot;
ve@@ gan purch@@ ases may , however , be a little difficult at the beginning .
especially when you learn to understand that is also in pe@@ an@@ u@@ ts animal addi@@ tives as color en@@ co@@ ders , you seem to be satisfied with observ@@ ing the eth@@ ics on so many hur@@ d@@ les and fast fall the courage to leave .
not only because of this , re@@ u@@ ben proc@@ tor and lars th@@ om@@ sen have written a book : &quot; ve@@ gan@@ is@@ sim@@ o - animal ingredients and their alternatives &quot; explains the many ingredients that make up food but also clean@@ sing .
&quot; gradually , a scan@@ ner view is developed and white is the characters and lo@@ gos to be observed &quot; it is sometimes better to take small steps than standing on the screen or to st@@ um@@ ble &quot; , says proc@@ tor .
ve@@ gan@@ ism , it is an important moral fing@@ er , which is aimed at consci@@ ousness .
perhaps he will not quite manage to change his hab@@ its , but at least he can help consumers to make their hab@@ its critical .
the exchange operator nas@@ da@@ q om@@ x keeps its customers in bre@@ ath .
trade in the nas@@ da@@ q options market was closed on friday afternoon german time .
in a communication the operator made technical problems responsible .
the other ele@@ ven us option markets , including two of the nas@@ da@@ q om@@ x , continued their business un@@ h@@ inde@@ red .
the recent incident has led to a whole series of smaller and larger break@@ down@@ s in the stock market operator .
only on tuesday the inde@@ xes of the nas@@ da@@ q were closed due to errors in the data transport for an hour .
in august this year , in a week alone , two break@@ down@@ s occurred .
first , the us investment bank gol@@ d@@ man s@@ ach@@ s had found a huge number of fa@@ ul@@ ty purchase orders to option markets because of technical problems .
in response , the stock exchange operators needed to pay for the order almost a whole day and to cancel it .
two days later , half of the total us stock market came to a stand@@ still due to a computer break@@ down in the nas@@ da@@ q stock exchange for several hours .
the first of the last years of the stock market of fac@@ e@@ book was also a big surprise .
the nas@@ da@@ q systems were the flo@@ od of purchasing and sales orders and the resulting down@@ turn in the market .

scotland yard stated that it was not allowed to give the 4@@ 0-@@ year-@@ old austr@@ ali@@ an a “ invitation to stand up ” that made him appear in a police station .
ass@@ ange threat@@ ens to return to sweden for the charges against a sexual journ@@ alist who has been accused of having been able to do so under british law .
as he fears stockholm will not be able to send him to the united states , on 19 june he had a meeting with the ecu@@ ad@@ ori@@ an emb@@ ass@@ y in london and the south american country had asked for political asylum .
scotland yard has “ a 4@@ 0-@@ year-@@ old man has been asked to take a stand on a project at a time we have chosen . ”
it also vio@@ lates the conditions of his release on ba@@ il .
the message did not comment on the delivery of the police call .

tax on foreign property owners against london &apos;s bu@@ b@@ ble
the treas@@ ury has provi@@ sion@@ ally issued the c@@ g@@ t measure , but is still waiting for the final decision .
already , the revenue from the st@@ amp tax on housing in the districts of western min@@ ster and ken@@ sing@@ ton &amp; ch@@ el@@ sea exce@@ eds the tax rate of 20@@ 12 / 13 at 7@@ 08 million p@@ ounds .
co@@ ok said , “ after the ste@@ m@@ pl@@ -@@ tax increases on high-@@ price housing and the introduction of the associated legislation against a circum@@ v@@ ent , it is hard to say that high quality properties are too low tax@@ ed , regardless of the impact .
“ but this move could be a re@@ luc@@ t@@ ant move by some foreign investors in buying real estate in london , or by preventing owners from selling them , ” he added .
first class real estate – the top five to ten percent of the housing market at price – in the weal@@ thy sou@@ th@@ west bel@@ t of london , which is bor@@ dered by ful@@ ham to w@@ im@@ ble@@ don , has grown around the corner .
central london prices were uniform , for example , at 5.@@ 5 % per year , but were not adjusted by an emerging “ inf@@ an@@ try market . ”
scientists could sh@@ ed more light on the context in which the pregn@@ ancy of a dog is related to its mo@@ od .
earlier research showed that gam@@ bling is a very good way to get a better chance of getting a good dog .
but now scientists say that other dogs will not accept these sub@@ tle differences and can respond to them .
professor geor@@ gio v@@ all@@ or@@ ti@@ gar@@ a , a neu@@ ros@@ ci@@ enti@@ st at the university of tren@@ to , said : “ it is well known to humans that the left and right half of the brain can react differently to stimul@@ i , positive or negative .
here we have tried to take this on board other species .
he also noted that in dogs , just like in humans , the right half of the brain is responsible for movement on the left side and vice vers@@ a , and that the two h@@ emis@@ p@@ he@@ res have different roles in emo@@ tions .
to learn more about how dogs can be pus@@ hed on the side tail sle@@ eve of their compan@@ i@@ ons , the for@@ ci@@ bly supervis@@ ed the animals while these films were being shown by other dogs .
they measure the heart rate of the four-@@ leg@@ s and analy@@ zed the behaviour .
we will probably soon understand why the tail is getting into one , sometimes in the other .
professor v@@ all@@ or@@ ti@@ gar@@ a said : “ we have seen the dogs movies with dogs – either a natural or a true version of the dog .
when the animals saw how an otherwise vo@@ la@@ tile dog had to take the tail to the right ( from the perspective of the we@@ aring dog ) , the dog was left with a completely relaxed bre@@ ath .
but was the co@@ ck tend@@ ency mainly to the left ( again from the dog &apos;s perspective , the dog we@@ del@@ t ) , their heart rate increased and they saw un@@ rest .
professor v@@ all@@ or@@ ti@@ g@@ ara comm@@ ented that the dogs do not inten@@ tionally communicate with each other through these movements .
it is rather convinced that the dogs have learned from experience , which movements they feel concerned about .
he said , ‘ if you have different encoun@@ ters with other dogs and you want to make we@@ av@@ ing with the tail in a direction more linked to friendly behavior and the right side is a less friendly behavior , then you are respon@@ ding on the basis .
researchers say that the findings h@@ oun@@ ded dog owners who had been using them , ve@@ ts and tra@@ in@@ ers , to understand the emo@@ tions of their animal .
john br@@ ad@@ sha@@ w , expert for dog behaviour and hospitality grants , has been working on the fac@@ ul@@ ty of animal health at the university of bri@@ st@@ ol , which said that this was not the first study to be examined whether it was necessary .
last year a team of the university of l@@ inc@@ ol@@ n found that dogs had to turn their head to the left when they had an aggres@@ sive dog , and to the right when it was a bre@@ eding dog .
in another research at the university of victori@@ a in canada , the following was : “ dogs go to a robo@@ t dog rather than a dog . ”
according to his statement , the differences could be caused by the dogs being the animals in the fil@@ m@@ s. the ro@@ bot@@ -@@ dog is not considered as dogs .
a study of how dogs are respon@@ ding to real dogs could help , he explained .
“ while there is considerable evidence for many different m@@ am@@ m@@ als that the two bra@@ ins are responsible for various purposes , the two have to be considered in detail .
but as their behavior is simply recorded , it will probably not take long before we understand that the problem is not a problem .

po@@ pe franc@@ is appointed the president of the republic of cyprus in february .
po@@ pe franc@@ is will be arrested for the first time on 22 february for new car@@ din@@ als of the catho@@ lic church , as the v@@ ati@@ can announced on thursday .
car@@ din@@ als are the most senior cl@@ er@@ ics in the catho@@ lic church after the po@@ pe and they are the ones who have a po@@ pe .
there are currently 20@@ 1 car@@ din@@ als .
however , a car@@ din@@ al who has an age of 80 can no longer participate in the po@@ pe election – the result is a group of 120 “ eligible voters . ”
in a statement that announ@@ ces the news , pat@@ er feder@@ ica said l@@ om@@ bar@@ di that a speaker of the v@@ ati@@ can was saying that it would be a meeting of all car@@ din@@ als before the cere@@ mony was held .
“ po@@ pe franc@@ is decided to re@@ consider his decision to conven@@ e the consistent story of the february 2010 congress .
j@@ ack val@@ ero of catho@@ lic vo@@ ices said that the number of electoral eli@@ tes in the car@@ din@@ als was likely to have fallen by february .
he explained that a po@@ pe usually ap@@ points as many car@@ din@@ als as necessary to ensure that the number of eligible voters is reduced .
the consistency story next year is important because it is a key first since the election of france ’ s president in march this year .
there is a certain over@@ han@@ g on the part of europe at the moment , and particularly italy .
“ it will be interesting to see if the new po@@ pe car@@ din@@ als came from the rest of the world , to make the balance clear , ” he said .
for@@ ty per cent of ca@@ th@@ ol@@ ics live in south america , but they have only a tiny number of car@@ din@@ als .
the car@@ din@@ als will also be the first to have been awarded the prize since the formation of the council of car@@ din@@ als , founded by franc@@ is , a group of eight car@@ din@@ als from all over the world who have been appointed .
in the past , the po@@ pe decided everything alone .
&quot; now franc@@ is has the eight car@@ din@@ als chosen to give him a helping hand , &quot; said val@@ ero .
he said it was “ possible ” that franc@@ is was the car@@ din@@ al of the order to advise .
but so far we have not been in this situation – that is all quite new .
val@@ ero said that typically the bi@@ b@@ lic@@ al bis@@ ho@@ ps come from large places to car@@ din@@ als , but stick franc@@ is &apos;s “ full of surpris@@ es – we know not what he is .

some of the cars may have a def@@ ect in the mechanism for the re@@ stra@@ int of the front seat back@@ rest .
for this reason , they do not comply with the federal regulations on vehicle safety in head@@ re@@ sts .
&quot; when the vehicle is driven from the back , it is possible that the head re@@ stra@@ int will not lift passengers properly .
the returned models were shi@@ pped from august 1 to september 10 .
the delivery of g@@ m tr@@ uc@@ ks began in june and represents the most important model launch of the leading american car manufacturer since the in@@ solv@@ ency restructuring in 2009 .
g@@ m informed vehicle owners in the first october half of the year about the def@@ ect .
the n@@ h@@ t@@ sa was unable to reach a compromise because of the 16@@ -@@ day government shut@@ down@@ s , which had a negative impact on car sales .
the sale of sil@@ ver@@ ado and sier@@ ra tr@@ uc@@ ks , which are planned for the 20@@ 14 model year , has been a success in the first ten months of the year , g@@ m declared on friday .

desper@@ ation cr@@ y from an obama elec@@ tor@@ ate
i have elected president obama twice in the hope that change will be possible .
he says obama has comm@@ end@@ able efforts to address the bloc@@ k@@ ade detail of the republic@@ an party .
the bloc@@ king policy does not exc@@ use the site problems of ob@@ am@@ ac@@ are , the dr@@ one attacks on the internet , the dr@@ one attacks on the dr@@ one attacks on the internet , the dr@@ one attacks on the people .
obama ’ s mem@@ o@@ irs of the 2008 election campaign are a sad memory of what is possible .
na@@ than@@ i@@ el p. mor@@ r@@ is is a student in the second year at har@@ v@@ ard medical school .
i am reading a terrible sad letter at the moment .
it is a book i thought i had read , but it would not be worth my while the dis@@ mal second year of my medical studies .
it is called the aud@@ acity to win ( courage to win ) and describes the me@@ motion series .
when i talk to my patient ’ s records in the evening and go to bed , the book will lead me back to a time when politics inspired millions and followed a speech with a bre@@ ath .
the election became a lands@@ li@@ de victory and news spo@@ kes@@ men held , to justify the historic significance of this time .
my class@@ mates we@@ pt for joy and my parents gathered all newspapers , which they find .
a young team of vi@@ sion@@ aries was on the way to the white house and the nation was ready for change .
when obama took office in 2008 , he agreed to change his views from 82 % .
and then i close the book .
switch back to the present is a bad awa@@ k@@ ening , as if you were drawn from a dream .
it is difficult to recall these optim@@ istic times – they seem to be a v@@ ague memory , a sad memory , and a sad remin@@ der of missed opportunities .
in the years since i first voted , i have been able to change a little .
but it is simply not something i could have imag@@ ined .
i recognise the great and versa@@ tile things that obama has achieved , from which he has adopted the affir@@ ma@@ tive call for a new international health insurance scheme to the military withdrawal from the iraq war .
i agree that the party political bloc@@ k@@ ade should be avoided too much .
but after having heard the obama administration countless times to colleagues and acqu@@ a@@ int@@ ances , i am not satisfied with my explanation attempts .
i have a point of political des@@ pair .
the republic@@ an bloc@@ k@@ ade cannot explain why the inter@@ cep@@ tion of foreign heads of state is allowed .
it cannot explain why the national security agency has not collected data on the privacy of americans .
it cannot explain why an@@ war al-@@ aw@@ la@@ ki , a us president , has been imprison@@ ed without trial .
it does not justify the results of a report which states that the efforts of the white house to calm the media are the ‘ aggres@@ sive &apos; ... since the n@@ ine@@ teenth government &apos; .
and , most recently , it cannot exc@@ use the in@@ ability to make progress in the more than three years since the adoption of the affordable care act .
i do not know whether this is what i should have expected .
i can have understood that the government &apos;s work was the result of the previous political campaigns .
obviously , the office of depu@@ ty is not a predic@@ table course , as an opposition party and ran@@ dom events such as the new@@ town mass@@ ac@@ re have dominated public debate .
but when i look at the examples above , they seem to be largely determined by the government itself .
and that bo@@ thers me most .
i have re-@@ elected obama in 2012 , not because i am delighted with his candi@@ d@@ acy .
mit@@ t ro@@ m@@ ney posed a conf@@ using and un@@ sophisticated alternative .
i had the impression that a second term for obama , free from pressure from future elections , would fulfil the hope that we have been hearing about for so long .
but , with the decline in the approval rat@@ ings for obama below 45 % this week , returning to 2008 is a little more severe than the book ’ s return to 2008 .
it awa@@ k@@ ens in me the long@@ ing for the many promises that are dis@@ appe@@ aring .
this week i read a section in the book descri@@ bing how obama can make a serious loss against clin@@ ton in the us presidential election .
in a meeting with the election agents after the decision , he told his staff that they would have to come back on course and follow the purpose of their case .
“ i want us to re@@ discover our magic , ” he said .
we must remember who we are .
five years later , mr president , the commission and i could not give you more support .

cli@@ ve pal@@ mer claims that prime minister ton@@ y ab@@ bot@@ t has been a conflict of interest in paren@@ tal leave in the united states during paren@@ tal leave conflict .
the bil@@ li@@ on@@ air@@ e and me@@ p cli@@ ve pal@@ mer says , prime minister ton@@ y ab@@ bot@@ t is in conflict of interest in his paren@@ tal leave plans because his dau@@ gh@@ ters will become pregn@@ ant and therefore benefit from it .
the mining mag@@ n@@ at , located in a judicial dispute over the payment of 6 million dollars to co2 tax , is the most recent alleg@@ ation that the country has been left out of the table to ask whether it is in conflict .
the pal@@ mer united party could host up to four votes in the sen@@ ate , which are important for deci@@ ding whether the co2 and mining industry taxes should be abol@@ ished or reduced .
but pal@@ mer claimed that only ministers have conflicts of interest and that the dau@@ gh@@ ters of ab@@ bot@@ t were able to benefit personally from the laws .
“ he is in a major conflict of interest when it comes to paid paren@@ tal leave , because if a person is a pregn@@ ant , he has a right to life .
two months after the election , the pal@@ mer electoral commission declared its lead by 53 votes after the re@@ count officially declared the winner of the sun@@ shine coast congress .
pal@@ mer called for a revision of the voting coun@@ ting process so that it can be carried out more quickly .
ton@@ y ab@@ bot@@ t &apos;s dau@@ gh@@ ters fran@@ ces and brid@@ get .
if these elections were to take place two months after the end of the vote ?
“ we need a better system , ” he said .
why should we not have a system in which we can go in and store the data in a computer , then immediately choose and then go back to the office at 6 : 30 a.m.
pal@@ mer also cri@@ tici@@ zed the use of p@@ enc@@ ils when marking the bal@@ lot papers .
use them because they will then be wi@@ ped out if they are not pleas@@ ing to you ?
nowadays , to vote with p@@ enc@@ ils is incredible .
the electoral commission has examined the options for an electronic election and recently adopted a joint legislative proposal with new ze@@ al@@ and .
pal@@ mer , 59 , explained that to his policy an international airport for the sun@@ shine coast of was belonging to and that he would take his new office “ very seriously . ”
in a public office , it is about public service .
“ we are not seeking re@@ wards other than those of history , namely that we should be able to serve at a critical time of this community , ” he said .
r@@ bs sus@@ pen@@ ds two foreign exchange trad@@ ers
the royal bank of scotland has two deal@@ ers from its fore@@ x department , so two people who have been involved in the situation ; this is a further indication of how the situation has deterior@@ ated worldwide .
some of the world ’ s largest banks , including u@@ bs , bar@@ cla@@ ys , deutsche bank , and r@@ bs , confirmed that they had worked with the authorities in the investigation into the world ’ s largest financial market , where $ 5.@@ 3 tr@@ il@@ lion would change daily .
the two deal@@ ers would be the first r@@ bs employees to be found in the expanding investigation , which would be the scand@@ al of the lib@@ or inter@@ bank business .
the bank that has not comm@@ ented on sus@@ pensions has not confirmed that the fund has been in a state of emergency for information from authorities .
“ our investigations on this subject continue and we cooperate fully with the f@@ ca and other regulatory authorities . ”
last month , the people close to the situation stated that the r@@ bs had not read the records of em@@ ail@@ s and inst@@ ant messages sent by and to a former re@@ tail@@ er to the uk regulatory authority , the financial consulting .
this deal@@ er , richard us@@ her , had the r@@ bs 2010 left and is now to be replaced by his current position as european leader of the fore@@ x spot trading at j@@ p@@ mor@@ gan .
ro@@ h@@ an ram@@ ch@@ and@@ ani , head of the european spot trading at cit@@ i , was be@@ aten this week and mat@@ t gar@@ din@@ er , form@@ erly chief currency trad@@ er at bar@@ cla@@ ys and u@@ bs , was arrested this week by standard .
none of these trad@@ ers was accused of any mis@@ conduct .
inst@@ ant message group is a part of the us@@ her group of ban@@ kers in bar@@ cla@@ ys and ci@@ ti@@ group , said to the people close to the situation .
u@@ bs announced this week that they are taking steps against some of their employees after the swiss regulatory authority fin@@ ma declared that they would have a susp@@ ected breach of the law on foreign exchange at a number of swiss banks .
at least six authorities worldwide – the european commission , fin@@ ma , the swiss competition authority we@@ ko , the f@@ ca , the us justice ministry , and hong kong monetary authority – have been emplo@@ ying the latest technology .
h@@ s@@ bc , ci@@ ti@@ group , j@@ p@@ mor@@ gan and credit su@@ is@@ se also have started internal investigations or received requests from authorities for information , said with the situation familiar people .
banks are going through inst@@ ant messages and em@@ ail@@ s from several years in search of cases of mis@@ conduct .
the news of these investigations has been sent to re@@ tail@@ ers in one area that has been growing at a rate of prof@@ it@@ ability in recent years .
some ban@@ kers have tried to sh@@ ut down the aff@@ air and said that it was almost impossible to stop the vast and highly developed li@@ que@@ ous foreign@@ -@@ exchange market .
a leading trad@@ er noticed that , despite the enormous daily volume of foreign exchange trading , the frag@@ ment@@ ation of the liqui@@ dity between the various trading platforms was not a factor in the increasing use of internal platforms by banks .
the news came out the same day , when credit su@@ is@@ se announced that she had sent a trad@@ er of their london exchange tr@@ aded funds to a trad@@ er this week after he had been in a loss of just six million dollars at the end .
the bank promp@@ tly informed the competent authorities and co@@ operated with them .
“ we are sure that the deal@@ er has acted alone and that the matter is contained , ” cre@@ d@@ ite su@@ is@@ se said .
the f@@ ence on the be@@ ch@@ t@@ le-@@ p@@ lot pain@@ ted by the artist .
a group of citizens &apos; initiative , the swiss me@@ ado@@ w , has put the building f@@ ence on the be@@ ch@@ t@@ le-@@ p@@ lot on the spa promen@@ ade in bad her@@ ren@@ al@@ b .
moreover , clean@@ ed and wi@@ den@@ ed the foot@@ path , it says in a press release .
the planned covering of the dec@@ om@@ mis@@ sion@@ ing house in the re@@ ar part of the property was not allowed for security reasons , because the site threat@@ ens to sli@@ p off .
al@@ f@@ red ab@@ el , who currently man@@ ages the property , had the em@@ bel@@ lish@@ ment campaign with his colleague rein@@ hard dom@@ ke of the bi .
before the bi &apos;s action , a transparent with the message &quot; we are for it &quot; was appropriate .
this distur@@ bed the approximately 20 members of the citizens &apos; initiative little in their action .
your mo@@ tto on the big pos@@ ter was &quot; we are against building ru@@ ins &quot; .
in doing so , it wanted to respond to the threat of even larger ru@@ ins on the swiss me@@ ado@@ w - if the giant project fails one day .
in con@@ vers@@ ation with many pas@@ ser@@ s-@@ by before the construction site , it became clear that some citizens believe that it is possible to better manage the re@@ alization of the project of the city , although many have the same questions about the dimension of the bi presented project .
but they are beginning to re@@ sign because the city continues to delay these responses , it says on the part of the bi .
as has been said , public opinion has also been influenced by the may@@ or &apos;s statements .
may had a very good reason to say in the municip@@ al council that he would be afraid of the spa if the population were to vote against the plans for a bathing and wellness complex at the swiss spa area during the citizens &apos; decision .
some seem to be fri@@ ghten@@ ed , while others feel that they are being &apos; st@@ up@@ id &apos; attempts at black@@ mail .
the bi than@@ ked don@@ ors for the color and all help@@ ers .
ran@@ gn@@ ick ran@@ ked for sh@@ ir@@ is : man@@ e no s@@ wal@@ low king
r@@ al@@ f ran@@ gn@@ ick is so happy with the current high-@@ form of bun@@ des@@ lig@@ a table leader red bu@@ ll salzburg , so dis@@ appoin@@ ting was the sport@@ director of the &quot; bu@@ lls &quot; from the arbitr@@ ators .
&quot; there is a dangerous tend@@ ency at present for man@@ e and al@@ an to fall into the category of s@@ wal@@ low k@@ ings , &quot; he took the two off@@ ensive sp@@ id@@ ers on a press conference in salzburg on thursday .
the most recent reason for ran@@ gn@@ ick ’ s critique was yellow for man@@ e at the 3 : 0 ver@@ sus gr@@ ö@@ di@@ g last sunday , when the sen@@ eg@@ al@@ ese was given a alleg@@ ed show - the fre@@ e-@@ for@@ -@@ all .
&quot; a bl@@ at@@ ant mis@@ jud@@ g@@ ement , &quot; said ran@@ gn@@ ick , the re@@ fe@@ ree har@@ k@@ am as &quot; completely over@@ loaded &quot; .
har@@ k@@ am would also have played his part in the es@@ cal@@ ation between salzburg co@@ ach ro@@ ger sch@@ mid@@ t and gr@@ ö@@ di@@ g tra@@ iner ad@@ i h@@ ü@@ t@@ ter after the match .
his german comp@@ at@@ ri@@ ot was deci@@ de@@ dly def@@ ended : &quot; i would have beha@@ ved the same way in every single situation as ro@@ ger sch@@ mid@@ t . &quot;
sch@@ mid@@ t himself wants to be the first to have a contact with his colleague after the sch@@ arm@@ ü@@ tz@@ el with his wife .
i do not know why .
&quot; for i am the one who insul@@ ted , &quot; he stressed .
given the course of success , ran@@ gn@@ ick agreed to a pra@@ is@@ e@@ worthy achievement .
&quot; there are only two words for this : really good , &quot; he noted .
there is not much to be found .
the way in which the team has played is particularly impressive .
that is what we should do .
cad@@ res in winter transfer time will be difficult to achieve .
there are no great reasons to change .
&quot; except a player as@@ ks to be able to join the association , &quot; he said , ran@@ gn@@ ick made clear .
supreme court confir@@ ms obama ’ s health law
it is a great victory for the obama administration : the us supreme court decided to make a decision today that it is closely linked to bar@@ ack obama ’ s health law .
with five votes to four , the jud@@ ges rul@@ ed that the patient ’ s individual mandate was “ protection and affordable care act ” – forcing the us to accept the decision by 20@@ 14 .
the supreme judge john ro@@ ber@@ ts suggested that the united states should be on the side of the four more liberal members of the chamber , while jud@@ ges sc@@ alia , thomas , ali@@ to and ken@@ ne@@ dy decided against it .
the court also confirmed the remaining sections of the 2@@ 700 pages comprehensive law and provided for the legal provisions of the code of conduct .
the legal action against the law was initiated by 26 states and the national federation of independent states .
the law was adopted by all leading republic@@ an presidential candidates , including the ultimate challeng@@ er mit@@ t ro@@ m@@ ney , in the 20@@ 12@@ -@@ pre-@@ election campaign .
norway : nor@@ we@@ gian town is a place with giant mir@@ r@@ ors of light .
with huge mir@@ r@@ ors , the inhabitants of a nor@@ we@@ gian village have sh@@ ed light into their dark valley .
because of the low sun@@ set level , the vege@@ tation in ve@@ st@@ f@@ jor@@ d valley is falling from autumn to early spring , usually in the sh@@ ade of the surrounding mountains .
with three gi@@ gan@@ tic refl@@ ec@@ tors at 45 meters height , a centur@@ i@@ es-@@ old space was re@@ alised on wednesday .
&quot; finally ! &quot; , citizens s@@ wor@@ e ste@@ in@@ ar ber@@ g@@ s@@ land at the start cere@@ mony in the broad@@ cas@@ ter t@@ v@@ 2 .
some people in the valley were right to move sun@@ chairs , while others sat sun@@ gl@@ asses for safety .
until now , sun@@ -@@ hun@@ gr@@ y winter had to reach a nearby summit with a cable car .
ten years ago , the local artist martin an@@ der@@ sen presented the proposal to use mir@@ r@@ ors to ste@@ er ra@@ ys into the valley .
this basic idea was already in place since 19@@ 13 .
after several years of debate , the council finally had the 5 million cro@@ wn@@ s ( around 6@@ 15 000 euros ) expensive project adopted .
a similar construction has provided the italian alpine resort of vi@@ gan@@ ella with win@@ try sun@@ shine for several years .
post leaves very little to be left on sun@@ days .
&quot; many citizens will not notice it yet , the red do@@ ts for sunday nights will be in the streets of various letters .
a request from the f@@ dp confirmed this .
on sun@@ days and public holidays , only the post office building will be open in the ern@@ st lu@@ d@@ wi@@ g-@@ stra@@ ß@@ e 36 and the j@@ ak@@ o@@ b m@@ ü@@ ll@@ er-@@ stra@@ ß@@ e 1 in h@@ ü@@ t@@ ten@@ fel@@ d .
whether in ho@@ f@@ heim and ro@@ sen@@ gar@@ ten even empty sunday , i will say in response to the f@@ d@@ p &apos;s request that it be answered .
the social and youth policy spo@@ kes@@ person of the f@@ dp , fr@@ it@@ z r@@ ö@@ h@@ ren@@ bec@@ k , wants to make a check here .
sunday ev@@ asion is particularly important for termin@@ post , and it is a very important postal service .
&quot; these are the things that make this venture th@@ in despite the price increase for letters in january 2013 , and which are rad@@ ically and un@@ reasonable . &quot;
thomas bit@@ t@@ ner , group and city council chairman of the liber@@ als , supports his group colleague , mr b@@ ill@@ on : &quot; what an@@ no@@ ys me is the fact that k@@ nee@@ -@@ jer@@ k has changed the lead times here or even cancelled .
close to the citizens , the post office is miles away .
&quot; at least the mail@@ boxes in the districts of ne@@ us@@ ch@@ los@@ s@@ gar@@ ten and ne@@ us@@ ch@@ los@@ s@@ gar@@ ten must be emp@@ ti@@ ed again on sun@@ days &quot; , says bit@@ t@@ ner and ro@@ e@@ h@@ ren@@ bec@@ k un@@ is@@ on@@ o .
the city of the city was also subject to the rule that non-@@ mobile citizens should have to purchase a sunday vo@@ id mail@@ box on foot .
the first time that the city had been named after the city , the city council asked whether the city administration would be planning to hold talks with the post office about this matter .
may@@ or er@@ ich ma@@ i@@ er rep@@ lied that the post office did not communicate with lam@@ per@@ the@@ im .
he knows that there are no such cases in ho@@ f@@ heim .
your party has op@@ ted for priva@@ tisation .
&quot; then decisions are taken elsewhere , &quot; said ma@@ i@@ er .
the price of the parking is to rise shar@@ p@@ ly .
the hotel is located in a quiet street , but the rooms are very small and the breakfast is very expensive .
the mag@@ i@@ str@@ ate of the city is discussing a proposal this morning for traffic de@@ vo@@ tees ste@@ fan major ( green ) .
the parking fees are to be increased by 50 percent .
however , this is not to increase prices , but to increase the time inter@@ val of parking and parking ticket machines from 30 to 20 minutes .
in december , the city council will have to decide .
the retail committee of the i@@ h@@ k frankfurt considers this &quot; not a good idea &quot; .
the hotel was very clean and the staff were very friendly and helpful .
the traffic club germany believes that an increase after two decades &quot; is entirely appropriate and actually long over@@ due &quot; .
public transport will also be more expensive .
city of joy : quick action is a host of events that will surprise your hosts and your guests with a great deal of fun .
with a narrow cad@@ re , the lor@@ ds i of ts@@ v fre@@ u@@ den@@ stadt had to be replaced by the lor@@ ds of the sch@@ ill@@ er school gy@@ m@@ nas@@ tics in re@@ ut@@ ling@@ en against the t@@ g g@@ ö@@ n@@ ingen .
the el@@ ders were in contact with an experienced team but they were not able to find the right team .
but it soon became apparent that , even in terms of age , it was not satisfied with the rapid action taken by the city of fre@@ u@@ den@@ stadt .
with the hard and placed sur@@ charges , the g@@ ö@@ n@@ n@@ inger made extremely difficult .
repeatedly , they failed to implement the new technologies developed by sim@@ on sch@@ en@@ k and e@@ du@@ ard schul@@ z clean@@ ly across the middle of the network and were unable to escape the bloc@@ king .
two high first pri@@ zes clearly expressed the superi@@ ority of the fre@@ u@@ den@@ stadt in all matters .
in the face of this crus@@ hing and play@@ -@@ determin@@ ing performance , the third set was then slightly l@@ oud and sil@@ ently reduced to the 3 : 0 end level ( 25 : 13 , 25 : 14 , 25 : 22 ) .

in the b class , the mur@@ g@@ tal@@ hal@@ le in ba@@ i@@ er@@ s@@ br@@ on@@ n had the second ba@@ i@@ er@@ s@@ br@@ on@@ n and fre@@ u@@ den@@ stadt teams .
they provided a highly competitive two-@@ way round mat@@ ching that was a success .
ner@@ v@@ ousness on both sides caused a great deal of trouble , especially when the ball was taken up ; the pass@@ ports were also designed to be precise , sometimes with poor quality and sometimes with critical play scenes .
in this highly balanced meeting , the team agreed to a new approach to the t@@ v-@@ team of mar@@ c@@ us bl@@ as@@ u@@ tto , but the great physical effort and a pleasant commitment of both teams .
the day of care at the small eng@@ lish@@ -@@ speaking hu@@ t
the fifth nur@@ sing day in the after@@ mat@@ h of the natur@@ a 2000 project ob@@ ere ho@@ tz@@ en@@ wal@@ d met a group of dedicated participants at the small eng@@ lish@@ -@@ speaking hu@@ t in ib@@ ach .
on the basis of popular suggestions , a new approach should be adopted on this day in the cab@@ in of the view into the valley , said may@@ or hel@@ mu@@ t ka@@ is@@ er .
many hi@@ kers , according to emper@@ or , referred to this area as the g@@ lit@@ tering piece of the gor@@ ge on which the landscape is situated , the ideal setting for wonderful views .
he than@@ ked those present for their willingness to cooperate and stressed that the care@@ rs day was a suitable day for taking care of the connection between people and nature .
it offers every citizen the opportunity to live in nature and to make his own choices .
the hotel is also close to the tourist attractions and the ecological aspects .
this ecological aspect was explained by fri@@ e@@ deri@@ ke tri@@ bu@@ ka@@ it from the department of nature conservation of the fre@@ i@@ burg government bureau following the welcome by land@@ r@@ at ti@@ l@@ man bol@@ l@@ ach@@ er , who was taken over the pat@@ ron@@ age .
the tourist destination of the view is the same as tri@@ bu@@ ka@@ it , with the aim of making the old everyday life that has grown to a large extent with its specific protected habit@@ at types .
certain species , such as rare but@@ ter@@ f@@ lies and gr@@ ass sup@@ porters , can create barriers in the form of forest areas .
you need these free links to maintain your species .
tri@@ bu@@ ka@@ it said she wanted to do it here .
i am also happy to say that the current measure does not only se@@ am@@ lessly integrate with this plan .
a bio@@ sphere reserve also offers the opportunity to make sustainable economic and ecological progress .
after these different designs , the chief of the area of the area , chri@@ stop@@ h we@@ h@@ le and life project manager cor@@ ne@@ lia bis@@ ch@@ off , divided the help@@ ers into groups .
the larger trees were already sm@@ ash@@ ed in the run@@ -up , the fore@@ stry trac@@ tor may be available for re@@ tri@@ eval .
a group of help@@ ers should be looking for the release of wa@@ x han@@ gers and care for a dry stone bar .
the aim was to have a free view at the view@@ point .

google , sam@@ sung , hu@@ a@@ we@@ i due to nor@@ tel patents , has been su@@ ed for a patent law@@ suit against the u.s. patent office .
the group that had thousands of previous nor@@ tel patents stric@@ ken the rules of procedure on thursday by an av@@ al@@ an@@ che of complaints for patent infringement against mobile phone manufacturers , including google , the company that was involved in the bank@@ rup@@ t@@ cy au@@ ction .
ro@@ ck@@ star , the con@@ sor@@ ti@@ um that is the nor@@ tel patents for usd 4.@@ 5 billion , is the first to claim sam@@ sung electronics ’ s “ co@@ . ltd . ” patent system .
ro@@ ck@@ star is owned by apple , microsoft , black@@ star , and the er@@ ic@@ s@@ son company .
google will use the term &quot; patent infringement &quot; in seven cases .
patents affect technology that allows search terms to be combined with relevant advertising on the internet .
sam@@ sung , hu@@ a@@ we@@ i , ht@@ c and ro@@ ck@@ star were not directly accessible .
sam@@ sung , hu@@ a@@ we@@ i and ht@@ c make mobile phones that work with google &apos;s operating system .
in 2011 , google launched an initial bid to make more than $ 9@@ 00 million available for nor@@ tel patents .
google increased its offer several times and offered last 4.@@ 4 billion us dollars .
after the nor@@ tel patents of ro@@ ck@@ star were over@@ bid , the company acquired a new name for its motor@@ ola mobility for $ 12.@@ 5 billion , a business that also partly bene@@ fi@@ ted from motor@@ ola ’ s library of patents .
“ although google failed in its attempt to make the case for the patent infringement at the au@@ ction , google has not yet infring@@ ed the patents and continues to do so , ” says the law@@ yer .
ro@@ ck@@ star claims a high amount of damages from google as it claims to have caused google &apos;s patent infringement inten@@ tionally , so the acc@@ us@@ ation .
egypt s@@ wor@@ n first freely elected presidents
mo@@ ham@@ med mor@@ si is the o@@ ath of authority , but his day of tri@@ um@@ ph is not likely to mark the end of egypt ’ s political disputes .
the islam@@ ist mo@@ ham@@ med mor@@ si promised a “ new egypt , ” when he was the first fre@@ el@@ ance president of the country to be s@@ wor@@ n in , thereby under@@ mining the succ@@ ession of hus@@ ni mu@@ bar@@ ak , who had been elected 16 months earlier .
with its in@@ aug@@ ur@@ ation in the supreme constitutional court , mor@@ si became the first freely elected islamic president of the arab world and egypt ’ s fifth head of state since the fall of the mon@@ arch@@ y some 60 years ago .
he put the o@@ ath before the 18 in black ro@@ bes dres@@ sed jud@@ ges of the court , which is located at the n@@ ile and has an ancient egyp@@ tian temple .
“ we are stri@@ ving for a better future , a new egypt and a second republic , ” said mor@@ si at the cere@@ mony that will take place live on state television .
“ today , the egyp@@ tian people have laid the foundations for a new life – absolute freedom , real democracy and stability , ” said the 6@@ 0-@@ year-@@ old mor@@ si , a us educ@@ ated engine@@ er and member of the muslim bro@@ ther@@ hood .
hundreds of soldiers and police officers guar@@ ded the building when mor@@ si was re@@ located shortly after 11 o &apos;@@ clock in a small car con@@ vo@@ y .
only a few hundred sup@@ porters had been gathered before the court to give the new president credit , and , unlike the presidential pr@@ un@@ k , the president of the mu@@ bar@@ ak era was only briefly arrested .
as an un@@ char@@ is@@ matic “ spare wheel ” of the bro@@ ther@@ hood , his personal presti@@ ge has been lost since his victory and a friday speech , when he was not only a candidate for the islamic republic of iran , but also a candidate for all of those present .
“ egypt is today a civil , national , constitutional , and modern state , ” said the president of egypt , who was in a blue suit with red ti@@ e , declared the jud@@ ges of the wooden church .
later mor@@ si went to the university of ca@@ iro , where he delivered his in@@ aug@@ ural address .
it was officially ordered by an army band that had been the an@@ them , who was able to play the national an@@ them in pos@@ session .
the military leader , fel@@ d@@ mar@@ sh@@ al hus@@ sein tan@@ ta@@ w@@ i , was present .
on his arrival , he was mur@@ dered by hundreds of people in the university ’ s largest aud@@ it@@ ori@@ um , with spo@@ kes@@ men from “ the army and the people are one hand . ”
the company , founded in 19@@ 08 as a bas@@ tion of sec@@ ular education , was founded by ca@@ iro university in the 197@@ 0 ’ s as a strong@@ hold of islamic student groups .
mor@@ si presented a symbo@@ lic o@@ ath on the ta@@ h@@ ir square on friday , the birth@@ place of the u@@ pris@@ ing that took place last year at the end of author@@ itarian mu@@ bar@@ ak ’ s rule , and he p@@ raised it .
but , with the im@@ position of official o@@ ath in the court , rather than in parliament as usual , it bo@@ ws to the will of the military , which indicates that the power struggle will continue .
mor@@ si ’ s speech at ta@@ h@@ ir@@ -@@ square was full of dramatic popul@@ ist ge@@ st@@ ures .

rap@@ ed people in south africa : two life imprison@@ ment
nine months after the brut@@ al ra@@ pe and mu@@ ti@@ lation of a 17@@ -@@ year-@@ old girl in south africa , the perpe@@ tr@@ ator was sent@@ enced to two life imprison@@ ment on friday .
this was reported by the sab@@ c station .
the victim was later suffering the consequences of serious in@@ jur@@ ies .
joh@@ ann@@ es k@@ ana was already at the beginning of the week of crime found guil@@ ty .
the act had hor@@ ri@@ fied nation@@ wide .
the then 21 year-@@ old had an@@ ene boo@@ y@@ sen in february in an industrial site in bre@@ d@@ as@@ dor@@ p near cape town .
14 hours the doctors fought for the survival of the victim , but in v@@ ain .
the sight of the young was so hor@@ ri@@ fic that the care@@ rs and si@@ sters were given psycho@@ logical assistance .
k@@ ana had ad@@ mitted during the trial that he had been with boo@@ y@@ sen in a bar during the night .
he also conf@@ essed to sm@@ ash and rap@@ ed them , but denied that they were responsible for the death of the girl .
the police were initially trained by several off@@ enders , but they dis@@ missed two susp@@ ects from prison because the occup@@ ying evidence against them was not sufficient .
the public prosecu@@ tor also stressed during the procedure that it was convinced that k@@ ana was not in a position to act at the time of the attack .
ra@@ pe is a crime in south africa : every year there are about 64 000 reports of sexual violence .
that is nearly ten times the amount in germany , but it is still significantly more inhabitants , with 82 million people than south africa ( 50 million ) .
police and women &apos;s associations in south africa appreciate the dar@@ k@@ ness of sexual violence at 10-@@ 2@@ 5-@@ times the rate .
jum@@ bo visits the black forest ham , the main dish of the island .
jum@@ bo looking for the &quot; best ham &quot; of the world : for the t@@ v-@@ show &quot; gal@@ il@@ e@@ o &quot; she visited the pro@@ 7-@@ star bon@@ n@@ dorf .
the speaker is right at the start to make it clear that the most important thing for ham is the pi@@ g &apos;s ec@@ eu@@ len@@ e , tur@@ bom@@ ast is not a good pre@@ requisite .
can ham , which can be bought in any super@@ market , that is , a quality product ?
ul@@ i , as head of the big ham factory in the black forest , declared jum@@ bo the operation of the company &quot; ad@@ ler &quot; in bon@@ n@@ dorf .
&quot; germany &apos;s favourite ham &quot; , as jum@@ bo put the black forest ham out , is a true example .
only with hair protection and kit@@ tel he comes into the interior of the factory .
jum@@ bo must also be able to dis@@ inf@@ ect his hands before he can get to the micro@@ phone .
jum@@ bo to strengthen your speed dial and to get a good bre@@ ath of fresh air .
&quot; here i get a lot of work , &quot; the tv ma@@ ke@@ -up artist , black forest ham as a mass product .
16@@ ,000 k@@ eu@@ w@@ ls speak for themselves every week .
weight , f@@ at content , color : ul@@ i explains what it is about quality .
most pi@@ gs are slau@@ gh@@ tered at six months .
television with a level ?
details such as the ph value of the meat also play a role .
the dar@@ ker the meat , the higher the ph value .
&quot; i am cur@@ ious if your ro@@ ber@@ to blan@@ co measure@@ ments what will happen then &quot; , says jum@@ bo zy@@ n@@ is@@ ch .
the level of private television is set in pure culture .
but watching is still wor@@ th@@ while .
the spec@@ t@@ ator sees that the dec@@ om@@ position of the cul@@ ls continues to be hand@@ cra@@ fted .

they thought travel agencies were part of the past thanks to the internet ?
flight centre seems to be resi@@ sting the trend .
the company has increased its profit prospects for the entire year and exp@@ ects record revenues from holi@@ day@@ makers in australia and the uk .
the travel company is now moving from adjusted annual ear@@ nings before taxes between 3@@ 25 and 3@@ 40 million dollars , compared to 30@@ 5 to 3@@ 15 million dollars in its previous forec@@ ast .
if the current target values are achieved , then this will mean growth of 12 % to 17 % compared to the record gain of 2@@ 9@@ 0.@@ 4 million dollars in the period 2011 / 12 .
as managing director gra@@ ham tur@@ ner announced , flight centre achieved a tur@@ nover of eight percent in the first half of the year and made a strong start into the second half , especially in australia and uk private business .
“ since the beginning of the year , our ten countries have been prof@@ itable , and some of them are well on the way to record annual income from interest and taxes , ” he said .
these include australia and great britain , which are typically among our strong@@ est ear@@ nings providers .
in australia , the leisure industry has grown stead@@ ily in the second half of the year , creating a slightly weak@@ er market for business trips .
it was equally good for the leisure business of flight centre in the uk , while here too business customers were spending less .
the us business reco@@ vered from a weak@@ er growth in the first half of the year due to seas@@ onal weak@@ ness , and thus achieved a profit for the entire year for the third con@@ secu@@ tive year .
the shares of flight centre increased by 3 c@@ ents yesterday to 3@@ 8.@@ 20 dollars .
schools will become more focused on mathem@@ a@@ tics , sp@@ elling , and gram@@ mar .
in courses on english literature , students must have at least one piece of sha@@ kes@@ pe@@ are , a novel of the 19th century , romantic ly@@ ric@@ s and contemporary literature from british history .
the test also includes “ un@@ seen texts ” to determine whether the text is to be read more widely .
the combined course from english literature and language is abol@@ ished .
from 20@@ 15 on@@ wards , pu@@ pil@@ s must undertake an independent g@@ c@@ se examination of language , with strong incentives to use english literature as a separate quali@@ fication .
the ministry of education will present the new cur@@ ricul@@ a for english and mathem@@ a@@ tics tomorrow – the first subjects that have been rad@@ ically re@@ designed .
other core subjects will be changed next year .
in a separate initiative , of@@ torture , the supervisory authority for aud@@ its , will propose a re@@ organization of the g@@ c@@ se structures , including a new ben@@ ding system and less course work .
in a speech in the summer , minister for education michael go@@ ve said that there is a “ broad consensus that we need to reform our audit system to restore public confidence , ” emphasi@@ sing that the g@@ cc ’ s would “ emerge . ”
studies show that in english schools less time is spent on mathem@@ a@@ tics – 1@@ 16 hours a year or three hours a week per school year – than in most other countries .
australia ’ s schools , on the other hand , te@@ ach an average of 14@@ 3 hours a year and students in sing@@ apor@@ e receive 13@@ 8 hours a day .
there will be no formal requirement to work in the timetable for the ma@@ ths , but it is not for ko@@ al@@ il@@ y-@@ ske@@ p@@ tic@@ ism that we should use the comprehensive mathem@@ a@@ tical examination , combined with a greater emphasis on the subject .
the cur@@ ricul@@ um focuses more on “ problems from the right life ” , including financial mathem@@ a@@ tics .

sal@@ em : joh@@ anna ra@@ h@@ ner at the ec@@ um@@ en@@ ical forum for talks in the ec@@ um@@ en@@ ical forum of inter@@ lo@@ cu@@ tors &apos; dialogue in berlin .
the next ec@@ um@@ en@@ ical forum on monday 21 october in the new museum of the castle will be devoted to the topic &quot; the hel@@ l with hel@@ l - the@@ ological considerations on today &apos;s handling of the last things &quot; .
lec@@ ture@@ r is professor joh@@ anna ra@@ h@@ ner .
the ec@@ um@@ en@@ ical forum for dialogue is an initiative of the catho@@ lic and ev@@ angel@@ ical church communities sal@@ em , the castle sal@@ em and the cultural council of bo@@ den@@ see@@ kre@@ is .
joh@@ anna ra@@ h@@ ner wants to look at the forum of how people are now using the &quot; last things &quot; after death .
if people had been convinced in the past centuries that they had been too much , and had been taken on the pictures of heav@@ en and hel@@ l , &quot; which still shape our ideas to this day , &quot; the contemporary pro@@ p@@ he@@ tic doc@@ tr@@ ine is draw from the contemporary pro@@ p@@ he@@ tic pro@@ ph@@ et .
&quot; the greater hope is christi@@ ans through the religious cri@@ tics belonging to a substantial degree . &quot;
she called &quot; we are so many question marks that the interpretation of the rules of procedure is not enough .
joh@@ anna ra@@ h@@ ner goes on to say : &apos; but the crucial challenge remains the an@@ no@@ y@@ ance of death &apos; .
this brings me to the question of that long@@ ing &apos; which dreams of the end of everything being good &apos; .
joh@@ anna ra@@ h@@ ner , born in 196@@ 2 in bad@@ en-@@ ba@@ den , studied law at the university of bad@@ en-@@ ba@@ den from 198@@ 2 to 1989 and studied catho@@ lic the@@ ology at the al@@ ber@@ t-@@ lu@@ d@@ wi@@ gs university .
she received her doc@@ tor@@ ate in 1997 as a dr. the@@ ol .
the basic pre@@ dis@@ position of the hab@@ ilitation for fundament@@ al@@ the@@ ology and ec@@ um@@ en@@ ical the@@ ology followed in 2003 at west@@ ph@@ ali@@ an wil@@ hel@@ ms university .
since 2010 , joh@@ anna ra@@ h@@ ner has been teaching a chair on systematic the@@ ology at the institute of catho@@ lic the@@ ology of the university of kas@@ sel .
ge@@ is@@ ling@@ en : more than 100 young ca@@ th@@ ol@@ ics from the small heu@@ berg confirm their belief in the name of the name of the church at the time of the birth .
in two services 10@@ 1 15@@ - and 16@@ -@@ year-@@ old te@@ en@@ age youth of the unit of the soul are tr@@ aded on the small heu@@ berg .
the church service was accompanied by the group lau@@ dat@@ o-@@ si in the morning , in the afternoon of the youth cho@@ ir the spirit .
with the reception of the fir@@ m@@ sac@@ ram@@ ent , the young people said yes to their b@@ ap@@ tism and asked for the power of the holy spirit .
the fir@@ m@@ l@@ ings had changed in recent months , under the direction of di@@ ak@@ on rein@@ er stra@@ h@@ ner and the help of many community members on the big day .
in different projects they learned different tasks of christian community life .
ill@@ men@@ see : second mountain bike tour in the alps .
in the case of good weather , 2@@ 14 cy@@ cli@@ sts came to ill@@ men@@ see to take the round trip across the hills around the lake .
the ul@@ rich kno@@ bel , which organiz@@ es the sports club ill@@ men@@ see , is also responsible for the organisation .
among the participants , especially at short distance over 15 kilometres and 300 metres of al@@ titude , were also numerous people .
two junior ri@@ ders of the top german class were also at the start of this race : fe@@ li@@ x bad@@ er from bad wal@@ d@@ see and pas@@ cal tre@@ u@@ bel from a@@ ach@@ -@@ lin@@ z came with the recommendation good plac@@ ements with the german champi@@ ons .
these two could , as expected , dis@@ appear from the field .
as in the previous year , fe@@ li@@ x bad@@ er was able to achieve a small advance to the finish line and def@@ ended his title as overall winner of short distance .
in second place , pas@@ cal tre@@ u@@ bel was again able to place himself in fi@@ u@@ bel .
the room was very clean and the staff were very friendly and helpful .
in second place , anne ade@@ le from ill@@ men@@ see and le@@ oni@@ e tre@@ i@@ ber from o@@ w@@ ingen came in .
a welcome development is the increasing number of drivers who have been able to live or work in the community .
not only in terms of performance , the whole range of athle@@ tes was represented .
the age structure was also sufficient for the youn@@ g@@ est up to 70 years of age at the oldest star@@ ters .
in the main race there were even more absolute top@@ a@@ them@@ s at the start this year .
four ri@@ ders were able to move away from the regional top ri@@ ders .
among them phili@@ p@@ p pan@@ ger@@ l , a mountain bike half-@@ pro from the black tus@@ k rac@@ ing team .
pan@@ ger@@ l was a member of the team and won two world champion@@ ships in the 12@@ -@@ hour world championship .
this year he was awarded european champi@@ on in this special discipline .
ro@@ land b@@ aller@@ ste@@ dt , who has already won two german champion@@ ships in the du@@ ath@@ l@@ on , also played a part in this .
after 45 kilometers and 9@@ 00 meters of al@@ titude , a di@@ zz@@ ying final was reached in the finish before the three-@@ second round of the lake .
pan@@ ger@@ l was the first to go over the finish line .
only a second behind it could be the rout@@ ine b@@ aller@@ ste@@ dt to win second in the overall rating .
at the same time , her@@ mann and war@@ th@@ mann were the third to reach the finish line .
in the women ’ s ran@@ king , christian co@@ h@@ s@@ mann was the fas@@ test time in the main race .
the second place was won by are@@ ane bl@@ er@@ sch from bin@@ dings in front of nat@@ as@@ ch@@ a wer@@ ner from stutt@@ gart .
athle@@ tes and help@@ ers were very satisfied with the smooth and well organized operation of the event .
along the way through mu@@ d , rivers and jun@@ g@@ le for free medical care ,
dr. geor@@ ges b@@ wel@@ le provides free medical assistance to remote villages in camer@@ o@@ on .
b@@ wel@@ le and his team spend almost every weekend to help hundreds of patients .
in the west african country , there are not many doctors , only one for 5@@ ,000 people , and only one for 5@@ ,000 people .
do you agree with this or your mobile device ?
dr. geor@@ ges b@@ wel@@ le is one of the top 10 of the “ c@@ n@@ n her@@ oes of 2013 ” .
you can create a new character for him or any of the other her@@ oes in the top 10 to make him the “ c@@ n@@ n her@@ o of the year ” .
the winner will receive $ 2@@ 50@@ ,000 to continue his exceptional work .
for 21 years , geor@@ ges b@@ wel@@ le saw his si@@ ck father again and again losing consci@@ ousness and becoming hospit@@ als .
j@@ ame@@ f b@@ wel@@ le was born in 198@@ 1 in the vicinity of y@@ a@@ oun@@ d@@ é , the capital of camer@@ o@@ on .
first he had only a broken arm , but then he formed a dis@@ inf@@ ected arm , which was on his face .
“ there was no neu@@ ro@@ sur@@ ge@@ ons in camer@@ o@@ on , ” says geor@@ ges b@@ wel@@ le .
we should have released it from camer@@ o@@ on if we had had had the money .
instead , b@@ wel@@ le spent years in over@@ crow@@ ding clin@@ ics and hospit@@ als , and spent many years with his father to improve treatment .
“ it is not easy , ” comm@@ ented b@@ wel@@ le .
it is possible to leave the house at five o &apos;@@ clock in the morning and race to the hospital to be the first , and it is not the first .
there are a great many patients .
some people even die because they have to wait .
the situation has hardly changed since b@@ well &apos;s father died in 2002 .
in camer@@ o@@ on , there is only one physi@@ ci@@ an for 5@@ ,000 people , according to the world health organization .
on the other hand , the relationship in the united states is with a doctor for 4@@ 13 people .
but even if there was a doctor for them , most camer@@ o@@ ons could not afford to visit .
two out of five people live below the poverty line in the country , and nearly three-@@ quarters of health spending in the country is private .
“ the only problem you have is poverty , ” says b@@ wel@@ le .
and poverty makes it impossible to enjoy life .
his father and so many of his comp@@ at@@ ri@@ ots suffered in b@@ wel@@ le , and decided to do something about it .
dr. geor@@ ges b@@ wel@@ le and his volunte@@ er team have last year carried out 700 free operations .
he became a doctor and worked as a v@@ as@@ cu@@ lar sur@@ ge@@ on in the central hospital in y@@ a@@ oun@@ d@@ é .
he also founded a non-@@ profit organization called as@@ co@@ vi@@ me , which is held in rural areas on week@@ ends and offers free medical care .
since 2008 he and his volunte@@ ers have contributed almost 3@@ 2@@ ,000 people .
almost every friday he and up to 30 people are forced to move into mini@@ buses and drive with the s@@ no@@ o@@ ted medical equipment on the roof over un@@ pav@@ ed ter@@ rain into the villages that need help .
not always everything goes smo@@ o@@ thly .
more than once , they had to drive the vehicles through rivers and mu@@ d .
but when they arrive , they will be received like her@@ oes : a fe@@ ast , voc@@ als and dance , and the best accommodation that the place has to offer .
in these villages , free healthcare is really a reason to celebrate and b@@ wel@@ le – with its wide sm@@ ile and its limit@@ less energy – is happy to help with the happy celebr@@ ation .
the next morning the team will start exam@@ ining hundreds of patients .
“ for each trip we treat 500 people ” , says b@@ wel@@ le .
they come from a distance of 60 kilometers around the village – and that is on foot .
each of these weekly clin@@ ics offers medical care in a number of areas .
many people are arrested for mal@@ aria , tu@@ ber@@ cu@@ lo@@ sis , mal@@ nutri@@ tion , di@@ abe@@ tes , par@@ a@@ sites , and sex@@ ually transmitted diseases .
others get cr@@ ut@@ ches , don@@ ated gl@@ asses or free birth certific@@ ates – a document that is required for the school , but that takes many poor families away .
in the evening , the team will perform simple operations with local an@@ aes@@ the@@ sia .
operations are normally carried out in a school , town hall or apartment ; after the entry , the patient is on the receiving end and go to the recre@@ ation area to make room for the next .
the lighting for the op and the dis@@ inf@@ ection equipment is controlled by the gener@@ ator of the group and so work b@@ sha@@ ft and its volunte@@ ers to the early morning hours on sunday .
it is a hard task , but the village musicians are helping to make the team mo@@ tivation and to make it a success .
&quot; they dr@@ um@@ mer all night , so that we can stay awa@@ ke and continue our work , &quot; says b@@ wel@@ le .
on sunday the team will return to the city , ti@@ red but proud of the work done .
the group – a mix@@ ture of camer@@ o@@ on doctors and foreign medical students – has won 700 free operations last year , and knows that they are making a huge difference to people .
one man explained that the free operation of a broken load he had received was a success .
“ this is changing the future of my family , ” said the man .
in addition to the weekend clin@@ ics and his work as a sur@@ ge@@ on in the hospital , b@@ wel@@ le also works at night in private clin@@ ics in y@@ a@@ oun@@ d@@ é .
with this second job he finances 60 % of his non-@@ profit activities , so b@@ wel@@ le ; the rest come from private don@@ ations .
“ i really do not know when he sle@@ eps , ” says k@@ ati@@ e o &apos;@@ mal@@ ley , who died at the dre@@ x@@ el university in phil@@ ade@@ l@@ phi@@ a medicine in the second year and volun@@ tar@@ ily went to b@@ well .
it is always either in the hospital or trying to raise money for the organization so that it can go to these campaigns .
for medical and nur@@ sing students , such as o &apos;@@ mal@@ ley , who come from the us and europe and support the b@@ wel@@ le , this is an opportunity to gain practical experience that they never get at home .
“ we can be involved in operations where we help to dis@@ solve blood or to use the instruments for dr. b@@ wel@@ le , ” explains o &apos;@@ mal@@ ley .
that would be a bad thing in america as a medical student in the second year .
students pay for their journey to camer@@ o@@ on themselves and often bring san@@ itation material to the school .
but once you &apos;ve been in y@@ a@@ oun@@ d@@ é , b@@ wel@@ le will take over the accommodation , transport and instruc@@ tion .
“ he is without doubt a her@@ o , ” says o &apos;@@ mal@@ ley .
he dedic@@ ates his life to this organisation and his desire to help the camer@@ o@@ on people knows no boundar@@ ies .
for b@@ wel@@ le , almost constant work is no burden .
to make others happ@@ i@@ er and thus to make a promise , which he has given his father , is a great pleasure for him .
“ i am so happy when i make this work , ” says b@@ wel@@ le .
i am thinking of my father .
i hope he will see what i do .
i do it to bring people back to lau@@ gh and to overcome the pain .

excellent fighting , the team has been able to make the fight a success .
the role of s@@ anti@@ ago , the old man in hem@@ ing@@ way nov@@ elle &quot; the old man and the sea &quot; , is hor@@ st jan@@ son on the ligh@@ ter b@@ ones .
jan@@ son is an old hand in his own me@@ ti@@ er , the art of acting .
the old man s@@ anti@@ ago cannot be left to fish .
the two simply comple@@ ment each other in a great way .
it is almost said that the fol@@ ds in the nec@@ k of the old man , of whom the fishing boy is talking , can be seen .
if s@@ anti@@ ago is ti@@ red of life on the chair si@@ ted , it is a good idea at jan@@ son .
in addition , the role of the old fisher@@ man is a distinc@@ t character that jan@@ son has excell@@ ently mas@@ tered .
hem@@ ing@@ way told the story of a figh@@ ter , a cour@@ ageous man who was not giving up and was ultimately defe@@ ated by his knowledge and his strength of will , by the fight against the fish .
jan@@ son was a member of the star trek : voy@@ ager series episode &quot; the best of the worl@@ ds &quot; .
it man@@ ages to attract the audience ’ s attention and to make sure that the audience ’ s mono@@ lo@@ gues don ’ t get bo@@ red for a moment .
his efforts to finally bring the fish to the surface of the water are as genuine as the bre@@ e@@ ze that the spec@@ t@@ ators forget that the sea is only lit from blue water bott@@ les .
director j@@ ens has@@ sel@@ mann leaves the old man on board in front of the fishing village .
in the course of the performance , he puts the active scene in the light : the hu@@ t of s@@ anti@@ ago , the bar of sing@@ er mari@@ e-@@ lu@@ ise gun@@ st , which with her songs and her splendid voice will make the life easier .
the four musicians play cuba ’ s rhy@@ th@@ m and are guests of the bar .
tourism : des@@ cent to the roman@@ s
the hotel is situated in the heart of the old town of cologne , only a few steps from the main railway station .
if you are visiting cologne , you will not be missed by the cathedral .
about 15@@ 7 meters high , the two to@@ wers rise into the sky and make it the second highest church in europe .
but few visitors who visit the two f@@ ili@@ gre@@ e church to@@ wers can see az@@ er@@ oth .
ra@@ iner schul@@ ze is an expert in cologne &apos;s under@@ world .
meeting point for his guided tours is the service center of cologne tourism directly at the dom .
the tour starts in an un@@ spectacular way : &quot; we start in the underground garage &quot; , says schul@@ ze .
in the 197@@ 0s , the city &apos;s fa@@ thers wanted to build a city that is suited to their cars , and so the remains of the old city wall remained only what was not too big .
most users of the multi-@@ sto@@ rey car park are therefore also hur@@ ting at the roman remains and only cars .
but if you look more closely , you will discover a new , me@@ tal@@ -@@ gri@@ d structure in the d@@ 2 parking dec@@ k .
the view is about five meters high ru@@ ins of hand@@ -@@ made stones .
&quot; it is the remains of the roman city wall that were destroyed in the second half of the first century after christ , &quot; he tells schul@@ ze .
before returning to the day@@ light , schul@@ ze leaves participants on the upper floor of the park a look into a dark and dark , 15@@ -@@ metr@@ e sha@@ ft .
this is the well of the old cathedral , which unfortunately is hardly noticed .
next station of the tour is the pre@@ tori@@ um , and here the participants go down again into the depth .
we are witn@@ essing the official seat of the once most powerful man north of the alps , the pre@@ cur@@ sor of the c@@ ca@@ a .
what c@@ ca@@ a means is that a visitor wants to know .
&quot; the ab@@ bre@@ vi@@ ation stands for &quot; col@@ onia cla@@ u@@ dia ara ag@@ ri@@ pp@@ in@@ en@@ si@@ um &quot; , which in a good german means &quot; city roman right and city of ag@@ ri@@ pp@@ ina &quot; .
and the pre@@ tori@@ um is the former for@@ tress of st. peter , which was the centre of power of the roman empire on the rh@@ ine .
from the entrance hall of the exhibition , a tunnel access to the roman se@@ wer@@ age canal , which is being maintained here at about 120 meters in length .
&quot; you can qui@@ e@@ tly take a piece along the so-called clo@@ ac@@ a maxim@@ a if you want , &quot; she bra@@ ve schul@@ ze the guests up .
one surprise still has schul@@ ze .
after being paid at the cash desk , he will take the group to a 16 meter deep , then walk to the main square .
&quot; we are now in the mi@@ k@@ we , a rit@@ ual jewish bath , &quot; he explains .
the jewish community built its bathroom deep into the ground to adapt to the gr@@ ound@@ water that was used for rit@@ ual washing .
to date , at the bottom of the mi@@ k@@ we , whose origin@@ s date back to the eigh@@ th century , different water levels have been caused by changing levels of the rh@@ ine .
the mi@@ k@@ we is part of an archae@@ ological zone on the town hall square for which the construction work will begin shortly .
until completion , however , some years will pass .
le@@ g almost h@@ acked : new edition of ro@@ ck@@ er process .
a bloo@@ dy attack in the ro@@ ck@@ er@@ mil@@ eu will be re@@ sumed after more than four years .
a trial for attemp@@ ted killing , dangerous physical in@@ jury and damage to property against two thir@@ ty years old has been fil@@ ed before the district court of frankfurt ( oder ) .
it is supported by strict security measures .
the def@@ end@@ ants remain silent for the start .
they are supposed to have been active in the ro@@ ck@@ er scene and have been part of the band@@ it@@ os at that time .
the public prosecu@@ tor acc@@ uses them of having , in june 2009 , taken to court in fin@@ ow@@ furt , together with unknown accompl@@ ices , three men in a car and taken on .
all victims were seriously in@@ ju@@ red , a man would almost have lost his le@@ g .
victims are to become compe@@ ting groups hel@@ l &apos;s ang@@ els .
one is to be a high-@@ ran@@ king member from berlin .
the pre@@ mise was apparently a hun@@ t for persecu@@ tion with several cars .
the charge was about the area of the fighting of the re@@ ign of au@@ gu@@ st@@ us and a demonstration of power .
the two def@@ end@@ ants were in a first trial at the beginning of 2012 .
a court spo@@ kes@@ man said then that it did not have the opportunity to prove that men were interested in the bloo@@ dy f@@ eu@@ d .
the perpe@@ tr@@ ators had carried mas@@ ks and had not been recognized .
the federal court of justice lif@@ ted the judgment after the revision of the public prosecu@@ tor &apos;s office and re@@ war@@ ded it for the district court .
one of the def@@ end@@ ants is currently being held in open for another off@@ ence .
the first time was the introduction of the re@@ building of the processes in tat@@ n@@ ach@@ t .
as a witness , the commissioner who was then investig@@ ating was loaded .
the focus was on mobile phone calls from the def@@ end@@ ants and other people who had been inter@@ cep@@ ted by the police .
it is difficult for ro@@ ck@@ ers to almost always remember a man who is e@@ ter@@ nal in court - not to say .
this also applies to the victims .
in the first trial , only one of the victims had been paid out .
public prosecu@@ tor ste@@ fan gol@@ fi@@ er of the public prosecu@@ tor &apos;s office in frankfurt ( or ) said on request that new don@@ ations have been made since the last trial .
ele@@ ven other negotiating parties are required for the process .
the dispos@@ able society does not think that it is a society which is dis@@ placed does not think it is a society which does not think it is not thinking of the future .
the night was long , the music l@@ oud and the mo@@ od good , but eventually it goes home .
but in the trees of people on the fron@@ t-@@ passenger and re@@ ar seat the hun@@ ger is notic@@ eable .
of course , some cock@@ tails may be a good idea .
what could be more obvious than ch@@ ill@@ -@@ out for the next dri@@ ve-@@ in to get a little bit of a treat ?
i admit that i am happy to be with you when it comes late at night or early in the morning .
a few pom@@ mes , a col@@ a , a bur@@ ger - and then ni@@ x as home and in bed !
but on the way home , the obvious differences between me and other hun@@ gr@@ y dis@@ co go@@ ers are notic@@ eable .
what should you miss out on the fact that you can always check your fa@@ st-@@ food bags from the car window with constant regul@@ arity ?
the hotel is located in the centre of the city , close to the main shopping street and the main shopping street .
&quot; why ? &quot; i wonder .
are people too do@@ of to put the bags home ?
it is not only the case that the paper product dis@@ charges the landscape .
bags have already been equipped with transport facilities such as control panels , which has caused accidents .
what does the word &quot; dispos@@ able society &quot; think about , but not after , probably she does not even know what that word actually means .
the hotel is very close to the main train station and the bus stop is very close .
there would be a few bags more or less even no@@ where - unlike the street , where no one is on the food resi@@ du@@ es of other rum@@ b@@ les .
i can already see the day when cities and municip@@ alities will be given the opportunity to make their way - and the facts are already there .
obama ’ s re@@ tr@@ action in health policy
after a heavy criticism , president obama made a re@@ treat yesterday to his frequently repeated , clear ple@@ dge : “ if your health insurance is what you like , you can keep it . ”
after hundreds of thousands of people have received a notice of termin@@ ation from their insu@@ rers , the republic@@ ans thre@@ w a warning to the president in recent days that he has mis@@ led the american public .
yesterday , obama rela@@ ti@@ sed his original promise .
“ the vast majority of citizens who want a functioning health insurance system can take it for granted , ” he said when he spoke in bo@@ ston .
in response to the numerous media reports on redun@@ dan@@ cies , obama called on those americans who received such communications to focus on the free market .
most citizens could thus have a better , more comprehensive health insurance for the same price , or less favor@@ ably , than forec@@ ast .
&quot; you come with a better offer , &quot; he said .
the government described it as un@@ surprising that the five per cent of the population , who themselves have insurance , are looking for a different tari@@ ff .
“ i want to say to these americans quite directly : they deserve better , ” se@@ beli@@ us said at a hearing before the energy and trade committee of the representative office of the house of representatives in washington .
se@@ beli@@ us , who is responsible for the implementation of the affordable care act , has declared that the fund &apos;s launch is a long time since october .
“ i am as fru@@ stra@@ ted and an@@ gr@@ y as anyone else , ” she said .
i am determined to reg@@ ain your trust .
this statement of an ex@@ ci@@ ted se@@ beli@@ us at a meeting behind her , at the meeting yesterday , was a clear example of this .
after more than three hours of hearing , long se@@ be@@ li@@ us repeatedly pressed the question why the “ architec@@ ts ” were not able to make a decision .
government in jerusal@@ em confir@@ ms attack on sy@@ ri@@ an air force base no longer confir@@ ms the attack on sy@@ ri@@ an air base base .
an american government official who is anonymous is not allowed to be informed of the outcome of the vote on thursday against the american news channel c@@ n@@ n .
the goal is to launch &quot; missi@@ les and related equipment , &quot; the israeli government fears that the us will be responsible for lebanon &apos;s security .
sy@@ ri@@ an and leban@@ ese media , as well as the arab channel al-@@ arab@@ i@@ ya , had previously reported that the port of lat@@ ak@@ ia was located at the night of wednesday on thursday .
the israeli television channel 2 showed satellite images of the base .
un@@ certain the government of jerusal@@ em has not officially confirmed the attack .
however , the news agency re@@ u@@ ters quo@@ tes an equally anonymous israeli government official with the words that he believes that israel is going to carry out the attack , but is not sure .
a spo@@ kes@@ man for the israeli defense ministry said , &apos; we are not comm@@ enting on these reports &apos; .
the journ@@ alist ron ben@@ -@@ y@@ is@@ ha@@ i emphasi@@ zed in the daily ye@@ di@@ oth ash@@ ra@@ f that the eu is a very important country in the world earlier , partly successfully .
the israeli government has repeatedly war@@ ned that any attempt to isol@@ ate syria from the he@@ z@@ bol@@ lah with chemical or other dangerous weapons would be a step in the wrong direction .
john ker@@ ry , in an unprecedented attempt to impose the financial crisis on the us sp@@ y , says that the us has gone “ un@@ reason@@ ably too far . ”
john ker@@ ry suggested that the us would be a little more cau@@ tious in his view , with an un@@ expected admission of its def@@ ensive stance on its surveillance programs .
the foreign minister also ad@@ mitted that he would be acting in tan@@ dem with bar@@ ack obama to ensure that “ au@@ top@@ il@@ ot ” was swit@@ ched when the explo@@ sive bom@@ bs were being launched .
the le@@ ak@@ ed information makes us government in a diplomatic position .
if a video call is given at the open government conference in london , ker@@ ry said : “ without question , the president and i , as well as others in the government , have learned of some things that are almost au@@ top@@ il@@ ot .
he then became the first high-@@ level member of the us government to admit that the us sp@@ y was a border crossing .
he said : “ in some cases , this has gone too far . ”
the president is determined to clarify matters and is therefore conduc@@ ting a thorough investigation so that no one can feel that i am being ab@@ used .
i assure you that the rights of inno@@ cent people will be respected in this process .
ker@@ ry insi@@ sted , however , that the n@@ sa be a force of good , and that its surveillance processes saved many lives .
he added : “ we are dealing with a new world , where the people are ready to move themselves into the air . ”
there is a radical extre@@ mis@@ m in the world that is sin@@ ful of people being killed , and in which the people are being killed .
so what if you were able to do that ?
we have indeed seen aircraft cr@@ ash@@ es , attacks on buildings and the killing of people because we have been very careful in the run@@ -up to such plans .
meanwhile , us legisl@@ ators will travel to europe to address concerns about the alleg@@ ed american es@@ pi@@ on@@ age .
sen@@ ator chr@@ is mur@@ ph@@ y from connec@@ tic@@ ut said he had this week met with representatives of the european parliament and others and was concerned about their threats to withdraw from the european parliament because of fru@@ stration with national security .
“ it is very important for national security interests of the us that europeans are not too di@@ str@@ acted from our joint efforts against terrorism . ”
i also go to europe to make it clear that we in the fight against terrorism must continue to work together , regardless of your an@@ ger at the n@@ sa programmes .
media reports that the n@@ sa has lost millions of telephone data in europe have seriously damaged relations with some us allies .
other rev@@ el@@ ations quo@@ ted from snow@@ den ’ s documents that the government of n@@ sa had to remove the mobile phone from chancell@@ or ang@@ ela mer@@ kel and up to 34 other heads of state .
the head of national intelligence , james cla@@ pper , def@@ ended the es@@ pi@@ on@@ age of allies as necessary , and stated that this was custom@@ ary on both sides .
in all the t@@ um@@ ult , mur@@ ph@@ y said that his authority is preparing the congress ’ s journey , which is to take place this year , and hoped that the delegation would be members from both parties and cham@@ bers .
the names of the other participating members will be published in the coming days .
he said that the exact route will be worked out .
while mur@@ ph@@ y stressed that the purpose of the journey was to improve relations , he also said that there are some “ serious words ” that would be true .
he said that european governments should be honest with their people about the kind of sp@@ y programmes that they themselves have been using for years .
“ while we can change our surveillance programs to protect the rights of europeans , they must also be able to address the fact that the european union is not the only ones to be sp@@ ying , ” says mur@@ ph@@ y .
meanwhile , john ker@@ ry will be on a weekend trip to the middle east and poland to see how he can get out of the bush with the res@@ ent@@ ment about the us strategy in syria , egypt , and iran , and us surveillance activities .

a 2@@ 1-@@ year-@@ old woman from sy@@ d@@ ney who was to be in prison in ph@@ uk@@ et for 15 days because she was mista@@ ken@@ ly claim@@ ing to be tor@@ tured by a taxi driver was killed against the ruling .
ste@@ vi@@ e ro@@ ch@@ elle b@@ am@@ ford was first tried by a provin@@ cial court in ph@@ uk@@ et on 15 june .
later , however , the rec@@ ord@@ ings of a video camera showed that she had safe@@ ly arrived at her hotel after she had been separated from her austr@@ ali@@ an friend .
the police in ph@@ uk@@ et inter@@ ro@@ g@@ ated b@@ am@@ ford for two days until they agreed to look at history .
until the trial , she was there in police cust@@ o@@ dy .
b@@ am@@ ford was sent@@ enced to 15 days in prison in a prison prison .
she is the daughter of peter tun@@ ks , a former player of the austr@@ ali@@ an rub@@ g@@ y-@@ league , who is addressing the foreign ministry in can@@ ber@@ ra with the request for help for his daughter .
tun@@ ks declared to the sunday te@@ leg@@ raph in sy@@ d@@ ney that the whole family was “ extremely concerned ” about the welfare of his daughter and wanted to take them back to australia .
“ we are naturally very concerned , but we hope that you will be back to home as soon as possible , ” said tun@@ ks .
b@@ am@@ ford has appe@@ aled against the judgment and is against a deposit of 50@@ ,000 ba@@ ht on free foot .
in austr@@ ali@@ an reports , they were reported to have been in the meantime in the resort kr@@ ab@@ i in southern thailand .
the court has said that ba@@ ham@@ ford will be replaced by a local law@@ yer in ph@@ uk@@ et .
however , it is also possible that thailand will be in a state of emergency following the recent ass@@ ass@@ ination of the travel@@ er mic@@ hel@@ le sm@@ ith in ph@@ uk@@ et .
