gutach : even more security for pedestrians and cyclists .
you are not 100 meters from each other : at the end of the day , a new version of the b 33-foot traffic light is on display in gutach .
two plants so close to each other : intention or turtle bürgerstrom ?
this question has been raised by the mayor of the city of strasbourg yesterday .
&quot; the rapid rise of the city hall is a real highlight of the city , because it secures the school path , &quot; explains eckert yesterday .
the gap between the two is now over , and the road is still a long one .
the agreement , officially launched yesterday , is a vital element in the process of the sulzbachweg / kirchstraße crossroads .
we have the museum , two churches , kurpark , the bus stop and the bus station , a doctor and a bank , as well as the traffic from the residential area › grub ‘ .
&quot; at the high traffic and traffic levels , the number of people who had to be allowed to cross another traffic light &quot; , eckert said .
this confirms peter arnold of the council of the council of offenburg .
&quot; according to current measurements , the number of passengers travelling on b 33 is approximately 12 000 daily .
therefore , the construction of another ampere is more than necessary : &quot; safety is simply about &quot; , so arnold .
overall , four transport screens were carried out , including a roundabout , but due to the close links in the crossroads area sulzbachweg / kirchstraße .
it was said , according to arnold , that the location of the ampelmasts was tested beforehand : &quot; by means of an extra long wooden tribes we sieged transport vehicles we have developed .
the around 15 000 euros in the amperage plant itself is the &quot; most modern , which is currently in the market &quot; , explains the commission &apos;s arnold .
the complex is equipped with colour tv sets , a dvd player and a microphone .
and austerity is also possible : the older light installations use up about 100 watts , which are currently only eight watts .
pro fare is available for three light tanks .
arnold explained the technique of the new plant : this is equipped with two radar sensors .
press the footbridge to the traffic lights and the lights will test the upper part of the radar .
is the road free , it comes straight green for the foot .
a further raid-sensor checks whether the data of the green phase is available for pedestrians .
&quot; if a group or salesman were to be overtaken by the road , the green period would be extended , so everyone would be safe to travel on the road , &quot; explained arnold .
of course , the car driver must be a partner here and the driver must observe the track .
this was the case yesterday .

us officials are now trying to get a better deal .
the devices that are used to detect any dangerous km and to store information to the authorities are not core to a controversy .
the normally rather slow process of the development of roads has suddenly become a more intense debate with colorful alliances .
libertarian women have been concerned with environmental groups and are in favour of the eu being able to support small boxes for the recording of the danger .
the tea party is a horrible one .
the american civil rights association ( aclu ) is also a deeply committed concern and expressed concern about a number of data protection concerns .
but , while the us congress is not focusing on a course of action , several federal states are no longer waiting .
you are currently examining how you can improve the situation in the next ten years with a system in which drivers are charged per mileage travelled .
thousands of car drivers and their families have already lost their lives in the tachograph , some of which have gps monitoring .
the first thing that i would like to say is that this is a must for our country .
“ it is nothing to do with the fact that we will only use it , ” said hasan ikhrata , managing director of southern california .
the way in which the commission is going to pay these taxes will change .
the technology for this is there .
the initiative comes at a time when the council of europe &apos;s highway trust fund , which is financed by taxes , is being used to finance the us government &apos;s pile column .
but in america , not much is being killed anymore .
cars use less energy than cars .
the state mineral oil tax of 18.4 cents per gallon is a tax on the price of oil , which is less than 4 cents per litre .
politicians dare to take large price increases , which are also a source of carbon .
“ the benzint-tax is simply not viable , ” says lee munnich , a specialist in gasoline legislation at the university of minnesota .
his state is a country that has recently built 500 cars with passenger recorders , with which a milestone programme of payment is to be tested .
“ the challenge is the long-term most sensible alternative . ” he said .
office crats call it a milestone in use-based usage .
it is no surprise that the idea was not very popular among urban liberals , because the tax could be reduced , for example , to reduce the driving behaviour in such a way that congestion and climate harmful emissions are reduced .
the caliphate plans to use the new system in the preparation of strategies , with which the ambitious targets of the law will be achieved .
but the republican has been bill shui-off from pennsylvania , a chairman of the house transport committee , and has been forced to leave the country .

“ the first time i have been to the united states , i have been to the united states , ” says adrian moore , vice president for the guidelines at readon .
the people pay directly for the things they do get .
the movement is also supported by two earlier american transport ministers .
the us senate approves the agreement last year for a $ 90 million expensive pilot project to be launched to save 10,000 cars .
but the majority in the house of representatives prevented the process from being pushed forward and thus responded to the concerns of members from rural areas who represent people who are in daily life often for many miles on the way to work or to the city .
several federal states and large cities are moving non-smokers , but they are not moving at their own pace .
on the engaging side , oregon , the current 5,000 rider for the biggest experiment in the country , is the most committed .
this driver will soon be the milestone in the charging of miles instead of the oil tax to the state .
nevada has already developed a pilot project to help the people of nevada .
new york city is considering introducing a system of this kind .
illinois testers it in restricted environments .
and the i-95-coalition government has been forced to withdraw its proposal to the council of ministers for transport from 17 states on the east coast ( including maryland , pennsylvania , virginia and florida ) .
the concept is not a universal heat , but a very simple one .
in nevada , where the most recent 50 volunteers have been equipped with the equipment , drivers have been sceptical about the idea that the government could pursue each of its movements .
“ remember the big brother of the big brother and such things was a big problem , ” explains alauddin khan , head of the strategy and result management .
the people wanted it not .
as the test started , the commission warned that the aclu was not a problem on its website : “ it would be relatively easy to change the tachographs in extended surveillance devices .
it is also clear that there is no need to create a gigantic , plentiful technological infrastructure that inevitably leads to the creation of new data on the daily movements of individuals and companies .
nevada is one of a number of states that have now been forced to rebuild after affordable technology , with the aim of making the state aware of the kilometres that are in danger , but not exactly when and where .
this , it seems , is not enough .
the hunt for this technology has some authorities to a small degree .
the company is originally not listed , but has been listed on the german stock exchange for the taxation of motor drivers .
rather , it was their aim to create a new , more stable and more competitive market for car insurance .
but the measures it has tested are not the same for the road planning industry .
“ the people are more willing to take part in it , if their speed and location are not up to record , ” said ryan morrison , managing director of true middle-income .
in some of these public pilot programmes , large errors have been made .
it is much cheaper than a car , and less intrusive , to implement it .
in oreghon , the students experiment with the idea of using motorcycles to create a range of choices .
you can also register for a device with or without gps .
or you can choose no device at all and pay a flat fee instead based on the average of all entries .
other places hope that the concept of a distrust of the public can be sold by using the devices with more functions .
in new york city , traffic officials want a device to tax , but with which the government also has to pay parking fees , to provide insurance for hazardous kilometres .
“ autoriders would be covered by the added value of the benefits that the system offers to them . ”
some traffic planning systems ask themselves , however , whether the whole talk about the pay per meile is not just a huge waste of time , but also a huge waste of time .
in the case of the metropolitan transport cocommission , the customer is responsible for the area of san francisco bay .
a further entry fee is charged or an annual fee .
“ it is not a reason for an operation if a patient is not in a hospital . ”
if we do that , we will be making hundreds of millions of car drivers worried about their privacy and many other things .

abstraction commandante hans kamerer had already met in his training assumption that the property of feder in the burgberger straße was to be found .
there , the sawing process should be made into a short circuit .
by using the resulting branding and the smoke development , two people were injured , one of them was still able to send an emergency call .
two breathing protection carriers of the wehr made themselves to be very active after the first examination of the subject by hans kammerer .
after a short time , the company managed to get the first person to find and enter the free .
the second person had to be worn .
this was not so easy , as the european union also had a narrow staircase .
the building , a workshop and a fully integrated stop shop , is located in the heart of the city , and is a perfect place to stay for two horses .
it was in a lot of wood and also straw bales .
further there was a lot of electrical machines for woodworking .
the first soldering attack was in the area of the tank in the vehicle .
a further direction was taken over a overflowing and hyper-hydrate in about 100 meters distance .
now we have managed to find three soldering handles .
for use , the new building also had a high-tech hose .
hans kammer went to the german navy during the practice to show what was done with little available resources .
in the worst case , support is provided via the daily operations group königsfeld .
the command line of the ship was very clear with the operation .
the networking of high-tech universities and companies is important to us .
on its visit to the district of breisgau-hochschwarzwald , president guido wolf also met in tititisee neustadt to clarify where the labour force from tomorrow will come from .
in the support center of hochschwarzwald he went to the university of applied sciences together with the managing school leaders of the vocational schools and the district gymnasium and the parent of parental leave on this important issue .
&quot; education is a key part of the location &quot; , underlined claudia stele , director of the german hans-thoma school , which has developed the networked education center .
the first step was to make the company a successful partner in the field of training .
since 2011 , there is a new law school in the forests of the bavarian state of bavaria , a district gymnasium and a vocational school centre .
in addition , he praised the family friendliness of the county .
&quot; it is important that we not only respect the family phase , but also that we have a better understanding of the family phase , because of demographic change .
in addition , he led the committee on foreign affairs to the view that more and more people are looking for care and care for their loved ones .
&quot; without the support of employers , the eu ’ s resulting social security burden cannot be reduced .
but no one can afford to wait for qualified workers .
a further , particularly important factor is the strengthening of the network of universities and companies .
&quot; for who has already been in the field of the art of the region during his studies , will be satisfied with his knowledge and experience .
because only if there is sufficient training places available , we can guarantee that the skilled labour needs can be met .
in his opinion , the position of the company is a good one .
in addition , he experienced a great deal of difficulty on his train journey from tititisee-neustadt to freiburg .
&quot; stay in touch with the people of europe and ensure that the european union is not a barrier to local transport &quot; , he explained to the members present .
with music a subtle and entertaining afternoon , the world is experiencing a new life .

the more than 100 years old natural stone wall as the front of the building , which was before the renovation , has been transformed into a church street , is to be rebuilt with the city ’ s remedial costs plan .
in the days before the kitzbühel , the first work of the restoration of the former school building was carried out a small corridor wall , to stabilize and static discharge of the more than one hundred years old natural stone wall with ballast .
the other way forward is that the commission will be able to give mr alexander misok the floor to the commission , the landesmemorial office , in the planning .
after that , a calculation of costs by experts is to be carried out , which then serves to make the council of municipalities decide and determine what further action should be taken .
a decision on this will probably be taken in the coming year .
after the sanitation , care of the building and the planting of the old school building , the building was rebuilt inside the two side wing of the school built in 1912 , it must be seen as a follow-up measure to the need for renovation .
the historic , unique and one hundred years old border wall of the old school is the oldest part of the town .
deep rides in individual stones and a strong , strong , clear and clear , the wall is not currently crashing .
a location safe wall is a prerequisite for a peace process that is used by pupils , which is not possible due to the current fortifications .
originally , the school hofsanung was even already in the years 2008 / 2009 , but high unplanned costs and the resulting financial costs caused a shift .
a major word in the historical school toll analysis is the fact that the school walls have been used for film recordings .
if guidelines from this page are not found , then the city of bräunlingen hopes for subsidies from the think tanks .
the students of the bräunlinger primary school , who have now returned to their home in a well restored old school building with new aula , can soon start to study the old school courtyard .
özdemir wants to become a jazz teacher in stuttgart .
in the ongoing crisis discussions about the future of the music schools in basel , germany , the european union has now also taken a stand on cem özdemir , the german chancellor of the greens .
&quot; i think it is wrong to call the holistic training in music education .
jazz and classic - the most popular jazz festival in stuttgart .
this is contrary to the principles of the european union , which is to be seen as a favourites in stuttgart for a direct mandate at the federal elections on 22 september , the green red government .
this formula is designed to promote the development of the european union &apos;s energy policy , based on a study of experts .
after that , among other things , the programme is to be completed by the musikhochschule stuttgart and to be completed by the stuttgart university of music .
us border : &quot; super-tunnels &quot; to the drug smuggling discovered that the police are being smuggled .
the hotel is located on the border between mexico and the united states , and has investigators working on a &quot; supertunnel &quot; for drug smuggling .
as the us customs authorities have announced , the commission was not prepared to take over 500 metres of tubes between tijuana and san diego with electricity , rail tracks and a crew of ventilation .
three vulnerabilities have been discovered in the game : the one that was discovered in the game , the one that was discovered in the game , and the one that was discovered in the game .
the tunnel is a very good example of how the tunnel has not been used .
&quot; this cartels are stupid when they think that they could be under the radar .
the commission has been reminded of the drugs gangs that it is not possible to keep on using these tunnels and try to use them .
both the us authorities and the eu ’ s mexican security forces are in a permanent struggle against the drug cartels .
since 2006 , the number of people living in mexico has been more than 77,000 .
from experts we design and manufacture the most suitable and reliable systems for the production of high quality products , designed by experts , for the production of high quality materials and for the production of high quality products .
because of the complex and technical equipment of the tunnel , the eritreans assume that the tunnel is operated by architects and engineers .
the track installation is very simple and easy to operate .
on mexican side , the access to a building , which has been built 80 metres from the border .
according to the authorities , a ladder takes up 20 meters to the depth to the tunnel entrance itself .
the tunnel is a very long way from the road , and it has a cross-section of 1.20 meters and a width of 90 centimeters .
he would have been able to make a significant contribution to the illegal immigration of the united states .
two of the suspects were arrested in connection with the cocaine fund .
the third , a mexican , was sentenced to death for confiscating marijuana .
all three of them are threatened with the highest sentence of life-long detention , as officials have said .
since 2006 , eight such tunnels have been discovered , but it was reported on the press conference in san diego .
it should be noted , however , that in a case such as this , coal is used for mining .
normally , coal is used in small quantities , and not by tunnels .
this showed me the &quot; hidden &quot; despair of drug gangs , whose traditional ropes have now been cut off , bill gates said .
you would do everything to make the european union a success .
the hotel is located in the heart of the city , near the main shopping street of the city .
you must be held liable for all the sentences up to ten years .
2014 will be a spiritual fortress , a festival of the year 2014 .
the jubilee is the birthday of the city of gisingen on the occasion of the 1250 .
reversal of the first settlement of the first settlement is getting closer .
if the european union is to be a full year in just eight weeks &apos; time , the anniversary year will be on the agenda .
horny girls and cherry girls are waiting for you in the town of hradec králové in 794 .
in churches , a url was created , in which both towns were mentioned .
on 15 march , it will be an official start to the jubilee year .
in the context of the anniversary of the event , several events are held in the ghost as well as in the church houses .

the commission is not here on this weekend to discuss the issue of the future of the church .
city music director rudolf barth has written a new book for the city on the occasion of the anniversary .
on 21 june , together with the sonnwendfeier des schwarzwaldverein , on 12 july in the arena with fireworks and on 13 december the first concert of city music in the new festhalle .
this is done in the anniversary year of the company .
anthony towns , the founder of the company , is also responsible for the development of the company .
&quot; it should be a chronicle not only of mental illnesses themselves , but also of a printed book .
and even the spiritual heart of the present day celebrates 2014 .
the new chronik is to be released on november 21 and 22 in the new festhalle in geisingen .
2014 is not the case either .
the narration tongue strohglonki starts on february 8 with a brewery evening at the 60-year-old age , which harmonises well math .
the altenwerk leipferdingen is 40 years old , the gisinger school has been involved in the new location for 50 years and celebrates this on 10 may , the musikverein polyhymnia leipzig will celebrate 150 years and name it .
the city of geisingen was founded in a charitable foundation , which was owned by the monastery of st. gallen .
the url was written in churches ( houses ) and was used for the court of the time .
both communities are therefore very close to each other in the same document .
the reason for this 1250-year old to be celebrated , in addition , is the community ’ s form of 40 years ago .
the council is taking the line equipment to the fore .
should the rail pass &quot; am hirschen &quot; be expensive ?
yes , have the non-profit organizations , have decided .
schilltach must be paid 220 000 euros .
the german railway is seeking to expand its cinematic activities in the coming year .
i would particularly like to emphasise the importance of safety at rail crossings - regularly , there are collisions between trains with other vehicles across the country .
do the communities agree with the reconstruction measures that have been taken , they must agree to the cost of one third , share the rest of the railway and the federal government .
schilltach stadtbaumeister roland grießhaber explained to the municipal council the specific features of the bahrain &quot; am hirschen &quot; .
there , the commission plans to invest in the area of the tunnels of the tunnel there west of the railway line .
there , the larger vehicles , for example , those that have langholz , could also be in the area of transit without blocking the tracks .
grieblers proposed that the commission should draw up a necessary support wall in such a way that the city could be the next street in due course .
this was confirmed in the municipal council controversial .
civil servants thomas haas opposed : the railway transition &quot; hirschen &quot; is regularly used for long-timber transport .
even wood from the field of &quot; cow bach &quot; is partly covered by this route , because the remaining wood is up to 20 meters long .
in addition , the commission &apos;s proposal for a change of direction for those vehicles which are not in use in the tunnel , when the main road is blocked , argued haas .
as it is clear that the situation in kyrgyzstan and the castle mountain tunnels will be rebuilt and restored , as is currently the case in wolfen. this could give the rail crossing &quot; at the &quot; hirschen &quot; a longer time for a longer period .
the wheels came to an agreement to investigate whether the costs of the proposed directive would be met by the road .
despite this , the fact that the railway crossing was rebuilt by a majority was approved , with the proviso that the necessary support wall was built in such a way that the city could be the next road towards the &quot; bahnhofstraße &quot; road for 5.5 for a .
the fact that the railway crossing was reconstructed at gerberei trautwein could , on the other hand , create a completely different problem that could hinder access to the rapidly rising &quot; geroltzhäuser weg &quot; .
the administration had the rebuilding plans of the railway from the engineering office in breinlinger to investigate , because they had doubts as to whether the planned connection of the geroltz building would be possible .
the investigation came to the conclusion that the commission had not excluded the possibility of the nexus of road running into the hands of the longer vehicles .
the responsibility for this is , in turn , the city as a road loader .
the fact that the renovation could be carried out under liability is a consequence of this .
as both the timber exhaust and the bending of the current construction state work , the construction should be left to the original building .
the commission also has to be aware of the risk of the conflict of interest with a player on the transition .
even trains from the main railway station would have to be deported to this point .
multilingualism was given a prominent place in the construction of this rail transition , as the city was shielded from the problem of rising vehicles &apos; .
as an unproblematic , the body considers the rebuilding of the railway crossings &quot; before heurbach &quot; and &quot; before kuhbach &quot; , for which cross-agreements have already been concluded with the railway .
esa decides on large global space projects and is responsible for billions of euros of missions for billions of euros .
ferne planet , gravitaunts , or black sea lions are the experts in the european space agency .
30 proposals were put forward , five are still in the race .
ferne welten .
more than 1000 planets in other stars have astronomers already found .
whether it is at least on some of them , no one knows .
the selection is difficult : should you be looking for gravitational waves ?
or rather the origin of the cosmos , the universe ?
or after earthlike planets , the planet flagged , perhaps alien life .
this is a question that the people responsible for the european space agency are asking themselves .
for your program &quot; cosmocode &quot; you can search for ideas for two large spaceships that will help to make research a decisive step forward .
the eit for such &apos; l-missions &apos; is eur 1.4 billion each .
the start will be on the spot 2028 and 2034 .
in early september , the european union met in paris to discuss the future of space research .
30 ideas were on the table , five of them are now in the closer picture .
many bodies have called for an assessment of the proposals to be made of the haken in the research community .
in the next few days , a final decision will be taken by the scientific programme committee .
overall , four major issues have been raised by the esa , on which the missions of the 2007 programme &quot; cosmic vision &quot; will be answered .
what are the conditions for the emergence of planets and life ?
the exact dates of the events in the creation of star wars and the universe are known as the stars of the universe .
a big info-point telescope with the all could be this dark .
and if a star planets has a star under which circumstances can life be created ?
to meet this question , the commission is expected to set up the space telescope &quot; cheops &quot; in 2017 , with 500 already known planetary systems in our vicinity .
the possibilities are not limited , however , cheops is a small mission with a budget of 150 million euros .
with larger instruments , we could reduce astronomers to earth like planets and even increase the composition of their atmospheres , thus looking for &quot; biomarkers &quot; : gases that are considered to be biological activity .
as a result , how does the solar system work ?
the commission has also been asked to provide an insight into the conditions for the creation of new life .
a major role in the magnetic field of the brain is its magnetic activity and the interaction of its magnetic field and its magnetic field .
in our sun-system , these advantages can be exemplary .
with the &quot; solar orbiting &quot; , the esa has already launched a mission of the m-class ( the budget is approximately one half a billion ) .
the sony ericsson w710 is a new generation of digital cameras that will be available in the near future .
from a very great deal of interest to researchers are also jupiter and his moons .
you want to find out which role the giant leaf has in the development of the solar system ?
for this purpose , the esa provides the first of the overall three l-missions of the cosmic vision programme .
the sony ericsson &quot; juice &quot; ( jupiter icy moons explorer ) begins its journey by 2022 .
eight years later , she reaches jupiter and is supposed to have created the atmosphere of the planet and the icy monds of europe , kallisto and ganymed .
what are the basic physical characteristics of the computer in the universe ?
the world of the world offers many possibilities to find material under extreme conditions .
perhaps you will find some different ways of interpreting the physicists .
as has been said , how has the universe come into being and what is it consist of ?
before 13.7 billion years , our cosmos was created by the big bang .
in addition to the information we have , we also have a great deal of information about the stars , planets and living beings as we are , there are dark matter , the gravity of which is galaxies and galaxies .
so far , researchers have not known which physics or the laws of the first second breast , nor do they know what they are valid for the second .
with &quot; euclid &quot; , the esa has also already developed a m-mission .
with a special telescope , the camera is to be able to determine the distribution of the matter in the universe for the first time in the sky and thus to draw conclusions on the properties of dark matter and dark matter .
who wants to run the race could be a member of the team of the team .
from the 30 proposals , on the end of the selection procedure , only two remain .
the best chances of winning a grant as a l mission after the eyes of many experts are &quot; e-lisa &quot; , a sophisticated concept for verifying gravitational waves .
this includes physical persons who are able to change the structure of the space time , which albert einstein predicted nearly 100 years ago .
below is a list of the most important and most important events in the history of the town .
eliisa could do that , hope the scientists behind the project .
the mission provides for a two-year plan of probes .
he could be a member of the european union , unlike installations on earth , and he could also show waves of gravitational waves that have arisen during the urinary tract .
four other proposals compete with each other to make the second l mission : a large x-ray device , a large x-ray tube called &quot; athena &quot; , which is used , among other things , to explore black holes , &quot; icy planets &quot; .
the first time you have purchased your ticket , you will receive a confirmation of your order .
snowboarding is ready to work with germany in relation to us surveillance .
edward snow has been a member of the whistleblower of the us intelligence service , saying that he is prepared to go to berlin and , before the german bundestag , to go to the national security agency .
the german member hans-christoph ströbele met snowden in the european parliament on thursday , where he was granted asylum , in order to discuss the statement in germany .
in a letter to the president of the council , mr snowden , which was sent to the media in berlin on friday , this letter states : ‘ even if the result of my efforts is demonstrably positive , my government treats a different opinion .
the truth about saying is not a crime .
in the letter to the president of the council , he writes that he is convinced that the support of the international community will convince the american government to stop the charge against him .
the amendments tabled by the us ministry of justice are a step in the right direction , with spying and theft of state property .
the german minister of the interior , hans-peter friedrich , said online about time : “ if mr snowden is prepared to talk to german representatives , then we will find ways to make that possible . ”
the relationship between the us and germany is characterised by the claims that the us is not a party to the mobile phone .
thomas oppermann , the member who spoke to the committee responsible for the secret service , has said that it is necessary to seize the opportunity to bring snowden to light as a witness if this is possible , ‘ without him ’ .
flow sensors , a member of the greens , published a picture of themselves and snowden .

if snowden is to be protesting in germany , he needs a guarantee that he will be “ safe ” there , so the honourable member will .
snowboarding is now staging a new chapter in the history of the “ serious and advanced ” world of persecution .
he was not touched by the fact that the world response to “ my act of political expression ” was a worldwide one .
citizens on the whole world , as well as high-level politicians – including in the united states – have been watching the revelations about an uncontrolled system of comprehensive surveillance as a merit of the general public .
in his letter to the council , snowden makes clear to the german authorities that there is a cooperation offer “ if the difficulties surrounding the humanitarian situation have been resolved ” .
frontier airlines collects fees for mobile baggage and other items of baggage that are not included in the ticket price .
frontier airlines plans to expand its operations to include up to 100 us dollars from passengers who are on their flight .
frontier airlines intends to deploy up to $ 100 for a piece of hand baggage and $ 2 for coffee or limonade .
the new fee is valid for hand baggage in the luggage compartment above the seat , small bags under the seat are still free of charge .
frontier explained that it is calculated that usd 25 if the fee is paid in advance , and $ 100 per person in the case of travellers who arrive at the airport .
front-end speakers are kate o &apos;malley , saying that the fee of 100 us dollars is aimed at making travellers pay more for themselves in advance of the payment .
“ we want to make this amount not to be calculated ” , explained she .
airport transfer service is available from the airport to the airport .
passengers who have not been tried to use them should be able to travel as much as possible .
fees are a way to collect passengers to pay for their baggage less than they would otherwise .
o &apos;malley said that in the new fee i am not really concerned with spending money .
it is about the staircases of the most loyal customers of frontier , who clearly expressed that it was becoming increasingly difficult to find a place in the compartment above the seat .
passengers who have not yet purchased their tickets on the airline ’ s website must not pay .
the same applies to the passenger who is flying on the flight part of the frontloading .
o &apos;malley explained that the site of frontier and the check-in page are not changed , so the passengers are informed of the fee .
the new handbaggage fee of frontier will only enter into force in the summer , a precise date is not yet available .
passengers who travel with a flight of luggage often have to pay extra for it and other charges , but airlines are happy to take back that .
you argued that the european union &apos;s transport of luggage is costing money and passengers this service .
many of the people who work on wall street see the new baggage charges as a sign that the airlines have enough money to travel to the united states after years of losses .
the majority of them , however , have so far been left to the fingers of charges for hand luggage .
spirit is a leading airline in the field of civil aviation three years ago .
the only other airline that has a such policy fee is the hungarian air force .
he estimates that in a report of december 2011 , the number of handbaggage allowances per year was usd 50 million .
sorry , this page is only available in german .
“ the board administrator is a part of the reifenhäuser group , which i have been working on in the aviation industry ” , said he .
i expect the commission to take care of the toughest and most ardent discussions at the stage of the flight .
“ the aircraft was full ” , explained the pilot , “ and the board ran smoothly .
frontier follows spirit also in the 2 dollars , which is used for coffee , tea , limonade or juice .
the company explained that the passenger is entitled to a free upgrade to the limonade or juice .
water is still free .
us airways will have a short stake in the airbus a320 family in 2008 to make money for refreshments , but it has made a withdrawal seven months later , after passengers complained and did not have another large company .
front-end step , fees for the manual baggage , is a step that will be taken if passengers are not buying directly from the airline .
airport transfer is available from the airport to the hotel .
the company provides all companies with an incentive to train passengers to buy direct from them .
frontier is a leading player in this field , however .
in september , the company started to develop a new hotel website for the booking of flights via an online travel agency only half of the number of frequent flyer miles .
on wednesday , the first two mileage was recharged to 25 % of the flight route .
a laterooms.com rate of one third party is not included in the price .
passengers who are not yet registered can also use the website of frontier seats only when they buy directly .
frontier has a staffing customer base and is able to provide a wide range of services to its customers .

well over 40 women visited the last women &apos;s breakfast this year in the gospel church community bisingen .
the topic of the day in the municipal house was &quot; proverbial words &quot; and &quot; reutings from the middle ages &quot; .
zita köhler , the chairman of the church council , and the president of the church council , went to a talk in a biblical proverb .
&quot; spriches &quot; contain life-wisdom , rules , or warnings , &quot; she explained .
you are comparing several proverbial words with the corresponding bible posts and explaining the meaning .
you called it sprieter like : holzzauge is vigilant , as scales fall from the eyes , an eye on someone who gives his .
multitude of times the lecturer left her listeners to advise which proverb it was .
the remark that came from the middle ages was taken from the church community offices .
you said that it was important and the origin of the words you called &quot; bridges into the past &quot; .
for the end , a raffle was lost .
the prices were reasonable , but the price was very high .

learn to work without work : pilot project for unskilled workers in tourism .
the hotel is located on the mecklenburgische seenplatte , a pilot project for the tourism industry .
under the leadership of the german federal employment agency , 49 women and men who have already been recognised as unskilled in the industry are to work for three winter .
&quot; new to it is that the segmentation of the six months courses with degrees ends &quot; , said carmen wiechert of the employment agency neubrandenburg .
the benefits are manifold : the participants would thus not be unemployed , the firms would be retrained , and the people would be more and more involved in hotels and restaurants .
the day of the project is also the industrial and commercial chamber of commerce in neubrandenburg and the german hotel and restaurant association in the city of neubrandenburg .
nsa declares that a “ internal error ” and not hackers are to blame for the crash of the website .
the shadow banking system in the united states has declared that it will not be possible to make a mistake in its public website for a few hours and that it will not be hackers , as it was claimed online .
“ nsa.gov was a great fan of the world this night , as during a planned update a new internal error was discovered . ” he explained .
the problem will be fixed this evening .
the claim that the euro is a failure is not justified by a distributed denial of service attack .
in the early evenings , the online server service was very popular .
previously , a spokesman from the nsa had spoken to abc news , calling for the authority ’ s sensitive internal network to be “ in no way ” compromised .
secret ballot papers are not at risk , as the spokesman said .
at least one group of hack-viruses took part in the event , the nsa website was associated with a ddos attack .
in such cases , the police will be able to use the target site with page calls until the servers are overloaded .
the cyberbag is a very small and simple one , and the attacks are not intended to interfere with the internal network of the target system .
the former super-secret nsa , whose nickname was once no search agent , was used to be a &quot; secret &quot; .
the growing controversy surrounding the secrecy also fueled initial speculation that the state of the incident is the result of a targeted and cyper-operation .
easy to clean , the skin is very small , and the number of people without jobs has risen by 22 to 1,307 in october .

because many companies reacted by the same means to the situation in terms of recruitment .
a reason for this is , according to the felder-bauer , &quot; we have hardly any skilled craftsmen in the crafts , health and care of the elderly &quot; .

winning entries are not allowed in the event of bombardments after the decline in delivery and orders .
the canadian aircraft manufacturer , the canadian company bombardier inc , reported a new 15-percent increase in the volume of the net profit on thursday after having been reduced by declining orders and deliveries to aircraft in the third quarter .
bombing is not only the most important aspect of the new constitution , but also the most important aspect of the new cseries aircraft .
on the jungfernflug of the test aircraft a month and a half ago , only three further launches were carried out , which would seem questionable whether the test phase was as planned .
the results were not as good as the forecasts and led to a change of course .
catheron domesticated , analyst at national bank finance , said : “ the financial crisis has been on the decline .
“ while the weaker countries were not sufficiently represented in the aircraft , the number of aircraft was expected to decline .
we are the opinion that the bombing of the new orders for the cseries should be retained if the test program for the aircraft is to progress .
if , however , there is no new orders to be made in the coming months , we expect the market to be more open to the program .
bombing is not the way to go .
the first test aircraft was delivered in march to the public and was flying to the us after months of delays .
but , so far , binding orders for the cseries have been delivered with 177 , as potential buyers have been waiting for the results of the flight tests and want to see if the company &apos;s claims about fuel efficiency and cost-saving potential of the new jet are true .
at present , there are 403 orders and commitments from 15 customers and companies .
the management board chairman pierre beaudoin is confident that he will not be able to use bombardier to achieve his goal of 300 binding orders at the beginning of commercial use of the jet .
the group ’ s management issued a statement on thursday to analysts and the media that the program was in the schedule .
“ the test aircraft is not a part of the ground any longer than expected , ” said beaudoin at a conference call and added , while the standstill of the aircraft was ground tests .
each manufacturer plans to change .
we have decided to propose a first flight , and then to take a revision period .
the same is true throughout the flight programme .
the second issue of five test aircraft will probably be included in the next few weeks , the remaining two being short of what it was originally intended to be .
nevertheless , analyses remain skeptical , whether twelve months after the jungle flight the first customer will be a cseries aircraft in service .
bombing is not the way to check the situation .
“ the long-running advance of the european union ’ s air traffic test – even if it is obviously bombardiers of internal planning – confirms our view that the commissioning of the first quarter of 2015 is moving ” , said dow .
in the third quarter with the end of september 30 , bombardiers net profit fell to € 147 million or 8 cents per share .
the price of the adjusted prize per share is unchanged 9 cents .
the sales were down slightly , but the group continued to decline from 4.2 to 4.2 million euros .
analysts had a profit of 10 cents per share , and a turnover of 4.56 billion dollars was expected , so thomson reuters i / b / e / s .
the world &apos;s fourth largest aircraft manufacturer , the world &apos;s largest , has said that it has taken 45 aircraft in this quarter , a decline of 57 last year .
the net-orders fell by 2.8 % to chf 83 million .
the order book in the aerospace and defence industries was down from € 39.4 billion on 30 september and was thus up from € 31.7 billion .
“ in the field of air and space travel , the results were in line with our objectives , but the low order intake and the overall market situation were disappointing , ” said beedoin .
the sales in the aerospace and defence industries increased by € 39.4 billion to € 21.9 billion .
bombing is not a way to get rid of the world &apos;s largest railway manufacturer , and has announced that sales in this segment have risen by just under 11 % to $ 2.1 billion .
the order book in the transport division increased by € 39.2 billion on 30 september and was thus significantly lower than the 31st december .
the winning volumes in the transport sector were increased by processing problems .
according to the company ’ s management , it will be new targets for the fourth quarter .
in rehearsal trading on thursday , the bombing campaign gave the company a share of 8.5 percent and stood at 4.83 canadian dollars , after also announced that it would not be able to sell the goodle board .

kokainaddict attorney , the drug boss against police investigation warned that he was in prison .
based on the study of the theory of the universe , bashir ditta , 42 , gave information to the subworld of neil scarborough .
the anwalt had been afraid to leave his secret drug addiction to light .
he was elected by the liverpool crown court , and was elected three years later .
a well-known name for the criminal , who has a drug baron in front of a large police investigation , is because he is afraid to use his secret drug addiction .
based on the study of the theory of the universe , bashar ditta , 42 , provided the subworld size neil scarborough with sensitive information about its activities in the drug trade , after having been admitted to comedy .
the report by criminals as “ first-class ” is a very good one .
officials of the commission watched how scarborough ( 32 ) had beaten three bags of cocaine at the bar of the lawyer in blackburn , lancashire , detained while this was being discussed with colleagues at a meal .
the ermittlungen revealed that the ditty images of drugs are regularly classified as class a after the tests had left traces of cocaine in its hair , on its wallet .
the hotel has been a member of the european parliament for eight months between january and august 2011 , and has been unauthorised to provide information on the arrest of two men on behalf of scarborough and one of its partners .
all four vulnerabilities have been discovered at the time by the police in a major investigation procedure for the heroin and cocaine trade in lancashire .
together with 32 other people , they were later arrested , having been arrested by the police on a number of home-searches and kocayan worth eur 1.5 million .
ditta , 42 , gave information to the criminals , but because he feared that he would not reduce his drug addiction .
today , ditta , the most important law firm in the field of soloists in blackburn , was arrested on liverpool street .
he gave a speech to the committee on foreign affairs on a previous survey .
the anwalt was overthrown after the police had been arrested in their investigations against scarborough .
two erasmus officers followed the court of justice &apos;s suspect and saw how he could lead to ditas house and the drugs were being treated with a purity of 60 % in a black golf glove .
in the late 2370s , he was a member of the crew of the uss voyager .
the anwalt returned to the home , and took the trouble to get rid of the drugs and then received nine communications between the two .
before the court , it was known that ditta had a “ regular consumer ” of kokain .
ditta was later arrested and sentenced to death .
during his arrest , the former prime minister , ditta , took his wallet and tried to borrow a number of credit cards , but they were assured and a hair sample was taken from him .
the police and judicial networks are not only the subject of the police , but also the subject of the police .
before the court , it was known that he had been involved in the drug trade , some of whom he had previously represented , after significant arrests and informed them that he had taken the investigators of them .
prosecutors are lawyers , anne whyte said : “ a criminal prosecutor is supposed to be better than any other person to know that the law cannot be broken . ”
ditta is also accused of abuse of his position as a criminal .
the fragmentation is not simply the relationship of a drug dealer , but of a drug dealer who has to pay his lawyer for drugs .
a part of his communications was undoubtedly legitimate , but it was not the first to be the lawyer of these people .
but the same thing happened far beyond the borders of a normal relationship between lawyer and client .
he was also a member of the police investigation , and he was also a member of the police .
mr ditta raised the issue of the profession .
he was in charge of certain clients , and in particular scarborough , who was not allowed to be the only one to compromise his independence .
ditta wies has pointed out that any misconduct was unjustified and said : “ if i were a corrupt lawyer , what i am not , and if i had information to scborough , i would not have 15 hours .
but , after hearing the commissioner , superintent lee halstead said from the police in lancashire : “ mr ditta has the step from a criminal defence to a criminal . ”
his coalition government has been responsible for a hopelessly compromised and made him recipient of the motives of leading members of the organised crime , who have appointed him to provide valuable information on police investigations .
anglers must be given the highest standards of integrity .
ditta has this trust .
the serious and organized cad / cam crime-unit is a high-performance , high-performance , high-performance , low-cost , low-cost , low-cost , low-cost , low-cost , low-cost , low-cost , low-cost carrier .
this case should be brought to justice by criminals and shows that the perpetrators of terrorism are not being able to escape .
we find them and bring them to court .
scarborough himself was sentenced to 14 years in prison after being guilty of conspiracy to the heroin , cocaine and cannabis trade for school leavers .
fifty-five years later , the drug trade has been in the hands of a total of 15 000 people .
on its website , the ditta published a section with questions and answers about itself , in which he gave up his dream job .

the fair will be held in the context of the services of god , as the client johann philipp neumann intended .

hastings : skyscrapers are not a matter of confidence .
with the elections to the parish council of the municipality in 2015 , for example , the seafarers &apos; unit haslach ( se ) will change fundamentally .
it is also possible to use a common parish church in the town of santiago de compostela for all six parish churches .
in a common meeting , the heads of state and government of the haslah , hofstetten , mühlenbach , fischerbach , steinach and welschenstein prepared for the changes .
because , in principle , the decisions of the diocese are not something to change and there is no time to change the parish church councils .
in the course of the day , it became particularly clear that the scepticism about the new is dim , but is likely to be a confident one .
from the ideas and expectations of the new developments 2015 to the present concrete proposals on the future composition and the size of the parish church council , the european union &apos;s extremely constructive discussions have been extremely fruitful with the main tamil authorities .
regional decentralised georgia is a member of the international federation of independent media ( ict ) .
after that , the se haslach as a church community will in future form a body of public law that will be incorporated into the rights and duties of the six individual churches that have so far been active in the community .
it is only a small common arrow that is still to be built and a foundation council .
for each pond , the two parish churches should be represented .
your task will be to ensure that the kyrgyz life in the place is promoted in the future .
in the question of the finances of the individual parish community , the question of the financial situation was then very much in demand .
the new features include the possibility of using collected data to fund the new projects in the parish .
the binding nature of the debt is based on the general community .
it is precisely with regard to the major investments planned , the commitment of which will then be met by all parish parishes , that there was great concern .
&quot; even in the past , only in projects that were not yet implemented by the individual parish authorities were invested .
practical experience with a common body of experts for five parish councils .
you had already decided to set up a &apos; one &apos; in 2006 , five will remain &apos; and have had to discover that this is not so simple .
the bodies of the haslacher seafarers were then reminded of the issues of the future composition and size of the joint parish council and the practical work of the municipal teams .
the evaluation of the project will be conducted in a further session and will be presented in a further joint meeting of all six bodies next spring .
on the end , pfarrgemeinderat michael schöner presented the new logo of the seafarers &apos; unity , which was approved by a clear majority .
in pfullendorf , the electricity is more expensive than the electricity produced in the village .
the citizens have been able to see the people of pfalendorf pay for higher electricity costs .
as the managing director of the city works , jörg-arne bias , said in relation to the south curiosity , a four-person exhibition of the parish church of st. peter and the church of st. peter is charged .
the main reason for the upcoming price increases is the fact that the price increase is expected to be in the first quarter of 2008 , from 5.277 to 6.3 cent per kilowatt-hour .
this survey shows that the number of people who work in the internet is increasing by about 10 % every october .
this figure is a very important step in the process of energy change .
the city works have been transformed into a museum of the last link in the history of the town .
the supervisory board of the energy company was represented in its forecasts even by a higher conversion .
now , the concrete figures need to be calculated to enable the city works to be reformed next week by means of the exact price increase .
&quot; we go from a decent increase of 1 cents plus x , &quot; says the rapporteur , &quot; the increase is more in the near future than the 2 cent .
amphitheatre on permanent red : on warm days , you pay attention to the constant red light .
sometimes , a ampere is simply not green .
the contact loop in the street reacts not , or the light sign is defettered .
what should we do then - with rot , which is the only one in the world ?
has a affected user been in contact with a red amphitheatre for long enough time and the intersection is free , he can continue to drive , explains the stuttgart bar attorney ralf becker in the magazine &quot; motorrad &quot; .
the warm and cold water temperature should be &quot; appropriate &quot; , which is a case-by-case interpretation .
becker advises to use at least five minutes to stop before a function disorder of the traffic lights .
who wants to drive despite the red lights ?
who wants to spend less than five minutes waiting for the next one , may not wait long enough , becker and points out a decision by the supreme court .
in the draft negotiated agreement , the commission had a driver who had been on permanent red for about three minutes and had to be able to commit to a careless red red light offence .
the traffic lights were , in fact , not defective , but rather sprang down to green a little later .
a bike ban would have remained unchanged because of the particular situation - the money penalty , but not .
the municipal council is pleased with the sound budget and the good quality of its budget .
whenever a player is in community attendance , he or she is always entitled to a seat .
the community of the town of santiago de compostela is well filled with a lot of people and has known the administration since 2005 .
the european parliament &apos;s 2012-year 2012 can be seen as a complete success in this respect .
this was confirmed at the presentation of the annual accounts for 2012 .
as andrea rothmund explained , the debian project leader is a budget of around eur 7.6 million over a million .
the council also has a surplus of the administrative budget , which amounts to around eur 1.8 million , over the commission &apos;s approach .
the hotel is also a short walk from the main railway station and the main shopping street .
the council of europe ’ s wealth budget was also significantly above the planned value .
instead of the 1.5 million euros that was envisaged , it was eur 2.5 million last year .
&quot; this is in essence due to the higher allocation from the administrative budget &quot; , says rothmund .
as the committee on budgets has proposed less investment than was planned in 2012 , the commission is also concerned about the redeployment of funds .
overall , the general repayment of around eur 2.1 million was reduced to eur 4.9 million , which is currently around eur 4.9 million .
civil servants ralph gerster thanked the commission for the good work done by rothmund and her team .
&quot; so a work protects the people from the evil , but it is not a work of the past .
he and the non-profit organizations of the city were obviously pleased with the good figures .
it may seem paradoxical that the same thing is true , but the very good figures could soon be costly for the citizens .
by using the good financial situation , the municipality has been able to rely on high lifting rates in the past .
this in turn , however , is a fact that , according to gerster , subsidies have been cut off from the country on a number of occasions .
for this assurance , the commission has proposed a number of measures to be taken to ensure that the funds are available from various types of compensation .
under the new rules , cities and municipalities that receive subsidies must be able to make certain lifting rates , among other things .
&quot; the theme of lifting sets must be taken into account , as in the coming years investments are required , for which we would like to have received subsidies , &quot; announced gerster in this context .

the male character is a very important part of the group .
the song title is a salzburg song , which was a great success with his mixed choir and his group of women - the &quot; impulse changer &quot; - for the female quota of the festival .
the idea of joint chorus abducted the young woman from the prison with the neapolitan language , santa lucia and the eviva espana .

the celebrations of the fair will take place on sunday , november 3 , at 11.30 a.m.
the newly designed and extended optorial shines with a new café .
one thing that is needed to stay and return is the opportunity to relax and recharge .
one thing that makes the name of the program .
as a déjà vu , the term is &quot; a psychological term &quot; , &quot; a phenomenon that is reflected in the sense that a new situation has been experienced or seen before .
in the case of the visit of the same-name café on the victim in the district town of kleve in sight to the university of rhein-waal , it must not be at the pure déjà vu feeling .
finally , the café has a big terrace with its beautiful name .
because &apos; s just fun , and simply beautiful is .
a look into the interior at the opschlag 8 gives the viewer an idea of the real world .
the high-tech , but not cool , café bar is the ideal place to relax and enjoy a drink .
here you can enjoy the best of the region ’ s culinary traditions , with the founder mirjam van der stet and daniel büttner at the top .
this is done by the delicious culinary creations or by individually heated freshly baked products .
the insiders , both 33 years old , have already decided to go to the court before the dirty cafés opened .
from the move to kleve to the opera , the victims hope to be able to enjoy the friendly cafe lovers more than ever .

in the last few years , daniel büttner has been the expresso fan and mirjam van der stelt the cappuccino trinker .
&quot; to do this a bacuette - that is my thing , &quot; betrays the nrz .
two events took place in the same year already in the bright café .
better to be honest .
because the port festival took place more outside the place - that &apos;s the café déjà vu .
but it was also the beef and veal evening .
&quot; it is nice , successful and funny , &quot; the two 33-year-old ones found .
but it is not everyone who is interested .
perhaps it is daniel büttner who is not a very good fan of event-abenden because he is &quot; you can &apos;t do it all right &quot; .
and with a real event , i always speak only to those who are also interested in the special event .
that is why events are more likely to be the exception .
&quot; we want to make the normal operation as little as possible , &quot; he said .
should it mean that déjà vu is also a reliable partner for us .

the commission has already made a significant contribution to the development of the european union in the field of sport and the promotion of sport .
&quot; you have not only had a lot for us written down , but you have also given some laps for us , our heartfelt thanks for that , &quot; the chairman of the chorus erich schlotmann .
the evaluation of the new programme is a very important one .

the united nations is beginning to act as a global response to a number of new objectives , with the aim of reducing the millennium development goals announced twelve years ago .
in the run-up to the un summit on sustainable development , which will be held in rio de janeiro in the evening , australian diplomats played a key role in the drive for “ sustainable development goals ” that could be implemented in 2015 .
you have been elected to the european parliament &apos;s final draft .
un secretary-general ban ki-moon declared in the evening at the summit that the time has come to talk about “ national interests . ”
“ i am delighted that the european union ’ s member states have agreed to provide a process in which the eu can work together to establish universal , sustainable development goals .
“ this is what we are trying to achieve in the millennium development goals .
i will not tire of wanting to repeat this issue that was put to me by the member states , in order to redefine our vision of sustainable development goals , which are based on the success of the millennium goals . ”
the fact that the sg achim / baden has been in the team for four days without a victory is still a bit of a bit of a bit of a bit of a bit of a bit of a bit of a bit of luck .
this is why trainers tomasz malmon can &apos;t be in any doubt .
all are still fully motivated and willing to work with each other .
nevertheless , i hope that we can finally get back to it .
&quot; for i know that i am not even sure how so a victory schmeckt &quot; , he expects a success .
the fact that the third liga reserves are to be financed from fredenbeck currently does not make it possible to cover the costs of the project in advance .
many players have already made a deposit in the a-jugend .
from this point of view , they are being violated against their ex-coach .
&quot; in addition , we must wait for the next two years to see if further strengthening is possible &quot; , explains the sg-coach .
to finally return to the success story , the commission has been forced to focus on the issue of the european union &apos;s external policy , which has been somewhat improved in comparison with previous appearances .
before all , in the cover area , and in the switching of haperte , it was finally enormous .
the commission also considers the use of opportunities to be a definite improvement .
therefore , i hope that my players will be able to play at last during the short break .
security concerns in moscow are not a problem in the face of clashes between powerful personalities and the opposition .
thousands of people gathered in the village centre of maputo to to observe the animals and the statue of samora machel , the state founder of the city and first president mozambique , to help with a rare public demonstration of peace .
“ we want to restore peace , we want stability , ” said vanessa de sousa , managing director of an investment company .
for fear of the future of the country , it has changed its business clothes against a t-shirt with the “ we demand security ” label on portuguese .
since two weeks there is almost daily reports of breakdowns between government forces and renamo , which have been one of the worst battles since the peace agreement more than 20 years ago .
renamo was a member of the famous american film series , which was originally a notorious rebel movement , and was initially governed by the rhodesia regime , and later by south africa &apos;s aparthotels .
after the peace treaty of 1992 , it was transformed into an opposition party .
analysts keep it as unlikely that the country will return to a full-blown conflict , with the us and japan ’ s recent events have left foreign investors and locals worried .
for the fast growing economy , much is at stake , because the discovery of huge reserves of gas is a challenge for the european union and for the coal industry in the north west could be a huge source of investment of more than usd 50 billion in the coming years from companies such as brazil .
the registering freedom party is not a party that has been in power since 1975 , and renamo is a mutually immortal blame for the tensions .
renamo claims that the government has not yet taken into account the recent clashes by making a statement on 17 october to its members in the province of sofala , a traditional renaissance stronghold .
the overwhelming majority of the population of the country is now living in the camps .
the government spends renamo the blame for the clashes and accuses the organization of killing soldiers .
president armando guebuza has tried to raise concerns about an instability that has been caused by the crisis .
opposite afp , the french post-war news agency , he said on wednesday that he had been arrested for using dhlakama as a “ loser ” who was “ all his remaining supporters . ”
both frelimo and the renault team stress that the time has come to avoid war .
but the concerns have been growing , since maastricht and amsterdam were linked to the words &apos; the euro is a currency of the future &apos; .
opposite the ft , he explained that i have meant that the debian project has been using frelimo to disregard the agreement .
“ our vision is to be back in negotiations and to do so seriously , ” said mazanga .
previous versions of the talks between the parties have had little to do with resolving the tensions that have been caused by a series of clashes this year .
“ we have a two-adult man here ( guebuza and dhlakama ) , who is the heads of the two “ , says the josephh hannon , lecturer at the open university and mozart .
none of them is good in the negotiations and none is prepared to accept the necessary concessions .
renamo , the world &apos;s most important electoral reform , has already stated that it will not take the local elections in november boycott .
presidential elections and elections are not a matter of time for next year .
some commentators have suggested using gender-based violence as an attempt to prevent a wear-ridden movement from making concessions and financial concessions from the government .
renaming a new version of the game , renamos has been shrinking since 1992 , while a newer party , led by a former renamo member , has been running out of office .
do you want to know more about the history of guebuza ?
“ he wants no more multi-party democracy , he wants no transparent elections , he wants a free peace , because he wants to hold the presidency .
it is unclear whether the member states have the capacity to provide renamo , but it has caused unrest on the police stations and vehicles on an important north-south connection .
the majority of the battles took place in the province of sofala , which was a few hundred kilometres north of maputo , in which the two parties are still in the port , the mountain building industry and the rio tinto .
in june , the us underwent a month of rio ’ s use of the railways , after renamo had attacked the track .
do you want to know more about the history of mazanga ?
renamo wanted to “ strengthen the international community , warn that things are going wrong in mozambique , ” he said .
the instability has caused the frustration of the government even more .
“ the people think that the world ’ s government and president are responsible for the country ’ s future , and that they should be the ones who provide solutions to the problems , ” he explains .
omar sultane , a protestant , was saying that the people wanted to be just stability .
“ no interested in renamo and frelimo , they want to just go back to peace and usable roads , ” he explained .
children should be myths and legends as “ precursors for life ” .
the stories of the thor showed that the two “ brutal power ” did not have a chance to fight clever tricks , ” and the artus legend demonstrated how important it was to create a dream .
many of the myths are not “ at all ” .
“ i find it wonderful that the european union is now using myths and folklore as part of education , ” said he .
i have the feeling that this has been a plan for twenty years .
he added that the commission is not a party to the rules of the game , and that is why he has been so keen to make the game a reality .
crosslevel support is a very popular sport in the netherlands , with the beowulf translated from anglo-saxon and author of the penguin book of norse myths and the british folk tales .
the perhaps biggest difference between a adult and a child is that he writes for adult and an author who is responsible for children .
not everything has to be simplified or , in order to be able to end , but there is an immanent sense of good and evil .
this must be signed and signed .
the first is the old story of showing instead of telling .
hlsjakob is once again moving to freihof .
before 100 years , hineinrich hansjakob has been in the company of his retirement in haslach , and on sunday his last years were living in the &quot; freihof &quot; .
the many satisfied spectators were impressed by the extremely short scenic performance .

and then began the scenario of the game , in which alois krafczyk once again played in his paraderoll as the great son of the city .
stillness drove him to the two-sided and &quot; black forest &quot; foxes .
he was not only elected by the audience with great applause , but also his sister philippine hieß called him welcome .
bible is a game of billy sum , and he was incredibly good at interacting with the sister .
between the different players , the game was played by the mill farm chapel , which was selected for the music and therefore rounded off the performance .
a number of other important issues are the issue of the right to vote in the elections .
your orders will be delivered to the triangle and singer , who played hansjakob at the call for the release of &quot; ah how beautiful , you will be able to get youth inducements to my own three-year old &quot; .
with its loving song &quot; o jesulin &quot; , the young girl was able to enjoy the outdoor patio and the storchentagskinder with their loud &quot; out &quot; .
his criticism of the government church had been made by hansjakob , just as his concerns about the excesses in the agricultural sector that have affected the consequences of industrialisation or the effects of war .
in the hot summer season , the sun is shining behind its grave chapel on the fire near hofstetten .
&quot; a non-calm place , i finally had his peace and was ready for ever . &quot; he said .
much applause for the work that has been done , and many praise for the audience .
based on the basketball team , the hope of the neckar giant grows .
the opportunities for the liga-remaining of the sporty distanced ludwigsburger bundesliga basketballer have increased .
because if it were a wildcard procedure , it would be possible for the neckar giants to have a competitors less .
the basque country football team is a team of young musicians from the german basketball association ( basketball association ) .
&quot; we will not be on the wildcard procedure &quot; , said ex-national player pascal roller , who has been in the concept of a professional club in the hannesstadt since 2012 .
a first call for a new era was made from ludwigsburg , however .
&quot; we employed a lot of the wildcard process , so long as we did not realize that düsseldorf was not granted a licence , &quot; said neckar riesen-boss alexander reil of our newspaper .
until the 23rd of may , climbers of düsseldorf basketts can still obtain documents from the arbitration court and have their economic federal liga-suitability proven .
so far , the rheinland have not been granted the licence twice .
the sliding court is the last instance of the court .

the spread of food allergies among children has , according to the cdc , increased by 18 % between 1997 and 2007 .
the guidelines contain information for schools , which is not available to the teaching body and the staff for food allergies .
it is also recommended to use schools of epinephrin to prepare the children for the school .

no one knows why it is happening .
it is like the secret of being able to kill homosexuals .
in a report to the european commission from the year 2011 , it says that intersexual people are excluded from transsexual services .
this feature showed that the new version of the game was a little more complex than the previous one , and was not so easy to use .
the report gives a clear overview of the discrimination that exists in the field of intersexual and transgenic persons in the workplace and of the extent of the harassment , violence and prejudice that women suffer .
not with the gender aspect , but with the fact that the young have a special camp .
meanwhile , it is in australia and nepal for adults to access official documents of male and female origin .
in june , australian norrie may-welby ( 52 ) was appointed the first “ gender-free ” person in the world after a court had declared the lifetime maintenance of a “ undefined ” gender status .

the mother of a newborn child from maryland explained to baby zone that she catches it better , if babies were to be born a sexy .
“ the misery of parental leave is still a problem , even without further restrictions .
children need stability and security .
historically , the children who were born with both male and female children were not given the opportunity to participate in the education system .
i was just ten years ago , when medicine looked at the gender as something that could be eliminated and then rebuilt .
but now , the ethical and political foundations of an operation are being questioned , after it is now known how complex the gender identity is , and that doctors are also wrong .
“ in the mid-20th century , the word “ one ” was called psychiatric emergency , ” says drescher .
if a system of this kind was born , then it was not the psychiatrist who was called , but the surgeon .
the ruling elite theory of the treatment of children with unclear sexual genital conditions is based on dr. john money of the johns hope foundation .
he also played the term “ gender stereotype ” and argued that social and environmental factors are inherently incompatible with the way parents draw a child .
but in a country that is known as john / joan , the us government has been able to impose a ban on its theories .
he called for the parents of a young boy whose penis was killed by a food chain .
“ money presented the new case as a successful example of a reversal that was not possible , ” he said .
as the young boy was about 15 , he changed back to the male boy , and was married to a woman who had been married .
with 38 but i did begin self-murder .
according to the drescher , there are still doctors who have not yet practised this model .
but in the 1990 ’ s , with the collapse of the internet , the vast majority of survivors of these gender operations were directed to the public , who “ were not happy with the result . ”
for example , in jim bruce , a 36 year old author from montana , who was working with xy-male chromosomes , he was two months old , but ambiguous genitalia .
the doctors are not sure whether they would be able to make a big climatoris or a small penis , and they were convinced that they could never have a “ satisfying life ” as a man .
so , his external budget was not adequately represented , and the hoden were not even chirurgically removed shortly after birth in 1976 , and he was captured as a girl .
in the age of 12 , he was given female hormones .
“ i knew that i was a good friend , ” he said .
i was unhappy with the result , but it was really difficult to ask questions .
in the age of 18 he should have a vaginal plastic .
but , as he is depressed , and he knew that he was doing something wrong , he was demanding that he be treated as a medical act .
what he points out is that it was shocking .
i was born in the netherlands and was born in germany .
bruce was played by a dsd , which made his body unheard of .
after having been telling the truth , he moved to the university of manchester , where he received a master &apos;s degree in economics from testosteron-injections .
by using the operation , it is infertile .
today , the country is struggling for others in an organisation called interface project to make intersexual relations a reality .
but , anne tamar-mattis , managing director of the company that was established in california , was not able to identify the problem .
“ many activists are concerned that the government of germany is encouraging parents to take quick decisions .
we fear that the european union will be favourably disadvantaged by interventions .
we think that it would be better to have the male or female right to be treated .
but even more we do not know how the law will affect , so we cannot do anything other than speculate .
tamar-mattis said that her organization supports the australian law , because “ it allows adults to take the recognition as the third sex ” .
“ adult should be able to learn to use their own decisions on their legal sex . ”
in the german law , the issue is the allocation of the birth of the child .
the first is not a fight that can be fought by small children at this time .
if you are growing up , you can choose to have your own body .
but dr arlene baratz , a brother of the sister of pithenian , was not able to get a daughter with a sexual differentiation disorder and was able to take hundreds of others to help .
katie , the daughter of karel gott , was born with male choirs , and was a member of the family of dsd .
because of the recipe defect of the target cells for testosterone , katie feminine characteristic has been developed .
you have a vagina , but no uterus and no eggs .
today , katie 29 and verheirated ; she works on the university of california , and she is a member of the staff of the university of pennsylvania .
while the commission is infertile , it hopes that the adoption of children or the temporary mother will bring a child .
“ the law gives parents room to make their children unhurried .
it is a powerful tool that allows you to perform various tests and to clarify things and give you time to test them .
on this basis , everything is in order – you are not taking the child seriously and loving it .
it has a wonderful feeling of being a baby and enjoys the parental happiness .
and it must not be hasty to take an operation that is not restricted to the last one .
“ the company includes children in the decision .
finally , the european union will decide on the sex , which is better suited to it – and that is wonderful .
this will help children to be able to develop the choice themselves .
unfamiliar publishers injure girls by shot from car , and the police are now destroying them .
unfamiliar people have a lot of fun with shots from a car in saxony-anhalt .
the perpetrators had a very good chance to get their hands on the tide in gent on thursday evening with an air force .
the partial result was that the police in burg shared that .
the girl is easy to get on the left wade .
retton forces broke the girl into hospital , and the girl was killed .
the shoot came from a small car , which was on a group of six children .
witnesses saw two people in the car sitting .
the perpetrators were also shocked by a bus stop .
a disk is dissolved and the wall was broken .
then the two men drove from the house .
the criminals are now investigating , saying that they were told on friday .
until the present time , the police inspections can only stop kempten in a calm halloween night .
the officials were merely twice as much in the oaths of the children who were forced to take them out of their homes .
as the house owners are not going to recognize this in time and the oasters are just as distant , no material damage has been caused .
furthermore , the report also contains a number of sylvester floors .
a fixed price for a single room is $ 25.00 per night .
until the first flight of police , the man has not yet finished his sledgehammer , however , in the immediate vicinity of everyone , so the police have not had to take any further action .
this hotel is situated in the heart of the city , close to the main shopping area and the main shopping street .
in fact , waltraud ries lives in a dream .
your house is located in a quiet residential area of stuttgart , with plenty of green , a old tree house , neat neighbours and also not too much traffic .
in the city are the only few minutes by public transport .
&quot; you have hopefully no fear of spiders ? &quot; asks waltraud ries and shows in a fat spinnee at the door frame .
i am looking for a new version of the apartment for my husband and myself for some time .
but they know that the commission is difficult to do so in stuttgart .
the reason is that there is no spider phobia , but rather a concern to get the many staircase steps to the house and the apartment in old age to be unable to cope with .
moreover , since a menikus operation , the middle fifties have been on her own body .
before the first world war , a book was published by her on the theme of &apos; happy living in old age - what kind of living is the best for me ? &apos; .
&apos;our apartment is the best example of how we can make a living in the age of 18 &apos; , begins to tell you .
as they were in the european union more than 20 years ago with their husband , they were not able to get a nice apartment in the middle of the green .
today , in the mid-fifties , waltraud ries thinks differently about this .
you know , however , that you have been one of the few people who have ever looked at the subject of &apos; living in the age &apos; .
the majority of them are exporting it until it is done .
old are still only the other &apos; , says she wrote .
only when the passion for the moment really is great will i be able to think about it .
&apos;then i can &apos;t wait for a long time &apos; , says richard wagner .
in its book , the interior architects , 17 residential models , are designed for a self-determined living in old age .
&apos;what kind of accommodation can you choose , &apos; he said .
d i e solution i give it not for the age .
even if you look at the age of retirement in tuscany or bretagne , you will find that you are always well aware that you are also becoming ill .
and : &apos; without good knowledge of the national language , the european union also unites the languages of the world in dolce vita , &apos; says the specialist bookmaker of those willing to exile .
under your models , you will find classic support services such as alternative housing , or the often cited profitability wg .
in the age of the age of 18 , everyone has their own tips and tricks and make their own pieces .
&apos;for me , it would be a community of living but nothing &apos; , says she with a eye catcher .
the european union is not , as in a student wg with a shared bathroom and a kitchen .
&apos;in the old age , you just need to get back your rooms &apos; , says ries .
the fact that senior citizens &apos; residency is still able to function is something that the book author does not want to rule out .
the problem must be solved differently .
and sometimes i want to be just a little quiet , &apos; believes it .
with this opinion , it is at least in the capital of the state .
&apos;the majority of old people in stuttgart are keen to work for as long as they are in their own home &apos; , is also the experience of therea rütten , the head of the civil service life at the age of the capital .
your services will advise you on the subject of the &quot; elderly &quot; , the &quot; old &quot; and the &quot; new &quot; .
that is why older people in particular would often be uncomfortable and restrictions on their freedom to use the internet .
the first is that there are many ways to get the house or apartment accessible .
ries recommends that all those who are interested in the age fair use of their house or apartment should contact the hotel before they can make a reservation .
today , there are also many new member states for the renovation of existing buildings .
even in the rental apartment lamp the water is one or two .
but not always can be the existing apartment be adapted to the age and thus accessible .
this experience had to be shared by waltraud ries .
while the commission could be expected to make a stairlift inside the apartment , which is also covered with stairs , it could be used as a living room .
you will be able to continue your search until you have the ideal object for yourself and your husband .
before the conversion , gray it was more than a week before the spinning at your living room .
usa wants to ban snowden further from prosecuting .
the us has its attitude to the former us intelligence officer edward snow , who was not present .
he will continue to be accused of being unauthorised to pass on secret information .
therefore , we must be able to rely on a criminal trial in the united states , said the us secretary of state , jennifer psaki , in washington .
the commission &apos;s recent statements on the situation in the russian federation would not change that either .
previously , the german founder of the company , hans-christian ströbele , had a meeting with snowden in moscow to discuss the usa .
psa is a very important part of the project , and it is a very important part of the process of the process .
secret services are the key to the success of edward snow &apos;s secret service development .
first of all , however , he wants to know his situation .
the result of the work of the united states former nsa commission staff in a non-administered letter made this clear , which was not submitted to the green politician hans-christian ströbele on friday after a meeting with snowden .
the letter has , after a streamlined and more complex translation , been translated :
the commission &apos;s competent authorities must be informed of the relevant decisions and the relevant decisions of the council .
i was asked to give you a detailed answer on your inquiry into mass surveillance .
i welcome the edward josephh snowden and i was previously a contractor or a direct employee as a technical expert at the national security agency .
in the course of my work in these institutions , i witnessed systematic legislative violations in my government , which led me to vote against the report on moral obligation .
as a result of the publication of these concerns , i was faced with a serious and persistent hedge which forced me to leave my family and my home .
i live in the middle east , and i enjoy the temporary work of the police and the police .
i am encouraged to hear from the resonance to my political action , both in the united states and elsewhere .
citizens on the whole world and also high official figures are the ones who are the victims of the deeds .
this spiral of violence is a source of concern to many of the proposals for new laws and directives , which are based on the previously hidden agenda abuse of public confidence .
the benefits for the society from these experiences are not limited to the benefits of the new technologies , but at the same time , the risks that have been bought have been clearly reduced .
although the result of my efforts has been demonstrably positive , my government is treating dissent as a faithful and is seeking to prevent political expression .
nevertheless , the truth is not enough .
i am confident that the european union &apos;s government will be able to make a positive contribution to this harmful attitude with the support of the international community .
i hope that the commission will , if the difficulties of this humanitarian situation are resolved , be able to provide the necessary assistance to me in the proper investigation of the facts concerning the cases in which the media have been made , particularly with regard to truth and authenticity .
i am pleased to see you in the future .
edward snow has been awarded the nobel prize for literature by hans-christian ströbele .
child garden has a private buyer found .
&quot; the building is in good hands &quot; , says winterlingen &apos;s mayor michael maier .
the former children ’ s garden in the garden street has been transformed into a private individual .

the building was changed to a hotel , which was &quot; reasonable &quot; .
&quot; the community is happy &quot; , emphasises maier .
in the budget , eur 100 000 was set aside .
i have not yet been clear how the new owner will be able to use the former kindergarten .
the ombudsman has been able to make a significant contribution to the management of the building before the winter .
&quot; this effort is now away &quot; , i am glad to see maier .

report : obama-campaign considered how to make bids accessible through hillary clinton .
the endemic consultants of president barack obama have been in the secret of thinking , vice-president joe biden , in the 2012 election campaign , replaced by hillary clinton , with the new york times .
the decoupling of the situation is the most significant achievement of the european parliament &apos;s long-awaited work by mark halperin and john heilemann on the 2012 election campaign , &quot; double down : game change 2012 .
the times is a former exporter of the upcoming timesheet , which is now being reported to the press on thursday evening , that the dead are being killed by president ’ s top advisers .
according to jonathan martin , national political correspondence , the british national press , the country ’ s book is thoroughly drawing on the history of the efforts of leading officials in the campaign and the white house , in particular the former white house chief of staff .
the potential benefits of the change were a strictly guarded and secret .
only a half-century later , the us economy ’ s closest advisers – including daley , the former campaign leader , jim messinga , and the former chief executive , of the white house , david axelrod , and david .
in “ double-down ” , the claim is that dacey has led the effort to make the biden a world leader despite its “ close , personal relationship . ”
in a interview with the martin , he confirmed that the european union is not really concerned about how to make bids accessible through clinton .
“ i am not expressing a whole series of things that can be considered , but i am not doing so .
it is important to remember that the european council president , at the time , was terribly questionable , so we thought : “ for god ’ s sake , what do we do ? ”
during davy &apos;s investigations were described as &quot; a necessary care &quot; , the company said that he was not responsible for the inquiries to anderson cooper from cnn .
“ in campaigns , the focus is not so much money on surveys and focus groups as on the “ more serious ” issue .
it is , however , not clear whether obama knew that the us congress team had a share of it .
martin said to cnn that he had thought of dally if his then leader was the boss over the potential change .
although the commission has not explained that it does not believe that the european parliament &apos;s president will be “ aware of the change that may occur ” , the former chief of staff announced that it was “ possible ” to prevent obama from doing so .
martin added that the debian project is not a double down , but a single , global response to the question of whether the political songs are in obama ’ s desk .
cooper wondered martin , if he would seriously think obama has nothing of the investigations about how to use the new version of biden in the elections .
“ possible ” , the response was by martin .
what happens when i am on the road ?
e-mail is not really an electronic letter , as it is .
was the design of the internet service a similar e-mail as with the traditional mail .
in the design of the early internet services , the focus was on providing communication .
therefore , the commission &apos;s basic technical protocols did not take into account the need to establish a stable foundation for consultation with the public .
therefore , a heroic e-mail is more like an open postcard than a sealed letter .
if users are &quot; anna &quot; interested in &quot; benni &quot; send an email , they are not registered with the same e-mail address ?
the e-mail program or the browser of anna schickt will send the mail to the mail-server of your service provider in the first step .
if you are looking for a gmail account , you might want to use google .
this magic spell server sends the content to the provider , the benni uses .
on the route you can send the mail via a number of other servers on the internet .
bennie can change the content in his provider .
will herbal medicines be used on your way ?
the majority of mails are sent multiple times by software robots .
the commission has a problem with the sender &apos;s provider .
on the recipient pages , the user is also provided with a virus check .
in addition , the providers who provide the service check whether it is a tiring and unwanted spam mail .
have the roboters not yet been given another task ?
in systems such as gmail , the robot automatically detects the information that google has to provide for the placement of context advertising .
if anna and benni are sent by gmail via their forthcoming holiday journey , the google may provide links to holiday applications .
read the unfamiliar people who are not familiar with the e-mails ?
the probability of a single person being killed by unauthorized persons is very high .
in theory , the problem is possible .
in companies , the administration often has the opportunity to send electronic mail .
the commission also has a responsibility to the law enforcement authorities and the secret services to send e-mails or to take note of them .
this is accompanied by possible illegal segregation actions .
is it possible to send e-mails against reading ?
with a encryption after the openpgp standard , a mail can effectively be read against mitreading .
with a high technical effort , it is also possible to use metadata of an e-mail communication .
as regards the importance of yahoo and google on the e-mail market in germany ?
in the case of the mainly privately used postal addresses , yahoo and google play a role in the development of the internet , according to a survey conducted by convios consulting from august 2013 .
during the initial investment , yahoo-mail had fallen , the company was able to make gmail clear .
mother in the forest disappeared and rented kasiert .
as his crew was killed , he was killed by a group of men who had been killed by a plan from wolfsburg .
he was also a member of the united nations security council , and was a member of the un security council .
to continue renting and care services , we need to have a european public health fund ( eba ) , a 67-year-old wolfsburg , which has lost its dead mother after investigation of the police in the forest .
first of all , he condemned the death of the 89-year-old , then he had lost the money more than a year and a half .
now , the council of 67 years must be allowed to be responsible for fraud , as a spokesman said on friday .
consequently , the commission hid the man and hid the woman in a forest near helmstedt .
the suspects are not allowed to be arrested in may : at that time , they were already being held responsible for the need for care .
the ermittlerinnen told the pensioners to leave his mother to spain .
because the officials have been curious about this , they told me that they had to go on .
the first step was to find out that the two had been in a common flat for more than 15 years and they had recently been cared for .
the 67-year-old finally got the death of his mother .
a homogeneous period of time , according to the police , did not show any evidence of a capital crime .
luck to ice cream , the most darkly shining ?
a british minister , in his first year of work , has the first in the dark ice to be developed – using qualms .
charlie chaplin , the former president of the united states , was a fluorescent character .
the idea is that he would be able to do research on quals .
the eiscreme reacts to the skin with the tongue , which makes the ph value in the protein .
christian : &quot; i &apos;m not a fan of the menu , but i &apos;m a fan of the menu .
charlie chaplin , founder of the ice cream company “ lick me i ’ m delicous ” , says : “ the product is incredibly , but still in a very early production phase .
the hotel is located in the eiiscreme , and reacts with the tongue in a neutral ph-value .
if the mouse is not the protein , the sound is rising .
we have managed to achieve a great deal in recent months and it seems to us ideal to use it on halloween on the market .
it is probably the most expensive ice cream , which i have ever made , because the quallenlights are not the same as four times more expensive than gold .
each cubic coil costs me about 140 pounds .
but that is what the people of the world are looking for .
charlie ’ s experimental company with headquarters in bristol is famous for its innovative and innovative products .
but his latest version of the story is to be more ambitious .
he says : ‘ i want to have an invisible egg cream . ’
the first is that this is impossible in itself because of the light that is generated by the ice crystals .
the eiscreme uses the fluorescient properties of a qualle , which is artificially produced by chinese scientists .
the tsv morsum is certified according to the iso 9001 : 2000 standard after six days .
the european union is now facing a major challenge for the ingo ehler team tomorrow .
with this game , the season begins for us .
&quot; i hope that the next time we will have a head free , &quot; says ehler &apos;s behavior .
the commission has finally taken the initiative , with the exception of the permanent injured hendrik blohme , to make its complete body available .
the hotel is also a perfect base for exploring the city .
therefore , we must redouble our error rate .
in the first place , we must , however , ensure that the funds are used to finance anything but safe .
it is a very relaxed place to go and enjoy the coach thomas panitz after the first season victory against north horn .
the game was , of course , a house number .
but that is why we are still a long way from being the preferred option , because the derby can always happen .
the commission , however , wants to look into this in morsum , to find a series of things .
if there is a missing jan-malte jodat .
for this , the a-jugendliche joost windßuß , who has been awarded double the a-jugendgäufige hc bremen prize , celebrates his seasonal debut .
who in such a game does not heal , should listen at home .
hello , i am a member of the european parliament , and i am sure that i will be able to count on your support in the coming months .
as i was small , i had a lot of fun with hallo .
my sister and i were allowed to drink sweet things .
today i am more interested in the halloween muffle .
in the last two years i have been unable to explain why i am speaking from my home in sweets .
but , according to the statistics , i am a black sheep , which is halloween .
the majority of americans – 158 million , to be precise – have been celebrating halloween this year and are spending a total of 6.9 billion dollars on sweet and savoury products .
a matter that i would like to focus on every halloween then .
the kostüme is made up of about 1.2 billion of the 6.9 billion dollars spent , so the nrf .
in this year , orders for the new album are exciting and unlived .
women must be able to move freely in sexy clothes , they can now also be seductive food like the pizza , hamburger or carottes .
what men are doing , i expect every single zoom lens i can get .
according to google , most of the searches are costumes zoombies , batman , pirates and hexen .
i suspect that it is not a bad thing to have tradition .
we have seen last year our dogs and we have seen the dogs in the gallery .
indeed , americans spend 330 million dollars this year on costume of their pets , so the nrf .
the first is that the first thing you can do is to have a good time with your friends .
what southern africa is not about is the fact that we are not sweets .
americans will not be able to spend $ 1.9 billion this year , so the nielsen company .
the first two years of the war were marked by a series of changes in the structure of the economy , and the number of people living in the country increased by about 270 million .
so good news for the according us trade ministry 41 million people , who are in the &quot; south american &quot; or &quot; saures &quot; with the sweets or saures &quot; .
indeed , we will have more than 40 million kilograms of chocolate for halloween and , let us not be fooled , eat it .
the only thing that we do not consume is to eat sugar .
the first two years of the war were marked by a massive increase in the number of people living in the country .
it is a mystery that the commission is not yet able to resolve .
nothing is more part of halloween than houses , in which there are spurious .
you have done a great job , such as “ terror , ” and you have a great deal of work to do in a real prison , “ hope , ” and “ the need to fight terrorism . ”
it is true that there are 1,200 officially recognised spukh houses in the united states , which provide $ 500 million in revenue , so america haunts , and that includes the wonderful examples of photos that we have been able to take .
but let us finally come to the shorter ones .
charlie chaplin , in his report , gave us the great impression that we were children , and that was how we cut a shorter bite is like a smuggling of christmas tree – something that we have been able to do from small .
fortunately , the war began in the united states in the shorbis , only last year thanks to pintest , so most of us could be grown up with it to make the shortest possible cuts and not to be in it .
this year , americans will spend about $ 106 million on cutbacks , so the us census bureau has said .
the reduction in the number of people slowly moving forward in the front garden is a result of the illinois , where this year 245 million kilometres of shorter cuts have been harvested .

the fire brigade had to be closed at the late afternoon in helmborg .
a three-family house in the district of hof begins in the night to friday fire .
the retton forces risk a devastation of the body .
retton forces have been working hard in a fire in helmborg .
whether it is a new resident or a new member of the family , it is still unclear how a police spokesman in bayreuth said .
on the late thursday afternoon , the commission had a meeting with the president of the european parliament on the ground floor .
as the fire broke , the police were swallowing up the fire from a window .
the application forces went into the apartment and found the light bulb in a room .
this and a further room branded completely , and the hotel was completely renovated .
the entire earthquake was damaged and the building was destroyed .
all other residents were killed during the fire , and the fire was declared a fortress .
the building is predominantly unoccupied , but it is a little bit like a hotel .
the exact cause of the fire was initially not clear .
germany ’ s largest national church has a more offensive culture .
background is a possible compromise between the church and the church .
for young people from today , the profession is very attractive and offers a good future prospects .
it is attractive to have the labour and social day of the day in place .
with burfien , the country ’ s church has for the first time built a pastor on a full place , providing young people with a degree of theoretical knowledge .
at present , more and more young people are choosing to work after the abitur , theology .
burfia is leading this to the process of decarbonisation : &quot; god &apos;s voice is quiet , the world is loud &quot; .
the commission &apos;s job should be of great freedom and diversity .
i am grateful to mr meier for his calendar and i can set my priorities where i feel it is important .
pastors could be considered a soullover close to the people .
you are paid for as much as teachers and you could benefit from it .
certainly i will be able to do more in the free economy , but theologians would have a safe employer for that .
the second is the young people of today who are not allowed to be careers , but to have a sense of life .
after the commission &apos;s own investigation , the national assembly of the three districts of lower saxony is currently running around 60 pastors in the retirement age each year .
at the same time , about 40 graduates of a theological college start their vikariat .
in thin covered areas , the population of the harz region , the emsland and the wendland , it may be difficult to find jobs in the future .
burfia wants to be a student day for young people , among others , and to be a prominent member of the public , who studies theology .
the themologist studies offer a broad education .
it is not even possible to call the federal president .

we are pleased to welcome this step in partnership with land rover and the msa .
we had really fun to work with the defender challenge manager , and i hope that the team will be entertaining .
in addition , there are a number of different options available for the defender challenge .
fire extinguishing : the fire is now a part of the life of the dog .
cockerspaniel-bitch ruby was born after a minor traffic accident .
three days later , she was killed by a walker in the quarry in her misfortune .
fire brigades rope in the rocky walls and the fire saved the hound from the safe fire .
the fire brigade managed to keep a dog in the dark .
the nine months old cockerspaniel bitch ruby was after a traffic accident at sundays afternoon and was still in the early days of the hunt , three days alone , before she was taken out of a quarry on wednesday .
scott alderson , 25 , and his girlfriend becky hall , 20 , whom the dog is a member , came to the quarry flapit in denholme , west yorkshire , to return .

you are in the middle of the island , and you can see the rocks at 15 meters from the top and the bottom .
you moved on from a muscle to a little bit more than a little bit of a little bit .
but now it is up to her .
you have subsequently made a few dogs and you can see that the whole thing is very good .
the reason for this was quite unusual .
the fact that the council has not discovered the dog is incredible .
peter lau , specialist in the technical retrofitting team , has said : “ ruby had a giant problem with the rescue . ”
it was the possibility of the commission being very seriously injured or worse .
ruby was first mentioned in the name of a veterinary surgeon , but he was not dehydrated and dehydration .
beecky hall is made of halifax , west yorkshire , said : “ when the rescue was done , it was frightening . ”
i could not even believe that the commission was really up there .
it was wonderful to see you again in the poor .
the animal doctor explained that if the reproductive process leads to a reduction in the depletion , it would probably have fallen .
the fire brigade has a great deal to do .
it was really courageous to do what you did .
we are simply so grateful and everyone of you was absolutely incredible .
scott alderson from kheimley added that the debian project has had fear of being overloaded .
the fire brigade was great .
i can hardly believe that the people who were there were .
mike jagger explains that he has written katy perry never , when she was 18 .
in a interview with the german australian radio station this week , the pop star said that she was a background-singer and was interested in jaggers song “ old habits the hard ” from 1904 .
perry explained that they have started to use the altrocker in the evening and that “ he asked me to do something about it when i was 18 . ”
you can also add that “ the problem is that we have been doing this for a long time and he was very nice to me . ”
in a statement , a representative jaggers , 70 , on thursday , said that he was “ categorically opposed to ever being rapprochement with qaty perry ” .
the representative added that the “ perhaps the most important thing to do is to change it with someone else . ”
perry was a major singer of the band , and was a member of the rolling-stones-tour this year .

george w. bush ’ s “ european enthusiasm ”
a new day , a new terrible tragedy , to independence .
this time , we will be warned that a more independent scotland will be required to join the euro zone .
the company provides the key word for skill about passport controls in berwick and a statement about the passport controls in the berwick region .
in the meantime , the commission &apos;s strathclyde proposal refers to the potential economic benefits that more travel freedom could bring in the rest of europe .
the commission has not mentioned that the european union &apos;s member states are often in breach of their strict rules , when it comes to making it cheaper for them .
as scotland is a member of the schengen area at present , it would be premature to continue to ignore brussels .
so in fact no story .
and a , the one that has been so in the years that you have already given a fossil : the first time i have seen the “ independence means passport controls ” duck at least 40 years ago .
the issue is one of interest in the constant repetition of this ancient history .
why should we talk about an independent scotland ?
why is the london summit of the 1930 ’ s against the europe of brussels , especially now ?
the first is the real european news .
with the eurocrisis , the project for europe has officially died .
everywhere in the eu , parties are gaining ground , eu enemies are being attacked or the euro is being thrown overboard as a single currency .
even in germany , the eurosceptic party could find alternative for germany – only this year – barely five million votes in the federal elections .
it was already a hot spot for the european union to launch a federalist project .
the current economic crisis is , however , a turning point .
because of the berlin and the european central bank &apos;s sanctions , the ecb has been forced to make a very strict austerity policy , in conjunction with the straitjacket in which the national economy is forced to bury its single currency .
the crisis in the euro has little to do with the fact that national governments have imposed excessive budget deficits – that was only the case in greece .
instead , the eurosystem has reduced its members to exchange rates , and the ecb has been responsible for german exporters .
without the possibility of a depreciation of the local currency , southern europe will find itself with a built-in productivity disadvantage over germany .
the only way to do this is to pay wages and public spending , which is stimulated by berlin .
behind the current etat- and monetary problems , the european central bank is deeply entrenched in productivity problems .
as a result of the decisions taken by brussels , the ‘ green ’ energy lines – a code for the subsidising of french producers and german energy companies on the expense of consumers – the european industry is paying a very high price compared with the united states .
the first step is to make the system work more efficiently .
all wage restraints on the world protect the european petrochemical industry not from being hit by cheap american petrol .
as a result , a revolt is dragging on , especially in france , the former chief executive of the eu .
after the war , the political elite saw france as a threat to the eu .
but berlin needs paris not only to be a gateway to political legitimacy , and europe has put its own economic policy on the map , which is a contagious french economy .
the result : marine le pen &apos;s legal personality is a european enemy .
the front national is now the most popular party in france with 24 % of the electorate – a timely warning that the french government is not prepared to accept the new constitution .
what makes le pen a unique brand of popular music ?
you want to strengthen the eu elections next year to make a fight against the eu , anti-community monetary bloc in the european parliament .
if the anti-eu parties are not present in these elections , as they are , and this is very well possible , then a new block of this kind could dominate the european parliament for the first time .
this is the point that i would like to make : in not too distant future , the growing resentment of the eu and the common currency will become a source of the abolition of the euro .
the eu will not disappear if it does not have the same kind of ‘ europe of the ( sovereign ) nations ’ .
germany and a few of its satellite economies are perhaps the most stable in the euro , but france and southern europe are becoming their own currencies .
i expect the commission to take a stand on this project , in the hope that it will be able to get involved with the united states .
however , washington is now setting a new standard for the pacific , with the us and japan alone having a two-tier system .
where is scotland ?
we cannot decide whether to build a region of ( in the final consequence ) small england .
or we can use our own economic interests – for which we also have to defend berlin and brussels , what they are doing where they are .
i suspect that scotland will be able to do so in a more lockable european union , provided that we have our own currency .
the cooperation with other , similar thinking groups is essential in a non-federal europe .
otherwise , we should consider whether it is norway &apos;s equal to the others and our economic independence .
the snp government in scotland has been very active – remarkable for its efforts – in the area of political freedom , security and justice .
it would be a great pleasure for scotland to have a say in the independence of the country now , only to be able to make a policy of austerity imposed on the countries of berlin and brussels .
early childhood puberness : faster growth is achieved by increasing the number of young people who are able to grow faster .
afroamerican and hispanish girls reach tenaciously higher levels of puberty than their white age cooperatives , as studies show .
physical and mental changes are not yet directly the pubercy of the body .
it is not a sign that the european union is not prepared to take any action to prevent hormones or other chemicals .
experts believe that the epidemic fat glucose is a trigger for diabetes disease early in the year .
the trend towards the early purification is less pronounced in young children , but more in young adults .
the former commission cnn correspondent , who was a member of the cnn , is a journalist who has been working on child health and family issues .
if a mother is worried when her daughter is already in the age of seven or eight , she will be able to breathe and shamhairs ?
in the annual conference of the nursery association of the american academy of sciences in washington , dc , the european commission adopted a resolution on the situation in the middle east .
“ i spent a lot of time on the idea of reassuring parents – usually this is not a sign that the children are now quickly getting up to the puzzle , ” explains kaplowitz .
revelation of the development , as for example growing brothers , damage to the shame and the undercarriage , and body smell , are seen earlier in girls .
nevertheless , there were only a slight shift in the age of the menarche ( occurrence of the first regular bleeding ) over the last 40 years .
in the united states , the average age of the population is 12,5 years , a little less than 12.75 in 1970 .
“ if the development of the breasts begins , it takes at least two to three years to get to the menarche ” , says kaplowitz , author of the book “ early puberty among girls : the essential advice .
time is the exact moment .
it is controversial that the european union should have started to put its pubercy in place , but it is important to be “ early ” if the breast enlargement is to be accompanied by growth slump before an age of eight .
in the majority of cases , the number of cases is slowing or stagnating – something that a child doctor can monitor closely .
in the case of rapid progress , we could have tests carried out by a endicrous ologist , so that serious problems such as tumors or cysts can be avoided .
it is a treatment method for delaying a early menstruation and for the scaling of another sequence : the early menstruation of bone .
the recommendations for a medication solution are not yet in force .
psychotherapy , psychological aspects are also important .
kaplowitz is reluctant about medication , but he acknowledges that the “ risk of suppression of the puberty can cause behavioral problems and the feelings of girls , unlike their age comrades . ”
the other major problem is understandable : parents simply do not want their very young daughters to have the period .
“ you are worried about the pregnancy risk , or about the way you treat the hygiene issue .
“ it was a shock , ” recalls a woman who was killed by a ten year-old daughter .
the fact that there are initial signs and we are talking about menstruation is a sign of emotional unprepared .
you came to fear and to be afraid .
it is a very good idea to have a good idea of the causes of early puberty .
but it is not clear whether the eu is capable of providing a sufficient level of protection for hormones in milk or other foods , chemicals in the environment or sexual messages .
young people are coming to the european union in the same way as girls .
kaplowitz is the view that the most convincing premise is the epidemic of fat leukaemia .
he supported the idea of a study in 2008 , which included girls aged between six and nine , and was able to establish a link between body fat and the entry into puberty .
other studies support this conclusion .
in this country , afroamerican and hispanish girls tend to reach the puberty rather than their white age cooperatives .
it is clear that there are different explanations .
global appears to be an early puberty of all possible things .
a further mystery is that , although young people are not aware of the face and shampoo hair , the trend is to increase the total number of earlier pubercy .
other doctors have been on the aap conference to stress the complexity of the problem .
the rise of new acne and shamhaar is even possible with babies and small children .
“ we need to be careful , as we can see the real beginning of puberity , ” he said .
parents should not hesitate to use the internet to get away from their children , as they have done with their child .
“ the only way to do this is to start a conversation earlier than expected , ” says kaplowitz .
if you are calm , the house reacts well .
girls who are early injured are no longer required to have the insurance that the process requires a normal part of life , even if they were previously thought to be part of it .
jumbo-manufacturer strikes in the face of big orders over seats width and height .
between leading aircraft manufacturers and the market , it is becoming a dispute about the broad range of seats in the tourist class at long-haul flights .
the dispute over the rules of procedure is about the width of the seat , the passengers are not allowed to travel long flights in the tourist class – not always those who are concerned with the airlines most , but this balancing act is a political key .
airbus is demanding a reduction in the size of its fleet this week , and it is expected that it will have a seating width of at least 46 cm ( 18 inches ) in the tourist class , but the us arch-american archery says it should do .
the debate on the subject is coming at a time when the aircraft builders are betting on whether to make even larger versions of their two-engine long-haul aircraft .
as the rear part of the aircraft is designed , the aircraft is designed to be a series of nine or ten seats , and is crucial for the specified economic results , which the new “ minima ” system can deliver .
boeing 747 was the first to launch a new boeing 777x boeing 77x boeing 77x boeing 76. it was the first to be equipped with a new generation of 7777777x .
airbus is committed to maintaining the competitive position of the a350 , which is 350 people in 18 seats .
aircraft manufacturers and suppliers are now sharing heat with the world ’ s largest aircraft manufacturers .
now i appeal to airbus to the dubai airbus show to take the 777x with over 100 orders .
recently , the company introduced an ad that was the beginning of a new ad war .
“ boeing ” is a long-haul flight in seats that is closer to the regional turbo-props ” , says airbus president and ceo tom enders .
given the changing nature of food , the food prices will be more thick , but aircraft seats will have more radical effects .
between the early 1970s and the early 1970s , when boeing 747 was the modern long-haul voyage , and the end of the century , the weight of the male average man has increased from 40 to 49 years .
the taiwanese manufacturer &apos;s waistcoat size is about 20 cm in the 21st century , according to us health statistics .
airbus is telling us that its rival is in line with a seating concept of the 1950s , when the average body size of the newly traded aircraft was “ jet set ” .
it was , i said , airbus that carried out investigations that showed that the aircraft had an additional customs duty ( 2.54 cm ) per seat .
boeing 747 is a new generation of its airbus fleet , with a total of 240 aircraft being sold in the united states .
the company declares that it is also aware of the experience on the aircraft from more than the seating width .
“ it runs really well to make flight bookings more flexible , so that they can do what they want to do .
you want to be able to use disclosures that you can make profitable .
you know your business better than any other .
for airlines , the issue is more elbow shells , but for manufacturers it will increasingly be a problem for the airlines .
behind the confrontation is a race for aircraft engines , with a estimated 2,000 tons of aircraft .
as reuters announced in july , the us government is now in a position to increase the number of seats available in the us .
both airbus and the eurocopter have claimed 20 percent more efficiency per seat than in its latest two-engine aircraft .
the statements offered by boeing on the results are partly dependent on the fact that the 777x is sitting in the same row with its original design of nine seats in the 777 .
the gestures of the cost per unit are still lower than the current machines with ten seats per row .
“ boeing ” is a very popular product , and the company is also a major player in the global aerospace industry .
on the other hand , analysts say that full cabins with ten seats per row can be used with 777s indicated that many passengers would be interested in closer alignment , which would be possible with cheaper air fares .
“ axis of the zoll seating width would be great for passengers , but the reality is : from a commercial point of view , the airbus a320 offer is very different from the threat posed by the 777 . ” , says mary mary .
airbus is a major player in the global market .
the world order of jet-verkaufsproduktion is even making itself a beacon in order to measure the equipment at the competition .
even if you have the comfort to pay , we offer all manufacturers the same jets with high compression coating .
airbus is offering a a350 with ten seats , which will be delivered in the near future , according to its own statement .
until recently , the airbus has stressed that the european union must be more adaptable to the needs of some jets and that it must have broad seats on its corners .
without the support of the only other manufacturer of large modern jet , experts say that the reputation for a new brand name is probably a puppy that will be purged , but from the wave of 777x sales .
new anti-nitrogen oxide vaccine could help the pleasure of smoking to keep the skin smoke .
scientists have a anti-nitrogen test that is based on the latest scientific findings .
a single domain is a dose of vaccine that could cause mice to be used for life .
before testing on humans , many other tests are needed , which may take some years to come , but professor ronald crystal of the wheat cornell medical college is in new york .
“ we are very hopeful that the next generation of this kind of vaccine strategy will be able to help millions of smokers who have tried to stop smoking while keeping all the methods available on the market .
the new import ban on vaccines contains a harmless virus that is modified to prevent the spread of genetically modified information .
the virus infected the system selectively , but it does not have a permanent stream of infections .
the antics of the jacket hunt the nicotine molecules in the blood and neutralize the nervous system before they reach the brain .
in attempts to do so , vaccinated mice had been kept in place to prevent the spread of their normal activities .
mice , without vaccination , would have a “ break out ” that would have explained the researchers who had a sign that the disease was not caused by the nicotine .
the experiments are in the facsimile science translational medicine ( fachblatt ) .
previous versions of tobacco vaccines suggested that there was no risk of infection with antibodies .
the import of vaccines had to be carried out in order to maintain the antibody peel .
but the cost of the new vaccine is not likely to be much lower , because it transforms liver cells into antibodies .
as professor herman said , the european union could be a future immune to human beings if it is safe .
more likely , however , is that smokers will use it to stop smoking .
“ you know then : if you are going to start smoking again , you feel the pain of smoking because of the nicotine vaccine .
british scientists said that the results were interesting , but warned at the same time that there was still a need for further research .
tripodi is denying that it is not a matter of influence on the part of obeid , but of the fact that it has been influenced by obeid .
the commission has not yet been able to take any action against the former minister of labour party joe tripodi from new south wales .
the former nsw minister , however , denies that the rules on maritime surveillance have been extended to cover maritime shipping at the request of his political mentor eddie obeid , who has been involved in three main sites at state-controlled level .
the indemnity of the commission is a member of the european parliament .
now , because of the accusation that the tripodi has been abducted by obeid &apos;s hidden interest in the property , the tripodi is now being investigated .
in years of experience , i have had a lot of discussions in 2005 , the government has responded to calls for tender for tender contracts .
the passports were , however , opposed and wanted to be longer .
in 2009 , the lease contracts for the companies at the circular quay , which were awarded the above mentioned 2.5 million dollars a year , were suspended without any public tender .
tripodi , the most important european producer of high quality , has been awarded the title of &quot; best ship of the year &quot; by the ministry of the port from february 2006 to november 2009 .
but he would not be able to make changes at the request of obeid .
a key issue in icac is that the commission has been able to make a phone call from august to september 2007 between obeid , tripodi and steve dunn , a senior official who has been transferred to the port ministry .
“ was the same in these telephone conversations ?
“ no , ” he replied , “ tripodi .
i can only apologise for what was discussed , but that was what was definitely not .
definitively not between me and mr obeid .
israeli leaders are now in a position to attack the goal in syria .
israeli leaders hunting aircraft would have been allowed to leave on thursday night in the syrian port of lacakia , but confirmed a leading government official to fox news .
the official of the commission explained not that it was intended to be a member of the commission , but said that it was at least one .
according to associates press , the number of the press was about russian sa-125-racial rockets .
at least twice a year , israel has already made air strikes on missile supplies in syria .
foreign workers with 45.7 visa are likely to be “ real ” testing .
the government is thinking about extending the scope of a “ real ” fund to cover all the foreign workers with 457-visas .
if the test is to be introduced , it would have a criterion for using the same criteria , which would prevent the 457 being used to occupy unqualified jobs or as a backdoor for the influx of family and friends to australia .
today , a discussion forum was held in which the government had announced that the former labour government member , mr maxiine mckenev , had taken note of the government &apos;s comments on foreign workers because they were not accepted by australians .
“ loudly declarations like that , foreigners should be able to stand up at the back ” and , if australians are to stop at the front , a very unpleasant retreat in times when trade unions demanded a protected labour market ” .
historically , historians have said that white workers are protected , and that is when some in the region have a reaction to this historic artefact , they are not .
the draft discussion is about the future of the european union and about the future of europe .
immigrants are not burdan o &apos;connor , who is here yesterday for talks on trafficking in human beings in sri lanka , but the european union has five of the proposed amendments , which other people will have to consider .
if the “ etwinning criterion ” is taken over , then someone who has a visa could be able to apply for it to see whether the “ real ” application is in the case where the visa is issued .
companies could also be obliged to provide an account of the number of 457-visas holders who have been issued in the past , when companies that initially had only a small number of workers were forced to give their support .
meanwhile , the us president , a 35-year-old sri lankan asylum lawyer , was presumably killed by a heart attack after he was killed this week by a floating refugee boat on christmas island .
the reference to the misplaced nine-year-old son of the man who had come to australia will have been in prison since his father died on wednesday of a child .

from the british government , a study has been announced that will assess the benefits of hs2 rail for scotland .
in the work of hs2 ltd . , it is proposed to start work on the new hs2 standard by 2026 .
traffic ministerial baroness kramer said that the project “ will bring great britain closer together ” .
the scottish transport minister , keith brown , stated that he was very pleased to be able to participate in this plan with the british government .
phase 1 consists of a new high-speed line , which is between london and the west midlands .

regulations on electronic equipment in aircraft and the rules on the electronic equipment remain in force in australia for the time being .
australian airlines fly to australia from the united states to australia , and must continue to use tablets and smartphones when the flight is started and landed , despite efforts in the us to relax the rules on such equipment .
the us government has been using the us air force ( faa ) to provide us airlines with their requirements .
during the great part of the flight , passage is not already allowed , but you will find it annoying that the passenger is allowed to travel on the start and landing .
australian companies are watching the decision to sell their products to us airlines .
the airlines are responsible for the safety of their passengers , as well as for the fact that they are going to look at the announcement , but they have stressed that restrictions on the use of electronic equipment in critical flight phases in australia are still valid .
“ the cafeteria has no specific regulations on the use of electronic equipment in the aircraft at the moment , ” said the president .
the issue of the subject is subject to rules that airlines must always maintain safety and that passengers must comply with the rules laid down by the cabin crew .
virgin has already started to use the casa conversations about extending its wi-fi network to include the internet .
“ we would like to see a review of the authorisation of electronic devices by casa , because we are convinced that the latter is the customer ’ s experience , after we have now ( wireless ) been able to access the data during the flight . ” said .
qantas explained that it will be possible to stay in the current rules until further notice .
“ our current policies provide for the commission to use electronic devices when the start and landing are not used , and we currently have no plans to do so . ” he stated .
the facts of the faa are valid for us airlines .
we are , however , always interested in developments in regulations that affect passengers .
the decision has a negative impact on us companies depending on the age of the fleet .
you must verify that you have been able to detect the wireless interference from mobile devices and that you have received manuals , training materials , hand luggage programmes and customer instruction .
“ after a flight company has reduced tolerance of its fleet , we can now offer passengers a free use of portable , electronic and electronic equipment such as tablets , e-books and other devices .
in rare cases , the patient may be treated with a diet of the same size as the passenger is landed .
the group recommends that the commission should be able to detect more heavy equipment at the start and landing safely under the seat or in the subjects over the seats .

borussia doruchtmund announced that he will be using hard disk partitions .
before the free day game , the football world cup was played against the vfb stuttgart in germany .
it was a disorderly and almost already pouring acoustics that were in the eye of the viewer until the moment of the arrival of the bundesliga game between the german vice champion borussia dortmund and the german chancellor stuttgart .
the commission and the council have been largely to be heard by visitors .
the south tribune , on the other hand , where the faithful and laureates are bvb fans , presented the most important and most popular bvb fans : no singers , no battlegrounds .
the podest of the capo , who otherwise would have the common moisture , remained unsettled .
and , most importantly , on the gallery , we are still seeing a number of flags of appreciation , &quot; sektion stadium ban &quot; .
only as a goalkeeper roman weidenfeller as always the first bvb player to look at the place , short jubilee burst .
as his team was in the team , there were loudly vocal vocals and whining sound - but long ago not everywhere .
in the central blocks of the 12 and 13 of the south grandstand , the main hall was nothing .
the fact that stadium speakers norbert dikkel still have the positive experiences of the last few days - derbytrig , victory over arsenal , extension of the contract by trainer jürgen klopp .
only five minutes before the start of the anpfiff the capo was able to open his podium - and the so far straight with hands - and the other two were finally invited to the concert .
as a final point , as always , the southern gallery was on the line - and finally there was again as usual the lautest place in the stadium .
and , at the latest , when the first german company was founded with anpfiff from the south tribune , the loudly calling &quot; derbysieger &quot; was on the road again .
the silence of the past was probably a reaction to the events of the past few days .
immediately before the fourteenth century revierderby at the fc schalke 04 some of the fans of bvb had a luminous rocket in the spectators and placed on the ground - and almost torrent .
the game was designed for the chaotic scenes of the late 1980s .
bvb-boss hans-joachim wagrain is a member of the group of the dortmunder ultras .
&quot; it will be a great pleasure for the entire ultrasound movement &quot; , embed the title of the bvb boss on thursday evening at a podium ceremony in frankfurt .

&quot; the first time i was a member of the european parliament , &quot; he said .
the numbers of the member states of the european union on pyrotechnics cannot be abandoned .
moreover , the ultras have been given various ways of punishing - up to tuesday , these have now taken time to apply for one .
otherwise , the european union will not be able to take the bvb into consideration by the end of next week .
&quot; the first time i had to go to the university of munich , i was told .
it is important to look forward to the way in which the reactions on the southern gallery will then be disappearing .
pfandhouses boom in singapore , as the crisis in the middle class has come .

although they are paid $ 3,000 every month , they are not even able to earn $ 1,730 as a management officer .
indeed , the demand in parts of south-east asia – where the desperate debt of households has increased – has been so large that valencia has been able to meet its exchange .
the failure to pledge funds for jewelry is not only a quick way to save money – 1.300 pieces of singapore dollars in the case of janani amirthalinga – but also a fast one .
typical use of the pfandbrief banks in singapore is to demand an effective annual rate of 17 % , which is just above the 15.4 % that unites the united overseas bank .
pfandhouses offer the advantage of being able to check the credit rating of the investment funds or the income evidence , which is why loans are needed more quickly than banks .
for this reason , the millions of people in the region are turning to pfandhouses , having families been pushing the pressure of rising living costs and increasing household and consumer debt .
after five years of robust and stable growth since the global financial crisis and cheap loans from a loose financial policy in the developed economies , we are looking for families with lower and middle income pfandhouses to help them survive in stottering .

historical peak of the great gold prices in the last two years has increased the trend towards the food supply of personal goods .
in singapore , about 70 % of the food supplied is not included in the 200 pfandhouses of the city state .
the people say they are “ the gold price is good , but let us not be grandmother ’ s gold chain . ”
the biggest thai state , the pfandhaus-operator , easymoney , has already established a 20-percent interest customer grant in its branches in the last few months .
the growth in the pfandbrief business is so strong that valuemax , the operator of the branch in bendemeer and 15 other subsidiaries in singapore , is not only able to expand into neighbouring malaysia – where it is concerned .
the company is financing the company with 60 percent of the 66 million singapore dollars , which it has been able to finance this week with the singapore stock exchange .
during some credit institutions because of high interest rates , the government has been pushed into the crossfire , yeah declares that pfandhouses are not only cheaper interest than other lenders , but that they are not directly increasing debt .
“ customers are borrowing items that they already have and that are liquidated personal items that they have already purchased .
the pfandbrief business is being socially increasingly regarded as short-term , secure and sustainable financing .
the commission is not responsible for the fact that not all people using pfandbrief banks are in financial difficulties .

rettling packages
the australian government insists on the hard conditions that the country is facing with the bailout of over 325 million australian dollars for the tasmanian health system .
chancellor schüssel tanya plibersek announced that the commodity market will be closed “ unrestrained ” .
the funding for a period of four years has been increased after consultations with the independent tasmanian member , andrew wilkie .
“ the government has a central emergency rescue system , ” says the government .
the 325-million-dollar bill of exchange is about 31 million dollars , and the us $ 350 million in emergency aid is about to be provided .
by further 2600 operations , the complete orthopaedic operations and treatment , due to grey star , the residues are to be eliminated .
in addition , there is money for daily clinics in hobart and launceston .
“ this investment corresponds to the ideas that i have been informed about by the patients .
the ministerial insisted on a strict reporting and reporting obligation .
the federal state should be able to finance the current level of funding to finance the commonwealth .
a three-person delegation from the commission will be set up and will ensure that the federal state provides health services as effectively and efficiently as possible .
as wilkie said today , the us $ 325 million would be little use if the “ they are not driven by real reforms , which will boost public tasmanian health . ”
nevertheless , the european parliament has praised the government for having responded to its request for urgent aid , which it initially sent to the prime minister at the beginning of may .
“ i am confident that the new generation of german aid will make a major contribution to improving public health systems in the federal state from the point of view of concern , ” said wilkie .
according to the government of the state , these ballot payments are largely financed by the cuts that have been made recently .
but the health aspect of the report ’ s opposition spokesman , peter dutton , is the view that the current announcement by the government is only a “ pfl solution . ”
“ we are therefore able to offer a wide range of services , because the laboratory government has invested $ 430 million in health care . ” , said he said to abc tv .
it can not be the case that a government is almost half a billion people in need of a system that is not in place and the commonwealth has invested 300 million and then has to do as if it were good news .
dutton called on plibersek to make sure that the non-aligned countries would not be a single dollar of the bailout package .

syrian has the opportunity to produce chemical weapons , but it is a monitoring exercise .
syrian has important facilities for the production of chemical weapons and gitft-gas ammunition , declared the global monitoring group on chemical weapons at its meeting on thursday , while it is in the north of the country becoming severe clashes near a nuclear accident .
the hotel is also announced on thursday that a syrian group of activists announced that more than 120,000 people have died since the civil war began three years ago .
the announcement of the organization for the banning of chemical weapons ( opcw ) came a day before the date on 1 january .
1. november , the first day of the conference of the parties to the hague , the damascus , was set up to provide all the facilities for the manufacture of chemical weapons or to prevent &quot; inoperative &quot; , including all the machinery for the mixing of fti chemicals .
the conclusion of this process , which is essentially a matter of the first stage of destruction , is an important milestone in an ambitious era of the timescale that aims to destroy all chemical weapons .
the destruction of the facilities means that syria is not new chemical weapons .
damascus , however , still needs to begin to use the existing weapons and supplies to destroy them .
anecdotal assumptions are that there are about 1,000 tonnes of chemicals and weapons in the country , including senfgas and nervous sarin .
the announcement of the release came at a time when the fight was being fought in the city of safira , from which experts say that there was a production facility for chemical weapons .
the activist group , which has a network of activists in syria , has reduced the number of deaths , declared on thursday , 120.296 people were dead .
this is expected to be 61.067 civilians , including 6,365 children .
on the part of the government , 29.954 of them were members of the army of president bashar assad , 18,678 were government-friendly fighters and 187 lebanese hezbollah militias .
the commission also has a number of worries about the future of the military , including the fact that the military has been forced to close down the country .
on 25 july , the us estimated the number of deaths in the country , from march 2011 , to 100,000 .
this figure was not even updated .
the conflict has caused about two million people to flee the country .
assads ’ troops have been fighting for weeks in safira against the rebels , many of which have links with al-qaeda groups .
the observation mission is said to be having a very serious losses on both sides on thursday , but no details were mentioned .
the fighting has underlined the danger of the chemical industry becoming a source of conflict , because its mission to liberate syria is a very important one .
after the commission &apos;s statement on the oecd , which is closely cooperating with the united nations , the team “ now convinced that it will all be able to achieve the important production and mixing facilities mentioned by syria and to destroy them . ”
that is why “ no further inspections are currently planned ” .
in the beginning of the week , the inspectors stated that they had signed the first round of checks and that 21 out of 23 of the inspectors were visiting damascus .
because of security concerns , the visit of two institutions is not possible , the inspectors said .
on thursday , the opposition declared that the two sites had been closed down according to syrian saying , “ and the sites there were of the chemical weapons program . ”
it was not immediately clear what the commission &apos;s place was in safira , one of the two institutions that had the opcw inspectors .
syrian society has developed a plan for the complete destruction of its chemical weapons , which will be approved by the executive committee of the opwc next month .
“ i quote : “ i prefer the hat before the bravery and courage to the courage that you all have shown in fulfilling the most challenging mission ever undertaken by this organisation .
since now three years , the mainly sunni and muslim communities have been fighting in this civil war against assad ’ s government and its security forces , the many members of the alawites .
in view of further developments , the head of the observatory said that rami abdurrahman , there was a meeting on wednesday in which he exploded in an air defence facility in the syrian coastal province of lagakia .
the cause of the explosion is not known , he explained .

he fell in love with the american army one month after the attack and “ died ” .
hughes said that patek had the same fate as the three other members of the terrorist cell jemaah islamiah – amrozi , mukhelas , and imam samudra – who were .
really , this type should be used above all else .
to get to know him – no , it is not a reason to leave him alive .
20 years to get , after he was 202 people killed , and many hundreds of injured , is not much .
patek is the last of the bali bomber , who has been brought to justice .
he was expelled almost a decade ago from the arrest , but was eventually released in january 2011 in pakistan ’ s city of abbottabad .
during the negotiation of this agreement , a fbi agent from the usa said that secret service reports had made it clear that the pactek had been in pakistan to get bin laden to meet with the aim of strengthening the link between south-east asian groups .
“ he has been unable to stand up , ” said corteen .
until recently , the company had no repentance for the amount of suffering it inflicted on other people .
the judgment was passed before the tenth anniversary of the attack on the united states this year , which was accompanied by commemorative celebrations in bali and australia .
“ it will be a lot of tears this year , ” said corteen .
patek can be used against his verdict .
faa : airport passengers can now use electronic devices in aircraft .
fluctuates in the range of 30 to 60 km .
but we should not allow passengers to expect that they will be implemented immediately .
as soon as you implement it , you will be left to the airline concerned , mr faa said , michael huerta , at a press conference .
the airlines are obliged to comply with the faa , that aircraft comply with the new directives and that they comply with the training manuals of the flight personnel and the rules for the dusting of equipment in accordance with the new rules .
the facts of the faa stated that it has already received plans from some airlines that are proposing to use sustainable electronic equipment in aircraft .
under these airlines , the airlines were also delta and jetblue .
“ the number of participants is limited , depending on the state of the plan .
at present , passengers must be able to use smart phones , tablets and other devices to switch off when the aircraft doors are closed .
you may not use them again until you have the aircraft in your hand at a height of three kilometres and the captain has been given the green light .
the entrance to the national park is free of charge for passengers .
after the new directives , airlines could be allowed to fly in the event of electronic disruptions .
the majority of new transport aircraft and other aircraft are now in service with a cost of up to eur 1 million .
laura glading , president of the association of professional photographers , is a member of the international association of professional aviation companies. he welcomed the changes .
“ if the new regulation is implemented safely – and we are working closely with the airline in this respect – both sides will benefit from it , ” commented glading .
we are the honest ones who are tired of being divided on this issue .
nevertheless , the internet connections to the internet remained unchanged , the exchange of e-mails , text messages or the downloading of data under three kilometres continued , explained the authority .
passengers who are required to use smart phones or smartphones , tablets and other devices in flight mode .
so always have no “ word ” with friends .
and , more difficult devices such as laptops must continue to be dusty , as there is a vulnerability here , if they are caused by the cabin .
handyswap calls are free of charge .
the regulators &apos; competence in telephone calls is the federal government .
faa heats the risk of a ban on certain electronic devices when the vehicle is started and landed .
last month , mark rosenker of the transport safety agency said that he was going to be a safety board , safety experts for national transport .
“ handy are really a problem , not only because they are potentially dangerous , but also because they are not really a problem for mobile phones .
a consulting firm with a view to the future of the company is the first step towards the study of this issue .
in the last few years , the pressure on the facts of the faa has increased , restrictions on the use of force have been lowered .
critics like the democratic senate party , claire mccake , have been accused of being a &quot; non-state &quot; .
the restrictions on the use of the internet are becoming increasingly difficult to implement , because the use of equipment has become a reality .
in some studies , it is said that the european union has a population of up to one third of passengers who are poisoning or ignoring the equipment .
the facts of the faa were published in 1966 , and the number of people who were travelling by air has been reported to have been reported to the faa on the interference of navigation and communication equipment .
new aircraft are much more dependent on the electric and electronic systems than previous generations of air vehicles , but they are also so constructive that they are dependent on the faa to be able to offer electronic interference .
airport airlines offer passengers a choice of services for a number of years , such as wi-fi , when the flight height is reached .
the countries that have joined wi-fi systems are now able to operate in a variety of ways , including the interferons .
the overwhelming majority of the passengers in the aircraft should be responsible for the greater use of electronic equipment under the new directives , said huerta .
the current electronic devices give in general much less radio radiance than the previous ones .
e-reader is a tool that allows you to easily create and edit your own documents .
but the download or send of data is not the transmission values .
the hotel is also a great place for those who advocate a relaxation of restrictions on device use by passengers .
2011 , the company ’ s employees invited a passenger aircraft full of kindle e-readers and made a test flight to test the problems that could be detected , but were unable to find out .
members of the faa advisory committee are responsible for the information and consultation on the issue of the safety of the workers .
douglas kidd from the passenger association national association of air transport ( nabucco ) said he was the only person who felt that the disruption was real , even if the risk was minimal .
other cosmic comics said that there was no more than a few reports from pilotes , which were designed to prevent the aircraft from being damaged by the equipment .
the committee is responsible for the implementation of the faa , however , and recommends that pilots be allowed to take part in the event of an instrument landing under bad visibility .
a group of people from the travel industry welcomed the changes and remarked them as a reasonable adaptation to travellers , who are now more familiar with technology .
“ we are pleased to have the faa recognizes that a pleasant passenger transport experience is not in contradiction to safety , ” said roger dow , ceo of the u.s. travel agency .

is europe ’ s elite prepared to negotiate with britain ?
business for british airways was founded in april with the intention to develop the economy to a table .
the following amendments have been tabled to this effect , and we have the largest and most comprehensive survey among british economists and asked them what they think of britain , the economy and the eu .
youfon is a free software application that allows you to create and manage your own projects .
the results of the survey will show many surprises .
we have found that the commission has not yet taken the view that the vast majority of companies are exporting outside europe and are concentrated on countries that are modernising and growing , while the states in the eu are stagnating .
you want to see the commission &apos;s leaders take on new trade links with countries like china , india and brazil .
what is required in your view of certain legally regulated issues – from the cartel law to the product legislation – is the majority of economic leaders of the opinion that control of these key competences should be transferred to westminster .
it was clear that the commission was not prepared to accept the proposal for a directive on the internal market because companies said that the costs of the rules in brussels would now outweigh the benefits .
finally , and this is probably the most important thing to say , our survey of economic leaders gave a clear indication that a clear majority was opposed by the united kingdom to a change in the agreement and a relationship with the eu based on trade .
this is a recognition that has been widely shared by companies of all sizes and by all major groups that the economy is moving towards a “ sensible change . ”
it is about much – a change in the agreement and better conditions for britain in terms of 16 % – to change their mind in favour of staying in the eu in a referendum .
the prime minister should be in no doubt : this survey shows that the british economy is lagging behind his plan for the new british conditions for eu membership .
you can also see that the companies are affected by a renegotiation .
a better way to deal with the british economy is to make it possible and increasingly necessary to do so after the eurozone has moved towards closer integration of the economy and the fiscal union .
the priority must be jobs and growth in britain , as the result of our survey shows , what is good for businesses and what is good for the economy .

he was sentenced to at least six years in prison .
harry stone is also a great place to start the ymca .
the staff said from the outset that they had observed violations , including the fact that lord alone had to deal with children , they were privately treated as babysitters , they were on his shoot , and they said that he was .
in the following years danielle ockwell , whose head lord was and was around a school , was a member of the united states &apos; association for the protection of children , because she was concerned about his behaviour .
the division ’ s managing director stated that he would not accept statements from employees that would not be dared to change their management report .
instead , it said , the commission has its friendship with lord their greatness .
harry explained that he has given the board of directors of the ymca nsw his opinion that the leverage that is the organization &apos;s primary goal is to create a new business model .
harry said that the decision to make employees pay to sign contracts is a decision that is not taken soon after the accusations have been made .
he said that it should be used to prevent contamination of the evidence , which is ‘ excessive ’ .
the ymca nsw is available in the time when jong-athan lord was elected to the parliament between 2009 and 2011 .
he explained the reasons why the commission is dealing with “ serious problems ” in the recruitment , review , inspect , training and supervision of staff .
the hearing of the committee was held until 20 december .
tony blair explained that he would not miss the chance of a return as a british prime minister – but acknowledges that a cool head could be unlikely .
in a interview with the president of the commission on the occasion of the fifth anniversary of his departure from office this evening , the 59-year-old announced his views on various domestic issues .
since its resignation in june 2007 after a decade as a head of state , blair has largely avoided the focus of british politics .
on the question of whether he likes to be in the post of prime minister , i was asked by the evening standard .
as the world began to look back on the past few years , the experts from the horse show in cardiff found that the horse was not as good as the horse .
but none was on the three years old fenton kirkland .
the sound of the pendulum , which is not even in the kindergarten and only a few months ago , and his shetland plan , is now in the process of being hit loose by the three rounds and holten .
the unbroken sea of the mediterranean sea , both large and small , were called the &quot; golden lake &quot; because of their appearance , behavior and style .
in his performance in competition with the men and women with elegant melodies , he had his leghold in the same girlfriend .
fenton was played by the jurors for his natural abilities in dealing with the pony .
and toffee received bestmarks for his appearance and his personality .
fenton had dead and buried in the streets of the city last march as a gift to his third birthday and since then he has been working with the shetland pony every day .
his mother , donna , 30 , said : “ fenton and toffee are a great example of excitement . ”
you had to fight against the whole field of the participant and have been awarded gold cup and rosette .
it was only the second time that the council had been confronted with toffee in a competition , and we were all delighted that the competition was won .
it is completely alien in the arena to think it is so phenomenal that it is with him photographed .
the small boy from the village nantyglo in the vicinity of ebbw vale , sosouth wales , follows in the footsteps of his dancing sharon howell &apos;s , who has been living in the area for more than ten years .
howells is a story about the “ the whole audience was like electricised and everyone started to put it on fire and put it in place . ”
he loves to play sand the whole length of the arena and although he is so tiny , he is not afraid to play with the other players .
fenton is verrückt after animals – he loves horses , tractors and farms .
for example , as it started , the system will not take long before it is installed on the “ horse of the year ” show – and i am sure that it will be well picked up .
a spokesman for the annual horse show said : “ fenton is only three , but he knows how to deal with his pony .
together , they are a great team .
the jury members of the jury evaluated fenton and toffee as good as they could have beaten and beaten in the presentation ring .
you respect the good cooperation between pony and leader – and here we were the fenton and toffee in the ring .
i am sure that the commission will be able to use the sweet clothes to help us to make the most of the matching event .
chinese newspaper is to be asked for “ reformed ” after calling .
a chinese newspaper , which has been published on the front page of the report , has said that it is not going to be allowed to be released .
the report adopted in guangzhou is a step in the right direction .
but chen has later announced on television that he will be bribes , and that he will be reporting a partial government company .
now i will be using the new express of a “ comprehensive response ” .
the “ rektification planner ” shall be issued by the food and drug administration .
the preliminary results of investigations are to be carried out by the new express , which is part of the yangcheng eving news group , between september 2012 and august 2013 , several inaccurate reports of the stock market ’ s companies .
“ the red-tape management of the new express was unorganized , ” said the regulators of the new express in a statement .
you said that you had decided to ‘ create an administrative penalty for chen yongqing ’ .
in addition , the “ yangheng evening news group ” was instructed to undertake a complete retrospective of the new express and recommended that the relevant persons be informed of the new express and immediately notify the management team of the new .
chen had several articles for the new express , but in which he talked about alleged financial irregularities in a manufacturer of construction machinery called zoomllion .
after having been arrested , he was released from prison .
but then the chen lama appeared on state television , and gave that he was bailed out false reports on pay .
“ in this case i have zoomllion estimated that it was too much damage to the media as a whole and their ability to win public confidence ” , he explained to the state intelligence service .
i have already said it before me , because i have referred to money and glory .
i am aware that the commission is wrong .
in the aftermath of chen ’ s apology , the new express issued an apology on the title page , explaining that it was not possible to read the reports correctly .
various known vulnerabilities have been discovered in recent times in the internet .
experts say that the gestures of confession are still routinely investigated .
drogen-unnel with its own railway between the usa and mexico discovered a new , undiscovered , undiscovered , and undiscovered , drygen-rogentunnel , in the united states and mexico .
one of the most sophisticated and modern tunnels for the drug smuggling between the us and mexico , which is completely covered with lighting , ventilation and electricity .
the us government has described the 120 times 90 centimetres of co2 / km tunnel as one of the most sophisticated passages that can be used to find .
the tunnel is a very good example of the way in which the two sides are connected .
in the area there are numerous restaurants , bars , cafes , bars , restaurants , bars , shops , etc .
the tunnel is a closed one , before drugs are undetected in it .
in the discovery of the tunnel , the two forty-one and a half tons of marijuana and 148 kilograms of cocaine were secured , thus the recordings of the court .
three men , who , according to the authorities , worked as drivers , were sentenced to death for the property and intended sale of marijuana and cocaine .
they are threatened with a debtor &apos;s sentence .
in nogales , arizona , we put smugglers on a vast network of underground vehicles .
the tunnel is a bridge between the eighth and the last one since 2006 in san diego .
some of the largest tunnels were built after the marihuana erhöhe harvest in central mexico in october , which made the drug cartels the challenge of how to quickly make their product to consumers .
in 2006 , the authorities had a population of almost 640 metres with rail and waterways , which were covered by a kitchen in a residential house in tijuana to two storehouses in san diego .
orlando bloom and miranda kerr love themselves even more .
check out the orlando bloom and model miranda kerr .
in a interview with the author , bloom said , however , that he and kerr still love each other .

kerr and he himself loved the idea of a new , more powerful , and more powerful , the 36-year-old .

the vegan lifestyle is , according to lexika , the vegetarianism , but it is different from that on a very large scale .
because , while vegetarians are committed to the consumption of sahnetorte , eis or a powerful herb , they are also facing a worse choice .
mild , cold and hot , cold and hot , but also cold , and the taste of the vegan is a delight for all the eating of animal products .
what remains is the fact that the european union is not yet ready to take a closer look at the situation .
&quot; brotaustriche &quot; are very popular &quot; , explains ute henkelmann , who is a owner of the local breed house , who has a variety of special products for vegan .
the reuben are also visiting the shop in the dockyard .
since 13 years , the gebr has lived in new zealand , in lamperetheim , he finds ( almost ) everything he needs to live . &quot; 1997 , i put my diet around and was vegetarians &quot; .
to instantly transform the turn of the century , the next step was taken and i was vegan .
&quot; the conviction came not only because of the diet , but because of the choice of shoes , &quot; says proctor , the plastic leather normal leather .
he recognized that the problem is also in other everyday situations .
in the first place , vegan is an ethics .
&quot; i want to not see animals being sold to me &quot; , says proctor &apos;s maxim of vegan , which is based on the entire consumption behavior .
instead of burgers , stirring eggs or rubber bubbles , they are now being sold to the vegan quickly .
&quot; it is a double success bonus &quot; , says proctor today , &quot; indeed , vegan does not make his waiver , no ascese , but it is a enrichment &quot; .
and that is precisely the condition that has been imposed on some people .
&quot; the suchtfactor is a very important factor , which many people can quickly abandon , similar to smoking &quot; , says proctor .
and turn a : &quot; certain failed &quot; creatures are not interested in the animal .
often , it is the spices or the kind of ingredients that are used to produce the flavour .
&quot; you can also use the other way to get the same effect &quot; , explains the author .
the hotel is situated in the heart of the city , near the famous champagne and the famous champagne market .
he respects the need for a balanced , varied and nutritious diet , which is also a discrete diet .
of course , there is a desire to have something between the teeth .
&quot; it should be tasteful , but the thing is not only on animal food .
health problems are still a problem , including eating disorders , further widespread assumption .
for me , the umbrella organisation was a positive aspect of the changeover .
i take no stranger cholera , but i have a higher risk of vitamin .
it is highly competitive , and it is not just a question of vegetarian food .
&quot; my blood values are beyond me , i leave them to be cheated &quot; , verrät proctor .
in particular , against the lack of vitamin b12 , many vegan simulation critics warn .
&quot; since animals are fed with feedingstuffs , we must not be afraid of the pasture , &quot; he asked .
for vegetarians , i have also seen the possibility of using the coenzyme in the form of tablets .
&quot; my lego b12 values are ok &quot; , explains dr. j. h. h. h. h. h. h. h. h. h. h. h. h. h. h. h. h. h.
wide paths should be taken by proctor to obtain food .
the main food is available in all parts of the world , and every supermarket has now grown to include soya milk and other products .
all that is missing is a simple , simple and intuitive interface .
only from time to time do i buy something special .
&quot; many people think that the only way to achieve this is to pay for the finished products , but that is the case with &quot; ordinary &quot; finished products .
in any case , the allocation of the vegetable proteins is far more favourable and less time-consuming than the common practice .
&quot; in the house kitchen there are lots to discover , with a few small cutlery you can enjoy good , if not some better , results &quot; says proftor .
margareine instead of butter , a little more baking powder and carbon acid instead of egg , with its vegan cheese cake , proctor could also have sold his sister parents to astonish .
family celebrations give the vegan a special atmosphere .
the result is dynamic , if you cook together , the boil has a new value .
&quot; the situations that we are creating are not necessarily so different from the people themselves &quot; , says proctor .
of course , he was already sceptical about the matter .
schmehl sie dir mein essen nicht meine essen ?
&quot; should i register now badly ?
&quot; i reject the idea of people not being able to do anything about it , &quot; i would like to say to mr proctor that there is no deadline for enactment .
and , more specifically , the daily world appears to be less vegetarian than the presumed – and the vegetarian is not as much in everyday life as common .
the city of alicante is also a popular destination for outdoor activities .
pommes is also a place where you can find everything you need !
&quot; many döner &apos;s shops offer false food and are not allowed to buy a vegetarian yufka , &quot; says proftor .
in a pizzling pizzeria , he is on pasta dishes , or orders a small pizza without cheese .
the restaurants are located in the area , so slowly .
&quot; when i was in the company 13 years ago , i was a vegan , i was still a lot more difficult , &quot; he said .
&quot; if enough evidence of enquiries come , they may be inclined to consider the menu .
vegane restaurants develop into a real paradise for the lovers of the comb in mannheim or the bird café .
proctor has the desire to make the same thing happen to other restaurants as well .
in fact , the vegetable proteins are the same for everyone .
each can be eaten , they are therefore exactly the opposite of exclusive .
&quot; meat dishes are , however , exclusive and not in the truest sense of the word , because they exclude others , &quot; proctor states .
&quot; if you want to avoid food scandals , you have to be vegan .
the purchaser will be able to buy vegan products at the beginning .
in particular , if we learn to understand the meaning of the word &quot; animal &quot; in strawberries , it is not clear that the use of these additives is not compatible with the ethical principles of so many hurdles and quickly falls .
not only because of this , reuben proctor and lars thomsen have written a book : &quot; veganissimo - animal ingredients - animal ingredients and their alternatives &quot; explains the many ingredients that are food and animal products .
&quot; after and after , one develops a scanner look and knows where the characters and logos are to be respected &quot; it is sometimes better to take small steps than to steal .
the vegan lifestyle , it is a major moral and spiritual finger , and it is based on awareness .
perhaps the council will not be able to make its habits clear .
the exchange council is the only one to have a trading licence for the nazdaq omx .
the trade in the nasdaq options market is developed on friday morning .

the other eleven us opposition parties have been allowed to sell their products to the us government , including two of the nasdaq omx .
the recent incident in the united states puts a whole series of small and larger panes in the stock market operator .

in august of this year , it had been in a week alone , two panes .
first i had the us investment bank goldman sachs because of technical problems with the purchase of goods that had been largely flawed to the options markets .
the commission then needed a clear statement from the stock exchange operators almost a whole day to make the order browse and delete it .
two days later , the half of the total stock trading in the us came to the end of the year because of a computer crash on the nasdaq stock exchange .
for orders of this kind , the commission also had a price of eur 25.00 last year .
the nazdaq-systems were the river of ideas and ideas that led to the rise of the market .

tax on foreign real estate owners against london &apos;s speculative bubble
the financial ministry has provided provisional information on the cgt measure .
the commission is already exceeding the revenue from the stamp tax on housing property in the districts of westminster and kensington &amp; chelsea , which is to be increased by eur 1 billion in tax year 2012 / 13 .
cook said : “ after the increases , the commission is now at the point of raising the rate of high-value housing and the introduction of the associated legislation against a leakage , high-quality real estate is too low . ”
“ yet this step could take some foreign investors more cautious , which would make the purchase of property in london , or the owner of it .
first-class properties – the top property companies in the world are five to ten percent of the housing market at the price of the wealthy southwest belt , which is surrounded by fulham to wimbledon .
the prices in central london were a level equivalent to the average annual growth of 5.6 % .
scientists have more light on how the universe is being distributed .
previous versions of the research showed that the gambling dogs were very happy with the cock .
but now we are told by scientists that other dogs have this subtle difference .
professor of economics at the university of rome , professor georgio vallortigara , has been saying : “ when people are well known , they are the left and the right brain .
here you can find some information about the different types of species .
he noted that the commission is not responsible for the content of the website , just like the human brain .
to learn more about how to use hounds on the page , please contact us .
you are taking the heart rate of the four-legged and analyzed the behavior .
it is likely that we will soon understand why the cock is getting into one , sometimes in the other .
professor of the university of applied sciences , professor vallortigara said : “ we have shown dogs – either a natural , a healthy version or a silhouette to be distracting other aspects .
if the animals are watching , how a otherwise exploited animal is being killed by a man who is not able to take the cock ( from the perspective of the wearing dog ) , the animals remained completely relaxed .
was it the pregnancy of the woman that was mainly left ( again from the perspective of the dog , the weather ) ?
after the commission has presented its opinion , professor vallortigara is not interfering intentionally with each other through these movements .
he is , on the contrary , convinced that the dogs have learned from experience , in which movements they have to worry and when they are not .
he said : “ if you want to meet different people in different ways and the weather is good , you can have a dip in one direction rather than a friendly one and you have to have a less friendly attitude on the right side .
the formula for the research is that the findings are hundewohner , veterinarians and trainers that will help to improve the understanding of the emotions of your animal .
john bradshaw , expert in the field of dog behavior and host breeding , has been working on the faculty of animal health at the university of bristol .
the last year , a team of the university of lincoln found that dogs had to leave their head to the left when they had an aggressive dog .
in a different research work on the university of victreoria in canada , the following was : “ dogs go more towards a robot dog than a dog when his dog is pregnant . ”
according to him , the differences could therefore arise because the us government ’ s dogs were not allowed to eat animals in the films or the robots ’ dogs .
a study that was carried out on how dogs were to react to real dogs could help .
“ while there are considerable differences in the number of different mammals that the two have been affected , the two brain halves are not yet known to many of the details .
as the country &apos;s behavior is simply emerging , it is likely that the country will not be long before we understand why the war on the cock sometimes turns into one , sometimes into the other .

papst franziskus appointed the president of the republic of croatia in february .
papst franziskus will be in the new cardinal rooms of the catholic church for the first time on february 22 , as the vatican announced on thursday .
kardinaoke are the most important monastic monks in the catholic church after the pope .
at present , there are 201 cardinals .
however , a cardinal , who is an old 80 years old , can not be returned to the pope &apos;s election – that is , a group of 120 “ electorate eligible cardinals ” .
in a statement issued by the commission on 11 september , the president of the european parliament , pater federico lombardi , said that the united states is going to meet all the cardinals .
“ pascal lambert ” is a great leader in the history of the church of st. john , and his decision to convene the consistorium in february to make it known to other meetings that would facilitate the participation of cardinals from all over the world .
jack valero of catholic voip is saying that the most important thing is that the number of people entitled to vote is probably falling by february .
he explained that a package of the nominees normally appoints as many cardinals as necessary to ensure that the number of eligible voters is reduced .
the consistorium next year is therefore important .
at the moment , there is a certain overlap on the part of europe and , in particular , italy .
“ it will be interesting to see how the market is growing faster than the new pope ’ s cardinals from the rest of the world .
fourty per cent of catholics live in south america , but they have only a tiny minority .
the cardinals of the cardinals will be the first to be held since the formation of the church founded by francisco .
in the past , the council of europe ’ s pope decided everything alone .
“ now the french have a great deal of experience in the eight cardinals that help him , ” said valero .
he explained that there is “ good possibility ” that the french and the dutch would not be able to get advice .
but , so far , we have not been able – all of this is new .
valero said that the typical use of the bible is that of large places , and that the bishops are called to cardinals , but franziscus is “ full of surprises – we do not know who he is appointed . ”
gm ruffle new pickup trucks in the usa to repair the seat backrest .
general motors calls almost 19,000 of his brand-new chevrolet silverado- and gmc sierra pickup trucks with construction year 2014 , to build a problem with the manual version .
in some of the cars , there may be a defect in the mechanism for withdrawing the front seat backrest .
for this reason , they do not meet the federal guidelines for vehicle safety for headrests .
“ if we talk about the problem of the car from the back , it is possible that the head restraint will not affect the passengers correctly , so that an increased risk of injury is present ” , was reported on the website of the national police .
the retracted funds are used between the 1st of august and the 10th of september .
the delivery of the gm trucks started in june and is the most important model launch of the leading american car manufacturer since the insolvency crisis .
gm informed the public about the new version of the vehicle in the first half of october .
the nhtsa could not be reopened because of the 16 day government shutdown .
the sale of the silveradobe and sierra nevada trucks , which were planned for the 2014 model , was completed in the first ten months of the year by 20 percent , declared gm on friday .
in october , the gm 42.660 silveradobe camera raw data storage engine sold its products to the public .
the gm shares are increasing at the new york stock exchange by 1.4 percent to 37.7 percent .
the despair of the people of the us is a despair of a obama electorate .
i have listened carefully to president obama twice in the hope that the change will be possible .
he says that obama has lost praise for his efforts to improve the security of the us government ’ s blockade tactics .
the blocking policy excuse not the website-problems of obamacare , which threatens to attack the web .
obama ’ s memoirs of the election campaign in 2008 were a sad reminder of the things that can have been done .
nathanael nerosa , the founder of the university of minnesota , was a student at harvard medical school in the second year of the year .
i read the report that there is a terrible sadness .
it is a book that i know from .
it is called the author of the book “ the audacity to win ” .
if i am in the evening with my patient &apos;s signatures and i am going to bed , then i am going back to a time when the politics of inspiring millions and giving a speech a breath of breath .
the choice was made at a landslide victory and news censorship .
my piano lessons are not only wearing joy and my parents collectively gathered all the newspapers that they find .
a young and dynamic team of visionaries was on the way to the white house and the nation was ready for change .
as a result of that , when obama took office in 2008 , he had received approval ratings of 82 % .
and then i join the house of commons .
once again , switch to the present is a evil .
it is hard to imagine the same optimistic times .
in the years that have passed since i first voted , i have seen a real change .
but it is simply nothing to do with the fact that the commission is not in a position to do anything .
i recognise that the great efforts made by the european parliament have been great and varied , but i would like to say that the adoption of the &apos; adult care act &apos; is a step in the right direction , from the point of view of the iraqi people .
the commission is also of the opinion that the party political blockade tactics are too many to be abandoned .
but , having spent countless times on the obama administration ’ s colleagues and acquaintances , i am very satisfied with my explanation attempts .
i have received one point of political despair .
the republican blockade can no longer explain why it should be possible to stop the interrogation of foreign heads of state or to stop the killing of innocent children by drones in overseas .
it can not explain why the commission has not yet adopted the national security agency data on private life of americans .
it can not explain why the commission has not been allowed to visit anwar al-awlaki , an american citizen , without trial , and why the public funding and development funds are being cut during the presidential election .
it justifies not the results of a report which states that the european union &apos;s efforts to combat climate change are being undermined by the &apos; aggressive &apos; ... since the nixon government .
and , more recently , it cannot be the incapacity to live in the more than three years since the adoption of the affordable care act .
i know not , but i am sure that the commissioner will be able to do so .
whether i am at 18 , i would have been able to understand that government work is not going to contradict your previous political campaigns .
obviously , the statute of members is not a predictable course , as an opposition party is not a party and incidental events like the newtown massacre have precipitated public debate .
but if i look at the above examples , i see that the two are largely separated from the government itself .
and that does not bother me most .
i have 2012 again obama , but not because i am talking about his candidacy , but because i am a president .
lunch is served from 12 : 00 to 14 : 00 .
i had the impression that a second term of office for obama , free of pressure from future elections , would give hope that he would be able to continue to use his term .
but , with the fall in the approval ratings for obama on less than 45 % this week , the return to 2008 has been replaced by this book even more severe .
it is a source of hope for me that the european union will be able to deliver on the many promises it has made .
this week i read a section in the book that explains how to use the term obama has lost a serious loss to clinton in the pre-election in pennsylvania .
in a meeting with the election workers , following the decision , he said to his staff that they would have to go back to the course and follow the purpose of their cause .
“ i want you to be able to enjoy our magic ” , said he .
we must be reminded that who we are .
it is five years later , mr president , that we have to make a decision .

clive palmer claims that prime minister tony abbott has been in conflict with parental leave by claiming that he has had conflict of interest in parental leave between prime minister tony abbott and prime minister tony blair .
the billionaire and clive palmer say that prime minister tony abbott would be in a conflict of interest in his plans for the parental leave he had , because his daughters will be pregnant .

the palm united party is a small , but very popular and popular party .
but palmer claimed that the us was the only country to have conflicts of interest and that the daughters of abbott personally would benefit from the laws .
“ he is in a state of great interest , when it comes to paid jobs , ” he says .

dr. georges bwelle brings free medical assistance to remote areas .
bwelle and his team spend almost every weekend in making hundreds of patients .
in the western african country , there are not many doctors who are only one for 5,000 people .
do you agree , or do you agree with your mobile device ?
dr. georges bwelle is one of the top 10 of the &quot; cnn heroes of 2013 &quot; .
you can use the same name for him or any of the other heroes in the top 10 to make him a &quot; cnn hero of the year &quot; .
the winner of the prize is $ 250,000 to continue his extraordinary work .
21 years of the world saw georges bwelle with his sick father becoming ever more aware of the fact and becoming a hospital .
jamef bwelle was born in 1981 in a car accident near munich , where he was a member of the british parliament .
first i had only one broken arm , and then i was able to make a small cup of flour , which was spread over his brain .
“ it was not a neurosurgical surgery in cameroon , ” says georges bwelle .
we would have liked to see him coming from cameroon if we had had the money .
instead , he spent a lot of years trying to convince his father to leave in overcrowded clinics and hospitals .
“ it is not easy ” , commented barbara .
it is possible to vote at five o &apos;clock in the morning and race to the hospital to be the first , and is not the first .
it is very important that we have a very large number of patients .
some people die even if they are waiting .
the situation has changed little .
in cameroon , there is only one doctor for each 5,000 people , so the world health organisation .
consequently , the problem of the relationship in the united states is that a doctor is 413 people .
but even if it is a doctor for you , it is possible that most camera manufacturers will have to wait for the visit .
two of the five people in the country live below the poverty line .
“ the only problem that we have is that you don ’ t have the same poverty ” , says bwelle .
and the poverty makes it impossible to achieve the lives that we have .
the father and so many of his compatriots were seen in bwelle the decision to leave something to be done about it .
dr. georges bwelle and his volunteer team have worked closely with the european parliament to carry out 700 free operations last year .
he was himself a doctor and worked as a vascular surgeon in central hospital in yaoundé .
in addition , he founded a non-profit organization called ascoville , which is involved in the development of rural areas at weekends and provides free medical care there .
since 2008 , he and his volunteers have spent almost 32,000 people on the project .
almost every friday of the week he and until the 30th person in small buses and drive with the verschlütten medical equipment on the roof over unpaved terraces .

the first european union member state to have replaced the vehicles with rivers and mud .
but if you are coming , you will be like heroes : a feast of the spirit , a singing and dance and the best accommodation that the place to offer .
in these villages , the free medical care is really a reason for celebration and bwelle – with its wide smile and its unlimited energy – is happy to help with the cheerful celebration .
on the next morning the team starts with the investigation of hundreds of people who have been diagnosed .
“ pro ride we treat 500 people ” , says bwelle .
you come from a surrounding of 3 km , and you will reach the village of sant &apos;egidio on foot .
each of these weekend clinics offers medical care in a number of areas .
many people will be arrested for malaria , tuberculosis , malnutrition , diabetes , parasites , and sexually transmitted diseases .
other people get crutches , donated glasses or free birthday documents – a document that is important for school .
in the evening , the team conducts simple operations with local anaesthetic .
the operational activities are usually carried out in a school , the town hall or an apartment ; after the installation , the patient is on and going to the recreation area , to be able to make room for the next .
the lighting is designed for the op and the decoration of the disinfection equipment .
it is a strenuous effort to make , but the village musicians are helping to make the team motivation to work .
“ you are drying the whole night , so that we can stay awake and continue our work , ” says bwelle .
on sunday , the team will return to the city where they will be tired but proud of the work done .
the group – a mixture of camera and psychotherapist from abroad – has developed a new , innovative and innovative system of surgical surgery last year , and knows that it has made a huge difference to the people who help .
a man explained that the world &apos;s free operation of a belt of performance he received was a great help to him .
“ the change in the future of my family ” , the man said .
in addition to the weekly clinics and his work as a surgeon in the hospital , bwelle also works in private clinics in yaoundé at night .
with this second job , the commission financed 60 % of its non-profit activities , so it remained at the level of the rest from private donations .
“ i know that i am not sure when he sleeps , ” katie o &apos;malley , who was born in the second year of drexel university in philadelphia medicine , said voluntarily .
he is always either in hospital or in an attempt to spend money on the organization , so he can respond to these campaigns .
for medical and medical doctors , the commission has proposed a new system of training for the benefit of health students such as o &apos;malley , who come from the united states and europe and support them .
“ we can be very successful in operations , where we can help to save blood , ” says the german federal ministry of economics and technology ( dfg ) , explains o &apos;malley .
the commission would have done this as a medical student in the second year .
the students pay their journey to cameroon themselves and bring often mixed donations .
are you , however , in yaoundé first , bwelle takes over the accommodation , transportation and instruction .
“ he is quite without doubt a hero , ” says o &apos;malley .
he devoted himself to his life to this organisation and his desire to give the cameroon people a helping hand , knows no borders .
for bwelle , the almost permanent work is no strain .
other people who are happy with life are not only the victims of the crime but also the victims of the crime , and they are also the victims of the crime .
“ i am so happy that i can &apos;t see this work . ” he said .
and i think of my father .
i hope that he will see what i am doing .
i am concerned about the fact that people are being laughed again and that the pain is being alleviated .

who wants to visit cologne is coming to the cathedral .

but only a few visitors who have seen the two branches of kirchttowers are able to admire the beautiful view of the castle .
rainer schule is an expert in the cologne / bonn subworld .
meeting point for his guided tours is the service center of cologne .
the tour is starting at a very unspectacular end : &quot; we are beginning to see the underground car park &quot; , says schulze .
in the 1970s , the us and the european union wanted to build a city that is compatible with the car , and so the remains of the old city wall remained just what was not too big .
the majority of users of the eilen parking garage are therefore now also taking part in the roman remains and only putting their car off .
but who is more closely watching , discovers in the parkdeck d2 a metal rod that is separated from the metal iron rods .
the show is about five meters high ruins of handtlery large stone , which are still visible .
&quot; it is real remains of the roman city wall , which was built in the second half of the first century after christ .
before it is back to the daylight , it is time for the participants to be able to take their own view of the finer park .
the first step is to find the path of the old cathedral , which is , unfortunately , hardly visible .
nearby station of the tour is the magnificent pretorium , and here you can get up again .
we are witnessing the official status of the former powerful state of the north of the alps .
what ccaa means is that a visitor group wants to know .
&quot; the abbreviation stands for &quot; colonia clarke &quot; , a young artist who has been working in the field of the arts in good german .
and when it comes to the pretorium , it is the former seat of the state palace , the centre of power of the roman empire on the rhine .
from the front of the exhibition a tunnel leads to the entrance to the roman sewage canal , which is located here at about 120 meters long .
&quot; you can rest a bit along the so-called clowning line .
a surprise of this is that schulze is still .
after having been involved in the payment of the key , he leads the bank group to a 16 meter deep , which is then accessible to the public .
&quot; we are now in the midst of the new rites , a ritual jewish bath , &quot; he explains .
the jewish community of baute built its bath deep in the ground to be connected to the groundwater , which is responsible for the ritual washing .
until now , the lower part of the millennium bc has been the site of the mikwe , whose origins go back to the eighth century , which has been replaced by changing peaks of the rhine .
the millennium development goals are part of an archaeological zone on the rathautic square , for which the construction works will be due shortly .
until the final version , however , a few years will still be passed .
bin almost abhacked : curved again from rocker process .
a blood elves attack is not only a threat to the world , but also a threat to the world .
a process for experiments on dead animals , dangerous animals , and other subjects that are not covered by the law for two thirty years has taken place in the frankfurt district court .
he will be accompanied by strict safety measures .
the requested action was taken by the defendants to the start of the campaign .
you should be able to use the rocker scene and be one of the banddidos at that time .
the prosecutor &apos;s office raises the question of whether or not to establish a european prosecutor in june 2009 , together with unknown accomplices in finowfurt , in a car .
all victims were severely injured , a man would have lost his leg almost .
the victims should be forced to compete with the halls angels group .
one should be a high-level committee member from berlin .
the first of these was apparently the fact that the police had a hunt for several cars .
according to the prosecution , the case was about rebellion and a demonstration of power .
the two employees of the defendants were in a first trial at the beginning of 2012 .
a court case is a case in point when he said that there was no evidence that the police had been involved in the bloody feud .
the perpetrators had masks worn and were not recognized .
the federal court of justice has ruled that the judges have been revised and that the court has issued a further ruling on the matter .
one of the defendants is currently in prison for another offence .
for the opening of the event , the main focus was on the reconstruction of the processes in the tatnacht .
as a witness , the then erased plan by the commissioner was loaded .
in the center were mobile phone calls from the defendants and other people who were abducted from the police .
it is difficult to see how rockers can almost always get to the court to get a law that they can judge .
the same applies to the victims .
in the first process , only one of the victims was poured out .
prosecutor , stefan golfier of the public prosecutor &apos;s office in frankfurt ( or ) , said , on demand , that since the last trial , there have been new traces of this kind .
for the process , eleven further negotiating chapters are scheduled .
the removal of waste is a matter of thinking not only about the transport company but also about the transport company .
the night was long , the music loud and the mood good , but sometime it goes home .
only : in the trees , the people on the side passenger seat and the back seat , the driver &apos;s hunger is noticeable .
it is clear that the one or other cocktail is not the right one to do so .
what is the point , then , as is being chilled for the next drive in , to be able to take a little bit of a break ?
i admit that the commission has not been very happy to be involved in this at night or at night .
a few pommes , a cola , a burger and then nox like from after home and into bed !
but , on the way home , the most obvious problems are those between me and other hungry disco goers .
because what do we need to miss , that you can get to know your favorite things with steady regularity ?
before all , the weekends are full of wetlands of paper , which are now being burnt on street edges and on parking spaces .
&quot; why is this ? &quot; i ask myself .
are the people too doof , to the cloths with after home respected , until the next mill glue .
it is not the only case that the european parliament &apos;s paper product is disappearing , of course .
tüches also have a transport system such as leitplanks , thus causing accidents .
the report is not about what thinks &apos; disposable company &apos; but about what it does not think , probably it does not even know what this word actually means .
if you want to spend more time on the beach , you can do it with a lot of people in the car .
as a result , some bags would be more or less also nix .
i see no reason why the commission should not be allowed to take part in the wegrämmen .
obama ’ s retreat to the health policy
after intense debate , the commission president made a proposal yesterday for a retrograde step in the frequently repeated , unambiguous promise : “ if you like your health insurance , you can keep it . ”
after hundreds of thousands of people have been insured by their insurance company , they are waiting for the government to take the president to the hospital in recent days , and they have asked the american public to deceive him .
yesterday , we relativized his original concept of “ the world ” .
“ the overwhelming majority of the citizens who live in a functioning health insurance are in a position to keep it , ” he said in a speech in boston .
as a result of the numerous media reports on the dismissals , obama has called on those americans who have received such communications to focus on the free market for a new insurance .
the majority of citizens could thus find a better , more comprehensive health insurance for the same price or lower than forecasts .
“ you come a better life and offer ” , he said .
the government is calling it a little unsurprising that the government has been so slow to absorb the five percent of the population that has itself insurance .
“ i want to give these americans a very direct say : they have earned better , ” said sebelius at a hearing before the energy and climate change committee of the house of representatives in washington .
sebelius , the most important project for the implementation of the affiliate care act , is the director of the institute for the promotion of the online platform since october .
“ i am as frustrated and angry as any other , ” said she .
i am determined to do everything in my power to regain your trust .
this reconciliation is not a good thing , but it is a very important one .
after more than three hours of hearing , the european parliament urged long sebelius to deal with the question of why “ architects ” of the affordable care act did not voluntarily respond to a state-sponsored insurance policy .
government in jerusalem
a us president , barack obama , who anonymously wanted to stay anonymous , said on thursday that he had a very serious problem with the us news station that israeli fighter aircraft had been killed one day before .
the aim is &apos; rapid reaction &apos; and &apos; associated equipment &apos; .
syrian and lebanese media , as well as the arab channel al-arabiya , had previously reported that the base in the port town of latakia was in the night of wednesday .
the israeli-tv channel has been showing satellite images of the base station , in latakia , on which russian dissent is being used by the s-125 newa and a battery-powered sa-3 missile .
uncertain the government in jerusalem , however , has officially not confirmed the attack .
however , the commission &apos;s news agency quotes in the same way an anonymous israeli journalist , mr reuters , saying that he believes that israel must have carried out the attack , but is not certain .
a spokesman for the israeli defense ministry said , in any case , &apos; we are not commenting on these reports &apos; .
the journalist , ron ben-yishai , stressed in the daily newspaper yedioth ahronoth that the country ’ s regime has already been , and is , in part successful , trying to rebuild ground air missiles .
the israeli government has had repeated warnings that it will not be possible to stop syria from trying to use hezbollah with chemical or other dangerous weapons .

by using the integrated software , you can easily find us in the us government in a diplomatic storm of indignation on the part of its allies .
in the event of a video connection , the user may not be able to access the internet at the open government conference in london , kerry said , “ it is absolutely clear that the president and i and others in the government have learned of some things .
then , the council recognised that it was the first high-ranking member of the us government to admit that the us espionage had crossed a border , but also stressed that no rights were abused .
he said : “ in some cases , the unreasonable thing is gone too far . ”
the president is determined to provide clarity and to do so , and to conduct a thorough investigation so that no one can feel that the council is being misused .
i assure you that the commission will not tolerate the rights of innocent people in this process .
kerry was , however , insistent that the nsa was a force of good , and that its surveillance operations put many lives at risk .
he added that the commission ’ s proposal is a very important one .
it is a radical change in extremism in the world that is obsessed with the fact that people are killing , in the air , in the air , and in the attacks on governments .
what would be if the commission were to be able to do this ?
we have indeed planes in the air , attacks on buildings and the murder of mr mugabe , because we have been working on this in the run-up to such plans .
meanwhile , the us and us legislators will travel to europe to address concerns about the supposed american spionage .
senator christian schumachy from connecticut , said that he had not been with representatives of the european parliament and other people this week and was concerned about their threats to move away from the european parliament because of the frustration about national security .
“ it is very important for the national security interests to be able to rely on the european security strategy to ensure that our joint efforts against terrorism are carried out ” , said murphy , who was appointed a democrat for the first time .
in addition , i go to europe to make it clear that the european union is not just a matter of working together , irrespective of its anger at the nsa programmes .
media reports , according to which the nsa has received millions of telephone data in europe , have greatly improved relations with some us allies .
other designs include the &quot; the &quot; new &quot; , &quot; the &quot; new &quot; , &quot; the &quot; new &quot; , &quot; the &quot; new &quot; , and &quot; new &quot; .

in all this , the tumult said that the european union &apos;s authority is preparing to travel to congress .
the names of the other participating countries are to be published in the coming days .
he said that the exact maturity of the journey will be elaborated .
during the time murphy stressed that the purpose of the trip was to improve relations , he also said that the goal was to make some “ serious words ” .
he said that the european governments should be able to be honest with their people about the kind of espionage programmes they have been conducting for years .
“ while we can ’ t keep our monitoring programs under control , we can better protect europeans ’ rights , but they must also be able to do so by recognizing that we are not the only ones to espionage ” , murphy says .
meanwhile , the european union is facing a new era of global warming in the weekend , and john kerry is on the way to the poles over the us strategy in syria .
