expert advice : more safety for pede@@ stri@@ ans
they are not 100 meters from each other : on tuesday , the new b 3@@ 3-@@ foot@@ bridge is opened in gu@@ t@@ ach at the village parking lot - in sight of the older ram@@ parts .
two plants so close together : intention or tur@@ tle ?
this question has been made clear by the committee of the may@@ ors yesterday .
&quot; the city hall light was installed at that time because it was the school way , &quot; explained ec@@ ker@@ t yesterday .
the k@@ lu@@ ser@@ -@@ light safe both cy@@ cli@@ sts and bus passengers and the mountain residents .
the commission &apos;s official plant , which was officially launched yesterday , is important for the sul@@ z@@ b@@ ach@@ we@@ g / kir@@ ch@@ stra@@ ß@@ e cros@@ s@@ roads .
we have the museum , two churches , kur@@ park , the bus stop , a doctor and a bank as well as the traffic flow from the residential area › gru@@ b ‹ .
&quot; the high traffic and pede@@ strian traffic has had to be accompanied by another traffic light to ensure their safety &quot; , says ec@@ ker@@ t .
this is confirmed by peter ar@@ no@@ ld of the off@@ enburg country council .
&quot; according to current measure@@ ments , on the b 33 daily about 12 000 vehicles pass the municip@@ ality of gu@@ t@@ ach , of which about 10 percent are heavy goods traffic , &quot; says ar@@ no@@ ld .
therefore , the construction of another traffic light is more than necessary : &apos; safety is just going ahead &apos; , ar@@ no@@ ld says .
four transport inspec@@ tions have been carried out in total , but a circle has also been planned , but because of the narrow area in the sul@@ z@@ b@@ ach@@ we@@ g / kir@@ ch@@ stra@@ ß@@ e cros@@ s@@ roads .
according to ar@@ no@@ ld , the choice of location of the traffic lights was first tested : &quot; by means of an extra for us with particularly long wooden tri@@ bes , transport vehicles were extended .
the eur 15 000 million traffic light system itself is the most modern , which is currently available on the market , and the ar@@ n@@ old explained .
the plant is equipped with col@@ oured le@@ ds that illu@@ min@@ ate so strongly that the lights are from the drivers , for example , even at low sun .
and it is also econom@@ ical : the older lighting systems use about 100 wat@@ ts , the new ones just eight wat@@ ts .
there are three lighting systems per direction of travel .
ar@@ no@@ ld explained the technique of the new plant : it is equipped with two rad@@ ar sen@@ sors .
if the pede@@ strian press the traffic light button , the upper rad@@ ar sensor tests the traffic situation .
if the road is free , the pede@@ strian will get straight green , if not , it will take about 15 seconds .
another rad@@ ar sensor checks whether the green phase for the pede@@ strian is finished .
&quot; should a group or people with handic@@ aps go through the streets , the green period will be extended , so everyone will be able to get around safe@@ ly on the road , &quot; said ar@@ no@@ ld .
of course , the drivers must think along here as partners and observe the track .
this was not the case yesterday : the traffic light for pede@@ stri@@ ans showed green , noise a ceiling be@@ am , and the traffic light was not working .
jo@@ se@@ f win@@ k@@ ler has been writing the necessary documents for his child@@ hood for more than 30 years .
the catastro@@ ph@@ es of his catho@@ lic village child@@ hood - the lack of speech , the tend@@ ency to raw violence and bl@@ un@@ t sex@@ u@@ ality , the close and un@@ jo@@ y@@ ful nature - have di@@ min@@ ished the car@@ in@@ th@@ ian po@@ et .
the b@@ ü@@ ch@@ ner la@@ ure@@ ate is known mainly as a pro@@ sa@@ author , theatre texts are in his work ra@@ r .
coll@@ age from pro@@ sa@@ tex@@ tes ger@@ hard fres@@ ach@@ er presents for his performance &quot; weather lights on the ton@@ gue &quot; , which is now available in the garage x on the st. peter &apos;s square .
the theatre makers combine elements from the auto@@ bio@@ graphical style of the novel &quot; der le@@ i@@ be@@ i@@ gen@@ e &quot; ( 198@@ 7 ) with pro@@ sam@@ ines from &quot; le@@ ich@@ nam , his family lau@@ gh@@ ing &quot; ( 2003 ) .
on the largely empty stage - important requirements for the future : a broken stage , a new stage , a new stage , which is apparently being played .
director fres@@ ach@@ er seems to have little faith in the text .
the 7@@ 0-@@ minute performance over@@ comes the original with a ple@@ thor@@ a of director &apos;s in@@ jur@@ ies known from the reper@@ to@@ ire of post@@ dramatic works .
the actors in particular are often somewhat more frag@@ ile in the scen@@ ic trans@@ forma@@ tions that sometimes seem to be un@@ clear .
they are being har@@ d-@@ pressed , ex@@ changed with their heads under water , with their evening ro@@ bes pus@@ hed to the wall .
the cel@@ lo@@ ph@@ ane is a small , small , medium , and very large , and is made of a th@@ ick , solid , sta@@ tic , or sta@@ tic material .
the text is con@@ ceived in this har@@ d-@@ hit@@ ting way , however .

a black box in the car ?
american road pl@@ ann@@ ers are looking for a source of money to finance the dec@@ lining high@@ way system .
the devices that drive every kil@@ ome@@ tre and pass the information to the authorities are at the heart of a controversial attempt by washington to make the planned nuclear plant more efficient .
the normally rather bor@@ ing area of road planning suddenly has an intensive debate with color@@ ful al@@ li@@ ances .
liber@@ tari@@ ans have joined forces with environmental groups and are argu@@ ing for the government to keep the small boxes in place to record the kilometres that are driven – and possibly also where they have been driven – and then use the information for calcul@@ ation .
the tea party is app@@ alled .
the american civil rights association ( ac@@ l@@ u ) is also deeply concerned and expres@@ ses a number of concerns about data protection .
but , while congress has not agreed on an approach , several states are no longer waiting .
they are currently exam@@ ining how they can contribute to a system over the next ten years whereby drivers can be re@@ im@@ bur@@ sed for dangerous m@@ ile .
thousands of drivers have used the tac@@ ho@@ graph , some of which have been equipped with g@@ ps surveillance , and they have already tested it .
this really is a must for our country .
“ it is nothing we will only use , ” said has@@ an i@@ kh@@ r@@ ata , managing director of sou@@ ther@@ n cl@@ alia , who is the only one in the world to have a record of the dangerous events .
the way in which we pay these taxes will change .
the technology is there .
the initiative comes at a time when the highway trust fund , which is the source of tax revenue , is han@@ ding over to the us at the fuel exchange rate , is bank@@ ru@@ pt .
but america is no longer d@@ anced as much as it once did .
cars con@@ sume less petro@@ l .
the state tax on min@@ eral oil of 18@@ .@@ 4 c@@ ents per gall@@ on ( less than 4 euro c@@ ents per lit@@ re ) has not ris@@ en for 20 years .
politicians d@@ are not take the tax at high prices , even to raise a pen@@ ny .
“ the tax on petro@@ l is simply not sustainable , ” says le@@ e mun@@ n@@ ich , an expert on transport legislation at the university of min@@ n@@ es@@ ot@@ a .
its state has recently sold 500 cars with tac@@ ho@@ graph@@ s that allow a mil@@ e@@ age of paid taxes .
“ this represents the most viable alternative in the long run , ” he said .
bureaucr@@ ats call it mil@@ e@@ y-@@ based usage .
it is not surprising that the idea of urban liber@@ als is popular , because the tax could be used to increase the driving behaviour , for example , in such a way that cong@@ es@@ tion and emissions that are harmful to the climate are reduced .
california pl@@ ann@@ ers rely on the system to develop strategies to help the world ’ s ambitious , legally en@@ shr@@ ined goals .
but bill sh@@ u@@ ster from pen@@ n@@ sy@@ l@@ v@@ ania , the republic@@ an chairman of house transportation committee , has not yet said that he will be able to make the most viable long-term alternative .
the free marke@@ ters of the reason foundation are also convinced that the idea of driving drivers to the end of the distance they have travell@@ ed is a good one .
“ this is not a tax that is dis@@ appe@@ aring in a black hole , ” explains adri@@ an mo@@ ore , vice president of reason ’ s policy .
people pay directly for what they get .
the movement is also supported by two former us transport ministers , who were presented with congress in a report in 2011 , in order to move towards mil@@ e@@ age based accounting .
the us sen@@ ate approved a 90 million dollars expensive pipel@@ ine project last year , which would cost 10@@ ,000 cars .
but the majority in the house of representatives prevented the move and respon@@ ded to the concerns of members from rural areas who wanted to represent people who were in the daily rout@@ ine often bul@@ k on the road to work or to the city .
several states and major cities are nevertheless moving in the direction of their own accor@@ d .
the most committed one is o@@ reg@@ on , which currently employ@@ s 5@@ ,000 drivers for the country ’ s largest experim@@ ent .
these drivers will soon be paying mil@@ e@@ age charges instead of the fuel tax to the federal state .
ne@@ v@@ ada has already completed a pilot project .
new york city is also considering such a thing .
il@@ lin@@ o@@ is tests it to a limited extent with lor@@ ries .
and the i-@@ 95 coalition , to which the transport mini@@ stri@@ es of 17 states on the east coast belong ( including mar@@ y@@ land , pen@@ n@@ sy@@ l@@ v@@ ania , vir@@ g@@ ini@@ a , and fl@@ ori@@ da ) , is currently investig@@ ating changes .
the concept is not a universal hit .
in ne@@ v@@ ada , where recently 50 volunte@@ ers were equipped with the equipment , drivers were s@@ cep@@ tical about the idea that the government could track each of their movements .
“ concerns about big brother and such things were a big problem , ” says al@@ au@@ d@@ din kh@@ an , head of the strategy and result management in the ministry of transport of ne@@ v@@ ada .
people did not want it .
when the test was launched , the ac@@ l@@ u from ne@@ v@@ ada war@@ ned on their website , “ it would be relatively easy to use the tac@@ ho@@ graph@@ s in full-@@ size surveillance devices . ”
there is no need to create a gi@@ gan@@ tic , bul@@ ky technological infrastructure that will inevitably be used to create jobs and to create jobs .
ne@@ v@@ ada is a state in the world that is now seeking affordable technology .
in the process , kh@@ an argu@@ ed , the public would be more reas@@ su@@ red .
the hun@@ t for this technology has led some authorities to a small star@@ t-@@ up company called true mil@@ e@@ age in california .
the company was not originally registered to assist states in the taxation of drivers .
rather , it was their aim to create a market for motor insurance in an emerging market , where drivers would be able to make their own decisions on the basis of the mil@@ e@@ age they had taken .
but the devices it has tested are also useful to road pl@@ ann@@ ers , because they do not work with g@@ ps and provide only limited information that is regularly transmitted via mode@@ m .
“ people are more willing to participate if their speed and location are not recorded , ” says the president of ry@@ an mor@@ ris@@ on , managing director of true m@@ ile .
in some of these public pilot programmes , major mistakes have been made .
there are much cheaper and less in@@ tru@@ sive ways of doing this .
in o@@ reg@@ on , the pl@@ ann@@ ers experim@@ ent with driving drivers using a range of choices .
you can register for a device with or without g@@ ps .
or you don &apos;t choose any device at all and pay a flat rate based on the average of the prices that are paid by all residents of the state .
others hope to see the concept of a susp@@ icious public , by using the equipment with more functions , and by using at least one .
in new york city , transport officials want to develop a tax device that can also pay parking fees , pay insurance only for dangerous kilometres .
“ drivers would be more protected by the added value of the system ’ s benefits , ” says dr. h@@ ans sch@@ r@@ ö@@ der , a planning document from the city .
some transport pl@@ ann@@ ers , however , wonder whether all the talk of paying per m@@ ile is not just a huge di@@ str@@ action .
the metro@@ politan transport commission is responsible for the transportation of san francis@@ co bay area .
an additional one-@@ off fee or annual lev@@ y could be imposed on drivers with hy@@ bri@@ d vehicles or other vehicles that use little petro@@ l .
“ there is no reason for an operation when an asp@@ ir@@ in is sufficient , ” explains r@@ and@@ y r@@ ent@@ sch@@ ler , head of legislation and public affairs at the commission .
if we do that , hundreds of millions of drivers will worry about their privacy and many other things .
kö@@ ni@@ g@@ s@@ fel@@ d : small team be@@ ats w@@ ack@@ er to the ground .
the voluntary fire bri@@ g@@ ade managed its autumn main pro@@ be despite personnel short@@ ages , with a bra@@ v@@ our .
only 11 men took part in the exercise .
the comm@@ ander of the department , h@@ ans kam@@ mer@@ er , had taken over the property pen in the bur@@ g@@ ber@@ ger stra@@ ß@@ e in his practice .
the sa@@ wing should be done with a short circuit .
the resulting fire and smo@@ ke development have left two people in@@ ju@@ red , one of whom could still send an emergency call .
two bre@@ a@@ thing carri@@ ers of the armed forces made their way through han@@ s ka@@ m@@ mer after the first examination of the situation .
after a short time , the first person was found and released , and he was led into the open .
the second person had to be carried .
this was not so easy , as a narrow sta@@ ir@@ case was to overcome .
the building , a workshop with integrated st@@ all for two horses , was not easy to secure .
it stored a lot of wood and also stra@@ w bal@@ es in it .
there were also electric machines for wo@@ od@@ working .
the first attack was carried out on the tan@@ k in the vehicle .
another line was built by an over@@ floor hy@@ dr@@ ate in about 100 meters distance .
now three fire attacks have been made .
the building also used a hol@@ low be@@ am tube .
h@@ ans kam@@ me@@ rer was also involved in the exercise in showing what is possible with little available staff .
in case of serious problems , support is provided via the kö@@ ni@@ g@@ s@@ fel@@ d daily operations group .
the comm@@ ander was shown as the exercise proce@@ eded .
net@@ working of universities and companies is important .
during his visit to the district of bre@@ is@@ gau@@ -@@ ho@@ ch@@ black forest , president gui@@ do wol@@ f also visited ti@@ ti@@ ti@@ se@@ e-@@ neu@@ stadt to find out where the work@@ force of tomorrow comes from .
in the ho@@ ch@@ sch@@ war@@ z@@ wal@@ d funding centre , he joined the managing directors of the professional schools and the district gy@@ m@@ na@@ si@@ um and the chair@@ men of the parents &apos; advisory council on this important issue .
&quot; education is an important factor in the location of the company &quot; , under@@ lined cla@@ u@@ dia ste@@ l@@ le , director of the han@@ s-@@ th@@ om@@ a school , who has developed the net@@ worked school project ho@@ ch@@ sch@@ war@@ z@@ wal@@ d .
wol@@ f was impres@@ sed by the model projects for training .
since 2011 , the forest city has been co@@ operating successfully between the f@@ ör@@ der@@ z@@ entr@@ um , kre@@ is@@ gy@@ m@@ na@@ si@@ um and the vocational school centre .
he also p@@ raised the family-@@ friendly nature of the district .
&quot; it is important not only to look at the family phase , but also to look at the phase around the care of the care of rela@@ tives , &quot; wol@@ f said .
he also said that more and more employees are concerned about the care and care of their rela@@ tives .
&quot; without the support of employers , the resulting burden of labour can lead to an end to the working relationship &quot; , said wol@@ f .
but no one can afford to hire skilled workers , he said .
another particularly important factor is the net@@ working of universities and companies .
&quot; those who have already been able to experience the advantages of the region during their studies will continue to enjoy the benefits of their knowledge and skills in the regional economy , which will help to strengthen the region , &quot; said the president of the country .
only if there are sufficient training places available can the skilled person &apos;s needs be met .
in his opinion , the local advantage is its advantage .
he also experienced a lot of problems during his train journey from ti@@ ti@@ se@@ e-@@ neu@@ stadt to fre@@ i@@ burg , and the efforts already made to develop local public transport .

the more than 100 years old stone wall as the front of the pre-@@ renov@@ ation old school house of the kir@@ ch@@ stra@@ ß@@ e is to be re@@ opened with new buildings on the city &apos;s renov@@ ation cost plan .
in the days before kil@@ big , the first works of the renov@@ ation of the front school court were made a small wall of wall , stab@@ ili@@ zation and sta@@ tic relief of the more than one hundred years old stone wall with bal@@ u@@ str@@ ade .
the next step , alexander mis@@ ok said , is to remove the br@@ ä@@ un@@ ling@@ er stad@@ t@@ ba@@ um@@ am@@ t , the land@@ es@@ den@@ k@@ mal@@ am@@ t , in the planning and to develop a re@@ hab@@ ilitation concept for the old wall .
after that , a cost calcul@@ ation will be carried out by experts who will then be submitted to the local council for deci@@ ding and defining the further action .
a decision on this will probably be made next year .
after renov@@ ation , pav@@ ing and plan@@ ting of the old school yard , within the two sides of the church of st. paul built in 19@@ 12 , the new school must be opened in the fores@@ ee@@ able future as a follow-up measure that requires renov@@ ation .
the historic , one hundred year old wall of the old school court to kir@@ ch@@ stra@@ ß@@ e is famous for its water and fro@@ st damage , as no dra@@ in@@ age is present , renov@@ ation is needed and has a arch@@ ery .
deep cr@@ acks in individual stones bear witness to weather damage , but the wall is not currently in danger of collapse .
a stead@@ y wall is a pre@@ requisite for a school cour@@ ty@@ ard used by students , which is the result of the current fa@@ st@@ ening works .
originally , the school yard was already in the year 2008 / 2009 , but high un@@ scheduled expenses also brought a shift in the budget .
an important word in the historical school wall renov@@ ation , which has already been used for film sho@@ ts , is the national heritage office .
if you do not receive any information from this site , the city of br@@ ä@@ un@@ ling@@ en hopes to receive grants from the mon@@ ument protection organizations .
the students of the br@@ ä@@ un@@ ling@@ er primary school , which has now returned to a well refurb@@ ished old school building with new a@@ ula , can soon visit the old school cour@@ ty@@ ard .
ö@@ z@@ dem@@ ir wants to train jazz in stutt@@ gart .
the ongoing discussions on the future of music col@@ leg@@ es in bad@@ en-@@ w@@ ür@@ t@@ tem@@ berg have now included ce@@ m ö@@ z@@ dem@@ ir , federal chairman of the greens .
&quot; i think it is wrong to include ho@@ lis@@ tic education in the stutt@@ gart music academy &quot; , said ö@@ z@@ de@@ mir the &quot; stutt@@ gart state opera &quot; .
jazz and classical music are just part of the stutt@@ gart jazz scene .
this is contrary to what ö@@ z@@ dem@@ ir , who was the favourite in stutt@@ gart for a direct mandate at the federal election on 22 september , is proposing to the green / red state government .
this is pus@@ hing forward on the basis of an expert study , a re@@ organization of the five music col@@ leg@@ es in bad@@ en-@@ w@@ ür@@ t@@ tem@@ berg .
the programme will then include the study programme jazz and pop from the musi@@ k@@ ho@@ ch@@ sch@@ u@@ le stutt@@ gart to the musi@@ k@@ ho@@ ch@@ sch@@ u@@ le man@@ n@@ heim .
u.s. border : &quot; super tunnel &quot; to drug s@@ mu@@ gg@@ ling discovered
on the border between mexico and the us , investig@@ ators have built a &quot; super tunnel &quot; to s@@ mu@@ gg@@ le drugs and have closed it down .
as the us customs have said , the more than 500 metres long tube between ti@@ ju@@ ana and san di@@ e@@ go was equipped with electricity , rail tracks and a be@@ v@@ enti@@ lation system .
three susp@@ ects were therefore arrested , eight tonnes of mari@@ ju@@ ana and almost 150 kil@@ o@@ gram@@ s of co@@ ca@@ ine were se@@ ized .
the tunnel was not , according to the data , in use .
&quot; these car@@ te@@ ls are st@@ up@@ id if they think they could be dis@@ pers@@ ed under the rad@@ ar , &quot; said the att@@ or@@ ney general of the us district southern california .
the drug gan@@ gs were insu@@ red du@@ ff@@ y : &quot; if you continue to build such tun@@ nels and try to use them , we are determined to make this a huge waste of your dir@@ ty money .
both the us authorities and the mex@@ ic@@ an security forces are in a permanent struggle against drug car@@ te@@ ls .
since 2006 , more than 7@@ 7@@ ,000 people have been killed in mexico in connection with drug crime .
built by experts
due to the extensive equipment of the tunnel , the investig@@ ators assume that he is being used by architec@@ ts and engineers .
the track was equipped to produce electric and electronic cars .
on the mex@@ ic@@ an side , access is in a building 80 meters from the border .
according to the authorities , a lad@@ der leads 20 meters to the depth of the tunnel entrance itself .
the tunnel has a cross-@@ section of 1.@@ 20 meters of height and 90 cen@@ ti@@ metres wide .
he would have been able to move illegal immigration towards the united states .
two of the susp@@ ects were arrested in connection with the co@@ ca@@ ine fund .
the third , a mex@@ ic@@ an , was arrested for the conf@@ is@@ c@@ ated mari@@ hu@@ ana .
all three are threatened with life imprison@@ ment for the maximum pun@@ ishment , as officials have said .
since 2006 , eight such tun@@ nels have been discovered , said at the press conference in san di@@ e@@ go .
but this is the first time that in such a tunnel construction co@@ ca@@ ine has been found .
co@@ ca@@ ine is normally produced in smaller quantities , not through tunnel .
this shows the &quot; desper@@ ation &quot; of drug gan@@ gs , whose traditional routes have now been cut off , bill sh@@ er@@ man said of the drug hun@@ t de@@ a in san di@@ e@@ go .
they would do everything to get to the us .
no details have been given of the de@@ tain@@ e@@ es , at least one of them being mex@@ ic@@ ans .
they must be accompanied by prison sent@@ ences of up to ten years .
in 20@@ 14 , ge@@ is@@ sing@@ er will be celebr@@ ating the year 20@@ 14 , ge@@ is@@ sing@@ er fe@@ st@@ ja@@ hr
the city &apos;s anniversary of ge@@ is@@ ingen on the occasion of the 12@@ 50 .
the first written mention of the town is getting closer .
if in more than eight weeks the year ends , the anniversary year is on .
ho@@ stages and church houses were built in 7@@ 94 for the first time together .
in churches was a document produced in which both places were mentioned .
on 15 march , there will be an official start to the anniversary year , and since ho@@ stages are not in the hall at the moment , this opening event will take place in the place where it was first mentioned 12@@ 50 years ago , in france .
in the context of the anniversary , several events have been held in the field of ge@@ is@@ ingen as well as in kir@@ ch@@ en-@@ haus@@ en .
kir@@ ch@@ en-@@ haus@@ en will be performing on a festival weekend from july 18th to 20th in 12@@ 50 .
re@@ mem@@ br@@ ance celebra@@ tes .
on friday with a party , on saturday and sunday with a party around the kir@@ ch@@ tal hall .
this weekend &apos;s party also features the church house of st. peter .
city music director ru@@ dol@@ f bar@@ th has created a new album for the city on the occasion of the anniversary , which will be shown at three dates .
on 21 june , together with the sunday celebr@@ ation of the black forest association , on 12 july in the arena with fire@@ works and on 13 december as the first concert of city music in the new f@@ es@@ th@@ al@@ le .
this is celebrated in the anniversary year and is celebrated , the official date is last september .
on the occasion of the ge@@ is@@ inger city anniversary , a new chron@@ ic@@ le is also released .
&quot; however , a chron@@ ic@@ le should not only be of ho@@ stages themselves , but also a printed work about the ho@@ sti@@ lity of today , which is just from ge@@ is@@ sing@@ en , kir@@ ch@@ en-@@ haus@@ en , le@@ ip@@ fer@@ d@@ ingen .
and the ho@@ sti@@ lity of today celebra@@ tes 20@@ 14 birth@@ day , and in 197@@ 4 the present space was extended with the comm@@ uni@@ ties. the new building was built in the same way as the new town hall .
the new chron@@ ic@@ le will be published on 21 or 22 november in the new fe@@ st@@ hal@@ le in ge@@ is@@ ingen .
but 20@@ 14 is also a year with many anniversary .
the fo@@ ol@@ ish guil@@ d stro@@ h@@ gl@@ on@@ ki begins on 8 february with a customs evening on the occasion of its 6@@ 0-@@ year existence , the harmony gu@@ t@@ mad@@ ingen is 90 years and has the fe@@ st@@ ban@@ quet on 29 march and has .
the al@@ ten@@ wer@@ k le@@ ip@@ fer@@ d@@ ingen is 40 years old , the ge@@ is@@ inger sch@@ u@@ le has been in the new location for 50 years and celebra@@ tes it on 10 may , the musi@@ k@@ vere@@ in poly@@ hy@@ m@@ nia le@@ ip@@ fer@@ d@@ ingen is 150 years old and celebra@@ tes it .
the city of ge@@ is@@ ingen was founded in a gift certificate owned by the monaster@@ y of st. g@@ allen in 7@@ 64 for the first time .
the document was published in churches ( haus@@ en ) , which was then court place .
both communities are thus in the same document .
reason 20@@ 14 this 12@@ 50 year old to celebrate accordingly , additionally there is the local counc@@ ill@@ or &apos;s reform 40 years ago .
the council is targe@@ ting rail systems
if the railway crossing is to be &quot; lab@@ ori@@ ous &quot; , it is to be re@@ constructed to increase road safety ?
yes , have local counc@@ ils decided .
sch@@ il@@ t@@ ach has to pay 2@@ 20 000 euros for this .
deutsche bahn wants to support the kin@@ zi@@ g@@ tal railway line in the coming year .
in particular , safety at railway cros@@ s@@ ings should be increased - regularly there are col@@ li@@ sions between trains and other vehicles throughout the country .
if the communities agree to the reconstruction measures , they must participate with a third of the costs , the rest share the railways and the federal government .
sch@@ il@@ t@@ ach ’ s city buil@@ der ro@@ land gri@@ e@@ ß@@ hab@@ er explained to the municip@@ al council the specific@@ ity of the ba@@ h@@ rain transition .
there , the city plans to build a new building in the area , in the height of the tunnel to the west of the railway track .
there , too , larger vehicles , such as those trans@@ porting long-@@ tim@@ ber , could be in the off@@ -@@ road position without bloc@@ king the track .
gre@@ e@@ ks therefore proposed to create a necessary support wall in order to prevent the city from closing the next street at the appropriate time .
this was discussed in a controversial manner in the municip@@ al council , as some counc@@ ils ques@@ tioned the need for road traffic to be spread : thomas ki@@ p@@ p expressed the s@@ enti@@ ment of cri@@ tics : &apos; do we have to spend so much money on so few vehicles ? &apos;
may@@ or thomas ha@@ as dis@@ agreed : the railway transition &quot; h@@ ir@@ sch@@ en &quot; is regularly used for long-@@ wood trans@@ ports .
even wood from the &quot; ku@@ h@@ bach &quot; area is partly trans@@ ported over this route , because the vehicles up to 20 meters long make the line at the h@@ ä@@ ber@@ les@@ br@@ ü@@ c@@ ke impossible because they are not able to turn into the main road .
the route also served as a re@@ rou@@ ting for those vehicles that did not have the tunnel to use when the main road is closed , argu@@ ed h@@ ague .
as kir@@ ch@@ ber@@ g@@ - and sch@@ los@@ s@@ ber@@ g@@ tun@@ nel is being re@@ built and re@@ constructed , as is currently the case in wol@@ fac@@ h , the railway crossing can be &quot; on &quot; h@@ ir@@ sch@@ en &quot; for a longer period of traffic .
the counc@@ ils agreed to allow the costs of the planned spread of the disease to be investig@@ ated .
nevertheless , the re@@ building of the railway transition was approved by a majority , with the provision that the necessary support wall would be built to allow the city to carry out the subsequent road towards ba@@ hn@@ ho@@ f@@ stras@@ se , if necessary for encounter traffic 5.@@ 5 .
the transformation of the railway crossing at the ger@@ ber@@ i tr@@ aut@@ we@@ in could , on the other hand , lead to a quite different problem , which would make access to the so@@ aring &quot; ger@@ ol@@ tz@@ h@@ ä@@ user we@@ g &quot; easier .
the administration had to re@@ design the railway plans from the engineering office in bre@@ in@@ ling@@ er , since it had doubts as to whether the planned connection of the ger@@ ol@@ tz@@ haus to the railway was possible without further ado .
the investigation concluded that there was no possibility that the ngos would not be able to increase the proportion of the road &apos;s inc@@ lin@@ ation .
the responsibility for this lies with the city as the road load carrier .
the reconstruction could therefore cause li@@ abilities that arise .
since both de@@ fore@@ station and ben@@ ding are not included in the current state of construction , the conversion should be prece@@ ded by the change of railway crossing , h@@ ague argu@@ ed .
i would also like to mention here the risk of a col@@ li@@ sion of the train with a vehicle standing on the transition considerably lower than at other railway cros@@ s@@ ings , because the stop is right next to the center , to which a good connection is made .
even trains from the central station would have to be bra@@ ked to the point that no col@@ li@@ sion could occur .
the majority of the members of the committee refused to accept the re@@ organisation of this railway transition , as the city of sch@@ il@@ t@@ ach had to &quot; ba@@ the out &quot; with flo@@ ating vehicles , according to the counc@@ ils , since the railways with@@ dre@@ w from the work .
the board considers the re@@ building of the railway brid@@ ges as un@@ proble@@ matic &quot; before heu@@ bach &quot; and &quot; before ku@@ h@@ bach &quot; , for which agreements with the railway have already been made .
es@@ a deci@@ des on major space missions : missions for bil@@ lions of euros and bil@@ lions of euros of world space missions : missions for bil@@ lions of euros and bil@@ lions of euros .
far plan@@ ets , gra@@ vit@@ ational waves or black ho@@ les - experts from the european space agency must be able to agree on two major projects that they will be able to launch in the coming years .
thir@@ ty proposals were on the table , five are still in the race .
far off worl@@ ds .
more than 1000 plan@@ ets in other stars have already found a@@ stronom@@ ers .
whether it is life on some of them , at least , is not known .
the choice is difficult : should you search for gra@@ vit@@ ational waves ?
or rather the origin of the co@@ smo@@ s explore ?
or after earth like plan@@ ets , and perhaps ali@@ en life ?
these questions are being asked by those responsible for the european space agency es@@ a .
for your &quot; co@@ sm@@ ic vision &quot; program , you are looking for ideas for two major space projects that will make a decisive contribution to research .
the budget for such &apos; l missions &apos; is approximately eur 1 billion each .
the start is expected to be 20@@ 28 and 20@@ 34 .
in early september , the elite of the european space research group met in paris to make proposals for such missions .
thir@@ ty ideas were on the table , five of which have now been put to the narrow vote .
numerous bodies are exam@@ ining proposals to make ho@@ o@@ ks on researchers .
in the next few days , a final decision will be taken by the scientific programme committee .
in total , the es@@ a selected four major issues to which the missions of the co@@ smo@@ s programme , launched in 2007 , are to be answered .
what are the conditions for the emerg@@ ence of plan@@ ets and life ?
the exact processes of the creation of stars from large gas cl@@ ou@@ ds - and thus the formation of plan@@ ets that have these stars en@@ cir@@ c@@ led - are still in the pro@@ ver@@ bi@@ al dar@@ k@@ ness .
a large infra@@ red tel@@ es@@ cope in all could be able to pen@@ etr@@ ate this dark .
and if a star has a planet , what circumstances can life be created there ?
to address this issue , the space tel@@ es@@ cope is to be launched in 20@@ 17 , with the launch of 500 already known plan@@ etary systems in our ne@@ arer environment .
however , the possibilities are limited , che@@ ops is a small mission with a budget of eur 150 million .
with larger instruments , a@@ stronom@@ ers could dep@@ ic@@ t earth similar plan@@ ets , and even analy@@ ze the composition of their atmo@@ sp@@ he@@ res , and thus search for &quot; bi@@ om@@ ar@@ kers &quot; : g@@ ases that are considered as evidence of biological activity .
how does the solar system work ?
this issue , too , should ultimately give an indication of the conditions for the creation of life .
mag@@ ne@@ tic activity of a star and the interaction of its magnetic field play an important role in the development of the partic@@ le radiation with the plan@@ et@@ arium system .
in our solar system , these processes can be investig@@ ated as an example .
the &quot; solar or@@ bi@@ ter &quot; is the first es@@ a mission to be awarded the m class ( which is where the budget is about half a billion euros ) for this issue .
the pro@@ be is scheduled to start in 20@@ 17 and observe the surface and activity of the sun closely .
of great interest to the researchers are also j@@ up@@ i@@ ter and his mo@@ ons .
they want to find out what the giant planet &apos;s role in the development of the solar system has been .
this is the first of the three l missions of the co@@ sm@@ ic vision project , which is to be implemented .
the pro@@ be &quot; ju@@ ice &quot; ( j@@ up@@ i@@ ter ic@@ y mo@@ ons explorer ) begins your journey probably 20@@ 22 .
eight years later , j@@ up@@ i@@ ter was supposed to reach the planet &apos;s atmosphere and ic@@ y mo@@ ons , europe , k@@ all@@ is@@ to , and gan@@ y@@ med .
what are the basic physical laws of the universe ?
space offers many possibilities to find material under extreme conditions .
perhaps there are also de@@ vi@@ ations that could pa@@ ve the way for physi@@ ci@@ sts to develop a new theory under which all known natural laws can be united .
how did the universe come into being and what is it all about ?
13@@ .@@ 7 billion years ago , our co@@ smo@@ s emerged through the big ban@@ g .
in addition to the matter we are familiar with , from the stars , plan@@ ets and living beings such as we exist , there are dark matter whose gra@@ vity is gal@@ ax@@ ies and gal@@ ax@@ ies .
until now , researchers have neither known what physical laws were adopted in the first fr@@ action of the big ban@@ g , nor have any knowledge of what dark laws were valid .
with &quot; eu@@ cli@@ d &quot; , es@@ a has already conducted an m mission in this area , which is scheduled to start in 2020 .
with a special tel@@ es@@ cope the pro@@ be is intended to control the distribution of the matter in the universe for the first time in the entire sky , thus enabling conclusions to be drawn about the nature of dark matter and dark energy .
those who could race
of the 30 proposals , at the end of the selection procedure , only two remain .
the best chan@@ ces of being granted as an l mission are , in the opinion of many experts , &quot; e-@@ lis@@ a &quot; , has a sophisticated concept for pro@@ ving gra@@ vit@@ ational waves .
by this , physi@@ ci@@ sts understand changes in the structure of space time that al@@ bert e@@ inste@@ in predic@@ ted almost 100 years ago .
they have not been proven to date .
el@@ is@@ a could do this , the scientists hope behind the project .
the mission sees a two-@@ thir@@ ds detec@@ tor in place , which is located in space .
it could , in contrast to installations on earth , also produce gra@@ vit@@ ational waves that could be used to build the big ban@@ g , thus creating new insi@@ ghts into the emerg@@ ence of the co@@ smo@@ s .
four other proposals are still compe@@ ting for the second l mission : a large x-@@ ray es@@ cope called &quot; ath@@ ena &quot; , which is , among other things , investig@@ ating black ho@@ les , &quot; ic@@ y plan@@ ets &quot; , another one .
already left are suggestions for pro@@ tot@@ y@@ ping , re@@ tri@@ eval , re@@ tri@@ eval and re@@ tri@@ eval of ven@@ us and aster@@ o@@ id .
snow@@ den prepared to cooperate with germany in terms of us surveillance .
ed@@ ward snow@@ den , the wh@@ ist@@ le@@ b@@ lower of the us secret service , has said that he is prepared to travel to berlin and to speak to the german bun@@ de@@ sta@@ g when the american national security agency and its president are in office .
german me@@ p han@@ s-@@ christian str@@ ö@@ be@@ le met snow@@ den in russia on thursday , where this asylum was received to deal with him the statement in germany .
in a letter from snow@@ den , which was sent on friday from str@@ ö@@ be@@ le to the media in berlin , he wri@@ tes : “ although the result of my efforts has been demonstr@@ ably positive , my government is still tre@@ ating a dis@@ sent as a view as a continuing view .
but telling the truth is not a crime .
in the letter , snow@@ den wri@@ tes that he believes that support for the international community will strengthen the american government to strengthen the indic@@ tment against him .
the data collected by the us department of justice includes es@@ pi@@ on@@ age and the@@ ft of state@@ -@@ owned property .
the german minister for the interior , han@@ s-@@ peter fried@@ rich , said online : “ if mr snow@@ den is prepared to talk to german representatives , then we will find ways to make this possible . ”
relations between the us and germany are stra@@ ined by the claims that n@@ sa has bloc@@ ked chancell@@ or mer@@ kel ’ s cell phone .
thomas op@@ per@@ mann , the member who has appointed the parliamentary committee responsible for the secret services , said that we should se@@ ize the opportunity to witness snow@@ den as a witness if possible , ‘ without him ’ .
str@@ ö@@ be@@ le , a member of the greens , published a picture of himself and snow@@ den in his t@@ wit@@ ter feed .
he was arrested by two german journalists when he was visiting russia .
str@@ ö@@ be@@ le explained that according to the law@@ yer of the former n@@ sa employee snow@@ den did not return to russia if he had left the country .
if snow@@ den says in germany , he needs an assurance that he will be “ safe ” there , so the honourable member says .
snow@@ den states in his letter that he is committed to a “ serious and ongoing ” campaign of persecu@@ tion that is killing him out of his hom@@ eland .
however , it is affected by the global response to “ my act of political expression . ”
citizens around the world , as well as high-@@ level politicians – including those in the united states – have been deeply sho@@ c@@ ked by the rev@@ el@@ ations about an un@@ controlled system of comprehensive surveillance .
in his letter , snow@@ den is making an offer to the german authorities to cooperate , “ if the humanitarian problems have been resolved ” .
fronti@@ er airlines charges hand bag@@ gage fees for hand bag@@ gage .
fronti@@ er airlines plans to deplo@@ y up to $ 100 from passengers travelling by air or sea .
fronti@@ er airlines intends to provide up to $ 100 for a piece of hand bag@@ gage and $ 2 for coffee or le@@ mon@@ ade , even if the announcement on wednesday morning does not read .
the new fee applies to hand bag@@ gage in the bag@@ gage com@@ part@@ ment above the seat , small bags under the seat remain free .
fronti@@ er said that they are char@@ ging usd 25 if the fee is paid in advance and usd 100 for travellers who have only arrived at the gate .
fron@@ ti@@ er speaker k@@ ate o &apos;@@ mal@@ ley said that the fee of $ 100 targets to make travellers move , to move in advance around the payment .
“ we do not want to calcul@@ ate this amount , ” she explained .
airlines began to set up a new a3@@ 80 programme for the first and second bag@@ gage checked in in 2008 .
passengers who tried to by@@ pass them have therefore to pay as much as possible in their hand luggage .
fees are a way of encouraging passengers to travel less on board .
o &apos;@@ mal@@ ley said that the new fee is not really about spending money .
it is about the most loy@@ al customers of fronti@@ er , who would have clearly stated that it would be increasingly difficult to find a place in the field above the seat .
passengers who book their tickets on the airline ’ s website do not have to pay .
this means that a passenger on the gate of fronti@@ er may have to carry a piece of bag@@ gage free of charge , but the next person can pay 100 dollars for a similar piece of bag@@ gage .
o &apos;@@ mal@@ ley explained that the site of fronti@@ er and the check-in procedures would be changed so that passengers would be informed about the fee before they are to travel to the gate .
the new hand bag@@ gage charge from fronti@@ er will only enter into force in the summer , and there is no exact date yet .
passengers often ch@@ ase over bag@@ gage allow@@ ances and other charges , but airlines like to use it .
they argue that the transport of luggage is co@@ sting money and passengers this service should pay if they use it .
many on wall street view the new bag@@ gage charges as a sign that airlines are taking enough money to carry out their own luggage after years of loss .
most , however , have so far been fing@@ ers of charges for hand luggage .
spirit airlines inc@@ . requested three years ago to pay the first hand bag@@ gage fees and later to follow alleg@@ ant air , also a low-@@ cost flight .
the only other airline with such a charge is the hungarian wi@@ z@@ z air , explained the airline consult@@ ant j@@ ay so@@ ren@@ sen , who has paid the extra fees atten@@ tively .
in a december 2011 report , he estimated that the hand bag@@ gage fee spirit will cost usd 50 million ann@@ ually .
so@@ ren@@ sen , who used to be a leader in mid@@ west airlines , has been a member of the spirit group recently .
“ the boarding process was one of the smooth running , the most difficult of my career in the aviation industry .
i expected to be te@@ en@@ y and hand@@ y discussions at the gate .
“ the plane was full , ” he explained , “ and boarding went like lu@@ cky . ”
fronti@@ er also follows spirit in the 2 dollars spent on coffee , tea , le@@ mon@@ ade or ju@@ ice .
the company stated that passengers who use the le@@ mon@@ ade or ju@@ ice bought the whole can .
water remains free .
in 2008 , us air@@ ways had tempor@@ arily tried to make money for soft drinks , but made it seven months later to recover , after the passenger had reco@@ vered .
fronti@@ ers step , charges for hand luggage , if passengers are not directly involved in the airline , is not the latest initiative to deal with customers on the basis of their own website .
airlines pay online travel agencies such as or@@ bit@@ z 10 to 25 usd per ticket sold .
this gives all companies an incentive to buy passengers directly from them rather than through an online travel agency .
fronti@@ er is , however , the most advanced in this area .
in september , the company began to make reservations via an online travel agency only half the number of frequent fl@@ yer miles .
on wednesday , the miles were re@@ distributed to 25 % of the route .
a third party booking is not valid for a flight with a fronti@@ er of more than 1000 miles .
passengers can also buy directly from the fron@@ ti@@ er website .
fronti@@ er has a loy@@ al customer base at its headquarters in den@@ ver , but the business is shr@@ in@@ king and the company lo@@ ses money .
the proce@@ eds were reduced by 9 % and the flight capacity was down by just under 13 % in the first quarter , as reported in the financial report published on wednesday of the parent company .
republic@@ s has tried to provide a service to the public for the financial control of fronti@@ er .
pro@@ ver@@ bs come from the bi@@ ble
more than 40 women visited the last women &apos;s breakfast this year in the prote@@ stant church community of bis@@ ingen .
the theme of the day in the municip@@ al house were &quot; pro@@ ver@@ bs from the bi@@ ble &quot; and &quot; phr@@ ases from the middle ages &quot; .
z@@ ita kö@@ h@@ ler , the chairman of the council of the church , went to a talk after breakfast , which included the bi@@ b@@ lic@@ al pro@@ ver@@ b .
&quot; pro@@ ver@@ bs contain life@@ styles , regulations or war@@ nings , &quot; she explained .
she compared several words with the corresponding bi@@ ble places and explained the meaning .
she called pro@@ ver@@ bs like : hol@@ z@@ au@@ ge is vig@@ il@@ ant , like sc@@ ales fall from the eyes , cast an eye at someone who gives his the lord in sleep , his hands in inno@@ c@@ ence .
the speaker had her audience several times , even advis@@ ing the audience to know what the pro@@ ver@@ b was .
the words of the middle ages were taken from the church par@@ ish counc@@ ill@@ or christ@@ el de@@ h@@ ner : all good things are three , making blue , something to co@@ ok .
it explained the importance and origin of the speeches that you have called &apos; brid@@ ges to the past &apos; .
a ra@@ ff@@ le was awarded to the end of the race .
prices were on a table covered up and were hum@@ or@@ ously re@@ written before they were sent to the winners .
among the visitors of the breakfast round was also the may@@ or roman w@@ ail@@ en ’ s candidate .
learning rather than unemployed : pilot project for un@@ skilled tourism in the tourism industry
the mec@@ k@@ len@@ burg lake plate is the first building on the lake shore of the lake .
under the leadership of the federal employment agency , 49 women and men who have already been regarded as un@@ skilled in the industry are to be trained as professionals for hotels and restaurants for three winter periods .
&quot; what is new is that the six@@ -@@ month courses with qualifications end , &quot; said car@@ men wi@@ ec@@ her@@ t of the employment agency , neu@@ brand@@ enburg .
the benefits are many : they would not make participants unemployed , the companies would be trained , the public would be more and more involved in hotels and restaurants , and the agency would have to avoid financing unemployment .
the project also involves industrial and commercial cham@@ bers in neu@@ brand@@ enburg and the deutsche hote@@ l@@ - und gas@@ st@@ ä@@ t@@ ten@@ ver@@ band ( de@@ ho@@ ga ) mec@@ k@@ len@@ bur@@ g-@@ vor@@ pom@@ mer@@ n .
n@@ sa explains that an “ internal error ” and not h@@ ack@@ ers are guil@@ ty of the cr@@ ash of the site &apos;s cr@@ ash and not h@@ ack@@ ers are guil@@ ty of the site cr@@ ash .
the shadow national security agency declared on the late friday that an error had caused its public website to be par@@ aly@@ sed for a few hours and not h@@ ack@@ ers , as was claimed online .
&quot; n@@ sa@@ .@@ go@@ v was not reach@@ able for a few hours this night , as an internal error occurred during a planned update , &quot; said the sp@@ y team .
the problem will be fixed this evening .
the claim that failure is caused by a distributed den@@ ial of service call is not valid .
in the early evening , online server tr@@ ack@@ ers had noticed that the n@@ sa website had at least six hours of un@@ reach@@ able and this was not possible for some users .
previously , a n@@ sa spo@@ kes@@ man had declared to ab@@ c news that the authority ’ s sensitive internal network was “ in no way ” com@@ promised .
secret information is not in danger , so the speaker said .
at least one group of h@@ ack@@ ti@@ vi@@ sts claimed to have reached the n@@ sa website with a d@@ dos attack .
in such attacks , the target site is over@@ loaded with page views until the servers are over@@ loaded and the site is broken .
cy@@ ber@@ tac@@ tics are relatively simple , and the attacks are not designed to inter@@ f@@ ere with the target system &apos;s internal network .
the former super@@ -@@ secret n@@ sa , whose n@@ ick@@ name was once no such agency , was a non-@@ governmental organization , and is now in the light of the public eye , looking for the problems that have been revealed over the last few months .
the growing contro@@ vers@@ y surrounding the secret service fu@@ elled initial spec@@ ulation about the incident being a major outcome of a targeted attack on cy@@ ber operations .
slightly lower is the number of people without jobs in october by 22 to 1,@@ 30@@ 7 .
although the rate was higher than last year at 3.@@ 1 % , and also better than in september , &quot; we would have hoped for more , &quot; says mon@@ i@@ ka fel@@ der@@ -@@ bau@@ er , depu@@ ty managing director of the agency .
many companies have been re@@ acting to at@@ titu@@ des so far .
one reason for this is the fel@@ der@@ -@@ bau@@ er : &quot; we have hardly any skilled cra@@ ft@@ sm@@ en , health care and care for the elderly &quot; .
since september , the annual season has seen a new job offer for staff in the hotel and restaurant sectors .
in the middle of december the winter season begins there .

the loss of profits of bom@@ bar@@ di@@ er following the decline in supply and orders and the loss of orders for the aircraft , the loss of orders and the loss of orders , are the result of a drop in the number of orders and delivery .
the can@@ a@@ dian aircraft and railway manufacturer bom@@ bar@@ di@@ er inc reported on thursday a 15@@ -@@ percent increase in the net profit of the aircraft and the railway industry after a decline in its order and delivery .
bom@@ bar@@ di@@ er , based in mon@@ tre@@ al , did not publish flight test data for its brand new c@@ series aircraft and did not give any new information about whether the aircraft was being operated in accordance with the ambitious timetable for september next year .
on the jun@@ g@@ fer@@ n@@ fer@@ n@@ flu@@ g of the test aircraft a month and a half ago , only three more star@@ t-@@ ups were followed , which leaves it question@@ able whether the test phase is proce@@ eding as planned .
the results were not as good as those forec@@ asts , and led to a fall in the price of more than 8 % on the tor@@ onto stock exchange .
camer@@ on do@@ er@@ k@@ sen , analy@@ st at national bank financial , lo@@ wered his assessment of “ out@@ perform ” on thursday to “ sector performance ” in view of the fact that shares were in the next year to two .
“ while weak@@ er delivery rates on aircraft were expected to be as much as possible , the margin@@ s in transport are clearly dis@@ appoin@@ ting , ” do@@ er@@ k@@ sen said in a customer letter .
we believe that bom@@ bar@@ di@@ er is creating new orders for the c@@ series when the test program for the aircraft is progres@@ sing .
but if no new orders are announced in the coming months , we expect the market to be more s@@ cep@@ tical about the programme .
bom@@ bar@@ di@@ er hopes that the aviation crew of the c@@ series will be able to integrate the company into the lower market segment , which is currently being used by bo@@ eing and airbus .
the first test aircraft was presented to the public in march and fle@@ w to the united states for the first time in september after months of delay .
however , binding orders for the c@@ series have been moder@@ ated with 17@@ 7 , as potential bu@@ yers are not yet ready to see the results of flight tests and whether the company ’ s claims regarding fuel efficiency and cost savings potential of the new jet are accurate .
currently there are 4@@ 03 orders and commitments from 15 customers and companies .
board chairman pi@@ er@@ re beau@@ do@@ in is confident that bom@@ bar@@ di@@ er will achieve its goal of 300 binding orders at the beginning of the commercial use of jet .
on thursday , the company management assured analy@@ sts and media that the program would be on schedule .
“ the test aircraft has not remained on the ground any longer than expected , ” said beau@@ do@@ in at a telephone conference , adding that during the service of the aircraft ground tests and software updates were scheduled .
every manufacturer is planning differently .
we decided to take a first flight and then to re@@ new the period , which we have done .
this is done throughout the entire flight programme .
the second of five test aircraft is expected to start in the next few weeks , the remaining shortly there@@ after , it was said by the company side .
yet analy@@ sts remain ske@@ p@@ tical as to whether 12 months after the ma@@ ide@@ n flight , the first customer will be able to start operating a c@@ series aircraft .
bom@@ bar@@ di@@ er said that it would review the planning for the commission@@ ing of the plant ( ice ) and will update it in the coming months .
“ the slow progress of the flight test – even though it seems to have been bom@@ bar@@ di@@ er ’ s internal planning – rein@@ forces our view that the commission@@ ing period should be limited to the first quarter of 20@@ 15 , ” do@@ er@@ sen said .
in the third quarter , with the end of september 30 , bom@@ bar@@ di@@ er ’ s net profit fell to $ 14@@ 7 million , or 8 c@@ ents per share of $ 17@@ 2 million , or 9 c@@ ents per share , in the previous year .
the adjusted ear@@ nings per share is un@@ changed at 9 c@@ ents .
sales were slightly lower and the tur@@ nover fell from 4.@@ 2 to 4.@@ 1 billion dollars .
analy@@ sts had a profit of 10 c@@ ents per share and a tur@@ nover of $ 4.@@ 56 billion , so th@@ om@@ son re@@ u@@ ters i / b / e / s .
the world &apos;s fourth largest aircraft manufacturer says that it has achieved 45 aircraft in this quarter , a drop of 57 in the last year .
net orders fell from 8@@ 3 aircraft to 26 .
the order book in the aero@@ space division was expanded on 30 september 3@@ 2.@@ 9 billion dollars , and was therefore up from 31 december .
“ in the aero@@ space sector , the results were within the limits of our specifications , but the low in@@ take and market conditions as a whole were dis@@ appoin@@ ting , ” said beau@@ do@@ in .
sales in the aero@@ space sector of the aircraft industry fell by 13 percent to two billion dollars .
bom@@ bar@@ di@@ er , the world &apos;s largest rail manufacturer , announced that sales in this sector were up by just under 11 % to $ 2.@@ 1 billion .
the order book in the transport division was 3@@ 2.@@ 6 billion dollars on 30 september , representing a s@@ light increase compared to 31 december .
the profit mar@@ gin in the transport sector was increased by settlement problems in some major contracts .
according to corporate governance , the fourth quarter will have new bench@@ marks .
in the afternoon trading on thursday , the bom@@ bar@@ di@@ er share increased by 8.@@ 5 % and was 4.@@ 8@@ 3 can@@ a@@ dian dollars after the announcement was made that the good@@ will share was up to pat@@ ric@@ k pic@@ ch@@ ette .
the braz@@ ili@@ an em@@ bra@@ er sa , the world &apos;s third largest commercial aircraft manufacturer and bom@@ bar@@ di@@ er &apos;s clo@@ s@@ est ri@@ val , reported a 10 % increase in the quar@@ ter@@ ly profit on thursday .

he was awarded the prize of the li@@ ver@@ pool cro@@ wn court for three years in prison .
a well-known criminal def@@ en@@ der who has accused a drug bar@@ on of a major police investigation because he was afraid of losing his secret drug ad@@ diction .
bas@@ har@@ at d@@ it@@ ta , 42 , supplied sub@@ world size ne@@ il scar@@ bor@@ ough with sensitive information on investig@@ ating the site &apos;s activities in drug trafficking , after being dis@@ solved by his own co@@ ca@@ ine ad@@ diction .
the “ first-@@ class ” approach , p@@ raised by crimin@@ alists as “ first-@@ class ” , with the n@@ ick@@ name “ bas@@ h ” , was arrested in his house in 2011 , after the police had supervis@@ ed scar@@ bor@@ ough , the drug advoc@@ ate in a former drug department .
officials wat@@ ched how scar@@ bor@@ ough ( 32 ) was able to co@@ co@@ ca@@ ine three bags at the att@@ or@@ ney &apos;s house in black@@ bur@@ n , lan@@ cas@@ hire , delivered to them during the meeting with colleagues on a meal of the bar .
the investigations revealed that di@@ tt@@ a regularly uses drugs of class a .
over a period of eight months between january and august 2011 , he tried to dis@@ semin@@ ate un@@ law@@ fully information on the arrest of two men on behalf of scar@@ bor@@ ough and one of his partners .
all four susp@@ ects were then taken over by the police in a major investigation into the her@@ o@@ in and co@@ ca@@ ine trade in lan@@ cas@@ hire , cum@@ bri@@ a , mer@@ se@@ y@@ side , ber@@ k@@ sh@@ ire and west .
together with 32 other people , they were arrested later , after the police had been arrested in a series of house sear@@ ches , her@@ o@@ in and co@@ ca@@ ine worth g@@ b@@ p 1.5 million and g@@ b@@ p 200@@ ,000 in cash .
d@@ it@@ ta , 42 , gave information to the crimin@@ als because he fe@@ ared that his drug ad@@ diction could become public .

the law@@ yer returned home , took his job and took the drugs and then received nine communications between the two .
it was known in court that d@@ it@@ ta was a “ regular consumer ” of co@@ ca@@ ine , after drugs of the class a were found in his hair , his st@@ amp and on his credit cards at tests of class a .
d@@ it@@ ta was later arrested , but with@@ dre@@ w from taking co@@ ca@@ ine and said that he had been working with the alleg@@ ed deal@@ er because he had lost his client , and claimed that he had lost his discussion .
during his arrest , d@@ it@@ ta took his wal@@ let and tried to find a number of credit cards , but they were secured and he was given a sample of the hair .
in police inter@@ ro@@ gation , he stated that he was operating under his private address as well as in the work@@ place , and that clients would be prosecu@@ ting him at home for legal matters .
it was known in court that he was an important drug trad@@ er , some of whom he had previously represented , after significant ar@@ re@@ sts and informed what the results of the investigations were .
prosecu@@ tor anne wh@@ y@@ te said : “ a criminal prosecu@@ tor should be better off than anyone else to know that the law is not broken . ”
d@@ it@@ ta is accused of ab@@ using his position as a criminal def@@ en@@ der , because he is too concerned with certain clients .
the relationship in question is not simply that of a drug deal@@ er , but of a drug deal@@ er who has his law@@ yer with drugs .
part of his communications was undoubtedly legitimate , because he was the advoc@@ ate of these people .
but that went far beyond the limits of a normal relationship between law@@ yer and client .
he was the first to investigate the police , so that they could continue to be subject to criminal activity .
mr d@@ it@@ ta has thus dis@@ credited his profes@@ sion .
he was too close to certain clients , especially scar@@ bor@@ ough , and he made it possible for his independence to be com@@ promised .
d@@ it@@ ta den@@ oun@@ ced any mis@@ conduct and claimed , “ if i was a corru@@ pt law@@ yer , what i am not , and information to scar@@ bor@@ ough would be passed on , then i would not spend 15 hours waiting to do so . ”
but after the hearing , super@@ int@@ ent le@@ e hal@@ ste@@ ad said from the police in lan@@ cas@@ hire : “ mr d@@ it@@ ta took the step from a criminal def@@ en@@ der to a criminal at the moment he started to attack .
his co@@ ca@@ ine dependence led to a ho@@ p@@ eless com@@ promising and made him sus@@ cep@@ tible to the mo@@ tives of leading members of organised crime who entr@@ usted him with providing valuable information on police investigations .
lawyers must have the highest standards of integrity and be able to win public confidence and confidence .
d@@ it@@ ta has lost this trust and has tried to hide behind the fa@@ ç@@ ade of his profes@@ sion .
the serious and organized crime unit of lan@@ cas@@ hire le@@ ver@@ aged the investigation of the dis@@ order of d@@ it@@ ta , which also led to a sentence in three cases for the pos@@ session of co@@ ca@@ ine and dis@@ ability of justice .
this case should be a warning to crimin@@ als and shows that no one is escape the arm of the law .
we find them and bring them to justice .
scar@@ bor@@ ough himself was sent@@ enced to 14 years in prison after he had committed himself to the con@@ spir@@ acy of her@@ o@@ in , co@@ ca@@ ine and can@@ n@@ ab@@ is .
thir@@ ty-@@ five more people involved in the drug trade have been sent@@ enced to overall fin@@ es of 15@@ 3 years for drug off@@ ences .
di@@ tt@@ a published on its website a section with questions and answers about itself , in which he indicated his dream job was to be considered a law@@ yer .
revolutionary work of church music
to finish the celebr@@ ation on the occasion of its 16@@ 0-@@ year anniversary , dun@@ n@@ ingen ’ s song cr@@ ane will perform two services with the &quot; german fair &quot; by fran@@ z sch@@ u@@ bert .
after the great success of the music &quot; rock my life &quot; , which attrac@@ ted the audience this spring , the festival was held in the city of berlin .
on saturday , 26 october , this extraordinary exhibition will be held from 19 during the evening fair at st. mar@@ tin@@ sk@@ ir@@ che dun@@ n@@ ingen and on sunday 27 october , from 10@@ th to 15@@ th at the mass in the church of st. john .
the so-called deutsche mes@@ se with the original title &quot; sing@@ ing for the celebr@@ ation of the holy sacrif@@ ice of the fair &quot; , d 8@@ 72 , is a spiritual music work of the compos@@ er fran@@ z sch@@ u@@ bert from 18@@ 26 .
the fair will be held in the context of the services of god , as the client jo@@ han@@ n phili@@ p@@ p neu@@ mann intended .
under the direction of her@@ mann sch@@ nei@@ der , the cho@@ ir is performed by the group of the br@@ ass band of the musi@@ k@@ vere@@ in fre@@ u@@ den@@ br@@ on@@ n and no@@ em@@ i lo@@ ko@@ di at the or@@ gan .
has@@ l@@ ach : ske@@ p@@ tic@@ ism is increasingly di@@ min@@ ishing confidence .
the par@@ ish church council elections in 20@@ 15 will , for example , bring about a change in the h@@ as@@ l@@ ach ( se ) ministry .
there is only one common par@@ ish council for all six par@@ ish travellers .
at a joint meeting on saturday , the bodies of has@@ l@@ ach , ho@@ f@@ ste@@ t@@ ten , m@@ ü@@ h@@ len@@ bach , fis@@ cher@@ bach , ste@@ in@@ ach and wel@@ sch@@ en@@ stein prepared for the changes .
the fact is that the fundamental decisions of the di@@ oc@@ ese are no longer to be changed and the par@@ ish church counc@@ ils are required to make them as satisfactory as possible .
during the day , it became particularly clear that the s@@ cep@@ tic@@ ism about the new is ten@@ tative , but increasingly ten@@ u@@ ous .
from the ideas and expectations of the innovations in 20@@ 15 to concrete proposals on the future composition and size of the par@@ ish council , the new and extremely constructive discussions of the six bodies were sufficient with the main representatives of the sa@@ e@@ gr@@ e .
regional de@@ an geor@@ g sch@@ mit@@ t explained the new location of the de@@ vised guidelines for se@@ af@@ are@@ rs in the arch@@ di@@ oc@@ ese of fre@@ i@@ burg .
after that , the se has@@ l@@ ach as a par@@ ish of the church will form a public body which will be incorporated into the rights and obligations of the six churches in the past .
there will only be a common par@@ ish council and a foundation council .
from each par@@ ish , at least two elected members should be represented , in the six par@@ ishes are represented loc@@ ally so-called local teams .
their task will be to make church life in the place more visible .
on the question of the finances of the individual par@@ ish , there was a great need for discussion .
the innovations provide that collected data will be used in the par@@ ish and will be used for the purpose .
li@@ abilities , on the other hand , extend to the entire community .
it is precisely in view of the major investments planned , the obligation of which then all par@@ ish people was met , that there was great concern .
&quot; even in the past , only projects that were supported by the individual par@@ ish people were invested .
practical experience with a joint body for five par@@ ish pri@@ ests illustra@@ ted bar@@ bar@@ a rit@@ ter , the chairman of the board in the ministry of waste forest development .
in 2006 , they had set themselves the task of &apos; becoming one , remaining five &apos; and found that it was not so easy .
the bodies of has@@ l@@ ach sou@@ l@@ sor@@ ge then began to ask questions about the future composition and size of the common par@@ ish council and the practical work of the municip@@ al teams .
the papers will be given in further meetings and will be presented at another joint meeting of all six bodies next spring .
in the end , the par@@ ish council michael sch@@ ö@@ ner presented the new logo of the sa@@ il@@ ors &apos; association , which was approved by a clear majority .
in p@@ ful@@ l@@ endor@@ f , the flow of expensive electricity is becoming more expensive .
the citizens of p@@ ful@@ l@@ endor@@ f must adapt to higher electricity costs .
as the managing director of the stad@@ tw@@ er@@ ke , j@@ ör@@ g-@@ ar@@ ne bi@@ as , confirmed to the south cou@@ ri@@ er , a four-@@ head@@ ed pl@@ um@@ bing village family of 70 to 90 euros will inc@@ ur additional costs per year .
the main reason for the upcoming price increase is the rise in the so-called e@@ ec lev@@ y of 5.@@ 27@@ 7 to 6.@@ 3 c@@ ents per kil@@ ow@@ att@@ -@@ hour .
this lev@@ y is paid every october by the four operators of the large electricity routes .
these figures are the figures given to them by the energy change , which they will be able to bear through a charge on the electricity price .
the stad@@ tw@@ er@@ ke p@@ f@@ ul@@ l@@ endor@@ f are the last link in this chain .
the supervisory board of the energy company was even affected by a higher lev@@ y in its forec@@ asts , as j@@ ör@@ g-@@ ar@@ ne bi@@ as reported .
now the actual figures would have to be calculated before the municip@@ al plants next week inform their customers about the exact price increase .
&quot; we are starting from an increase of 1 cent plus x , &quot; says bi@@ as , with the number more near the 2 cent .
traffic lights on permanent red : on waiting time , please keep a close eye on the traffic lights .
sometimes a light is simply not green .
the contact loo@@ p in the street does not react , or the light sign is broken .
what should we do then - drive red ?
if a person concerned has worked long enough at a red light and the crossing is free , he can continue , the stop is explained .
the waiting time must be &apos; appropriate &apos; , which is a matter of different interpretation on a cas@@ e-@@ by-@@ case basis .
bec@@ ker advis@@ es that at least five minutes should be left out before any traffic light distur@@ bs the system .
if you want to continue the journey despite red lights , you have to be aware that it is not responsible for an accident caused by it .
if you are less than five minutes away , you might not wait long enough , war@@ n bec@@ ker and point out a decision of the supreme court ham@@ m .
in the case negotiated , a driver had to carry a permanent red light after about three minutes and had to choose a care@@ less red light b@@ last .
the traffic lights were not def@@ ec@@ tive , but jum@@ ped to green a little later .
he was not allowed to drive because of the special situation - but the fine was not .
the municip@@ al council is pleased with its sound budget and its support for the budget .
whenever there is a community meeting about the budget , civil serv@@ ant r@@ alp@@ h ger@@ ster has good lau@@ ghter .
the municip@@ al bag in her@@ d@@ w@@ ang@@ en-@@ sch@@ ö@@ n@@ n@@ ach is well filled and debt has not been known by the administration since 2005 .
the 2012 financial year can also be seen as a complete success in this respect .
this was confirmed when the annual accounts for 2012 were presented .
as andre@@ a ro@@ th@@ mun@@ d explained , the administrative budget is the largest in the european union , with around eur 7.@@ 6 million .
the administrative budget &apos;s sur@@ plus is also around eur 1.@@ 8 million , which is about eur 1 million above the level of the approach .
the sur@@ plus of the us , especially higher industrial tax revenues , and the municip@@ al share of income tax , is to be o@@ we this sur@@ plus .
the asset budget was also well above the planned values .
instead of the eur 1.5 million that was envis@@ aged , it was eur 2.5 million last year .
&quot; this is mainly due to the higher level of the administrative budget &quot; , says ro@@ th@@ mun@@ d .
since the 2012 financial year saw less investment than planned , it is also necessary to increase the reserve .
overall , the overall reserve was increased by around eur 2.@@ 1 million to a total of eur 4.@@ 9 million .
may@@ or r@@ alp@@ h ger@@ ster than@@ ked ro@@ th@@ mun@@ d and her team for the good work they have done .
&quot; this is a work that you don &apos;t just sha@@ ke out of the sle@@ eve , &quot; ger@@ ster p@@ raised the annual accounts .
he and the local counc@@ ils were obviously pleased with the good figures .
it may sound par@@ ado@@ x@@ ical , but it is these very good figures that could soon cost the public de@@ arly .
the good financial situation has enabled the municip@@ ality to rely on high levels of li@@ abilities .
but this in turn has often caused subsidies to the country , according to ger@@ ster .
the commission has proposed a new budget for these subsidies from various compens@@ atory stic@@ ks .
among other things , the cities and municip@@ alities that apply for subsidies must apply certain le@@ vi@@ es .
&quot; the subject of le@@ verage we have to look at , as in the coming years there will be investment that we would like to have subsidies for , &quot; ger@@ ster announced in this context .
n@@ ag@@ old : hu@@ go wer@@ m@@ ter has been a sing@@ er for 60 years in the cho@@ ir ’ s cho@@ ir at the ch@@ oral music hall of the german cho@@ ir “ hu@@ go wer@@ m@@ ter ” since 60 years .

in addition to the hon@@ or , the 3@@ 1st autumn festival took place in the usual railway tracks : with the m@@ g@@ v be@@ tra , the song ring salz@@ ste@@ t@@ ten , the sing@@ er department ba@@ is@@ ingen and the local music club .
the m@@ g@@ v vol@@ l@@ mar@@ ingen opened its doors with atmo@@ sp@@ her@@ ic songs such as &quot; in the wine paradise &quot; and &quot; fun@@ ny , your bre@@ thre@@ n &quot; .
your hon@@ or@@ ary sing@@ er hu@@ bert wer@@ m@@ ter prepared a small stand for your honour - wol@@ f@@ gan@@ g am@@ ade@@ us moz@@ art &apos;s &quot; bun@@ des@@ lied &quot; .
the male sing@@ ing club be@@ tra san@@ g also classical ch@@ oral songs like &quot; j@@ ä@@ ger@@ wer@@ ben &quot; by ju@@ li@@ us w@@ eng@@ ert , &quot; far , far away &quot; by hu@@ bert go@@ is@@ er@@ n and the fol@@ k song &quot; .
the song ring salz@@ ste@@ t@@ ten caused a lot of emo@@ tion with its mixed cho@@ ir and its women &apos;s group - the imp@@ ul@@ se group - for the women &apos;s quota of the festival .
the mixed cho@@ ir took the ne@@ a@@ polit@@ an fol@@ k song &quot; santa lu@@ cia &quot; and &quot; evi@@ va es@@ pa@@ ñ@@ a &quot; by an@@ tos g@@ us in foreign countries , while the &quot; imp@@ ul@@ se &quot; was also on the island .

ken@@ y@@ an press ou@@ tr@@ aged at controversial media law
“ we are in a fri@@ ghten@@ ing situation and we must ask ourselves : what does parliament think of being simply going to judge the independence of the judici@@ ary tomorrow ? ” , said the newspaper , which is viol@@ ating the draft law .
“ the law is dr@@ ac@@ on@@ ian and very pun@@ ish@@ able , and we reject it , ” said cy@@ r@@ us kam@@ au , managing director of the capital group , to whom capital funds belong .
he said that the new media tri@@ bun@@ al “ is always pre@@ ju@@ dic@@ ed , because it is an extended arm of government , ” and restrictions on content and advertising would be ken@@ ya ’ s position in the global economy .
“ i hope the president list@@ ens to us and we appeal to him to reject this draft law and to return to parliament , ” he said .
according to the star newspaper , the government is taking the media effectively into a str@@ ang@@ le@@ hold by means of the new law , whereas the standard , democracy , and freedom of speech in ken@@ ya would have suffered “ a heavy b@@ low , ” and title .
the adoption of the law is one of a number of measures which will ensure national security in the wake of the attacks by armed islam@@ ists on the west gate shopping m@@ all in september .
the ken@@ y@@ an media have been following the an@@ ger of the authorities for taking photographs of safety cameras that were supposed to be showing how the people who were kid@@ n@@ app@@ ed were supposed to be using the luxury shopping centre .
poli@@ ze@@ ich@@ ef david k@@ im@@ i@@ y@@ o respon@@ ded by or@@ dering two journalists and one leading media representative .
under the new law , media houses can be sold with a penalty of up to 20 million ken@@ y@@ an sch@@ ill@@ ings and individual journalists can be charged with up to one million and the further risk of losing their professional recognition or being taken off from an official press release .
the tri@@ bun@@ al also has the right to decide the pos@@ session of the persons concerned if a penalty is not paid .
according to daily nation , “ one pun@@ ishment can kill most radio stations . ”
in addition , the newspaper believes that these measures could have a dev@@ ast@@ ating effect on what they describe as “ lively blo@@ go@@ sphere ” ken@@ ya .
if you silence the media , you could un@@ le@@ ash politicians with imp@@ unity whatever you want .
“ no one will ever know , ” mu@@ t@@ um@@ a ma@@ thi@@ u , journ@@ alist at the nation , wrote , who has been calling the ken@@ y@@ an media a decisive factor in public control .
“ if politicians are left to themselves , they are leading the country into bank@@ rup@@ t@@ cy and we are back to the hun@@ ters and collec@@ tors ’ era , ” he comm@@ ented .
ken@@ y@@ an legisl@@ ators have already in the past brought public an@@ ger .
in may , they voted to remove the costs imposed by the national compensation commission .
bad@@ -@@ d@@ ür@@ r@@ heim : a dream becomes true for the f@@ c .
the importance for the city and the football club was not over@@ looked by the official in@@ aug@@ ur@@ ation cere@@ mony for the kun@@ str@@ as@@ se sports ground , despite the cold weather and the rain .
a more pleasant celebr@@ ation had taken place last saturday .
so all those who failed to act without a um@@ bre@@ lla or such a plan for any reason could not keep .
this was a great success for the musicians who fr@@ amed the fe@@ ast , as did many speakers .
we@@ t , the f@@ c chairman al@@ bre@@ cht sch@@ len@@ ker , who was convinced of the ful@@ f@@ ill@@ ment of a dream , was also mentioned .
his thanks were primarily due to may@@ or wal@@ ter k@@ lu@@ mp@@ p , who worked for the project to be implemented , the municip@@ al council , the participating companies and associations .

the reti@@ red reti@@ red people moved 400 square meters of pav@@ ing stones for the new paths .
this remarkable volunte@@ er effort also paid tribute to the land@@ tag member kar@@ l ro@@ mb@@ ach .
further words of gre@@ e@@ ting were addressed to the municip@@ al sports committee hu@@ bert ba@@ i@@ er , the district chair of the southern ba@@ den football association , kun@@ o k@@ ay@@ an , and fried@@ rich k@@ nor@@ r from the planning office of the german youth bureau .
may@@ or k@@ lu@@ mp@@ p remin@@ ded us that rec@@ ur@@ ring weather conditions have caused the floo@@ ds in the spring and autumn .
15 years ago , we had the first thoughts on solving the problem , when we were thinking about building a third place at the football club grounds or at the real school on the sal@@ in@@ en@@ see .
both of these have been dis@@ missed .
six years ago , thoughts were put forward about creating an artificial tur@@ f , which is generally regarded as the ultimate solution .
concrete plans were made two years ago when the f@@ c launched the sch@@ ab@@ el@@ stu@@ be in le@@ ase , a cost contribution of eur 100 000 for the construction of the site and the country was funded by eur 10@@ 4 000 .
the local council decided to open the new regional development cooperation agreement in october 2012 .
the construction of the 68 meter 10@@ 8 meter artificial tur@@ f was started on 4 june .
during the three-@@ month construction phase , 3@@ 000 cu@@ b@@ ic meters of ground were de@@ duc@@ ted , half of which was used to build a dir@@ t bike m@@ ile .
the union and the sp@@ d have concluded their coalition negotiations with the issues of internal affairs and justice .

among other things , it is about direct democracy , cong@@ res@@ ses and the federal police .
in the morning , the migration and integration working group also wanted to continue its deliber@@ ations .
among other things , it should be about dual citizenship , which is a subject of mutual understanding between the two sides .
the sp@@ d wants to impose the constra@@ int on immi@@ grant children born in germany to choose one .
on the subject of transport , which is not on the agenda for this friday , the sp@@ d has under@@ lined its rejection of a directive called for by the c@@ su .

according to police figures , a 4@@ 1-@@ year-@@ old from mo@@ squ@@ it@@ oes was on the k@@ emp@@ en@@ er ou@@ ter ring towards green@@ fr@@ ath at about 2@@ 1.@@ 15 p.m.
when the left was moved to st. t@@ ö@@ n@@ is@@ er stra@@ ß@@ e , it over@@ looked the forthcoming 3@@ 7-@@ year-@@ old car .
the travel f@@ ence col@@ li@@ ded .
the a@@ ach@@ en suffered severe in@@ jur@@ ies and had to be brought to the hospital for treatment .
con@@ stan@@ z : loc@@ king after accident at the sch@@ än@@ z@@ le@@ kre@@ is@@ el roun@@ d@@ about .
the accident was reported by the police when a 51 year-@@ old swiss sailing crew was in i@@ bi@@ za on thursday evening .
just before the roun@@ d@@ about at sch@@ än@@ z@@ le he noticed that he was on the left side lan@@ e towards stro@@ me@@ y@@ er@@ s@@ dor@@ f@@ stra@@ ß@@ e and moved on to the right lan@@ e .
this has been combined with the bmw 1 series cou@@ p@@ é , which was driving there .
the damage caused by the bmw wheel was also damaged by the v@@ w pass@@ at of a 19@@ -@@ year-@@ old .
al@@ together , some 15@@ ,000 material damage was caused , the police were involved .
the track had to be closed during the accident , which meant that it was still called .
vienna airport makes passenger calls from the airport .
mr ma@@ i@@ er , please come to gate 24 .
how this will be done in future will be impossible at vienna &apos;s sch@@ w@@ ec@@ hat airport .
most of the lou@@ d@@ speaker fail@@ ures are therefore gone - noise levels should be reduced so much .
a more relaxed atmosphere is the aim of this innovation .
as airport spo@@ kes@@ man peter kle@@ em@@ ann announced to radio wi@@ en , vienna airport is following with the suspension of can@@ cel@@ lations affecting individuals , an international trend .
among other things , airports in copenhagen , frankfurt or du@@ ba@@ i have already abandoned the nois@@ y calls .
the elimin@@ ation of these cuts - on average , at one day , around 200 personal calls from the lou@@ d@@ speakers - is intended to make it qui@@ e@@ ter at the airport in the future .
&quot; it has also been shown in experience that these individual fail@@ ures are relatively little noticed , but at the same time all other information on changed flight paths or departure times has been a little under@@ way here &quot; , says kle@@ em@@ ann in .

a pu@@ red to@@ f@@ u with plant cre@@ am , for example , is a quar@@ tz set .
the vege@@ t@@ arian heritage and the world ve@@ gan day are also mentioned on november 1 .
the vege@@ t@@ arian heritage and germany is proposing a new vege@@ t@@ arian her@@ b for the world ve@@ gan day on november 1 :
pure plant mar@@ gar@@ ine is a good alternative to but@@ ter , yo@@ gh@@ ur@@ t leave through so@@ y@@ a@@ yo@@ gh@@ ur@@ t .
instead of milk , so@@ ya , o@@ y@@ ster , al@@ mon@@ d or rice milk can be used .
infl@@ at@@ able plant cre@@ am substitu@@ tes conventional wh@@ ist@@ le@@ b@@ low@@ ing cre@@ am .
there are also vege@@ table alternatives to e@@ gg@@ s .
half a fr@@ ac@@ tured , ri@@ pe ban@@ ana , for example , can be an eg@@ g as a binding agent in a ca@@ ke .
50 gram@@ s of apple or tab@@ les@@ po@@ on are also used .
the d@@ ough is loo@@ sely packed with eg@@ g , for example , with a mix@@ ture of a tea spo@@ on of ba@@ king pow@@ der , a tab@@ les@@ po@@ on of food strength and three tab@@ les@@ po@@ ons of min@@ eral water .
but 50 gram@@ s of so@@ ja@@ yo@@ gh@@ ur@@ t or sil@@ k to@@ f@@ u can also do this .
according to ve@@ b@@ u , there are currently around 800 000 ve@@ gan di@@ ets in germany , which is purely vege@@ table .
sle@@ e@@ pl@@ ess in new york
on the way to their host families in we@@ y@@ mouth , mass@@ ach@@ us@@ et@@ ts , the students of the black forest school learned to live the american great city of new york .
after eight hours of flight , we went straight to bro@@ ok@@ ly@@ n bridge , which was the heart of the city , man@@ h@@ att@@ an , on foot .
there was already a fascinating view of the world famous sky@@ line , which was built in the evening light and which attrac@@ ted a special attr@@ action .
the time shift has meant that students have been on their feet for almost 24 hours , but in true terms to the mo@@ tto &quot; the city does not sleep &quot; , the day was decided on at times square .
despite shut@@ down , the release of the stat@@ ue of liber@@ ty was reached on the second day by a fer@@ ry and clim@@ bed on foot .
then there was the financial center around wall street , where the 11@@ th september mem@@ orial was held .
on the third day , the students were able to watch the 3@@ 73 meters high observation platform of the emp@@ ire@@ -@@ state building .
after that , the rus@@ h of new york ’ s streets went over the ro@@ c@@ ke@@ f@@ ell@@ er center to central park , which was an ideal opportunity to stay for a while in the autumn sun .
after a short flight from new york to bo@@ ston , students have now arrived in their host families and are living at the we@@ y@@ mouth high school .
this year , the new year ’ s nam@@ ing day of the holy hu@@ ber@@ tus will be held in the par@@ ish church of st. mari@@ en on h@@ ü@@ ls@@ ber@@ g@@ stra@@ ß@@ e .
st. hu@@ ber@@ tus was a pretty ru@@ th@@ less hun@@ ter , who was forced to live in a new state of affairs by a vision and later became the bis@@ hop of li@@ è@@ ge .

the leaves wear riding clothes because they are mainly ri@@ ders , horses and dogs .
the f@@ es@@ tive fair takes place on sunday , november 3rd , at 11.@@ 30 a.m.
the newly designed op@@ sch@@ la@@ g features a new caf@@ e .
one that is suitable for a stay and to come back .
one that makes the name a program .
when dé@@ j@@ à v@@ u is called a psycho@@ log@@ ist phenomenon , it is the term that refers to the feeling that a new situation has already been experienced or seen .
in the case of the visit of the café of the same name at the op@@ sch@@ la@@ g in the district town of kle@@ ve in sight of the rhe@@ in-@@ wa@@ al university , it does not have to remain a mere feeling of dé@@ j@@ à v@@ u .
finally , the café has the very purpose of this name : not only to make a real stay , but also to keep it alive , and to make it a real experience .
because it &apos;s fun and simply beautiful .
a look into the inner life at op@@ sch@@ la@@ g 8 gives the vie@@ wer a good feeling at first .
the state-of-the-art , but not cool , café ambi@@ ence looks like a place to feel good .
here the team spo@@ ils with the foun@@ ders mir@@ j@@ am van der ste@@ lt and dani@@ el b@@ ü@@ tt@@ ner at the top with various coffee and tea specialities .
there are delicious ca@@ kes or individually coo@@ ked fresh bag@@ u@@ et@@ tes .
the owners , both 33 years old , have already registered themselves before the opening of the beautiful caf@@ e at the op@@ sch@@ la@@ g as a gastronom@@ ic : in k@@ ran@@ enburg they performed the &quot; art lounge &quot; .
from moving to kle@@ ve to op@@ sch@@ la@@ g , the friendly caf@@ é@@ -@@ lovers hope to attract more audience .
the university of applied sciences is also the main focus of the project .
&quot; we don &apos;t have a specific target group , &quot; says dani@@ el b@@ ü@@ tt@@ ner .
rather , the two here young students want to address themselves in the same way as senior citizens and all ages in between .
speaking of caf@@ e lovers .
the friendly owner couple is behind the coffee house .
enjoy the sm@@ ell of hot bro@@ wn@@ s in a variety of vari@@ ations .
expres@@ so
dani@@ el b@@ ü@@ tt@@ ner is more the expres@@ so fan and mir@@ j@@ am van der ste@@ ll@@ t the cap@@ pu@@ c@@ c@@ ino drin@@ ker .
&quot; in addition , a bag@@ u@@ ette - that is my thing &quot; , reve@@ als it to the no@@ d .
two events were also held in the bright café .
better said one .
the port festival took place outside - the café dé@@ j@@ à v@@ u pro@@ fi@@ ted from it .
but there was also the r@@ ing@@ el@@ nat@@ z@@ evening .
&quot; beautiful , successful and fun@@ ny &quot; , the two 3@@ 3-@@ year-@@ ol@@ ds found .
but it is not everyone &apos;s business .
perhaps dani@@ el b@@ ü@@ tt@@ ner is not a big fan of event@@ -@@ ab@@ end@@ as : &quot; you can &apos;t do it now !
and with an event i always speak only to those who are also interested in the special event .
therefore , events will be the exception .
&quot; we want to keep the normal operation as little as possible &quot; .
should it be said : dé@@ j@@ à v@@ u also stands for reliability .
as regards the quality of the products offered here , as well as the team and the beautiful surroundings at the op@@ sch@@ la@@ g in kle@@ ve .
the road that is becoming more and more a gastronom@@ ic m@@ ile .
to the deli@@ ght of many kle@@ ver , the guests from near and far and the students who want to visit the restaurant and hence the café dé@@ j@@ à v@@ u for themselves .
an@@ ke g@@ ell@@ ert hel@@ pen@@ stein
a day of thanks at the m@@ g@@ v in din@@ ker .
it was the 16@@ 5th anniversary of the foundation of the &quot; fried@@ rich wil@@ hel@@ m d@@ in@@ ker &quot; m@@ g@@ v , which was held this year and attrac@@ ted 52 guests , active sing@@ ers and their wi@@ ves .
the restaurant is located in the club lounge of wit@@ te@@ bor@@ g in din@@ ker , and all of them enjoyed the harmon@@ ious co@@ existence in the name of music .
tradi@@ tionally , the foundation festival is also the right festival to be hon@@ oured .
the special award &quot; sing@@ er of the year &quot; was a great pleasure for ro@@ l@@ f wag@@ en@@ er this time .
&quot; you have not only written a lot for us , but also have had some roun@@ ds for us , and we thank you very much for that , &quot; says the chairman of the cho@@ ir er@@ ich sch@@ lo@@ t@@ mann .
the awards for participation in the performances and cho@@ ir sam@@ ples by means of activity programmes are received in this year .
the first time in the world , the world cup was held in the united states .
a particularly than@@ k@@ ful note was sent by the board to the team of ve@@ rein@@ sw@@ ir@@ tin ange ange pi@@ er-@@ ri@@ b@@ bert , who once again had enchan@@ ted a menu of extra class and sent to ger@@ da pi@@ er-@@ ri@@ b@@ bert for table decor@@ ation .
the m@@ g@@ v &quot; fried@@ rich@@ -@@ wil@@ hel@@ m &quot; meets on its regular ch@@ oral sam@@ ples every tuesday at 19@@ .@@ 45 in the association hall .
&quot; new s@@ oun@@ ding vo@@ ices are welcome at any time &quot; , sch@@ lo@@ t@@ mann said .
un announ@@ ces new objectives in the fight against poverty .
the united nations is starting to draw up a series of new objectives , which will be able to achieve the millennium development goals announced 12 years ago to combat poverty .
in the run@@ -up to the un summit on sustainable development , which was held in rio de jan@@ e@@ iro in the evening , austr@@ ali@@ an diplom@@ ats played a key role in pus@@ hing for “ sustainable development goals ” that will end the millennium goals in 20@@ 15 .
they were included in the final draft of the document prepared by world leaders , including mrs g@@ ill@@ ard , at the summit .
un secre@@ tar@@ y-@@ general ban ki@@ -@@ moon said in the evening at the summit that the time has come to think “ beyond national interests . ”
“ i am pleased that the member states have agreed to adopt a process that will enable us to achieve universal standards of sustainable development .
“ these goals are based on our progress in the millennium development goals and will form an integral part of the framework for the post-@@ 2012 development .
i will spare no effort to make this proposal , which i have been given by the member states , a reality to support our vision of sustainable development objectives , which are based on the success of the millennium goals . ”
even though s@@ g achi@@ m / ba@@ den has been without victory for four days , the hand@@ ball upper league continues to be in good mo@@ od .
this is where the co@@ ach tom@@ as@@ z mal@@ mon leaves no doubt about this .
all of them are still fully motivated .
however , i hope that we will finally win again .
&quot; i don &apos;t know how to make a victory any@@ more &quot; , says mal@@ m@@ on , a successful candidate for the european union &apos;s team in the v@@ f@@ l fre@@ den@@ bec@@ k ii .
even though the third lig@@ a reserve of fre@@ den@@ bec@@ k is not currently producing trees , it is still a fact that mal@@ mon is raising warning be@@ fore@@ hand about the poin@@ ting fing@@ er .
i have a lot of players i have trained in a youth .
they will therefore vote against their ex@@ -@@ co@@ ach in particular .
&quot; it is also important to see whether there is any strengthening from the first one , &quot; the s@@ g-@@ co@@ ach illustra@@ tes .
in order to finally return to the m@@ ire of success , the mal@@ mon team must be very careful in comparison with previous performances .
above all , in the area of cover work and swit@@ ching , the last thing that happened was enormous .
the exploitation of opportunities must also definitely be improved .
i hope that my players will be able to keep their heads free during the short break .
security concerns in moz@@ ambi@@ que are growing in the face of cl@@ ash@@ es between influ@@ ential figures and political leaders .
thousands of people gathered in the centre of ma@@ pu@@ to under the wat@@ ch@@ ful eyes of the stat@@ ue of sam@@ ora mach@@ el , the founder and first president of moz@@ ambi@@ que , to speak with one voice in a rare public demonstration .
“ we want peace again , we want stability , ” said van@@ ess@@ a de s@@ ous@@ a , managing director of an investment company .
fe@@ ar@@ ful of the country ’ s future , she has ti@@ ed her business clothes against a t-@@ shir@@ t with the label “ we demand safety ” in portuguese and joined the crow@@ d on thursday on the independence square of the capital .
for two weeks now , there have been almost daily reports of cl@@ ash@@ es between government forces and ren@@ am@@ o , which have been one of the worst batt@@ les since the peace agreement more than 20 years ago .
ren@@ am@@ o was once a not@@ ori@@ ous re@@ bel movement , initially led by white rul@@ ers of r@@ ho@@ desi@@ a and later by apar@@ the@@ id government in south africa .
after the 1992 peace treaty , it became an opposition party .
analy@@ sts think it unlikely that the country will return to a full-@@ blo@@ wn conflict , but the recent events have left foreign investors and domestic residents wor@@ ried .
for the rapidly growing economy , there is a lot at stake , because the discovery of huge gas depos@@ its off the coast and coal depos@@ its in the nor@@ th@@ west could lead to investment of more than $ 50 billion from companies like rio t@@ into .
the ruling fre@@ li@@ mo@@ -@@ party , since 197@@ 5 the dominant force , and ren@@ am@@ o are giving each other the blame for ten@@ sions .
ren@@ am@@ o claims that the government has pro@@ vo@@ ked recent cl@@ ash@@ es by sending its members to the province of so@@ fal@@ a , a traditional strong@@ hold of ren@@ am@@ os , on 17 october .
the attacks on the former re@@ be@@ ls es@@ cal@@ ated as government troops ren@@ am@@ o bases , and the attacks on the former re@@ be@@ ls es@@ cal@@ ated .
the government bl@@ ames ren@@ am@@ o for the cl@@ ash@@ es and acc@@ uses the organization of att@@ acking soldiers .
president ar@@ man@@ do gu@@ e@@ bu@@ za has tried to reduce concerns about inst@@ ability .
compared to af@@ p , the french news agency , he said on wednesday that dh@@ la@@ k@@ ama is a “ lo@@ ser . ”
both fre@@ lim@@ o and ren@@ am@@ o empha@@ size that they want to avoid war .
but concerns have increased since ma@@ z@@ ang@@ a began to quote words that ren@@ am@@ o was not the peace agreement of 1992 .
in order to achieve this , he said to the ft that fre@@ li@@ mo had no longer respected the agreement .
“ our vision is to re@@ start negotiations , and to do so seriously , ” said ma@@ z@@ ang@@ a .
earlier discussions between the parties have done little to resolve the ten@@ sions caused by a series of cl@@ ash@@ es this year .
“ we have two adult men ( gu@@ e@@ bu@@ za and dh@@ la@@ k@@ ama ) here who have gathered together the heads , ” says joseph sm@@ ith han@@ l@@ on , do@@ z@@ ent at the open university and mo@@ sam@@ bi@@ k university .
none of them are good negoti@@ ators and none are prepared to make the necessary conc@@ essions .
ren@@ am@@ o , who is pressing for electoral reforms , has already stated that it will bo@@ y@@ cot@@ t the november local elections .
presidential and parliamentary elections are scheduled for next year .
some comm@@ ent@@ ators have mentioned the use of force as an attempt by a ail@@ ing movement to make conc@@ essions and financial conc@@ essions from the government .
ren@@ am@@ os electoral success has been shr@@ in@@ king since 1992 , while a ne@@ wer party , led by a former ren@@ am@@ o member , has been a party that has been running the democratic movement of mo@@ ç@@ ambi@@ que ( m@@ d@@ m ) .
ma@@ z@@ ang@@ a claims that gu@@ e@@ bu@@ za – the re@@ sign@@ ation of his second term in office ends next year – is the destruction of the country ’ s democracy .
“ he does not want a multi-@@ party democracy , he does not want transparent elections , he does not want peace , because he does not want to give up the presidency , ” ma@@ z@@ ang@@ a says .
it is un@@ clear what capacity ren@@ am@@ o has , but it has caused an@@ xi@@ ety attacks on police stations and vehicles on an important north-@@ south link .
most of the batt@@ les took place in the province of s@@ of@@ ala , which was a few hundred kilometres north of ma@@ pu@@ to , but which is located in be@@ ira , the port , the mining companies such as rio t@@ into and v@@ vi .
in june rio inter@@ rup@@ ted the use of the railways for a month after ren@@ am@@ o launched an attack on the track .
ma@@ z@@ ang@@ a respon@@ ded cau@@ ti@@ ously to the question of whether ren@@ am@@ o would repeat this threat .
ren@@ am@@ o wanted to war@@ n the international community that things are going wrong in moz@@ ambi@@ que , ” said ma@@ z@@ ang@@ a .
inst@@ ability has fu@@ elled fru@@ stration with the government , says fer@@ nan@@ do li@@ ma , head of medi@@ a@@ coo@@ p , a independent media company , because many people are an@@ x@@ ious about the corruption that has occurred .
“ people think that the government and the president are crucial to the country ’ s future and that he should be the one who can find solutions to the problems , ” he explains .
om@@ ar sul@@ t@@ ane , a demonstr@@ ator , said that people simply wanted stability .
“ no one is interested in ren@@ am@@ o and fre@@ li@@ mo , they simply want to re@@ build peace and us@@ able streets , ” he said .
children should learn my@@ ths and leg@@ ends as “ models for life . ” they say , “ an author .
the stories of th@@ or showed that “ brut@@ al force has no chance of defe@@ ating cle@@ ver tr@@ ic@@ ks , ” and the ar@@ tus leg@@ end demonstrates how important it is to have a dream .
many of the my@@ ths , however , are “ far too wild , too off@@ ensive , and in some cases too dir@@ ty to be taught in schools . ”
“ i find it wonderful that in america my@@ ths and fol@@ kl@@ ore are already part of education , ” he said .
i have been calling for this as a plan for twenty years .
he added that the authors and teachers who “ know too di@@ d@@ ac@@ tically ” are not interested in children being “ completely dis@@ connected , ” because in enter@@ taining stories , the bot@@ tle of “ under@@ sco@@ red ” would be conve@@ yed .
cros@@ s@@ ley hol@@ land , the be@@ ow@@ ul@@ f from the ang@@ lo@@ -@@ sa@@ x@@ on language and author of the pen@@ gu@@ in book of northern my@@ ths and the british fol@@ k tal@@ es is , explained : “ you can &apos;t do it .
perhaps the biggest difference between an adult author writing for adults and a writer who is responsible for children is that he is not a child .
not everything needs to be simplified or lead to the happy end , but there is an im@@ man@@ ent sense of good and evil .
this must be under@@ min@@ ed , through history revealed , and not explained .
this is the old story of showing rather than telling .
han@@ s@@ j@@ ak@@ o@@ b is once again attrac@@ ting fre@@ i@@ burg to the city .
100 years ago , he@@ in@@ rich han@@ s@@ j@@ ak@@ o@@ b re@@ signed from his old age reti@@ rement in has@@ l@@ ach , and his last years were made alive on sunday in the &quot; fre@@ i@@ hof &quot; .
the many spec@@ t@@ ators were impres@@ sed by the extremely enter@@ taining scene game .
from the arrival to the award of hon@@ or@@ ary citizenship to his death , scre@@ en@@ writer and han@@ s@@ j@@ ak@@ ob@@ dar@@ ste@@ ller alo@@ is kra@@ f@@ tz@@ cy@@ k had an enter@@ taining piece of work that was under the direction of cor@@ r@@ lia .
mar@@ c@@ us z@@ ag@@ er@@ mann took the audience with him as a spo@@ kes@@ man through the ten different scenes , explained contex@@ ts and brid@@ ged periods of time from the youth to the appro@@ aching reti@@ rement .
on october 22 , 19@@ 13 han@@ s@@ j@@ ak@@ o@@ b heim comes into his children &apos;s sky , in his open yard .
and then the scene game began , in which alo@@ is kra@@ f@@ cz@@ y@@ k once again appeared in his par@@ ad@@ er@@ ol@@ l as the great son of the city .
he dro@@ ve with the two-@@ s@@ oun@@ der and &quot; black forest fo@@ xes &quot; by er@@ ich bec@@ he@@ rer from m@@ ü@@ h@@ len@@ bach .
it was not only heard by the audience with much applause , but also his si@@ ster phili@@ pp@@ ine welcomed him .
bil@@ ly sum@@ mann understood it incredi@@ bly well to be in the role of the si@@ ster .
between the scenes of the game , the m@@ ill farmers &apos; band played selected music and run@@ ded the stage in the final .
the award of the hon@@ or@@ ary citizen was then given to has@@ l@@ ach &apos;s may@@ or he@@ in@@ z win@@ k@@ ler , who was elected to represent the then inc@@ um@@ b@@ ent h@@ ä@@ t@@ ti@@ ch together with a part of the city council .
their maintenance subsequently made the tri@@ -@@ king sing@@ ers , han@@ s@@ j@@ ak@@ o@@ b the proc@@ lam@@ ation : &quot; o@@ h how beautiful , there are again youth in@@ jur@@ ies to my own three king time .
with her song &quot; o jes@@ u@@ le@@ in &quot; they enjoyed the audience in the fre@@ i@@ hof as well as the stor@@ k ag@@ e-@@ kids with their l@@ oud &quot; out , out &quot; .
his criticism of the church of the as@@ sumption was also expressed at the time by han@@ s@@ j@@ ak@@ o@@ b , as was his concern about the exc@@ esses of agriculture , the consequences of industri@@ alization or the effects of war .
in the home garden , behind its tom@@ b cha@@ pel on fire near ho@@ f@@ ste@@ t@@ ten , he found his reti@@ rement .
&quot; a re@@ st@@ less spirit had finally found its peace and had gone home fore@@ ver , &quot; he said at the end of the scene game .
many applause and many lau@@ dable words were heard from the audience for the performance .

&quot; we will not be participating in the wil@@ d@@ card process , &quot; said former national player pas@@ cal roll@@ er , who has been developing the concept for a professional club in han@@ se@@ atic city since 2012 .
a first bre@@ a@@ thing was in lu@@ d@@ wi@@ gs@@ burg , however , not to be heard .

ha@@ i@@ ger@@ lo@@ ch : evening meal church is moving into focus .
as a contribution to the 15@@ 0-@@ year old existence of the prote@@ stant church in ha@@ i@@ ger@@ lo@@ ch , the cultural and tourism office of the city dedic@@ ates the last of its public guided tours on sunday , 27 october , the evening meal .
after visiting the atom@@ ic cel@@ lar museum , the ha@@ i@@ ger@@ lo@@ cher period after 18@@ 50 is to be considered as a ha@@ i@@ ger@@ lo@@ ch under pr@@ us@@ sian rule .
the crow@@ ning conclusion is a visit to the evening meal kitchen .
the leaders of the region will learn the history of the construction of the church and gain insight into the development of the prote@@ stant church in a thoroughly catho@@ lic church .
last but not least , the view of the church of the church , which was built by fried@@ rich sch@@ ü@@ z with the support of wal@@ ter kr@@ ö@@ ll and geor@@ g hal@@ brit@@ ter , also stands out .
it is a genuine re@@ plic@@ a of the famous milan model .

snow@@ den could also be heard in russia
the former us intelligence expert ed@@ ward snow@@ den has the potential to be the most effective in the us later aff@@ air , including in his russian asylum .
representatives of the federal public prosecu@@ tor ’ s office could either ask questions in writing or meet the 30@@ -@@ year-@@ old personally in russia .
this was reported by the agency inter@@ fax on the basis of un@@ named cir@@ cles , which are familiar with the situation .
such an issue could be resolved intergovernmental , but it was said .
a trip to russia from snow@@ den is virtually impossible .
&quot; in this case , he lo@@ ses his refugee status , &quot; the agency quo@@ ted its source .
because germany is an ally of the united states , snow@@ den is threat@@ ening to be ex@@ tradi@@ ted there , it was still said to be the case .

&quot; the signals serve safety and are required by law , &quot; says mat@@ thi@@ as sch@@ re@@ ll , managing director of r@@ hen@@ us mid@@ gar@@ d in wil@@ hel@@ m@@ sha@@ ven .
if you are not in a good position , you can hear it from the outside - and there have already been some complaints from people from the north .
he takes the complaints very seriously and therefore has cont@@ acted the people concerned , says the 4@@ 0-@@ year-@@ old .
in close consultation with the authorities , we are now in the process of providing the warning signals with technical measures with a s@@ light improvement .
he will continue to rely on open dialogue with his neighbours .
mat@@ thi@@ as sch@@ re@@ ll has a lot to do before the site .
the expansion of the lower sa@@ x@@ ony bridge is the start of r@@ hen@@ us mid@@ g@@ ard &apos;s continued commitment to the coal import of power plants and is one of the major companies in europe in this sector .
the new m@@ t@@ b 4@@ 50 is available in two different sizes , with a length of 18@@ ,@@ 5 meters .
&quot; this year we want to use the 3 million ton@@ ne brand k@@ n@@ it in the en@@ velo@@ pe &quot; , says sch@@ re@@ ll .
in addition to the e@@ on power plant on the ground , the import coal goes to power plants in the in@@ land .
if you add the g@@ d@@ f-@@ su@@ e@@ z power station to the network , a good 5 million tonnes of coal imports per year are realistic .
the three ship lo@@ ad@@ ers on the bridge and the second transport bel@@ t could create up to 10 million .
bav@@ aria ’ s bas@@ ket@@ b@@ all@@ er , despite first defe@@ at , is optim@@ istic about his defe@@ at .
even the first defe@@ at in the euro@@ league was won by the bas@@ ket@@ ball players of the f@@ c bay@@ er@@ n munich , and the euro league was not able to di@@ min@@ ish the enormous optim@@ ism .
&quot; no one can for@@ bid us to believe that even against the best team in europe in the last two years , &quot; bay@@ er@@ n co@@ ach s@@ ve@@ tis@@ la@@ v pe@@ sic , after the unfortunate 8@@ 3 : 8@@ 3 .
we have sent the message : there is also a bas@@ ket@@ ball in munich !
in her first appearance in the european royal class , the munich re group sold very well for a long time , but were not able to complete the decisive ph@@ ases .
the guests first made the art of creating a 15@@ -@@ point back@@ log 13 minutes before the end of the tour , before pi@@ ra@@ eu@@ s joined the game again .
&quot; we have fought incredi@@ bly hard against the two-@@ time euro@@ league champi@@ on , who has been playing the s@@ lot again .
we are proud of our performance , but we want to win every game .
mal@@ col@@ m de@@ lan@@ ey and ni@@ had d@@ je@@ do@@ vic were the most successful shi@@ py@@ ards of munich , who were the first to fight the italian ser@@ ial champi@@ on mon@@ te@@ pas@@ chi si@@ ena and the polish ti@@ tel@@ le .
ben green@@ man : ten years new york com@@ edy festival : the new yor@@ ker festival : the new york com@@ edy festival : the new yor@@ ker
one could say that new york city was the birth@@ place of stand@@ -up com@@ edy in america : a few hundred years ago , the vari@@ eg@@ ated artist fran@@ k fa@@ y began to work as a conf@@ é@@ ren@@ ci@@ er in the palace .
over the years , f@@ ay &apos;s innovation has been developed , as was the case at the new york com@@ edy festival .
founded and directed by car@@ ol@@ ine h@@ ir@@ sch , founder of the stand@@ -up institution car@@ ol@@ ines , fe@@ i@@ er@@ te is celebr@@ ating its 10@@ th anniversary this year .
“ most of these head@@ lin@@ ers began to work with car@@ ol@@ ines and became more and more successful until they eventually became known to be in a club . ” he said .
we have designed this festival so that we can continue working with you .
this year &apos;s event will be accompanied by performances by w@@ anda sy@@ kes , ka@@ thy gri@@ ff@@ in and bill ma@@ her , as well as by the stand up for her@@ oes , an annual music and com@@ edy show .
the festival also brings the world of com@@ edy to life .
a number of the com@@ edi@@ ans who will be atten@@ ding the festival this year are known about un@@ conventional ways , such as broad@@ ca@@ sts on smaller television channels such as com@@ edy central , f@@ x and spi@@ ke .
n@@ ick k@@ roll was awarded a sit@@ com on cable television ( the ir@@ on@@ ic@@ -@@ key@@ p@@ added fant@@ as@@ y football series “ the leader ” ) on f@@ x@@ x .
jen@@ ny s@@ late was a member of the “ saturday night live ” and of “ parks and recre@@ ation ” .
both k@@ roll and s@@ late and other young com@@ edi@@ ans with characteristic vo@@ ices ( the sur@@ real pes@@ si@@ mis@@ tic an@@ th@@ ony jes@@ el@@ nik , the ir@@ onic , on r@@ aci@@ al issues ) .
the biggest visitors to the festival include a interactive exhibition : david ste@@ in@@ berg talks with lar@@ ry david .
ste@@ in@@ berg started as a stand@@ -up com@@ edi@@ an , but has become a respected television and film director and a leading producer of com@@ edy films .
from 2005 to 2007 he moder@@ ated a television program entitled “ sit down co@@ ok ” with david ste@@ in@@ berg at tv land .
the meeting will take place in the town hall in the middle of man@@ h@@ att@@ an .
“ the city is definitely in the com@@ edy d@@ na of lar@@ ry ’ s total work , ” said ste@@ in@@ berg .
he told me when he is here , then he sometimes goes through the street between two buildings and thin@@ ks : he@@ y , if i have all my money , then empty the house .
iran happy with the nuclear negotiations
iran is showing itself one week before the next nuclear meeting with the five un ve@@ to@@ es and germany is satisfied with the negotiating process .
&quot; after years , an agreement has been reached with the international atom@@ ic energy agency to resolve the differences of the last few years , &quot; said foreign minister mo@@ ham@@ med j@@ awa@@ d sh@@ ari@@ f .
it would be a long way off , but the nuclear negoti@@ ator was not satisfied with the negotiating process and is also optim@@ istic that both sides would eventually come to a solution .
dr@@ ama in ur@@ u@@ gu@@ ay : young kill play@@ cham@@ bers with mac@@ he@@ te and the other children .
two children have died in ur@@ u@@ gu@@ ay from the murder of a 1@@ 1-@@ year-@@ old .
the two 14 and 12 year-@@ old bo@@ ys invited their victim to come to the camp with them .
with mac@@ he@@ tes and k@@ ni@@ ves , they inv@@ ade the 11@@ th anniversary of the battle on tuesday and thre@@ w the cor@@ pse into a well , reporting the newspaper &quot; el pa@@ í@@ s &quot; on thursday .
they should have been able to walk football in front of their homes in a work@@ ing-@@ class district .
the cor@@ pse was thro@@ wn into the village of cer@@ ro pel@@ ado , 15 kilometres north of the exclusive resort of cer@@ ro pel@@ ado , 15 kilometres north of the beach .
as an ali@@ bi , a fi@@ ve-@@ year half-@@ si@@ ster of the younger one , who took her with her , should say that she was sex@@ ually att@@ acked by the young .
but when the girl was be@@ aten up in front of the police without men@@ tioning an attack on her , the two bo@@ ys gave the deliber@@ ate killing of the 1@@ 1-@@ year-@@ old .
the older man , among other reasons , called a ri@@ val@@ ry in football .
it was provi@@ sion@@ ally converted into a psy@@ chi@@ at@@ ric youth institution .
p@@ im@@ ps must be put in prison
because of explo@@ it@@ ative human trafficking , p@@ im@@ ps , threats , insul@@ ts and dangerous bo@@ d@@ ily in@@ jury , the district court of kon@@ stan@@ z has sent@@ enced a 3@@ 3-@@ year-@@ old man from st. geor@@ gen to three and a half years in prison .
the former german armed soldi@@ er who was killed after two operations in afghanistan was still in prison as part of a process agreement .
so in five cases he has informed women about internet or telephone contacts , who he has had to fight against their will in the end after a few weeks .
he used force and threats to break resistance .
the income of women who have been ear@@ ning money for some years for him has been maintained .
conf@@ is@@ c@@ ation of mobile phones and si@@ m cards under@@ cut female contacts to the outside world .
together with a colleague who sent women , he brought them to various bor@@ der@@ s. in the south-@@ west , he was a member of the committee on women &apos;s rights and equal opportunities .
there he had some monitoring of them to control their revenue .
the accused claimed in court that he was suffering from a severe tra@@ um@@ a after colleagues in afghanistan had been killed beside him in an explo@@ sion .
after a psy@@ chi@@ at@@ ric expert had serious doubts about the mental constra@@ int and thus about a limited liability , he was able to find out that the 3@@ 3-@@ year-@@ old had made a comprehensive conf@@ ession .
the court did not have to hear any of the women who were in@@ ju@@ red .
as a cri@@ po official reported , after a first ad by telephone surveillance agencies , at least four more cases of explo@@ it@@ ative trafficking were recorded .
the ta@@ pped talks were of great aggres@@ sion .
in subsequent inter@@ ro@@ g@@ ations , the in@@ ju@@ red parties would have confirmed their mar@@ ty@@ r@@ dom .
another witness in which one of the women in the whole body has discovered blue spots has still not heard a statement .
it is a &apos; totally broken person@@ ality &apos; , which is a crime against violence and exploitation in this animal as normal .
the accused regre@@ t@@ ted his behaviour yesterday .
&quot; he has been dis@@ solved from these cir@@ cles and wants to be a normal life after imprison@@ ment , &quot; he said .
oil prices continue to drop to $ 96 per bar@@ re@@ l .
the price of oil continued to fall on friday , after wor@@ ries about a high supply over@@ sh@@ ad@@ ow@@ ed a report that says that china ’ s ener@@ g@@ y-@@ hun@@ gr@@ y manufacturing sector is growing .
the reference cru@@ de oil variety for deli@@ veries in december was in europe in the late morning in electronic trading at the new york mer@@ can@@ tile exchange at 14 c@@ ents on 9@@ 6.@@ 24 usd .
the contract fell by 39 c@@ ents on thursday , causing a price drop of 5.@@ 8 percent in october .
the large supply of cru@@ de oil has increased prices in recent weeks .
the us department of energy stated on wednesday that the us supply rose by 4.@@ 1 million bar@@ re@@ ls last week .
over the course of five weeks , the offer has ris@@ en by 25 million bar@@ re@@ ls .
but on friday there was evidence of greater demand through two reports of an increase in activity in chinese manufacturing .
this suggests a continued recovery in china ’ s economy , whose growth is expected to be 7.@@ 8 % in the third quarter , after the previous year ’ s growth in the lowest level since two decades .

court blocks decision to stop and fr@@ is@@ k the n@@ y@@ p@@ d &apos;s directive .
a federal appe@@ als court in the united states bloc@@ ked the order of a judge to make changes to the stop order on thursday .
the 2nd us court of appeal stated that the decisions of judge sh@@ ira sch@@ al@@ d@@ lin were suspended until a court of appeal had been made .
the judge ordered the death sentence in august , but the city was not allowed to do so by the way the programme for the an@@ hal@@ ting and ques@@ tioning of persons was implemented .
the city appe@@ aled against its assessment and the ordered re@@ medi@@ es , including the decision to establish a supervisory authority .
the court of appeal heard the arguments on tuesday about the request for suspension .
the appeal report stated that judge j@@ im@@ my was to be exemp@@ t from the case because she had not adopted the code of conduct for us jud@@ ges , speci@@ fying that a judge would appear to be par@@ tis@@ an ;
the judge had jud@@ ged that police officers were in@@ ju@@ red in the civil rights of tens of thousands of people because they were in@@ appropri@@ ately targeted at black and latin american men with the stop call .
she appointed an external monitoring body to monitor the implementation of major changes , including reforms of directives , training and service supervision , and ordered a pilot programme with the body to be carried cameras .
in august , new york city agreed to re@@ consider the practice of stor@@ ing names and addresses of people who were seeking control by the police .
an oral hearing on the voc@@ ation of the city is scheduled after 14 march 20@@ 14 .
the stop and fr@@ is@@ k tac@@ tic has been adopted by a number of civil rights def@@ enders .
such controls have been in place for decades in various forms , but the number of checks recorded during the term of office of the bi@@ ased may@@ or michael blo@@ om@@ berg rose to an all-@@ time high of 6@@ 8@@ 4.@@ 3@@ 30 in 2011 , most of which was in 2011 ,
in 2004 , four men from all minorities were brought to the court , who committed themselves to a collective action .
ad@@ voca@@ tes of changes to the stop and fr@@ is@@ k program say that the changes will be unfair , and that the change will lead to a more tru@@ st@@ worthy and effective police force , as well as influence the way other police officers are treated .
oppon@@ ents believe that the changes would undermine the police ’ s mor@@ ality , but not crimin@@ ality ; nor would money be was@@ ted and the broader problem of a police force that is forced to take over after thousands of jobs have been dro@@ pped over the last decade .
the judge pointed out that she had failed to complete the stop and hair@@ dres@@ sing practice .
from the happ@@ iness of the dre@@ aming cam@@ els of cam@@ els , the cam@@ els of dreams ,
happ@@ iness is an oasis that can only be reached dre@@ aming cam@@ els succe@@ eds in winning only dre@@ aming cam@@ els .
with this wis@@ dom of be@@ dou@@ in , the first chairman , wol@@ f@@ gan@@ g hen@@ ne , described the history and fas@@ c@@ ination of the association &quot; helping hands &quot; .
on saturday afternoon , the t@@ enth birth@@ day of the association was celebrated , which has already received considerable succ@@ esses .
the first chairman , mr hen@@ ne , reported at length about the work of the association .
he himself was the first time in maur@@ it@@ ania in 2004 in the ch@@ ei@@ j@@ k-@@ z@@ aj@@ ed hospital in n@@ ou@@ ak@@ ch@@ ot@@ t .
as a result , further cooperation has developed , and gy@@ na@@ eco@@ log@@ ist hen@@ ne conducted numerous operations on site on several trips .
during the speeches , pictures of the operations on a large screen were shown , so that the guests of the anniversary event of the a@@ fore@@ mentioned actions can get an impression .
the association &apos;s deser@@ t vehicle was also shown .
it is a former federal border protection vehicle .
ra@@ iner pre@@ w@@ o , the former o@@ b of n@@ ag@@ old , had proposed to equi@@ p this vehicle with a photo@@ vol@@ ta@@ ic system and is now planning to build a new car , according to h@@ anne , at the association .
in 2008 , the zim@@ mer@@ e@@ i sch@@ le@@ e@@ h from ba@@ i@@ er@@ s@@ br@@ on@@ n recorded a total of just under a week in service of the hospital in so@@ co@@ gi@@ m , a mis@@ ery district on the out@@ sk@@ ir@@ ts of the capital - hon@@ or@@ b@@ und - hon@@ or@@ d .
hen@@ ne also mentioned a new mother child hospital in n@@ ou@@ ak@@ ch@@ ot@@ t .

cou@@ l@@ son continued telephone h@@ acking to check a tip .
the previous news of the word editor and@@ y cou@@ l@@ son alle@@ ge@@ dly put “ telephone h@@ acking , monitoring , and confron@@ tation ” on the attempt to get a wrong tip about an aff@@ air of the then minister of the interior .
prosecu@@ tor andre@@ w ed@@ is q@@ c told the court in the old b@@ ail@@ ey that news of the world had a false rum@@ our in may 2005 that the c@@ lar@@ ke was a relationship with his “ attractive special advis@@ or . ”
the newspaper commission@@ ed the private detec@@ tive gl@@ en@@ n mul@@ ca@@ ire to investigate pa@@ w@@ l@@ by &apos;s vo@@ ic@@ em@@ ail@@ s , and persecu@@ ted them , but co@@ los@@ son ri@@ pped them too .
“ the public prosecu@@ tor believes that cou@@ l@@ son , who is now the editor of the no@@ t@@ w , is no one who stands in front of the home of people and hopes to se@@ ize it in a fresh way , but one who is the people .
he said no@@ t@@ w uses three methods to make stories investi@@ ga@@ tive .
the publish@@ er is personally involved in the third method .
he is obviously aware of the second , of monitoring , otherwise it cannot be .
what about the first ?
does he know about telephone h@@ acking ?
he is den@@ ying that , but we say , “ and whether he knew about it . ”
rum@@ ors of a clar@@ ke aff@@ air were first published by the feature ed@@ it@@ orial team of no@@ t@@ w , as a source of sexual abuse to pa@@ w@@ l@@ by .
a band with vo@@ ic@@ em@@ ail@@ s from your phone of at least three occasions was released in august 2006 in mul@@ ca@@ i@@ res apartment .
the investig@@ ators also found entries on the detec@@ tive &apos;s computer , on which pa@@ w@@ l@@ by and her si@@ ster were described as “ projects . ”
at the time when the research was going , the large parents were given a new life as a gift to pa@@ w@@ l@@ by , where they were asked for information about them .
meanwhile , former chief secretary general z@@ em@@ at ne@@ ville thur@@ l@@ be@@ k and the former chief editor of the united states supervis@@ ed the operation of the united states ’ movements .
on 18 june 2005 , cou@@ l@@ son left her a vo@@ ic@@ email with the following content : “ i have a story that we will release tomorrow , about which i would like to talk with charles . ”
ed@@ is explained that cou@@ l@@ son ’ s activities in this story followed the same pattern as other important person@@ alities , such as former interior minister david bl@@ un@@ ket@@ t .
the s@@ wor@@ n heard on thursday that cou@@ l@@ son bl@@ un@@ ket@@ t had to wait for an aff@@ air with a married woman when he himself was dealing with the co-@@ def@@ end@@ ant re@@ be@@ ka@@ h bro@@ o@@ ks .
cou@@ l@@ son and bro@@ o@@ ks argue that they should be con@@ signed to others , between 3 october 2000 and 9 august 2006 , and that they should h@@ ack phones .

in protest against the proposed re@@ ich tax , the french football will indeed be the first strike since 197@@ 2 .
a conciliation meeting will have no effect .
in the conflict over the wealth tax , the government and the professional football in france have been following a failed sh@@ ame .
president fran@@ ç@@ o@@ is hol@@ lan@@ de received a visit to the paris é@@ ly@@ s@@ ée palace on thursday , but he was not heard of it .
he refused to accept the football of the planned world cup 7@@ 5-@@ percent .
the other side , too , remained hard .
the plan for the strike announced at the end of november will now be carried out , as the head of association of professional clubs ( uc@@ p@@ f ) , je@@ an-@@ pi@@ er@@ re lou@@ vel , has announced .
the conference of presidents , scheduled for 29 november and 2 december , in li@@ gue 1 and li@@ gue 2 , will therefore be closed .
ge@@ chin@@ en : no absolute protection possible .
&quot; we want to involve the inhabitants in planning early on , &quot; may@@ or j@@ ens h@@ ä@@ us@@ ler opened the ci@@ vic information event on the flo@@ od protection concept in ge@@ ch@@ ingen .
around 80 participants were present in the municip@@ al hall to view the planned measures , ask questions and ask questions .
h@@ ä@@ ß@@ ler made it clear : &quot; the ultimate decisions are made by the members of the municip@@ al council &quot; .
the floo@@ ds that hit the country on 15 may 2009 , un@@ prepared , were a serious and tragic event , which caused the question of protection measures for the future .
a river bas@@ in investigation was conducted with the neighbouring a@@ id@@ ling@@ en municip@@ ality , which is now the basis of the flo@@ od protection concept in ge@@ ch@@ ingen .
&quot; the protection of as many buil@@ t-@@ in p@@ lots as possible is the goal , &quot; says h@@ ä@@ us@@ ler .
the basis of this is the planning of the protection against any 100 years of forec@@ asts expected by the german weather service .
climate change is being off@@ set by a 15@@ -@@ percent sur@@ charge .
this is described in professional cir@@ cles as &quot; h@@ q 100@@ ak@@ li@@ ma &quot; .
the water mass@@ es that were to be found in ge@@ ch@@ ingen in 2009 were a 10@@ 00@@ -@@ year-@@ old flo@@ od .
&quot; there is no absolute protection , but a relative improvement we can achieve &quot; , says h@@ ä@@ ß@@ ler .
to protect the h@@ q 100@@ ak@@ li@@ ma , you must have a minimum of four million euros invested in ch@@ efs , with the municip@@ ality receiving state aid of around eur 70 per cent .
but he pointed out that there is a need to promote only if a total concept is implemented .
to this end , the community must be dependent on the participation of the citizens .
a complex planning and approval process is not enough .
in the best case scenario , the implementation could start in 20@@ 16 .
among other things , the protection concept , which was already discussed last week in the municip@@ al council ( we reported ) , provides for local measures in the influ@@ x of the ir@@ m from the valley of the river ir@@ m .
following the presentation of the flo@@ od protection concept , participants took the opportunity to submit their concerns .
among other things , it has been ques@@ tioned as to why more dam@@ s and re@@ stra@@ int systems were not planned to protect the site .
gre@@ g@@ or k@@ ü@@ hn , technical plan@@ ner of the commission@@ ed engineering office wal@@ d and cor@@ be from h@@ ü@@ gel@@ sh@@ ei@@ m , who presented the concept , stressed that it needs the interaction of all the presented measures to achieve the desired sum .
furthermore , it is necessary to find the most economic solution , according to jo@@ achi@@ m wal@@ d von wal@@ d and cor@@ be .
dis@@ content was felt in al@@ t@@ ort ’ s an@@ ch@@ ors , who were still in trouble , even in normal stor@@ m conditions , with the channel network being over@@ loaded .
the problem is known about the administration and initial measures have already been taken .
but he pointed out that the directives on can@@ al@@ systems are different , but they are not applicable to flo@@ od protection and they are not to be mixed .
the municip@@ ality is obliged to interpre@@ t the channel network in such a way that two-@@ to three-@@ year reg@@ ener@@ ation events could be en@@ forced .
the se@@ wage channels greater than the amount of waste would s@@ wal@@ low millions .
the most serious in@@ ju@@ red after col@@ li@@ sion
in the early friday afternoon , 44 people were killed on provin@@ cial road 44 near rev@@ ens@@ dorf , in a fron@@ tal col@@ li@@ sion .
the police immediately closed the road completely , but could not help the accident .
however , there are various testi@@ mon@@ ies that need to be evalu@@ ated first .
it is clear that the 19 year-@@ old hand@@ le@@ man of a v@@ w golf was driving towards rev@@ ens@@ dorf and the 3@@ 8-@@ year-@@ old ge@@ tt@@ or@@ f man was watching her with his hy@@ un@@ da@@ i .
both vehicles cl@@ ash@@ ed , with the woman so hard to hold up that the fire department almost half a hour .
the actual cause of the accident was initially left un@@ clear .
both of these were in@@ ju@@ red in nearby hospit@@ als .
the route remained full for about two hours .
it could be called the do@@ sto@@ ev@@ sky of the united states .

late office at mer@@ kel in russia
the former us intelligence expert ed@@ ward snow@@ den has the potential to be the most effective in the us post-@@ ha@@ ff@@ ar@@ ist around chancell@@ or ang@@ ela mer@@ kel in his russian asylum .
representatives of the german federal att@@ or@@ ney could either ask questions in writing or personally send questions to the 30@@ -@@ year-@@ old in russia , the agency reported inter@@ fax .
previously , the federal green me@@ p , han@@ s-@@ christian str@@ ö@@ be@@ le , was the first german politici@@ an to introduce snow@@ den in moscow yesterday to discuss the aff@@ air with him .
n@@ sa rev@@ el@@ ations strengthen corporate par@@ an@@ o@@ ia for government surveillance and control .
on a mil@@ d day at the end of august , a german police helicop@@ ter fle@@ w deep across the us consul@@ ate in frankfurt am main , germany ’ s financial capital .
at the request of the federal office for constitutional protection and counter@@ -@@ terrorism ( b@@ v@@ t ) , the german internal security service , he should be the roof of the us foreign post , which is less than 5 km away from the european central bank .
according to the german media , the b@@ v@@ t wanted to ban the presence of surveillance an@@ ten@@ n@@ as and the action led to a change of words between the usa and the german foreign ministry in berlin .
james cla@@ pper , us director of national intelligence , insi@@ sted on the need to re@@ consider the us in september ’ s ability to es@@ timate its foreign sp@@ ying “ to cur@@ b foreign companies ’ business secre@@ ts on american orders . ”
but since ed@@ ward snow@@ den , who was a wh@@ ist@@ le@@ b@@ lower , the former work@@ er , with the publication of his cor@@ pse to us surveillance secre@@ ts , we have been aware of european governments and business leaders .
reports that the us national security agency has been supporting braz@@ ili@@ an oil company petro@@ b@@ as sp@@ ying out and collec@@ ting data from american cl@@ oud operators , including google and y@@ a@@ ho@@ o .
the bot@@ tle was dis@@ closed , the animal was dis@@ solved and the woman was given a telephone call .
if the most powerful person in europe can target , then surely the business leaders will also be potential targets .
snow@@ den has been working hard with us intelligence agencies and companies .
i believe it is con@@ cei@@ vable that this data could be used for mutual benefit .
“ germany must wake up , ” explains oli@@ ver gr@@ ü@@ n , president of the bit@@ mi , who is a german company representing small and medium-sized it companies .
german companies believe that the us has now taken almost as much risk as china in terms of industrial es@@ pi@@ on@@ age and data the@@ ft as it has done in the us in july .
in the snow@@ den le@@ ak@@ ed documents , however , there has been no evidence so far that the us has not yet fully recognised the business secre@@ ts of foreign companies to its own companies .
politicians have expressed concern that the eu is depri@@ ved of certain it and internet facilities and that they are reducing their dependence on the us .
companies are s@@ cep@@ tical about this .
the bun@@ de@@ sta@@ g has proposed that we should build a german google .
i can only close my eyes and re@@ open them slowly ...
“ that ’ s not working , ” says h@@ as@@ so pl@@ att@@ ner , chairman of the german software manufacturer sap .
if you want a strong european it industry , you would not have expected it 20 years ago .
everything in germany is subsid@@ ised , coal , cars and oil are subsid@@ ised .
everything except the it industry .
nevertheless , reach and technical re@@ fin@@ ement of the snow@@ den designs have not changed the way the us sp@@ ies revealed .
cl@@ oud compu@@ ting has under@@ gone a major change because european company leaders are now more aware that in the us stored data of local companies are not being subject to their jurisdiction and are therefore potentially at risk .
according to a statement published by the cl@@ oud security alliance , a trading institution , the commission has war@@ ned that the risk of fraud was being committed following the rev@@ el@@ ations of us data mining activities .
j@@ im sn@@ ab@@ e , depu@@ ty managing director of sap , says : “ we see a new issue for customers who want to have it a year ago – they are : where are my data stored and can they guarantee it ?
many german corporate leaders believe that the latest reports simply confirm what they are anyway .
the fact that economic es@@ pi@@ on@@ age is taking place is no surprise .
that has always been the case .
“ it was a topic for many years and has not fundament@@ ally changed through the current discussion , ” says kur@@ t bo@@ ck , chairman of the chemical company bas@@ f .
the americans are sp@@ ying on us at commercial and industrial level , as we are doing , because it is not in the national interest to defend our companies .
the company ’ s management usually does not bo@@ ast of the counter@@ measures that have been taken , because that gives an advantage to att@@ ack@@ ers .
in large companies , employees have been involved for a long time , and the use of a free usb stick on a trade show or un@@ guar@@ ded dec@@ k of a lap@@ top in the hotel room is not advis@@ able , to say the least .
ul@@ rich h@@ ack@@ en@@ ber@@ k , member of the executive board of au@@ di , says that for years it has been a standard practice to be the hand@@ set before a board meeting , so that it does not become a ta@@ pping device .
the german b@@ v@@ t advis@@ es managers to use simple prepa@@ id phones to make use of the phone when travelling abroad , because smar@@ t@@ phones may be com@@ promised .
the prepa@@ id phones will be dis@@ car@@ ded afterwards .
there is , however , concern that small and medium-sized enterprises may be vulnerable to h@@ acking and surveillance .
in germany , many of these companies are global market leaders in their respective nic@@ hes .
“ small and medium-sized enterprises often lack the experience , the staff and financial resources to effectively combat business secre@@ ts against un@@ authorised access , ” says the b@@ v@@ t in a report .
the us war@@ ns its own companies about es@@ pi@@ on@@ age by other countries .
according to washington post , the us national intelligence es@@ timate in february sent france , russia , and israel to second place behind china , with the countries that joined the us to obtain economic data for the h@@ ack@@ ing .
a member of the board of directors of a german blue chi@@ p company agreed to the commission &apos;s proposal when it comes to es@@ pi@@ on@@ age , then “ the french are the worst . ”
bern@@ ard squ@@ ar@@ cin@@ i , former head of the french civil service d@@ cr@@ l , was arrested this month in an interview with zi@@ ti@@ ert : “ the secret services know very well that all countries , even if they are fighting .

parents of a geor@@ gian te@@ en@@ ager who was born in a tragic accident were to believe in murder and murder .
the te@@ en@@ ag@@ ers ’ parents , whose body is in a ro@@ lled r@@ ing@@ er@@ m@@ at in the gym of his high school , are convinced that the body is being mur@@ dered , explained the an@@ gel .
k@@ end@@ ric@@ k jo@@ hn@@ son from val@@ do@@ sta in the state of georgia was born in a u@@ pri@@ ght ma@@ at on january 11 , which was held behind the grand@@ stand in the school gym .
the sh@@ eri@@ ff ’ s investig@@ ators at low@@ n@@ des county came to the conclusion that jo@@ hn@@ son was not able to do anything in the event of a tragic accident , which was not the case for the 17@@ -@@ year-@@ old family .
“ they are convinced that their son was mur@@ dered , ” ben@@ jam@@ in cr@@ um@@ p , the law@@ yer of ken@@ ne@@ th and jac@@ qu@@ el@@ y@@ n jo@@ hn@@ son , said to fo@@ x@@ new@@ s.@@ com@@ .
they would never have believed that he had died as the s@@ her@@ ir@@ ff had .
“ they believe that it is de@@ vo@@ id of logic to viol@@ ate the laws of physi@@ cs as well as common sense .
rather , they are convinced that the truth is being conce@@ aled to protect the person or person who is responsible for the death of their son .
&quot; her son went to school to learn and came to the hospital , &quot; comm@@ ented .
us prosecu@@ tor michael mo@@ ore said on thursday that there will be a formal investigation into jo@@ hn@@ son &apos;s death , because a number of important questions remain un@@ resolved .
what was the cause of death ?
is his death due to a crime ?
this is what mo@@ ore said at a press conference on thursday afternoon .
i follow the facts of the direction in which they are heading .
my aim is to find out the truth .
“ i believe that a sufficient number of member states have a basis for a formal investigation , ” he said .
mo@@ ore explained to re@@ porters that the initial au@@ top@@ sy suggests that the first thing he was doing is to work on the consequences of a “ posi@@ tion-@@ related de@@ pression . ”
a second au@@ top@@ sy , however , has caused another death cause , mo@@ ore said .
“ there are a number of questions that need to be answered or confirmed , ” he said .
mo@@ ore added , if there is sufficient evidence of criminal prosecu@@ tion or civil prosecu@@ tion , that he was dead .
a representative of the county sh@@ eri@@ ffs was waiting for our request on thursday to be able to comment immediately .
a dish in southern georgia ordered the death of the king of georgia on wednesday .
the te@@ en@@ ag@@ ers ’ parents said they hoped that the video rec@@ ord@@ ings contained evidence of how he died .
c@@ dc publish aller@@ gic guidelines for schools and other institutions .
on wednesday , the centers for di@@ abe@@ tes control and control ( c@@ s@@ r ) published a review of the european union &apos;s policy on the treatment of food aller@@ gies in schools .
these are the first such directives that the us government has issued , as the number of compulsory scho@@ ol@@ children is growing with food aller@@ gies .
one in 20 children in the united states has a food aller@@ gy .
the spread of food aller@@ gies among children has increased by more than 18 % between 1997 and 2007 , according to the c@@ dc .
the guidelines contain information for schools that are not yet aware of food aller@@ gies in the teaching body and the staff and how to deal with children who suffer from aller@@ gic re@@ actions .
it is also recommended that schools e@@ pin@@ ep@@ hr@@ in have in stock – the auto injec@@ tion of the brand e@@ pi@@ pen is most commonly used – to avoid a potentially dead@@ ly over@@ sensi@@ tivity tra@@ p .
the legisl@@ ators in the states have recently amended the rules so that schools ep@@ in@@ ep@@ hr@@ in can keep them in a more simple way .
the report also lists typical symp@@ t@@ oms that have been mentioned by children who have a aller@@ gic reaction .
children may say , “ it feels as if something had been written on my ton@@ gue , ” “ my ton@@ gue feels at home , as if a hair is on it ” or “ my ton@@ gue is cri@@ b@@ bing ” .
parents of inter@@ sexual children can “ get un@@ determined ” sex .
germany is the first european nation to have a third sex for children , who are living with un@@ clear gen@@ it@@ als .
new@@ born children will no longer be star@@ dly male or female .
under the new law , parents no longer have to declare sex for such children , but can be “ v@@ ague ” or “ not fixed ” on the birth certificate .
the aim of the law is to take the pressure of parents so that they do not have to take ha@@ sty decisions regarding sexual access operations in new bir@@ ths .
an inter@@ sexual person said , according to bb@@ c years later , “ i am neither man nor woman . ”
i remain the pat@@ ch@@ work that has been created by doctors , mu@@ ti@@ lated and full of sc@@ ars .
it is estimated that one in two thousand children every year do not come to the world either as young or as girls .
they are inter@@ sexual , a group that is diagno@@ sed with the ‘ sexual differen@@ tial dis@@ order ’ ( ds@@ d ) .
val@@ ais simp@@ son was perhaps inter@@ sexual .
understanding gender identification is still not very good developed , but we do not believe that most experts in the us should be allowed to use the best available information on gender allocation , if a provision is not possible , and not on the basis of gender .
the new york psy@@ chi@@ at@@ ris@@ t dr. j@@ ack dres@@ cher , who focuses on the problem of gender identification , said that the new german law “ k@@ ling@@ e after a good thing ” .
inter@@ sexual children are an ethical dil@@ em@@ ma .
“ some people have life@@ -@@ threat@@ ening diseases that require sur@@ g@@ ical intervention , but they are not enough for most children . ”
you can not assi@@ gn a gender without sur@@ gery and then wait for the identity to develop .
the scientific data on how a child can actually develop its gender identity are not very accurate .
no one knows why it is happening .
it is like the secret , why people are hom@@ os@@ ex@@ ual .
in a report to the european commission in 2011 , it is stated that inter@@ sexual people are excluded from trans@@ sexual or trans@@ gender persons .
these characteristics were reflected in secondary sexual characteristics .
the report also gives an overview of the discrimination that inter@@ sexual and trans@@ gender persons face in their professional lives and about the extent of the har@@ ass@@ ment they suffer , violence and pre@@ jud@@ ice .
not in line with the gender picture , bo@@ ys now have a special camp .
meanwhile , australia and ne@@ pal allow adults to access official documents by male , female , or “ third ” .
in june , austr@@ ali@@ an nor@@ ri@@ e ma@@ y-@@ wel@@ by ( 52 ) was the first “ sex@@ less ” person in the world to be recognized after a court rul@@ ed that a “ un@@ defined ” gender status should be maintained for life .
german pass@@ ports will have a third as@@ sign@@ ment , x for inter@@ sex@@ u@@ als , in addition to m and w , so the ministry of the interior .
in neighbouring france , gender issues are still controversial .
in 2011 , do@@ z@@ ens of french members of the strictly catho@@ lic country signed a peti@@ tion that “ gender theory ” was made out of school books .
the us website ca@@ th@@ ol@@ ic online has also spoken out against the german law , on the grounds that “ if the world is in a new state , where gender is a choice , sexual orientation is a decision , but not sexual activity , then ”
the mother of a new@@ born from mar@@ y@@ land declared to baby zone that she would be better off if bab@@ ies were to be a sex at birth .
&quot; being parents is also a necessity without further restrictions .
children need stability and security .
histor@@ ically , children who had been treated with both male and female sexual subjects were often depri@@ ved of their right to education and to study in the same way as attractive greek god who had both sex@@ es .
ten years ago , medicine regarded gender as something that was not seen as a threat to the future and could then be re@@ built .
but now the ethical foundations of an operation are being called into question , as we know how complex the gender identity is , and that doctors are also being mis@@ led because they do not know how to treat the child when it gro@@ ws up with the child .
“ in the middle of the 20th century , one was called the psy@@ chi@@ at@@ ric emergency , ” says dres@@ cher .
when such a child was born , it was not the psy@@ chi@@ at@@ ris@@ t , but the sur@@ ge@@ on .
the prevail@@ ing theory of the treatment of children with un@@ clear gen@@ ital status dates back to dr. john money of jo@@ hn@@ s ho@@ p@@ k@@ ins university , who has argu@@ ed that the gender of the child is form@@ able .
he defined the term “ gender identity ” and argu@@ ed that social and environmental issues are not the only causes of the problem – as parents raise a child .
but , in a report entitled “ john / jo@@ an ” from the year 196@@ 6 , his the@@ ories were controversial .
he called the parents of a boy whose pen@@ is is not allowed to drink when they are ple@@ d@@ ged , but he told them to ca@@ str@@ ate the child and to keep his te@@ eth out and then to te@@ ach him up as girls .
&quot; money presented this case as a successful example of a transformation , which he did not have , &quot; says dres@@ ser .
when the boy was about 15 , he moved back to the male sex and married a woman .
with 38 but he did commit su@@ ici@@ de .
according to dres@@ cher , there are still doctors who would practice this model .
but in the 1990 ’ s , with the internet coming in , survi@@ v@@ ors of these gender operations were made public , who “ did not feel happy with the result . ”
for example , j@@ im bru@@ ce , a 3@@ 6-@@ year-@@ old writer from mon@@ tan@@ a who was born with x@@ y-@@ male ch@@ ro@@ mo@@ som@@ es , but ambigu@@ ous gen@@ itali@@ ans .
doctors were un@@ aware of whether he had a big cli@@ mat@@ ori or a small pen@@ is , and were convinced that he could never become a “ satisfactory life . ”
so its external body and the p@@ est were re@@ built shortly after the birth of 197@@ 6 , and it was called a girl .
at the age of 12 , he received female hor@@ mon@@ es .
“ i knew i was not a girl , ” he said to ab@@ c@@ news@@ .com that he was a good friend of ab@@ c@@ news@@ .com .
i was unfortunate , but it was really difficult to ask questions .
at the age of 18 he was supposed to get a v@@ ag@@ inal plastic .
but , since he was de@@ pressed , he knew that something was wrong , he demanded that his medical action be taken .
what he found was sho@@ cking .
i was ster@@ ili@@ zed at my birth – and no one ever told me .
bru@@ ce was born with a ds@@ d , which did not te@@ sto@@ ster@@ one enough to develop gen@@ it@@ als .
after knowing the truth , he returned to the male identity , received te@@ sto@@ ster@@ one in@@ je@@ k@@ tions and settled down his bre@@ asts .
the sur@@ gery has made it inf@@ er@@ tile .
today , he is fighting for others in an organization called interface project for inter@@ sexual people to be per@@ ceived as normal .
but anne tam@@ ar@@ -@@ mat@@ tis , managing director of the american company based in california , ad@@ voca@@ tes , has been a member of the international community for the protection of human rights .
“ many activi@@ sts are concerned that the german decision could encourage parents to take quick decisions and give the child a , not fixed , ” said the german government .
we fear that this will favour intervention .
we think it would be better to have male or female sex , but to have them wait .
but we do not yet know how the law will impact , so we can only spec@@ ulate .
tam@@ ar@@ -@@ mat@@ tis said that her organization supported the austr@@ ali@@ an law , because “ it allows adults to be recognised as a third sex ” .
“ adults should be able to make their own decisions about their legal sex , ” she explained .
the german law is about the allocation of birth .
this is not a battle to which small children should be forced at this time .
when they are grown up , they can decide for themselves on their bodies .
but ar@@ len@@ e bar@@ at@@ z , a bru@@ str@@ ad@@ o@@ log@@ ist from pit@@ ts@@ burg , who was a daughter with a sexual dis@@ order , and who had hundreds of others in a self-@@ help group , says that the law does not .
k@@ ati@@ e , the daughter of bar@@ at@@ z , was born with male ch@@ ro@@ mo@@ som@@ es , but has a ds@@ d called complete and@@ ro@@ -@@ resistance .
the recep@@ tor &apos;s def@@ ect of target cells for te@@ sto@@ ster@@ one caused k@@ ati@@ e to develop female characteristics .
she has a v@@ ag@@ ina but no u@@ ter@@ us and no ov@@ aries .
today k@@ ati@@ e 29 is married ; she works on the university of pen@@ n@@ sy@@ l@@ v@@ ania .
it is inf@@ er@@ tile , but hopes to be able to achieve a better future through adoption or sur@@ ro@@ gate mother .
&quot; the law gives parents room , which does not make them rus@@ h to make decisions , &quot; bar@@ at@@ z said .
it gives you the time to test and to clarify things and gives you time to do it .
in this way everything is fine – you pul@@ l the child and love it .
we have a wonderful baby and enjoy the parents lu@@ ck .
and you do not have to rus@@ h to carry out an operation that cannot be rever@@ sed .
&quot; this includes children in the decision and elimin@@ ates the fear that parents are ex@@ ag@@ ger@@ ating because they believe that they are not the right thing to do , &quot; said the children .
in the end , the child deci@@ des on the sex that f@@ its better with him – and that is wonderful .
this will enable children to make the decision themselves .
unknown in@@ j@@ ure girls by shot from car
unknown people have died in sho@@ ts from a car in sa@@ x@@ on@@ y-@@ an@@ hal@@ t .
the perpe@@ tr@@ ators had to be arrested in geneva on thursday evening with a gun of air pressure on a group of children .
that was what the police told us in burg .
the girl is easily w@@ oun@@ ded on the left w@@ ade .
rescue forces brought the girl to hospital .
the shot came from a small car that was attached to a group of six children and suddenly stopped .
wit@@ nesses saw two people sitting in the car .
the perpe@@ tr@@ ators also shot at a bus stop .
a dis@@ c bro@@ ke .
they then moved on .
the criminal police are investig@@ ating , they said on friday .
until now , the police inspection has been able to k@@ emp@@ ten to a quiet hal@@ lo@@ ween night .
officials were only invited to attend school twice , which had been forced to work against house fac@@ ades .
since the home@@ owners recognized this in time and the e@@ gg@@ s were removed immediately , no damage should have ar@@ is@@ en .
in addition , some sy@@ l@@ ve@@ ster@@ bo@@ e@@ gl@@ ers were lit in the city area , but no damage was caused here .
a resid@@ ent in the bis@@ ch@@ of fre@@ i@@ ghter way reported that his car was sto@@ len with a kno@@ b and his wheel tri@@ m was sto@@ len .
until the police arrived , the man has to remove his wheel decor@@ ative blin@@ ds in the immediate vicinity , so the police are not obliged to continue to act .
living with a future perspective
wal@@ tr@@ au@@ d ries really lives in a dream .
your house is located in a quiet residential area of stutt@@ gart with lots of green , an old tree stock , nice neighb@@ ors and also not too much traffic .
the city is only a few minutes away by public transport .
&quot; hopefully you are not afraid of sp@@ id@@ ers ? &quot; says wal@@ tr@@ au@@ d ries , and points to a f@@ at spi@@ der on the door frame .
i have been looking for a new home for my hus@@ band and myself for some time .
but you know how difficult that is in stutt@@ gart .
the reason is not a spi@@ der pho@@ bia , but the concern to keep the many steps to the house and apartment at old age out of control , she explains .
moreover , since the men@@ is@@ k@@ us operation , the mit@@ tel@@ 50 has experienced in her own bodies what it means to deal with handic@@ ap from stockholm .
recently , a book of her appeared on the subject of &quot; happy living in old - what kind of housing is the best for me ? &quot; .
&apos;@@ our apartment is the best example of what is not possible at age &apos; , it begins to tell .
when they started their hus@@ band in the ma@@ is@@ on@@ ette apartment more than 20 years ago , it was simply a beautiful apartment in the middle of the green .
today with the middle of fif@@ ty wal@@ tr@@ au@@ d ries thin@@ ks differently about this .
however , she also knows that she is one of the few people who even deals with the issue of &apos; old age &apos; .
most people are squ@@ ee@@ zing it as long as it goes .
only the other people are getting old , &quot; she says .
only when the suffering is really great will we consider it .
&apos;@@ then it can be too late &apos; , says ries .
in its book , interior architec@@ t presents 17 models of living for self-@@ determined living in old age .
&apos;@@ which type of accommodation you choose , however , is always an individual decision &apos; , she explains .
d i e solution does not exist for the age .
even those who take the reti@@ rement home in tus@@ c@@ any or brit@@ t@@ any should be aware of the fact that they are also si@@ ck .
and : &apos; without good knowledge of the language , you can also work in the dol@@ ce vit@@ a , &apos; gives the author of the book a chance to re@@ locate .
among their models are classic care models , alternative forms of living , or the often quo@@ ted ren@@ t-@@ a-@@ car w@@ g .
at age , everyone has their tic@@ ks and cor@@ ners so much that they can get their hands on their nec@@ ks and nec@@ ks .
&apos;@@ for me , such a community of fl@@ ats would be nothing , &apos; she says with a win@@ k .
not as in a student w@@ g with a shared bathroom and kitchen .
&quot; in old age , you simply need your re@@ treat rooms , &quot; says ries .
the fact that a senior residence community can still function is something that the book author does not want to rule out .
but that should be different from the classic student debate .
and sometimes you just want to be calm , &apos; she believes .
with this view , it is not alone , at least in the capital of the country .
&apos;@@ most old people in stutt@@ gart want to stay in their own flat for as long as possible &apos; is also the experience of the@@ res@@ a r@@ ü@@ t@@ ten , the head of civil service living in the age of the state capital .
your department advis@@ es people on the subject of &apos; getting older &apos; .
that is why it is particularly elderly people who would often buy in@@ convenience and restrictions just to be able to stay in their habit@@ ual environment , and that is also the experience of the foundation wa@@ ren@@ test .
there are many ways of getting to know the house or apartment without barriers .
ries recomm@@ ends to all those who are concerned with the renov@@ ation of their home or apartment in a suitable way , to get a thorough insight into the situation and not to try the first best cra@@ ft@@ sman .
today , there are also a number of specialists for the re@@ building that is appropriate for the age .
even in the apartment , one or two things can be realized , and if it only has the toilet seat increase , the interior designer clari@@ fies the situation .
but the existing apartment cannot always be adapted to the age and therefore accessible , even if it is still so beautiful .
wal@@ tr@@ au@@ d ries had to do this .
the apartment is very small and the room is very small .
it will continue to search until it becomes the ideal object for itself and your hus@@ band .
before moving , she gre@@ ets her more than before the spi@@ der at her home .
the us wants to continue prosecu@@ ting snow@@ den
the us has changed its stance on the former us intelligence officer ed@@ ward snow@@ den .
he is still accused of using un@@ authorised secret information .
therefore , he must be subject to criminal proceedings in the united states , said us secretary of state jen@@ ni@@ fer p@@ sa@@ ki , in washington .
the recent statements by snow@@ den would not change this either .
previously , german green politici@@ an han@@ s-@@ christian str@@ ö@@ be@@ le had a meeting with snow@@ den in moscow .
p@@ sa@@ ki stressed that curren@@ ts are strong , but not the ones of a parliam@@ ent@@ arian .
ed@@ ward snow@@ den , the secret service provider , is basically invited to talk to german authorities .
first , however , he wants to know his situation .
this has not helped the former n@@ sa staff in a non-@@ address country that the us sought , which is the green politici@@ an han@@ s-@@ christian fer@@ n@@ se@@ h@@ le , on friday , after a meeting with snow@@ den , and sent to the government .
the letter has been written in a translation of str@@ ö@@ be@@ le :
to the competent authorities
i have been asked to give you a reply regarding your inquiry on mass surveillance .
my name is ed@@ ward joseph snow@@ den and was previously contrac@@ ted or directly connected to the technical expert .
in the course of my work in these institutions , i have witn@@ essed systematic bre@@ aches of the law of my government , which have led me to act on moral grounds .
as a result of the publication of these concerns , i was faced with a serious and persi@@ stent r@@ ash that forced me to leave my family and my hom@@ eland .
i am currently living in ex@@ ile and i enjoy temporary asylum , which is the request of the russian federation under international law .
i am encouraged by the response to my political action , both in the us and elsewhere .
citizens around the world , as well as senior officials - including the united states - have been watching the rev@@ el@@ ations into a system of all-@@ en@@ comp@@ ass@@ ing surveillance that is not accoun@@ table to anyone as a public service .
this sp@@ y rev@@ el@@ ations brought many proposals for new laws and directives .
the benefits for society from these findings are not being made clearer ; at the same time , the risks that have been taken have been vi@@ sibly di@@ min@@ ished .
although the result of my efforts has been demonstr@@ ably positive , my government continues to treat dis@@ sent as a violation of its loy@@ alty and seek to crimin@@ alise political expression and prosecu@@ te it .
nevertheless , telling the truth is not a crime .
i am confident that the united states government , with the support of the international community , will put an end to this unacceptable attitude .
i hope that , when the difficulties of this humanitarian situation have been resolved , i will be able to participate in the responsible en@@ ligh@@ ten@@ ment of the facts regarding the actions taken in the media , particularly with regard to truth and authentic@@ ity .
i look forward to talking to you in your country as soon as the situation is clari@@ fied and thank you for your efforts to respect international law , which protec@@ ts us all .

report : obama campaign considered bi@@ d@@ ding through h@@ ill@@ ary clin@@ ton , but the bush administration has not yet done anything to change the way the world works .
president bar@@ ack obama ’ s clo@@ s@@ est advis@@ ers , in secret , have considered that vice-president jo@@ e bi@@ den should be replaced by h@@ ill@@ ary clin@@ ton in the 2012 election campaign , according to the new york times .
the rev@@ el@@ ation is the most no@@ table surprise of the long-@@ awa@@ ited work of mark hal@@ per@@ in and john he@@ il@@ em@@ ann on the 20@@ 12 election campaign , “ double down : gam@@ e-@@ chan@@ ge 2012 . ”
the times is a copy of the upcoming release of the new book , and it reported on thursday , december 9 , that the dead of the book will be “ extensive group meetings and surve@@ ys at the end of 2011 ” to find out .
according to jon@@ a@@ than martin , national political correspon@@ dent of the times , the book thoroughly records the history of the efforts of leading campaign and white house staff to help , especially the former white house .
the potential change was a strictly guar@@ ded secret within the campaigns .
only half a do@@ zen of the president ’ s clo@@ s@@ est advis@@ ers – including dal@@ ey , obama ’ s former campaign leader , j@@ im mess@@ ina , and the former white house ’ s senior advis@@ er , david ax@@ el@@ ro@@ d , and david david ax@@ el@@ ro@@ d , and david .
in double down , it is claimed that dal@@ ey was at the fore@@ front of efforts to keep bi@@ ds in the hands of the je@@ ws , despite their “ close , personal relationship . ” before they eventually came to an end .
in an interview with martin , dal@@ ey confirmed that the government really thought about using bi@@ ds through clin@@ ton .
“ i made a whole series of things that could be considered , and that was one of them , ” said d@@ ley , the magazine .
we must remember that the president was terri@@ fying at the time of the po@@ ll , so we thought : “ for god ’ s sake , what do we do ? ”
while dal@@ ey was the &quot; due d@@ ili@@ gence &quot; of the investigations , martin said to an@@ der@@ son co@@ op@@ er of c@@ n@@ n that , during the re-@@ election campaign , considerable effort had been made to find out whether a new one could be .
“ campaigns do not spend as much money on surve@@ ys and focus groups when they do not think seriously about something , ” said martin on ac@@ 3@@ 60 .
it is not clear , however , whether obama knew that his team would think about an exchange .
martin said to c@@ n@@ n , he asked dal@@ ey if his then bo@@ ss had the potential to change .
although dal@@ ey said he did not believe that the president would be aware of the possible change , the former president of the stable ad@@ mitted that it was “ possible . ”
martin added that “ double down ” is not a defini@@ tive answer to the question that the us political songs are not “ enough to make ” obama ’ s writing desk .
co@@ op@@ er asked martin if he seriously thought obama had heard nothing of the investigation about how he could be bi@@ d@@ ding in the elections .
“ possible , ” martin rep@@ lied .
what happens on the way with my email ?
e-mail is actually an electronic letter .
was in the design of the internet service email similar to the conventional post techn@@ ically the secret of letter ?
the concept of early internet services focused on making communication possible .
that is why the basic technical proto@@ col@@ s have not taken care to establish a stable basis for a hearing safe correspon@@ dence .
therefore , a conventional e-mail correspon@@ ds to an open post@@ card rather than a se@@ aled letter .
if the user &quot; anna &quot; is sent to &quot; ben@@ ni &quot; an e-mail , the two computers are then directly connected ?
the email program or the browser of anna sen@@ ds the mail to the mail server of your service provider in the first step .
for example , if you have a g@@ mail account , google would .
this mail server sen@@ ds the content to the provider , which uses ben@@ ni .
on the track , the mail can be access@@ ed via a number of other servers on the internet .
ben@@ ni@@ e can then request the content from its provider .
if traditional e-@@ ma@@ ils are sent to your mobile through the network ?
most of the em@@ ail@@ s are sent by software robo@@ ts several times .
the sen@@ der provider uses a veri@@ fication to check that the mail contains a mal@@ icious program as an att@@ ach@@ ment .
on the recei@@ ver systems , a virus check is also carried out .
in addition , providers check whether it is an in@@ convenient and un@@ wanted sp@@ am mail , which is deleted immediately or at least is sent to a sp@@ am folder .
if the robo@@ ts have another task ?
for systems like g@@ mail , the robo@@ t also determin@@ es the information google provides for context advertising .
if anna and ben@@ ni are informed by g@@ mail about their coming holiday trip , google can provide links to holiday offers .
do you read un@@ familiar people ?
the prob@@ ability that un@@ authorized persons will read an email is extremely low .
in theory , however , this is possible .
in companies administr@@ ators often have the possibility to read electronic mail .
the law enforcement authorities and the secret services also have legal means of inter@@ cep@@ ting or no@@ ting e-@@ ma@@ ils .
there are also possible illegal dis@@ plac@@ ement measures .
is it possible to send e-@@ ma@@ ils against reading ?
using encry@@ ption according to the open@@ p@@ g@@ p standard , an e-mail can be effectively encry@@ p@@ ted against read .
with a lot of technical effort it is also possible to use the met@@ ad@@ ata of an e-mail communication , so that it is not even easy to identify who communic@@ ates with whom .
how important are y@@ a@@ ho@@ o and google on the email market in germany ?
the most commonly used private mail@@ boxes are y@@ a@@ ho@@ o and google , according to an investigation by con@@ vi@@ os consulting of august 2013 , only a minor role .
while y@@ a@@ ho@@ o-@@ mail ’ s shares were last down , g@@ mail was able to increase significantly from google .
mother in the forest dis@@ appears and reti@@ res .
when his be@@ ta@@ zed mother died , a man from wol@@ f@@ sburg for@@ ged a plan .
he bur@@ ied the dead in a forest - and continued to collect their pensions and care@@ rs .
to continue with pensions and care , you must have a professional insurance company that has been in charge of the death of wol@@ f@@ sburg after an investigation by the police in the forest .
first , he comm@@ ented the death of the 89 year ol@@ ds , then he was@@ ted the money for more than a year and a half .
now the 67 year old must be responsible for fraud , as a speaker said on friday .
so the man hi@@ d the woman in a forest near hel@@ m@@ ste@@ dt .
the man was susp@@ ected in may : at that time , it was discovered that there was no provision for nur@@ sing mo@@ thers .
the investig@@ ators told the pen@@ sion@@ ers that his mother had travell@@ ed to spain .
because officials are cur@@ ious about this , they continued to identify it .
it was discovered that the two had been living in a shared flat for more than 15 years and that he had recently maintained them .
the 67 year-@@ old finally died , his mother .
an ob@@ session with the police revealed no evidence of a capital crime .
want to get ice cre@@ am that g@@ lows in the dark ?
a british entreprene@@ ur has the first in the dark ic@@ e-@@ cre@@ am developed – using tor@@ ment .
char@@ lie franc@@ is made the flu@@ o@@ res@@ cent properties of the sea cre@@ atures .
the idea came to him after he had completed a research on tor@@ ment and persu@@ aded chinese scientists to accept the sh@@ ining prote@@ in arti@@ fici@@ ally .
the ice cre@@ am re@@ acts with ton@@ gue when consum@@ ing , which reduces the ph value in prote@@ in and reduces the lu@@ min@@ os@@ ity .
chr@@ is explains that the ice cre@@ am respon@@ ds to the heat in the mouth and g@@ low – the more you lic@@ k , the bri@@ ghter it becomes .
char@@ lie , founder of the ice cre@@ am company , “ lic@@ k me &apos;s delicious ” , says : “ the product is incredi@@ bly , but still in a very early production phase , and so gets a two gram@@ s of it for you . ”
the ice cre@@ am prote@@ in re@@ acts with the ton@@ gue at a neutral t@@ onic and has a positive effect on the skin .
when the mouth is warming up the prote@@ in , the ph value and ice rise .
we have had it tested in recent months and it seemed to us ideal to have it on hal@@ lo@@ ween on the market because it was this wonderful illu@@ min@@ ation effect that we had .
it is probably the most expensive ice cre@@ am i ever made , because the tor@@ rent light is the fourth time t@@ ough@@ er than gold .
each ball costs me about 1@@ 40 p@@ ounds .
but it tas@@ tes delicious for that .
char@@ lie &apos;s experim@@ ental company , based in bri@@ st@@ ol , is famous for its unusual flav@@ ours , including bi@@ er , cheese , cheese , beef and other black meat .
but his latest creation is to become even more ambitious .
he says , ‘ i would like to see an invi@@ sible ice cre@@ am ’ .
that is impossible in itself because of the break@@ down in light caused by the ice cryst@@ als , from which ice cre@@ am is made ; but i susp@@ ect we will find a way to do it .
the ice cre@@ am uses the flu@@ o@@ res@@ cent properties of a tor@@ ment arti@@ fici@@ ally produced by chinese scientists .
the ts@@ v mor@@ sum is still in operation after six days of play without any point in the hand@@ ball league .
it is now of all times that the team of ing@@ o e@@ h@@ lers will be coming to the der@@ by tomorrow against the ts@@ v da@@ ver@@ den , who celebrated his first victory last weekend .
the season begins with this game for us .
&quot; i hope that we can finally get our head free &quot; , e@@ h@@ ler &apos;s behavior is optim@@ istic .
he finally got the chance to see the world of the world &apos;s most famous and famous h@@ end@@ ri@@ k blo@@ h@@ me .
da@@ ver@@ den , like us , is also committed to speed .
we must therefore keep our error rate low .
first and foremost , however , we need to increase the coverage , which is , in the last analysis , anything but certain .
the room was very clean and the staff were friendly .
the game was of course a house number .
but that is why we are far from being the favourite , because everything can always happen in the der@@ by .
however , pan@@ it@@ z now wants to prove in mor@@ sum to start a series .
jan@@ -@@ mal@@ te j@@ ad@@ at is missing .
for this purpose , the a young jo@@ o@@ st wind@@ ß@@ uss , who has been awarded double game rights in the a-@@ youth bun@@ des@@ lig@@ a h@@ c bre@@ men , celebra@@ tes his seas@@ onal de@@ but .
if you don &apos;t like this game , you should stay at home .
hal@@ lo@@ ween 2013 : in figures
when i was a little bit small , hal@@ lo@@ ween had something mag@@ ical .
my si@@ ster and i were allowed to eat s@@ wee@@ ts , stay late and take us to the neighbor@@ hood .
today i am more interested in the hal@@ lo@@ ween mu@@ ff@@ le .
in the last two years , i have not agreed to move from my home to s@@ wee@@ ts , and i am sure that i will not do so this year either .
but according to statistics , i am a black she@@ ep , as far as hal@@ lo@@ ween is concerned .
the majority of americans – 15@@ 8 million to be exact – are celebr@@ ating hal@@ lo@@ ween this year , spending a total of us $ 6.@@ 9 billion on c@@ and@@ y , cost@@ umes , and decor@@ ations , according to the us president .
one thing i can rely on every hal@@ lo@@ ween then again is the tren@@ d@@ setting .
the cost@@ umes will be about 1.@@ 2 billion of the us $ 6.@@ 9 billion spent , according to the n@@ r@@ f .
this year , exciting un@@ ani@@ mated items are the last cr@@ y .
women no longer need to wear sex@@ y clothes , they can now also wear se@@ duc@@ tive food , such as piz@@ za , ham@@ bur@@ gers or car@@ ro@@ ts .
as far as men are concerned , i expect a lot of z@@ om@@ b@@ ies thanks to the walking dead , and i bet that the d@@ af@@ t-@@ pun@@ k space men will be able to put it into the inst@@ ag@@ ram fe@@ eds this year .
according to google , the most sou@@ gh@@ t-@@ after cost@@ umes are z@@ om@@ b@@ ies , bat@@ man , pi@@ rates and wit@@ ches .
i susp@@ ect that there is nothing wrong with tradition .
last year we were dres@@ sed up our dogs and were ast@@ on@@ ished not to be alone .
indeed , americans spend $ 3@@ 30 million this year on pet cost@@ umes , according to the n@@ r@@ f .
these are a lot of “ hot dogs ” .
as regards s@@ wee@@ ts , we are not c@@ un@@ ning .
americans will spend $ 1.@@ 9 billion this year , the ni@@ el@@ sen company said .
this is about 2@@ 70 million kil@@ o@@ gram@@ s of chocolate , lu@@ t@@ ches , c@@ and@@ y and rubber be@@ ar@@ ings .
so good news for the us department of commerce , according to 41 million people who are tr@@ app@@ ed with the s@@ log@@ an “ sweet or aci@@ dic ” .
in fact , we will have to pay more than 40 million kil@@ o@@ gram@@ s of chocolate for hal@@ lo@@ ween and – let us not fo@@ ol ourselves – eat .
the only thing we do not want to con@@ sume is the sweet c@@ and@@ y cor@@ n ; yet 15 million kil@@ o@@ gram@@ s of it are sold around hal@@ lo@@ ween , according to the national association of conf@@ ec@@ tion@@ ery manufacturers .
that is about nine billion ma@@ ize gra@@ ins .
it is a myster@@ y that i have not yet been able to solve .
nothing is part of hal@@ lo@@ ween more than houses where it sp@@ ills .
they have great names like “ terror behind the wall@@ s ” ( which is , inci@@ dentally , a real prison ) , “ ho@@ w@@ l-@@ o-@@ scre@@ am ” and “ the house of sho@@ ck ” .
there are indeed 1,@@ 200 officially recognised sp@@ uk@@ sh@@ ä@@ user in the united states , which has earned $ 500 million , according to america ha@@ un@@ ts , and that includes the wonderful photos that the us has just taken .
but let us finally get to the pum@@ p@@ k@@ ins .
char@@ lie brown made us with the big pum@@ p@@ k@@ in when we were children , and car@@ ving a pum@@ p@@ k@@ in lan@@ ter@@ n is like decor@@ ating christmas tree .
fortunately , the “ baby in the pum@@ p@@ k@@ in ” trend began only last year thanks to p@@ inte@@ st , so most of us have grown up with the pum@@ p@@ k@@ in and not , in it .
this year , americans will spend about $ 10@@ 6 million on pum@@ p@@ k@@ in , say the us cen@@ sus bureau .
the pum@@ p lan@@ ter@@ n , which is slowly rot@@ ating in the front garden , is probably from il@@ lin@@ o@@ is , where this year it cut 2@@ 45 million kil@@ o@@ gram@@ s .
if you want to score correctly , call ti@@ m and sus@@ an ma@@ th@@ is@@ don in nap@@ a , california , and car@@ ve something nice and beautiful out of their 9@@ 21 kil@@ o pum@@ p@@ k@@ in .

on late thursday evening , there was a room on the ground floor of the house .

germany &apos;s largest national church has an off@@ ensive to promote the profes@@ sion of pa@@ stor@@ al life .
background is a possible par@@ ish defic@@ i@@ ency : the go@@ spe@@ le@@ d-@@ lu@@ ther@@ an church han@@ over re@@ tains the right to a life of its present approximately 1@@ 800 pa@@ stor@@ alists .
for today &apos;s young people , the profes@@ sion is very attractive and offers good prospects , said pa@@ st@@ or ma@@ this bur@@ fi@@ en ( 43 ) in con@@ vers@@ ation with the ev@@ angel@@ ical press service .
it is attractive to have a look at the work@@ flow and the daily rout@@ ine .
with bur@@ fi@@ a , the regional church has for the first time a pa@@ st@@ or in a full place in which to prepare young people for the@@ ology studies .
at present , fewer and fewer young people are choosing to study the@@ ology after gradu@@ ation .
bur@@ fi@@ a is leading this towards the process of sec@@ ul@@ ar@@ isation : &quot; god &apos;s voice is quiet , the world is l@@ oud &quot; .
the profes@@ sion of great freedom and diversity is a factor .
i am mr of my calendar and i can set my priorities where i feel it is important .
pa@@ st@@ ors could be very close to the people as a sor@@ cer@@ y .
they earned as much as teachers and could well live on it .
certainly , in the free economy , more money is being paid , but the@@ o@@ logi@@ ans would have a safe employ@@ er for that .
this is something that i am able to meet today &apos;s young people , who are not only concerned with career but also with a job that is a job that is a lot of work in a spirit of de@@ eds .
according to the national church , which has three quarters of lower sa@@ x@@ ony , around 60 p@@ est patients in the ru@@ he@@ m are currently reti@@ ring every year .
at the same time , some 40 gradu@@ ates of a the@@ ology studies start their vi@@ k@@ ari@@ at .

fire bri@@ g@@ ade to save a bit@@ ch that has been thro@@ wn 15 meters above the ground on a dangerous rock edge in a stone quar@@ ry .
co@@ ck@@ er@@ sp@@ ani@@ el bit@@ ch ru@@ by was a member of the german police after a minor traffic accident .
three days later , she was taken by a wal@@ ker in the quar@@ ry in her predic@@ ament position discovered by a st@@ one@@ break wal@@ ker in her predic@@ ament .
fire@@ figh@@ ters ro@@ lled on ro@@ cks and saved the ho@@ o@@ ded dog from the safe death of the human being .
the fire service managed to get a dog in safety .
the nine months old co@@ ck@@ er@@ sp@@ ani@@ el bit@@ ch ru@@ by was born after a traffic accident on sunday afternoon and survi@@ ved three days alone , before she was on wednesday .
scot@@ t al@@ der@@ son , 25 , and his gir@@ l@@ friend bec@@ ky hall , 20 to whom the dog belongs , came to the quar@@ ry fla@@ pp@@ it in den@@ hol@@ me , west yor@@ k@@ sh@@ ire , to ru@@ by again .
they desper@@ ately lost their lost bit@@ ch , and they were forced to cr@@ y for help in social networks when they were looking for the small road accident in the quar@@ ry .
around 2 : 15 pm on wednesday , a walking man , who had his dog , saw the dog that was str@@ an@@ ded ru@@ by on the 15@@ m high paragraph in the quar@@ ry .
the technical rescue team at cle@@ ck@@ he@@ at@@ on fire station e@@ il@@ te z@@ ur ste@@ l@@ te and ro@@ pe to rescue rub@@ ys from the ground up .
and@@ y cla@@ y@@ ton , specialist in the technical rescue team , said : “ she was in a dangerous situation .
it was in the middle of the rock wall – 15 meters from the top and the bottom .
she did not move mus@@ cles during her rescue – she was like sti@@ ff fro@@ zen .
but now it is doing well .
she then took a few dog ca@@ kes .
this was a rather unusual effort .
the fact that the dog was discovered is incredible .
peter la@@ u , specialist in the technical rescue team , said : “ ru@@ by had a giant sl@@ ash . ”
there was a possibility that she was seriously in@@ ju@@ red or worse .
ru@@ by was brought to the examination of the veter@@ inary sur@@ ge@@ on , who had no knowledge of anything except exhaus@@ tion and de@@ hy@@ dr@@ ation .
bec@@ ky hall from h@@ ali@@ fax , west yor@@ k@@ sh@@ ire , said : “ in rescu@@ ing , watching was fri@@ ghten@@ ing . ”
i could not believe that they really were up there .
it was wonderful to see them back in the poor .
the veter@@ in@@ arian explained that if exhaus@@ tion became too big and it had collap@@ sed , it would probably have cr@@ ash@@ ed .
the fire@@ figh@@ ters have done a great job .
it was really cour@@ ageous what you did .

george ke@@ rev@@ an : european un@@ bun@@ d@@ ling gives sco@@ ts the choice of a choice between europe and the sco@@ ts .
a new day , a new story of terror about independence .
this time we are war@@ ned that an independent scotland is needed to be able to join the schengen area as a condition for eu membership .
this is the key word for stories about pass@@ port controls in ber@@ w@@ ick and a story about the “ ti@@ ger ” border , secured with bar@@ bed wire .
indeed , the stra@@ th@@ cl@@ y@@ de proposal referred to the possible economic benefits that more freedom of movement could bring to the rest of europe , but this was – as expected – a major factor in the head@@ lines .
nor did anyone mention that eu member states often fail to comply with their strict rules when it comes to making it more favourable .
as scotland is not part of the schengen area at the moment , continued non-@@ compliance for brussels would be a small conc@@ ession in return for the things that we really expect of the sco@@ ts .
so , really not a story .
and one that had already come in such a way that they already had a fo@@ ssi@@ l like : the first time i had the “ independence means pass@@ port control ” -@@ duc@@ k was heard at least 40 years ago .
one interesting point in this connection is the constant repe@@ ti@@ tion of this ancient history .
why should we talk about an independent scotland , when the european pi@@ pe is used ?
why the london yo@@ ke against the brussels system is , especially now ?
these are the real european news : the great post-@@ war peace plan to un@@ ite europe has st@@ alled .
with the euro crisis , the european project has officially died .
across the eu , parties are gaining ground that are ho@@ sti@@ le to the eu or that want to throw the euro out as a common currency .
even in germany , the euro@@ s@@ cep@@ tic party could not establish alternative for germany – only this year – for almost five million votes in the german federal election in september , and thus effectively support free democrats ( the equivalent ) .
there has always been domestic opposition to the plan to create a federal europe .
the current economic crisis , however , is turning out to be a turning point .
the berlin and european central bank imposed strict au@@ ster@@ ity policies , combined with the stra@@ it@@ jack@@ et that the government of the individual national economy is forced to invest in by stic@@ king to the single currency , obli@@ ge many people to believe that the project .
the euro crisis has little to do with national governments ’ excessive fiscal deficits – the result of only greece ’ s .
instead , the euro@@ system has set its members on exchange rates that are too high for german ex@@ porters – and we would like german politicians to leave that to be the case .
without the possibility of de@@ valu@@ ing the local currency , southern europe will find itself with a buil@@ t-@@ in productivity dis@@ advantage compared to germany .
the only way to do this is to cut wages and public spending , sp@@ ur@@ red on by berlin .
behind the current budget and monetary problems lies a de@@ eper problem in european productivity growth .
as a result of the “ green ” energy directives – a code for the sub@@ ven@@ tion@@ alisation of french and german energy companies on the expense of consumers – the european industry pays a price compared to the united states .
this is a cri@@ p@@ pling cost dis@@ advantage , as we have already seen in gran@@ man@@ ou@@ th .
all the world &apos;s wage fix@@ ing systems protect the european petro@@ chemical industry from being subjec@@ ted to cheap american sh@@ ale gas .
as a result , a re@@ vol@@ t is coming up , particularly in france , the former che@@ er@@ leader of the eu .
after the war , the french political elite saw the eu as a vehicle for bringing about a change in germany .
but berlin no longer needs paris as a ga@@ te@@ way to political legitimacy and has pus@@ hed europe into its own economic policy , which is the b@@ low of the french economy .
the result : marine le pen &apos;s right-@@ wing , anti-@@ eu front national has just launched a decisive election .
the national front is now the most popular party in france with 24 % of the elec@@ tor@@ ate – a timely warning to the british labour party that it will not assume that the election will be a ri@@ ft in the right spectrum would automatically benefit .
what makes le pen so popular with the white fran@@ ces ?
it wants to use next year &apos;s eu elections to create an anti-@@ eu , anti-@@ community monetary blo@@ c in the european parliament .
if the anti-@@ eu parties do well in these elections – and this is very possible – then the first such blo@@ c could be the european parliament .
this is the point i want to make : in the not too dist@@ ant future , the growing res@@ ent@@ ment against the eu and the single currency will un@@ ite to abol@@ ish the euro .
the eu will not dis@@ appear , but it will be more like the “ europe of ( sovereign ) nations , ” the general de ga@@ ul@@ le fav@@ ored .
germany and some of its satellite economies may be st@@ uck with the euro , but france and southern europe are becoming their own curren@@ cies .
i expect britain to distance itself from this project in the hope of becoming a member of the united states .
but washington ’ s growing interest in the pacific region suggests that britain alone could not achieve a “ real ” outcome .
where is scotland in all this ?
we can decide to create a region of ( ultimately ) small england .
or we can defend our own economic interests – including berlin and brussels – that is what they are trying to do .
i susp@@ ect that scotland could be in a loo@@ ser european union .
cooperation with other similar thinking countries is essential in a non-@@ federal europe of nations .
otherwise , we should consider equ@@ ating it with norway and maintaining our economic independence .
the sn@@ p government in scotland is – remark@@ ably – a leader in the most successful political movement against au@@ ster@@ ity in europe , and has played a spectacular majority in 2011 , owing to the rejection of the proposed ( and made ) cuts .
it would be ri@@ dic@@ ulous for scotland to op@@ t for independence now just to be excluded from berlin and brussels .
early pub@@ er@@ ty : more rapid growth will be achieved .
a@@ fro@@ -@@ american and h@@ is@@ pan@@ ic girls tend to reach pub@@ er@@ ty rather than their white con@@ tempor@@ aries , as studies show .
physical changes do not mean the pub@@ er@@ ty of the human being .
there is no evidence that hor@@ mon@@ es or other chemicals are responsible .
experts believe that the ep@@ ide@@ mic of ob@@ es@@ ity is a cat@@ aly@@ st of early pub@@ er@@ ty .
the trend towards early pub@@ er@@ ty is less pron@@ oun@@ ced among young people than in young people .

“ i spend a lot of time re@@ ass@@ uring parents – usually this is not a sign that now a new pu@@ ber@@ ity is emerging , ” explains dr. k@@ ap@@ lo@@ wit@@ z .
obvious indic@@ ations of development , such as growing bre@@ asts , sh@@ am@@ an and ar@@ mp@@ it hair , and body sm@@ ell , are early on in girls .
nevertheless , there was only a s@@ light shift in the age of men@@ ar@@ che ( the first ble@@ eding occurred ) in the last 40 years .
in the united states , the average age is 12.@@ 5 years , slightly less than 12.@@ 75 in 197@@ 0 .
“ when bre@@ asts develop , it takes at least two to three years to reach the men@@ ar@@ k , ” said k@@ ap@@ lo@@ wit@@ z , also author of the book “ early pub@@ er@@ ty in girls : the essential coun@@ sel@@ or to this .
time is the most exact test of how pub@@ er@@ ty progres@@ ses .
it is controversial about what actually means the beginning of pub@@ er@@ ty , but it is about “ ear@@ ly-@@ har@@ v@@ est ” when bre@@ ast enlargement is accompanied by a growth sur@@ ge of eight years old .
in most cases , the process or stag@@ nation is slow@@ ing , something that is a pedi@@ at@@ r@@ ici@@ an .
if we move faster , tests could be replaced by en@@ di@@ k@@ ron@@ o@@ logi@@ sts so that serious problems like t@@ um@@ ours or cy@@ sts can be rul@@ ed out .
there are methods of treatment for dela@@ ying an early men@@ stru@@ ation and preventing another consequence : the pre@@ mature aging of the bone , the pre@@ mature aging of the bone , and the ultimately in@@ hi@@ b@@ iting growth and therefore small body growth in the cases .
the recommendations for a medic@@ inal or hor@@ mon@@ al therapy are based on the age of the child , the development speed , the growth rate and the emo@@ tional mat@@ ur@@ ity .
psycho@@ social aspects are also important .
k@@ ap@@ lo@@ wit@@ z is re@@ luc@@ t@@ ant about medic@@ ation , but he ad@@ mits : “ sup@@ pressing pub@@ er@@ ty can cause behavi@@ oral problems and the feel@@ ings of girls , unlike their age com@@ r@@ ades .
the other major problem is understand@@ able : parents simply do not want their very young dau@@ gh@@ ters to have the period .
&quot; they worry about the risk of pregn@@ ancy or how to reduce hygi@@ ene , &quot; said the president of the european commission .
“ it was a sho@@ ck , ” a woman re@@ members , whose daughter gets ten days of her life .
although there were initial signs and we were talking about men@@ stru@@ ation , it was not emo@@ tionally prepared .
she was fri@@ ghten@@ ed and ex@@ ci@@ ted from school to home because she was the first in her friend &apos;s circle .
there are many widely published the@@ ories about the causes of early pub@@ er@@ ty .
but there is no conclu@@ sive evidence that hor@@ mon@@ es are in milk or other food .
bo@@ ys , like girls , enter pub@@ er@@ ty earlier .
k@@ ap@@ lo@@ wit@@ z believes that the most convinc@@ ing pre@@ mise is the ep@@ ide@@ mic of ob@@ es@@ ity .
he supported the implementation of a study in 2001 on girls aged six to nine , who had a connection between body f@@ at and entry into the pub@@ er@@ ty .
other studies support this conclusion , but there are many other factors that could play a role .
in this country , afric@@ an-@@ american and h@@ is@@ pan@@ ic girls tend to reach pub@@ er@@ ty rather than their white con@@ tempor@@ aries .
there are different explanations for this .
global , early pub@@ er@@ ty seems to be influenced by all sor@@ ts of things , from economic conditions to climate to gen@@ es .
another pu@@ zz@@ le : although bo@@ ys are the face and sh@@ am@@ an hair earlier , the trend is too high to become a full former pu@@ b .
other a@@ ap conferences have highlighted the complexity of the problem of the issue .
the appearance of ac@@ ne and sh@@ am@@ hair is even common in bab@@ ies and inf@@ ants .
“ we must be careful how we can prevent the true beginning of pub@@ er@@ ty , ” said dr. law@@ rence sil@@ ver@@ man , a pa@@ edi@@ at@@ ric grand@@ father of the american medical profes@@ sion .
parents should not hesitate to contact their pedi@@ at@@ r@@ ici@@ an for advice on how to talk to their child .
“ this can mean that you can have to talk earlier than expected , ” said k@@ ap@@ lo@@ wit@@ z .
if you are calm , the child usually re@@ acts well .
girls who blo@@ om early need insurance , which the process is a normal part of life , even if it used to be thought .
jum@@ bo manufacturers argue against the need for a seat width of the seat in the face of large orders , with large orders over seat width and height .
there is no need for a dispute between leading aircraft manufacturers about the width of seats in the tourist class for long-@@ hau@@ l flights , which is a good example of a bit@@ ter cl@@ ash on the du@@ ba@@ i air@@ show this month .
the dispute re@@ vol@@ ves around the seat width , the passengers on long flights in the tourist class offered is – not always those who are trying to get the airlines to the best , but this is the area that is shown to be the key to them .
airbus requested a branch standard this week which includes a se@@ ating width of at least 46 cm ( 18 in@@ ches ) in the tourist class .
the dispute comes at a time when the aircraft buil@@ ders are strugg@@ ling to make even larger versions of their two-@@ engine long hau@@ l fin@@ s .
like the re@@ ar part of the aircraft , especially if it is ro@@ ws with nine or ten seats , the crucial factor is the economic results indicated , which the new “ mini job ” will bring .
bo@@ eing claims that its moder@@ ni@@ zed “ 7@@ 7@@ 7@@ x ” f@@ ass@@ a is 4@@ 06 people in tourist class seats over 17 in@@ ches wide .
airbus says that the compe@@ ting version of the a3@@ 50 carri@@ es 3@@ 50 passengers in 18 in@@ ches wide seats in the tourist class , with nine in each row .
aircraft gi@@ ants often share a technical detail through advertising in the specialized press from the industry .
now airbus is appe@@ aling to the du@@ ba@@ i air@@ show , where the 7@@ 7@@ 7@@ x will be the race with more than 100 orders , and will be directly to the public .
recently , the company presented an advertis@@ ement that marks the start of a new ad war and which could give don@@ ors a picture of three people being squ@@ an@@ dered in a restaurant that is not mentioned in the title : “ would you accept the system ? ”
&quot; bo@@ eing proposes long-@@ hau@@ l flights in seats that are closer than regional tur@@ bo pro@@ ps , &quot; says airbus president .
with a change in di@@ et , people become th@@ ick , but aircraft seats have not rad@@ ically changed .
between the early 197@@ 0 ’ s , when the bo@@ eing 7@@ 47 launched the modern long-@@ distance journey , and the end of the century , the weight of the male average american between 40 and 49 years has increased by 10 % .
the wa@@ ist range of the male average american in the 21st century is about 10 % , according to us health statistics .
airbus says that its ri@@ val is in line with a concept of se@@ ating from the 195@@ 0s , when the average body size of the newly b@@ ap@@ tiz@@ ed “ jet set ” was nar@@ ro@@ wer .
according to airbus , research has been carried out which showed that an additional customs duty ( 2.@@ 5@@ 4@@ cm ) per seat would reduce the sleep quality by 53 % .
bo@@ eing den@@ ies the figures from airbus to the se@@ ating capacity and says that it is not at the discre@@ tion of manufacturers to decide how airlines should balance the airline ’ s fa@@ res and arrangements .
the company also says that according to studies the experience in the aircraft is from more than the seat width .
“ it really is about giving airlines flexibility to make the right decisions , ” says ste@@ ph@@ en sch@@ mid@@ t , president of the commission .
they do not want us to dict@@ ate to them what they are making prof@@ itable .
you know your business better than anyone else .
passengers are concerned about more el@@ bo@@ ws , but for manufacturers it will increasingly be difficult to find a solution to the problem of sales .
behind the argument stands a race for aircraft orders with an estimated volume of at least $ 700 billion , based on list prices , in the coming decades , which has a lasting impact on the us or europe ’ s export balance .
as re@@ u@@ ters reported in july for the first time , the seat layout is the driving force behind the debate about the new je@@ ts .
both airbus and bo@@ eing hold 20 percent more efficiency per seat at their latest two-@@ engine long-@@ range aircraft design .
bo@@ eing ’ s statements about the results depend in part on the 7@@ 7@@ 7@@ x having its ten seats per row mat@@ ched the original design of nine seats in the 7@@ 77 .
the increased cost per unit is still lower than that of currently used machines with ten seats per row .
&quot; bo@@ eing therefore squ@@ ee@@ zes more seats in its aircraft to make it more competitive to our products &quot; , says ke@@ v@@ in ken@@ ist@@ on , head of passenger services .
on the other hand , analy@@ sts say that full cab@@ ins with ten seats per row in existing 7@@ 7@@ s indicate that many passengers are in favour of closer arrangement , which would mean cheaper fa@@ res .
“ eigh@@ teen in@@ ch seat width would be great for passengers , but the reality is that from an economic point of view , the airbus a3@@ 20 family is dependent on the threat from the 7@@ 77 . ”
airbus and bo@@ eing do not offer seats , but a catalogue of suppliers , from which the airline companies can choose .
the world travel@@ ers jet vend@@ ors even carry a band@@ width to make the establishment competitive .
even if you are a guest of comfort , all manufacturers offer je@@ ts with high comp@@ acting capacity .
airbus has an a3@@ 50 with ten@@ -@@ se@@ ater ro@@ ws , but has not yet sold them .
until recently , airbus stressed the importance of making cab@@ ins more adap@@ table and providing a wide range of seats for some je@@ ts .
without the support of the only other manufacturer of large modern je@@ ts , experts say that the call for a new industry standard is likely to be rever@@ sed , but the wave of 7@@ 7@@ x sales could di@@ str@@ act .
new anti-@@ nic@@ ot@@ ine vacc@@ ine could give the pleasure of smoking a ga@@ it .
scientists have developed an anti-@@ nic@@ ot@@ ine vacc@@ ine that is a good way to spo@@ il the fun of smoking .
a single do@@ se of the vacc@@ ine could save m@@ ice from nic@@ ot@@ ine ad@@ diction for a life@@ time .
before testing on humans , further experim@@ ents are needed , which can take several years , but professor ron@@ ald crystal of the we@@ ill cor@@ n@@ ell medical college in london will be saying that the first results are good .
“ we are very hope@@ ful that this type of vacc@@ ination strategy will once help millions of smo@@ kers who have tried to stop smoking , while keeping all the methods available on the market tried to do so , but we have seen that their nic@@ ot@@ ine .
the new vacc@@ ine contains a harm@@ less virus that has been modified to prevent the genetic information on the production of nic@@ ot@@ ine in@@ sec@@ ts .
the virus selec@@ tively inf@@ ects li@@ ver cells , which then generate a constant stream of anti@@ bodies .
the anti@@ bodies hun@@ t the nic@@ ot@@ ine mo@@ lec@@ ules in the blood and neutr@@ alize them , before they can destroy the brain .
in experim@@ ents , vacc@@ inated m@@ ice , which nic@@ ot@@ ine was ad@@ min@@ istered , kept their normal level of activity .
m@@ ice without vacc@@ ination , on the other hand , would have taken a “ time@@ -@@ out , ” the researchers said , a sign that nic@@ ot@@ ine has reached its brain .
the experim@@ ents are available in the fac@@ tual journal science trans@@ la@@ tional medicine .
earlier tobacco vacc@@ ines failed to produce a vacc@@ ine that was designed to contain anti@@ bodies .
vacc@@ inations had to be used to maintain the anti@@ body level as often as possible , and were expensive and un@@ practical .
but the cost of the new vacc@@ ine is probably much lower , because it trans@@ forms li@@ ver cells into anti@@ body fac@@ tories .
as professor crystal said , a future european im@@ mun@@ e vacc@@ ine , if it is perfectly certain that children are being ad@@ min@@ istered before they are temp@@ ted to use a ci@@ gare@@ tte , could be a source of death .
more likely , however , smo@@ kers would use it to stop .
“ you then know : if you start smoking again , you feel the same as you do , because of the nic@@ ot@@ ine vacc@@ ine , and that helps you to change the hab@@ it ” , explains al@@ f@@ red .
british scientists said that the results were interesting , but at the same time war@@ ned that further research was needed .
tri@@ po@@ di den@@ ies , influenced by o@@ be@@ id , that he was influenced by o@@ be@@ id , and that he was a member of the tri@@ po@@ di family .
the former minister of the labour party , jo@@ e tri@@ po@@ di , from new south wal@@ es , is being accused of a investigation by the state &apos;s corruption inspec@@ tor@@ ate .
the former minister of the n@@ s@@ w den@@ ies that the rules on maritime le@@ asing were amended at the request of his political ment@@ or ed@@ die o@@ be@@ id , who was in charge of conce@@ aled investments in three controlled land on state@@ -@@ owned land .
the independent commission has been working on the new project for the international financial services industry since 2001 .
now , the acc@@ us@@ ation is being made that tri@@ po@@ di has been used by o@@ be@@ id &apos;s hidden interest in the land after tri@@ po@@ dy &apos;s earlier death .
in many years of talks that began in 2005 , the government had respon@@ ded to public tend@@ ers for le@@ asing contracts .
the pe@@ ers were opposed to this and also wanted longer mat@@ ur@@ ities .
in 2009 , le@@ asing contracts were awarded to companies at the circu@@ lar qu@@ ay , which ann@@ ually awarded the o@@ be@@ ids 2.5 million dollars without any public tend@@ ering .
tri@@ po@@ di , who was a port minister from february 2006 to november 2009 , had originally spoken out in favour of public tend@@ ers .
but he with@@ dre@@ w from making the changes at the request of o@@ be@@ id , who , as tri@@ po@@ di confirmed , insi@@ sted on re@@ forming the le@@ asing arrangements of the government .
one of the ic@@ ac ’ s written telephone letters showed discussions from august and september 2007 between o@@ be@@ id , tri@@ po@@ di and ste@@ ve dun@@ n , a senior official who was sent to the port ministry after he was under o@@ ath .
&quot; was this the subject discussed in these telephone conver@@ sa@@ tions the development of commercial packaging regulations ? &quot; he asked the depu@@ ty commissioner .
“ no , ” tri@@ po@@ di rep@@ lied .
i cannot remember what was discussed , but that was definitely the case .
definitely not between me and mr o@@ be@@ id .
israeli figh@@ ter plan@@ es attack targets in syria , as official sources suggest , and the us military sources say , “ the military is the official source of the war . ”
israeli hun@@ ting plan@@ es would have a destination in the sy@@ ri@@ an port of lat@@ ak@@ ia on thursday night , confirmed a senior government official in relation to fox news .
the official did not explain what the objective was , but said that it was at least one .
according to the associated press , the aim was russian sa@@ -@@ 12@@ 5 missi@@ les .
at least twice this year , israel has already tri@@ g@@ ge@@ red bom@@ b@@ ings on missi@@ le deli@@ veries in syria .
foreign workers with 4@@ 57 vis@@ as could be “ tested for authentic@@ ity ” .
the government is thinking about a “ real ” test in the context of extended measures for foreign workers with 4@@ 57 vis@@ as .
if the test is introduced , it would have a criteri@@ on that would prevent the member states from taking the 4@@ 57 to the post of un@@ skilled jobs or as a back door to the entry of family and friends to australia .
today , a government proposal for discussion has been published after the previous labour meps , ma@@ x@@ ine m@@ ck@@ ec@@ he@@ v , had read the government &apos;s comments on foreign workers .
“ l@@ oud statements like , foreign@@ ers should sit back and , austr@@ ali@@ ans first set , ” are a very un@@ pleasant set@@ back in times when the trade unions have a protected labor market . ”
histor@@ ically , this meant that white workers were protected , and that if some in the region were to receive an echo of this historic ar@@ te@@ fact , it would be a mistake to me .
the proposal for a debate out@@ lines twelve measures that were form@@ erly proposed by former minister for immigration , chr@@ is bow@@ en .
immigration minister bren@@ dan o &apos;@@ con@@ nor , who yesterday called for talks on human s@@ mu@@ gg@@ ling in s@@ ri lan@@ ka , has accepted five of the recommended amendments that other will be re@@ considered .
if the ‘ authentic@@ ity ’ criteri@@ on is adopted , then someone who has a visa could be able to apply for it to be checked whether ‘ the application is valid in cases where it is not possible for the applicant to comply with the visa ’ .
companies could also be obliged to account for the number of 4@@ 57 visa holders .
meanwhile , a 3@@ 5-@@ year-@@ old s@@ ri lan@@ k@@ an asylum see@@ ker probably died at a heart attack after he had been killed this week with a refugee boat on christmas island .

austr@@ ali@@ an authorities took the man to christmas island hosp@@ ital@@ . he was star@@ ving .
the british government has announced a study which will examine the benefits of the h@@ s@@ 2 rail project for scotland .
in the work of h@@ s@@ 2 ltd is proposed to start from the beginning of phase 1 in 20@@ 26 high-@@ speed connections between scotland and the north of england .
minister of transport , bar@@ on@@ ess k@@ ram@@ er , said that the project “ will bring britain closer together ” .
the scot@@ tish minister for transport , ke@@ ith brown , said that he was very pleased to work with the british government on this plan .
phase 1 consists of a new high-@@ speed rail link between london and the west mid@@ lands .
after phase 2 , there will be connections to man@@ ch@@ ester and le@@ eds .
in june , the government correc@@ ted the estimated costs of building high-@@ speed road between london and n@@ ord@@ eng@@ land from 3@@ 2.@@ 7 billion p@@ ounds to 4@@ 2.@@ 6 billion p@@ ounds .
the british government , which in talks with transport scotland , has h@@ s@@ 2 ltd charged h@@ s@@ 2 ltd with seeking further capacity and travel time improvements for n@@ ord@@ eng@@ land and scotland .
this includes the possibility of a travel time of at least three hours or less from gl@@ as@@ go@@ w and ed@@ in@@ burgh to london .
bar@@ on@@ ess k@@ ram@@ er said : “ our goal for h@@ s@@ 2 is a truly national network of routes that brings britain and its cities closer together . ”
we use h@@ s@@ 2 to move forward because it brings enormous advantages .
without it , we are facing a capacity crisis in our rail network .
but it is also about the link between 18 british cities , including gl@@ as@@ go@@ w and ed@@ in@@ burgh , which is being improved thanks to h@@ s@@ 2 .
the scot@@ tish secretary of state , ali@@ sta@@ ir car@@ michael , said : “ today ’ s announcement is good news for scotland . ”
on behalf of the scot@@ tish government , ke@@ ith brown car@@ michael called for “ un@@ ambigu@@ ous ” commitment to the scot@@ tish integration into h@@ s@@ 2 networks .
brown said : “ the high-@@ speed railway link carri@@ es enormous potential for economic benefits for scotland . ” at the same time , the economic power of scotland is an argument for fast rail links across the uk . ”
we are therefore pleased to be able to work as a partner of the british government and to discuss the options for a high-@@ speed rail link in scotland which will bring benefits to all and strengthen the gl@@ as@@ go@@ w-@@ ed@@ in@@ burgh link , which will strengthen scotland .
i look forward to the report being examined with the british ministers next year and to working together to take the next steps .
regulations on electronic equipment in aircraft remain in force in australia for the time being .
austr@@ ali@@ an passengers must continue to use tab@@ lets and smar@@ t@@ phones at start and lan@@ ding , despite efforts in the us to make the rules for such devices more relaxed .
the us federal aviation administration ( fa@@ a ) enables us airlines to carry out their requirements , so that passengers can access the aircraft during critical flight ph@@ ases e-@@ boats .
during most of the flight , passengers are already permitted to do so , but many people find it an@@ no@@ ying that they are not allowed to use their e-@@ books when they start and land .
austr@@ ali@@ an societies are watching the decision that the us airlines are trying to implement in a huge amount of work , but have no immediate plans to change their rules .
the aviation safety authority casa also stated that the announcement of a new aircraft was being made , but stressed that the restrictions on the use of electronic equipment in critical flight ph@@ ases in australia remain valid .
“ casa has no specific regulations regarding the use of electronic equipment on board aircraft , ” said the president .
this subject is subject to provisions that companies can maintain and protect safety at any time and passengers who are not covered by the safety instructions given by cab@@ in crew .
vir@@ gin has already started with casa talks about extending its wi-fi network to include the use of flights , and has declared that it is open to change , this would have to be approved by the legisl@@ ator .
“ we would like to see a review of the licen@@ sing of electronic devices by casa , because we are convinced that this would improve customer experience after we have ( wireless ) been able to use the internet during the flight , ” said a member .
q@@ ant@@ as said that for the time being , they will remain in the current rules .
“ our current guidelines provide that electronic devices may be used during star@@ t-@@ up and lan@@ ding , and we currently have no plans to change this , ” said the company .
the fa@@ a rules apply to us airlines .
we are , however , always interested in developments in regulations that can benefit passengers and we will be aware of the fa@@ a decision and the reasons behind it .
the decision has a negative impact on us companies depending on the age of the fleet .
they must prove that their aircraft have detec@@ ted the radio distur@@ ban@@ ces caused by mobile devices , and manu@@ als , training materials , hand bag@@ gage programmes and customer training .
“ after an airline has confirmed the tolerance of its fleet , it can allow passengers to use port@@ able , light electronic equipment such as tab@@ lets , e-@@ book book@@ lets and smart card reader .
in rare cases , when the crew is in a bad position , the passengers are instruc@@ ted to take off the equipment while lan@@ ding .
the group also recommended that he@@ avi@@ er devices be safe@@ ly placed under the seat or in the subjects on start and lan@@ ding , either under the seat or in the subjects .
in front of the re@@ vi@@ er@@ der@@ by against sch@@ al@@ ke had travell@@ ed b@@ v@@ b tra@@ il@@ ers with light missi@@ les for u@@ g@@ ly scenes in the vel@@ t@@ ins arena .
bor@@ us@@ sia dor@@ t@@ mun@@ d announced that har@@ sh consequences would be felt .
before the friday game of the bun@@ des@@ lig@@ a football league against the v@@ f@@ b stutt@@ gart , the ul@@ tr@@ as respon@@ ded with a silence - first .
it was an un@@ familiar , almost g@@ ho@@ stly ac@@ ous@@ tics that turned to the vie@@ wer until just before the beginning of the bun@@ des@@ lig@@ a game between the german vice champi@@ on bor@@ us@@ sia dor@@ t@@ mun@@ d and the v@@ f@@ l .
the audience was mostly fans of the guest with their sing@@ ing .
the southern gallery , on the other hand , where the fa@@ i@@ th@@ ful - and lou@@ dest - b@@ v@@ b fans stand , initially presented themselves with excep@@ tionally quiet : no sing@@ ing , no slau@@ ghter calls .
the po@@ dest@@ y of the cap@@ o , who otherwise coordin@@ ates the joint in@@ fu@@ sion , remained un@@ occupied .
and at the front of the grand@@ stand , a large f@@ lan@@ k of sol@@ it@@ ary wh@@ ist@@ led , calling it &quot; the prohibi@@ tion of sta@@ dium &quot; .
only as go@@ al@@ ke@@ eper roman we@@ iden@@ f@@ ell@@ er , as always , was the first b@@ v@@ b player to enter the place , bur@@ ned short ju@@ bil@@ ation .
when his team members followed , there were vo@@ cal vo@@ ices and vo@@ cal sh@@ ales - but far from everywhere .
in the central blocks 12 and 13 of the southern gallery , nothing was bo@@ thered .
the fact that sta@@ dium spo@@ kes@@ men nor@@ bert dic@@ kel once again re@@ affir@@ med the positive experiences of the last few days - der@@ by victory , victory over ar@@ sen@@ al , extension of contract by tra@@ iner j@@ ür@@ gen k@@ lo@@ p@@ p - did not make a holiday .
only five minutes before the initial attack , the cap@@ o kno@@ c@@ ked his po@@ dium - and the hi@@ ther@@ to almost with hands tangible claims .
the last thing that was said was that the southern gallery was the turn - and at last , as usual , it was the lou@@ dest place in the sta@@ dium .
and at the latest when the south tri@@ bun@@ e had the lou@@ dly calling &quot; der@@ by@@ si@@ e@@ ger is standing &quot; , the new album was again as usual .
the silence before was probably a reaction to what happened in the last few days .
just before re@@ vi@@ er@@ der@@ by at f@@ c sch@@ al@@ ke 04 , some of the co@@ ach tra@@ il@@ ers had been carrying light missi@@ les into the vie@@ wers ’ ran@@ ks and onto the square - almost tor@@ hu@@ ts .
the game was played due to the cha@@ otic scenes be@@ la@@ tedly .
b@@ v@@ b-@@ bo@@ ss h@@ ans jo@@ achi@@ m wat@@ z@@ ke had the tips of the dor@@ t@@ mun@@ d ul@@ tr@@ as in his office - and believes he is wat@@ z@@ ke &apos;s words , was this for the fan representatives rather a problem .
&quot; it will be massive for the entire ul@@ tra-@@ movement , &quot; says the president of the b@@ v@@ b bo@@ ss on thursday evening at a po@@ dium meeting .
as an emergency measure , wat@@ z@@ ke banned the ul@@ tr@@ as from a cho@@ re@@ o@@ graphy for the home match against the v@@ f@@ b stutt@@ gart .
&quot; i for@@ bi@@ dden that , &quot; he said .
the zero tolerance policy on py@@ ro@@ techn@@ ics is not something we can give up .
in addition , the ul@@ tr@@ as have been shown various ways of pun@@ ishing - they now have time to decide on one by tuesday .
otherwise , wat@@ z@@ ke argu@@ es , the b@@ v@@ b will be a soft power by the end of next week .
&quot; this is going to be very serious &quot; , assured wat@@ z@@ ke .
we can look forward to seeing how the re@@ actions in the southern gallery will then be .
p@@ f@@ and@@ haus bo@@ om@@ ing in sing@@ apor@@ e , as the middle class crisis has arrived , and the crisis has been growing in the middle class .
in a p@@ f@@ and@@ house in the b@@ end@@ ec@@ e@@ er shopping centre in sing@@ apor@@ e , jan@@ ani am@@ ir@@ th@@ al@@ ing@@ a is ex@@ changing a golden arm@@ re@@ if , ring and a few ear@@ r@@ ings to pay the school fees .
“ my hus@@ band and i have just bought a house , and my money is in it , ” says am@@ ir@@ th@@ al@@ ing@@ a .
although they receive 3@@ ,000 sing@@ apor@@ e dollars ( ca 1,@@ 7@@ 30 euros ) each month as an administrative employee and their hus@@ band also work , the monthly sal@@ ary of the family does not suff@@ ice , she explains .
indeed , in parts of south-@@ east asia – where debt is lower – demand for capital is so great that val@@ u ’ s government , where it is forced to exchange , has not reached the third lo@@ an this week .
the ple@@ d@@ ging of je@@ well@@ ery is not only a quick way to get money – 1,@@ 300 sing@@ apor@@ e dollars in the case of jan@@ ani am@@ ir@@ th@@ al@@ ing@@ a – but also almost as favor@@ able as a foreign exchange .
typically , p@@ f@@ and@@ haus in sing@@ apor@@ e require an effective annual rate of 17 % , which is just above the 15@@ .@@ 4 % that un@@ ve@@ iled the united over@@ seas bank demands .
however , p@@ f@@ and@@ h@@ ä@@ user offers the advantage that no review of cred@@ it@@ wor@@ thin@@ ess or income evidence is required , which is why loans are possible faster than banks .
that is why millions of people in the region are turning to p@@ f@@ and@@ als , after families have been able to cope with the pressure of rising cost of living and increasing household and consumer debt .
after five years of robust growth since the global financial crisis and cheap credit from lo@@ ose fiscal policies in advanced economies , families with low income and poor people are looking for p@@ f@@ and@@ als to be used for star@@ t-@@ up economies .
this week , the rating agency called standard &amp; poor &apos;s growing budget debt , which mainly reflects rising inflation , and the rise in the risk of a crisis in the l@@ ending of asian banks .
mal@@ ay@@ sia , thailand , and sing@@ apor@@ e , according to the agency , have the highest levels of household debt in asia relative to gross domestic product .
mal@@ ay@@ sia stands at 80 % of gdp , a rise of 60 % , still in 2008 .
econom@@ ists are also concerned about the high level of consumer debt in thailand , which is just about to come out of a technical recession this week .
on thursday , the data showed a continuing export weak@@ ness and a reduction in consumer demand .
“ in the end , this means that , with rising costs , mid@@ d@@ le-@@ se@@ gments ( the income gap between the rich and the poor ) will try to supple@@ ment their income wherever possible . ” says son@@ g sen@@ g sen@@ g .
historic gold prices pe@@ aks in the last two years have increased the trend of ple@@ d@@ ging personal items .
in sing@@ apor@@ e , about 70 % of the ple@@ d@@ ged items are in the city ’ s 200 deposit houses of gold .
people say , “ gold is a good thing , let us have grand@@ mother ’ s gold chain , and let us return next month . ”
the largest th@@ ai p@@ f@@ and@@ haus operator , eas@@ y@@ money , has established a 20@@ -@@ percent increase in customer loy@@ alty in its branches in recent months .
growth in the p@@ ond business is so strong that valu@@ em@@ a@@ x , the operator of the b@@ end@@ ec@@ eu@@ er branch and 15 others in sing@@ apor@@ e , is not only investing in neighbouring mal@@ ay@@ sia – where it is – where .

rescue package of over 3@@ 25 million austr@@ ali@@ an dollars for tas@@ man@@ ian health care .
the austr@@ ali@@ an government insi@@ sts on the hard conditions that the b@@ ail@@ out of over $ 3@@ 25 million of austr@@ ali@@ an dollars has imposed on the tas@@ man@@ ian health system to ensure that the government of the state does not lose the money .
the federal minister of health , t@@ any@@ a p@@ liber@@ se@@ k , has announced that the comm@@ on@@ wealth will take “ immediate action ” to a@@ ver@@ t a crisis caused by an aging population of the island state , a higher quota to health .
the funding for a four-@@ year period was agreed after intergovernmental consul@@ tations with the independent tas@@ man@@ ian me@@ p andre@@ w wil@@ ki@@ e .
“ the government has announced an emergency rescue package , ” says ste@@ ph@@ en , who , in our view , is addressing the unique challenges facing the federal state . ” p@@ liber@@ se@@ k explained today .
the 3@@ 25 million dollar bill is a package of $ 31 million in emergency aid for electoral services .
the new system will be able to operate more efficiently and effectively through a further 26@@ 00 operations , including or@@ tho@@ pe@@ dic operations and treatments for gre@@ y star .
there is also money for day@@ -@@ clin@@ ics in ho@@ b@@ art and laun@@ ce@@ ston , better post-@@ hospital care , and more efficient care for patients .
“ these investments cor@@ respond to the ideas that i was told by clin@@ ici@@ ans that they were the best way to get the tas@@ man@@ ian health system to improve , ” said t@@ any@@ a p@@ liber@@ se@@ k .
the minister insi@@ sted on a strict reporting and accountability policy of the tas@@ man@@ ian government .
the state must maintain the current level of funding to finance comm@@ on@@ wealth funds .
a three-@@ member commission will be set up to ensure that the federal state provides healthcare services as effectively and efficiently as possible .
as wil@@ ki@@ e said today , the $ 3@@ 25 million would do little if “ they were not accompanied by real reforms that would undermine the public tas@@ man@@ ian health system to a more sustainable course . ”
nevertheless , he p@@ raised the government for respon@@ ding to its request for urgent assistance , which he first made to the prime minister at the beginning of may .
“ i am confident that federal aid will make a major contribution to improving public health systems in the federal state from the list of concerns , ” said wil@@ ki@@ e .
according to the government of the state , these electoral benefits will largely off@@ set the recent cuts .
but the eu ’ s opposition spo@@ kes@@ man on health policy at federal level , peter du@@ tt@@ on , believes that today ’ s announcement is just a “ pav@@ ing solution . ”
“ we are therefore in a position today because the laboratory government has made $ 4@@ 30 million out of the health system , ” he said to ab@@ c tv .
it is unacceptable for a state government to spend almost half a billion dollars out of the system and give the comm@@ on@@ wealth $ 300 million .
du@@ tt@@ on called on p@@ liber@@ se@@ k to guarantee that not a single dollar of the b@@ ail@@ out package would be spent on additional bureaucracy .

syria has made its ability to produce chemical weapons , so a monitoring group has said , and the un monitoring group has said so .
syria has important chemical and chemical weapons manufacturing facilities .
on thursday , too , a sy@@ ri@@ an acti@@ vis@@ t group announced that more than 1@@ 20@@ ,000 people have been killed in the middle east since the civil war began .
the announcement by the organisation for the ban on chemical weapons ( op@@ c@@ w ) came a day before the date of the date of the day before the date of the date of the day before the date of the day on 9 february .
1 november , which the h@@ ague based organization d@@ aim@@ as@@ k@@ us set , to take all the facilities for the manufacture of chemical weapons .
the conclusion of this process , which is basically the first stage of destruction , is an important mil@@ est@@ one in an ambitious timetable , which is aimed at destro@@ ying all chemical weapons in syria .
the destruction of the facilities means that syria will no longer be able to produce new chemical weapons .
dam@@ as@@ c@@ us , however , still needs to start using the existing weapons and stocks .
it is estimated that there are approximately 1@@ ,000 tonnes of chemicals and weapons in the country , including mu@@ d gas and ner@@ vous gas sar@@ in .
the announcement came at a time when fighting was going on thursday in the city of sa@@ fir@@ a , from the experts say that there is a production facility for chemical weapons and storage facilities .
the group of activi@@ sts who have a network of activi@@ sts in syria to track the number of deaths declared on thursday , 1@@ 20@@ .@@ 2@@ 96 people dead .
of these , 6@@ 1,@@ 0@@ 67 civili@@ ans , including 6@@ ,@@ 3@@ 65 children .
on the government side , 2@@ 9.@@ 9@@ 54 of them were president bas@@ ha@@ r as@@ sad ’ s army , 18@@ ,@@ 6@@ 78 of which were pro-@@ government figh@@ ters and 18@@ 7 leban@@ ese he@@ z@@ bol@@ lah mil@@ i@@ ti@@ as .
among the dead , also 2.@@ 20@@ 2 deser@@ ted army soldiers and 5@@ ,@@ 3@@ 75 soldiers of the opposition , many of them foreign@@ ers .
on 25 july , the un estimated the number of deaths in this conflict since march 2011 to be 10@@ 0,000 .
this number has not been updated yet .
the conflict has led to the ev@@ asion of some two million people .
as@@ sad ’ s troops have been fighting for weeks in sa@@ fir@@ a against the re@@ be@@ ls , many of whom have links with al-@@ q@@ a@@ ed@@ a groups .
the centre said that it had suffered losses on both sides on thursday , but did not mention details .
the fighting under@@ lines the danger posed by the chemical weapons inspec@@ tors , because their mission to liber@@ ate syria from its huge po@@ is@@ on@@ ous ar@@ sen@@ al is a race against time in the mid@@ st of a dead@@ ly civil war .
according to the op@@ c@@ w , which co@@ operates closely with the united nations , the team is “ now convinced that it will support all the important production and mix@@ ing / filling facilities mentioned by syria and mi@@ ti@@ gate their destruction . ”
therefore , “ no further inspection activities are planned at this time . ”
earlier this week , the inspec@@ tors said they had completed the first round of checks and 21 out of 23 of the 23 inspec@@ tors listed by dam@@ as@@ c@@ us .
due to security concerns , two institutions were not allowed to visit , the inspec@@ tors said .
on thursday , the op@@ wc stated that the two sites were “ abandoned ” according to sy@@ ri@@ an saying , and the chemical weapons program ’ s objects there were transferred to other a@@ fore@@ mentioned facilities , which were in@@ sp@@ ected . ”
it was not immediately clear whether the site in sa@@ fir@@ a was one of the two institutions that had asked the op@@ c@@ w inspec@@ tors to visit .
syria has a plan for the complete destruction of its chemical weapons , which will be adopted by the executive committee of the op@@ wc next month .
“ i prefer to take care of bra@@ very and courage , which you all have to show in ful@@ filling the most challenging mission ever undertaken by this organisation .

in view of further developments , the head of the observation group , ram@@ i ab@@ dur@@ ra@@ h@@ man , said that there was a strong explo@@ sion in an air defence facility in the sy@@ ri@@ an coastal province of lat@@ ak@@ ia on wednesday .
the cause of the explo@@ sion is not known , he explained .
an@@ ger at bom@@ bing of bal@@ i
survi@@ v@@ ors and rela@@ tives of the 20@@ 2 people killed in 2002 in the bom@@ b attack in bal@@ i were re@@ acting to the an@@ ger of the ruling on the last of the in@@ sti@@ g@@ ators who came to justice .
pa@@ te@@ k , who was almost ten years old as one of the most sou@@ the@@ ast asian people on the run , was yesterday re@@ war@@ ded for his role in building explo@@ sive bodies for the bom@@ bing .
with a suspension , it could be released after 15 years .
the 4@@ 5-@@ year-@@ old was accused of mass murder for the attack on the island of two night clubs in the popular tourist district of k@@ ut@@ a , where the city was home to 20@@ 2 people , including 88 austr@@ ali@@ ans .
a guil@@ ty claim was also made in a series of terrorist charges , which included a wave of sp@@ am and a number of other terrorist attacks on churches in indonesia .
the public prosecu@@ tor had a life@@ time sentence , even if it was not sufficient for the man who was sent@@ enced to death for his reputation as a master@@ -@@ bom@@ ber .
the decision has pain@@ ful mem@@ ories at june cor@@ teen .
the first of her works was in the early 19@@ 3@@ 0s , when she was a member of the national library of music .
i really believe that he should be in the foot@@ steps of the other gu@@ ys .
&quot; you should protect him from a sho@@ oting command , &quot; cor@@ te@@ en said to a@@ ap .
i have to live every day with my being un@@ married and i mean my dau@@ gh@@ ters .
the sar@@ i club was ground level when the first world war was held on 12 october 2002 , shortly after 11 p.m. , in a small lo@@ ad@@ er , which was in front of the night club .
peter hu@@ gh@@ es was in pad@@ dy &apos;s bar , where only 20 seconds earlier a su@@ ici@@ de bom@@ ber used a bom@@ b with explo@@ sive force .
he fell a month after the attack and was “ star@@ ved ” three times , while he was working on a life conservation system .
hu@@ gh@@ es said pa@@ te@@ k deserves the same fate as the three other members of the j@@ em@@ a@@ ah islam@@ i@@ ah terrorist cell – am@@ ro@@ zi , mu@@ kh@@ las , and i@@ ma@@ m sam@@ u@@ dr@@ a – who are fighting for it .
really , this type should have the death penalty above all else .
to keep it alive – no , there is no reason to keep it alive .
after 20 years of having killed 20@@ 2 people and many hundreds of in@@ ju@@ red , is not much .
pa@@ te@@ k is the last of the bal@@ i bom@@ bers to be tried .
he es@@ cap@@ ed almost a decade of arrest , but was eventually released in january 2011 in the pa@@ ki@@ stan@@ i city of ab@@ bot@@ tab@@ ad , where us forces were deplo@@ ying the former al-@@ q@@ a@@ ed@@ a chief , sam@@ o@@ a , bare@@ ly four months later .
during the negotiation , a f@@ bi agent said that intelligence reports would make the evidence that the government had not changed its mind in pakistan .
“ he did not stand up , ” cor@@ te@@ en said .
until recently , he has shown no re@@ mor@@ se for the suffering he has inf@@ lic@@ ted on other people .
the ruling was made before the t@@ enth anniversary of the attack this year , which was marked by comm@@ em@@ or@@ ations in bal@@ i and australia .
“ this year , there will be many te@@ ars , ” said cor@@ te@@ en .
pa@@ te@@ k can appeal against his judgment .
fa@@ a : passengers can now buy electronic equipment on aircraft ( but no mobile phone calls ) .
passengers can now travel from the departure to the lan@@ ding using their electronic devices for reading , working , playing , listening to music and using the image of films , but not tele@@ ph@@ oning with the mobile phone , according to the new guidelines that will be published on thursday by federal aviation on thursday .
but passengers should not expect these changes to be implemented immediately .
how quickly they would be implemented depends on the airline concerned , f@@ a@@ a explained hu@@ er@@ ta on a press conference .
the airlines must prove to the fa@@ a that aircraft comply with the new guidelines and that they have read the flight crew training manu@@ als and the rules on sto@@ wing equipment in accordance with the new rules .
the fa@@ a said that it has already received plans from some airlines to ban the use of port@@ able electronic equipment in aircraft .
among these airlines were del@@ ta and j@@ et@@ blue .
“ depending on the state of the plan , we could use the extended use of electronic devices very soon , ” said the fa@@ a in a statement .
currently , passengers must use smart phones , tab@@ lets and other devices when the aircraft is not closed .
they are not allowed to re@@ start them until the plane reach@@ es a height of three kilometres and the captain has the green light .
when you enter the lan@@ ding , you must re@@ activate your flight and not re@@ start it before the aircraft lan@@ ded .
under the new directives , airlines whose aircraft are protected against electronic dis@@ rup@@ tions could allow their passengers to use the equipment at star@@ t-@@ up , lan@@ ding and on the roll@@ -@@ out field , declared the fa@@ a .
most new commercial aircraft and other aircraft that are intended for the use of wi-fi in larger hei@@ ghts are now in the market .
la@@ ura gl@@ ading , president of professional flight att@@ end@@ ants , welcomed the changes .
“ if the new regulation is safe@@ ly implemented – and we are working closely with the airline on this – both sides will benefit , ” comm@@ ented gl@@ ad@@ ding .
we are frank@@ ly ti@@ red of being treated like a pat@@ ron on this issue .
nevertheless , internet connections to sur@@ f , exchange em@@ ail@@ s , text messages or download data below three kilometres remained prohibited , explained the question of the authority .
passengers are requested to use smart phones , tab@@ lets and other devices in flight mode .
so still no &quot; words with friends &quot; that sc@@ ra@@ ps the word with friends .
and he@@ avi@@ er devices like lap@@ top@@ s must continue to be stored , as there is a risk of in@@ jury if they are flying through the cab@@ in .
mobile calls during the flight remain prohibited .
the regulatory competence for telephone calls is with the federal communications commission ( f@@ p@@ 7 ) .
fa@@ a may lift the ban on certain electronic devices when they are launched and lan@@ ded .
last month , mark ro@@ sen@@ ker said from the national transport safety authority that the safety board was a safety expert for national transport issues on c@@ bs news , mobile phones are still considered a risk .
“ mobile phones are really a problem , not only because they potentially cause dis@@ ru@@ ption to navigation equipment , but because we are being told by the f@@ cc that trans@@ ferring from the air is also causing transmission ma@@ sts ” , says ro@@ ger .
a consul@@ tative committee of the industry , which was appointed by the fa@@ a to investigate this issue , recommended that the commission should take action on this subject last month .
in recent years , the pressure on the fa@@ a has increased , restrictions have been imposed on use .
cri@@ tics such as the democratic sen@@ ator cla@@ ire mc@@ cas@@ k@@ ill of mis@@ sour@@ i argue that there is no valid solution to security problems in the country .
the restrictions are also increasingly difficult to en@@ force , because the use of the equipment has become u@@ bi@@ qu@@ it@@ ous .
some studies have mentioned that up to a third of passengers are unable to switch off the equipment .
the fa@@ a began in 196@@ 6 to ban the use of electronic devices by air passengers after reports of mal@@ functions of navigation and communications equipment were replaced by pass@@ ports .
new aircraft are much more dependent on electric systems than previous generations of aircraft , but they are also as designed and built by the fa@@ a .
airlines already offer passengers a wide range of wi-fi services , if the flight is at an al@@ titude of only a few years .
the software that is custom@@ ized to wi-fi systems is also in@@ sensitive to the inter@@ fer@@ ing .
the vast majority of passenger aircraft should be used for the greater use of electronic equipment under the new directives , said hu@@ er@@ ta .
today &apos;s electronic devices generally give much less radio radiation than previous generations .
e-@@ read@@ ers , for example , only give off minimal radiation when they are sc@@ rap@@ ed .
but when downloading or sending data , the transmission values are stronger .
ad@@ voca@@ tes of eas@@ ing restrictions on equipment use are those who advoc@@ ate the use of equipment .
in 2011 , corporate employees invited a passenger plane full of kin@@ dle e-@@ reader and made a test flight to identify problems , but could not find out .
members of the fa@@ a advisory committee expressed mixed opinions about the need for a more effective and more efficient use of equipment .
dou@@ gl@@ as kid@@ d from the passenger association national association of airline passengers passenger airlines passenger said that he thought the inter@@ ference by the equipment was e@@ ager to be true , even if the risk was minimal .
other committee members said that there is only a few reports from pi@@ lo@@ ts , which are not responsible for any distur@@ b@@ ance of aircraft systems by the equipment , and most of them are very old .
the committee recommended that the fa@@ a should not allow pil@@ ots to fly in instr@@ um@@ ent@@ s-@@ lan@@ ding under bad vi@@ sibility .
a group from the travel industry welcomed the changes and called them reasonable adjustment for travellers , who are now well equipped with technology .
“ we are pleased that the fa@@ a recogn@@ ises that a pleasant passenger experience does not conflict with safety , ” said ro@@ ger do@@ w , ceo of the u.s. carrier .
the hotel is located in the heart of the old town of n@@ ord@@ see , in the middle of the old town of s@@ ü@@ d@@ ba@@ hn@@ hof .
a car park , which is connected to the coast by air rescue service , is exhaus@@ ted on a north sea dr@@ illing island .
the water r@@ al was closed last month with a helicop@@ ter to ab@@ er@@ de@@ en , where it was taken from the scot@@ tish animal welfare organization sp@@ ca in their rescue centre in allo@@ a .
col@@ in se@@ d@@ don , head of the center , said : “ this water r@@ al was probably a winter bird of migration from northern europe , which was driven by the strong win@@ ds over the north sea . ”
it seems that the exhaus@@ ted bird was looking for refu@@ ge on the dr@@ illing island .
he added : “ he could not continue flying , so we did not agree with the request for help . ”
when she was released , the water pur@@ ses were again fit and healthy .
is europe ’ s elite prepared to do business with britain ?
business for britain was founded in april with the intention of adap@@ ting the economy to the same level and defining what those who work for prosperity and work in britain want to do in our relations with the eu .
to this end , we have developed the largest and most comprehensive survey conducted by british economic leaders and asked them what they think about britain , the economy and the eu .
you@@ go@@ v asked about more than 1@@ ,000 business execu@@ tives who , in some cases , had the british business sizes , sectors , and regions .
the results of the survey will surprise many .
we have found that the vast majority of companies now operate outside europe and are specialized in countries that are modern@@ ising and growing , while the member states are not sta@@ tic .
they want to see new trade links with countries like china , india and brazil being fav@@ oured by government , rather than being confron@@ ted with the long and ex@@ hau@@ sting process that ob@@ sc@@ ure eu institutions are to reform .
asked for your opinion on certain legally regulated topics – from the anti@@ trust right to product legislation – the majority of economic leaders believe that the control of this key competences should be transferred to west@@ min@@ ster .
there was general dis@@ satisfaction about the internal market , because according to companies , the costs of brussels regulations have now been out@@ weigh@@ ed by the advantages of being part of europe ’ s trading area – even 40 % of large companies agreed to it .
finally , and this is probably the most important point , our survey of economic leaders showed that a clear majority was moving away from britain towards a change in the agreement and a relationship with the eu that is based on trade , not politics .
this re@@ alization , which is shared by companies of all sizes and leading groups , shows that the economy is heading for “ meaning@@ ful change , ” which will make the book@@ let of action return to britain .
it is a matter of a lot – a change in the agreement and better conditions for britain , 16 % would lead to a change of opinion in favour of keeping the eu in a referendum .
the prime minister should have no doubt : this survey shows that the british economy is lag@@ ging behind its plan for re@@ negotiations of the british conditions for eu membership .
it also shows that companies are excluded from re@@ negotiating a significant shift in power relations back to britain .
a better deal for the british economy is possible and increasingly necessary , after the eurozone has now entered into a closer economic and monetary union .
the priority must be jobs and growth in britain , as the result of our survey shows , what an increased focus on trade and economic fundament@@ alism for businesses is for the brussels approach to regulation .
alex@@ e@@ i mill@@ er of ga@@ z@@ pro@@ m calls pipel@@ ine in bulgaria the beginning of a new gas era in the new era of the european union .
the construction of the south stream pipel@@ ine in bulgaria is the start of one of the largest european energy projects , explained the ga@@ z@@ pro@@ m board .
“ today ’ s event is a mil@@ est@@ one : the construction of the bulg@@ arian section of the south stream gas pipel@@ ine , the largest and most important project in europe , has begun , ” said the ceo of ga@@ z@@ pro@@ m .
the project is a key element in the energy security of the entire european continent .
south stream is supposed to ensure more diversity in russia ’ s export routes through europe .
a dispute between ga@@ z@@ pro@@ m and its counter@@ parts in ukraine , where the majority of the russian gas is for europe , is a serious concern for a greater security of supply for conventional gas .
mill@@ er said that the direct link to bulgaria , a member of the european union , means that the countries linked to transit countries are not “ responsible for ever . ”
bulg@@ arian consumers receive gas from south stream at reduced rates , when the entire project is completed in 20@@ 15 .
according to ga@@ z@@ pro@@ m , construction work in other sub@@ ordin@@ ate countries is to be completed on the planned route at the end of the year .
the pipel@@ ine is limited to an annual capacity of 6@@ 2.@@ 3 billion cu@@ b@@ ic metres of natural gas .

hearing before the royal commission : two y@@ m@@ ca employees before alleg@@ ations against jon@@ a@@ than lor@@ d for sexual abuse .
two y@@ m@@ ca employees from new south wal@@ es ( n@@ s@@ w ) are charged with sexual off@@ ences related to children .
but the first statement before the commission was made by the y@@ m@@ ca that ‘ the organisation has never had to deal with an incident of sexual child abuse ’ .
managing director phil@@ li@@ p h@@ are was ques@@ tioned about a case in which a y@@ m@@ ca employee was accused of crimes with child por@@ no@@ graphy .
h@@ are said ga@@ il fur@@ ness , one of the commission assi@@ sting lawyers , that he was caught up in the first case , but he did not know the second .
he ad@@ mitted that the opening statement of the y@@ m@@ ca to the commission was also in@@ accurate in st@@ ating that ‘ it had external reviews , but it was not .
evidence before the commission shows , rather , that the y@@ m@@ ca has been informed that it has the second lowest rating of four possible in a quality audit of the department of education .
ha@@ res , who won the y@@ m@@ ca with 21 , ad@@ mitted that the management had “ let me take it down ” with the recru@@ it@@ ment of lord .
lord was at the beginning of the year accused of sexual off@@ ences against twelve bo@@ ys during his two years of work for the y@@ m@@ ca .
he was sent@@ enced to at least six years in prison .
but har@@ e dro@@ pped that the y@@ m@@ ca was a cultural problem that would prevent employees from using l@@ ord@@ s .
the staff said they had observed violations , including the fact that lord was alone with children , they were private as bab@@ y@@ sit@@ ters .
dani@@ elle oc@@ k@@ well , whose superior lord was and who was trying to train for child protection , was not able to attend the school because of his behavior , said that he was not .
the managing director said that he would not accept statements from employees that they were not d@@ ared to meet their superior notification .
instead , he said , they had rather lost their friend@@ ship with lord their judgment , which is why they did not have to report him .
h@@ are explained that he has sent a letter to the board of directors of y@@ m@@ ca n@@ s@@ w that the lesson the organization learned from the “ jon@@ a@@ than lor@@ ds interim incident ” is not a lesson .
h@@ are said the decision to force employees to sign confid@@ enti@@ ality obligations shortly after the alleg@@ ations were made was taken by the managing director of the y@@ m@@ ca child services , li@@ am wh@@ it@@ ley .
he said that this should prevent the evidence from being contam@@ inated , but that is ‘ too ze@@ al@@ ous ’ and po@@ or@@ ly implemented .
the y@@ m@@ ca n@@ s@@ w was in the time when jon@@ a@@ than lord was in the area between 2009 and 2011 , no organization safe for children , professor ste@@ ph@@ en sm@@ all@@ b@@ one of the gri@@ ff@@ ith group explained .
he explained that there are “ serious problems ” in the recru@@ it@@ ment , veri@@ fication , registration , training and supervision of employees .

f@@ ent@@ on was awarded the prize by the jud@@ ges for his natural skills in handling the p@@ ony , which was much above his age .
and to@@ ff@@ ee received be@@ st@@ marks for his appearance and person@@ ality .
f@@ ent@@ on had made to@@ ff@@ ee a gift last march for his third birth@@ day and since then has been working with the sh@@ et@@ land p@@ ony every day .
his mother , don@@ na , 30 , said : “ f@@ ent@@ on and to@@ ff@@ ee are a great ge@@ m . ”
they had to compete against the whole of the particip@@ ant field and are equipped with gold cup and ro@@ set@@ te .
it was only the second time that he had been compe@@ ting with to@@ ff@@ ee and we were all delighted to see him win .
completely foreign in the arena thought it was so phenomen@@ al that it could be photograph@@ ed with him .
the little boy from the village of nan@@ ty@@ gl@@ o near e@@ bb@@ w val@@ e , south wal@@ es , follows in the foot@@ steps of his a@@ un@@ t shar@@ on ho@@ wel@@ ls , who has been riding horses for over ten years .
ho@@ wel@@ ls told us : “ the whole audience was like electr@@ ici@@ zed and everyone fu@@ c@@ ked him and cl@@ ash@@ ed . ”
he ran on sand the entire length of the arena and although he was so tiny , he did have imag@@ in@@ ative work .
f@@ ent@@ on is cra@@ zy about animals – he lo@@ ves horses , trac@@ tors and farms and has two ch@@ ick@@ ens to make them .
as it has started , it will not take long for it to be on the horse of the year show – and i am sure that it will be good .
a spo@@ kes@@ man of the annual hor@@ se@@ -@@ show said , “ f@@ ent@@ on is only three , but he knows how to handle his p@@ ony . ”
together they are a great team .
the jury jud@@ ged f@@ ent@@ on and to@@ ff@@ ee how well they had be@@ aten and be@@ aten in the demonstration ring .
they are looking for good cooperation between pon@@ y and leader – and f@@ ent@@ on and to@@ ff@@ ee were the best in the ring .
i am sure that f@@ ent@@ on &apos;s sweet clothes have played their part in making this the perfect occasion .
chinese newspaper is to be “ re@@ formed ” after call .
a chinese newspaper , which is on the front page demanding the release of a re@@ porter who has been arrested for de@@ fam@@ ation , has been accused of being re@@ formed .
the peace process that is based in gu@@ ang@@ z@@ ho@@ u had a rare public call to release the gu@@ ang@@ z@@ ho@@ u journ@@ alist , chen y@@ ong@@ z@@ ho@@ u .
but chen later ad@@ mitted on television that he had taken bri@@ bes to report a partial government firm that had been fal@@ si@@ fied .
now the new express will be subjec@@ ted to “ comprehensive rec@@ ti@@ fication , ” explained the regul@@ ator .
the “ rec@@ ti@@ fication order ” was issued by the press and publications authority , radio , film and television in gu@@ ang@@ d@@ ong .
preliminary investigations have shown that the new export express , the one leading to the y@@ ang@@ chen@@ g evening news group , is between september 2012 and december 2012 .
“ the ed@@ it@@ orial management of the new express was dis@@ ordered , ” said the regul@@ ator in a statement .
she said that she decided to “ impose an administrative pun@@ ishment for chen y@@ ong@@ z@@ ho@@ u and to give him his re@@ porter license . ”
in addition , the y@@ ang@@ chen@@ g evening news group was instruc@@ ted to provide a full rec@@ ti@@ fication of the new express and recommended that the relevant officials be present at the new express and immediately take over the management team of the new express .
chen had published several articles for the new express , in which he reported alleg@@ ed financial ir@@ regul@@ arities at a construction machinery manufacturer called zo@@ om@@ lion .
after being arrested , the newspaper published two calls for his release .
but then chen appeared on state television , ad@@ mitting that he was sending out false reports against payment .
“ in this case i have damaged zo@@ om@@ lion as well as the entire news industry and its ability to restore public confidence . ” he said .
i have done so primarily because i am waiting for money and gl@@ ory .
i realise that i have acted wr@@ ong@@ ly .
following chen ’ s apo@@ logy , the new express issued an apo@@ logy on the front page , saying that it was failing to provide the reports correctly .
various susp@@ ects have recently been accused of having been conf@@ used on television .
experts say that conf@@ essions are still rout@@ ine , and that the commission is still in a state of emergency , despite a change in the law at the beginning of the year which for@@ bi@@ ds the authorities to force anyone to acc@@ use themselves .
drug tunnel with its own railway between the us and mexico has been disco@@ vering the effects of the war on the country &apos;s economy .
one of the most sophisticated tun@@ nels for drug s@@ mu@@ gg@@ ling between the us and mexico , which is completely covered by lighting , v@@ enti@@ lation and electric railway .
the us authorities described the 120 times 90 cen@@ time@@ ters tunnel as one of the most sophisticated fit@@ ting pass@@ ages they have ever found .
the tunnel that is in the zi@@ g@@ z@@ ag pattern for almost six football fields is a combination of ware@@ houses in the vicinity of ti@@ ju@@ ana , mexico , and san di@@ e@@ go , usa .
there are countless un@@ believ@@ able ware@@ houses in the area , making it easier to use drugs l@@ k@@ ws .
the tunnel was closed before drugs were trans@@ ported un@@ detec@@ ted , and the authorities declared .
when disco@@ vering the tunnel , eight and a half tonnes of mari@@ ju@@ ana and 14@@ 8 kil@@ o@@ gram@@ s of co@@ ca@@ ine were guaranteed , so the court &apos;s records .
three men who , according to the authorities , were working as drivers were sent@@ enced to death for having and selling mari@@ ju@@ ana and co@@ ca@@ ine .
they face a threat of prison sent@@ ences between ten and ten years of imprison@@ ment .
in no@@ gal@@ es , ari@@ z@@ ona , s@@ mu@@ gg@@ lers rely on an extensive underground network of ent@@ w@@ ick@@ lun@@ gs@@ can@@ len .
the tunnel is the eigh@@ th large pass@@ age that has been going on in san di@@ e@@ go since 2006 .
some of the largest tun@@ nels were built after the mari@@ ju@@ ana har@@ v@@ est in central mexico in october , which brought the drug car@@ te@@ ls to the challenge of quickly trans@@ forming their product to the consumer .
in 2010 , authorities took a pass@@ age of almost 6@@ 40 metres long , with rail@@ s that were moved from a kitchen in a residential house in ti@@ ju@@ ana to two ware@@ houses in san di@@ e@@ go .
or@@ lan@@ do blo@@ om and mir@@ anda ker@@ r still love to be in the company of the same family .

according to the le@@ x@@ icon , ve@@ gan@@ ism is subjec@@ ted to vege@@ tari@@ an@@ ism , but it diff@@ ers in a very significant way from it .
for while vege@@ tari@@ ans can afford to eat sa@@ h@@ ne@@ tor@@ te , ice or a strong eg@@ g , they can also be found in the restaurants .
milk , cheese , eg@@ g , besides the ren@@ un@@ ci@@ ation of meat and fish , the ve@@ g@@ ans ref@@ uses to eat any animal products - even hon@@ ey is denied .
what remains , one might wonder , but when we look at it more closely , the ve@@ gan food world is characterised by a considerable ing@@ en@@ u@@ ity .
&quot; bread spre@@ ads are very popular &quot; , explains ute hen@@ kel@@ mann , the owner of the local bre@@ wing house , who has a variety of special products for ve@@ g@@ ans .
also , re@@ u@@ ben proc@@ tor visits the shop at the dom@@ gas@@ se .
for 13 years now , the native new ze@@ al@@ and country ve@@ gan has lived , in lam@@ per@@ the@@ im he finds ( almost ) everything he needs to live on . &quot; in 1997 i re@@ organized my di@@ et and became vege@@ tari@@ ans &quot; .
at the turn of the century , the next step was taken and i became ve@@ g@@ ans .
&quot; the convic@@ tion came not only because of nutri@@ tion but also because of the choice of shoes , &quot; says proc@@ tor , the artificial leather pre@@ fers normal leather .
he realized that there are also problems in other everyday issues without animal products .
ve@@ gan is primarily an eth@@ ic .
&quot; i do not want animals to die for me , &quot; proc@@ tor spe@@ aks the ma@@ xi@@ m of ve@@ g@@ ans who are focused on all consumption behaviour .
instead of bur@@ gers , sti@@ r@@ ring e@@ gg@@ s or rubber bears , the ve@@ gan has quickly become a brand new product that inspi@@ res enthusiasm .
&quot; it &apos;s a double bonus , &quot; says proc@@ tor today , &quot; in fact ve@@ gan does not make his ren@@ un@@ ci@@ ation , not an as@@ c@@ es@@ is , but it &apos;s an en@@ rich@@ ment &quot; .
and it is these conditions that have made some people still so well-@@ inten@@ tioned attempts to fail .
&quot; the ad@@ diction factor is a very important factor that leaves many to give up quickly , similar to smoking , &quot; proc@@ tor makes a comparison .
and applies : &quot; certain tas@@ tes are not bound by the animal &quot; .
often it is the sp@@ ices or the type of preparation that will satisfy the taste .
&quot; you can also use the same effect in other ways , &quot; the ve@@ g@@ ans illu@@ str@@ ate .
the bar@@ bec@@ ue festival is held in the city of proc@@ tor , where au@@ ber@@ gin@@ s , mus@@ h@@ rooms and a few ve@@ gan sa@@ us@@ ages are also served .
it is a balanced , varied di@@ et , with a very good di@@ et .
of course , you want to have something between the te@@ eth , that is legitimate .
&quot; it should taste , but this is not only due to animal food , &quot; says pro@@ c@@ tor .
health damage , including eating dis@@ orders , another widespread as@@ sumption , has not been suffered .
for me , the change@@ over was a positive aspect .
i don &apos;t take a foreign cho@@ le@@ ster@@ ol and have an increased vit@@ am@@ in content .
there are high-@@ performance vehicles that are exclusively vege@@ table based on ve@@ gan .
&quot; my blood values are good , i let myself check often , &quot; reve@@ als proc@@ tor .
in particular , the lack of vit@@ am@@ in b@@ 12 war@@ ns many ve@@ gan@@ si@@ cs .
&quot; since animals are fed with feed rather than on the pa@@ st@@ ure , the animal is question@@ able whether the animal is fed in the meat that is stored in the ch@@ est that is vit@@ am@@ in b@@ 12@@ -@@ 50 .
for ve@@ g@@ ans , there is also the possibility to change the co@@ en@@ zy@@ me in the form of tab@@ lets .
&quot; my b@@ 12 values are fine , &quot; he explains .
proc@@ tor must be used for food procurement in large di@@ stances .
after all , basic food is available everywhere , and every super@@ market has now got so@@ ya milk and other products .
all i need is a local experience .
only occa@@ sion@@ ally i buy something special .
&quot; many people over@@ look that only the finished products are expensive , but that is how things are with &quot; ordinary &quot; finished products .
in any case , the preparation of ve@@ gan dishes is much cheaper and less time@@ -@@ consum@@ ing than usually assumed .
&quot; in the kitchen there is a lot to discover with a few small sn@@ acks you can find good , if not better results , &quot; says proc@@ tor .
mar@@ gar@@ ine instead of but@@ ter , a little more ba@@ king pow@@ der and carbon dio@@ xide instead of eg@@ g , with its ve@@ gan cheese ca@@ ke , proc@@ tor was able to ast@@ on@@ ish his s@@ ling@@ -@@ in-@@ law .
family celebra@@ tions give the ve@@ g@@ ans a new sp@@ ice .
this is dynamic when you co@@ ok together , it has a new meaning .
&quot; the situations that can arise in this are as different as the people themselves , &quot; says proc@@ tor .
of course , he has already been s@@ cep@@ tical .
taste my food no longer ?
&quot; should i feel bad now because i drink milk ? &quot; - with such empty milk i ask .
&quot; i do not reject people , i am part of this society , &quot; proc@@ tor does not want to be an enc@@ la@@ ve dead@@ lines .
and , more precisely , the everyday world does not seem as ve@@ gan@@ -@@ like as it would have been imag@@ ined - and the ve@@ g@@ ans are not so restricted in their daily lives as they are generally believed .
fast food is also permitted .
there are pom@@ mes everywhere !
&quot; many do@@ zen shops offer fal@@ a@@ fe@@ l , or even a vege@@ t@@ arian yu@@ f@@ ka , &quot; says proc@@ tor .
in a piz@@ zer@@ ia he is a pa@@ sta dish , or ordered a piz@@ za without cheese .
the restaurants are getting ready for it .
&quot; when i started to work for ve@@ gan 13 years ago , everything was still much more difficult &quot; , the new ze@@ al@@ and country can predic@@ t a development : &quot; you have to deal with people who are preparing to do so . &quot;
&quot; if there are enough requests , you might be inc@@ lined to change the menu &quot; , ho@@ ping he will .
ve@@ gan@@ e restaurants are developing , such as the man@@ n@@ heim com@@ bus@@ tion house or the vo@@ gel@@ fre@@ i café .
proc@@ tor wants to make other restaurants at least a ve@@ gan dish on the menu .
in fact , ve@@ gan dishes are available to everyone .
everyone can eat them , so they are exactly the opposite of exclusive .
&quot; meat dishes are exclusive , however , and in the tru@@ est sense of the word , because they exclu@@ de others , &quot; says proc@@ tor .
&quot; when we want to avoid food scand@@ als , ve@@ gan@@ ism is a safe way to treat the vast majority of the food from the outset &quot; says pro@@ c@@ tor .
ve@@ gan purch@@ ases can be a little difficult at the beginning .
especially when you learn to understand that is also used in pe@@ an@@ u@@ ts animal addi@@ tives as a color en@@ co@@ der , you seem to be satisfied with the eth@@ ics of so many obstacles and fall quickly of courage .
this is not the only reason why re@@ u@@ ben proc@@ tor and lars th@@ om@@ sen have written a book : &quot; ve@@ gan@@ is@@ sim@@ o - animal ingredients and their alternatives &quot; explains the many ingredients that produce food and also cleaning agents .
&quot; gradually , a scan@@ ning view is developed and we know which characters and lo@@ gos you have to pay attention to &quot; it is sometimes better to do small steps than to stand standing or st@@ um@@ ble &quot; , proc@@ tor knows .
ve@@ gan@@ ism , it is an important moral fing@@ er@@ tip , which is aimed at consci@@ ousness .
perhaps he does not quite manage to change his hab@@ its , but at least he can te@@ ach consumers to change their hab@@ its cri@@ tically .

in a communication , the operator made technical problems responsible .
the other 11 us option markets , including two of the nas@@ da@@ q om@@ x , continued their business un@@ h@@ inde@@ red .
the recent incident has resulted in a whole series of small and large break@@ down@@ s in the stock exchange operator .
only on tuesday were the in@@ d@@ ices of nas@@ da@@ q un@@ reliable because of data transport errors for an hour not calculated .
in august of this year alone , two break@@ down@@ s had occurred in a week .
first , the us investment bank gol@@ d@@ man s@@ ach@@ s had received massive def@@ ec@@ tive purch@@ ases to the options markets due to technical problems .
the stock exchange operators almost needed a full day to complete the order .
two days later , half of all us equity trading came to an end because of a computer break@@ down on the nas@@ da@@ q stock exchange .
in addition , last year , the stock market of fac@@ e@@ book had provided a boost .

british police are providing ass@@ ange with a re@@ ferr@@ al notice of ex@@ tradition to the united kingdom .
the british police have today issued a statement of ex@@ tradition to wi@@ kil@@ ea@@ ks founder ju@@ lian ass@@ ange , who was in charge of the ecu@@ ad@@ ori@@ an emb@@ ass@@ y in london .
scot@@ land yard said that the 4@@ 0-@@ year-@@ old austr@@ ali@@ an was being offered a “ call to face . ”
ass@@ ange is threat@@ ening to ex@@ tradition to sweden for charges of sexual crimes against humanity , after its ability to return to the country under british law has been exhaus@@ ted since the supreme court rul@@ ed out its opposition to ex@@ tradition at the beginning of the beginning of the month .
as he fe@@ ared that stockholm would send him to the us , he had a meeting in stockholm on 19 june in the ecu@@ ad@@ ori@@ an emb@@ ass@@ y and the south american emb@@ ass@@ y asked for political asylum .
scot@@ land yard has “ given a for@@ ty-@@ year old man a call to commit to a europe that we have chosen . ”
it continues to viol@@ ate the conditions of his release on ba@@ il .
the message did not comment on the delivery of the police request .
ass@@ ange fears that he will be sent from sweden to the united states and sent@@ enced there to death for possible sp@@ ying charges .

tax on foreign property owners against london ’ s spec@@ u@@ lative bu@@ b@@ ble
the treas@@ ury has provi@@ sion@@ ally adopted the c@@ g@@ t measure , but is still waiting for the final decision of sch@@ at@@ z@@ k@@ ell@@ er george os@@ borne to be taken in the 2012 budget .
already , the income from the st@@ amp tax on housing in the districts of west@@ min@@ ster and ken@@ sing@@ ton &amp; ch@@ el@@ sea , which is already higher than in the fiscal year 2012 / 13 , at £ 7@@ 08 million , is higher than that was paid .
co@@ ok said : “ after the increases in st@@ amp tax on high-@@ price housing and housing , and the introduction of the associated legislation against a circum@@ stance , it is hard to say that high-quality properties are too low , regardless of the impact of al@@ locations .
“ but this move could make some foreign investors more re@@ luc@@ t@@ ant to buy property in london , or to prevent owners from selling , ” he added .

scientists have been able to give more light to the context in which the tail di@@ zz@@ iness of a dog is related to its mo@@ od .
previous research showed that happy dogs are not allowed to co@@ ok more right with the tail ( from the point of view of the dog ) , while ner@@ vous dogs are more likely to get the left side .
but scientists now say that other dogs do not per@@ cei@@ ve these sub@@ tle differences and can react to them .
professor geor@@ gio v@@ all@@ or@@ ti@@ gar@@ a , a neu@@ ros@@ ci@@ enti@@ st of the university of tren@@ to , said : “ in man , it is well known that the left and right brain half react differently to stimul@@ i , which is positive or negative .
here we have tried to do this with other species .
he also noted that dogs , like humans , have the right brain half for the movement of the left side .
to learn more about how dogs are placed on the side sw@@ ings of their species , please visit the site of the bre@@ ed@@ ers who watch the animals while those films are directed by other dogs .
they measure the heart rate of the four-@@ leg@@ ged and analy@@ zed the behavior .
we will probably soon understand why the tail is in one place , sometimes in the other .
professor v@@ all@@ or@@ ti@@ gar@@ a said : “ we have given the dogs movies – either a natural ge@@ st@@ ure version or a silver version – to show off the de@@ fl@@ ec@@ tive other aspects .
when the animals saw how an otherwise un@@ expres@@ sive dog could get the tail to the right ( from the perspective of the we@@ av@@ ing dog from the perspective of ) , they remained completely relaxed .
but was the tail inc@@ lin@@ ation mainly left ( again from the perspective of the dog , the we@@ dge ) , so their heart rate rose and they sa@@ wed un@@ cal@@ mly .
professor v@@ all@@ or@@ ti@@ gar@@ a believes that the dogs do not inten@@ tionally communicate with each other through these movements .
rather , he is convinced that the dogs should have learned from experience , at which movements they should worry and when not .
he said , ‘ if you have different encoun@@ ters with other dogs and you want to we@@ dge your co@@ ck in one direction rather than friendly behavior , and the right side is more of a less friendly behavior , you react to the base .
researchers say that the findings are dog owners , who have been diagno@@ sed with the disease , and ve@@ ts and tra@@ in@@ ers have improved their emo@@ tions .
john br@@ ad@@ sha@@ w , expert on dog behaviour and guest schol@@ ar@@ ship at the fac@@ ul@@ ty of animal medicine of the university of bri@@ st@@ ol , said that this is not the first study that we are stu@@ dying whether this is true .
last year , a team of l@@ inc@@ ol@@ n university found that dogs head to the left , when they have an aggres@@ sive dog .
in another research at the university of victori@@ a in canada , the following was : “ dogs are more likely to go to a robo@@ t dog if their tail is left we@@ del@@ t and not right , rather than un@@ cal@@ mly .
he said that the differences could result from the fact that the dogs in the various studies are the animals in the films or the robo@@ t dogs are not interpreted as dogs .
a study on how dogs react to real dogs could help , he explained .
“ although there is considerable evidence of many different m@@ am@@ m@@ als that the two brain hal@@ ves are used for various purposes , they need to be more precise than many details – and dogs are not an exception , ” says bra@@ ds@@ son .
however , as their behaviour is easy to record , it will probably not take long for us to understand why the tail is sometimes in one , sometimes in the other , direction .

the rock band arc@@ tic mon@@ keys has an appearance in gl@@ as@@ go@@ w after their lec@@ ture in the new york city .
the band from sh@@ eff@@ i@@ eld was to be released on friday at hy@@ dr@@ o .
because of the ill@@ ness of the lead sing@@ er ale@@ x tur@@ ner , the concert must now be moved .
the announcement of the band came after they had already made an appearance at the l@@ g arena in bir@@ m@@ ing@@ ham on thursday .
in a statement on their official website , arc@@ tic mon@@ keys said : “ after the decision to stop the show in the l@@ g arena in bir@@ m@@ ing@@ ham this evening , and to stop at medical advice , the arc@@ tic must be .

po@@ pe franc@@ is ap@@ points the first car@@ din@@ al to be appointed in february .
po@@ pe franc@@ is will be the first to receive new car@@ din@@ als from the catho@@ lic church on 22 february , as the v@@ ati@@ can announced on thursday .
the car@@ din@@ als are the highest cl@@ er@@ ics in the catho@@ lic church after the po@@ pe and they are also the ones who have a po@@ pe , so that franc@@ is is can be the first group of men to ap@@ point .
there are currently 20@@ 1 car@@ din@@ als .
however , a car@@ din@@ al who is 80 years old cannot be brought to the po@@ pe &apos;s election – the result of a group of 120 “ elec@@ tor@@ ate car@@ din@@ als ” .
in a statement in which the news was announced , father feder@@ ico lo@@ om@@ bar@@ di said that he was speaking to the v@@ ati@@ can , that there would be a meeting of all car@@ din@@ als before the cere@@ mon@@ ies were held .
&quot; po@@ pe franc@@ is decided to change his decision to conven@@ e the convention , &quot; he said in advance .
j@@ ack val@@ ero of ca@@ th@@ ol@@ ic vo@@ ices said that the number of eligible car@@ din@@ als was rising by february .
he said that a po@@ pe normally ap@@ point as many car@@ din@@ als as necessary to keep the number of eligible po@@ lls in the top half of the country , and so many car@@ din@@ als about 80 , as he would like .
the consistency story next year is important because the us is the first since the election of francis@@ can mon@@ ar@@ ch in march .
at the moment there is a certain over@@ han@@ g on the part of europe and , in particular , italy .
“ it will be interesting to see if the new po@@ pe , car@@ din@@ als from the rest of the world , will be appointed to restore balance , ” he said .
for@@ ty per cent of ca@@ th@@ ol@@ ics live in south america , but they have only a tiny number of car@@ din@@ als .
the car@@ din@@ als will also be the first to have been held since the formation of the fran@@ z@@ is@@ k@@ us council of car@@ din@@ als , a group of eight car@@ din@@ als from the whole world , the council of europe .
in the past , the po@@ pe decided everything alone .
“ now franc@@ is has taken this eight car@@ din@@ als to help him , ” he said .
he said that it was “ possible ” that franc@@ is would not have the car@@ din@@ als for advice .
but we have not been in this situation – that is all very new .
val@@ ero said that typically the bis@@ ho@@ ps are from large places to car@@ din@@ als .

the bloc@@ k@@ ade policy does not exc@@ use the website problems of ob@@ am@@ ac@@ are , the dr@@ one attacks on the internet , the dr@@ one attacks on the internet , the dr@@ one attacks on the internet , the attacks on the internet , and the internet .
obama ’ s mem@@ o@@ irs of the 2008 election campaign are a sad remin@@ der of what might have been possible .
na@@ than@@ i@@ el p. mor@@ r@@ is is a student of the har@@ v@@ ard medical university in the second year .
i am currently reading a terrible book .
it is a book that i thought it would make me feel more at home during the mis@@ er@@ able second year of my medical studies .
it is called the aud@@ acity to win ( courage to win ) and describes the mem@@ o@@ irs bar@@ ack obama and his wife , bar@@ ack obama , for the 2008 presidential election .
when i talk to my patients &apos; records in the evening and go to bed , the book will take me back to a time when politics inspired millions and gave a speech the bre@@ ath .
the election became a lands@@ li@@ de victory and news spo@@ kes@@ man , in order to demonstrate the historic importance of this hour .
my class@@ mates we@@ pt with joy and my parents gathered all the newspapers they could find .
a young team of vi@@ sion@@ aries was on their way to the white house and the nation was ready for change .
when obama came into office in 2008 , he had received 8@@ 2 % approval rat@@ ings .
and then i close the book .
switch back to the present is a bad awa@@ k@@ ening , as if you were tor@@ n out of a dream .
it is difficult to remember these optim@@ istic times – they seem to be a v@@ ague memory , a sad m@@ our@@ ning of lost expectations , and a sad remin@@ der of the past .
in the years since i first voted , the european parliament has actually changed .
but it is just nothing i could have imag@@ ined .
i recognise the great and versa@@ tile things obama has achieved , from the adoption of the aff@@ or@@ da@@ ble c@@ are act to the health insurance act to the military withdrawal from the iraq war .
i agree that the party political bloc@@ k@@ ade tac@@ tic is too much to be desired .
but after having read the obama administration to colleagues and acqu@@ a@@ int@@ ances countless times , i am not satisfied with my attempts to explain .
i have one point of political des@@ pair .
the republic@@ an bloc@@ k@@ ade policy cannot explain why inter@@ cep@@ ting foreign state leaders is not allowed .
it cannot explain why the national security agency has to collect data on the private lives of americans and why wh@@ ist@@ le@@ b@@ low@@ ers are pun@@ ished , which are causing public mis@@ conduct .
it cannot explain why an@@ war al-@@ aw@@ la@@ ki , an american state@@ sman , was unable to be mur@@ dered without trial , nor why the public funding and spending limits were not abol@@ ished during the presidential elections .
it does not justify the results of a report which says that the white house &apos;s efforts to calm the media are the “ aggres@@ sive and ... the most aggres@@ sive since the ni@@ x@@ on government . ”
and , more recently , it cannot exc@@ use the in@@ ability to make a difference in the more than three years since the adoption of the affir@@ ma@@ tive care act .
i do not know whether it is what i should have expected .
whether i should have understood at 18 , that the government work is not in line with the previous political campaigns .
obviously , the me@@ p ’ s office is not a predic@@ table course , as an opposition party and acci@@ dental events such as the new@@ town@@ -@@ mass@@ ac@@ re shape public debate .
but when i look at the examples mentioned above , they seem to be largely elected by the government itself .
and that bo@@ thers me the most .
i re-@@ elected obama in 2012 , not because i was enthusi@@ astic about his candi@@ d@@ acy .
mit@@ t ro@@ m@@ ney has presented a conf@@ using and un@@ developed alternative , but he seemed to be moving in direction and positions .
i had the impression that a second term for obama , free of the pressure of future elections , would fulfil the hope that we have heard for so long .
but , with the fall in approval values for obama to below 45 % this week , returning to 2008 has been reduced by the har@@ der .
it awa@@ k@@ ens in me the long@@ ing for the many promises that have dis@@ appeared into th@@ in air .
this week i read a section in the book descri@@ bing how obama could prevent a severe loss against clin@@ ton in the pen@@ n@@ sy@@ l@@ v@@ ania pre-@@ election .
in a meeting with the electoral ai@@ des after the decision , he said to his staff that they had to get back on track and follow the purpose of their cause .
“ i want us to find our magic , ” he said .
we must remember who we are .
five years later , mr president , and i could give you more support .
the message expressed in this comment is exclusively the opinion expressed by na@@ than@@ i@@ el mor@@ r@@ is .
cli@@ ve pal@@ mer claims that prime minister ton@@ y ab@@ bot@@ t has had a conflict of interests over paren@@ tal leave .
the bil@@ li@@ on@@ air@@ e and member of parliament , cli@@ ve pal@@ mer , says that prime minister ton@@ y ab@@ bot@@ t would be in conflict with his plans for paren@@ tal leave because his dau@@ gh@@ ters are becoming pregn@@ ant and could benefit from it .
the mining mag@@ n@@ at , which is in a court dispute over the payment of $ 6 million in carbon tax , was the claim of the mining company asking questions .
the pal@@ mer united party could win up to four votes in the sen@@ ate , which are important for deci@@ ding whether the co2 and mining taxes should be abol@@ ished or reduced .
but pal@@ mer claimed that only ministers could have conflicts of interest , and that ab@@ bot@@ t ’ s dau@@ gh@@ ters would personally benefit from the laws .
“ he is in a major conflict of interest when it comes to paid paren@@ tal leave , because if one of his dau@@ gh@@ ters becomes pregn@@ ant , he has a direct interest in whether or not she gets a holiday , ” said pal@@ mer .
two months after the election , the pal@@ mer election commission announced 53 votes ahead after the re@@ count officially declared winner of the sun@@ shine day .
pal@@ mer called for a revision of the voting count process to allow it to proceed more quickly .
ton@@ y ab@@ bot@@ t ’ s dau@@ gh@@ ters , fran@@ ces and brid@@ get .
if these elections were to take place two months after the vote was over , then i would ask you to consider the matter .
“ we need a better system , ” he said .
why should we not have a system where we inv@@ ade , collect data in a computer , and then choose the system that is needed at 6 : 30 a.m.
pal@@ mer also cri@@ tici@@ zed the use of p@@ enc@@ ils when marking bal@@ lot papers .
if you use them , because you can er@@ ase the results if you do not like them ?
nowadays , voting with p@@ enc@@ ils is incredible .
the electoral commission has made a check on the options for electronic voting and recently adopted a joint legislative proposal with new ze@@ al@@ and .
pal@@ mer , 59 , explained that to his policy an international airport for the sun@@ shine coast belong@@ ed and that he had his new office “ very serious ” .
a public office is about serving the public .
“ we don ’ t seek re@@ wards other than those of history , namely that we are serving at a critical time of this community , ” he said .
r@@ bs sus@@ pen@@ ds two currency vend@@ ors
the royal bank of scotland has two deal@@ ers from its fore@@ x department suspended , so two people who are familiar with the situation ; this is another indic@@ ator of how the world economy is being held up by the mu@@ t@@ ters .
some of the world ’ s largest banks , including u@@ bs , bar@@ cla@@ ys , deutsche bank , and r@@ bs , confirmed that they had been working with the authorities in the world ’ s largest financial market , where 5.@@ 3 tr@@ il@@ lion dollars are spent daily .
the two vend@@ ors would be the first r@@ bs employees to be listed in the expanding investigation that the scand@@ al of the li@@ bor@@ -@@ inter@@ bank business has brought about .
the bank , which does not comment on the suspension , confirmed that the bank had not given a response to information requests from authorities this month .
“ our investigations into this subject continue and we cooperate fully with the f@@ ca and other regulatory authorities , ” said the bank before two weeks ago .
last month , the situation was reported to close people that the r@@ bs had not read the records of em@@ ail@@ s and inst@@ ant messages sent to and from a former mer@@ ch@@ ant to the uk supervisory authority , the financial congress .
this deal@@ er , richard us@@ her , had left the r@@ bs 2010 and is now to be replaced by his current position as european leader of fore@@ x spot trading at j@@ p@@ mor@@ gan .
ro@@ h@@ an ram@@ ch@@ and@@ ani , head of the european spot trading company at cit@@ i , was leave this week and mat@@ t gar@@ din@@ er , form@@ erly the leading currency trad@@ er at bar@@ cla@@ ys and u@@ bs , was awarded the standard this week .
none of these trad@@ ers has been accused of any kind of mis@@ conduct .
inst@@ ant mess@@ aging group of us@@ her included ban@@ kers at bar@@ cla@@ ys and the ci@@ ti@@ group , said the situation ’ s close friends .
u@@ bs announced this week that they are taking steps against some of their employees after the swiss regulatory authority fin@@ ma declared that they had a susp@@ ected breach of the law on fore@@ x when it was a number of swiss banks .
at least six authorities worldwide – the european commission , fin@@ ma , the swiss competition authority we@@ ko , the f@@ ca , the us justice department , and hong kong monetary authority – have been working on this .
h@@ s@@ bc , ci@@ ti@@ group , j@@ p@@ mor@@ gan and credit su@@ is@@ se have also initiated internal investigations or have received information requests from authorities , said with the situation familiar persons .
banks cr@@ ack through inst@@ ant messages and em@@ ail@@ s from several years in search of cases of mis@@ conduct .
the news of these investigations has been of great concern to deal@@ ers in an area which has been a major source of profit in recent years .
some ban@@ kers have tried to play down the aff@@ air and said that it is almost impossible to stop the extended and high-@@ level li@@ abilities of foreign exchange .
a leading trad@@ er noted that despite the enormous daily volume in fore@@ x trading , the frag@@ ment@@ ation of liqui@@ dity between the various trading platforms has not been elimin@@ ated and the increasing use of its own internal platforms has led to the creation of “ .
the news came out the same day as credit su@@ is@@ se announced that she had sent a re@@ tail@@ er of her london exchange tr@@ aded funds office this week .
the bank immediately informed the competent authorities and co@@ operates with them .
“ we are sure that the deal@@ er has acted alone and that the matter is being contained , ” said credit su@@ is@@ se .
the building f@@ ence on the be@@ ch@@ t@@ le p@@ lot pain@@ ts the original building p@@ lot .
a group of the citizens &apos; initiative &quot; sch@@ we@@ iz@@ er me@@ i@@ er &quot; has built the building f@@ ence on the be@@ ch@@ t@@ le p@@ lot on the spa promen@@ ade in bad her@@ ren@@ al@@ b .
moreover , the company clean@@ ed and wi@@ den@@ ed the foot@@ path , it is stated in a press release .
the planned covering of the dec@@ ay@@ ing house in the re@@ ar part of the property was not allowed for safety reasons , because the site is in danger of sli@@ pping off .
al@@ f@@ red ab@@ el , who currently man@@ ages the p@@ lot , had the em@@ bel@@ lish@@ ment action with his colleague rein@@ hard dom@@ ke of the bi .
before the bi ’ s action , a transparent message was sent out , saying &apos; we are in favour &apos; .
this distur@@ bed the 20 or so members of the citizens &apos; initiative little about their action .
your mo@@ tto on the big pos@@ ter was &quot; we are against building ru@@ ins &quot; .
in so doing , it wanted to respond to the danger of even greater ru@@ ins on the swiss me@@ ado@@ w - should the giant project fail one day .
in con@@ vers@@ ation with many pas@@ ser@@ s-@@ by before the &quot; construction site &quot; it became clear that some citizens believe that the city ’ s project will be better for many , although not many will have the same questions about the dimension of the presented project .
but they are beginning to re@@ sign because the city wants to delay these responses further , it is said by the bi .
as we have heard , public statements by the may@@ or also have an impact .
may had a meeting of the local council saying that he would do the same for the thermal bath if the population were to be against the plans for a bathing and spa bath complex at the ci@@ vic decision .
some seem to be therefore quite fri@@ ghten@@ ed , others find it &quot; cru@@ de &quot; .
the bi than@@ ked the don@@ ors for the color and all help@@ ers .
ran@@ gn@@ ick sh@@ ell@@ s for sch@@ ir@@ is : man@@ e is not a s@@ wal@@ low king , but a king of s@@ wal@@ lows .
so satisfied r@@ al@@ f ran@@ gn@@ ick with the current high shape of bun@@ des@@ lig@@ a table leader red bu@@ ll salzburg is , so disappointed showed his first appearance in the &quot; bu@@ lls &quot; of the sho@@ oting teams .
&quot; there is a dangerous trend now that man@@ e and al@@ an are being placed in the category of s@@ wal@@ low k@@ ings , &quot; he took the two off@@ ensive wi@@ gg@@ lers on thursday at a press conference in salzburg .
the latest occasion for ran@@ gn@@ ick ’ s critique was yellow for man@@ e at the 3-@@ 0 against gr@@ ö@@ di@@ g last sunday , when the sen@@ eg@@ al@@ ese was accused of acting as a crime - the free time .
&quot; a bl@@ at@@ ant mis@@ decision , &quot; ran@@ gn@@ ick said , the re@@ fe@@ ree har@@ k@@ am was called &quot; completely over@@ loaded &quot; .
har@@ k@@ am would also have contributed &quot; his part &quot; to the es@@ cal@@ ation between salzburg co@@ ach ro@@ ger sch@@ mid@@ t and gr@@ ö@@ di@@ g tra@@ iner ad@@ i h@@ ü@@ t@@ ter after the match .
his german comp@@ at@@ ri@@ ot , he def@@ ended : &quot; i would have been be@@ having like ro@@ ger sch@@ mid@@ t &quot; in every single situation .
sch@@ mid@@ t himself wants to be named after the hu@@ t with the h@@ ü@@ t@@ ter .
i do not know why .
&quot; for i am the one who was insul@@ ted , &quot; the 4@@ 6-@@ year-@@ old stressed .
given the success rate , ran@@ gn@@ ick agreed to a p@@ raise .
&quot; there are only two words for this : really good , &quot; he said .
there is not much to be said about .
in particular , the way in which the team plays is impressive .
that is the way it should continue .
k@@ ad@@ er changes in the winter transfer time will hardly be possible .
there are no great reasons to change anything .
&quot; except a player as@@ ks for his or her leave , &quot; he said .
supreme court confir@@ ms obama ’ s health law
it is a great victory for the obama administration : the us supreme court decided today to re@@ consider the issue closely with bar@@ ack obama .
by five to four votes , jud@@ ges rul@@ ed that the patient ’ s individual mandate was insufficient to protect and affordable care act – it forces us officials to take action by 20@@ 14 .
chief judge john ro@@ ber@@ ts suggested that the us should be divided into four more liberal members , while the jud@@ ges were s@@ cuba , thomas , ali@@ to , and ken@@ ne@@ dy .
the court also confirmed the remaining sections of the 27@@ 00 pages of the law and also represented the view that the provision of health law , according to which states may have to meet either the access requirements for medic@@ aid or all other state health regulations .
the legal proceedings against the law were conducted by 26 states and the national federation of independent states .
the law was signed by all the leading republic@@ an presidential candidates , including the ultimate challeng@@ er mit@@ t ro@@ m@@ ney , in the 2012 pre-@@ election campaign , strongly opposed .
norway : norway is a place where giant mir@@ r@@ ors of light and light are reflected .

this basic idea has been in existence since 19@@ 13 .
after several years of debate , the city council finally had the 5 million k@@ ron@@ er ( about 6@@ 15 000 euros ) expensive project .
a similar construction has been giving the italian alpine village vi@@ gan@@ ella a winter sun@@ shine for several years .
post bare@@ ly emp@@ ties on sunday
&quot; many citizens will not have noticed yet the red points for the sunday le@@ g are in the middle of various letters boxes .
a f@@ dp request confirmed this .
on sun@@ days and holidays , only before the post office building in ern@@ st-@@ lu@@ d@@ wi@@ g-@@ stra@@ ß@@ e 36 and in the j@@ ak@@ o@@ b m@@ ü@@ ll@@ er-@@ stras@@ se 1 in h@@ ü@@ t@@ ten@@ fel@@ d are emp@@ ti@@ ed .
whether in ho@@ f@@ heim and ros@@ eng@@ ar@@ ten , there is still sunday to be emp@@ ti@@ ed , the answer to the f@@ dp ’ s question will not be answered .
the social and youth political spo@@ kes@@ man of the f@@ dp , fr@@ it@@ z ro@@ h@@ ren@@ bec@@ k , wants to make up the minds here .
sunday empty is particularly important for termin@@ als .
&quot; this company is th@@ in on the ground despite the price increase for letters in january 2013 , despite the radical and un@@ reasonable increase in the price . &quot;
thomas bit@@ t@@ ner , fr@@ at@@ ern@@ - and stad@@ t@@ ver@@ b@@ und der liber@@ als , supports his group colleagues : &quot; what an@@ no@@ ys me is the fact that k@@ lam@@ m secre@@ tly uses the le@@ tting times to change or even delete .
from the point of view of the public , the post office is a long way from here .
&quot; at least the mail@@ boxes in the districts of neu@@ sch@@ lo@@ ß and ro@@ sen@@ gar@@ ten must be emp@@ ti@@ ed again on sunday &quot; , says bit@@ t@@ ner and r@@ ö@@ h@@ ren@@ bec@@ k un@@ is@@ on@@ o .
the city of applied , especially not mobile citizens , would also have to have a box with sunday empty on foot .
ro@@ h@@ ren@@ bec@@ k asked in the city parliament whether the city council had discussions with the post on this matter .
may@@ or er@@ ich ma@@ i@@ er answered that the post office did not communicate with lam@@ per@@ the@@ im .
to his knowledge , however , there are also a sunday lunch in ho@@ f@@ heim .

frankfurt parking charges should increase shar@@ p@@ ly .
parking in frankfurt could be very expensive .
the city of mag@@ i@@ str@@ ate this morning is discussing the sub@@ mission of traffic dec@@ ep@@ tive ste@@ fan maj@@ er ( green ) .
therefore , parking charges are to be increased by 50 % .
however , this is not to raise prices , but to increase the inter@@ val of time between parking and parking ticket machines from 30 to 20 minutes .
in december , the city ’ s governing council will have to decide .
the i@@ h@@ k frankfurt retail committee considers that &quot; not a good idea &quot; .
the parking facility just before the shop is &quot; a not to be un@@ de@@ res@@ ti@@ mated advantage for smaller re@@ tail@@ ers &quot; .
the transport club germany believes that an increase after two decades is &quot; perfectly reasonable and long over@@ due &quot; .
public transport will also be more expensive .
fre@@ u@@ den@@ stadt : fast actions are overwhel@@ ming hosts of the event .
with a narrow ve@@ il , mess@@ rs i of the ts@@ v fre@@ u@@ den@@ stadt had to be in the sch@@ ill@@ er school gym in re@@ ut@@ ling@@ en against the t@@ g gn@@ in@@ ingen from the sw@@ ab@@ ian al@@ b .
the el@@ ders were confron@@ ted with an experienced team on the other side of the net .
but soon it became apparent that she was able to cope with the rapid actions of the fre@@ u@@ den@@ st@@ ä@@ d@@ ter , also due to age factors .
with the hard and placed sur@@ charges , the pat@@ r@@ ici@@ ans did extremely hard .
repeatedly , they missed the promises made by sim@@ on sch@@ en@@ k and e@@ du@@ ard schul@@ z over the network center and attacks and were at the stand@@ still when it came to block defense .
two high first sentence profits clearly demonstrated the superi@@ ority of the fre@@ u@@ den@@ st@@ ä@@ d@@ ter in all aspects .
in the face of this crus@@ hing and gam@@ bling achievement , the third sentence was then slightly la@@ x and l@@ ack@@ lus@@ ter at the 3 : 0-@@ end ( 25 : 13 , 25 : 14 , 25 : 22 ) .
on 2 november , the tv ba@@ i@@ er@@ s@@ br@@ on@@ n , located in n@@ ag@@ old , will be a much more powerful oppon@@ ent in the field .

in the b class , the mur@@ g@@ tal@@ hal@@ le in ba@@ i@@ er@@ s@@ br@@ on@@ n had the second teams from ba@@ i@@ er@@ s@@ br@@ on@@ n and fre@@ u@@ den@@ stadt .
they delivered a highly competitive two-@@ hour match , and the result was a good one .
ner@@ v@@ ousness on both sides caused a lot of trouble and pun@@ c@@ ture gi@@ fts , especially during the bal@@ lo@@ on ; the accuracy of pass@@ ports was sometimes fla@@ wed and in some critical scenes prevented the super@@ ficial movement from taking a look .
in this high-@@ performance , very balanced meeting , the ts@@ v team of mar@@ c@@ us bl@@ as@@ u@@ tto consistently agreed the great physical effort and a strong sense of commitment of both teams .
care day at the small eng@@ land@@ er hu@@ t in the eng@@ land@@ -@@ hu@@ t
the fifth day of care in the after@@ mat@@ h of natur@@ a 2000 project on upper ho@@ tz@@ en@@ wal@@ d was attended by a group of dedicated participants at the small eng@@ lish@@ -@@ hu@@ t in i@@ bach .
on the basis of popular suggestions , the first step was to take a look at the valley in the area of the hu@@ t , said may@@ or hel@@ mu@@ t ka@@ is@@ er .
many hi@@ kers , ka@@ is@@ er said , described this area as the gl@@ am@@ our of the gor@@ ge , on which the landscape is the ideal setting for wonderful views of the valley .
he than@@ ked the att@@ end@@ ant for their willingness to cooperate and stressed that the day of care is a suitable tool for making the connection between man and nature stronger .
it gives every citizen the opportunity to become acc@@ ents themselves in nature .
at the same time , the tourism aspect could also be taken into account in terms of the environment .
this ecological aspect was explained by fri@@ e@@ deri@@ ke tri@@ bu@@ ka@@ it of the department of natural protection of the regional bureau of fre@@ i@@ burg following the welcome by the land@@ r@@ at ti@@ l@@ man bol@@ l@@ ach@@ er , who took over the pat@@ ron@@ age .

certain species , such as rare but@@ ter@@ f@@ lies and gr@@ ass p@@ ans , can break down barriers in the form of forest land .
you need these free connections to conservation .
tri@@ bu@@ ka@@ it said that she wanted to not miss it here , to take a l@@ ance to break for the planned bio@@ sphere area .
in this planning , the current measure not only se@@ am@@ lessly adds to it .
a bio@@ sphere reserve also offers the chance to achieve sustainable economic and environmental development .

google , sam@@ sung , hu@@ a@@ we@@ i because of nor@@ tel patents , has been su@@ ed for nor@@ tel patents .
the group , which had received thousands of previous nor@@ tel patents , made a law@@ suit of class action on thursday .
ro@@ ck@@ star , the con@@ sor@@ ti@@ um that holds the nor@@ tel patents for $ 4.@@ 5 billion , has been su@@ ing sam@@ sung electronics for a new product , the sam@@ sung electronics co ltd . , hu@@ a@@ we@@ i and the company .
ro@@ ck@@ star is a joint ownership of apple , microsoft , black@@ ber@@ ry , er@@ ic@@ s@@ son and sony .
google is used in seven cases of patent infringement .
patents do not cover technology that is used to identify search terms on the internet with relevant advertising , so the compla@@ int that they place at the heart of google &apos;s search engine business .
sam@@ sung , hu@@ a@@ we@@ i , ht@@ c and ro@@ ck@@ star representatives were not directly accessible .
sam@@ sung , hu@@ a@@ we@@ i and ht@@ c are making cell phones that are compatible with google &apos;s and@@ ro@@ id operating system , which is in sharp competition with mobile products from apple and microsoft .
in 2011 , google announced an initial bid for more than $ 9@@ 00 million for the nor@@ tel patents .
google increased its offer several times and last offered 4.@@ 4 billion dollars .
after the nor@@ tel patents were rejected by ro@@ ck@@ star , the company acquired a new license for motor@@ ola mobility for 12.@@ 5 billion dollars , a business that also contributed to the development of motor@@ ola &apos;s library .
“ although google failed in its attempt to make the patent pending , it was not able to do so .
ro@@ ck@@ star claims a high compensation from google , because it claims to have committed google &apos;s patent infringement deliber@@ ately , so the acc@@ us@@ ation .
egypt is s@@ wor@@ n by first fre@@ el@@ y-@@ elected presidents
mo@@ ham@@ med mor@@ si is the o@@ ath of authority , but his day of tri@@ um@@ ph is not likely to be the end of political disputes in egypt .
islam@@ ist mo@@ ham@@ med mor@@ si promised a “ new egypt , ” when he was the first freely elected president of the country to be s@@ wor@@ n in , and thus the success@@ or of hus@@ ni mu@@ bar@@ ak , who had lived 16 months earlier .
in its in@@ aug@@ ur@@ ation to the supreme constitutional court , mor@@ si became the first freely elected arab president and egyp@@ tian fifth president of the arab world since the fall of the mon@@ arch@@ y .
he put the o@@ ath before the 18 men dres@@ sed in black ro@@ bes of the court , which had its seat on the n@@ ile and an ancient egyp@@ tian temple .
“ we strive for a better future , a new egypt and a second republic , ” mor@@ si said at the cere@@ mony that took place live on state television .
“ today , the egyp@@ tian people have laid the foundation for a new life – absolute freedom , real democracy and stability , ” said the 6@@ 0-@@ year-@@ old mor@@ si , a us@@ -@@ trained engine@@ er and a muslim bro@@ ther@@ hood member .
hundreds of soldiers and polic@@ em@@ en guar@@ ded the building when mor@@ si was att@@ acked in a hospital in a small car con@@ vo@@ y shortly after 11 a.m.
only a few hundred sup@@ porters had gathered in the court to give the new president a re@@ mem@@ br@@ ance , and , unlike the presidential pr@@ un@@ k from the mu@@ bar@@ ak era , the traffic was only stopped for a short time , so the president was stopped .
as an un@@ char@@ is@@ matic “ spare wheel ” of the bro@@ ther@@ hood , his personal presti@@ ge has been mo@@ c@@ ked since his victory and a friday speech , in which he has not only shown himself to be a candidate of islam@@ ists , but all .
“ egypt is now a civilian , national , constitutional , and modern state , ” said the president of the united states , who has been dres@@ sed in a blue suit with red ti@@ e .
mor@@ si later went to ca@@ iro university , where he began his in@@ aug@@ ural speech .
he was officially supported by a army band that had the national an@@ them , who he had been in pos@@ session of .
military leader fel@@ d@@ mar@@ sh@@ al hus@@ sein tan@@ ta@@ w@@ i was present .
on his arrival he was welcomed by hundreds of present in the largest aud@@ it@@ ori@@ um of the university with speakers of “ the army and the people are a hand . ”
the first bas@@ tion of the city of vienna in 19@@ 08 , built as a bas@@ tion of sec@@ ular education , was established in the 197@@ 0s as a strong@@ hold of islam@@ ist student groups .
mor@@ si presented a symbo@@ lic o@@ ath on friday ’ s ta@@ hi@@ r square , the birth@@ place of the u@@ pris@@ ing that was held at the end of author@@ itarian rule in mu@@ bar@@ ak last year , and he p@@ raised it .
but , with the removal of official o@@ ath to the court , not as usual in parliament , he is bo@@ wing to the military ’ s will , which indicates that the power struggle will continue .
mor@@ si ’ s speech at ta@@ hi@@ r square was full of dramatic popul@@ ist ge@@ st@@ ures .

rap@@ ist in south africa : two li@@ fel@@ ong de@@ tention
nine months after the brut@@ al ra@@ pe and mu@@ ti@@ lation of a 17@@ -@@ year-@@ old girl in south africa , the cul@@ pri@@ t was sent@@ enced to two life on friday .
the station sab@@ c reported this .
the victim was later involved in the consequences of serious in@@ jur@@ ies .
joh@@ ann@@ es k@@ ana was already responsible for the crime earlier this week .
the act had caused hor@@ ror nation@@ wide .
the then 21 year-@@ old had been an@@ ene boo@@ y@@ sen in february in an industrial site in bre@@ d@@ as@@ dor@@ p near cape town .
14 hours of the doctors strugg@@ led to survive the victim , but in v@@ ain .
the sight of the young people was so hor@@ ri@@ ble that the care@@ rs and si@@ sters needed psycho@@ logical assistance .
k@@ ana ad@@ mitted during the trial that he was on the night of the night with boo@@ y@@ sen in a bar .
he also conf@@ essed that they were be@@ aten and rap@@ ed , but he denied that he was responsible for the death of the girl .
the police were initially run by several off@@ enders , but released two susp@@ ects from prison , because the occup@@ ying forces were not able to prove them .
the public prosecu@@ tor also stressed during the procedure that it was convinced that k@@ ana was not ready at the time of the attack .
ra@@ pe has been almost an everyday oc@@ curren@@ ce in south africa : there are approximately 64 000 indic@@ t@@ ments ann@@ ually for sexual violence .
that is almost ten times the amount in germany , but it is still much more popu@@ lated than south africa ( 50 million ) , with 82 million people .
police and women ’ s associations in south africa es@@ timate the number of cases of sexual violence to be 10-@@ 25 times higher .

they thought that travel agencies were a thing of the past thanks to the internet ?
flight centre seems to be resi@@ sting the trend .
the company has increased its ear@@ nings prospects for the whole year and exp@@ ects record revenues from holiday makers in australia and the uk .
the travel company is now starting to profit from adjusted ear@@ nings before taxes between 3@@ 25 and 3@@ 40 million dollars , compared to 30@@ 5 to 3@@ 15 million dollars in its previous forec@@ ast .
if the current target values are achieved , then this means growth of 12 to 17 % compared to the record profit of 2@@ 9@@ 0.@@ 4 million dollars in the period 2011 / 12 .
as managing director gra@@ ham tur@@ ner announced , flight centre achieved a record 8 % profit in the first half of the year and had a strong start in the second half , especially in austr@@ ali@@ an and british private business .
“ since the beginning of the year , our ten countries have been prof@@ itable , and some of them are well on track to record annual ear@@ nings before interest and taxes , ” he said .
these include australia and the uk , which are typically among our strong@@ est benefici@@ aries .
in australia , the leisure industry has reco@@ vered in the second half of the year , which has created a slightly weak@@ er market for business travel .
it was also similar for f@@ light@@ centre &apos;s leisure activities in the uk , while business customers were also spending less here .
the us business reco@@ vered from the weak@@ er first half of the year , with seas@@ onal de@@ fl@@ ation , making a profit for the full year expected .
flight centre shares rose by 3 c@@ ents yesterday to 3@@ 8.@@ 20 dollars .
schools are becoming more focused on mathem@@ a@@ tics , sp@@ elling and gram@@ mar .
in courses on english literature , students must in future receive at least one piece of sha@@ kes@@ pe@@ are , a 19th century novel , romantic ly@@ ric@@ s and contemporary british nov@@ els .
the test also includes “ un@@ seen texts ” to help broader understanding of reading .
the combined course of english literature and language will be abol@@ ished .
from 20@@ 15 , students must undertake an independent g@@ c@@ se examination of language , with strong incentives to learn english literature as a separate quality .
the ministry of education will be presenting the new english and mathem@@ a@@ tics cur@@ ricul@@ a tomorrow – the first subjects that have been rad@@ ically re@@ designed .
other core subjects will be changed next year .
a separate initiative will be devoted to of@@ pain , the supervisory authority for aud@@ its , a re@@ organization of g@@ c@@ se structures , including a new ben@@ ding system and fewer exchange rates .
in a summer speech , minister for education , michael go@@ ve , said that there is “ a broad consensus that we need to reform our audit system to restore public confidence , ” emphasi@@ sing that the g@@ c@@ ses would “ challenge . ”
studies show that in english schools , less time is spent on mathem@@ a@@ tics – 1@@ 16 hours a year or three hours a week per school year – than in most other countries .
in contrast , austr@@ ali@@ an schools te@@ ach an average of 14@@ 3 hours a year , and students in sing@@ apor@@ e receive 13@@ 8 hours .
although there will be no formal requirement to set up more time for mathem@@ a@@ tics in the timetable , it is not possible to use coalition groups to make full mathem@@ a@@ tics – combined with a stronger weight .
the cur@@ ricul@@ um focuses more on “ problems from the right life ” , including financial mathem@@ a@@ tics .
beautiful animals and delicious ca@@ kes will attract you to the heart of the city .
the most beautiful r@@ ab@@ bits of different rac@@ es and colour stri@@ kes present the &quot; kre@@ is@@ ver@@ band@@ s@@ se@@ ren@@ sw@@ is@@ sen@@ schaf@@ ts@@ sch@@ au &quot; at the b@@ ür@@ ger@@ haus this weekend .

sal@@ em : joh@@ anna ra@@ h@@ ner at the ec@@ um@@ en@@ ical forum of talks in the ec@@ um@@ en@@ ical forum of talks in the czech republic .
the next ec@@ um@@ en@@ ical forum on monday , 21 october , at the new museum of the castle , is about the topic &quot; hel@@ l with hel@@ l - the@@ ological considerations on the way the last things are handled today &quot; .
lec@@ ture@@ r is professor joh@@ anna ra@@ h@@ ner .
the ec@@ um@@ en@@ ical forum for discussion is an initiative of the catho@@ lic and prote@@ stant church communities of sal@@ em , the castle of sal@@ em and the cultural centre of lake con@@ stance .
joh@@ anna ra@@ h@@ ner wants to look at the forum of how people can now understand the &quot; last things &quot; after death .
if people had been convinced over the past centuries that this was too much , and if they had been put on those images of heav@@ en and hel@@ l , &quot; which character@@ ise our ideas to this day , &quot; the contemporary pro@@ ph@@ ec@@ y teaching of the lord is of the perfect .
&quot; the greater hope is for christi@@ ans through the critique of religion .
she has &quot; given us so many question marks that the ex@@ cl@@ am@@ ation marks are han@@ ging over us &quot; .
joh@@ anna ra@@ h@@ ner says further : &quot; but the crucial challenge remains the an@@ ger of death &quot; .
this raises the question of the desire to &quot; bear the dreams of the end of the day &quot; .
joh@@ anna ra@@ h@@ ner , born in bad@@ en-@@ ba@@ den in 196@@ 2 , studied kat@@ ho@@ lic@@ he the@@ ology and bio@@ logy at the al@@ ber@@ t-@@ lu@@ d@@ wi@@ g@@ s-@@ uni@@ ver@@ sit@@ ä@@ t fre@@ i@@ burg from 198@@ 2 to 1989 .
she received her ph@@ d in 1997 as a ph@@ d student , also in fre@@ i@@ burg .
the hab@@ ilitation of fundamental the@@ ology and ec@@ um@@ en@@ ical the@@ ology followed in 2003 at the west@@ f@@ ali@@ an wil@@ hel@@ m@@ s-@@ uni@@ ver@@ sit@@ ä@@ t .
since 2010 joh@@ anna ra@@ h@@ ner has been teaching systematic the@@ ology at the institute of catho@@ lic the@@ ology of the university of kas@@ sel .
ge@@ is@@ ling@@ en : more than 100 young ca@@ th@@ ol@@ ics from the small he@@ ur@@ berg confirm their faith in the company .
in two services , 10@@ 1 15@@ - and 16@@ -@@ year-@@ old te@@ en@@ ag@@ ers of the ministry of the ministry of education have been fir@@ med up at the small he@@ ur@@ berg .
the wor@@ ship was accompanied by the lau@@ dat@@ o-@@ si group in the morning , the youth cho@@ ir the spirit in the afternoon .
the reception of the fir@@ m@@ sac@@ ram@@ ent was a great success for young people and they asked for the power of the holy spirit .
the fir@@ m@@ l@@ ings had changed in the last few months , under the direction of di@@ ak@@ on rein@@ er exten@@ der and the support of many members of the municip@@ al council on the big festival day .
in various projects , they learned various tasks of christian community life and experienced together the youth day in lower power@@ houses .
ill@@ men@@ see : second mountain bike race enthusi@@ asts with participants in the bi@@ king race .
in fine weather 2@@ 14 cy@@ cli@@ sts came to ill@@ men@@ see to take the tour of the hills and mountains around the lake .
this is what ul@@ rich kno@@ bel tells of the organis@@ ing sports club ill@@ men@@ see .
among the participants were , in particular , on the short distance of 15 kilometres and 300 metres of al@@ titude , numerous cy@@ cli@@ sts who had their ho@@ b@@ by in competition .
two junior drivers of the german top class were also present at the start of this competition : fe@@ li@@ x bad@@ er from bad wal@@ d@@ see and pas@@ cal tre@@ u@@ bel from a@@ ach@@ -@@ lin@@ z came up with the recommendation of good ran@@ k@@ ings .
these two could , as expected , with@@ stand the field .
as in the previous year , fe@@ li@@ x bad@@ er could have a small advance in the time to the finish and def@@ ended his title as the overall winner of short distance .
in second place , pas@@ cal tre@@ u@@ bel was once again able to place himself in the position of the third place .
the staff were very friendly and helpful .
in second place , anne a@@ del from ill@@ men@@ see and leon@@ ie driver from the o@@ win@@ gen took the place of three .
a welcome development is the increasing number of drivers who are in the municip@@ ality or who work in it .
not only in terms of performance , the entire range of athle@@ tes was represented .
the age structure was also ran@@ ked among the top ten in the top 70 in the top ten of the top ten .
in the main race this year were even more absolute top athle@@ tes .
four drivers were able to take off from the regional top drivers .
among them phili@@ p@@ p pan@@ ger@@ l , a mountain@@ bike semi-@@ professional from the black tus@@ k racing team .
pan@@ ger@@ l was a team member twice in the twel@@ ve-@@ hour race .
this year he became european champi@@ on in this special discipline .
with ro@@ land b@@ aller@@ ste@@ dt , who has won two german champion@@ ships in the du@@ ath@@ l@@ on , he is also a member of the german team .
after 45 kilometres and 9@@ 00 metres of al@@ titude , a wh@@ ir@@ l@@ wind came to the finish in the finish before the three-@@ lake hal@@ le .
pan@@ ger@@ l was the first to hit the finish line .
only a second behind it could the rout@@ ine b@@ aller@@ ste@@ dt get second place in the overall rating .
at the same time her@@ mann and war@@ th@@ mann came to the finish as the third in the overall rating .
in the ladies &apos; ran@@ king , christian co@@ h@@ s@@ mann was the fas@@ test in the main race .
the second place was won by are@@ ane bl@@ er@@ sch from binding forces before nat@@ as@@ ch@@ a wer@@ ner from stutt@@ gart .
athle@@ tes and help@@ ers were very pleased with the smooth and well-@@ organized process of the event .
on the way through mu@@ d , rivers and jun@@ g@@ les for free medical care
dr. geor@@ ges b@@ wel@@ le provides free medical assistance in remote villages in camer@@ o@@ on .
b@@ wel@@ le and his team spend nearly every weekend trying to treat hundreds of patients .
in the west african country , there are not many doctors , only one for 5@@ ,000 people , only one for 5@@ ,000 people .
do you agree with your mobile phone here or with your mobile device ?
dr. geor@@ ges b@@ wel@@ le is one of the top 10 of the “ c@@ n@@ n her@@ oes of 2013 ” .
you can choose for him or any of the other her@@ oes in the top 10 to make him the “ c@@ n@@ n her@@ o of the year . ”
the winner gets $ 2@@ 50@@ ,000 to continue his exceptional work .
for 21 years , geor@@ ges b@@ wel@@ le looked at how his si@@ ck father kept losing consci@@ ousness and becoming hospit@@ als , which were not connected with the means to prevent him .
j@@ ame@@ f b@@ wel@@ le was born in 198@@ 1 in a car accident near y@@ a@@ oun@@ d@@ é , the capital camer@@ o@@ on .
first he had only a broken arm , but then the first was formed a infl@@ am@@ mation that was based on his brain .
“ there was no neu@@ ro@@ sur@@ ge@@ on in camer@@ o@@ on , ” says geor@@ ges b@@ wel@@ le .
we should have brought it out of camer@@ o@@ on if we had had the money .
instead , b@@ wel@@ le spent years trying to get his father into over@@ crow@@ ded clin@@ ics and hospit@@ als to be there to help .
“ it ’ s not easy , ” comments b@@ wel@@ le .
you can enjoy the view of the lake and the mountains .
there are a great many patients .
some people even die because they have to wait .
the situation has hardly changed since b@@ well &apos;s father died in 2002 .
in camer@@ o@@ on , there is only one doctor per 5@@ ,000 people , according to the world health organization .
on the other hand , the relationship in the united states is with a doctor for 4@@ 13 people .
but even if there was a doctor for them , most camer@@ o@@ ons could not afford to visit .
two out of five people in the country live below the poverty line and nearly three-@@ quarters of health spending in the country is private .
“ the only problem you have is poverty , ” says b@@ wel@@ le .
and poverty makes it impossible to enjoy life .
his father and so many of his comp@@ at@@ ri@@ ots had to be seen in b@@ wel@@ le to take action against this .
dr. geor@@ ges b@@ wel@@ le and his volunte@@ er team have launched 700 free operations last year .
he became a doctor himself and works as a v@@ as@@ cu@@ lar sur@@ ge@@ on in the central hospital in y@@ a@@ oun@@ d@@ é .
he also founded a non-@@ profit organization called as@@ co@@ vi@@ me , which was moved to rural areas at week@@ ends and where free medical care is offered .
since 2008 , he and his volunte@@ er group have helped nearly 3@@ 2@@ ,000 people .
almost every friday he and up to 30 people are forced to travel in mini@@ buses and ride with the snow@@ ed medical equipment on the roof over un@@ secured ter@@ rain .
not everything is always going smo@@ o@@ thly .
they have had to cross the rivers and s@@ lu@@ dge more than once .
but when they arrive , they will receive as her@@ oes : a fe@@ ast , song , and dance , and the best accommodation the place to offer .
in these villages , free medical care is really a cause of celebr@@ ation and b@@ low@@ ing – with its broad sm@@ ile and its boun@@ dless energy – is happy to be at the happy party .
the next morning the team starts to investigate hundreds of patients .
“ we treat 500 people per journey , ” said b@@ wel@@ le .
they come from a 60 km radi@@ us around the village – and that on foot .
each of these weekend clin@@ ics offers medical care in a number of areas .
many people are being held in prison for mal@@ aria , tu@@ ber@@ cu@@ lo@@ sis , mal@@ nutri@@ tion , di@@ abe@@ tes , par@@ a@@ sites and sex@@ ually transmitted diseases .
others get cr@@ ut@@ ches , don@@ ated gl@@ asses or free birth certific@@ ates – a document that is required for school , but which is often simply not available to many poor families .
in the evening , the team carri@@ es out simple operations with local an@@ aes@@ the@@ sia .
the operations are usually carried out in a school , town hall or apartment , and after the intervention patients are on the way and go to the recre@@ ation area to make room for the next one .
the lighting for the op and the dis@@ inf@@ ection equipment is provided by the gener@@ ator of the group and so b@@ wel@@ le and its volunte@@ ers work up to the early morning hours on sunday .
it is a hard job , but the village musicians help to make the team mo@@ tivation and to keep it motivated .
&quot; they are dr@@ um@@ ming all night so that we can stay awa@@ ke and continue our work , &quot; says b@@ wel@@ le .
on sunday the team then goes back to the city , ti@@ red but proud of the work done .
the group – a mix@@ ture of camer@@ o@@ on doctors and foreign medical students – has launched 700 free sur@@ ger@@ ies last year , and knows that their work makes a huge difference to people who are helped .
one man explained that the free operation of a broken performance that he received was now able to allow him to work again .
“ this is changing the future of my family , ” said the man .
in addition to weekend clin@@ ics and his work as a sur@@ ge@@ on in the hospital , b@@ wel@@ le also works at night in private clin@@ ics in y@@ a@@ oun@@ d@@ é .
with this second job , he finances 60 % of his non-@@ profit activity , so b@@ wel@@ le ; the rest of his private don@@ ations .
“ i really do not know when he sle@@ eps , ” k@@ ati@@ e o &apos;@@ mal@@ ley says , who died in the second year at dre@@ x@@ el university in phil@@ ade@@ l@@ phi@@ a medicine and volun@@ tar@@ ily in b@@ wel@@ les .
he is always either in hospital or trying to raise money for the organization so that he can go to these campaigns .
for medical and nur@@ sing students such as o &apos;@@ mal@@ ley , who come from the usa and europe and support b@@ wel@@ le , this is an opportunity to gain practical experience that will help them at home .
“ we can be in the process of operations where we help to pur@@ i@@ fy blood or to use the instruments for dr. b@@ wel@@ le , ” explains o &apos;@@ mal@@ ley .
this would be a very difficult situation in america as a medical student in the second year .
students pay their journey to camer@@ o@@ on themselves , usually , and often bring together co@@ ca@@ -@@ col@@ oured san@@ it@@ ary material .
but once you have arrived in y@@ a@@ oun@@ d@@ é , b@@ wel@@ le will take care of accommodation , transport and instruc@@ tion .
“ he is without a doubt a her@@ o , ” says o &apos;@@ mal@@ ley .
he dedic@@ ates his life to this organisation and his desire to help the people of camer@@ o@@ on knows no borders .
for b@@ wel@@ le , almost permanent work is not a burden .
to make others happ@@ i@@ er is to make a promise that is not to be forgotten .
“ i am so happy when i do this work , ” says b@@ wel@@ le .
and i am thinking of my father .
i hope he sees what i do .
i do it to make people lau@@ gh again and to reli@@ eve the pain .
visit the site of as@@ co@@ v@@ im@@ e and learn how to help .
excellent the fight managed the fight is the best .
the role of s@@ anti@@ ago , the old man in hem@@ ing@@ way ’ s novel &quot; the old man and the sea &quot; , is hor@@ st jan@@ son on the body .
jan@@ son is an old hand in his but@@ t , the art of acting .
the old man s@@ anti@@ ago cannot do anything to fo@@ ol anyone when fishing .
the two simply comple@@ ment each other wonder@@ fully .
it is almost thought that the fol@@ ds in the nec@@ k of the old man , of which the fishing boy man@@ olo spe@@ aks .
if s@@ anti@@ ago is ti@@ red of life on the chair , he is the one with jan@@ son real .
in addition , the role of the old fisher@@ man is through and through a character role that jan@@ son has excell@@ ently played .
hem@@ ing@@ way told the story of a figh@@ ter , a cour@@ ageous man who did not give up and eventually died through his knowledge and also his will to fight the fish .
jan@@ son is widely regarded as a single actor on stage .
it man@@ ages to attract the audience ’ s attention , and it is also able to maintain its mono@@ lo@@ gues ’ attention for a moment .
his efforts to finally bring the fish to the surface of the water are so real that the spec@@ t@@ ators forget that the sea is only made of blue .
director j@@ ens has@@ sel@@ mann leaves the old man in the boat in front of the fishing village .
during the performance he continues the active scene : the hi@@ p of s@@ anti@@ ago de compos@@ te@@ la , the bar of the sing@@ er mari@@ e-@@ lu@@ ise gun@@ st , the bar with its songs and their magnificent voice the life .
the four musicians play cu@@ ban rhy@@ th@@ m and are also guests of the bar .
tourism : des@@ cent to the roman@@ s
the lower part of cologne is about 120 metres long and a se@@ wage canal from the roman era is preserved .
anyone visiting cologne does not get past the cathedral .
around 15@@ 7 meters , the two to@@ wers rise to the sky and turn it into the second highest church building in europe .
but few visitors who visit the two f@@ ili@@ gre@@ e church to@@ wers will appreciate the fact that there are also many churches under the du@@ om@@ o .
ra@@ iner schul@@ ze is an expert in the under@@ world of cologne .
the meeting point for his guided tours is the service center of cologne tourism directly at the dom .
the tour starts in a very un@@ spectacular way : &quot; we start in the underground car park &quot; , says schul@@ ze .
in the 197@@ 0s , the city fa@@ thers wanted to create a city that is suitable for cars , and therefore remained un@@ touched by the remains of the old city wall .
most users of the multi-@@ sto@@ rey car park are therefore hur@@ ried by the roman remains today and only leave their car .
but those who look more closely will discover the new “ metal ” technology in the par@@ k@@ dec@@ k d@@ 2 .
the view is about five meters high ru@@ ins of stone walls .
&quot; these are remains of the roman city wall , which was built in the second half of the first century after christ , &quot; schul@@ ze tells .
before returning to the day@@ light , schul@@ ze lets participants on the upper level still have a look at a fin@@ er , 15 meters de@@ eper ch@@ ess .
this is the well of the old cathedral , which unfortunately is hardly noticed .
the ne@@ arest station of the tour is the pre@@ tori@@ um , and here the participants are again des@@ cen@@ ding down into the dep@@ ths .
we are witn@@ essing the seat of the once most powerful man north of the alps , the world ’ s c@@ ca@@ a pre@@ cur@@ sor .
what c@@ ca@@ a means is to know a visitor .
&quot; the ab@@ bre@@ vi@@ ation stands for &quot; col@@ onia cla@@ u@@ dia ara ag@@ ri@@ pp@@ in@@ en@@ si@@ um &quot; , which means in good german as &quot; city of roman law and city of ag@@ ri@@ pp@@ ine , founded under emper@@ or lau@@ di@@ us .
and the pre@@ tori@@ um is the former hall of f@@ ame , which was the centre of power of the roman empire on the rh@@ ine .
from the entrance hall of the exhibition , a tunnel access to the roman se@@ wage channel , which is here preserved at about 120 metres in length .
&quot; you can easily walk a bit along the so-called clo@@ ac@@ a maxim@@ a if you want &quot; , jo@@ y@@ fully schul@@ ze is encouraging guests .
schul@@ ze has yet to come up with a surprise .
after he has collected the key at the chec@@ k@@ out , he leads the group to a 16 meter deep , wal@@ k@@ able sha@@ ft .
&quot; we are now in the mi@@ k@@ we , a rit@@ ual jewish bath , &quot; he explains .
the jewish community built its bath deep into the ground to get to the gr@@ ound@@ water , which is used for the rit@@ ual washing .
to this day , the lower end of the mi@@ k@@ we , whose origin@@ s date back to the eigh@@ th century , has been replaced by different water levels by var@@ ying levels of the rh@@ ine .
the mi@@ k@@ we are part of an archae@@ ological area on the town hall square , for which the construction work is to begin shortly .
however , some years will pass by before completion .
le@@ g almost cut : re@@ run of ro@@ ck@@ er process .
a bloo@@ dy attack in the ro@@ ck@@ er@@ mil@@ eu will be re@@ kin@@ d@@ led after more than four years .
a trial for attemp@@ ted su@@ ici@@ de , dangerous in@@ jury to the body and damage to the object of two thir@@ ds has been initiated before the district court of frankfurt ( oder ) .
it is governed by strict security measures .
the accused remained silent at the start .
they are supposed to have been active in the ro@@ ck@@ er scene and then belong@@ ed to the band@@ di@@ dos .
the public prosecu@@ tor acc@@ uses them of having to deal with unknown accompl@@ ices in fin@@ ow@@ furt in june 2009 on three men in a car and of being in@@ duc@@ ed .
all the victims were se@@ ve@@ rely in@@ ju@@ red , a man would almost have lost his le@@ g .
victims should become the compe@@ ting grou@@ ping of hel@@ ls ang@@ els .
one is to be a high-@@ ran@@ king member from berlin .
it seems that the first of these was a multi-@@ car ch@@ ase .
the charge was made of the battle of the area and a demonstration of power .
the two accused were in a first trial at the beginning of 2012 .
a court spo@@ kes@@ man said at the time that it could not be proven that men were involved in the bloo@@ dy f@@ eu@@ d .
the perpe@@ tr@@ ators had carried mas@@ ks and had not been recognized .
the federal court of justice re@@ vo@@ ked the judgment after the public prosecu@@ tor ’ s review and called it to the district court again for further negotiations .
one of the accused is currently imprison@@ ed for another crime .
the first of these was the reconstruction of the processes in the fac@@ ade night .
as a witness , the commissioner who was then identified was loaded .
the focus was on the def@@ end@@ ant ’ s mobile phone calls and other people who had heard the police .
it is difficult for ro@@ ck@@ ers to get to court almost always in accordance with a law that they regard as their own - and not to make statements .
this also applies to the victims .
in the first process , only one of the victims had been dis@@ bur@@ sed .
prosecu@@ tor ste@@ fan gol@@ fi@@ er of the public prosecu@@ tor &apos;s office frankfurt ( or ) said on request that since the last procedure , new trac@@ es have appeared .
ele@@ ven other negotiating meetings are scheduled for the process .
the dispos@@ ing society does not think
the night was long , the music l@@ oud and the mo@@ od good , but eventually it goes home .
but in the trees of people on the fron@@ t-@@ passenger and re@@ ar seat , hun@@ ger is notic@@ eable .
of course , one cock@@ tail or two champ@@ ag@@ ne may be responsible for this !
what would be more appropriate than ch@@ illed for the next drive in order to get a little bit of lu@@ ck ?
i admit that i am happy to be there when it comes to late night or early morning .
a few pom@@ mes , a col@@ a , a bur@@ ger - and then ni@@ x as from home and into bed !
but , on their way home , the obvious differences between me and others hun@@ gr@@ y dis@@ co go@@ ers are notic@@ eable .
because what is missing is the constant regular maintenance of your fa@@ st-@@ food products ?
the most important thing is that the paper clo@@ ths are thro@@ wn away at the weekend and on parking spaces .
&quot; why ? &quot; i wonder .
are people too do@@ of to carry the bags home with respect until the next m@@ ill .
it is not only the case that the paper product shi@@ fts the landscape .
bags have already been used by transport facilities such as conduc@@ tor plan@@ ks and have therefore caused accidents .
what does that mean , &quot; dispos@@ ing society &quot; , but not , pre@@ sum@@ ably , it does not even know what that word actually means .
the hotel is very close to the city centre and the metro station is just a few minutes away .
there would be a few bags , more or less , even no@@ x - unlike the street where no one is on the food rem@@ n@@ ants of other rum@@ tr@@ am@@ pl@@ es .
i see the day when the cities and the municip@@ alities will be able to cross the path .
obama ’ s back@@ l@@ ash in health policy
after severe criticism , president obama made a back@@ ward step in his frequently repeated , un@@ ambigu@@ ous promise yesterday : “ if you like your health insurance , you can keep it . ”
after hundreds of thousands of their insu@@ rers have received a letter of notice , the republic@@ ans have thro@@ wn a sp@@ ade on the president in recent days , calling on the american public to dec@@ ei@@ ve him .
yesterday obama rela@@ ti@@ sed his original promise .
“ the vast majority of citizens who want a functioning health insurance can be re@@ tained , ” he said at a speech in bo@@ ston .
in response to the numerous media reports on the dis@@ mis@@ s@@ als , obama called on those americans who received such communications to engage in free market re@@ insurance .
most citizens could thus expect a better , more comprehensive health insurance for the same price or less than forec@@ ast .
“ you are coming up with a better offer , ” he said .
the government said it was not surprising that the five percent of the population that had insurance themselves would not be able to move to another tari@@ ff , because their contract was not based on the new standards set by the adver@@ d@@ able care act .
“ i want to say to these americans quite directly : they deserve better , ” said se@@ beli@@ us at a hearing before the energy and trade committee of the representative house in washington .
se@@ beli@@ us , the world ’ s leading financial institution , is the most important financial institution in the world .
“ i am as fru@@ stra@@ ted and an@@ gr@@ y as everyone else , ” she said .
i am determined to reg@@ ain their trust .
this statement of an ex@@ ag@@ ger@@ ated se@@ beli@@ us to a consult@@ ant behind her at yesterday &apos;s hearing in the representative office of the house of representatives was rejected after a dispute with the republic@@ an me@@ p , bil@@ ly long from mis@@ sour@@ i .
after more than three hours of hearing , long se@@ beli@@ us repeatedly pressed for the question of why the “ architec@@ t ” of the aff@@ ord@@ able care act was not released volun@@ tar@@ ily on a state@@ -@@ spon@@ so@@ red insurance policy .
government in jerusal@@ em confir@@ ms attack on sy@@ ri@@ an air base not only does it not confirm the attack on sy@@ ri@@ an air base but it does not confirm the attack on sy@@ ri@@ an air base .
an american government official who remains anonymous is not in a position to make a statement to the us news channel , c@@ n@@ n , on thursday to the effect that israeli figh@@ ter plan@@ es had an air base in sy@@ ri@@ an lag@@ o@@ on a one day before .
the objective is &apos; missi@@ les and related equipment &apos; , of which the israeli government fe@@ ared that it would be responsible for the leban@@ ese he@@ z@@ bol@@ lah .
sy@@ ri@@ an and leban@@ ese media , as well as the arab al-@@ arab@@ i@@ ya station , had previously reported that the port city of lat@@ ak@@ ia was closed at mid@@ night on thursday .
the israeli television channel 2 showed satellite images of the base in la@@ titude island in the north of the country , showing russian missi@@ les of type s-@@ 12@@ 5 ne@@ wa and a battery .
un@@ certain the government in jerusal@@ em has officially not confirmed the attack .
however , the news agency re@@ u@@ ters quo@@ tes a equally anonymous israeli government official , saying that he believes that israel is not carrying out the attack , but is not sure .
a speaker from the israeli defense ministry said , in any case , &apos; we are not comm@@ enting on these reports &apos; .
the journ@@ alist ron ben@@ -@@ y@@ is@@ ha@@ i stressed in the daily newspaper ye@@ di@@ oth a@@ hr@@ on@@ oth that the country ’ s sy@@ ri@@ an regime had already , in some cases successfully , tried to create ground air missi@@ les .
the israeli government has repeatedly war@@ ned that any attempt to bring about a return to he@@ z@@ bol@@ lah by means of chemical or other dangerous weapons would be contrary to the rule of law .
john ker@@ ry explains in an unprecedented conf@@ ession that the us government ’ s es@@ pi@@ on@@ age is “ in@@ appropriate to gone too far ” .
john ker@@ ry suggested an un@@ expected admission that the us would be weak@@ ening its def@@ ensive stance .
the foreign minister also ad@@ mitted that he was wrong with bar@@ ack obama to take responsibility for ensuring “ auto@@ pi@@ il@@ ot . ”
the le@@ ak@@ ed information makes the us government em@@ bro@@ iled in a diplomatic stor@@ m of indi@@ gn@@ ation from its allies .
when trans@@ ferring a video to the open government conference in london , ker@@ ry said : “ without question we have the president and i , as well as others in the government , learned of some things that are almost automatic pilot .
he then ad@@ mitted as the first high-@@ ran@@ king member of the us government that the us es@@ pi@@ on@@ age had cros@@ sed a border , but also stressed that no rights were ab@@ used .
he said , ‘ in some cases , this has gone in@@ appropri@@ ately too far . ’
the president is determined to clarify matters and is therefore carrying out a thorough investigation so that no one has to feel that abuse is taking place .
i assure you that the rights of inno@@ cent people will not be affected in this process .
ker@@ ry insi@@ sted , however , that the n@@ sa be a force of good , and that its surveillance operations saved many lives .
he added : “ we are dealing with a new world in which people are ready to engage themselves in the air . ”
there is radical extre@@ mis@@ m in the world that is ob@@ s@@ essed with killing people .
so what if you were able to do it and to stop it , before it happens ?
we have in fact aircraft cr@@ ash@@ es , attacks on buildings and the murder of people because we have been affected by such plans in the run@@ -up to them .
meanwhile , us legisl@@ ators will travel to europe to raise concerns about the alleg@@ ed american es@@ pi@@ on@@ age .
sen@@ ator chr@@ is mur@@ ph@@ y from connec@@ tic@@ ut said that he met with representatives of the european parliament and other people this week and was concerned about their threats to engage in political dialogue because of fru@@ stration .
“ it is very important for national security interests in the us that europeans should be able to make a positive contribution to our joint efforts against terrorism , ” said mur@@ ph@@ y , who was a democr@@ at for the first time in the sen@@ ate and president .
i am also going to europe to make it clear that we are still working together in the fight against terrorism , regardless of their an@@ ger over the n@@ sa programmes .
media reports that the n@@ sa has received millions of telephone data in europe have strengthened relations with some us allies .
other rev@@ el@@ ations have quo@@ ted from snow@@ den ’ s documents that the n@@ sa has not used the bun@@ des@@ lig@@ a ’ s phone , and up to 34 other heads of state .
the head of the national secret services , james cla@@ pper , def@@ ended es@@ pi@@ on@@ age among allies as necessary , and said that this was common on both sides .
in all this u@@ pro@@ ar , mur@@ ph@@ y said that his authority prepared the trip of congress , which will take place this year , and hoped that the delegation would welcome members from both parties and cham@@ bers .
the names of the other participating members are to be published in the coming days .
he said that the exact route will be elabor@@ ated .
while mur@@ ph@@ y stressed the purpose of the journey is to improve relations , he also said that there are some “ serious words ” that would be .
he said that european governments must be honest with their people about the kind of sp@@ y programmes they themselves have been planning for years .
“ although we can change our surveillance programs , thereby better protecting europeans ’ rights , they must also address the fact that the us is not the only ones to protect the sp@@ ies . ”
meanwhile , john ker@@ ry has a weekend trip to the middle east and poland , to meet there with the gro@@ ss@@ ly res@@ ent@@ ment about the us strategy in syria , egypt , and iran , and the us surveillance activities .

austr@@ ali@@ an woman is appe@@ aling against prison sentence in thailand .
a 2@@ 1-@@ year-@@ old sy@@ d@@ ney woman who was born in ph@@ uk@@ et for 15 days because she was wr@@ ong@@ ly claimed to have been taken by a taxi driver .
ste@@ vi@@ e ro@@ ch@@ elle b@@ am@@ ford was initially convic@@ ted by a provin@@ cial court in ph@@ uk@@ et on 15 june to find a false statement .
later , however , the rec@@ ord@@ ings of a video camera showed that she had arrived safe@@ ly to her hotel after being separated from her austr@@ ali@@ an friend .
the police in ph@@ uk@@ et inter@@ ro@@ g@@ ated b@@ am@@ ford for two days until they had conf@@ essed to think about history .
until the trial , it was in police cust@@ o@@ dy on the ground .
b@@ am@@ ford became a 15@@ -@@ day prison sentence in a prison prison .
she is the daughter of peter tun@@ ks , a former player of the austr@@ ali@@ an rub@@ g@@ y-@@ league , who has been cont@@ acting the foreign ministry in can@@ ber@@ ra with a request for help for his daughter .
tun@@ ks said to the sunday te@@ leg@@ raph in sy@@ d@@ ney that the whole family was “ extremely concerned ” about the welfare of his daughter and wanted to bring them back to australia .
“ we are naturally very concerned , but we hope that you will be back home as soon as possible , ” said tun@@ ks .
b@@ am@@ ford has appe@@ aled against the judgment and is against a deposit of 50@@ ,000 ba@@ ht on free foot .
austr@@ ali@@ an reports have said that they have meanwhile been in kra@@ bi ’ s tourist resort in southern thailand .
the court has said that b@@ am@@ ford is being replaced by a local law@@ yer in ph@@ uk@@ et and is being war@@ ned that the government will not be able to appeal to the authorities .
however , it is also possible that thailand will be re@@ luc@@ t@@ ant to accept the new government following the recent murder of the travel agent mic@@ hel@@ le sm@@ ith in ph@@ uk@@ et .
