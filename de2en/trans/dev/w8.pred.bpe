gu@@ t@@ ach : even more safety for pede@@ stri@@ ans
they are not 100 metres apart : on tuesday , the new b 3@@ 3-@@ foot walk in gu@@ t@@ ach is set up at the village parking lot - in sight of the older town hall building .
two plants so close together : intention or tor@@ ture@@ r ?
this question was answered clearly by gu@@ t@@ ach ’ s may@@ or yesterday .
&quot; the city hall am@@ pel was installed at the time because it sec@@ ures the school path , &quot; ec@@ ker@@ t explained yesterday .
the k@@ lu@@ ser traffic lights are safe for both cy@@ cli@@ sts and bus passengers and the mountain residents .
the plant that was officially launched yesterday was important for the inter@@ section of sul@@ z@@ b@@ ach@@ we@@ g / kir@@ ch@@ stra@@ ß@@ e .
we have the museum , two churches , spa park , bus stop , a doctor and a bank , as well as traffic flow from the residential area › gru@@ b ‹ .
&quot; at the high traffic and pede@@ strian traffic vol@@ umes , another traffic light had to be produced for their safety , &quot; ec@@ ker@@ t said .
peter ar@@ no@@ ld of the off@@ enburg county council also confir@@ ms this .
&quot; according to current measure@@ ments , on the b 33 daily about 12 000 vehicles pass through the municip@@ ality of gu@@ t@@ ach , about 10 percent of which are heavy goods traffic , &quot; ar@@ no@@ ld emphasi@@ zes .
so the construction of another light is more than necessary : &apos; safety is just ahead &apos; , says ar@@ no@@ ld .
four traffic routes have been carried out , a roun@@ d@@ about has been planned , but due to the narrow inter@@ section of sul@@ z@@ b@@ ach@@ we@@ g / kir@@ ch@@ stra@@ ß@@ e .
according to ar@@ no@@ ld , the number of traffic light po@@ les was tested in the location of the traffic light ma@@ sts : &quot; by means of an extra for us with particularly long tr@@ un@@ ks of loaded tr@@ uc@@ ks we have tested whether these vehicles come from the sul@@ ph@@ ur .
the traffic light system itself , which costs around 15 000 euros , is the &quot; most modern thing that exists on the market &quot; , explained ar@@ no@@ ld .
the system is equipped with col@@ oured le@@ ds that shine so strongly that the lights are covered by the drivers , for example , even in the sun@@ set .
and it is econom@@ ical : the older light systems use about 100 wat@@ ts , the new eight wat@@ ts .
there are three lighting systems per direction .
ar@@ no@@ ld explained the technology of the new plant : this is equipped with two rad@@ ar sen@@ sors .
if the pede@@ strian pus@@ hes the traffic light button , the upper rad@@ ar sensor will test the traffic situation .
if the road is free , the pede@@ strian will be immediately green , if not , it will take about 15 seconds .
another rad@@ ar sensor checks whether the foot@@ print is finished for the pede@@ strian .
&quot; should a group or handic@@ app@@ ed people go out of the street , the gr@@ ound@@ work will be extended , so everyone will be safe@@ ly on the road , &quot; ar@@ no@@ ld said .
of course , drivers must be able to think about this as partners and observe the road .
this was not the case yesterday : hardly the traffic lights for pede@@ stri@@ ans green , a sk@@ y-@@ high vehicle rus@@ hed through - for the bright red .
jo@@ se@@ f win@@ k@@ ler has been writing for more than 30 years the p@@ light of his child@@ hood and youth from the soul .
the disasters of his catho@@ lic village child@@ hood - the lack of language , the inc@@ lin@@ ation to raw violence and bl@@ un@@ t sex@@ u@@ ality , which have been close and jo@@ y@@ less - have left the car@@ in@@ th@@ ian po@@ et many times .
the b@@ ü@@ ch@@ ner prize winner is known primarily as pro@@ se author , theatre texts are in his work ra@@ r .
coll@@ age of pro@@ sa@@ tex@@ tes ger@@ hard fres@@ ach@@ er presents for his performance &quot; weather lights on the ton@@ gue &quot; , which are now in garage x on pe@@ ter@@ s@@ platz .
the theatre maker combines elements from the auto@@ bio@@ graphical novel &quot; der le@@ i@@ gen@@ e &quot; ( 198@@ 7 ) with pro@@ sam@@ in@@ at@@ ure@@ n from &quot; le@@ ich@@ nam , his family be@@ lau@@ er@@ d &quot; ( 2003 ) .
the stage , which is largely empty , is important : a broken surface , a s@@ lic@@ ed sof@@ a , on which the k@@ op@@ pu@@ li@@ ert and ma@@ st@@ ur@@ b@@ ation are an@@ cho@@ red , the eigh@@ t-@@ person team han@@ gs .
in this context , director fres@@ ach@@ er seems to have little faith in the text .
the 7@@ 0-@@ minute performance ex@@ ag@@ ger@@ ates the template with a wealth of fil@@ m@@ making , known from the reper@@ to@@ ire of post@@ dramatic play forms .
the ac@@ t@@ res@@ ses in particular are often the ones who are in the process of sometimes question@@ able scen@@ ic re@@ alisation .
they are se@@ ve@@ rely att@@ acked , im@@ mer@@ sed in the water with their heads , t@@ acked with their evening ro@@ bes on the wall .
the first of these is the &quot; sch@@ l@@ ach@@ er &quot; ( the &quot; sch@@ l@@ ach@@ er &quot; ) , which is the most important trade fair for the german market .
the text is , however , hardly conve@@ yed in this way .
the best moments have the evening when sung - the range exten@@ ds from deep pur@@ ple to deep fol@@ k dance .
only towards the end comes the over-@@ shot performance a little to rest , and win@@ k@@ ler ’ s down@@ right absur@@ d hum@@ or is fl@@ ash@@ ing .
a black@@ box in the car ?
us street pl@@ ann@@ ers are looking for a source of money to finance the lo@@ om@@ ing highway system , and do they believe the solution in a small black box ?
the equipment that records every kil@@ ome@@ tre travell@@ ed and reports the information to the authorities is at the heart of a controversial attempt by washington and the eu ’ s planning offices to out@@ dated system for financing us dollars .
the area of road planning , usually bor@@ ing , suddenly had an intense debate with colour@@ ful al@@ li@@ ances .
liber@@ t@@ arians have al@@ lied with environmental groups and argue that the government should not use the small boxes to record the kilometres that have been travell@@ ed – and possibly also where they have been driven – and then use the information for calcul@@ ating .
the tea party is app@@ alled .
the american civil rights association ( ac@@ l@@ u ) is also deeply concerned and expres@@ ses a number of data protection concerns .
but , while congress did not agree to act , several states no longer wait .
they are currently looking at how they can change over the next ten years to a system in which drivers pay per m@@ ile in danger .
thousands of drivers have been killed by the tac@@ ho@@ graph@@ s , some of which are equipped with g@@ ps monitoring .
this is really a must for our country .
“ it is nothing we will possibly use , ” said has@@ an i@@ kh@@ r@@ ata , managing director of southern c@@ aly@@ p@@ tus corporation .
the way we pay these taxes will change .
the technology is there .
the initiative comes at a time when the highway trust fund , which is financed from taxes , is bringing the americans to the gas pi@@ pe , p@@ our@@ ing it down .
but america is no longer tan@@ k as much as it used to .
cars use less petro@@ l .
the government ’ s 18@@ .@@ 4 c@@ ents per gall@@ on ( less than 4 c@@ ents per lit@@ re ) tax on min@@ eral oil has not increased for 20 years .
politicians do not d@@ are to tax the tax by a single cent at high prices in the economy .
“ the gas@@ ol@@ ine tax is simply not sustainable , ” says le@@ e mun@@ n@@ ich , a transport law@@ yer at the university of min@@ n@@ es@@ ot@@ a .
his state recently sold 500 cars with tac@@ ho@@ graph@@ s that could be used to set up a mil@@ e@@ age payment system .
“ this is the most sensible option in the long term , ” he said .
bureaucr@@ ats call it mil@@ e-@@ based user service .
it is not surprising that the idea has attrac@@ ted urban liber@@ als , because the tax could be used , for example , to influence driving behaviour in such a way as to prevent cong@@ es@@ tion and harmful emissions from the climate .
califor@@ ni@@ an pl@@ ann@@ ers rely on the system in drawing up strategies to support ambitious , legally en@@ shr@@ ined goals of the state on climate change .
but the republic@@ an bill shu@@ ster of pen@@ n@@ sy@@ l@@ v@@ ania , chairman of the house transportation committee , also declared that the house was in favour of the most viable long-term alternative .
the free marke@@ ters of the reason foundation are also inspired by the idea of sending drivers to a re@@ located route .
“ this is not a tax that dis@@ appears in a black hole , ” explains adri@@ an mo@@ ore , vice president of directives at reason .
people pay directly for what they get .
the movement is also supported by two former us transport ministers , who in a report in 2011 called on congress to move towards mil@@ e-@@ based settlement .
the us sen@@ ate approved a $ 90 million pilot project last year , which would cover 10@@ ,000 cars .
but the majority in the house of representatives prevented the initiative , respon@@ ding to the concerns of members from rural areas who represent people who are in everyday life often many miles on the way to work or into the city .
several states and large cities are nevertheless moving towards their own accor@@ d .
o@@ reg@@ on is the most committed driver , currently 5@@ ,000 ri@@ ders for the country ’ s largest experim@@ ent .
these drivers will soon be char@@ ging the mil@@ e@@ age instead of the min@@ eral oil tax to the state .
ne@@ v@@ ada has already completed a pilot project .
new york city is also considering such a thing .
il@@ lin@@ o@@ is is testing it with tr@@ uc@@ ks to a limited extent .
and the i-@@ 95 coalition , to which the transport mini@@ stri@@ es of 17 states on the east coast belong ( including mar@@ y@@ land , pen@@ n@@ sy@@ l@@ v@@ ania , vir@@ g@@ ini@@ a , and fl@@ ori@@ da ) , is currently investig@@ ating change .
the concept is not a universal hit .
in ne@@ v@@ ada , where recently 50 volunte@@ ers were equipped with the equipment , drivers were s@@ cep@@ tical about the idea that the government could follow any of their movements .
“ objec@@ tions to big brother and such things were a big problem , ” explains al@@ aud@@ din kh@@ an , head of the strategy and results management department of the ne@@ v@@ ada ministry of transport .
people did not want it .
when the test started , the ac@@ l@@ u war@@ ned ne@@ v@@ ada on their website : “ it would be relatively easy to find the tac@@ ho@@ graph in full-@@ grown surveillance devices . ”
there is no need to create a gi@@ gan@@ tic , bul@@ ky technological infrastructure that will inevitably be used to support data on the daily movements of individual people .
ne@@ v@@ ada is a member of a number of states that are now looking for affordable technology to enable the state to control the kilometres that are being travell@@ ed , but not exactly when and where .
that , kh@@ an said , would also calm the public .
hun@@ ting for this technology has led some authorities to a small star@@ tup company called true mil@@ e@@ age in california .
the company was not originally established to assist states in tax@@ ing drivers .
instead , it was their aim to create a more competitive market for motor insurance , where drivers are able to compete on the basis of the miles they have been made .
but the devices it tests are also very interesting for road pl@@ ann@@ ers , because they do not work with g@@ ps and only provide limited information that is regularly up@@ loaded by mode@@ m .
“ people are more willing to participate if their speed and locations are not recorded ” , said ry@@ an mor@@ ris@@ on , ceo of eads .
some of these public pilot programmes have made major mistakes .
there are much cheaper and less in@@ tru@@ sive ways to implement this .
in o@@ reg@@ on , pl@@ ann@@ ers are experim@@ enting with offering drivers a range of choices .
you can choose a device with or without g@@ ps .
or you do not select any device at all and instead pay a flat fee based on the average risk of mil@@ e@@ age from all the inhabitants of the state .
others hope to re@@ consider the concept of a di@@ str@@ ust public by using more functions to equi@@ p the devices than with less .
in new york city , transport officials want to develop a tax@@ -@@ pay@@ er device that can also pay parking fees , a insurance just for dangerous kilometres , and a different speed record from other vehicles in real time , thanks to which they can be made .
“ the added value of the benefits offered by the system would motiv@@ ate drivers to take part , ” says a planning document from the city .
some transport pl@@ ann@@ ers wonder , however , whether all talk of paying per m@@ ile is not just a huge di@@ str@@ action .
in the metro@@ politan transportation commission for the area of san francis@@ co bay , officials declared that the congress was unable to resolve the problem of bank@@ ru@@ pt highway trust fund .
an additional one-@@ off fee or an annual lev@@ y could be imposed on drivers using hy@@ bri@@ d vehicles or other vehicles that use little petro@@ l .
“ there is no reason for an operation if an asp@@ ir@@ in is sufficient , ” explains r@@ and@@ y r@@ sch@@ wan@@ ler , head of the commission ’ s legislation and public affairs .
if we do that , hundreds of millions of drivers are concerned about their privacy and many other things .
king : small team is w@@ ack@@ er &apos;s first team to win the title of the title of the title of the title of the title of the title of the title of the title .
the voluntary fire bri@@ g@@ ade managed its autumn main test despite lack of personnel with bra@@ v@@ our .
only ele@@ ven men took part in the exercise .
h@@ ans kam@@ mer@@ er , comm@@ ander of the department , had taken the ownership of the fe@@ der estate in bur@@ g@@ ber@@ ger stra@@ ß@@ e in his acceptance of practice .
the sa@@ wing process is to be short .
the resulting fire and the smo@@ ke have in@@ ju@@ red two people , one of whom was able to send an emergency call .
two resp@@ ir@@ atory carri@@ ers of the armed forces were on the way to the first examination of the situation by h@@ ans kam@@ me@@ rer to enter the building .
after a short time , the first person was found and led to the open .
the second person had to be wor@@ n .
this was not so easy , as it was also possible to overcome a narrow sta@@ ir@@ case .
the building , a workshop with integrated stab@@ les for two horses , was not easy to secure .
there was a lot of wood and also stra@@ w bal@@ es in it .
there were also electrical machines for wo@@ od@@ working .
the first ext@@ ingu@@ ishing attack was carried out via the tan@@ k in the vehicle .
another line was built using a high he@@ at-@@ hy@@ dr@@ ate at about 100 meters distance .
now three ran@@ so@@ m attacks have been made .
the use of this system was also made in the building .
h@@ ans kam@@ me@@ rer was also interested in showing what is meant with little available space .
in case of emergency , support is provided via the kö@@ ni@@ gs@@ fel@@ d daily task group .
the comm@@ ander showed himself satisfied with the course of the exercise .
net@@ working of universities and companies important
during his visit to the county of bre@@ is@@ ga@@ u high black forest , president gui@@ do wol@@ f was also able to inform himself in ti@@ tis@@ ee new town about where the workers of tomorrow come from .
he went to the ho@@ ch@@ sch@@ war@@ z@@ wal@@ d school school school school heads and the kre@@ is@@ gy@@ m@@ na@@ si@@ um and the paren@@ tal advisory board chair@@ men .
&quot; education is an important factor in location , &quot; stressed cla@@ u@@ dia ste@@ l@@ le , director of the han@@ s-@@ th@@ om@@ a school , who supports the net@@ worked school project ho@@ ch@@ sch@@ war@@ z@@ wal@@ d education center .
wol@@ f was impres@@ sed by the model projects for training .
since 2011 , a successful collaboration between the support centre , the district gy@@ m@@ na@@ si@@ um and the vocational school centre has been in existence in the forest town .
he also p@@ raised the family-@@ friendly nature of the county .
&quot; it is important not only to have a look at the family phase , but also to have a look at the care of family members due to demographic change , &quot; wol@@ f explained .
he also said that more and more employees are concerned with the care and care of their rela@@ tives .
&quot; without the support of employers , the resulting work@@ force burden can lead to an end to the employment relationship , &quot; wol@@ f said .
but no one can afford to lose a skilled work@@ force , he said .
another particularly important factor is the net@@ working of universities and companies .
&quot; for anyone who has already experienced the benefits of the region during his studies , will remain satisfied with his acquired knowledge and skills of the regional economy , which will help to strengthen the region , &quot; the rural day showed .
only when there are sufficient training places can the skilled work@@ force be covered .
in his opinion , the region ’ s advantage is its advant@@ ageous location in south-@@ west germany , close to france and switzerland .
he also experienced a great deal of traffic on his train journey from ti@@ ti@@ se@@ e-@@ neu@@ stadt to fre@@ i@@ burg , where efforts have already been made to develop public transport .
&quot; stay firm and ensure that you are not the only one to improve public transport , &quot; he said to the att@@ end@@ ants of local politicians .

the k@@ au@@ l family has been inv@@ iting di@@ et@@ inger sen@@ i@@ ors for coffee , ca@@ kes and a ve@@ gan for 15 years .
in the past , the elderly were served in the re@@ sting place .

the more than 100 years old stone wall , as the front de@@ mar@@ c@@ ation of the old school cour@@ ty@@ ard to the kir@@ ch@@ stra@@ ß@@ e , is to be re@@ built with the re@@ hab@@ ilitation plan of the city of br@@ ä@@ un@@ ling@@ en .
in the days before the kil@@ big was the first works of the re@@ hab@@ ilitation of the front school yard a small wall , to stab@@ ili@@ ze and to reli@@ eve the sta@@ tic relief of the natural stone wall with bal@@ u@@ str@@ ade over a hundred years .
the next step , alexander mis@@ ok said , is to be taken by the br@@ ä@@ un@@ ling@@ er stad@@ t@@ bau@@ am@@ t , to include the national heritage office in the planning and to develop a re@@ hab@@ ilitation concept for the old wall .
the aim is to calcul@@ ate costs by experts who will then be able to submit a proposal to the local council to decide and determine the next step .
a decision on this is expected to be made next year .
after the renov@@ ation , pav@@ ing and plan@@ ting of the old school farm within the two sides of the 19@@ 12 building school , the school must be closed as a follow-up measure for the fores@@ ee@@ able future , which will require renov@@ ation .
the historic , one-@@ hundred year old barri@@ er of the old school court to the kir@@ ch@@ stra@@ ß@@ e , is mainly caused by water and fro@@ st damage , as there is no dra@@ in@@ age , and has a ar@@ c tend@@ ency and a ar@@ ch .
deep cr@@ acks in individual stones testi@@ fy to weather damage , but the wall is not at present at risk of collapse .
a strong wall is a pre@@ requisite for a school court used by students , which is what has been done by the current for@@ ti@@ fications .
originally , the school court re@@ hab@@ ilitation was even planned for the years 2008 / 2009 , but high un@@ planned expenditure brought a postpon@@ ement .
an important word in the historical renov@@ ation of the school walls , which was even used for film sho@@ ots , will be the regional heritage office .
if you have any suggestions from this site , the city of br@@ ä@@ un@@ ling@@ en hopes to receive subsidies from the mon@@ ument preser@@ vers .
the students of br@@ ä@@ un@@ ling@@ er primary school , who have now returned to a well restored old school building with new a@@ ula , can soon visit the old school cour@@ ty@@ ard .
ö@@ z@@ dem@@ ir wants to receive jazz training in stutt@@ gart .
in the ongoing discussions about the future of the music col@@ leg@@ es in bad@@ en-@@ w@@ ür@@ t@@ tem@@ berg , ce@@ m ö@@ z@@ dem@@ ir , the german green party chairman , has now also joined .
&quot; i think it is wrong to take ho@@ lis@@ tic training in the musi@@ k@@ ho@@ ch@@ sch@@ u@@ le stutt@@ gart &quot; , said ö@@ z@@ dem@@ ir the &quot; stutt@@ gart news &quot; .
jazz and classical are just some of the most important elements of the jazz scene in stutt@@ gart .
this is a contradic@@ tion to ö@@ z@@ dem@@ ir , who in stutt@@ gart was the favorite for a direct mandate at the german elections on 22 september , who is the green red government .
this is based on a study by experts , which is aimed at re@@ organis@@ ing the five music schools in bad@@ en-@@ w@@ ür@@ t@@ tem@@ berg .
after that , the programme of study , jazz and pop , is to be launched from the musi@@ k@@ ho@@ ch@@ sch@@ u@@ le stutt@@ gart to the man@@ n@@ heim university of music .
us border : &quot; super tunnel &quot; to s@@ mu@@ gg@@ le drugs discovered
on the mex@@ ic@@ an and us border , investig@@ ators have built a &quot; super tunnel &quot; to s@@ mu@@ gg@@ le drugs and have closed them .
as the us customs authorities have said , the more than 500 metr@@ e long tube between ti@@ ju@@ ana and san di@@ e@@ go was covered with electricity , railway tracks and an v@@ enti@@ lation system .
three susp@@ ects have therefore been arrested , eight tonnes mari@@ ju@@ ana and almost 150 kil@@ o@@ gram@@ s of co@@ ca@@ ine conf@@ is@@ c@@ ated .
the tunnel , according to the data , had not yet been used .
&quot; these car@@ te@@ ls are st@@ up@@ id if they think they could be di@@ gging under the rad@@ ar , &quot; said the att@@ or@@ ney general of southern california &apos;s southern california district .
the drug gan@@ gs are insu@@ red by du@@ ff@@ y : &quot; if you continue to build such tun@@ nels and try to use them , we are determined to make a huge waste of your dir@@ ty money &quot; .
both the us authorities and the mex@@ ic@@ an security forces are in a permanent struggle against drug car@@ te@@ ls .
since 2006 , mexico has seen more than 7@@ 7@@ ,000 people killed in connection with drug crime .
constructed by experts
due to the elabor@@ ate equipment of the tunnel , the investig@@ ators assume that it was designed by architec@@ ts and engineers and that the construction was carried out for about a year .
the track was equipped to provide electr@@ ically operated cars .
on the mex@@ ic@@ an side , the access is in a building that is 80 metres from the border .
according to the authorities , a lad@@ der takes 20 meters into the depth to the actual tunnel entrance .
the tunnel has a cross-@@ section of 1.@@ 20 meters height and 90 cen@@ time@@ ters width .
it would have been a good way of encouraging illegal immigration towards the united states .
two of the susp@@ ects were arrested in connection with the co@@ ca@@ ine fund .
the third , a mex@@ ic@@ an , was arrested for the se@@ iz@@ ure mari@@ ju@@ ana .
all three face the threat of li@@ fel@@ ong de@@ priv@@ ation of freedom , as officials have said .
eight such tun@@ nels have been discovered since 2006 , and the press conference in san di@@ e@@ go has continued to do so .
however , it is the first time that ko@@ ka@@ in has been found in such a tunnel .
co@@ ca@@ ine is usually produced in smaller quantities and not by tun@@ nels .
this shows the &apos; desper@@ ation &apos; of drug gan@@ gs , whose traditional routes have now been cut off , bill sh@@ er@@ man said of the drug search de@@ a in san di@@ e@@ go .
they would do everything they can to get to the us .
no details have been made available on the de@@ tain@@ e@@ es , at least one of them was mex@@ ic@@ ans .
they must be given prison sent@@ ences of up to ten years .
20@@ 14 is the fe@@ ast of the year 20@@ 14 of the ge@@ is@@ inger fe@@ st@@ ja@@ hr
the anniversary of the city of ge@@ is@@ ingen on the occasion of the 12@@ 50 .
the first mention of the church is coming back .
if the year ends in just over eight weeks , the anniversary year is appro@@ aching .
ge@@ is@@ ingen und kir@@ ch@@ en-@@ haus@@ en were first mentioned in documents together in 7@@ 94 .
a document was produced in churches , in which both places are mentioned .
on 15 march there will be an official start to the anniversary year , and since ge@@ is@@ ingen currently has no hall , this opening event will take place in the place where a new exhibition was held 12@@ 50 years ago , both of which were mentioned .
during the anniversary , several events have been held in ge@@ is@@ ingen , as well as in kir@@ ch@@ en-@@ haus@@ en .
kir@@ ch@@ en-@@ haus@@ en will be held in july on a festival weekend from 18th to 20th july the 12@@ 50 .
celebrate re@@ vers@@ al .
on friday with a cere@@ mony , on saturday and sunday with a festival around the church hall .
on this weekend the church house church of st. martin is also celebrated .
city music director ru@@ dol@@ f bar@@ th has presented a new album of works for the city on the occasion of the anniversary .
on june 21 , together with the sunday anniversary of the sch@@ war@@ z@@ wal@@ d@@ vere@@ in , on july 12 in the arena with fire@@ works and on december 13 as the first concert of the city music in the new f@@ es@@ th@@ al@@ le .
this will be completed in the anniversary year and in@@ aug@@ ur@@ ated , the official date is last september weekend , 27 and 28 september .
on the occasion of the ge@@ is@@ inger city anniversary , a new chron@@ ic@@ le is also being published .
&quot; but a chron@@ ic@@ le should not only be of ho@@ stage itself , but a printed work about the ho@@ stage of today , which is also made of ge@@ is@@ ingen , kir@@ chen@@ haus@@ en , le@@ ip@@ zi@@ g , a@@ ul@@ fing@@ en .
and today ’ s ho@@ w@@ ling celebra@@ tes 20@@ 14 birth@@ day , 197@@ 4 was the first space with the comm@@ on@@ alities .
the new chron@@ ic@@ le will be published on november 21 or 22 in the new f@@ es@@ th@@ al@@ le in ge@@ is@@ ingen .
20@@ 14 is also a year of many anni@@ vers@@ aries .
the nar@@ r@@ ation stra@@ h@@ gl@@ on@@ ki starts on february 8 with a traditional evening on the occasion of its 6@@ 0-@@ year old existence , the harmony gu@@ t@@ mad@@ ingen will be 90 years and has been celebr@@ ating the festival on march 29 and then .
the old le@@ i@@ p@@ fer@@ d@@ ingen plant is 40 years old , the ge@@ is@@ inger school has been in its new location for 50 years and celebra@@ tes it on 10 may , the musi@@ k@@ vere@@ in poly@@ hy@@ m@@ nia le@@ i@@ pers@@ wei@@ g celebra@@ tes 150 years old and celebra@@ tes this in july .
the city of ge@@ is@@ ingen was founded in a don@@ ation document owned by the monaster@@ y of st. g@@ allen in 7@@ 64 for the first time .
the certificate was issued in churches ( haus@@ en ) , which was then court .
both communities are thus mentioned in the same document .
this 12@@ 50 year old is celebr@@ ating the same reason in 20@@ 14 , and the municip@@ al reform is also 40 years back .
the council is targe@@ ting track systems
should the railway transition be lab@@ ori@@ ously re@@ constructed to reduce traffic safety ?
yes , the local counc@@ ils have decided .
sch@@ il@@ t@@ ach must provide eur 2@@ 20 000 for this .
deutsche bahn is planning to open the kin@@ zi@@ g@@ tal railway next year .
in particular , it is intended to increase safety at railway cros@@ s@@ ings - there are regular col@@ li@@ sions between trains and other vehicles across the country .
do the municip@@ alities agree to the restructuring measures , they must contribute by one third to the costs , the rest share the railways and the federal government .
sch@@ il@@ t@@ ach &apos;s may@@ or ro@@ land gri@@ e@@ ß@@ hab@@ er explained to the local council the p@@ ecu@@ li@@ arities of the ba@@ h transition &quot; am h@@ ir@@ sch@@ en &quot; .
the city plans to build a new railway station in the same area , in the same way as the tun@@ nel@@ mun@@ d there to the west of the railway tracks .
larger vehicles , such as those trans@@ porting long-@@ distance wood , could also be in contact with the traffic without the need to block the tracks .
greek owners therefore proposed to create a necessary support wall in such a way that the city could be the next street in due course .
this was discussed controversial in the local council , as some counc@@ ils stressed the need for road distribution : thomas ki@@ p@@ p put the mo@@ od of cri@@ tics to the point : &apos; do we have to be so much money in so few vehicles &apos; ?
may@@ or thomas ha@@ as dis@@ agreed : the railway crossing &quot; h@@ ir@@ sch@@ en &quot; was used regularly for long-@@ distance transport .
even wood from the &quot; ku@@ h@@ bach &quot; area is partly trans@@ ported over this route , because the vehicles up to 20 metres long make it impossible to use the route at the h@@ ä@@ ber@@ les bridge because they could not turn into the main road .
the route also serves as a re@@ direc@@ ting for those vehicles that cannot use the tunnel when the main road is closed , argu@@ ably because of the fact that ha@@ as is not allowed to use it .
it is clear that the church mountain and castle tunnel are being re@@ constructed and renovated .
the counc@@ ils agreed to investigate the costs of the planned extension of the road and to investigate the possible consequences .
despite this , several member states agreed to the restructuring of the railway transition , with the pro@@ vis@@ o that the necessary support wall should be built in such a way that the city could take the road that leads to the &quot; ba@@ hn@@ ho@@ f@@ stra@@ ß@@ e &quot; to &quot; ( 5@@ ,@@ 5 km ) for meeting point where necessary ) for meeting traffic .
the reconstruction of the railway crossing at the ger@@ ber@@ i@@ um tr@@ aut@@ we@@ in could , however , lead to a quite different problem , which would make it easier to access the gro@@ ss@@ ly rising &quot; ger@@ ol@@ t@@ sh@@ ä@@ user we@@ g &quot; .
the administration had to implement the railway reconstruction plans from the engineering office of the engineering company brun@@ ling@@ er , because she had doubts about whether the planned connection of the ger@@ ol@@ t@@ sh@@ ä@@ user would be possible without further ado .
the investigation concluded that it was not possible to rule out that the conditions of road inc@@ lin@@ ation could lead to longer vehicles being se@@ ated .
the city , in turn , bears responsibility for this as a road lo@@ ad@@ er .
the re@@ building could therefore lead to liability disputes .
since both the wood removal and the ben@@ ding are working in the current state of expansion , the re@@ building of the railway transition should not be approved , ha@@ as argu@@ ed .
it is also worth no@@ ting that there is a risk of a col@@ li@@ sion of the train with a vehicle on the transition stage that is much lower than the other cros@@ s@@ ings because the stop is right next to the middle , which is well connected .
even trains from the central station would have to be bra@@ ked to the point where no col@@ li@@ sion threat@@ ens .
the majority of the members voted against the restructuring of this railway transition , as the city of sch@@ il@@ t@@ ach has &quot; mas@@ tered &quot; the problem of vehicles in the way they are se@@ ated , as the railways are with@@ drawing responsibility from the construction work .
the board considers the modi@@ fications of the railway cros@@ s@@ ings &quot; before heu@@ bach &quot; and &quot; before ku@@ h@@ bach &quot; , for which the agreements with the railway have already been made .
es@@ a deci@@ des on major space missions : missions for bil@@ lions of people , for bil@@ lions of dollars , for bil@@ lions of dollars , for the world &apos;s largest projects : missions for bil@@ lions of dollars , for bil@@ lions of dollars ,
dist@@ ant plan@@ ets , gra@@ vit@@ ational waves or black ho@@ les - experts from the european space agency must now focus on two major projects that they will be able to launch in the next few years .
30 proposals were on the table , five are still in the race .
dist@@ ant worl@@ ds .
more than 1000 plan@@ ets in other stars have already found a@@ stronom@@ ers .
whether or not there are at least some of them , no one knows .
the choice is hard : if you are looking for gra@@ vit@@ ational waves ?
or would you prefer to explore the origin of the co@@ smo@@ s ?
or search for plan@@ ets similar to earth , and thus discover ali@@ en life ?
these are the questions that the european space agency es@@ a is responsible for .
for your program &quot; co@@ sm@@ ic vision &quot; you are looking for ideas for two major space projects that will make a decisive contribution to the research .
the budget for such &quot; l missions &quot; is approximately eur 1 billion each .
the launch is expected to be in 20@@ 28 and 20@@ 34 .
in early september , the elite of european space research met in paris to put forward proposals for such missions .
thir@@ ty ideas were on the table , five of them have now come to the closer elections .
numerous bodies are assess@@ ing the proposals to make ho@@ o@@ ks for researchers .
a final decision is to be taken in the next few days by the scientific programme committee .
the es@@ a has selected four major questions , to which the missions of the co@@ sm@@ ic vision programme , which was launched in 2007 , should respond .
what are the conditions for the creation of plan@@ ets and lives ?
the exact processes of the formation of stars from large gas cl@@ ou@@ ds - and thus the creation of plan@@ ets that convert these stars - are always in the spo@@ t@@ light .
a large infra@@ red tel@@ es@@ cope in space could pen@@ etr@@ ate this dark .
and if a star own@@ s plan@@ ets , what circumstances can live there ?
in order to address this issue , the space tel@@ es@@ cope &quot; che@@ ops &quot; is to be launched in 20@@ 17 , with which 500 already known plan@@ etary systems will be examined in more detail in our vicinity .
however , the possibilities are limited , che@@ ops is a small mission with a budget of 150 million euros .
with larger instruments , a@@ stronom@@ ers could map earth like plan@@ ets and even analy@@ ze the composition of their atmo@@ sp@@ he@@ res , and thus search for &quot; bi@@ om@@ ar@@ kers &quot; : g@@ ases that are considered indic@@ ations of biological activity .
how does the solar system work ?
this issue , too , should ultimately be clari@@ fied as to what conditions exist for the creation of life .
magnetic activity is an important factor in a star and the interaction of its magnetic field and the magnetic field of partic@@ le radiation with the plan@@ etary x-@@ ray system .
in our solar system , these processes can be investig@@ ated ex@@ em@@ pl@@ arily .
with the &quot; solar or@@ bi@@ ter &quot; , es@@ a has already launched a m class mission ( where the budget is about half a billion euros ) for this question .
the pro@@ be was to start in 20@@ 17 and monitor the surface and activity of the sun closely .
it is also of great interest to researchers that j@@ up@@ i@@ ter and his moon are also present .
they want to find out what role the giant planet plays in the development of the solar system .
the es@@ a sees this as the first of the three l-@@ missions of the co@@ sm@@ ic vision programme .
the pro@@ be &quot; ju@@ ice &quot; ( j@@ up@@ i@@ ter ic@@ y mo@@ ons explorer ) is expected to start their journey in 20@@ 22 .
eight years later , she reached j@@ up@@ i@@ ter and was supposed to experience the atmosphere of the planet and the ic@@ y moon of europe , k@@ all@@ is@@ to and gan@@ y@@ med .
what are the basic physical laws of the universe ?
the space offers many possibilities to study and study matter in extreme conditions , and to investigate whether the laws of nature we know are still valid there .
perhaps there are also de@@ vi@@ ations that could pa@@ ve the way for physi@@ ci@@ sts to develop a new theory under which all known natural laws can be united .
how did the universe come into being and what is it made of ?
our company was created 13@@ .@@ 7 billion years ago by the big ban@@ g .
in addition to the material we know , from the stars , plan@@ ets and living beings as we exist , there are dark matter , whose gra@@ vity gal@@ ax@@ ies and gal@@ ax@@ ies are cl@@ us@@ tered together , and dark .
so far , researchers have not known which physical laws were en@@ acted in the first fr@@ action of the big ban@@ g , nor what dark words were derived from it .
with &quot; eu@@ cli@@ d &quot; , es@@ a has already approved an m-@@ mission here , which is scheduled to start in 2020 .
a special tel@@ es@@ cope is used to determine the distribution of the matter in the universe for the first time in the sky , thus providing information on the nature of dark matter and dark matter .
who could run the race
of the 30 proposals , only two are left at the end of the selection process .
the best chance of obtaining an l mission has , according to many experts , been &quot; e-@@ lis@@ a &quot; , a challenging concept for the detection of gra@@ vit@@ ational waves .
this means physi@@ ci@@ sts understand changes in the structure of space , which al@@ bert e@@ inste@@ in predic@@ ted nearly 100 years ago .
they have not been proven to date .
el@@ is@@ a could do that , hope the scientists behind the project .
the mission consists of two or three prob@@ es and is located in space .
it could also be gra@@ vit@@ ational w@@ av@@ el@@ eng@@ ths , unlike plants on earth , which were created at the big ban@@ g , and thus provide new insi@@ ghts into the formation of the co@@ smo@@ s .
four other proposals are still compe@@ ting around the second l mission : a great x-@@ ray tel@@ es@@ cope called &quot; ath@@ ena &quot; , which includes black ho@@ les .
the hotel is located in the heart of the city , close to the main train station and the main train station .
snow@@ den ready to cooperate with germany in terms of us surveillance ,
ed@@ ward snow@@ den , the wh@@ ist@@ le@@ b@@ lower of the us intelligence service , has declared that he is ready to travel to berlin and to leave for the german bun@@ de@@ sta@@ g if the american national security agency and its representative are present .
german me@@ p han@@ s-@@ christian str@@ ö@@ be@@ le met snow@@ den in russia on thursday , where he received asylum in order to discuss with him the statement in germany .
in a letter from snow@@ den , which was sent to the media in berlin by str@@ ö@@ be@@ le on friday , he wri@@ tes : “ although the outcome of my efforts was demonstr@@ ably positive , my government continues to treat a dis@@ s@@ enting opinion as a dis@@ s@@ enti@@ ent .
but telling the truth is not a crime .
in the letter snow@@ den wri@@ tes that he is convinced that the support of the international community will convince the american government to withdraw the charge against him .
the united states department of justice ’ s indic@@ tment includes es@@ pi@@ on@@ age and the@@ ft of state property .
german interior minister han@@ s-@@ peter fried@@ rich said to time online : “ if mr snow@@ den is prepared to talk to german representatives , then we will find ways to make that possible . ”
us@@ -@@ germany relations have been stra@@ ined by claims that the n@@ sa has not yet fully supported chancell@@ or ang@@ ela mer@@ kel ’ s cell phone .
thomas op@@ per@@ mann , the member who asked the parliamentary committee responsible for the secret service , said that we should take the opportunity to witness snow@@ den as a witness , if that is possible , ‘ without jeopar@@ dis@@ ing relations and strengthening relations ’ .
str@@ ö@@ be@@ le , a member of the greens , published a picture of himself and snow@@ den in his t@@ wit@@ ter feed .
he was visited by two german journalists during his visit to russia .
str@@ ö@@ be@@ le explained that according to the law@@ yer of the former n@@ sa employee snow@@ den could not return to russia if he left the country .
if snow@@ den in germany says , then he needs a assurance that he will be “ safe ” there , according to the honourable member .
snow@@ den explains in his letter that he is committed to a “ serious and ongoing ” persecu@@ tion campaign that would exclu@@ de him from his home country .
however , it was touched by the global response to “ my act of political expression . ”
citizens around the world , as well as high-@@ level politicians – including in the united states – have been watching the rev@@ el@@ ations about an un@@ controlled system of comprehensive surveillance as a credit to the general public .
in his letter , snow@@ den makes a offer to the german authorities of cooperation “ if the humanitarian difficulties have been resolved ” .
fronti@@ er airlines charges a handling fee for hand bag@@ gage .
fronti@@ er airlines plans to invest up to 100 us dollars from passengers travelling on their flight .
fronti@@ er airlines intends to pay up to usd 100 for one piece of hand bag@@ gage and two dollars for coffee or le@@ mon@@ ade , even though the announcement on wednesday was to be read that passengers were not paying the whole can .
the new fee applies to hand bag@@ gage in the luggage com@@ part@@ ment above the seat , small bags under the seat are still free .
fronti@@ er said that it would be calculated to pay 25 us dollars in advance , and $ 100 in the case of passengers who arrive at the gate .
fron@@ ti@@ er spo@@ kes@@ woman k@@ ate o &apos;@@ mal@@ ley said the fee of 100 us dollars targets to encourage travellers to move ahead on payment .
“ we do not want to calcul@@ ate this sum , ” she explained .
airlines began to pay for the first and second piece of bag@@ gage in 2008 .
passengers who tried to by@@ pass them have therefore paid as much as possible in their hand bag@@ gage , which means that they are not allowed to carry luggage over the seat .
charges are a way of encouraging passengers to take less on board .
o &apos;@@ mal@@ ley said that the new fee is not really about making money .
it is about the most loy@@ al customers of fronti@@ er who have clearly stated that it will be increasingly difficult to find a place in the com@@ part@@ ment above the seat .
passengers who have purchased their tickets on the airline website do not have to pay .
this means that a passenger on the plane may be required to carry a bag@@ gage with him , the next person , but $ 100 for a similar piece of bag@@ gage .
o &apos;@@ mal@@ ley explained the site of fronti@@ er and the check-in procedures would be changed so that passengers would be informed of the charge before they travel to the gate .
fronti@@ er ’ s new hand bag@@ gage fee only ent@@ ers into force in the summer , and a date is not yet in place .
passengers often sm@@ ell of bag@@ gage allow@@ ances and other charges , but airlines like to resort to them .
they argue that the transportation of luggage costs money and passengers can pay for this service if they wish .
many on wall street view the new bag@@ gage charges as a sign that airlines are taking enough money to pay the cost of air travel after years of losses .
most , however , have so far been le@@ tting the fing@@ ers of hand bag@@ gage charges .
spirit airlines inc@@ . requested three years ago the first charges for hand bag@@ gage and later alle@@ gi@@ ant air , also a low-@@ cost airline .
the only other airline with such a charge is the hungarian wi@@ z@@ z air , the airline advis@@ or j@@ ay so@@ ren@@ sen , who has paid the extra charges atten@@ tively .
he estimated in a report of december 2011 that the w@@ ris@@ t hand bag@@ gage fee would bring in usd 50 million a year .
so@@ ren@@ sen , who previously held a leading position at mid@@ west airlines , is recently awarded with spirit .
“ the boarding process was one of the most smooth i have ever seen in my career in aviation .
i expected to cr@@ ack te@@ eth and hand@@ y discussions at the gate .
“ the plane was full , ” he said , “ and boarding ran as lu@@ m@@ bered . ”
fronti@@ er also follows spirit with the 2 dollars that are used for coffee , tea , le@@ mon@@ ade or ju@@ ice .
the company stated that passengers who have to buy le@@ mon@@ ade or ju@@ ice must keep the whole can and buy coffee for free .
water is still free .
us air@@ ways had briefly tried to provide a re@@ fri@@ ger@@ ation for soft drinks in 2008 , but made it un@@ do seven months later , after passengers compla@@ ined and no other major company had followed .
fron@@ ti@@ ers &apos; move to impose charges on hand bag@@ gage if passengers are not buying directly from the airline is the latest initiative to enable customers to access their own website .
airlines pay online travel agencies such as or@@ bit@@ z $ 10 to $ 25 per ticket sold .
this will give all companies an incentive to buy passengers directly from them rather than through an online travel agency .
however , fronti@@ er has gone the fur@@ th@@ est in this area .
in september , the company began to offer only half the number of frequent fl@@ yer flights on booking through an online travel agency .
on wednesday , the mil@@ e@@ age was increased to 25 percent of the route .
a contract with a third party with fronti@@ er over 1000 miles brings customers a single mil@@ e@@ age of 250 miles .
passengers can also only buy tickets directly on the fron@@ ti@@ er website .
fronti@@ er has a loy@@ al customer base at its headquarters in den@@ ver , but the business is shr@@ in@@ king and the company is losing money .
the proce@@ eds were down by 9 % and the capacity was down by just under 13 percent in the first quarter , as the financial report , which was published on wednesday by the parent company , republic airlines .
republic@@ s has tried to use the company &apos;s sales to finance fron@@ ti@@ er .
pro@@ ver@@ bs come from the bi@@ ble
some 40 women attended the last women ’ s breakfast this year in the ev@@ angel@@ ical par@@ ish of b@@ is@@ ingen .
the theme of the day in the municip@@ al house were &quot; pro@@ ver@@ bs from the bi@@ ble &quot; and &quot; re@@ de@@ mp@@ tions from the middle ages &quot; .
z@@ ita kö@@ h@@ ler , the chairman of the church council , went to a lec@@ ture on the bi@@ b@@ lic@@ al pro@@ ver@@ bs after breakfast .
&quot; pro@@ ver@@ bs contain wis@@ dom , rules , or war@@ nings , &quot; she explained .
she compared several pro@@ ver@@ bs with the corresponding bi@@ ble posts and explained the meaning .
she called pro@@ ver@@ bs like : &quot; catch the ho@@ se , &quot; as sc@@ ales fall from the eyes , cast an eye on someone who gives his lord &apos;s sleep , his hands in un@@ guil@@ ty .
the speaker has repeatedly let her list@@ en@@ ers know which pro@@ ver@@ b was the subject of this debate .
the medieval phrase used to refer to the church community of christ de@@ hn@@ er .
she explained the importance and origin of the words she used to call &apos; brid@@ ges to the past &apos; .
in the end , a ra@@ ff@@ le was lost .
the price was covered on a table and were hum@@ or@@ ously re@@ written before they were handed over to the winners .

learning instead of unemployed : pilot project for un@@ skilled people in tourism
at the mec@@ k@@ len@@ bur@@ g@@ is@@ che la@@ ke@@ -@@ star@@ te@@ the@@ ite a pilot project for the tourism industry .
under the leadership of the german employment agency , 49 women and men who are already working as un@@ skilled in the industry are to become professionals for hotels and restaurants over three winter years .
&quot; what is new is that the six@@ -@@ month courses end with degrees , &quot; said car@@ men wi@@ ec@@ her@@ t of the employment agency neu@@ brand@@ enburg .
the benefits are diverse : the participants would not be unemployed , the firms would be trained professionals , who would be increasingly active in hotels and restaurants , and the agency would have to avoid financing unemployment .
the project also includes the chamber of commerce in neu@@ brand@@ enburg and the german hotel and restaurant association .
n@@ sa decla@@ res that an “ internal error ” and not h@@ ack@@ ers are to blame for the cr@@ ash of the site ’ s website , and not h@@ ack@@ ers are to blame for the cr@@ ash of the site .
the sh@@ ad@@ ow@@ y national security agency said late friday that a mistake had left your public website a few hours lam@@ ented and not h@@ ack@@ ers , as was claimed online .
“ n@@ sa@@ .@@ go@@ v was un@@ reach@@ able for a few hours this night because during a planned update an internal error occurred , ” explained the es@@ pi@@ on@@ age agency in an e-mail sent to us .
the problem will be fixed this evening .
the claim that the failure is due to a distributed den@@ ial of service attack ( d@@ dos ) is a non@@ sense .
in the early hours of the evening , online server tr@@ ack@@ ers noticed that the n@@ sa website was not reach@@ able for at least six hours and that this is still not possible for some users .
previously , a n@@ sa spo@@ kes@@ man had declared to ab@@ c news that the agency ’ s sensitive internal network was “ not at all ” com@@ promised .
secret information is not in danger , the speaker says .
at least one group of h@@ ack@@ ti@@ vi@@ sts claimed to have created the n@@ sa website with a d@@ dos attack .
such attacks will cause the target site to be floo@@ ded with page views until the servers are over@@ loaded and the site collap@@ ses .
cy@@ ber@@ tac@@ tics are relatively simple and the attacks do not serve to inter@@ f@@ ere with the internal network of the target system .
the former super@@ -@@ secret n@@ sa , whose n@@ ick@@ name once used to be no such agency , is now in the bright light of the public and is looking for the new ones that have emerged in recent months .
the growing dispute over intelligence has fu@@ el@@ ed initial spec@@ ulation that the incident today is the result of a targeted and targeted cy@@ per@@ sur@@ gery .
the number of people without jobs fell slightly by 22 in october to 1.@@ 30@@ 7 .
although the rate was better than last year , at 3.@@ 1 % , and better than in september , &apos; we would have hoped for more &apos; , says mon@@ i@@ ka fel@@ der bau@@ er , depu@@ ty head of the agency &apos;s business unit .
many businesses have re@@ acted to recru@@ it@@ ment practices .
one reason for this is , according to fel@@ der bau@@ er : &quot; we have few skilled workers in the cra@@ fts , in the health sector and in the care of the elderly &quot; .
since september , job offers for employees in the hotel and restaurant sector have been running again due to the seas@@ ons .
the winter season begins there in mid-@@ december .

losses in bom@@ bar@@ di@@ er after dec@@ lining supply and orders ,
the can@@ a@@ dian aircraft and railway manufacturer bom@@ bar@@ di@@ er inc reported a 15@@ -@@ percent increase in the net share of the profits on thursday after he had been hit by dec@@ lining orders and deli@@ veries on aircraft in the third quarter .
bom@@ bar@@ di@@ er , based in mon@@ tre@@ al , also did not publish flight test data for his brand new c@@ series aircraft and did not provide any new information as to whether the aircraft was being delivered in accordance with the ambitious timetable for next september .
on the ma@@ ide@@ n flight of the test aircraft a month and a half ago , only three more were launched , which makes it question@@ able whether the test phase is proce@@ eding as planned .
the results have fallen short of the forec@@ asts and led to a drop in the share price of more than eight percent at the tor@@ onto stock exchange .
camer@@ on do@@ er@@ k@@ sen , analy@@ st at national bank financial , reduced his assessment of “ ou@@ tre@@ ach ” on “ sector performance ” in terms of how the bank ’ s shares are expected to grow in the next one or two quarters .
“ although weak@@ er delivery figures for aircraft were expected to the greatest extent , the margin@@ s in the transport sector were clearly disappointed , ” says do@@ er@@ k@@ sen in a customer letter .
we believe that bom@@ bar@@ di@@ er should place new orders for the c@@ series if the test program for the aircraft is progres@@ sing .
if , however , no new orders are announced in the coming months , we expect the market to become more s@@ cep@@ tical about the programme .
bom@@ bar@@ di@@ er hopes that the c@@ series aircraft will take the company to the lower market segment of cat@@ ap@@ ul@@ ti@@ sed , which is currently being developed by bo@@ eing and airbus .
the first test aircraft was presented to the public in march and fle@@ w for the first time in september after months of delays .
however , binding orders for the c@@ series have been moderate at 17@@ 7 , as potential bu@@ yers are waiting for the results of the flight tests and want to see if the company ’ s claims regarding fuel efficiency and cost-@@ saving potential of the new no@@ zz@@ le are accurate .
there are currently 4@@ 03 orders and commitments from 15 customers and companies .
ceo pi@@ er@@ re beau@@ do@@ in is confident that bom@@ bar@@ di@@ er will achieve his goal of 300 binding orders at the beginning of commercial use of the jet .
on thursday , the management insu@@ red against analy@@ sts and the media that the program was in the schedule .
“ the test aircraft has stopped standing on the ground than expected , ” said beau@@ do@@ in at a telephone conference and added that during the flight ’ s life there were ground tests and software updates scheduled .
each manufacturer plans differently .
we have decided to take a first flight and then to add a period of re@@ working , which we have done .
this is happening throughout the entire programme .
the second of five test aircraft is expected to start in the next few weeks , the rest shortly after , it was said by the company side .
yet analy@@ sts remain ske@@ p@@ tical about whether 12 months after the ma@@ ide@@ n flight the first customer will be able to take a c@@ series aircraft into service .
bom@@ bar@@ di@@ er explained that it will check the planning for commission@@ ing ( ice ) and will be updated in the coming months .
“ the slow progress of the flight test – even though it seems to be in line with bom@@ bar@@ di@@ er ’ s internal planning – rein@@ forces our view that commission@@ ing should be postpon@@ ed to the first quarter of 20@@ 15 , ” said do@@ er@@ sen .
in the third quarter , at the end of september 30 , bom@@ bar@@ di@@ er ’ s net gain fell to $ 14@@ 7 million , or $ 8 c@@ ents per share , from $ 17@@ 2 million , respectively , to $ 9 c@@ ents per year earlier .
the adjusted profit per share is 9 c@@ ents .
sales decreas@@ ed slightly , falling from 4.@@ 2 to 4.@@ 1 billion dollars .
analy@@ sts had a profit of 10 c@@ ents per share and a tur@@ nover of 4.@@ 56 billion dollars , so th@@ om@@ son re@@ u@@ ters i / b / e / s .
the world ’ s fourth largest aircraft manufacturer says that it has delivered 45 aircraft in this quarter , a decline of 57 last year .
net orders fell from 8@@ 3 aircraft to 26 .
the order book for the aero@@ space division was 3@@ 2.@@ 9 billion dollars on 30 september , and was thus un@@ changed compared to 31 december .
“ in the aero@@ space sector , the results were within our limits , but the low order in@@ take and the overall market conditions were dis@@ appoin@@ ting , ” said beau@@ do@@ in .
sales in the aero@@ space division fell by 13 percent to two billion dollars .
bom@@ bar@@ di@@ er , the world ’ s largest railway manufacturer , announced that sales in this sector were down by just under 11 percent to $ 2.@@ 1 billion .
the transport division ’ s order book stood at $ 3@@ 2.@@ 6 billion on 30 september , slightly increasing compared with 31 december .
the profit mar@@ gin in the area of transport was reduced by resolution problems in some major contracts .
according to the management , there will be new requirements for the fourth quarter .
in the afternoon trading on thursday , the bom@@ bar@@ di@@ er share dro@@ pped by 8.@@ 5 percent and stood at 4.@@ 8@@ 3 can@@ a@@ dian dollars after it was announced that the google financial board would support pat@@ ric@@ k pic@@ he@@ tte .
the braz@@ ili@@ an em@@ bra@@ er sa , the world ’ s third largest commercial aircraft manufacturer and bom@@ bar@@ di@@ er ’ s clo@@ s@@ est ri@@ val , reported a 10 % decline in quar@@ ter@@ ly profit on thursday .
usa : sho@@ ts at los angel@@ es airport
an unknown person has left the city on friday morning at la@@ x airport .
while the airport management has the t@@ wit@@ ter short message service , the bul@@ let was kept in cust@@ o@@ dy , the &quot; los angel@@ es ti@@ mes &quot; reported , the man was dead .
a security man was also killed .
media also reported several in@@ ju@@ red people .
us president bar@@ ack obama is constantly being informed about the situation , said the white house spo@@ kes@@ man , j@@ ay car@@ ney .
the incident occurred in terminal 3 e@@ ye@@ wit@@ nesses indicated that a sho@@ o@@ ter was sho@@ oting with a gun in one of the departure h@@ alls , as several media reported .
a travell@@ er told the station c@@ n@@ n that many people had been looking for protection in pan@@ ic .
travellers would have cri@@ ed and cri@@ ed for children .
among the waiting was pan@@ ic , many would have f@@ led behind chairs for fear .
he heard two sho@@ ts , says a travell@@ er of the &quot; los angel@@ es times &quot; .
a security officer , t@@ sa , has suffered a shot in@@ jury at his foot .
the scene was &quot; as in a movie &quot; .
he was then brought into a security area , the man reported .
the sho@@ ts should have fallen close to a safety control area .
airport building ev@@ ac@@ u@@ ated
on television scre@@ ens , it was clear how many am@@ bul@@ ance and police cars were in front of a terminal .
hundreds of people were brought out of the building to safety .
users on t@@ wit@@ ter published photos of a special command and a gr@@ oun@@ d-@@ based gun .
as the airport management told us about t@@ wit@@ ter , the incident began at 9.@@ 30 a.m. ( local time ) .
the access roads were bloc@@ ked , which , according to c@@ n@@ n , was a long back@@ log .
until the land@@ ings , air traffic had been tempor@@ arily stopped .
however , several plan@@ es were also visible on c@@ n@@ n at the start .
terminal 3 is mainly used by smaller us airlines .
los angel@@ es airport is one of the largest airports in the united states .
co@@ ca@@ ine ad@@ dic@@ ted law@@ yer , the drug bo@@ ss war@@ ned against police investigation , must be put in prison .
bas@@ har@@ at d@@ it@@ ta , 42 , gave information on under@@ world size ne@@ il scar@@ bor@@ ough further .
the law@@ yer was afraid that his secret drug dependence might come to light .
it was founded by the li@@ ver@@ pool cro@@ wn court to three years in prison .
a well-known criminal def@@ en@@ der who has a drug bar@@ on in front of a major police investigation because he was afraid to declare his secret drug ad@@ diction was too late for three years .
bas@@ har@@ at d@@ it@@ ta , 42 , supplied under@@ world size ne@@ il scar@@ bor@@ ough with sensitive information on investigations of its activities in the drug trade after he had been replaced by his own co@@ ca@@ ine ad@@ diction .
the “ first ” crime prize , p@@ raised by crimin@@ alists , with the n@@ ick@@ name “ bas@@ h ” , was arrested in his house in 2011 , after the police took over scar@@ bor@@ ough , whom he had previously been in a police force .
officials observed how scar@@ bor@@ ough ( 32 ) had three bags co@@ ca@@ ine at the house of law@@ yer in black@@ bur@@ n , lan@@ ca@@ sh@@ ire , ab@@ bre@@ vi@@ ated while this was working with colleagues at a dinner of the bar .
the investigation revealed that d@@ it@@ ta regularly uses class a drugs , which were used after testing had found trac@@ es of co@@ ca@@ ine in his hair , on his wal@@ let , and on credit cards .
over a period of eight months between january and august 2011 , he tried to obtain un@@ authorised information on the arrest of two men on behalf of scar@@ bor@@ ough and one of his partners .
all four susp@@ ects were arrested by the police at the time in a major investigation into the her@@ o@@ in and co@@ ca@@ ine trade in lan@@ cas@@ hire , cum@@ bri@@ a , mer@@ se@@ y@@ side , ber@@ k@@ sh@@ ire and west .
together with 32 other people , they were arrested later after the police had been killed in a series of house sear@@ ches for her@@ o@@ in and co@@ ca@@ ine worth £ 1.5 million and £ 200@@ ,000 in cash .
d@@ it@@ ta , 42 , passed information to the crimin@@ als because he fe@@ ared that his drug ad@@ diction could become public .
today d@@ it@@ ta , who is responsible for the law firm for@@ bes sol@@ ic@@ itors in black@@ bur@@ n , was listed on the li@@ ver@@ pool cro@@ wn court after a three-@@ week trial in two charges for disabled people .
he gave the co@@ ca@@ ine ownership on an earlier survey .
the law@@ yer was transferred after the police were not allowed to take part in their investigations against scar@@ bor@@ ough , finding that he was arrested on a regular basis in february 2011 .
two investig@@ ators followed the susp@@ ect and saw how he was sent@@ enced to d@@ it@@ ta &apos;s house and banned drugs with a pur@@ ity of 60 % in a black g@@ love under the mo@@ ll .
shortly after he had delivered the drugs , scar@@ bor@@ ough regularly tele@@ ph@@ oned with d@@ it@@ ta , who was on the street at the dinner in the black@@ bur@@ n ro@@ vers sta@@ dium in e@@ wood park .
the law@@ yer returned home , took the drugs and then nine members of the police were exp@@ elled .
in court , d@@ it@@ ta became known as a “ regular consumer ” of co@@ ca@@ ine after drugs from the class a test were found in his hair , his wal@@ let , and on his credit cards .
d@@ it@@ ta was later arrested , but refused to take co@@ ca@@ ine and said he had been with the alleg@@ ed deal@@ er that he was not able to meet his client , and claimed that her discussion was subject to discussion .
during his arrest , d@@ it@@ ta took his wal@@ let and tried to buy a series of credit cards , but they were secured and he was given a hair check .
in the case of police inter@@ ro@@ gation , he said that he was operating a police office under his private address and at work , and clients would be calling him at home for legal matters .
he was known to be important actors in the drug trade , some of which he had previously represented , after significant ar@@ re@@ sts and informed what the investigation was about .
prosecu@@ tor anne wh@@ y@@ te said : “ a criminal att@@ or@@ ney should know better than anyone that the law cannot be broken . ”
d@@ it@@ ta will not be able to prosecu@@ te the abuse of his position as a criminal def@@ en@@ der , because he has been too involved with certain clients .
the relationship in question is not simply that of a drug deal@@ er , but of a drug deal@@ er who supplies his law@@ yer with drugs .
part of his communications was undoubtedly legitimate , because he was the advoc@@ ate of these people .
but that went far beyond the b@@ ounds of a normal relationship between law@@ yer and client .
he was involved in police investigations as much as possible , so that he could continue to pursue criminal activities .
mr d@@ it@@ ta has thus dis@@ credited his profes@@ sion .
he was too close to certain clients , especially scar@@ bor@@ ough , and he allowed his independence to be com@@ promised .
d@@ it@@ ta pointed out any mis@@ conduct and claimed : “ if i am a corru@@ pt law@@ yer , what i am not , and information to scar@@ bor@@ ough , i would be very grateful .
but after the hearing , super@@ int@@ ent le@@ e hal@@ ste@@ ad said of the police in lan@@ cas@@ hire : “ mr d@@ it@@ ta took the step from a criminal def@@ en@@ der to a criminal at the moment he began to drugs .
his co@@ ca@@ ine dependence led to ho@@ p@@ eless com@@ promises and made him recep@@ tive to the mo@@ tives of leading members of organized crime who charged him with valuable information on police investigations .
lawyers must be able to maintain the highest standards of integrity and to ensure public confidence and confidence .
d@@ it@@ ta has lost this trust and tried to hide behind the fac@@ ade of his profes@@ sion .
the serious and organized crime unit of lan@@ cas@@ hire was the head of the investigation against d@@ it@@ ta , which also led to a convic@@ tion in three cases for the pos@@ session of co@@ ca@@ ine and dis@@ ability of justice .
this case should be a warning to crimin@@ als and show that no one can escape the arm of the law .
we find them and bring them to justice .
scar@@ bor@@ ough himself was sent@@ enced to 14 years in prison after he joined the con@@ spir@@ acy to kill her@@ o@@ in , co@@ ca@@ ine , and can@@ n@@ ab@@ is .
thir@@ ty-@@ five other &apos; people involved in the drug trade have been sent@@ enced to total sent@@ ences of 15@@ 3 years for drug off@@ ences .
d@@ it@@ ta published a section with questions and answers about himself , where he indicated his dream job was to be to be considered a law@@ yer client .
revolutionary work of church music
to conclude the celebra@@ tions of its 16@@ 0-@@ year existence , the li@@ e@@ der@@ k@@ ran@@ z dun@@ n@@ ingen will host two services of wor@@ ship with the &quot; deutsche mes@@ se &quot; by fran@@ z sch@@ u@@ bert .
after the great success of the musi@@ c@@ als &quot; rock my life &quot; , which the vie@@ wers will be delighted in spring this year , the song cr@@ ane will be closed at the end of the anniversary year two services with the performance of the german music .
on saturday 26 october , this extraordinary fair will take place from 19 at the evening fair in st. mar@@ tin@@ sk@@ ir@@ che dun@@ n@@ ingen and on sunday 27 october , from 10 : 15 a.m. at the div@@ ine service in the city of st. john .
the so-called german fair with the original title &quot; sing@@ ing for the celebr@@ ation of the holy sacrif@@ ice of the fair &quot; , d 8@@ 72 , is a spiritual music work by the compos@@ er fran@@ z sch@@ u@@ bert from 18@@ 26 and 18@@ 26 .
the fair is held in the framework of the services of god , as the client jo@@ han@@ n phili@@ p@@ p neu@@ mann intended .
under the leadership of her@@ mann sch@@ nei@@ der , the cho@@ ir is led by the br@@ ass band of the musi@@ k@@ vere@@ in fre@@ u@@ sin@@ n ten@@ n@@ en@@ br@@ on@@ n and no@@ em@@ i lo@@ ko@@ di at the or@@ gan .
has@@ l@@ ach – ske@@ p@@ tic@@ ism is increasingly di@@ min@@ ishing confidence , and confidence is sha@@ ping up .
the elections to the par@@ ish council in 20@@ 15 , for example , will bring a new dimension to the has@@ l@@ ach ( se ) se@@ af@@ aring unit .
there is only one common council of par@@ ish counc@@ ils for all six par@@ ishes .
at a joint meeting on saturday the h@@ ass@@ l@@ ach , ho@@ f@@ ste@@ t@@ ten , m@@ ü@@ h@@ len@@ bach , fis@@ cher@@ bach , ste@@ in@@ ach and wel@@ sch@@ en@@ ste@@ in@@ ach committees prepared for the changes .
the fact is that the fundamental decisions of the di@@ oc@@ ese are still un@@ changed and it is up to the local counc@@ ils to make them as satisfactory as possible .
during the day , it became particularly clear that the s@@ cep@@ tic@@ ism toward the new , re@@ luc@@ t@@ ant but increasingly confident , has been growing .
the ideas and expectations for the innovations in 20@@ 15 and the concrete proposals for the future composition and size of the par@@ ish council were the most constructive discussions of the six bodies with the main groups .
regional de@@ an geor@@ g sch@@ mit@@ t explained the re@@ defined guidelines for se@@ af@@ aring units in the arch@@ di@@ oc@@ ese by means of a presentation .
after that , se has@@ l@@ ach , as a par@@ ish of the church , will form a body of public law that is bound up with the rights and duties of the six individual church communities that have been established up to now .
there is only one common par@@ ish council and a board of tr@@ us@@ tees , in which the pri@@ est is appointed .
every par@@ ish should have at least two elected members , in the six par@@ ish churches , so called public and private groups .
in the future , it will be their task to promote the church &apos;s life in the area .
when it comes to the finances of the individual par@@ ish , there was a great need for discussion .
the innovations provide that accum@@ ulated credit will be stored in the par@@ ish r@@ ing-@@ f@@ enced .
li@@ abilities , on the other hand , go to the entire community .
it is precisely with regard to the major planned investments , the obligation of which all the par@@ ishes meet , that there were great concerns .
&quot; in the past , too , only investments were made in projects that were managed by the individual par@@ ish counc@@ ils , &quot; said has@@ l@@ ach@@ s par@@ ish church council president .
practical experience with a common board for five par@@ ishes dep@@ ic@@ ted bar@@ b@@ ar rit@@ ter , the chairman of the board of the se@@ af@@ aring unit of the sch@@ ut@@ ter@@ wal@@ d-@@ neu@@ ried lake district .
they had set themselves the task in 2006 of becoming one , staying five , and found that it was not so easy .
the bodies of the has@@ l@@ ach soul group then set to discuss the questions of the future composition and size of the common par@@ ish council and the practical work of the municip@@ al teams .
the work will be made more concrete in further meetings and will be discussed at another joint meeting of all six bodies next spring .
in the end , the par@@ ish council michael sch@@ ö@@ ner from ste@@ in@@ ach presented the new logo of the se@@ el@@ sor@@ g@@ unity , which was approved by a clear majority .
in p@@ ful@@ l@@ endor@@ f , the electricity is produced more expensive than the electricity generated by the city &apos;s electricity .
the citizens of p@@ f@@ ul@@ l@@ endor@@ f must be prepared for higher electricity costs .
as the managing director of the stad@@ tw@@ er@@ ke , j@@ ör@@ g-@@ ar@@ ne bi@@ as , confirmed to the south kur@@ i@@ er , a four-@@ head@@ ed p@@ fl@@ endor@@ fer family from 70 to 90 euros extra costs per year are added .
the main reason for the forthcoming price increase is the increase in the so-called ec lev@@ y of 5.@@ 27@@ 7 to 6.@@ 3 c@@ ents per kil@@ ow@@ att@@ -@@ hour .
this lev@@ y is calculated every year in october by the four operators of the major electricity routes .
these figures are the ones that will result from the change in energy , which will be covered by a lev@@ y on the electricity price .
the city works of p@@ f@@ ul@@ l@@ endor@@ f are the last link in this chain .
the supervisory board of the energy company was even convinced in its forec@@ asts of a higher lev@@ y , as j@@ ör@@ g-@@ ar@@ ne bi@@ as reported .
now the actual figures should be calculated before the town fac@@ tories inform their customers next week about the exact price increase .
&quot; we are expec@@ ting an increase of 1 cent plus x , &quot; says bi@@ as , with the number more close to the 2 cent .
light on permanent red : keep on waiting for the next time .
sometimes a light simply does not turn green .
the contact loo@@ p in the road does not respond , or the light sign is broken .
what should we do then - driving in red ?
has a person been affected by this long enough waiting at a red light and the inter@@ section is free , he can continue , the stutt@@ gart law@@ yer r@@ al@@ f bec@@ ker explains in the magazine &quot; motor@@ ra@@ d &quot; .
the waiting time must be &quot; reasonable &quot; , which v@@ aries from one case to the next .
bec@@ ker advis@@ es that at least five minutes should be left before the traffic lights get distur@@ bed .
if you want to continue the journey despite the red lights , you must be aware that you will be responsible for the full liability of an accident that has been caused .
those who toler@@ ate less than five minutes may not wait long enough , war@@ ns bec@@ ker and refers to a decision by the supreme court of ham@@ m .
in the case under discussion , a driver had the am@@ pl@@ it@@ ude of ign@@ oring the light after about three minutes and had to op@@ t for a neglig@@ ent red light violation .
the traffic lights were not def@@ ec@@ tive , but rather jum@@ ped to green shortly afterwards .
he was not allowed to drive because of the special situation - but the fine was not .
the council of ministers is delighted with the solid budget and the solid budget of the local counc@@ ill@@ or .
whenever there are community counc@@ ils dealing with the budget , may@@ or r@@ alp@@ h ger@@ ster lau@@ gh@@ s well .
the community bag in her@@ d@@ wan@@ gen@@ -@@ sch@@ ö@@ n@@ n@@ ach is well filled and the administration has not known the administration since 2005 .
the 2012 financial year can also be considered a complete success in this respect .
this was confirmed when the annual accounts were presented for 2012 .
as andre@@ a ro@@ th@@ mun@@ d explained , the administrative budget was set at around eur 7.@@ 6 million , above a million .
the administrative budget sur@@ plus would also be around eur 1.@@ 8 million , which would be around eur 1 million above the approach .
the sur@@ plus is mainly due to higher business tax revenue and the community &apos;s share of income tax .
the asset budget was also well above the planned values .
instead of the eur 1.5 million envis@@ aged , it was eur 2.5 million last year .
&quot; this is mainly due to the higher allocation from the administrative budget , &quot; says ro@@ th@@ mun@@ d .
since there was less investment than planned in 2012 , the commission &apos;s re@@ tention rate is also higher .
overall , the overall reserve was reduced by around eur 2.@@ 1 million to a total of eur 4.@@ 9 million .
may@@ or r@@ alp@@ h ger@@ ster than@@ ked ro@@ th@@ mun@@ d and her team for their good work .
&quot; this is not just a work that you sha@@ ke out of your sle@@ eve , &quot; ger@@ ster p@@ raised with a view to the annual accounts .
he and the local counc@@ ils were obviously pleased with the good figures .
it may sound par@@ ado@@ x@@ ical , but it is these very good figures that could soon cost the citizens dear .
due to the good financial situation , the community has been able to avoid high levels of le@@ verage in the past .
this , in turn , has been said by ger@@ ster to have cut subsidies from the country on many occasions .
the commission has proposed a new approach to this aid from various compens@@ atory stic@@ ks .
the towns and communities that receive subsidies must , among other things , be able to show certain levels of le@@ verage .
&quot; the issue of ho@@ ists must be looked at , because there are investments to be made in the coming years , for which we would like to have subsidies , &quot; ger@@ ster announced in this context .
n@@ ag@@ old : hu@@ go wer@@ m@@ ter has been in the ch@@ oral for 60 years in hu@@ go wer@@ m@@ ter for 60 years .
with 60 years as a sing@@ er , hu@@ bert wer@@ m@@ ter ’ s story is with the men ’ s sing@@ ing association c@@ ac@@ ili@@ a almost twice as long as that of the her@@ b@@ s@@ fe@@ ste , in which he was hon@@ oured .
hu@@ bert wer@@ m@@ ter stood in the colours of his male sing@@ er ’ s band as usual .
after 60 years , he is still able to sing with the now probably well-@@ won ch@@ or@@ us .
wer@@ m@@ ter was also active in the association , including for 28 years as a member of the committee .
he received a very good hon@@ or for his commitment and his loy@@ alty : j@@ ör@@ g ko@@ hr , pa@@ stor@@ al re@@ fe@@ ree on behalf of the c@@ ä@@ c@@ ili@@ en@@ ver@@ band rot@@ ten@@ bur@@ g-@@ stutt@@ gart , who presented him .
his sing@@ er colleagues handed him the german ch@@ oral band &apos;s certificate and a gra@@ vi@@ ated z@@ in@@ n@@ tell@@ er .
in addition to the award , the 3@@ 1st autumn festival was held in the usual tra@@ in@@ ings : with m@@ g@@ v be@@ tra , the li@@ e@@ der@@ k@@ ran@@ z salz@@ ste@@ t@@ ten , the sing@@ er department ba@@ is@@ ingen and the local music association .
the m@@ g@@ v vol@@ l@@ mar@@ ingen opened with atmo@@ sp@@ her@@ ic songs like &quot; im we@@ in@@ par@@ a@@ dies &quot; and &quot; fun@@ ny , her bro@@ thers &quot; .
in the last few years , the band has been a member of the international association of the german association for the promotion of the german social democratic republic ( b@@ mb@@ f ) .
the men &apos;s sing@@ ing association be@@ tra san@@ g also classical ch@@ oral songs like &quot; hun@@ ters &quot; by ju@@ li@@ us w@@ eng@@ ert , &quot; far , far away &quot; by hu@@ bert go@@ is@@ er@@ n and the fol@@ k song &quot; .
the li@@ e@@ der@@ k@@ ran@@ z salz@@ ste@@ t@@ ten , with its mixed cho@@ ir and its women &apos;s group - the &quot; imp@@ ul@@ se &quot; - provided the women &apos;s quota for the festival .
the mixed cho@@ ir ab@@ duc@@ ted with the ne@@ apo@@ lit@@ an fol@@ k song &quot; santa lu@@ cia &quot; and &quot; evi@@ va esp@@ ana &quot; by an@@ tos g@@ us to foreign lands , while the &quot; imp@@ ul@@ se &quot; also ab@@ duc@@ ted foreign languages .

the children were given a small programme - &quot; om@@ a h@@ anne &quot; ali@@ as h@@ ann@@ el@@ ore st@@ ol@@ l@@ ste@@ im@@ er performed a kas@@ per@@ l theatre and read some stories that the children had about well employed at lunch .

ken@@ y@@ an press ou@@ tr@@ aged at controversial media law
“ we are in a da@@ un@@ ting situation and one may ask : what does parliament think of simply dis@@ regarding the judicial independence tomorrow ?
“ the law is dr@@ ac@@ on@@ ian and very pun@@ ish@@ able and we reject it , ” cy@@ r@@ us kam@@ au , managing director of the capital group , who also includes cap@@ ital@@ f@@ m , said one of the most respected independent radio stations .
he said that the new media tri@@ bun@@ al “ will always be bi@@ ased , because it is an extended arm of the government , ” and restrictions on content and advertising would be ken@@ ya ’ s position in the global economy .
“ i hope the president will listen to us and we appeal to him to reject this bill and to return it to parliament , ” he said .
according to the star newspaper , the government is taking the new law “ effectively the media into a str@@ ang@@ le@@ hold ” , while the standard , democracy , and freedom of speech in ken@@ ya would have suffered “ a heavy b@@ low , ” and be@@ ti@@ tel@@ te .
the adoption of the law is one of a series of measures which will improve national security following the attacks by armed islam@@ ists on the west gas market .
the ken@@ y@@ an media have been attrac@@ ting the authorities ’ an@@ ger because they have published photographs of security cameras showing how the people involved in the crime were being shot .
david k@@ im@@ ai@@ y@@ o , the chief of the police , respon@@ ded by appoin@@ ting two journalists and a leading media representative , even though the sub@@ po@@ ena was a result of a media out@@ cr@@ y .
under the new law , media houses can be pun@@ ished with a penalty of up to 20 million ken@@ y@@ an sch@@ ill@@ ings and individual journalists with up to one million and the further risk of losing their professional recognition or being excluded from official press access .
the tri@@ bun@@ al also has the right to se@@ ize the pos@@ session of those affected if a penalty is not paid .
according to daily nation , “ even one single pun@@ ishment can bank@@ ru@@ pt most radio stations . ”
furthermore , the newspaper believes that these measures could have a dev@@ ast@@ ating effect on the “ lively blo@@ go@@ sphere ” of ken@@ ya , as you describe it .
if you silence the media , politicians could go un@@ pun@@ ished , whatever they want .
“ no one will ever know , ” mu@@ t@@ um@@ a ma@@ thi@@ u , journ@@ alist at the nation that has been using the ken@@ y@@ an media as a decisive factor in public control .
“ leaving politicians to their own devices , let them bank@@ ru@@ pt the country and let us return to the time of hun@@ ters and collec@@ tors , ” he comm@@ ented .
ken@@ y@@ an legisl@@ ators have been running the public trouble in the past .
in may , they voted to reduce the amount of compensation ordered by the national compensation commission .
bad@@ -@@ d@@ ür@@ r@@ heim : a dream comes true for the f@@ c .
the importance of the city and the football club was dis@@ missed as official opening cere@@ mony for the artificial tur@@ f sports field despite the cold weather and the rain .
the hotel was very clean and the staff were very helpful .
so all those who had lost their sight without um@@ bre@@ lla or who had not kept one for any reason .
this was done to the musicians who fr@@ amed the cere@@ mony , as well as to many speakers .

further gre@@ e@@ ting words were addressed to the municip@@ al sports committee hu@@ bert ba@@ i@@ er , district chairman of the south ba@@ dian football association , kun@@ o k@@ ay@@ an , and fried@@ rich k@@ nor@@ r from the planning office of the city of berlin .
may@@ or k@@ lu@@ mp@@ p remin@@ ded us that rec@@ ur@@ ring weather related influ@@ ences in spring and autumn are due to the original la@@ wn in such a way that it could not be played .
the first refl@@ ec@@ tions on how to solve the problem were already 15 years ago , when construction of a third place at the football club or at the real school on the sal@@ in@@ en@@ see .
both were rejected again .
six years ago , thoughts were raised about the creation of an artificial tur@@ f sports ground , which was generally regarded as the ultimate solution .
concrete plans were launched two years ago when the f@@ c opened the sch@@ ab@@ el@@ stu@@ be in er@@ b@@ ach@@ t , a cost share of eur 100 000 for the construction of the site and the country was receiving eur 10@@ 4 000 .
the local council decided in october 2012 to take over the remaining 3@@ 56 000 euros from the total cost of 5@@ 60 000 euros , kl@@ um@@ p@@ p summar@@ ised .
the construction of the 68 x 10@@ 8 m artificial tur@@ f was started on june 4 .
during the construction phase lasting more than three months , 3@@ 000 cu@@ b@@ ic metres of earth were carried away , half of which was used for the creation of a dir@@ t bike route .

the issue of transport , which is not on the agenda for this friday , was under@@ pin@@ ned by the sp@@ d in its rejection of a c@@ su call for tol@@ l on cars .

there were risks of ev@@ a@@ sive traffic on rural roads , which were already the main areas of accident .

airport vienna creates passenger calls from customers
mr max ma@@ i@@ er , please come to gate 24 .
break@@ through@@ s like this will be impossible at wi@@ en-@@ sch@@ w@@ ec@@ hat airport in the future .
most of the speakers are lost - the noise level is to be reduced so much that it is possible to do so .
creating a more relaxed atmosphere is the goal of this innovation .
as peter kle@@ em@@ ann ’ s air@@ port@@ -@@ spo@@ kes@@ man announced to radio vienna , vienna airport follows the course of the recru@@ it@@ ment of announ@@ c@@ ements concerning individuals , an international trend .
for example , the airports in copenhagen , frankfurt or du@@ ba@@ i are already ref@@ using to make the nois@@ y calls .
by elimin@@ ating these a@@ ver@@ ages - on average , around 200 personal calls from the lou@@ d@@ speakers a day - there will be more quiet at the airport in the future .
&quot; it has also been shown in experience that these individual announ@@ c@@ ements have been per@@ ceived relatively little , but at the same time all other information on changed flight and departure times has been somewhat lost here , &quot; says kle@@ em@@ ann in the interview .
high@@ lan@@ der games on the kal@@ ten@@ hof

on saturday , september 7@@ th , the high@@ lan@@ der games will start at 1.@@ 30 p.m.
they have a scot@@ tish tradition , but they are sch@@ w@@ ä@@ bis@@ ch on the kal@@ ten@@ hof .
teams and individual figh@@ ters are measured in the discipl@@ ines of tre@@ e-@@ tr@@ un@@ king , hor@@ se@@ -@@ sho@@ oting and wat@@ er-@@ bu@@ cket we@@ aring .
four and a half metres long , the tr@@ un@@ k is 25 to 30 kil@@ o@@ gram@@ s heavy .
&quot; it does not matter how big , &quot; explains organiz@@ er peter sa@@ ile .
the tri@@ be must be dis@@ car@@ ded ver@@ tically , be@@ aten for once and then simply st@@ uck .
most of the points are in favour of this .
the sho@@ oting of the c@@ ats depends on the accuracy of the target .
eight metres away , the p@@ ound is thro@@ wn .
sk@@ ill and strength must be shown to the participants in the water@@ bu@@ cket carrying over 50 meters .
time and water quantity in a bot@@ tle are measured at the end .
from each cl@@ an or team , two players can participate in the single contest .
the winners of the team and single competition will be awarded pri@@ zes .
you can start your training from 10 a.m.
the desired clothes are suitable , for example , the competitors in the sch@@ ot@@ ten@@ rock can take part .
but sw@@ ab@@ ian cost@@ umes are also allowed .

milk and eg@@ g alternatives in overview
ve@@ gan nutri@@ tion requires vege@@ table alternatives to e@@ gg@@ s , milk and d@@ airy products .
pur@@ i@@ fied to@@ f@@ u with vege@@ table cre@@ am is , for example , a quar@@ ker set .
the vege@@ t@@ arian in@@ herit@@ ance is also mentioned as world ve@@ gan day on november 1 .
the vege@@ t@@ arian in@@ herit@@ ance germany proposes a new version of the vege@@ t@@ arian tree of the world ve@@ gan on november 1 :
pure plant mar@@ gar@@ ine is a good alternative to but@@ ter , yo@@ gh@@ ur@@ t las@@ se through so@@ y@@ a@@ yo@@ gh@@ ur@@ t substitu@@ te .
instead of milk , so@@ ya , o@@ ats , al@@ mon@@ ds or rice milk could be used .
fl@@ ora ’ s cre@@ am is replaced by traditional bu@@ ck@@ le cre@@ am .
there are also vege@@ table alternatives to e@@ gg@@ s .
half crus@@ hed , mature ban@@ ana , for example , can use an eg@@ g as a binding agent in a ca@@ ke .
also 50 gram@@ s of apple or a tab@@ les@@ po@@ on of le@@ in@@ see@@ ds plus three tab@@ les@@ po@@ ons of water are suitable for this .
the pa@@ stry is loo@@ sen@@ ed instead of using eg@@ g with a mix@@ ture of a te@@ as@@ po@@ on of ba@@ king pow@@ der , a tab@@ les@@ po@@ on of star@@ ch and three tab@@ les@@ po@@ ons of min@@ eral water .
but also 50 gram@@ s of so@@ ya yo@@ gh@@ ur@@ t or sil@@ k to@@ f@@ u can fulfil this purpose .
according to ve@@ b@@ u , around 800 000 people in germany currently eat ve@@ gan , i.e. pure vege@@ table .
sle@@ e@@ pl@@ ess in new york
on the way to your host families in we@@ y@@ mouth , mass@@ ach@@ us@@ et@@ ts , the students of the black forest school learned the american grand city of new york .
after eight hours of flight , the bro@@ ok@@ ly@@ n bridge was just off the road , which was a walk to the heart of the city , man@@ h@@ att@@ an .
here a fascinating view of the world famous sky@@ line , which was built in the evening light , gave a special charm .
the time shift meant that students were on their feet for almost 24 hours , but fa@@ i@@ th@@ fully , the mo@@ tto &quot; the city does not sleep &quot; was decided on the day at times square .
despite shut@@ down , the liber@@ ty stat@@ ue was re@@ built on the second day with a fer@@ ry and was kno@@ c@@ ked down on foot .
the financial centre was then on wall street as the mem@@ orial of september 11 .
on the third day , the students were able to take part in the observation platform of the emp@@ ire@@ -@@ state building , which is located 3@@ 73 metres high , and gain an overview of the fascinating city while enjoying the view .
after that , the hec@@ tic pace of new york streets over ro@@ c@@ ke@@ f@@ ell@@ er center went to central park , which is an ideal opportunity to spend a short time in the autumn sun .
after a short flight from new york to bo@@ ston , students have now arrived in their host families and experience the we@@ y@@ mouth high school .
this year , the name of the holy hu@@ ber@@ tus is celebrated in the par@@ ish church of st. mari@@ en at h@@ ul@@ s@@ ber@@ g@@ stra@@ ß@@ e , a hu@@ ber@@ tus fair .
st. hu@@ ber@@ tus was a rather ru@@ th@@ less hun@@ ter , who was driven by a vision and later turned to the bis@@ hop of li@@ è@@ ge .
the hun@@ ting hor@@ n group of the western fal@@ con hun@@ ting tri@@ bes , led by bri@@ g@@ it@@ te k@@ lu@@ th , is performing on par@@ for@@ ce@@ hor@@ ns ( nature hor@@ ns in the mo@@ od ) according to old , originally french me@@ lo@@ dies .
the bre@@ asts wear riding clothes because they are mainly ri@@ ders , horses and dog owners on bad conditions .
the f@@ es@@ tive fair takes place on sunday , november 3 , at 11.@@ 30 a.m.
the newly designed op@@ tion-@@ sha@@ ke sh@@ ines with a new caf@@ e .
one that allows you to stay and return .
one that wants to make the name of the program .
dé@@ j@@ à v@@ u is a psycho@@ logical term , according to the dic@@ tionary , which is expressed in the feeling of having a new situation before or having seen .
in the case of visiting the café of the same name at the op@@ sch@@ la@@ g in the district town of kle@@ ve , within sight of the university of r@@ hin@@ e-@@ wa@@ al , it does not have to remain a pure dé@@ j@@ à v@@ u feeling .
finally , the café with its beautiful name has the very aim of making a real stay not only ment@@ ally but also hand@@ -@@ cra@@ fted , always enjoy@@ able .
because it &apos;s fun and simply beautiful .
a look at the inner life at op@@ sch@@ la@@ g 8 gives the vie@@ wer a good feeling at first hand .
the ul@@ tra-@@ modern , but not cool , caf@@ é@@ -@@ ambi@@ ence looks like a place to feel at ease .
here the team p@@ amp@@ ers the foun@@ ders mir@@ j@@ am van der st@@ el@@ t and dani@@ el b@@ ü@@ tt@@ ner at the top with various coff@@ e@@ e-@@ and cock@@ tail vari@@ eties .
the restaurant offers delicious ca@@ kes or individually prepared fresh bag@@ u@@ et@@ tes .
the owner , both 33 years old , has already registered for the opening of the lovely café at the op@@ sch@@ la@@ g as a gastronom@@ ic speci@@ al@@ ty@@ . in k@@ ran@@ enburg they conducted the &quot; art lounge &quot; .
from the move to kle@@ ve to the op@@ sch@@ la@@ g , the friendly ca@@ fe@@ -@@ lovers are ho@@ ping for more audience .
not least by the university .
&quot; we don &apos;t have a specific target group &quot; , dani@@ el b@@ ü@@ tt@@ ner emphasi@@ zes .
the two students here would rather like to address the issue of the elderly and the elderly .
speaking of ca@@ fe@@ -@@ lovers .
the friendly owner couple is behind the coffee enjoy@@ ment .

dani@@ el b@@ ü@@ tt@@ ner is more the expres@@ so fan and mir@@ j@@ am van der st@@ el@@ t the cap@@ pu@@ c@@ c@@ ino drin@@ ker .
&quot; a bag@@ u@@ ette is my thing , &quot; she tells the n@@ r@@ z .
two events have already been held in the bright café .
better , one .
the port festival was held outside , and café dé@@ j@@ à v@@ u did not benefit from it .
but there was also the r@@ ing@@ el@@ nat@@ z@@ evening .
&quot; beautiful , successful and fun@@ ny &quot; , the two 3@@ 3-@@ year-@@ ol@@ ds found .
but not everyone &apos;s business .
perhaps dani@@ el b@@ ü@@ tt@@ ner is not a fan of event@@ -@@ even@@ ings either : &quot; you can &apos;t be alone !
and with an event i always talk to those who are also interested in the special event .
that is why events will be the exception .
&quot; we want to dis@@ ru@@ pt normal operation as little as possible &quot; .
should it be : dé@@ j@@ à v@@ u also stands for reliability .
in terms of the quality of the products offered here , as well as the team and the beautiful surroundings at the op@@ sch@@ la@@ g in kle@@ ve .
the road , which is becoming more and more a gastronom@@ ic m@@ ile .
to the deli@@ ght of many kle@@ vers , guests from near and far and students who want to visit the ga@@ stro@@ m@@ ile and thus the café dé@@ j@@ à v@@ u for themselves .

it was the 16@@ 5th anniversary of the foundation of the m@@ g@@ v &quot; fried@@ rich wil@@ hel@@ m din@@ ker &quot; , which was attended by 52 guests , active sing@@ ers and their wi@@ ves , who were happy to come .
in the club restaurant wit@@ te@@ bor@@ g in din@@ ker gen@@ os@@ sen all the harmon@@ ious co@@ existence was born in the name of music .
tradi@@ tionally , the foundation festival is always the right festival to hon@@ or .
about the special award &quot; sing@@ er of the year &quot; was the occasion for the re@@ mem@@ br@@ ance of writer ro@@ l@@ f wag@@ en@@ er .
&quot; you have not only written much for us , but you have also turned some la@@ ps for us , for which our hear@@ t@@ felt thanks &quot; , says the ch@@ or@@ us er@@ ich sch@@ lo@@ t@@ mann .
the awards for participation in the performances and cho@@ ir re@@ hear@@ s@@ als by means of activity sho@@ ots were presented this year to the ch@@ oral director di@@ e@@ ter schul@@ ze with 44 particip@@ ations , followed by the hon@@ or@@ ary chairman hor@@ st pi@@ er-@@ b@@ .

un announ@@ ces new goals in poverty reduction .
the united nations is now starting to work out a series of new objectives to meet the millennium development goals announced 12 years ago in order to combat poverty .
in the run@@ -up to the un summit on sustainable development , which began in rio de jan@@ e@@ iro in the evening , austr@@ ali@@ an diplom@@ ats played a key role in pus@@ hing for “ sustainable development goals ” that will bring about the 20@@ 15 millennium development goals .
they were included in the final draft of the document drawn up by world leaders , including mrs g@@ ill@@ ard , at the summit .
un secre@@ tar@@ y-@@ general ban ki@@ -@@ moon said at the summit last night that the time was right to think ‘ about national interests ’ .
“ i am pleased that the member states have agreed to initi@@ ate a process that will enable universal access to sustainable development goals .
“ these goals are based on our progress from the millennium development goals and will form an integral part of the framework for development after 20@@ 15 .
i will spare no effort to support this proposal , which has been given to me by the member states , in order to achieve our vision of sustainable development objectives , which is based on the success of the millennium goals . ”
even though the s@@ g achi@@ m / ba@@ den has been without victory for four days , the hand@@ ball ob@@ er@@ lig@@ ist continues to be in good mo@@ od .
this is where tra@@ iner tom@@ as@@ z mal@@ mon leaves no doubt .
all are still fully motivated .
i hope , however , that we will finally win again .
&quot; for i don &apos;t know how a victory tas@@ tes any@@ more , &quot; mal@@ mon exp@@ ects a success story from his team .
even if the third league reserve from fre@@ den@@ bec@@ k is not yet a tree , the third league reserve , in the run@@ -up to the event , al@@ er@@ ts mal@@ mon .
many players i have trained myself in the a-@@ youth .
they will therefore be able to be particularly motivated against their ex@@ -@@ co@@ ach .
&quot; it is also important to see whether rein@@ for@@ cement from the first one is available , &quot; the s@@ g-@@ co@@ ach clearly states .
to finally return to the track of success , the mal@@ mon team must be more than happy with the previous performances .
in the areas of coverage and the ha@@ per@@ te shift , in particular , it has been a huge hit .
the exploitation of opportunities must definitely also improve .
i hope that my players will finally get their heads free during the short break .
security concerns in moz@@ ambi@@ que are growing in the face of cl@@ ash@@ es between influ@@ ential person@@ alities and politicians .
thousands of people gathered in the center of ma@@ pu@@ to under the wat@@ ch@@ ful eyes of the stat@@ ue of sam@@ ora mach@@ el , the founder of the state and first president of moz@@ ambi@@ que to attend a rare public demonstration calling for peace .
“ we want peace again , we want stability , ” van@@ ess@@ a de s@@ ous@@ a , managing director of an investment company , said .
for fear of the country ’ s future , it has ti@@ ed its business clothes against a t-@@ shir@@ t with the in@@ scri@@ ption “ we demand security ” in portuguese and on thursday it was on the independence square of the capital .
for two weeks , there have been reports almost daily of cl@@ ash@@ es between government forces and ren@@ am@@ o , which have led to the worst batt@@ les since the peace agreement over 20 years ago .
ren@@ am@@ o was once a not@@ ori@@ ous re@@ bel movement , initially supported by white rul@@ ed r@@ ho@@ desi@@ a and later by apar@@ the@@ id government in south africa .
after the 1992 peace treaty , it became an opposition party .
analy@@ sts find it unlikely that the country will return to a full-@@ scale conflict , but recent events have left foreign investors and domestic concerns un@@ easy .
the fa@@ st-@@ growing economy is at stake , because disco@@ vering huge gas depos@@ its off the coast and coal mines in the north-@@ west could be a major investment in over 50 billion us dollars of companies like rio tin@@ to .
the ruling fre@@ lim@@ o party , which has been the dominant force since 197@@ 5 , and ren@@ am@@ o bl@@ ames each other for the ten@@ sions .
ren@@ am@@ o claims that the government has pro@@ vo@@ ked recent cl@@ ash@@ es by inv@@ iting its members to the province of so@@ fal@@ a , a traditional ren@@ am@@ os strong@@ hold on 17 october .
the attacks on the former re@@ be@@ ls es@@ cal@@ ated when government troops ren@@ am@@ o bases att@@ acked attacks on and tried to stop af@@ on@@ so d@@ har@@ ma .
the government is bl@@ aming ren@@ am@@ o for the cl@@ ash@@ es and acc@@ uses the organization of having att@@ acked soldiers .
president ar@@ man@@ do gu@@ e@@ bu@@ za has tried to play down concerns about inst@@ ability .
the french news agency , af@@ p , said that on wednesday , dh@@ la@@ k@@ ama would prove to be a “ lo@@ ser , ” the “ all its remaining ones ” .
fre@@ lim@@ o and ren@@ am@@ o both empha@@ size that they want to avoid war .
but concerns have increased since ma@@ z@@ ang@@ a quo@@ ted the words ren@@ am@@ o gave the peace agreement of 1992 to the letter .
he said to the ft that he meant that fre@@ lim@@ o would no longer respect the agreement .
“ our vision is to re@@ open negotiations and to start serious negotiations , ” said ma@@ z@@ ang@@ a .
earlier talks between the parties have done little to resolve the ten@@ sions caused by a series of cl@@ ash@@ es this year .
“ we have two adults men here ( gu@@ e@@ bu@@ za and dh@@ la@@ k@@ ama ) who have the heads cl@@ ash@@ ing , ” says joseph han@@ l@@ on , lec@@ ture@@ r at the open university and moz@@ ambi@@ que .
none of them is well negotiated , and none is prepared to make the necessary conc@@ essions .
ren@@ am@@ o , who pus@@ hed for electoral reform , has already declared that she will bo@@ y@@ cot@@ t the november local elections .
presidential and parliamentary elections are scheduled for next year .
some comm@@ ent@@ ators have described the use of force as an attempt by a ail@@ ing movement to seek conc@@ essions and financial benefits from the government .
ren@@ am@@ o ’ s election succ@@ esses have been shr@@ in@@ king since 1992 , while a ne@@ wer party , founded by a former ren@@ am@@ o member , is the mo@@ ç@@ ambi@@ que mo@@ ç@@ ambi@@ que ( m@@ d@@ m ) party , pre@@ sum@@ ably .
ma@@ z@@ ang@@ a claims that gu@@ e@@ bu@@ za – whose re@@ sign@@ ation is due when his second term ends next year – is destro@@ ying the country ’ s democracy .
“ he does not want multi-@@ party democracy , he does not want transparent elections , he does not want peace because he does not want to give up the presidency , ” says ma@@ z@@ ang@@ a .
it is un@@ clear what capacity ren@@ am@@ o has , but it has caused un@@ rest attacks on police stations and vehicles on an important north-@@ south link .
most of the batt@@ les took place in the province of so@@ fal@@ a , which is a few hundred kilometers north of ma@@ pu@@ to , but in which be@@ ira is located , the port , the mining companies such as rio t@@ into and v@@ v@@ v@@ v .
in june , rio inter@@ rup@@ ted the use of the railway for a month after ren@@ am@@ o announced an attack on the line .
ma@@ z@@ ang@@ a respon@@ ded cau@@ ti@@ ously to the question of whether ren@@ am@@ o would repeat this threat .
ren@@ am@@ o wanted to “ war@@ n the international community that things are not going well in moz@@ ambi@@ que , ” said ma@@ z@@ ang@@ a .
inst@@ ability has tri@@ g@@ ge@@ red fru@@ stration with the government , says fer@@ nan@@ do li@@ ma , head of medi@@ ac@@ o@@ op , an independent media company , because many people were already concerned about corruption , the slow pace of change .
“ people think that the government and the president are responsible for the country ’ s future , and he should be the one who finds solutions to the problems , ” he explains .
om@@ ar sul@@ tan@@ e , a demonstr@@ ator , said that people simply wanted stability .
&quot; ren@@ am@@ o and fre@@ li@@ mo are not interested , they just want peace and us@@ able roads , &quot; he explained .
children should call my@@ ths and leg@@ ends “ a role model for life , ” an author says .
the stories of th@@ or showed that “ brut@@ al force has no chance against cle@@ ver tr@@ ic@@ ks , ” and the ar@@ tus leg@@ end demonstrates how important it is to build a dream .
many my@@ ths , however , are “ far too wild , too off@@ ensive , and , in some cases , too dir@@ ty to be taught in schools . ”
“ i find it wonderful that in america my@@ ths and fol@@ kl@@ ore are already part of education , ” he said .
i have been proposing this as a plan for twenty years .
he added that there is a lot of interest among authors and teachers who are “ exc@@ es@@ sively di@@ d@@ ac@@ tic , ” because in enter@@ taining stories , children would “ turn off ” .
cros@@ s@@ ley hol@@ land , the be@@ ow@@ ul@@ f from ang@@ lo@@ -@@ sa@@ x@@ on , and author of the pen@@ gu@@ in book of nor@@ se my@@ ths and the british fol@@ k tal@@ es , explained : “ you can ’ t be wrong .
perhaps the greatest difference between an adult author who wri@@ tes for adults and an author who wri@@ tes for children is the need to create hope .
not everything needs to be simplified or lead to happy ending , but there is an im@@ man@@ ent sense of good and evil .
this must be under@@ lined , history must be revealed , and not explained .
this is the old story of showing instead of telling .
han@@ s@@ j@@ ak@@ o@@ b is re@@ visiting fre@@ i@@ hof again , but han@@ s@@ j@@ ak@@ o@@ b is re@@ visiting fre@@ i@@ hof .
100 years ago , he@@ in@@ rich han@@ s@@ j@@ ak@@ o@@ b established his reti@@ rement home in has@@ l@@ ach , and on sunday his last years were living in the &quot; fre@@ i@@ hof &quot; .
the many spec@@ t@@ ators were impres@@ sed by the extremely circu@@ lar scene game .
from arrival to the award of hon@@ or@@ ary citizenship to his death , script writer and han@@ s@@ jac@@ ob@@ s actor alo@@ is kra@@ f@@ tz@@ cy@@ k had an enter@@ taining piece designed to make it a reality under the direction of eli@@ a .
mar@@ c@@ us z@@ ag@@ er@@ mann took the audience as a speaker with through the ten different scenes , explained connections and brid@@ ged time jum@@ ps from the youth to the appro@@ aching reti@@ rement .
on october 22 , 19@@ 13 , han@@ s@@ j@@ ak@@ o@@ b heim entered his child@@ hood ’ s sk@@ ies , in his open-@@ air cour@@ ty@@ ard .
and then began the scene game in which alo@@ is kra@@ f@@ cz@@ y@@ k once again appeared in his par@@ ad@@ er@@ ol@@ le as the great son of the city .
he continued with the two sha@@ per and &quot; black forest fo@@ xes &quot; by er@@ ich bec@@ he@@ rer , m@@ ü@@ h@@ len@@ bach .
it was not only received with much applause by the audience , but also by his si@@ ster phili@@ pp@@ ine , he was welcome .
bil@@ ly sum her@@ mann understood it incredi@@ bly well to become involved in the role of the si@@ ster and gave her a lot of experience in m@@ im@@ ics and ge@@ st@@ ures .
between the scenes the m@@ ill of the pe@@ as@@ ant cha@@ pel played selected music pieces and roun@@ ded off the performance .
there was then a new party called the may@@ or he@@ in@@ z win@@ k@@ ler to give the honour of the hon@@ or@@ ary citizen , who was the representative of the then inc@@ um@@ b@@ ent h@@ ä@@ t@@ ti@@ ch , together with a part of the city council .
their appearance made the tri@@ -@@ king sing@@ ers , the han@@ s@@ jac@@ o@@ b led to the call : &quot; o@@ h how beautiful , there are again youth mem@@ ories of my own tri@@ -@@ king period alive &quot; .
with her song &quot; o jes@@ u@@ le@@ in &quot; they enjoyed the audience in the fre@@ i@@ hof as well as the stor@@ ch@@ ent@@ ag@@ sk@@ in@@ der with their l@@ oud &quot; out , out &quot; .
his criticism of the church was as much expressed by han@@ s@@ jac@@ o@@ b as his concerns about the exc@@ esses of agriculture , the consequences of industri@@ alisation or the effects of war .
in the home , behind its tom@@ b cha@@ pel on fire near ho@@ f@@ ste@@ t@@ ten , he found his re@@ sting place .
&quot; a re@@ st@@ less spirit had finally found its peace and had gone home fore@@ ver , &quot; it was said at the end of the scene .
much applause and many pra@@ ises were given by the audience for the performance .

after the film there is coffee , tea and ca@@ kes .
the first of these is the &quot; new &quot; , the &quot; new &quot; , &quot; new york city &quot; , which is the capital of the united states .
r@@ hen@@ us mid@@ g@@ ard has also invested heavily on land .
they distribute the coal coming from the ships to the hal@@ ves .
the company has already built several iron in the fire at the site .
in addition to coal imports , r@@ hen@@ us mid@@ g@@ ard also reli@@ es on wind farm logistics .
black sh@@ imm@@ ers the coal on the storage area in front of the dam .
two huge blue col@@ lar and re@@ char@@ ge@@ able devices distribute or load the coal here to the customer as required .
every time trans@@ shi@@ pment equipment is moved , a sh@@ iny warning sounds over the ter@@ rain .
&quot; the signals serve for safety and are legally prescri@@ bed , &quot; says mat@@ thi@@ as sch@@ re@@ ll , ceo of r@@ hen@@ us mid@@ g@@ ard in wil@@ hel@@ m@@ sha@@ ven .
in the event of un@@ favourable win@@ ds , this is unfortunately widely heard - and so there have already been some complaints from people from the north of the city .
he takes the complaints very seriously and has therefore cont@@ acted the people affected , says the 40 year-@@ old .
in close consultation with the authorities , we are now in the process of sof@@ ten@@ ing the warning signals with technical measures .
he will continue to press for open dialogue with his neighbours .
mat@@ thi@@ as sch@@ re@@ ll has some things to do at the site .
the extension of the lower sa@@ x@@ ony bridge continues to be the focus of r@@ hen@@ us mid@@ g@@ ard &apos;s efforts to import coal for power plants and is one of the largest in europe in this sector .
thanks to the 18@@ .@@ 5 meter deep@@ ening tan@@ k in front of the terminal , ca@@ pe@@ size bul@@ k carri@@ ers can be processed here for a long time .
&quot; this year we want to win the 3 million ton mark in the en@@ velo@@ pe , &quot; sch@@ re@@ ll said .
in addition to the on-@@ site e@@ on power plant , the import coal is going to power plants in the in@@ land country .
if the g@@ d@@ f-@@ su@@ e@@ z power station is to be put on the gri@@ d , there will be a good 5 million tonnes of coal imports per year .
the three ship lo@@ ad@@ ers on the bridge and the second conve@@ y@@ or bel@@ t could create up to 10 million .

ben green@@ man : ten years new york com@@ edy festival : the new york com@@ edy festival : the new york city : the new york city .
one might say that new york city is the birth@@ place of stand@@ -up com@@ edy in america : just under a hundred years ago , the vari@@ e@@ te@@ artist frank f@@ ay , who was known as conf@@ é@@ ren@@ ci@@ er in the american palace .
over the years , f@@ ays innovation has been developed , as was most recently the new york com@@ edy festival .
created and directed by car@@ ol@@ ine h@@ ir@@ sch , the founder of the stand@@ -up institution car@@ ol@@ ines , celebra@@ tes the festival this year its 10@@ th anniversary .
“ most of these head@@ lin@@ ers began with car@@ ol@@ ines and became more and more successful until they became known at some point in order to appear in a club , ” h@@ ir@@ sch said .
we have designed this festival so that we can continue working with you .
at this year &apos;s event , w@@ anda sy@@ kes , k@@ ath@@ y gri@@ ff@@ in and bill ma@@ her will perform as well as stand up for her@@ oes , an annual music and com@@ edy festival .
the festival also marks the beginning of the world of com@@ edy .
a number of com@@ edi@@ ans who will be participating in the festival this year are familiar with the more un@@ conventional ways of broad@@ casting , for example on smaller television channels such as com@@ edy central , f@@ x and spi@@ ke .
n@@ ick k@@ roll was awarded a sit@@ com on cable television ( the ir@@ on@@ ic@@ -@@ sli@@ p@@ per@@ y fant@@ as@@ y football series &quot; the league &quot; on f@@ x@@ x ) and has now developed its own ske@@ tch show .
jen@@ ny s@@ late was present at “ saturday night live ” as well as at “ parks and recre@@ ation ” , although she was the most famous for her vir@@ al video series “ mar@@ cel the shell with shot ” .
both k@@ roll and s@@ late and other young com@@ edi@@ ans with characteristic vo@@ ices ( the sur@@ real pes@@ si@@ mis@@ tic an@@ th@@ ony jes@@ el@@ nik , the ir@@ onic , r@@ aci@@ al subject concentrated w cau@@ m@@ at ) .
the festival ’ s biggest visitors ’ magne@@ ts include an interview : david ste@@ in@@ berg talks with lar@@ ry david .
ste@@ in@@ berg began as a stand@@ -up com@@ edi@@ an , but has become a respected television and film director and an un@@ official com@@ edy film history artist .
from 2005 to 2007 he moder@@ ated a television programme entitled “ sit down com@@ edy with david ste@@ in@@ berg ” at tv land .
the meeting will take place in the town hall in the heart of man@@ h@@ att@@ an .
“ the city is definitely in the com@@ edy d@@ na of lar@@ ry ’ s entire work , ” said ste@@ in@@ berg .
he told me when he is here , then he sometimes goes through the street between two buildings and thin@@ ks : he@@ y , when i lose all my money , then i may live here .
iran ’ s nuclear negotiations
iran is demonstr@@ ating itself a week before the next nuclear meeting with the five un ve@@ to@@ es and germany satisfied with the negotiation process .
&quot; after years , an agreement has been reached with the international atom@@ ic energy agency to resolve the differences of recent years , &quot; foreign minister mo@@ ham@@ med d@@ sch@@ aw@@ ad s@@ ari@@ f wrote at his fac@@ e@@ book page .
it would be a long way off , but the nuclear negoti@@ ator was satisfied with the negotiation process and optim@@ istic that both sides would end up with a solution .
dr@@ ama in ur@@ u@@ gu@@ ay : young k@@ ills gam@@ bling cham@@ der@@ ades with mac@@ he@@ te and ma@@ che@@ te .
two children have died in ur@@ u@@ gu@@ ay of a 1@@ 1-@@ year-@@ old .
the two 14 and 12 year-@@ old bo@@ ys had invited their victims to go on bird hun@@ ting with them .
with mac@@ he@@ tes and k@@ ni@@ ves they st@@ aged the 1@@ 1-@@ year-@@ old on tuesday and thre@@ w the cor@@ pse into a well , reported the story of &quot; el p@@ á@@ í@@ s &quot; on thursday .
they would then have to play football in front of their homes in a work@@ ing-@@ class quarter .
the cor@@ pse was found in the village of cer@@ ro pel@@ ado , 15 kilometers north of the exclusive beach there pun@@ ta del est@@ e , 15 kilometers north .
as an ali@@ bi , a fi@@ ve-@@ year half-@@ si@@ ster of the younger , who took them with them , should say that it was sex@@ ually att@@ acked by the boy .
but when the girl was in front of the police , without men@@ tioning an attack on her , the two bo@@ ys gave the deliber@@ ate killing of the 11 year-@@ old .
the older one , among other reasons , called ri@@ val@@ ry in the football game .
he was tempor@@ arily transferred to a psy@@ chi@@ at@@ ric youth institution .
p@@ im@@ ps must be put in prison
the explo@@ it@@ ative trafficking of human beings , p@@ im@@ per@@ ing , threat , insul@@ t and dangerous physical in@@ jury have resulted in the kon@@ stan@@ z district court turning a 3@@ 3-@@ year-@@ old man from st. george into three and a half years in prison .
the former german military soldi@@ er , who was the turkish president after two operations in afghanistan , set up a military bar@@ r@@ age in a process agreement .
he has therefore , in five cases , met women through internet or telephone contacts , which he has been able to put to the bottom of the matter after a few weeks against their will .
he used to resi@@ st by using force and threats to break .
women &apos;s income , which has been partly generated for them for years , has been kept .
by conf@@ is@@ c@@ ating mobile phones and si@@ m cards , he was able to fo@@ ster contacts between women and the outside world .
together with a colleague who told women , he brought them to various bro@@ th@@ els in the sou@@ th@@ west .
there he had some monitoring to control their revenue .
in court , the def@@ end@@ ant initially claimed that he was suffering from a severe tra@@ um@@ a , after colleagues in afghanistan died alongside him in an explo@@ sion .
after a psy@@ chi@@ at@@ ric expert had expressed great doubts about mental re@@ stra@@ int , and thus about a limited guil@@ t , the 3@@ 3-@@ year-@@ old set a comprehensive conf@@ ession .
the court had no longer had to hear any of the women who were in@@ ju@@ red .
as a k@@ ri@@ po official reported , after an initial display by telephone monitoring measures at least four more cases of explo@@ it@@ ative trafficking in human beings could be identified .
the inter@@ ro@@ g@@ ated talks were marked by high aggres@@ sion .
in later inter@@ ro@@ gation , the in@@ ju@@ red party would have confirmed their mar@@ ty@@ r@@ dom .
another witness , where one of the women is blue spots on the whole body , has not yet made any statement .
it is &apos; a completely broken person@@ ality &apos; , which perpe@@ tu@@ ates violence and exploitation in this profes@@ sion as normal .
the def@@ end@@ ant regre@@ t@@ ted his behaviour yesterday .
&quot; he has dis@@ solved from these cir@@ cles and wants to live a normal life after being imprison@@ ed , &quot; he said .
oil prices continue to rise to usd 96 per bar@@ re@@ l .
the price of oil continued to fall on friday , after concerns over a high supply over@@ sh@@ ad@@ ow@@ ed a report that the ener@@ g@@ y-@@ hun@@ gr@@ y manufacturing sector in china is growing .
the reference cru@@ de oil variety for deli@@ veries in december was in electronic commerce in europe at the new york mer@@ can@@ tile exchange in the late morning of december , at 14 c@@ ents to 9@@ 6.@@ 24 usd per bar@@ re@@ l .
the contract fell by 39 c@@ ents on thursday , which means a 5.@@ 8 percent drop in the price in october .
the large range of cru@@ de oil has put a stra@@ in on prices in recent weeks .
the us department of energy declared on wednesday that the us offer had increased by 4.@@ 1 million bar@@ re@@ ls last week .
over the course of five weeks , the offer had ris@@ en by 25 million bar@@ re@@ ls .
but on friday there were indic@@ ations of increased demand by two reports of an increase in chinese manufacturing activity .
this suggests a continued recovery of china ’ s economy , with growth reaching 7.@@ 8 % in the third quarter , after the economic slow@@ down in the previous quarter .
cru@@ de oil from the b@@ rent variety , a reference value for international cru@@ de oil , which is also used by us re@@ fin@@ eries , fell to the ice ext@@ ingu@@ ishing plant in london by 26 c@@ ents .
court blocks decision on stop@@ -@@ and-@@ fr@@ is@@ k directive of the ny@@ p@@ d .
a federal appeal court in the united states bloc@@ ked the appointment of a judge on thursday that would bring about changes to the stop and fr@@ is@@ k programme ( “ stop and search ” ) of the new york police department .
the 2nd us court of appeal declared that judge sh@@ ira sch@@ ü@@ t@@ d@@ lin ’ s decisions would be suspended until a court of appeal had been decided .
the judge had jud@@ ged in august that the city was in breach of the constitution by the way in which the programme for stop@@ ping and ques@@ tioning people was implemented .
the city appe@@ aled against its assessment and the ordered re@@ medi@@ es , including the decision to create a monitoring centre to monitor the police in the change of their directive and the corresponding training programme .
the court of appeal heard the arguments on tuesday about the required suspension .
the appeal report stated that the judge must be fre@@ ed from the case , since it does not respect the code of conduct for us jud@@ ges by determin@@ ing that a judge may appear to be par@@ tis@@ an ; this is something that should be avoided in part of the case .
the judge had jud@@ ged that police officers were viol@@ ating the civil rights of tens of thousands of people because they were in@@ adequ@@ ately targeted in black and latin american men with the stop@@ -@@ attack .
she appointed an external monitoring unit to monitor the implementation of significant changes , including reforms to directives , training and service supervision , and appointed a pilot programme with body carrying equipment .
in august , the city of new york agreed to end the practice of stor@@ ing names and addresses of people who were searching for police control .
an oral negotiation to call the city is scheduled for 14 march 20@@ 14 .
the stop and fr@@ is@@ k tac@@ tics have been developed by a number of civil rights def@@ enders .
such controls have been in various forms for decades , but the number of checks recorded during the term of the par@@ tis@@ an may@@ or michael blo@@ om@@ berg has ris@@ en to an all-@@ time high of 6@@ 8@@ 4.@@ 3@@ 30 in 2011 , most of which is latin america .
in 2004 , four men , including all minorities , brought a compla@@ int , which turned out to be a collective action .
sup@@ porters of stop and fr@@ is@@ k changes to the ny@@ p@@ d say that changes will lead to unfair practices and create a tru@@ st@@ worthy and effective policy .
oppon@@ ents believe that the changes will d@@ amp@@ en the mor@@ ality of the police , but not crimin@@ ality ; money would also be was@@ ted and the broader problem of a police force that has been left behind after the loss of thousands of jobs in the last decade .
the judge pointed out that she had not yet signed the stop and fr@@ is@@ k practice , which was constitu@@ tionally based , but only the nature of the implementation of checks by the n@@ y@@ p@@ d .

with this pra@@ yer wis@@ dom , the first chairman , wol@@ f@@ gan@@ g hen@@ ne , described the history and fas@@ c@@ ination of the association &quot; helping hands &quot; .
on saturday afternoon , the t@@ enth birth@@ day of the association was celebrated , which has already had considerable success .
the first chairman , hen@@ ne , reported in detail about the work of the association .
he was the first to visit maur@@ it@@ ania in the che@@ ij@@ k z@@ aj@@ ed hospital in n@@ ou@@ ak@@ ch@@ ot@@ t in 2004 .
as a result , further cooperation has developed , and gy@@ na@@ eco@@ log@@ ist hen@@ ne has performed numerous operations on the spot on several trips .
during the speeches , pictures of the missions on a large screen were shown , so that the guests of the anniversary event can distingu@@ ish themselves from the actions mentioned .
the association &apos;s deser@@ t vehicle was also shown .
it is a former federal border protection vehicle .
ra@@ iner pre@@ w@@ o , the former o@@ b of n@@ ag@@ old , had made the proposal to equi@@ p this vehicle with a photo@@ vol@@ ta@@ ic system and now plans to participate in the association in an advisory capacity , according to h@@ anne .
in 2008 , zim@@ mer@@ i sch@@ le@@ e@@ h from ba@@ i@@ er@@ s@@ br@@ on@@ n won the first medical treatment in so@@ co@@ gi@@ m , a mis@@ er@@ able district on the edge of the capital , hon@@ or@@ ary hon@@ or@@ ary .

cou@@ l@@ son used telephone h@@ acking to check a tip .
the previous news of the word editor and@@ y cou@@ l@@ son claimed to have put “ tele@@ ph@@ one-@@ h@@ acking , surveillance , and confron@@ tation ” in an attempt to get a wrong tip about an aff@@ air of the then interior minister , charles .
prosecu@@ tor andre@@ w ed@@ is q@@ c declared to the court in the old b@@ ail@@ ey , news of the world had a false rum@@ or in may 2005 that clar@@ ke had a relationship with his “ attractive special advis@@ er ” .
the newspaper commission@@ ed gl@@ en@@ n mul@@ ca@@ ire to investigate pa@@ w@@ l@@ b@@ ys vo@@ ic@@ em@@ ail@@ s .
“ the prosecu@@ tor ’ s office believes that cou@@ l@@ son , who is now the publish@@ er of the not@@ w , is no man standing in front of the home of people and hopes to catch them on fresh de@@ ed , but rather a story of people .
he said that not@@ w uses three methods to investigate stories investi@@ ga@@ tively : telephone ha@@ z@@ ards , surveillance , and confron@@ tation .
the publish@@ er is personally involved in the third method .
he obviously knows of the second , the monitoring , otherwise it cannot be .
what about the first ?
does he know about telephone h@@ acking ?
he is den@@ ying that , but we say , ‘ and whether he knew of it ’ .
rum@@ ors of a clar@@ kes aff@@ air were first heard by the feature ed@@ it@@ orial at not@@ w when a source that was sex@@ ually linked to pa@@ w@@ l@@ by was said .
a band with vo@@ ic@@ em@@ ail@@ s from your phone from at least three occasions was recorded in august 2006 in mul@@ ca@@ i@@ res apartment .
the investig@@ ators also found entries on the computer of the detec@@ tive , on the pav@@ l@@ by and their si@@ ster as “ projects ” .
in the time when the search was going , the grand@@ parents of pa@@ w@@ l@@ by received anonymous calls to make them look for information about them .

on 18 june 2005 , cou@@ l@@ son left her a vo@@ ic@@ email with the following content : “ i have a story that we want to release tomorrow , about which i would like to talk to charles . ”
ed@@ is explained that cou@@ l@@ son &apos;s activities in this story followed the same pattern as other important person@@ alities , such as former interior minister david bl@@ un@@ ket@@ t .
the jur@@ ies heard on thursday that cou@@ l@@ son bl@@ un@@ ket@@ t was arrested for an aff@@ air with a married woman when he himself was facing the co-@@ accused .

in protest against the planned wealth tax , french football will indeed be the first strike since 197@@ 2 .
a conciliation meeting will end without results .
in the conflict over the wealth tax , the government and professional football in france have been looking for a failed arbitr@@ ation meeting in a sadd@@ le .
president fran@@ ç@@ o@@ is hol@@ lan@@ de received a speech at the é@@ ly@@ s@@ ée palace in paris on thursday , which was attended by representatives of the association and listened to their complaints .
he refused to play the football from the planned 7@@ 5-@@ percent increase in the number of players in the tournament .
the other side , too , was tough .
the strike announced at the end of november will now be carried through , the chief association of professional clubs ( uc@@ p@@ f ) , je@@ an-@@ pi@@ er@@ re lou@@ vel , announced .
the agreement reached between 29 november and 2 december in the li@@ gue 1 and li@@ gue 2 is therefore exp@@ ired .
ge@@ aring : no absolute protection possible
&quot; we want to involve the inhabitants early in the planning , &quot; opened may@@ or j@@ ens h@@ ä@@ u@@ ß@@ ler the ci@@ vic information event on flo@@ od protection in ge@@ ch@@ ingen .
around 80 participants had come to the municip@@ al hall to explain the planned measures , ask questions , raise concerns and present ideas .
he made it clear : &quot; the final decisions are made by the members of the municip@@ al council &quot; .
the floo@@ ds that hit the country on 15 may 2009 were an un@@ prepared disaster .
a river bas@@ in survey was conducted with the neighbouring municip@@ ality of a@@ id@@ ling@@ en , which now forms the basis for the flo@@ od protection concept in ge@@ ch@@ ingen .
&quot; the protection of as many cultiv@@ ated p@@ lots as possible is the goal , &quot; says h@@ ag@@ g@@ ler .
the planning of protection against a weather service according to german statistics is based on a statistical analysis of the expected floo@@ ds every 100 years .
climate change is being tack@@ led by a 15 % sur@@ charge .
in the field of research this is described as &quot; h@@ q 100@@ ak@@ li@@ ma &quot; .
the water mass@@ es that caused considerable damage in 200@@ 9@@ in g@@ ech@@ ingen were equivalent to a 10@@ 00@@ -@@ year-@@ old flo@@ od .
&quot; there is no absolute protection , but a relative improvement we can achieve , &quot; says hu@@ ge@@ ly .
to protect h@@ q 100@@ ak@@ li@@ ma , you must have around four million euros invested in ec@@ h@@ ingen , with the municip@@ ality receiving state subsidies of around 70 percent .
but ha@@ un@@ ted pointed out that it was only possible to promote it if an overall concept was implemented .
the community should be dependent on the participation of the citizens .
a complex planning and approval procedure must be completed .
in the best case , implementation could begin in 20@@ 16 .
among other things , the concept of protection , which was presented in the council of municip@@ alities last week ( we reported ) provides for local measures in the flow of the river ir@@ m from the local valley .
following the presentation of the flo@@ od protection concept , participants took the opportunity to contribute their concerns .
one of the questions raised was why more dam@@ s and reser@@ vo@@ irs were not planned to protect the site .
gre@@ g@@ or k@@ ü@@ hn , the technical plan@@ ner of the commission@@ ed engineering firm wal@@ d and cor@@ be from h@@ ü@@ gel@@ sh@@ ei@@ m , who presented the concept , stressed that it needed the interaction of all presented measures to achieve the desired goal .
in addition , it is necessary to find the most econom@@ ical solution , according to jo@@ achi@@ m wal@@ d von wal@@ d and cor@@ be .
there was dis@@ satisfaction among al@@ t@@ ore &apos;s residents , who were still in the cold during normal rain .
the problem is well known to the administration and initial measures have already been taken .
but ha@@ un@@ ted pointed out that the channel system guidelines are different from those for flo@@ od protection , not for@@ getting that .
the municip@@ ality is obliged to interpre@@ t the channel network in such a way that two to three years of reg@@ ener@@ ation could be con@@ qu@@ ered .
the se@@ wage channels to scale up would dev@@ our millions .
after col@@ li@@ sion
on friday afternoon , 44 people are on the state road 44 near reven@@ s@@ dorf , near two drivers were seriously in@@ ju@@ red in a fron@@ tal col@@ li@@ sion .
the police immediately closed the road completely , but could not do much to the accident .
however , there are various testi@@ mon@@ ies that should be evalu@@ ated first .
it is clear that the 19@@ -@@ year-@@ old driver of a v@@ w golf has gone in the direction of reven@@ s@@ dorf and that the 3@@ 8-@@ year-@@ old ge@@ tt@@ or@@ f man has come to her with his hy@@ un@@ da@@ i .
both vehicles cl@@ ash@@ ed , with the woman so badly tr@@ app@@ ed that the fire bri@@ g@@ ade took almost half an hour to get them out of the w@@ rec@@ k .
the actual cause of the accident was initially un@@ clear .
both of the un@@ happy came to nearby hospit@@ als .
the track remained closed for about two hours .
it could be called the do@@ sto@@ y@@ ev@@ sky of the united states .
phili@@ p k. dic@@ k was a go@@ d-@@ search , a me@@ ta@@ physi@@ c@@ ist , his nov@@ els and stories have also something ser@@ ial .
the relationship in the ou@@ ter world is ast@@ on@@ ishing : the eyes , be@@ ard , high fore@@ head .
and as f@@ j@@ od@@ or m. do@@ sto@@ ev@@ ski with his massive o@@ eu@@ vre as founder and apo@@ log@@ ist of the russian soul is to be understood , phili@@ p k@@ . di@@ ck is read as an american pro@@ ph@@ et .
some tit@@ les have been published by he@@ y@@ ne ver@@ la@@ g , the ha@@ ff@@ man@@ s cas@@ set@@ te with the 1@@ 18 stories distributed by two thousand .
th@@ ick explains america - the real@@ m of breathtaking technical progress , cou@@ pled with par@@ an@@ o@@ ia , security man@@ ia , and the belief that it is chosen .
th@@ ick had experience of god , his late books read like a mix@@ ture of the rev@@ el@@ ation of john and a computer manual .
perhaps he was cra@@ zy , had put drugs on his brain .
he has cap@@ tured , early on , that the computers are div@@ ini@@ ties .
he wrote a computer the@@ ology and asked what a human being can do from a machine that the cre@@ ator had from his creature .
this is the &quot; bl@@ ade run@@ ner &quot; problem .
killing .
a master of science fic@@ tion .
a fantastic writer .
his stories have been directed by film directors such as rid@@ ley scot@@ t , paul ver@@ ho@@ even and ste@@ ven spi@@ el@@ berg .
this story is now particularly significant .
the &quot; minority report &quot; dates from 195@@ 6 , it ex@@ u@@ des the sm@@ ell of cold war and the mc@@ car@@ thy report .
the principle of &apos; pre-@@ crime &apos; is being developed here , &apos; pre-@@ crime &apos; , that is , what has become more or less official doc@@ tr@@ ine of the white house .
in dic@@ k ’ s world , which res@@ emb@@ les our terri@@ fying , mu@@ t@@ ants look to the future – and the police are interven@@ ing .
&quot; we collect individuals who do not viol@@ ate any law , &quot; says the chief of the authority .
&quot; we are sn@@ app@@ ing us even before they can commit a violent crime .
and : &quot; in our society there are no serious crimin@@ als , for which we have a criminal court full of pes@@ u@@ do crimin@@ als &quot; .
they assume that bad things are happening and prevent the criminal idea from being put into practice .
dic@@ k ’ s nar@@ ra@@ tive works like the blue@@ print for anti-@@ terrorist laws and the n@@ sa ’ s e@@ av@@ es@@ dro@@ pping of the n@@ sa .
anticip@@ ation of the attack : that is how obama ’ s dr@@ one philosophy and practice works .
but dic@@ k &apos;s story is not over yet .
the chief of the police compla@@ ins that there is no longer any separation of powers , the military controls everyday life - and what remains of the state .
then the supervis@@ or will be monitored and a future crime will be carried out .
the system is turning through .
it is perfect , but it lies .
it is creating its own pre@@ conditions .
does errors and victims not only purchase , but also build on it .
the system creates the danger it is fighting .
phili@@ p k. dic@@ k read is to keep coming closer to the truth .
mer@@ kel ’ s late hat@@ ch for russia
the former us intelligence expert ed@@ ward snow@@ den could be in the us late hat@@ ch for federal chancell@@ or ang@@ ela mer@@ kel , also in his russian asylum .
representatives of the german federal bar association could either ask questions in writing or give the 30 year-@@ old a personal meeting in russia , the agency inter@@ fax reported .
previously , the green federal depu@@ ty han@@ s-@@ christian str@@ ö@@ be@@ le was the first german politici@@ an to introduce snow@@ den in moscow yesterday to discuss with him the aff@@ air .
n@@ sa rev@@ el@@ ations reinforce par@@ an@@ o@@ ia of the company due to state surveillance .
on a mil@@ d day at the end of august , a german police helicop@@ ter fle@@ w deep across the us consul@@ ate in frankfurt am main , the financial capital of germany .
on the orders of the federal office for constitutional protection and counter@@ -@@ terrorism ( b@@ v@@ t ) , the german internal security service , he should be the photograph@@ er of the roof of the us post office , which is less than 5 km from the european central bank .
according to german media , the b@@ v@@ t wanted to check the presence of surveillance an@@ ten@@ n@@ as and the action led to a change of words between the us and the german foreign ministry in berlin .
james cla@@ pper , american director of national intelligence , was again insi@@ sting in september that the us should not allow the possibility of over@@ seas es@@ pi@@ on@@ age “ to protect the business secre@@ ts of foreign companies on behalf of us companies .
but since ed@@ ward snow@@ den , who was turned into wh@@ ist@@ le@@ b@@ low@@ ers , with the release of his cor@@ n to us surveillance secre@@ ts , the us has become increasingly aware of the need for european governments and corporate heads .
reports that the us national security agency has not yet informed the braz@@ ili@@ an oil company petro@@ ba and is collec@@ ting data from american cl@@ oud suppliers , including google and y@@ a@@ ho@@ o , have not yet fully covered the company divi@@ sions .
the over@@ flow has brought the rev@@ el@@ ation that chancell@@ or ang@@ ela mer@@ kel ’ s telephone was inter@@ tw@@ ined , possibly for ten years .
if the most powerful person in europe can be targeted , then it is certain that company management will also be potential targets .
snow@@ den has continued the intensive cooperation between us intelligence services and companies .
i think it is con@@ cei@@ vable that this data will be used for mutual benefit .
“ germany must wake up , ” explains oli@@ ver green , president of bit@@ mi , the small and medium-sized it companies in germany .
german companies believe that the us now poses almost as great a risk as china in terms of industrial es@@ pi@@ on@@ age and data the@@ ft , such a survey that was conducted by the ber@@ at@@ er company ey in july .
in the areas le@@ ak@@ ed by snow@@ den , however , there has been no evidence that the us has not yet fully dis@@ closed the business secre@@ ts of foreign companies to its own companies .
politicians have expressed concern that the eu has not been given certain it and internet opportunities and that they have reduced their dependence on the us .
businesses are s@@ cep@@ tical about this .
in the bun@@ de@@ sta@@ g it was suggested that we should build a german google .
i can only close my eyes and slowly open them again ...
“ that ’ s not how it works , ” says h@@ as@@ so pl@@ att@@ ner , chairman of the german software manufacturer sap .
if we want a strong european it industry , we would not have had to let it die out 20 years ago .
all of this is subsid@@ ised in germany , from coal to cars to agriculture .
everything except for the it industry .
however , reach and technical re@@ fin@@ ement have enabled the snow@@ den rev@@ el@@ ations to reach the us sp@@ y authorities .
cl@@ oud compu@@ ting is a major change , because european business leaders are now more aware that in the us stored data of their legal systems are subject to their jurisdiction and therefore potentially vulnerable .
according to a survey carried out by the cl@@ oud security alliance , a commercial institution , the number of people in the world was high , following the rev@@ el@@ ations about us data mining activities with pris@@ m .
j@@ im sn@@ ab@@ e , depu@@ ty managing director of sap , says : “ we see a new question from customers who had it a year ago – they are : where will my data be stored and can they guarantee that they will be protected .
many german corporate leaders believe that the latest reports simply confirm what they have already known .
the fact that economic es@@ pi@@ on@@ age is taking place is no surprise .
that has always been the case .
“ it was a topic for many years and has not changed fundament@@ ally through the current discussion , ” says kur@@ t bo@@ ck , chairman of the chemical company bas@@ f .
the americans are sp@@ ying on us at both commercial and industrial level , just as we are doing , because it is in the national interest to defend our companies .
the management normally does not bo@@ ast about the counter@@ measures that have been taken , because that gives an att@@ ack@@ er benefits .
in large companies , employees have long been aware that taking a free usb stick on a trade fair or un@@ attended computer is a major problem .
ul@@ rich h@@ ack@@ en@@ ber@@ k , member of the board of directors of auto@@ manufacturer au@@ di , says that it has been a standard practice for years to collect the mobile phones before a board meeting so that they are not used as inter@@ cep@@ tors .
the german b@@ v@@ t advis@@ es leaders to use simple prepa@@ id phones when they are on trips abroad , because smart phones are not possible to compromise .
the prepa@@ id phones are thro@@ wn away afterwards .
there is concern , however , that small and medium-sized enterprises are vulnerable to h@@ acking and monitoring .
in germany , many of these companies are global market leaders in their respective nic@@ he .
“ small and medium-sized enterprises often lack the experience , the staff and the financial resources to effectively protect trade secre@@ ts against un@@ authorised access , ” the b@@ v@@ t war@@ ns in a report .
the us war@@ ns its own firms about economic es@@ pi@@ on@@ age by other countries .
according to washington , the us national intelligence es@@ timate in february brought france , russia , and israel into second place behind china , two of the countries that have committed themselves to obtaining h@@ ack@@ ings ’ economic data .
a member of the board of directors of a german blu@@ e-@@ chi@@ p company agreed to take a lead in the area of industrial es@@ pi@@ on@@ age , then “ the french are the worst ” .
bern@@ ard squ@@ ar@@ cin@@ i , former head of the french internal security service d@@ cr@@ l , was inter@@ viewed this month with the following words : “ the intelligence services know very well that all countries , even if they are in the war .

parents of a te@@ en@@ ager from georgia who were killed in a tragic accident believe in murder and murder .
the te@@ en@@ ager &apos;s parents , whose body is found in a ro@@ lled ro@@ lled r@@ ing@@ er@@ mat@@ te in the gym of his high school , are convinced that their son was mur@@ dered , the law@@ yer explained the family on thursday .
k@@ end@@ ric@@ k jo@@ hn@@ son of val@@ do@@ sta in the us state of georgia was arrested on 11 january in a ma@@ te. this mat@@ te was placed behind the gallery in the school gym .
sh@@ eri@@ ff &apos;s investig@@ ators at low@@ n@@ des county came to the conclusion that jo@@ hn@@ son was a member of the un security council in a tragic accident , which the family of 17 years doub@@ ted .
“ they are convinced that their son was mur@@ dered , ” ben@@ jam@@ in cr@@ um@@ p , the law@@ yer of ken@@ ne@@ th and jac@@ qu@@ el@@ y@@ n jo@@ hn@@ son , declared himself to be mur@@ dered by fo@@ x@@ new@@ s.@@ com@@ .
they would never have believed that he had died as the sh@@ eri@@ ff had s@@ wal@@ low@@ ed .
“ they believe that it is un@@ thin@@ k@@ able to viol@@ ate the laws of physi@@ cs as well as common sense .
instead , they are convinced that the truth is being conce@@ aled to protect the person or person responsible for the death of their son .
&quot; her son went to school to learn and returned to the cor@@ pse , &quot; he comm@@ ented .
us prosecu@@ tor michael mo@@ ore said on thursday that there will be a formal investigation into the death of jo@@ hn@@ son , as a number of important questions remain un@@ resolved .
what was the cause of death ?
is his death due to a crime ?
mo@@ ore explained this at a press conference on thursday afternoon .
i follow the facts , wh@@ ic@@ he@@ ver direction you are heading in .
my goal is to find out the truth .
“ i believe that a sufficient basis for a formal investigation of the data is available , ” he said .
mo@@ ore explained to re@@ porters who interpre@@ t initial au@@ top@@ sy that jo@@ hn@@ son was un@@ aware of the consequences of a “ posi@@ tion-@@ related sti@@ fl@@ ation . ”
a second au@@ top@@ sy , however , caused another death , so mo@@ ore .
“ there are a number of questions that need to be answered or confirmed , ” he said .
mo@@ ore added , if there is sufficient evidence for criminal or civil law investigation of the death of jo@@ hn@@ son , that would be the fat@@ al test of the f@@ bi in carrying out the investigation .
a representative of county sh@@ eri@@ ff &apos;s authority was present at our request on thursday , not ready to comment .
a court in southern georgia ordered the trial of the authorities to ce@@ ase all surveillance videos on wednesday .
the te@@ en@@ ager ’ s parents said that they hoped that the video rec@@ ord@@ ings contained evidence of how he died .
c@@ dc publish aller@@ gy guidelines for schools and schools .
on wednesday , the centers for disease control published a report on the prevention of cancer in the united states .
these are the first such directives that the us government issued , as the number of school children with food aller@@ gies is increasing .
one in 20 children in the united states now have food aller@@ gy .
the spread of food aller@@ gies among children has , according to the c@@ dc , increased by 18 % between 1997 and 2007 .
the guidelines contain information for schools that is sensitive to food aller@@ gies by the teachers and staff and how children are treated .
it is also recommended that schools supply ep@@ in@@ ep@@ hr@@ in – the auto injec@@ tion of ep@@ ip@@ en is most common .
the legisl@@ ators in the states have recently amended the rules so that schools can easily supply ep@@ in@@ ep@@ hr@@ in .
the report also lists typical symp@@ t@@ oms caused by children who are suffering from aller@@ gic re@@ actions .
children may say , “ it feels like something is on my ton@@ gue , ” “ my ton@@ gue feels like it is on my face , as if a hair is on it , ” or “ my ton@@ gue is ri@@ b@@ bel@@ t . ”
parents of inter@@ sexual children can choose “ sex v@@ aries ” .
germany is the first european nation to have a third sex recognised for children who are not accompanied by un@@ equi@@ vo@@ cal gen@@ itali@@ a .
new@@ born bab@@ ies are no longer made rigi@@ dly male or female .
under the new law , parents no longer have to declare sex for such children , but can be “ un@@ determined ” or “ not determined ” on the birth certificate .
the aim of the law is to take the pressure from parents so that they do not take ha@@ sty decisions on operations for the as@@ sign@@ ment of sex@@ es to new@@ born children , and to combat discrimination against inter@@ sexual people .
according to the bb@@ c , an inter@@ sexual person said years later : “ i am neither a man nor a woman . ”
i remain the pat@@ ch@@ work created by doctors , mu@@ ti@@ lated and full of sc@@ ars .
it is estimated that one in 2@@ ,000 children die every year neither as a boy nor as a girl .
they are among the inter@@ sex@@ u@@ als , a group that is under the diagno@@ sis of ‘ sexual differenti@@ ation dis@@ order ’ ( ds@@ d ) , a collective term for people with at@@ y@@ pical ch@@ ro@@ mo@@ som@@ es , ger@@ ms and other diseases .
wall@@ is simp@@ son may have been inter@@ sexual .
understanding gender identification is still not very well developed , but most experts in the us suggest that they should not use the best available information on gender .
the new york psy@@ chi@@ at@@ ris@@ t dr. j@@ ack dres@@ cher , who focuses on the problem of gender identification , said that the new german law “ bl@@ essing for a good cause ” .
inter@@ sexual children are an ethical dil@@ em@@ ma .
“ some people have life@@ -@@ threat@@ ening diseases that can lead to sur@@ g@@ ical intervention , but for most children this is not true , ” he said .
you can do sexual as@@ sign@@ ment without sur@@ gery and then wait for identity to develop .
the scientific data on how a child develops its gender identity at all is not very accurate .
no one knows why it is happening .
it is like the secret why people are hom@@ os@@ ex@@ ual .
in a report to the european commission in 2011 , it is stated that inter@@ sexual people are excluded from trans@@ sexual or trans@@ gender persons , because their status is not gender .
these features were shown in secondary sexual characteristics such as mus@@ cle mass , hair loss , fr@@ ying and stat@@ ure , mainly in sexual and psycho@@ logical aspects such as re@@ productive and physical activity .
the report also provides an overview of discrimination , which affects inter@@ sexual and trans@@ gender people in professional life , and the extent of har@@ ass@@ ment , violence and pre@@ jud@@ ice crises .
not in line with the gender picture , now have a special camp .
in the meantime , it is possible for adults in australia and ne@@ pal to access official documents male , female or “ third sex . ”
in june , austr@@ ali@@ an nor@@ ri@@ e ma@@ y-@@ wel@@ by ( 52 ) was chosen as the world ’ s first “ g@@ end@@ er-@@ free ” person after a court rul@@ ed that a “ un@@ determined ” gender status had been maintained for life .
german cards will have a third as@@ sign@@ ment , x for inter@@ sex@@ u@@ ality , alongside m and w , so the ministry of the interior will .
in neighbouring france , gender issues are still controversial , so a news post has shown that the french are 24 .
in 2011 , do@@ z@@ ens of french meps from the strictly catho@@ lic country signed a peti@@ tion that “ gender theory ” would be removed from school books .
the u.s. website catho@@ lic online also has an objec@@ tion to german law , with the justi@@ fication : “ if the world had been drag@@ ged into a new state where sex is a decision to be sexual activity but not sexual activity , then we do not .
the mother of a new@@ born from mar@@ y@@ land explained to baby zone , they would be better off if bab@@ ies were a sex at birth .
“ being parents is also possible without further restrictions .
children need stability and security .
histor@@ ically , children who have worked with both male and female sex@@ es have been given the opportunity to study her@@ ma@@ ph@@ ro@@ d@@ ite , after the attractive greek god who both sex@@ es had .
ten years ago , medicine regarded sex as something that could be wi@@ ped out and then re@@ built .
but now the ethical foundations of an operation are being ques@@ tioned , now that we know how complex the gender identity is and that doctors are able to lie wrong because they do not know how the child is growing up with the child .
“ in the middle of the tw@@ enti@@ eth century , one was called a “ psy@@ chi@@ at@@ ric emergency , ” said dres@@ cher .
if such a child was born , then no one called the psy@@ chi@@ at@@ ris@@ t , but the sur@@ ge@@ on .
the prevail@@ ing theory on the treatment of children with un@@ clear gen@@ ital org@@ ans is based on dr. john money from jo@@ hn@@ s ho@@ p@@ k@@ ins university , who believed that gender was a formal factor .
he co@@ ined the term “ gender identity , ” argu@@ ing that social and environmental incentives – as the parents have a child – are inter@@ ag@@ on@@ ised with gen@@ es and hor@@ mon@@ es of a child and shaped them as such .
but , in a report known as john / jo@@ an , published in 196@@ 6 , his the@@ ories were controversial .
he advis@@ ed the parents of a boy whose pen@@ is was killed by a ple@@ ated circum@@ ci@@ sion , to leave the child completely .
“ money presented this case as a successful example of a transformation , but it was not , ” says dres@@ cher .
when the boy was about 15 , he moved back to the male sex and married a woman .
he was a member of the royal family of the royal family of the united states .
according to dres@@ cher , there are still doctors who would practice this model .
but , in the 1990 ’ s , with the internet ’ s entry , survi@@ v@@ ors of these gender operations came to the public , “ not happy with the outcome . ”
for example , at j@@ im bru@@ ce , a 3@@ 6-@@ year-@@ old author from mon@@ tan@@ a who worked with x@@ y-@@ male ch@@ ro@@ mo@@ som@@ es but who was ambigu@@ ous gen@@ itali@@ a .
doctors were un@@ aware of whether he had a great cl@@ it@@ or@@ is or a small pen@@ is and were convinced that he could never achieve a “ satisfactory life ” as a man .
so its external body and the te@@ eth were quickly removed shortly after birth in 197@@ 6 , and he was taken up as a girl .
at the age of 12 he was given female hor@@ mon@@ es .
“ i knew i am not a girl , ” he explained to ab@@ c@@ news@@ .com that i am not a girl .
i was un@@ happy , but it was really difficult to ask questions .
at the age of 18 he should receive a v@@ ag@@ inal plastic .
but , as he was and knew that something was not right , he demanded that his medical ac@@ ts. he was not a man of the same name .
what he found was sho@@ cking .
i was ster@@ il@@ ised at birth – and no one ever told me .
bru@@ ce was born with a ds@@ d , through which his body did not have enough te@@ sto@@ ster@@ one to develop gen@@ itali@@ a .
after hearing the truth , he moved to the male identity again , received te@@ sto@@ ster@@ on injec@@ tions and let his bre@@ asts be removed .
the sur@@ gery has made it inf@@ er@@ tile .
today , he is fighting for others in an organization called interface project to ensure that inter@@ sexual people are per@@ ceived as normal .
but anne tam@@ ar@@ -@@ mat@@ tis , managing director of the california based legal group ad@@ vo@@ cat@@ es for in@@ for@@ med@@ -@@ cho@@ ice , is concerned that the law of germany “ is not a st@@ amp and sti@@ t@@ ching . ”
“ many activi@@ sts are wor@@ ried that the german decision could encourage parents to make quick decisions and give the child a “ un@@ determined ” , she explained .
we fear that this will favour intervention .
we think it would be better to take into account the male or female sex and then wait .
but we do not yet know what the law will do , so we can only spec@@ ulate .
tam@@ ar@@ -@@ mat@@ tis said that her organisation supports the austr@@ ali@@ an law , because “ it allows adults to be recognised as a third sex ” .
“ adults should be able to make their own decisions on their legal sex , ” she explained .
german law is about the allocation of birth .
this is not a fight at which small children should be forced to do so at this stage .
when they are grown up , they can decide for themselves on their bodies .
but dr ar@@ len@@ e bar@@ at@@ z , a bru@@ stra@@ di@@ o@@ log@@ ist from pit@@ ts@@ burg who was a daughter with a sexual differenti@@ ation dis@@ order and hundreds of others in a self-@@ help group , says german law .
k@@ ati@@ e , the daughter of bar@@ at@@ z , was born with male ch@@ ro@@ mo@@ som@@ es , but has a ds@@ d called complete and@@ ro@@ gen@@ ic resistance .
the hotel is located in the heart of the city , close to the city centre and the main train station .
she has a v@@ ag@@ ina , but no u@@ ter@@ us and no ov@@ aries .
today k@@ ati@@ e is 29 and married ; she is a student at the university of pen@@ n@@ sy@@ l@@ v@@ ania .
it is inf@@ er@@ tile , but hopes to achieve a positive result by adopting or sur@@ ro@@ g@@ acy .
“ the law gives parents space , so they do not have to make ha@@ sty decisions , ” bar@@ at@@ z said .
it gives you the time to do different tests and to clarify things , giving you time before you become “ male ” or “ female ” .
in this way everything is fine – you are pul@@ ling the child big and you love it .
you have a wonderful baby and enjoy your paren@@ tal happ@@ iness .
and you do not have to rus@@ h into an operation that can no longer be rever@@ sed .
“ this includes the children in the decision and elimin@@ ates the fear of mo@@ cking parents because they feel that they are not the right thing . ” explains the “ i am not going to do it . ”
ultimately , the child deci@@ des on the gender that su@@ its him better – and that is wonderful .
this will enable children to make the decision themselves .
unknown girls in@@ j@@ ure women by shot from cars
unknown people have a 12@@ -@@ year-@@ old in sa@@ x@@ on@@ y-@@ an@@ hal@@ t when sho@@ oting from a car .
the perpe@@ tr@@ ators had probably been in gen@@ th@@ in with an air force on a group of children on thursday evening .
this was the message the police sent to the police in burg .
the girl was slightly w@@ oun@@ ded at the left w@@ ade .
rescue forces brought the girl to hospital .
the shot came from a small car that was on a group of six children and suddenly stopped .
wit@@ nesses saw two people sitting in the car .
the perpe@@ tr@@ ators also shot at a bus stop .
a dis@@ c bro@@ ke .
they then came from it .
the criminal police investig@@ ated , it was said on friday .
up to now , the police inspection k@@ emp@@ ten can look forward to a quiet hal@@ lo@@ ween night .
the officials were only given two eg@@ g children who were thro@@ wn to the house .
since the home@@ owners recognized this in good time and the eg@@ g depos@@ its were removed immediately , no material damage should have ar@@ is@@ en .
the city also has some new sy@@ l@@ ve@@ ster@@ b@@ ö@@ ller , but also here there is no material damage .
a local residents in the bis@@ ch@@ of friend@@ or@@ fer way reported that his car was wra@@ pped in paper and his wheel or@@ nam@@ ental ap@@ er@@ tures were sto@@ len .
until the police arrived , the man did not wear his wheel or@@ nam@@ ents in the immediate vicinity , so the police could not continue to work .
living with a future
wal@@ tr@@ au@@ d ries actually lives dre@@ am@@ like .
your house is located in a quiet residential area of stutt@@ gart with plenty of green , an old tree population , nice neighb@@ ors and not too much traffic .
the city is only a few minutes away by public transport .
&quot; hopefully you are not afraid of sp@@ id@@ ers ? &quot; , wal@@ tr@@ au@@ d ries as@@ ks and points to a f@@ at spi@@ der on the door frame .
i have been looking for a new apartment for my hus@@ band and myself for some time .
but you know how difficult this is in stutt@@ gart .
the reason is not spi@@ der pho@@ bia , but the concern to use the many sta@@ ir@@ cases to the house and the apartment at old age , explains it .
moreover , since a men@@ is@@ c@@ us operation , the mid@@ fif@@ ti@@ eth woman has had to learn her own hand what it means to deal with handic@@ ap from the floor .
recently , a book by her appeared on the theme of &apos; happ@@ ily living in old age - what kind of housing is the best for me ? &apos; .
&apos;@@ our apartment is the best example of what is not possible in old age &apos; , she begins to tell .
when you were in the ma@@ is@@ on@@ ette apartment with your hus@@ band more than 20 years ago , it was just a beautiful apartment in the middle of the green .
today , in mid-@@ fif@@ ty , wal@@ tr@@ au@@ d ries thin@@ ks differently about this .
but she also knows that she is one of the few people who are actually concerned with the issue of &apos; living in old age &apos; .
most people are ex@@ porting it as long as it is possible .
only the others are old , &apos; she says sm@@ ile .
only when the suffering is really great can one think .
&apos;@@ then it may be too late , &apos; says ries .
in her book , the interior architec@@ t presents 17 models of living for self-@@ determined living in old age .
&apos;@@ what type of housing you choose is always an individual choice &apos; , she explains .
d i e solution do not exist for the age .
even if you are looking for a reti@@ rement home in tus@@ c@@ any or brit@@ t@@ any , you should always consider that you will also be ill .
and &apos; without good knowledge of the national language , you can also agree in the dol@@ ce vit@@ a , &apos; gives the author of the book to consider res@@ et@@ t@@ le@@ ment .
among their models are classic models of care , alternative forms of housing or the often ci@@ ted pen@@ sion@@ ers &apos; co@@ ven@@ ant .
at age , everyone has their own tic@@ ks and f@@ ancy , and this is how everyone has their own tic@@ ks and f@@ ancy things to do .
&quot; for me , such a community would be nothing , &quot; she says with an eye cat@@ cher .
even not like a student world cup with a shared bathroom and kitchen .
&quot; in old times , you just need your re@@ treat rooms , &quot; says ries .
that a senior housing community can still function , the author wants to remain in@@ different .
this should then be done differently from the classic student co@@ in .
and sometimes you just want your peace , &apos; she believes .
it is at least not alone in the capital of the country .
&apos;@@ most of the old people in stutt@@ gart want to stay in their own home as long as possible &apos; , is also the experience of te@@ res@@ a r@@ ü@@ t@@ ten , the head of civil service living in the age of the state capital .
your department advis@@ es people on the subject of &apos; getting older &apos; .
that is why it is often the elderly who would accept in@@ convenience and restrictions just to be able to stay in their usual environment , that is also the experience of the foundation .
there are many ways to get to the house or apartment without any barriers .
ries recomm@@ ends that all those who are concerned with the re@@ building of their homes or homes according to age , first read carefully and not find the best cra@@ ft@@ sman .
today , there are also specialists for the re@@ building of old buildings .
even in the apartment , let some of them realize , and if it is only the toilet seat increase , the interior architec@@ t will clarify .
but the existing apartment cannot always be adapted to the age and therefore without barriers , even if it is still so beautiful .
wal@@ tr@@ au@@ d ries had to do this experience .
the room was very small and the bed was very comfortable .
it will continue until you find the ideal object for yourself and your hus@@ band .
before moving , she is more gra@@ y than she was before the spi@@ der at her apartment door .
the us wants to continue prosecu@@ ting snow@@ den
the us has changed its stance on former us intelligence officer ed@@ ward snow@@ den .
he is still accused of dis@@ closing un@@ authorised secret information .
he must therefore engage in criminal proceedings in the united states , said the us state department spo@@ kes@@ woman j@@ enni@@ fer p@@ sa@@ ki in washington .
the recent statements by snow@@ den would not change this either .
previously , german green politici@@ an han@@ s-@@ christian str@@ ö@@ be@@ le had a meeting with snow@@ den in moscow with the us to call on him not to pun@@ ish him any further .
p@@ sa@@ ki stressed that str@@ ang@@ le@@ hold was one of parliam@@ ent@@ arians &apos; mis@@ gi@@ v@@ ings , not that of a german member of the government .
ed@@ ward snow@@ den is basically a con@@ vers@@ ation with german authorities .
first , however , he wants to know his situation .
this is what the former n@@ sa employee , sought by the us , made clear in an un@@ addressed letter that the green politici@@ an han@@ s-@@ christian str@@ ö@@ be@@ le sent to the us on friday after a meeting with snow@@ den and sent to the federal government .
the letter was written after a translation widely used by str@@ ö@@ be@@ le :
to the competent authorities
i have been asked to write to you about your inquiry into mass surveillance .
my name is ed@@ ward joseph snow@@ den and i was previously contrac@@ ted or directly employed as a technical expert at the national security agency .
as i work in these institutions , i have seen systematic violations of the law by my government , which have led me to act out of a moral duty .
as a result of the publication of these concerns , i have been subjec@@ ted to a serious and persi@@ stent h@@ ate that forced me to leave my family and my hom@@ eland .
i live in ex@@ ile and enjoy temporary asylum .
i am encouraged by the response to my political action , both in the us and elsewhere .
citizens around the world , and also senior officials - including the united states - have been making rev@@ el@@ ations about a system of all-@@ en@@ comp@@ ass@@ ing surveillance that nobody can account for as a service to the public .
this sp@@ ying rev@@ el@@ ations attrac@@ ted many proposals for new laws and directives that were based on the previously conce@@ aled abuse of public confidence .
the benefits to society from these findings are becoming increasingly clear , while the risks involved have been clearly conce@@ aled .
although the result of my efforts has been demonstr@@ ably positive , my government continues to treat dis@@ s@@ ens as a sta@@ un@@ ch and seeks to crimin@@ alise political expression and to prosecu@@ te it .
yet to speak the truth is not a crime .
i am confident that the united states government , with the support of the international community , will put an end to this harmful attitude .
i hope that , if i have resolved the difficulties of this humanitarian situation , i will be able to participate in the responsible investigation of the facts concerning the problems of the media , particularly in relation to truth and authentic@@ ity .
i look forward to a discussion with you in your country as soon as the situation is resolved and thank you for your efforts to respect international law , which protec@@ ts us all .
ed@@ ward snow@@ den testi@@ fies to the fact that han@@ s-@@ christian str@@ ö@@ be@@ le is a member of the han@@ s-@@ christian str@@ ö@@ be@@ le group .
kin@@ der@@ gar@@ ten has found a private buyer .
&quot; the building is in good hands &quot; , says w@@ inter@@ ling@@ en &apos;s may@@ or michael ma@@ i@@ er .
the former kin@@ der@@ gar@@ ten in the garden street has been sold to a private individual .
the local council approved the sale in its recent meeting in the non-@@ public part .
the building changed its owner at a &quot; reasonable &quot; price .
&quot; the community is satisfied , &quot; says ma@@ i@@ er .
the budget was set at eur 100 000 .
it is not yet clear how the new owner intends to use the former kin@@ der@@ gar@@ ten .
the may@@ or is right that w@@ inter@@ ling@@ en should take responsibility for the building before the winter to someone else and should not be held responsible for the entertainment of the house , such as heating , after the garden and watching .

report : obama campaign considered bi@@ den by h@@ ill@@ ary clin@@ ton to replace bi@@ den with h@@ ill@@ ary clin@@ ton .
president bar@@ ack obama ’ s clo@@ s@@ est advis@@ ers have kept secret , vice president jo@@ e bi@@ den , in 2012 , through h@@ ill@@ ary clin@@ ton , so the new york times .
the rev@@ el@@ ation is the most no@@ te@@ worthy surprise of the long-@@ awa@@ ited work of mark hal@@ per@@ in and john he@@ il@@ em@@ ann on the 2012 campaign , “ double down : game change ” 2012 .
the times is a copy of the upcoming book .
according to jon@@ a@@ than martin , the times ’ national political correspon@@ dent , the book thoroughly records the history of the efforts of leading campaign and white house staff , notably the former wh@@ ite@@ house ch@@ ai@@ red by the former white house chief of staff .
the potential change was a strictly guar@@ ded secret within the campaign infrastructure in chic@@ ago and in the o@@ val office .
only half a do@@ zen of the president ’ s clo@@ s@@ est advis@@ ers – including dal@@ ey , obama ’ s former campaign leader , j@@ im mess@@ ina , and the former white house ’ s senior advis@@ er , david ax@@ el@@ ro@@ d , and david .
in “ double down ” it is claimed that d@@ al@@ ey was at the fore@@ front of efforts to protect bi@@ den despite its “ close , personal relationship ” before it was eventually turned against such a move .
in an interview with martin dal@@ ey confirmed that the government had indeed considered using bi@@ ds by clin@@ ton .
“ i said a whole series of things that should be considered , and that was one of them , ” says dal@@ ey to the magazine .
it is worth re@@ member@@ ing that the president at the time had terrible po@@ ll figures , so we thought : “ for god ’ s sake , what are we doing ? ”
while d@@ al@@ ey described the investigations as “ due d@@ ili@@ gence , ” martin said to an@@ der@@ son co@@ op@@ er of c@@ n@@ n that during the campaign for re-@@ election there was considerable effort to find out if a new one was in place .
“ in campaigns not so much money is spent on surve@@ ys and focus groups if you do not think seriously about something , ” said martin on ac@@ 3@@ 60 .
but it is not clear whether obama knew that his team had an exchange .
martin said to c@@ n@@ n that he asked dal@@ ey whether his bo@@ ss at the time was aware of the potential change .
although dal@@ ey said that he did not believe that the president was “ aware of the possible change , ” the former chief of staff ad@@ mitted that it was “ possible ” that obama knew that he would .
martin added that “ double down ” is not a defini@@ tive answer to the question of whether the political expl@@ or@@ ations of obama ’ s desk have reached .
co@@ op@@ er asked martin if he seriously think obama did not know anything about the studies of whether to use bi@@ ds in the elections .
&quot; possible &quot; , martin rep@@ lied .
what happens on the way with my email ?
e-mail is actually called electronic letter .
was e-mail used in the design of the internet service as in the case of conventional mail techn@@ ically the secret of letters ?
in the design of early internet services , the emphasis was on making communication possible .
that is why the basic technical proto@@ col@@ s have not been careful to lay a firm foundation for a hear@@ ing-@@ safe exchange of letters .
therefore , a conventional e-mail correspon@@ ds to an open post@@ card rather than a se@@ aled letter .
if the user &quot; anna &quot; an &quot; b@@ en@@ ni sen@@ ds a mail , the computers of the two are then connected directly ?
the email program or the browser of anna sen@@ ds the mail to the mail server of your service provider in the first step .
for example , if you have a g@@ mail account , google would be .
this mail server sen@@ ds the content to the provider that uses b@@ en@@ ni .
on the track , the mail can be run over a number of other servers on the internet .
ben@@ ni@@ e can then call the content of his provider .
if conventional e-@@ ma@@ ils are read through the web ?
most ma@@ ils are sent by software robo@@ ts on the move .
the sen@@ der &apos;s provider usually checks whether the mail is a mal@@ icious program as an att@@ ach@@ ment .
the recei@@ ver systems also use a virus check .
furthermore , providers check whether it is a trou@@ bl@@ es@@ ome and un@@ wanted sp@@ am mail that is deleted immediately or at least converted into a sp@@ am folder .
if the robo@@ ts have yet another task ?
for systems like g@@ mail , the robo@@ t also determin@@ es the information google needs to place context advertising .
when anna and b@@ en@@ ni talk about their upcoming holiday trip via g@@ mail , google can provide links to holiday offers .
read the em@@ ail@@ s with unknown people too .
the like@@ li@@ hood that un@@ authorized persons will read an email is extremely small .
in theory , however , this is possible .
in companies , administr@@ ators often have the possibility to read electronic mail .
law enforcement agencies and intelligence agencies also have legal means of inter@@ cep@@ ting or notic@@ ing e-@@ ma@@ ils .
in addition , there are possible illegal dis@@ mis@@ s@@ al actions .
is it possible to protect e-@@ ma@@ ils against reading ?
encry@@ ption according to the open@@ p@@ g@@ p standard can encry@@ pt an email against reading .
with a high technical effort it is also possible to dis@@ gu@@ ise the met@@ ad@@ ata of an email communication , so that it is not even easy to recognize who communic@@ ated with whom .
how important are y@@ a@@ ho@@ o and google on the email market in germany ?
the most commonly used mail@@ boxes are y@@ a@@ ho@@ o and google , according to a survey by con@@ vi@@ os consulting , which dates back to august 2013 , only play a minor role .
while y@@ a@@ ho@@ o-@@ mail ’ s shares were last dro@@ pped , g@@ mail could increase significantly from google .
mother in the forest hi@@ des and reti@@ res pension .
when his be@@ ta@@ zed mother died , a man from wol@@ f@@ sburg for@@ ged a plan .
he bur@@ ied the dead in a forest - and continued to collect their pensions and care allow@@ ances .
to continue pension and care allow@@ ance , the commission has proposed a 6@@ 7-@@ year-@@ old wol@@ f@@ sburg mother to be found dead after police investigations in the forest .
first , he covered up the death of the 89 year-@@ old , then he spent the money for more than a year and a half .
now , the 67 year old must be responsible for fraud , as a speaker said on friday .
so the man hi@@ d the woman in a forest near hel@@ m@@ ste@@ dt .
the man was susp@@ ected already in may : at that time , it was clear that the nee@@ dy mother had no longer needed any medic@@ ation .
the investig@@ ators told the pen@@ sion@@ er that his mother had travell@@ ed to spain .
because the officials found this strange , they continued to investigate .
it emerged that the two have been working in a shared apartment for more than 15 years and he had recently maintained it .
the 67 year-@@ old finally ad@@ mitted the death of his mother .
according to the police , an ob@@ duc@@ tion did not give any evidence of a capital crime .
want to see ice cre@@ am sh@@ ining in the dark ?
a british entreprene@@ ur has the first g@@ low@@ ing ice in the dark – with the help of qu@@ als .
char@@ lie franc@@ is made the flu@@ o@@ res@@ cent properties of marine organis@@ ms to use and created a new le@@ an@@ ing space for the sea animals .
he got the idea after he had read a research on tor@@ ment and persu@@ aded chinese scientists to take the lu@@ min@@ ous prote@@ in arti@@ fici@@ ally .
the ice cre@@ am re@@ acts with the ton@@ gue when consum@@ ing , which reduces the ph value in the prote@@ in and tri@@ gg@@ ers the light .
chr@@ is explains that the ice cre@@ am respon@@ ds to the heat in the mouth and lu@@ min@@ air@@ e – the more you lic@@ k , the bri@@ ghter it becomes .
char@@ lie , founder of the ice cre@@ am company &quot; lic@@ k me i &apos;m delicious &quot; , says : &quot; the product is incredible , but still in a very early production phase , and so you get two gram@@ s for the first time .
the pro@@ ton used in the ice cre@@ am re@@ acts with the ton@@ gue in a neutral ph .
when the mouth warm the prote@@ in , the ph value increases and the ice sh@@ ines .
we have tested it over the last few months and it seemed ideal to us to use it on hal@@ lo@@ ween , because it is such wonderful lu@@ min@@ ai@@ res effect .
it is probably the most expensive ice cre@@ am i have ever made , because the tor@@ ch light is four times more expensive than gold .
every ball costs me about 1@@ 40 p@@ ounds .
but for that it tas@@ tes delicious .
char@@ lies experim@@ ental company based in bri@@ st@@ ol is famous for its unusual flav@@ ours , which include bi@@ er , cheese , cheese , beef and cheese .
but his latest creation is to become even more ambitious .
he says : “ i would like to develop an invi@@ sible ice cre@@ am . ”
this is impossible in itself because of the light break caused by the ice cryst@@ als , from which ice cre@@ am is made ; but i susp@@ ect we can find a way to do it .
the ice cre@@ am uses flu@@ o@@ res@@ cent properties of a tor@@ ch that is arti@@ fici@@ ally produced by chinese scientists .
the ts@@ v mor@@ sum is still un@@ touched after six days of play in the hand@@ ball league .
it is now the case that ing@@ o e@@ h@@ lers &apos; team will be coming to the der@@ by against the ts@@ v da@@ ver@@ den , who celebrated his first victory last weekend .
this game starts the season new for us .
&quot; i hope that we finally have our head free , &quot; e@@ h@@ ler &apos;s behavior gives himself optim@@ istic .
he has finally done so , except for the long-@@ time in@@ ju@@ red h@@ end@@ ri@@ k blo@@ h@@ me , his complete cad@@ re .
da@@ ver@@ den is also committed to speed games .
we must therefore keep our error rate low .
but it is primarily a question of increasing coverage , which is , in the last analysis , far from a certain impression .
the city of da@@ ver@@ den &apos;s co@@ ach thomas pan@@ it@@ z is far more relaxed after the first season &apos;s victory against n@@ ord@@ hor@@ n .
the game was , of course , a house number .
but that &apos;s why we &apos;re still far from the favorite , because everything can happen in the der@@ by .
however , pan@@ it@@ z now wants to prove in mor@@ sum to launch a series .
missing is jan@@ -@@ mal@@ ted jo@@ d@@ at .
for this purpose , the a-@@ you@@ th@@ ful jo@@ o@@ st wind@@ swe@@ et@@ ness , who has a double right to play at the a-@@ youth league li@@ gi@@ sts h@@ c bre@@ men , celebra@@ tes his season de@@ but .
if you are not hot in such a game , you should stay at home .
hal@@ lo@@ ween 2013 : in figures
when i was small , hal@@ lo@@ ween had something mag@@ ical .
my si@@ ster and i were allowed to eat s@@ wee@@ ts , stay late and dres@@ se us for the neighbourhood .
today i am more interested in hal@@ lo@@ ween .
i have not been prepared to move from my apartment to s@@ wee@@ ts for the last two years and i am sure i will not do so this year either .
but , according to the statistics , i am a black she@@ ep in terms of hal@@ lo@@ ween .
the majority of americans – 15@@ 8 million to be precise – celebrate hal@@ lo@@ ween this year , spending a total of $ 6.@@ 9 billion on c@@ and@@ y , cost@@ umes , and decor@@ ations , so the us president said .
one thing i can count on every hal@@ lo@@ ween then is the trend values .
the cost@@ umes will be about 1.@@ 2 billion of the $ 6.@@ 9 billion spent , according to the n@@ r@@ f .
this year , exciting un@@ ani@@ mated objects are the last cr@@ y .
women no longer need to wear sex@@ y clothes , they can now enjoy se@@ duc@@ tive food such as piz@@ za , ham@@ bur@@ gers or car@@ ro@@ ts .
as far as men are concerned , i expect a lot of z@@ om@@ b@@ ies thanks to the walking dead , and i bet that the d@@ af@@ t-@@ pun@@ k space men will put it in the inst@@ ag@@ ram fe@@ eds this year .
according to google , the most sought after cost@@ umes are z@@ om@@ b@@ ies , bat@@ man , pi@@ rates and wit@@ ches .
i susp@@ ect that there is nothing wrong with tradition .
we have our dogs dres@@ sed up last year and so i am surprised that we were not alone .
indeed , americans spend $ 3@@ 30 million this year on cost@@ umes of their pe@@ ts , according to the n@@ r@@ f .
these are a lot of hot dogs .
as far as c@@ and@@ y is concerned , we are not in@@ dul@@ g@@ ent .
americans will spend $ 1.@@ 9 billion this year , the ni@@ el@@ sen company says .
that is about 2@@ 70 million kil@@ o@@ gram@@ s of chocolate bars , lo@@ z@@ ers , c@@ and@@ y and rubber bar@@ re@@ ls .
so good news for the us department of trade , 41 million people who are living with the s@@ wee@@ ts or sau@@ res saying .
indeed , we will be producing more than 40 million kil@@ o@@ gram@@ s of chocolate for hal@@ lo@@ ween and – let us not fo@@ ol ourselves – eating .
the only thing we do not want to con@@ sume is the sweet c@@ and@@ y cor@@ n ; yet 15 million kil@@ o@@ gram@@ s of it are sold by hal@@ lo@@ ween , according to the national association of conf@@ ec@@ tion@@ ery manufacturers .
that is about nine billion gra@@ ins of ma@@ ize .
it is a myster@@ y that i have not yet been able to resolve .
nothing belongs more to hal@@ lo@@ ween than houses where it sp@@ its .
they have given great names such as “ terror behind the walls ” ( which is what is in a real prison , inci@@ dentally ) , “ ho@@ w@@ l-@@ o-@@ scre@@ am ” and “ the house of sho@@ ck ” .
there are indeed 1,@@ 200 officially recognised sp@@ uk@@ -@@ houses in the united states , which generate $ 500 million in revenue , according to america ha@@ un@@ ts , and that includes the wonderful photos on which you are currently sitting in p@@ ants .
but let us finally get to the pum@@ p@@ k@@ ins .
char@@ lie brown made us familiar with the big pum@@ p@@ k@@ in when we were children , and cutting a pum@@ p@@ k@@ in lan@@ ter@@ n is like decor@@ ating the christmas tree – something we have seen from a small age .
fortunately , the “ baby in pum@@ p@@ k@@ in ” trend began only last year thanks to p@@ interest , so most of us grew up with the pum@@ p@@ k@@ in stra@@ ps and not , to sit in it .
this year , americans will spend about $ 10@@ 6 million on pum@@ p@@ k@@ in , the us cen@@ sus bureau says .
the pum@@ p@@ k@@ in lan@@ ter@@ ns , slowly ro@@ tting in the front garden , probably origin@@ ated from il@@ lin@@ o@@ is , where this year was har@@ ves@@ ted 2@@ 45 million kil@@ o@@ gram@@ s of pum@@ p@@ k@@ in .
if you want to score right , call ti@@ m and sus@@ an ma@@ th@@ is@@ don in nap@@ a , california and cut something pretty .
the home brand in hel@@ bre@@ cht : rescue forces are co@@ ated cor@@ p@@ ses of cor@@ p@@ ses .
the fire department had to be in hel@@ bre@@ cht on late thursday evening .
a three-@@ family house in the cour@@ ty@@ ard begins the night to friday fire .
the rescue forces are a dec@@ ol@@ on@@ ised body from the house .
rescue forces have lost their lives in a fire in hel@@ bre@@ cht , a dec@@ ol@@ on@@ ised body in a three-@@ family house .
whether it is a resid@@ ent is still un@@ clear how a police spo@@ kes@@ man said in bay@@ re@@ u@@ th .
on the late thursday evening , it had been bur@@ ned on the ground floor of the house .
when the fire bri@@ g@@ ade arrived , the fl@@ ames struck out of a window .
the staff went into the apartment and found the cor@@ pse in a room .
this and another room were bur@@ ned out completely .
the entire ground floor was damaged .
all other residents were not at home during the fire , the police spo@@ kes@@ man continued .
the building was not hab@@ itable for the time being .
the exact cause of the fire was not clear at first .
germany &apos;s largest church has launched an off@@ ensive to fight for the profes@@ sion of pa@@ st@@ or .
background is a possible short@@ age of pri@@ ests : the ev@@ angel@@ ic@@ -@@ lu@@ ther@@ an church of han@@ over exp@@ ects that the number of people living in the region of 1,@@ 800 will increase .
for young people today , the profes@@ sion is very attractive and offers good prospects , said pa@@ st@@ or ma@@ this bur@@ fi@@ en ( 43 ) in con@@ vers@@ ation with the ev@@ angel@@ ical press service .
it is attractive to keep track of the work and daily rout@@ ine .
with bur@@ fi@@ a , the church of the state has built a pa@@ st@@ or in a full place for the first time to in@@ sp@@ ire young people for the study of the@@ ology .
at present , fewer and fewer young people are choosing to study the@@ ology after the ab@@ it@@ ur .
bur@@ fi@@ a is leading this back to the process of dec@@ on@@ struc@@ tion : &quot; god &apos;s voice is quiet , the world is l@@ oud &quot; .
the profes@@ sion was characterised by great freedom and diversity .
i am the master of my calendar and can focus on where i think it is important .
pa@@ st@@ ors could be very close to the people as a pa@@ st@@ or .
they earned as much as teachers and could live well on it .
certainly , in the free economy , more will be paid , but the@@ o@@ logi@@ ans would have a safe employ@@ er .
this is what is happening today , in the face of young people who are not only concerned with their care@@ ers , but also with a work that is full of meaning .
according to the local church , which has three quarters of lower sa@@ x@@ ony , some 60 pa@@ st@@ ors are currently reti@@ ring per year .
at the same time , about 40 gradu@@ ates of a the@@ ological study begin their vi@@ k@@ ari@@ at .
in spar@@ sely popu@@ lated periph@@ eral areas such as the res@@ in , the em@@ s@@ land or the w@@ end@@ land , it may be difficult to fill posts in the future .
bur@@ fi@@ en wants to organise study days for young people and also to invite cele@@ bri@@ ties to study the@@ ology .
the study of the@@ ology offers a broad education .
you can even become president of the federal republic .
land ro@@ ver r@@ ally series announced

the options range from rein@@ forced bra@@ kes , a service package with support for bow@@ l@@ er-@@ works mechan@@ ics and log@@ is@@ tical support to vehicle storage between events .
dre@@ w bow@@ ler , managing director of bow@@ ler motor@@ sport , explains : “ r@@ ally customers who belong to bow@@ ler have become changed . ”
they are not all experienced drivers , but people who are looking for exciting and advent@@ ur@@ ous , and for an accessible way to world-@@ class events .
we are pleased to be able to continue this path in partnership with land ro@@ ver and the m@@ sa and believe that the format opens up new possibilities for the various r@@ ally discipl@@ ines in the uk and abroad and to experience and in@@ dul@@ ge new friends .
we really enjoyed watching the def@@ en@@ der challenge car – that ’ s what it will be an enter@@ taining championship .

fire bri@@ g@@ ade to save a bit@@ ch that is 15 meters above the ground on a dangerous rock head .
co@@ ck@@ er@@ sp@@ ani@@ el bit@@ ch ru@@ by was out of the air after a minor traffic accident .
three days later , a wal@@ ker took her to her un@@ comfortable position in the quar@@ ry and discovered her in her un@@ comfortable position .
fire figh@@ ters ro@@ lled off on a rock wall and saved the dog from safe death .
the fire department managed to find a dog in safety that was on a 15@@ -@@ metr@@ e high lead in a rock wall .
the nine month old co@@ ck@@ er@@ sp@@ ani@@ el bit@@ ch ru@@ by was a member of the team after a road accident on sunday afternoon and survi@@ ved three days alone before she left a quar@@ ry on wednesday .
scot@@ t al@@ der@@ son , 25 , and his gir@@ l@@ friend bec@@ ky hall , 20 , who belongs to the dog , came to the quar@@ ry fla@@ pp@@ it in den@@ hol@@ me , west yor@@ k@@ sh@@ ire , to welcome ru@@ by again .
they had desper@@ ately looked for their missing bit@@ ch and asked for help in social networks .
around 14 : 15 p.m. on wednesday , a wal@@ ker who had left his dog saw the hun@@ ted be@@ aten ru@@ by on the 15@@ -@@ metr@@ e high paragraph in quar@@ ry .
the cle@@ ck@@ hec@@ k@@ he@@ at@@ on fire station e@@ jec@@ tion technical rescue team rus@@ hed to the place and ro@@ lled to rescue rub@@ ies , which were then bur@@ ied in a dog box .
and@@ y cla@@ y@@ ton , specialist of the technical rescue team , said : “ she was in a dangerous situation .
it was located in the middle of the rock wall – 15 meters from the top and the ground .
she did not move mus@@ cles during her rescue – she was as sti@@ ff@@ ly fro@@ zen .
but now it is doing well .
she then took a few dog ca@@ kes .
this was a rather unusual effort .
the fact that the dog was discovered is incredible .
peter la@@ u , specialist in the technical rescue team , said : “ ru@@ by had a huge accident . ”
there was a possibility that it was seriously in@@ ju@@ red or worse .
ru@@ by was brought to the ve@@ t for investigation , but he was not de@@ hy@@ dr@@ ation or de@@ hy@@ dr@@ ation .
bec@@ ky hall from h@@ ali@@ fax , west yor@@ k@@ sh@@ ire said : “ to watch the rescue was fri@@ ghten@@ ing . ”
i could not believe that she was really up there .
it was wonderful to keep them back in the poor .
the veter@@ in@@ arian explained that if exhaus@@ tion became too large and it had collap@@ sed , it would probably have fallen .
the fire@@ figh@@ ters have done a great job .
what they did was really cour@@ ageous .
we are simply so grateful and each of them was absolutely incredible .
scot@@ t al@@ der@@ son from ke@@ i@@ gh@@ ley added : “ we were afraid that it would fall down , but she stayed up . ”
the fire@@ men were great .
i can hardly believe where it was .
mic@@ k j@@ ag@@ ger explains that he never made k@@ ary per@@ ry when she was 18 .
in an interview with an austr@@ ali@@ an radio station this week , the pop star said that she was playing as a background sing@@ er at j@@ ag@@ gers ’ song “ old hab@@ its the hard ” from 2004 .
per@@ ry explained that she had spent dinner with the al@@ tro@@ ck@@ er , and that “ he dre@@ w me when i was 18 ” .
she added : “ it ’ s been a long time ago and he was very kind to me . ”
in a statement , a representative of j@@ ag@@ gers , 70 , said on thursday that he was “ categ@@ or@@ ically den@@ ying that he had ever made attempts to bring things closer to kat@@ y per@@ ry . ”
the representative added : “ perhaps she conf@@ used him with someone else . ”
per@@ ry was one of the sing@@ ers who played at the ro@@ l@@ ling st@@ ones tour this year .
her new album “ pris@@ m ” was released in the first place this week .
george ke@@ rev@@ an : european un@@ bun@@ d@@ ling gives sco@@ ts the choice
a new day , a new story of terror for independence .
this time we are war@@ ned that an independent scotland is needed to join the schengen area as a condition for eu membership .
this is the key word for stories about pass@@ port controls in ber@@ w@@ ick and a st@@ ack@@ -@@ and-@@ wire border along the h@@ adri@@ an wall .
in fact , the stra@@ th@@ cl@@ y@@ de proposal pointed out the possible economic benefits that could mean more freedom of travel in the rest of europe , but , as expected , this was in the head@@ lines .
nor has anyone mentioned that eu member states often have to comply with their strict rules when they are more favourable to them .
since scotland is not currently a member of the schengen area , continued non-@@ compliance with brussels would be only a small conc@@ ession in exchange for what it really wants to get from the sco@@ ts .
so , really not a story .
and one that has already come in the years that they already gli@@ de like a fo@@ ssi@@ l : for the first time i have called the “ independence means pass@@ port controls ” -@@ duc@@ k at least 40 years ago .
one interesting point is the constant repe@@ ti@@ tion of this ancient story .
why should we expect an independent scotland to have a european pi@@ pe ?
why the london yo@@ ke against the brussels one , especially now ?
these are the real european news : the great post-@@ war plan to un@@ ite europe has st@@ alled .
the euro crisis officially killed the european project .
across the eu , parties are gaining ground that are anti-@@ eu or that want to throw the euro out as a single currency .
even in germany , the euro@@ s@@ cep@@ tic party could create alternative for germany – only this year – just under five million votes in the september election .
there has always been domestic opposition to the plan to create a federal europe .
the current economic crisis , however , is turning out to be a turning point .
the political and economic sanctions imposed by berlin and the european central bank , in conjunction with the stra@@ it@@ jack@@ et into which the national economy is bound by the maintenance of the single currency , have forced many people to think that the project is far off .
the crisis in the euro has little to do with national governments running excessive budget deficits – only in greece .
instead , the euro@@ system has ti@@ ed its members to exchange rates , which are beneficial to german ex@@ porters – and that is what german politicians would like to leave .
without the possibility of de@@ valu@@ ation of the local currency , southern europe will find itself with a buil@@ t-@@ in productivity dis@@ advantage over germany .
the only way is to cut wages and public spending – sp@@ ur@@ red on by berlin .
behind the current fiscal and monetary problems lies a de@@ eper european productivity deficit .
as a result of the “ green ” energy directives imposed by brussels – a code for the subsid@@ isation of french and german energy companies at the expense of consumers – european industry pays a price compared to the united states .
this is a cri@@ p@@ pling cost dis@@ advantage , as we have seen in gran@@ g@@ om@@ ou@@ th .
all wage fix@@ ing in the world does not protect the european petro@@ chemical industry from being hit by cheap american sh@@ ale gas .
as a result , a re@@ vol@@ t is rising , especially in france , the former eu che@@ er@@ leader .
after the war , france ’ s political elite saw the eu as a vehicle to use to b@@ low germany and to build paris on an equal foot@@ ing with washington .
but berlin no longer needs paris as a ga@@ te@@ way to political legitimacy , and has pus@@ hed europe ’ s own economic policy , which has been a struggle for the failing french economy .
the result : marine le p@@ ens ’ right-@@ wing , anti-@@ eu front national has just won a decisive election , thus bringing the ruling socialists to the top three .
the national front is now the most popular party in france , with 24 % of the vote – a timely warning to the british labour party that it is not likely to accept a split in the right .
what makes le pen with its newly won popul@@ arity among the white french working class ?
it wants to use next year &apos;s eu elections to create an anti-@@ eu anti-@@ community monetary blo@@ c in the european parliament .
if the anti-@@ eu parties do well in these elections – and this is very possible – then for the first time such a blo@@ c could domin@@ ate the european parliament .
that is the point i want to make : in the not too dist@@ ant future , the growing res@@ ent@@ ment against the eu and the single currency will come together to abol@@ ish the euro .
the eu will not dis@@ appear , but it will be more like the “ europe of ( sovereign ) nations , ” general de ga@@ ul@@ le fav@@ ored .
germany and some of its sa@@ tel@@ li@@ tes may hold on to the euro , but france and southern europe will return to their own curren@@ cies .
i expect britain to distance itself from this project in the hope of appe@@ aling to the us .
but washington ’ s growing interest in the pacific suggests that britain alone will be in the atlantic rain .
where is scotland in all this ?
we can decide to create a region of ( last in consequence ) small england .
or we can defend our own economic interests – including , to say , berlin and brussels what they can be st@@ uck in .
i susp@@ ect that scotland could be in a loo@@ ser european union if we were to use our own currency .
cooperation with other similar countries is not a feder@@ alist europe of nations .
otherwise , we should consider sharing norway &apos;s responsibility and maintaining our economic independence .
the sn@@ p government in scotland is – remark@@ ably – the most successful political movement against the au@@ ster@@ ity policies in europe , and has made a spectacular majority in 2011 , by rejec@@ ting the proposed ( and made ) cuts .
it would be ri@@ dic@@ ulous for scotland to decide now for independence only to be able to demand savings from berlin and brussels .
early pub@@ er@@ ty : growing faster , the growth of the body is faster , and the growth of the body is faster .
a@@ fro@@ -@@ american and h@@ is@@ pan@@ ic girls tend to reach pub@@ er@@ ty rather than their white pe@@ ers , as studies show .
physical changes do not directly imp@@ ly pub@@ er@@ ty , but are not yet immediately ad@@ ul@@ ter@@ ated .
there is no evidence that hor@@ mon@@ es or other chemicals are responsible for the disease .
experts believe that the ep@@ ide@@ mic ob@@ es@@ ity is a tri@@ gger of early pub@@ er@@ ty .
the trend towards early pub@@ er@@ ty is less pron@@ oun@@ ced among young people and is less pron@@ oun@@ ced in young people .
the former c@@ n@@ n correspon@@ dent p@@ at e@@ ther@@ id@@ ge is a journ@@ alist who speci@@ ali@@ zes in child health and family issues .
if a mother is concerned when her daughter is already seven or eight years old , she is growing bre@@ asts and sh@@ am@@ ha@@ irs ?
at the annual conference of the american ac@@ ade@@ my of pe@@ dic@@ u@@ le association , this week in or@@ lan@@ do , fl@@ ori@@ da , the pa@@ edi@@ at@@ ric en@@ do@@ cr@@ ine expert explained dr. paul ka@@ p@@ lo@@ v@@ nik .
“ i spend a lot of time re@@ ass@@ uring parents – normally this is not a sign that the pu@@ ber@@ ity is now rapidly becoming apparent , ” k@@ ap@@ lo@@ wit@@ z explained .
obvious indic@@ ations of development , such as growing bre@@ asts , sh@@ am@@ - and ax@@ le hair , as well as body sm@@ ell , are visible earlier in girls .
however , there was only a s@@ light shift in the age of the men@@ ar@@ che ( the first ble@@ eding occurs ) in the last 40 years .
in the united states , the average age is 12.@@ 5 years , slightly less than 12.@@ 75 in 197@@ 0 .
“ when the bre@@ asts develop , it takes at least two to three years to reach the men@@ ar@@ che , ” k@@ ap@@ lo@@ wit@@ z said , also author of the book “ early pub@@ er@@ ty for girls : the essential advis@@ or .
time is the most accurate test of how pub@@ er@@ ty progres@@ ses .
it is controversial what actually marked the beginning of pub@@ er@@ ty , but it is important to “ anticip@@ ate ” the bre@@ ast enlargement of a growth tra@@ p before an age of eight years .
in most cases , the process or stag@@ n@@ ant – something that a child doctor has to monitor closely .
if progress is made more quickly , tests by en@@ di@@ k@@ ron@@ o@@ log@@ ist could be indicated to prevent serious problems such as t@@ um@@ ours or cy@@ sts .
there are treatments for dela@@ ying an early men@@ stru@@ ation and defense of another consequence : the pre@@ mature ag@@ eing of the b@@ ones , the ultimate in the growth impe@@ di@@ ment and thus cl@@ ou@@ ds .
the recommendations for medic@@ ation or hor@@ mon@@ al therapy are based on the age of the child , the speed of development , the rate of growth and the emo@@ tional mat@@ ur@@ ity .
psycho@@ social aspects are also important .
k@@ ap@@ lo@@ wit@@ z is cau@@ tious in terms of medic@@ ation , but he ad@@ mits : “ sup@@ pressing pub@@ er@@ ty can cause behavi@@ oral problems and the feel@@ ings of girls , unlike their pe@@ ers .
the other major problem is understand@@ able : parents simply do not want their very young dau@@ gh@@ ters to have the period .
&quot; they worry about the risk of pregn@@ ancy or about how to improve the hygi@@ en@@ ic side , &quot; k@@ ap@@ lo@@ wit@@ z said .
“ it was a sho@@ ck , ” rec@@ alls a woman whose daughter was given her days with ten .
even though there were initial signs and we had talked about men@@ stru@@ ation , it was not emo@@ tionally prepared .
she was fri@@ ghten@@ ed and ex@@ ci@@ ted by the school to come home because she was the first in her friends circle .
there are many widely public@@ ized the@@ ories about the causes of early pub@@ er@@ ty .
but there is no conclu@@ sive evidence that hor@@ mon@@ es are produced in milk or other food , chemicals in the environment or sexual health .
bo@@ ys come into pub@@ er@@ ty in the past , similar to girls .
k@@ ap@@ lo@@ wit@@ z believes that the most comp@@ elling pre@@ mise is the ep@@ ide@@ mic of ob@@ es@@ ity .
he supported the implementation of a study in 2001 on girls aged six to nine , which established a connection between body f@@ at and entering the pub@@ er@@ ty .
other studies support this conclusion , but there are many other factors that have played a role .
in this country , afric@@ an-@@ american and h@@ is@@ pan@@ ic girls tend to reach pub@@ er@@ ty rather than their white pe@@ ers .
there are different explanations for this .
global seems to have an early pub@@ er@@ ty of all kinds influenced by economic conditions , climate , gen@@ es .
another myster@@ y : although bo@@ ys have been able to use fac@@ ial and sh@@ am@@ an hair before , the trend towards a full-@@ scale earlier pub@@ er@@ ty is not as marked as in girls .
other doctors at the a@@ ap conference stressed the complexity of the issue .
the appearance of ac@@ ne and sh@@ am@@ ha@@ ar is not common even among bab@@ ies and inf@@ ants .
“ we must be careful how we can prevent the true beginning of pub@@ er@@ ty , ” said dr. law@@ rence sil@@ ver@@ man , a pa@@ edi@@ at@@ ric en@@ do@@ cr@@ in@@ o@@ log@@ ist at gor@@ ye@@ b children .
parents should not hesitate to consult their pedi@@ at@@ r@@ ici@@ an about how to talk to their child .
“ this may mean that you have to talk earlier than expected , ” k@@ ap@@ lo@@ wit@@ z said .

girls who fl@@ our@@ ish early need the insurance that the process is a normal part of life , even if it is earlier than intended .
jum@@ bo manufacturers argue against the need to reduce the se@@ ating width of their cars in the face of large orders .
it has become a dispute between leading aircraft manufacturers over the width of seats in the tourist class with long-@@ hau@@ l flights , which is the tone for a bit@@ ter col@@ li@@ sion on the du@@ ba@@ i air@@ show this month .
the dispute is about the seat width , the passenger &apos;s seat width on long flights in the tourist class – not always those to whom the flight is best addressed .
airbus this week called for an industry standard that would allow a seat width of at least 46 cm ( 18 in@@ ches ) in the tourist class , but the us arch@@ ery council was not able to agree .
the dispute comes at a time when the aircraft buil@@ ders are compe@@ ting to produce even larger versions of their two-@@ engine long-@@ range aircraft .
like the re@@ ar part of the aircraft is designed – especially if it is series with nine or ten seats – is crucial for the economic results indicated , which are the new “ mini jum@@ bo ” design .
bo@@ eing claims that its modern@@ ised 7@@ 7@@ x ke@@ g 4@@ 06 seats 4@@ 06 people in the tourist class , which has 17 in@@ ch wide and thus has ten per row .
airbus decla@@ res that the compe@@ ting version of the a3@@ 50 carri@@ es 3@@ 50 people in 18 in@@ ch wide seats in the tourist class , with nine per row .
aircraft gi@@ ants often share the highest level of technical details through advertising in the press .
now , airbus appe@@ als before the du@@ ba@@ i air@@ show , where the 7@@ 7@@ x with over 100 orders is expected to make the race , directly to the public .
recently , the company presented an ad that marks the beginning of a new advertising war and gives a picture to the don@@ ors that brought three people together in a restaurant .
“ bo@@ eing is proposing long-@@ hau@@ l flights in seats that are more closely ti@@ ed to regional tur@@ bo pro@@ ps , ” says airbus ’ chief sales officer , john lea@@ h@@ y .
given changes in eating hab@@ its , people will become th@@ ick@@ er , but aircraft seats have not changed rad@@ ically .
between the early 197@@ 0 ’ s , when the bo@@ eing 7@@ 47 defined the modern long-@@ distance journey , and the end of the century , the weight of the male average american has increased from 40 to 49 years .
the wa@@ ist size of the male average american in the 21st century is about 10@@ 0.@@ 8 cm according to us health statistics .
airbus says that its ri@@ val is following a se@@ ating concept from the 195@@ 0s , when the average body size of the newly b@@ ap@@ tiz@@ ed “ jet set ” was nar@@ ro@@ wer .
according to airbus , investigations have been carried out to show that an additional customs ( 2.@@ 54 cm ) per seat would reduce the sleep quality by 53 % .
bo@@ eing den@@ ies the numbers of airbus in terms of the se@@ ating and says that it is not at the discre@@ tion of the manufacturers to decide how airlines will maintain the balance between fa@@ res and equipment .
the company also explains that according to studies the experience on the aircraft is more than the width of the seat .
“ it really is about giving airlines flexibility so that they can do what they think they need to do in order to be successful , ” explains the airline cab@@ in expert .
you do not want us to dict@@ ate what makes you prof@@ itable .
you know your business better than anyone else .
passengers are concerned with greater el@@ bo@@ w freedom , but for manufacturers , it will increasingly be a subject that relates to sales .
behind the contest there is a race for aircraft orders with an estimated volume of at least $ 700 billion at list prices in the coming decades , which will have a lasting impact on the us or europe &apos;s export balance .
as re@@ u@@ ters reported for the first time in july , the seat layout is the driving force behind the battle for the new je@@ ts .
both airbus and bo@@ eing are claim@@ ing 20 % more efficiency per seat with their latest tw@@ in-@@ engine long-@@ range designs than the market leader in this segment , which is the 3@@ 65 se@@ ater bo@@ eing 7@@ 7-@@ 3@@ 00@@ er .
the statements made by bo@@ eing on the results are partly dependent on the 7@@ 7@@ x being equipped with the original design of nine seats in the 7@@ 77 seats per row .
the increased cost per unit is still lower than that of currently used machines with ten seats per row .
“ bo@@ eing is therefore squ@@ ee@@ zing more seats into its aircraft to make it more competitive with our products , ” says k@@ ev@@ in ken@@ i@@ ston , head of passenger comfort at the european airbus .
on the other hand , analy@@ sts say full cab@@ ins with ten seats per row at existing 7@@ 7@@ s indicate that many passengers are in favour of closer arrangement , which would mean cheaper fa@@ res .
“ eigh@@ teen in@@ ch seat width would be great for passengers , but the reality is that from an economic point of view , the airbus offer is threatened by the 7@@ 7@@ 7-@@ 200 threat . ”
airbus and bo@@ eing do not offer seats , but a catalogue of suppliers from which the airlines can choose .
the world travel@@ ers jet sel@@ lers even carry band@@ width with them to help the equipment in the competition .
even if you p@@ raise comfort , all manufacturers offer high-@@ speed , high-@@ den@@ sity je@@ ts .
airbus offers a ten@@ -@@ se@@ ater a3@@ 50 , but it has not yet sold it .
until recently , airbus stressed the importance of greater cab@@ in adap@@ tability and of broad@@ ening seats for some jet &apos;s passenger seats .
without the support of the only other manufacturer of large modern je@@ ts , experts say that the call for a new industry standard is likely to be pu@@ ff@@ ed , but the wave of 7@@ 7@@ x sales could be di@@ str@@ acted .
new anti-@@ nic@@ ot@@ ine vacc@@ ine could give the pleasure of smoking a boost .
scientists have taken an anti-@@ nic@@ ot@@ ine vacc@@ ine that will increase the fun of smoking .
a single do@@ se of the vacc@@ ine has been able to protect m@@ ice from smoking for a life@@ time .
before testing on humans , further tests are needed , which may take some years , but professor ron@@ ald crystal of we@@ ill cor@@ n@@ ell medical college has been working in new york to explain the first results .
“ we are very hope@@ ful that this kind of vacc@@ ination strategy will help millions of smo@@ kers who have tried to stop and will be able to use all the methods available on the market , but have had to see their ni@@ kon d@@ ust .
the new vacc@@ ine contains a harm@@ less virus that has been modified to contain genetic information on the production of nic@@ ot@@ ine anti@@ bodies .
the virus selec@@ tively inf@@ ects the li@@ ver cells , which then produce a constant stream of anti@@ bodies .
the anti@@ bodies hun@@ t the nic@@ ot@@ ine mo@@ lec@@ ules in the blood and neutr@@ alize them before they can spread the brain , thus creating a smo@@ ker no nic@@ ot@@ ine high .
in tri@@ als vacc@@ inated m@@ ice , which were ad@@ min@@ istered nic@@ ot@@ ine , maintained their normal level of activity .
m@@ ice without vacc@@ ination , on the other hand , would have taken a “ time out , ” the researchers declared , a sign that nic@@ ot@@ ine has reached its brain .
the experim@@ ents are described in the journal science trans@@ la@@ tional medicine .
earlier tobacco vacc@@ ines failed because they had anti@@ bodies and were not vacc@@ inated .
vacc@@ inations had to be used to maintain the anti@@ body level as often as they were expensive and un@@ practical .
but the cost of the new vacc@@ ine is probably much lower , because it trans@@ forms li@@ ver cells into anti@@ body fac@@ tories .
as professor crystal said , a future vacc@@ ine for people who are not very sure about whether they are ad@@ min@@ istered could be used before they are temp@@ ted to give a ci@@ gare@@ tte .
but it is more likely that smo@@ kers will use it to stop .
&quot; you know , then : if you start smoking again , you feel a lot of pain because of the nic@@ ot@@ ine vacc@@ ine , and that helps you to get rid of your hab@@ it , &quot; he explains .
british scientists have said that the results are interesting , but at the same time war@@ ned that further research is needed .
tri@@ po@@ di argu@@ es that o@@ be@@ id has influenced his work to be a part of the world .
against the former labour party minister jo@@ e tri@@ po@@ di of new south wal@@ es , an investigation by the government corruption authorities is being initiated .
the former n@@ s@@ w minister den@@ ies that the maritime packaging regulations are being revised at the request of his political ment@@ or , ed@@ die o@@ be@@ id , the conce@@ aled share@@ holding on three land at the state@@ -@@ controlled level .
the independent commission ag@@ a@@ in@@ st corruption commission ( i@@ ac@@ s ) is an independent commission for corruption and has published its investigations on friday on the question of whether o@@ be@@ id is a different state minister .
now , the acc@@ us@@ ation is being made that tri@@ po@@ di had been led by o@@ be@@ id &apos;s hidden interest in the land after tri@@ po@@ di &apos;s former depu@@ ty secretary general was appointed ly@@ n@@ ne ash@@ ram .
in years of talks , which began in 2005 , the government had respon@@ ded to public tend@@ ers for le@@ ase contracts .
the pa@@ ed@@ ors were opposed to this and also wanted longer mat@@ ur@@ ities .
in 2009 , the le@@ ase contracts for the companies were signed on the circu@@ lar qu@@ ay , which ann@@ ually brought the o@@ be@@ ids $ 2.5 million , without any public ten@@ der .
tri@@ po@@ di , who was minister for ports from february 2006 to november 2009 , was originally in favour of public tend@@ ers .
but he resi@@ sted making the changes at o@@ be@@ id ’ s request , who , as tri@@ po@@ di confirmed , insi@@ sted on a re@@ design of government le@@ ase regulations .
one of the ic@@ ac telephone records showed talks from august and september 2007 between o@@ be@@ id , tri@@ po@@ di and ste@@ ve dun@@ n , a senior official who was sent to the port ministry , after he had been under o@@ be@@ id .
“ was the issue discussed in these telephone conver@@ sa@@ tions the development of commercial packaging regulations ? ” , the depu@@ ty commissioner asked an@@ th@@ ony k@@ ro@@ e@@ ber .
&quot; no &quot; , rep@@ lied tri@@ po@@ di .
i cannot remember what was discussed , but that was definitely not the case .
definitely not between me and mr o@@ be@@ id .
israeli figh@@ ter plan@@ es are targe@@ ting syria , according to official sources , and according to israel ’ s sources , they are targe@@ ting the country , according to official sources .
israeli figh@@ ters could have set a target in the sy@@ ri@@ an port of lat@@ ak@@ ia on thursday night , confirmed a senior government official ’ s opposition to fox news .
the official did not explain what the objective was , but said that it was at least one .
according to associ@@ ated press , the goal was russian sa@@ -@@ 12@@ 5 missi@@ les .
at least twice this year , israel has already delivered air stri@@ kes on missi@@ le supplies in syria .
foreign workers with 4@@ 5@@ 7-@@ vis@@ as could be subjec@@ ted to ‘ real-@@ estate ’ tests , which would be a good idea .
the government is thinking about a “ real-@@ estate test ” for foreign workers of 4@@ 5@@ 7-@@ vis@@ as as as part of expanded measures .
if the test were to be introduced , it would be a criteri@@ on for preventing the 4@@ 57 from being used as a recru@@ it@@ ment or a back door for the entry of family and friends into australia .
today , a government proposal for discussion was published after the former labour party me@@ p , max@@ ine m@@ c@@ ke@@ w , had read the government &apos;s comments on foreign workers .
“ l@@ oud explanations such as foreign@@ ers should sit back in the back , ” and , austr@@ ali@@ ans first set , “ is a very un@@ pleasant back@@ sli@@ de in times when trade unions were demanding a protected labour market , ” said australia today .
histor@@ ically , this meant that white workers should be protected – and if some in the region have an echo of this historical arti@@ fact , then that is the way i would not be surprised .
the proposal for discussion out@@ lines 12 measures that were once proposed by the former minister for immigration , chr@@ is bow@@ en .
minister of immigration , bren@@ dan o &apos;@@ con@@ nor , who spoke yesterday about human trafficking in s@@ ri lan@@ ka , has mentioned five of the recommended changes , which other countries will have considered .
if the &apos; criteri@@ on of authentic@@ ity &apos; is adopted , then someone who applied for a visa could be checked to see whether &apos; the application is in the real case , in which the applicant is in the visa &apos; s case .
firms could also be obliged to account for the number of 4@@ 57 visa holders after the elections in the past have been held by companies that initially had only a small number of workers , eventually hundreds .
meanwhile , a 3@@ 5-@@ year-@@ old s@@ ri lan@@ k@@ an asylum see@@ ker probably died in a heart attack after he was killed with a refugee boat on the christmas eve island this week .
the distur@@ bed n@@ in@@ e-@@ year-@@ old son of the man who had come with him to australia , has been arrested since the death of his father on wednesday by an adult c@@ ous@@ in , who was also on the boat .
austr@@ ali@@ an authorities brought the man to the christmas island hospital where he died .
the british government announced a study which would highlight the benefits of the h@@ s@@ 2 rail project for scotland .
in the work of h@@ s@@ 2 ltd it is proposed to create a new high speed internet connection between scotland and scotland from the beginning of phase 1 in 20@@ 26 .
transport minister bar@@ on@@ ess k@@ ram@@ er said that the project “ will bring britain closer together ” .
the scot@@ tish transport minister , ke@@ ith brown , said that he was very pleased to work with the british government on this plan .
phase 1 consists of a new high-@@ speed rail link between london and the west mid@@ lands .
after phase 2 is completed , there will be connections to man@@ ch@@ ester and le@@ eds .
in june , the government correc@@ ted the estimated costs of building the high-@@ speed road between london and n@@ ord@@ eng@@ land of £ 3@@ 2.@@ 7 billion to £ 4@@ 2.@@ 6 billion .
the british government , which is in talks with transport scotland , has commission@@ ed h@@ s@@ 2 ltd to seek further capacity and improved travel times for n@@ ord@@ en@@ g@@ land and scotland .
this includes the possibility of a travel time of finally three hours or less from gl@@ as@@ go@@ w and ed@@ in@@ burgh to london .
bar@@ on@@ ess k@@ ram@@ er said : “ our goal for h@@ s@@ 2 is a truly national network of routes that brings britain and its cities closer together . ”
we are making progress with h@@ s@@ 2 because it brings enormous benefits .
without it , we are facing a capacity crisis in our rail network .
but it is also about the link between 18 british cities , including gl@@ as@@ go@@ w and ed@@ in@@ burgh , which is being improved thanks to h@@ s@@ 2 .
the scot@@ tish secretary of state , ali@@ sta@@ ir car@@ michael , comm@@ ented : “ today ’ s announcement is good news for scotland . ”
on behalf of the scot@@ tish government , ke@@ ith brown car@@ michael called for a “ un@@ equi@@ vo@@ cal ” commitment to the h@@ s@@ 2 network .
brown said , “ the high-@@ speed rail link has the potential of enormous economic benefits for scotland , while at the same time providing scotland ’ s economic power an argument for fast rail links throughout the uk . ”
we are therefore pleased to work as a partner of the british government and to improve the options for high-@@ speed rail links in scotland , which will bring benefits to everyone and make the gl@@ as@@ go@@ w-@@ ed@@ in@@ burgh link , which is the government .
i look forward to discussing the report of inquiry with the british ministers next year and to working together to decide on the next steps .
rules on electronic equipment in aer@@ op@@ lan@@ es remain provi@@ sion@@ ally in force in australia .
austr@@ ali@@ an air passengers must continue to use tab@@ lets and smar@@ t@@ phones when they start and land , despite efforts in the us to improve the rules for such devices .
the us federal aviation administration ( fa@@ a ) allows us airlines to meet their requirements , so that passengers can be on their machines while critical flight ph@@ ases e-@@ books , watch videos or play videos , provided they are in the “ air ” mode .
during most of the flight , passengers are already allowed to do so , but many people find it an@@ no@@ ying that they are losing their e-@@ books when they start and land .
austr@@ ali@@ an societies are watching the decision to be taken by us airlines to do a lot of work in implementing them , but are not planning to change their rules directly .
casa , the air traffic control authority , also stated that it would look at the announcement , but stressed that the restrictions on the use of electronic equipment in critical flight ph@@ ases in australia still apply .
“ casa has no specific regulations regarding the use of electronic equipment on the aircraft at the moment , ” was announced .
this issue is governed by provisions that allow airlines to maintain safety at all times and allow passengers to use the safety instructions given by cab@@ in crew .
vir@@ gin has already started discussions with casa to extend its wi-fi entertainment program .
“ we would welcome a review of the approval of electronic equipment by casa , because we are convinced that this would improve the customer experience after we have ( wireless inter@@ connection ) been in use during the flight , ” said one .
q@@ ant@@ as explained that you will remain with the current rules until further notice .
“ our current guidelines provide that electronic devices can not be used at star@@ tup and lan@@ ding , and we currently have no plans to change this , ” the company declared .
the fa@@ a rules apply to us airlines .
however , we are always interested in regulatory developments that can benefit passengers and will be followed by the fa@@ a decision and the reasons behind it .
the decision has an impact on us companies depending on the age of the fleet .
they must prove that their aircraft are toler@@ ating the radio distur@@ ban@@ ces caused by mobile devices , and manu@@ als , training materials , hand bag@@ gage programs and customer instruc@@ tion can change .
“ after an airline has confirmed the tolerance of its fleet , it can make it easier for passengers to use port@@ able , eas@@ y-@@ to-@@ use electronic devices such as tab@@ lets , e-@@ book read@@ ers and smart phones at any height , ” he announced .
in rare cases , when the crew is in a bad light , the passengers will instruc@@ t them to switch off the equipment during lan@@ ding .
the group also recommended that he@@ avi@@ er devices be safe@@ ly placed under the seat or in the com@@ part@@ ment over the seats when starting and lan@@ ding .
before the &quot; sch@@ al@@ ke &quot; re@@ vers@@ al , the b@@ v@@ b tra@@ il@@ ers with lu@@ min@@ ous missi@@ les had travel@@ ed to the vel@@ t@@ ins arena .
bor@@ us@@ sia dor@@ t@@ mun@@ d subsequently announced tough consequences .
before the friday match of the bun@@ des@@ lig@@ a against the v@@ f@@ b stutt@@ gart , the ul@@ tr@@ as respon@@ ded with a silence - first .
it was an un@@ familiar , almost g@@ ho@@ stly ac@@ ous@@ tics , which were still un@@ heard of by the vie@@ wer until shortly before the bun@@ des@@ lig@@ a was launched between the german vice champi@@ on bor@@ us@@ sia dor@@ t@@ mun@@ d and v@@ m .
the hotel was very clean and the staff were very friendly and helpful .
the southern gallery , on the other hand , where the most loy@@ al - and l@@ oud - fans of b@@ v@@ b were standing , initially presented themselves excep@@ tionally qui@@ e@@ tly : no songs , no batt@@ le@@ grounds .
the po@@ dium of cap@@ o , which otherwise coordin@@ ates joint fi@@ re-@@ fighting , remained un@@ filled .
and at the front of the gallery , lon@@ ely thre@@ w a great flag with a title &quot; section ban &quot; .
only as go@@ al@@ ke@@ eper roman wil@@ low f@@ ell@@ er as always first b@@ v@@ b player entered the course , bro@@ ke up short-term che@@ er@@ ful .
when his team colleagues followed , there were vo@@ cal and w@@ re@@ t@@ ched scar@@ ves - but not everywhere .
in the central blocks 12 and 13 of the southern grand@@ stand , nothing was sti@@ r@@ ring .
the fact that sta@@ dium speakers nor@@ bert dic@@ kel once again took advantage of the positive experiences of the last few days - der@@ by@@ sie@@ g , victory over ar@@ sen@@ al , extension of the contract by tra@@ iner j@@ ür@@ gen k@@ lo@@ p@@ p .
only five minutes before the start of the attack the cap@@ o er@@ up@@ ted his po@@ dium - and the po@@ dium was almost with hands .
finally , as always , the southern gallery was the turn - and finally here was again the lou@@ dest place in the sta@@ dium .
and at the latest as with a touch from the southern grand@@ stand the lou@@ dly call &quot; der@@ by@@ sie@@ ger stands up &quot; , everything was as always .
the silence before that was probably a response to what has happened in recent days .
just before the rivi@@ er@@ by at f@@ c sch@@ al@@ ke 04 , some of the tr@@ uck drivers had b@@ v@@ b be@@ am@@ ers in the audience ran@@ ks and placed in the square - and almost tor@@ hat .
the game was lost due to the cha@@ otic scenes be@@ la@@ tedly .
b@@ v@@ b-@@ bo@@ ss han@@ s-@@ jo@@ achi@@ m wat@@ z@@ ke had the heads of the dor@@ t@@ mun@@ d ul@@ tr@@ as then received in his office - and believed wat@@ z@@ ke &apos;s words , was this a more important message for the fan representatives .
&quot; it is used for the entire ul@@ tra-@@ movement to make massive cuts , &quot; the b@@ v@@ b bo@@ ss announced on thursday evening on a panel discussion in frankfurt .
as an emergency measure , wat@@ z@@ ke banned the ul@@ tr@@ as from playing a cho@@ re@@ o@@ graphy for the home game against the v@@ f@@ b stutt@@ gart .
&quot; i for@@ bi@@ dden that , &quot; he explained .
the zero tolerance policy on py@@ ro@@ techn@@ ics cannot be abandoned .
in addition , the ul@@ tr@@ as have been shown various ways of pun@@ ishing them - until tuesday they have time to decide for one .
otherwise , he will be the b@@ v@@ b until the end of next week .
&quot; this will be dr@@ astic &quot; , insu@@ red wat@@ z@@ ke .
you can be cur@@ ious about how the re@@ actions in the southern gallery will then be .
p@@ f@@ and@@ houses are bo@@ om@@ ing in sing@@ apor@@ e , as the crisis has hit the middle class .
in a p@@ f@@ and@@ haus in the ben@@ de@@ me@@ er shopping centre in sing@@ apor@@ e , jan@@ ani am@@ ir@@ th@@ al@@ ing@@ a exchanges a golden arm@@ re@@ if , a ring and a few ear@@ r@@ ings to kill off the school fees of her .
“ my hus@@ band and i have just bought a house , there ’ s all my money in it , ” says am@@ ir@@ th@@ al@@ ing@@ a .
although they receive 3@@ ,000 sing@@ apor@@ e dollars ( about 1,@@ 7@@ 30 euros ) each month as a management employee and their hus@@ band also works , the monthly family income does not extend , she explains .
indeed , demand in parts of south-@@ east asia – where household debt is rising – is so large that valu@@ em@@ a@@ x , where it can susta@@ in its exchange , is the third p@@ f@@ and@@ haus this week .
the ple@@ d@@ ging of je@@ well@@ ery is not only a quick way to get money – 1,@@ 300 sing@@ apor@@ e dollars in the case of jan@@ ani am@@ ir@@ th@@ al@@ ing@@ a – but also almost as favor@@ able as an un@@ secured dar@@ k@@ ness .
typically , p@@ f@@ and@@ houses in sing@@ apor@@ e demand an effective annual rate of 17 % , which is just above 15@@ .@@ 4 % , which the united over@@ seas bank requires , a local interest in l@@ ending .
however , p@@ f@@ and@@ houses offer the advantage that no veri@@ fication of cred@@ it@@ wor@@ thin@@ ess or income evidence is required here , which makes loans possible more quickly than in banks .
that is why millions of people in the region turn to p@@ f@@ and@@ houses , as families have been pus@@ hed to reduce the pressure by increasing living costs and increasing household and consumer debt .
after five years of robust growth since the global financial crisis and cheap loans due to lo@@ ose fiscal policies in developed economies , families with lower and mid@@ d@@ le-@@ income families are looking for shel@@ ters to stay at st@@ ot@@ ter@@ n@@ id economies .
this week , the rating agency called standard &amp; poor &apos;s growing budget debt , mainly due to rising mort@@ g@@ ages , a ris@@ k-@@ factor for credit rating .
mal@@ ay@@ sia , thailand , and sing@@ apor@@ e , according to the agency , have the highest budget debt in asia in terms of gdp .
mal@@ ay@@ sia , with 80 % of gdp , is at the top of the list , with 60 % still rising in 2008 .
econom@@ ists also worry about the high consumer debt in thailand , which this week was just out of a technical recession .
on thursday , the data showed that there is still a weak@@ ness in exports and a decre@@ ase in consumer demand .
“ in the final analysis , this means that , with rising costs , people in the middle to lower segment ( the income scale ) will try to supple@@ ment their income wherever possible . ”
historical gold price pe@@ aks over the past two years have rever@@ sed the trend of ple@@ d@@ ging personal items , as people have taken the opportunity to buy the je@@ well@@ ery of the family in cash .
in sing@@ apor@@ e , about 70 % of the ple@@ d@@ ged items are in the 200 ple@@ dge houses of the city state of gold .

the intelligence advis@@ or ed@@ ward snow@@ den has a fundamental interest in helping germany to clarify the increasingly explo@@ sive advertising of the n@@ sa at the end of the war .
according to the presentation of the green federal member han@@ s-@@ christian str@@ ö@@ be@@ le , his surprising meeting with snow@@ den in russia was about the conditions under which the ex@@ -@@ intelligence service staff could be prosecu@@ ted by a german prosecu@@ tor or public prosecu@@ tor .

rescue package over 3@@ 25 million austr@@ ali@@ an dollars for tas@@ man@@ ian health care .
the austr@@ ali@@ an government insi@@ sts on the har@@ sh conditions that the $ 3@@ 25 million rescue package will bring to the tas@@ man@@ ian health care sector .
federal minister for health t@@ any@@ a p@@ liber@@ se@@ k announced that the comm@@ on@@ wealth will be taking “ immediate action ” to a@@ ver@@ t a crisis caused by an aging population of the island state , a higher quota to ch@@ ick@@ en .
the funding for a four-@@ year period was agreed with the independent tas@@ man@@ ian me@@ p andre@@ w wil@@ ki@@ e after government consul@@ tations .
“ the government has proposed an emergency rescue package that will , in our view , address the unique challenges facing the federal state in terms of its own , ” said p@@ liber@@ se@@ k today .
the $ 3@@ 2@@ 5-@@ million package includes $ 31 million of emergency aid for electoral services .
the new 2@@ 600 sur@@ gery , including or@@ th@@ op@@ a@@ edi@@ c operations and treatments for gre@@ y star , will eliminate resi@@ du@@ es .
in addition , there is money for day@@ -to-@@ day clin@@ ics in ho@@ b@@ art and laun@@ ce@@ ston , better after@@ care after sta@@ tionary stays , fac@@ har@@ z@@ eu@@ g@@ training , services in the field of mental health and the introduction of a data system for local health .
“ these investments are in line with the ideas that affected clinical staff have told me that they are the best way to improve the tas@@ man@@ ian health system , ” said t@@ any@@ a p@@ liber@@ se@@ k .
the minister insi@@ sted on a strict reporting and accountability of the tas@@ man@@ ian government .
the state must maintain the current level of funding to finance comm@@ on@@ wealth .
a three-@@ member commission will be set up to ensure that the state provides health services as effectively and efficiently as possible .
as wil@@ ki@@ e said today , the $ 3@@ 25 million would be of little use if “ they are not accompanied by real reforms that will drive public tas@@ man@@ ia health care to a more sustainable course . ”
despite this , he p@@ raised the government for respon@@ ding to his request for urgent help , which he first made to the prime minister at the beginning of may .
“ i am confident that the federal aid will make a major contribution to improving the state ’ s public health system from the list of concerns , ” said wil@@ ki@@ e .
according to the state government , these electoral benefits will largely off@@ set the recent cuts .
but the opposition ’ s federal health spo@@ kes@@ man , peter du@@ tt@@ on , believes that today ’ s announcement is only a “ pav@@ ing solution . ”
“ we are in the present situation because the labor@@ at@@ or@@ y-@@ state government has with@@ drawn $ 4@@ 30 million from the health system , ” he said to ab@@ c tv .
a state government cannot be allowed to run almost half a billion dollars out of the system and the comm@@ on@@ wealth should be eur 300 million and then put in place as if it were good news .
du@@ tt@@ on asked p@@ liber@@ se@@ k to guarantee that not a single dollar of the rescue package would be spent on additional bureaucracy .

syria has made its way to producing chemical weapons destroyed , a monitoring group , a group of people have said that it would not be able to do so , a monitoring group that would be set up to monitor the situation .
syria has established important facilities for the production of chemical weapons and g@@ it@@ ting gas am@@ m@@ uni@@ tion , declared the global monitoring group for chemical weapons on thursday , while it has caused severe cl@@ ash@@ es in the north of the country near a site .
a sy@@ ri@@ an activi@@ sts group also announced on thursday that more than 1@@ 20@@ ,000 people have been killed since the start of the civil war , but soon three years ago .
the announcement by the organization for the ban on chemical weapons ( op@@ c@@ w ) came one day before the date on which the ban was due on the day before the date on 12 january 2007 .
november 1 , which the h@@ ague based organisation dam@@ as@@ c@@ us had set up to provide all the facilities for the production of chemical weapons or to prevent “ in@@ oper@@ able ” , including all the machines for mix@@ ing of chemical weapons .
the conclusion of this process , which is , in fact , the first stage of destruction , is an important mil@@ est@@ one in an ambitious timetable aimed at destro@@ ying all chemical weapons in syria by mid-@@ 20@@ 14 .
the destruction of the facilities means that syria will no longer be able to produce new chemical weapons .
dam@@ as@@ c@@ us , however , must begin to use the weapons and stocks that exist .
it is believed that there are about 1@@ ,000 tonnes of chemicals and weapons in the country , including mu@@ st@@ ard gas and the ner@@ vous gas sar@@ in .
the announcement came at a time when on thursday fighting in the city of sa@@ fir@@ a took place , by the experts say that there was a production facility for chemical weapons and storage facilities here , such as those based in the uk .
the acti@@ vis@@ t group , which has a network of activi@@ sts in syria persecu@@ ting the number of dead , declared on thursday 1@@ 20@@ ,@@ 2@@ 96 people dead .
of these , 6@@ 1,@@ 0@@ 67 civili@@ ans , including 6@@ ,@@ 3@@ 65 children .
the government had 2@@ 9@@ ,@@ 9@@ 54 of them committed to president bas@@ ha@@ r as@@ sad ’ s army , 18@@ ,@@ 6@@ 78 were pro-@@ government figh@@ ters , and 18@@ 7 leban@@ ese hi@@ z@@ bol@@ lah mil@@ i@@ ti@@ as .
the death tol@@ l is 2.@@ 20@@ 2 deser@@ ted army soldiers and 5@@ ,@@ 3@@ 75 opposition figh@@ ters , many of them foreign@@ ers .
on 25 july , the un estimated the number of deaths in this conflict since march 2011 to 10@@ 0,000 .
this number has not been updated .
the conflict has led to the ex@@ o@@ du@@ s of some two million people .
as@@ sad ’ s troops have been fighting the re@@ be@@ ls in sa@@ fir@@ a for weeks , many of whom have links with al q@@ a@@ ed@@ a groups .
the observ@@ atory said that there were losses on thursday on both sides , but did not mention details .
the fighting under@@ lines the danger posed to the chemical weapons inspec@@ tors , because their mission to liber@@ ate syria from its tox@@ ic weapons ar@@ sen@@ al is a race against time am@@ id@@ st a r@@ aging civil war .
according to the op@@ c@@ w , which co@@ operates closely with the united nations , the team was “ now convinced that it would be able to meet all the important production and mix@@ ing / filling facilities mentioned by syria and to see their destruction . ”
therefore , “ no further inspection activities are planned at the moment . ”
earlier this week , the inspec@@ tors said that they had completed the first round of checks and that they had completed 21 out of 23 of the sites indicated by dam@@ as@@ c@@ us .
due to security concerns , the visit of two facilities was not possible , the inspec@@ tors said .
on thursday , op@@ wc stated that the two sites were “ abandoned ” according to sy@@ ri@@ an statements ... and the chemical weapons program objects there were transferred to other facilities named , which were in@@ sp@@ ected . ”
it was not immediately clear whether the site in sa@@ fir@@ a was one of the two facilities that the op@@ c@@ w inspec@@ tors could not visit .
syria has a plan for the complete destruction of its chemical weapons , which will be approved next month by the op@@ wc executive committee .
“ i take my hat off to the bra@@ very and courage that you all showed in ful@@ filling the most challenging mission ever undertaken by this organisation .
for three years now , the mainly sun@@ ni muslim re@@ be@@ ls have been fighting as@@ sad ’ s government and its security forces , which have led many members of the al@@ a@@ wi@@ tes , to a sec@@ ession of shi@@ a islam .
with regard to further developments , the head of the observ@@ atory , ram@@ i ab@@ dur@@ ra@@ h@@ man , said that there was a strong explo@@ sion in an air defence facility in the sy@@ ri@@ an coastal province of lat@@ ak@@ ia on wednesday .
the cause of the explo@@ sion was not known , he explained .
an@@ ger over jud@@ g@@ ement of bom@@ b depos@@ itors of bal@@ i
survi@@ v@@ ors and rela@@ tives of the 20@@ 2 people who died in 2002 during the bal@@ i bom@@ b attack respon@@ ded to an@@ ger over the sentence of the last of the in@@ sti@@ g@@ ators , which was brought to justice .
pa@@ te@@ k , who was one of the most sou@@ the@@ ast asian people on the run for almost ten years , was nom@@ inated yesterday for his role in the construction of explo@@ si@@ ves for the bom@@ b attack .
with a penalty suspension , it could be made redun@@ dant after 15 years .
the 45 year-@@ old was found guil@@ ty of mass murder for the attack on two night clubs in the popular tourist area of k@@ ut@@ a , where the 20@@ 2 people died .
a convic@@ tion was also made in a number of terrorist charges , including a wave of sp@@ ur@@ ious substances .
the prosecu@@ tor had demanded a life sentence , even if it was not acceptable to the man who was considered to be a master bom@@ ber maker for his reputation as a “ demo@@ lition man ” .
the decision has brought pain@@ ful mem@@ ories to june cor@@ teen , a mother from per@@ th who had lived her 39 year-@@ old twin dau@@ gh@@ ters jan@@ e and jen@@ ny in the po@@ e@@ try of pa@@ te@@ k and his co-@@ p@@ lots almost ten years ago .
fighting with te@@ ars , she said that pa@@ te@@ k should have been condemned to death .
i really think he should be in the foot@@ steps of the other gu@@ ys .
“ you should protect him from a sho@@ oting command , ” said cor@@ teen to a@@ ap .
i have to live with the fact that i am not going to get any further grand@@ children and i will never see my dau@@ gh@@ ters again .
the sar@@ i club was made the same as the ground when , on 12 october 2002 , a massive bom@@ b was explo@@ ded in a small tr@@ uck that was be@@ aten up in front of the night club .
peter hu@@ gh@@ es was in pad@@ dy &apos;s bar , where only 20 seconds earlier a su@@ ici@@ de bom@@ ber killed a man filled with explo@@ si@@ ves .
he fell for a month after the attack and “ died ” three times , while he was in a life preser@@ vation system .
hu@@ gh@@ es said that pa@@ te@@ k deser@@ ved the same fate as the other three members of the y@@ em@@ a@@ ah islam@@ i@@ ah – am@@ ro@@ zi , mu@@ kh@@ las , and i@@ ma@@ m sam@@ u@@ dr@@ a – terrorist cell responsible for the war .
really , this type should be given the death penalty above all others .
to keep him alive – no , there is no reason to keep him alive .
20 years after he killed 20@@ 2 people and hundreds w@@ oun@@ ded , is not much .
pa@@ te@@ k is the last of the bal@@ i bom@@ bers to be tried .
he was ev@@ ic@@ ted almost a decade from arrest , but was finally arrested in january 2011 in the pa@@ ki@@ stan@@ i town of ab@@ bot@@ tab@@ ad , where us forces replaced former al-@@ q@@ a@@ ed@@ a chief os@@ ama , bare@@ ly four months later .
during the negotiation , an f@@ bi agent said that intelligence reports would point out that the government of pa@@ te@@ k had committed su@@ ici@@ de in pakistan .
“ he didn ’ t stand up , ” said cor@@ teen .
until recently , he has not shown any re@@ mor@@ se for the suffering he has inf@@ lic@@ ted on other people .
the judgment was delivered before the ten years of this year &apos;s attack , which was marked by comm@@ em@@ or@@ ative celebra@@ tions in bal@@ i and australia .
“ there will be many te@@ ars this year , ” said cor@@ teen .
pa@@ te@@ k may appeal against his judgment .
fa@@ a : passengers can now use electronic devices on aircraft ( but do not run mobile phone calls ) .
passengers can now travel from the departure to lan@@ ding to read , work , play , listen to music and watch movies .
but passengers should not expect these changes to be implemented immediately .
how fast they would be implemented depends on the airline , fa@@ a employee michael hu@@ er@@ ta explained on a press conference .
the airlines must prove to the fa@@ a that aircraft comply with the new directives and that they have comp@@ iled the training manu@@ als of the airline staff and the rules governing the storage of equipment in accordance with the new regulations .
the fa@@ a has stated that it has already received plans from some airlines to pro@@ hi@@ bit the use of port@@ able electronic devices in aircraft .
among these airlines were del@@ ta and j@@ et@@ blue .
“ depending on the status of the plan , we could approve the extended use of electronic devices very soon , ” the fa@@ a announced in a statement .
currently , passengers must purchase smar@@ t@@ phones , tab@@ lets and other devices if the air@@ plane doors are closed .
you may not re@@ boot them until the aircraft reach@@ es a height of three kilometres and the captain has the green light .
the ticket for the lan@@ ding must be turned off by passengers and not re@@ boo@@ ted before the aircraft ends .
the new directives would allow airlines whose aircraft are protected from electronic dis@@ rup@@ tions to allow their passengers to use the equipment even when they start , land and roll fields , declared fa@@ a .
most new aircraft and other aircraft that are required to use wi-fi in larger h@@ alls are now in use .
la@@ ura gl@@ ading , president of professional aviation compan@@ i@@ ons , welcomed the changes .
“ if the new regulation is implemented safe@@ ly – and we work closely with the airline in this regard – both sides will benefit , ” comm@@ ented gl@@ ading .
we are frank@@ ly ti@@ red of being a wat@@ ch@@ dog on this issue .
however , internet connections to surfing , ex@@ changing em@@ ail@@ s , text messages or downloading data under three kilometres remained prohibited , explained the authority .
passengers are asked to purchase smar@@ t@@ phones , tab@@ lets and other devices in flight mode .
so there is still no word with friends , the scr@@ ab@@ ble res@@ emb@@ les online game that the actor ale@@ c bal@@ d@@ win has launched in 2011 on his smar@@ t@@ phone as he public@@ ized public .
and he@@ avi@@ er devices like lap@@ top@@ s must continue to be sto@@ wed , as there is a risk of in@@ jury if they fly through the cab@@ in .
mobile calls during the flight remain prohibited as well .
the regulatory competence for telephone calls lies with the federal communications commission ( f@@ cc ) , not with the fac@@ t-@@ finding mission .
fa@@ a may lift the ban on certain electronic devices when they start and land on the land on star@@ tup and lan@@ ding at fa@@ a .
last month , mark ro@@ sen@@ ker said that he had been arrested by the national transport safety board , security expert on domestic transport issues on c@@ bs news , mobile phones would still be considered as a risk .
“ mobile phones are really a problem , not only because they potentially cause dis@@ ru@@ ption in navigation devices , but because we know from the f@@ cc that the transmission from the air also trans@@ ports dis@@ ru@@ pt trans@@ mit@@ ters , ” said .
a consulting committee of the industry , which was set up by the fa@@ a to investigate this issue , last month recommended that the government should draw up a broader dep@@ loy@@ ment of personal electronic equipment .
in recent years , pressure on the fa@@ a has increased , restrictions on use have been relaxed .
cri@@ tics like the democratic sen@@ ator cla@@ ire mc@@ cas@@ kill of mis@@ sour@@ i argue that there is no valid legal security .
the restrictions are also increasingly difficult to en@@ force , because the use of the equipment has become u@@ bi@@ qu@@ it@@ ous .
some studies have mentioned that up to one third of passengers can be prevented from turning off the equipment or ignored .
the fa@@ a began in 196@@ 6 to ban the use of electronic equipment by air passengers after reports of distur@@ ban@@ ces in navigation and communication equipment were replaced by reports by uc@@ its carried by passengers .
new aircraft are much more dependent on electrical systems than previous generations of aircraft , but they are also designed and built by the fa@@ a , that they can be provided with electronic inter@@ ference .
airlines have been offering wi-fi internet access for several years now , when the flight height is reached .
the software solutions adapted to wi-fi systems are also in@@ sensitive to the inter@@ ference of the user .
the vast majority of passenger aircraft should be electron@@ ically operated according to the new directives .
today ’ s electronic devices generally produce much less radio radiation than previous generations .
e-@@ read@@ ers , for example , only give minimal radiation when you sc@@ roll .
however , when downloading or sending data , the transmission values are stronger .
among the ad@@ voca@@ tes of eas@@ ing restrictions on the use of passenger equipment , amaz@@ on@@ .@@ com@@ .
in 2011 , corporate employees ordered a passenger aircraft full of kin@@ dle e-@@ reader and made a test flight to identify problems , but could not detec@@ t them .
members of the fa@@ a advisory committee have expressed mixed feel@@ ings about the risk of using fa@@ a equipment .
dou@@ gl@@ as kid@@ d , from the national association of airline passengers , said that he felt that the dis@@ ru@@ ption caused by the equipment was genuine , even if the risk was minimal .
other committee members said that there are only a few reports from pil@@ ots who are responsible for dis@@ ru@@ ption of aircraft systems by the equipment .
the committee recommended the fa@@ a , however , to allow pil@@ ots to take part in instr@@ um@@ ental lan@@ ding under poor vi@@ sibility conditions by preventing the equipment from being turned off by passengers .
a group from the travel industry welcomed the changes and called them a sensible adjustment for travellers who are now well equipped with technology .
“ we are pleased that the fa@@ a recogn@@ iz@@ es that a pleasant passenger experience is not in@@ compatible with safety , ” said ro@@ ger do@@ w , ceo of the u.s. travel association .
by air rescue service from north sea dr@@ ill island rescu@@ ed bird again .
a car park which is flo@@ wn by air rescue service to the coast , which is exhaus@@ ted on a north sea dr@@ ill island , has been re@@ integrated into nature .
the water pur@@ als were delivered last month with a helicop@@ ter to ab@@ er@@ de@@ en , where they were taken from the scot@@ tish animal welfare organisation sp@@ ca to their rescue centre in allo@@ a .
col@@ in se@@ d@@ don , head of the center , said : “ this water pur@@ ale was probably a winter mi@@ gr@@ atory bird from northern europe , which was bur@@ ied by the strong win@@ ds above the north sea . ”

is europe ’ s elite prepared to do business with britain ?
business for britain was launched in april with the intention of bringing the economy to a table and defining what those who are in the uk fighting for prosperity and jobs will want to change in our relations with the eu .
to this end , we have launched the largest and most comprehensive survey among british economic leaders and asked them what they thought about britain , the economy and the eu .
you@@ go@@ v in@@ qui@@ red about 1@@ ,000 business execu@@ tives who had roughly the uk corporate size , sectors , and regions .
the results of the survey will surprise many .
we have found that the vast majority of companies now export outside europe and rely on countries that are modern@@ ising and growing , while the states in the eu are stag@@ n@@ ating .
they want new trade links with countries such as china , india and brazil to be fav@@ oured by the government , rather than dealing with the long and demanding process that has made the eu ’ s ob@@ sc@@ ure institutions reform .
in demand of their view on certain issues regulated by law – from anti@@ trust law to product legislation – the majority of economic leaders believe that control of these key competences should be based on west@@ min@@ ster .
there was general dis@@ satisfaction with the internal market , because according to companies , the cost of the brussels rules has now out@@ weigh@@ ed the benefits of being part of europe ’ s trade area – even 40 % of large companies agreed .
finally , and probably the most important thing , our survey of economic leaders revealed that a clear majority had moved away from britain in the direction of changing the agreement and that a relationship with the eu based on trade is not political .
this recognition , which has proven to be widely shared by companies of all sizes and leading groups , shows that the economy is pus@@ hing for a “ meaning@@ ful change ” that will bring the le@@ g of action back to britain .
it is about a lot – a change in the agreement and better conditions for britain would lead to a change of opinion at 16 % in favour of staying in the eu in a referendum .
the prime minister should have no doubt : this survey shows that the british economy is behind its plan to re@@ negotiate british membership conditions .
it also shows that companies are clearly moving away from re@@ negotiation and that the balance of power is clearly shi@@ fting back to britain .
a better deal for the british economy is possible and increasingly necessary , as the eurozone is moving toward closer economic integration and fiscal consolidation .
the priority must be jobs and growth in the uk , as the result of our survey shows , what increased attention is paid to trade and fundamental change in the brussels approach to regulation .
alex@@ e@@ i mill@@ er of ga@@ z@@ pro@@ m calls the pipel@@ ine in bulgaria the beginning of a new gas era in the country the beginning of a new gas era .
the construction of the south stream pipel@@ ine in bulgaria marks the start of one of the largest european energy projects , the ga@@ z@@ pro@@ m board declared .
“ today ’ s event is a mil@@ est@@ one : construction work on the bulg@@ arian section of the south stream gas pipel@@ ine , the largest and most important project in europe , has begun , ” said ga@@ z@@ pro@@ m ceo alex@@ and@@ ria .
the project is a key element in the energy security of the entire european continent .
south stream is to ensure more diversity in russia &apos;s export routes through europe .
a ga@@ z@@ pro@@ m contract with his counter@@ parts in ukraine , where most of russia ’ s gas is p@@ oured for europe , is a source of increased risk in terms of conventional pipel@@ ines , as was suggested by official sources .
mill@@ er said the direct link to bulgaria , a member of the european union , meant that the links with transit countries were not “ for ever ” .
bulg@@ arian consumers receive south stream gas at dis@@ coun@@ ted rates when the whole project is up and running in 20@@ 15 .
ga@@ z@@ pro@@ m says that construction work in other sub@@ ordin@@ ate countries should be completed on the planned route at the end of the year .
the pipel@@ ine is estimated to have an annual capacity of 6@@ 2.@@ 3 billion cu@@ b@@ ic metres of natural gas .

hearing before the royal commission : two y@@ m@@ ca staff before acc@@ us@@ ations against jon@@ a@@ than lord for sexual off@@ ences .
two new south wal@@ es y@@ m@@ ca employees ( n@@ s@@ w ) were arrested for sexual off@@ ences involving children .
but when the commission opened its doors , the y@@ m@@ ca said that ‘ in the organisation there was never a case of sexual child abuse ’ .
managing director phil@@ li@@ p h@@ are was inter@@ viewed about a case in which a y@@ m@@ ca employee was arrested for crimes involving child por@@ no@@ graphy , and a different case in which a sports teacher from the y@@ m@@ ca .
h@@ are said ga@@ il fur@@ ness , one of the commission assi@@ sting lawyers , that he knew of the first case , but did not know the second .
he ad@@ mitted that the opening declaration of the y@@ m@@ ca to the commission was also v@@ ague in the asser@@ tion that “ there were external reviews of the y@@ m@@ ca , in which the y@@ m@@ ca was seen as the front line .
evidence before the commission shows that the y@@ m@@ ca has been informed that it has not yet received the second lowest assessment of four possible in a quality audit of the department of education and communication .
h@@ are , who started with 21 at the y@@ m@@ ca , ad@@ mitted that the management had “ started down@@ wards from me ” in appoin@@ ting lord .
lord was arrested at the beginning of the year for sexual off@@ ences against twelve bo@@ ys during his two-@@ year activity for the y@@ m@@ ca .
he was sent@@ enced to at least six years in prison .
h@@ are , however , insi@@ sted that the y@@ m@@ ca had a cultural problem that prevented employees from using l@@ ord@@ s ’ s off@@ ences in relation to children ’ s safety .
the staff said that they had observed violations , including that lord was alone with children , they had been priv@@ ately treated as bab@@ y@@ sit@@ ters , they were on his la@@ p , and said that they had not liked it .
dani@@ elle oc@@ k@@ well , whose chief executive was lord and who was asked to provide a child protection training because of his behavior , was concerned that he was not a child .
the managing director stated that he would not accept statements from employees that they would not have d@@ ared to re@@ im@@ bur@@ se their superi@@ ors .
instead , he said , their friend@@ ship with lord has affected their judgment , which is why they have not reported it .
h@@ are explained that he has appointed the board of the y@@ m@@ ca n@@ s@@ w his view that the lesson the organization lear@@ ns from the “ jon@@ a@@ than lord intermedi@@ ary ” incident .
h@@ are said to have taken the decision to brief the staff to sign confid@@ enti@@ ality obligations after the acc@@ us@@ ations occurred , was taken by the y@@ m@@ ca ’ s chief child services officer li@@ am wh@@ it@@ ley .
he said that this should prevent contam@@ ination of the evidence , but this is “ over@@ ze@@ al@@ ous ” and po@@ or@@ ly implemented .
the y@@ m@@ ca n@@ s@@ w was in the time when jon@@ a@@ than lord was working there between 2009 and 2011 , not a safe organization for children , professor ste@@ ph@@ en small@@ bone explained by the gri@@ ff@@ ith university .

in an interview this evening on the fifth anniversary of his reti@@ rement from office , the president of the european union , the 59 , announced his views on various domestic issues .
since his re@@ sign@@ ation in june 2007 , after a decade as head of state , bla@@ ir has largely avoided expressing his views on british politics , and his comments mostly on foreign policy and his role as en@@ vo@@ y of the quar@@ tet .
in response to the question of whether he would like to return to the post of prime minister , bla@@ ir was awarded the ev@@ ing standard in london by saying , ‘ yes , yes , but it is unlikely that this will happen ... ’
when hor@@ se@@ -@@ drawn experts in car@@ di@@ ff found themselves in car@@ di@@ ff to be the horse of the year , they knew that a hard competi@@ tor was im@@ minent .
but no one was on the three year-@@ old f@@ ent@@ on kir@@ k@@ land .
the k@@ n@@ ir@@ ps , which is not even in the kin@@ der@@ gar@@ ten and only a few months ago did his first steps , and his sh@@ et@@ land pon@@ y to@@ ff@@ ee pul@@ led loo@@ sely through the three roun@@ ds and hit the first adult .
the in@@ separ@@ able pair , both equal size , were chosen for their appearance , behavior and style in the annual competition .
in his appearance in competition with men and women with elegant mel@@ ons , he had his leg@@ hold cap in a che@@ e@@ ky angle and led the two year-@@ old to@@ ff@@ ee through the ring .
f@@ ent@@ on was chosen by the jur@@ ors for its natural skills in handling the pon@@ y , which is much higher than its age .
and to@@ ff@@ ee received be@@ st-@@ marks for his performance and person@@ ality .
f@@ ent@@ on had to@@ ff@@ ee last march as a gift for his third birth@@ day and since then has been working with the sh@@ et@@ land pon@@ y every day .
his mother , don@@ na , 30 , said : “ f@@ ent@@ on and to@@ ff@@ ee are a great str@@ and . ”
they had to compete against the entire participants and are covered with gold po@@ c@@ kets and ro@@ set@@ tes .
it was only the second time that he participated in a competition with to@@ ff@@ ee , and we were all delighted when he won .
completely str@@ ang@@ ers in the arena thought he was so phenomen@@ al that they could be photograph@@ ed with him .
the little boy from the village of nan@@ ty@@ gl@@ o near eb@@ b@@ w val@@ e , south wal@@ es , follows in the foot@@ steps of his a@@ un@@ t shar@@ on ho@@ wel@@ ls , who has been holding horses for over ten years .
ho@@ well ’ s story : “ the entire audience was as electr@@ ici@@ zed , and everyone fi@@ red and cla@@ pped him . ”
he ran on sand the entire length of the arena and although he looked so tiny , he has fantastic work done .
f@@ ent@@ on is cra@@ zy about animals – he lo@@ ves horses , trac@@ tors and farms and has two ch@@ ick@@ ens to feed .
as it is launched , it will not take long before it is on the “ horse of the year ” show – and i am sure he will be well done .
a spo@@ kes@@ man for the annual horse show said : “ f@@ ent@@ on is only three , but he knows how to handle his pon@@ y . ”
together they are a great team .
the jury jud@@ ged f@@ ent@@ on and to@@ ff@@ ee about how well they be@@ aten and were presented in the performance ring .
they ensure good cooperation between pon@@ y and leader – and here f@@ ent@@ on and to@@ ff@@ ee were the best in the ring .
i am sure that f@@ ent@@ on ’ s sweet clothes have played their part in making this a perfect occasion .
according to the appeal , the chinese newspaper is to be “ re@@ formed ” after “ re@@ formed ”
a chinese newspaper , which called on the front page for the release of a re@@ porter who was charged with de@@ fam@@ ation , should be re@@ formed .
the gu@@ ang@@ z@@ ho@@ u based new express had a rare public appearance , and the government was not prepared to give up the journ@@ alist chen y@@ ong@@ z@@ ho@@ u .
but chen later ad@@ mitted on television that he had taken bri@@ bes to report a sub-@@ state company that was not in the process of being counterfe@@ ited .
now the new express is being subjec@@ ted to “ comprehensive rec@@ ti@@ fication , ” the regulatory authority declared .
the “ rec@@ ti@@ fication order ” was issued by the press and publications , radio , film and television agency in gu@@ ang@@ d@@ ong .
preliminary investigations showed that the new express , the new express , which was added to the y@@ ang@@ chen@@ g evening news group , was closed between september 2012 and august 2013 .
“ the new express ed@@ it@@ orial management was dis@@ ordered , ” the regulatory authority announced in a statement .
she said that she decided to “ impose an administrative penalty on chen y@@ ong@@ z@@ ho@@ u and to give him his re@@ porter license ” .
in addition , the y@@ ang@@ chen@@ g evening news group was instruc@@ ted to introduce a complete rec@@ ti@@ fication of the new express and to recommend that the relevant persons be identified at the new express and immediately noti@@ fy the new express management team .
chen had written several articles for the new express , in which he reported alleg@@ ed financial ir@@ regul@@ arities at a manufacturer of construction machinery called zo@@ om@@ lion .
after being arrested , the newspaper published two calls for his release on the title page and presented itself behind his journ@@ alist s@@ log@@ ans .
but then chen appeared on state television and ad@@ mitted that he had published false reports for payment .
“ in this case i have damaged zo@@ om@@ lion , as well as the entire news industry and its ability to win public confidence , ” he declared to the state news channel c@@ c@@ tv .
i did so primarily because i was looking for money and gl@@ ory .
i realized that i was wrong .
following chen ’ s apo@@ logy , the new express published an apo@@ logy on the front page , st@@ ating that it failed to read the reports correctly .
several well-known susp@@ ects have recently been on television conf@@ essions .
experts say that conf@@ essions are still rout@@ inely forced , despite a legislative change in early this year , in which the authorities were banned from imposing someone .
dro@@ gen@@ tun@@ nels with their own railway between the usa and mexico are discovered by the us and mexico .
one of the most refined tun@@ nels for drug s@@ mu@@ gg@@ ling between the us and mexico , which is completely covered with lighting , v@@ enti@@ lation and electric railway operations , has now been discovered .
the us authorities described the 120 x 90 cen@@ time@@ ters tunnel as one of the most sophisticated pass@@ ages that they have ever found .
the tunnel , which is covered in the zi@@ g@@ z@@ ag pattern over a length of almost six football fields , connec@@ ts ware@@ houses near ti@@ ju@@ ana , mexico , and san di@@ e@@ go , usa .
there are countless un@@ seem@@ ly ware@@ houses in the area , making it easier to use dru@@ g-@@ loaded lor@@ ries .
the tunnel had been closed before drugs were trans@@ ported un@@ detec@@ ted in it , the authorities declared .
when the tunnel was discovered , eight and a half tonnes of mari@@ ju@@ ana and 14@@ 8 kil@@ o@@ gram@@ s of co@@ ca@@ ine were secured , according to the court &apos;s records .
three men , according to the authorities , who were drivers , were arrested for the pos@@ session and the intended sale of mari@@ ju@@ ana and co@@ ca@@ ine .
they are threatened with prison in a sentence of ten years and for life .
in no@@ gal@@ es , ari@@ z@@ ona , s@@ mu@@ gg@@ lers are rel@@ ying on an extensive underground network of dra@@ in@@ age channels .
the tunnel is the eigh@@ th large pass@@ age that has been discovered since 2006 in san di@@ e@@ go .
some of the largest tun@@ nels were built after mari@@ ju@@ ana har@@ v@@ est in central mexico in october , which protected the drug car@@ te@@ ls from the challenge of how they could quickly bring their product to the consumers .
in 2010 , authorities found a pass@@ age of almost 6@@ 40 metres long with rail@@ s that were used by a kitchen in a residential house in ti@@ ju@@ ana to two sto@@ re@@ houses in san di@@ e@@ go .
or@@ lan@@ do blo@@ om and mir@@ anda ker@@ r still love to play with .
actors or@@ lan@@ do blo@@ om and model mir@@ anda ker@@ r want to go separate paths in the future .
in an interview , however , blo@@ om said that he and ker@@ r still love each other .
mir@@ anda ker@@ r and or@@ lan@@ do blo@@ om are parents of the two-@@ year-@@ old fl@@ y@@ n@@ n .
actors or@@ lan@@ do blo@@ om has committed to separ@@ ating his wife , top@@ model mir@@ anda ker@@ r .
in an interview with us journ@@ alist k@@ ati@@ e cou@@ ric , who was on friday ( local time ) , she was saying that she was going to be &quot; life sometimes does not go exactly as we do .

&quot; we will support each other and love each other as parents of fl@@ y@@ n@@ n &quot; .

ve@@ gan@@ ism , according to le@@ xi@@ ka , is sub@@ ordin@@ ate to vege@@ tari@@ an@@ ism , but diff@@ ers from this in a very significant way .
for while vege@@ tari@@ ans are dedicated to eating cre@@ am ca@@ kes , ice ca@@ kes or a strong ed@@ am , these bad things are not on the menu .
milk , cheese , eg@@ g , besides the aband@@ on@@ ment of meat and fish , the ve@@ gan let the ve@@ gan di@@ et of all animal products - even hon@@ ey is denied .
what remains , one might wonder , but , on closer inspection , ve@@ gan nutri@@ tion is characterized by a considerable imag@@ ination .
&quot; bread spre@@ ads are very popular , &quot; explains ute hen@@ kel@@ mann , the owner of the local reform house , who has developed a variety of special products for ve@@ g@@ ans .
re@@ u@@ ben proc@@ tor also visits the shop in dom@@ gas@@ se .
for 13 years , the native ve@@ gan , born in new ze@@ al@@ and , finds ( almost ) everything that he needs to live in lam@@ per@@ the@@ im . &quot; in 1997 i was introduced to my di@@ et and became a vege@@ t@@ arian .
at the turn of the century , the next step was taken and i became ve@@ gan .
&quot; however , the convic@@ tion came not only because of nutri@@ tion , but because of the choice of shoes , &quot; says proc@@ tor , the art leather pre@@ fers normal leather .
he realized that there were also other everyday concerns without animal products .
ve@@ gan is first and foremost an eth@@ ic .
&quot; i do not want animals to die for me , &quot; proc@@ tor spe@@ aks the ve@@ g@@ ans &apos; ma@@ xi@@ m , which exten@@ ds to the whole consumption behaviour .
instead of bur@@ gers , sti@@ r@@ ring e@@ gg@@ s or rub@@ ber@@ bears , the ve@@ g@@ ans quickly discovered new products that could increase enthusiasm .
&quot; it is a double bonus , &quot; proc@@ tor says today , &quot; &quot; in fact , ve@@ gan does not represent a ren@@ un@@ ci@@ ation , not an as@@ ce@@ tic , &quot; the as@@ sumption that you can live with the di@@ et .
and it is precisely these conditions that have allowed some of the well-@@ inten@@ tioned attempts to fail .
&quot; the ad@@ diction factor is a very important factor that many quickly give up , similar to smoking , &quot; proc@@ tor makes a comparison .
and applies one : &quot; certain flav@@ ors are not fixed to the animal &quot; .
often it is the sp@@ ices or the type of preparation that make up the taste .
&quot; but you can also create the same effect in other ways , &quot; the ve@@ g@@ ans clearly point .
proc@@ on , for example , brings e@@ gg@@ plants , mus@@ h@@ rooms and also a few ve@@ gan sa@@ us@@ ages to a bar@@ bec@@ ue festival .
it is a balanced , varied di@@ et , with a good taste for the food .
of course , we want to have something between the te@@ eth , that is legitimate .
&quot; it should taste , but this is not only to reduce animal food &quot; , says proc@@ tor .
health damage , up to eating dis@@ orders , another widespread as@@ sumption , he did not suffer .
for me , the change@@ over has had a positive aspect .
i don &apos;t take any foreign cho@@ le@@ ster@@ ol and i have an increased vit@@ am@@ in content .
there are high performance yach@@ ts that are exclusively fed to ve@@ gan .
&quot; my blood values are excellent , i let me check them often , &quot; says proc@@ tor .
in particular , the lack of vit@@ am@@ in b@@ 12 war@@ ns many ve@@ gan@@ si@@ sts .
&quot; since animals are fed with feed , rather than being gra@@ zed on the pa@@ st@@ ure , it is doub@@ t@@ ful whether the meat they eat in the re@@ fri@@ ger@@ ator is the vit@@ am@@ in b@@ 12 content high . &quot;
ve@@ g@@ ans also have the opportunity to use the co@@ en@@ zy@@ me in the form of tab@@ lets .
&quot; my b@@ 12 values are fine , &quot; he explains .
long di@@ stances must not be made by proc@@ tor for food procurement .
after all , basic food@@ stuffs exist everywhere and every super@@ market has now so@@ ya milk and other products .
all i need is loc@@ ally .
i buy something special only from time to time .
&quot; many people over@@ look the fact that only the finished products are expensive , but that is the way it is known for &quot; ordinary &quot; finished products .
in any case , ve@@ gan dishes are much cheaper and less time@@ -@@ consum@@ ing than conventional ve@@ gan dishes .
&quot; there is a lot to discover in the kitchen , with a few small sn@@ acks you can get good , if not sometimes better results , &quot; says proc@@ tor .
mar@@ gar@@ ine instead of but@@ ter , a little more ba@@ king pow@@ der and carbon ac@@ id instead of eg@@ g , with its ve@@ gan cheese ca@@ kes proc@@ tor could also ast@@ ound his fa@@ i@@ th@@ ful parents .
family celebra@@ tions give ve@@ g@@ ans a new sp@@ ice .
this is dynamic when you co@@ ok together , and it has a new significance .
&quot; the situations that may arise are as different as the people themselves , &quot; says proc@@ tor .
of course , he has already been s@@ cep@@ tical .
do you not like my meal any more ?
&quot; should i feel bad now because i drink milk ? &quot; - at such a situation i have to ask as ve@@ g@@ ans with fing@@ er@@ tips .
&quot; i do not reject people , i am part of this society , &quot; proc@@ tor does not want to be an enc@@ la@@ ve .
and , more precisely , the everyday world does not appear as ve@@ gan ali@@ en as susp@@ ected - and ve@@ g@@ ans are not as restricted in everyday life as they usually assume .
fast food is also allowed .
pom@@ mes are everywhere !
&quot; many d@@ ö@@ ner shops offer fal@@ af@@ el , or even a vege@@ t@@ arian yu@@ f@@ ka , &quot; says proc@@ tor .
in a piz@@ zer@@ ia , he is a little more than pa@@ sta dishes , or he orders a piz@@ za without cheese , all a matter of hab@@ it .
the restaurants are so slowly sett@@ ling down on it .
&quot; when i started to get ve@@ gan 13 years ago , everything was much more difficult , &quot; the new@@ -@@ ze@@ al@@ and country can identify a development : &quot; you have to be with people who need it to be al@@ ert &quot; .
&quot; if there are enough en@@ qui@@ ries , they may be inc@@ lined to add to the menu , &quot; he hopes .
ve@@ gan restaurants evol@@ ve , such as the man@@ n@@ heim com@@ bu@@ st@@ le or the café bird free .
proc@@ tor wishes that other restaurants , too , can serve at least a ve@@ gan dish on the menu .
in fact , ve@@ gan dishes are available for all .
everyone can eat them , so they are exactly the opposite of exclusive .
&quot; meat dishes are exclusive , and are liter@@ ally , because they close other people out , &quot; pro@@ c@@ tor notes .
&quot; if we want to avoid food scand@@ als , ve@@ gan@@ ism is a sure way to protect the vast majority of the population from the outset , &quot; says proc@@ tor .
ve@@ g@@ ans can be a bit difficult to buy at the beginning .
especially when you learn to understand that is also used in pe@@ an@@ u@@ ts animal addi@@ tives as a color gi@@ ver , you seem to be satisfied with adhe@@ rence to the eth@@ ics of so many obstacles and fall quickly out of courage .
not only for this reason , re@@ u@@ ben proc@@ tor and lars th@@ om@@ sen have written a book : &quot; ve@@ gan@@ is@@ sim@@ o - animal ingredients and their alternatives &quot; explains the many ingredients that make food and also cleaning products .
&quot; gradually , you develop a scan@@ ner view and know which characters and lo@@ gos you have to look at &quot; it is sometimes better to do small steps than to stand or st@@ um@@ ble &quot; , says proc@@ tor .
ve@@ gan@@ ism , it is an important moral fing@@ er poin@@ ting to consci@@ ousness .
perhaps he does not quite manage to put his hab@@ its on hold , but at least he can te@@ ach the consumer to cri@@ tically question his hab@@ its .
the exchange operator nas@@ da@@ q om@@ x keeps its customers in bre@@ ath .
trade at the nas@@ da@@ q options market was made on friday afternoon german time .
in a communication the operator made technical problems responsible .
the other 11 us options markets , including two nas@@ da@@ q om@@ x , continued their business un@@ h@@ inde@@ red .
the recent incident involves a whole series of smaller and larger f@@ laws in the stock exchange operator .
only on tuesday the in@@ d@@ ices of nas@@ da@@ q were closed due to errors in data transport for an hour .
in august of this year , two break@@ down@@ s occurred in one week alone .
first , the us investment bank gol@@ d@@ man s@@ ach@@ s had a massive number of fla@@ wed purchase orders to the options markets because of technical problems .
the stock market operators then needed almost a day to process the orders .
two days later , half of the total us equity trade came to the us because of a computer cr@@ ash at the nas@@ da@@ q exchange for several hours .
last year , the stock market of fac@@ e@@ book was also responsible for a sti@@ r .
the nas@@ da@@ q systems were the flo@@ od of sales and purchase orders , and the number of customers was not increasing .
kon@@ stan@@ z : cy@@ cli@@ sts aged 60 years old at the age of 60 are riding around the world for a total of 6@@ 000 .
according to the police , the accident occurred when a 26 year-@@ old man was killed on thursday evening , around 10 p.m. , with a women &apos;s bicycle .
when a 63 year-@@ old man suddenly moved from a local to a place , the cy@@ c@@ list could not be stopped in time , according to the police .
the following col@@ li@@ sion was followed by a push of the pede@@ strian against the wall of the house , later on the floor and moved a 15@@ -@@ cen@@ time@@ ter-@@ long w@@ ound of the square at the head .

british police are issu@@ ing ass@@ ange a delivery statement to the british police to inform him of the ex@@ tradition of the ex@@ tradition of the british police .
the british police have today sent a delivery notification to wi@@ kil@@ ea@@ ks founder ju@@ lian ass@@ ange , who is in the ecu@@ ad@@ ori@@ an emb@@ ass@@ y in london to seek refu@@ ge and seek asylum .
scotland yard explained that the 4@@ 0-@@ year-@@ old austr@@ ali@@ an was being told a “ call to stand ” that would make him appear in a police guard .
ass@@ ange is threat@@ ening ex@@ tradition to sweden for indic@@ tment in a sexual off@@ ence after his possibilities to do so under british law .
he fears that stockholm will send him to the united states , and on 19 june he had a meeting in the ecu@@ ad@@ ori@@ an emb@@ ass@@ y in london to discuss the south american country for political asylum .
scot@@ land yard has been a “ for@@ ty-@@ year-@@ old man who has been asked to sign up at a police guard that we have chosen ” , said a spo@@ kes@@ man .
he continues to viol@@ ate the conditions of his release on ba@@ il .
the message did not make any comment on the delivery of the police request .
ass@@ ange fears that he will be handed over from sweden to the united states and that he will be arrested there for possible sp@@ ying charges after he has received more than 2@@ 50@@ ,000 diplomatic messages at the rev@@ el@@ ation website wi@@ kil@@ ea@@ ks .

tax on foreign property owners against london ’ s spec@@ u@@ lative bu@@ b@@ ble
the treas@@ ury has provi@@ sion@@ ally sc@@ aled the c@@ g@@ t measure , but is still waiting for the final decision of chancell@@ or george os@@ bor@@ ne to replace the c@@ g@@ t in 2012 .
already , the revenue from the st@@ amp tax on residential property in west@@ min@@ ster and ken@@ sing@@ ton &amp; ch@@ el@@ sea districts , which is the largest in the fiscal year 2012 / 13 , is 7@@ 08 million p@@ ounds , ear@@ marked .
co@@ ok said : “ after the increases in the st@@ amp tax on high-@@ price housing and the introduction of the associated legislation can be avoided .
“ but this move could make some foreign investors more cau@@ tious about buying property in london , or dis@@ courage owners from selling it , ” he added .
first class real estate – the top five to ten percent of the housing market at a price – in the weal@@ thy south west bel@@ t in london , which stret@@ ches from ful@@ ham to w@@ im@@ ble@@ don , has grown around the re@@ ef .
prices in central london were growing at a level of 5.@@ 6 % per year , but were accompanied by rising “ domestic ” markets .
scientists have been able to sh@@ ed more light on the connection between the pregn@@ ancy of a dog and its mo@@ od .
previous research showed that happy dogs with the tail are more right than they are ( from the point of view of the dog ) , while ner@@ vous dogs are more likely to be left .
but now scientists say that other dogs per@@ cei@@ ve these sub@@ tle differences and can respond to them .
professor geor@@ gio v@@ all@@ or@@ ti@@ gar@@ a , a neu@@ ros@@ ci@@ enti@@ st from the university of tren@@ to , said : “ man knows well that the left and right half of the brain react differently to stimul@@ i , which are positive or negative . ”
we have tried to address this in other species .
he also noticed that in dogs , just as in humans , the right half of the brain is responsible for the movement of the left side and vice vers@@ a , and that the two h@@ emis@@ p@@ he@@ res played different roles in emo@@ tions .
to learn more about how dogs are pus@@ hed to the side of the tail , please check the dog &apos;s page .
it measures the heart rate of the four leg@@ s and analy@@ zed the behavior .
we will probably soon understand why the co@@ ck is in one , one direction , another .
professor v@@ all@@ or@@ ti@@ gar@@ a said : “ we have been showing dogs films with dogs – either a natural version or a sil@@ hou@@ ette to make di@@ str@@ action other aspects .
when the animals saw a mu@@ ch-@@ de@@ pressing dog suc@@ king the co@@ ck to the right ( from the perspective of the bo@@ iling dog ) , they b@@ ore the whole thing in a relaxed state .
but was the inc@@ lin@@ ation mainly to the left ( again from the perspective of the dog , who we@@ ars ) , so their heart rate rose and they saw un@@ easy .
according to professor v@@ all@@ or@@ ti@@ gar@@ a , the dogs do not deliber@@ ately communicate with each other through these movements .
he is convinced that the dogs have learned from experience which movements they are wor@@ ried about and when not .
he said , ‘ if you have different encoun@@ ters with other dogs and you want to w@@ ound with the tail in one direction , you have to be friendly and the right side is more like a less friendly behavior , then you respond on the basis . ’
researchers say that the findings have been passed on to owners of dogs , ve@@ ts and co@@ aches to help them understand the emo@@ tions of their animal .
john br@@ ad@@ sha@@ w , expert in dog behaviour and guest schol@@ ar@@ ship at the fac@@ ul@@ ty of animal medicine at the university of bri@@ st@@ ol , declared that this was not the first study to be studied whether links were being accepted .
last year , a team from l@@ inc@@ ol@@ n university found out that dogs are turning their heads to the left when they have to look at an aggres@@ sive dog , and right when it is a satisfied dog .
in another research work at the university of victori@@ a in canada , the following stated : “ dogs are more likely to go to a robo@@ t dog if his tail is left we@@ aring and not right instead of un@@ easy .
according to his statement , the differences could stem from the fact that the dogs in the various studies were the animals in the films or the robo@@ t dogs not interpreted as dogs .
a study on how dogs react to real dogs could help , he explained .
“ while there is considerable evidence of many different m@@ am@@ m@@ als that the two hal@@ ves of the brain are used for different purposes , many of the details still need to be determined – and dogs are no exception , ” says br@@ ad@@ ds@@ w .
but as their behavior is easy to record , it will probably not take long before we understand why the co@@ ck sometimes turns into one , sometimes into another .

po@@ pe franc@@ is ap@@ points the first car@@ din@@ als in february .
po@@ pe franc@@ is will be publishing new car@@ din@@ als of the catho@@ lic church on 22 february , as the v@@ ati@@ can announced on thursday .
car@@ din@@ als are the highest cl@@ er@@ ics in the catho@@ lic church after the po@@ pe and they are also the ones who make a po@@ pe , so that francis@@ c@@ us can be the first group of men .
there are currently 20@@ 1 car@@ din@@ als .
however , a car@@ din@@ al reaching 80 years can no longer be part of the po@@ pe ’ s election – a group of 120 “ elec@@ tor@@ ate . ”
in a statement in which the message was announced , father feder@@ ico l@@ om@@ bar@@ di , a spo@@ kes@@ man of the v@@ ati@@ can , said that there would be a meeting of all car@@ din@@ als before the cere@@ mony was held .
&quot; po@@ pe franc@@ is has decided to post@@ p@@ one his decision to conven@@ e the story in february in advance , so that other meetings that will allow the participation of car@@ din@@ als from all over the world can be planned . &quot;
j@@ ack val@@ ero of ca@@ th@@ ic vo@@ ices said that the number of eligible car@@ din@@ als by february is likely to have fallen .
he declared that a po@@ pe normally ap@@ points as many car@@ din@@ als as needed to keep the number of car@@ din@@ als entitled to vote 120 again , and so many car@@ din@@ als over 80 , as he would like .
next year &apos;s consistency is therefore important because it is the first since the election of francis@@ c@@ us in march this year , so val@@ er@@ o .
there is currently a certain over@@ han@@ g on the part of europe and , in particular , italy .
“ it will be interesting to see whether the new po@@ pe will be car@@ din@@ als from the rest of the world to restore balance , ” he said .
for@@ ty percent of ca@@ th@@ ol@@ ics live in south america , but they have only a tiny number of car@@ din@@ als .
the car@@ din@@ als will also be the first to be created since the creation of the council of car@@ din@@ als , founded by franc@@ is , a group of eight car@@ din@@ als from around the world who are responsible for the work .
in the past , the po@@ pe decided everything alone .
&quot; now , franc@@ is has chosen these eight car@@ din@@ als to help him , &quot; said val@@ ero .
he said that it is “ possible ” that franc@@ is was the car@@ din@@ als for advice .
but so far we have not been in this position – that is all new .
val@@ ero said that typically the bis@@ ho@@ ps from large places become car@@ din@@ als , but ste@@ c@@ ke franc@@ is is “ full of surpris@@ es – we know not to whom he is appointed .
g@@ m calls new pic@@ k@@ up tr@@ uc@@ ks in the usa to repair the seat back@@ rest .
general mo@@ tors call almost 19@@ ,000 of his brand new ch@@ ev@@ ro@@ let sil@@ ver@@ ado and g@@ m@@ c sier@@ ra pic@@ k@@ up tr@@ uc@@ ks built in 20@@ 14 to solve a problem with the manual se@@ at@@ bel@@ t .
some of the cars may have a def@@ ect in the mechanism for the re@@ stra@@ int of the front seat back@@ rest .
for this reason , they do not comply with the federal regulations on vehicle safety in head@@ re@@ sts .
“ when the vehicle is mounted from the back , it is possible that the head re@@ stra@@ int is not properly protecting the occup@@ ants , so that there is an increased risk of in@@ jury , ” the news was on the national highway website .

the desper@@ ation cr@@ y of an obama elec@@ tor
i have twice elected president obama in the hope that change is possible .
he says that obama has made a lau@@ dable effort to address the problems of republic@@ ans ’ bloc@@ k@@ ade .
the bloc@@ king policy does not exc@@ use the site problems of ob@@ am@@ ac@@ are , the dr@@ one attacks , the dr@@ one attacks , the dr@@ one attacks and the other side attacks .
obama ’ s mem@@ o@@ irs of the 2008 election campaign are a sad remin@@ der of what could have been possible .
na@@ than@@ i@@ el p. mor@@ r@@ is is a student in the second year at har@@ v@@ ard medical school .
i am currently reading a terri@@ bly sad book .
it is a book that i thought it would help me to be able to find a way to help me during the dec@@ ep@@ tive second year of my medical studies .
it is called the aud@@ acity to win ( courage to win ) and describes the mem@@ o@@ irs bar@@ ack obama ’ s presidential election in 2008 .
when i talk to the patient in the evening and go to bed , the book will take me back to a time when politics inspired millions and gave the go@@ d@@ d@@ ess to talk .
the election was turned into a lands@@ li@@ de victory and news spo@@ kes@@ men held in order to show the historical significance of this hour .
my class@@ mates we@@ pt with joy and my parents collected all the newspapers they could find .
a young team of vi@@ sion@@ aries was on the way to the white house and the nation was ready for change .
when obama came into office in 2008 , he had received approval rat@@ ings of 82 % .
and then i close the book .
swit@@ ching back to the present is a bad awa@@ k@@ ening as if you are being tor@@ n out of a dream .
it is difficult to remember these optim@@ istic times – they seem to be a v@@ ague memory , a sad remin@@ der of missed opportunities .
in the years since i first voted , there has indeed been a change .
but it is simply not something i could have imag@@ ined .
i recognise the great and diverse things that obama has achieved , from adopting the aff@@ or@@ da treaty to adopting the eu ’ s health insurance scheme to military withdrawal from the iraq war , the end of the en@@ forced dis@@ appeared .
i agree that the par@@ tis@@ an bloc@@ k@@ ade approach is too ambitious .
but , having heard the obama administration countless times over colleagues and acqu@@ a@@ int@@ ances , i am not happy with my attempts to explain .
i have reached a point of political des@@ pair .
republic@@ an bloc@@ k@@ ade policy cannot explain why it is not possible to stop foreign heads of state inter@@ cep@@ ting or to stop the killing of inno@@ cent children by dr@@ ones over@@ seas .
it cannot explain why the national security agency has made data available on the private lives of americans and why wh@@ ist@@ le@@ b@@ low@@ ers , the state &apos;s mis@@ conduct , are being pun@@ ished .
it cannot explain why an@@ war al-@@ aw@@ la@@ ki , an american citizen , was mur@@ dered without trial , nor why public funding and public spending programmes were closed during the presidential election .
it does not justify the results of a report which states that the white house &apos;s efforts to calm the media are the “ most aggres@@ sive ... since the ni@@ x@@ on government . ”
recently , it cannot exc@@ use the in@@ ability to make progress in the more than three years since the adoption of the affir@@ ma@@ tive care act , a simple website .
i do not know if that is what i should have expected .
whether i should have understood by 18 that the government ’ s work contradic@@ ts the political campaigns that prece@@ ded it .
obviously , the position of the me@@ p is not a predic@@ table one , since an opposition party and ran@@ dom events such as the new@@ town mass@@ ac@@ re shape public debate .
but if i look at the examples mentioned above , they seem to be largely chosen by the government itself .
and that bo@@ thers me most .
i re-@@ elected obama in 2012 , not because i was enthusi@@ astic about his candi@@ d@@ acy .
mit@@ t ro@@ m@@ ney was a conf@@ using and un@@ sophisticated alternative , he seemed to be moving in the direction and positions he was in .
i had the impression that obama had a second term , free of pressure from future elections , would fulfil the hope that we have heard of for so long .
but , with the decline in approval values for obama to below 45 % this week , the return to 2008 by this book has become all the har@@ der .
it awa@@ k@@ ens my long@@ ing for the many promises that have dis@@ appeared into th@@ in air .
this week i read a section in the book that describes how obama could make a serious loss against clin@@ ton in the pen@@ n@@ sy@@ l@@ v@@ ania pre-@@ election .
in a meeting with the election workers following the decision , he told his staff that they had to get back on track and follow the purpose of their cause .
“ i want us to re@@ discover our magic , ” he said .
we must remember who we are .
five years later , mr president , i could not give you more support .
the views expressed in this comment are exclusively those of na@@ than@@ i@@ el mor@@ r@@ is .
cli@@ ve pal@@ mer claims that prime minister ton@@ y ab@@ bot@@ t has raised conflict of interest in paren@@ tal leave with prime minister ton@@ y ab@@ bot@@ t .
the bil@@ li@@ on@@ air@@ e and member cli@@ ve pal@@ mer says that prime minister ton@@ y ab@@ bot@@ t is in conflict of interest in his paren@@ tal leave plans because his dau@@ gh@@ ters are pregn@@ ant and could therefore benefit from them .
the mining mag@@ n@@ at , which was found in a court dispute over the payment of $ 6 million in co2 tax , claimed that the mining mag@@ n@@ at was wi@@ ping off the table asking whether it was in conflict .
the pal@@ mer united party could hold up to four votes in the sen@@ ate , which are important for deci@@ ding whether the co2 and mining taxes should be cut or cut .
but pal@@ mer claimed that only ministers could have conflicts of interest and the dau@@ gh@@ ters of ab@@ bot@@ t would benefit personally from the laws .
“ he is in a great conflict of interest when it comes to paid paren@@ tal leave , because if one of his dau@@ gh@@ ters becomes pregn@@ ant , he has a direct interest in whether or not she receives holidays , ” said pal@@ mer .
two months after the election , pal@@ mer ’ s electoral commission declared the election with 53 votes in the lead after the re@@ count the official winner of the sun@@ shine co@@ ast seat of fair@@ fax .
pal@@ mer called for a revision of the voting count process to be carried out more quickly .
ton@@ y ab@@ bot@@ t ’ s dau@@ gh@@ ters fran@@ ces and brid@@ get .
if these elections are held two months after the end of the vote ?
“ we need a better system , ” he said .
why should we not have a system in which we inv@@ ade , transfer the data into a computer , immediately choose and then press the data on the table at 6.@@ 30 a.m.
pal@@ mer also cri@@ tici@@ zed the use of p@@ enc@@ ils when marking bal@@ lot papers .
use them because they can then er@@ ase the results if you don &apos;t like them ?
it is incredible to vote with p@@ ens today .
the electoral commission has examined the options for an electronic election and recently adopted a joint legislative proposal with new ze@@ al@@ and .
pal@@ mer , 59 , explained that to its policy an international airport for the sun@@ shine coast belong@@ ed and that he had to leave his new office “ very seriously . ”
a public office is about public service .
“ we are not seeking any re@@ ward other than that of history , namely that we can serve in a critical time of this community , ” he said .
r@@ bs sus@@ pending two foreign exchange trad@@ ers
the royal bank of scotland has two trad@@ ers from its foreign exchange department suspended , so two people are familiar with the situation ; this is another indication of how the bank &apos;s global regulatory in@@ qui@@ ries are mu@@ tually sup@@ por@@ tive .
some of the world ’ s largest banks , including u@@ bs , bar@@ cla@@ ys , deutsche bank , and r@@ bs , confirmed that they had been in contact with the authorities in the world ’ s largest financial market , with 5.@@ 3 tr@@ il@@ lion dollars a day .
the two deal@@ ers would be the first r@@ bs employees to be suspended in the expanding investigation that followed the scand@@ al of the lib@@ or inter@@ bank business .
the bank , which has no comment on the sus@@ pensions , confirmed this month that it will be able to receive requests for information from authorities .
“ our investigations on this subject are continuing and we are fully co@@ operating with the f@@ ca and other regulatory authorities , ” said the bank two weeks ago .
last month , people close to the situation indicated that the r@@ bs would not receive the records of em@@ ail@@ s and inst@@ ant messages sent by and to a former trad@@ er .
this trad@@ er , richard us@@ her , had left r@@ bs 2010 and is now expected to move from his current position as european head of fore@@ x spot trading at j@@ p@@ mor@@ gan .
ro@@ h@@ an ram@@ ch@@ and@@ ani , head of the european spot trading at cit@@ i , was de@@ tained this week and mat@@ t gar@@ din@@ er , form@@ erly the chief currency deal@@ er at bar@@ cla@@ ys and u@@ bs , was awarded standard .
none of these trad@@ ers were accused of any mis@@ conduct .
the inst@@ ant message group of us@@ her included ban@@ kers at bar@@ cla@@ ys and ci@@ ti@@ group , said the people close to the situation .
u@@ bs announced this week that they have taken steps against some of their employees after the swiss regulatory authority fin@@ ma declared that it had committed a alleg@@ ed man@@ ip@@ ulation of the foreign exchange market in a number of swiss banks .
at least six authorities worldwide – the european commission , fin@@ ma , the swiss competition authority we@@ ko , the f@@ ca , the us ministry of justice and the hong kong monetary authority – are currently engaged in acc@@ us@@ ations that are not being made .
h@@ s@@ bc , ci@@ ti@@ group , j@@ p@@ mor@@ gan and credit su@@ is@@ se have also initiated internal investigations or received information requests from authorities , said with the situation familiar persons .
banks get inst@@ ant messages and em@@ ail@@ s from several years in search of cases of mis@@ conduct .
the news of these investigations has sti@@ r@@ red up trad@@ ers in an area that has become one of the most prof@@ itable of trad@@ ing-@@ units of investment firms in recent years , but this year under pressure .
some ban@@ kers have tried to play down the aff@@ air and said that it is almost impossible to avoid the vast and highly liquid financial markets that are now in the process of being explo@@ ited by leading trad@@ ers .
a leading trad@@ er noted that despite the enormous daily volume of foreign exchange trading , the frag@@ ment@@ ation of liqui@@ dity between the various trading platforms and the growing demand for own exchange services has increased by banks .
the message came out the same day , when credit su@@ is@@ se announced that it had sent a deal@@ er in its london exchange tr@@ aded funds office this week after he had left the bank with a loss of just under $ 6 million at the end of last year .
the bank promp@@ tly informed the competent authorities and co@@ operates with them .
“ we are sure that the trad@@ er has acted alone and that the matter is contained , ” said credit su@@ is@@ se .
the building f@@ ence on the be@@ ch@@ t@@ le p@@ lot pain@@ ts the f@@ ence on the be@@ ch@@ t@@ le p@@ lot .
a group of citizens &apos; initiative &quot; swiss me@@ ado@@ w &quot; has launched the f@@ ence on the bec@@ h@@ tle p@@ lot on the spa promen@@ ade in bad her@@ ren@@ al@@ b .
in addition , it clean@@ ed and broad@@ ened the foot@@ path , as stated in a press release .
the planned covering of the dec@@ ay@@ ing house in the back of the p@@ lot was not allowed for security reasons , because the site is threatened to sli@@ p .
al@@ f@@ red ab@@ el , who currently man@@ ages the property , had the beauti@@ fication action with his colleague rein@@ hard dom@@ ke of the bi .
before the bi &apos;s action was a transparent with the message &quot; we are for it &quot; was given .
this distur@@ bed the roughly 20 members of the citizens &apos; initiative , however , little in their action .
your mo@@ tto on the big pos@@ ter was &quot; we are against ru@@ ins of the building &quot; .
in doing so , it wanted to avoid the risk of even larger ru@@ ins on the swiss me@@ ado@@ w - should the giant project fail one day .
in con@@ vers@@ ation with many pas@@ ser@@ s-@@ by before the construction site , it became clear that some people believe that the re@@ alisation of the city &apos;s project will be better for many , although not a few have the same questions on the dimension of the presented project .
but they are beginning to re@@ signed because the city is further dela@@ ying these responses , the bi says .
as has been said , the public statements by the may@@ or are also working .
may was said at the council that he would not use the thermal bath .
some therefore seem to be quite fri@@ ghten@@ ed , others per@@ cei@@ ve it as a &apos; cru@@ de attempt at black@@ mail &apos; by the population , as the bi &apos;s press release continues .
the bi than@@ ked the don@@ or for the color and all the help@@ ers .

&quot; a bl@@ at@@ ant mis@@ decision , &quot; ran@@ gn@@ ick said , the re@@ fe@@ ree har@@ k@@ am described as &quot; totally over@@ stret@@ ched &quot; .
har@@ k@@ am would also have contributed &quot; to the es@@ cal@@ ation between salzburg co@@ ach ro@@ ger sch@@ mid@@ t and gr@@ ö@@ di@@ g tra@@ iner ad@@ i h@@ ü@@ t@@ ter after the match .
he def@@ ended his german comp@@ at@@ ri@@ ot deci@@ de@@ dly : &quot; i would have acted in every situation as well as ro@@ ger sch@@ mid@@ t &quot; .

i do not know why .
&quot; for i am the one who was insul@@ ted , &quot; the 4@@ 6-@@ year-@@ old stressed .
in view of the success , ran@@ gn@@ ick agreed to a pra@@ yer hy@@ m@@ n .
&quot; there are only two words for this : really good , &quot; he said .
there is not much to be said .
the way in which the team plays is particularly impressive .
that is a good thing to continue .
the winter transfer time changes will hardly be the case .
there are no great reasons to change anything .
&quot; except for a player , he or she desi@@ res to leave the club , &quot; ran@@ gn@@ ick made clear .
supreme court confir@@ ms obama ’ s health law
it is a great victory for the obama administration : the us supreme court decided today that the us was closely linked to bar@@ ack obama ’ s health law .
by five votes to four , the jud@@ ges rul@@ ed that the patient ’ s individual mandate was to protect and affordable care act – it forces us citizens to wait until 20@@ 14 for health insurance or to pun@@ ish .
chief judge john ro@@ ber@@ ts proposed to side with the four more liberal members of the chamber , while jud@@ ges sc@@ alia , thomas , ali@@ to , and ken@@ ne@@ dy decided against .
the court also confirmed the remaining sections of the 27@@ 00 pages law and also represented the view that the pre@@ ference for the health act , according to which states must either meet the conditions of access to medic@@ aid or else meet all public health requirements .
the law@@ suit was brought by 26 states and the national federation of independent states .
the law was signed by all leading republic@@ an presidential candidates , including the event@@ ual challeng@@ er mit@@ t ro@@ m@@ ney , in the 2012 pre-@@ election campaign .

post does not leave on sun@@ days
&quot; many citizens will not have noticed the red points for sunday afternoon tea .
a f@@ dp request has confirmed this .
on sun@@ days and public holidays , only before the post office building in the ern@@ st lu@@ d@@ wi@@ g-@@ stra@@ ß@@ e 36 and in the j@@ ak@@ ob@@ -@@ m@@ ü@@ ll@@ er-@@ stra@@ ß@@ e 1 in h@@ ü@@ t@@ ten@@ fel@@ d are emp@@ ti@@ ed .
whether in ho@@ f@@ heim and ro@@ sen@@ gar@@ ten is also emp@@ ti@@ ed sunday , the answer to the f@@ dp ’ s question will not be answered .
the social and youth policy spo@@ kes@@ man of the f@@ dp , fr@@ it@@ z ro@@ h@@ ren@@ bec@@ k , wants to follow suit .
sunday cleaning is a very important post service at termin@@ post .
&quot; this company thin@@ ks of this despite the increase in the price of letters on january 2013 rad@@ ically and un@@ reasonable &quot; .
thomas bit@@ t@@ ner , group and city council chairman of the liber@@ als , supports his group colleague , &apos; what an@@ no@@ ys me is the fact that there are k@@ lam@@ m@@ ingly no longer changes or even increased periods of emp@@ t@@ ying . &apos;
the post office is a long way from the people &apos;s point of view .
&quot; at least the mail boxes in the districts of neu@@ ch@@ â@@ tel and ro@@ sen@@ gar@@ ten must be emp@@ ti@@ ed again on sun@@ days &quot; , says bit@@ t@@ ner and ro@@ h@@ ren@@ bec@@ k un@@ is@@ on@@ o .
the city of the heart , too , is the case , especially not mobile citizens , with a sunday empty post box , also having to be reached by foot .

google , sam@@ sung , hu@@ a@@ we@@ i for nor@@ tel patents su@@ ed .
the group , which has thousands of previous nor@@ tel patents , made a av@@ al@@ an@@ che of complaints on thursday about patent infringement against mobile phone manufacturers , including google , the company that was not present at the in@@ solv@@ ency increase .
ro@@ ck@@ star , the con@@ sor@@ ti@@ um that holds the nor@@ tel patents for $ 4.@@ 5 billion , su@@ ed sam@@ sung electronics to the court of auditors .
ro@@ ck@@ star is owned by apple , microsoft , black@@ ber@@ ry , er@@ ic@@ s@@ son and sony .
google is accused of patent infringement in seven cases .
patents cover technology that uses search terms on the internet with relevant advertising .
sam@@ sung , hu@@ a@@ we@@ i , ht@@ c and ro@@ ck@@ star representatives were not directly accessible .
sam@@ sung , hu@@ a@@ we@@ i and ht@@ c produce mobile phones that are compatible with google &apos;s and@@ ro@@ id operating system , which is in sharp competition with mobile products from apple and microsoft .
in 2011 , google gave an initial bid of $ 9@@ 00 million for the nor@@ tel patents .
google increased its offer several times and last offered 4.@@ 4 billion dollars .
after the nor@@ tel patents of ro@@ ck@@ star out@@ bid it , google acquired motor@@ ola mobility for 12@@ ,@@ 5 billion dollars , a deal that was also sold to some motor@@ ola &apos;s library .
“ although google failed in its attempt to ban the patent for legal action at the au@@ ction , google has infring@@ ed the patents and continues to do so , ” said the law@@ yer .
ro@@ ck@@ star claims a high level of compensation from google , as it claims that google ’ s patent infringement is deliber@@ ate , so the acc@@ us@@ ation .
egypt s@@ wor@@ n the first freely elected president
mo@@ ham@@ med mor@@ si is de@@ ferring the o@@ ath of office , but his day of tri@@ um@@ ph should not be the end of political disputes in egypt .
the islam@@ ist mo@@ ham@@ med mor@@ si promised a “ new egypt ” when he was the first freely elected president of the country , thus bringing the succ@@ ession of hus@@ ni mu@@ bar@@ ak to power .
with his in@@ aug@@ ur@@ ation in the supreme constitutional court , mor@@ si was also elected the first freely elected islam@@ ist president of the arab world and egypt ’ s fifth head of state since the fall of the mon@@ arch@@ y around 60 years ago .
he put the o@@ ath before the 18 black ro@@ bes dres@@ sed jud@@ ges of the court , which is located at the n@@ ile and dedicated to an ancient egyp@@ tian temple .
“ we are stri@@ ving for a better future , a new egypt and a second republic , ” mor@@ si said at the cere@@ mony that was broad@@ cast live on state television .
“ today , the egyp@@ tian people have laid the foundations for a new life – absolute freedom , a true democracy and stability , ” said the 6@@ 0-@@ year-@@ old mor@@ si , a us trained engine@@ er and a member of the muslim bro@@ ther@@ hood .
hundreds of soldiers and police guar@@ ded the building when mor@@ si was in or@@ t@@ sh@@ ire shortly after 11 o &apos;@@ clock in a small auto@@ con@@ vo@@ y .
only a few hundred sup@@ porters had gathered in court to listen to the new president , and , unlike the presidential pr@@ un@@ k , the mu@@ bar@@ ak era was not allowed to take off for a while , so that the car could be used .
as an un@@ char@@ is@@ matic “ replacement wheel ” of the bro@@ ther@@ hood , his personal presti@@ ge has been a source of increasing power since his victory and a friday speech , in which he has not only been a candidate for the islam@@ ists , but all .

rap@@ es in south africa : two life imprison@@ ment
nine months after the brut@@ al ra@@ pe and mu@@ ti@@ lation of a 17@@ -@@ year-@@ old girl in south africa , the perpe@@ tr@@ ator was sent@@ enced to two life@@ time sent@@ ences on friday .
the sen@@ der sab@@ c reported this .
the victim was later killed by the consequences of the severe in@@ jur@@ ies .
joh@@ ann@@ es k@@ ana was already guil@@ ty at the beginning of the week of crime .
the fact caused hor@@ ror nation@@ wide .
the then 2@@ 1-@@ year-@@ old had an@@ ene boo@@ y@@ sen in february in an industrial site in bre@@ d@@ as@@ dor@@ p near cape town .
the doctors fought for the survival of the victim for 14 hours , but in v@@ ain .
the sight of young people was so app@@ alling that the care@@ rs and si@@ sters needed psycho@@ logical assistance .
k@@ ana ad@@ mitted during the trial that he had bo@@ om@@ ed in a bar at night .
he also conf@@ essed to be@@ aten and rap@@ ed them , but he denied to pay for the death of the girl .
the police had initially assumed several off@@ enders , but dis@@ missed two susp@@ ects from prison because the evidence against them was not sufficient .
the prosecu@@ tor also stressed during the trial that it was convinced that k@@ ana was not able to do anything at the time of the attack .
ra@@ pe is almost a daily oc@@ curren@@ ce in south africa : there are around 64 000 indic@@ ations of sexual violence every year .
that is almost ten times the figure in germany , but it is a lot more popu@@ lated than south africa ( 50 million ) , with 82 million people .
police and women &apos;s associations in south africa es@@ timate the number of people in the event of sexual violence to be 10-@@ 25 times .
jum@@ bo visits the black forest ham , ham , and the red sea .
jum@@ bo looking for the &quot; best ham of the world &quot; : for the tv show &quot; galile@@ o &quot; visited the pro@@ 7-@@ star bon@@ n@@ dorf .
the speaker makes it clear at the outset that the most important thing for ham is the pi@@ g cul@@ ls , tur@@ bom@@ ast is not a good pre@@ condition .
can ham that you can get in any super@@ market , i.e. be a quality product ?
ul@@ i , the head of the large ham factory in the black forest , explains how jum@@ bo works with the company &quot; ad@@ ler &quot; in bon@@ n@@ dorf .
&quot; germany &apos;s favourite ham &quot; , as jum@@ bo wrote about the black forest ham .
only with hair protection and kit@@ tel he comes into the interior of the factory .

television with level ?
details such as ph value of the meat play a role .
the dar@@ ker the meat , the higher the ph value .
&quot; i am cur@@ ious if your ro@@ ber@@ to blan@@ co measures what happens then &quot; , jum@@ bo zy@@ n@@ is@@ ch says .
this is where the level of private television is presented in pure culture .
but watching is worth watching .
the spec@@ t@@ ator sees that the dis@@ assembly of the cul@@ ls is still hand@@ -@@ cra@@ fted .
because black forests ham is tradi@@ tionally available on the shel@@ f without b@@ ones .
the secret of ham is the sp@@ ic@@ y mix@@ ture with salt .
smo@@ ke tower and smo@@ ke fire remind jum@@ bo vis@@ ually of a &quot; sub@@ marine &quot; .
the tr@@ ick : f@@ ir branches provide the special flav@@ or of black forest ham in the smo@@ ke .
20 days in the smo@@ ke make the ham almost black .
&quot; now the dis@@ c dis@@ appears in jum@@ bo , &quot; he announ@@ ces the test fe@@ eding .
&quot; he &apos;s really delicious &quot; , according to the conclusion of the tv star .
this will allow all parties to live with it .
they thought that travel agencies are a thing of the past thanks to the internet ?
flight centre seems to be resi@@ sting the trend .
the company has increased its profit prospects for the year as a whole and exp@@ ects record income from holi@@ day@@ makers in australia and the uk .
the travel company now exp@@ ects a adjusted annual profit before taxes between 3@@ 25 and 3@@ 40 million dollars , compared to 30@@ 5 to 3@@ 15 million dollars in its earlier forec@@ ast .
if the current targets are met , that will mean growth of 12 to 17 % compared to the record gain of 2@@ 9@@ 0.@@ 4 million dollars in the period 2011 / 12 .
as managing director gra@@ ham tur@@ ner announced , flight centre achieved eight percent profit in the first half of the year and a strong start in the second half , especially in australia and the uk .
“ since the beginning of the year , our ten countries have been prof@@ itable , and some of them are well on track to record annual revenues before interest and taxes , ” he said .
these include australia and the united kingdom , which are typically among our strong@@ est ear@@ ners .
in australia , the leisure industry has reco@@ vered in the second half of the year , which is a slightly weak@@ er business travel market .
it was similarly good for the leisure business of flight centre in the uk , while business customers were spending less here as well .
the us business reco@@ vered from its weak@@ er first half year in seas@@ on-@@ related terms , and thus generated a gain for the full year for the third con@@ secu@@ tive year .
the shares of flight centre rose by 3 c@@ ents to $ 3@@ 8.@@ 20 yesterday .
schools will focus more on mathem@@ a@@ tics , sp@@ elling , and gram@@ mar .
in courses on english literature , pu@@ pil@@ s will have to learn at least one piece of sha@@ kes@@ pe@@ are , a novel of the n@@ ine@@ teenth century , romantic ly@@ ric@@ s and contemporary british nov@@ els from 19@@ 14 .
the test also includes “ un@@ seen texts ” to help read more widely .
the combined course of english literature and language is abol@@ ished .
from 20@@ 15 , students will have to submit a separate g@@ c@@ se test for language , with strong incentives to use english literature as a separate quali@@ fication .
the ministry of education will tomorrow present the new cur@@ ricul@@ a for english and mathem@@ a@@ tics – the first subjects that have been rad@@ ically re@@ designed .
other core subjects will be changed next year .
in a separate initiative , of@@ qu@@ al , the aud@@ iting authority , will propose a re@@ organisation of the g@@ c@@ se structures , including a new ben@@ ot@@ ation system and less exchange rate work .
in a summer speech , education minister michael go@@ ve said that there is a “ broad consensus that we need to reform our audit system to restore public confidence , ” emphasi@@ sing that the g-@@ cc ’ s “ exit from the cold . ”
studies show that english schools have less time for mathem@@ a@@ tics – 1@@ 16 hours per year or three hours a week per school year – than most other countries .
by contrast , austr@@ ali@@ an schools te@@ ach an average of 14@@ 3 hours a year and students in sing@@ apor@@ e receive 13@@ 8 hours .
although there will be no formal requirement to spend more time on mathem@@ a@@ tics in the timetable , coalition members will not be able to use the comprehensive mathem@@ a@@ tics test , combined with a stronger weigh@@ ting of the subject .
the cur@@ ricul@@ um focuses more on “ real life problems ” , including financial mathem@@ a@@ tics .

the next ec@@ um@@ en@@ ical forum on monday 21 october in the new museum of the castle is about the topic &quot; hel@@ l with hel@@ l - the@@ ological considerations on how to deal with the last things &quot; .
professor is professor joh@@ anna ra@@ h@@ ner .
the ec@@ um@@ en@@ ical forum is an initiative of the catho@@ lic and ev@@ angel@@ ical church communities of sal@@ em , the castle of sal@@ em and the k@@ ul@@ tur@@ am@@ tes bo@@ den@@ see@@ kre@@ is .
joh@@ anna ra@@ h@@ ner wants to discuss in the forum the question of how people can now see the &quot; last things &quot; after death .
if people had bene@@ fi@@ ted too much from this in the past centuries , and had been put on the images of heav@@ en and hel@@ l , &apos; which are still our ideas &apos; , contemporary pro@@ p@@ he@@ tic teaching is characterized by the teach@@ ings of the people .
&quot; the greater hope is christi@@ ans through the critique of religion , sufficiently ex@@ al@@ ted , &quot; says the speaker .
you have provided us with so many question marks that the ex@@ cl@@ am@@ ation signs have been lost to us .
joh@@ anna ra@@ h@@ ner continues to say : &quot; but the crucial challenge remains the an@@ ger of death &quot; .
this raises the question of the long@@ ing for &apos; dre@@ aming that everything should be good in the end &apos; .
joh@@ anna ra@@ h@@ ner , born in bad@@ en-@@ ba@@ den in 196@@ 2 , studied catho@@ lic the@@ ology and bio@@ logy at the al@@ bert lu@@ d@@ wi@@ gs@@ -@@ university fre@@ i@@ burg from 198@@ 2 to 1989 .
she received her doc@@ tor@@ ate in 1997 as dr. the@@ ol . , also in fre@@ i@@ burg .
the hab@@ ilitation of fundament@@ als the@@ ology and ec@@ um@@ en@@ ical the@@ ology followed in 2003 at the west@@ ph@@ ali@@ an wil@@ hel@@ ms university .

ge@@ is@@ ling@@ en : more than 100 young ca@@ th@@ ol@@ ics from the little he@@ u@@ berg confirm their faith in the fir@@ m@@ ament during the fir@@ ming of the church .
in two services , 10@@ 1 15@@ -@@ year-@@ old and 16@@ -@@ year-@@ old te@@ en@@ ag@@ ers of the se@@ af@@ aring unit at the kle@@ ine heu@@ berg have been fir@@ med .
the service of the holy mass accompanied the lau@@ dat@@ o-@@ si group in the morning , the youth cho@@ ir the spirit in the afternoon .
with the reception of the firm , young people said yes to their b@@ ap@@ tism and asked for the power of the holy spirit .
the fir@@ m@@ l@@ ings have been in the last few months , under the direction of di@@ ak@@ on rein@@ er stre@@ h@@ ner and the assistance of numerous community members for the great festival .
in various projects , they learned different tasks of christian community life and together experienced the youth day in un@@ ter@@ mach@@ tal .
ill@@ men@@ see : second mountain bike race en@@ th@@ uses participants in the mountain bike race and en@@ th@@ uses participants in the second mountain bike race .
in good weather 2@@ 14 cy@@ cli@@ sts came to ill@@ men@@ see to complete the tour across the hills around the lake .
this will inform ul@@ rich kno@@ bel of the organis@@ ing sports club ill@@ men@@ see .
among the participants were , especially at short distance of more than 15 kilometers and 300 meters of al@@ titude , numerous je@@ der@@ man@@ n@@ s@@ rad@@ ers who once used their ho@@ b@@ by in competition atmosphere .
two german junior drivers were in this race as well : fe@@ li@@ x ba@@ der from bad wal@@ d@@ see and pas@@ cal tre@@ u@@ bel from as@@ ach@@ -@@ lin@@ z came with the recommendation to have a good place at the german champion@@ ships .
these two could , as expected , move away from the field .
as in the previous year , fe@@ li@@ x bad@@ er was able to save a small time lead to the finish and def@@ ended his title as a total winner of short distance .
in second place , pas@@ cal was again able to play tr@@ us@@ te@@ es@@ hi@@ p .
the ladies were the@@ res@@ a du@@ ell@@ i of team night@@ m@@ are , who made it to the top of the winning sta@@ dium .
in second and third place anne ade@@ l from ill@@ men@@ see and leon@@ ie drivers from ow@@ ingen .
one positive development is the increasing number of drivers who are living in the community or working .
not only in terms of performance , the range of athle@@ tes was represented .
the age structure was also sufficient for the youn@@ g@@ est to over 70 years among the oldest star@@ ters .
in the main race this year there were even more top athle@@ tes .
four drivers were able to leave the regional champi@@ ons .
among them phili@@ p@@ p pan@@ ger@@ l , a semi-@@ professional mountain bike from the black tus@@ k racing team .
pan@@ ger@@ l and a team member have already been world champi@@ ons for the 12@@ -@@ hour race .
this year he became european champi@@ on in this special discipline .
ro@@ land b@@ aller@@ ste@@ dt , who has won two german tit@@ les in the du@@ ath@@ l@@ on , also played his part in this .
after 45 kilometres and 9@@ 00 metres of al@@ titude , the final of the e@@ ye@@ -@@ cat@@ ching final in the final round in front of the three-@@ lake hal@@ le was reached .
pan@@ ger@@ l was the first to hit the finish line .
only a second behind it , the rout@@ ine b@@ aller@@ ste@@ dt won second place in the overall race .
at the same time , her@@ mann and war@@ th@@ mann were the third to win the overall prize .
in the ladies &apos; ran@@ king , christian co@@ h@@ s@@ mann was the fas@@ test in the main race .
the second place was in the second place , are@@ ane bl@@ er@@ sch from bin@@ dings in front of nat@@ as@@ ch@@ a wer@@ ner from stutt@@ gart .
athle@@ tes and help@@ ers were very pleased with the smooth and well-@@ organised running of the event .
on the way through mu@@ d , rivers and jun@@ g@@ les for free medical care , and through mu@@ d , rivers and jun@@ g@@ les for free
dr. geor@@ ges b@@ wel@@ le provides free medical assistance to remote villages in camer@@ o@@ on , camer@@ o@@ on , and other parts of the country .
b@@ wave and his team spend almost every weekend tre@@ ating hundreds of patients , and are doing so almost every weekend .
in the west african country , there are not many doctors , only one for 5@@ ,000 people , but one for 5@@ ,000 people .
please contact us here or with your mobile phone .
dr. geor@@ ges b@@ wel@@ le is one of the top 10 of the “ c@@ n@@ n her@@ oes of 2013 ” .
you can choose to play for him or any of the other her@@ oes in the top 10 to call him the “ c@@ n@@ n her@@ o of the year ” .
the winner receives $ 2@@ 50@@ ,000 to continue his exceptional work .
for 21 years , geor@@ ges b@@ wel@@ le was watching his si@@ ck father lose consci@@ ousness and go to hospit@@ als that were not able to provide the necessary resources to help him .
j@@ ame@@ f b@@ wel@@ le was born in 198@@ 1 in a car accident near y@@ a@@ oun@@ d@@ é , the capital of camer@@ o@@ on .
at first he had only a broken arm , but then an infl@@ am@@ mation formed which spread to his brain .
“ there were no neu@@ ro@@ sur@@ ge@@ ons in camer@@ o@@ on , ” says geor@@ ges b@@ wel@@ le .
we should have got him out of camer@@ o@@ on if we had had the money .
instead , b@@ wel@@ le spent years re@@ loc@@ ating his father to over@@ crow@@ ded clin@@ ics and hospit@@ als to improve treatment there , which she had to offer .
“ it is not easy , ” comments b@@ wave .
the hotel is very clean and the staff is very friendly and helpful .
there are a great many patients .
some people are even dying because they have to wait .
the situation has hardly changed since b@@ wel@@ le &apos;s father died in 2002 .
in camer@@ o@@ on , there is only one doctor for every 5 000 people , according to the world health organisation .
in contrast , the relationship in the united states is with a doctor for 4@@ 13 people .
but even if there was a doctor for them , most camer@@ am@@ en could not afford to visit .
two out of five people in the country live below the poverty line and almost three-@@ quarters of health spending in the country is private .
“ the only problem they have is poverty , ” says b@@ wel@@ le .
and poverty makes it impossible to enjoy life .
his father and so many of his comp@@ at@@ ri@@ ots suffered to see in b@@ wel@@ le the decision to do something about it .
dr. geor@@ ges b@@ wel@@ le and his volunte@@ er team have carried out 700 free operations last year .
he became a doctor and works as a v@@ as@@ cu@@ lar sur@@ ge@@ on in the central hospital in y@@ a@@ oun@@ d@@ é .
he also founded a non-@@ profit organization called as@@ co@@ vi@@ me , which was involved in week@@ ends in rural areas and offered free medical care there .
since 2008 , he and his volunte@@ er group have helped nearly 3@@ 2@@ ,000 people .
almost every friday he and up to 30 people are forced to travel in mini@@ buses and drive with the stra@@ i@@ ght@@ forward medical equipment on the roof over un@@ pav@@ ed ter@@ rain to the villages that need help .
not always things go smo@@ o@@ thly .
more than once they had to push the vehicles through rivers and mu@@ d .
but when they arrive , they are received like her@@ oes : a fe@@ ast , sing@@ ing , and dance , and the best accommodation the place has to offer .
in these villages , free medical care is really a reason to celebrate and b@@ wel@@ le – with its wide sm@@ ile and its boun@@ dless energy – is happy to be part of the happy celebr@@ ation .
the next morning , the team starts to investigate hundreds of patients .
“ we treat 500 people per journey ” , says b@@ wel@@ le .
they come from a radi@@ us of 60 kilometres around the village – and that on foot .
each of these weekend clin@@ ics offers medical care in a number of areas .
many people are being held ho@@ stage for mal@@ aria , tu@@ ber@@ cu@@ lo@@ sis , mal@@ nutri@@ tion , di@@ abe@@ tes , par@@ a@@ sites and sex@@ ually transmitted diseases .
others receive cr@@ ut@@ ches , don@@ ated gl@@ asses or free birth certific@@ ates – a document that is required for school , but which many poor families simply cannot afford .
in the evening , the team conduc@@ ts simple operations with local an@@ aes@@ the@@ sia .
the operations usually take place in a school , town hall or apartment ; after the operation , patients are on and go to the rest area to make room for the child .
the lighting for the op and the dis@@ inf@@ ection equipment is provided by the group gener@@ ator and so b@@ wave and its voluntary work up to the early morning hours of sunday .
it is a demanding task , but the village musicians usually help to bring the team to work .
“ they are dr@@ um@@ ming all night so that we can wake up and continue our work , ” says b@@ wel@@ le .
on sunday the team will return to the city , ti@@ red but proud of the work done .
the group – a mix@@ ture of camer@@ o@@ on doctors and foreign medical students – has carried out 700 free operations last year and knows that their work has made a huge difference for the people to whom it helps .
a man explained that the free operation of a le@@ g break he received now allows him to return to work .
“ this changes the future of my family , ” the man said .
in addition to weekend clin@@ ics and his work as sur@@ ge@@ on in the hospital , b@@ wel@@ le also works in private clin@@ ics in y@@ a@@ oun@@ d@@ é at night .
with this second job he will finance 60 % of his non-@@ profit activities , so b@@ wel@@ le ; the rest come from private don@@ ations .
“ i really do not know when he is sle@@ eping , ” says k@@ ati@@ e o &apos;@@ mal@@ ley , who will be atten@@ ding dre@@ x@@ el university in phil@@ ade@@ l@@ phi@@ a medicine for the second year and volunte@@ ered in b@@ wel@@ les .
he is always either in hospital or trying to raise money for the organization so that he can go to these campaigns .
for medical and nur@@ sing students such as o &apos;@@ mal@@ ley , who come from the usa and europe and support b@@ wel@@ le , this is an opportunity to gain practical experience that they never would have at home .
“ we can be there to help in operations where we can help to collect blood or use the instruments for dr b@@ wel@@ le , ” explains o &apos;@@ mal@@ ley .
that would be a medical student in america in the second year .
students usually pay for their trip to camer@@ o@@ on themselves and bring frequently don@@ ated san@@ it@@ ary material .
but once you have arrived in y@@ a@@ oun@@ d@@ é , b@@ wel@@ le will take care of the accommodation , transportation and instruc@@ tion .
“ he is undoubtedly a her@@ o , ” says o &apos;@@ mal@@ ley .
he de@@ votes his life to this organisation and his desire to help the camer@@ o@@ on people know no borders .
for b@@ wel@@ le , the almost constant work is not a burden .
to make others happy and to make a promise to do so that he can deliver to his father is a great pleasure .
“ i am so happy to do this work , ” says b@@ wel@@ le .
and i am thinking of my father .
i hope he will see what i do .
i do it to make people lau@@ gh again and to reli@@ eve the pain .

excellent fighting ,
the role of s@@ anti@@ ago , the old man in hem@@ ing@@ way &apos;s nov@@ elle &quot; the old man and the sea &quot; , is hor@@ st jan@@ son cut to the body .
jan@@ son is himself an old h@@ are in his profes@@ sion of acting .
the old man s@@ anti@@ ago cannot be dec@@ ei@@ ved by fishing .
the two are perfectly comple@@ mentary .
it is almost thought that the wr@@ ink@@ les in the nec@@ k of the old man , of which the fishing boy spe@@ aks man@@ olo , can be seen .
when s@@ anti@@ ago is ti@@ red of life , sitting on the chair , jan@@ son e@@ cht is .
the role of the old fisher@@ man is also a character role that jan@@ son plays most excell@@ ently .
hem@@ ing@@ way told the story of a figh@@ ter , a cour@@ ageous man who does not give up and who ultimately , through his knowledge and also his will , win@@ s the fight against fish .
jan@@ son was a single actor on stage in many parts of the show .
he man@@ ages to attract the attention of the audience , so that his mon@@ ol@@ ics do not have a moment bor@@ ing .
his efforts to finally bring the fish to the surface of the water are so real that the vie@@ wers forget that the sea is only made of blue illu@@ min@@ ated water bott@@ les .
director j@@ ens has@@ sel@@ mann leaves the old man on the boat in front of the fishing village .
during the performance he puts the active scene in the light : the refu@@ ge of s@@ anti@@ ago , the bar of sing@@ er mari@@ e-@@ lu@@ ise gun@@ st , the bar with her songs and her wonderful voice .
the four musicians play cuba ’ s rhy@@ th@@ m and are also guests of the bar .
tourism : des@@ cent to the roman@@ s
the city of cologne is a se@@ wage channel from the roman era , which is approximately 120 metres long .
if you visit cologne , you will not miss the cathedral .
the two to@@ wers rise to the sky about 15@@ 7 meters and make it the second highest church building in europe .
but few visitors who visit the two f@@ ili@@ gre@@ e church to@@ wers have a sense that there is a great variety of interesting places to visit under the cathedral .
ra@@ iner schul@@ ze is an expert in the field of cologne .
the meeting point for his guided tours is the service centre of cologne tourism directly at the cathedral .
the tour starts in a very un@@ spectacular way : &quot; we start in the underground garage &quot; , says schul@@ ze .
in the 197@@ 0s , the town fa@@ thers wanted a car city , and so the remains of the old city walls were only what the city was not too big .
most users of the multi-@@ sto@@ rey car park therefore rus@@ h past the roman remains and only leave their cars .
but those who look more closely will find a metal g@@ lit@@ ter in the parking dec@@ k d@@ 2 .
the ru@@ ins of the island are about five metres high , made of hand@@ -@@ made stones .
&quot; there are remains of the roman city wall , which was built in the second half of the first century after christ , &quot; schul@@ ze tells .
before it goes back to the day@@ light , schul@@ ze leaves the participants at the upper level of the park to take a look at a dark , 15 metres deep sha@@ ft .
this is the well of the old cathedral , which is unfortunately hardly noticed .
the next station of the tour is the pre@@ tori@@ um , and here the participants des@@ cen@@ d into the depth again .
we are witn@@ essing the official seat of the once most powerful man north of the alps , the pre@@ cur@@ sor of the c@@ ca@@ a .
what c@@ ca@@ a means is for a visitor to know .
&quot; the ab@@ bre@@ vi@@ ation stands for &quot; col@@ onia cla@@ u@@ dia ara ag@@ ri@@ pp@@ in@@ en@@ si@@ um &quot; , which in good german means &quot; city of roman right and city of ag@@ ri@@ pp@@ in@@ en@@ ser , founded under emper@@ or ka@@ is@@ e@@ re@@ us .
and the pre@@ tori@@ um is the former stat@@ ut@@ ory palace , the center of power of the roman empire on the rh@@ ine .
from the hall of the exhibition , there is a tunnel access to the roman se@@ wage channel , which is preserved here on about 120 meters length .
&quot; you can easily find a piece along the so-called clo@@ ac@@ a maxim@@ a if you want , &quot; says schul@@ ze the guests .
schul@@ ze still has a surprise .
after he had pic@@ ked the key at the chec@@ k@@ out desk , he leads the group to a 16 metr@@ e deep wal@@ k@@ able sha@@ ft .
&quot; we are now in the mi@@ k@@ we , a rit@@ ual jewish bath , &quot; he explains .
the jewish community built its bath deep into the ground to get to the gr@@ ound@@ water , which is essential for rit@@ ual washing .
to this day , at the bottom of the mi@@ k@@ we , whose origin@@ s date back to the eigh@@ th century , different water levels have been read@@ able through var@@ ying levels of the rh@@ ine .
mi@@ k@@ we is part of an archae@@ ological zone on the town hall square , for which construction work is to begin shortly .
however , a few years will go by before completion .
le@@ g almost h@@ acked : re@@ run of ro@@ ck@@ er process .
a bloo@@ dy attack in the ro@@ ck@@ er@@ mil@@ i@@ eu is re@@ ro@@ lled after more than four years .
a trial for attemp@@ ted death , dangerous in@@ jury and material damage against two thir@@ ty years old has taken place in the district court in frankfurt ( oder ) .
it is accompanied by strict security measures .
the def@@ end@@ ants remain silent as a pre@@ lu@@ de .
they were supposed to have been active in the ro@@ ck@@ er scene and then belong@@ ed to the band@@ id@@ os .
the prosecu@@ tor acc@@ uses them of having , in june 2009 , been working with unknown accompl@@ ices in fin@@ ow@@ furt on three men in a car and ste@@ pping in .
all the victims were seriously in@@ ju@@ red , a man almost lost his le@@ g .
the victims are to be ang@@ els &apos; compe@@ ting group .
one is to have been a high-@@ level member from berlin .
it seems that there was a ch@@ ase with several cars .
the indic@@ tment was about batt@@ les of the region and a demonstration of power .
the two def@@ end@@ ants were released in a first trial in early 2012 .
a court spo@@ kes@@ man said at the time that it was not possible to prove that men were actually involved in the bloo@@ dy f@@ eu@@ d .
the perpe@@ tr@@ ators had carried mas@@ ks and had not been recognized .
the federal court of justice vo@@ ic@@ ed the judgment after the court &apos;s review and referred it to the country court for further negotiation .
one of the def@@ end@@ ants is currently in the open for another off@@ ence .
the first was the reconstruction of the processes in the fac@@ ade of tat@@ n@@ ach@@ t .
as a witness , the commissioner who was investig@@ ating at the time was invited .
the centre was mobile phone calls from the def@@ end@@ ants and other people who had listened to the police .
it is difficult that ro@@ ck@@ ers in court almost always ad@@ here to a law that they have e@@ h@@ ren@@ d - and not statements .
this also applies to the victims .
in the first process , only one of the victims had caught up .
prosecu@@ tor ste@@ fan gol@@ fi@@ er of the public prosecu@@ tor , frankfurt ( or ) said on demand that new sp@@ he@@ res have appeared since the last trial .
ele@@ ven other days of negotiations have been set for the process .
the dispos@@ able company does not think
the night was long , the music l@@ oud and the mo@@ od good , but at some point it goes home .
but in the people ’ s bel@@ lies on the fron@@ t-@@ passenger and re@@ ar seat , hun@@ ger is notic@@ eable .
of course , some cock@@ tails or spar@@ k@@ ling wine may be responsible for this !
what could be more obvious than ch@@ illing for the next dri@@ ve-@@ in to get a little bit of something ?
i admit that i am happy to be with you when there is a late night or early morning fa@@ st@@ food pick .
a few pom@@ mes , a col@@ a , a bur@@ ger - and then ni@@ x like home and in bed !
but , on the way home , the obvious differences between me and other hun@@ gr@@ y dis@@ co go@@ ers are notic@@ eable .
what is missing , that you can always use your fa@@ st@@ food bag ?
the hotel is located in a quiet area , close to the city centre and the main shopping street .
&quot; why ? &quot; i wonder .
are people too do@@ of to take the bags home with respect until the next du@@ st@@ b@@ in ?
it is not just the paper industry that sp@@ ills the landscape .
bags have also been used to cover traffic facilities such as control panels , causing accidents .
about so what thin@@ ks said &quot; dispos@@ able society &quot; but does not reflect , probably does not even know what that word actually means .
the hotel is located in a quiet area , but is very close to the city centre .
a few bags would be more or less like a ni@@ x - unlike the street where no one is on the food resi@@ du@@ es of other tr@@ um@@ ps .
i can see the day when the people of the cities and the municip@@ alities are being left to f@@ ade - and fa@@ st@@ food cha@@ ins are being thro@@ wn in for their bags .
obama ’ s health policy back@@ tracking
after a lot of criticism , president obama yesterday back@@ tracking on his frequently repeated , un@@ equi@@ vo@@ cal promise : “ if you like your health insurance , you can keep it . ”
after hundreds of thousands of insu@@ rers received a letter of cancellation , the republic@@ ans thre@@ w a sp@@ ell on the president in recent days to the effect that he mis@@ led the american public .
yesterday , obama put his original promise into perspective .
“ the vast majority of citizens who have a functioning health insurance can keep it , ” he said in a speech in bo@@ ston .
in response to the numerous media reports on the redun@@ dan@@ cies , obama called on the americans who received such communications to be able to find a new insurance in the free market .
most citizens could thus benefit from better , more comprehensive health insurance at the same price or less than forec@@ ast .
“ they come up with a better offer , ” he said .
the government was not surprised that the five percent of the population , which had insurance cover , had to look for another fare .
“ i would like to say to these americans quite directly : they deserve better , ” said se@@ beli@@ us at a hearing before the european parliament ’ s energy and trade committee in washington .
se@@ beli@@ us , who is responsible for implementing the affir@@ ma@@ tive care act , explained that the launch of the online platform has been “ mis@@ er@@ ab@@ el ” since october .
“ i am as fru@@ stra@@ ted and an@@ gr@@ y as anyone else , ” she said .
i am determined to reg@@ ain your confidence .
this expression of an ex@@ ci@@ ted se@@ beli@@ us to a behind her assi@@ stant at yesterday &apos;s hearing in the representative house was made after a dispute with the republic@@ an me@@ p b@@ il@@ ly long .
after more than three hours of hearing , long se@@ beli@@ us repeatedly cl@@ ash@@ ed with the question of why the “ architec@@ t ” of the affordable care act was not willing to respond to a state@@ -@@ spon@@ so@@ red insurance policy .
government in jerusal@@ em confir@@ ms attack on sy@@ ri@@ an air base not only confir@@ ms attack on sy@@ ri@@ an air base but also confir@@ ms the attack on sy@@ ri@@ an air base .
an american government official who wanted to remain anonymous has made a statement to the american news channel c@@ n@@ n on thursday that israeli figh@@ ters are not allowed to enter the country one day before .
the aim is to &quot; missi@@ les and related equipment &quot; , of which the israeli government fe@@ ared that it was not responsible for the leban@@ ese he@@ z@@ bol@@ lah , was it said , according to c@@ n@@ n .
sy@@ ri@@ an and leban@@ ese media , as well as the arab channel al-@@ arab@@ i@@ ya , had previously reported that the base in the port city of lat@@ ak@@ ia was closed on wednesday night , from wednesday to thursday , and the israeli government had .
the israeli television channel channel channel channel 2 showed satellite images of the base in lat@@ ak@@ ia , where russian defense missi@@ les of the type s-@@ 12@@ 5 new@@ a and a battery of sa@@ -@@ 3 missi@@ les were deplo@@ yed .
in@@ secure the government in jerusal@@ em has not officially confirmed the attack .
however , the news agency re@@ u@@ ters quo@@ tes an equally anonymous israeli government official saying that he believes israel can stop the attack , whether it is safe or not .
a spo@@ kes@@ man for the israeli ministry of defence said , &apos; we are not comm@@ enting on these reports &apos; .
the journ@@ alist ron ben@@ -@@ y@@ is@@ ha@@ i stressed in the daily ye@@ di@@ oth a@@ hr@@ on@@ oth that the sy@@ ri@@ an regime had already been in power , sometimes successfully , in trying to use ground air missi@@ les in the past .
the israeli government has repeatedly war@@ ned that any attempt by syria to re@@ treat he@@ z@@ bol@@ lah with chemical or other dangerous weapons would be a serious threat to the crossing of a &apos; red line &apos; .
john ker@@ ry explains in an unprecedented acknowled@@ g@@ ement that the us es@@ pi@@ on@@ age is “ in@@ appropriate to go too far ” .
john ker@@ ry suggested an un@@ expected admission of a sof@@ ten@@ ing of the def@@ ensive attitude of the us in its surveillance programs .
the foreign minister also ad@@ mitted that he , together with bar@@ ack obama , would be responsible for pus@@ hing for “ au@@ top@@ il@@ ot ” when the explo@@ sive de@@ ve@@ stations of the wh@@ ist@@ le@@ b@@ lower were un@@ covered .
the le@@ ak@@ ed information has left the us government in a diplomatic stor@@ m of indi@@ gn@@ ation from its allies .
in a video call to the open government conference in london , ker@@ ry said , “ there is no question that the president and i , as well as others in the government , have learned of some things that are virtually au@@ top@@ il@@ ot .
he was then the first senior member of the us government to admit that the us es@@ pi@@ on@@ age had cros@@ sed a border , but he also stressed that no rights had been ab@@ used .
he said , ‘ in some cases this has gone un@@ reason@@ ably too far . ’
the president is determined to create clarity , and is therefore conduc@@ ting a thorough investigation so that no one has to feel that abuse is taking place here .
i assure you that the rights of inno@@ cent people will not be affected in this process .
but ker@@ ry insi@@ sted that the n@@ sa was a force of good , and that its surveillance operations saved many lives .
he added : “ we are dealing with a new world in which people are prepared to live in the air themselves , ” he said .
there is radical extre@@ mis@@ m in the world that is ob@@ s@@ essed with killing people , inv@@ ading the air , and destro@@ ying governments .
so what if one were able to catch up and stop this before it happens ?
we have indeed seen aircraft cr@@ ash@@ es , attacks on buildings and the murder of people because we are still not ready to do so .
meanwhile , us legisl@@ ators will travel to europe to address concerns about america ’ s supposed es@@ pi@@ on@@ age , and to convince europeans of the need to make progress in the anti-@@ terrorism effort .
sen@@ ator chr@@ is mur@@ ph@@ y from connec@@ tic@@ ut said he had met representatives of the european parliament and other people this week and was concerned about their threats to move on to the european parliament because of fru@@ stration with the monitoring agency .
“ it is very important for us national security interests that europeans should be more flexible in our joint efforts to combat terrorism . ”
i also go to europe to make it clear that we must continue to work together in the fight against terrorism , regardless of their an@@ ger over the n@@ sa programmes .
media reports that the n@@ sa collec@@ ts millions of telephone data in europe have strengthened relations with some us allies , although the us head of the intelligence service has declared this week that the reports are incorrec@@ t and based on a set of principles .
other rev@@ el@@ ations ci@@ ted from the documents passed on by snow@@ den , according to which the n@@ sa was used by chancell@@ or ang@@ ela mer@@ kel and up to 34 other heads of state worldwide .
the head of the national intelligence services , james cla@@ pper , def@@ ended es@@ pi@@ on@@ age among allies as necessary and declared that this was common on both sides .
in all this tur@@ mo@@ il , mur@@ ph@@ y said that his authority was preparing the congress ’ s trip , which is due to take place this year , and hoped that the delegation would include members from both parties and cham@@ bers .
the names of the other participating members are to be published in the coming days .
he said that the exact route is still being worked out .
while mur@@ ph@@ y stressed that the purpose of the journey was to improve relations , he also said that there were some “ serious words . ”
he said that european governments should be honest with their people about the type of sp@@ y programmes they have been using for years .
“ while we can change our surveillance programs , thus protecting europeans ’ rights better , they must also be able to accept the fact that we are not the only ones to sp@@ y ” , mur@@ ph@@ y says .
meanwhile , john ker@@ ry will be on a weekend trip to the middle east and poland to meet the res@@ ent@@ ment of the us strategy in syria , egypt , and iran , as well as the us surveillance activities .

austr@@ ali@@ an has appe@@ aled against prison sent@@ ences in thailand
a 2@@ 1-@@ year-@@ old sy@@ d@@ ney woman who had been imprison@@ ed in ph@@ uk@@ et for fal@@ sely carrying out alleg@@ ations of a ta@@ xi@@ -@@ driver rap@@ ed her .
ste@@ vi@@ e ro@@ ch@@ elle b@@ am@@ ford was first tried by a provin@@ cial court in ph@@ uk@@ et on 15 june , to make a false statement that had not been accepted by the th@@ ai police .
later , however , the video camera &apos;s photographs showed that she had safe@@ ly entered her hotel after she was separated from her austr@@ ali@@ an friend .
the police in ph@@ uk@@ et inter@@ ro@@ g@@ ated b@@ am@@ ford for two days until they conf@@ essed to have con@@ ceived history .
until the trial , she was in police cust@@ o@@ dy on the ground .
b@@ am@@ ford was sent@@ enced to 15 days &apos; imprison@@ ment in a low-@@ level prison unit on the fring@@ e of ph@@ uk@@ et , instead of being held in prison for adults .
she is the daughter of peter tun@@ ks , a former player of the austr@@ ali@@ an rub@@ gy league who addressed the foreign ministry in can@@ ber@@ ra asking for help for his daughter .
tun@@ ks declared to the sunday te@@ leg@@ raph in sy@@ d@@ ney that the whole family was “ extremely concerned ” about the well-being of his daughter and wanted to have her back in australia .
“ we are naturally very concerned , but we hope that you will come back home as soon as possible , ” said tun@@ ks .
b@@ am@@ ford appe@@ aled against the judgment and is not liable for a deposit of 50@@ ,000 ba@@ ht .
austr@@ ali@@ an reports have said that they have been in the meantime staying in the kr@@ ab@@ i resort in southern thailand .
the court has said that b@@ am@@ ford is being replaced by a local law@@ yer in ph@@ uk@@ et , and that he has been war@@ ned that the appeal will also be used to impose a higher sentence of up to two years in prison .
however , it is also possible that thailand will be able to remain in the united states after the recent murder of the tourist cl@@ er@@ k mic@@ hel@@ le sm@@ ith in ph@@ uk@@ et .
