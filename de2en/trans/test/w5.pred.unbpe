keith ellison and john lewis congressmen have tabled a legislative proposal to make it easier for trade unions to be established as a civil right .
&quot; just as unions die , the middle-class jobs die , &quot; said ellison , a democrat from minnesota and deputy prime minister of the progressive caudis .
i am therefore proud to present , together with the civil rights icon john lewis , the law on the authorisation of staff .
this groundbreaking law gives workers the same legal opportunities in discrimination on the grounds of the organisation of trade unions as in other forms of discrimination - and thus stops anti-union forces .
the addition of the national labour law law to provide an opportunity for discrimination against out-of-work workers to organise a trade union representation in order to be able to appeal for justice in a civil court - and to seek compensation or penal fees - is essential .
but it is certainly not a radical initiative - certainly not according to american standards .
indeed , the best way to understand what ellison , lech , and the rest of sponsors of their legislative proposal is to link back to a very american idea .
despite the setbacks that trade unions have suffered in recent years - in wisconsin , michigan and other states in general - the situation has been that americans have once forced countries around the world to take advantage of labour rights .
there was a time when millions of americans could still remember when this country was a democracy , freedom of speech , freedom of the press and the right of association in one breath .
when the united states joined japan after world war ii , general douglas mac arthur and his staff encouraged the country to adopt a constitution that would allow it to ensure that the united states ’ militarized autocracy was hedged .
fully aware that workers and their trade unions are at the forefront of the creation of a new japan , they used a language that explicitly stated that the japanese are not the rights of workers in unification and common understanding .
when the united states joined germany after world war ii , general dwight david eisenhower and his staff urged the germans to write a constitution that would ensure that fascism was adolf hitler ’ s .
recognising that workers are worried
agreements that restrict or restrict this right are not acceptable .
when the former first lady eleanor roosevelt was in the chair of the international commission on human rights , which was the subject of the universal declaration of human rights , as it was adopted by the united nations in 1948 as a worldwide agreement .
for generations , americans have accepted the basic premise that labour rights are human rights .
when this country gave other countries a chance to make civil and democratic societies , it declared that it would not be possible to establish a union .
after these rights were crushed in america , it is indeed very wise to imagine the american ideal again .
as pastor martin luther king jr. said fifty years ago , “ we are not alone in the world , but in europe . ”
history is a great teacher .
now everyone knows that the workers &apos; movement is not restricting the strength of the nation , but increasing it .
by raising living standards of millions of people , work has miraculously created a market for industry and has put the whole nation on an unimaginable level of production .
those who attack the work forget these simple truths , but the story preserves them .
history remembers , and we should do so .
formal recognition of labour rights as human rights - and the extension of the protection of civil rights as a protection against discrimination in the creation of employee representatives - is long overdue .
keith ellison and john lewis are reinventing the ideals that america has made in the past , and that have delivered on the promise of democracy .
judges temporarily stop law that all abortion clinics in louisiana for closure will force them to close .
a us federal judge stopped the case on sunday for the time being in louisiana , which was the case for lawyers saying that it would probably lead to the closure of all five abortion clinics in the state .
this measure , which was proposed by bobby jindal , governor of louisiana , in june , and which was adopted on 1 september , is a measure that would benefit doctors who have abortions .
the judge &apos;s decision , however , means that doctors will continue to work legally for the time being , while they are exercising such a right .
&quot; the plaintiffs can continue to work in accordance with the law while they are trying to obtain these rights , &quot; wrote federal judge john degravelles in his judgment .
within a month , a hearing will be held for the judge to decide on a lasting solution to the law .
those in favour of abortion welcomed the decision to take into account the latest in a series of judgments against similar measures , saying that doctors had waited more time to get hospital admissions rights .
&quot; today &apos;s decision means that women in louisiana are subjected to a lax law that deprives them of their health and rights , &quot; said nancy northup , president and chairman of the centre for reproductive rights ,
it was not immediately clear whether the judgment would affect doctors from the two clinics .
louisiana is one of 11 countries that have adopted similar laws , with courts recently taking such measures in alabama and mississippi for unconstitutional purposes .
key points of a law in texas that covers most of the remaining clinics in the state would have been closed by a federal judge on friday .
those who support abortion and the american college of ostretricians and gynecologists , as well as the american medical association , are saying , in common , that conscription rights for doctors are unnecessary .
opponents of abortion say that the measures are not in line with the protection of women &apos;s health , although some also consider the effects of closing clinics .
only a doctor who has been detained in louisiana has patients &apos; records .
if all other doctors in the state are forced to do no more abortion , this doctor would , out of fear for his safety , no longer carry out the operation , the group said .
in their argument against the judgment , representatives of the state of louisiana said that they were not doctors for the conduct of abortions .
delayed diagnosis and lack of access to the best treatment means that higher deaths occur as a result of egg-related cancer in rural areas .
angelina jolie and her brother james have a video hook-face for her mother online , which was released in 2007 on eggs .
for women in rural areas of australia , there is a greater risk of losing ovarian cancer , than for women in cities .
researchers analyzed the medical data of more than 1100 australians , in which , in 2005 , ovarian cancer was detected , and found that only 25 % of patients were diagnosed .
the research director susan jordan of the qimr berghofer medical research institute said that for those who live in rural and remote regions of the state , the problem of mortality is much higher during the study .
small study : new drugs could contain lung and egg rig cancer .
researchers studied the medical care of women over seven years .
dr jordan said that the age of a woman in diagnosis , the type of ovarian cancer , is the same as previous illnesses , as well as social and economic status , influenced the chances of survival .
for older women and those whose cancer is the cause of further progress at diagnosis time , the number of women who have died has been the lowest .
for those who live in rural and remote regions of the state , the mortality rate was around $ 350 per year during the study .
although the study did not investigate why living people outside the city with a greater probability of ovaries cancer died , the study suggests that jordan is a belated diagnosis and lack of access to the best treatments .
&quot; this disease is best diagnosed by gynaecological oncologist , and they are usually found in larger cities , &quot; she said .
despite the improvement in telemedicine services in order to counter distances , it proposed as a possible remedy a strengthening of the service of interconnected doctors , in order to enable specialists to work for women more closely with their place of residence .
dr jordan said that the study would be a bad long-term study , regardless of geographical status , for women in the ovarian cancer , and underlined the need for better treatment and prevention .
the “ global climate change ” strategy developed by rio tinto ride to conquer cancer is now published in the medical journal of australia .
in march 2013 elisha neave , a young mother of 33 years of gold , learned that she had an aggressive form of egg-rearing cancer .
garden centres regret falling house owners , which are not expected to pay enough attention to declining house owners .
the decline , along with an increased fall in the number of homeowners under 35 years , could lead to garden centres losing tens of thousands of pounds per year if today ’ s young consumers are looking for a study by hta , as stated in the financial times .
the report states that tenants are expected to pay an average of 55 % of the amount paid to people with homes for their garden .
the rise in people living in highly urbanized areas without gardens is a popular problem .
in the greater london area , where over a period of six years , the share of homeowners has risen from 61 % to 43 % , the lowest expenditure on garden products per household is reported .
the hta and the royal horticultural society have pointed out that the living is for rent or for small gardens not mean that the people do not want to pull plants .
guy barter , head gardening consultant for the rhs said : &quot; container gardeners are very popular with tenants , for example , because they bring their plants with them when they move . &quot;
the hta report identified the period from 1997 to 2005 as the &quot; golden age &quot; of the retail garden market due to rising house owners and economic prosperity .
he predicted that the next round of negotiations will be improved as a result of the better weather conditions following unfavourable weather conditions in march and april last year .
the political and economic reforms that the opposition politician imran khan and the clerical tahirul qadri led in pakistan continue .
in the capital islamabad , around 1000 demonstrators have broadcasted the ptv state television channel .
information minister pervaiz rashid said that soldiers had yet again driven the protests out of ptv buildings .
the station opened its operations for about 40 minutes , but has now been sent back .
at the same time , around 3000 demonstrators tried to return to the residence of prime minister nawaz sharif .
about a kilometre away they delivered with sticks and stones .
the police used tear gas .
the demonstrators called on sharif ’ s resignation , but he refused to do so .
the country &apos;s army is now calling for a political solution to the conflict , &quot; without time to waste and to use force &quot; .
after a meeting at the headquarters on sunday evening , the military announced that it would not accept the army &apos;s role , but that it would ensure the security of the state .
the military plays an important role in pakistan and has already been putting the strain on more than one occasion .
the opposition politician imran khan accuses premier sharif of not being able to stand in the parliamentary election last may .
the protests were escalating at the weekend , after khan and qadri forced their supporters to return to sharif ’ s residence .
three people were killed .
turkey orders us diplomat for spying reports .
the turkish foreign ministry has sent the most senior us diplomats to the country to provide information on a report on american and british spying in turkey .
vice-president bülent said that the us embassy and turkish officials were not going to sign the report on monday .
the german magazine der spiegel and the online magazine the intercept reported that the information provided by the former us analyst of the national security agency , edward snowden , shows that the turkey is a major activity .
according to turkish news agencies , the turkish cypriot president recep tayyip erdogan played the role of the report and said that he would have to look at each other from all the major countries .
an earlier report that also revealed the most important secret service in germany &apos;s history , sorted out the serious ankara situation .

said the district president of the trade union of german locomotive leaders ( gdl ) , sven schmitte , in düsseldorf .
we expect significant failures .
i would not like to see regional priorities .
the main thrust of the warning strike is freight transport .
the deutsche bahn in nrw announced that it would do everything to reduce the impact .
the gdl has not , however , said where it wants to strike , so it is difficult to predict the consequences in concrete terms .
police chief of magaluf of corruption accused of being a criminal .
the prosecutors issued a letter to the office of the public prosecutor of mallorca on friday to show evidence of blackmail by police and officials of the city of calvià .
the head of the police of calvià on the island of majorca was sentenced to death following allegations of corruption by businessmen and bartender in the notorious binge drinking hotspot magaluf .
general commissioner josé antonio navarro was named after allegations of corruption against him by several punta ballena businessmen , the street where most bars and night clubs were located in magaluf .
according to the online newspaper mallorca diario , the prosecutors have sent the prosecutor &apos;s office to the office of the mallorca anti-corruption action on friday evidence of blackmail by policemen and officials of the city of calvio .
two other local police officers were arrested by the spanish guardia civil in connection with the corrupt authorities in the spanish state .
the spanish daily abc reported that the spanish government &apos;s angry nightclubs have been looking for a place to veto their neo-liberal policies .
&quot; it is no longer about making money , it is about survival , &quot; said one of the businessmen to the court .
let our livelihood be released from the game .
we have nothing to lose .
magaluf made a huge effort this summer to help her with her youtube videos .
since then , the island authorities have tried to prevent the irregular behaviour of alcoholic holidaymakers in magaluf , by using the number of participants in the notorious alcohol beverages .
the playhouse club , where fellatio took place , was designed for a year to close .
the tourist resort of magaluf , which is popular with young british tourists , is a popular destination for many accidents .
the first spring day with wet and stormy weather conditions affects flights from adelaide airport to the airport .
spring has brought southern australia a winter surprise .
in the evening until 9 p.m. another 5mm of rain fell on the city , after 6.6mm , which was already visible on sunday in the night .
the last precipitation was the result of a series of short , stormy showers , including a cast that began just before 8 p.m. and was used for nearly 4mm precipitation in about 10 minutes .
after the winter last week for an early dose of spring had been provided , the temperature dropped in the city on monday .
the bad weather conditions are probably causing the belated landing of a flight of virgin airlines from melbourne to adelaide .
the plane should have been landed shortly after 7.30 p.m. , but was driven by a winds - a sudden change in wind speed or direction over a short distance - and had to start .
windsurges reached about 50 km / h at the ground at the airport adelaide .
the flight data showed that the aircraft was still in service during a second landing and was finally ready to fly at around 8.40 p.m.
the flight delay caused the delay in the execution of some other flights , including an emirates flight from dubai and a quanta flight .
for adelaide , a maximum temperature of 16 ° c is predicted on tuesday , with possible showers .
matthies says : it is high time for a big network of people to be networked together .
given the rampant technological progress that our concern about the future of our cozy home in high-tech power stations , we must not forget that the european union is a great help .
while i am writing this here , my view of the spiral cable that connects the listener to the phone , and i think : boah , how retro is that ?
but that is the reasoning : if the cable is not , the cable will be available to all listeners in the shortest time , and that would be even more rescue than that .
in any case , the most important thing is the eckeltronic ( eckeltronic ?
no , typing errors : electronic ) sector the rule that the world &apos;s novelty today is the electrical waste of tomorrow , bought - outdated .
and anyone who still uses a tube tv in the living room today , for example , simply says that he is fundamentally opposed to television .
why these considerations ?
because we are very concerned about the imposition of the ifa at the radio tower this week of our absolute incompetence in matters of electronics .
the layman , who used to be a washing machine and cd player blindly , does not even understand the purpose of the equipment that is equipped with inconceivable lethal expert spreadsheet before him : &quot; connected &quot; .
yes , is it still possible ?
what are we to talk about with people who seem to want to spread such quark voluntarily ?
the fact is that for some 20 years now , the main thing has been that we have been able to network our house most pleasantly .
to make the yoghurt reorder itself so that the fire alarm can be sent to us on holiday in the maldives , that it is burning in the working room grade .
and would it not be wonderful if we could have air conditioning in our room soon ... ?
yes , however , this requires air conditioning .
but a dream will most certainly come true in the near future : we raise our watch , say her according to &quot; sucking ! &quot; - and at home the vacuum robot drives off .
wrong .
everything is going on nothing less than a revolution : &apos; the borders between white and brown bears are blurring &apos; , roughshod a branch of industry , you can see the washing machine with a headphone .
we know from our daily practice that if a new fashionable machine is really needed , then the actuator is guaranteed to be empty .
another reason why this is not so good is that the spiral cable on the phone will survive the next radio exhibitions .
israeli children are returning to gaza after the war .
thousands of israeli children from the areas near the gaza strip have been returning to israel on monday .
the school started with the rocket launches in the united states , and the first two of them were the german and french communities .
in the southern city of ashdod , staff of the &quot; pashosh &quot; kindergarten , who was hit by a missile , removed the child from the hospital before the pupils arrived .
&quot; we are a little afraid , but are excited , &quot; said ronit bart , a resident of kibbutz saad and there an english teacher .
many children in our area are in need of a return to routine .
her 11-year-old daughter shani bart said that she felt &quot; a bit of comical &quot; about to suddenly find a way back to school .
&quot; these were difficult times , and we are not out of the house at all , &quot; she said .
president reuven rivlin visited the kibbutz near the border with gaza to demonstrate his support .
until a cease-fire broke out last week , thousands of people in border communities such as saad remained in their homes , or left their homes to live in safer areas further away from gaza .
many nahal oz residents , a municipality near the border with gaza , are in a 4-year old boy who is being tortured by a palestinian murderer grenade .
the ministry of education announced that a dozen or so families have not yet returned .
their children have been temporarily housed in other schools .
prime minister benjamin netanyahu visited a school in sderot , a border town with gaza that was severely affected by palestinian fire .
he called on the children to learn a lot and said &apos; we will make sure that their knowledge is acquired and offer you security &apos; .
israel and hamas agreed last tuesday to negotiate a non-freeze peace treaty with israel .
the ceasefire brought an immediate end to the fighting ; important problems remain unresolved , as the hamas demand for a lifting of the israeli-egyptian blockade of gaza and the reopening of air and sea ports .
israel is calling for hamas to be disarmed and for the bodies of two to be handed over to the israeli soldiers who were killed during the fighting .
a new round of indirect talks is expected to take place in egypt this month .
in the war , more than 2,100 palestinians were killed , three quarters of them civilians , and at least 494 children were killed , according to estimates by the palestinians and the un .
israel denies these claims and estimates that they are at least half of the killed .
on the israeli side , 66 soldiers and six civilians , including a thai worker , were killed .
hamas and other fighters in gaza fired 4,591 missiles and murderers .
meanwhile , the israeli military led more than 5,000 air and other attacks by the country .
the israeli attacks damaged or destroyed thousands of homes in gaza , including the israeli army , and some 250,000 people in more than 100 un schools , who were in temporary camps .
while tens of thousands of people still live in the protected areas and the fighting continues , the educational authorities are postponing the beginning of the school year last week .
&quot; i hope the school is soon reopened so that we can continue learning , as the children in the world and the jewish children , &quot; said mohammad amara , a 13-year-old boy who was currently in school .
the hotel is situated in the centre of saxony , close to the main railway station and the main railway station .
given the npd ’ s loss of votes in saxony , cdu federal vize thomas strobl has decided to end the current npd prohibition procedure before the federal constitutional court .
berlin - according to the cdu federal vize thomas strobl , the current prohibition proceedings against the npd should be brought to an end before the federal constitutional court .
&quot; the npd is doing worse than last time , &quot; said strobl , who also used cdu landing gear in baden-württemberg , who said &quot; leipzig volkszeitung &quot; .
this is a welcome development in the right direction and a development that makes me more convinced that the commission is not going to be able to combat the npd politically , nor is it going to go to the constitutional court .
the npd was not in the middle of the five-percent vote on sunday .
a first attempt to ban the extreme right party was in 2003 .
in december 2013 , the federal council , after long preparation , submitted a new application in karlsruhe .
the federal government and the bundestag did not join .
harburg : tents for new refugees
the new country is now being placed in tents .
the central initial reception for refugees in harbburg is bursting out of all seams .
now the home office has three red cross tents next to it .
the local politicians were not informed until very recently - they are not very enthusiastic .
&quot; these hauruck actions further fuel citizens ’ reservations and give the district politicians no opportunity to make constructive contributions to human rights in the region .
your party is calling for the district administration of harburg to provide unused houses for accommodation at the moment .
96 refugees can be accommodated in the three tents .
reasons for overfilling in the initial picture are the rush of aid surpluses - and the realization that the aid authorities are not providing enough places in follow-up facilities .
many refugees therefore remain longer than the regular three months .
house prices have reached the highest winter rise in seven years , showing a widely observed record of a high level of growth .
the rp data corelogic hedonic home value index for own home and office in the australian capital increased by 1.1 percent in august , so the rp data from monday .
this increase will mean that the overall increase will be in june , july and august at 4.2 % , the largest increase in the winter months since 2007 .
the annual increase in prices was 10.9 % , more than twice the increase in the number of new jobs in the 12 months until august 2013 , but the increases were not evenly distributed across the country .
the research director of rp data , tim lawless , announced that the sydney and melbourne had a two-tier market .
the figures of rp data show that house prices in syria are down by around 30 % last year .
the following markets are adelaide , brisbane and darwin , where prices are average around five and six percent .
at the other end of the scale lies canberra , which is affected by cuts in government spending , where prices are higher than the annual average , by only 1.4 % .
mr lawless said that the treaty of spring was about to be launched for the next few months , with an increase in sales of real estate , which would &quot; open up the market to a real test &quot; .
&quot; if you look at the constant high rate of auction prices , a generally fast selling rate and the increase in the price of the item , you will see that the price is likely to rise .
in an opinion to the new press , it contradicts statements made by the managing director peer medau and attaches &apos; as a feldherr &apos; to it .
the style of the university is not this , it is stated in the communication .
so the family medau already &quot; mid-june orally on the request of the university of applied sciences &quot; was informed .
the statement that the plans will not be announced until july is definitely wrong , &quot; he argues .
at the same time , it points out that the plans are not &apos; predefined or not decisions &apos; .
the car park , which is necessary for access , is also suitable for the development of the narrow road up to the castle , which is less dramatic than the medina feared .
from a nine metre wide road has not been and is not being discussed .
as things stand at present , this is 5.50 metres wide , a metre wider than before , &quot; explains pötzl .
the medu operators &apos; argument that their free and schooling parking spaces will only be used by students from the university in future is a good one .
there is no parking at all because , as with other public parking lots , this can be solved intelligently .
we are thinking of the residents of the area , and we are thinking of the residents of the area ,
the &quot; nanny &quot; nursery , located on the premises and located on the front door , is the access to the parking deck , according to the university president , should not be affected .
rather , it points out that &apos; this is not just about the crèche , but also about the people living near the mouth to the friedrich-streib-straße and the 800 students of the adjacent realschule .
so we are talking about much more than the vested interests of mr medau , &quot; says pötzl .
whether parental critiques ’ advisory board of children ’ s critics , with the expansion of the road would be one of the few places left behind coburg , would be justified , &quot; the reader can decide for himself &quot; .
in early october pötzl wants to build a new building in the city , together with the state building authority bamberg , &quot; and in this context to highlight the importance of the new development &quot; .
peer medau had the parents of the children ’ s crib last week about the plans of the university .
the aim is therefore to facilitate access to the new parking deck via the campus and friedrich-streib-straße , rather than via the medus-berg .
this would have to close the narrow road to about one kilometre of two-lane length .
according to the meda estimates , traffic in the park of hohenfels would double by ten times .
from about 2000 vehicles a day is being discussed .
the city wanted to avoid being asked to comment on the project .
glandorf comes from handball national team back .
holger glandorf will no longer be available for the dhb team .
the 31-year-old sg flensburg-handewitt , a bundesliga , was the first to cause health problems for this decision .
i am not easy to make the decision , it has matured for several months .
it is time for me to listen to the signals of my body and to start my career in the national team &quot; , said the president of the world cup from 2007 on his facebook page .
it therefore takes stock of 167 country games and 576 goals for germany in the international ruhr .
because the root-massive spine player for the champions league winner is from flensburg yet another few years on torehunting .
the icelanders , who had their cadre for the national games against switzerland on tuesday , led glandorf to a &quot; long and good conversation .
his ideas and approaches inspired me just as much as my long-time co-workers and my successors were .
but for my club i would like to be healthy in the coming years , for longer rehabilitation plans are necessary .
the left handler had to leave the country after a heel infection in 2012 .
due to achilless problems he had moved from team doctors of the german handball association ( dhb ) to a cortison-injection .
an emergency operation and two other interventions followed .
then glandorf had filed a complaint against the team doctor , the dispute ended with a comparison .
twelve years of professional and eleven years of national team career are not tracked by any body .
i have some health sites that i can no longer ignore .
after the three infectious foot operations that took place in 2012 in short intervals , i have my blood pressure never really been properly under control .
there are some other wear-related complaints .
already at the beginning of the year i noticed that i had to control my head , but i didn &apos;t deceive my body , &quot; explained glandorf in the interview to the magazine &quot; handball time &quot; .
for a comeback , it would only be available in absolute emergency .
&quot; if all the knitting is done , i am always ready to talk , &quot; said the two father of the family , to the magazine .
however , i cannot go back to the years in which i can still play handball .
i must also say that after my long stay in hospital in 2012 i was also quite humble , which affects my health .
after my career i would like to go at least some straight .
in addition to the world cup title 2007 and the champions league 2014 prize , he won the 2008 hsg nordhorn and 2010 ( tbv lemgo ) title at the ehf cup .
in 2012 , he also secured a new european position with flensburg .
german economy in spring by 0.2 % shrunk by 0.2 % .
the crises around the globe have hit the german economy in the second quarter .
gross domestic product fell by more than 50 % from april to june 2014 compared to the previous quarter .
this was shared by the federal statistical office and confirmed the results of the study .
consumption alone has stimulated the economy in the spring , while investment has fallen .
foreign trade also slowed the economy .
thanks to the strong start of the year , a total of eur 350 million is earmarked for the first six months compared with the second half of 2013 .
horstmar was the starting point and the goal of the &quot; münsterland-mooiste &quot; , which was first mentioned by the burgmannsstadt on sunday .
the burgmannstadt horstmar experienced an invasion of dutch &quot; fiction &quot; riders on sunday .
the biggest cycling association in the netherlands , ntfu , organised the so-called &quot; münsterlande mooiste &quot; .
it is a matter of the largest cycle tour across the münsterland , the cycling paradise of the region near the netherlands .
more than 1000 participants thanked them with their registration at jos ter huerne for organizing this tour through the münsterland .
published in various trade journals this tour was offered to interested persons .
we are from the heroes and we went overnight to take part in this tour .
we would also like to make münsterland a closer acquaintance with this kind of thing , &quot; the cyclists were delighted by the route through the circles of steinfurt , borken and coesfeld .

katharina went to a small &quot; peace trip &quot; through the city across the wall , where the start took place .
the route continued , which is suitable for three different categories , towards herrenholz , over the schöppinger mountain towards coesfeld and via havixbeck and billerbeck back to horstmar .
on routes of 95 kilometres with 1175 metres of altitude , 120 kilometres with 1475 metres of altitude and 145 kilometres with 1775 metres of altitude , cyclists proved their good condition .
they were taken away on the way in havixbeck and billerbeck .
the main organizer jos ter huerne and mayor deputy heinz lölfing were delighted with the success of this cycling event .
we are satisfied and it was a nice experience for all concerned .
the organization went without problems and there were no negative incidents &quot; , he draws heinz lölfing a positive conclusion of this event .
unfortunately , not as many participants as the organizer hoped , but this probably was due to the bad weather forecasts .
&quot; we are facing a new challenge in 2015 , hopefully with nice weather on 30 august or during another weekend , &quot; said the cyclists still promising to return to münsterland and the organisers are planning a new edition .
konstantin wecker ’ s unrelenting honest memoirs of the memoirs of the war in iraq are a shameful and honest memoirs of the people of the former yugoslavia .
it is actually more philosophical testimony than biography , which constantine wecker , liedermacher , pacifist , politically secure activist , ex-prisoner , in &quot; monk and war .
not chronological , but more thought feeds for mind and body .
and he is ruthless honest : from the onanie as a gymnasiast to the shoplifting and drug use , he does not allow human weakness .
also , to show how he himself tolerates tolerance in dealing with his fellow human beings .
the abstract , but even more important terms are also taking on a wide scope : love , soul , ego , being in the now , spirituality - all of which he tries to get to the bottom , in very personal , but also very philosophical .
and he also explains his pacifism , his social critique , his political commitment - and also , as he has shown not only the music ( opera lovers ) , but also the soul and rock music .
the latter has the libeman konstantin wecker also added to the ascetic monk who was &quot; driven by subtraction &quot; , as he says , &quot; by doing everything unnecessary . &quot;
between all the high-minded views , there are also short anecdotes for the earth : about sleeping cars in a gis frequented loop or a wahnwizard car ride , where you can ride .
here too , he is bluntly honest .
lenny henry : my father never let me down .
never said &quot; i love you &quot; , i love you , i love you , i love you , i love you , i love you , i love you , i love you !
henry was one of seven children of a jamaican family in dudley in the midlands in 1958 .
his father , who died when henry 19 , worked in a factory and her relationship was limited .
henry is rehearsing for a comedy , rudy &apos;s rare records , which is partly based on an imaginary conversation with his father and is released from the series on radio 4 .
the soundtrack is a mixture of reggae and rap , with lively melodies .
but henry had to be replaced by some difficult childhood moments .
he visited &quot; many &quot; therapies after the death of his mother , and henry is thinking about his relationship with his father .
it was hard to know him .
you never saw your face , heard only his voice : &quot; listen to the crash .
let your sister be calm .
obey you !
i want to see cricket .
my older brothers seymour and hilton - who were already of age when i was a child - went to the kneipp with him and talked about things like the form of beer glass or the beauty of a cricket .
i have never had such a conversation with him .
for most of my life he was this serious type in the corner that read the newspaper .
recently , henry opened a foundry in dudley , and although the conditions are better than at the time of his father , he won an insight into how the life for him was .
it is now a little brighter , but they are dark , smoked , deep stylish labyrinths with flame busts and smoke and much soot .
my father used to simply put himself in the bath and then he could hear him slowly sing , singing .
when i ran around , i realized that i was going to have to do that for years to make food on the table .
nevertheless , henry grew up as a child without love testimonies of his parents .
my father hugged me never , he never said &quot; i love you &quot; .
only when my mother was badly off towards the end of her life did we start to &quot; i love you , i love you , i love you &quot; to say .
through his own daughter , billie , with dawn french , he could share the love he had as a child .
could you ever be satisfied with the &quot; i love you &quot; ?
stop me and think about it !
dad , i am 22 !
with dawn french .
why not be friends ?
it is a great mother .
it is still using french .
dawn is a good person .
why not be friends ?
it is a great mother .
henry &apos;s own mother was a diabetic .
this contributed to their death .
so when i was very , very overweight and had symptoms of diabetes , my doctor said , &quot; you must be radical .
so i pulled this fitness through and also had to make a drastic diet to reversal the symptoms .
it is very difficult .
and it is exhausting .
nobody likes to eat carrots .
henry &apos;s career change may be reflected in his elegant , short cut bart .
since he was criticized for his othello , the government has been disbanded from the theatre .
the comedy of the misconceptions followed , and then fences of august wilson .
that is a different experience from the sitcoms and comedy that his business life has been through .
he started with only 16 years when he was working in a factory .
a dj discovered him on stage when he was imitating and writing people to new faces about him .
his television career began in the mid-1970s . &quot; i was in the middle of the only black irish television station for a long time .
he learned at work .
i had to face up to the public , but also to the public from 1975 to 1985 , how i could create an efficient witz-narrative machine while i was watching television a star that was not .
lenny 1975 at new faces
since his manager has passed the stage law at the black and white minstrel show , he has been a light entertainment program that has been the focus of the people &quot; black analgesic &quot; , henry led his comedy .
the hotel is very clean and the staff are very friendly .
i somehow wish it never happened , but i am sorry that i did not see it .
it was a strange , unpleasant position for me , but i worked on giant projects with and learned to work on the way to communicate with a large audience .
but this &apos; years of award-winning light pillar of british television has been a source of &apos; gross injustice &apos; .
the introduction of figures that make up the british black culture both mocking and fearful has led henry to work in the 1980s on an alternative comedy circle .
the first series of lenny henry show was broadcast in 1984 , and in the 1990s he was among other things known as the chef gareth blacklock in the cosmopolitan series chef !
advertising , documentaries , tv series and film roles have shaped his next decade , but after his bronze series lennyhenry.tv 2008 davis thought to be : &quot; what is you doing next ?
after that , a documentary series for radio 4 was released entitled what &apos;s so great about ... ?
the first episode was about shakespeare .
on shakespeare i was really allergic .
i never had a real idea at school and i never learned anything about him , and i thought it was a medium class domain , a white one in tights and a coal head .
so i was very afraid of it .
all of us who interviewed for the show , peter hall , trevor nunn , adrian lester , judi dench said &quot; you should prolong it .
do not make it bad if you do not know what you are talking about .
take a few words into your mouth , and then you &apos;ll understand what you &apos;re doing , why we all shakespeare so .
henry led 20 lines out of othello ’ s last speech for the documentary film and he was thrilled .
i had the feeling that i was able to do that .
it was almost as if someone had finally got my head up properly .
&quot; that is what it is about , it is a serious thing , take them seriously , learn your text , search a bit .
the samples were brutal , and i read this piece for months before we did it .
and it was a success .
they seemed to have expected a car accident , and that simply did not happen .
and soon he appeared in the comedy of errors .
suddenly i was in the national theatre and i could hardly believe it .
there was a moment when i thought , &quot; oh , you have changed . &quot;
there was a technical error and henry felt instinctively that he had to entertain the audience .
&quot; a small voice told me &quot; you have to bridge 10 minutes while you are on the computer . &quot;
instead , the stage director announced that the idea was moving forward , as soon as the problem was resolved .
i went from the stage and something in me said &quot; oh , god be thankful &quot; .
i am not responsible for that .
i can leave that to someone else .
&quot; you play in a play , so stay in your role . &quot;
henry in fences on duchess theatre
the text for fences was challenging .
panic is very good , it strengthens the yearnings .
that , too , was good , so it is like a great shield of the gods who tell me &quot; this is your purpose . &quot;
he says so , of course , with a thundering voice .
so i will stick to that .
i really love that .
i love to be in a sample room .
but henry still has the head of a comedian - our conversation is full of humorous eruptions while he imitates people time and again .
i have decided not to create stand-up comedy , because i think that the commission &apos;s proposal for an immediate satisfaction of this kind is a place full of strangers .
if we are looking for it , we are going to face a wall .
i sometimes get into the apollo live when i want to do it , but overall there is not so much i can do .
i ask him whether he has ever seen a stand-up comedy tour again .
the fun i had in a room with a director was a great help to create a beginning , a middle part and the end of a journey - i think not that i am the one i have ever wanted to give up .
is this , then , his new incarnation ?
i think so .
i am a actor .
it is fun .
you always tell a story , and that is great .
i love stories .
people love stories .
huth rebels are blocking roads in yemen ’ s capital city , yemen ’ s capital , the capital city , blocking roads in yemen ’ s capital city .
in the conflict between shia huth rebels and yemeni ’ s government , huth ’ s government has led to civil disobedience in the capital city of sanaa .
huth supporters could have seen central streets in sana on monday , said a speaker from the huth party , &quot; ansar allah &quot; .
the access to parliament is also blocked .
yemeni media report a traffic mess in the capital .
according to the online edition of the newspaper &quot; yemen post &quot; , huth leader abdulmalik al-huthi had a meeting on sunday evening to take the measures .
huthi threatened to be the first to be released in the united states , according to the leaf , if his demands were not met .
the shia huth is fighting for more independence from the sunni ruled yemen , and calling for the resignation of the government .
the huthi people are besieged for almost two weeks by the yemeni capital .
around 30,000 rebels have built protest camps on the large access roads of sanaa .
in the surrounding area , there are always bloody battles with the yemeni army .
kenya registers officials to &quot; fight ghost workers &quot; , and the government has been able to prevent the use of &apos; ghost workers &apos; .
kenya has begun to send all state officials biometric , in order to prevent &apos; ghost employees &apos; from paying salaries for the government .
employees who are in the process of not registering in the next two weeks would no longer be paid for a government communication .
the government suspects that thousands of people will be deported from the public service even after they leave .
president uhuru kenyatta promised to make a commitment to eradicate public service corruption when he took office in 2013 .
in an examination earlier this year it was found that at least $ 1 million ( £ 700,000 ) per month in payments for &quot; ghost employees &quot; and other abuses of the financial practices were lost .
the government suspects that salaries will continue to be paid on accounts after a person has died .
all officials must now be able to work in identification centres for the next two weeks to ensure that their data on biometric registrations is included in a government message .
all those who do not want to do this without a credible apology would be removed from the pay list , read the communication further .
&quot; this approach makes a significant contribution to rationalising public services by reducing the actual number of officials and also by reducing salary lists on both government levels .
the scandal surrounding art adviser helge achenbach will be brought to court for the first time on 11 november .
five heirs of berthold albrecht , son of aldi founder theo albrecht , are demanding a new trial in a civil trial at the düsseldorf district court of germany , with eur 19.4 million in compensation .
that was what a court spokesman said on monday .
in the action , it says that achenbach had a right to a fair deal with the purchase of works of art and vintage cars and that berthold albrecht calculated the purchase prices paid .
this also meant that the agreed commission was higher .
achenbach has spent eur 121 million valuables on albrecht .
children need roots and wings , and they need wings and roots .
he was a school-teacher , 23 of whom were school leaders .
from this time , manfred richter knows many petershausener and kollbacher from their time as a student .
his methods were sometimes unconventional , but always supported by his desire to find a way to see people in the pupil .
the snowkoppe is the most famous mountain of the giant mountains .
manfred richter loves the painting with the motif from his home .
judge was born in trautenau / northern bohemia in 1930 , today trutnov .
already with 14 he was interested after four years of secondary school for the profession of teachers .
one year later , the sudeten germans were expropriated .
within half an hour , the family had to leave their homes .
after a few months in one camp , the situation went back to bavaria in 1946 - in the freight wagon .
so judges went to the upper franconian valley village .
teacher training took place in bamberg .
manfred richter had to pay six times a week to go to the nearest railway station , drive by train to bamberg , walk three kilometres across the city and go back to school in the evening .
after two months manfred richter got in a red cross home in bamberg a sleeping opportunity : together with up to 15 students in a dormitory .
in 1951 , he made the first and in 1954 , after three years of lehramts-aspirant , he became the second state exam .
since oberfranken is not a free teacher , he applied for a place in upper bavaria and joined the university of berlin. he joined the school in kollbach on november 1 , 1954 .
the &quot; mäulein room &quot; was his first &quot; service flat &quot; in the school .
in 1958 , he moved to the new teacher &apos;s house next to the school and moved to a three-room service-flat .
this house bought manfred richter in 1980 , after the school in kollbach had been dissolved in 1968 .
until then , there were no such cases in kollbach at the school association petershausen-kollbach and in petershausen five .
from the school year 1968 / 69 , these were acquired in petershausen in the present town hall .
when the school association was founded , the school was left with only the primary school in the town .
to avoid a downgrade in the now smaller school , the school changed its name to the former rector georg sigl .
but petershausen grew , and so the children and their teachers were able to follow the building today , which was moved to judges ’ retirement in 1997 .
manfred richter commends the uncomplicated generosity of the then mayor ludwig götz , who has also created a workshop at community costs and a cellar room for expansion in 1997 , although this is still the case according to the court .
&quot; mayor götz was very school-friendly , &quot; judges remembered .
throughout his career , manfred richter has never heard a speech from a government representative who was waiting for a department of a school council on justice and law : &quot; you cannot never forget the love &quot; .
&quot; you have to give your children two things : roots and wings , &quot; says the 84-year-old .
and he had to know : &quot; that &apos;s not always possible &quot; , whether he only has his students or his own six children , is not quite clear .
in any case , judges were sometimes unconventional .
if students check , they were given no information about the criminal proceedings and were not sentenced to sit down .
at the expense of the municipality , judge had created two pair of box gloves and left the two contrasts against each other , even if there was a veil .
for the good of the school , judges as rector maintained a good relationship with the then mayor ludwig götz ( csu ) .
he moved the partisan judge after his retirement to at least be the last on the csu list for the municipal council in 1996 .
but judges were chosen for place six and joined the csu .
180 kilometres ( 3 miles ) of road ,
hr4-cycle tour 700 bikers will take part in the spa park in bad salzhausen and schotten stopovers .
if cyclists want to experience the best of the world on their tour in bad salzhausen or schott , that is nothing special in itself .
on friday , however , the number of resting people alone made the impression that the 700 participants of the hr4 cycle tour and accompanying tross enjoyed a break in the lower spa park of bad salzhausen and later a party in the open sky .
under the motto &quot; cycling and celebrating on newly discovered paths between nidda and kinzig &quot; , participants in bad vilbel had met on thursday and had a concert of van baker &amp; band .
on friday it became serious : the cyclists took the first stage , which crossed 60 kilometres over florstadt to bad salzhausen and further to scotland .
in bad salzhausen , the athletes of mayor hans-peter seum , who was awarded the bike in bad vilbel , and the athlete of the in-house company bad salzhausen , petra schwinghausen , were welcomed .
for body and mind refreshment , there was a lot of good things prepared : the rural women of ranstadt and nieder-mockstadt had 85 sheets of apple , pear , stretch and pear .
&quot; such cakes can only bake women in rural areas , &quot; praised a participant from aulendiebach while ordering another piece .
the turnverein geiß-nidda beverage was used to bring cold refreshments .
the duo bravo was a great place to meet the audience with famous operettas and musicals and enjoyed the enthusiastic applause .
the beautiful ambience of the park was relaxing .
a gentleman also enjoyed a head massage from his partner : &quot; he deserves that , after all he has already dropped off today bicycle chains again .
meanwhile , the mayor and the manager of the company had to work : they were put on the well in front of the drinking cube of reporter rainer janke and used the opportunity to work on the radio for bad salzkammergut .
also the head of promotion tobias hagen , since the first hr4 cycle tour 2004 as tour manager , could only briefly snowed , he had a lot of fun with the technology on site .
his pickup truck , in which he was brought to the scene by three telephones and a radio device with his employees and the 15 member of the group of the police , hessen , was facebook entries .
&quot; the majority of participants come from the rhine-main region , &quot; he told , &quot; but also from gießen or fulda , from lauterbach or the taunus and even from numerous cities in western flesh .
the number of participants is a bit according to the available accommodation capacities .
in category i , participants are accommodated in hotels , in category ii in class accommodation .
the town was the ideal place for cyclists to get to know the area again after a day and a half : &quot; bull ! &quot;
&quot; it was beautiful in bad salzhausen ! &quot; they waved for a farewell .
after arriving in scotland , the group was allowed to make a short break .
but in the evening the cyclists were in the idyllic alteburgpark .
the scottish national team of tourism and urban marketing ( gts ) has been working on a nice festambiente and , of course , you have had some delicious dishes , such as flame cakes with well cooled white spring water .
mayor susanne schaab , gts managing director markus hoßfeld and msc chairman wolfgang wagner-sachs in his role as member of the board of adac hessen-thuringia .
the three were obviously delighted with the &quot; many factory in scotland &quot; .
dj tobias hagen then gave the dance stage free .
the opportunity to move freely and swim in the open air has been created despite the sporty activity on the bicycle .
among the guests , there were increasingly citizens who were impressed by the good mood as well as the large number of cyclists .
on the second day , the cyclists were able to visit birstein , wachtersbach and bad orb stations , including a concert with the trenkwaldern .
yesterday , after 180 kilometres of cycling , the athletes met again in bad vilbel .
dozens of turkish policemen for &apos; conspiracy &apos; against the government have been arrested and sentenced to death .
a total of 33 police officers were arrested in turkey because of the suspicion of &apos; conspiracy against the government &apos; , and local media agencies report .
the police authorities did not make any direct comments .
among those arrested , 14 senior police officers were senior members , and hurricane mitch reported that the number of prisoners was increasing .
some of them were involved in the corruption investigations against government officials , including four government ministers last december .
in july , a number of turkish policemen were arrested for supposedly committing an organised criminal association and calling numbers to pick up .
turkish president recep tayyip has said that he is not a member of the european parliament .
not all children in ukraine return to school .
schools in almost every part of ukraine opened their doors on monday ( september 1st ) after the summer holidays .
this day is traditionally an important day for families , and like thousands of other ukrainian parents , prime minister arsenij jazenjuk brought his daughter to school .
there he informed waiting journalists that not all schools are reopened , that he had decided to go ahead with the country for future generations :
the september celebrations were not held in every school .
the sky is not always peaceful over ukraine .
we must work for a peaceful sky .
the whole of ukraine , a huge common ukrainian people &apos;s front , must fight for a peaceful sky .
aleksan pastukhow , school director at the slavjansk school , who was jazenjuk &apos;s daughter , spoke in russian .
we hope that peace will finally reign here and that the children will receive an education that will be useful to them in their lives .
the first day of school of the new school year is traditionally celebrated , with children embroidered shirts , balloons in their hands and their teachers being given flowers .
with rona fairhead , the bbc has perhaps made the great director you need .
it is hitting the world with a proud lifeline from the banking world , media management and the inner circle of the tory party .
and it has its own frontal experience .
her career began with the worldwide management consultancy bain and co . , which she was proud of when she was appointed to morgan stanley , bombadier , ici and the media world of pearsons .
it has been the chairman of the board of directors of the financial times for seven years and resigned when the parent company pearsons was transferred to a younger male colleague .
their compensation was supposedly nearly £ 1 million .
their political ranking is also sound .
she was born david cameron by lord brown , former chairman of bp , when he was asked for more private-sector knowledge in whitehall .
her husband is a former tory council member .
in may , i described the role of the chairman with a poisoned kelch .
not only is the bbc a huge and complex entity in the heart of public life , but there is also an internal paradox in its structure .
confidence works in two directions : inward on the first guard of its own management hierarchy in the bbc , but also outwardly as a voice of public concern and disquiet when things go wrong .
this provides an almost untenable duopoly that , after a complete comprehensive reform , requires .
but which new incoming president would risk being attacked if he were to resort to everything and to pick up an institution that is as complex as a chinese dynasty while he is doing himself perhaps to be his job .
it is a difficult task .
and as if that were not enough , many are also interested in making the bbc smaller .
while the competition is getting closer and new technologies are opening up new , comfortable collateral threats , the forthcoming negotiations on the licensing fees for the bbc are facing particular risks .
the modest sum of eur 145.50 per year will be paid by the british public for what is certainly the largest media company in the world .
the bbc tells a good story : it says that it is 96 % of households and that each of them has only 40 pence per day .
and it seems that the bbc is rising on the popularity scale again .
the visual and usage habits for the bbc have changed : i get a lot of news headlines today on my mobile phone and see how it works .
but it remains a very beloved and noble institution .
it needs a considerable chairman - i hope she has found it .
perry from texas says that downgrading tweet is not authorized .
a twet from the official account of the republican governor of texas , rick perry , on sunday included a heralding scorn remark about the democratic district prosecutor , who was central to the district prosecutor .
the tweet was later deleted and replaced by another of perry &apos;s user account , which overrides the previous termination .
a tweet has just been sent from my account , which is not authorized by me .
&quot; i approve the tweet not and i have deleted it , &quot; said it in the later news .
employees of perry did not respond immediately to requests for comments .
although the tweets of perry &apos;s official user account were running , it was not clear who actually would have served the feed .
in the former tweet an unadvantageous image of the district citizen prosecutor was created by travis county , rosemary lehmberg .
perry put a veto on financial support for her office when she refused to give her resignation , which led to an indictment of perry - who may have presidential election in 2016 .
the text of the tweets reads : &quot; i don &apos;t always drunk with the triple permitted alcohol level ... but if i do it , i am not complaining gouverneur perry , if he is .
i am the most drunk democrat in texas .
lehberg ’ s office was not in charge of the investigation of the grand jury against perry .
this was done by michael mccrum , a special prosecutor from san antonio , who was arrested by a republican judge .
perry argues in unguilty and called the charge a political trigger .
his first-class team of legal advisors applied for a patent in the case of the judge responsible for the case .
perry stopped 7.5 million $ government money to the public integrity bank .
this veto provided public sanction on the part of a left-wing watchdog group .
perry &apos;s official user account is frequently updated - and sometimes famous .
after winning the election meetings in iowa during his presidential term , he was elected president of the republic in 2012 , perry went to speculation .
berkeley explains housing market again for &quot; normal &quot; , but it is not the same as the real home market .
one of the most prominent builders in london pointed out that the construction sector in the united kingdom was in the south-east of england again at normal levels .
homes in the capital were hot sought-after and subject to enormous price increases , which made the bank of england much more vulnerable to the widespread fear of lending bubble .
tony pidgley , founder and ceo of the top-class construction company berkeley said on monday : &quot; since the beginning of the current financial year , the market has returned to normal transaction levels .
the housing market in london was the biggest in the downturn , as foreign buyers entered the capital .
according to the information of the catasters , the prices in the city area alone last year have jumped by 18.5 % , far more than the average rise in england and wales as a whole .
the average selling prices at berkeley ’ s private , cheap , and student offers rose by about one-fifth in the past year , and reached around the 423,000 £ end of april .
a stronger pound , however , has lost property in london for foreign buyers in recent months - some of them are also affected by the introduction of new housing taxes and political rhetoric about a possible “ village-tax ” .
london ’ s real estate agent foxton warned in the past week that the hysteria market report for april , in which schäfer ’ s credit lending rules were introduced , would be in the second half of the year .
new data from the bank of england of monday show a decline in mortgage approval in july , which also indicates that the euro is in decline .
hamptions international , another real estate agency , corrected his prediction of the rise in housing prices in london for 2015 to 3 % , on the basis of a already weaker market .
the volume of transactions in the most expensive areas of london , such as chelsea , mayfair and kensington , has increased year after year by a quarter , according to the broker wa ellis .
however , the desire for home in the capital is not a good idea for berkeley , as the sums due for sales on dates are limited to more than $ 2.2 billion .
mr pidgley added : &apos; the demand for the right well-planned product to the best sites in björn remained stable and as a result , the sales of the dates have also remained stable . &apos;
in june , the company reported that it had created 3,742 new homes in the year until the end of april - nearly a third more than the 2007 peak before the crisis .
the annual pre-tax income rose by 40 % annually to € 280 million , while sales rose by 18 % to £ 1.6 billion .
in a communication on monday before the company &apos;s annual general meeting , mr pidgley said that the income for berkeley is expected to exceed the current market expectations this year .
analysts agree that annual growth in the value of pre-tax assets is 450 million £ .
berkeley shares were in the london stock exchange in the afternoon , at £ 23.96 .
nude photos from jennifer lawrence by hackers published on the internet on hacker on the internet .
jennifer lawrence performs at the 85th oscarlung award .
nude photos of the oscar prize winner jennifer lawrence were online by a hacker who was alleged to have &quot; mastered a list &quot; of images of another 100 starlets .
a representative of the star from &quot; the tribute of panem &quot; confirmed that the first photos of lavrence erected were real and complained to the hacker for &quot; blatant violation of privacy &quot; .
the authorities have been notified and will follow all those who have not read the stolen photos of jennifer lawrence .
the photos originally published on the photo-sharing page 4chan are now available in the public domain .
it is not certain how many of the images are real , although winstead , star from &quot; scott pilgrim against the rest of the world &quot; on twitter also condemned the hack .
&quot; to those of you who look at photos that my husband and i took in the private environment of our house years ago - i hope you are really satisfied with you &quot; , wrote winstead on twitter .

it was like the house from a children &apos;s fairy tale , both threatening and tempting , a garden full of secrets .
portrait of the author : howard jacobson , whose novel &quot; j &quot; is published on longlist for which man booker prize 2014 .
the shortlist is going to be announced next week .
kevern had dealings with ailin on the broken pipe with the dealer in the high grass and had a very unusually warm spring afternoon .
your feet are too big .
due to their own aggressiveness , songs of this kind were no longer played on the console .
not forbidden - nothing was really forbidden - simply not played .
it has been successfully obsolete , as the word obsolete .
the general taste created what enlightened and prescriptive regulations would never have done , and how people could use the vom tellrecher-zum-millionaire memoirs , cookbooks and love novels .
in the euphoria of the day , kevern began to create an imaginary piano and to play in a grob-comic serenade ailin &apos;s big feet .
in the end , the two were the ones who were the first to be able to make a living .
&quot; this was a well-known song of a jazz pianist called fats waller , &quot; he explained to her and automatically put two fingers on his lips .
his father had always done that to write the letter j , before he had left his mouth .
it had been a game between him and his father when he was still small .
his father had it played with his own father , so he had told .
if you want to start a word with an j without two fingers over your lips , it costs you a penny .
there was no very funny game at that time , and it was not very funny even now .
he knew that this was what he was expected to do .
it had to explain what jazz was .
alinn had never heard of any .
jazz was also used , even if it was not directly prohibited .
improvisation was no longer modern .
the room was very small and the bathroom was very small .
people wanted to be in the beginning of a melody quite sure where it would end .
the mind is the same .
its unpredictability made people nervous .
and jazz was musically expressed verbal .
although he was 10 years old without being taken over by sammy davis junior , he knew that he was a little bit of jazz from the half secret jazz collection of old cds of his father .
but at least he had to explain ailin that fats waller was black .
she was probably unable to remember a time when she was old , when pop singers were not black .
again , no laws or constraints were applied .
a conform society meant that every element of this society was thankfully subject to the principle of group gifts - thankfully as the ones spared by fate .
people with afro-caribbean origins were disadvantaged by temperament and body building for entertainment and sport , so sang and ranged them .
people who were originally excluded from the indian sub-continent were treated like nature with electronic talents .
what is left of the polish community is not the only concern for the sewer system ; what has been left of the greeks has been smashed .
those from the gulf states and the levante , whose grandparents did not leave the country quickly than what had happened , were the ones who were forced to leave for fear of humidity .
everyone according to their skills .
since it only heard ballads , it fell hard for ailinn to understand how the insulting words that were kevern &apos;s just reading her .
music was an expression of love .
&quot; they are not really offensive , &quot; said kevern .
except perhaps for people whose feet are too big .
my father never offended anyone , but he loved this song .
he talked too much , but the neglected garden gave him the deceptive feeling of security .
nothing could have prevented the sound insulation of the huge coal-like leaves .
in the early 1920s , the company was the only company to have been able to offer its services to the public .
why would your father have loved such a thing ?
he wanted to say that it was a jux , but hesitated to live in their presence again two fingers on the lips .
she thought she had already been doing something strange , anyway .
&quot; it seemed funny to him , &quot; he said instead .
she shake disbelief and was disbanding her head .
there were no other options to see around the world than to see their uncombated rabenschwarz hair .
there was nothing else he would have wanted to see .
&quot; if you say it , &quot; do you mean it without conviction .
but that does not explain why you want to read it .
she seemed honestly concerned .
are my feet too big ?
he looked again .
your feet so directly not .
maybe your ankle , a little bit ...
and thou sayest thou hate me because my ankles are too thick ?
hate thee ?
of course i do not hate you .
that is just the stupid song .
he could have said &quot; i love you &quot; , but it was too early for that .
&quot; your thick ankles are the reason why you like me .
i am a bit perverse .
it did not sound right .
it had to be funny .
if he tried to be funny , he brought himself often in trouble because he was like his father not to be reassured by the soothing charm that one needed to keep the voice of the jokes inherent .
perhaps his father also wanted to be cruel .
perhaps he wanted to make his own .
despite his kind eyes .
ailin solomon was red and raised in the mouth of her recumbent chair , threw the console and disguised the wine , the wine she had drunk .
hollow wine , so drunkenness was no excuse for him .
in their excitement , they seemed to tremble , as palmwedel in storm .
&quot; and your thick head is precisely why i am perverse to thee .
besides that i am not at all .
she did him suffering , both because of the unnecessary usefulness of his words and the fear that was manifest in her eyes when she rebelled against him .
did she think he would beat her ?
she had not told him about the life on the cold northern archipelago where she was grown up , but he had no doubt that she was born in the middle of the cold .
the same giant and ice-cold ocean broke here as there on the shore .
the same confused men , with even thicker skin and disguised after the things that had happened than their predecessors were smugglers and beach robbers , moved from pubs to pubs .
thick head ?
they would have given her a big fist if she had not prepared !
she first crunches - crunch was the most commonly used word for a erotic anchor .
kevern said that this was an unnecessary refinement , because the crunch itself had already been an act of violence .
ailin solomon gave him a sign through her body .
he arose from the deck-chair like an old man .
she also felt bleaching , but the strength of his mourning surprised her .
that was not the end of the world .
they hardly knew each other .
she watched him as he distanced himself - as from a room on the upper floor her companion looked at him - a man who complains about something he himself has done .
adam leaves the garden , she thought .
she felt a sudden pain for him and men in general , although some had their hands raised against them .
a man turned away from her , his back prayed , ashamed , sealed , without fighting , and he was not a man of sight , but a man of good knowledge .
when she was alone again , ailin looked at the world of solomon .
several years before the stories of the past , esme nußbaum worked , an intelligent and enthusiastic way of working for 32 years in the name of ofnow , the non-legislative director of the european parliament .
&quot; a lot has already been done and much remains to be done , &quot; she wrote , &quot; to the innate aggressiveness of a people that has won a thousand wars and most of them won , especially in the remote regions .
but some properties are provoked by the inability to eradicate them .
the higher the church tower , it seems , the lower the passion for the church to continue to awaken .
the people cry when they hear sentimental ballads , they hear stories of overwound difficulties and claim that they are firmly committed to the virtues of marriage and family life , but still does not keep only the former .
&quot; they have an unfortunate tendency to exaggerate , &quot; said their mentor when he was reading the whole report .
i propose that they should have fewer novels .
esme nußbaum lowers her head .
i must also ask whether they are atheist ?
&quot; i think i don &apos;t have to say that , &quot; answered esme nut tree .
are you lesbian ?
again esme reported on her right to privacy and refused to grant the statement .
feminist ?
silence again .
&quot; i don &apos;t ask this , &quot; said luther rabinowitz , &quot; because i am against atheism , lesbentum or feminism .
this is an prejudice free job .
we are prejudiced by a society .
but certain types of hypersensitivity , which in itself are absolutely acceptable and commendable , can sometimes produce results , as they have been presented , which are not acceptable .
you yourself have obviously expressed prejudices against the church , and these things that you call &apos; discouraging &apos; and &apos; roh &apos; could be used by others as an expression of naturally strength and vitality .
if you continue on the road , what has happened , if it happened , as if it were the case , it would have happened yesterday , it means that the country has lost its essential vitality .
esme walnut looked around while rabinowitz spoke .
behind his head , a led-font repeated in flamingorosa the advice that ofnow gave the country in the last quarter of a century or longer .
smile your neighbor , value your partner , listen to ballad , visit music shops , do not use your phone , talk to you , explain what you hear .
speaking is better than silence , the singing word is better than the written , but nothing is better than love .
&quot; i understand perfectly what you want to go down , &quot; esme replied nussbaum with a quiet voice than she was sure that her superior would finish speaking , &quot; and i say nothing else , but that we are going to .
my concern is that we are going to have to help out with the situation without warning , as we are repeating the mistakes that led to what happened when it happened .
this time , however , it is not the others that we should share our anger and distrust .
luther rabinowitz shaped a pyramid with his hands .
to avoid an angel patience , i would like to ask you to take a look at the following .
&quot; they go too far , &quot; he said , &quot; if they see actions as &quot; mistakes &quot; that our grandparents may or may not have committed .
they also go too far when they say that they have their &quot; anger &quot; and their &quot; mistrust &quot; on &quot; other &quot; .
it should not be necessary to give someone in their position the idea that we are not too far behind in understanding the past and protecting the present , not from &apos; us &apos; and &apos; others &apos; .
there was no &quot; we &quot; and there was no &quot; other &quot; .
it was a time of disorder , that is all we know .
&quot; of which , if we are honest with ourselves , &quot; esme dared to throw in , &quot; no part of society can claim to have behaved well .
i do not complain to anyone .
whether it is bad or well done , what has happened has happened .
that was then .
there is nothing more to say about this - we are agreed on that .
and just as no blame must be assigned , no blame must be paid .
but what is the past for if we do not learn from it - and i am not saying this - from the past , and i am not learning from it - from it - from the past , and i am not the same as the present , but the future , i am not the present , the future , the future , the future , the present , the present , the future , the european parliament , the european union , the european parliament , the european parliament , the european parliament , the european
the past serves to forget them .
if i may say something about this , i would like to make a few comments .
luther rabinowitz left his pyramid collapse .
&quot; i will consider your report , &quot; he said and dismissed it .
the next day , when they arrived at work as usual , she was taken by a motorcyclist who , as passers-by described , was in a kind of &quot; brutal rage &quot; on the footpath .
by chance .
lesotho military member says that no coup is planned ; prime minister remains in south africa , and prime minister remains in south africa .
military officials in lesotho were arguing that a coup would lead to the overthrow of the government , and said that they would be against policemen who were denied the armed forces of political fanatics .
prime minister thomas thabane fled the country and announced that the army of the country had relocated to power and had moved government buildings in the capital maseru .
the premier brought his family to the adjacent south africa after being attacked by assassination threats .
major ntléle ntoi , military spokesman , said that there was no de facto coup d &apos;état , but that the military was prepared to respond to the threat of &quot; political fanatics &quot; .
&quot; what happened this morning was that the staff of defence forces of lesotho acted after he had several intelligence reports received .
the south african government spokesman clayson monyela said that military action has given the impression of a upheaval .
&quot; even though no one has claimed that the government has been torn by violence , all reports are agreed that the activities of the defence forces of lesotho have so far shown signs of a coup , &quot; he said .
military spokesmen for lesotho shared with him on sunday that the soldiers had been dragged back into their barracks and the situation in the capital was calm .
in the meantime , the vice premier mothetjoya metsing takes over the leadership of thabanes absence .
thabane announced that he believes he was arrested for his attempt to use corruption in the country .
in lesotho , there has been great tension since june , after thabane parliamentary meetings had been held due to the disputes in his unity government .
he said that his actions would not have undermined the government , that there were different accusations .
production in the euro zone on a 13-month low in the euro area , at a 13-month low in the eurozone , is the lowest in the world , and the lowest in the eurozone .
the increase in output in the eurozone slowed down in august to the lowest point in the last 13 months , such a closely observed increase in the number of cases .
the final tag purchasing management index of the producer of the trade ( pmi ) fell in august to 50.7 in which the price of the product was 51.8 in july .
a 50 specifies an expansion .
new orders were reduced and factories collapsed in a time of rising tensions between the eu and russia over ukraine .
the figures are very clear before the european central bank ( ecb ) meeting on thursday .
the markets expect the bank to draw up a clear plan for dealing with a reluctant eurozone recovery and the impending deflation of inflation at a mere 0.3 % .
there is speculation that the leader of the ecb , mario draghi , will be in the course of this week to provide further information as to whether he is proposing quantitative easing for the eurozone , in line with that of the united states and the united kingdom .
&quot; although a small growth is better than no growth , the braking effects of the increasing economic and geopolitical uncertainties on manufacturers are more apparent than any growth , &quot; said rob dobson , senior economist at markit .
the factory pmi for germany , the largest trading partner of russia in the eu , fell to the lowest level in 11 months with 51.4 .
meanwhile , the us government has fallen by more than 50 % in the second largest economy of the bloc , france , the pmi .
france remains a problem child , as does italy ’ s decline from a solid expansion of the stagnation of the world .
evidence that stimulus for growth is key to the economy ’ s success in germany , spain and the netherlands , is not good either .
the decline in industry is likely to fuel the analysts ’ fire , which will cause further monetary or fiscal stimulus .
one positive news came from the republic of ireland , where the pmi rose to 57.3 , the highest level since the end of 1999 .
howard archer , chief economist at ihs global insights , said : &quot; the best thing you can do for the purchasing management index of the manufacturing company is to use the euro area from august .
he added : &quot; producers in the euro area are obviously finding life quite difficult at the moment , as the current increased geopolitical tensions - especially with regard to russia and ukraine - have caused uncertainty in the continuing difficult conditions in many countries .
these increased uncertainties clearly have affected the economy - especially , and confidence among consumers , and are likely to lead to some emerging market delays .
he said that &apos; it is becoming increasingly likely &apos; that the ecb will eventually become a type of qe , &apos; although we suspect that it will be limited &apos; .
the hellish decade of the beslan survivors : ten years have passed since the terrible siege of the school , as the detainees ’ children still suffer .
ten years ago , more than 1,000 people were killed by chechen militias in a school in beslan in southern russia .
more than 330 people , more than half of them children , were killed in the three-day martyrdom that the world shocked , killed .
we are back to beslan to see some of the victims , who have been subjected to death at the horror in the classroom .
exactly a decade after the appalling siege of the school of beslan , where 334 people died , including 186 children , warned the heroic survivors of last night that a new apocalypse would be found .
as a fanatical islamist terrorist , children and parents on 1 september 2004 , the beginning of a new school year , were captured and killed , as the evil one seemed .
the tragedy united west and east in abhorrence , and transformed the world into a new world , surprisingly , in action and hope for the future , in the midst of the worst misery .
ten years later , we have returned to beslan to meet some of the victims who have died in the greenpeace abomination in the classroom .
we found surprising young people who resisted resistance , although the memory of these terrorists was not enough to make them forever .
their greatest hope ?
the fact that the war that ukraine is now experiencing - and in which children like them die - is now coming to an end .
the girl who was photographed at the attempt to get into the broken school sports hall was forced to leave the school .
it was created by the russian star photographer dimitri beliakov and famous for being a little bit more like a child in her underwear .
totally confused , aida sought her mother larissa , now 40 years old .
both were deemed dead , but they survived .
&quot; a woman told me i was supposed to run for my life , but i could not , &quot; said aida back then .
my legs were flooded .
i stood up and climbed back to the top of my mother .
a soldier brought them safely .
after a series of operations , she felt completely healed , but said yesterday : &quot; three months ago , the pain returned .
i fear that i will be operated again .
some shards of pomegranate are still in my knees .
their aim is now to become a dentist to help people who are suffering from the disease , as they have been helped by doctors .
&quot; this tragedy changed my life , but it did not break me , &quot; says it kampflutig .
&quot; this happened to me , and that cannot be changed .
once a year i always go to the sports hall to get used to the people who stayed there .
my friends and i try not to talk about it on other days .
pain is too great .
my best friend and future classmate dzera gapoeva was there .
we played together when we were small , and dreamed that we would go to school together .
&quot; i don &apos;t want to marry until i finish my studies and start my career .
i am thinking of a family later .
it says that the siege always forms part of it , although the memory each year is slightly weaker .
i am glad that many people around the world are still reminding themselves of our horrors and we are so grateful for the help we receive from people in britain and everywhere .
when i take the photo online from me , how i go back to school , i think that many people will see it for the first time , understand our disaster and help us to get something like this out of the ordinary .
the boy who was killed by the ball hagle , in the opinion that his mother was dead , was a man who was killed .
it was his first school day ( russians go to school at the age of 7 ) and survived the three-day siege in his mother &apos;s poor tamara .
as a seven-year-old he said , &apos; mama told me i should lie down when there is an explosion , and her hand should hold . &apos;
after an explosion , he thought she would die .
she said to him : &apos; run . &apos;
fearful that they could be dead , he fled and saw a weeping infant on the way , took it by hand and fled through a bullet .
his father vladimir , who had sent his son outside the castle , said : &quot; damir told me that his mother died .
he said : &apos; i could not save them &apos; .
in fact , tamara was stumbled outside and was buried in the hospital with leg injuries , in turn assuming that her son had died .
after her reunification she said : &quot; i wept with joy .
i could not believe it .
he ran in and embraced me .
damir was later flew to london ( from the now dissolved newspaper news of the world ) to travel from the then premier tony blair and his wife cherie to a barnardo &apos;s chile .
&quot; this horror haunts you every day , but i wish i could stop remembering , &quot; he said yesterday .
but i can say that in my memory it is palatable .
i still know that i will be able to test all my toy gun immediately afterwards .
but now i can play computer games with shot scenes and that is not a problem for me .
&quot; i am not afraid to go to the sports hall , but i do not think about myself .
i remember these children , with whom i had been playing in the courtyard , and who did not manage to get out .
we never say they have been killed or killed .
we say that you will be staying in the sports hall .
i remember very well my trip to london , especially the games store in which i visited the city .
but now he is afraid of place like ukraine , where wars are the kind of accident that he and his friends have suffered .
this horror is watching you every day , but i wish i could stop being reminded .
&quot; i am so sorry for all those who suffer from the abominations , &quot; damir said , who died last week as a volunteer in a monastery .
i am happy to help .
i want to go to the police one day and i hope that you will take me to the training academy next year .
his mother , tamara , 48 , said : &quot; 37 children from our neighborhood were killed , they can imagine ?
i remember the terrible stillness that followed the siege , there was simply no children who gave cry and run around , and these silence took us many months to get .
it is vividly reminiscent of her trip to london with damir .
the people of london wept when i told our history .
i understood then how people on the other side of the world understand our feelings , and their support shows .
she was cherie blair and her foundation grateful for the prize and the opportunity to travel to london in autumn 2004 .
i wish i could give cherie a call and tell her that 10 years have passed since , but i always remember her .
i remember the time when i was so fond of eating borschch and i wanted to visit all the local russian restaurants .
i remember how he was with waiters in a restaurant , damir shot with his water pistol on her and she ran a way and played a game with him .
and that was only a month after the horror .
i was surprised that the british were so willing to share our pain and to support us .
she said : &apos; i always think that this world has not been better in these 10 years .
in ukraine , the war is now continuing , and people are dying every day , and i believe that many children have been killed and still have to be killed .
these are just children like ours .
i think that for many of the war is part of the news they hear when they get bored or with something else .
i simply know what these people feel , the whole horror .
and i cannot stop saying that .
nothing has changed , people still want to muzzle each other , and that is so sad .
damir became big and is a very gentle and quiet boy , he is not aggressive or deserted at all .
for example , he is not looking for revenge , he is not overwhelmed by the past horrors .
i know he does not like to remember that , but he has six close friends from the class and they occasionally go to the sports hall and ignite there certs .
when he was smaller , he suffered - i remember , as he was sometimes on the sofa-bed , the face of us turned away , hours of work .
not sleeping , his eyes were open .
i remember , too , how he used all his weapons and other military toys to go on , and damir is now 17 , greater than i am , good-looking , intelligent and healthy .
i can hardly believe that i have been so sure for a few hours that he was dead and i never would see him again .
when i was recovering after the explosion and getting on my feet , i looked around and saw the hell around me , with all sorts of bodies around me .
i was absolutely sure that my little boy was impossible to survive in this hell .
&quot; i remember that i listened to him , &quot; damir , lauf , run away &quot; , but i was also so sure that he did not hear me .
but he has heard it and he has gone away .
and so life goes , unlike that of many others , for us .
georgij ilyin , 17
the boy , whose terrible image was revealed after the siege to be the symbol of the abomination of beslan , was the symbol of the horror of beslan .
consolation : the beslan survivor georgij lyin with his mother fatima after the siege of 2004 , to the right a picture of georgij today on the right a picture of georgij a picture of georgij today .
his blood-blown face was drawn by fear when he was fighting for his life , while chechnya terrorists were killing his class comrades .
his image was one of the most shocking symbols of the barbarism of beslan .
his mother fatima , 54 , a doctor , had named him for his first day of school before she left los rushed to leave her older son vladimir to university .
&quot; i left the farm about two minutes before the terrorists overthrew him , and so the rest of my little boy was there for three terrible days , &quot; she remembers .
not quite alone , there was a whole family of relatives of us , but they were all killed .
only my georgij managed to survive .
the closer this date approaches , the more difficult it is to remember and to talk about it .
there is not a single day when we cannot remember this tragedy .
we do not think it was long ago , i think it would have happened yesterday , some scenes from these days are still watching me .
no one will ever forget that , i promise you .
the picture of georgian president george ( left ) was one of the most shocking of the attack and was seen as a statue ( right ) eternal .
i remember that georgij was there on that day so happy to go to school , he said he wanted to rearm his teacher .
i knew that he was alive and that he was not here on television .
and now there is even this statue of the weeping georgij in san marino .
georgij doesn &apos;t like the picture and it is at home in our book shelf .
i understand that , but i also think that people around the world , thanks to this image , feel our pain .
georgij says today : &quot; it is important not to repeat this .
&quot; i doubt that we will ever know the truth .
people are investigating such tragedies over and over again and never know the truth .
and now you are investigating the crash of this boeing in ukraine .
will we ever know what caused it ?
this world will become something terrible .
&quot; i cannot understand how this is possible , because if you ask people , nobody wants to win a war , so how is that happening ?
ten years is not the end of such pain .
we need dozens of years to make it a little forgotten .
it has affected my health and i always feel it .
about three or four years ago i had a few nightmares because of the siege , but then it became better .
i went back to school later in 2004 and was afraid every day .
i thought about my friends and classmates who were killed and who were killed .
that is why i always go to the sports hall when the 1st of september is approaching .
i want to use my old friends to pay tribute .
it is difficult for me to go to the sports hall , but i must do it .
i do not feel a victim , this story is now part of my past .
i will not forget it , but i am not sorry .
my life goes on .
i have finished school this year and i have visited a medical college in vladikawkaz .
i will be heart surgeon .
my first choice was to train in the army .
i wanted to become a soldier , but my health didn &apos;t allow it .
i wanted to fight for my country , but that will not happen .
georgij faniyev , 20 years ago , 20 years ago , the first of 20 years of the world &apos;s leading manufacturers of the faniyev , 20 years ago , 20 years ago , the company was founded in the usa .
the boy who survived , although he was at the foot of a murderous terrorist , was a man who was a victim of a murderous terrorist attack .
a miracle : georgij faniyev was too fond of a murderer during the siege , but he did not manage to make his survival .
during the siege , he was held in the sports hall and sat next to the bomb that was at the foot of a murderous terrorist .
it is a real miracle that he has not been killed .
&quot; we feel it was yesterday that the first thing we heard was &quot; georgij , who was the secret service officer of the fsb , but he was not doing so because of his health damage caused by the siege .
it is still with me , it is not something i left behind .
i am now older and people say that children can easily be brought to grief by bad experiences - i have to say that is not true .
&quot; in 2006 i worked with psychologists and after that i really felt a little better , but i can not forget .
and i would like to forget .
2005 - the year after - was the first and only time i had returned to the sports hall .
i lost consciousness .
i will never go back there again and ask me not to tell you what is going on in this famous image .
survivors : georgij faniyev today , with a photo of himself in the hospital after the siege on the laptop on the laptop .
my pain is immense and i wear it every day with me .
my friends know that i do not like to think about it or talk about it , and they never asked me about it .
physically i am doing well .
i should be careful with my injured knee , but i can run well now .
but because of my health i could not attend the secret service academy of the fsb in saint petersburg , as i wanted .
i have my documents , including the medical papers and you have replied that it is not possible .
my second passion was the animals , so i went to the veterinary institute .
i have been there for two years .
he learns the treatment of all animals &quot; from cats to cows &quot; .
he said : &apos; i knew i had to never tell my children about my experiences .
children should not know about this and they should not suffer from it , of course .
his mother marina , 42 , said : &quot; this pain never leaves me .
he is in my soul , worse if the anniversary is approaching .
i will be present at the commemoration ceremonies .
i know that georgij will not go .
it is still a lot more violent for him , because he was there and i was not .
i waited at home for him and could not help .
i am so grateful to god that he has been returned to me , and here in beslan , everyone is drawn .
it remains in us .
georgij is now an adult , but this horror is still in him .
it is difficult to accept that if something is as unfair as it is , then it is not .
he is a boy , he likes sport , but he cannot participate because of his knees .
he has been operated several times , he can run but he can &apos;t do any sport .
i would say that he has to put the horror over 50 % , but it is never entirely possible to overcome it and forget it .
this terrible experience will always be with us .
many friends and neighbours were killed in the siege and this only reinforces my pain .
i have lost many people i knew well and who are dear to me .
my son is with me , and that is the greatest gift that god could make me , but my heart crying for the killed .
i know of families where new children were born , but also of widows who never had to be married again .
it is difficult to accept that life will continue , even if you do not want it .
i will never forget how my heart jumped in me when i saw him in hospital .
and now i see what is going on in the world - wars in other regions .
what are these people fighting for ?
why are they killing each other ?
war has now become very close to our country and i can hardly believe that .

4 tips for better underwater photos and videos .
if you like to take photos or videos under water , there is a selection of equipment .
the cheapest option is a waterproof point antenna shoot , like the nikon coolpix awn120 or a flash action shoot .
i took these photos at a family party with several cameras , all at a price of less than $ 350 .
regardless of the equipment , there are some rules for the best results .
check your equipment twice .
even if you have a waterproof camera , make sure that the camera is not in the battery compartment and other subjects .
adjust your camera to the photos or videos you want to record .
some cameras and camcorder have scene and recording modes .
and before you jump in , check to which depth your equipment is functional .
some cameras are only available for up to 5 feet , others up to 50 or 60 feet .
search our shopping guide and reviews for digital cameras for conventional cameras and water slides .
take multiple shots - because many will not fold .
point-and-shoot cameras feature a lcd , which allows you to compile images .
even if you have an lcd , it is difficult to see this under water , and the right image setting is a fortune .
so take a lot of pictures .
if your camera is in order , you can use a series of images with slightly modified exposure settings .
stay close to the surface .
the light is dramatically worse as it moves away from the surface .
so , if possible , they remain close to the surface when they take pictures in a pool , a lake or the sea .
this allows you to add more color to your photos ; the deeper you go , the less color you will see .
go close to the objects .
this is also a good advice on land , but it is all the more important under water because of the poor lighting conditions .
it is particularly important when you are working with an action cam : these devices often have a fixed wide-angle lens .
andrew lawson was a man of the variety whose character changed things , even in such a gigantic organization as the nhs .
as an advisory anaesthesia doctor , he devoted his career to the task of helping the sick both to the agony of the disease and to the pain of treatment .
among his patients , his wife remembers , was a mi6 employee who was dealing with the devastating effects of torture .
lawson knew that the doctors were given the diagnosis and disease .
one day in 2007 , however , he was the one whose path of suffering began .
&quot; i did not feel , &quot; wrote he in may this year .
i had difficulty getting up .
while he was dealing with influenza like symptoms , he noticed that he was not giving his wife juliet impatiently .
&quot; i want to do everything better immediately than later , &quot; he noted .
as juliet for a week on a business trip , lavson felt quite unusual in his attitude and without reason .
something was wrong with the air .
he asked a colleague to have an x-ray examination of his breast .
only two weeks ago , he was in the french alps for skiing .
the result of the x-ray test was available .
he suffered from mesothelium , an incurable cancer that has destroyed the breast coat , that is , the skin that overlaps the lungs .
as with most cancers , the exact trigger is usually difficult to determine .
while some smokers , for example , are suffering from lung cancer , not all lung cancer are diagnosed earlier by smokers .
but mesotheliom is different .
in almost all cases , the trigger is an asbestos strain - contact with the fibre building material once known as &quot; miracle material &quot; but has now been recognized as lethal .
for most of us , mestheliom is a disease that can easily ignore .
asbestos is , after all , a product of the past .
the most dangerous type of asbestos has been banned in britain since the 1960s , when the industry voluntarily committed itself to withdrawing its use .
even where it was still used , people only work in certain sectors directly with the substance - plumber , construction workers , carpenter and shipyard workers , for example .
as an industrial hazardous substance from another time , it seems today hardly worrying .
but this complacency is inappropriate .
britain , it seems , is now experiencing the peak of a mesoltheliom epidemic .
there are more deaths from mesothelium here than in any other country in the world .
with a total of 2,500 deaths per year , twice the number of people dying from this disease than road accidents .
annual figures of the mesothelium deaths since 1980 and prospective future deaths in the uk
the reason we have not yet seen the fatal effects , although asbestos has been illegal for years ( 1999 all types of asbestos were banned ) is that a mesthelium only develops after decades .
and the scourge of the mesotheliom is not attributed to former workers in the construction industry .
asbestos was , and is often still present , in the homes in which we live , the offices in which we work , the schools in which we learn and the shops in which we shop .
and thus , mestheliom knows no class barriers , financial limits , professions , or age .
the privileged bastions , surrounded by the elegant department stores in london and private schools , are not a shelter .
the parliament buildings are asbestos contaminated .
in hospitals where we have healthier health , too , we have already started to look at this deadly carcinogen .
andrew lawson was not old .
he was also not a plumber .
he was actually hard hit to imagine that the world was perhaps the most dangerous place to contact asbestos .
then he found out .
&quot; it looks as if in the tunnels at guy &apos;s park , the road is still in the middle of the hospital where i was trained for six years .
all - students , nurses , doctors and nurses - benefit from the tunnel .
one wonders how many of my colleagues in the same illness will suffer from it ?
unfortunately , he was able to answer at least part of the question .
&quot; of the four doctors who were at guy &apos;s hospital , the most recent and most recent have been in hospital .
how many of us will still be sick ?
andrew lawson was appointed mestheliom at the age of 48 .
when he was born on 17 february this year , he was 55 .
this was an unusually long lifetime .
fifty per cent of all mesothelio transmitters die within 8 months of diagnosis .
the disease always ends up fatal .
we can therefore only ask lawson &apos;s question : &quot; how many of us will still be sick ? &quot;
the uk &apos;s leading expert on mesotheliom , professor julian peto , participates in the study of the human condition between 1870 and 2050 .
most of them do not yet know that they are dying in this way .
an asbestos mine in quebec , canada alamy , canada alamy , canada , canada alamy , canada , canada alamy , canada , canada , and the united states .
a short look at the files of the courts , to which the persons concerned are often referred for claims for damages , shows how far the scourge of the mesthelium is already spreading .
in june this year marks &amp; spencer admitted , for example , that he was giving all negligent asbestos to janice .
she worked for nine years for the chain , from 1978 to 1987 , and was responsible for the clothing department at two locations - one of which is the flagship store in oxford street .
mr. allen was only 18 years old when she started her business at m &amp; s .
now she has two children in the twenties .
&quot; before this matter , &quot; she says , &quot; i had never heard of mesotheliom , i had not even really heard anything about asbestos .
i never thought that i would be affected .
there are few people who know a lot about asbestos .
the fact is that the term asbestos does not refer to a substance , but to a group of six minerals .
the name derives from the word &quot; asbestos &quot; , a description of the fibre structure that makes the fabric resistant and flexible .
three of the six were used in the construction industry .
chrysotile , also known as white asbestos , is the most common asbestos today .
it was designed for roofing plates , floor boards , rohinsulation , floor insulation , even for brake pads in cars .
it is less fatal than other forms of asbestos , but it is still regarded by the eu and the who as &apos; major health risk &apos; with possible death .
more dangerous , however , is the brown asbestos ( amosit ) and the blue asbestos ( krokydolith ) .
britain was once the world ’ s largest importer of brown asbestos , and experts suspect that “ there are clear , but indirect , indications that this is a major reason for the uniquely high mesothelium rates . ”
a member of marks &amp; spencer was arrested in the flagship store in oxford street , london , asbestos exposed alamy .
janice allen may not have proven to be a typical mesotheliopfer , but the work of julian peto suggests that he is a true mesopopper .
he has presented a study of the people affected , which shows that &apos; a substantial proportion of mestheliomas without known suspension through work or in this house probably caused by asbestos contact in the environment &apos; .
much of these contacts are based on the &quot; normal use and ageing &quot; of our buildings .
it looks as if nobody can assume that they are safe .
a report by goddard consulting , which has taken over the palace of westminster , shows how people can also live in the heart of the government , unknowingly exposed to the substance .
in 2009 , goddard reported that the service levels and pipelines behind the comitology rooms of parliament were contaminated with asbestos , the fatal fibres of which were caused by something as harmless as &quot; strong air flows &quot; .
members of parliament are often accused of taking care of their own interests , but this is where it appears that there is the opposite .
while the directorate of the parliamentary labour service insisted that the westminster palace should be a &apos; clean health certificate &apos; , it has become clear that the commission has made eur 1 billion of work over several years .
the goddard report also pointed out that &apos; the existence of nuclear weapons is not sufficiently recognised in accordance with the relevant provisions . &apos;
no one can know whether this mismanagement will cost lives .
all you can do now is wait .
a person who has lost contact with asbestos is graham abbott , a general practitioner .
as andrew lawson suggests , the 50-year-old abbott that he was in hospital during his work , was exposed to asbestos .
&quot; i have worked in a hospital where asbestos actions have been positively decided , &quot; he says , &quot; but i can &apos;t prove it in my case .
it is so difficult to get to all the places where you have worked and to which data you have been working .
what he is still very much aware of is the day at the beginning of december 2009 when he was getting a kind of fever .
he was 45 , and just late in the evening carried out an operation .
suddenly i had shaking frost .
it came very suddenly .
i felt horrible .
i thought the trip home was not to create any more .
as a doctor , abbott knew that the pain was caused by the chest coat , the skin around his lungs .
but as janice allen had no reason to build a mesotheliom .
he did not go to work for a month .
if doctors were surprised , x-rays of his breast and put pleuracathether on to keep fluid out of the lungs and to be in the laboratory .
his complaints , however , remained undiagnosed .
his health was slowly improving , and he returned to his job .
from time to time , the symptoms returned , often after physical activity .
in 2011 , a patient came to the hospital with similar symptoms in his practice and was later diagnosed with mesotheliom .
but even now , abbott did not associate this with his own case .
after all , his patient was several decades older and had to work directly with asbestos .
the connection in this case was clear .
in september 2011 , abbott ’ s condition deteriorated again , and his doctor brought his ct scans and x-ray recordings to a group of experts .
in december 2011 , exactly two years after abbott first became ill , he was forced to leave the country with a camera equipped with a probe .
i am an optimist .
i usually just continue to say , &quot; he says .
to be honest , i didn &apos;t have so many concerns .
but rachel , my wife , was concerned .
the result of biopsy was between christmas and new year &apos;s weeks. it was said to me that mesotheliom was .
graham abbott : diagnosis mesotheliom diagnosis
suddenly abbott had appointments with macmillan-nurses , of whom one would recommend to him to take a lawyer .
only now did he understand the extent of the epidemic .
&quot; it turned out that asbestos was very widespread , especially in large public buildings where pipes are often mixed with asbestos , &quot; he says .
the people who are exposed to asbestos in these buildings are now suffering .
and so mestheliom now meets younger people who are not in the typical professions .
the most dangerous asbestos tubes in hospitals were located below the ground , so patients were probably not exposed to the substance .
but many employees who work in pedestrian tunnels from one building to another ( like andrew lambert , ) or in underground tunnels under the roof of the building ( as graham abbott often did ) , did .
it is evident that , for several decades after the war , hospitals may have saved patients &apos; lives , but life-threatening patients &apos; treatment of their own health .
it will still be removed today .
students presented their bunsenbrenner on asbestos mats .
and it does not just concern hospitals .
asbestos has been used as a chemical agent for its fabulous insulating and flame retarding properties , often in offices , shops , libraries and town halls .
schools too .
indeed , many people probably have the first asbestos contact in the classroom .
throughout the country , thousands of chemical hours , students have learned to use bunsenburner on asbestos mats .
on websites the subject of asbestos is now frequently raised in schools .
and meanwhile , innocent objects have been found in our houses such as flooring or scalp pockets by default .
&quot; it is an industrial poison that is in large parts of our properties , &quot; says andrew morgan , the lawyer , who andrew lawson in his process against guy &apos;s .
in one case , the only contact that was made to a woman concerned , the demolition of a garden scrapp in the 1970s .
so make sure you have your gardening scales cut off .
the effects of diagnosis , and knowing that the disease is incurable , is immense .
&quot; it takes a while to process it , &quot; says graham abbott .
i went back to work and tried to continue , but i noticed that i was not really on the focus .
i was two weeks in practice .
then i knew that i would go and take care of myself .
well , i won &apos;t be going to see another christmas .
the most difficult thing was the change of perspective from a doctor &apos;s position to a patient &apos;s position .
how countless patients before him he remembers how overwhelmed he is by all the information he has been given .
&quot; it was very difficult to record all this , &quot; he says .
&quot; i asked my doctor &quot; how long do i have ? &quot;
and i was told about 12 months .
i remember having been thinking that &quot; well , i am going to do no more christmas !
that was then . &apos;
mesotheliom is particularly insidious because it is our life preservation mechanism - breathing itself - that does not allow fatal cancer .
most cases of mesotheliom are caused by asbestos contact .
asbestos is made up of the smallest fibers .
if asbestos is ironed and the fibres are inhaled , they can be removed in the chest coat , the skin around the lungs .
asbestos fibres irritate the chest coat and can trigger cell mutations .
&quot; the problem arises with the inhaled needle shaped asbestos fibres , &quot; according to professor tom treasure , a heart / thorax doctor who died in 2001 at the guy &apos;s hospital .
it is precisely the hospital that andrew lawson suspects will be the asbestos that has now been exposed to it that is now ironically a leading centre for the treatment of mestheliom .
treasure knew lawson and betrayed some others who probably also had to be in hospital during their training .
once asbestos needles reach the lung tissue , treasure says , &quot; will you be taken away from the breathing process to the edge where the skin is .
it is inherently invasive from the outset .
the usual options for other cancers are not working with mesothelium .
the effectiveness of an operation is highly controversial , for example .
some say that they are worth trying .
treasure does not .
&quot; you can use the chest coat , &quot; he says .
you will not come around the knife with it .
meanwhile , cancer speaks &quot; on chemotherapy is not very good , &quot; the &quot; effect shows &quot; , but does not heal .
&quot; sometimes there are long-term survivors , &quot; says treasure .
but in the end they all die .
fortunately , some patients actually live long , much longer than expected .
the author stephen jay gould died 20 years after diagnosis .
two and a half years after his own diagnosis , graham abbott is still struggling .
after he contacted mesotheliom , abbott came into contact with andrew lawson , who was diagnosed with a one-man sclerosis and counselling office four years after his diagnosis .
&quot; hello , cancer center , &quot; he asked for a happy answer on calls .
&quot; he was very positive , &quot; says abbott .
he had his diagnosis 4 years earlier and was still very active .
abbott originally used six chemotherapy cycles , which were used for four months and presumably only for one month .
&quot; i was desperate , &quot; he says .
i wanted to give up .
lawson managed to &quot; change things in a somewhat more positive way &quot; , but he was unable to do so .
after consulting several doctors , the company decided to offer its treatment with prof. loic lang-lazdunski , heart therapist and physician at the guy &apos;s advanced .
&quot; we had an advantage by not referring to the fact that i didn &apos;t call anymore , i just called and got an appointment , &quot; says graham .
a normal patient would require a transfer and would be required to obtain the treatment .
money is crucial for mestheliom-sufferers to obtain the best available therapies .
but if these treatments are inevitable , they are often at risk of being undermined by another financial concern - the future of families that leave them .
and so they turn to the courts in the hope of compensation .
andrew lawson contacted andrew morgan of field field fisher wagerhouse llp .
&quot; it has been known since 1898 that asbestos is extremely dangerous for health , &quot; says morgan .
but what happened in the 1960s is that one realized that the us was also a very small burden .
and here the negligence of companies began to play a role .
andrew lawson and guy &apos;s hospital set up their case at last , but it was not that which morgan had a &quot; full &quot; compensation .
after his death , the court of auditors ’ spokesman confirmed that the guy &apos;s asbestos fibres were not used in the cellar area in the 1990s .
that was a very important step for andrew lawson .
how to remove asbestos
in fact , it is very difficult for mesotheliom sufferers who seek compensation to have an enormous problem , the deadly asbestos contact of a company or workplace - usually decades after the incidents .
many of their former employers have been sold or closed .
insurance documents can be lost .
and those who defend themselves against claims know that the time for them is when they are , but certainly not with the plaintiffs .
in response , there have been clear new legislation this year that makes it easier for mestheliom-affected individuals to obtain compensation .
the law has a ban on the use of credit cards in a fund funded by the insurance industry of £ 350 million .
in these cases , the plaintiffs receive 80 % of what a court claims in a normal compensation process .
some 300 successful applications will be submitted to the programme every year .
andrew morgan , like so many mesotheliom-sufferers , thinks that 350 million £ is a &quot; very good job &quot; of the insurance industry .
&quot; this is a deal of insurers for insurers , &quot; he says , and suggests that it is a deal of money .
mike penning , the then working and pension minister , also said that the european parliament &apos;s &apos; not perfect &apos; law was not perfect .
but both penning and morgan admitted that , with seven deaths on a daily basis , rapid action is needed .
&quot; people suffer so much and need help today , &quot; said penning during the second hearing of the mestheliom law in december last year .
at that time , graham abbott had been in the hands of prof. loic lang-lazdunski for 19 months .
after your first deliberations , lang-lazdunski recommended an operation which , unlike tom , he had never expected to have a positive effect .
this was done by radiation therapy and chemotherapy - a three-fold therapy .
abbott felt strengthened .
&quot; this is of course the most important , &quot; says abbott .
we see this again and again in patients .
there is something that can keep you going .
if you give up , it is very fast worse .
graham abbott underwent a major surgery in march 2012 .
at the end of august , he had the last of the six chemotherapy cycles behind him .
nachsorgescans showed no signs of the disease .
then i had a scam in march 2014 .
there were several cancer spots around my breast .
i have just been born 50 .
this is not life-threatening .
this is a life-end .
again , abbott underwent six chemotherapy cycles .
now there is no trace of tumors .
but the process is physical and mental very strenuous .
they must think about practical things - about the money , if i am no longer , for example , or my wife show how the boiler time setting works .
if you get bad news , you will be negative .
they must look to the future .
as the father of ellie , 16 , and tamsin , 14 , this is not always easy .
&quot; for parents , this is difficult , &quot; he says .
it is hard to know what to say and how much .
when i first got my diagnosis , i told my girl that i had a disease i could not get old with .
they responded in very different ways .
tamsin is very sociable and disgusted .
she told her to her friends and we soon got a lot of calls .
ellie was more cautious .
she did not say much .
such talks are something that all cancer patients can go through .
but for mesotheliofeature sectors , such talks have not been carried out with hope , not a trace of hope for survival .
the disease brings ( as eventually also stephen jay goddould ) a grim security .
as andrew morgan says , &quot; mesotheliom is not life-threatening .

a health and safety authority in the uk obliges all companies that work with asbestos to acquire licences .
the import and use of blue and brown sugar is a major legal requirement in the uk .
any use of asbestos is prohibited in the uk .
the mestheliom law is adopted in the united kingdom .
a compensation programme of eur 350 million is announced .
asbestos is banned in more than 50 countries , but white asbestos is still used as an affordable building material in many countries of the world .
global production is around 2 million tonnes per year .
china is refusing hong kong to vote for government , demonstrators swear by retaliation , and the chinese are retaliating .
on sunday , despite the failure of the chinese government to make more democratic reforms , the chinese parliament decided against the nomination of candidates for the 2017 elections by hong kong ’ s electorate .
this approach probably fights the long-announced protests in hong kong , hong kong ’ s commercial district , while activists are blocking planning and mobilisation to do so within hours of the announcement .
the decision of the chinese people ’ s congress allows communist leaders to change all non-peking chinese candidates , and to do so .
&quot; that is not unexpected , but it makes us angry , &quot; said legal expert emily lau , chairman of the democratic party .
that is not what beijing promised .
the people of hong kong were lied to .
and it is clear that we are dealing with an authoritarian regime .
in its defence of the chinese decision , li fei , vice secretary general of the standing committee of the national people &apos;s congress , said that the approval of public nominations for the hong kong government to &apos; chaotic &apos; would be .
since 1997 , when britain lost control of hong kong to the chinese , peking has promised to keep the people from 2017 to hold the presidency .
china ’ s leaders presented sunday ’ s decision as a democratic breakthrough , because it made it possible for hong kong ’ s citizens to vote directly , but the decision also makes it clear that china ’ s leaders are following the process closely by a beijing nomination .
a new clause also requires candidates to be &quot; lovingly and lovingly &quot; accepted for hong kong .
the decision follows a summer in which some of the largest and most effective protesters in hong kong are being held in jail for several years .
behind the pro-democratic campaign in hong kong is the occupy central movement with love and peace , which is the organizers of which is threatening to disrupt the financial district .
on sunday evening , in a few hours after the announcement , hundreds of people from occupy-central-supporters had met in the rain before the government headquarters in hong kong .
at the demonstration , the organizers said that their movement would take a new stage of civil disobedience and that it would protest in the coming weeks .
however , they did not provide any further information on this , apparently to avoid problems with the authorities .
in an online communication , the organizers announced that the movement &quot; the occupation of the central district is only considered as a last resort .
we are sorry to have to say that all the opportunities for dialogue have been exhausted today and the appointment of the central district has definitely taken place .
the hong kong authorities have been preparing for the announcement of beijing ’ s decision for days , and it was on sunday before the government building that security measures were tightened , including police forces and barricades .
the unrest is caused by the feeling of many in hong kong that they are slowly losing control of their city .
the movement of people from the mainland is increasing competition for products and services .
moreover , there is growing fear that hong kong ’ s values of democracy and freedom of speech will be eroded under growing pressure from beijing .
some criticized the occupy-central-movement demonstrations , because they did not allow business operations - the lifeline of hong kong .
&quot; the protests they speak of could be of great economic damage , depending on how many people are involved and how long they are going to last , &quot; said legal experts regine ip , who is the movement for long criticizing .
we do not want to raise fears that hong kong will get out of control .
this impression is bad for investment .
state-controlled media have reported that china has recently reported the democratic activist in hong kong as being run by western powers .
this summer , activists organised an unofficial referendum on the electoral rights to which 780,000 people were participating - more than a fifth of the voters in hong kong .
in july , tens of thousands took part in one of the greatest democratic demonstrations in the region ’ s history .
the tradition of school graduation balls in the us is now being transferred to universities where freshmen perform performances with the private aircraft .
we are looking forward to responding to this demand and to offering the first luxurious travel service in britain for students of today .
to make a particularly impressive appearance at the university , the company also offers transportation options for the entire city , such as private aircraft , rolls-royce phantom , aston marten or mclaren p1 .
mr stewart also stated that the service is a security division .
this service is an ideal alternative for students who would otherwise have to change their habits in a dangerously overloaded car through the country .
together with our new vif options , we look forward to making sure that the new vif students will have a minimum of effort and a maximum of knowledge of the university .
a corporate spokesman said that no new bookings have been made yet , as the service has only just been introduced , but added that the &quot; students have to pay for the service in the next few weeks &quot; .
the company also announced that despite the study fees of 9,000 £ per year , it had created a market for this offer .
students today differ in their expectations and requirements very much from the students 10 , 20 , 30 or 40 years ago - it is more important than ever to have a great first impression , and with vif you can do just that .
the national student union criticized the service as being out-of-date .
megan dunn , vice president of nus for higher education said : &quot; this offer seems to be completely separate from the lives of the majority of students .
many students who have completed their studies this month face a crisis of living costs .
feminists criticize race and police behavior after ferguson
the unarmed teenager was arrested earlier this month by a police officer in ferguson , mon .
the participants raised their hands in the air and sang , &quot; hands up , not shoot , &quot; while they were warned of burial .
after two weeks of protests in ferguson , mo , on account of the shooting of the unarmed teenager michael brown , the bloggers miriam zoila perrez noticed a change in the way .
according to their experience , white feminist commentators put gender before race when it comes to the promotion of reproductive rights and income inequality .
while tensions in the middle west have increased and attention has been paid to the country as a whole , perez saw that white women ’ s responses were 100 % racial .
compared to the answers black women have just after the shots of 9 august , the personal essays have been given with titles such as &quot; thoughts to ferguson of a white woman &quot; and &quot; feminism is not only about oppression .
but for perez , this meant an important change .
&quot; i do not think that feminism can find many people who know what it means and who have privileges on such a high class level , &quot; she said .
people felt they were being pushed to do something about the incidents .
it is characteristic of the crisis we are in and because the situation in remote guinea is so ethnically so that it expresses what it means .
for english professor koritha mitchell of the ohio state university , he has taught at the university of california problems that black americans have been facing every day .
&quot; i can do something funny on facebook about me and my partner and get 150 likes from anywhere , &quot; said mitchell .
if i post something about how coloured in your own country are being under siege , the silence is earthy .
&quot; how can it be safe for women to publicly talk about a relationship , but not about public security ? &quot; he asked .
for black women such as mitchell , race , gender and sexuality in the history of the us , there is no density in the relationship between race and sexual orientation .
for them , black women do not have the luxury of cleansing up the issues ; they live every day in the combined reality .
while white women now discuss race and gender in the fetish and feminist mainstream circles , angela hattery says , professor of gender equality and gender equality , that they are not .
&quot; between 1865 and 1890 , at least 10,000 black men were yellow and the explanatory statement was almost always the rape of a white woman , &quot; said hattery .
white women had to be involved in history to make lynch murder a reality .
for hattery , the division between white and black women came at the point where white fighters were responsible for the right to vote in women , such as susan b. anthony , in the late nineteenth century ’ s , analyzed the country and analyzed it for the late years .
&quot; they decided to opt for the right to vote for women , and the right to vote for black people should come later , &quot; said hattery .
if we remember such things , we are aware of the power of the colour women who do not trust white women .
we have not done our job well .
we have never helped black women to get their husbands and sons protected .
even after women had acquired the right to vote in 1920 , it took a decade for white women to defend themselves against lynching in the association of soviet-style women .
the group was established almost 40 years after the initial request for help from black women , says mitchell .
for mitchell , the flood of white feminist reactions to the problems raised by ferguson - police behaviour , racial discrimination - is a reflection of the time when white feminists &quot; catch up with &quot; .
&quot; would it not be great if the activists who have such traditional feminist platforms were to have the right to education of a child as serious as they are ?
feminists of the second generation who have continued their careers in the struggle for reproduction rights and access to contraceptive means , have been trying to find out what is the meaning .
the famous white feminist activist gloria steiner went to the united states two weeks after the shooting of michael brown on facebook and published a pointed article by rebecca carroll , who was released .
&quot; i hope that women who have a different but parallel reason to do so will have a more inherent danger to the body - and opinions on rearing race , which is in public polls are clearly different - can cause changes .
although stones are a very intersectional feminism , in which racial and gender differences are raised , the issues of some of their comments on racial semantics in america are astonishing .
christina sommers. researcher at the american enterprise institute and author of &quot; who stüle feminism ? &quot; said to she the people , that young men in the united states , especially young farmers .
there are now hundreds of special programmes for girls and young women , but almost nothing for boys .
but when the white house recently launched a small program , my brother &apos;s keeper , i was trying to find vulnerable young black and hispanic men , there were annoying reactions from many feminists who were among them .
the relationship between the police and the black community is not the only problem that has come to the fore of mainstream feminism .
after the us border police have been able to release nearly 63,000 unaccompanied minors on the country ’ s southwest border this year , the issue of immigration reform is back on the surface , this time as a women ’ s issue .
andrea mercado , co-chairman of we belong together , an organization that has made women responsible for immigration reform , has said that the eu needs a new perspective on the issue .
&quot; they speak for themselves , &quot; said mercado .
if the vast majority of working visas are sent to male immigrants , the women who are in need of them are in a position where they are responsible for domestic work .
&quot; these stories find a lasting impact on women &apos;s organisations , &quot; she said .
&quot; schweine-haus &quot; in ipswich stands for sale in the pig swich .
the image of a house for sale was taken away by real estate agents when it became clear that there was a big pig that it had been comfortably in the living room .
the detached house has one bedroom , located on a private street in ipswich and is used for £ 120,000 .
the details included an image of the living room of the house - including a pig .
real estate brokers connells said that the pig in the photo was the pet of the owner .

the hotel ’ s exposure described connells ’ earlier meeting meeting house as a “ unique event ” , a house with a bedroom .
although the broker has the image removed from the website , it still appears on advertising material .
the sale of the house provided interest in the social media , as some asked whether the pig was included in the purchase price .

leonidas asked the gladiator to be invited to the gladiator arena .
not only the gladiators were standing ankle deep in the match at the first römertag in the freizeitpark .
but the attraction of the event was strong enough to go beyond 1000 visitors yesterday .
there was a colourful series of representations , performances , games , exhibition pieces and information about the time of the romans and their importance for the rhine .
the main attraction of the day was undoubtedly the martialic warrior force of the gladiator school &quot; amor mortis &quot; , which was responsible for every rainy break in which the force was equipped with soft sand .
gladiator owner &quot; leonidas &quot; proved to be a humorous and knowledgeable presenter and sent his own works to the united states in a row .
first , the &quot; provocateurs &quot; were on the series with rectangular shield and short sword , as well as leg track on the left leg and arm rail on the right arm .
the &quot; essedarii &quot; followed with breast sign , short sword and litter lanze , as well as iron gladiator helmet , legs and arms .
the first time the &quot; reticarius &quot; was played with wurfnetz , triangle and dagger against the &quot; secutor &quot; .
the swords metallic clash , the shields of shepperts and the throwing pins flown surrendering through the arena that gives fear and bang to one .
but the impressive “ green ” of the “ green ” of the “ mucus ” shooting referee had always been a close eye .
&quot; we wanted to rediscover the everyday life of rome and to preserve the culture of the roman era &quot; , explained lorenz euskirchen , chairman of the organizer &quot; friends of the römer channel &quot; , who visited the city .
after two years of preparation , the theme park was turned into a &quot; opportidum romanum &quot; for a day , a roman city , such as vice mayor claus whage in his greeting .
after all , the romans have not only won war and conquest in our region , but also the roman culture and numerous structures that we still admire today .
the remains of this were also visible at the roman day , such as &quot; aqueduct marble &quot; , from the elf meter high and 1400 meters long roman bridge .
the frontini company provided the water and energy supply to the people , and the managing director petra fricke knew : &quot; we are still taking advantage of the knowledge of that time &quot; .
this also confirms diploma surveying engineer ralph heiliger of the &quot; engineering team two &quot; from rheinbach , the survey instruments of the romans such as chorobat , groma or dioptra .
the romans villa in blankenheim presented sketch and models of the excavations anno 1894 and bricks from the original hypo caste , the warmlwing heater , the once the roman wall .
the footprints , which were taken by wolf and fox two years ago , in the footsteps of the sound , are impressive .
in 2011 , the state of the land conservation office had awarded the rhineland regional association the remains of a roman villa in the nord industrial park in rheinbach .
they have built walls of an economic building with a darre for drying cereals and for mowing .
the building probably led to a villa rustica , a farm , explained the history of the archaeologist dr. jennifer morshiser .
a number of finds from these excavations have been found in a glass cabinet , including a large plate , several finds of glass vessels and a part of a delicate half-scattered necklace .
the villa was probably built between the first and fourth centuries ad , until the beginning of the 20th century , when the germans invaded the rhineland of the roman empire .
it was also the subject of the roman windmill game , similar to today &apos;s mill game , or it was written as if the roman windmill had given their names to the wax tablets .
at the stand of the römerthermen zülpich , the children were allowed to put mosaics themselves , to take part in the stand of the rhine bach glass mosaics and to stand at the eifel .
the new , with the “ green ” approach drawn by two cold-blown original roman vans , was a great opportunity to explore the theme park and to enjoy the impressive status of the city gymnasium , which is now available .
with a roman week from september 13 to 21 , the town of wachtberg will also be extended into the römerjahr 2014 , which will be reminded of the death of emperor augustus 2000 years ago .
together with the home and history associations and the watchberger wander-verein , the partnership association and the amateur playgroup oberbachem , thematic hikes , a lecture , cooking evenings and other .
for example , a roman legionnaire is being attacked by his work on the zuggegenen wachtberg , plants as living monuments from the roman era and a funny lesson in genocide .
the adendorfer primary school is dedicated to the development of the römerthema in the context of a project week .
the roman week is intended to highlight the numerous , but often not visible , spines of the romans in watchberg .
the wachtberger town hall offers a small presentation of the finds of the berkumer matron sanctuary in 1879 .
ebola – the epidemic is weighing on west africa ’ s economy and its economy , and is affecting the economy of west africa .
the ebola epidemic in west africa is also a serious blow to the economy .
markets are orphaned - and international companies are at a distance .
the devastating ebola epidemic is giving west africa ’ s economy a heavy blow .
the harvest rots on the fields , mines are leaving and the markets are watered down - the virus has left the region hard .
some international companies are already taking a distance .
&quot; the ebola epidemic is not only a medical crisis , but also an economic one , &quot; judges the head of the african development bank , donald kaberuka .
liberia is the hardest hit .
&quot; it is a total disaster , we lose a lot of money , &quot; says alhaji bamogo , who is on the second largest market in liberia &apos;s capital , monrovia .
the only thing that comes on the market is who has food or something to buy against ebola .
liberia is the hardest hit by the virus , but here alone the fever fell more than 600 people .
recently , health authorities declared that the disease was present at every corner of the country .
in guinea , sierra leone and nigeria , the virus has spread , too .
in total , more than 1500 people have died , thousands more have died .
foreign companies are relocating workers
everywhere in resource-rich countries , companies are starting their business .
foreign companies such as the arcelor mittal steel group are withdrawing their employees , several international airlines are not flying to the affected regions .
local traders and farmers are also reacting : few merchants are still leaving their homes to buy supplies .
in some areas of sierra leone and liberia , which are suffering from quarantine , the ruins of the former soviet union , which are important for exports , are destroying the soil .
farmers do not dare to pay their homes for harvesting .
food is scarcely sold
&quot; people will travel less and less , &quot; says phillipe de vreyer , paris expert for the economy of west africa .
the man , for example , who normally goes on to the market and sells his vegetables , would rather stay at home .
the population is therefore feeling the effects of the epidemic directly and urgently : food is scarce .
the market is undergoing a decline in stocks of basic foodstuffs such as rice .
at the same time , the region , which is heavily dependent on international companies , is threatened with damage to the image , with far-reaching consequences .
the greatest danger is that international companies will , in principle , avoid the area for a long time , says philippe hugon of the french think tank iris .
the crucial point is how far and how long the virus will spread .
the impression that investors have been given is that it is dangerous to invest in guinea , sierra leone and liberia , and thus to invest , &quot; huggon warns .
the disease also burdens the hard-pressed state budgets of the states that have adopted the euro zone and have suffered a serious blow to the state budgets of the member states .
the disease also burdens the already strained state budgets of the affected states .
the credit rating agency moody &apos;s fears that the financial impact of their budgets will be heavily influenced by the high expenditure on the health system and , in addition , by the worsening economy .
the african development bank has already promised to pay special attention to the health systems of the countries concerned , with usd 60 million ( eur 45 million ) .
the impact is already noticeable in nigeria , where few ecolabel cases have been diagnosed .
while the oil-rich region in the southern niger delta has not been affected to date .
but elsewhere , many people are already left out of fear of contagion .
reservations of hotels are also significantly reduced .

the original term &quot; shooters company tannenwald berngau &quot; was born in 1907 , when the association became a &quot; social entertainment through exercise in the room student-room and small cabin shooting &quot; on 21 march .
the nazi regime had ruled in 1937 the dissolution of the association .
only in 1964 did 19 young men find themselves , who were arrested on 30 april in guesthouse lukas and who had signed the &quot; new &quot; sützenverein &quot; tannenwald &quot; berngau .
karl march and adolf ried led the association as champion through a difficult initial period , in which it was mainly the aim of creating a universität and to prevent the shooting .
in the autumn of 1965 the shooters &apos; association started a project in the restaurant &quot; leininger &quot; with two teams in the round competitions .
in the following years , the sports scorers , who have now been organized into seven teams , established themselves in all classes up to the 1st gauliga .
the club records purzelles are annually and the magical border of 380 rings was first discovered by rudi meier in 1980 .
just as the performance of active shooters has increased , members ’ numbers have also improved .
after the club &apos;s &quot; leininger &quot; club is no longer up to the demands of a modern shooting association , the daimler ag board of directors at the time was able to make it a success .
after a workload of 2700 hours , on 8 may 1988 parish priest strasser granted the right to the church council of the new protective rooms .
one of the great highlights of the association &apos;s history was certainly the 44th gathering , connected with the festive consecration of the new flag in july 1991 .
on 23 and 24 april 1994 , the shooters &apos; association established its 30-year anniversary .
1995 is a böllergroup founded .
josef schmalzl was appointed böllerreferer .
a big challenge for the &quot; malterer &quot; and for the association as a whole was the orientation of the bavarian böllertreffen 2005 .
in many hours of volunteer work , the club members have visited the premises and shooting facilities in the berngau hof .

nato secretary general anders fogh rasmussen said on monday in brussels that nato is sticking to the nato treaty establishing the nato russia council of 1997 .
nato ’ s chief accused him of “ one crass brother ” in the agreement .

merkel speaks power word : toll will come &quot; very clear &quot; .
now the chancellor is once again clearly committed to this .
a licence for all the complicated details is not , however .
the persistent concerns from the cdu against the car toll have made the csu look increasingly unhappy .
chancellor angela merkel has called for continued resistance from her cdu to use a power word to introduce a car toll .
&quot; to be quite clear , it is in the coalition treaty , and it will come , &quot; said the party leader , on monday , after the cdu-top meetings , in berlin .
the company was able to rely on a detailed model for the time being .
in the black and red government program , &apos; certain parameters &apos; are mentioned .
federal minister of transport alexander dobrindt ( csu ) has &apos; made a proposal , and that is now being continued &apos; .
the nrw-cdu , however , insists on its &apos; no &apos; to a toll on all roads .
merkel stressed that finance minister wolfgang schäuble ( cdu ) was also constructively involved in the deliberations on a draft law .
beyond the subject , he has also worked with dobrindt on other ways of investing more private capital for infrastructure investments , including broadband , and so on .
&quot; there is nothing special about it &quot; , schäuble had a &quot; mirror &quot; report uncommented on sunday , his house looks at his own concept to make motorway routes investors with foot-tolls .
csu chef horst seehofer warned that the eu should not be allowed to charge toll concepts against the responsible minister in the cabinet .
cdu federal vize armin laschet reaffirmed its objections .
&quot; the coalition agreement never assumed that all circles and federal roads would be paved , &quot; said the north rhine regional council , the president of the republic of germany .
in this respect , it is an important signal that seehofer has now announced that he will be speaking again on the subject .
resistance to the plans is also coming from the cdu national associations of baden-württemberg and rhineland-palatinate .
the background to these concerns is that a toll will make it harder for small border traffic to neighbouring countries .
seehofer had a long time to get to the town because of the toll criticism from ranks of the cdu coalition .
the left sees the plans as a priority in view of the dispute in the union .
&quot; the murks toll is dead , &quot; said party leader bernd riixinger of the &quot; new osnabrück newspaper &quot; ( monday ) .
&quot; with the toll the minister fails &quot; . dobrindt wants to impose a vignette obligation on all german roads , which is to start in 2016 .
domestic car owners , according to the coalition agreement , must not be burdened further .
therefore , they should be able to make a full compensation for the toll via the car tax .
the model may not be used by foreign drivers , however , because of their nationality , in accordance with eu law .
genetic disorder often misdiagnosed ,
a british man says she thought that the disease was caused by a misdiagnosis for many years .
karin rodgers lived almost all her youth in the belief that she was only a few years away from her marriage to another illness .
she actually suffered from the charcot-marie-tooth disease ( cmt ) - a group of inherited disorders that have left nerves outside the brain and the spinal cord .
charity cmt uk announced that the bug tracking system has been a frequent problem for people with cmt who have been diagnosed with this disease .
about 23,000 people in the uk are likely to suffer from cmt , which causes motor disorders such as muscle weakness , an uncertain passage and curved toes .
patients also suffer from deafness or pain .
when rodgers 13 was , she believed that she was interested in friedrich ataxie ( ias ) - a disease with very bad survivors .
rodgers thought she would be in a wheelchair before she would be 18 , and before her 30th birthday she would die .
the mother of two children who are 51 today said : &apos; when a child knew that he was not a child , i would do the same as the others .
i always fell and everything took me longer .
i could never travel with other children rollshoe or skateboard and was often arrested in school for my kind of walking and running .
rodgers said that she was born at the age of 13 after several operations to relieve her achilles and stretching her feet .
&quot; i felt guilty because i was curious .
when i received a reply , i was shocked and dreadfully panicked .
i thought i was working with 18 wheelchair and i was dying with 25 , and in between all my skills would slowly lose all my skills .
i did all this alone with me and planned my own burial .
she said when she was 17 , she became clear that her skills were not so much reduced as she would have imagined and would have been asking her doctor .
he simply stood up and embraced me and said , &quot; my love , i do not think you have that , otherwise you would be already in a wheelchair . &quot;
i think you have a little less life-threatening .
after some genetic tests , cmt was found .
&quot; when he explained to me what cmt was , i felt as if i were a winner , &quot; said she .
charity cmt uk has released a cmt awareness report .
stofffeldwebel a. d. berni diether has been working since the closure of the former troop training place as a firefighter .
for almost ten years , the former troop training ground in münsingen has been closed down .
nevertheless , every month , fatal ammunition appears in the heart of the biosphere region of swabian alb .
the grenades are sometimes so dangerous that they are exploded on the ground .
a deafening sound of the ears is heard at the explosions over the heart of the biosphere reserve .
in december 2004 , the last shot of a sharp blow fell on münsingen ’ s troop practice square , which was closed at the end of 2005 after 110 years of military operations .
since then , the 6500 hectares of area has been the core of the biosphere area .
tax burdens on business in the area of washington are rising as the economy recovers .
economic recovery means more customers , more sales and new jobs .
it also means higher taxes .
government and local tax decisions for companies in the country increased slightly last year , while the economic recovery accelerated , so a newly published survey showed in the past week that the government firms were in the washington area .
companies in the district , maryland and virginia jointly paid 27.6 billion $ to state-owned and local authorities in the 2013 financial year , an increase of 3.8 % compared to the 2012 revenue of 26.7 billion .
the government and local tax burden on businesses increased by 4,3 % last year to 671 billion $ , compared to 3.9 % in 2006 .
government taxes increased more than local taxes , to raise 4.3 % , so the study suggests that the government services have already started to pay more .
more than half of district ’ s tax revenues , 56 % , come from corporate taxes , while 36 % of maryland ’ s revenue comes from businesses .
virginia achieves the lowest tax revenue from companies with 28 % .
much of the increase in tax revenue has been due to a recovery in the real estate values of companies , according to researchers , leading to an increase in real estate taxes of 3.7 % this year after the three successive years of growth .
while a large proportion of these profits come from large states such as california , new york , and texas , the process also seems to be true of the washington area .
district , maryland , and virginia jointly paid more than $ 10 billion to state and local real estate taxes last year , compared to $ 9.6 billion in 2012 - a rise in the course of a year of $ 4.2 .
but the apparent recovery in real estate values is not so good in maryland to increase government and local tax revenues , as the country ’ s real estate taxes are estimated to be less than one-fifth of the corporate tax humiliation .
companies in virginia and d.c. pay almost half of their government and local taxes in the form of real estate taxes .
&quot; in maryland , a large proportion of the properties , especially in the area of tax around the d.c. , are either owned by the government or non-profit organizations that do not pay real estate taxes , &quot; said douglas lindholm .
maryland is therefore forced to concentrate much more on income taxes , for example , in order to provide the same services that other states offer .
the recent recovery in tax revenue by businesses cannot be attributed solely to the recovery of the housing market .
corporate revenue also seems to be recovering , according to the data .
companies in the region reported income taxes on government organizations , which were € 2.3 billion in comparison with $ 2.1 billion in 2012 .
maryland took $ 1 billion in corporate income taxes , which was the highest amount in the region .
while the trend is in the same direction , local tax burden on businesses is not increasing at all three locations equally .
the growth rate in the district was equal to 4.3 % in the national average , while the rise in maryland was significantly higher than 4,9 % .
only virginia reported an under-average tax revenue of 4.1 percent .
virginia has achieved a record of 6 % in all three areas of office with significantly lower corporate income taxes ( fixed corporate tax rates in all three areas ) .
the maryland corporate tax rate is 8.25 % and the district is relatively close to the 9,975 % .
a comparable study by the us chamber of commerce earlier this year showed that in virginia , lower government and local corporate taxes are required , and overall , a better tax climate prevails than in maryland .
the study has not investigated the district .
despite its advantages , virginia is under pressure from its southern neighbour .
north carolina has laws to reduce its corporate tax rates this year from 6.9 % to 6 % .
if the government continues to meet its income targets in the coming year , this law could significantly reduce the state ’ s corporate income tax rate by up to 3 % by 2017 .
meanwhile , it seems that small businesses in the washington area are doing better , and they are therefore paying more government and local taxes , as the recent study suggests .
corporate taxes , which are imposed as personal income taxes by small businessmen - a transitional structure that allows most small businesses to operate - are not paid in district , maryland , and virginia last year by 20 % .
researchers say that the trend and the increase in the number of corporate taxes across the country are likely to continue this year , with an increase in the overall tax revenue for the state and the local authorities .
nevertheless , the washington area may be lagging behind if spending cuts in the federal government are limited to the labor market in the region .
partner city : german beer for guangzhou
hops and malt - also a popular combination in china .
german beer enjoys a reputation in china .
frankfurt ’ s partner city in china now wants a brewery and also hopes for a direct air connection between the two cities .
german beer , used in frankfurt &apos;s partner city of guangzhou - that is the urgent wish of the official in china .
&quot; we would be very pleased if a german brewery could set up in our city , &quot; said the vice party secretary of the south china metropolis , li yiwei , in this week &apos;s visit to a spd delegation .
the officials of the regime repeatedly came to the fore in the course of the conversation to this concern of the twelve-million metropolis .
guangzhou , which is also called canton in germany , is one of china &apos;s richest cities , warb li .
therefore , people also had the purchasing power to buy german beer , and the public could afford it .
the hessian spd chairman thorsten schäfer-gümbel , who is leading the german political delegation , said to the host that he would go to germany to see what partner he could possibly have for the project .
&quot; for beer it doesn &apos;t take much : good water , grain and joy of life &quot; , he added at lunch with the party leader , in guangzhou .
this joie de vivre is already exuding mr li , flattering the host .
the council of ministers then met with a large majority of the members of the european parliament , including the president of the european parliament , mr guangzhou , who was serving the food .
the chinese brand tsingtao is based on german brewing art .
tsingtao-beer is produced according to german purity law .
more business
a second wish of china ’ s hosts would be a direct flight between frankfurt and guangzhou , said vice party leader li .
lufthansa had previously offered the flight , but in 2012 , for economic reasons , cancelled it .
&quot; it would be worth again &quot; , the municipal politician showed himself convinced .
&quot; the business relations between our two cities are growing . &quot;
currently , travellers would have to travel via changsha in hunan province , li complained .
the administration of the province of guangdong , its capital guangzhou , also hopes to be able to make the flight .
the vice governor of the province , chen yunxian , presented this wish in his conversation with the social democrats .
&quot; this is a very good idea , &quot; answered schäfer-gümbel - the chinese vice minister li jinjun , an intimate connoisseur of germany , nickte approvingly .
well-maintained partnership
the lieutenant vice party leader of guangzhou hopes that the election of his new president will make frankfurt a meeting of partners next year .
li yiwei was already on the main , but not yet in this function .
he only came into office this year after his predecessor had been arrested for corruption charges .
the local party leader , wan qinglian , also had to go .
the action taken against guangzhou officials is part of a nationwide campaign against corruption in the party and administration , which was launched by leader xi jinping with rigour .
the new leader , li yiwei , had a strong political will to fight for an american company before he became a party leader , which is highly unusual in the chinese communist party .
before taking office in guangzhou , he was the leading functionalist in fujian , where the automobile maker vw had produced a great work .
frankfurt is officially more than a dozen twinning twinning partnerships .
the connection to the 9000 km away guangzhou is one of those that can be maintained by both sides , for example with a student exchange .
last year , 25 years of the german-chinese association was celebrated .
the south china metropolis on the pearl river is almost as strong as anywhere else in hessen , with its economic power .
next year , it wants to create a gross domestic product of eur 250 billion , reports the president of li .
joan rivers family expresses the thumbs &quot; &quot; is &quot; pushing the thumbs &quot; &quot; , &quot; says the thumbs &quot; , &quot; is &quot; pushing the thumbs &quot; is &quot; is &quot; the thumbs &quot; .
joan rivers has been a leading nurse in new york city since she was introduced three days ago ; her daughter was still very hopeful today , that she would have been able to get her own house in new york city .
&quot; thank you for your continued love and support , &quot; said melissa rivers today in a message .
we are all keeping our fingers crossed .
her mother was found springs on thursday after an emergency due to heart stop at a clinic on the upper east side , yorkville endoscopy .
doctors will deliberately sedily keep them sedified and under close observation until they are more satisfied with their condition , which is still described as &quot; serious &quot; .
the reactions came from many quarters , including an overwhelming online support system .
environmentally-friendly vacuum cleaners and rising wages
for cars and vacuum cleaners , which will be available for trading from today , stricter environmental standards will apply in future .
similar to refrigerators and washing machines , new vacuum cleaners will be given a label from 1 september on which the buyer can view central data such as the energy efficiency of the machine at a glance .
new cars are subject to the &apos; euro 6 &apos; pollutant category , with stricter nitrogen oxide levels .
there is also more money for scaffolders : they will receive a nationwide minimum wage of eur 10.25 .
amazon buys twitch for $ 1.04 billion for $ 1.04 billion .
amazon just confirmed what information was on monday morning reported : the online single retailer - and video producer , and a lot of other things - buys the video streaming service twitch for 1.04 billion $ ( $ 1.04 billion ) .
the announcement comes as a surprise , not because no one has expected a twitch takeover , but because it was widely assumed that youtube would acquire the company .
three months ago , it seemed that the sale of twitch to the video service of google was for a cool billion .
twitch , which was launched as a justin.tv just three years ago , was a popular streaming service - a live version of youtube .
instead , it quickly became a platform for players who want to make their bravura pieces released in games , a &quot; youtube for live games &quot; , so an insider .
the twitch interface .
and let &apos;s play , a video genre that shows how to play better .
it is just that youtube is often called , when you want to watch twitch , so it has been changed to the news that youtube twitch wanted to buy something .
it is a mystery why the deal with youtube is not coming .
all we are aware of at the moment is this statement by emmet shear , president of twitch : &quot; we have chosen amateur .
another secret is , frankly , the incredible success of twitch .
for snowboards like me , who explain that they prefer to do sports rather than watch it , it is hard to get to understand the attraction that assumes to help others play instead of themselves the control panel .
it is one thing to tell a friend at 3 o &apos;clock in the morning while they are being torn by resident evil , and something quite different , a spinner .
all these games you could watch right now .
another problem is that many of the most popular games today are ego games , so the ranking can be done without own control over the perspective .
i admit that the rapid transit system in which the roma live is a very important part of our electronic age is not being implemented in record time .
but as long as there is no play-like or humorvirtuous game , his twitch channel is probably not so interesting .
but what do skeptics like me know about it ?
twitch is visited by 55 million different visitors per month and is the fourth largest source of internet traffic peaks .
and how exactly will amazon make money of it ?
it is hard to imagine that twitch is as elegant in amazon instant video as it is in youtube .
but twitch has something that every company would like : thousands of young men who work as advertisers .
as the chairman of twitch , shear , said , amazon and twitch &quot; both believe in the future of gaming , &quot; and the medium shows no signs of a weak economy .
on the hüpfburg at the burggarten festival there was quite a lot of fun on saturday .
the organisers &apos; concept was correct .
despite the strong rain cast on saturday evening , the estimated 3,000 people were killed .
at times , the entry had to be stopped .
&quot; that was annoying , &quot; said ron sem , one of the organizers .
salzwedel l light and fun .
two spanish words have been translated by maxim sachraj and ron sem .
the open air in the salzwedeler burggarten is intended to show brightness during the day and in the evening through various shows .
well , and the fun comes from alone anyway .
this was demonstrated early on saturday when the first visitors came to the open air .
a celebration for all generations had promised the organizers .
and they have succeeded .
around the supply stalls on the burggarten meadow , salzwedeler , but also guests from the nearby and further surroundings had made themselves comfortable .
they followed the first live performances , wippy with the foot in the pulse , enjoyed cool drinks and were able to relax pure and delight .
and the whole thing across the generations .
while some people are looking for blankets on the extra carved white sand at the beach bar , others are lying on a quarter of wine in the vinotheque , they raged around the next day .
but also in the case of child shrinking , the volunteers had a good hand to play .
the larger ones used the kicker tables or took part in a skateboard workshop that the goodfoot-crew had organized from salzwedel .
until the big rain came .
shortly before 5.30 p.m. he was pushing the visitors to the front , especially families were looking for the wide and dry .
but the attractiveness of the festival did not break this .
&quot; more people than expected , &quot; said ron sem , who was driven by a &quot; success all over the line &quot; .
therefore , there is no doubt that next year &apos;s great party will be repeated .
although there is a lot of work to be done on the content and size of the event , sem made a clear statement on sunday in relation to the popular vote .
it was annoying that in the meantime the invitation was stopped .
obviously , the security company was booked with too little effort .
the result is that some who had already paid no longer came to the site .
the response is very good .
in a first careful estimate , the salzwedeler co-organizer spoke of about 1200 visitors who were in the tum garden .
there were problems with sound technology .
the salzwedeler hip-hop band blocks`n`rox broke their appearance therefore unnerved .
the technicians were unable to make a reasonably sound sound .
the planned shisha lounges could not be built because the tents were closed due to a tyre breakdown not to salzedel .
&quot; next year , you will be there , &quot; said the organizer .
the premiere of the amula-open-air was a great success for the visitors .
and that in bad weather .
however , the organisers have made some mistakes , which were delayed the first time , but the second edition eliminates them .
in the social network facebook , the organizers must also include critique .
&quot; sorry , but for twelve euros you simply expected more &quot; , says melanie meier on the event page .
&quot; you have a little taken on , &quot; says ele zimmermann at the same place .
others see the initial problems not quite as narrow .
i think it is very good that some people are not only stupid but also really trying to get something on their feet .
i am not sure if you would be interested in the new version of the game , but i am sure you will find it here .
now the organisers have one year to make these criticisms .
new radom in berkum : wachtberg &apos;s landmark shrinks
this is not as expected .
instead , the part is waiting to be inserted into the distinctive structure .
the action is in the context of a major measure : almost 50 years after the establishment of the space surveillance radar tira , the case , the so-called radom , is completely renewed .
the new radom is equipped with a diameter of 47.5 meters , slightly smaller than the old one .
the size remains world records , however .
the last step to complete the new envelope is the capping exchange .
the upper quarter of the old case is separated and separated with a crane .
after that , the last quarter of the new envelope will be put on .
if the weather is good , the action will start at the beginning of this week .
participant in the ice bucket chat .
isabelle roberts from the uk cried so much when their ice cold water was pushed over their heads that they had to cut the bone structure of their face .
this ice bucket challenge is a painful process of completing it .
a woman was sent to the hospital after she had been diagnosed with ice bucket challenge as a result of her being unable to get to the pine .
isabelle roberts from the uk created so much as their ice-cold water spread over the head .
&quot; the water was so cold that i shouted , and while i did , my kineper simply remained standing , &quot; she said to the mirror .
ice water is protected by the 20-year-old .
isabelle roberts a few seconds before the accident , he was arrested and sentenced to three months in prison .
i wanted to close my mouth , but that did not go , the jaws were hated , and then i understood that something was wrong .
my mother and my sister saw this and they were laughing at laughing almost in their trousers , but i had to go into emergency .
the 20 year old from britain was brought to the hospital to see the jaws after taking part in the viral trend of tuesday .
the clip has been turned into a webse-page and a thousand times into facebook and twitter .
pull the clubs of burgundy back on the same footing ?
finally , there was a constant dispute between the two wolfratshauser burgvereine .
now the boards think about possible cooperation .
as an example for the reconstruction of the wolfratshauser castle , the late richard dimbath , former chief executive of the wolfratshauser burgfreunde , led the project in the french guédelon .
a year ago , there was no good climate between the castle club and the friends of wolfratshausen .
the most varied positions that have been taken up so far have seemed to be how to deal with the history of wolfratshau castle and possible reconstruction .
now the two camps are moving towards one another : talks are to be held soon on a common approach .
the association ’ s boards of directors confirm this by supporting torsten sjöberg ( burgverein ) and herbert piffl ( friends of the castle ) on request from our newspaper .
&quot; i have listened to mr piffl and i have proposed that we could sit down together once , &quot; says sjöberg .
he believes that all members of both clubs could be on the same wavelength in the future .
thus , visible successes can be achieved faster .
while the friends of the castle were worried about the sudden deceased richard dimbath until the last reconstruction of the castle on the mountain forest , the castle club around sjöberg is the &quot; opening and experience &quot; .
herbert piffl , the second chairman of the friends of the burgundy , has been very pleased , according to his own information about the call .
since dimbad ’ s death , he has been standing up to his friends in the castle .
a new chairman is due to be found in a general meeting in mid-september .
currently , the association counts around 40 members according to the 74-year-old .
&quot; after the death of my friend richard dimbath , we have the association &apos;s activities from respect to ruin first &quot; .
according to piffl , the new chairman will then be invited to talk to the burgverein .
until then , the burgundy friends could also have a current mood within their group .
to nominate a candidate for the presidency is not yet available , says piffl .
&quot; but i am confident that someone will find himself &quot; , he does not want to stand for himself because he is resident in bad tölz .
the new chair should be a wolfratshauser .
the tölzer wool is going to be involved in the project &quot; but very happy to continue working &quot; .
the differences of opinion on reconstruction are , in piffls ’ view , likely to remain in the near future .
he commends dimbath as a &quot; missionary &quot; who has always believed in the reconstruction of the castle .
two similar , already advanced projects in austria and france would show that the latter is not a shining mess .
the high participation of the population and voluntary workers from all over the world make them a tourist attraction .
piffl : &quot; i too was sceptical at the beginning .
but over time i am more and more convinced that the european union should be able to support the project &quot; .
there is nothing else here .
moreover , the project would be funded by eu grants , visitor tickets and potential sponsors .
&quot; the idea of reconstruction is something i personally do not want to throw out &quot; , he hopes that the burgverein will perhaps be a little bit moving on this point .
their goal to first document history is &quot; to be important and good &quot; .
then we could go on .
clever ways to save money at uni-textbooks .
since the cost of university textbooks is more than $ 1,000 per year for many students , the fact-two-year fast-semester student , matt schroeder , considered a clever spread .
he invented a loan system for books by students of higher semester and offered a nominal compensation to help them find a way back .
&quot; my mathematics book usually costs $ 180 , but i got it for $ 10 for a semester and a chick fil-a-kek , &quot; said schroeder , 19 , who had the covenant .
the time allocated to the last semester would have saved him $ 430 , he said .
he gave $ 120 out .
the collection management informed with that the student in average 5 hours of the course , and the students were able to get a basic education for the study books and material , but the students had to pay for various cost reduction options .
online stores and creative approaches such as the scroeders are increasingly the solution to the choice for students .
the renting of textbooks is becoming more popular , and students can use a book for a semester , often at a much lower price than when they buy it .
neebo inc , which holds more than 250 university bookstores , participates in the fact that renting textbooks has been slow since 2011 .
surveys in the industry show that around a quarter of books in the college bookstores in the past spring ’ s semester were rented , said neebos vice-president of tevor meyer .
less than half of all textbooks are published by the trade association national association of college stores in campus .
here is the one time for the best deals .
online shopping online
some new books cost online only one third of the price for which they are available in the campus bookshop .
the ninth edition of &quot; calculus &quot; vno ron larwon , bruce edwards and robert hoffetler costs almost 290 $ , but can be ordered at the specialized textbook retailer chegg.com for 23rd .

&quot; calculus &quot; is used on chegg.com for 93.49 $ .
matt casagday , 25 , graduate student at brigham young university , says that the student is on amazon.com 42 cents .
the book was sold for $ 48 .
academics such as ingrid bracey , head of the university of massachusetts at amherst college without any walls. she recommended that students should be present with their professors if they have previously been eligible .
sometimes the updates for the seminar work are not relevant .
in such cases , older expenditure can often be spent for a fraction of the cost of the latest issue .
besides chegg and amazon , half.com is also available from ebay inc as a popular alternative for used books .
renting a car
the renting of textbooks is worth considering if you want to make it reasonably well , remember to return it and you will have to pay the books after the course has been completed .
you can save more than 80 % of the costs of a new book .
a student could , for example , use &quot; calculus &quot; for the duration of a semester for about $ 20 .
find out about the terms of the business when you rent , also about the penalties , the costs of the rental , if applicable , for writing notes , underlining or used packing .
renter note : if you do not return the book , the penalty fees may be the price of a new book .
e-books
also , e-books instead of traditional textbooks are an option .
sometimes these books are rented de facto by using an electronic license for a certain period of time by wholesalers such as amazon.com , chegg and barnes &amp; noble inc. . .
at chegg you can choose &quot; calculus &quot; for 6 months for about 61 $ .
bracey says that students in literary courses often have the best offers , as many classics are downloaded free of charge nowadays , while scientific and engineering teachers are very expensive .
to look around , in any case .
joe gault , 29 , who will soon be the pepperdine law school , recommends that the isbn number for the price determination at bücher , as it is so safe to be the right textbook .
and before ordering online you should check , so gault says , if the book is actually in stock .
this lesson he learned on the hard tour .
he bought a book that delivered four weeks and paid for it the full price in the college building .
why &quot; guardians of the galaxy &quot; no cash raid was made ?
&quot; the expandables 3 &quot; by sylvester stallone played less than 30 million dollars of its 90 million dollars budget in the us , while &quot; sin city : a lady to kill for &quot; was only 12 million dollars .
the ccd camera , tailored to cameron diaz , is a feature film that was released on the opening weekend , with only $ 14.6 million , while children &apos;s films such as &quot; dragon heights easily make 2 &quot; also .
an article of the telegraph movie critic robbie collin suggests that the film was not a success in children &apos;s films .
collin called 2014 the worst year , but so far it has been the worst year for children &apos;s films , and described &quot; dragon heights easily made 2 &quot; as purely &quot; functional &quot; fantasy continuation .
in films for a slightly older target group , however , it seems that the quality of the films does not necessarily pose the problem .
in july , entertainment weekend compared the first half of the average cinemascores and metacritic evaluation for each summer movie start , which took place between the american memorial day and the 20th of july 2013 and the current year .
the results are based on the opinion of the cinema visitors and film critics , and suggest that the film festival will be held this year &apos;s more similar to last year &apos;s .
some commentators believe that development is due to changing visual habits and the growing popularity of web streaming services .
director jon favreau , who is currently working on disney &apos;s upcoming jungle book movie , is saying to the website hull of hollywood reporter : &quot; i think the times are changing . &quot;
we must accept this and not try to follow the past .
unlike the current weak cash outcomes of the hollywood productions , net flix has recently achieved a record turnover of € 39.9 billion with streaming content .
last summer , the director steven spielberg criticized the film studios for not being too focused on film making by comic films .
in the light of the current downturn , some commentators argue that its gloomy prophecy may well be a real core .
the financial crisis that is expected in the summer of 2015 , including avengers , means that the age of ultron , minions , and jurassic world are other representatives of the film industry , however , more optimistic :
the producer of x-men , simon kinberg , described the decline in the cash flow recently as simply &quot; cyclical &quot; and said to hollywood records .
when the second table tennis tournament area was opened a few years ago in order to streamline the league classification , it was a step in the right direction .
now the german table tennis association has an additional 3rd bundesliga .
the result : if you have not climbed , you have gone down .
for example , göttingen &apos;s highest team torpedo has won the top team in the oberliga release but plays in the upcoming season .
the fourth classification of torpedo &apos;s ladies , despite their grandiose margin into the regional league .
the boys and girls of torpedo start at the lower saxony league , as well as the boys of the sc weekend .
sg lenglern and torpedo reserves are in the new compositional league .
the ttv is playing geismar in the association list .
what is the composition of a better district class , is now the new district class .
here tsv seulingen , vfb lödingsen , torpedo iii , geismar , einbeck , hammenstedt , bovender sv , langenholtensen , fc .
in the district sliga , as regional representative dransfeld and the sc weekend play , in the district class of ttc ii , red-white , the bovender sv ii and the teams of the v .
güntersen , the ttc and the ttv geismar ii are here with from the game .
in the district sliga start torpedo iii and sattenhausen / wöllmarshausen .
with nine teams each , the team will be the best in the world with nine teams of all .
the sc weekend sends his girls to the small district sliga .
the district sliga relay relay of the scw boys - torpedo ii is still starting - is not complete .
in a district class , geismar , tuspo weekend and the bovender sv go to the season .
in the first season of the newly established regional association , the two goddesses of göttingen with nine teams start .
in the west season , the red and white ii , bovender sv iii , are laubach ii , torpedo iv and v , mtv grone , dransfelder sc ii , mielenhausen .
in the eastern season , the band includes sattenhausen / wöllmarshausen , nikolausberg and landolfshausen .
the women ’ s circle sliga is made up of sattenhausen / wöllmarshausen ii , bilshausen , hemeln , seulingen ii , tuspo weekend and sg rhume .
that is still better than in the easter circle , where it is not possible to have women teams at the kvp .
what is striking is that none of the six circle classes is set to be set , here the innovative and thrilling circular board will have to start thinking about .

they call for the resignation of the prime minister .
the powerful military had a strong presence in the united states on sunday evening after a meeting in the army headquarters .
it was also stated in the communication that the army is still committed to its role of protecting the security of the state .
the escalating violence has led to concern about military intervention .
the political and economic reforms that the opposition politician imran khan and the preacher tahirul qadri have led last for 14 august since independence day .
sharif rejects a resignation .
khan and qadri had their supporters on sunday called for the reign of ruin .
&quot; we will not go back without sharif being forced to resign , &quot; said khan .
qadri said the same thing .
khan disposes sharif of having lost the parliamentary election in may last year by fraud .
qadri calls for the resignation of central and provincial governments .
then a transitional government is to reform and open up new elections .
more than 40 000 security forces are in operation to protect the government quarter .
the demonstrators had initially been demonstrating peacefully in front of parliament until khan and qadri met them at the weekend to vote .
hütteldorfer after second season victory at the table three .
the 2 : 0 above grödig has a bitter week for rapid on sunday a conciliatory end .
&quot; the victory is very liberating , &quot; said trainer zoran barisic , whose team with the out in the europe league on thursday an intermediate low .
&quot; the success experience was uncanny important &quot; , confirmed the first captain of the team and the goal shooter steffen hofmann , who was in place with green white at the third place .
schrammel-dreamtor brings rapid progress to siegerstraße rapid with the second season victory the right response to the disappointment against helsinki and goes with a successful result experience .
&quot; we wanted to show a positive response , &quot; said foreign minister thomas schrammel , who , with his splendid leadership volley of the sixteenth century , was the soft spot for victory .
&quot; i thought i was going to have all the frustration of thursday in my hands and i was snoring him under the bar , &quot; said the 26-year-old smiling .
as a shrink on the 13th novmember 2010 for the last time in a bundesliga match , the race was still scheduled for ried .
the first championship hit in the rapid dress will therefore be given to him in special memory .
&quot; for me this is something special , i am from the rapid after-growth &quot; , said schrammmel .
due to the short term besser of mario pavelic , schrammel moved from the left to the right defensive side and made even there his cause very well .
he has enough experience to maintain this position .
the gate he has earned , he has already had some assists this year , &quot; praised barisic .
team shows character schrammel also delivered the flank to 2 : 0 by hofmann after just over an hour , which finally brought the decision .
for before that , the guests could have written as well .
&quot; thank god we have been lucky today , &quot; also noted schrammel , who has thus responded to the clinging of performance and result in recent weeks .
barisic was even in the mood that &quot; in many games you had been better before today &quot; - against &quot; the strongest team that was in this season at this stadium &quot; .
the first three-point since 26 july has therefore proved that the team fabric is the setback for the long time being intact : &quot; today my team has shown that it is character . &quot;
for him no less pleasing : &quot; that we finally have to play back to zero &quot; .
a lot of work during the national pause also the fact that with brian behrendt , mario pavelic , christopher dibon , deni alar and michael schimpelsberger several emails .
&quot; we must not forget that , &quot; barisic warned , who has been in contact with behrendt and pavelic players for the last three days , &quot; who recently had very stable players . &quot;
the national pause must therefore be used to ensure &quot; wounds to lick and to stay healthy in the physical world &quot; .
one to which the break is probably particularly appropriate is captain hofmann .
it is tearing itself apart for the team , it goes beyond pain .
it is precisely at this difficult stage that he has shown that he is a very important player for us , &quot; according to barisic .
hofmann gave the game rapids before his exchange-over in the 68th minute not only the structure but also achieved the second goal .
for the 33-year-old who has his 350th bundesliga game , it was the first hit from the game since 2nd november 2013 ( 4 : 2 above the admira ) .
hofmann : &quot; must not believe that everything is good now &quot; &quot; we certainly also have a bit of luck , but eventually the luck must also return to us .
it was high time , &quot; said hofmann .
he warned that concentrated power would be needed : &quot; you cannot leave it to the black and white .
we have not seen such a bad performance in recent weeks as has been shown .
we must not , however , believe that everything is good now .
the importance of his role for the team was undeniable .
it is a very young team , to whom i am very able to help at the moment .
they are in some stages , after all , sticking to me , &quot; said hofmann .
val gardena coach michael baur had little to reproach himself and his team .
he regretted the rapid opposite reaction from the speller category , as well as the regular door of nutz in the 40th minute , which was collected by referee unjustly unrecognized .
the only accusation i can make to the team is that we are heading for tor in some stages not sufficiently concrete .
we have too few accounts .
internal defenders maximilian karner saw it in a similar way : &quot; it just started badly , but then we found it in plain and even made a gate .
by and large , it would have been more in it .
under this arrow , ruh reigns , ruh , and ruh , the wind is in the air .
a powerful tribe was shown at our enigmatic task of the summer series &quot; my piece of the rhöner luck &quot; last friday .
several of these giant trees are still in the district , the illustrated copy is the &quot; geisruheiche &quot; above the lower white giant fountain .
a rough footpath leads up to the approximately 600 year-old oak tree .
pass the bridge and take basalt stone bridge and turn right into the basalt stone .
a small piece below the quarry of the bauersberg , one kilometre north of the road to weisbach , there stands it .
vital sees the natural monument , it rises above the other trees of the area and reminds with a volume of over eight meters of an american mammoth tree .
a small buddha on a tree stump indicates that there are many different spiritual and spiritual ways to live .
but , despite intensive research , there were only references to the name origin .
dr. wolfgang schneider has created the bischofsheim archive and has invited older people from the underwhite brunn to know what is in it with the spiritual scourge .
the result of his research remained the rather sober explanation for the name .
so , up to 80 years ago , goat shepherds were supposed to be able to feed their animals from underwhite brunn to the laboriously grubbed and freed of stones .
at the foot of the tree , the climb heightened keepers should have restled .
the area has now regained its importance , because there are actually goat herds on the meadows .
the area is also part of the core zone of the biosphere reserve , has been further developed by schneider .
when entering the stone collections , you should be careful not to use the stone as the sun &apos;s warmed up basalt is a very good place for crusaders .
a hiking trail leads from unterweißenbrunn to the tree , which is a bit hidden .
other routes are signposted , the direction hochrhön climb up and to an extensive hike invite .
where is the watercastle ?
a watercastle that will be sought for our next task is , however , rather rare in height .
the mirror in the moat already gives a good impression of the building , but we have some historical buildings in the county , including the building counter-fei could fit .
where is our &quot; piece of rhöner luck &quot; located ?

after weeks of tug-of-war , italy ’ s premier and eu president , matteo renzi , has resisted strong conservative opposition at the eu special summit last week .
renzi considers how to use the daily la repubblica , which is close to government , to proclaim its name also in the governing team as a favorite .
he also expects an impetus from this for his &apos; reform package &apos; in italy .
last but not least , renzi hopes that the anti-him / her party ’ s constant opposition will be able to put a stop to this , because mogherini will not accept this , albeit more moderate , form .
i have a strong case against conservative representatives with commission president jean-claude juncker and the polish president , donald tusk , who was nominated as president of the council , in order to achieve political compensation .
because the chief diplomat of the eu will also be deputy to president juncker .
the agreement by the european parliament , which is still pending , is considered to be safe .
otherwise , president giorgio napolitano would have rejected the nomination of the 41year-old politician in the ruling democratic party ( pd ) , &quot; no great recognition &quot; of italy &apos;s role in the eu .
la repubblica spreads optimism that the reforms that have been carried out in leading party posts for almost two decades and which have been well known for their ambition are going to meet the &apos; enormous challenges &apos; .
the roman catholic church is married and has a two-year-old daughter .
her party career began with a doctorate in political science from 1996 .
in 1999 , mogherini was appointed vice-president of the european community organisation of society for three years .
with the election in 2001 to the party council of left-wing democrats , it became involved in party politics , worked in the foreign policy department , whose leader was soon to become .
she occupied traditional focus of italian foreign policy , such as the middle east , was replaced by studies on nato ’ s deployment in afghanistan , in which italy is involved with a contingent of troops , maintained contacts with the european social democrats and the european democrats .
since 2008 she has been a member of the chamber of deputies , where she is an expert on defence and european and international affairs .
when renzi was premiered in february 2014 , he called mogherini to his foreign minister , and he was a member of the government .
if the pd is to have a better relationship with the strong peace movement in the country today , which is one of the more than 40 % of the party ’ s vote in the eu elections in may , then , as noted in pd circles , i have been .
i am not in favour of the accusations in brussels that the new eu external envoy has too little diplomatic experience , so the pd is failing .
in brussels , the european union is taking action , particularly by poland and the baltic members , in a mistrust of realistic accents by mogherini on the crisis in ukraine , and is being dismissed as a &apos; pro-russia course &apos; .
it supports the russian company gazprom &apos;s pipeline , south stream , which is currently under discussion by russian gas , bypassing the ukraine .
after renzi took office as eu president in july , the eu was travelling to moscow to visit the country for her first state visit .
photos you have taken with putin at shake hands are now being taken in brussels with outrage , as well as the fact that you have not received the kremlin chief for october for a milan economic summit .

the socialists in france should &apos; keep their mouths and put france in order &apos; said the main ally of francois hollande .
mr valls called for the deeply divided left to take a stand on their love for the revolt socialist party president .
the president deserves everyone &apos;s respect , he deserves our loyalty , he deserves our support .
&quot; it is our duty to stay with him , &quot; he said with great applause .
as a appealing gesture , the prime minister insisted that his government should not accept the controversial 35-hour week in france despite strong calls for a relaxation of the scheme by emmanuel macron , the new economic minister .
on saturday , mr hollande urged his fellow socialists to &apos; unite &apos; with the government .
but christiane taubira , the minister for justice , strayed sand into the corridor , in which she was abducted at a meeting of dissent socialist members and the socialist group in the european parliament criticized her for not being present .
marine le pen , the far right leader of the national front , ridiculed the constant rigging of socialists and said that the government was not prepared to accept that the new un valves government would last longer than a few months .
francois hollande is the emperor without clothes , but prince manuel valls has no , they are forced to build a new government , if the old one does not even survive a summer .
&quot; and the new will also fall or winter will not survive , &quot; said fräulein le pen towards supporters .
she repeated her party &apos;s call for a dissolution of parliament and said she was confident that , in early elections , it would be the winner , and that she would be ready for government .
the french ruling party has suffered a defeat in the local elections .
a survey in the sunday newspaper journal du dimanche revealed that 76 percent of french people were in the opinion that the number of socialist parties to the threat of a vote against the constitution was high .
pascal perrineau , a political scientist at the sciences po university , warned that the french would quickly lose the patience to do so .
&quot; there is a small window for possibilities , but public opinion must feel quickly that things are changing , &quot; warned .
otherwise , the situation could deteriorate further .

pro-hong kong activists condemn china on the day after the election .
a peking-loyal group swung close to the chinese flag .
the standing committee of the national people &apos;s congress adopted a framework law on sunday , which only two or three candidates for the hong kong leadership election in 2017 .
all candidates must first receive majority support from a nomination committee .
this decision will make it easier for opposition democrats to vote for election .
political reforms have long been a controversial issue in hong kong ; and the party leadership of china fears that the chinese government will not accept the call for democracy .
after the publication of a beijing white paper , which called for the supremacy of china over hong kong in june , democracies held a clear , unofficial referendum .
lis survey is conducted by the government in hong kong and the chinese liaison office in hong kong .
the deputy chairman of the standing committee on legal affairs , zhang rongshun , and the vice-president of the hong kong and macao affairs office of the state council , feng wei , should be asked during the day .

putin demands kiev to accept &quot; statehood talks &quot; with the ostúkraine .
russian president vladimir putin demanded russian media reports that on sunday , the russian authorities would not allow the fighting to be won by the separatists in the east of the country and start negotiations on the &apos; statehood &apos; of the russian federation .
his spokesman , dimitri peskov , later made it clear that putin did not mean that the system would be under the control of the separatists .
putin ’ s call for kiev ’ s government to negotiate on an equal footing with pro-russian insurgents , however , fits in with the policy that he has apparently pursued since the riots began five months ago : to help the separatist areas .
in an interview with the state television channel eins , putin condemned the ukrainian military campaign to reconquer the separatist forces .
the kremlin and separatists have recently rejected the territory taken as a &apos; new state &apos; .
putin pointed out that all those who had been killed in the campaigns ukrainian politicians are now in a state of emergency for the 26 october elections , and while government groups are building civilian communities in the areas held by separatists .
&quot; we must start a detailed discussion immediately , not only on technical issues , but also on the political organisation of society and state status of south-eastern ukraine , in order to protect the interests of the people living there , &quot; he said .
peskov said that putin ’ s reference to the statehood in the context of greater autonomy was to be seen , which has been supported for months by kiev ’ s leadership , to avoid fears in russian-speaking areas .
only the ukrainian government can provide the eastern territories with the necessary autonomy , as peskov said .
this is not about negotiations between ukraine and russia , peskov said , &apos; because it is not a conflict between russia and ukraine &apos; , but about a internal conflict in the ukraine . &apos;
clarifying the kremlin speaker to correct the &quot; misinterpretation &quot; of the &quot; putins &quot; of putin &apos;s remarks highlighted the russian leadership requirement in dealing with separatist rebellion in the east , unlike the direct anger .
moscow could have far greater difficulties in getting the donetsk and luhansk regions to the eastern ukraine .
the autonomy enjoyed by russian diplomats at international forums is a matter of concern to regional governments in ukraine .
the agreement , annexed five months ago in the black sea , is the home port for the majority of russian marines and a major trading port and historic coastal region .
the regions between the rostov region in russia and the crimea are also rich in mines , factories and foundries that are important components for the russian military .
the ukrainian president , petro poroshenko , suggested in his speech on june 7 that the ukrainian government should , after new elections , approve additions to the constitution .
but his idea of autonomy seems to be in sharp contrast to that of the kremlin and the separatist rebels , whose armament and inciting violence are moscow &apos;s predecessor .
putin ’ s last call to kiev to negotiate with separatist leaders on an equal footing followed the us military ’ s further invasion of iraq .
the separatists supported by russia took over in the fury of the grip that , according to fears of ukrainian security officials , was the first step in a campaign to take over the coastal region until crimea , control of novoazov .
for this reason , massive civilian and military preparations have begun to prevent mariupol , a stalemate industry , from being forced into the hands of the population of 500 000 .
poroshenko spoke on saturday at a meeting of eu leaders in brussels and urged action to prevent another russian aggression against the ukraine .
&quot; we are on the verge of a point where there is no going back , &quot; warned poroshenko .
thousands of foreign troops and hundreds of foreign tanks are now on the territory of ukraine .
the eu summit did not take any specific action to call for the leadership to draft further sanctions against russia , which would be justified in an unspecified escalation of the ukrainian crisis .
ukrainian soldiers had to move away from their positions in ilowajsk after two russian tank colonies and 1,000 soldiers were killed in the donetsk region last week .
the first probably 63 ukrainian soldiers who were killed by the russian invasion of ilowajsk were arrested on sunday against 10 russian casualties .
nude photo scandal around australian celebrities and gabi grecko grecko .
geoffrey geoffrey made no secret of his anger at hackers , who probably had naked images of his promised gabi grecko and a who is who of the a-celebrities from hollywood .
the film city is in excitement after a series of unique photos of a naked jennifer lawrence in a hackingsscandal to celebrate celebrities on the internet .
the hacker responsible for this probably has 60 nude photos of lawrence , star from &quot; the tribble of panem &quot; and superstar &apos;s , including the models kate upton and cara detroit .
the australian actress teresa palmer , emily browning , yvonne strahovski , and grecko from melbourne allegedly also took private photos on the basis of an icloud gap .
there are 101 celebrities on the list .
the most noble of the last month with grecko said to confidential : &quot; it &apos;s reluctant . &quot;
all private letters and pictures should remain private .
it is a disgrace that private information is stolen and passed on to others .
grecko , currently in new york , reported a news story website that the internet hack &quot; schänderlich &quot; was shameful and that the people affected felt &quot; wounded . &quot;
the hacker probably has 30 images of palmer with her ex-friend scott speedman , including two images in which they appear above without a pool .
the film works of palmer include &quot; love is invincible &quot; with liam hemsworth .
palmer , chuck star strahovski and actress browning from sucker punch were available yesterday for comments on the hacked images .
a lawrence representative said to tmz : &quot; it is a disgusting violation of privacy .
actors seth rogen condemned the hacker in his tweet : &quot; hacked images from a handy to posting is nothing different from the sale of hacker goods . &quot;
from a purely legal point of view , the proliferation of stolen images should not be tolerated .
cyclists , joggers and hikers were on the big field mountain yesterday and they were able to reach the &quot; hilfe für krebskranke children &quot; association .
the tour , which is a tortur for some , was a light training for others .
however , everyone agreed on one thing : it was fun .
thomas studanski will have slept well last night .
for the first time in his life , the chief of the oberurseler brewery was driven yesterday by a bike on the feldberg .
for the good purpose .
the small muscle catheter can easily be removed , especially as the participation in the 8th cycling on the large feldberg is a matter of concern to him for the benefit of the association &quot; help for cancer children &quot; ( frankfurt ) .
a great thing .
&quot; i know now that i can do that - great ! &quot;
small pedal on the way in the apple curve ?
nee , if i had stopped , would be out of ...
as thomas studanski , who was responsible for the cdu in the oberurseler city parliament , many of the 718 participants died yesterday in the spring and came to the rescue .
others , by contrast , found it easier to cross the 11 km long distance between hohemark and feldberg .
norman dießner , for example .
the red color of the green politician from the kreistag - red dress , red bike - made a big difference at the start on understatement ( &quot; every lot of professionals , since is annayed the goal !
he is also the track in a slide , as well as nina kuhn , pressesprecher of the city of oberursel , who joined frank grünisen on the way .
for the two triathletes , the &quot; feldberg cycling &quot; was not necessarily a sporting challenge : &quot; this is about charity , since there we are happy to participate - a trip would have been easier today anyway .
on the way , they had met paul wenzel from oberreifenberg .
the boy ( 12 ) was in the morning down to oberursel to return to the height straight away .
the frankfurt florian zierz had to leave at 9 a.m. in the sattel in the morning , &quot; made &quot; the field mountain two times , to be able to look home with fun .
the fun was also &quot; fritten-toni &quot; .
for the head of the oberurseler kultkiosk , cycling tours through the feldberg are simply part of the package .
he had a very good start with his 6.5-kilometre racing bike .
a crazy event .
for this purpose - and i am happy to do so - andreas balzke said .
the durchtrainerte mainzer says of itself that he is an &quot; ambitious racing cyclist &quot; .
he must be , because he was very familiar with the &quot; fixing wheel &quot; , which is also racing wheels , but without switching ...
the fact that it can be easily moved up without a wheel proved not only the 20 hikers who cross the white wall and the foothold to the summit , but also a jogging path that leads to a cork .
bergwatchtschutz professor volker lischke , who is working with his team , equipped with allrad-bully and quad , for safety , said : &quot; the kenn &quot; i from frankfurt , who knows .
the 718 participants - and thus as many as ever - were divided into groups in the morning .
the hikers first at 9.30 a.m.
the first cyclists and runners followed at 10 o &apos;clock .
five minutes later , the first mountain bikers set off .
bent hansen , chairman of the association &quot; cycling on the great feldberg &quot; , gave the start-up commands and wanted to give the participants a nice trip .
i hope that next year he will succeed in getting the track down to feldberg to ensure participants are safe .
