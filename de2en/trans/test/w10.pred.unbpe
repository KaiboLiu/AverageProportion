remembering the very american ideal of labour rights as human rights
congressmen keith ellison and john lewis have tabled a legislative proposal to make trade unions as citizens &apos; rights .
&quot; as unions die , so do the middle class jobs , &quot; said ellison , a democrat from minnesota and deputy chairman of the progressive conservative caucaus in congress .
i therefore take pride in the fact that john lewis , together with the civil right sicon , has introduced the staff authorisation act .
this groundbreaking law gives workers the same legal opportunities for discrimination on the grounds of trade union organisation as in other forms of discrimination - and thus stops anti-union workers .
the addition of the national labour law to provide for the organisation of trade union representation of workers who are exposed to discrimination , in order to appeal for justice before a civil court - and to obtain compensation or criminal penalties - is to be made .
but it is certainly not a radical initiative - at least not according to american standards .
indeed , the best way to understand what ellison , lewis , and other sponsors of their bill propose is to link back to a very american idea .
despite the setbacks that trade unions have been exposed to in recent years - in wisconsin , michigan and other countries throughout the country - americans have once encouraged countries around the world to recognise labour rights and to recognise them .
there was a time when millions of americans still remember when this country was a country that had democracy , freedom of speech , freedom of the press and the right of association in one breath .
when the united states occupied japan after world war ii , general douglas mac arthur and his staff encouraged the country to adopt a constitution that would ensure that the militarised autocracy was heir to japan .
fully aware that workers and their trade unions are playing a role in creating a new japan , they used a language that was explicitly recognized that &quot; the rights of workers on unification and common understanding &quot; and act .
when the united states occupied germany after world war ii , general dwight david eisenhower and his staff urged the germans to write a constitution that would ensure that fascism adolf hitler replaced a democracy .
recognizing that workers would have to organize themselves , and raising their voice in the new nation , the germans added a clause that explicitly stated that they would &quot; do not have the right to form associations .
agreements that restrict or aim to restrict this right are zero and null ; to which the objective is to be illegal .
when the former first lady eleanor roosevelt presided over the international commission on human rights , which included the universal declaration of human rights as it was adopted by the united nations in 1948 as a global agreement .
for generations , americans have accepted the basic premise that labour rights are human rights .
when that country told other countries how to form civil and democratic societies , americans said that the right to establish trade unions - and to do so - was a fundamental right for the union to participate in collective negotiations .
after these rights were under attack in america , it is indeed wise to reconsider the american ideal that labor ’ s workers should have the right to choose .
as pastor martin luther king jr. said fifty years ago :
history is a great teacher .
now everyone knows that the workers &apos; movement did not restrict the strength of the nation , but increased it .
by raising the standard of living of millions of people , work has miraculously created a market for industry and has pushed the entire nation to unimaginable levels of production .
those who attack the work forget these simple truths , but history keeps them .
history remembers , and we should do so .
the formal recognition of labour rights as human rights - and the extension of the protection of civil rights as a protection against discrimination in the creation of employee representatives - is long overdue .
keith ellison and john lewis renew the ideals that america has made big in the past and that have fulfilled the promise of democracy .
judges temporarily stop law that all abortion clinics in louisiana could force them to close down .
a us federal judge stopped transposing a law in louisiana on sunday , from which lawyers say that it is likely to close all five abortion clinics in the state .
this measure , which was taken by bobby jindal , governor of louisiana , in june and which came into force on 1 september , would be to allow doctors who carry out abortions to do so .
the judge &apos;s decision , however , means that doctors will continue to be able to carry out legal abortions for the time being , while requesting such a right .
&quot; the plaintiffs can continue to work in accordance with the law while they strive to obtain these rights , &quot; says federal judge john degravelles in his judgment .
a hearing is scheduled for the judge within a month to ensure a more lasting decision on the law .
pro-abortion welcomed the decision to remove the latest in a series of judgments against similar measures and said that doctors had more time to pay hospital supplies .
&quot; today &apos;s decision means that women in louisiana are escaping a disgraceful law that wants to take their health and their rights away from them , &quot; said nancy northup , president and chair of the centre for reproductive rights five .
it was not immediately clear whether the judgment would also affect doctors from the two clinics that the complaint had not been followed and also had the right to issue an application .
louisiana is one of 11 countries that have passed similar laws , with courts recently taking such measures in alabama and mississippi for non-constitutional .
key points of a law in texas that affects most of the clinics left in the state have been closed down by a federal judge on friday .
pro-abortion and the american college of ostretricians and gynecologists , as well as the american medical association , agree that the inclusion of authorisation rights by doctors is unnecessary .
anti-abortion opponents are against the idea that the measures are designed to protect women &apos;s health , although some also welcomed the effects of clinics closing down .
only a doctor who has aborted louisiana has patients infiltrated , divided the centre for reproductive rights with him .
if all other doctors in the state are forced to stop carrying out abortions , that doctor would not carry out the operation for his safety , the group said .
in their arguments against the judgment , representatives of the state louisiana said that they did not have to punish doctors for carrying out abortions , while their applications for patients &apos; rights were still pending .
delayed diagnosis and lack of access to the best treatment will lead to higher death rates from eggs in rural areas .
angelina jolie and her brother james have received a video homage for their mother online , which was awarded a certificate of honor in 2007 .
women in rural australia face a greater risk of falling into ovarian cancer than they do for women in cities .
researchers analyzed the medical data of more than 1100 australians , who detected ovarian cancer in 2005 , and found that only 25 % were left on the scene five years after the diagnosis .
the research director susan jordan of the qimr berghofer medical research institute said that for those living in rural and remote regions of the state , the mortality risk during the study was reduced by 20 % .
small study : new medicines could cause lung and eggs cancer to slow down .
researchers examined the medical care of women over seven years .
dr. jordan said that a woman &apos;s age in diagnosis , the type of ovarian cancer , existing predisorders , and social and economic status also influenced the chances of survival .
for older women and those whose cancer is already advanced at the time of diagnosis , the survival rate was the lowest .
for those who live in rural and remote regions of the state , the mortality risk was 20 % higher than for those in urban areas .
although the study did not investigate why women living outside the city are more likely to have died of ovarian cancer , dr. jordan suspects a belated diagnosis and lack of access to the best treatment centers .
&quot; this disease is best treated by gynaecological oncologists , and most of these are found in larger cities , &quot; she said .
despite the improvement of telehealth services in order to counter distances , it proposed , as a possible remedy , a strengthening of the service of infected doctors , in order to give specialists the opportunity to bring women closer to home and to home .
dr. jordan said that , regardless of geography , the study has a poor long-term survival rate for women in ovarian cancer , and underscored the need for better treatment and prevention strategies .
the strategy of rio tinto ride to conquer cancer is now being published in the medical journal of australia .
in march 2013 elisha neave , a young mother of 33 years from the gold coast , learned that she had an aggressive form of ovarian cancer .
garden centers regret falling house owners
the decline , combined with an increase in the number of homeowners under 35 years of age , could lead to the loss of tens of thousands of pounds per year when today ’ s young consumers are forced to buy a new home after a study by the hta , as described in the financial &quot; .
the report states that tenants spend an average of 55 percent of the amount paid by people with homes for their garden .
the rise in people living in highly urbanized areas without gardens , the popular procedure of using subgardens for parking purposes , and the falling rate of garden are further factors that must be taken into account in the industry .
in the greater london area , which has had a 6 year share of homeowners increased from 61 % to 43 % , the lowest expenditure on garden products per household will be reported .
the hta and the royal horticultural society point out that housing is for rent or small gardens does not mean that people do not have plants .
guy barter , chief garden consultant for the rhs said : &quot; container gardeners are very popular with tenants , for example , because they can take their plants with them in a move . &quot;
the hta report identified the period between 1997 and 2005 as the &quot; golden age &quot; of horticulture retail due to rising house ownership and economic prosperity from the late 1980s to the mid-1990s .
he also predicted an improved market situation this year due to better weather conditions after unfavourable weather conditions in march and april of last year .
the political and economic crisis that the opposition politician imran khan and the spiritual tahirul qadri have led continues .
in the capital islamabad , some 1000 demonstrators have stormed the state television station ptv .
information minister pervaiz rashid said that soldiers had taken the protesters out of ptv buildings again .
the station set up its operation for about 40 minutes but is now sending it back .
at the same time , some 3,000 demonstrators tried to become prime minister nawaz sharif &apos;s residence .
about a kilometre away they were equipped with sticks and stones clashes with security forces .
the police used terängas. the police used teargas .
the demonstrators demanded sharif ’ s resignation , but he rejected it .
the country ’ s army is meanwhile calling for a political solution to the conflict to be &apos; wasted without time and without using force &apos; .
after a meeting at the headquarters on sunday evening , the military told us : &quot; the army remains committed to maintaining the security of the state &quot; .
the military plays an important role in pakistan and has already been put on more frequent occasions .
opposition politician imran khan accuses prime minister sharif of being a member of the parliament &apos;s election last may .
the protests escalated at the weekend , after khan and qadri had called their followers to come to sharif ’ s residence .
three people were killed .
turkey is appointing us diplomat for espionage reports
the turkish foreign ministry has awarded the country ’ s longest-serving us diplomats a report on american and british espionage in turkey .
vice-president bülent said that the us embassy ’ s business operator and turkish officials had discussed the report on monday .
the german magazine der spiegel and the online magazine the intercept reported that the results of the research carried out by the former us analyst of the national security agency , edward snowden , show that turkey is a key area of activity .
according to turkish news agencies , turkish president recep tayyip erdogan has played a key role in the report and said that all the major countries are playing on each other .
an earlier report that germany ’ s most important intelligence service , ankara , was also targeted , produced much more angry reactions by the turkish government .
warning strike : train drivers are threatened with consequences for commuters
the nationwide warning strike of train drivers on monday evening could also stop passenger traffic in nrw .
the expiry date announced for 18 to 21 hours affects all carriers throughout the country , including the rail , regional and s-bahn transport .

said the district chair of the trade union german locomotive leader ( gdl ) , sven schmitte , in düsseldorf .
we expect to see significant shortfalls .
regional priorities are not there .
the main thrust of the warning strike is freight traffic .
deutsche bahn in nrw announced that it will do everything possible to minimise the impact .
however , the gdl did not say where it wanted to strike , so it was difficult to predict the consequences in concrete terms .
police chief of magaluf accused of corruption
the prosecutors sent a letter to the office of the public prosecutor of mallorca on friday to prove that the police and staff of the city of calvià were blackmail .
the head of the police of calvià on the island of mallorca was arrested after accusations of corruption by businessmen and bar-owners in the notorious binge-drinking-hotspot magaluf .
main commissioner josé antonio navarro was arrested by several businessmen in punta ballena , the street , following corruption charges against him , where most bars and nightclubs of magaluf are located .
according to the online newspaper mallorca diario , the prosecutors gave the office of the prosecutor for the fight against corruption in mallorca evidence of blackmail by police and employees of the city of calvià on friday .
two other local police officers were arrested by the spanish civil guard in connection with the corruption charges .
the spanish national daily abc reported that the angry night club owners said that the vetternity of the authorities had serious consequences for their business .
&quot; it is no longer about making money , it is about survival , &quot; said one of the businessmen to the court .
let our livelihood be lost .
we have nothing to lose .
magaluf made a huge difference this summer due to a viral youtube video , which featured an 18-year-old british tourist who was on 24 men during a snap tour .
the island authorities have since tried to prevent the illegal behaviour of alcoholic holidaymakers in magaluf by reducing the number of participants in the notorious drinks .
the playhouse club , where the fellatio incident took place , was forced to close for one year , while playhouse and the kneipentour-organiser carnage together paid a penalty of € 55,000 .
magaluf , a tourist resort that attracts young british tourists , is also popular for many accidents involving alcohol .
the first spring day with wet and stormy weather conditions affects flights from adelaide airport .
the spring has brought a winter surprise to southern australia , with strong showers and strong wind , which makes flights from the airport adelaide harder .
in the evening until 9 p.m. another 5mm rain fell on the city , after 6.6mm , which had already fallen in the night for sunday .
the last rainfall was the result of a series of short , stormy showers , including a cast-iron that began shortly before 20 o &apos;clock and caused almost 4mm of precipitation in about 10 minutes .
after last week ’ s winter has provided an early spring dose , temperatures in the city fell again on monday to a high of only 15.8 ° c .
the bad weather conditions have probably led to the delayed landing of a flight by virgin airlines from melbourne to adelaide .
the plane should have landed shortly after 7.30 p.m. , but was hit by a jagged wind - a sudden change in the wind speed or direction over a short distance - and had to get through .
at that time , windsurfers reached about 50 km / h at the ground at adelaide airport .
the flight data showed that the aircraft could also take off on a second landing flight and finally came up at about 8.40 p.m.
the flight delay has led to delays in some other flights , including an emirates flight from dubai and a quantas flight from sydney .
for adelaide , a maximum temperature of 16 ° c is predicted on tuesday , with possible showers .
matthias says : it is high time to network large numbers of people .
given the glaring technical progress that has made our cosy home in high-tech switchgear stations , the new technology is becoming more and more exciting .
while i write this here , my view of the spiral cable that connects the listener to the phone , and i think : boah , how retro is that ?
but there is a thought behind this : if the cable were not , all listeners would be able to fly around in the house without a hitch , and that would be much more retro .
the fact is that the eclectic ( eclectic ?
no , typos : electronic sector the rule that the world novelty today is the electric scrap of tomorrow , bought - outdated .
and if you still have a tv set in the living room today , you simply say that you are opposed to television .
why these considerations ?
because the pressure from the ifa at the radio tower has once again brought us our absolute incompetence in electronic matters this week .
the layman , who used to be a washing machine and cd player , blindly does not even understand the purpose of the devices that are being used with incomprehensible expert presses : &quot; connect &quot; .
yes , is it still possible ?
what should we talk about with people who apparently voluntarily spread such quark ?
in fact , for some 20 years now , the main thing is that we should like to network our house .
to make the yoghurt order itself , the fire alarm on holiday in the maldives tells us that it is burning in the working room .
and would it not be wonderful if we could have air conditioning on our arrival in the near future ?
yes , but this requires air conditioning .
but a dream will certainly come true soon : we lift our watch , say your voice !
wrong .
everything amounts to nothing less than a revolution : &apos; the boundaries between white and brown goods are blurred &apos; , a connoisseur of the industry , you can use a washing machine to connect the headphones with a headphones that are connected .
we also know from daily practice that if a new fashionable device is really needed , the battery is guaranteed to be empty .
another reason is that the spiral cable on the phone will survive the next radio exhibitions .
israeli children return to their schools after the war in gaza .
thousands of israeli children from the areas near gaza returned to israel on monday .
the launch of the school brought the missile launcher communities in the south of israel a sense of joy and expectation , but the signs of fighting are still fresh .
in the southern city of ashdod , employees of the &quot; pashosh &quot; kindergarten , who was hit by a rocket , before the students arrived granate shards from the walls and shoot .
&quot; we are a bit afraid , but are excited , &quot; said ronit bart , resident in kibbutz saad and there english teacher .
many children from our area urgently need a return to a routine .
her 11-year-old daughter shani bart said it felt &quot; a bit funny &quot; , suddenly back into school .
&quot; these were difficult times , and we did not leave the house at all , &quot; she said .
president reuven rivlin visited the kibbutz near the border with gaza to offer his support .
until a ceasefire stopped last week ’ s war , thousands of residents of border communities such as saad left their homes or homes to live in safer areas further away from gaza and escape the missile .
many inhabitants of nahal oz , a municipality near the border with gaza , where a four-year-old boy was killed by a palestinian murderous grenade , are still reluctant to return .
the ministry of education announced that a dozen or so families had not yet returned .
their children have been temporarily accommodated in other schools .
prime minister binyamin netanyahu attended a school in sderot , a border town with gaza , which is heavily hit by the palestinian fire .
he called on the children to learn a lot and said &apos; we will ensure that their knowledge is acquired and provide you with security &apos; .
israel and hamas agreed last tuesday on an open-ended ceasefire .
the ceasefire brought about an immediate end to the fighting , but important issues remain unresolved , as hamas ’ call for the lifting of the israeli-egyptian blockade of gaza and the reopening of the aehza .
israel is calling for the disarmament of hamas and for the transfer of the bodies of two israeli soldiers killed in the fighting .
a new round of indirect talks is expected to begin in egypt later this month .
in the war , more than 2,100 palestinians were killed , three-quarters of them civilians , and at least 494 children were killed according to estimates by the palestinians and the un .
israel denies this information and estimates that at least half of the killed are fighters , but did not provide any concrete evidence of this information .
on the israeli side , 66 soldiers and six civilians , including a thai worker , were killed .
hamas and other gaza fighters fired 4,591 missiles and mortar shells during the fighting on israeli cities , most of them in the south .
meanwhile , the israeli military carried out more than 5,000 air and other attacks .
the israeli attacks damaged or destroyed thousands of homes in the gaza area and some 250,000 people were seeking refuge in more than 100 un schools that had been converted into temporary shelters .
while tens of thousands of people continue to live in the shelters and the fighting continues , the education authorities postponed the beginning of the school year last week .
&quot; i hope the school is reopened soon so that we can continue to learn , just as the children in the world and the jewish children , &quot; said mohammad amara , a 13-year-old boy who is currently in a city .
at the choice in saxony : cdu-vize strobl questions npd prohibition procedures .
given the npd ’ s loss in saxony , cdu-bundesvize thomas strobl has decided to end the current npd prohibition proceedings before the federal constitutional court .
berlin - according to cdu-bundesvize thomas strobl , the ongoing prohibition proceedings against the npd should be brought to an end before the federal constitutional court .
&quot; the npd is doing worse than last time , &quot; said strobl , who is also cdu head of state in baden-württemberg , the &quot; leipziger volkszeitung &quot; .
this is a welcome development in the right direction and a development which will allow me to conclude that the npd is being fought politically and not before the constitutional court .
the npd was very close to the fifth % hurdle when the vote on sunday .
a first attempt to ban the far-right party was a failure in 2003 , because the protection of the constitution was also informants in the npd top .
in december 2013 , after a long preparation , the federal council submitted a new application in karlsruhe .
the federal government and the bundestag did not join .
harburg : tents for new refugees
refugees are now being placed in tents at the new countries .
the initial central reception for refugees in harbburg bursts out of all seams .
now the internal authority has set up three red cross tents next to it .
the district politicians were only informed shortly before - they are not very enthusiastic .
&quot; these hairuck actions further fuel public reservations and do not give district politicians a chance to participate constructively in the humane housing of refugees , &quot; says britta herrmann , frattionist .
your party demands that the district administration of harburg currently use unused houses for accommodation .
96 refugees can be accommodated in the three tents .
reasons for the overcrowding in the initial reception are the onslaught of aid seekers - and the fact that the authorities do not provide enough places in follow-up facilities .
many refugees therefore remain longer than the regular three months .
house prices have experienced the strongest winter rise in seven years , shows a widely observed index .
the rp data corelogic hedonic home value index for homes in the australian capital increased by 1.1 percent in august , according to monday &apos;s rp data .
this increase has brought the overall increase to 4.2 % in june , july and august , the biggest increase in the winter months since 2007 .
the annual price increase was 10.9 % , more than twice the increase in the 12 months to august 2013 , but the increases were not the same as the country .
the research director of rp data , tim lawless , said that sydney and melbourne had a two-tier market .
the rp data figures show that the house prices in sydney fell by 16.1 % last year , in melbourne by 11.7 % .
the following markets are adelaide , brisbane and darwin , where prices have increased by 5 and 6 % on average .
at the other end of the scale lies canberra , which has been hard hit by cuts in government spending , and where prices have risen by only 1.4 % over the year .
mr lawless also said that spring is now beginning to be the beginning of the next few months , and that the number of properties on sale will rise , which will &apos; put a real test &apos; on the market .
&quot; if you take into account the constantly high rate of auction prices , a generally fast sales rate and the constantly low interest rate environment , it is likely that the home-price prices in the next three months will continue to rise . &quot;
in an opinion to the new press , he contradicts statements by the managing director peer medau and attests to this &quot; as a feldherr &quot; to position .
the style of the university is not , it says .
the medau family was already &quot; verbally informed about the request of the university in mid-june .
the statement that the plans were not announced until july is definitely wrong , &quot; pötzl says .
at the same time , it points out that the plans are not &apos; pre-established or even decisions &apos; , but &apos; preferences &apos; .
the extension of the narrow road leading up to the castle is also less dramatic than the medina feared .
the hotel was , and still is , a nine metre long road .
at the present time , we are talking about 5.50 metres , which is a metre wider than before , &quot; explains pötzl .
the argument of the medau-operators that their free and school-free parking spaces will only be used by students of the university in future is not valid .
the hotel is not located at all because , like other public parking spaces , this can be solved intelligently .
the residents of the area are thinking of
the bergwichtel children ’ s nativity scene , which is located on the premises , and which would lead to the entrance to the park deck on its doorstep , says the president of the university , &quot; will not be affected &quot; .
rather , he suggests that &apos; this is not just about the crèche , but also about the residents of the estuary of the friedrich-striib-straße and the 800 students of the neighbouring secondary school .
so it is much more than a question of the special interests of mr medau , &quot; pötzl said .
whether the criticism of the parent &apos;s advisory board of the child &apos;s crib , by extending the road would be one of the few natural spots in coburg lost &quot; is justified , &quot; the reader can decide for himself &quot; .
in early october , pötzl , together with the state building authority bamberg , intends to inform the city councils about the development of the university by 2020 &quot; and , in this context , to address the importance of the new development &quot; .
peer medau had the parents of the children &apos;s nativity last week informed about the plans of the university .
the new parking deck will not be accessible via the campus and friedrich streib-straße , but via the medau-berg .
this would have to be a two-lane narrow road , which is about a kilometre long .
according to meda &apos;s scores , traffic in the park of hohenfels castle would increase ten-fold .
there are about 2000 vehicles daily .
the city has not yet wished to comment on the project .
glandorf is retiring from handball national team .
holger glandorf will no longer play for the dhb team .
the 31-year-old of the bundesligist sg flensburg-handewitt caused health problems in the first place .
i did not find it easy to make a decision , it has been mature for several months .
it is time for me to listen to the signals of my body and to pursue my career in the national team , &quot; said the 2007 world champion at his facebook page .
it therefore has a record of 167 country games and 576 goals for germany in international retirement .
because the throwing away rock-solid back player is the champions league winner from flensburg for several years to go hunting goalkeeper , he is now on the side of the new bundestrainer dagur sigore .
with the icelanders , who on tuesday took his kader for the swiss national games , glandorf introduced a &quot; long and good conversation .
his ideas and approaches have inspired me as much as they have been to my long-time co-players and my successors .
but for my club i would like to be available in the coming years healthy , for which longer regeneration periods are necessary , which do not allow the current double burden .
the left hand handler had a bad name in 2012 after a heel infection .
due to achilles ’ problems , he had been taken over by team doctors from the german handball association ( dhb ) with a cortisone injection which later caused a strong inflammation .
an emergency operation and two other operations followed .
then , glandorf had announced a complaint against the team doctor , the dispute ended with a comparison .
twelve years of professional and eleven years of national team career do not pass any trace of a body .
i have some health services that i can no longer ignore .
after the three infection-related foot operations that took place in 2012 , i have experienced no real effect on my blood pressure .
this is accompanied by some other wear-related complaints .
i noticed at the beginning of the year that i am steering my head , but i cannot deceive my body , &quot; explained glandorf in the interview to the magazine &quot; handball time &quot; .
for a comeback , he would only be available in absolute emergency .
&quot; if all the strings tear , i am always ready to talk , &quot; the two-fold family father told the specialist magazine .
however , i can still play handball years at one hand .
i must also say that after my long stay in hospital in 2012 , i also became quite humble in terms of my health .
after my career , i would like to be able to go straight to some extent .
in addition to the 2007 world cup and the 2010 champions league win , he won the 2008 ( hsg nordhorn ) and 2010 ( tbv lemgo ) ehf cup .
in 2012 , he also secured the european cup of the cup winner with flensburg .
german economy contracted by 0.2 percent in the spring .
the crises around the world have blighted the german economy in the second quarter .
gross domestic product fell from april to june 2014 , compared to the prior quarter , by 0.2 % .
this was shared by the federal statistical office and thus confirmed preliminary calculations .
consumption alone revived the economy in the spring , while investment declined .
foreign trade , too , slowed down the economy .
thanks to the strong start of the year , a total gdp plus of 0.8 % for the first half of 2013 is achieved .

the route , which was advertised for three different categories , was then led towards herrenholz over the schöppinger berg in the direction of coesfeld and via havixbeck and billerbeck back to horstmar .
on routes of 95 kilometres with 1175 metres of altitude , 120 kilometres with 1475 metres of altitude and 145 kilometres of 1775 metres of altitude , the cyclists proved their good condition .
they were taken to havixbeck and billerbeck on the way .
the main organizer jos ter huerne and mayor &apos;s deputy heinz lölfing showed themselves very pleased with the success of this cycling event .
we are satisfied and it was a wonderful experience for all concerned .
the organization went without problems and there were no negative incidents , &quot; heinz lölfing concludes this event .
unfortunately , not as many participants as the organizer had hoped , which probably was due to bad weather forecasts and early weather forecasts .
&quot; we are looking back in 2015 , hopefully in good weather on 30 august or during another weekend , &quot; but nevertheless promised the cyclists to return to münsterland and the organisers plan to re-run the bike .
constantin wecker &apos;s unscrupulous honest memoirs
it is actually more philosophical than biography , which is what konstantin wecker , songmaker , pacifist , political activist , ex-detainee , in &quot; monk and krieger 220 .
not chronologically , but more thought scraps for thought have been given to the new munich re ( born 1 june 1947 ) .
and he is completely honest : from onanie as a gymnasiast to shoplifting and drug use he does not leave any human weakness .
also , to show how he himself tolerates the treatment of his fellow human beings .
abstract but even more important terms are also used in the room : love , soul , ego , being in now , spirituality - all of this he tries to get to the bottom , to very personal , but also to be .
and he also explains his pacifism , his social criticism , his political commitment - and also how he has influenced not only music ( the opera fan was appointed soul and rock music player ) , but also his own personal commitment .
the latter has also given the lebemann konstantin wecker a new name to the asketic monk , which originates &quot; by subtraction &quot; , as he says , &quot; leaving everything out of necessity &quot; .
there are also short anecdotal doctrines between all the high-minded views : about bats in a gis frequented locally or a mad car ride , where he is a real driver .
he is completely honest about this .
lenny henry : my father never took me into the arm .
has never said &quot; i love you !
henry was one of seven children of a jamaican family of immigrants in dudley in the midlands in 1958 .
his father , who died when henry 19 was working in a factory and their relationship was limited .
henry is trying to get a comedy , rudy &apos;s rare records , some of which were based on an imaginary conversation with his father , and was born on radio 4 .
the soundtrack is a mixture of reggae and rap , with lively melodies .
but henry had to work through some difficult childhood moments .
he visited &quot; many &quot; therapies after the death of his mother , and henry is reflecting on his relationship with his father .
it was difficult to know him .
you never saw his face , only heard his voice : &quot; listen to the crash .
leave your sister in peace .
make a difference !
i want to look at cricket .
my older brothers seymour and hilton - who had already grown up when i was a child - went to the pub with him and talked about things like the shape of beer glass or the beauty of a cricket .
i never had such a conversation with him .
much of my life he was this serious type in the corner that read the newspaper .
henry recently opened a foundry in dudley , and although the conditions are better than those of his father , he gained an insight into how life was for him .
it is now a little brighter , but they are dark , smoked , deep stylish labyrinths with flame pals and smoke and much soot .
my father used to just put himself in the bath and then one could hear him slowly as he started singing because he was the foundry of himself .
when i was around there , i realized that he had done so for years to prepare the food .
however , henry grew up as a child without his parents ’ love stories .
my father never hugged me , he never said &quot; i love you &quot; .
only when my mother went badly towards the end of her life did we start , &quot; i love you , i love you , i love you &quot; to say .
through his own daughter trilee , with dawn french , he was able to share the love he had missing as a child .
could you start with the &quot; i love you &quot; ?
stop hugging me !
papa , i am 22 !
with dawn french .
why should we not be friends ?
she is a great mother .
it is still a french friend with whom he married for 25 years .
dawn is a good person .
why should we not be friends ?
she is a great mother .
henry &apos;s own mother was a diabetic .
this contributed to their death .
so when i became very , very overweight and showed symptoms of diabetes , my doctor said &quot; you must be radical .
so i did this fitness and had to make a drastic diet to reverse the symptoms .
it is very difficult .
and it is exhausting .
nobody likes to eat carrots .
henry ’ s career shift may be reflected in his elegant , short cut beard .
since he was criticized for his othello , he has been captured by the theatre .
the comedy of the misunderstandings followed , and then fences of august wilson .
this is a different experience from sitcoms and comedies that have developed their busy working life .
he began at just 16 years when he worked in a factory .
a dj discovered him on stage when he imitated people and wrote about him on new faces .
his television career began in the mid-1970s , &quot; i was the only black imitator / comedian on television for a fairly long time . &quot;
he learned at work .
i had to be big not only in the eyes of the public , but also from 1975 to 1985 , learn how to become an efficient witze story machine while watching television as a star , and that was really difficult .
lenny was born in 1975 in new faces
since his manager won the stage right at the black and white minstrel show , a light entertainment program , in which the people &quot; black &quot; had to paint .
i was very uncomfortable with my family .
i would like it to be something that never happened , but i do not regret that i did .
it was a strange , unpleasant position for me , but i worked on giant projects and learned how to work with a large audience .
but this &quot; years of award-winning light pillar of british television &quot; was also a &quot; grotesque parody of black people . &quot;
by introducing figures that have influenced both british black culture and celebration , henry worked in the eighties on a new alternative comedy circle .
the first series of lenny henry show was broadcast in 1984 , and in the 1990s he was among others as the chef , gareth blacklock , in the comedy series chef !
advertising , documentary films , tv series and film roles shaped his next decade , but after his bbc series lennyhenry.tv 2008 he thought : &quot; what is you doing next ?
after that , a documentary series for radio 4 was released , entitled what &apos;s so great about ... ?
the first episode was about shakespeare .
i was totally allergic to shakespeare .
i never really learned anything about him at school and thought him to be a middle class domain , white in tights , and a very comb .
so i was very afraid of it .
all of us interviewed for the show , peter hall , trevor nun , adrian lester , judi dench said &quot; you should try it out .
don &apos;t do it badly if you don &apos;t know what you are talking about .
take a few words into your mouth , and then you will understand why we all shakespeare so dear .
henry made 20 lines from othellos last speech for the documentary and he was enthusiastic .
i felt i was able to do that .
it was almost as if someone had put my head on the right .
&quot; that is what it is about , it is a serious thing , take it seriously , learn your text , search a little .
the samples were brutal and i read this piece for months before we did it .
and it was a success .
they seemed to expect a car accident , and that simply did not happen .
and soon he appeared in the comedy of the misunderstandings .
suddenly i was in the national theatre and i could hardly believe it .
there was a moment when i thought &quot; oh , you changed . &quot;
there was a technical error , and henry felt instinctive that he had to entertain the audience .
&quot; a small voice told me &quot; you must now bridge 10 minutes while you are repairing the computer . &quot;
instead , the stage manager announced that the performance would continue as soon as the problem was solved .
i went from the stage and anything in me said &quot; oh thank god &quot; .
i am not responsible for that .
i can leave that to someone else .
&quot; you play in a play , so stay in your role . &quot;
henry in fences at the duchess theatre
the text for fences learning was challenging .
panic is very good , which strengthens the tenders .
that was good too , so it is like a great shield of the gods who say to me &quot; that is your destiny here &quot; .
he says this , of course , with a thundering voice .
so i will stick to that .
i really love that .
i love to be in a sample room .
henry still has the head of a comedian - our conversation is full of humorous outbreaks , while he always imitates people .
i decided not to make a stand-up comedy because i think that this type of immediate satisfaction is from a room full of strangers somehow dangerous .
if you look at it all the time , you will see a wall .
i sometimes appear live in the apollo if i want to , but overall i don &apos;t have as much as i did before .
i ask him if he ever wants to make a stand-up comedy tour again .
the fun i have in a room with a director who helps to make a beginning , a middle section and the end of a journey - i do not think i ever want to give up this again .
so is this his new incarnation ?
i think so .
i am happy to be an actor .
it is fun .
one always tells a story , and that is great .
i love stories .
people love stories .
huthi rebels are blocking streets in yemen ’ s capital city
in the conflict between shiite huthi rebels and yemeni ’ s government , huthis have become civil disobedience in the capital , sanaa .
huthi supporters would have occupied central streets in sanaa on monday , said a huthi party spokesman , &apos; ansar allah &apos; .
the access to parliament was also blocked .
yemeni media report a traffic jam in the capital .
according to the online edition of the newspaper &quot; yemen post &quot; , huthy leader abdulmalik al-huthi had called for action on sunday evening .
according to the sheet , huthi threatened another escalation of the conflict if his demands were not met .
shiite huthis are fighting for more independence from sunni-governed yemen and demanding the resignation of the government .
the people of huthi have been besieging the yemeni capital for almost two weeks .
about 30,000 rebels have protest camps on the main access roads of sanaa .
the surrounding area is full of bloody battles with the yemeni army .
kenya registers officials to contain &quot; ghost workers &quot; .
kenya has begun to register all state officials biometrically to recruit &apos; ghost workers &apos; from government salary lists .
employees who do not register in the next two weeks would no longer pay for their work was a government notice .
the government suspects that thousands of people will still be remunerated after they have left the public service .
president uhuru kenyatta promised , when he took office in 2013 , to combat corruption in the public service .
at the beginning of this year , it was found that at least $ 1 million ( £ 700,000 ) per month in payments for &apos; ghost workers &apos; and other abusive financial practices were lost .
the government suspects that salaries will continue to be paid to accounts after a person has died or left the public service , says wanyama chebusiri for the bbc from the capital nairobi .
all officials will now have to appear at identification centres in the next two weeks to ensure that their data on biometric registrations are recorded , and a government message has been sent .
all those who would not do so without a credible excuse would be removed from the pay list were still in the communication .
&quot; this approach has made a significant contribution to rationalising public service by identifying the actual number of officials and also by improving the pay list at both levels of government - thus &quot; ghost workers &quot; are being eliminated .
the scandal surrounding the art consultant helge achenbach will be brought before the court for the first time on 11 november .
five heirs to berthold albrecht , son of aldi founder theo albrecht , demand a civil trial at the düsseldorf district court of 19.4 million euros for damages from achenbach and two of his companies .
that was shared by a court spokesman on monday .
the plea says that achenbach had a lot of experience in buying works of art and classic cars and that berthold albrecht paid higher purchase prices .
this also made the commission more than it had been agreed .
achenbach has earned valuable items for albrecht for € 121 million .
children need roots and wings
he was in school for 44 years , 23 of them as head of school .
from this time manfred richter knows many petershausener and kollbacher from their time as students .
his methods were sometimes unconventional , but always supported by his desire to see the human being in the student .
the snowkoppe is the most famous mountain in the giant mountains .
manfred richter loves the painting with the motif from his home .
judges was born in trautenau / north bohemia in 1930 , today trutnov .
after four years of secondary school he was already interested in the teacher &apos;s profession .
one year later , the sudeten germans were expropriated .
within half an hour the family had to leave their house .
after a few months in a warehouse , it went to bavaria in 1946 - in the güterwagon .
so judges drove to the upper franconian village of senckendorf .
the teacher was educated in bamberg .
manfred richter had to walk ten kilometres to the nearest station six times a week , take the train to bamberg , drive three kilometres across the city to school and return to the evening .
after two months , manfred richter got a new sleep at a red-kreuz home in bamberg : together with up to 15 co-pupils in a dormitory room .
in 1951 , he made the first and in 1954 , after three years of teaching assistant , he became the second state examinator .
as oberfranken had no free teacher &apos;s office for him , he moved to oberbayern and came to school in kollbach on november 1 , 1954 .
the &quot; mäulein-zimmer &quot; was his first &quot; working apartment &quot; in the school building .
in 1958 , he moved to the newly built teacher house next to the school , where he had a three-room service apartment .
this house bought manfred richter in 1980 after the school had been dissolved in kollbach in 1968 .
until then , in kollbach , the petershausen-kollbach school association had three classes and five in petershausen .
from the 1968 / 69 school year , these were reconstructed in petershausen in the current town hall .
when the school association indersdorf was founded , only the primary school remained in the place .
to avoid a downgrade in the now smaller school , the then rector georg sigl moved to karlsfeld - and manfred richter became his successor .
but petershausen grew , and so the children and their teachers were able to obtain the current building , which was built in 1997 after judge &apos;s retirement .
manfred richter commends the uncomplicated generosity of the then mayor ludwig götz , who additionally built a workshop at the municipal costs and in the expansion of 1997 cellar rooms , although this was not built according to the guidelines .
&quot; mayor götz was very school-friendly &quot; , judges remembered grateful .
in his entire career , manfred richter never forgot the speech of a government representative who was waiting for a department of a school council on law and justice : &quot; you must never forget love &quot; .
&quot; children must be given two things : roots and wings , &quot; said the 84-year-old today .
and he had to learn : &quot; it doesn &apos;t always work &quot; , whether he means only his students or his own six children , is not entirely clear .
in any case , judges do was sometimes unconventional .
when students checked , they did not get criminal work from him and were not donated to reside .
at the expense of the community , judges had given up two pair of boxing gloves and let the two opponents compete against each other , even if there should be a veil .
judges used to have a good relationship with the then mayor ludwig götz ( csu ) as rector for the benefit of the school .
he moved the non-partisan judge after his retirement to be the last to be listed on the csu list for the municipal council in 1996 .
but judges were elected to sixth place and joined the csu .
180 kilometres in three days
hr4-radtour 700 bikers are in the spa park of bad salzhausen and schott stopovers a stop point for a ride .
if cyclists are riding in bad salzhausen or schott on their tour , that is not a special thing in itself .
on friday , however , the number of people who are stopping on the bike left the impression : the 700 participants of the hr4 cycling tour and accompanying tross enjoyed a break in the lower spa park of bad salzhausen and later a party under the open air .
under the motto &quot; cycling and celebrating on new paths discovered between nidda and kinig &quot; , the participants met in bad vilbel on thursday and had a concert by van baker &amp; band there .
on friday , the cyclists took the first stage , which crossed 60 kilometres over florstadt to bad salinhausen and then further to schotten .
in bad salzhausen , the athletes were led by mayor hans-peter seum , who was co-founder of the bike in bad vilbel and the director of the self-drive bad salthausen , petra schwing .
the whole world was filled with good things to refresh body and mind : the landwomen from ranstadt and nieder-mockstadt had 85 plates of apple , white-collar , scattered and other creamy .
&quot; such cakes can only bake rural women &quot; , praised a participant from aulendiebach , while he ordered another piece .
at the beverage stand of the scour-nidda gymnasium cold refreshments were obtained .
the duo bravo entertained the visitors with well-known melodies from operetta and musicals and harvested enthusiastic applause .
the park was very nice and relaxing .
a gentleman also enjoyed a head massage from his partner : &quot; he deserves , after all he has already left off today &apos;s cycle-chains &quot; .
meanwhile , the mayor and the manager of the company had to work : they were buried at the fountain in front of the drinking spa house of reporter rainer janke and took the opportunity to listen to the radio for bad house .
also head of promotion tobias hagen , since the first hr4 cycling tour in 2004 , was able to run short , since he had plenty of technical experience on site .
his pickup truck , where he was able to use three phones and a radio station with his staff and the 15-person motorcycle relay of the police hessen , facebook entries .
&quot; most of the participants come from the rhine-main region , &quot; he said , &quot; but also from gießen or fulda , lauterbach or the taunus and even from numerous cities in western valle .
the number of participants is a bit dependent on the available overnight accommodation capacities .
in category i , participants are accommodated in hotels , in category ii in group accommodation .
the cyclists had a good impression of the spa when they left after a hour and a half : &quot; chicken ! &quot;
&quot; it was nice in bad salzhausen ! &quot; waved to farewell .
after arriving in scotland , the group was allowed to take a short break .
but in the evening the cyclists were required to enjoy the idyllic alteburgpark .
under the direction of the schottener gesellschaft für tourismus und stadtmarketing ( gts ) the park had a beautiful festambiente and of course , it had delicious bakeries , for example flame cakes with well cooled feather white feather .
mayor susanne schaab , gts managing director markus hoßfeld and chairman of the msc-chairman wolfgang wagner-sachs in his capacity as executive board member of adac hessen-thuringia .
the three showed themselves very pleased with the &quot; many factory in scotland &quot; .
dj tobias hagen then released the dance stage .
the opportunity to move freely in the open air was given a chance to do so despite the active activities on the bike .
among the guests were increasingly citizens , attracted by the good mood as well as the great crowd of cyclists .
on the second day , the cyclists had the stations birstein , wächtersbach and bad orb - including a concert with the trenkwaldern - on the programme .
yesterday , after 180 kilometres of cycling , athletes met again in bad vilbel .
dozens of turkish police officers are being arrested for &quot; conspiracy &quot; against the government .
in total , 33 police officers were arrested in turkey for suspecting the &quot; conspiracy against the government &quot; .
the police authorities did not comment directly .
among those arrested , 14 senior police officers , including hurriyet daily , report news .
some of them were involved in corruption investigations against government officials , including four government ministers last december .
in july , a number of turkish police officers were arrested for supposedly setting up an organised criminal association and tapping telephone numbers .
turkish president recep tayyip erdogan ( who was then prime minister ) described their actions as part of the activities carried out by the islamist clergy fethulla güllen against him and other persons .
not all children in ukraine are returning to school
schools throughout ukraine opened on monday ( september 1 ) after the summer holidays .
this day is traditionally an important day for families , and like thousands of ukrainian parents , prime minister arsenij jazenjuk brought his daughter to school .
he told waiting journalists that not all schools had reopened , but that he was determined to open the country for future generations :
september celebrations were not held in every school .
the sky is not peaceful everywhere above ukraine .
we must fight for a peaceful sky .
the whole of ukraine , a huge common ukrainian people &apos;s front , must fight for a peaceful sky .
aleksan pastukhow , school director of the school in slavjansk , who visited jazenjuk &apos;s daughter , spoke in russian .
we hope that peace will finally be restored and that children will receive an education that will be useful to them in their future lives .
the first day of the new school year is traditionally celebrated , with the children wearing embroidered shirts , holding balloons in their hands and giving flowers to their teachers .
with rona fairhead , the bbc may have found the great director it needs .
it meets with a proud towering tow from the banking world , media management , and the inner circle of the tory party .
and it has its own front experience .
her career began with the worldwide management consulting company bain and co . , upon which she was appointed to morgan stanley , bombadier , ici and the media world of pearsons .
for seven years she was chairman of the financial times board and resigned when the parent company pearson was appointed to a younger male .
their compensation was allegedly close to £ 1 million .
their political ranking is also sound .
she was appointed david cameron by lord brown , former chairman of bp , when he sought more private-sector knowledge in whitehall : she was appointed advisor to the cabinet .
her husband is a former tory council member .
as early as may , i described the role of the chairman with a poisoned chalk .
not only is the bbc at the heart of public life , as a huge and complex entity , but there is also an internal paradox in its structure .
confidence has two sides : inwardly , the first guard of the bbc ’ s own management hierarchy , but also outwards as the voice of public concern and unrest when things go wrong .
this creates an almost untenable duopoly that demands full reform .
but which new chairman would risk coming to the meeting , beating on everything and dismantling an institution as complex as a chinese dynasty , while at the same time perhaps looking after his own job .
it is a difficult task .
and as if that were not enough , many are also interested in reducing the bbc - making money , and getting status out of date .
as competition approaches and new technologies bring old , comfortable collateral to the fore , the forthcoming negotiation of the royalties for the bbc is associated with particular dangers .
for the modest sum of £ 145.50 per year , the british public is buying into what is certainly the world ’ s largest media company .
the bbc is telling a good story : it says it has reached 96 % of all households , each of which costs only 40 pence per day .
and it seems that the bbc is rising again on the popularity scale : 53 % support it today , compared to 31 % 10 years ago .
the visual and usage habits of the bbc have changed : i get news headlines on my mobile phone today and see missed programs later on my iplayer .
but she remains a very beloved and significant institution .
it needs a considerable chairman - i hope she has found it .
perry from texas says that lowering tweet was not authorized .
a tweet from the official account of the republican governor of texas , rick perry , on sunday contained a condescending remark about the democratic district prosecutor , who was at the center of a political situation .
the tweet was subsequently deleted and replaced by another perry account that used the previous expiration .
a tweet has just been sent from my account , which was not authorised by me .
&quot; i don &apos;t approve the tweet and i deleted it , &quot; said it in the later message .
perry staff did not respond promptly to requests for comments .
although the tweets of perry ’ s official account were expired , it was not clear who actually served the feed .
in the former tweet an unfavourable picture of the district prosecutor of travis county , rosemary lehmberg , was drawn , which was published in april 2013 due to drunkenness at the tax .
perry vetoed financial support for her office when she refused to resign , leading to an indictment of perry - the possibly 2016 presidential term - that could be a presidential candidate .
the text of the tweet reads : &quot; i do not always go drunk with the three possible alcohol levels ... but if i do , i complain governor perry .
i am the most drunk democrat in texas .
lehmberg ’ s office was not in charge of the investigation of the grand jury against perry .
this was done by michael mccrum , a special public prosecutor from san antonio , who was chosen by a republican judge .
perry pleads not guilty and called the charge a political trick .
his high-class team of legal counsel requested a legal counsel from the judge charged with the case to reject the indictment and argued that the law that was used against the most senior governor in the country .
perry stopped $ 7.5 million of government funds to the public integrity unit of the state - which was set up in travis county and is in cases of state corruption in texas .
this veto has caused a public complaint from a left-wing watchdog group .
perry &apos;s official user account is frequently updated - and sometimes famous .
after attending iowa ’ s election assemblies , during his 2012 presidential candidacy , perry went to speculation that he would stop .
berkeley once again declared housing market &quot; normal &quot;
one of london &apos;s most prominent builders pointed out that the housing market in the south-east of england has returned to normal levels of &quot; returning &quot; .
homes in the capital were very much in demand and were subject to huge price increases , which the bank of england has been unable to do due to widespread fear of a credit bubble in june .
tony pidgley , founder and chairman of the executive board of the high-class construction company berkeley said on monday : &quot; since the beginning of the current financial year , the market has again been at normal transaction levels since 2013 .
the london housing market was well positioned during the downturn , as foreign buyers pushed into the capital .
according to the catasters &apos; office , the prices in the city area alone rose by 18.5 % last year , far more than the average increase in england and wales in total .
the average selling price at berkeley ’ s private , cheap and student offers rose by about one-fifth in the past year , and rose by £ 423,000 at the end of april .
however , a stronger pound has created real estate ownership in london less attractive to foreign buyers in recent months - some of them have also been weakened by the introduction of new property taxes and political rhetoric about a possible &quot; villas tax &quot; .
the london real estate agent foxton warned last week that the mortgage market report for april , which included a sharp rise in credit and mortgage lending , was in the second year .
new data from the bank of england on monday showed a decline in mortgage lending in july , which also indicates that the housing market is cooling .
hamptions international , another real estate agency , corrected his forecast for the rise in real estate prices in london for 2015 down to 3 % , based on a already weakening house price consciousness .
the volume of transactions in the most expensive parts of london , such as chelsea , mayfair and kensington has now fallen by a quarter per year , according to the broker wa ellis .
however , the desire for a home in the capital of berkeley is a blessing , as the amounts due for futures sales amount to more than £ 2.2 billion .
mr pidgley added : &apos; demand for the right , well-planned product at the best locations remained stable and as a result , the sales of futures remained stable . &apos;
in june , the company reported that there were 3,742 new homes sold in the year until the end of april - almost a third more than the peak of 2007 before the crisis .
annual pre-tax earnings rose by 40 percent to £ 280 million annually , sales rose by 18 percent to £ 1.6 billion .
in a communication on monday before the company &apos;s annual meeting , mr pidgley said that the revenue for berkeley is expected to be in line with current market expectations this year .
the analysts concurred with the annual pre-tax result of £ 450 million .
berkeley shares were traded in london in the afternoon at £ 23.96 .
nude photos by jennifer lawrence published by hackers on the internet by jennifer lawrence .
jennifer lawrence is at the 85th oscar award ceremony .
nude photos from oscar-winner jennifer lawrence were taken online by a hacker who claimed to have a &quot; master list &quot; of pictures of another 100 starlets .
a representative of the star from &quot; the tribute of panem &quot; confirmed that the photos of lawrence are genuine and complained to the hacker for &quot; blatant violation of privacy &quot; .
the authorities have been notified and will prosecute all those who have taken the stolen photos of jennifer lawrence .
the photos originally published on the photo sharing page 4chan were supposedly filled with a loophole in the online storage system icloud by apple , which was supposed to be the &quot; master list &quot; of the hackers .
it is not sure how many of the images are real , although winstead , star from &quot; scott pilgrim against the rest of the world &quot; on twitter also condemned the hack .
&quot; to those of you who look at photos that my husband and i took years ago in the private environment of our house - i hope you are really satisfied with you &quot; , winstead wrote on twitter .
victoria justice from the nicklodeon series &quot; icarly &quot; and &quot; victorious &quot; , however , declined that the photos were pictures of her trade .
let us just fight back to the beginning .
buzzfeed reported on late sunday that a spokesman of pop star ariana grande has questioned the authenticity of the alleged photos of it .
exclusive excerpt from howard jacobson ’ s highly acclaimed new novel about love and the letter “ j ” .
it was best described as it was broken , it slowly disintegrated into the carton that was left in the rain .
at times , a woman told him that he was too serious , tiring , intense , distanced , and perhaps a little scratchy .
and then shaken his hand .
he knew scratch brush .
he was stuck , like in igel , yes .
the last victim of this stachechoism was a recent affair that was more promising in terms of easing the lonely boredom of his life than usual , and perhaps even brought him some satisfaction .
ailin solomon was a trembling , tender beauty with untamed hair and a flattering heart from a village on the north island , which is even more remote and rough as port reporter .
she had come south with an older companion , who kept kevers for their aunt , and which had a plot in a humid but paradisiacal valley with the aptly named paradise valley .
for several years nobody had lived in the house .
the tubes were leaky , the baths were still spiders , neck boxes had their traces left on all windows and believed that they belonged to them all , and the garden was covered with weeds .
it was like the house from a child &apos;s fairy tale , both threatening and tempting , a garden full of mysteries .
portrait of the author : howard jacobson , whose novel &quot; j &quot; on the longlist for which man booker prize 2014 is available .
the shortlist will be announced next week .
kevern had been on the broken side of the sheltered sun loungers with ailin keeping and had an unusually warm spring afternoon .
your feet are too big .
because of their own aggressiveness , songs of this kind were no longer played on the console .
not banned - nothing was really banned - just not played .
it was successfully obsolete , just as the word obsolete .
the general taste created what erasure and regulation would never have achieved , and how people used to make the vom tellrecher to millions of memoirs , cookers and songs on books .
in the euphoria of the day , kevern began playing an imaginary piano and playing in a grob funny serenade of ailin &apos;s big feet .
ailin did not understand that .
&quot; this was a well-known song by a jazz pianist called fats waller , &quot; he explained it and automatically put two fingers on his lips .
his father had always done this to stop the letter j before he came out of his mouth .
it had begun as a game between him and his father when he was still small .
his father had played it with his own father , so he had told .
if you start a word with a j without two fingers to put your lips , it costs you a penny .
it was not a very funny game at that time , and it was not very funny now .
he knew that he was expected to do so , that was all .
it had to explain what jazz was .
ailin had never heard of him before .
jazz was a popular music , but not directly banned .
improvisation was no longer modern .
there was only room for a single &quot; if &quot; in life .
at the beginning of a melody , people wanted to be quite sure where they would end .
so is the mind .
his unpredictability made people nervous .
and jazz was musically expressed mind .
although he had grown 10 years old without being heard by sammy davis junior , kevern knew about jazz from the half-secret collection of old cds of his father .
but at least he did not have to explain to ailin that fats waller was black .
at her age she probably could not remember a time when pop singers were not black .
again , no laws or constraints were applied .
a conformity meant that every element of this society was grateful to the principle of group talent - grateful as those spared fate .
people with afro-caribbean origins were vulnerable to entertainment and sports through temperament and body building , so they sang and ran .
people who originally came from the indian subcontinent were like nature with electronic talent , and were blessed with the task of ensuring that the subcontinent did not have a family without a working telephone .
what was left of the polish community was the sewage system ; what was said by the greeks was broken down .
those from the gulf states and the levante , whose grandparents had not left the country quickly than what had happened when it happened , fear of being forced to flee for fire .
everyone according to their abilities .
since she had only heard ballads , it was difficult for ailin to understand how the offensive words kevers just made her available to her were ever to be sounded .
music was an expression of love .
&quot; they are not really offensive , &quot; said kevern .
except perhaps for people whose feet are too big .
my father never insulted anyone , but he loved this song .
he talked too much , but the neglected garden gave him the deceptive sense of security .
nothing could prevent the sound insulation of the huge cohllike leaves .
ailinn still did not understand .
why would your father have loved such things ?
he wanted to say that it was a jux , but hesitated to raise two fingers again in their presence .
she already thought that he was something strange .
&quot; it seemed funny to him , &quot; he said instead .
she shaken her head and closed down kever &apos;s view .
there was nothing else to see around the world than to see her uncombed rabel-black hair .
there was nothing he would have liked to see .
&quot; if you say it , &quot; do not mean it without conviction .
but that doesn &apos;t explain why you like it to me .
they seemed to be genuinely concerned .
are my feet too big ?
he looked again .
your feet do not directly .
maybe your ankles , a little bit ...
and thou sayest thou hates me , because my ankles are too thick ?
hate you ?
of course i do not hate you .
that is just the stupid song .
he could have said &quot; i love you &quot; , but it was too early for that .
&quot; your thick ankles are exactly the reason why you like me , &quot; he tried it instead .
i am a bit perverse .
that did not sound right .
it should have been funny .
when he tried to be funny , he often got into trouble because he , like his father , did not have the soothing charm that one needed to reproduce the wrinkles inherent in jokes .
perhaps his father also wanted to be cruel .
perhaps he wanted to be that , kevern .
despite his friendly eyes .
ailin solomons was red and rose from her deck chair , threw the console and wiped it away .
the wine of the florist , so drunkenness was no excuse for him .
in their excitement , they seemed to tremble like palmwedel in the storm .
&quot; and your thickhead is precisely why i am dragged to you perverted , &quot; she said ...
except that i am not .
she was sorry , both because of the unnecessary unfriendliness of his words and the fear that she saw when she stood up against him .
did she think he would beat her ?
she had not told him about life on the cold northern archipelago where she had grown up , but he had no doubt that it was essentially as here .
the same huge and icy ocean broke here as there on the shore .
the same confused men , with even thicker skin and more despairing after what had happened than their ancestors as smugglers and beach-robbers , pulled from pub to bar .
dickhead ?
they would have shown her a big fist if she didn &apos;t fit !
they crumble first - crumbling was the most commonly used word for erotic attraction between men and women , a antidote to the not-sounding love ballads from the cone .
kever thought that was an unnecessary refinement , because the crunch itself was already an act of violence .
ailin solomons gave him a sign to go through her body .
he rose from the deck chair like an old man .
she also felt bleaches , but the strength of his grief surprised her .
that was not the end of the world .
they hardly knew each other .
she watched him as he distanced himself - just as she had her companion from a room on the top floor - a man complaining about something he herself had summoned .
adam leaves the garden , she thought .
she felt a sudden pain for him and men in general , although some had raised their hands against them .
one man turned away from her , bent his back , shame , defeated , without a fighting spirit - why was this a sight that she seemed to know well when she was not at the same time at all .
when she was alone again , ailin looked at solomon &apos;s feet .
several years before the just told events esme nussbaum worked , an intelligent and enthusiastic 32-year-old researcher on behalf of ofnow , the non-legislative monitoring organ for the study of the environment .
&quot; a lot has already been done and much still needs to be done , &quot; she wrote , &quot; to understand the innate aggressiveness of a people who waged a thousand wars and won most of them , especially in the descendants .
but some features turn out to be inexorable .
the higher the church tower , it seems , the smaller the passion that it continues to awaken .
the population is crying when hearing sentimental ballads , wandering through stories of overgrown difficulties , and claiming to be firmly committed to the virtues of marriage and family life , but the former raw material is not only holding back .
&quot; they have an unfortunate tendency to exaggerate , &quot; said their mentor when he had read the whole report .
i suggest you read fewer novels .
esme walnut tree lowered her head .
i must also ask : are you atheist ?
&quot; i think i don &apos;t have to say that , &quot; esme nussbaum answered .
are you lesbian ?
esme again referred to her right to privacy and refusal of the statement .
feminist ?
silence again .
&quot; i don &apos;t ask this , &quot; said luther rabinowitz , &quot; because i am against atheism , lesbenism or feminism .
this is a prejudice free job .
we serve a prejudice free society .
but certain types of hypersensitivity , which are in themselves absolutely acceptable and commendable , can sometimes produce results as they have presented .
they themselves have apparently prejudices against the church , and these things that they call &quot; reprehensible &quot; and &quot; rough &quot; could be interpreted by others as just an expression of natural strength and vitality .
if we continue to ride on what happened , if it happened , as if it were , if it had happened yesterday , it means giving the country its vital vitality .
esme walnut tree looked around while rabinowitz spoke .
behind his head , a led font in flamingorosa repeated the advice ofnow gave to the country in the last quarter-century or longer .
smile to your neighbors , value your partner , listen to ballads , visit musicals , use your phone , talk , explain , listen to , agree , apologise .
speaking is better than silence , the vocal word is better than the written one , but nothing is better than love .
&quot; i understand perfectly what you want to go down to , &quot; esme nussbaum responded with a quiet voice , when she was sure that her chief executive had spoken to the end , &quot; and i do not say anything else than we healed effectively .
my concern is that , without warning , we may find ourselves in the same situation as we are repeating the mistakes that have only been made when it happened .
this time , however , it is not the others that we are letting out our anger and distrust .
luther rabinowitz shaped a pyramid with his hands .
to indicate an engelspatience .
&quot; they go too far , &quot; he said , &quot; if they call acts &quot; errors &quot; that our grandparents may or may not have committed .
they also go too far in saying that they are not doing their &apos; anger &apos; and &apos; distrust &apos; to &apos; others &apos; .
it should not be necessary to remind someone in your position that we are not doing anything about understanding the past as we do about protecting the present , not about &apos; us &apos; and &apos; others &apos; .
there was no &quot; we &quot; and there were no &quot; others &quot; .
it was a time of disorder , that is all we know .
&quot; of that , if we are honest with ourselves , &quot; esme dared to throw in , &quot; no part of society can claim to have behaving well .
i am not complaining to anyone .
whether it was done badly or well , what happened , has happened .
that was then .
nothing more needs to be said about this - we agree on that .
and just as no blame must be assigned , no blame must be repaid if such repayment is appropriate and if there is a way to remedy it .
but what is the point of the past if we do not learn from it ?
the past serves to forget them .
if i may say something about this , i would like to say that
luther rabinowitz let his pyramid fall together .
&apos;i will consider your report , &apos; he said and released it .
the next day , when she went to work as usual , she was overrun by a motorcyclists who , as passers-by have described , were walking in a kind of &quot; brutal rage &quot; .
there are coincidences .
lesotho military member says that no coup is planned ; prime minister remains in south africa ;
military officials in lesotho argued that a coup d &apos;état to overthrow the government was planned , and said that they were going against policemen who had been accused of armed political fanatics .
prime minister thomas thabane fled the country and said that the country ’ s army had encircled its headquarters and had government buildings occupied in the capital maseru .
the premier brought his family to the adjacent south africa after he had reported attacks .
military spokesman major ntele ntoi said that there was no de facto coup , but that the military responded to the threat of &quot; political fanatics &quot; whose armed forces were not able to control .
&quot; what happened this morning was that the army of defense forces operated by lesotho after receiving several intelligence reports that there were some elements within the police that actually had some of the political , partisan boys .
south african spokesman clayson monyela said that military action had the impression of a crash .
&quot; even if no one has claimed to have seized the government by force , all reports agree that the activities of the defense forces of lesotho have hitherto shown signs of a coup d &apos;état , &quot; he said .
speaker of the military of lesotho announced on sunday that the soldiers had returned to their barracks and had a calm situation in the capital .
in the meantime , deputy prime minister mothejoya metsing is taking over the leadership of thabana ’ s absence .
thabane told him that he believed he was wrong because of his attempt to combat corruption in the country .
in lesotho , there has been great tension since june , after thabane ’ s parliamentary meetings were suspended because of the clashes in his unity government .
he said that his actions did not undermine the government to make any other accusations .
production in the eurozone at a 13 month low
the rise in output in the eurozone slowed to the lowest point in the last 13 months in august , according to a closely observed study .
the final markit purchasing management index of the manufacturing industry ( pmi ) fell to 50.7 in august , after a stand of 51.8 in july .
a value of 50 indicates an expansion .
new orders were withdrawn and factories were experiencing breakdowns at a time of increasing tensions between the eu and russia over ukraine .
the figures are coming up before the european central bank ( ecb ) meeting on thursday .
markets expect the bank to come up with a clear plan for dealing with a hesitant eurozone recovery and the threat of deflation at an inflation rate of only 0.3 % .
there is speculation that the head of the ecb , mario draghi , will be able to give further information later this week as to whether he will consider quantitative easing for the euro area , in line with those of the financial crisis and the united kingdom .
&quot; although small growth is better than no growth , the braking effect of the growing economic and geopolitical uncertainties has become clearer for manufacturers , &quot; said rob dobson , senior economist .
the factory pmi for germany , russia ’ s largest trading partner in the eu , fell at its lowest level in 11 months , at 51.4 .
meanwhile , in the second largest economic nation of the bloc , france , the pmi fell to 46.9 .
france remains a problem child , as italy ’ s descent from a solid expansion to stagnation .
evidence that growth stimulus is a key factor in germany and spain and the netherlands is no longer effective is also unreassuring , &quot; said mr dobson .
the decline in industry is likely to fuel the fire of analysts , who expect further monetary or fiscal stimulus .
a positive news came from the republic of ireland , where the pmi rose to 57.3 , the highest level since the end of 1999 .
howard archer , chief economist at ihs global insight , said : &quot; the best you can do for the purchasing management index of the manufacturing industry in the euro area in august is the best .
he added : &apos; producers in the euro area are obviously finding life quite difficult at the moment , as the current heightened geopolitical tensions - especially in relation to russia and ukraine - increase uncertainties in the continuing difficult conditions in many countries .
these increased uncertainties have clearly affected the economy - in particular , and consumer confidence , and presumably lead to some orders being delayed or even cancelled , particularly large orders .
he said that it would be &apos; ever more likely &apos; for the ecb to finally introduce a type of qe , &apos; although we suspect that this will be limited . &apos;
the hellness of the survivors of beslan : ten years have passed since the terrible siege of the school , as the children involved are still suffering today .
ten years ago , more than 1 000 people were killed by chechen militias in a school in beslan in southern russia .
more than 330 people , more than half of them children , were killed in the three-day martyrdom that shocked the world .
we have returned to beslan to find some of the victims who died in the atrocity in the classroom .
just a decade after the appalling siege of the school of beslan , where 334 people were killed , including 186 children , the heroic survivors warned of a new apocalypse last night .
when fanatical islamist terrorists killed children and parents on 1 september 2004 , the beginning of a new school year , they seemed to be like the worst of evil .
the tragedy united west and east in abhorrence , and then turned surprisingly into action and hope for the future in the midst of the worst misery .
ten years later we returned to beslan to find some of the victims who were killed in the atrocity in the classroom .
we found surprising young people who overcome resistance , even though the memory of this terrorist hell will persecute them forever .
your greatest hope ?
the fact that the war that is now affecting ukraine - and in which children like them die - is now coming to an end .
the girl who was photographed in an attempt to get into the shattered school hall .
it was beliached by russian star photographer dimitri beliakov and was famous when she only tried to get into the shocked school hall in her underwear after a miner exploded .
she was also a member of the nba , a group of friends who were also involved in the development of the new york times .
both were thought dead , but survived .
&quot; a woman told me i was supposed to run for my life , but i could not , &quot; said aida then .
my legs were flooded with blood .
i stood up and climbed again to look for my mother .
a soldier brought them into safety .
after a series of operations she felt completely healed , but said yesterday : &quot; three months ago , the pain returned .
i am afraid i have to be operated again .
some shards of grenade are still in my knees .
your goal is to become a dentist to help people , as doctors have helped them .
&quot; this tragedy changed my life , but it did not break me , &quot; says she martial .
&quot; this happened to me and that cannot be changed .
once a year i go to the sports hall to remember those who stayed there .
my friends and i try not to talk about it on other days .
the pain is too great .
my best friend and future classmate dzera gapoeva was killed there .
we played together when we were small , dreaming of going to school together .
&quot; i don &apos;t want to marry until i finish my studies and start my career .
i think of a family later .
she says that the siege will always remain a part of her , although the memory becomes a little weaker every year .
i am glad that many people in the world still remember our horrors and we are so grateful for the help we have received from people in the uk and everywhere .
when i see the photo of me online as i climb back to school , i think that many people see it for the first time to understand our disaster and help to prevent this happening again .
the boy who fled through the ball hook in the belief that his mother was dead .
it was his first day at school ( russians go to school at the age of 7 ) and survived the three-day siege in the arms of his mother tamara .
as a seven-year-old , he said : &apos; mom told me i should lie down if there was an explosion and keep her hand &apos; .
after an explosion he thought she would die .
she said to him : &quot; run . &quot;
they were afraid to be dead , he fled and saw a weeping baby on the way , took it by hand and fled by a ball hook .
his father vladimir , who locked his son out in the arms , said : &quot; damir told me that his mother had died .
he said : &apos; i could not save you . &apos;
in reality , tamara was stumbled out and with leg injuries in the hospital , in turn , assuming that her son had died .
after her reunification she said : &apos; i wept with joy .
i could not believe it .
he ran in and hugged me .
damir was later flown to london ( from the now dissolved newspaper news of the world ) to be led by the then prime minister tony blair and his wife cherie to a barnardo &apos;s champion children .
&quot; this horror follows you every day , but i wish i could stop remembering , &quot; he said yesterday .
but i can say that in my memory it becomes fainter .
i know that i will be able to warn all my toy guns straight after that .
but now i can play computer games with shot scenes and that is no problem for me .
&quot; i don &apos;t fear going back to the sports hall , but i don &apos;t think about myself .
i remember those children with whom i played in the court , who did not get out .
we never say that they were killed or dead .
we say that they have remained in the sports hall .
i remember my trip to london very well , especially the toy shop , where i could pick everything i wanted , and the trip to london was an open car .
but now he is afraid of places like ukraine , where wars cause the kind of misfortune that he and his friends have suffered .
this horror follows you every day , but i wish i could stop reminding me .
&quot; i &apos;m sorry for all those who suffer from the abominations , &quot; damir said , who last week was a volunteer in a monastery .
i would like to help you .
one day i want to go to the police and hope that you will take me to the school next year .
his mother tamara , 48 said : &quot; 37 children from our neighborhood were killed , can you imagine ?
i remember the terrible silence after the siege , there were simply no children who shouted and could walk around , and that silence lasted many months .
she is vividly reminded of her trip to london with damir .
the people of london wept when i told our story .
i understood then how people across the world could understand our feelings , and show their support .
she was grateful to cherie blair and her foundation for the prize and the opportunity to travel to london in autumn 2004 .
i wish i could call cherie and just tell her that 10 years have passed , but i still remember the meeting with her and her husband in london , and how that damir helped me .
i remember damir ’ s desire to eat borschtsch and to call upon all local russian restaurants .
i remember him working with cellars in a restaurant , damir was shocked by his water gun and they ran away and played with him .
and that was just a month after the horror .
i was surprised that the british were so willing to share our pain and support us .
she said : &quot; i always think that this world has not improved in these 10 years .
in ukraine , the war is now continuing and people are dying every day , and i believe that many children have been killed and are still being killed .
these are just children like ours .
i think that for many , the war is part of the news you hear when you are bored or busy with something else .
i know what these people feel , the whole horror .
and i can not stop feeling that .
nothing has changed , people still want to kill each other and that is so sad .
damir grew big and is a very gentle and quiet boy , he is not aggressive or angry at all .
for example , he does not seek revenge , he is not overwhelmed by past abominations .
i know he does not like to remember it , but he has six close friends from the class and they occasionally go to the sports hall and ignite candles there .
when he was smaller , he suffered - i remember how he sometimes referred to the sofa , the face turned away from us , for hours .
not sleeping , his eyes were open .
i also remember how he used all his weapons and other military toys , and damir is now 17 , bigger than me , looking good , intelligent and healthy .
i can hardly believe that i was so sure for a few hours that he was dead and i would never see him again .
when i recovered after the explosion and came on my feet , i looked around and saw the hell around me , with all around body parts .
i was absolutely sure that my little boy could not survive in this hell .
&quot; i remember calling him &quot; damir , run , run away &quot; , but i was so sure that the next day he would not hear me .
but he has heard it and he has gone .
and thus life , unlike that of many others , continues for us .
georgij ilyin 17
the boy whose terrible image has been transformed into the symbol of beslan &apos;s abomination after siege has been transformed into the symbol of the abomination of beslan .
consolation : the beslan survivor georgij lyin with his mother fatima after the siege of 2004 , right a picture of georgij today a picture of georgij on the right .
his bloodstream face was marked by fear when he ran for his life , while chechen terrorists were not able to defeat his classmates .
his image was one of the most shocking symbols of beslan &apos;s barbarism .
his mother fatima , 54 , a doctor , had taken him off for his first day in school before rushing to get her older son vladimir to university .
&quot; i left the court about two minutes before the terrorists stormed him , and so my little boy was left there for three terrible days alone , &quot; she remembers .
not alone , there was a whole family of relatives of us , but they were all killed .
only my georgij managed to survive .
the closer this date is , the more difficult it is to think about and talk about it .
there is not a single day when we do not remember this tragedy .
we do not think it is a long time ago , i think it would have happened yesterday , some scenes from these days keep following me forever .
nobody will ever forget that , i promise you .
the image of georgij ( left ) was one of the most shocking of the attack and was described as a statue ( right ) .
i remember that on that day georgij wanted to go to school so much , saying he wanted to embrace his teacher .
i knew he was alive when i saw him on television .
and now there is even this statue of the weeping georgij in san marino .
georgij doesn &apos;t like the picture and it is at home on the bookshelf .
i understand that , but i also think that people around the world feel our pain thanks to this picture .
georgij says today : &quot; it is important that this can never happen again .
&quot; i doubt that we will ever hear the truth .
people are constantly investigating such tragedies and never hear the truth .
and now you are investigating the crash of this boeing in ukraine .
will we ever know what caused it ?
this world is becoming something terrible .
&quot; i cannot understand how this is possible , because if you ask people , nobody wants war , so how is it ?
ten years is nothing to do with such pain .
we need dozens of years to forget it a little .
it has attacked my health and i still feel it .
for about three or four years i had a few nightmares because of the siege , but then it was better .
i went back to school in 2004 and was afraid every day .
i thought of my friends and classmates who had been killed .
that is why i always go to the sports hall when 1 september is approaching .
i want to pay tribute to my old friends of childhood .
it is hard for me to go to the sports hall , but i must do it .
i do not feel that i am a victim , this story is now part of my past .
i will not forget it , but i am not sorry .
my life goes on .
i finished school this year and i am visiting a medical university in vladikawkaz .
i will become a cardiac surgeon .
my first choice was an education in the army .
i wanted to become a soldier , but my health did not allow it .
i wanted to fight for my country , but that will not happen .
georgij faniyev 20
the boy who survived , though at the foot of a murderous terrorist , was captured .
a miracle : georgij faniyev was under siege at the foot of a murderous terrorist , but he managed to survive .
during the siege he was caught in the sports hall and sat next to the bomb that was at the foot of a murderous terrorist .
it is truly a miracle that he was not killed .
&quot; we feel it was yesterday , &quot; says georgij , who was appointed intelligence officer to the fsb , but this is due to his health damage due to the siege .
it is still with me , it is not something i have left behind .
i am now older and people say that children can easily deal with bad experiences - i have to say that is not true .
&quot; in 2006 i worked with psychologists and after that i felt a little better , but i can not forget it .
and i would like to forget .
2005 - in the year after - was the first and only time that i went back to the sports hall .
i lost consciousness .
i will never go back to that and i would ask you not to show you where i sat in this famous picture .
survivors : georgij faniyev today , with a photo of himself in the hospital after siege on the laptop .
my pain is monstrous and i carry it every day with me .
my friends know that i do not like to think about or talk about it and they never asked me about it .
i am physically well off .
i should be careful with my wounded knee , but i can now run well .
but because of my health , i could not attend the fsb ’ s secret service academy in st petersburg , as i wanted .
i have sent my documents , including the medical ones , and you have replied that it is not possible .
my second passion was the animals , so i went to the veterinary institute .
i have been there for two years .
he learns the treatment of all animals &quot; from cats to cows &quot; .
he said : &quot; i knew i never told my children about my experiences .
children should not know about this and they should not suffer it , of course .
his mother marina , 42 , said : &quot; this pain never leaves me .
it is in my soul , worse when the anniversary is approaching .
i will go to the celebrations .
i know that georgij will not go .
it must be much more violent for him because he was there and i was not .
i waited at home for him and could not help .
i am so grateful to god that he has been returned to me , here in beslan all of them are drawn .
it remains in us .
georgij is now an adult , but this horror is still in him .
it is difficult to accept that if something like this is unfair .
he is a young , he likes sport , but he cannot participate because of his knee .
it has been operated several times , it can run but it does not exercise .
i would say that it has overcome the horror by 50 % , but it can never be completely overcome and forgotten .
this terrible experience will always be with us .
many friends and neighbours were killed during the siege , and that only reinforces my pain .
i have lost many people i knew well and who were expensive to me .
my son is with me , and this is the biggest gift that god could make me , but my heart cry for the killed .
i know of families in which new children were born , but also witwen , who never married again .
it is difficult to accept that life should continue , even if you do not want it .
i will never forget how my heart jumped in me when i saw him in hospital .
and now i see what is happening in the world - wars in other regions .
what are these people fighting for ?
why are they killing each other ?
the war is now very close to our country and i almost cannot believe that .
we used to be a friendly country , how can it be that we are fighting now ?
people and children are suffering , i am sure that many children have already been killed and many more are still being killed in ukraine .
if we only attack and throw all of these rebels , as far as possible .
aljona tskayeva , 10
the baby , so severely damaged by a special mission command , is now safely worn .
rescued : aljona tskajewa is being safely taken by a russian special mission command ( left ) .
she is now ten ( right ) and does not remember the cruelty of the cruelty of the cruelty of the past .
the world stopped breathing in 2004 when the baby aljona was born in the arms of a russian policeman from the besiege of beslan .
the terrorists left them to go , but kept their 30-year-old mother , 10-year-old kristina and her brother makhar in the school hall in their cruelty .
makhar , then three years old , escaped , but aljonas ’ mother and sister died in the murderous slaughter .
her father , ruslan , has since married again and has worked with his new wife swetlana to become a little girl that she has named kristina after his lost daughter .
aljona , ten years old today , does not remember the siege and has become an intelligent and happy girl , say neighbors .
&quot; they are now a great happy family and aljona and makhar are both great children , &quot; says a close friend .
ruslan is a fantastic father and wants to save you all the memories that were born with the tenth anniversary .
you will understand why .

4 tips for better underwater photos and videos
if you want to take photos or videos under water , there is a selection of devices .
the cheapest option is a waterproof point and shoot , like the nikon coolpix aw120 or an action cam like the gopro heroes .
i took these photos on a family festival with several cameras , all at a price below $ 350 .
irrespective of the equipment , there are some rules for the best results .
check your equipment twice .
even if you have a waterproof camera , make sure that the battery compartment and other compartments are closed close .
put your camera on the photos or videos you want to record .
some cameras and camcorders have scene and recording modes that allow the exposure time for the damping underwater conditions to be optimized .
and before you jump into it , check to what depth your equipment is functional .
some cameras are only allowed for up to 5 feet , others up to 50 or 60 feet .
search our shopping guide and reviews for digital cameras for conventional and waterproof models .
make multiple recordings - because many will not work .
point-and-shoot cameras feature an lcd that lets you compose images , action cams usually do not .
even if you have an lcd , it is difficult to see it under water , and the correct image setting is a lucky issue .
so make many pictures .
if your camera has a series mode that allows a series of images with slightly changed exposure settings , use it .
stay close to the surface .
the more you move from the surface , the worse the light becomes .
so if possible , they stay close to the surface when shooting in a pool , a lake or the sea .
this will also allow you to bring more color to your photos ; the deeper you go , the less color you will see .
approach the objects closely .
that is also good advice on land , but it is all the more important under water because of the poor light conditions .
it is especially important to start working with an action cam : these devices often have a fixed wide angle lens , which means that they are more densely aligned to their objects when they are not in the entire frame .
andrew lawson was a man of the variety whose character changed things , even in such a gigantic organization as the nhs .
as an anaesthesia doctor , he devoted his career to the task of providing patients with both the agony of the disease and the pain of treatment .
among his patients , his wife remembers , was a mi6 employee who was inundated with the devastating effects of torture .
lawson knew that doctors had been given the importance of diagnosis and disease , while the treatment was largely based on something else : pain .
one day , however , in 2007 he was the one whose path of suffering began .
&quot; i did not feel , &quot; he wrote in may this year .
i had difficulty getting up .
while he is struggling with flu symptoms , he noticed that he was impatient with his wife juliet .
&quot; i want everything immediately rather than later , &quot; he noted .
as juliet for a week on a business trip , lawson felt quite unusual and unsettling .
there was something in the air .
he asked a colleague to carry out an x-ray inspection of his breast .
only two weeks ago he had been skiing in the french alps .
the result of the x-ray investigation was available .
he suffered from mesothelioma , an incurable cancer that caused the breast fur , that is , the skin that overlaps the lungs .
as with most cancers , the exact trigger is usually difficult to determine .
while some smokers , for example , suffer from lung cancer , not all lung cancer patients have been smokers before .
but mesotheliom is different .
in almost all cases , the trigger is an asbestos contamination - contact with the fiber , which was once considered a &quot; miracle &quot; but has now been recognized as lethal .
for most of us , mesotheliom is a disease that can easily ignore .
asbestos is , after all , a product of the past .
the most dangerous type of asbestos has not been used in britain since the 1960s when the industry voluntarily committed itself to no longer using it .
even where it was still used , only people in certain sectors worked directly with the fabric - plumbers , construction workers , carpentry and shipyard workers , for example .
as an industrial hazardous material from another age , it seems to be hardly worrying today .
but this complacency is inappropriate .
britain , it seems , is experiencing the culmination of a mesoleum epidemic today .
there are more deaths from mesothelioma here than in any other country in the world .
with a total of 2,500 deaths per year , twice as many people die from this disease than from road accidents .
annual figures of mesothelial deaths since 1980 , and anticipated future deaths in the uk
the reason we are now seeing the lethal effects , even though asbestos has been illegal for years ( 1999 all types of asbestos were banned ) , is that a mesotheliom is only developing after decades .
and the scourge of the mesotheliom is not confined to former workers in the construction industry .
asbestos was , and is still often , present in the houses where we live , the offices in which we work , the schools in which we learn and the shops in which we shop .
and therefore mesotheliom knows no class barriers , financial limits , professions or age .
the privileged bastions , from the elegant department stores in london to private schools , are not a shelter .
parliament buildings are contaminated with asbestos .
in the hospitals where we are supposed to be healthy , we have also been used as a source of this deadly carcinogens .
andrew lawson was not old .
he was not a plumber either .
he was indeed hard to imagine where he could possibly be in contact with asbestos .
then he found it out .
&quot; it seems that the tunnels at guy &apos;s hospital , where i have been living for six years , are not a lot of asbestos . &quot; wrote .
all - students , nurses , doctors and nurses - use the tunnel .
one wonders how many of my fellow members of my age will suffer from the same disease ?
unfortunately , he was able to answer this question at least in part .
&quot; of the four doctors who worked at the guy &apos;s hospital and who have been in the hospital for the last five years , &quot; he said .
how many of us will become ill ?
andrew lawson was born mesotheliom at the age of 48 .
when he died on 17 february this year , he was 55 .
this was an unusually long survival time .
fifty percent of all mesotheliogeneous diseases die within 8 months of diagnosis .
the disease always ends lethal .
we can therefore only repeat the question of lawson : &apos; how many of us will become ill ? &apos;
the uk ’ s leading expert on mesotheliom , professor julian peto , assumes that between 1870 and 2050 , when the asbestoy epidemic is likely to stall in the uk , 90 000 victims .
most of them do not yet know that they will die like that .

a quick look at the files of the courts , to which the parties concerned often turn for compensation claims , shows how far the scourge of the mesothelium is already widespread .
in june of this year , for example , marks &amp; spencer admitted that janice had been negligently exposed to asbestos .
she worked for nine years for the chain , from 1978 to 1987 and was responsible for the clothing department at two locations - one of them the flagship store at oxford street .
mrs. allen was only 18 years when she started her activity at m &amp; s .
now she has two children in the twenties .
&quot; before this thing , &quot; says she , &quot; i had never heard of mesotheliom , i did not even know anything about asbestos .
i never thought that would affect me .
there are few people who know a lot about asbestos .
the fact is that the term asbestos is not a substance but a group of six minerals .
the name comes from the word &quot; asbestiform &quot; , a description of the fibre structure that makes the fabric resistant and flexible .
three of the six were used in the construction industry .
chrysotil , also known as white asbestos , is by far the most common asbestos found in buildings today .
it was designed for roofing plates , floor tiles , rohro soldering , boil insulation , even for brake coating in cars .
it is less lethal than other forms of asbestos , but it is still considered by the eu and the who as a &apos; major health risk &apos; with possible death .
however , the brown asbestos ( amosite ) and blue asbestos ( krokydolith ) are more dangerous .
britain was once the world ’ s largest importer of brown asbestos , and experts suspect that &quot; there are clear but indirect indications that this is a major reason for the uniquely high mesothelioma rates . &quot;
a representative of marks &amp; spencer was appointed to the flagship store at oxford street , london , asbestos , alamy , alamy .
janice allen may not have proven to be a typical mesotheliopfer , but julian peto ’ s work suggests that her story is not unusual .
he has presented a study by those concerned , which states that &apos; a significant proportion of mesotheliomas can be found in the world without a known suspension of work or in the house due to asbestos contact with the environment &apos; .
he said that a large part of these contacts are based on the &apos; normal use and aging &apos; of our buildings .
it seems that nobody can assume that they are safe .
a report by goddard consulting , which examines the palace of westminster , shows how people , including in the heart of the government , have been unknowingly exposed to the substance .
in 2009 , goddard reported that the service shafts and pipelines behind parliament &apos;s committee rooms were contaminated with asbestos , whose deadly fibres were replaced by something as harmless as &apos; strong air movements &apos; .
members of parliament are often accused of caring for their own interests , but it seems that the opposite is true .
while the directorate of the parliamentary labour service insisted that the westminster palace should have received a &quot; clean health certificate &quot; , it is now undisputed that £ 1 billion of work is required to be increased by several years .
the goddard report also pointed out that &apos; the presence of asbestos cannot be handled in accordance with the respective provisions &apos; .
no one can know whether this mismanagement will cost lives .
all we can do now is wait .
a person who could never determine the contact with asbestos precisely is graham abbott , a general practitioner .
as andrew lawson suspects , the 50-year-old abbott , during his work in hospitals , was exposed to asbestos .
&quot; i worked in a hospital where asbestos complaints were decided positively , &quot; he says , &quot; but i cannot prove it in my case .
it is so difficult to remember all the places where people worked and the data .
what he remembers is the day in early december 2009 , when he was given a kind of fever .
he was 45 , and carried out an operation just late in the evening .
suddenly i had a frozen chest .
it came all of a sudden .
i felt terrible .
i thought that the trip home was no longer a matter of creating .
as a doctor , abbott knew that the pain was caused by the breast fur , the skin around his lungs .
but , like janice allen , he had no reason to suspect a mesotheliom .
he went to work for a month .
astonished doctors made x-ray recordings of his breast and use pleurakathether to extract fluid from the lungs and test it in the laboratory .
his complaints , however , remained undiagnosed .
his health slowly improved , and he returned to his workplace .
from time to time , however , the symptoms returned , often after exercise and vigorous breathing .
in 2011 , a patient came to abbotts with similar symptoms in his practice and was later diagnosed with mesotheliom .
but even now , abbott did not associate this with his own case .
after all , his patient was several decades older and had worked directly with asbestos .
the connection in that case was clear .
in september 2011 , abbott ’ s condition deteriorated again , and his general practitioner brought his ct scans and x-ray pictures to an expert group .
in december 2011 , exactly two years after abbott felt sick for the first time , a sony equipped with a camera was thrown into the cave between the rib and the breast fur .
i am an optimist .
i usually keep on doing , &quot; he says .
to be honest , i was not so worried .
but rachel , my wife , was concerned .
the result of the biopsy was between christmas and new year : &quot; i was told that there was mesotheliom . &quot;
graham abbott : diagnosis mesothelioma
suddenly abbott had appointments with macmillan nurses , one of whom recommended him to seek a lawyer .
only now did he see the extent of the epidemic .
&quot; it turned out that asbestos was very widespread , especially in large public buildings where pipes are often isolated with asbestos , &quot; he says .
the people who were exposed to asbestos in these buildings are now ill .
and thus mesotheliom meets younger people who have not worked in the typical professions .
the most dangerous pipes with asbestos insulation in hospitals were located below the earth , so patients were probably not exposed to the substance .
but many employees who work in pedestrian tunnels from one building to the other ( like andrew lawson ) or in underground canteens ( as is graham abbott often did ) did ) .
it is evident that , over several decades after the war , hospitals may have been life-saving for patients , but they are life-threatening for the doctors in question .
it is still being removed today .
students placed their bunsenburners on asbestos mats .
and it does not just concern hospitals .
asbestos was developed for its fabulous insulating and flame retardant properties in offices , shops , libraries and city halls .
schools too .
indeed , many people probably have had the first asbestos contact in the classroom .
throughout the country , in thousands of chemistry lessons , students have their bunsenbrenner on asbestos mats .
on web pages , the topic asbestos is now frequently addressed in schools .
and meanwhile , innocent objects have been put in our houses such as floor tiles or scrap-down houses by default .
&quot; it is an industrial poison that is contained in large parts of our properties , &quot; notes andrew morgan , the lawyer andrew lawson in his trial against guy &apos;s hospital .
in one case , the only contact that fell into a woman concerned was the demolition of a shed in the 1970s .
so make sure you tear your shed off .
the effects of diagnosis , and the knowledge that the disease is incurable , is immense .
&quot; it takes a while to process that , &quot; says graham abbott .
i went back to work and tried to continue , but i realized that i did not concentrate on what i did .
i was in practice for two weeks .
then i knew that i would go and had to take care of myself .
well , i will not see any more christmas .
the biggest difficulty was the change of perspective from a doctor &apos;s position to that of a patient .
like countless patients before him , he remembers how overwhelmed he was by all the information he had to get .
&quot; it was very difficult to take all of this in , &quot; he says .
&quot; i asked my doctor &quot; how long do i have to go ? &quot;
and they gave me about 12 months .
i remember that i thought &quot; well , i will not be another christmas .
that was then . &quot;
mesotheliom is particularly insidious because it is our life-support mechanism - the breathing itself - that causes the deadly cancer .
most cases of mesothelioma are caused by asbestos contact .
asbestos is made up of smallest fibres .
when asbestos is stimulated and the fibres are inhaled , they can be applied in the chest fur , the skin around the lungs .
asbestos fibres irritate the breast fur and can trigger cell mutations .
&quot; the problem arises with the inhaled coniferous asbestos fibres , &quot; says professor tom treasure , a heart-thorax doctor who passed to the guy &apos;s hospital in 2001 .
the hospital that andrew lawson suspects is the same as asbestos is now ironically a leading hospital in the world of treating mesotheliom .
treasure knew lawson and treated some others , who probably also worked during their training in the hospital .
once the asbestos needles reach the lung tissue , treasure says , &quot; they will be pushed to the edge from the breathing process , where the skin is .
by nature , it is invasive from the very beginning .
the usual options for other cancers do not work well for mesotheliom .
the effectiveness of an operation , for example , is highly controversial .
some say that it is worth trying .
treasure denies that .
&quot; you can &apos;t cut the breast fur out , &quot; he says .
you don &apos;t get around with the knife .
meanwhile , the cancer &quot; speaks not very well for chemotherapy , &quot; the &quot; effect shows &quot; but does not cure .
&quot; sometimes there are long-term survivors , &quot; says treasure .
but in the end they all die .
fortunately , some patients actually live long , much longer than expected .
the author stephen jay gould died 20 years after the diagnosis .
two and a half years after his own diagnosis , graham abbott is still struggling .
after contacting mesotheliom , abbott came into contact with andrew lawson , who had been a one-man support and advisory service four years after his diagnosis .
&quot; hello , cancer center , &quot; he cheerfully presented himself with calls .
&quot; he was very positive , &quot; says abbott .
he had received his diagnosis 4 years earlier and was still very active .
originally , abbott offered six chemotherapy cycles , which last four months and are expected to extend his life for only one month .
&quot; i was desperate , &quot; he says .
i wanted to give up .
however , lawson managed to &apos; make things appear in a more positive light &apos; .
after consulting several doctors , abbott decided to continue his treatment with prof. loic lang-lazdunski , cardiovascular specialist at guy &apos;s .
&quot; we had an advantage in not having to be referred back , i simply called on and got an appointment , &quot; says graham .
a normal patient would have to receive a referral and wait for the approval of the treatment .
money is crucial for mesotheliom-sufferers to be able to enjoy the best available therapies .
but if these treatments inevitably fail , many people will be left with another financial concern - about the future of families they are left with .
and so they turn to the courts in the hope of compensation .
andrew lawson contacted andrew morgan of field fisher waterhouse llp .
&quot; it has been known since 1898 that asbestos is extremely dangerous to health , &quot; says morgan .
but what changed in the 1960 ’ s was that it was recognized that a very low burden represented a health risk .
and here the negligence of companies began to play a role .
andrew lawson and guy &apos;s hospital finally brought their case to bear , but it was not what morgan called a &quot; full compensation &quot; , because lawson &apos;s was not satisfied with absolute certainty .
after the investigation into his death , a guy &apos;s spokesman confirmed that &quot; the asbestos fibres in the affected cellar area were removed in the 1990s . &quot;
this was too late for andrew lawson .
how to remove asbestos
indeed , it is difficult for mesotheliom-sufferers who seek compensation to solve a huge problem , the fatal asbestos contact of a company or a job - usually decades after the events .
many of their former employers have been sold or closed .
insurance documents can be lost .
and those who oppose claims know that time is for them , but certainly not with the lamentators .
in response to this , there have been clear new legislation this year , which makes it easier for people affected by mesotheliom to claim compensation , even if their former employers are no longer found .
the law has set up a fund of £ 350 million for all those who are going to be diagnosed after july 2012 , funded by the insurance industry , but cannot prove that they have been contacted .
in these cases , the plaintiffs receive 80 % of what a court would have been able to tell them in a normal compensation process - about £ 120,000 .
about 300 successful applications to the programme are expected each year .
andrew morgan , like so many mesotheliom-sufferers , thinks that £ 350 million was a &quot; very good job &quot; of the insurance industry .
&quot; this is a deal of insurers for insurers , &quot; he says , and suggests that this sum is a quarter of what insurers would have had to pay if the time was not over .
mike penning , then minister of labour and pension , also admitted that the law was &quot; not perfect &quot; .
but both penning and morgan admitted that , with seven deaths on a daily basis , rapid action is necessary .
&quot; people are suffering so much and need help today , &quot; said penning during the second hearing of the mesotheliom law in december last year .
at that time graham abbott was in the hands of prof. loic lang-lazdunski for 19 months .
after their first deliberations , lang-lazdunski recommended an operation that , unlike tom treasure , was expected to have a positive effect .
this was confirmed by radiation therapy and chemotherapy - a triple therapy with which long lazdunski can survive a survival rate of five years of up to 40 percent .
abbott felt stronger .
&quot; of course , that is the most important thing , &quot; says abbott .
this is always apparent in patients .
there is something that allows you to continue .
if you give up , you will be getting worse off very quickly .
in march 2012 , graham abbott underwent the operation .
at the end of august , he had left behind the last of the six chemotherapy cycles .
aftercare scans showed no sign of the disease .
then i had a scan in march 2014 .
there were several cancer spots around my chest .
i have just been 50 .
this is not life-threatening .
that is a life-ending process .
again , abbott underwent six chemotherapy cycles .
now no trace of the tumours is visible .
but the process is physically and mentally very exhausting .
you need to think about practical things - about money if i am no longer , for example , or my wife show how the boil time setting works .
if you receive bad news , you will be negative .
they must look ahead .
as the father of ellie , 16 , and tamsin , 14 , this is not always easy .
&quot; for parents this is difficult , &quot; he says .
it is difficult to know what to say and how much .
when i got my first diagnosis , i told my girl that i had a disease that i would not grow old with .
they reacted in different ways .
tamsin is very sociable and unstinting .
she told her friends and we got a lot of calls soon .
ellie was more restrained .
she did not say much .
such talks are something that all cancer patients must go through .
but for mesotheliogeneous diseases , such talks have not been conducted with hope , not with a trace of hope of survival .
the disease ( as it ultimately also brings to stephen jay gould ) fierce safety .
as andrew morgan says , &quot; mesotheliom is not life-threatening .

china denies hong kong the right to vote in government , demonstrators swear retaliation , and the government is retaliating .
on sunday , despite the increased calls for democratic reforms , the chinese parliament decided against nominating candidates for the 2017 elections by hong kong &apos;s electorate .
this approach probably fights the long-announced protests in hong kong ’ s business district , while activists are making the planning and mobilization of it within hours of the announcement .
the decision of the people ’ s chinese congress basically allows communist leaders to exclude all non-peking-loyal candidates .
&quot; this is not unexpected , but it makes us angry , &quot; said legal expert emily lau , chairman of the democratic party .
that is not what beijing promised .
the people of hong kong have been lied to .
it is clear that we are dealing with an authoritarian regime .
in defending china ’ s decision , li fei , vice secretary general of the standing committee of the national people ’ s congress , said that the approval of public nominations for the hong kong government would be too &quot; chaotic &quot; .
since 1997 , when britain regained control of hong kong to the chinese , beijing has promised to leave the people in the government presidency from 2017 .
the chinese leadership presented sunday ’ s decision as a democratic breakthrough , because it offered hong kong citizens a direct right to vote , but the decision also makes clear that china ’ s leaders must not allow it to go through through a narrow beijing nominee .
a new clause also states that only candidates &apos; with love for the country and love for hong kong &apos; should be admitted .
the decision follows a summer in which some of the biggest and most popular protests in hong kong have been held for several years .
behind the pro-democracy campaign in hong kong is the occupy central movement with love and peace , whose organisers are threatened with giving financial districts the right to close down if peking does not have a genuine general right .
on sunday evening , within hours of the announcement , hundreds of occupy centric workers had been killed in the rain before the government headquarters .
during the demonstration , the organizers said that their movement was a new stage of civil disobedience and that they planned waves of protest in the coming weeks .
they did not provide any further information on this , however , apparently in order to avoid problems with the authorities .
in an online communication , the organizers announced that the movement &quot; the occupation of the central district should only be considered as a last resort , an action that should only take place if all the opportunities for dialogue have been exhausted .
we are sorry to say that today all the opportunities for dialogue have been exhausted and the occupation of the central district will definitely take place .
the hong kong authorities have been waiting for the beijing announcement for days , and there were a lot of worries about security on sunday before the government building , including police forces and barricades .
the unrest is exacerbated by the feeling of many in hong kong that they are slowly losing control of their city .
the influx of people from the mainland is increasing competition for products and services .
there is also a growing fear that hong kong ’ s values of democracy and freedom of speech will be crumbled under growing pressure from beijing .
some criticized the occupy-central movement ’ s demonstrations , which were designed to keep the business - hong kong ’ s lifeline - at risk .
&quot; the protests you talk about could cause great economic damage , depending on how many are involved and how long they last , &quot; said legal expert regine i .
we do not want to raise fears that hong kong will get out of control .
this impression is bad for investment .
china ’ s state-controlled media recently reported about democratic activists in hong kong as being under the control of western powers .
this summer , activists organised an informal referendum on electoral rights , involving 780,000 people - more than a fifth of the electorate in hong kong .
in july , tens of thousands participated in one of the largest democratic demonstrations in the region ’ s history .
the tradition of the us school leaf balls is now being transferred to universities , where freshmen performances are offered by private aircraft .
we are looking forward to meeting this demand and to providing the first luxury travel service for students of today .
to achieve a particularly impressive appearance at the university , the company also offers transport options such as private aircraft , rolls-royce phantom , aston marten or mclaren p1 .
mr stewart also said that the service has a security division .
this service is an ideal alternative for students who otherwise want to live in a dangerously overloaded car .
together with our new vif options , we look forward to making sure that students will be able to get to the university with a minimum of effort and maximum luxury this year .
a spokesman said that no new bookings were made , as the service was only just introduced , but added that &quot; students will not receive the service in the next few weeks &quot; .
the company also announced that despite the study fees of £ 9,000 per year , it expects a market for this offer .
students today differ greatly from students 10 , 20 , 30 or 40 years ago - it is more important than ever to have a great first impression of what they want , and vif is the way to do it .
the national student union , however , criticised the service as being withdrawn .
megan dunn , vice president of the nus for higher education said : &quot; this offer seems to be completely separate from the life of most students .
many students starting this month are facing a crisis in living costs , as the available financial assistance in the form of loans and scholarships is not compatible with the soaring bills for simplicity .
feminists criticize racial and police behavior after ferguson
the unarmed teenager was arrested by a police officer in ferguson , mo. earlier this month .
the participants lifted their hands into the air and sang , &quot; hands high , not shoot , &quot; while they waited before the funeral .
after two weeks of protests in ferguson , mo , for the shooting of the unarmed teenager michael brown , the blogger miriam zoila perez noticed a change in the online world .
according to their experience , white feminist commentators put gender before race when it comes to promoting reproductive law and income inequality .
but , while tensions in the middle west have increased and received attention throughout the country , perez saw that white women ’ s responses turned 100 % around the race .
compared to the answers of black women shortly after the shots of 9 august , the personal essays with titles like &quot; thought to ferguson by a white woman &quot; and &quot; feminism revolves not only around repression .
but for perez , that meant a major change .
&quot; i do not think that feminism can find many people who know about it and enjoy privileges in such a high-class way , &quot; she said .
people felt compelled to express their views on the events .
it is characteristic of the crisis in which we find ourselves and because the situation in ferguson is so ethnically that you must express it .
for english professor koritha mitchell of ohio state university , ferguson has brought to light problems that black americans face every day , but which are not considered to be women &apos;s issues .
&quot; i can find something fun on facebook about me and my partner and get 150 likes from anywhere , &quot; said mitchell .
when i post something about how to put coloured people under siege in their own country , silence is deafening .
&quot; how can women be sure to talk publicly about a relationship , but not about security in public space ? &quot; she asked .
for black women like mitchell , the race , gender and sexuality have studied in the history of the us , there is no dichotomy between racial and gender problems .
for them , black women have not had the luxury of separating the subjects neatly ; they live every day in the combined reality .
while white women now have to deal with the issues of race and gender in the feminist mainstream circles , angela hattery , professor of women and gender research at george mason university , says that their predecessor did the opposite .
&quot; between 1865 and 1890 , at least 10,000 black men were yellow and the rape of a white woman , &quot; hattery said .
white women had to be involved in history in order to justify the murder of lynch .
for hattery , the white and black women split at the point where white fighters for women ’ s election rights , such as susan b. anthony , were the country ’ s analysts in the late nineteenth century .
&quot; they made the decision to stand up for the right to vote for women , and the right to vote for the black people should come later , &quot; said hattery .
when you remember such things , you realize with power why colored women do not trust white women .
we did not do our job well .
we have never helped black women to protect their husbands and sons .
even after women were given the right to vote in 1920 , white women had to resist lynching in the association of soy .
the group came into being almost 40 years after the original request for help from black women , says mitchell .
for mitchell , the flood of white feminist reactions to the questions raised by ferguson - police behaviour , racial discrimination - is a reflection of the time when white feminists catch &quot; feminist problems &quot; .
&quot; would it not be great if the activists who have such traditional feminist platforms had the right to educate a child so seriously as they did with the right to receive a conception ? &quot;
second generation feminists who have been pursuing their careers in the struggle for reproductive rights and access to contraceptive means are now trying to understand what that means .
the well-known white feminist activist gloria steinen went to the city two weeks after michael brown shooting and published a pointing article by rebecca steinen .
&quot; i hope that women who have a different but parallel reason to have a body inherent danger - and mean opinions about the race , which is in public opinion polls .
although steinen stands for a rather intersectional feminism in which race and gender issues are addressed , some of her comments on racial issues in america have been puzzled .
christina sommers , researcher at the american enterprise institute and author of &quot; who stole feminism ? &quot; said to she the people that young men in the united states , especially young farbians .
there are now hundreds of specific programmes for girls and young women , but almost nothing for boys .
but when the white house recently launched a small program , my brother &apos;s keeper , to help vulnerable young black and hispanic men , there were annoying reactions from many feminists , including those from women .
the police ’ s relationship with the black community is not the only problem that has become the focus of mainstream feminism .
after the us border police have killed almost 63,000 unaccompanied minors on the country ’ s southwest border this year , the issue of immigration reform is again coming to the surface - this time as a women ’ s issue .
andrea mercado , co-chairman of we belong together , an organisation that is mobilizing women for immigration reform , said that a reconsideration of the issue was essential to a women &apos;s issue .
&quot; they speak for themselves , &quot; said mercado .
if the large majority of working visas go to male immigrants , the women who accompany them are in a position where they are held for domestic violence and exploitation .
&quot; these stories are reflected in women &apos;s organisations , &quot; she said .
&quot; schweine-haus &quot; in ipswich is on sale .
the image of a house for sale was removed from real estate agents when it became clear that it showed a large pig that it had made itself comfortable in the living room .
this detached house has one bedroom , located on a private road in ipswich and is available for £ 120,000 .
the details included a picture of the living room of the house - including a pig that had his head on a sofa bed .
real estate agents connells said that the pig on the photo was the owner &apos;s pet .
&quot; the photo was erroneously published and has since been removed &quot; said a spokesperson of the company .
in the exposure of the house , connells described the former assembly house as a &quot; unique detached house with one bedroom . &quot;
although the broker has removed the image from the website , it still appears on advertising material .
the sale of houses was of interest in the social media when some asked whether the pig was included in the purchase price .

leonidas asked for a new name for the gladiatorial arena .
not only the gladiators were ankle deep in the matsch at the first rhinbach roman day in the amusement park .
but the attraction of the event was strong enough to attract over 1000 visitors yesterday who were able to meet the rainshowers and the autumn cold and to get away from the historic spectacle .
there was a colourful set of illustrations , performances , games , exhibits and information about the time of the romans and their importance to the rhineland .
the main attraction of the day was undoubtedly the martialist fighter force of the gladiatorial school &quot; amor mortis &quot; , which used every rainfall to stop in the soft sand .
gladiator owner &quot; leonidas &quot; proved to be humorous and competent presenter and sent in successive his men to the heldenic second match in various gladiatorengages .
first , the &quot; provocateurs &quot; were in line with a rectangular shield and short sword , as well as leg rail on the left leg and arm rail on the right arm .
the &quot; essedarii &quot; followed with a chest shield , short sword and throwing lance , and iron gladiator helmet , leg and arm protection .
the performance of the &quot; retiarius &quot; , which was completed with a throwing net , trizack and dagger , was particularly impressive and after a short fight the boys came to the ground .
the swords of metallic crashed , the shields of the heads and the litter lances flew through the arena , surpassing the fear and bent that could be around the health of the gladiators .
but on those had the imposing &quot; summa rudis &quot; , the muscular referee , a always attentive eye .
&quot; we wanted to revive the everyday life of rome and to make the culture of the roman era a reality , &quot; lorenz euskirchen , chairman of the organizer &quot; friend &apos;s roman channel &quot; , explained the culture .
after two years of preparation , a &quot; oppidum romanum &quot; , a roman temple , was built from the amusement park for a day , as vice mayor claus wehage stated in his greeting word .
after all , the romans have not only brought war and conquest to our region , but also roman culture and numerous buildings that we still admire today .
the remains of these were also visible during the roman day , such as &quot; aqueduct-marble &quot; from the eleven metres high and 1400 metres long roman canal bridge , which once stood in vent lüftelberg .
the frontinus society once and now confronted the water and energy supply , and managing director petra fricke knew : &quot; today we still benefit from the knowledge of that time &quot; .
this is confirmed by the diploma surveying engineer ralph heiliger from the &quot; engineering team two &quot; from rheinbach , the measuring instruments of the romans such as chorobat , groma or dioptra .
the romanesque villa in blankenheim presented sketches and models of the excavations anno 1894 as well as brick from the original hypocaste , the hot air heater , which once made the redness .
impressive also the footprints of wolf and fox two millennia ago in the footsteps of clay are impressive before they were burned .
in 2011 , the office for conservation of mineral monuments at the rheinland regional association had the remains of a roman villa excavated in the nord industrial park in rheinbach .
the walls of an economic building were covered with a darre to dry grain and to mill .
the building probably has been converted into a villa rustica , an agricultural property , the archaeologist dr. jennifer morscheiser explained .
a number of finds from these excavations were found in a glass glass glass display , including a large plate , several fine glass vessels and parts of a small necklace .
the villa was built from the first to the fourth century ad to christ , until the invasion of the germans in the then roman rhineland , presumably morscheiser .
the children also worked with the roman windmill game , similar to today &apos;s mill game , or they wrote as the roman students used to use metal grips to make their names appear on wax boards .
at the stand of the roman thermal spas zülpich the children were allowed to lay their own mosaics , bake glass mosaics at the glass museum rheinbach and at the stand of the eifel natural centre .
with the original cold-blossoming replica of roman vehicles , visitors drove through the amusement park and also came to the impressive stand of the city gymnasium , which is here .
with a roman week from 13th to 21st september , the municipality of wachtberg will also be transformed into the rhineland year of rome 2014 , which was marked by the death of emperor augustus 2000 years ago .
together with the local and historical associations and the wachtberger wander-verein , the partnership association and the laienspielkreis oberbachm , thematic hikes , lectures , cooking evenings and more .
for example , a roman legionnaire is exempted from his work on the zugliche wachtberg , plants are presented as living monuments from the roman era and a witty lesson in matters of collective warfare between peoples .
the adendorf elementary school is dedicated to the roman theme during a project week .
the roman week is intended to cover the numerous , often not at first sight visible traces of the romans in wachtberg .
the wachtberg town hall presents a small presentation to the fund of the berkumer matronenheim in 1879 .
ebola – the epidemic is a drain on west africa ’ s economy
the ebola epidemic in west africa is also a serious blow to the economy .
markets are orphaned - and international companies are distancing themselves from the market .
the devastating ebola epidemic is a serious blow to west africa &apos;s economy .
the harvest rots in the fields , the mines are abandoned and the markets orphaned - the virus has severely added to the region .
some international companies are already distancing themselves .
&quot; the ebola epidemic is not only a medical crisis , but also an economic one , &quot; judges the head of the african development bank , donald kaberuka .
liberia is hardest hit
&quot; it is a total disaster , we lose a lot of money , &quot; says alhaji bamogo , who is in monrovia &apos;s second largest market selling clothes in liberia &apos;s capital , monrovia .
only those who buy food or something to disinfect ebola will be able to buy on the market .
liberia is hit hardest by the virus , here alone the fever killed more than 600 people .
recently , health authorities said that the disease had spread to every corner of the country .
in guinea , sierra leone and nigeria , the virus has spread .
in total , more than 1,500 people have already died , thousands more have been recruited .
foreign firms are pulling out workers
throughout resource-rich countries , companies are deploying their operations .
foreign companies such as the steel company arcelor mittal are withdrawing their employees , several international airlines are no longer flying to the affected regions .
local traders and farmers are also reacting : few merchants are still leaving their homes to supply supplies .
in some areas of sierra leone and liberia , which are quarantine , the resources needed for export of cocoa and coffee crops are rotting .
farmers dare not leave their homes for harvest .
food is scarce
&quot; people will travel less and less &quot; , says phillipe de vreyer , paris expert for the economy of west africa .
for example , the man who normally goes to the market and sells his vegetables is better off staying at home .
the population is therefore being told the consequences of the epidemic directly and urgently : food is becoming scarce .
in the markets , stocks of basic foods such as rice are dwindling .
at the same time , the region , which is heavily dependent on international firms , is threatened with damage to its image , with far-reaching consequences .
the main danger is that international companies will basically avoid the area for a long time , says philippe hugon of the french think tank iris .
the decisive factor is how far and how long the virus will spread .
investors may have the impression that it is dangerous to invest in guinea , sierra leone , and liberia , and thus invest in it , &quot; hugon warns .
the disease also places a heavy burden on the states &apos; hard-pressed budgets
the disease also places a heavy burden on the already hard-pressed state budgets of the states concerned .
the rating agency moody &apos;s fears that its budgets are heavily dependent on high spending on the health system and , in addition , on the worsening economy .
the african development bank has already promised to provide $ 60 million ( $ 45 million ) to the health systems of the countries concerned .
the effects are also felt in nigeria , where so far only a few ebola cases have been diagnosed .
although the oil-rich region of the southern niger delta has not been affected .
but elsewhere , many people are already at home for fear of contagion .
reservations in hotels are also significantly reduced .
the 50th anniversary of the swiss national day of the year is a great time for the protection of the children .
the &quot; tannenwald &quot; pupils &apos; association berngau celebrates its 50-year anniversary from 12th to 14th september .
the tannenwald südzoll club is preparing for the 50-year foundation festival from 12th to 14th september .
the plan is on friday , september 12 , a great evening of entertainment with the group &quot; dorfrocker &quot; .
on saturday at 6 p.m. the big bold shooting takes place .
the evening of mood is then marked with the &quot; stoapfalzer spitzbuam &quot; in the big festival tent .
brass band creates music
highlights on sunday are the festgott service and 9.30 am in the parish church and the great fortress at 2 pm .
in the afternoon , the price distribution of the federal and gaussian shooting is also included .
the 25 festivals with their dirndln will be a particularly beautiful sight .
the chapel is the blast chapel of berngau .
the patronage has been conferred on mayor wolfgang wild and secretary of state albert füracker .
the original name &quot; protective society of tannenwald berngau &quot; dates back to 1907 when the association was founded on 21 march on &quot; social entertainment through exercise in room and small scale shooting &quot; .
the nazi regime had caused the dissolution of the association in 1937 .
only in 1964 did 19 young men find themselves again , who won the &quot; new &quot; schützenverein &quot; tannenwald &quot; berngau from baptism at the inn lukas .
karl march and adolf ried led the club as a shootmaster through a difficult initial period , in which the main aim was to find a club and to control the shooting operation .
the schützenverein in in the guesthouse &quot; leininger &quot; started in autumn 1965 with two teams in the lap competitions .
in the years to come , sports shooters , who have now been organised in seven teams , established themselves in all classes right up to the 1st gauliga .
the records of the association are pursing every year and the magical limit of 380 rings was first established by rudi meier in 1980 .
just as the performance of active shooters has increased , the number of members has also improved .
after the &quot; leininger &quot; club no longer meets the requirements of a modern shooting club , the then former executive board has decided to establish itself under the leadership of johann rinn .
after a workload of 2700 hours , on 8 may 1988 , the parish of strasser granted the church blessing for the new shooting rooms .
one of the great highlights in the history of the association was certainly the 44th gauss shooting , coupled with the solemn consecration of the new protective flag in july 1991 .
on 23 and 24 april 1994 , the südzenverein celebrated its 30-year anniversary .
in 1995 a böllergruppe was founded .
josef schmalzl became böllerberechent .
a great challenge for the &quot; böllere &quot; and for the club as a whole was the direction of the bavarian böllertreffen 2005 .
in many hours of volunteering , the club members have visited the areas and the shooting facility at the berngauer hof last year and have thus brought it up to date with the latest technology .
eleven teams in lap competitions
the sporty performances of the schützenverein can also be seen .
in total , eleven teams are currently participating in the lap competitions : six air rifle teams , a pilot air pistol team , a sports pistol kk1 , a youth team and two ah teams .
the first team with lars ellrich , katharina ellrich , steffi grad and kerstin kelermann will be in the round 2013 / 14 of the gauoberliga ( highest league b ) in schützu .
the second team with verena moosburger alexandra meier , eva schuhmann and tobias graml is from the gauliga nord to the gauoberliga .
besides the shooting , events such as bocksleeches , carnival and royal ball , club outing and christmas party have tradition .
the shooters are also present at the festivals in parish and municipality .
tony stewart will be hit by an accident on his return to the race track .

stewart already drove earlier on sunday evening after a collision with kyle busch in a wall and had to repair the right side of his car .
&quot; today i am quite hopeful of a good result , &quot; johnston said , and added : &quot; it just did not work . &quot;
not long after the second accident , stewarts wagon was loaded into the trailer and the team had packed and was ready to leave .
stewart won three nascar sprint cup races after his car dropped another driver in a race to the north of new york state .
he decided to return this week and to go to either atlanta or the next race in richmond to take a place in the pursuit .
he returned to work while an investigation into the tragic incident that led to the death of the 20-year-old kevin ward jr. , who was on the road during a race to stewart .
on friday , the authorities announced that investigations into the cause of the accident will continue for at least two weeks .
no decision has been made as to whether stewart has to face an indictment .
the three champions received a great applause when he was presented before the race .

nato will be further strengthened by the planned stationing in eastern europe following the ukrainian crisis .
nato secretary general anders fogh rasmussen said in brussels on monday that nato complies with the founding agreement of the 1997 nato / russia council .
the nato chief , however , accused russia of &quot; a sharp breach &quot; of the agreement .
&quot; today we must face up to the reality that russia does not regard nato as a partner , &quot; rasmussen says .
i can see from documents and opinions from the russian side that &apos; they see us as opponents &apos; .
stronger nato presence

merkel speaks power word : tolls will come &quot; very clearly &quot;
now the chancellor is clearly committed to this once again .
a licence for all the complicated details is not .
persistent concerns from the cdu against the toll on cars have been increasingly felt by the csu .
after the ongoing contradictions of her cdu , chancellor angela merkel has used a power word to introduce a toll on cars .
&quot; let us be clear : it is in the coalition treaty and it will come , &quot; said the leader of the party on monday after meetings of the cdu leaders in berlin .
merkel initially did not agree on a detailed model .
the black and red government programme calls it &quot; certain parameters &quot; .
federal minister of transport alexander dobrindt ( csu ) has made a proposal and work on it is now under way .
the nrw-cdu , however , insists on its no to tolls on all roads .
merkel stressed that finance minister wolfgang schäuble ( cdu ) also contributed constructively to the deliberations on a bill .
in addition to the subject , he has also talked about other ways of investing more private capital in infrastructure , such as broadband .
&quot; there is nothing special about it &quot; .
csu chief horst seehofer warned that he would not be able to use toll concepts in his cabinet against the minister responsible .
cdu bundesvize armin laschet confirmed his objections .
&quot; the coalition agreement never assumed that all the county and federal roads would be tolled , &quot; said the north rhine-westphalian cdu president .
in this respect , it is an important signal that seehofer has now announced that he will be speaking again on the subject .
resistance to the plans is also expressed by the cdu national associations of baden-württemberg and rhineland-palatinate .
the background to this is the fear that a toll will affect the local border traffic to neighbouring states .
seehofer had a very strong political position because of the toll criticism from the cdu ranks .
the left sees plans as weakened in the face of the dispute within the union .
&quot; the murks toll is dead , &quot; said party leader bernd riixinger of the &quot; new osnabrücker zeitung &quot; ( monday ) .
&quot; the toll fails the minister , &quot; dobrindt wants to impose a duty on all german roads starting in 2016 .
according to the coalition agreement , however , domestic car owners must not be subjected to additional burdens .
therefore , they should be able to achieve full compensation for tolls through the vehicle tax .
however , the model must not discriminate against foreign drivers in accordance with eu law on the grounds of their nationality .
genetic disorder often misdiagnosed
a britin says she thought about the problem of the death of a misdiagnosis for many years .
karin rodgers lived almost all of their youth in the belief that they had only a few years to live after they had been diagnosed with another disease .
she was indeed suffering from the charcot-marie-tooth disease ( cmt ) - a group of inherited disorders that had caused nerves outside the brain and spinal cord .
charity cmt uk announced that misdiagnosis is a common problem for people with cmt because so little about this disease is known .
some 23,000 people in the uk are likely to suffer from cmt , which can lead to motor disorders such as muscle weakness , an unsafe passage and crumbled toes .
patients also suffer from deafness or pain , and the disease is incurable and progressive , which means that the symptoms are more severe over time .
when rodgers was 13 , she believed that she had worked on friedrich ataxie ( fa ) - a disease with very poor chances of survival .
rodgers thought she would sit in a wheelchair before she would 18 , and die before her 30th birthday .
the mother of two children , who is 51 years old today , said : &quot; as a child i knew i could not do the same as the others .
i fell constantly and everything lasted longer with me .
i could never compete with other children roller shoes or skateboard and was often in school because of my way to go and run .
rodgers said that at the age of 13 , after several operations to relieve their achilles and stretching their feet , they saw their medical records when their doctor left the room and read that they had been leaving the room .
&quot; i felt guilty because i was curious , so i did not inspire anyone , but i went home , looked for the disease in the library and looked for it .
when i received a reply , i was shocked and panicked in horror .
i thought i could be in a wheelchair at 18 and die at 25 , and in between i would slowly lose all my abilities .
i did all this alone with me and planned my own funeral .
she said when she was 17 , she realized that her skills had not diminished as much as she had imagined , and asked her doctor .
he stood up and hugged me and said , &quot; my love , i do not think you have that , otherwise you &apos;re already in wheelchair . &quot;
i think you have something much less life-threatening .
after some genetic tests , it was detected with cmt .
&quot; when he explained to me what cmt was , i felt as if i were a winner , &quot; she said .
charity cmt uk has a cmt-awareness month to respond to this disease .
the first of these , the first of the three , was the first to be used as a fire fighter .
for almost ten years , the former military training place in munich has been closed .
yet every month , deadly ammunition is still being discovered at the heart of the swabian alb biosphere region .
the grenades are sometimes even more dangerous to be exploited locally .
a deafening blow halles the explosions over the heart of the biosphere area .
in december 2004 , the last shot of the troop training square in münsingen fell , which ended in 2005 after 110 years of military operations .
since then , the 6500 hectare area has been the heart of the swabian alb biosphere region , which is known for its 13 marked trails for hikers and cyclists .
tax burden on business people in the washington area is rising with the economic recovery
economic recovery means more customers , more sales and new jobs .
it also means higher taxes .
state and local tax regimes for domestic companies rose slightly last year , while economic recovery accelerated , so a newly published study in the past week , and firms in the washington dc region formed no exception .
companies in district , maryland , and virginia jointly paid $ 27.6 billion to government and local agencies in the financial year 2013 , an increase of 3.8 percent over the revenue of 2012 , amounting to $ 26.6 billion .
the government and local tax burden of companies rose by 4.3 % last year to $ 671 billion , compared to 3.9 % a year earlier , and it was the third consecutive year of growth after several years of decline in kenya .
government taxes rose more than local taxes to 4.3 % , according to the study conducted by the service agency .
more than half of district tax revenue , 56 percent , comes from corporate taxes , while maryland ’ s corporate income accounts for 36 percent of the income .
virginia achieves the lowest tax revenue from companies , with 28 percent .
much of the rise in tax revenues is due to a recovery in companies ’ real estate assets , say researchers , which will lead to a 3.7 % rise in real estate taxes this year after the three consecutive years of 1 % growth .
while much of these gains come from large states such as california , new york , and texas , the process seems to be true for washington .
district , maryland , and virginia jointly paid more than $ 10 billion in government and local property taxes last year , compared to $ 9.6 billion in 2012 , an increase over a year by 4.2 % .
but the apparent recovery in real estate values in maryland is not so effective in increasing government and local tax revenues , as real estate taxes are barely one-fifth of the tax revenues of companies .
companies in virginia and d.c. pay almost half of their government and local taxes in the form of property taxes .
&quot; in maryland , the following happens : a large proportion of the real estate , especially in the tax area around d.c. , is owned either by the government or by non-profit organizations that do not pay real estate taxes , &quot; said douglas lindholm .
maryland is therefore forced to focus much more on income taxes , for example , in order to be able to offer the same services that other states offer .
the recent recovery in tax revenues from companies cannot be attributed solely to the recovery of the housing market .
business revenues also seem to be recovering , according to the data .
companies in the region reported income taxes to state organizations of $ 2.3 billion compared to $ 2.1 billion in 2012 .
maryland took $ 1 billion in corporate income taxes , the highest amount in the region .
while the trend is moving in the same direction , the local tax burden on companies is not rising evenly in all three places .
the district ’ s increase was 4.3 % in line with the national average , while the rise in maryland was significantly higher , 4.9 % .
only virginia reported a lower tax rate of 4.1 % .
virginia has achieved the lowest company income in all three areas of office ( all three have fixed corporate tax rates ) , with 6 % .
the corporate tax rate in maryland is 8.25 percent and the district is relatively high at 9.975 percent .
a comparable study by the us chamber of commerce earlier this year showed that in virginia lower state and local company taxes are being demanded , and that the overall tax climate is better than in maryland .
the study did not investigate the district .
despite the advantages , virginia is under pressure from its southern neighbour .
north carolina has laws to reduce its corporate tax rates from 6.9 % this year to 6 % , the same rate as virginia , and the rate will rise to 5 % next year .
if the state continues to achieve its income targets in the coming year , this law could reduce the state ’ s corporate income tax rate by 2017 to 3 % .
meanwhile , small businesses in the washington area seem to be doing better , and they therefore pay more government and local taxes , according to the recent study .
corporate taxes , which are paid as personal income taxes by small businessmen - a transitional structure that allows most small businesses to be organized - in district , maryland , and virginia rose by 20 % last year , to 2.4 billion .
researchers say that the trend and rise in corporate taxes throughout the country is likely to continue this year , with an increase in the general tax revenue for the state and local government .
but washington may lag behind if spending cuts by the federal government focus on labor in the region .
partner town : german beer for guangzhou
hops and malt - a popular combination in china as well .
german beer has an excellent reputation in china .
frankfurt ’ s partner city in china now wants a brewery and also hopes for direct flight connections between the two cities .
german beer , brewed in frankfurt &apos;s partner city guangzhou - that is the urgent request of the officials in china .
&quot; we would be very pleased if a german brewery would settle in our city , &quot; said the vice party secretary of the south china metropolis , li yiwei , this week visiting a spd delegation .
time and again , the chinese communist party , the official of the ruling party , came to this concern of the twelf- million metropolis .
guangzhou , also known in germany as canton , is one of the richest cities in china , li .
that is why people also possessed the purchasing power to afford german beer .
the chairman of the german social democratic party , thorsten schäfer-gümbel , who led the german political delegation , said to the host that he would look for a possible partner for the project in germany .
&quot; good water is not much needed for beer : good water , grain and joie de vivre , &quot; he added at lunch with the party leader in guangzhou .
mr li is already excited about this joie de vivre , he flattered the host .
the official from guangzhou subsequently met schäfer-gümbel , but with red wine , which was served for the meal .
the chinese brand tsingtao is based on german brewing .
tsingtao beer is used according to the german purity law .
more business
a second wish of chinese hosts would be direct flights between frankfurt and guangzhou , said vice party chief li .
lufthansa had previously offered the flight , but cancelled it for economic reasons in 2012 .
&quot; it would be worth it again &quot; , the local politician was convinced .
&quot; business transactions between our two cities are growing . &quot;
at the moment , travellers should take the detour via changsha in the province of hunan , li complained .
the administration of guangdong province , the capital of guangzhou , also hopes for the flight connection .
the province ’ s vice governor , chen yunxian , made this wish clear in his conversation with the social democrats .
&quot; this is a very good idea , &quot; said schäfer-gümbel - the chinese vice minister li jinjun , an intimate connoisseur of germany , nodded in agreement .
a well-maintained partnership
the libel vice leader of guangzhou ’ s party hopes to be able to make frankfurt a partnership meeting next year .
li yiwei was already in the main , but not yet in this function .
he came into office only this year after his predecessor had left office for corruption charges .
the local party leader wan qinglian had to leave .
the actions taken against guangzhou officials are part of a nationwide campaign against party and government corruption , led by leader xi jinping with hard .
the new leader , li yiwei , had voted for an american company before his party career , which was highly unusual in the chinese communist party .
before he took office in guangzhou , he was a top official in fujian , where the vw car manufacturer built a large factory .
frankfurt is officially more than a dozen town twinning partnerships .
the connection to guangzhou , which is 9000 kilometres away , is one of those maintained by both sides , for example with a student exchange .
last year the 25-year anniversary of the german-chinese association was celebrated .
the southern chinese metropolis on the perl river is almost as strong as hessen with its economic power .
next year , it intends to produce a gross domestic product of eur 250 billion , li reported .
family of joan rivers &quot; pushes the thumbs &quot;
joan rivers has been in new york city since she was admitted to hospital three days ago ; however , her daughter has now been hopeful that the 81-year-old comic would have recovered from her illness .
&quot; thanks for your constant love and support , &quot; melissa rivers said today in a message .
we are all pushing our fingers .
her mother was , according to sources , sentenced to death on thursday after an emergency due to a heart attack in a clinic on the upper east side , yorkville endoscopy , in mount sinai hospital .
the doctors keep them deliberately seded and under close observation until they are more satisfied with their condition , which is still described as &quot; serious &quot; .
the reactions came from many quarters , including in the form of a massive online support from donald trump , montel williams and kelly ripa .
environmentally friendly vacuum cleaners and rising wages
for cars and vacuum cleaners coming into the market from today , stricter environmental standards will apply in the future .
like refrigerators and washing machines , new vacuum cleaners will be labelled on a single click of central data such as the energy efficiency of the device .
new cars are in the pollutant category &quot; euro 6 &quot; with more nitrogen oxide values .
there is also more money for scaffolding manufacturers : they receive a nationwide uniform minimum wage of 10.25 euros .
amazon buys twitch for $ 1.04 billion .
amazon just confirmed what information had reported on monday morning : the online retailer - and video producer , and a lot of other things - buys the video streaming service twitch for $ 1.04 billion ( $ 970 billion ) .
the announcement comes as a surprise , not because nobody expected twitch to take over , but because it was widely believed that youtube would acquire the company .
three months ago , it looked as if the sale of twitch to the video service of google had been decided for a cool billion , and the cooperation also seemed natural .
twitch , which was founded only three years ago as justin.tv , was launched as a general streaming service - a live version of youtube .
instead , it quickly became a platform for players who released their bravura pieces in games , a &quot; youtube for live games &quot; , according to an insider .
the twitch interface .
and &quot; let &apos;s play &quot; , a video genre in which , better to know , the ( mostly older ) games are a coat of mystery theater , are already very popular on youtube .
it is the case that youtube is often called when you want to describe twitch , so the news that youtube twitch wanted to buy was somewhat bored .
it is a mystery why the deal with youtube was not made , because the company has reportedly been prepared to pay as much as amazon .
all we know at the moment is this statement by emmet shear , president of twitch : &quot; we have chosen amazon because you are bound to our community , you share our values and long-term visions .
another secret is , frankly , the incredible success of twitch .
for snobs like me , who explain that they prefer to do sport than watch it , it is difficult to understand the attraction that presumes to watch others while playing instead of even watching the control console in their hands .
it is one thing to tell a friend about the shoulder at 3 o &apos;clock in the morning while she snakes through resident evil and something quite different to watch a spinning machine crying like he did 20 times in a succession .
you could just watch all these games now .
another problem is that many of the most popular games are now ego games , so watching can be easy without having control over the perspective of the eye a good recipe for headaches .
i admit that the rapid passages into which the roger bannisters of our electronic age have played whole games in record time are undergoing a lot of fun .
but until a game or humor is there , his twitch channel is probably not so interesting .
but what do skeptics like me know about it ?
twitch is called by 55 million different visitors per month and is the fourth largest source of internet traffic peaks .
and how exactly does amazon want to make money out of it ?
it is hard to imagine that twitch is so elegant in amazon instant video , like youtube twitch would have easily swallowed .
but twitch has something that every company would like : thousands of young men who are advertised as advertising customers .
as the chairman of twitch , shear , said , amazon and twitch &quot; both believe in the future of gaming , &quot; and the medium shows no sign of shrinkage , not even - not even .
at the hüpfburg at the burggartenfest , there was a lot going on saturday .
the organizers &apos; concept was right .
despite the strong raincasting on saturday evening , an estimated 1200 music fans came to the open-air festival in the burggarten .
at times the entrance had to be stopped .
&quot; that was annoying , &quot; said ron sem , one of the organizers .
salzwedel l light and fun .
maxim sakraj and ron sem have chosen the name amula from two spanish words .
the open air in the salzwederer burggarten is supposed to show brightness during the day and in the evening through various shows .
well , and the fun comes from alone .
this was evident on the early saturday , when the first visitors came to the open air .
the organizers promised a party for all generations .
and they succeeded .
around the power stations on the burggartenwiese , salzwedelers , as well as guests from the nearby and wider surroundings , had made themselves comfortable .
they followed the first live performances , rolled with their feet in the clock , enjoyed cool drinks - in short : pure relaxation and enjoyment were the order of the day .
and that right across the generations .
while some people are sitting on the blankets on the specially carved white sand on the beach bar , others are sitting on a quarter of the wine in the vinotheque , the young people were raging on the hüpfburg .
but the voluntary workers in the field of child make-up also had their hands full in the truest sense of the word to get rid of the crowd and create imaginative creations in the small faces .
the larger ones used the kicker tables or participated in a skateboard workshop that the goodfoot-crew from salzwedel arranged .
until the great rain came .
shortly before 5.30 p.m. he proudly pushed the visitors , especially families sought the wide and dry .
but this did not detract from the attractiveness of the festival .
&quot; more people came than expected , &quot; said ron sem , who spoke of &quot; success on the whole line &quot; .
therefore , there is no question of repeating the great party next year .
although work still needs to be done on the content and size of the event , sem made it clear in a first record on sunday in front of the popular vote .
he described as annoying that the admission had to be stopped .
obviously , the security company had been booked with too little effort .
as a result , some who had already paid did not get to the site .
the response was very good .
in a first careful estimate , the salzwedeler co-organizer spoke of about 1200 visitors who rocked in the castle garden .
there were problems with sound technology .
the hip-hop band blocks`n`rox broke their appearance unnervously .
the technicians were unable to produce a reasonably reasonable sound .
the planned shisha lounges could not be built because the tents could not be moved to salzwedel due to a tyre breakdown .
&quot; next year they will be there &quot; , says the organizer .
the first of the amula-open-air air was more than successful with the number of visitors .
and this in bad weather .
however , the organizers have made some mistakes that will be delayed for the first time , but will have to be eliminated in the second edition .
also in the social network facebook the organizers must put criticism in .
&quot; sorry , but for 12 euros you simply expected more &quot; , says melanie meier on the event page .
&quot; you have taken over a little bit of your time &quot; , says ele zimmermann at the same place .
others do not see the initial problems as closely as they might be .
i think it is very good that some people are not only tormenting stupid , but are also really trying to get something on their feet .
&quot; stephanie jenß writes to amula .
now the organizers have a year to stop these criticisms .
new radom in berkum : wachtberg ’ s landmark shrank .
this is not , as expected , the case .
instead , the ready part is waiting for the installation into the distinctive building .
the action is in the context of a major measure : almost 50 years after the establishment of the tira space observation radar , the case , the radom , is completely renewed .
the new radom is produced with a diameter of 47.5 metres slightly smaller than the old one .
the size of the camera is still world records .
the final step to complete the new case is the capping exchange of the new case .
the upper part of the old case is separated and taken with a crane .
after that , the last quarter of the new shell will be installed .
if the weather is playing , the action will take place at the beginning of this week .
participant in the ice bucket-challenge is rendered to the jaw of the pine .
isabelle roberts from the uk screamed so much as her ice-cold water was cast over her head that she could not change the bone structure of her face .
this ice-bucket-challenge went anguish .
a woman was hospitalised after she had been taken to the ice bucket-challenge so much that she could afford to take the jaw .
isabelle roberts from the uk was so much shrouded as their ice-cold water was cast over their heads that they could not control their facial structure .
&quot; the water was so cold that i shouted , and while i did that , my jaw remained simple , &quot; she said to the mirror .
ice water is shaken over the age of 20 .
isabelle roberts a few seconds before the accident
i wanted to close my mouth , but that did not work , the jaw was hasty , and then i understood that something was wrong .
my mother and sister also saw this and laughed almost in their pants , but i had to take the emergency room .
the 20 year-old from britain was sent to hospital to get rid of the jaw after taking part in the viral trend on tuesday .
the clip has become a website and a thousand times more on facebook and twitter .
the castle clubs will soon be pulling together again ?
finally , there was a constant clash between the two wolfratshausen burgundy clubs .
now the boards are thinking about possible cooperation .
as a model for the reconstruction of wolfratshausen castle , the late richard dimbath , former chairman of the wolfratshausen burgfreunde , led the project in guédelon , france .
a year ago , the climate between the castle club and the friends of the castle of wolfratshausen was not good .
so far , the positions on the history of wolfratshausen castle and possible reconstruction seemed to be very different .
now the two camps are moving towards each other : talks are to be held soon on a common approach .
the club boards torsten sjöberg ( burgverein ) and herbert piffl ( burgfreunde ) confirm this on request of our newspaper .
&quot; i have called mr piffl and suggested that we could sit down once &quot; , sjöberg says .
in his view , all members of both clubs could in future be united again .
this will enable us to see visible results more quickly .
while the friends of the castle were trying to escape the sudden death of richard dimbath until the last moment , the castle on the mountain forest was rebuilt , the castle club around sjöberg stands for &quot; opening up &quot; and experience .
herbert piffl , the second chairman of the burgfreunde , was delighted with the call , according to his own data .
since dimbaths died , he has been before the burgfreunde .
a new chairman is to be found in a general meeting in mid-september .
currently , according to the 74-year-old , the association has about 40 members .
&quot; after the death of my friend richard dimbath , we have been doing the club activities out of respect for the first time &quot; .
according to piffl , the new chairman should then go into the discussion with the burgverein .
until then , the friends of the castle could also see the mood in their group .
there is not yet a candidate for the presidency , says piffl .
&quot; but i am confident that someone will find himself &quot; .
the new chairman should be a wolfratshausen .
the tölzer wanted to work on the project &quot; but very much like to continue working &quot; .
the different positions on reconstruction are probably not going to be retained in piffl &apos;s eyes in the near future .
he honors dimbath as a missionary who always believed in the reconstruction of the castle .
two similar projects , already well advanced in austria and france , would show that this idea is not a shambles .
the high level of participation of the population and volunteers from around the world make them a tourist magnet .
piffl : &quot; i was also sceptical at the beginning .
but over time , i have become more and more convinced that it makes sense to move the project forward , that it could be a &quot; one-man &quot; feature for the fluffer city .
there is nothing else here .
moreover , the project would be supported by eu grants , visitor tickets and potential sponsors , piffl believes .
&quot; i personally do not want to throw away the idea of reconstruction &apos; , he hopes that the burgverein will perhaps make some progress on this point .
their goal of initially documenting history is &quot; important and good &quot; .
we could then look further .
clever ways to save money at university textbooks
since the cost of university textbooks is more than $ 1,000 per year for many students , the fast-second semester student matt schroeder considered a clever sparidee .
he invented a loan system for books by students of higher semester and offered nominal compensation to facilitate the resale .
&quot; my mathematics book usually costs $ 180 , but i got it for $ 10 for a semester and a chick-fil-a-keks , &quot; said schroeder , 19 , which establishes the covenant .
the books needed for the last semester would cost him $ 430 , he said .
he spent $ 120 .
the college administration informed students that on average more than $ 1,200 per year are spent on textbooks and study materials that students have different cost damping options .
online shops and creative approaches such as schroeders are increasingly the solution of choice for students .
the renting of textbooks is becoming more popular , and students can use a book for a semester , often at a much cheaper price than when buying .
neebo inc , which operates more than 250 university bookstores , announced that renting textbooks is a priority since 2011 .
surveys in the industry show that around a quarter of the books in the college bookstores were sold last spring semester , said neebos vice president tevor meyer .
less than half of all textbooks are produced by the national association of college stores in campus bookstores , according to the german association of commerce .
here is the one-time for the best deals .
buy online
some new books cost online only one-third of the price for which you are to have in the campus bookshop .
the ninth edition of &quot; calculus &quot; vno ron larwon , bruce edwards and robert hostler costs almost $ 290 , but can be ordered at the specialized retailer chegg.com for $ 99.99 .
used to buy
if you are aware of the notes of other or normal traces of use , used books are a good option .
&quot; calculus &quot; is used on chegg.com for $ 93.49 .
matt casaday , 25 , graduate student at brigham young university , says that he has to pay 42 cents on amazon.com for a second-hand issue of &quot; strategic media decisions : &quot; .
the book has been sold for $ 48 .
academics like ingrid bracey , head of the university of massachusetts at amherst college without walls , recommended students to work with their professors to determine whether earlier issues had been included .
sometimes the updates are not relevant for the seminar work .
in such cases , older spending can often be spent for a fraction of the cost of the latest edition .
besides chegg and amazon , half.com is a popular alternative for used books .
renting a car
renting textbooks is worth considering if you are dealing with them reasonably well , thinking about returning them and putting them back in the books after the course has been completed .
you can pay more than 80 percent of the costs of a newly purchased book .
a student could , for example , use &quot; calculus &quot; for a semester of about $ 20 .
find out about the terms and conditions of the business where you rent , including the fees that may apply to writing notes , support documents and other services .
the renter pay attention : if you do not return the book , the penalty may even exceed the price of a new book .
e-books
e-books are also an option rather than traditional textbooks .
sometimes these books are de facto rented by obtaining an electronic licence for a certain period of time by wholesalers such as amazon.com , chegg and barnes &amp; noble inc. .
at chegg you can use &quot; calculus &quot; for 6 months for about $ 61 .
bracey says that students in literature often find the best offers , since many classics can be downloaded free of charge today , while scientific and engineering textbooks can be very expensive .
in any case , look around .
joe gault , 29 , who will soon shoot the pepperdine law school , recommends the isbn number for price determination in books , as you can be so sure to find the right book .
and before placing an online order , gault said , you should check if the book is in stock .
he learned this lesson on the hard tour .
he bought a book that had four weeks delivery time and finally paid the full price in the collection bookshop .
why &quot; guardians of the galaxy &quot; was not a cash buff ?
&quot; the expendables 3 &quot; by sylvester stallone played less than $ 30 million of his 90 million u.s. budget , while &quot; sin city : a lady to kill for &quot; was only $ 12 million .
the camera diaz film &quot; sex tape &quot; was released on the opening weekend only 14.6 million dollars , while children &apos;s films like &quot; dragon &apos;s eyes &quot; were made easy 2 &quot; .
an article by the telegraph film critic robbie collin suggests that children &apos;s films are not of the highest quality in the films themselves .
collin called 2014 &quot; the worst year &quot; for children &apos;s films and described &quot; drachenzehmen leicht 2 &quot; as a purely &quot; functional &quot; fantasy sequel .
in films for a slightly older target group , however , it seems that the quality of the films is not necessarily the problem .
in july , entertainment weekly compared the average cinemascore-metacritic rating for each summer film start , which is between the american memorial and the american film festival .
the results are based on the opinion of the cinema visitors and film critics , and indicate that this year &apos;s film hits are equivalent to last year &apos;s filmmaking .
some commentators believe that the development of changing visual habits and the growing popularity of web streaming services like netflix is due to the development .
director jon favreau , who is currently appearing on disney &apos;s soon to be released jungle book film , said to the website hollywood reporter : &quot; i think the times are changing &quot; .
we must accept that and not try to follow the past .
unlike the weak cash outcomes of the hollywood productions , netflix has recently generated revenues of the streaming content in the us $ 1.2 billion , almost double the amount .
last summer , director steven spielberg criticised the film studios for focusing too much on film productions by comics and prophesied a &quot; core meltdown &quot; of hollywood .
in the light of the current downturn , some commentators argue that his dire prophecy could well contain a true core .
the potential cashier beatings , including avengers : age of ultron , minions , and jurassic world , which are expected to be released in the summer of 2015 , are more optimistic :
the producer of x-men , simon kinberg , described the decline in cash results recently as simply &quot; cyclical &quot; and said to hollywood reporter : &quot; next summer will be the largest summer at the cinema .
when the 2nd district table tennis club was closed a few years ago to tighten the division of the league , this is a step in the right direction .
now the german table tennis league has added an additional 3rd bundesliga to its programme .
as a result , those who have not risen have descended .
göttingen &apos;s highest team torpedo has won the first prize in the oberliga release , but it is playing only in fifth place in the coming season .
the fourth class of torpedo ladies , despite their grandiose march into the regional league , remain .
the boys and girls of torpedo start in the lower saxony league , as well as the boys of the sc weenend .
the sg lenglers and the torpedo reserve are entering the new league of associations , in the national league are not goettinger clubs .
the ttv geismar plays in the league of federations , the torpedo second in the league of the country .
what the composition looks like a better class of district is now the new district soberleague south .
here tsv seulingen , vfb lödingsen , torpedo iii , geismar , einbeck , hamenstedt , bovender sv , langenholtensen , the fc .
regional representatives of dransfeld and sc weenend play in the district sliga , in the district class of ttc ii , red-white , the bovender sv ii and the ttv teams .
güntersen , the ttc and the ttv geismar ii are here with the game .
torpedo iii and satenhausen / wöllmarshausen are starting in the district sliga .
with nine teams each , each of nine teams .
the sc weende sends his girls to the small district sliga .
the district sliga squadron of the scw boys - torpedo ii is still starting there - is not complete .
in a district class geismar , tuspo weende and the bovender sv go into the season .
in the first season of the newly founded regional association the two göttingen circular teams start with nine teams each .
in the west season , the red / white ii , bovender sv iii , laubach ii , torpedo iv and v , mtv grone , dransfelder sc ii , mielhausen .
in the east season , among others , sattenhausen / wöllmarshausen , nikolausberg and landolfshausen are playing .
the ladies kreisliga consists of sadenhausen / wöllmarshausen ii , bilshausen , hemeln , seulingen ii , tuspo weende and the sg rhume .
this is still better than in the osterode district , where there are no women teams at the same time .
it is striking that none of the six 2.circular classes should reach strength , here the innovative and revolving board will have to think again .
nato summit : first protests in newport and cardiff
at the weekend , there were protests from opponents of the nato summit in newport .

you are asking for the prime minister to resign .
the powerful military had a very strong case on sunday evening after a meeting in the army headquarters .
the communication also said : &apos; the army remains committed to maintaining the security of the state &apos; .
escalating violence has scared about military intervention , which has already been more common in the past .
the political and economic crisis that the opposition politician imran khan and the preacher tahirul qadri have been holding since independence day on 14 august .
sharif refuses to resign .
khan and qadri had called on their supporters to stay on sunday .

hütteldorfer will be ranked third in the table after second season victory .
with 2 : 0 over grödig has a bitter week for rapid on sunday a reconciling end .
&quot; victory is very liberating , &quot; said coach zoran barisic , whose team is competing with the europa league on thursday .

schrammel-dreamtor brings rapid to the winning road rapid , the second season victory has the right response to the disappointment with helsinki and is coming with a successful experience .
&quot; we wanted to show a positive reaction , &quot; said external defender thomas schrammel , who was the first to take part in the 14th minute with his magnificent leadership volley from the sixteenth corner .
&quot; i thought i had all the frustration of thursday and snorted him under the bar &quot; , said the 26-year-old smiling .
when schrammel was last released on november 13 , 2010 in a bundesliga game , it was still for ried .
the first championship meeting in the rapid dress is therefore a special memory .
&quot; for me this is something very special , i am from the young fast , &quot; said schrammel .
due to the short-term pond bless treatment of mario pavelic , schrammel moved from the left to the right defensive side and made his thing very good there too .

he deserves the gateway , he has already done some assists this year , &quot; praised barisic .
team shows character schrammel also delivered the flank to 2 : 0 by hofmann after about an hour that finally brought the decision .
the guests could have written to this effect .
&quot; thank god we have been lucky today &quot; , schrammel also noted , who was thus able to draw attention to the gap between performance and result in recent weeks : &quot; the results did not vote , but the game was always played .
barisic even found that &quot; in many games before today &quot; it was better than it was today - &quot; against &quot; the strongest team that played this season at this stadium &quot; .
the first tri-point since july 26 has therefore proved that the team structure is in a state of intact despite the setbacks : &quot; today my team has shown that it has character &quot; .
it is no less pleasing for him : &quot; we have finally played to zero again &quot; .
a lot of work during the national break also means that brian behrendt , mario pavelic , christopher dibon , deni alar and michael schimpelsberger have been exposing several cases .
&quot; we must not forget this , &quot; barisic , who has been working with behrendt and pavelic players for the last three days , &quot; said barisic , &quot; who have been very stable recently .
the intermission of the national states must therefore be used to &quot; lick wounds and gain a little in the physical sphere &quot; , said barisic , who has won five u21 selection players in his own country .
one that is probably particularly suitable for the break is captain hofmann .
he tears himself up for the team , goes over pain .
it has shown that , at this difficult time , he is a very important player for us , &quot; said barisic .
hofmann gave the game rapids before he was replaced in the 68th minute not only the structure , but also achieved the second goal .
for the 33-year-old , who finished his 350th bundesliga match , it was the first match from the game since november 2nd , 2013 ( 4 : 2 via the admira ) .
hofmann : &quot; may not believe that everything is good now &quot; &quot; we have certainly had a little luck , but at some point the luck must come back to us .
now it was high time , &quot; said hofmann .
he admonished , however , that concentrated work would continue : &quot; you must not always see it in black and white .
we have not played as badly in recent weeks as has been described .
nor can we believe that everything is good now .
he was unable to deny the importance of his role in the team .
it is a very young team , and i can help very much at the moment .
they are keeping to me at certain stages , &quot; said hofmann .
the first two weeks of the season were over , and the second was over .
he regretted the fast opposite &quot; from the magic gate category &quot; , as well as the regular nutz gate in the 40th minute , which was unjustly rejected by referee collegger .
the only criticism i can make to the team is that we are heading towards tor in some phases not being concrete enough .
we have had too few degrees on this .
internal defender maximilian karner saw it similar : &quot; it has just begun badly , but then we have found a gateway and even made a goal .
by and large , it would have been more in it .

we showed a powerful tribe in our puzzle task of the summer series &quot; my piece of rhöner luck &quot; last friday .
several of these trees are still in the district , the copy is the &quot; scourge &quot; above the village below the underwhite fountain .
a tilted footpath leads up to the 600 year old oak .
it is past couples , basalt cluster and basalt meadows .
a little bit below the bauersberg quarry , one kilometre north of the road to weisbach , there it stands .
vital looks like a natural monument , it rises above the other trees in the area and with a size of more than eight meters it reminds of an american mammoth tree .
a small buddha on a tree trunk suggests that it is a spiritual or mystical place .
but despite intensive research , there were only references to the origin of the name .
dr. wolfgang schneider has specifically consulted the bishops ’ home archive and consulted older people from unterweissenbrunn to find out what the relationship with the scourge is .
the result of his research was the rather sober explanation for the name .
thus , until about 80 years ago , the goatshepherds were to transport their animals from underwells to the laboriously rolled meadows , which were liberated from stones .
at the foot of the tree , the animal keepers exhausted by the ascent should have rest .
in the meantime , the area has regained its importance , because there are actually goatherds on meadows .
the area has also become the core of the biosphere reserve , schneider has further discovered .
when entering the stone collections , however , you should be careful , because the heat from the sun is the basalt , which is also a popular place for cruises .
a hiking trail leads from unterweißenbrunn to the tree , which is hidden a little bit .
other routes are signposted , the direction of hochrhoen is up and invite you to an extensive hike .
where is the watercastle ?
a watercastle that is sought for our next task , however , is rather rare in height .
the mirroring in the digging gives a good impression of the building , but we have some historic buildings in the district , which the building confectionery could fit with .
where is our &quot; piece of rhine-luck &quot; ?

after weeks of tug-of-war , italy ’ s premier and current eu chairman , matteo renzi , has voted against strong conservative opposition at last week ’ s eu special summit to nominate his foreign minister , federica gherica moore .
renzi , like the government newspaper la repubblica , considers the vocation of his people as favorites in government , as well as in the government team .
he also expects an impetus for his &apos; reform package &apos; in italy .
last but not least , renzi hopes that the recurring left-wing party base , which is against him , will be lifted , because mogherini will continue to support this , albeit in a more moderate way .
the conservative representatives , with president jean-claude juncker and the poles nominated as president-in-office of the council , will be , according to the prevailing opinion in rome , to achieve a political balance .
the eu &apos;s chief diplomat will be deputy president juncker at the same time .
the pending approval of the european parliament is considered to be safe .
otherwise , president giorgio napolitano would have preferred the nomination of the 41year-old politician of the ruling democratic party ( pd ) to have little &quot; important recognition &quot; of italy &apos;s role in the eu .
la repubblica is spreading optimism that the tried and tested and proven values of ambition in leading party offices for almost two decades will be able to rise to the &quot; enormous challenges &quot; .
the romans born in rome are married and have two daughters .
her career in the party began in 1996 with a phd in the youth organization of the then democratici di sinistra ( left-wing democrats ) , which was in 2008 with the catholic centre party marta martilla .
in 1999 , mogherini became vice-president of the european community organization of socialist youth ( european young socialists ) for three years .
the election to the party council of the left-wing democrats in 2001 led to the high party politics , worked in the foreign policy department , which she soon became the head of .
it occupied traditional focal points of italian foreign policy , such as the middle east , was supplemented by nato missions studies in afghanistan , in which italy is involved with a troop contingent , and maintained contacts with the social democrats in europe and elsewhere .
since 2008 she has been a member of the chamber of deputies , where she is an expert on defence and european and international affairs .
when renzi became prime minister in february 2014 , mogherini appointed his secretary of state .
if the pd today has a better relationship with the country ’ s strong peace movement , which has won more than 40 % of the party ’ s vote in the eu elections in may , then , as is noted in pd federations , ifederica .
the allegations in brussels that the new eu foreign representative has too little diplomatic experience are therefore lacking in substance , and are being confused in the pd .
in brussels , the european union is being held in a suspicious manner , particularly by poland and the baltic states , with realistic accents on the crisis in ukraine and is being described as &apos; a russian-friendly course &apos; .
it supports the operation of the pipeline south stream , which is operated by the russian company gazprom , through russian gas , bypassing ukraine directly to southern europe , which is also the case of italy &apos;s energy security .
after renzi took office as eu president in july , mogherini travelled to the country for her first state visit .
photos that they took with putin at shake hands were received with indignation in brussels , as well as that they were able to appoint the kremlin chief in october for a milan economic summit .
a total of nine young people completed their education at emz-hanauer in nabburg on monday .
among them is an azubi who has already completed a different training in the company .
in the future , the new employees will be active in four training occupations : electronics ( three trainees ) , mechatronics ( two ) , tool mechanics ( two ) and process mechanics ( two ) .
all azubis come from the district of schwandorf : tobias braun and thomas bücherl from schwarzach , stefan brickl and florian rewitzer from schmidgaden , johannes berewitzer .
the new trainees previously visited primary or secondary schools and secondary schools .
from wednesday to friday , the trainees of all the years and the instructors will be attending a team training event in oberammergau , where they will enjoy a full day hike and rafting on the inn .
the company counts 435 and 950 employees in germany .
the number of apprentices distributed throughout the years is 27 .
the socialists in france should &apos; keep their mouths and put france in order &apos; , said the main ally of francois hollande .
mr valls called on the deeply divided left to &apos; put their love &apos; to the controversial socialist president .
the president deserves respect to everyone , he deserves our loyalty , he deserves our support .
&quot; it is our duty to stay with him , &quot; he said with great applause .
as a sobering gesture , the prime minister insisted that his government should not postpone the controversial 35 hour week in france , despite strong demands for a relaxation of emmanuel macron ’ s regime , the new economic minister .
on saturday , mr hollande urged his co-socialists to &apos; join together &apos; with the government .
but christiane taubira , the minister for justice , has been pushing a stretch of sand into the wheel , at a meeting of renegade socialist members , and the socialist party criticised her for criticising her &quot; .
marine le pen , the far-right leader of the national front , mocked the socialists ’ continuing punitive struggles and said that she could not imagine the new vall ’ s government going through for more than a few months .
francois hollande is the emperor without clothes , but prince manuel valls has no , they are forced to form a new government if the old one does not even survive a summer .
&quot; and the new will not survive autumn or winter , &quot; said fräulein le pen towards supporters .
she repeated her party &apos;s call for parliament to be disbanded and said that she was confident that she would win in early elections and be ready to rule .
the ruling french party suffered a defeat in the municipal elections in march and the right-wing national front was at the eu elections in may .
a survey in the sunday newspaper journal du dimanche showed that 76 % of french people believe that the socialist group is in danger of being overrun by the end of the term .
pascal perrineau , a political scientist at sciences po university , warned that the french would quickly lose patience if the new socialist group had no improvement in the economy and the record .
&quot; there is a small window of possibilities , but public opinion must quickly feel that things are changing , &quot; he warned .
otherwise , the situation could deteriorate further .
norwegian cruise is just off a prestige cruises deal of $ 3 billion .
norwegian cruise line holdings ltd nchl.o , the world &apos;s third largest cruise operator , continues to operate advanced negotiations according to industry experts to acquire the prestige cruises international .

in 2008 apollo invested $ 1 billion in norwegian cruise .
norwegian cruise opened its doors in january 2013 .

pro-hong kong activists condemn china the day after the election .
a peking loyalty group swiftly swung the chinese flag .
the standing committee of the national people &apos;s congress adopted a framework law on sunday , which only allowed two or three candidates for the hong kong leadership election in 2017 .
all candidates must first seek majority support from a nomination committee , which is expected to work with peking-loyal members .
this decision will make it almost impossible for opposition democrats to be allowed to vote and prompted pro-democracy activists to vote for their threat .
political reform has long been a controversial issue in hong kong ; and china ’ s party leaders fear that calls for democracy will spread to other cities .
after the publication of a beijing white paper , in june , which denounced china &apos;s dominance over hong kong , democratic activists held an informal referendum on the electoral process in the special administrative region , which included a vote on the report .
lis survey is conducted by the hong kong government and hong kong ’ s chinese liaison office .
the vice-chairman of the legal affairs commission of the standing committee , zhang rongshun and the vice-president of the hong kong office and macau &apos;s office , feng wei , should be consulted during the day .
student activists announced that they would be standing in front of the hong kong leadership office in the afternoon .

putin is demanding kiev to open &quot; statehood talks &quot; with east ukraine .
russian president vladimir putin , according to russian media reports , on sunday demanded that the ukrainian government stop fighting separatists in the east and immediately start negotiations on the &quot; statehood &quot; of the country .
his spokesman , dimitri peskov , later made it clear that putin did not mean that this would be the territory of the east ukraine under the control of the separatists , but that his status vis-à-vis ukraine should be defined .
putin ’ s call to kiev ’ s government to negotiate on an equal footing with pro-russian insurgents fits in with the one he has apparently pursued since the riots began five months ago : help for separatist areas .
in an interview with the state television channel one , putin condemned the ukrainian military campaign to reconquer the rights held by separatists in the eastern regions of donetsk and luhansk , which took place in march .
the kremlin and separatists have recently declared the territory they have taken as &quot; novorossiya &quot; or &quot; neo-russia &quot; , a term that is reminiscent of the pre-revolutionary shine of the russian empire .
putin pointed out that all those who have been involved in ukrainian politicians ’ campaigns for the elections on 26 october , and while government groups are killing civilian communities in the areas that were kept by separatists .
&quot; we need to start a detailed discussion immediately , not only on technical issues , but also on the political organisation of society and the state of south-east ukraine , in order to protect the interests of the people living there , &quot; he said .
peskov said that putin ’ s reference to statehood in the context of greater autonomy , which has been held for months by kiev ’ s leadership , must be seen to address fears in russian-speaking areas .
only the ukrainian government can give the eastern regions the necessary autonomy , peskov said .
this is not about negotiations between ukraine and russia , peskov said , &apos; because it is not a conflict between russia and ukraine , but an internal conflict in ukraine &apos; .
the clarification of the kremlin speaker to correct the putini &apos;s &quot; misinterpretation &quot; underlined russia &apos;s leadership in dealing with separatist rebellion in the east , unlike the direct threat of nepotism .
moscow would have much greater difficulty in supporting the donetsk and luhansk regions in eastern ukraine , as most of the 6.5 million inhabitants are not russians and polls from the pre-conflict period are a predominance .
the autonomy that russian diplomats have mentioned in international forums would be a matter of power to regional governments in ukraine to negotiate their own trade agreements and external relations , thereby giving the kremlin de facto control over an area of russian territory .
the peninsula , annexed five months ago in the black sea , is the home port for most of the russian navy , as well as an important commercial port and historic coastal region .
the regions between the rust area in russia and the crimea are also rich in mines , factories and foundries , which are important components for the russian military .
ukrainian president petro poroshenko proposed a new approach to the problem of ukraine during his speech on june 7 .
but his idea of autonomy seems to be in sharp contrast to that of the kremlin and the separatist rebels , whose arming and incarnation is accusing moscow .
putin ’ s last call to kiev to work with separatist leaders on an equal footing followed a further push by the rebels in the past week , after russian troops and tanks had previously overtaken the soviet union .
the separatists supported by russia took on a pale bargain , which , according to ukrainian security officials , was the first step in a campaign to take over the strategic coastal region to crimea , control novoazovsky .
that is why massive civil and military preparations have begun to protect mariupol , a steel industrial port with 500,000 inhabited .
poroshenko spoke at a meeting of the eu leadership in brussels on saturday and urged action to prevent another russian aggression against ukraine , a former soviet republic , which has been under threat for 23 years .
&quot; we are on the verge of a point where there is no return , &quot; poroshenko warned .
thousands of foreign troops and hundreds of foreign tanks are now on the territory of ukraine .
the eu summit did not decide on concrete actions , the leadership demanded further sanctions against russia , which would not be possible if the ukrainian crisis escalated unspecified .
ukrainian soldiers had to move back from their positions in ilowajsk after two russian tank columns and 1,000 soldiers entered the donetsk region last week to overcome the siege separatists .
the first probably 63 ukrainian soldiers who were killed by the russian incursion in ilowajsk were killed on sunday against 10 russian paratroopers who were killed on ukrainian territory a week ago .
nude photo scandal around australian celebrities and gabi grecko
geoffrey noblest made no secret of his anger about hackers , who are likely to see naked images of his fiancée gabi grecko and a who is the a-celebrities from hollywood .
the film town is in excitement after a series of clear photos of a naked jennifer lawrence in a hacking scandal around celebrities on the internet .
the hacker responsible for this may have 60 nude photos of lawrence , star of &quot; the tribute of panem &quot; and of superstars , including the models kate upton and cara lee deluxe .
the australian actress teresa palmer , emily browning , yvonne strahovski , and grecko from melbourne supposedly also published private photos on the basis of an icloud hole .
there are 101 celebrities on the list .
the noblest who had been bowed with grecko last month said to confidential : &quot; it is disgusting . &quot;
all private letters and pictures should remain private .
it is a shame that private information has been stolen and can be passed on to others .
grecko , currently in new york , reportedly said that the hack is &quot; shameful &quot; and that the people concerned feel &quot; hurt &quot; .
the hacker probably has 30 images of palmer with her ex-friend scott speedman , including two shots in which it is up without lying in a pool .
palmers &apos; film works include &quot; love is invincible &quot; with liam hemsworth .
palmer , chuck-star strahovski and actress brown from sucker punch stood yesterday for comments on the chopped images .
a representative lawrence said to tmz : &apos; it is a heinous violation of privacy . &apos;
actors seth rogen condemned the hacker in his tweet : &quot; hacked images from a mobile phone is nothing other than selling hats .
in legal terms , the propagated stolen images should not be tolerated .
cyclists , joggers and hikers were present yesterday at the 8th cycling race on the große feldberg and supported the &quot; hilfe für krebskranke kinder &quot; association .
the tour , which was a tortuous one for one , was a very easy training for the other .
however , one was all agreed : it was fun .
thomas studanski may have slept well last night .
for the first time in his life , the head of the oberurseler brauhaus went on a bike yesterday to feldberg .
for the good cause .
he can easily remove the small muscle cap , especially since he can ride on the 8th cycling on the big feldberg in favor of the association &quot; help for cancer children &quot; ( frankfurt ) .
a great thing .
&quot; i now know that i can - fine ! &quot;
small puzzles on the way in the appleuscurve ?
but if i had stopped , i would have been out ...
as thomas studanski , who is responsible for the cdu in the upper urselle city parliament , many of the 718 participants yesterday caught up in the early morning and came close to exhaustion , but happy to teau .
others , on the other hand , found it easier to cross the well eleven kilometres long route between hohemark and feldberg .
norman diessner , for example .
the green politician from the circle - red dress , red dress , red bike - made a little more understatement ( &quot; every bit of professional , because there is arrived the goal ! &quot;
he too has gone through the course in a slide , as well as nina kuhn , press spokeswoman of the city of oberursel , who has been making his way with frank grüniron .
the &quot; feldberg cycling &quot; was not necessarily a sporty challenge for the two triathletes : &quot; this is about charity , we are happy to be there - an exit we would have done anyway today &quot; .
on the way , they met paul wenzel from oberreifenberg .
the boy ( 12 ) had gone down to oberursel in the morning to jump up the hill right after that .
the florian ornament in frankfurt had moved to the saddle at 9 a.m. in the morning , &quot; made &quot; the feldberg twice , then to roll home with fun .
also , &quot; fritten-toni &quot; had fun .
for the head of the upper urselle cult kiosk , cycling tours via feldberg are just part of this .
he had a 6,5 kilo race bike and he had been driving for 40 minutes .
a crazy event .
for this purpose - and i am happy to be there , &quot; said andreas balzke .
the sophisticated mainzer says he is a &quot; ambitious racing bike &quot; .
it must be , because it was connected with the &quot; fixy wheel &quot; , which are also racing bikes , but without circuit ...
the fact that it went up without a wheel , not only did the 20 hikers who climbed the white wall and the fuchstanz up to the summit , but also a jogger who was at a cord .
hike doctor professor volker lischke , who is equipped with his team , equipped with allrad-bully and quad , for safety , said : &quot; the kenn &quot; i from frankfurt , who trains .
the 718 participants - and thus as many as never before - had been sent into groups in the morning .
the hikers first at 9.30 am .
the first cyclists and runners followed at 10 a.m.
five minutes later , the first mountain bikers started off .
bent hansen , chairman of the association &quot; cycling on the great feldberg &quot; , gave the commands and wanted the participants a nice trip .
for next year he hopes that it will be possible to go up the road to feldberg to ensure the safety of the participants .
