re@@ member@@ ing the very american ideal of labour rights as human rights
cong@@ res@@ sm@@ en ke@@ ith el@@ lis@@ on and john le@@ w@@ is have tabled a legislative proposal to make trade unions as citizens &apos; rights .
&quot; as unions die , so do the middle class jobs , &quot; said el@@ lis@@ on , a democr@@ at from min@@ n@@ es@@ ot@@ a and depu@@ ty chairman of the progressive conservative cau@@ ca@@ us in congress .
i therefore take pride in the fact that john le@@ w@@ is , together with the civil right si@@ con , has introduced the staff authorisation act .
this gr@@ ound@@ breaking law gives workers the same legal opportunities for discrimination on the grounds of trade union organisation as in other forms of discrimination - and thus stops anti-@@ union workers .
the addition of the national labour law to provide for the organisation of trade union representation of workers who are exposed to discrimination , in order to appeal for justice before a civil court - and to obtain compensation or criminal penalties - is to be made .
but it is certainly not a radical initiative - at least not according to american standards .
indeed , the best way to understand what el@@ lis@@ on , le@@ w@@ is , and other spon@@ sors of their bill propose is to link back to a very american idea .
despite the set@@ backs that trade unions have been exposed to in recent years - in wis@@ con@@ s@@ in , mic@@ hi@@ gan and other countries throughout the country - americans have once encouraged countries around the world to recognise labour rights and to recognise them .
there was a time when millions of americans still remember when this country was a country that had democracy , freedom of speech , freedom of the press and the right of association in one bre@@ ath .
when the united states occupied japan after world war ii , general dou@@ gl@@ as mac ar@@ th@@ ur and his staff encouraged the country to adopt a constitution that would ensure that the milit@@ ar@@ ised auto@@ cr@@ acy was he@@ ir to japan .
fully aware that workers and their trade unions are playing a role in creating a new japan , they used a language that was explicitly recognized that &quot; the rights of workers on unification and common understanding &quot; and act .
when the united states occupied germany after world war ii , general d@@ wi@@ ght david e@@ is@@ en@@ ho@@ wer and his staff ur@@ ged the german@@ s to write a constitution that would ensure that fas@@ c@@ ism ad@@ ol@@ f hit@@ ler replaced a democracy .
recogn@@ izing that workers would have to organize themselves , and raising their voice in the new nation , the german@@ s added a clause that explicitly stated that they would &quot; do not have the right to form associations .
agreements that restrict or aim to restrict this right are zero and n@@ ul@@ l ; to which the objective is to be illegal .
when the former first lady ele@@ an@@ or roo@@ se@@ vel@@ t presid@@ ed over the international commission on human rights , which included the universal declaration of human rights as it was adopted by the united nations in 194@@ 8 as a global agreement .
for generations , americans have accepted the basic pre@@ mise that labour rights are human rights .
when that country told other countries how to form civil and democratic societies , americans said that the right to establish trade unions - and to do so - was a fundamental right for the union to participate in collective negotiations .
after these rights were under attack in america , it is indeed wise to re@@ consider the american ideal that labor ’ s workers should have the right to choose .
as pa@@ st@@ or martin lu@@ ther king j@@ r. said fif@@ ty years ago :
history is a great teacher .
now everyone knows that the workers &apos; movement did not restrict the strength of the nation , but increased it .
by raising the standard of living of millions of people , work has mir@@ ac@@ ul@@ ously created a market for industry and has pus@@ hed the entire nation to un@@ imag@@ in@@ able levels of production .
those who attack the work forget these simple tru@@ ths , but history keeps them .
history re@@ members , and we should do so .
the formal recognition of labour rights as human rights - and the extension of the protection of civil rights as a protection against discrimination in the creation of employee representatives - is long over@@ due .
ke@@ ith el@@ lis@@ on and john le@@ w@@ is re@@ new the ide@@ als that america has made big in the past and that have fulfilled the promise of democracy .
jud@@ ges tempor@@ arily stop law that all abor@@ tion clin@@ ics in lou@@ i@@ si@@ ana could force them to close down .
a us federal judge stopped trans@@ posing a law in lou@@ i@@ si@@ ana on sunday , from which lawyers say that it is likely to close all five abor@@ tion clin@@ ics in the state .
this measure , which was taken by bo@@ b@@ by j@@ in@@ dal , govern@@ or of lou@@ i@@ si@@ ana , in june and which came into force on 1 september , would be to allow doctors who carry out abor@@ tions to do so .
the judge &apos;s decision , however , means that doctors will continue to be able to carry out legal abor@@ tions for the time being , while requ@@ est@@ ing such a right .
&quot; the pla@@ in@@ ti@@ ffs can continue to work in accordance with the law while they strive to obtain these rights , &quot; says federal judge john de@@ gra@@ vel@@ les in his judgment .
a hearing is scheduled for the judge within a month to ensure a more lasting decision on the law .
pro-@@ abor@@ tion welcomed the decision to remove the latest in a series of jud@@ gments against similar measures and said that doctors had more time to pay hospital supplies .
&quot; today &apos;s decision means that women in lou@@ i@@ si@@ ana are es@@ cap@@ ing a dis@@ gr@@ ac@@ eful law that wants to take their health and their rights away from them , &quot; said n@@ ancy nor@@ th@@ up , president and chair of the centre for re@@ productive rights five .
it was not immediately clear whether the judgment would also affect doctors from the two clin@@ ics that the compla@@ int had not been followed and also had the right to issue an application .
lou@@ i@@ si@@ ana is one of 11 countries that have passed similar laws , with courts recently taking such measures in al@@ ab@@ ama and missi@@ ssi@@ pp@@ i for non-@@ constitutional .
key points of a law in tex@@ as that affects most of the clin@@ ics left in the state have been closed down by a federal judge on friday .
pro-@@ abor@@ tion and the american college of o@@ stre@@ tr@@ ici@@ ans and gy@@ nec@@ o@@ logi@@ sts , as well as the american medical association , agree that the inclusion of authorisation rights by doctors is unnecessary .
anti-@@ abor@@ tion oppon@@ ents are against the idea that the measures are designed to protect women &apos;s health , although some also welcomed the effects of clin@@ ics closing down .
only a doctor who has abor@@ ted lou@@ i@@ si@@ ana has patients in@@ fil@@ tr@@ ated , divided the centre for re@@ productive rights with him .
if all other doctors in the state are forced to stop carrying out abor@@ tions , that doctor would not carry out the operation for his safety , the group said .
in their arguments against the judgment , representatives of the state lou@@ i@@ si@@ ana said that they did not have to pun@@ ish doctors for carrying out abor@@ tions , while their applications for patients &apos; rights were still pending .
dela@@ yed diagno@@ sis and lack of access to the best treatment will lead to higher death rates from e@@ gg@@ s in rural areas .
angel@@ ina jo@@ lie and her brother james have received a video hom@@ age for their mother online , which was awarded a certificate of hon@@ or in 2007 .
women in rural australia face a greater risk of falling into o@@ vari@@ an cancer than they do for women in cities .
researchers analy@@ zed the medical data of more than 1@@ 100 austr@@ ali@@ ans , who detec@@ ted o@@ vari@@ an cancer in 2005 , and found that only 25 % were left on the scene five years after the diagno@@ sis .
the research director sus@@ an j@@ ord@@ an of the q@@ im@@ r ber@@ gh@@ of@@ er medical research institute said that for those living in rural and remote regions of the state , the mort@@ ality risk during the study was reduced by 20 % .
small study : new medicines could cause l@@ ung and e@@ gg@@ s cancer to slow down .
researchers examined the medical care of women over seven years .
dr. j@@ ord@@ an said that a woman &apos;s age in diagno@@ sis , the type of o@@ vari@@ an cancer , existing pre@@ dis@@ orders , and social and economic status also influenced the chan@@ ces of survival .
for older women and those whose cancer is already advanced at the time of diagno@@ sis , the survival rate was the lowest .
for those who live in rural and remote regions of the state , the mort@@ ality risk was 20 % higher than for those in urban areas .
although the study did not investigate why women living outside the city are more likely to have died of o@@ vari@@ an cancer , dr. j@@ ord@@ an susp@@ ects a be@@ lated diagno@@ sis and lack of access to the best treatment centers .
&quot; this disease is best treated by gy@@ na@@ ec@@ ological on@@ co@@ log@@ ists , and most of these are found in larger cities , &quot; she said .
despite the improvement of tele@@ health services in order to counter di@@ stances , it proposed , as a possible re@@ me@@ dy , a strengthening of the service of inf@@ ected doctors , in order to give specialists the opportunity to bring women closer to home and to home .
dr. j@@ ord@@ an said that , regardless of geo@@ graphy , the study has a poor long-term survival rate for women in o@@ vari@@ an cancer , and under@@ sco@@ red the need for better treatment and prevention strategies .
the strategy of rio t@@ into ride to con@@ qu@@ er cancer is now being published in the medical journal of australia .
in march 2013 el@@ ish@@ a ne@@ a@@ ve , a young mother of 33 years from the gold coast , learned that she had an aggres@@ sive form of o@@ vari@@ an cancer .
garden centers regret falling house owners
the decline , combined with an increase in the number of home@@ owners under 35 years of age , could lead to the loss of tens of thousands of p@@ ounds per year when today ’ s young consumers are forced to buy a new home after a study by the h@@ ta , as described in the financial &quot; .
the report states that ten@@ ants spend an average of 55 percent of the amount paid by people with homes for their garden .
the rise in people living in highly ur@@ ban@@ ized areas without gardens , the popular procedure of using sub@@ gardens for parking purposes , and the falling rate of garden are further factors that must be taken into account in the industry .
in the greater london area , which has had a 6 year share of home@@ owners increased from 61 % to 43 % , the lowest expenditure on garden products per household will be reported .
the h@@ ta and the royal hor@@ tic@@ ul@@ tural society point out that housing is for rent or small gardens does not mean that people do not have plants .
gu@@ y bar@@ ter , chief garden consult@@ ant for the rh@@ s said : &quot; contain@@ er gar@@ den@@ ers are very popular with ten@@ ants , for example , because they can take their plants with them in a move . &quot;
the h@@ ta report identified the period between 1997 and 2005 as the &quot; golden age &quot; of hor@@ tic@@ ul@@ ture retail due to rising house ownership and economic prosperity from the late 198@@ 0s to the mid-@@ 199@@ 0s .
he also predic@@ ted an improved market situation this year due to better weather conditions after un@@ favourable weather conditions in march and april of last year .
the political and economic crisis that the opposition politici@@ an im@@ ran kh@@ an and the spiritual ta@@ h@@ ir@@ u@@ l q@@ ad@@ ri have led continues .

information minister per@@ v@@ ai@@ z r@@ as@@ hi@@ d said that soldiers had taken the prote@@ sters out of p@@ tv buildings again .
the station set up its operation for about 40 minutes but is now sending it back .
at the same time , some 3@@ ,000 demonstr@@ ators tried to become prime minister na@@ wa@@ z shar@@ if &apos;s residence .
about a kil@@ ome@@ tre away they were equipped with stic@@ ks and stones cl@@ ash@@ es with security forces .

the country ’ s army is meanwhile calling for a political solution to the conflict to be &apos; was@@ ted without time and without using force &apos; .
after a meeting at the headquarters on sunday evening , the military told us : &quot; the army remains committed to maintaining the security of the state &quot; .

turkey is appoin@@ ting us diplom@@ at for es@@ pi@@ on@@ age reports
the turkish foreign ministry has awarded the country ’ s lon@@ ge@@ st-@@ serving us diplom@@ ats a report on american and british es@@ pi@@ on@@ age in turkey .
vice-president b@@ ü@@ l@@ ent said that the us emb@@ ass@@ y ’ s business operator and turkish officials had discussed the report on monday .
the german magazine der spi@@ e@@ gel and the online magazine the inter@@ cep@@ t reported that the results of the research carried out by the former us analy@@ st of the national security agency , ed@@ ward snow@@ den , show that turkey is a key area of activity .
according to turkish news agencies , turkish president rec@@ ep ta@@ y@@ y@@ ip er@@ do@@ gan has played a key role in the report and said that all the major countries are playing on each other .

police chief of mag@@ alu@@ f accused of corruption
the prosecu@@ tors sent a letter to the office of the public prosecu@@ tor of mall@@ orca on friday to prove that the police and staff of the city of cal@@ vi@@ à were black@@ mail .
the head of the police of cal@@ vi@@ à on the island of mall@@ orca was arrested after acc@@ us@@ ations of corruption by business@@ men and bar@@ -@@ owners in the not@@ ori@@ ous b@@ ing@@ e-@@ drin@@ king@@ -@@ hot@@ spot mag@@ alu@@ f .
main commissioner jo@@ s@@ é ant@@ oni@@ o na@@ var@@ ro was arrested by several business@@ men in pun@@ ta b@@ all@@ ena , the street , following corruption charges against him , where most bars and night@@ clubs of mag@@ alu@@ f are located .
according to the online newspaper mall@@ orca di@@ ario , the prosecu@@ tors gave the office of the prosecu@@ tor for the fight against corruption in mall@@ orca evidence of black@@ mail by police and employees of the city of cal@@ vi@@ à on friday .
two other local police officers were arrested by the spanish civil guard in connection with the corruption charges .
the spanish national daily ab@@ c reported that the an@@ gr@@ y night club owners said that the ve@@ t@@ ter@@ n@@ ity of the authorities had serious consequences for their business .
&quot; it is no longer about making money , it is about survival , &quot; said one of the business@@ men to the court .
let our live@@ li@@ hood be lost .
we have nothing to lose .
mag@@ alu@@ f made a huge difference this summer due to a vir@@ al you@@ tube video , which featured an 18@@ -@@ year-@@ old british tourist who was on 24 men during a s@@ na@@ p tour .
the island authorities have since tried to prevent the illegal behaviour of alcoho@@ lic holi@@ day@@ makers in mag@@ alu@@ f by reducing the number of participants in the not@@ ori@@ ous drinks .
the play@@ house club , where the fel@@ la@@ ti@@ o incident took place , was forced to close for one year , while play@@ house and the k@@ nei@@ p@@ ent@@ our@@ -@@ organis@@ er car@@ n@@ age together paid a penalty of € 5@@ 5@@ ,000 .
mag@@ alu@@ f , a tourist resort that attrac@@ ts young british tourists , is also popular for many accidents involving alcohol .
the first spring day with we@@ t and stor@@ my weather conditions affects flights from ade@@ la@@ ide airport .
the spring has brought a winter surprise to southern australia , with strong sho@@ wers and strong wind , which makes flights from the airport ade@@ la@@ ide har@@ der .
in the evening until 9 p.m. another 5@@ mm rain fell on the city , after 6.@@ 6@@ mm , which had already fallen in the night for sunday .
the last ra@@ inf@@ all was the result of a series of short , stor@@ my sho@@ wers , including a ca@@ st-@@ iron that began shortly before 20 o &apos;@@ clock and caused almost 4@@ mm of pre@@ cip@@ itation in about 10 minutes .
after last week ’ s winter has provided an early spring do@@ se , temperatures in the city fell again on monday to a high of only 15@@ .@@ 8 ° c .
the bad weather conditions have probably led to the dela@@ yed lan@@ ding of a flight by vir@@ gin airlines from mel@@ bour@@ ne to ade@@ la@@ ide .
the plane should have lan@@ ded shortly after 7.@@ 30 p.m. , but was hit by a j@@ ag@@ ged wind - a su@@ dden change in the wind speed or direction over a short distance - and had to get through .
at that time , wind@@ sur@@ fers reached about 50 km / h at the ground at ade@@ la@@ ide airport .
the flight data showed that the aircraft could also take off on a second lan@@ ding flight and finally came up at about 8.@@ 40 p.m.
the flight delay has led to delays in some other flights , including an em@@ i@@ rates flight from du@@ ba@@ i and a qu@@ ant@@ as flight from sy@@ d@@ ney .
for ade@@ la@@ ide , a maximum temperature of 16 ° c is predic@@ ted on tuesday , with possible sho@@ wers .
mat@@ thi@@ as says : it is high time to network large numbers of people .
given the g@@ lar@@ ing technical progress that has made our cosy home in high-@@ tech swit@@ ch@@ gear stations , the new technology is becoming more and more exciting .
while i write this here , my view of the spir@@ al cable that connec@@ ts the list@@ en@@ er to the phone , and i think : bo@@ ah , how re@@ tr@@ o is that ?
but there is a thought behind this : if the cable were not , all list@@ en@@ ers would be able to fly around in the house without a hit@@ ch , and that would be much more re@@ tr@@ o .
the fact is that the ec@@ lec@@ tic ( ec@@ lec@@ tic ?
no , ty@@ po@@ s : electronic sector the rule that the world nov@@ el@@ ty today is the electric sc@@ ra@@ p of tomorrow , bought - out@@ dated .
and if you still have a tv set in the living room today , you simply say that you are opposed to television .
why these considerations ?
because the pressure from the i@@ fa at the radio tower has once again brought us our absolute in@@ competence in electronic matters this week .
the lay@@ man , who used to be a washing machine and cd player , blin@@ dly does not even understand the purpose of the devices that are being used with in@@ comprehen@@ sible expert pres@@ ses : &quot; connect &quot; .
yes , is it still possible ?
what should we talk about with people who apparently volun@@ tar@@ ily spread such quar@@ k ?
in fact , for some 20 years now , the main thing is that we should like to network our house .
to make the yo@@ gh@@ ur@@ t order itself , the fire alarm on holiday in the mal@@ di@@ ves tells us that it is burning in the working room .
and would it not be wonderful if we could have air conditioning on our arrival in the near future ?
yes , but this requires air conditioning .
but a dream will certainly come true soon : we lift our watch , say your voice !
wrong .
everything amounts to nothing less than a revolution : &apos; the boundar@@ ies between white and brown goods are bl@@ ur@@ red &apos; , a con@@ no@@ iss@@ eur of the industry , you can use a washing machine to connect the head@@ phones with a head@@ phones that are connected .
we also know from daily practice that if a new fashi@@ on@@ able device is really needed , the battery is guaranteed to be empty .
another reason is that the spir@@ al cable on the phone will survive the next radio exhibitions .
israeli children return to their schools after the war in gaza .
thousands of israeli children from the areas near gaza returned to israel on monday .
the launch of the school brought the missi@@ le laun@@ cher communities in the south of israel a sense of joy and expec@@ tation , but the signs of fighting are still fresh .
in the southern city of ash@@ do@@ d , employees of the &quot; pas@@ ho@@ sh &quot; kin@@ der@@ gar@@ ten , who was hit by a ro@@ cket , before the students arrived gran@@ ate sh@@ ards from the walls and sho@@ ot .
&quot; we are a bit afraid , but are ex@@ ci@@ ted , &quot; said ron@@ it b@@ art , resid@@ ent in ki@@ b@@ but@@ z sa@@ ad and there english teacher .
many children from our area urgently need a return to a rout@@ ine .
her 1@@ 1-@@ year-@@ old daughter sh@@ ani b@@ art said it felt &quot; a bit fun@@ ny &quot; , suddenly back into school .
&quot; these were difficult times , and we did not leave the house at all , &quot; she said .
president re@@ u@@ ven ri@@ v@@ lin visited the ki@@ b@@ but@@ z near the border with gaza to offer his support .
until a ce@@ as@@ e@@ fire stopped last week ’ s war , thousands of residents of border communities such as sa@@ ad left their homes or homes to live in sa@@ fer areas further away from gaza and escape the missi@@ le .
many inhabitants of na@@ h@@ al o@@ z , a municip@@ ality near the border with gaza , where a four-@@ year-@@ old boy was killed by a palestinian mur@@ der@@ ous g@@ ren@@ ade , are still re@@ luc@@ t@@ ant to return .
the ministry of education announced that a do@@ zen or so families had not yet returned .
their children have been tempor@@ arily accommo@@ dated in other schools .
prime minister bin@@ y@@ am@@ in net@@ any@@ ah@@ u attended a school in s@@ der@@ ot , a border town with gaza , which is heavily hit by the palestinian fire .
he called on the children to learn a lot and said &apos; we will ensure that their knowledge is acquired and provide you with security &apos; .
israel and hamas agreed last tuesday on an open-@@ ended ce@@ as@@ e@@ fire .
the ce@@ as@@ e@@ fire brought about an immediate end to the fighting , but important issues remain un@@ resolved , as hamas ’ call for the lif@@ ting of the isra@@ eli@@ -@@ egyp@@ tian bloc@@ k@@ ade of gaza and the re@@ opening of the a@@ e@@ h@@ za .
israel is calling for the dis@@ arm@@ ament of hamas and for the transfer of the bodies of two israeli soldiers killed in the fighting .
a new round of indirect talks is expected to begin in egypt later this month .
in the war , more than 2,@@ 100 palestinians were killed , three-@@ quarters of them civili@@ ans , and at least 4@@ 94 children were killed according to estimates by the palestinians and the un .
israel den@@ ies this information and estimates that at least half of the killed are figh@@ ters , but did not provide any concrete evidence of this information .
on the israeli side , 66 soldiers and six civili@@ ans , including a th@@ ai work@@ er , were killed .
hamas and other gaza figh@@ ters fi@@ red 4@@ ,@@ 5@@ 91 missi@@ les and mor@@ tar sh@@ ell@@ s during the fighting on israeli cities , most of them in the south .
meanwhile , the israeli military carried out more than 5@@ ,000 air and other attacks .
the israeli attacks damaged or destroyed thousands of homes in the gaza area and some 2@@ 50@@ ,000 people were seeking refu@@ ge in more than 100 un schools that had been converted into temporary shel@@ ters .
while tens of thousands of people continue to live in the shel@@ ters and the fighting continues , the education authorities postpon@@ ed the beginning of the school year last week .
&quot; i hope the school is re@@ opened soon so that we can continue to learn , just as the children in the world and the jewish children , &quot; said mo@@ ham@@ ma@@ d am@@ ara , a 13@@ -@@ year-@@ old boy who is currently in a city .

berlin - according to c@@ du@@ -@@ bun@@ des@@ vi@@ ze thomas stro@@ b@@ l , the ongoing prohibi@@ tion proceedings against the n@@ p@@ d should be brought to an end before the federal constitutional court .
&quot; the n@@ p@@ d is doing worse than last time , &quot; said stro@@ b@@ l , who is also c@@ du head of state in bad@@ en-@@ w@@ ür@@ t@@ tem@@ berg , the &quot; le@@ ip@@ zi@@ ger vol@@ k@@ s@@ ze@@ it@@ ung &quot; .
this is a welcome development in the right direction and a development which will allow me to conclude that the n@@ p@@ d is being fought politically and not before the constitutional court .
the n@@ p@@ d was very close to the fifth % hur@@ dle when the vote on sunday .
a first attempt to ban the far-@@ right party was a failure in 2003 , because the protection of the constitution was also in@@ for@@ man@@ ts in the n@@ p@@ d top .

har@@ burg : t@@ ents for new refugees
refugees are now being placed in t@@ ents at the new countries .
the initial central reception for refugees in harb@@ burg bur@@ sts out of all se@@ ams .
now the internal authority has set up three red cross t@@ ents next to it .
the district politicians were only informed shortly before - they are not very enthusi@@ astic .
&quot; these ha@@ ir@@ uck actions further fuel public reservations and do not give district politicians a chance to participate construc@@ tively in the human@@ e housing of refugees , &quot; says brit@@ ta her@@ r@@ mann , fr@@ at@@ tion@@ ist .
your party demands that the district administration of harb@@ ur@@ g currently use un@@ used houses for accommodation .
96 refugees can be accommo@@ dated in the three t@@ ents .
reasons for the over@@ crow@@ ding in the initial reception are the on@@ slau@@ ght of aid see@@ kers - and the fact that the authorities do not provide enough places in follow-up facilities .
many refugees therefore remain longer than the regular three months .
house prices have experienced the strong@@ est winter rise in seven years , shows a widely observed index .
the r@@ p data co@@ re@@ logic he@@ don@@ ic home value index for homes in the austr@@ ali@@ an capital increased by 1.@@ 1 percent in august , according to monday &apos;s r@@ p data .
this increase has brought the overall increase to 4.@@ 2 % in june , july and august , the biggest increase in the winter months since 2007 .
the annual price increase was 10.@@ 9 % , more than twice the increase in the 12 months to august 2013 , but the increases were not the same as the country .
the research director of r@@ p data , ti@@ m law@@ less , said that sy@@ d@@ ney and mel@@ bour@@ ne had a two-@@ ti@@ er market .
the r@@ p data figures show that the house prices in sy@@ d@@ ney fell by 16@@ .@@ 1 % last year , in mel@@ bour@@ ne by 11.@@ 7 % .
the following markets are ade@@ la@@ ide , br@@ is@@ ban@@ e and dar@@ win , where prices have increased by 5 and 6 % on average .
at the other end of the scale lies can@@ ber@@ ra , which has been hard hit by cuts in government spending , and where prices have ris@@ en by only 1.@@ 4 % over the year .
mr law@@ less also said that spring is now beginning to be the beginning of the next few months , and that the number of properties on sale will rise , which will &apos; put a real test &apos; on the market .
&quot; if you take into account the constantly high rate of au@@ ction prices , a generally fast sales rate and the constantly low interest rate environment , it is likely that the home@@ -@@ price prices in the next three months will continue to rise . &quot;
in an opinion to the new press , he contradic@@ ts statements by the managing director pe@@ er med@@ au and at@@ tests to this &quot; as a fel@@ d@@ her@@ r &quot; to position .

the med@@ au family was already &quot; ver@@ b@@ ally informed about the request of the university in mid-@@ june .
the statement that the plans were not announced until july is definitely wrong , &quot; p@@ ö@@ tz@@ l says .
at the same time , it points out that the plans are not &apos; pre-@@ established or even decisions &apos; , but &apos; preferences &apos; .
the extension of the narrow road leading up to the castle is also less dramatic than the med@@ ina fe@@ ared .
the hotel was , and still is , a nine metr@@ e long road .
at the present time , we are talking about 5.@@ 50 metres , which is a metr@@ e wider than before , &quot; explains p@@ ö@@ tz@@ l .
the argument of the me@@ dau@@ -@@ operators that their free and scho@@ ol@@ -@@ free parking spaces will only be used by students of the university in future is not valid .
the hotel is not located at all because , like other public parking spaces , this can be solved intellig@@ ently .
the residents of the area are thinking of
the ber@@ g@@ w@@ ich@@ tel children ’ s na@@ tivity scene , which is located on the premises , and which would lead to the entrance to the park dec@@ k on its do@@ or@@ step , says the president of the university , &quot; will not be affected &quot; .
rather , he suggests that &apos; this is not just about the cr@@ è@@ che , but also about the residents of the est@@ uary of the fried@@ rich@@ -@@ stri@@ i@@ b-@@ stra@@ ß@@ e and the 800 students of the neighbouring secondary school .
so it is much more than a question of the special interests of mr med@@ au , &quot; p@@ ö@@ tz@@ l said .
whether the criticism of the parent &apos;s advisory board of the child &apos;s cri@@ b , by extending the road would be one of the few natural spots in co@@ burg lost &quot; is justified , &quot; the reader can decide for himself &quot; .
in early october , p@@ ö@@ tz@@ l , together with the state building authority b@@ am@@ berg , intends to inform the city counc@@ ils about the development of the university by 2020 &quot; and , in this context , to address the importance of the new development &quot; .
pe@@ er med@@ au had the parents of the children &apos;s na@@ tivity last week informed about the plans of the university .
the new parking dec@@ k will not be accessible via the camp@@ us and fried@@ rich stre@@ i@@ b-@@ stra@@ ß@@ e , but via the me@@ dau@@ -@@ berg .
this would have to be a two-@@ lan@@ e narrow road , which is about a kil@@ ome@@ tre long .
according to med@@ a &apos;s sco@@ res , traffic in the park of ho@@ hen@@ f@@ els castle would increase ten@@ -@@ fold .
there are about 2000 vehicles daily .
the city has not yet w@@ ished to comment on the project .
g@@ land@@ or@@ f is reti@@ ring from hand@@ ball national team .
hol@@ ger gl@@ and@@ or@@ f will no longer play for the d@@ h@@ b team .
the 3@@ 1-@@ year-@@ old of the bun@@ des@@ lig@@ ist s@@ g fl@@ ens@@ bur@@ g-@@ han@@ de@@ wit@@ t caused health problems in the first place .
i did not find it easy to make a decision , it has been mature for several months .
it is time for me to listen to the signals of my body and to pursue my career in the national team , &quot; said the 2007 world champi@@ on at his fac@@ e@@ book page .
it therefore has a record of 16@@ 7 country games and 5@@ 76 goals for germany in international reti@@ rement .
because the thro@@ wing away ro@@ ck@@ -@@ solid back player is the champi@@ ons league winner from fl@@ ens@@ burg for several years to go hun@@ ting go@@ al@@ ke@@ eper , he is now on the side of the new bun@@ de@@ stra@@ iner d@@ agu@@ r si@@ g@@ ore .
with the ic@@ el@@ and@@ ers , who on tuesday took his k@@ ad@@ er for the swiss national games , gl@@ and@@ or@@ f introduced a &quot; long and good con@@ vers@@ ation .
his ideas and approaches have inspired me as much as they have been to my long-@@ time co-@@ players and my success@@ ors .
but for my club i would like to be available in the coming years healthy , for which longer reg@@ ener@@ ation periods are necessary , which do not allow the current double burden .
the left hand hand@@ ler had a bad name in 2012 after a he@@ el inf@@ ection .
due to ach@@ ill@@ es ’ problems , he had been taken over by team doctors from the german hand@@ ball association ( dh@@ b ) with a cor@@ tis@@ one injec@@ tion which later caused a strong infl@@ am@@ mation .
an emergency operation and two other operations followed .
then , g@@ land@@ or@@ f had announced a compla@@ int against the team doctor , the dispute ended with a comparison .
twelve years of professional and ele@@ ven years of national team career do not pass any tr@@ ace of a body .
i have some health services that i can no longer ignore .
after the three inf@@ ec@@ tion-@@ related foot operations that took place in 2012 , i have experienced no real effect on my blood pressure .
this is accompanied by some other we@@ ar@@ -@@ related complaints .
i noticed at the beginning of the year that i am ste@@ ering my head , but i cannot dec@@ ei@@ ve my body , &quot; explained g@@ land@@ or@@ f in the interview to the magazine &quot; hand@@ ball time &quot; .
for a com@@ e@@ back , he would only be available in absolute emergency .
&quot; if all the str@@ ings te@@ ar , i am always ready to talk , &quot; the two-@@ fold family father told the specialist magazine .
however , i can still play hand@@ ball years at one hand .
i must also say that after my long stay in hospital in 2012 , i also became quite hum@@ ble in terms of my health .
after my career , i would like to be able to go straight to some extent .
in addition to the 2007 world cup and the 2010 champi@@ ons league win , he won the 2008 ( h@@ s@@ g n@@ ord@@ hor@@ n ) and 2010 ( t@@ b@@ v le@@ m@@ go ) e@@ h@@ f cup .
in 2012 , he also secured the european cup of the cup winner with fl@@ ens@@ burg .
german economy contrac@@ ted by 0.@@ 2 percent in the spring .
the crises around the world have b@@ ligh@@ ted the german economy in the second quarter .
gross domestic product fell from april to june 20@@ 14 , compared to the prior quarter , by 0.@@ 2 % .
this was shared by the federal statistical office and thus confirmed preliminary calcu@@ lations .
consumption alone revi@@ ved the economy in the spring , while investment dec@@ lined .
foreign trade , too , slow@@ ed down the economy .
thanks to the strong start of the year , a total gdp plus of 0.@@ 8 % for the first half of 2013 is achieved .
hor@@ st@@ mar was the starting point and the goal of the &quot; m@@ ün@@ ster@@ land@@ -@@ mo@@ o@@ i@@ ste &quot; , which led for the first time through the city of bur@@ g@@ man@@ n@@ s@@ stadt on sunday .
the city of hor@@ st@@ mar was in@@ ju@@ red in a dutch inv@@ asion on sunday .
the largest cycling association in the netherlands , n@@ t@@ f@@ u , ho@@ sted the so-called &quot; m@@ ün@@ ster@@ lan@@ de mo@@ o@@ ist &quot; .
it is the largest cycling tour across m@@ ün@@ ster@@ land , the cycling paradise near the netherlands .
more than 1000 participants than@@ ked you for your registration at jo@@ s ter hu@@ er@@ ne for organis@@ ing this tour through the m@@ ün@@ ster@@ land .
this tour was offered to interested parties in various trade magaz@@ ines .
we come from the her@@ oes and we went over@@ night to participate in this tour .
we would like to get to know the m@@ ün@@ ster@@ land in a more specific way , &quot; the cy@@ cli@@ sts were delighted to see the route through the districts of ste@@ in@@ furt , bor@@ ken and co@@ es@@ fel@@ d .
after registration at the club of the sch@@ ü@@ tz@@ en@@ bru@@ der@@ schaft sta .
k@@ ath@@ ar@@ ina went on a small &quot; peace trip &quot; through the city across the wall , where the start was also made .
the route , which was adver@@ ti@@ sed for three different categories , was then led towards her@@ ren@@ hol@@ z over the sch@@ ö@@ pp@@ inger berg in the direction of co@@ es@@ fel@@ d and via ha@@ vi@@ x@@ bec@@ k and b@@ ill@@ er@@ bec@@ k back to hor@@ st@@ mar .
on routes of 95 kilometres with 1@@ 17@@ 5 metres of al@@ titude , 120 kilometres with 14@@ 75 metres of al@@ titude and 14@@ 5 kilometres of 17@@ 75 metres of al@@ titude , the cy@@ cli@@ sts proved their good condition .
they were taken to ha@@ vi@@ x@@ bec@@ k and b@@ ill@@ er@@ bec@@ k on the way .
the main organiz@@ er jo@@ s ter hu@@ er@@ ne and may@@ or &apos;s depu@@ ty he@@ in@@ z l@@ ö@@ l@@ fing showed themselves very pleased with the success of this cycling event .
we are satisfied and it was a wonderful experience for all concerned .
the organization went without problems and there were no negative inci@@ dents , &quot; he@@ in@@ z l@@ ö@@ l@@ fing conclu@@ des this event .
unfortunately , not as many participants as the organiz@@ er had hoped , which probably was due to bad weather forec@@ asts and early weather forec@@ asts .
&quot; we are looking back in 20@@ 15 , hopefully in good weather on 30 august or during another weekend , &quot; but nevertheless promised the cy@@ cli@@ sts to return to m@@ ün@@ ster@@ land and the organis@@ ers plan to re-@@ run the bike .
con@@ stan@@ tin w@@ ec@@ ker &apos;s un@@ scr@@ up@@ ulous honest mem@@ o@@ irs
it is actually more philosoph@@ ical than bio@@ graphy , which is what kon@@ stan@@ tin w@@ ec@@ ker , song@@ maker , paci@@ f@@ ist , political acti@@ vis@@ t , ex@@ -@@ de@@ tain@@ ee , in &quot; mon@@ k and k@@ ri@@ e@@ ger 2@@ 20 .
not chron@@ o@@ log@@ ically , but more thought sc@@ ra@@ ps for thought have been given to the new munich re ( born 1 june 194@@ 7 ) .
and he is completely honest : from on@@ ani@@ e as a gy@@ m@@ na@@ si@@ ast to sho@@ p@@ lif@@ ting and drug use he does not leave any human weak@@ ness .
also , to show how he himself toler@@ ates the treatment of his fellow human beings .
ab@@ str@@ act but even more important terms are also used in the room : love , soul , e@@ go , being in now , spirit@@ u@@ ality - all of this he tries to get to the bottom , to very personal , but also to be .
and he also explains his paci@@ f@@ ism , his social criticism , his political commitment - and also how he has influenced not only music ( the opera fan was appointed soul and rock music player ) , but also his own personal commitment .
the latter has also given the le@@ be@@ mann kon@@ stan@@ tin w@@ ec@@ ker a new name to the as@@ ke@@ tic mon@@ k , which origin@@ ates &quot; by sub@@ tr@@ action &quot; , as he says , &quot; leaving everything out of necessity &quot; .
there are also short an@@ ec@@ d@@ ot@@ al doc@@ tr@@ ines between all the high-@@ min@@ ded views : about b@@ ats in a g@@ is frequ@@ ented loc@@ ally or a ma@@ d car ride , where he is a real driver .
he is completely honest about this .
len@@ ny hen@@ ry : my father never took me into the arm .
has never said &quot; i love you !
hen@@ ry was one of seven children of a jam@@ a@@ ic@@ an family of immigrants in du@@ d@@ ley in the mid@@ lands in 195@@ 8 .
his father , who died when hen@@ ry 19 was working in a factory and their relationship was limited .
hen@@ ry is trying to get a com@@ edy , ru@@ dy &apos;s rare records , some of which were based on an imag@@ inary con@@ vers@@ ation with his father , and was born on radio 4 .
the sound@@ track is a mix@@ ture of reg@@ ga@@ e and ra@@ p , with lively me@@ lo@@ dies .
but hen@@ ry had to work through some difficult child@@ hood moments .
he visited &quot; many &quot; therap@@ ies after the death of his mother , and hen@@ ry is refl@@ ecting on his relationship with his father .
it was difficult to know him .
you never saw his face , only heard his voice : &quot; listen to the cr@@ ash .
leave your si@@ ster in peace .
make a difference !
i want to look at cr@@ ick@@ et .
my older bro@@ thers se@@ y@@ m@@ our and hil@@ ton - who had already grown up when i was a child - went to the pu@@ b with him and talked about things like the shape of beer glass or the beauty of a cr@@ ick@@ et .
i never had such a con@@ vers@@ ation with him .
much of my life he was this serious type in the corner that read the newspaper .
hen@@ ry recently opened a foun@@ dry in du@@ d@@ ley , and although the conditions are better than those of his father , he gained an insight into how life was for him .
it is now a little bri@@ ghter , but they are dark , smo@@ ked , deep stylish lab@@ y@@ r@@ in@@ ths with fl@@ ame p@@ als and smo@@ ke and much so@@ ot .
my father used to just put himself in the bath and then one could hear him slowly as he started sing@@ ing because he was the foun@@ dry of himself .
when i was around there , i realized that he had done so for years to prepare the food .
however , hen@@ ry grew up as a child without his parents ’ love stories .
my father never hu@@ gged me , he never said &quot; i love you &quot; .
only when my mother went badly towards the end of her life did we start , &quot; i love you , i love you , i love you &quot; to say .
through his own daughter tr@@ il@@ ee , with da@@ wn fren@@ ch , he was able to share the love he had missing as a child .
could you start with the &quot; i love you &quot; ?
stop hu@@ gging me !
pap@@ a , i am 22 !
with da@@ wn french .
why should we not be friends ?
she is a great mother .
it is still a fren@@ ch friend with whom he married for 25 years .
da@@ wn is a good person .
why should we not be friends ?
she is a great mother .
hen@@ ry &apos;s own mother was a di@@ abe@@ tic .
this contributed to their death .
so when i became very , very over@@ weight and showed symp@@ t@@ oms of di@@ abe@@ tes , my doctor said &quot; you must be radical .
so i did this fitness and had to make a dr@@ astic di@@ et to reverse the symp@@ t@@ oms .
it is very difficult .
and it is ex@@ hau@@ sting .
nobody li@@ kes to eat car@@ ro@@ ts .
hen@@ ry ’ s career shift may be reflected in his elegant , short cut be@@ ard .
since he was cri@@ tici@@ zed for his o@@ th@@ ell@@ o , he has been cap@@ tured by the theatre .
the com@@ edy of the mis@@ understand@@ ings followed , and then f@@ ences of august wil@@ son .
this is a different experience from sit@@ com@@ s and com@@ e@@ dies that have developed their busy working life .
he began at just 16 years when he worked in a factory .
a d@@ j discovered him on stage when he im@@ it@@ ated people and wrote about him on new faces .
his television career began in the mid-@@ 197@@ 0s , &quot; i was the only black im@@ it@@ ator / com@@ edi@@ an on television for a fairly long time . &quot;
he learned at work .
i had to be big not only in the eyes of the public , but also from 197@@ 5 to 198@@ 5 , learn how to become an efficient wit@@ ze story machine while watching television as a star , and that was really difficult .
len@@ ny was born in 197@@ 5 in new faces
since his manager won the stage right at the black and white min@@ stre@@ l show , a light entertainment program , in which the people &quot; black &quot; had to paint .
i was very un@@ comfortable with my family .
i would like it to be something that never happened , but i do not regret that i did .
it was a strange , un@@ pleasant position for me , but i worked on giant projects and learned how to work with a large audience .
but this &quot; years of awar@@ d-@@ winning light pillar of british television &quot; was also a &quot; gro@@ te@@ s@@ que par@@ o@@ dy of black people . &quot;
by introducing figures that have influenced both british black culture and celebr@@ ation , hen@@ ry worked in the eigh@@ ties on a new alternative com@@ edy circle .
the first series of len@@ ny hen@@ ry show was broad@@ cast in 198@@ 4 , and in the 199@@ 0s he was among others as the ch@@ ef , gare@@ th black@@ lock , in the com@@ edy series ch@@ ef !
advertising , docum@@ entary films , tv series and film roles shaped his next decade , but after his bb@@ c series len@@ ny@@ hen@@ ry@@ .@@ tv 2008 he thought : &quot; what is you doing next ?
after that , a docum@@ entary series for radio 4 was released , entitled what &apos;s so great about ... ?
the first episode was about sha@@ kes@@ pe@@ are .
i was totally aller@@ gic to sha@@ kes@@ pe@@ are .
i never really learned anything about him at school and thought him to be a middle class domain , white in ti@@ ghts , and a very com@@ b .
so i was very afraid of it .
all of us inter@@ viewed for the show , peter hall , tre@@ v@@ or n@@ un , adri@@ an les@@ ter , ju@@ di den@@ ch said &quot; you should try it out .
don &apos;t do it badly if you don &apos;t know what you are talking about .
take a few words into your mouth , and then you will understand why we all sha@@ kes@@ pe@@ are so dear .
hen@@ ry made 20 lines from o@@ th@@ el@@ los last speech for the docum@@ entary and he was enthusi@@ astic .
i felt i was able to do that .
it was almost as if someone had put my head on the right .
&quot; that is what it is about , it is a serious thing , take it seriously , learn your text , search a little .
the sam@@ ples were brut@@ al and i read this piece for months before we did it .
and it was a success .
they seemed to expect a car accident , and that simply did not happen .
and soon he appeared in the com@@ edy of the mis@@ understand@@ ings .
suddenly i was in the national theatre and i could hardly believe it .
there was a moment when i thought &quot; o@@ h , you changed . &quot;
there was a technical error , and hen@@ ry felt inst@@ inc@@ tive that he had to enter@@ tain the audience .
&quot; a small voice told me &quot; you must now bridge 10 minutes while you are repa@@ iring the computer . &quot;
instead , the stage manager announced that the performance would continue as soon as the problem was solved .
i went from the stage and anything in me said &quot; o@@ h thank god &quot; .
i am not responsible for that .
i can leave that to someone else .
&quot; you play in a play , so stay in your role . &quot;
hen@@ ry in f@@ ences at the du@@ ch@@ ess theatre
the text for f@@ ences learning was challenging .
pan@@ ic is very good , which strength@@ ens the tend@@ ers .
that was good too , so it is like a great shi@@ eld of the go@@ ds who say to me &quot; that is your dest@@ iny here &quot; .
he says this , of course , with a th@@ under@@ ing voice .
so i will stick to that .
i really love that .
i love to be in a sample room .
hen@@ ry still has the head of a com@@ edi@@ an - our con@@ vers@@ ation is full of hum@@ or@@ ous out@@ breaks , while he always im@@ it@@ ates people .
i decided not to make a stand@@ -up com@@ edy because i think that this type of immediate satisfaction is from a room full of str@@ ang@@ ers some@@ how dangerous .
if you look at it all the time , you will see a wall .
i sometimes appear live in the apo@@ llo if i want to , but overall i don &apos;t have as much as i did before .
i ask him if he ever wants to make a stand@@ -up com@@ edy tour again .
the fun i have in a room with a director who helps to make a beginning , a middle section and the end of a journey - i do not think i ever want to give up this again .
so is this his new inc@@ ar@@ nation ?
i think so .
i am happy to be an actor .
it is fun .
one always tells a story , and that is great .
i love stories .
people love stories .
hu@@ th@@ i re@@ be@@ ls are bloc@@ king streets in y@@ em@@ en ’ s capital city
in the conflict between shi@@ ite hu@@ th@@ i re@@ be@@ ls and y@@ em@@ en@@ i ’ s government , hu@@ th@@ is have become civil dis@@ o@@ be@@ di@@ ence in the capital , san@@ a@@ a .
hu@@ th@@ i sup@@ porters would have occupied central streets in san@@ a@@ a on monday , said a hu@@ th@@ i party spo@@ kes@@ man , &apos; ans@@ ar allah &apos; .
the access to parliament was also bloc@@ ked .
y@@ em@@ en@@ i media report a traffic j@@ am in the capital .
according to the online edition of the newspaper &quot; y@@ em@@ en post &quot; , hu@@ thy leader ab@@ dul@@ m@@ ali@@ k al-@@ hu@@ th@@ i had called for action on sunday evening .
according to the sheet , hu@@ th@@ i threatened another es@@ cal@@ ation of the conflict if his demands were not met .
shi@@ ite hu@@ th@@ is are fighting for more independence from sun@@ ni@@ -@@ governed y@@ em@@ en and demanding the re@@ sign@@ ation of the government .
the people of hu@@ th@@ i have been be@@ sie@@ ging the y@@ em@@ en@@ i capital for almost two weeks .
about 30@@ ,000 re@@ be@@ ls have protest camps on the main access roads of san@@ a@@ a .
the surrounding area is full of bloo@@ dy batt@@ les with the y@@ em@@ en@@ i army .
ken@@ ya regi@@ sters officials to contain &quot; g@@ host workers &quot; .
ken@@ ya has begun to register all state officials bi@@ ome@@ tr@@ ically to recru@@ it &apos; g@@ host workers &apos; from government sal@@ ary lists .
employees who do not register in the next two weeks would no longer pay for their work was a government notice .
the government susp@@ ects that thousands of people will still be re@@ mun@@ er@@ ated after they have left the public service .
president u@@ hur@@ u ken@@ y@@ att@@ a promised , when he took office in 2013 , to combat corruption in the public service .
at the beginning of this year , it was found that at least $ 1 million ( £ 7@@ 00@@ ,000 ) per month in payments for &apos; g@@ host workers &apos; and other ab@@ u@@ sive financial practices were lost .
the government susp@@ ects that sal@@ aries will continue to be paid to accounts after a person has died or left the public service , says wan@@ y@@ ama che@@ bu@@ si@@ ri for the bb@@ c from the capital na@@ i@@ rob@@ i .
all officials will now have to appear at identification centres in the next two weeks to ensure that their data on bi@@ ome@@ tric regi@@ stra@@ tions are recorded , and a government message has been sent .
all those who would not do so without a credible exc@@ use would be removed from the pay list were still in the communication .
&quot; this approach has made a significant contribution to ra@@ tion@@ alising public service by identi@@ fying the actual number of officials and also by improving the pay list at both levels of government - thus &quot; g@@ host workers &quot; are being elimin@@ ated .
the scand@@ al surrounding the art consult@@ ant hel@@ ge ach@@ en@@ bach will be brought before the court for the first time on 11 november .
five he@@ irs to ber@@ th@@ old al@@ bre@@ cht , son of al@@ di founder the@@ o al@@ bre@@ cht , demand a civil trial at the d@@ üs@@ sel@@ dorf district court of 19@@ .@@ 4 million euros for damages from ach@@ en@@ bach and two of his companies .
that was shared by a court spo@@ kes@@ man on monday .
the ple@@ a says that ach@@ en@@ bach had a lot of experience in buying works of art and classic cars and that ber@@ th@@ old al@@ bre@@ cht paid higher purchase prices .
this also made the commission more than it had been agreed .
ach@@ en@@ bach has earned valuable items for al@@ bre@@ cht for € 12@@ 1 million .
children need roots and w@@ ings
he was in school for 44 years , 23 of them as head of school .
from this time man@@ f@@ red rich@@ ter knows many pe@@ ter@@ sha@@ us@@ en@@ er and k@@ ol@@ l@@ b@@ ach@@ er from their time as students .
his methods were sometimes un@@ conventional , but always supported by his desire to see the human being in the student .
the snow@@ k@@ op@@ pe is the most famous mountain in the giant mountains .
man@@ f@@ red rich@@ ter lo@@ ves the painting with the mo@@ ti@@ f from his home .
jud@@ ges was born in tr@@ au@@ ten@@ au / north bo@@ hem@@ ia in 19@@ 30 , today tr@@ ut@@ no@@ v .
after four years of secondary school he was already interested in the teacher &apos;s profes@@ sion .
one year later , the su@@ de@@ ten german@@ s were ex@@ propri@@ ated .
within half an hour the family had to leave their house .
after a few months in a ware@@ house , it went to bav@@ aria in 194@@ 6 - in the g@@ ü@@ ter@@ wag@@ on .
so jud@@ ges dro@@ ve to the upper fran@@ con@@ ian village of s@@ enc@@ ken@@ dorf .
the teacher was educ@@ ated in b@@ am@@ berg .
man@@ f@@ red rich@@ ter had to walk ten kilometres to the ne@@ arest station six times a week , take the train to b@@ am@@ berg , drive three kilometres across the city to school and return to the evening .
after two months , man@@ f@@ red rich@@ ter got a new sleep at a re@@ d-@@ kre@@ u@@ z home in b@@ am@@ berg : together with up to 15 co-@@ pu@@ pil@@ s in a dor@@ mit@@ ory room .
in 195@@ 1 , he made the first and in 195@@ 4 , after three years of teaching assi@@ stant , he became the second state exam@@ in@@ ator .
as ob@@ er@@ fran@@ ken had no free teacher &apos;s office for him , he moved to ob@@ er@@ bay@@ er@@ n and came to school in k@@ ol@@ l@@ bach on november 1 , 195@@ 4 .
the &quot; m@@ ä@@ u@@ le@@ in-@@ zim@@ mer &quot; was his first &quot; working apartment &quot; in the school building .
in 195@@ 8 , he moved to the newly built teacher house next to the school , where he had a three-@@ room service apartment .
this house bought man@@ f@@ red rich@@ ter in 1980 after the school had been dis@@ solved in k@@ ol@@ l@@ bach in 196@@ 8 .
until then , in k@@ ol@@ l@@ bach , the pe@@ ter@@ sha@@ us@@ en-@@ k@@ ol@@ l@@ bach school association had three classes and five in pe@@ ter@@ sha@@ us@@ en .
from the 196@@ 8 / 69 school year , these were re@@ constructed in pe@@ ter@@ sha@@ us@@ en in the current town hall .
when the school association in@@ der@@ s@@ dorf was founded , only the primary school remained in the place .
to avoid a down@@ grade in the now smaller school , the then rec@@ tor geor@@ g si@@ g@@ l moved to kar@@ ls@@ fel@@ d - and man@@ f@@ red rich@@ ter became his success@@ or .
but pe@@ ter@@ sha@@ us@@ en grew , and so the children and their teachers were able to obtain the current building , which was built in 1997 after judge &apos;s reti@@ rement .
man@@ f@@ red rich@@ ter comm@@ ends the un@@ complicated gener@@ os@@ ity of the then may@@ or lu@@ d@@ wi@@ g g@@ ö@@ tz , who additionally built a workshop at the municip@@ al costs and in the expansion of 1997 cel@@ lar rooms , although this was not built according to the guidelines .
&quot; may@@ or g@@ ö@@ tz was very scho@@ ol@@ -@@ friendly &quot; , jud@@ ges re@@ mem@@ bered grateful .
in his entire career , man@@ f@@ red rich@@ ter never for@@ got the speech of a government representative who was waiting for a department of a school council on law and justice : &quot; you must never forget love &quot; .
&quot; children must be given two things : roots and w@@ ings , &quot; said the 8@@ 4-@@ year-@@ old today .
and he had to learn : &quot; it doesn &apos;t always work &quot; , whether he means only his students or his own six children , is not entirely clear .
in any case , jud@@ ges do was sometimes un@@ conventional .
when students checked , they did not get criminal work from him and were not don@@ ated to re@@ side .
at the expense of the community , jud@@ ges had given up two pair of bo@@ x@@ ing glo@@ ves and let the two oppon@@ ents compete against each other , even if there should be a ve@@ il .
jud@@ ges used to have a good relationship with the then may@@ or lu@@ d@@ wi@@ g g@@ ö@@ tz ( c@@ su ) as rec@@ tor for the benefit of the school .
he moved the non-@@ par@@ tis@@ an judge after his reti@@ rement to be the last to be listed on the c@@ su list for the municip@@ al council in 1996 .
but jud@@ ges were elected to sixth place and joined the c@@ su .
18@@ 0 kilometres in three days
hr@@ 4-@@ rad@@ tour 700 bi@@ kers are in the spa park of bad salz@@ haus@@ en and sch@@ ot@@ t sto@@ po@@ vers a stop point for a ride .
if cy@@ cli@@ sts are riding in bad salz@@ haus@@ en or sch@@ ot@@ t on their tour , that is not a special thing in itself .
on friday , however , the number of people who are stop@@ ping on the bike left the impression : the 700 participants of the hr@@ 4 cycling tour and accompan@@ ying tro@@ ss enjoyed a break in the lower spa park of bad salz@@ haus@@ en and later a party under the open air .
under the mo@@ tto &quot; cycling and celebr@@ ating on new paths discovered between ni@@ d@@ da and k@@ ini@@ g &quot; , the participants met in bad vil@@ bel on thursday and had a concert by van ba@@ ker &amp; band there .
on friday , the cy@@ cli@@ sts took the first stage , which cros@@ sed 60 kilometres over fl@@ or@@ stadt to bad sal@@ in@@ haus@@ en and then further to sch@@ ot@@ ten .
in bad salz@@ haus@@ en , the athle@@ tes were led by may@@ or han@@ s-@@ peter s@@ eu@@ m , who was co-@@ founder of the bike in bad vil@@ bel and the director of the self-@@ drive bad sal@@ t@@ haus@@ en , pe@@ tra sch@@ wing .
the whole world was filled with good things to refres@@ h body and mind : the land@@ women from ran@@ stadt and ni@@ e@@ der@@ -@@ mo@@ ck@@ stadt had 85 plates of apple , wh@@ ite@@ -@@ col@@ lar , sc@@ at@@ tered and other cre@@ am@@ y .
&quot; such ca@@ kes can only ba@@ ke rural women &quot; , p@@ raised a particip@@ ant from au@@ len@@ di@@ eb@@ ach , while he ordered another piece .
at the be@@ verage stand of the s@@ cour@@ -@@ ni@@ d@@ da gy@@ m@@ na@@ si@@ um cold refres@@ h@@ ments were obtained .
the du@@ o bra@@ vo enter@@ tained the visitors with well-known me@@ lo@@ dies from o@@ pe@@ re@@ tt@@ a and musi@@ c@@ als and har@@ ves@@ ted enthusi@@ astic applause .
the park was very nice and relaxing .
a gentle@@ man also enjoyed a head massage from his partner : &quot; he deserves , after all he has already left off today &apos;s cy@@ cle@@ -@@ cha@@ ins &quot; .
meanwhile , the may@@ or and the manager of the company had to work : they were bur@@ ied at the foun@@ tain in front of the drinking spa house of re@@ porter ra@@ iner jan@@ ke and took the opportunity to listen to the radio for bad house .
also head of promotion to@@ bi@@ as h@@ agen , since the first hr@@ 4 cycling tour in 2004 , was able to run short , since he had plenty of technical experience on site .
his pic@@ k@@ up tr@@ uck , where he was able to use three phones and a radio station with his staff and the 15@@ -@@ person motor@@ cycle rela@@ y of the police h@@ ess@@ en , fac@@ e@@ book entries .
&quot; most of the participants come from the r@@ hin@@ e-@@ main region , &quot; he said , &quot; but also from gi@@ e@@ ß@@ en or ful@@ da , lau@@ ter@@ bach or the ta@@ un@@ us and even from numerous cities in western val@@ le .
the number of participants is a bit dependent on the available over@@ night accommodation capacities .
in category i , participants are accommo@@ dated in hotels , in category ii in group accommodation .
the cy@@ cli@@ sts had a good impression of the spa when they left after a hour and a half : &quot; ch@@ ick@@ en ! &quot;
&quot; it was nice in bad salz@@ haus@@ en ! &quot; w@@ av@@ ed to f@@ are@@ well .
after arriving in scotland , the group was allowed to take a short break .
but in the evening the cy@@ cli@@ sts were required to enjoy the id@@ yl@@ lic al@@ te@@ bur@@ g@@ park .
under the direction of the sch@@ ot@@ ten@@ er ges@@ ell@@ schaft für tour@@ is@@ m@@ us und stad@@ t@@ marketing ( g@@ ts ) the park had a beautiful fe@@ st@@ am@@ bi@@ ente and of course , it had delicious ba@@ k@@ eries , for example fl@@ ame ca@@ kes with well cool@@ ed fea@@ ther white fea@@ ther .
may@@ or sus@@ anne sch@@ a@@ ab , g@@ ts managing director mark@@ us ho@@ ß@@ fel@@ d and chairman of the m@@ sc@@ -@@ chairman wol@@ f@@ gan@@ g wag@@ ner@@ -@@ s@@ ach@@ s in his capacity as executive board member of ad@@ ac h@@ ess@@ en-@@ thur@@ in@@ gia .
the three showed themselves very pleased with the &quot; many factory in scotland &quot; .
d@@ j to@@ bi@@ as h@@ agen then released the dance stage .
the opportunity to move freely in the open air was given a chance to do so despite the active activities on the bike .
among the guests were increasingly citizens , attrac@@ ted by the good mo@@ od as well as the great crow@@ d of cy@@ cli@@ sts .
on the second day , the cy@@ cli@@ sts had the stations bir@@ stein , w@@ ä@@ ch@@ ter@@ s@@ bach and bad or@@ b - including a concert with the tren@@ k@@ wal@@ der@@ n - on the programme .
yesterday , after 18@@ 0 kilometres of cycling , athle@@ tes met again in bad vil@@ bel .
do@@ z@@ ens of turkish police officers are being arrested for &quot; con@@ spir@@ acy &quot; against the government .
in total , 33 police officers were arrested in turkey for susp@@ ecting the &quot; con@@ spir@@ acy against the government &quot; .
the police authorities did not comment directly .
among those arrested , 14 senior police officers , including hur@@ ri@@ yet daily , report news .
some of them were involved in corruption investigations against government officials , including four government ministers last december .
in july , a number of turkish police officers were arrested for sup@@ pos@@ ed@@ ly setting up an organised criminal association and ta@@ pping telephone numbers .
turkish president rec@@ ep ta@@ y@@ y@@ ip er@@ do@@ gan ( who was then prime minister ) described their actions as part of the activities carried out by the islam@@ ist cl@@ er@@ gy fe@@ th@@ ul@@ la g@@ ü@@ l@@ len against him and other persons .
not all children in ukraine are returning to school
schools throughout ukraine opened on monday ( september 1 ) after the summer holidays .
this day is tradi@@ tionally an important day for families , and like thousands of ukra@@ inian parents , prime minister ar@@ sen@@ i@@ j jaz@@ en@@ ju@@ k brought his daughter to school .
he told waiting journalists that not all schools had re@@ opened , but that he was determined to open the country for future generations :
september celebra@@ tions were not held in every school .
the sky is not peaceful everywhere above ukraine .
we must fight for a peaceful sky .
the whole of ukraine , a huge common ukra@@ inian people &apos;s front , must fight for a peaceful sky .
ale@@ k@@ san pa@@ stu@@ k@@ how , school director of the school in sla@@ v@@ jan@@ sk , who visited jaz@@ en@@ ju@@ k &apos;s daughter , spoke in russian .
we hope that peace will finally be restored and that children will receive an education that will be useful to them in their future lives .
the first day of the new school year is tradi@@ tionally celebrated , with the children we@@ aring em@@ bro@@ ide@@ red shir@@ ts , holding bal@@ lo@@ ons in their hands and giving flowers to their teachers .
with r@@ ona fair@@ head , the bb@@ c may have found the great director it needs .
it meets with a proud to@@ w@@ ering to@@ w from the banking world , media management , and the inner circle of the tory party .
and it has its own front experience .
her career began with the worldwide management consulting company ba@@ in and co . , upon which she was appointed to mor@@ gan stan@@ ley , bom@@ ba@@ di@@ er , ic@@ i and the media world of pe@@ ar@@ s@@ ons .
for seven years she was chairman of the financial times board and re@@ signed when the parent company pe@@ ar@@ son was appointed to a younger male .
their compensation was alle@@ ge@@ dly close to £ 1 million .
their political ran@@ king is also sound .
she was appointed david camer@@ on by lord brown , former chairman of b@@ p , when he sought more priv@@ ate@@ -@@ sector knowledge in wh@@ ite@@ hall : she was appointed advis@@ or to the cab@@ in@@ et .
her hus@@ band is a former tory council member .
as early as may , i described the role of the chairman with a po@@ is@@ oned chal@@ k .
not only is the bb@@ c at the heart of public life , as a huge and complex entity , but there is also an internal par@@ ado@@ x in its structure .
confidence has two sides : in@@ war@@ dly , the first guard of the bb@@ c ’ s own management hier@@ arch@@ y , but also ou@@ tw@@ ards as the voice of public concern and un@@ rest when things go wrong .
this creates an almost un@@ ten@@ able du@@ o@@ po@@ ly that demands full reform .
but which new chairman would risk coming to the meeting , be@@ ating on everything and disman@@ t@@ ling an institution as complex as a chinese dy@@ na@@ sty , while at the same time perhaps looking after his own job .
it is a difficult task .
and as if that were not enough , many are also interested in reducing the bb@@ c - making money , and getting status out of date .
as competition approaches and new technologies bring old , comfortable col@@ lateral to the fore , the forthcoming negotiation of the roy@@ al@@ ties for the bb@@ c is associated with particular dangers .
for the modest sum of £ 14@@ 5.@@ 50 per year , the british public is buying into what is certainly the world ’ s largest media company .
the bb@@ c is telling a good story : it says it has reached 96 % of all house@@ holds , each of which costs only 40 p@@ ence per day .
and it seems that the bb@@ c is rising again on the popul@@ arity scale : 53 % support it today , compared to 31 % 10 years ago .
the visual and usage hab@@ its of the bb@@ c have changed : i get news head@@ lines on my mobile phone today and see missed programs later on my i@@ player .
but she remains a very be@@ loved and significant institution .
it needs a considerable chairman - i hope she has found it .
per@@ ry from tex@@ as says that low@@ ering t@@ we@@ et was not authorized .
a t@@ we@@ et from the official account of the republic@@ an govern@@ or of tex@@ as , ric@@ k per@@ ry , on sunday contained a con@@ des@@ cen@@ ding re@@ mark about the democratic district prosecu@@ tor , who was at the center of a political situation .
the t@@ we@@ et was subsequently deleted and replaced by another per@@ ry account that used the previous exp@@ ir@@ ation .
a t@@ we@@ et has just been sent from my account , which was not authorised by me .
&quot; i don &apos;t approve the t@@ we@@ et and i deleted it , &quot; said it in the later message .
per@@ ry staff did not respond promp@@ tly to requests for comments .
although the t@@ wee@@ ts of per@@ ry ’ s official account were exp@@ ired , it was not clear who actually served the feed .
in the former t@@ we@@ et an un@@ favourable picture of the district prosecu@@ tor of tra@@ vis county , ros@@ em@@ ary le@@ h@@ m@@ berg , was drawn , which was published in april 2013 due to dr@@ un@@ ken@@ ness at the tax .
per@@ ry ve@@ to@@ ed financial support for her office when she refused to resi@@ gn , leading to an indic@@ tment of per@@ ry - the possibly 20@@ 16 presidential term - that could be a presidential candidate .
the text of the t@@ wee@@ t reads : &quot; i do not always go dr@@ un@@ k with the three possible alcohol levels ... but if i do , i compla@@ in govern@@ or per@@ ry .
i am the most dr@@ un@@ k democr@@ at in tex@@ as .
le@@ h@@ m@@ berg ’ s office was not in charge of the investigation of the grand jury against per@@ ry .
this was done by michael mc@@ cr@@ um , a special public prosecu@@ tor from san ant@@ oni@@ o , who was chosen by a republic@@ an judge .
per@@ ry ple@@ ads not guil@@ ty and called the charge a political tr@@ ick .
his high-@@ class team of legal coun@@ sel requested a legal coun@@ sel from the judge charged with the case to reject the indic@@ tment and argu@@ ed that the law that was used against the most senior govern@@ or in the country .
per@@ ry stopped $ 7.@@ 5 million of government funds to the public integrity unit of the state - which was set up in trav@@ is county and is in cases of state corruption in tex@@ as .
this ve@@ to has caused a public compla@@ int from a lef@@ t-@@ wing wat@@ ch@@ dog group .
per@@ ry &apos;s official user account is frequently updated - and sometimes famous .
after atten@@ ding i@@ ow@@ a ’ s election assemb@@ lies , during his 2012 presidential candi@@ d@@ acy , per@@ ry went to spec@@ ulation that he would stop .
ber@@ ke@@ ley once again declared housing market &quot; normal &quot;
one of london &apos;s most prominent buil@@ ders pointed out that the housing market in the south-@@ east of england has returned to normal levels of &quot; returning &quot; .
homes in the capital were very much in demand and were subject to huge price increases , which the bank of england has been unable to do due to widespread fear of a credit bu@@ b@@ ble in june .
ton@@ y pi@@ d@@ g@@ ley , founder and chairman of the executive board of the high-@@ class construction company ber@@ ke@@ ley said on monday : &quot; since the beginning of the current financial year , the market has again been at normal transaction levels since 2013 .
the london housing market was well posi@@ tioned during the down@@ turn , as foreign bu@@ yers pus@@ hed into the capital .
according to the cat@@ a@@ sters &apos; office , the prices in the city area alone rose by 18@@ .@@ 5 % last year , far more than the average increase in england and wal@@ es in total .
the average selling price at ber@@ ke@@ ley ’ s private , cheap and student offers rose by about one-@@ fifth in the past year , and rose by £ 4@@ 23@@ ,000 at the end of april .
however , a stronger p@@ ound has created real estate ownership in london less attractive to foreign bu@@ yers in recent months - some of them have also been weak@@ ened by the introduction of new property taxes and political rhe@@ tor@@ ic about a possible &quot; villas tax &quot; .
the london real estate agent fo@@ x@@ ton war@@ ned last week that the mort@@ gage market report for april , which included a sharp rise in credit and mort@@ gage l@@ ending , was in the second year .
new data from the bank of england on monday showed a decline in mort@@ gage l@@ ending in july , which also indicates that the housing market is cooling .
h@@ amp@@ tions international , another real estate agency , correc@@ ted his forec@@ ast for the rise in real estate prices in london for 20@@ 15 down to 3 % , based on a already weak@@ ening house price consci@@ ousness .
the volume of transactions in the most expensive parts of london , such as ch@@ el@@ sea , may@@ fair and ken@@ sing@@ ton has now fallen by a quarter per year , according to the bro@@ ker wa ell@@ is .
however , the desire for a home in the capital of ber@@ ke@@ ley is a bl@@ essing , as the amounts due for fu@@ tures sales amount to more than £ 2.@@ 2 billion .
mr pi@@ d@@ g@@ ley added : &apos; demand for the right , well-@@ planned product at the best locations remained stable and as a result , the sales of fu@@ tures remained stable . &apos;
in june , the company reported that there were 3,@@ 7@@ 42 new homes sold in the year until the end of april - almost a third more than the peak of 2007 before the crisis .
annual pre-@@ tax ear@@ nings rose by 40 percent to £ 2@@ 80 million ann@@ ually , sales rose by 18 percent to £ 1.@@ 6 billion .
in a communication on monday before the company &apos;s annual meeting , mr pi@@ d@@ g@@ ley said that the revenue for ber@@ ke@@ ley is expected to be in line with current market expectations this year .
the analy@@ sts con@@ cur@@ red with the annual pre-@@ tax result of £ 4@@ 50 million .
ber@@ ke@@ ley shares were tr@@ aded in london in the afternoon at £ 2@@ 3.@@ 96 .
nu@@ de photos by j@@ enni@@ fer law@@ rence published by h@@ ack@@ ers on the internet by j@@ enni@@ fer law@@ rence .
j@@ enni@@ fer law@@ rence is at the 8@@ 5th o@@ sc@@ ar award cere@@ mony .
nu@@ de photos from os@@ car@@ -@@ winner j@@ enni@@ fer law@@ rence were taken online by a h@@ ack@@ er who claimed to have a &quot; master list &quot; of pictures of another 100 star@@ lets .
a representative of the star from &quot; the tribute of pan@@ em &quot; confirmed that the photos of law@@ rence are genuine and compla@@ ined to the h@@ ack@@ er for &quot; bl@@ at@@ ant violation of privacy &quot; .
the authorities have been notified and will prosecu@@ te all those who have taken the sto@@ len photos of j@@ enni@@ fer law@@ rence .
the photos originally published on the photo sharing page 4@@ ch@@ an were sup@@ pos@@ ed@@ ly filled with a lo@@ opho@@ le in the online storage system ic@@ l@@ oud by apple , which was supposed to be the &quot; master list &quot; of the h@@ ack@@ ers .
it is not sure how many of the images are real , although win@@ ste@@ ad , star from &quot; scot@@ t pil@@ gri@@ m against the rest of the world &quot; on t@@ wit@@ ter also condemned the h@@ ack .
&quot; to those of you who look at photos that my hus@@ band and i took years ago in the private environment of our house - i hope you are really satisfied with you &quot; , win@@ ste@@ ad wrote on t@@ wit@@ ter .
victori@@ a justice from the n@@ ick@@ lo@@ de@@ on series &quot; ic@@ arly &quot; and &quot; victori@@ ous &quot; , however , dec@@ lined that the photos were pictures of her trade .
let us just fight back to the beginning .
bu@@ zz@@ feed reported on late sunday that a spo@@ kes@@ man of pop star ari@@ ana gran@@ de has ques@@ tioned the authentic@@ ity of the alleg@@ ed photos of it .
exclusive ex@@ cer@@ pt from ho@@ ward jac@@ ob@@ son ’ s highly acc@@ laim@@ ed new novel about love and the letter “ j ” .
it was best described as it was broken , it slowly dis@@ integrated into the car@@ ton that was left in the rain .
at times , a woman told him that he was too serious , ti@@ ring , intense , di@@ stan@@ ced , and perhaps a little scr@@ at@@ ch@@ y .
and then sha@@ ken his hand .
he knew scr@@ at@@ ch brus@@ h .
he was st@@ uck , like in i@@ gel , yes .
the last victim of this st@@ ach@@ ec@@ ho@@ ism was a recent aff@@ air that was more promising in terms of eas@@ ing the lon@@ ely bo@@ re@@ dom of his life than usual , and perhaps even brought him some satisfaction .
a@@ il@@ in sol@@ om@@ on was a trem@@ bling , ten@@ der beauty with un@@ t@@ amed hair and a fl@@ at@@ tering heart from a village on the north island , which is even more remote and r@@ ough as port re@@ porter .
she had come south with an older compan@@ ion , who kept ke@@ vers for their a@@ un@@ t , and which had a p@@ lot in a hum@@ id but par@@ adi@@ si@@ ac@@ al valley with the ap@@ tly named paradise valley .
for several years nobody had lived in the house .
the tu@@ bes were le@@ ak@@ y , the ba@@ ths were still sp@@ id@@ ers , nec@@ k boxes had their trac@@ es left on all windows and believed that they belong@@ ed to them all , and the garden was covered with wee@@ ds .
it was like the house from a child &apos;s fair@@ y tal@@ e , both threat@@ ening and temp@@ ting , a garden full of myster@@ ies .
por@@ tra@@ it of the author : ho@@ ward jac@@ ob@@ son , whose novel &quot; j &quot; on the long@@ list for which man boo@@ ker prize 20@@ 14 is available .
the short@@ list will be announced next week .
ke@@ ver@@ n had been on the broken side of the shel@@ tered sun loun@@ gers with a@@ il@@ in keeping and had an un@@ usually warm spring afternoon .
your feet are too big .
because of their own aggres@@ si@@ veness , songs of this kind were no longer played on the con@@ sole .
not banned - nothing was really banned - just not played .
it was successfully ob@@ sole@@ te , just as the word ob@@ sole@@ te .
the general taste created what er@@ as@@ ure and regulation would never have achieved , and how people used to make the vo@@ m tell@@ rec@@ her to millions of mem@@ o@@ irs , coo@@ kers and songs on books .
in the eu@@ ph@@ oria of the day , ke@@ ver@@ n began playing an imag@@ inary piano and playing in a gro@@ b fun@@ ny se@@ ren@@ ade of a@@ il@@ in &apos;s big feet .
a@@ il@@ in did not understand that .
&quot; this was a well-known song by a jazz pi@@ an@@ ist called f@@ ats wall@@ er , &quot; he explained it and automatically put two fing@@ ers on his li@@ ps .
his father had always done this to stop the letter j before he came out of his mouth .
it had begun as a game between him and his father when he was still small .
his father had played it with his own father , so he had told .
if you start a word with a j without two fing@@ ers to put your li@@ ps , it costs you a pen@@ ny .
it was not a very fun@@ ny game at that time , and it was not very fun@@ ny now .
he knew that he was expected to do so , that was all .
it had to explain what jazz was .
a@@ il@@ in had never heard of him before .
jazz was a popular music , but not directly banned .
impro@@ vis@@ ation was no longer modern .
there was only room for a single &quot; if &quot; in life .
at the beginning of a me@@ lo@@ dy , people wanted to be quite sure where they would end .
so is the mind .
his un@@ predic@@ tability made people ner@@ vous .
and jazz was musi@@ cally expressed mind .
although he had grown 10 years old without being heard by sam@@ my dav@@ is junior , ke@@ ver@@ n knew about jazz from the half-@@ secret collection of old c@@ ds of his father .
but at least he did not have to explain to a@@ il@@ in that f@@ ats w@@ all@@ er was black .
at her age she probably could not remember a time when pop sing@@ ers were not black .
again , no laws or constra@@ ints were applied .
a con@@ form@@ ity meant that every element of this society was grateful to the principle of group talent - grateful as those spa@@ red fate .
people with a@@ fro@@ -@@ caribbean origin@@ s were vulnerable to entertainment and sports through temper@@ ament and body building , so they san@@ g and ran .
people who originally came from the indian sub@@ continent were like nature with electronic talent , and were bl@@ essed with the task of ensuring that the sub@@ continent did not have a family without a working telephone .
what was left of the polish community was the se@@ wage system ; what was said by the gre@@ e@@ ks was broken down .
those from the gulf states and the lev@@ ante , whose grand@@ parents had not left the country quickly than what had happened when it happened , fear of being forced to fle@@ e for fire .
everyone according to their abilities .
since she had only heard b@@ all@@ ads , it was difficult for a@@ il@@ in to understand how the off@@ ensive words ke@@ vers just made her available to her were ever to be s@@ oun@@ ded .
music was an expression of love .
&quot; they are not really off@@ ensive , &quot; said ke@@ ver@@ n .
except perhaps for people whose feet are too big .
my father never insul@@ ted anyone , but he loved this song .
he talked too much , but the negl@@ ected garden gave him the dec@@ ep@@ tive sense of security .
nothing could prevent the sound insul@@ ation of the huge co@@ h@@ l@@ like leaves .
a@@ il@@ in@@ n still did not understand .
why would your father have loved such things ?
he wanted to say that it was a ju@@ x , but hesit@@ ated to raise two fing@@ ers again in their presence .
she already thought that he was something strange .
&quot; it seemed fun@@ ny to him , &quot; he said instead .
she sha@@ ken her head and closed down ke@@ ver &apos;s view .
there was nothing else to see around the world than to see her un@@ comb@@ ed r@@ ab@@ el@@ -@@ black hair .
there was nothing he would have liked to see .
&quot; if you say it , &quot; do not mean it without convic@@ tion .
but that doesn &apos;t explain why you like it to me .
they seemed to be genuinely concerned .
are my feet too big ?
he looked again .
your feet do not directly .
maybe your an@@ k@@ les , a little bit ...
and tho@@ u sa@@ y@@ est tho@@ u ha@@ tes me , because my an@@ k@@ les are too th@@ ick ?
h@@ ate you ?
of course i do not h@@ ate you .
that is just the st@@ up@@ id song .
he could have said &quot; i love you &quot; , but it was too early for that .
&quot; your th@@ ick an@@ k@@ les are exactly the reason why you like me , &quot; he tried it instead .
i am a bit per@@ verse .
that did not sound right .
it should have been fun@@ ny .
when he tried to be fun@@ ny , he often got into trouble because he , like his father , did not have the so@@ o@@ thing charm that one needed to re@@ produce the wr@@ ink@@ les in@@ he@@ rent in jo@@ kes .
perhaps his father also wanted to be cru@@ el .
perhaps he wanted to be that , ke@@ ver@@ n .
despite his friendly eyes .
a@@ il@@ in sol@@ om@@ ons was red and rose from her dec@@ k chair , thre@@ w the con@@ sole and wi@@ ped it away .
the wine of the fl@@ or@@ ist , so dr@@ un@@ ken@@ ness was no exc@@ use for him .
in their ex@@ ci@@ tement , they seemed to trem@@ ble like pal@@ m@@ we@@ del in the stor@@ m .
&quot; and your th@@ ick@@ head is precisely why i am drag@@ ged to you per@@ ver@@ ted , &quot; she said ...
except that i am not .
she was sorry , both because of the unnecessary un@@ friend@@ liness of his words and the fear that she saw when she stood up against him .
did she think he would beat her ?
she had not told him about life on the cold northern archi@@ pel@@ ago where she had grown up , but he had no doubt that it was essentially as here .
the same huge and ic@@ y ocean bro@@ ke here as there on the shore .
the same conf@@ used men , with even th@@ ick@@ er skin and more des@@ pa@@ iring after what had happened than their an@@ ce@@ st@@ ors as s@@ mu@@ gg@@ lers and be@@ ach@@ -@@ rob@@ bers , pul@@ led from pu@@ b to bar .
dic@@ k@@ head ?
they would have shown her a big f@@ ist if she didn &apos;t fit !
they cr@@ um@@ ble first - cr@@ um@@ bling was the most commonly used word for ero@@ tic attr@@ action between men and women , a anti@@ d@@ ote to the no@@ t-@@ s@@ oun@@ ding love b@@ all@@ ads from the con@@ e .
ke@@ ver thought that was an unnecessary re@@ fin@@ ement , because the cr@@ un@@ ch itself was already an act of violence .
a@@ il@@ in sol@@ om@@ ons gave him a sign to go through her body .
he rose from the dec@@ k chair like an old man .
she also felt ble@@ aches , but the strength of his gri@@ ef surprised her .
that was not the end of the world .
they hardly knew each other .
she wat@@ ched him as he di@@ stan@@ ced himself - just as she had her compan@@ ion from a room on the top floor - a man compla@@ ining about something he her@@ self had sum@@ mon@@ ed .
ad@@ am leaves the garden , she thought .
she felt a su@@ dden pain for him and men in general , although some had raised their hands against them .
one man turned away from her , b@@ ent his back , sh@@ ame , defe@@ ated , without a fighting spirit - why was this a sight that she seemed to know well when she was not at the same time at all .
when she was alone again , a@@ il@@ in looked at sol@@ om@@ on &apos;s feet .
several years before the just told events es@@ me n@@ us@@ s@@ bau@@ m worked , an intelligent and enthusi@@ astic 3@@ 2-@@ year-@@ old resear@@ cher on behalf of of@@ now , the non-@@ legislative monitoring or@@ gan for the study of the environment .
&quot; a lot has already been done and much still needs to be done , &quot; she wrote , &quot; to understand the in@@ n@@ ate aggres@@ si@@ veness of a people who w@@ aged a thousand wars and won most of them , especially in the des@@ c@@ end@@ ants .
but some features turn out to be in@@ ex@@ or@@ able .
the higher the church tower , it seems , the smaller the passion that it continues to awa@@ ken .
the population is cr@@ ying when hearing s@@ enti@@ mental b@@ all@@ ads , wan@@ dering through stories of over@@ grown difficulties , and claim@@ ing to be firmly committed to the virtu@@ es of marriage and family life , but the former raw material is not only holding back .
&quot; they have an unfortunate tend@@ ency to ex@@ ag@@ ger@@ ate , &quot; said their ment@@ or when he had read the whole report .
i suggest you read fewer nov@@ els .
es@@ me wal@@ nu@@ t tree lo@@ wered her head .
i must also ask : are you a@@ the@@ ist ?
&quot; i think i don &apos;t have to say that , &quot; es@@ me n@@ us@@ s@@ bau@@ m answered .
are you les@@ bian ?
es@@ me again referred to her right to privacy and ref@@ usal of the statement .
fem@@ in@@ ist ?
silence again .
&quot; i don &apos;t ask this , &quot; said lu@@ ther r@@ ab@@ in@@ o@@ wit@@ z , &quot; because i am against a@@ the@@ ism , les@@ ben@@ ism or fem@@ in@@ ism .
this is a pre@@ jud@@ ice free job .
we serve a pre@@ jud@@ ice free society .
but certain types of hyper@@ sensi@@ tivity , which are in themselves absolutely acceptable and comm@@ end@@ able , can sometimes produce results as they have presented .
they themselves have apparently pre@@ jud@@ ices against the church , and these things that they call &quot; re@@ pre@@ hen@@ sible &quot; and &quot; r@@ ough &quot; could be interpreted by others as just an expression of natural strength and vit@@ ality .
if we continue to ride on what happened , if it happened , as if it were , if it had happened yesterday , it means giving the country its vital vit@@ ality .
es@@ me wal@@ nu@@ t tree looked around while r@@ ab@@ in@@ o@@ wit@@ z spoke .
behind his head , a led fon@@ t in fl@@ am@@ ing@@ or@@ os@@ a repeated the advice of@@ now gave to the country in the last quar@@ ter-@@ century or longer .
sm@@ ile to your neighb@@ ors , value your partner , listen to b@@ all@@ ads , visit musi@@ c@@ als , use your phone , talk , explain , listen to , agree , apo@@ log@@ ise .
speaking is better than silence , the vo@@ cal word is better than the written one , but nothing is better than love .
&quot; i understand perfectly what you want to go down to , &quot; es@@ me n@@ us@@ s@@ bau@@ m respon@@ ded with a quiet voice , when she was sure that her chief executive had spoken to the end , &quot; and i do not say anything else than we heal@@ ed effectively .
my concern is that , without warning , we may find ourselves in the same situation as we are repe@@ ating the mistakes that have only been made when it happened .
this time , however , it is not the others that we are le@@ tting out our an@@ ger and di@@ str@@ ust .
lu@@ ther r@@ ab@@ in@@ o@@ wit@@ z shaped a py@@ ram@@ id with his hands .
to indicate an eng@@ el@@ s@@ pati@@ ence .
&quot; they go too far , &quot; he said , &quot; if they call acts &quot; errors &quot; that our grand@@ parents may or may not have committed .
they also go too far in saying that they are not doing their &apos; an@@ ger &apos; and &apos; di@@ str@@ ust &apos; to &apos; others &apos; .
it should not be necessary to remind someone in your position that we are not doing anything about understanding the past as we do about protecting the present , not about &apos; us &apos; and &apos; others &apos; .
there was no &quot; we &quot; and there were no &quot; others &quot; .
it was a time of dis@@ order , that is all we know .
&quot; of that , if we are honest with ourselves , &quot; es@@ me d@@ ared to throw in , &quot; no part of society can claim to have be@@ having well .
i am not compla@@ ining to anyone .
whether it was done badly or well , what happened , has happened .
that was then .
nothing more needs to be said about this - we agree on that .
and just as no blame must be assigned , no blame must be re@@ paid if such re@@ payment is appropriate and if there is a way to re@@ me@@ dy it .
but what is the point of the past if we do not learn from it ?
the past serves to forget them .
if i may say something about this , i would like to say that
lu@@ ther r@@ ab@@ in@@ o@@ wit@@ z let his py@@ ram@@ id fall together .
&apos;@@ i will consider your report , &apos; he said and released it .
the next day , when she went to work as usual , she was over@@ run by a motor@@ cy@@ cli@@ sts who , as pas@@ ser@@ s-@@ by have described , were walking in a kind of &quot; brut@@ al r@@ age &quot; .
there are coinci@@ d@@ ences .
les@@ o@@ th@@ o military member says that no cou@@ p is planned ; prime minister remains in south africa ;
military officials in les@@ o@@ th@@ o argu@@ ed that a cou@@ p d &apos;@@ é@@ t@@ at to over@@ throw the government was planned , and said that they were going against polic@@ em@@ en who had been accused of armed political fan@@ a@@ tics .
prime minister thomas th@@ ab@@ ane f@@ led the country and said that the country ’ s army had en@@ cir@@ c@@ led its headquarters and had government buildings occupied in the capital mas@@ er@@ u .
the premier brought his family to the ad@@ jac@@ ent south africa after he had reported attacks .
military spo@@ kes@@ man major n@@ te@@ le n@@ to@@ i said that there was no de fac@@ to cou@@ p , but that the military respon@@ ded to the threat of &quot; political fan@@ a@@ tics &quot; whose armed forces were not able to control .
&quot; what happened this morning was that the army of defense forces operated by les@@ o@@ th@@ o after receiving several intelligence reports that there were some elements within the police that actually had some of the political , par@@ tis@@ an bo@@ ys .
south african spo@@ kes@@ man cla@@ y@@ son mon@@ y@@ ela said that military action had the impression of a cr@@ ash .
&quot; even if no one has claimed to have se@@ ized the government by force , all reports agree that the activities of the defense forces of les@@ o@@ th@@ o have hi@@ ther@@ to shown signs of a cou@@ p d &apos;@@ é@@ t@@ at , &quot; he said .
speaker of the military of les@@ o@@ th@@ o announced on sunday that the soldiers had returned to their bar@@ r@@ acks and had a calm situation in the capital .
in the meantime , depu@@ ty prime minister mo@@ the@@ jo@@ ya met@@ sing is taking over the leadership of th@@ ab@@ ana ’ s absence .
th@@ ab@@ ane told him that he believed he was wrong because of his attempt to combat corruption in the country .
in les@@ o@@ th@@ o , there has been great tension since june , after th@@ ab@@ ane ’ s parliamentary meetings were suspended because of the cl@@ ash@@ es in his unity government .
he said that his actions did not undermine the government to make any other acc@@ us@@ ations .
production in the eurozone at a 13 month low
the rise in output in the eurozone slow@@ ed to the lowest point in the last 13 months in august , according to a closely observed study .
the final mark@@ it purchasing management index of the manufacturing industry ( p@@ mi ) fell to 5@@ 0.@@ 7 in august , after a stand of 5@@ 1.@@ 8 in july .
a value of 50 indicates an expansion .
new orders were with@@ drawn and fac@@ tories were experiencing break@@ down@@ s at a time of increasing ten@@ sions between the eu and russia over ukraine .
the figures are coming up before the european central bank ( ecb ) meeting on thursday .
markets expect the bank to come up with a clear plan for dealing with a hesit@@ ant eurozone recovery and the threat of de@@ fl@@ ation at an inflation rate of only 0.@@ 3 % .
there is spec@@ ulation that the head of the ecb , mari@@ o drag@@ hi , will be able to give further information later this week as to whether he will consider quanti@@ tative eas@@ ing for the euro area , in line with those of the financial crisis and the united kingdom .
&quot; although small growth is better than no growth , the bra@@ king effect of the growing economic and geo@@ political un@@ certain@@ ties has become clearer for manufacturers , &quot; said ro@@ b do@@ b@@ son , senior econom@@ ist .
the factory p@@ mi for germany , russia ’ s largest trading partner in the eu , fell at its lowest level in 11 months , at 5@@ 1.@@ 4 .
meanwhile , in the second largest economic nation of the blo@@ c , france , the p@@ mi fell to 4@@ 6.@@ 9 .
france remains a problem child , as italy ’ s des@@ cent from a solid expansion to stag@@ nation .
evidence that growth stimul@@ us is a key factor in germany and spain and the netherlands is no longer effective is also un@@ re@@ ass@@ uring , &quot; said mr do@@ b@@ son .
the decline in industry is likely to fuel the fire of analy@@ sts , who expect further monetary or fiscal stimul@@ us .
a positive news came from the republic of ireland , where the p@@ mi rose to 5@@ 7.@@ 3 , the highest level since the end of 1999 .
ho@@ ward ar@@ cher , chief econom@@ ist at i@@ h@@ s global insight , said : &quot; the best you can do for the purchasing management index of the manufacturing industry in the euro area in august is the best .
he added : &apos; producers in the euro area are obviously finding life quite difficult at the moment , as the current hei@@ ghten@@ ed geo@@ political ten@@ sions - especially in relation to russia and ukraine - increase un@@ certain@@ ties in the continuing difficult conditions in many countries .
these increased un@@ certain@@ ties have clearly affected the economy - in particular , and consumer confidence , and pre@@ sum@@ ably lead to some orders being dela@@ yed or even cancelled , particularly large orders .
he said that it would be &apos; ever more likely &apos; for the ecb to finally introduce a type of q@@ e , &apos; although we susp@@ ect that this will be limited . &apos;
the hel@@ l@@ ness of the survi@@ v@@ ors of bes@@ lan : ten years have passed since the terrible sie@@ ge of the school , as the children involved are still suffering today .
ten years ago , more than 1 000 people were killed by chec@@ hen mil@@ i@@ ti@@ as in a school in bes@@ lan in southern russia .
more than 3@@ 30 people , more than half of them children , were killed in the three-@@ day mar@@ ty@@ r@@ dom that sho@@ c@@ ked the world .
we have returned to bes@@ lan to find some of the victims who died in the at@@ ro@@ city in the class@@ room .
just a decade after the app@@ alling sie@@ ge of the school of bes@@ lan , where 3@@ 34 people were killed , including 18@@ 6 children , the her@@ o@@ ic survi@@ v@@ ors war@@ ned of a new apo@@ c@@ aly@@ pse last night .
when fan@@ a@@ tical islam@@ ist terrorists killed children and parents on 1 september 2004 , the beginning of a new school year , they seemed to be like the worst of evil .
the tragedy united west and east in ab@@ hor@@ rence , and then turned surpris@@ ingly into action and hope for the future in the mid@@ st of the worst mis@@ ery .
ten years later we returned to bes@@ lan to find some of the victims who were killed in the at@@ ro@@ city in the class@@ room .
we found surprising young people who overcome resistance , even though the memory of this terrorist hel@@ l will persecu@@ te them fore@@ ver .
your greatest hope ?
the fact that the war that is now affecting ukraine - and in which children like them die - is now coming to an end .
the girl who was photograph@@ ed in an attempt to get into the sh@@ at@@ tered school hall .
it was be@@ li@@ ached by russian star photograph@@ er di@@ mit@@ ri be@@ li@@ ak@@ ov and was famous when she only tried to get into the sho@@ c@@ ked school hall in her under@@ wear after a min@@ er explo@@ ded .
she was also a member of the n@@ ba , a group of friends who were also involved in the development of the new york times .
both were thought dead , but survi@@ ved .
&quot; a woman told me i was supposed to run for my life , but i could not , &quot; said a@@ id@@ a then .
my leg@@ s were floo@@ ded with blood .
i stood up and clim@@ bed again to look for my mother .
a soldi@@ er brought them into safety .
after a series of operations she felt completely heal@@ ed , but said yesterday : &quot; three months ago , the pain returned .
i am afraid i have to be operated again .
some sh@@ ards of g@@ ren@@ ade are still in my k@@ ne@@ es .
your goal is to become a d@@ enti@@ st to help people , as doctors have helped them .
&quot; this tragedy changed my life , but it did not break me , &quot; says she mar@@ tial .
&quot; this happened to me and that cannot be changed .
once a year i go to the sports hall to remember those who stayed there .
my friends and i try not to talk about it on other days .
the pain is too great .
my best friend and future class@@ m@@ ate d@@ zer@@ a ga@@ po@@ eva was killed there .
we played together when we were small , dre@@ aming of going to school together .
&quot; i don &apos;t want to mar@@ ry until i finish my studies and start my career .
i think of a family later .
she says that the sie@@ ge will always remain a part of her , although the memory becomes a little weak@@ er every year .
i am glad that many people in the world still remember our hor@@ r@@ ors and we are so grateful for the help we have received from people in the uk and everywhere .
when i see the photo of me online as i clim@@ b back to school , i think that many people see it for the first time to understand our disaster and help to prevent this happening again .
the boy who f@@ led through the ball ho@@ ok in the belief that his mother was dead .
it was his first day at school ( rus@@ sians go to school at the age of 7 ) and survi@@ ved the three-@@ day sie@@ ge in the arms of his mother tam@@ ara .
as a se@@ ven@@ -@@ year-@@ old , he said : &apos; mo@@ m told me i should lie down if there was an explo@@ sion and keep her hand &apos; .
after an explo@@ sion he thought she would die .
she said to him : &quot; run . &quot;
they were afraid to be dead , he f@@ led and saw a we@@ eping baby on the way , took it by hand and f@@ led by a ball ho@@ ok .
his father v@@ la@@ di@@ mir , who loc@@ ked his son out in the arms , said : &quot; dam@@ ir told me that his mother had died .
he said : &apos; i could not save you . &apos;
in reality , tam@@ ara was st@@ um@@ b@@ led out and with le@@ g in@@ jur@@ ies in the hospital , in turn , assum@@ ing that her son had died .
after her re@@ unification she said : &apos; i we@@ pt with joy .
i could not believe it .
he ran in and hu@@ gged me .
dam@@ ir was later flo@@ wn to london ( from the now dis@@ solved newspaper news of the world ) to be led by the then prime minister ton@@ y bla@@ ir and his wife ch@@ eri@@ e to a bar@@ nar@@ do &apos;s champi@@ on children .
&quot; this hor@@ ror follows you every day , but i wish i could stop re@@ member@@ ing , &quot; he said yesterday .
but i can say that in my memory it becomes fa@@ in@@ ter .
i know that i will be able to war@@ n all my to@@ y gun@@ s straight after that .
but now i can play computer games with shot scenes and that is no problem for me .
&quot; i don &apos;t fear going back to the sports hall , but i don &apos;t think about myself .
i remember those children with whom i played in the court , who did not get out .
we never say that they were killed or dead .
we say that they have remained in the sports hall .
i remember my trip to london very well , especially the to@@ y shop , where i could pick everything i wanted , and the trip to london was an open car .
but now he is afraid of places like ukraine , where wars cause the kind of mis@@ fortun@@ e that he and his friends have suffered .
this hor@@ ror follows you every day , but i wish i could stop remin@@ ding me .
&quot; i &apos;m sorry for all those who suffer from the ab@@ om@@ inations , &quot; dam@@ ir said , who last week was a volunte@@ er in a monaster@@ y .
i would like to help you .
one day i want to go to the police and hope that you will take me to the school next year .
his mother tam@@ ara , 48 said : &quot; 37 children from our neighbor@@ hood were killed , can you imagine ?
i remember the terrible silence after the sie@@ ge , there were simply no children who sh@@ ou@@ ted and could walk around , and that silence las@@ ted many months .
she is vi@@ vi@@ dly remin@@ ded of her trip to london with dam@@ ir .
the people of london we@@ pt when i told our story .
i understood then how people across the world could understand our feel@@ ings , and show their support .
she was grateful to ch@@ eri@@ e bla@@ ir and her foundation for the prize and the opportunity to travel to london in autumn 2004 .
i wish i could call ch@@ eri@@ e and just tell her that 10 years have passed , but i still remember the meeting with her and her hus@@ band in london , and how that dam@@ ir helped me .
i remember dam@@ ir ’ s desire to eat bor@@ sch@@ ts@@ ch and to call upon all local russian restaurants .
i remember him working with cell@@ ars in a restaurant , dam@@ ir was sho@@ c@@ ked by his water gun and they ran away and played with him .
and that was just a month after the hor@@ ror .
i was surprised that the british were so willing to share our pain and support us .
she said : &quot; i always think that this world has not improved in these 10 years .
in ukraine , the war is now continuing and people are dying every day , and i believe that many children have been killed and are still being killed .
these are just children like ours .
i think that for many , the war is part of the news you hear when you are bo@@ red or busy with something else .
i know what these people feel , the whole hor@@ ror .
and i can not stop feeling that .
nothing has changed , people still want to kill each other and that is so sad .
dam@@ ir grew big and is a very gent@@ le and quiet boy , he is not aggres@@ sive or an@@ gr@@ y at all .
for example , he does not seek reven@@ ge , he is not overwhel@@ med by past ab@@ om@@ inations .
i know he does not like to remember it , but he has six close friends from the class and they occa@@ sion@@ ally go to the sports hall and ign@@ ite c@@ and@@ les there .
when he was smaller , he suffered - i remember how he sometimes referred to the sof@@ a , the face turned away from us , for hours .
not sle@@ eping , his eyes were open .
i also remember how he used all his weapons and other military to@@ ys , and dam@@ ir is now 17 , bigger than me , looking good , intelligent and healthy .
i can hardly believe that i was so sure for a few hours that he was dead and i would never see him again .
when i reco@@ vered after the explo@@ sion and came on my feet , i looked around and saw the hel@@ l around me , with all around body parts .
i was absolutely sure that my little boy could not survive in this hel@@ l .
&quot; i remember calling him &quot; dam@@ ir , run , run away &quot; , but i was so sure that the next day he would not hear me .
but he has heard it and he has gone .
and thus life , unlike that of many others , continues for us .
geor@@ gi@@ j il@@ y@@ in 17
the boy whose terrible image has been transformed into the symbol of bes@@ lan &apos;s ab@@ om@@ ination after sie@@ ge has been transformed into the symbol of the ab@@ om@@ ination of bes@@ lan .
con@@ sol@@ ation : the bes@@ lan survi@@ v@@ or geor@@ gi@@ j ly@@ in with his mother fa@@ tim@@ a after the sie@@ ge of 2004 , right a picture of geor@@ gi@@ j today a picture of geor@@ gi@@ j on the right .
his bloo@@ d@@ stream face was marked by fear when he ran for his life , while chec@@ hen terrorists were not able to defe@@ at his class@@ mates .
his image was one of the most sho@@ cking symb@@ ols of bes@@ lan &apos;s bar@@ bar@@ ism .
his mother fa@@ tim@@ a , 54 , a doctor , had taken him off for his first day in school before rus@@ hing to get her older son v@@ la@@ di@@ mir to university .
&quot; i left the court about two minutes before the terrorists stor@@ med him , and so my little boy was left there for three terrible days alone , &quot; she re@@ members .
not alone , there was a whole family of rela@@ tives of us , but they were all killed .
only my geor@@ gi@@ j managed to survive .
the closer this date is , the more difficult it is to think about and talk about it .
there is not a single day when we do not remember this tragedy .
we do not think it is a long time ago , i think it would have happened yesterday , some scenes from these days keep following me fore@@ ver .
nobody will ever forget that , i promise you .
the image of geor@@ gi@@ j ( left ) was one of the most sho@@ cking of the attack and was described as a stat@@ ue ( right ) .
i remember that on that day geor@@ gi@@ j wanted to go to school so much , saying he wanted to embr@@ ace his teacher .
i knew he was alive when i saw him on television .
and now there is even this stat@@ ue of the we@@ eping geor@@ gi@@ j in san mar@@ ino .
geor@@ gi@@ j doesn &apos;t like the picture and it is at home on the book@@ shel@@ f .
i understand that , but i also think that people around the world feel our pain thanks to this picture .
geor@@ gi@@ j says today : &quot; it is important that this can never happen again .
&quot; i doubt that we will ever hear the truth .
people are constantly investig@@ ating such trag@@ e@@ dies and never hear the truth .
and now you are investig@@ ating the cr@@ ash of this bo@@ eing in ukraine .
will we ever know what caused it ?
this world is becoming something terrible .
&quot; i cannot understand how this is possible , because if you ask people , nobody wants war , so how is it ?
ten years is nothing to do with such pain .
we need do@@ z@@ ens of years to forget it a little .
it has att@@ acked my health and i still feel it .
for about three or four years i had a few night@@ ma@@ res because of the sie@@ ge , but then it was better .
i went back to school in 2004 and was afraid every day .
i thought of my friends and class@@ mates who had been killed .
that is why i always go to the sports hall when 1 september is appro@@ aching .
i want to pay tribute to my old friends of child@@ hood .
it is hard for me to go to the sports hall , but i must do it .
i do not feel that i am a victim , this story is now part of my past .
i will not forget it , but i am not sorry .
my life goes on .
i finished school this year and i am visiting a medical university in v@@ la@@ di@@ ka@@ w@@ ka@@ z .
i will become a car@@ di@@ ac sur@@ ge@@ on .
my first choice was an education in the army .
i wanted to become a soldi@@ er , but my health did not allow it .
i wanted to fight for my country , but that will not happen .
geor@@ gi@@ j f@@ ani@@ ye@@ v 20
the boy who survi@@ ved , though at the foot of a mur@@ der@@ ous terrorist , was cap@@ tured .
a mir@@ acle : geor@@ gi@@ j f@@ ani@@ ye@@ v was under sie@@ ge at the foot of a mur@@ der@@ ous terrorist , but he managed to survive .
during the sie@@ ge he was caught in the sports hall and sat next to the bom@@ b that was at the foot of a mur@@ der@@ ous terrorist .
it is truly a mir@@ acle that he was not killed .
&quot; we feel it was yesterday , &quot; says geor@@ gi@@ j , who was appointed intelligence officer to the f@@ s@@ b , but this is due to his health damage due to the sie@@ ge .
it is still with me , it is not something i have left behind .
i am now older and people say that children can easily deal with bad experiences - i have to say that is not true .
&quot; in 2006 i worked with psycho@@ logi@@ sts and after that i felt a little better , but i can not forget it .
and i would like to forget .
2005 - in the year after - was the first and only time that i went back to the sports hall .
i lost consci@@ ousness .
i will never go back to that and i would ask you not to show you where i sat in this famous picture .
survi@@ v@@ ors : geor@@ gi@@ j f@@ ani@@ ye@@ v today , with a photo of himself in the hospital after sie@@ ge on the lap@@ top .
my pain is mon@@ strous and i carry it every day with me .
my friends know that i do not like to think about or talk about it and they never asked me about it .
i am physi@@ cally well off .
i should be careful with my w@@ oun@@ ded k@@ ne@@ e , but i can now run well .
but because of my health , i could not attend the f@@ s@@ b ’ s secret service academy in st pe@@ ter@@ sburg , as i wanted .
i have sent my documents , including the medical ones , and you have rep@@ lied that it is not possible .
my second passion was the animals , so i went to the veter@@ inary institute .
i have been there for two years .
he lear@@ ns the treatment of all animals &quot; from c@@ ats to co@@ ws &quot; .
he said : &quot; i knew i never told my children about my experiences .
children should not know about this and they should not suffer it , of course .
his mother marina , 42 , said : &quot; this pain never leaves me .
it is in my soul , worse when the anniversary is appro@@ aching .
i will go to the celebra@@ tions .
i know that geor@@ gi@@ j will not go .
it must be much more violent for him because he was there and i was not .
i wa@@ ited at home for him and could not help .
i am so grateful to god that he has been returned to me , here in bes@@ lan all of them are drawn .
it remains in us .
geor@@ gi@@ j is now an adult , but this hor@@ ror is still in him .
it is difficult to accept that if something like this is unfair .
he is a young , he li@@ kes sport , but he cannot participate because of his k@@ ne@@ e .
it has been operated several times , it can run but it does not exercise .
i would say that it has overcome the hor@@ ror by 50 % , but it can never be completely overcome and forgotten .
this terrible experience will always be with us .
many friends and neighbours were killed during the sie@@ ge , and that only rein@@ forces my pain .
i have lost many people i knew well and who were expensive to me .
my son is with me , and this is the biggest gift that god could make me , but my heart cr@@ y for the killed .
i know of families in which new children were born , but also wit@@ w@@ en , who never married again .
it is difficult to accept that life should continue , even if you do not want it .
i will never forget how my heart jum@@ ped in me when i saw him in hospital .
and now i see what is happening in the world - wars in other regions .
what are these people fighting for ?
why are they killing each other ?
the war is now very close to our country and i almost cannot believe that .
we used to be a friendly country , how can it be that we are fighting now ?
people and children are suffering , i am sure that many children have already been killed and many more are still being killed in ukraine .
if we only attack and throw all of these re@@ be@@ ls , as far as possible .

she is now ten ( right ) and does not remember the cru@@ el@@ ty of the cru@@ el@@ ty of the cru@@ el@@ ty of the past .
the world stopped bre@@ a@@ thing in 2004 when the baby al@@ j@@ ona was born in the arms of a russian polic@@ em@@ an from the be@@ sie@@ ge of bes@@ lan .
the terrorists left them to go , but kept their 30@@ -@@ year-@@ old mother , 10-@@ year-@@ old k@@ ri@@ st@@ ina and her brother ma@@ k@@ ha@@ r in the school hall in their cru@@ el@@ ty .
ma@@ k@@ ha@@ r , then three years old , es@@ cap@@ ed , but al@@ jon@@ as ’ mother and si@@ ster died in the mur@@ der@@ ous slau@@ ghter .
her father , rus@@ lan , has since married again and has worked with his new wife swe@@ t@@ lan@@ a to become a little girl that she has named k@@ ri@@ st@@ ina after his lost daughter .
al@@ j@@ ona , ten years old today , does not remember the sie@@ ge and has become an intelligent and happy girl , say neighb@@ ors .
&quot; they are now a great happy family and al@@ j@@ ona and ma@@ k@@ ha@@ r are both great children , &quot; says a close friend .
rus@@ lan is a fantastic father and wants to save you all the mem@@ ories that were born with the t@@ enth anniversary .
you will understand why .

4 tips for better under@@ water photos and videos
if you want to take photos or videos under water , there is a selection of devices .
the che@@ apest option is a water@@ proof point and sho@@ ot , like the ni@@ kon cool@@ pi@@ x aw@@ 120 or an action c@@ am like the g@@ op@@ ro her@@ oes .
i took these photos on a family festival with several cameras , all at a price below $ 3@@ 50 .
ir@@ respective of the equipment , there are some rules for the best results .
check your equipment twice .
even if you have a water@@ proof camera , make sure that the battery com@@ part@@ ment and other com@@ part@@ ments are closed close .
put your camera on the photos or videos you want to record .
some cameras and cam@@ cor@@ ders have scene and recording modes that allow the exposure time for the d@@ amp@@ ing under@@ water conditions to be optimi@@ zed .
and before you jum@@ p into it , check to what depth your equipment is functional .
some cameras are only allowed for up to 5 feet , others up to 50 or 60 feet .
search our shopping guide and reviews for digital cameras for conventional and water@@ proof models .
make multiple rec@@ ord@@ ings - because many will not work .
poin@@ t-@@ and-@@ sho@@ ot cameras feature an l@@ cd that lets you com@@ pose images , action c@@ ams usually do not .
even if you have an l@@ cd , it is difficult to see it under water , and the correct image setting is a lu@@ cky issue .
so make many pictures .
if your camera has a series mode that allows a series of images with slightly changed exposure settings , use it .
stay close to the surface .
the more you move from the surface , the worse the light becomes .
so if possible , they stay close to the surface when sho@@ oting in a pool , a lake or the sea .
this will also allow you to bring more color to your photos ; the de@@ eper you go , the less color you will see .
approach the objects closely .
that is also good advice on land , but it is all the more important under water because of the poor light conditions .
it is especially important to start working with an action c@@ am : these devices often have a fixed wide angle lens , which means that they are more den@@ sely align@@ ed to their objects when they are not in the entire frame .
andre@@ w law@@ son was a man of the variety whose character changed things , even in such a gi@@ gan@@ tic organization as the n@@ h@@ s .
as an an@@ aes@@ the@@ sia doctor , he devoted his career to the task of providing patients with both the ag@@ ony of the disease and the pain of treatment .
among his patients , his wife re@@ members , was a mi@@ 6 employee who was in@@ un@@ dated with the dev@@ ast@@ ating effects of torture .
law@@ son knew that doctors had been given the importance of diagno@@ sis and disease , while the treatment was largely based on something else : pain .
one day , however , in 2007 he was the one whose path of suffering began .
&quot; i did not feel , &quot; he wrote in may this year .
i had difficulty getting up .
while he is strugg@@ ling with fl@@ u symp@@ t@@ oms , he noticed that he was im@@ patient with his wife ju@@ li@@ et .
&quot; i want everything immediately rather than later , &quot; he noted .
as ju@@ li@@ et for a week on a business trip , law@@ son felt quite unusual and un@@ sett@@ ling .
there was something in the air .
he asked a colleague to carry out an x-@@ ray inspection of his bre@@ ast .
only two weeks ago he had been skiing in the french alps .
the result of the x-@@ ray investigation was available .
he suffered from mes@@ o@@ the@@ li@@ om@@ a , an incur@@ able cancer that caused the bre@@ ast fur , that is , the skin that over@@ la@@ ps the lun@@ gs .
as with most can@@ c@@ ers , the exact tri@@ gger is usually difficult to determine .
while some smo@@ kers , for example , suffer from l@@ ung cancer , not all l@@ ung cancer patients have been smo@@ kers before .
but mes@@ o@@ the@@ li@@ om is different .
in almost all cases , the tri@@ gger is an as@@ be@@ sto@@ s contam@@ ination - contact with the fi@@ ber , which was once considered a &quot; mir@@ acle &quot; but has now been recognized as le@@ th@@ al .
for most of us , mes@@ o@@ the@@ li@@ om is a disease that can easily ignore .
as@@ be@@ sto@@ s is , after all , a product of the past .
the most dangerous type of as@@ be@@ sto@@ s has not been used in britain since the 196@@ 0s when the industry volun@@ tar@@ ily committed itself to no longer using it .
even where it was still used , only people in certain sectors worked directly with the fab@@ ric - pl@@ um@@ bers , construction workers , car@@ pen@@ try and shi@@ py@@ ard workers , for example .
as an industrial hazar@@ dous material from another age , it seems to be hardly worrying today .
but this com@@ plac@@ ency is in@@ appropriate .
britain , it seems , is experiencing the cul@@ min@@ ation of a mes@@ o@@ le@@ um ep@@ ide@@ mic today .
there are more deaths from mes@@ o@@ the@@ li@@ om@@ a here than in any other country in the world .
with a total of 2,@@ 500 deaths per year , twice as many people die from this disease than from road accidents .
annual figures of mes@@ o@@ the@@ li@@ al deaths since 1980 , and anticip@@ ated future deaths in the uk
the reason we are now seeing the le@@ th@@ al effects , even though as@@ be@@ sto@@ s has been illegal for years ( 1999 all types of as@@ be@@ sto@@ s were banned ) , is that a mes@@ o@@ the@@ li@@ om is only developing after decades .
and the s@@ cour@@ ge of the mes@@ o@@ the@@ li@@ om is not con@@ fined to former workers in the construction industry .
as@@ be@@ sto@@ s was , and is still often , present in the houses where we live , the offices in which we work , the schools in which we learn and the shops in which we shop .
and therefore mes@@ o@@ the@@ li@@ om knows no class barriers , financial limits , profes@@ sions or age .
the privileged bas@@ tions , from the elegant department stores in london to private schools , are not a shel@@ ter .
parliament buildings are contam@@ inated with as@@ be@@ sto@@ s .
in the hospit@@ als where we are supposed to be healthy , we have also been used as a source of this dead@@ ly car@@ cin@@ og@@ ens .
andre@@ w law@@ son was not old .
he was not a pl@@ um@@ ber either .
he was indeed hard to imagine where he could possibly be in contact with as@@ be@@ sto@@ s .
then he found it out .
&quot; it seems that the tun@@ nels at gu@@ y &apos;s hospital , where i have been living for six years , are not a lot of as@@ be@@ sto@@ s . &quot; wrote .
all - students , nur@@ ses , doctors and nur@@ ses - use the tunnel .
one won@@ ders how many of my fellow members of my age will suffer from the same disease ?
unfortunately , he was able to answer this question at least in part .
&quot; of the four doctors who worked at the gu@@ y &apos;s hospital and who have been in the hospital for the last five years , &quot; he said .
how many of us will become ill ?
andre@@ w law@@ son was born mes@@ o@@ the@@ li@@ om at the age of 48 .
when he died on 17 february this year , he was 55 .
this was an un@@ usually long survival time .
fif@@ ty percent of all mes@@ o@@ the@@ li@@ o@@ gene@@ ous diseases die within 8 months of diagno@@ sis .
the disease always ends le@@ th@@ al .
we can therefore only repeat the question of law@@ son : &apos; how many of us will become ill ? &apos;
the uk ’ s leading expert on mes@@ o@@ the@@ li@@ om , professor ju@@ lian pe@@ to , assum@@ es that between 18@@ 70 and 20@@ 50 , when the as@@ be@@ sto@@ y ep@@ ide@@ mic is likely to st@@ all in the uk , 90 000 victims .
most of them do not yet know that they will die like that .

a quick look at the files of the courts , to which the parties concerned often turn for compensation claims , shows how far the s@@ cour@@ ge of the mes@@ o@@ the@@ li@@ um is already widespread .
in june of this year , for example , marks &amp; sp@@ enc@@ er ad@@ mitted that jan@@ ice had been neglig@@ ently exposed to as@@ be@@ sto@@ s .
she worked for nine years for the chain , from 197@@ 8 to 198@@ 7 and was responsible for the clothing department at two locations - one of them the flag@@ ship store at ox@@ ford street .
m@@ r@@ s. allen was only 18 years when she started her activity at m &amp; s .
now she has two children in the tw@@ en@@ ties .
&quot; before this thing , &quot; says she , &quot; i had never heard of mes@@ o@@ the@@ li@@ om , i did not even know anything about as@@ be@@ sto@@ s .
i never thought that would affect me .
there are few people who know a lot about as@@ be@@ sto@@ s .
the fact is that the term as@@ be@@ sto@@ s is not a substance but a group of six min@@ er@@ als .
the name comes from the word &quot; as@@ be@@ sti@@ form &quot; , a description of the fi@@ bre structure that makes the fab@@ ric resistant and flexible .
three of the six were used in the construction industry .
ch@@ ry@@ so@@ til , also known as white as@@ be@@ sto@@ s , is by far the most common as@@ be@@ sto@@ s found in buildings today .
it was designed for roof@@ ing plates , floor tiles , ro@@ h@@ ro sol@@ dering , bo@@ il insul@@ ation , even for bra@@ ke co@@ ating in cars .
it is less le@@ th@@ al than other forms of as@@ be@@ sto@@ s , but it is still considered by the eu and the who as a &apos; major health risk &apos; with possible death .
however , the brown as@@ be@@ sto@@ s ( am@@ os@@ ite ) and blue as@@ be@@ sto@@ s ( k@@ ro@@ ky@@ dol@@ ith ) are more dangerous .
britain was once the world ’ s largest im@@ porter of brown as@@ be@@ sto@@ s , and experts susp@@ ect that &quot; there are clear but indirect indic@@ ations that this is a major reason for the uni@@ qu@@ ely high mes@@ o@@ the@@ li@@ om@@ a rates . &quot;
a representative of marks &amp; sp@@ enc@@ er was appointed to the flag@@ ship store at ox@@ ford street , london , as@@ be@@ sto@@ s , al@@ am@@ y , al@@ am@@ y .
jan@@ ice allen may not have proven to be a typical mes@@ o@@ the@@ li@@ op@@ fer , but ju@@ lian pe@@ to ’ s work suggests that her story is not unusual .
he has presented a study by those concerned , which states that &apos; a significant proportion of mes@@ o@@ the@@ li@@ omas can be found in the world without a known suspension of work or in the house due to as@@ be@@ sto@@ s contact with the environment &apos; .
he said that a large part of these contacts are based on the &apos; normal use and aging &apos; of our buildings .
it seems that nobody can assume that they are safe .
a report by go@@ d@@ d@@ ard consulting , which exam@@ ines the palace of west@@ min@@ ster , shows how people , including in the heart of the government , have been un@@ kno@@ w@@ ingly exposed to the substance .
in 2009 , go@@ d@@ d@@ ard reported that the service sha@@ fts and pipel@@ ines behind parliament &apos;s committee rooms were contam@@ inated with as@@ be@@ sto@@ s , whose dead@@ ly fi@@ b@@ res were replaced by something as harm@@ less as &apos; strong air movements &apos; .
members of parliament are often accused of car@@ ing for their own interests , but it seems that the opposite is true .
while the director@@ ate of the parliamentary labour service insi@@ sted that the west@@ min@@ ster palace should have received a &quot; clean health certificate &quot; , it is now un@@ dispu@@ ted that £ 1 billion of work is required to be increased by several years .
the go@@ d@@ d@@ ard report also pointed out that &apos; the presence of as@@ be@@ sto@@ s cannot be handled in accordance with the respective provisions &apos; .
no one can know whether this mis@@ management will cost lives .
all we can do now is wait .
a person who could never determine the contact with as@@ be@@ sto@@ s precisely is gra@@ ham ab@@ bot@@ t , a general practi@@ tion@@ er .
as andre@@ w law@@ son susp@@ ects , the 50@@ -@@ year-@@ old ab@@ bot@@ t , during his work in hospit@@ als , was exposed to as@@ be@@ sto@@ s .
&quot; i worked in a hospital where as@@ be@@ sto@@ s complaints were decided posi@@ tively , &quot; he says , &quot; but i cannot prove it in my case .
it is so difficult to remember all the places where people worked and the data .
what he re@@ members is the day in early december 2009 , when he was given a kind of fe@@ ver .
he was 45 , and carried out an operation just late in the evening .
suddenly i had a fro@@ zen ch@@ est .
it came all of a su@@ dden .
i felt terrible .
i thought that the trip home was no longer a matter of creating .
as a doctor , ab@@ bot@@ t knew that the pain was caused by the bre@@ ast fur , the skin around his lun@@ gs .
but , like jan@@ ice allen , he had no reason to susp@@ ect a mes@@ o@@ the@@ li@@ om .
he went to work for a month .
ast@@ on@@ ished doctors made x-@@ ray rec@@ ord@@ ings of his bre@@ ast and use ple@@ ur@@ a@@ ka@@ the@@ ther to extr@@ act flu@@ id from the lun@@ gs and test it in the laboratory .
his complaints , however , remained un@@ diagno@@ sed .
his health slowly improved , and he returned to his work@@ place .
from time to time , however , the symp@@ t@@ oms returned , often after exercise and vigor@@ ous bre@@ a@@ thing .
in 2011 , a patient came to ab@@ bot@@ ts with similar symp@@ t@@ oms in his practice and was later diagno@@ sed with mes@@ o@@ the@@ li@@ om .
but even now , ab@@ bot@@ t did not associ@@ ate this with his own case .
after all , his patient was several decades older and had worked directly with as@@ be@@ sto@@ s .
the connection in that case was clear .
in september 2011 , ab@@ bot@@ t ’ s condition deterior@@ ated again , and his general practi@@ tion@@ er brought his c@@ t sc@@ ans and x-@@ ray pictures to an expert group .
in december 2011 , exactly two years after ab@@ bot@@ t felt si@@ ck for the first time , a sony equipped with a camera was thro@@ wn into the ca@@ ve between the ri@@ b and the bre@@ ast fur .
i am an optim@@ ist .
i usually keep on doing , &quot; he says .
to be honest , i was not so wor@@ ried .
but rac@@ hel , my wife , was concerned .
the result of the bi@@ op@@ sy was between christmas and new year : &quot; i was told that there was mes@@ o@@ the@@ li@@ om . &quot;
gra@@ ham ab@@ bot@@ t : diagno@@ sis mes@@ o@@ the@@ li@@ om@@ a
suddenly ab@@ bot@@ t had appoin@@ t@@ ments with mac@@ mill@@ an nur@@ ses , one of whom recommended him to seek a law@@ yer .
only now did he see the extent of the ep@@ ide@@ mic .
&quot; it turned out that as@@ be@@ sto@@ s was very widespread , especially in large public buildings where pi@@ pes are often isolated with as@@ be@@ sto@@ s , &quot; he says .
the people who were exposed to as@@ be@@ sto@@ s in these buildings are now ill .
and thus mes@@ o@@ the@@ li@@ om meets younger people who have not worked in the typical profes@@ sions .
the most dangerous pi@@ pes with as@@ be@@ sto@@ s insul@@ ation in hospit@@ als were located below the earth , so patients were probably not exposed to the substance .
but many employees who work in pede@@ strian tun@@ nels from one building to the other ( like andre@@ w law@@ son ) or in underground can@@ te@@ ens ( as is gra@@ ham ab@@ bot@@ t often did ) did ) .
it is evident that , over several decades after the war , hospit@@ als may have been life@@ -@@ saving for patients , but they are life@@ -@@ threat@@ ening for the doctors in question .
it is still being removed today .
students placed their bun@@ sen@@ bur@@ ners on as@@ be@@ sto@@ s mat@@ s .
and it does not just concern hospit@@ als .
as@@ be@@ sto@@ s was developed for its fab@@ ulous insul@@ ating and fl@@ ame re@@ tar@@ dant properties in offices , shops , libraries and city h@@ alls .
schools too .
indeed , many people probably have had the first as@@ be@@ sto@@ s contact in the class@@ room .
throughout the country , in thousands of chem@@ i@@ stry lessons , students have their bun@@ sen@@ bren@@ ner on as@@ be@@ sto@@ s mat@@ s .
on web pages , the topic as@@ be@@ sto@@ s is now frequently addressed in schools .
and meanwhile , inno@@ cent objects have been put in our houses such as floor tiles or sc@@ rap@@ -@@ down houses by default .
&quot; it is an industrial po@@ ison that is contained in large parts of our properties , &quot; notes andre@@ w mor@@ gan , the law@@ yer andre@@ w law@@ son in his trial against gu@@ y &apos;s hospital .
in one case , the only contact that fell into a woman concerned was the demo@@ lition of a sh@@ ed in the 197@@ 0s .
so make sure you te@@ ar your sh@@ ed off .
the effects of diagno@@ sis , and the knowledge that the disease is incur@@ able , is immen@@ se .
&quot; it takes a while to process that , &quot; says gra@@ ham ab@@ bot@@ t .
i went back to work and tried to continue , but i realized that i did not concentrate on what i did .
i was in practice for two weeks .
then i knew that i would go and had to take care of myself .
well , i will not see any more christmas .
the biggest difficulty was the change of perspective from a doctor &apos;s position to that of a patient .
like countless patients before him , he re@@ members how overwhel@@ med he was by all the information he had to get .
&quot; it was very difficult to take all of this in , &quot; he says .
&quot; i asked my doctor &quot; how long do i have to go ? &quot;
and they gave me about 12 months .
i remember that i thought &quot; well , i will not be another christmas .
that was then . &quot;
mes@@ o@@ the@@ li@@ om is particularly insi@@ di@@ ous because it is our life@@ -@@ support mechanism - the bre@@ a@@ thing itself - that causes the dead@@ ly cancer .
most cases of mes@@ o@@ the@@ li@@ om@@ a are caused by as@@ be@@ sto@@ s contact .
as@@ be@@ sto@@ s is made up of small@@ est fi@@ b@@ res .
when as@@ be@@ sto@@ s is sti@@ mu@@ lated and the fi@@ b@@ res are in@@ hal@@ ed , they can be applied in the ch@@ est fur , the skin around the lun@@ gs .
as@@ be@@ sto@@ s fi@@ b@@ res ir@@ rit@@ ate the bre@@ ast fur and can tri@@ gger cell mu@@ tations .
&quot; the problem ar@@ ises with the in@@ hal@@ ed con@@ i@@ fer@@ ous as@@ be@@ sto@@ s fi@@ b@@ res , &quot; says professor tom treas@@ ure , a hear@@ t-@@ thor@@ a@@ x doctor who passed to the gu@@ y &apos;s hospital in 2001 .
the hospital that andre@@ w law@@ son susp@@ ects is the same as as@@ be@@ sto@@ s is now ir@@ on@@ ically a leading hospital in the world of tre@@ ating mes@@ o@@ the@@ li@@ om .
treas@@ ure knew law@@ son and treated some others , who probably also worked during their training in the hospital .
once the as@@ be@@ sto@@ s nee@@ d@@ les reach the l@@ ung tissu@@ e , treas@@ ure says , &quot; they will be pus@@ hed to the edge from the bre@@ a@@ thing process , where the skin is .
by nature , it is inv@@ a@@ sive from the very beginning .
the usual options for other can@@ c@@ ers do not work well for mes@@ o@@ the@@ li@@ om .
the effectiveness of an operation , for example , is highly controversial .
some say that it is worth trying .
treas@@ ure den@@ ies that .
&quot; you can &apos;t cut the bre@@ ast fur out , &quot; he says .
you don &apos;t get around with the k@@ ni@@ fe .
meanwhile , the cancer &quot; spe@@ aks not very well for chem@@ other@@ ap@@ y , &quot; the &quot; effect shows &quot; but does not cure .
&quot; sometimes there are long-term survi@@ v@@ ors , &quot; says treas@@ ure .
but in the end they all die .
fortunately , some patients actually live long , much longer than expected .
the author ste@@ ph@@ en j@@ ay g@@ ould died 20 years after the diagno@@ sis .
two and a half years after his own diagno@@ sis , gra@@ ham ab@@ bot@@ t is still strugg@@ ling .
after cont@@ acting mes@@ o@@ the@@ li@@ om , ab@@ bot@@ t came into contact with andre@@ w law@@ son , who had been a one-@@ man support and advisory service four years after his diagno@@ sis .
&quot; hel@@ lo , cancer center , &quot; he che@@ er@@ fully presented himself with calls .
&quot; he was very positive , &quot; says ab@@ bot@@ t .
he had received his diagno@@ sis 4 years earlier and was still very active .
originally , ab@@ bot@@ t offered six chem@@ other@@ ap@@ y cy@@ cles , which last four months and are expected to extend his life for only one month .
&quot; i was desper@@ ate , &quot; he says .
i wanted to give up .
however , law@@ son managed to &apos; make things appear in a more positive light &apos; .
after consulting several doctors , ab@@ bot@@ t decided to continue his treatment with prof@@ . lo@@ ic lan@@ g-@@ la@@ z@@ dun@@ ski , car@@ di@@ ov@@ as@@ cu@@ lar specialist at gu@@ y &apos;s .
&quot; we had an advantage in not having to be referred back , i simply called on and got an appointment , &quot; says gra@@ ham .
a normal patient would have to receive a re@@ ferr@@ al and wait for the approval of the treatment .
money is crucial for mes@@ o@@ the@@ li@@ om@@ -@@ suff@@ e@@ rers to be able to enjoy the best available therap@@ ies .
but if these treatments inevitably fail , many people will be left with another financial concern - about the future of families they are left with .
and so they turn to the courts in the hope of compensation .
andre@@ w law@@ son cont@@ acted andre@@ w mor@@ gan of field fish@@ er water@@ house ll@@ p .
&quot; it has been known since 18@@ 98 that as@@ be@@ sto@@ s is extremely dangerous to health , &quot; says mor@@ gan .
but what changed in the 19@@ 60 ’ s was that it was recognized that a very low burden represented a health risk .
and here the neglig@@ ence of companies began to play a role .
andre@@ w law@@ son and gu@@ y &apos;s hospital finally brought their case to bear , but it was not what mor@@ gan called a &quot; full compensation &quot; , because law@@ son &apos;s was not satisfied with absolute certainty .
after the investigation into his death , a gu@@ y &apos;s spo@@ kes@@ man confirmed that &quot; the as@@ be@@ sto@@ s fi@@ b@@ res in the affected cel@@ lar area were removed in the 199@@ 0s . &quot;
this was too late for andre@@ w law@@ son .
how to remove as@@ be@@ sto@@ s
indeed , it is difficult for mes@@ o@@ the@@ li@@ om@@ -@@ suff@@ e@@ rers who seek compensation to solve a huge problem , the fat@@ al as@@ be@@ sto@@ s contact of a company or a job - usually decades after the events .
many of their former employers have been sold or closed .
insurance documents can be lost .
and those who oppose claims know that time is for them , but certainly not with the lam@@ ent@@ ators .
in response to this , there have been clear new legislation this year , which makes it easier for people affected by mes@@ o@@ the@@ li@@ om to claim compensation , even if their former employers are no longer found .
the law has set up a fund of £ 3@@ 50 million for all those who are going to be diagno@@ sed after july 2012 , funded by the insurance industry , but cannot prove that they have been cont@@ acted .
in these cases , the pla@@ in@@ ti@@ ffs receive 80 % of what a court would have been able to tell them in a normal compensation process - about £ 1@@ 20@@ ,000 .
about 300 successful applications to the programme are expected each year .
andre@@ w mor@@ gan , like so many mes@@ o@@ the@@ li@@ om@@ -@@ suff@@ e@@ rers , thin@@ ks that £ 3@@ 50 million was a &quot; very good job &quot; of the insurance industry .
&quot; this is a deal of insu@@ rers for insu@@ rers , &quot; he says , and suggests that this sum is a quarter of what insu@@ rers would have had to pay if the time was not over .
mi@@ ke pen@@ ning , then minister of labour and pension , also ad@@ mitted that the law was &quot; not perfect &quot; .
but both pen@@ ning and mor@@ gan ad@@ mitted that , with seven deaths on a daily basis , rapid action is necessary .
&quot; people are suffering so much and need help today , &quot; said pen@@ ning during the second hearing of the mes@@ o@@ the@@ li@@ om law in december last year .
at that time gra@@ ham ab@@ bot@@ t was in the hands of prof@@ . lo@@ ic lan@@ g-@@ la@@ z@@ dun@@ ski for 19 months .
after their first deliber@@ ations , lan@@ g-@@ la@@ z@@ dun@@ ski recommended an operation that , unlike tom treas@@ ure , was expected to have a positive effect .
this was confirmed by radiation therapy and chem@@ other@@ ap@@ y - a tri@@ ple therapy with which long la@@ z@@ dun@@ ski can survive a survival rate of five years of up to 40 percent .
ab@@ bot@@ t felt stronger .
&quot; of course , that is the most important thing , &quot; says ab@@ bot@@ t .
this is always apparent in patients .
there is something that allows you to continue .
if you give up , you will be getting worse off very quickly .
in march 2012 , gra@@ ham ab@@ bot@@ t under@@ went the operation .
at the end of august , he had left behind the last of the six chem@@ other@@ ap@@ y cy@@ cles .
after@@ care scan@@ s showed no sign of the disease .
then i had a s@@ can in march 20@@ 14 .
there were several cancer spots around my ch@@ est .
i have just been 50 .
this is not life@@ -@@ threat@@ ening .
that is a life@@ -@@ ending process .
again , ab@@ bot@@ t under@@ went six chem@@ other@@ ap@@ y cy@@ cles .
now no tr@@ ace of the t@@ um@@ ours is visible .
but the process is physi@@ cally and ment@@ ally very ex@@ hau@@ sting .
you need to think about practical things - about money if i am no longer , for example , or my wife show how the bo@@ il time setting works .
if you receive bad news , you will be negative .
they must look ahead .
as the father of el@@ lie , 16 , and tam@@ s@@ in , 14 , this is not always easy .
&quot; for parents this is difficult , &quot; he says .
it is difficult to know what to say and how much .
when i got my first diagno@@ sis , i told my girl that i had a disease that i would not grow old with .
they re@@ acted in different ways .
tam@@ s@@ in is very soci@@ able and un@@ st@@ in@@ ting .
she told her friends and we got a lot of calls soon .
el@@ lie was more re@@ stra@@ ined .
she did not say much .
such talks are something that all cancer patients must go through .
but for mes@@ o@@ the@@ li@@ o@@ gene@@ ous diseases , such talks have not been conducted with hope , not with a tr@@ ace of hope of survival .
the disease ( as it ultimately also brings to ste@@ ph@@ en j@@ ay g@@ ould ) fi@@ er@@ ce safety .
as andre@@ w mor@@ gan says , &quot; mes@@ o@@ the@@ li@@ om is not life@@ -@@ threat@@ ening .

china den@@ ies hong kong the right to vote in government , demonstr@@ ators swe@@ ar re@@ tali@@ ation , and the government is re@@ tali@@ ating .
on sunday , despite the increased calls for democratic reforms , the chinese parliament decided against nom@@ in@@ ating candidates for the 20@@ 17 elections by hong kong &apos;s elec@@ tor@@ ate .
this approach probably fi@@ ghts the long-@@ announced pro@@ tests in hong kong ’ s business district , while activi@@ sts are making the planning and mobili@@ zation of it within hours of the announcement .
the decision of the people ’ s chinese congress basically allows communist leaders to exclu@@ de all non-@@ pe@@ king@@ -@@ loy@@ al candidates .
&quot; this is not un@@ expected , but it makes us an@@ gr@@ y , &quot; said legal expert em@@ ily la@@ u , chairman of the democratic party .
that is not what beijing promised .
the people of hong kong have been lied to .
it is clear that we are dealing with an author@@ itarian regime .
in defending china ’ s decision , li fe@@ i , vice secretary general of the standing committee of the national people ’ s congress , said that the approval of public nom@@ inations for the hong kong government would be too &quot; cha@@ otic &quot; .
since 1997 , when britain reg@@ a@@ ined control of hong kong to the chinese , beijing has promised to leave the people in the government presidency from 20@@ 17 .
the chinese leadership presented sunday ’ s decision as a democratic break@@ through , because it offered hong kong citizens a direct right to vote , but the decision also makes clear that china ’ s leaders must not allow it to go through through a narrow beijing nom@@ ine@@ e .
a new clause also states that only candidates &apos; with love for the country and love for hong kong &apos; should be ad@@ mitted .
the decision follows a summer in which some of the biggest and most popular pro@@ tests in hong kong have been held for several years .
behind the pro-@@ democracy campaign in hong kong is the occup@@ y central movement with love and peace , whose organis@@ ers are threatened with giving financial districts the right to close down if pe@@ king does not have a genuine general right .
on sunday evening , within hours of the announcement , hundreds of occup@@ y cent@@ ric workers had been killed in the rain before the government headquarters .
during the demonstration , the organiz@@ ers said that their movement was a new stage of civil dis@@ o@@ be@@ di@@ ence and that they planned waves of protest in the coming weeks .
they did not provide any further information on this , however , apparently in order to avoid problems with the authorities .
in an online communication , the organiz@@ ers announced that the movement &quot; the occupation of the central district should only be considered as a last resort , an action that should only take place if all the opportunities for dialogue have been exhaus@@ ted .
we are sorry to say that today all the opportunities for dialogue have been exhaus@@ ted and the occupation of the central district will definitely take place .
the hong kong authorities have been waiting for the beijing announcement for days , and there were a lot of wor@@ ries about security on sunday before the government building , including police forces and bar@@ ric@@ ades .
the un@@ rest is exac@@ er@@ b@@ ated by the feeling of many in hong kong that they are slowly losing control of their city .
the influ@@ x of people from the main@@ land is increasing competition for products and services .
there is also a growing fear that hong kong ’ s values of democracy and freedom of speech will be cr@@ um@@ b@@ led under growing pressure from beijing .
some cri@@ tici@@ zed the occup@@ y-@@ centr@@ al movement ’ s demonstra@@ tions , which were designed to keep the business - hong kong ’ s li@@ fel@@ ine - at risk .
&quot; the pro@@ tests you talk about could cause great economic damage , depending on how many are involved and how long they last , &quot; said legal expert re@@ gin@@ e i .
we do not want to raise fears that hong kong will get out of control .
this impression is bad for investment .
china ’ s state@@ -@@ controlled media recently reported about democratic activi@@ sts in hong kong as being under the control of western powers .
this summer , activi@@ sts organised an informal referendum on electoral rights , involving 7@@ 8@@ 0,000 people - more than a fifth of the elec@@ tor@@ ate in hong kong .
in july , tens of thousands participated in one of the largest democratic demonstra@@ tions in the region ’ s history .
the tradition of the us school lea@@ f b@@ alls is now being transferred to universities , where fres@@ h@@ men performances are offered by private aircraft .
we are looking forward to meeting this demand and to providing the first luxury travel service for students of today .
to achieve a particularly impressive appearance at the university , the company also offers transport options such as private aircraft , roll@@ s-@@ roy@@ ce ph@@ an@@ tom , ast@@ on mar@@ ten or m@@ cla@@ ren p@@ 1 .
mr ste@@ w@@ art also said that the service has a security division .
this service is an ideal alternative for students who otherwise want to live in a danger@@ ously over@@ loaded car .
together with our new vi@@ f options , we look forward to making sure that students will be able to get to the university with a minimum of effort and maximum luxury this year .
a spo@@ kes@@ man said that no new book@@ ings were made , as the service was only just introduced , but added that &quot; students will not receive the service in the next few weeks &quot; .
the company also announced that despite the study fees of £ 9@@ ,000 per year , it exp@@ ects a market for this offer .
students today differ greatly from students 10 , 20 , 30 or 40 years ago - it is more important than ever to have a great first impression of what they want , and vi@@ f is the way to do it .
the national student union , however , critic@@ ised the service as being with@@ drawn .
me@@ gan dun@@ n , vice president of the n@@ us for higher education said : &quot; this offer seems to be completely separate from the life of most students .
many students starting this month are facing a crisis in living costs , as the available financial assistance in the form of loans and schol@@ ar@@ ships is not compatible with the so@@ aring b@@ ills for sim@@ plic@@ ity .
fem@@ ini@@ sts cri@@ tici@@ ze r@@ aci@@ al and police behavior after fer@@ g@@ us@@ on
the un@@ armed te@@ en@@ ager was arrested by a police officer in fer@@ g@@ us@@ on , mo@@ . earlier this month .
the participants lif@@ ted their hands into the air and san@@ g , &quot; hands high , not sho@@ ot , &quot; while they wa@@ ited before the fun@@ eral .
after two weeks of pro@@ tests in fer@@ g@@ us@@ on , mo , for the sho@@ oting of the un@@ armed te@@ en@@ ager michael brown , the blo@@ gger mi@@ ri@@ am zo@@ il@@ a pe@@ re@@ z noticed a change in the online world .
according to their experience , white fem@@ in@@ ist comm@@ ent@@ ators put gender before race when it comes to promoting re@@ productive law and income inequality .
but , while ten@@ sions in the middle west have increased and received attention throughout the country , pe@@ re@@ z saw that white women ’ s responses turned 100 % around the race .
compared to the answers of black women shortly after the sho@@ ts of 9 august , the personal es@@ says with tit@@ les like &quot; thought to fer@@ g@@ us@@ on by a white woman &quot; and &quot; fem@@ in@@ ism re@@ vol@@ ves not only around repres@@ sion .
but for pe@@ re@@ z , that meant a major change .
&quot; i do not think that fem@@ in@@ ism can find many people who know about it and enjoy privile@@ ges in such a high-@@ class way , &quot; she said .
people felt comp@@ elled to express their views on the events .
it is characteristic of the crisis in which we find ourselves and because the situation in fer@@ g@@ us@@ on is so eth@@ n@@ ically that you must express it .
for english professor k@@ ori@@ th@@ a mit@@ ch@@ ell of o@@ hi@@ o state university , fer@@ g@@ us@@ on has brought to light problems that black americans face every day , but which are not considered to be women &apos;s issues .
&quot; i can find something fun on fac@@ e@@ book about me and my partner and get 150 li@@ kes from anywhere , &quot; said mit@@ ch@@ ell .
when i post something about how to put col@@ oured people under sie@@ ge in their own country , silence is de@@ af@@ ening .
&quot; how can women be sure to talk publicly about a relationship , but not about security in public space ? &quot; she asked .
for black women like mit@@ ch@@ ell , the race , gender and sex@@ u@@ ality have studied in the history of the us , there is no dic@@ ho@@ tom@@ y between r@@ aci@@ al and gender problems .
for them , black women have not had the luxury of separ@@ ating the subjects ne@@ at@@ ly ; they live every day in the combined reality .
while white women now have to deal with the issues of race and gender in the fem@@ in@@ ist main@@ stream cir@@ cles , ang@@ ela h@@ att@@ ery , professor of women and gender research at george mas@@ on university , says that their pre@@ dec@@ essor did the opposite .
&quot; between 18@@ 65 and 18@@ 90 , at least 10@@ ,000 black men were yellow and the ra@@ pe of a white woman , &quot; hat@@ tery said .
white women had to be involved in history in order to justify the murder of ly@@ n@@ ch .
for h@@ at@@ tery , the white and black women split at the point where white figh@@ ters for women ’ s election rights , such as sus@@ an b@@ . an@@ th@@ ony , were the country ’ s analy@@ sts in the late n@@ ine@@ teenth century .
&quot; they made the decision to stand up for the right to vote for women , and the right to vote for the black people should come later , &quot; said h@@ at@@ tery .
when you remember such things , you realize with power why colo@@ red women do not trust white women .
we did not do our job well .
we have never helped black women to protect their hus@@ bands and s@@ ons .
even after women were given the right to vote in 19@@ 20 , white women had to resi@@ st ly@@ n@@ ching in the association of so@@ y .
the group came into being almost 40 years after the original request for help from black women , says mit@@ ch@@ ell .
for mit@@ ch@@ ell , the flo@@ od of white fem@@ in@@ ist re@@ actions to the questions raised by fer@@ g@@ us@@ on - police behaviour , r@@ aci@@ al discrimination - is a reflection of the time when white fem@@ ini@@ sts catch &quot; fem@@ in@@ ist problems &quot; .
&quot; would it not be great if the activi@@ sts who have such traditional fem@@ in@@ ist platforms had the right to educ@@ ate a child so seriously as they did with the right to receive a concep@@ tion ? &quot;
second generation fem@@ ini@@ sts who have been pursuing their care@@ ers in the struggle for re@@ productive rights and access to contrac@@ ep@@ tive means are now trying to understand what that means .
the well-known white fem@@ in@@ ist acti@@ vis@@ t gl@@ oria ste@@ in@@ en went to the city two weeks after michael brown sho@@ oting and published a poin@@ ting article by re@@ bec@@ ca ste@@ in@@ en .
&quot; i hope that women who have a different but parallel reason to have a body in@@ he@@ rent danger - and mean opinions about the race , which is in public opinion po@@ lls .
although ste@@ in@@ en stands for a rather inter@@ sec@@ tional fem@@ in@@ ism in which race and gender issues are addressed , some of her comments on r@@ aci@@ al issues in america have been pu@@ zz@@ led .
christ@@ ina som@@ mers , resear@@ cher at the american enterprise institute and author of &quot; who sto@@ le fem@@ in@@ ism ? &quot; said to she the people that young men in the united states , especially young far@@ bi@@ ans .
there are now hundreds of specific programmes for girls and young women , but almost nothing for bo@@ ys .
but when the white house recently launched a small program , my brother &apos;s ke@@ eper , to help vulnerable young black and h@@ is@@ pan@@ ic men , there were an@@ no@@ ying re@@ actions from many fem@@ ini@@ sts , including those from women .
the police ’ s relationship with the black community is not the only problem that has become the focus of main@@ stream fem@@ in@@ ism .
after the us border police have killed almost 6@@ 3@@ ,000 un@@ accompanied min@@ ors on the country ’ s sou@@ th@@ west border this year , the issue of immigration reform is again coming to the surface - this time as a women ’ s issue .
andre@@ a mer@@ c@@ ado , co-@@ chairman of we bel@@ ong together , an organisation that is mobili@@ zing women for immigration reform , said that a re@@ consideration of the issue was essential to a women &apos;s issue .
&quot; they speak for themselves , &quot; said mer@@ c@@ ado .
if the large majority of working vis@@ as go to male immigrants , the women who ac@@ company them are in a position where they are held for domestic violence and exploitation .
&quot; these stories are reflected in women &apos;s organisations , &quot; she said .
&quot; sch@@ we@@ in@@ e-@@ haus &quot; in ip@@ sw@@ ich is on sale .
the image of a house for sale was removed from real estate agents when it became clear that it showed a large pi@@ g that it had made itself comfortable in the living room .
this de@@ t@@ ached house has one bedroom , located on a private road in ip@@ sw@@ ich and is available for £ 1@@ 20@@ ,000 .
the details included a picture of the living room of the house - including a pi@@ g that had his head on a sof@@ a bed .
real estate agents conn@@ ell@@ s said that the pi@@ g on the photo was the owner &apos;s pet .
&quot; the photo was er@@ ron@@ e@@ ously published and has since been removed &quot; said a spo@@ kes@@ person of the company .
in the exposure of the house , con@@ n@@ ell@@ s described the former assembly house as a &quot; unique de@@ t@@ ached house with one bedroom . &quot;
although the bro@@ ker has removed the image from the website , it still appears on advertising material .
the sale of houses was of interest in the social media when some asked whether the pi@@ g was included in the purchase price .
the town of har@@ ve@@ y is home to a new mil@@ li@@ on@@ air@@ e after lo@@ t@@ tery win .
a lo@@ t@@ tery player from har@@ ve@@ y is on his way to this month .
the search for a new mil@@ li@@ on@@ air@@ e in the sou@@ th@@ west of per@@ th continues with a lu@@ cky winner , who will get out of the ra@@ ff@@ le on saturday almost $ 1.@@ 1 million .
a newspaper ki@@ os@@ k in har@@ ve@@ y moved the jack@@ pot to the zi@@ e@@ h@@ rer di@@ vi@@ sion@@ . after 1 million $ in november 2009 , for the second time in five years .
the lu@@ cky winner has yet to come out .
the shop owner ste@@ ve forward said that profit care for talking in the small town in the south-@@ west of per@@ th .
the city is talking about nothing else , and everyone is quite ex@@ ci@@ ted .
we thought that such a gain could come .
eight wa@@ -@@ winners have won pri@@ zes in the first division last month , a proper conclusion for a few happy weeks for players in the state .
last week , a player from can@@ ning val@@ e was one of the five mil@@ li@@ on@@ ai@@ res in august , after a couple from bel@@ mon@@ t won the me@@ ga@@ -@@ profit of $ 7.@@ 5 million just a few weeks earlier .
the winning couple had played for twenty years and said that the prize allows them to travel around the world and buy a new house .
the mil@@ li@@ on@@ air@@ e from har@@ ve@@ y is the 5@@ 9@@ th winner of the first division in the wa this year , with a total of almost $ 85 million .
leon@@ id@@ as asked for a new name for the gla@@ di@@ at@@ orial arena .
not only the gla@@ di@@ ators were an@@ k@@ le deep in the mat@@ sch at the first r@@ hin@@ bach roman day in the am@@ us@@ ement park .
but the attr@@ action of the event was strong enough to attract over 1000 visitors yesterday who were able to meet the ra@@ in@@ sho@@ wers and the autumn cold and to get away from the historic spectac@@ le .
there was a colour@@ ful set of illustra@@ tions , performances , games , exhi@@ bits and information about the time of the roman@@ s and their importance to the r@@ hin@@ eland .
the main attr@@ action of the day was undoubtedly the mar@@ ti@@ alist figh@@ ter force of the gla@@ di@@ at@@ orial school &quot; am@@ or mor@@ tis &quot; , which used every ra@@ inf@@ all to stop in the soft sand .
gla@@ di@@ ator owner &quot; leon@@ id@@ as &quot; proved to be hum@@ or@@ ous and competent pres@@ enter and sent in succ@@ essive his men to the hel@@ den@@ ic second match in various gla@@ di@@ at@@ or@@ eng@@ ages .
first , the &quot; pro@@ voca@@ te@@ urs &quot; were in line with a rec@@ tan@@ gu@@ lar shi@@ eld and short s@@ word , as well as le@@ g rail on the left le@@ g and arm rail on the right arm .
the &quot; es@@ se@@ d@@ ari@@ i &quot; followed with a ch@@ est shi@@ eld , short s@@ word and thro@@ wing l@@ ance , and iron gla@@ di@@ ator hel@@ met , le@@ g and arm protection .
the performance of the &quot; re@@ ti@@ ari@@ us &quot; , which was completed with a thro@@ wing net , tri@@ z@@ ack and d@@ ag@@ ger , was particularly impressive and after a short fight the bo@@ ys came to the ground .
the s@@ words of me@@ tal@@ lic cr@@ ash@@ ed , the shi@@ el@@ ds of the heads and the lit@@ ter lan@@ ces fle@@ w through the arena , sur@@ passing the fear and b@@ ent that could be around the health of the gla@@ di@@ ators .
but on those had the imposing &quot; sum@@ ma ru@@ d@@ is &quot; , the mus@@ cu@@ lar re@@ fe@@ ree , a always atten@@ tive eye .
&quot; we wanted to revi@@ ve the everyday life of rome and to make the culture of the roman era a reality , &quot; lo@@ ren@@ z e@@ us@@ kir@@ chen , chairman of the organiz@@ er &quot; friend &apos;s roman channel &quot; , explained the culture .
after two years of preparation , a &quot; op@@ pi@@ d@@ um roman@@ um &quot; , a roman temple , was built from the am@@ us@@ ement park for a day , as vice may@@ or cla@@ us we@@ h@@ age stated in his gre@@ e@@ ting word .
after all , the roman@@ s have not only brought war and con@@ quest to our region , but also roman culture and numerous buildings that we still adm@@ ire today .
the remains of these were also visible during the roman day , such as &quot; aqu@@ educ@@ t-@@ mar@@ ble &quot; from the ele@@ ven metres high and 14@@ 00 metres long roman canal bridge , which once stood in v@@ ent l@@ ü@@ f@@ tel@@ berg .
the fron@@ tin@@ us society once and now confron@@ ted the water and energy supply , and managing director pe@@ tra fr@@ ic@@ ke knew : &quot; today we still benefit from the knowledge of that time &quot; .
this is confirmed by the diplom@@ a surve@@ ying engine@@ er r@@ alp@@ h he@@ ili@@ ger from the &quot; engineering team two &quot; from rhe@@ in@@ bach , the measuring instruments of the roman@@ s such as ch@@ or@@ ob@@ at , gro@@ ma or di@@ op@@ tra .
the roman@@ es@@ que villa in blan@@ ken@@ heim presented s@@ ket@@ ches and models of the exc@@ av@@ ations an@@ no 18@@ 94 as well as br@@ ick from the original hypo@@ ca@@ ste , the hot air he@@ ater , which once made the re@@ dness .
impressive also the foot@@ prin@@ ts of wol@@ f and fox two mill@@ en@@ nia ago in the foot@@ steps of cla@@ y are impressive before they were bur@@ ned .
in 2011 , the office for conservation of min@@ eral monuments at the rhe@@ in@@ land regional association had the remains of a roman villa exc@@ av@@ ated in the nor@@ d industrial park in rhe@@ in@@ bach .
the walls of an economic building were covered with a dar@@ re to dry gra@@ in and to m@@ ill .
the building probably has been converted into a villa rus@@ tic@@ a , an agricultural property , the archae@@ o@@ log@@ ist dr. j@@ enni@@ fer mor@@ sche@@ is@@ er explained .
a number of finds from these exc@@ av@@ ations were found in a glass glass glass display , including a large plate , several fine glass vessels and parts of a small nec@@ kl@@ ace .
the villa was built from the first to the fourth century ad to christ , until the inv@@ asion of the german@@ s in the then roman r@@ hin@@ eland , pre@@ sum@@ ably mor@@ sche@@ is@@ er .
the children also worked with the roman wind@@ m@@ ill game , similar to today &apos;s m@@ ill game , or they wrote as the roman students used to use metal gri@@ ps to make their names appear on wa@@ x boards .
at the stand of the roman thermal sp@@ as z@@ ü@@ l@@ p@@ ich the children were allowed to lay their own mo@@ sa@@ ics , ba@@ ke glass mo@@ sa@@ ics at the glass museum rhe@@ in@@ bach and at the stand of the ei@@ fe@@ l natural centre .
with the original col@@ d-@@ blo@@ ss@@ om@@ ing re@@ plic@@ a of roman vehicles , visitors dro@@ ve through the am@@ us@@ ement park and also came to the impressive stand of the city gy@@ m@@ na@@ si@@ um , which is here .
with a roman week from 13@@ th to 21st september , the municip@@ ality of w@@ ach@@ t@@ berg will also be transformed into the r@@ hin@@ eland year of rome 20@@ 14 , which was marked by the death of emper@@ or au@@ gu@@ st@@ us 2000 years ago .
together with the local and historical associations and the w@@ ach@@ t@@ ber@@ ger wan@@ der@@ -@@ vere@@ in , the partnership association and the la@@ i@@ en@@ spi@@ el@@ kre@@ is ob@@ er@@ b@@ ach@@ m , them@@ atic hi@@ kes , lec@@ tures , cooking even@@ ings and more .
for example , a roman legi@@ on@@ na@@ ire is exemp@@ ted from his work on the zu@@ g@@ lic@@ he w@@ ach@@ t@@ berg , plants are presented as living monuments from the roman era and a wit@@ ty lesson in matters of collective war@@ fare between peoples .
the ad@@ endor@@ f ele@@ mentary school is dedicated to the roman theme during a project week .
the roman week is intended to cover the numerous , often not at first sight visible trac@@ es of the roman@@ s in w@@ ach@@ t@@ berg .
the w@@ ach@@ t@@ berg town hall presents a small presentation to the fund of the ber@@ k@@ um@@ er mat@@ ron@@ en@@ heim in 18@@ 7@@ 9 .
e@@ bol@@ a – the ep@@ ide@@ mic is a dra@@ in on west africa ’ s economy
the e@@ bol@@ a ep@@ ide@@ mic in west africa is also a serious b@@ low to the economy .
markets are or@@ ph@@ an@@ ed - and international companies are di@@ stan@@ cing themselves from the market .
the dev@@ ast@@ ating e@@ bol@@ a ep@@ ide@@ mic is a serious b@@ low to west africa &apos;s economy .
the har@@ v@@ est ro@@ ts in the fields , the mines are abandoned and the markets or@@ ph@@ an@@ ed - the virus has se@@ ve@@ rely added to the region .
some international companies are already di@@ stan@@ cing themselves .
&quot; the e@@ bol@@ a ep@@ ide@@ mic is not only a medical crisis , but also an economic one , &quot; jud@@ ges the head of the african development bank , don@@ ald k@@ ab@@ er@@ u@@ ka .
liber@@ ia is hard@@ est hit
&quot; it is a total disaster , we lose a lot of money , &quot; says al@@ ha@@ ji b@@ am@@ o@@ go , who is in mon@@ ro@@ via &apos;s second largest market selling clothes in liber@@ ia &apos;s capital , mon@@ ro@@ via .
only those who buy food or something to dis@@ inf@@ ect e@@ bol@@ a will be able to buy on the market .
liber@@ ia is hit hard@@ est by the virus , here alone the fe@@ ver killed more than 600 people .
recently , health authorities said that the disease had spread to every corner of the country .
in gu@@ ine@@ a , sier@@ ra le@@ one and ni@@ geria , the virus has spread .
in total , more than 1,@@ 500 people have already died , thousands more have been recru@@ ited .
foreign firms are pul@@ ling out workers
throughout res@@ our@@ ce-@@ rich countries , companies are deplo@@ ying their operations .
foreign companies such as the steel company ar@@ cel@@ or mit@@ tal are with@@ drawing their employees , several international airlines are no longer flying to the affected regions .
local trad@@ ers and farmers are also re@@ acting : few merchan@@ ts are still leaving their homes to supply supplies .
in some areas of sier@@ ra le@@ one and liber@@ ia , which are quar@@ ant@@ ine , the resources needed for export of co@@ co@@ a and coffee crops are ro@@ tting .
farmers d@@ are not leave their homes for har@@ v@@ est .
food is scar@@ ce
&quot; people will travel less and less &quot; , says phil@@ li@@ pe de v@@ re@@ yer , paris expert for the economy of west africa .
for example , the man who normally goes to the market and sel@@ ls his vegetables is better off staying at home .
the population is therefore being told the consequences of the ep@@ ide@@ mic directly and urgently : food is becoming scar@@ ce .
in the markets , stocks of basic foods such as rice are d@@ wind@@ ling .
at the same time , the region , which is heavily dependent on international firms , is threatened with damage to its image , with far-@@ reaching consequences .
the main danger is that international companies will basically avoid the area for a long time , says phili@@ ppe hu@@ g@@ on of the french think tan@@ k ir@@ is .
the decisive factor is how far and how long the virus will spread .
investors may have the impression that it is dangerous to invest in gu@@ ine@@ a , sier@@ ra le@@ one , and liber@@ ia , and thus invest in it , &quot; hu@@ g@@ on war@@ ns .
the disease also places a heavy burden on the states &apos; har@@ d-@@ pressed budgets
the disease also places a heavy burden on the already har@@ d-@@ pressed state budgets of the states concerned .
the rating agency mo@@ o@@ dy &apos;s fears that its budgets are heavily dependent on high spending on the health system and , in addition , on the wor@@ sen@@ ing economy .
the african development bank has already promised to provide $ 60 million ( $ 45 million ) to the health systems of the countries concerned .
the effects are also felt in ni@@ geria , where so far only a few e@@ bol@@ a cases have been diagno@@ sed .
although the o@@ il@@ -@@ rich region of the southern ni@@ ger del@@ ta has not been affected .
but elsewhere , many people are already at home for fear of cont@@ ag@@ ion .
reservations in hotels are also significantly reduced .
the 50@@ th anniversary of the swiss national day of the year is a great time for the protection of the children .
the &quot; t@@ ann@@ en@@ wal@@ d &quot; pu@@ pil@@ s &apos; association bern@@ ga@@ u celebra@@ tes its 50@@ -@@ year anniversary from 12@@ th to 14@@ th september .
the tan@@ n@@ en@@ wal@@ d s@@ ü@@ d@@ z@@ ol@@ l club is preparing for the 50@@ -@@ year foundation festival from 12@@ th to 14@@ th september .
the plan is on friday , september 12 , a great evening of entertainment with the group &quot; dor@@ fro@@ ck@@ er &quot; .
on saturday at 6 p.m. the big bo@@ ld sho@@ oting takes place .
the evening of mo@@ od is then marked with the &quot; sto@@ ap@@ fal@@ zer sp@@ it@@ z@@ bu@@ am &quot; in the big festival t@@ ent .
br@@ ass band creates music
highlights on sunday are the fe@@ st@@ got@@ t service and 9.@@ 30 am in the par@@ ish church and the great for@@ tress at 2 pm .
in the afternoon , the price distribution of the federal and ga@@ us@@ sian sho@@ oting is also included .
the 25 festi@@ vals with their dir@@ n@@ d@@ l@@ n will be a particularly beautiful sight .
the cha@@ pel is the b@@ last cha@@ pel of bern@@ ga@@ u .
the pat@@ ron@@ age has been con@@ ferred on may@@ or wol@@ f@@ gan@@ g wild and secretary of state al@@ bert fü@@ r@@ ack@@ er .
the original name &quot; protec@@ tive society of t@@ ann@@ en@@ wal@@ d bern@@ ga@@ u &quot; dates back to 19@@ 07 when the association was founded on 21 march on &quot; social entertainment through exercise in room and small scale sho@@ oting &quot; .
the na@@ zi regime had caused the dis@@ solution of the association in 19@@ 37 .
only in 196@@ 4 did 19 young men find themselves again , who won the &quot; new &quot; sch@@ ü@@ tz@@ en@@ vere@@ in &quot; t@@ ann@@ en@@ wal@@ d &quot; bern@@ ga@@ u from b@@ ap@@ tism at the inn lu@@ k@@ as .
kar@@ l march and ad@@ ol@@ f ried led the club as a sho@@ ot@@ master through a difficult initial period , in which the main aim was to find a club and to control the sho@@ oting operation .
the sch@@ ü@@ tz@@ en@@ vere@@ in in in the gu@@ es@@ thouse &quot; le@@ in@@ inger &quot; started in autumn 196@@ 5 with two teams in the la@@ p competi@@ tions .
in the years to come , sports sho@@ ot@@ ers , who have now been organised in seven teams , established themselves in all classes right up to the 1st gau@@ lig@@ a .
the records of the association are pur@@ sing every year and the mag@@ ical limit of 3@@ 80 r@@ ings was first established by ru@@ di me@@ i@@ er in 1980 .
just as the performance of active sho@@ ot@@ ers has increased , the number of members has also improved .
after the &quot; le@@ in@@ inger &quot; club no longer meets the requirements of a modern sho@@ oting club , the then former executive board has decided to establish itself under the leadership of jo@@ han@@ n r@@ inn .
after a work@@ load of 27@@ 00 hours , on 8 may 198@@ 8 , the par@@ ish of str@@ ass@@ er granted the church bl@@ essing for the new sho@@ oting rooms .
one of the great highlights in the history of the association was certainly the 4@@ 4th ga@@ uss sho@@ oting , cou@@ pled with the sole@@ m@@ n con@@ sec@@ r@@ ation of the new protec@@ tive flag in july 1991 .
on 23 and 24 april 1994 , the s@@ ü@@ d@@ z@@ en@@ vere@@ in celebrated its 30@@ -@@ year anniversary .
in 1995 a b@@ ö@@ ll@@ er@@ gr@@ up@@ pe was founded .
jo@@ se@@ f sch@@ mal@@ z@@ l became b@@ ö@@ ll@@ er@@ be@@ re@@ ch@@ ent .
a great challenge for the &quot; b@@ ö@@ ll@@ ere &quot; and for the club as a whole was the direction of the bav@@ arian b@@ ö@@ ll@@ er@@ tre@@ ff@@ en 2005 .
in many hours of volunte@@ ering , the club members have visited the areas and the sho@@ oting facility at the bern@@ gau@@ er hof last year and have thus brought it up to date with the latest technology .
ele@@ ven teams in la@@ p competi@@ tions
the sport@@ y performances of the sch@@ ü@@ tz@@ en@@ vere@@ in can also be seen .
in total , ele@@ ven teams are currently participating in the la@@ p competi@@ tions : six air ri@@ f@@ le teams , a pilot air pi@@ st@@ ol team , a sports pi@@ st@@ ol k@@ k@@ 1 , a youth team and two ah teams .
the first team with lars ell@@ rich , k@@ ath@@ ar@@ ina ell@@ rich , ste@@ ff@@ i gra@@ d and ker@@ sti@@ n kel@@ er@@ mann will be in the round 2013 / 14 of the gau@@ ob@@ er@@ lig@@ a ( highest league b ) in sch@@ ü@@ tz@@ u .
the second team with ve@@ ren@@ a mo@@ os@@ bur@@ ger alex@@ and@@ ra me@@ i@@ er , eva sch@@ u@@ h@@ mann and to@@ bi@@ as gram@@ l is from the gau@@ lig@@ a nor@@ d to the gau@@ ob@@ er@@ lig@@ a .
besides the sho@@ oting , events such as bo@@ ck@@ sle@@ ec@@ hes , car@@ ni@@ val and royal ball , club ou@@ ting and christmas party have tradition .
the sho@@ ot@@ ers are also present at the festi@@ vals in par@@ ish and municip@@ ality .
ton@@ y ste@@ w@@ art will be hit by an accident on his return to the race track .
ton@@ y ste@@ war@@ ts ’ return to the race track ended about half way through his race on the atlan@@ ta motor spe@@ ed@@ way .
ste@@ w@@ art went against the wall for the second time after his right front ty@@ re collap@@ sed in round 17@@ 2 and ended his evening .
ste@@ w@@ art dro@@ ve his damaged car into the garage and left it without talking to journalists .
his team chief ch@@ ad jo@@ hn@@ ston said that his 1@@ 4-@@ member team was disappointed , but now focus on the race next weekend in rich@@ mon@@ d , vir@@ g@@ ini@@ a .
&quot; i wish we had a better bet and a better result for him , &quot; jo@@ hn@@ ston said .
we are going to rich@@ mon@@ d and hope that we can do better there .
ste@@ w@@ art already dro@@ ve earlier on sunday evening after a col@@ li@@ sion with ky@@ le bus@@ ch in a wall and had to repair the right side of his car .
&quot; today i am quite hope@@ ful of a good result , &quot; jo@@ hn@@ ston said , and added : &quot; it just did not work . &quot;
not long after the second accident , ste@@ war@@ ts wag@@ on was loaded into the tra@@ iler and the team had packed and was ready to leave .
ste@@ w@@ art won three nas@@ car spr@@ int cup rac@@ es after his car dro@@ pped another driver in a race to the north of new york state .
he decided to return this week and to go to either atlan@@ ta or the next race in rich@@ mon@@ d to take a place in the pursu@@ it .
he returned to work while an investigation into the tragic incident that led to the death of the 20@@ -@@ year-@@ old k@@ ev@@ in ward j@@ r. , who was on the road during a race to ste@@ w@@ art .
on friday , the authorities announced that investigations into the cause of the accident will continue for at least two weeks .
no decision has been made as to whether ste@@ w@@ art has to face an indic@@ tment .
the three champi@@ ons received a great applause when he was presented before the race .
after a start at 12 position , ste@@ w@@ art was in the first 10 shortly afterwards and was tempor@@ arily in fourth place .
after a re@@ start in round 12@@ 2 , bush ’ s first race was in round 12@@ 2 .
after the exit , take the no 18 out of control and col@@ li@@ ded with ste@@ w@@ art , both d@@ are to drive against the wall .
ste@@ w@@ art continued to drive , but fell back to number 21 .
d@@ ancing young people were looking for a new d@@ ancing talent .
just try out : la@@ ura , len@@ a , lis@@ a , mari@@ e , bet@@ t@@ ina , em@@ ma and director lis@@ a ne@@ it@@ z@@ el ( from left ) look forward to co-@@ comb@@ at@@ ants .
like many other clubs , jazz groups on tv ja@@ ws are also the focus of full-@@ day classes at secondary schools .
after the summer holidays , some groups have deci@@ mated themselves .
now , more young people are being sought for a sport that is healthy and fun .
the two jazz and modern dance groups of lis@@ a ne@@ it@@ z@@ el , form@@ erly a d@@ anc@@ er in the jazz and modern dance formation &quot; spir@@ its &quot; , have only a few more children .
&quot; three in the group of eight to twelve years , six in the group of twelve to 15 years old , &quot; tells the 20@@ -@@ year-@@ old .
with more active people , it would be much more fun to dance &quot; one could dance quite different cho@@ re@@ o@@ gra@@ phi@@ es &quot; , she says .
if you like dance , you can dance on thurs@@ days between 5 and 6 pm or on fri@@ days between 5 and 6 : 30 pm in the dance sports room at the former hotel me@@ yer , fre@@ i@@ stra@@ ß@@ e 9 , without any obligation .

nato does not want to bro@@ ke agreements with russia
nato will be further strengthened by the planned sta@@ tioning in eastern europe following the ukra@@ inian crisis .
nato secretary general and@@ ers fo@@ gh r@@ as@@ mus@@ sen said in brussels on monday that nato comp@@ lies with the founding agreement of the 1997 nato / russia council .
the nato chief , however , accused russia of &quot; a sharp breach &quot; of the agreement .
&quot; today we must face up to the reality that russia does not regard nato as a partner , &quot; r@@ as@@ mus@@ sen says .
i can see from documents and opinions from the russian side that &apos; they see us as oppon@@ ents &apos; .
stronger nato presence
r@@ as@@ mus@@ sen has also announced that he intends to strengthen nato &apos;s presence in eastern europe .
a decision to be taken at the nato summit in wal@@ es will ensure that &apos; we are more visible nato &apos; presence in the east .
ki@@ e@@ v and moscow agree on new gas talks
russia and ukraine have officially agreed to re@@ sume talks to resolve their gas dispute .
negotiations are scheduled for next saturday , the russian energy minister alexander no@@ wa@@ k said on monday .
there is still a decision to be taken by the european union as to whether it will send a representative to the talks .
because of the gas price dispute , ukraine has been depri@@ ved of fuel from russia for weeks .
finally , the eu energy commissioner g@@ ün@@ ther o@@ et@@ t@@ inger had medi@@ ated between the two sides .
ukraine had war@@ ned that russia could also cut off gas supplies to europe .
europe supplies about a third of its natural gas from russian sources , much of which flows through ukraine .
mer@@ kel spe@@ aks power word : tol@@ ls will come &quot; very clearly &quot;
now the chancell@@ or is clearly committed to this once again .
a licence for all the complicated details is not .
persi@@ stent concerns from the c@@ du against the tol@@ l on cars have been increasingly felt by the c@@ su .
after the ongoing contradic@@ tions of her c@@ du , chancell@@ or ang@@ ela mer@@ kel has used a power word to introduce a tol@@ l on cars .
&quot; let us be clear : it is in the coalition treaty and it will come , &quot; said the leader of the party on monday after meetings of the c@@ du leaders in berlin .
mer@@ kel initially did not agree on a detailed model .
the black and red government programme calls it &quot; certain parameters &quot; .
federal minister of transport alexander do@@ br@@ in@@ dt ( c@@ su ) has made a proposal and work on it is now under way .
the n@@ r@@ w-@@ c@@ du , however , insi@@ sts on its no to tol@@ ls on all roads .
mer@@ kel stressed that finance minister wol@@ f@@ gan@@ g sch@@ ä@@ u@@ ble ( c@@ du ) also contributed construc@@ tively to the deliber@@ ations on a bill .
in addition to the subject , he has also talked about other ways of investing more private capital in infrastructure , such as broad@@ band .
&quot; there is nothing special about it &quot; .
c@@ su chief hor@@ st see@@ ho@@ fer war@@ ned that he would not be able to use tol@@ l concepts in his cab@@ in@@ et against the minister responsible .
c@@ du bun@@ des@@ vi@@ ze arm@@ in las@@ ch@@ et confirmed his objec@@ tions .
&quot; the coalition agreement never assumed that all the county and federal roads would be tol@@ led , &quot; said the north r@@ hin@@ e-@@ west@@ ph@@ ali@@ an c@@ du president .
in this respect , it is an important signal that see@@ ho@@ fer has now announced that he will be speaking again on the subject .
resistance to the plans is also expressed by the c@@ du national associations of bad@@ en-@@ w@@ ür@@ t@@ tem@@ berg and r@@ hin@@ el@@ and-@@ pal@@ at@@ in@@ ate .
the background to this is the fear that a tol@@ l will affect the local border traffic to neighbouring states .
see@@ ho@@ fer had a very strong political position because of the tol@@ l criticism from the c@@ du ran@@ ks .
the left sees plans as weak@@ ened in the face of the dispute within the union .
&quot; the mur@@ ks tol@@ l is dead , &quot; said party leader ber@@ nd ri@@ ix@@ inger of the &quot; new os@@ n@@ ab@@ r@@ ü@@ ck@@ er ze@@ it@@ ung &quot; ( monday ) .
&quot; the tol@@ l fails the minister , &quot; do@@ br@@ in@@ dt wants to impose a duty on all german roads starting in 20@@ 16 .
according to the coalition agreement , however , domestic car owners must not be subjec@@ ted to additional bur@@ dens .
therefore , they should be able to achieve full compensation for tol@@ ls through the vehicle tax .
however , the model must not discrimin@@ ate against foreign drivers in accordance with eu law on the grounds of their nation@@ ality .
genetic dis@@ order often mis@@ diagno@@ sed
a bri@@ tin says she thought about the problem of the death of a mis@@ diagno@@ sis for many years .
kar@@ in ro@@ d@@ gers lived almost all of their youth in the belief that they had only a few years to live after they had been diagno@@ sed with another disease .
she was indeed suffering from the char@@ co@@ t-@@ mari@@ e-@@ to@@ oth disease ( c@@ mt ) - a group of in@@ h@@ eri@@ ted dis@@ orders that had caused ner@@ ves outside the brain and sp@@ inal cor@@ d .
char@@ ity c@@ mt uk announced that mis@@ diagno@@ sis is a common problem for people with c@@ mt because so little about this disease is known .
some 23@@ ,000 people in the uk are likely to suffer from c@@ mt , which can lead to motor dis@@ orders such as mus@@ cle weak@@ ness , an un@@ safe pass@@ age and cr@@ um@@ b@@ led to@@ es .
patients also suffer from de@@ af@@ ness or pain , and the disease is incur@@ able and progressive , which means that the symp@@ t@@ oms are more severe over time .
when ro@@ d@@ gers was 13 , she believed that she had worked on fried@@ rich at@@ a@@ xi@@ e ( fa ) - a disease with very poor chan@@ ces of survival .
ro@@ d@@ gers thought she would sit in a whe@@ el@@ chair before she would 18 , and die before her 30@@ th birth@@ day .
the mother of two children , who is 51 years old today , said : &quot; as a child i knew i could not do the same as the others .
i fell constantly and everything las@@ ted longer with me .
i could never compete with other children roll@@ er shoes or sk@@ ate@@ board and was often in school because of my way to go and run .
ro@@ d@@ gers said that at the age of 13 , after several operations to reli@@ eve their ach@@ ill@@ es and stret@@ ching their feet , they saw their medical records when their doctor left the room and read that they had been leaving the room .
&quot; i felt guil@@ ty because i was cur@@ ious , so i did not in@@ sp@@ ire anyone , but i went home , looked for the disease in the library and looked for it .
when i received a reply , i was sho@@ c@@ ked and pan@@ ic@@ ked in hor@@ ror .
i thought i could be in a whe@@ el@@ chair at 18 and die at 25 , and in between i would slowly lose all my abilities .
i did all this alone with me and planned my own fun@@ eral .
she said when she was 17 , she realized that her skills had not di@@ min@@ ished as much as she had imag@@ ined , and asked her doctor .
he stood up and hu@@ gged me and said , &quot; my love , i do not think you have that , otherwise you &apos;re already in whe@@ el@@ chair . &quot;
i think you have something much less life@@ -@@ threat@@ ening .
after some genetic tests , it was detec@@ ted with c@@ mt .
&quot; when he explained to me what c@@ mt was , i felt as if i were a winner , &quot; she said .
char@@ ity c@@ mt uk has a c@@ m@@ t-@@ awareness month to respond to this disease .
the first of these , the first of the three , was the first to be used as a fire figh@@ ter .
for almost ten years , the former military training place in munich has been closed .
yet every month , dead@@ ly am@@ m@@ uni@@ tion is still being discovered at the heart of the sw@@ ab@@ ian al@@ b bio@@ sphere region .

a de@@ af@@ ening b@@ low h@@ all@@ es the explo@@ sions over the heart of the bio@@ sphere area .
in december 2004 , the last shot of the tro@@ op training square in m@@ ün@@ sing@@ en fell , which ended in 2005 after 1@@ 10 years of military operations .
since then , the 6@@ 500 hec@@ t@@ are area has been the heart of the sw@@ ab@@ ian al@@ b bio@@ sphere region , which is known for its 13 marked trails for hi@@ kers and cy@@ cli@@ sts .
tax burden on business people in the washington area is rising with the economic recovery
economic recovery means more customers , more sales and new jobs .
it also means higher taxes .
state and local tax regimes for domestic companies rose slightly last year , while economic recovery acceler@@ ated , so a newly published study in the past week , and firms in the washington dc region formed no exception .
companies in district , mar@@ y@@ land , and vir@@ g@@ ini@@ a jointly paid $ 2@@ 7.@@ 6 billion to government and local agencies in the financial year 2013 , an increase of 3.@@ 8 percent over the revenue of 2012 , amoun@@ ting to $ 2@@ 6.@@ 6 billion .
the government and local tax burden of companies rose by 4.@@ 3 % last year to $ 6@@ 71 billion , compared to 3.@@ 9 % a year earlier , and it was the third con@@ secu@@ tive year of growth after several years of decline in ken@@ ya .
government taxes rose more than local taxes to 4.@@ 3 % , according to the study conducted by the service agency .
more than half of district tax revenue , 56 percent , comes from corporate taxes , while mar@@ y@@ land ’ s corporate income accounts for 36 percent of the income .
vir@@ g@@ ini@@ a achiev@@ es the lowest tax revenue from companies , with 28 percent .
much of the rise in tax revenues is due to a recovery in companies ’ real estate assets , say researchers , which will lead to a 3.@@ 7 % rise in real estate taxes this year after the three con@@ secu@@ tive years of 1 % growth .
while much of these gains come from large states such as california , new york , and tex@@ as , the process seems to be true for washington .
district , mar@@ y@@ land , and vir@@ g@@ ini@@ a jointly paid more than $ 10 billion in government and local property taxes last year , compared to $ 9.@@ 6 billion in 2012 , an increase over a year by 4.@@ 2 % .
but the apparent recovery in real estate values in mar@@ y@@ land is not so effective in increasing government and local tax revenues , as real estate taxes are bare@@ ly one-@@ fifth of the tax revenues of companies .
companies in vir@@ g@@ ini@@ a and d.@@ c. pay almost half of their government and local taxes in the form of property taxes .
&quot; in mar@@ y@@ land , the following happens : a large proportion of the real estate , especially in the tax area around d.@@ c. , is owned either by the government or by non-@@ profit organizations that do not pay real estate taxes , &quot; said dou@@ gl@@ as lin@@ d@@ holm .
mar@@ y@@ land is therefore forced to focus much more on income taxes , for example , in order to be able to offer the same services that other states offer .
the recent recovery in tax revenues from companies cannot be attribu@@ ted solely to the recovery of the housing market .
business revenues also seem to be reco@@ vering , according to the data .
companies in the region reported income taxes to state organizations of $ 2.@@ 3 billion compared to $ 2.@@ 1 billion in 2012 .
mar@@ y@@ land took $ 1 billion in corporate income taxes , the highest amount in the region .
while the trend is moving in the same direction , the local tax burden on companies is not rising even@@ ly in all three places .
the district ’ s increase was 4.@@ 3 % in line with the national average , while the rise in mar@@ y@@ land was significantly higher , 4.@@ 9 % .
only vir@@ g@@ ini@@ a reported a lower tax rate of 4.@@ 1 % .
vir@@ g@@ ini@@ a has achieved the lowest company income in all three areas of office ( all three have fixed corporate tax rates ) , with 6 % .
the corporate tax rate in mar@@ y@@ land is 8.@@ 25 percent and the district is relatively high at 9.@@ 9@@ 75 percent .
a comparable study by the us chamber of commerce earlier this year showed that in vir@@ g@@ ini@@ a lower state and local company taxes are being demanded , and that the overall tax climate is better than in mar@@ y@@ land .
the study did not investigate the district .
despite the advantages , vir@@ g@@ ini@@ a is under pressure from its southern neighb@@ our .
north car@@ ol@@ ina has laws to reduce its corporate tax rates from 6.@@ 9 % this year to 6 % , the same rate as vir@@ g@@ ini@@ a , and the rate will rise to 5 % next year .
if the state continues to achieve its income targets in the coming year , this law could reduce the state ’ s corporate income tax rate by 20@@ 17 to 3 % .
meanwhile , small businesses in the washington area seem to be doing better , and they therefore pay more government and local taxes , according to the recent study .
corporate taxes , which are paid as personal income taxes by small business@@ men - a transitional structure that allows most small businesses to be organized - in district , mar@@ y@@ land , and vir@@ g@@ ini@@ a rose by 20 % last year , to 2.@@ 4 billion .
researchers say that the trend and rise in corporate taxes throughout the country is likely to continue this year , with an increase in the general tax revenue for the state and local government .
but washington may la@@ g behind if spending cuts by the federal government focus on labor in the region .
partner town : german beer for gu@@ ang@@ z@@ ho@@ u
ho@@ ps and mal@@ t - a popular combination in china as well .
german beer has an excellent reputation in china .
frankfurt ’ s partner city in china now wants a bre@@ w@@ ery and also hopes for direct flight connections between the two cities .
german beer , bre@@ wed in frankfurt &apos;s partner city gu@@ ang@@ z@@ ho@@ u - that is the urgent request of the officials in china .
&quot; we would be very pleased if a german bre@@ w@@ ery would set@@ tle in our city , &quot; said the vice party secretary of the south china metro@@ polis , li yi@@ we@@ i , this week visiting a sp@@ d delegation .
time and again , the chinese communist party , the official of the ruling party , came to this concern of the twel@@ f@@ - million metro@@ polis .
gu@@ ang@@ z@@ ho@@ u , also known in germany as can@@ ton , is one of the rich@@ est cities in china , li .
that is why people also poss@@ essed the purchasing power to afford german beer .
the chairman of the german social democratic party , thor@@ ste@@ n sch@@ ä@@ fer@@ -@@ g@@ ü@@ m@@ bel , who led the german political delegation , said to the host that he would look for a possible partner for the project in germany .
&quot; good water is not much needed for beer : good water , gra@@ in and jo@@ ie de vi@@ vre , &quot; he added at lunch with the party leader in gu@@ ang@@ z@@ ho@@ u .
mr li is already ex@@ ci@@ ted about this jo@@ ie de vi@@ vre , he fl@@ at@@ tered the host .
the official from gu@@ ang@@ z@@ ho@@ u subsequently met sch@@ ä@@ fer@@ -@@ g@@ ü@@ m@@ bel , but with red wine , which was served for the meal .
the chinese brand t@@ sing@@ ta@@ o is based on german bre@@ wing .
t@@ sing@@ ta@@ o beer is used according to the german pur@@ ity law .
more business
a second wish of chinese hosts would be direct flights between frankfurt and gu@@ ang@@ z@@ ho@@ u , said vice party chief li .
lu@@ f@@ than@@ sa had previously offered the flight , but cancelled it for economic reasons in 2012 .
&quot; it would be worth it again &quot; , the local politici@@ an was convinced .
&quot; business transactions between our two cities are growing . &quot;
at the moment , travellers should take the de@@ tour via chan@@ g@@ sh@@ a in the province of hun@@ an , li compla@@ ined .
the administration of gu@@ ang@@ d@@ ong province , the capital of gu@@ ang@@ z@@ ho@@ u , also hopes for the flight connection .
the province ’ s vice govern@@ or , chen y@@ un@@ xi@@ an , made this wish clear in his con@@ vers@@ ation with the social democrats .
&quot; this is a very good idea , &quot; said sch@@ ä@@ fer@@ -@@ g@@ ü@@ m@@ bel - the chinese vice minister li j@@ in@@ ju@@ n , an in@@ timate con@@ no@@ iss@@ eur of germany , no@@ d@@ ded in agreement .
a well-@@ maintained partnership
the li@@ bel vice leader of gu@@ ang@@ z@@ ho@@ u ’ s party hopes to be able to make frankfurt a partnership meeting next year .
li yi@@ we@@ i was already in the main , but not yet in this function .
he came into office only this year after his pre@@ dec@@ essor had left office for corruption charges .
the local party leader wan q@@ ing@@ lian had to leave .
the actions taken against gu@@ ang@@ z@@ ho@@ u officials are part of a nation@@ wide campaign against party and government corruption , led by leader x@@ i j@@ in@@ ping with hard .
the new leader , li yi@@ we@@ i , had voted for an american company before his party career , which was highly unusual in the chinese communist party .
before he took office in gu@@ ang@@ z@@ ho@@ u , he was a top official in fu@@ j@@ ian , where the v@@ w car manufacturer built a large factory .
frankfurt is officially more than a do@@ zen town tw@@ in@@ ning partnerships .
the connection to gu@@ ang@@ z@@ ho@@ u , which is 9@@ 000 kilometres away , is one of those maintained by both sides , for example with a student exchange .
last year the 2@@ 5-@@ year anniversary of the german@@ -@@ chinese association was celebrated .
the southern chinese metro@@ polis on the per@@ l river is almost as strong as h@@ ess@@ en with its economic power .
next year , it intends to produce a gross domestic product of eur 250 billion , li reported .
family of jo@@ an ri@@ vers &quot; pus@@ hes the thum@@ bs &quot;
jo@@ an rivers has been in new york city since she was ad@@ mitted to hospital three days ago ; however , her daughter has now been hope@@ ful that the 8@@ 1-@@ year-@@ old com@@ ic would have reco@@ vered from her ill@@ ness .
&quot; thanks for your constant love and support , &quot; mel@@ is@@ sa ri@@ vers said today in a message .
we are all pus@@ hing our fing@@ ers .
her mother was , according to sources , sent@@ enced to death on thursday after an emergency due to a heart attack in a clin@@ ic on the upper east side , yor@@ k@@ ville en@@ do@@ scop@@ y , in mount sin@@ ai hospital .
the doctors keep them deliber@@ ately se@@ ded and under close observation until they are more satisfied with their condition , which is still described as &quot; serious &quot; .
the re@@ actions came from many quarters , including in the form of a massive online support from don@@ ald tr@@ um@@ p , mon@@ tel wil@@ liam@@ s and kel@@ ly ri@@ pa .
environmentally friendly vacu@@ um clean@@ ers and rising wages

amaz@@ on bu@@ ys t@@ wit@@ ch for $ 1.@@ 04 billion .
amaz@@ on just confirmed what information had reported on monday morning : the online re@@ tail@@ er - and video producer , and a lot of other things - bu@@ ys the video stre@@ aming service t@@ wit@@ ch for $ 1.@@ 04 billion ( $ 9@@ 70 billion ) .
the announcement comes as a surprise , not because nobody expected t@@ wit@@ ch to take over , but because it was widely believed that you@@ tube would acquire the company .
three months ago , it looked as if the sale of t@@ wit@@ ch to the video service of google had been decided for a cool billion , and the cooperation also seemed natural .
t@@ wit@@ ch , which was founded only three years ago as ju@@ st@@ in@@ .@@ tv , was launched as a general stre@@ aming service - a live version of you@@ tube .
instead , it quickly became a platform for players who released their bra@@ v@@ ura pieces in games , a &quot; you@@ tube for live games &quot; , according to an in@@ sid@@ er .
the t@@ wit@@ ch interface .
and &quot; let &apos;s play &quot; , a video gen@@ re in which , better to know , the ( mostly older ) games are a co@@ at of myster@@ y theater , are already very popular on you@@ tube .
it is the case that you@@ tube is often called when you want to describe t@@ wit@@ ch , so the news that you@@ tube t@@ wit@@ ch wanted to buy was somewhat bo@@ red .
it is a myster@@ y why the deal with you@@ tube was not made , because the company has re@@ porte@@ dly been prepared to pay as much as amaz@@ on .
all we know at the moment is this statement by em@@ met she@@ ar , president of t@@ wit@@ ch : &quot; we have chosen amaz@@ on because you are bound to our community , you share our values and long-term vi@@ sions .
another secret is , frank@@ ly , the incredible success of t@@ wit@@ ch .
for s@@ no@@ bs like me , who explain that they prefer to do sport than watch it , it is difficult to understand the attr@@ action that pre@@ sum@@ es to watch others while playing instead of even watching the control con@@ sole in their hands .
it is one thing to tell a friend about the shoul@@ der at 3 o &apos;@@ clock in the morning while she s@@ na@@ kes through resid@@ ent evi@@ l and something quite different to watch a sp@@ in@@ ning machine cr@@ ying like he did 20 times in a succ@@ ession .
you could just watch all these games now .
another problem is that many of the most popular games are now e@@ go games , so watching can be easy without having control over the perspective of the eye a good reci@@ pe for head@@ aches .
i admit that the rapid pass@@ ages into which the ro@@ ger ban@@ ni@@ sters of our electronic age have played whole games in record time are under@@ going a lot of fun .
but until a game or hum@@ or is there , his t@@ wit@@ ch channel is probably not so interesting .
but what do ske@@ p@@ tics like me know about it ?
t@@ wit@@ ch is called by 55 million different visitors per month and is the fourth largest source of internet traffic pe@@ aks .
and how exactly does amaz@@ on want to make money out of it ?
it is hard to imagine that t@@ wit@@ ch is so elegant in amaz@@ on inst@@ ant video , like you@@ tube t@@ wit@@ ch would have easily s@@ wal@@ low@@ ed .
but t@@ wit@@ ch has something that every company would like : thousands of young men who are adver@@ ti@@ sed as advertising customers .
as the chairman of t@@ wit@@ ch , she@@ ar , said , amaz@@ on and t@@ wit@@ ch &quot; both believe in the future of gaming , &quot; and the medium shows no sign of shr@@ ink@@ age , not even - not even .
at the h@@ ü@@ p@@ f@@ burg at the bur@@ g@@ gar@@ ten@@ fest , there was a lot going on saturday .
the organiz@@ ers &apos; concept was right .
despite the strong ra@@ in@@ casting on saturday evening , an estimated 1@@ 200 music fans came to the open-@@ air festival in the bur@@ g@@ gar@@ ten .
at times the entrance had to be stopped .
&quot; that was an@@ no@@ ying , &quot; said ron se@@ m , one of the organiz@@ ers .
sal@@ z@@ we@@ del l light and fun .
ma@@ xi@@ m sa@@ k@@ ra@@ j and ron se@@ m have chosen the name am@@ ula from two spanish words .
the open air in the sal@@ z@@ we@@ de@@ rer bur@@ g@@ gar@@ ten is supposed to show bri@@ ght@@ ness during the day and in the evening through various shows .
well , and the fun comes from alone .
this was evident on the early saturday , when the first visitors came to the open air .
the organiz@@ ers promised a party for all generations .
and they succeeded .
around the power stations on the bur@@ g@@ gar@@ ten@@ wi@@ ese , sal@@ z@@ we@@ del@@ ers , as well as guests from the nearby and wider surroundings , had made themselves comfortable .
they followed the first live performances , ro@@ lled with their feet in the clock , enjoyed cool drinks - in short : pure relaxation and enjoy@@ ment were the order of the day .
and that right across the generations .
while some people are sitting on the blan@@ kets on the specially car@@ ved white sand on the beach bar , others are sitting on a quarter of the wine in the vin@@ o@@ the@@ que , the young people were r@@ aging on the h@@ ü@@ p@@ f@@ burg .
but the voluntary workers in the field of child ma@@ ke@@ -up also had their hands full in the tru@@ est sense of the word to get rid of the crow@@ d and create imag@@ in@@ ative cre@@ ations in the small faces .
the larger ones used the k@@ ick@@ er tables or participated in a sk@@ ate@@ board workshop that the good@@ foot@@ -@@ crew from sal@@ z@@ we@@ del arranged .
until the great rain came .
shortly before 5.@@ 30 p.m. he pr@@ ou@@ dly pus@@ hed the visitors , especially families sought the wide and dry .
but this did not de@@ tr@@ act from the attr@@ acti@@ veness of the festival .
&quot; more people came than expected , &quot; said ron se@@ m , who spoke of &quot; success on the whole line &quot; .
therefore , there is no question of repe@@ ating the great party next year .
although work still needs to be done on the content and size of the event , se@@ m made it clear in a first record on sunday in front of the popular vote .
he described as an@@ no@@ ying that the admission had to be stopped .
obviously , the security company had been booked with too little effort .
as a result , some who had already paid did not get to the site .
the response was very good .
in a first careful es@@ timate , the sal@@ z@@ we@@ del@@ er co-@@ organiz@@ er spoke of about 1@@ 200 visitors who ro@@ c@@ ked in the castle garden .
there were problems with sound technology .
the hi@@ p-@@ hop band bloc@@ k@@ s@@ `@@ n@@ `@@ ro@@ x bro@@ ke their appearance un@@ ner@@ v@@ ously .
the techn@@ ici@@ ans were unable to produce a reason@@ ably reasonable sound .
the planned sh@@ ish@@ a loun@@ ges could not be built because the t@@ ents could not be moved to sal@@ z@@ we@@ del due to a ty@@ re break@@ down .
&quot; next year they will be there &quot; , says the organiz@@ er .
the first of the am@@ u@@ la@@ -@@ open-@@ air air was more than successful with the number of visitors .
and this in bad weather .
however , the organiz@@ ers have made some mistakes that will be dela@@ yed for the first time , but will have to be elimin@@ ated in the second edition .
also in the social network fac@@ e@@ book the organiz@@ ers must put criticism in .
&quot; sorry , but for 12 euros you simply expected more &quot; , says mel@@ ani@@ e me@@ i@@ er on the event page .
&quot; you have taken over a little bit of your time &quot; , says e@@ le zim@@ mer@@ mann at the same place .
others do not see the initial problems as closely as they might be .
i think it is very good that some people are not only tor@@ ment@@ ing st@@ up@@ id , but are also really trying to get something on their feet .
&quot; ste@@ ph@@ ani@@ e jen@@ ß wri@@ tes to am@@ ula .
now the organiz@@ ers have a year to stop these critic@@ isms .
new rad@@ om in ber@@ k@@ um : w@@ ach@@ t@@ berg ’ s land@@ mark sh@@ rank .
this is not , as expected , the case .
instead , the ready part is waiting for the installation into the distinc@@ tive building .
the action is in the context of a major measure : almost 50 years after the establishment of the ti@@ ra space observation rad@@ ar , the case , the rad@@ om , is completely renewed .
the new rad@@ om is produced with a di@@ ameter of 4@@ 7.@@ 5 metres slightly smaller than the old one .
the size of the camera is still world records .
the final step to complete the new case is the cap@@ ping exchange of the new case .
the upper part of the old case is separated and taken with a cr@@ ane .
after that , the last quarter of the new shell will be installed .
if the weather is playing , the action will take place at the beginning of this week .

the castle clubs will soon be pul@@ ling together again ?
finally , there was a constant cl@@ ash between the two wol@@ fr@@ at@@ sha@@ us@@ en bur@@ gun@@ dy clubs .
now the boards are thinking about possible cooperation .
as a model for the reconstruction of wol@@ fr@@ at@@ sha@@ us@@ en castle , the late richard di@@ mb@@ ath , former chairman of the wol@@ fr@@ at@@ sha@@ us@@ en bur@@ g@@ fre@@ un@@ de , led the project in gu@@ é@@ del@@ on , france .
a year ago , the climate between the castle club and the friends of the castle of wol@@ fr@@ at@@ sha@@ us@@ en was not good .
so far , the positions on the history of wol@@ fr@@ at@@ sha@@ us@@ en castle and possible reconstruction seemed to be very different .
now the two camps are moving towards each other : talks are to be held soon on a common approach .
the club boards tor@@ ste@@ n s@@ j@@ ö@@ berg ( bur@@ g@@ vere@@ in ) and her@@ bert pi@@ ff@@ l ( bur@@ g@@ fre@@ un@@ de ) confirm this on request of our newspaper .
&quot; i have called mr pi@@ ff@@ l and suggested that we could sit down once &quot; , s@@ j@@ ö@@ berg says .
in his view , all members of both clubs could in future be united again .
this will enable us to see visible results more quickly .
while the friends of the castle were trying to escape the su@@ dden death of richard di@@ mb@@ ath until the last moment , the castle on the mountain forest was re@@ built , the castle club around s@@ j@@ ö@@ berg stands for &quot; opening up &quot; and experience .
her@@ bert pi@@ ff@@ l , the second chairman of the bur@@ g@@ fre@@ un@@ de , was delighted with the call , according to his own data .
since di@@ mb@@ ath@@ s died , he has been before the bur@@ g@@ fre@@ un@@ de .
a new chairman is to be found in a general meeting in mid-@@ september .
currently , according to the 7@@ 4-@@ year-@@ old , the association has about 40 members .
&quot; after the death of my friend richard di@@ mb@@ ath , we have been doing the club activities out of respect for the first time &quot; .
according to pi@@ ff@@ l , the new chairman should then go into the discussion with the bur@@ g@@ vere@@ in .
until then , the friends of the castle could also see the mo@@ od in their group .
there is not yet a candidate for the presidency , says pi@@ ff@@ l .
&quot; but i am confident that someone will find himself &quot; .
the new chairman should be a wol@@ fr@@ at@@ sha@@ us@@ en .
the t@@ ö@@ l@@ zer wanted to work on the project &quot; but very much like to continue working &quot; .
the different positions on reconstruction are probably not going to be re@@ tained in pi@@ ff@@ l &apos;s eyes in the near future .
he hon@@ ors di@@ mb@@ ath as a mis@@ sion@@ ary who always believed in the reconstruction of the castle .
two similar projects , already well advanced in austria and france , would show that this idea is not a sh@@ amb@@ les .
the high level of participation of the population and volunte@@ ers from around the world make them a tourist mag@@ net .
pi@@ ff@@ l : &quot; i was also s@@ cep@@ tical at the beginning .
but over time , i have become more and more convinced that it makes sense to move the project forward , that it could be a &quot; one-@@ man &quot; feature for the flu@@ ff@@ er city .
there is nothing else here .
moreover , the project would be supported by eu grants , visitor tickets and potential spon@@ sors , pi@@ ff@@ l believes .
&quot; i personally do not want to throw away the idea of reconstruction &apos; , he hopes that the bur@@ g@@ vere@@ in will perhaps make some progress on this point .
their goal of initially docum@@ enting history is &quot; important and good &quot; .
we could then look further .
cle@@ ver ways to save money at university tex@@ t@@ books
since the cost of university tex@@ t@@ books is more than $ 1@@ ,000 per year for many students , the fa@@ st-@@ second sem@@ ester student mat@@ t sch@@ ro@@ e@@ der considered a cle@@ ver sp@@ ari@@ de@@ e .
he inven@@ ted a lo@@ an system for books by students of higher sem@@ ester and offered nom@@ inal compensation to facilitate the res@@ ale .
&quot; my mathem@@ a@@ tics book usually costs $ 18@@ 0 , but i got it for $ 10 for a sem@@ ester and a ch@@ ick@@ -@@ fil@@ -@@ a-@@ ke@@ ks , &quot; said sch@@ ro@@ e@@ der , 19 , which establish@@ es the co@@ ven@@ ant .
the books needed for the last sem@@ ester would cost him $ 4@@ 30 , he said .
he spent $ 120 .
the college administration informed students that on average more than $ 1,@@ 200 per year are spent on tex@@ t@@ books and study materials that students have different cost d@@ amp@@ ing options .
online shops and creative approaches such as sch@@ ro@@ e@@ ders are increasingly the solution of choice for students .
the ren@@ ting of tex@@ t@@ books is becoming more popular , and students can use a book for a sem@@ ester , often at a much cheaper price than when buying .
ne@@ e@@ bo inc , which operates more than 250 university book@@ stores , announced that ren@@ ting tex@@ t@@ books is a priority since 2011 .
surve@@ ys in the industry show that around a quarter of the books in the college book@@ stores were sold last spring sem@@ ester , said nee@@ bo@@ s vice president te@@ v@@ or me@@ yer .
less than half of all tex@@ t@@ books are produced by the national association of college stores in camp@@ us book@@ stores , according to the german association of commerce .
here is the one-@@ time for the best deals .
buy online
some new books cost online only one-@@ third of the price for which you are to have in the camp@@ us book@@ shop .
the n@@ in@@ th edition of &quot; calcul@@ us &quot; v@@ no ron lar@@ won , bru@@ ce ed@@ wards and robert ho@@ st@@ ler costs almost $ 2@@ 90 , but can be ordered at the specialized re@@ tail@@ er che@@ gg@@ .com for $ 9@@ 9.@@ 99 .
used to buy
if you are aware of the notes of other or normal trac@@ es of use , used books are a good option .
&quot; calcul@@ us &quot; is used on che@@ gg@@ .com for $ 9@@ 3.@@ 49 .
mat@@ t cas@@ a@@ day , 25 , gradu@@ ate student at bri@@ g@@ ham young university , says that he has to pay 42 c@@ ents on amaz@@ on@@ .com for a secon@@ d-@@ hand issue of &quot; strategic media deci@@ sion@@ s : &quot; .
the book has been sold for $ 48 .
aca@@ dem@@ ics like ing@@ rid br@@ ac@@ ey , head of the university of mass@@ ach@@ us@@ et@@ ts at am@@ her@@ st college without walls , recommended students to work with their prof@@ ess@@ ors to determine whether earlier issues had been included .
sometimes the updates are not relevant for the seminar work .
in such cases , older spending can often be spent for a fr@@ action of the cost of the latest edition .
besides che@@ g@@ g and amaz@@ on , hal@@ f@@ .com is a popular alternative for used books .
ren@@ ting a car
ren@@ ting tex@@ t@@ books is worth considering if you are dealing with them reason@@ ably well , thinking about returning them and putting them back in the books after the course has been completed .
you can pay more than 80 percent of the costs of a newly purchased book .
a student could , for example , use &quot; calcul@@ us &quot; for a sem@@ ester of about $ 20 .
find out about the terms and conditions of the business where you rent , including the fees that may apply to writing notes , support documents and other services .
the ren@@ ter pay attention : if you do not return the book , the penalty may even exceed the price of a new book .
e-@@ books
e-@@ books are also an option rather than traditional tex@@ t@@ books .
sometimes these books are de fac@@ to ren@@ ted by obtaining an electronic licence for a certain period of time by whol@@ es@@ al@@ ers such as amaz@@ on@@ .com , che@@ g@@ g and bar@@ nes &amp; no@@ ble inc@@ . .
at che@@ g@@ g you can use &quot; calcul@@ us &quot; for 6 months for about $ 61 .
br@@ ac@@ ey says that students in literature often find the best offers , since many classi@@ cs can be downloaded free of charge today , while scientific and engineering tex@@ t@@ books can be very expensive .
in any case , look around .
jo@@ e ga@@ ult , 29 , who will soon sho@@ ot the pe@@ p@@ per@@ d@@ ine law school , recomm@@ ends the is@@ b@@ n number for price determination in books , as you can be so sure to find the right book .
and before placing an online order , ga@@ ult said , you should check if the book is in stock .
he learned this lesson on the hard tour .
he bought a book that had four weeks delivery time and finally paid the full price in the collection book@@ shop .
why &quot; guar@@ di@@ ans of the gal@@ ax@@ y &quot; was not a cash bu@@ ff ?
&quot; the exp@@ end@@ ables 3 &quot; by sy@@ l@@ ves@@ ter st@@ all@@ one played less than $ 30 million of his 90 million u.s. budget , while &quot; s@@ in city : a lady to kill for &quot; was only $ 12 million .
the camera di@@ a@@ z film &quot; sex tape &quot; was released on the opening weekend only 14@@ .@@ 6 million dollars , while children &apos;s films like &quot; drag@@ on &apos;s eyes &quot; were made easy 2 &quot; .
an article by the te@@ leg@@ raph film cri@@ tic rob@@ bi@@ e col@@ lin suggests that children &apos;s films are not of the highest quality in the films themselves .
col@@ lin called 20@@ 14 &quot; the worst year &quot; for children &apos;s films and described &quot; dr@@ ach@@ en@@ ze@@ h@@ men le@@ ic@@ ht 2 &quot; as a purely &quot; functional &quot; fant@@ as@@ y sequ@@ el .
in films for a slightly older target group , however , it seems that the quality of the films is not necessarily the problem .
in july , entertainment weekly compared the average cinem@@ as@@ co@@ re-@@ me@@ tac@@ ri@@ tic rating for each summer film start , which is between the american mem@@ orial and the american film festival .
the results are based on the opinion of the cinema visitors and film cri@@ tics , and indicate that this year &apos;s film h@@ its are equivalent to last year &apos;s fil@@ m@@ making .
some comm@@ ent@@ ators believe that the development of changing visual hab@@ its and the growing popul@@ arity of web stre@@ aming services like net@@ f@@ li@@ x is due to the development .
director j@@ on fav@@ re@@ au , who is currently appe@@ aring on dis@@ ney &apos;s soon to be released jun@@ g@@ le book film , said to the website ho@@ ll@@ y@@ wood re@@ porter : &quot; i think the times are changing &quot; .
we must accept that and not try to follow the past .
unlike the weak cash out@@ comes of the ho@@ ll@@ y@@ wood produc@@ tions , net@@ f@@ li@@ x has recently generated revenues of the stre@@ aming content in the us $ 1.@@ 2 billion , almost double the amount .
last summer , director ste@@ ven spi@@ el@@ berg critic@@ ised the film studios for focusing too much on film produc@@ tions by com@@ ics and pro@@ p@@ he@@ si@@ ed a &quot; core mel@@ t@@ down &quot; of ho@@ ll@@ y@@ wood .
in the light of the current down@@ turn , some comm@@ ent@@ ators argue that his di@@ re pro@@ ph@@ ec@@ y could well contain a true core .
the potential cas@@ hi@@ er be@@ at@@ ings , including av@@ eng@@ ers : age of ul@@ tr@@ on , mini@@ ons , and jur@@ as@@ sic world , which are expected to be released in the summer of 20@@ 15 , are more optim@@ istic :
the producer of x-@@ men , sim@@ on kin@@ berg , described the decline in cash results recently as simply &quot; cy@@ clic@@ al &quot; and said to ho@@ ll@@ y@@ wood re@@ porter : &quot; next summer will be the largest summer at the cinema .
when the 2nd district table tennis club was closed a few years ago to ti@@ gh@@ ten the division of the league , this is a step in the right direction .
now the german table tennis league has added an additional 3rd bun@@ des@@ lig@@ a to its programme .
as a result , those who have not ris@@ en have des@@ c@@ ended .
g@@ ö@@ tt@@ ingen &apos;s highest team tor@@ pe@@ do has won the first prize in the ob@@ er@@ lig@@ a release , but it is playing only in fifth place in the coming season .
the fourth class of tor@@ pe@@ do ladies , despite their gran@@ di@@ ose march into the regional league , remain .
the bo@@ ys and girls of tor@@ pe@@ do start in the lower sa@@ x@@ ony league , as well as the bo@@ ys of the s@@ c we@@ en@@ end .
the s@@ g len@@ gl@@ ers and the tor@@ pe@@ do reserve are entering the new league of associations , in the national league are not go@@ et@@ t@@ inger clubs .
the tt@@ v ge@@ is@@ mar plays in the league of feder@@ ations , the tor@@ pe@@ do second in the league of the country .
what the composition looks like a better class of district is now the new district so@@ ber@@ league south .
here ts@@ v s@@ eu@@ ling@@ en , v@@ f@@ b l@@ ö@@ d@@ ing@@ sen , tor@@ pe@@ do iii , ge@@ is@@ mar , ein@@ bec@@ k , ham@@ en@@ ste@@ dt , bo@@ ven@@ der sv , lan@@ gen@@ hol@@ ten@@ sen , the f@@ c .
regional representatives of d@@ ran@@ s@@ fel@@ d and s@@ c we@@ en@@ end play in the district sli@@ ga , in the district class of tt@@ c ii , re@@ d-@@ white , the bo@@ ven@@ der sv ii and the tt@@ v teams .
g@@ ün@@ ter@@ sen , the tt@@ c and the tt@@ v ge@@ is@@ mar ii are here with the game .
tor@@ pe@@ do iii and sat@@ en@@ haus@@ en / w@@ ö@@ ll@@ mar@@ sha@@ us@@ en are starting in the district sli@@ ga .
with nine teams each , each of nine teams .
the s@@ c we@@ en@@ de sen@@ ds his girls to the small district sli@@ ga .
the district sli@@ ga squ@@ ad@@ ron of the sc@@ w bo@@ ys - tor@@ pe@@ do ii is still starting there - is not complete .
in a district class ge@@ is@@ mar , tus@@ po we@@ en@@ de and the bo@@ ven@@ der sv go into the season .
in the first season of the newly founded regional association the two g@@ ö@@ tt@@ ingen circu@@ lar teams start with nine teams each .
in the west season , the red / white ii , bo@@ ven@@ der sv iii , lau@@ bach ii , tor@@ pe@@ do iv and v , m@@ tv gr@@ one , d@@ ran@@ s@@ fel@@ der s@@ c ii , mi@@ el@@ haus@@ en .
in the east season , among others , s@@ att@@ en@@ haus@@ en / w@@ ö@@ ll@@ mar@@ sha@@ us@@ en , ni@@ ko@@ la@@ us@@ berg and land@@ ol@@ f@@ sha@@ us@@ en are playing .
the ladies kre@@ is@@ li@@ ga consists of s@@ ad@@ en@@ haus@@ en / w@@ ö@@ ll@@ mar@@ sha@@ us@@ en ii , bil@@ sha@@ us@@ en , hem@@ el@@ n , s@@ eu@@ ling@@ en ii , tus@@ po we@@ en@@ de and the s@@ g r@@ hu@@ me .
this is still better than in the o@@ ster@@ o@@ de district , where there are no women teams at the same time .
it is striking that none of the six 2.@@ circu@@ lar classes should reach strength , here the innovative and re@@ vol@@ ving board will have to think again .
nato summit : first pro@@ tests in new@@ port and car@@ di@@ ff
at the weekend , there were pro@@ tests from oppon@@ ents of the nato summit in new@@ port .
on saturday hundreds of people gathered in the centre of new@@ port for an anti-@@ nato march .
on sunday , about 150 people arrived in car@@ di@@ ff in front of the town hall to hold a so-called counter@@ -@@ summit .
ste@@ ph@@ en fair@@ cl@@ ough has followed the developments at the weekend and has spoken to demonstr@@ ators who have travell@@ ed to belgium from the very beginning .
te@@ en@@ ag@@ ers fle@@ w from the blue mountains and they were able to get their way to the mountains .
two young bus@@ h@@ wan@@ de@@ rers were safe@@ ly taken with the ro@@ pe win@@ ds after they had spent the night in the blue mountains in n@@ s@@ w .
the 16@@ -@@ year-@@ old girl and the 19@@ -@@ year-@@ old man bro@@ ke into the black sea shortly after sunday lun@@ ch@@ time in go@@ ve@@ t@@ ts lea@@ p .
wor@@ ried rela@@ tives called the police at about 8 p.m. when the two did not return home .
a local police and rescue team cr@@ ash@@ ed and the couple was killed by about 23 : 00 near the brid@@ al ve@@ il water@@ falls .
the girl had hur@@ t himself at her k@@ ne@@ e and the man had fallen and had be@@ aten his head .
rescue forces remained with the couple over@@ night , and they were fle@@ eing on monday morning .
they were in stable state with a am@@ bu@@ lan@@ ces in the blue mountains hospital .
anti-@@ government pro@@ tests in pakistan es@@ cal@@ ate
the approximately 1000 demonstr@@ ators were driven by soldiers from the p@@ tv building , said the information minister per@@ v@@ ai@@ z r@@ as@@ hi@@ d .
after about half an hour the broad@@ casting was re@@ sumed .
p@@ tv director ath@@ ar far@@ o@@ o@@ o@@ q said that the demonstr@@ ators equipped with stic@@ ks would have damaged equipment in the ed@@ it@@ orial .
the death or in@@ jury has not been reported .
the demonstr@@ ators are calling for the re@@ sign@@ ation of the head of government , to whom they acc@@ use of electoral fraud .
the police told to drive about a kil@@ ome@@ tre from the residence of prime minister na@@ wa@@ z shar@@ if it was again on monday cl@@ ash@@ es of around 3@@ 000 demonstr@@ ators with security forces .
according to hospital data , a polic@@ em@@ an was in@@ ju@@ red .
at the weekend , at least three people were killed and more than 500 were in@@ ju@@ red when demonstr@@ ators tried to inv@@ ade shar@@ if ’ s residence .
you are asking for the prime minister to resi@@ gn .
the powerful military had a very strong case on sunday evening after a meeting in the army headquarters .
the communication also said : &apos; the army remains committed to maintaining the security of the state &apos; .
es@@ cal@@ ating violence has s@@ ca@@ red about military intervention , which has already been more common in the past .
the political and economic crisis that the opposition politici@@ an im@@ ran kh@@ an and the pre@@ ach@@ er ta@@ h@@ ir@@ u@@ l q@@ ad@@ ri have been holding since independence day on 14 august .
shar@@ if ref@@ uses to resi@@ gn .
kh@@ an and q@@ ad@@ ri had called on their sup@@ porters to stay on sunday .
&quot; we will not go back without forcing shar@@ if to resi@@ gn , &quot; said kh@@ an .
q@@ ad@@ ri was similarly expressed .
kh@@ an acc@@ uses shar@@ if of having been won by fraud in may last year .
q@@ ad@@ ri calls for the re@@ sign@@ ation of central and provin@@ cial governments .
then a transitional government is to reform the electoral system and call for new elections .
more than 40 000 security forces are in operation to protect the district of government .
the demonstr@@ ators had initially stood before parliament peace@@ fully until kh@@ an and q@@ ad@@ ri met them for the weekend to vote on shar@@ if ’ s residence .
h@@ ü@@ t@@ tel@@ dor@@ fer will be ran@@ ked third in the table after second season victory .
with 2 : 0 over gr@@ ö@@ di@@ g has a bit@@ ter week for rapid on sunday a reconc@@ iling end .
&quot; victory is very liber@@ ating , &quot; said co@@ ach z@@ or@@ an bar@@ i@@ sic , whose team is compe@@ ting with the euro@@ pa league on thursday .
&quot; the success experience was incredi@@ bly important , &quot; said captain and tor@@ sch@@ ut@@ ze ste@@ ff@@ en ho@@ f@@ mann , who was on the ground three times with green white .
sch@@ ram@@ mel@@ -@@ dre@@ am@@ tor brings rapi@@ d to the winning road rapid , the second season victory has the right response to the dis@@ appointment with hel@@ sin@@ ki and is coming with a successful experience .
&quot; we wanted to show a positive reaction , &quot; said external def@@ en@@ der thomas sch@@ ram@@ me@@ l , who was the first to take part in the 14@@ th minute with his magnificent leadership vol@@ ley from the six@@ teenth corner .
&quot; i thought i had all the fru@@ stration of thursday and s@@ nor@@ ted him under the bar &quot; , said the 2@@ 6-@@ year-@@ old s@@ mil@@ ing .
when sch@@ ram@@ me@@ l was last released on november 13 , 2010 in a bun@@ des@@ lig@@ a game , it was still for ried .
the first championship meeting in the rapid d@@ ress is therefore a special memory .
&quot; for me this is something very special , i am from the young fast , &quot; said sch@@ ram@@ me@@ l .
due to the short-term p@@ ond b@@ less treatment of mari@@ o pa@@ ve@@ lic , sch@@ ram@@ me@@ l moved from the left to the right def@@ ensive side and made his thing very good there too .
he has had enough experience of being able to take this position in a mirror wrong way .
he deserves the ga@@ te@@ way , he has already done some assi@@ sts this year , &quot; p@@ raised bar@@ i@@ sic .
team shows character sch@@ ram@@ me@@ l also delivered the f@@ lan@@ k to 2 : 0 by ho@@ f@@ mann after about an hour that finally brought the decision .
the guests could have written to this effect .
&quot; thank god we have been lu@@ cky today &quot; , sch@@ ram@@ me@@ l also noted , who was thus able to draw attention to the gap between performance and result in recent weeks : &quot; the results did not vote , but the game was always played .
b@@ ari@@ sic even found that &quot; in many games before today &quot; it was better than it was today - &quot; against &quot; the strong@@ est team that played this season at this sta@@ dium &quot; .
the first tri@@ -@@ point since july 26 has therefore proved that the team structure is in a state of int@@ act despite the set@@ backs : &quot; today my team has shown that it has character &quot; .
it is no less pleas@@ ing for him : &quot; we have finally played to zero again &quot; .
a lot of work during the national break also means that bri@@ an beh@@ ren@@ dt , mari@@ o pa@@ ve@@ lic , chri@@ stop@@ her di@@ bon , den@@ i al@@ ar and michael sch@@ imp@@ el@@ s@@ ber@@ ger have been ex@@ posing several cases .
&quot; we must not forget this , &quot; bar@@ i@@ sic , who has been working with beh@@ ren@@ dt and pa@@ ve@@ lic players for the last three days , &quot; said bar@@ i@@ sic , &quot; who have been very stable recently .
the inter@@ mission of the national states must therefore be used to &quot; lic@@ k w@@ ounds and gain a little in the physical sphere &quot; , said b@@ ari@@ sic , who has won five u@@ 21 selection players in his own country .
one that is probably particularly suitable for the break is captain ho@@ f@@ mann .
he te@@ ars himself up for the team , goes over pain .
it has shown that , at this difficult time , he is a very important player for us , &quot; said bar@@ i@@ sic .
ho@@ f@@ mann gave the game rapi@@ ds before he was replaced in the 6@@ 8@@ th minute not only the structure , but also achieved the second goal .
for the 3@@ 3-@@ year-@@ old , who finished his 3@@ 50@@ th bun@@ des@@ lig@@ a match , it was the first match from the game since november 2nd , 2013 ( 4 : 2 via the ad@@ mir@@ a ) .
ho@@ f@@ mann : &quot; may not believe that everything is good now &quot; &quot; we have certainly had a little lu@@ ck , but at some point the lu@@ ck must come back to us .
now it was high time , &quot; said ho@@ f@@ mann .
he ad@@ mon@@ ished , however , that concentrated work would continue : &quot; you must not always see it in black and white .
we have not played as badly in recent weeks as has been described .
nor can we believe that everything is good now .
he was unable to deny the importance of his role in the team .
it is a very young team , and i can help very much at the moment .
they are keeping to me at certain stages , &quot; said ho@@ f@@ mann .
the first two weeks of the season were over , and the second was over .
he regre@@ t@@ ted the fast opposite &quot; from the magic gate category &quot; , as well as the regular nu@@ tz gate in the 40@@ th minute , which was un@@ ju@@ stly rejected by re@@ fe@@ ree colle@@ gger .
the only criticism i can make to the team is that we are heading towards tor in some ph@@ ases not being concrete enough .
we have had too few degrees on this .
internal def@@ en@@ der maxim@@ ili@@ an kar@@ ner saw it similar : &quot; it has just begun badly , but then we have found a ga@@ te@@ way and even made a goal .
by and large , it would have been more in it .
under this wh@@ ip , ru@@ h re@@ ign@@ s
we showed a powerful tri@@ be in our pu@@ zz@@ le task of the summer series &quot; my piece of rh@@ ö@@ ner lu@@ ck &quot; last friday .
several of these trees are still in the district , the copy is the &quot; s@@ cour@@ ge &quot; above the village below the under@@ white foun@@ tain .
a ti@@ l@@ ted foot@@ path leads up to the 600 year old o@@ ak .
it is past cou@@ ples , bas@@ alt cl@@ us@@ ter and bas@@ alt me@@ ado@@ ws .
a little bit below the bau@@ er@@ s@@ berg quar@@ ry , one kil@@ ome@@ tre north of the road to we@@ is@@ bach , there it stands .
vital looks like a natural mon@@ ument , it rises above the other trees in the area and with a size of more than eight meters it remin@@ ds of an american m@@ am@@ mo@@ th tree .
a small bud@@ d@@ ha on a tree tr@@ un@@ k suggests that it is a spiritual or my@@ s@@ tical place .
but despite intensive research , there were only references to the origin of the name .
dr. wol@@ f@@ gan@@ g sch@@ nei@@ der has specifically consulted the bis@@ ho@@ ps ’ home archive and consulted older people from un@@ ter@@ we@@ is@@ sen@@ brun@@ n to find out what the relationship with the s@@ cour@@ ge is .
the result of his research was the rather so@@ ber explanation for the name .
thus , until about 80 years ago , the go@@ at@@ she@@ ph@@ er@@ ds were to transport their animals from under@@ wel@@ ls to the lab@@ ori@@ ously ro@@ lled me@@ ado@@ ws , which were liber@@ ated from stones .
at the foot of the tree , the animal ke@@ ep@@ ers exhaus@@ ted by the as@@ cent should have rest .
in the meantime , the area has reg@@ a@@ ined its importance , because there are actually go@@ at@@ her@@ ds on me@@ ado@@ ws .
the area has also become the core of the bio@@ sphere reserve , sch@@ nei@@ der has further discovered .
when entering the stone collections , however , you should be careful , because the heat from the sun is the bas@@ alt , which is also a popular place for cru@@ ises .
a hiking trail leads from un@@ ter@@ wei@@ ß@@ en@@ brun@@ n to the tree , which is hidden a little bit .
other routes are sign@@ posted , the direction of ho@@ ch@@ r@@ ho@@ en is up and invite you to an extensive hi@@ ke .
where is the water@@ castle ?
a water@@ castle that is sought for our next task , however , is rather rare in height .
the mir@@ r@@ oring in the di@@ gging gives a good impression of the building , but we have some historic buildings in the district , which the building conf@@ ec@@ tion@@ ery could fit with .

after weeks of tu@@ g-@@ of-@@ war , italy ’ s premier and current eu chairman , mat@@ te@@ o ren@@ zi , has voted against strong conservative opposition at last week ’ s eu special summit to nom@@ in@@ ate his foreign minister , feder@@ ica g@@ her@@ ica mo@@ ore .
ren@@ zi , like the government newspaper la re@@ pub@@ b@@ lic@@ a , considers the voc@@ ation of his people as fav@@ ori@@ tes in government , as well as in the government team .
he also exp@@ ects an impe@@ tus for his &apos; reform package &apos; in italy .
last but not least , ren@@ zi hopes that the rec@@ ur@@ ring lef@@ t-@@ wing party base , which is against him , will be lif@@ ted , because mo@@ gh@@ er@@ ini will continue to support this , albeit in a more moderate way .
the conservative representatives , with president je@@ an-@@ cla@@ ude jun@@ ck@@ er and the po@@ les nom@@ inated as president-in-office of the council , will be , according to the prevail@@ ing opinion in rome , to achieve a political balance .
the eu &apos;s chief diplom@@ at will be depu@@ ty president jun@@ ck@@ er at the same time .
the pending approval of the european parliament is considered to be safe .
otherwise , president gi@@ or@@ gio na@@ polit@@ ano would have preferred the nom@@ ination of the 4@@ 1@@ year-@@ old politici@@ an of the ruling democratic party ( p@@ d ) to have little &quot; important recognition &quot; of italy &apos;s role in the eu .
la re@@ pub@@ b@@ lic@@ a is spre@@ ading optim@@ ism that the tried and tested and proven values of ambition in leading party offices for almost two decades will be able to rise to the &quot; enormous challenges &quot; .
the roman@@ s born in rome are married and have two dau@@ gh@@ ters .
her career in the party began in 1996 with a ph@@ d in the youth organization of the then democr@@ ati@@ ci di s@@ ini@@ stra ( lef@@ t-@@ wing democrats ) , which was in 2008 with the catho@@ lic centre party mar@@ ta mar@@ ti@@ lla .
in 1999 , mo@@ gh@@ er@@ ini became vice-president of the european community organization of soci@@ alist youth ( european young socialists ) for three years .
the election to the party council of the lef@@ t-@@ wing democrats in 2001 led to the high party politics , worked in the foreign policy department , which she soon became the head of .
it occupied traditional fo@@ cal points of italian foreign policy , such as the middle east , was supple@@ mented by nato missions studies in afghanistan , in which italy is involved with a tro@@ op cont@@ ingent , and maintained contacts with the social democrats in europe and elsewhere .
since 2008 she has been a member of the chamber of depu@@ ties , where she is an expert on defence and european and international affairs .
when ren@@ zi became prime minister in february 20@@ 14 , mo@@ gh@@ er@@ ini appointed his secretary of state .
if the p@@ d today has a better relationship with the country ’ s strong peace movement , which has won more than 40 % of the party ’ s vote in the eu elections in may , then , as is noted in p@@ d feder@@ ations , i@@ feder@@ ica .
the alleg@@ ations in brussels that the new eu foreign representative has too little diplomatic experience are therefore lacking in substance , and are being conf@@ used in the p@@ d .
in brussels , the european union is being held in a susp@@ icious manner , particularly by poland and the baltic states , with realistic acc@@ ents on the crisis in ukraine and is being described as &apos; a rus@@ si@@ an-@@ friendly course &apos; .
it supports the operation of the pipel@@ ine south stream , which is operated by the russian company ga@@ z@@ pro@@ m , through russian gas , by@@ passing ukraine directly to southern europe , which is also the case of italy &apos;s energy security .
after ren@@ zi took office as eu president in july , mo@@ gh@@ er@@ ini travell@@ ed to the country for her first state visit .
photos that they took with putin at sha@@ ke hands were received with indi@@ gn@@ ation in brussels , as well as that they were able to ap@@ point the kre@@ m@@ lin chief in october for a milan economic summit .
a total of nine young people completed their education at em@@ z-@@ han@@ au@@ er in n@@ ab@@ burg on monday .
among them is an az@@ u@@ bi who has already completed a different training in the company .
in the future , the new employees will be active in four training occup@@ ations : electronics ( three tra@@ ine@@ es ) , mec@@ hat@@ ron@@ ics ( two ) , tool mechan@@ ics ( two ) and process mechan@@ ics ( two ) .
all az@@ u@@ b@@ is come from the district of sch@@ wan@@ dorf : to@@ bi@@ as bra@@ un and thomas b@@ ü@@ cher@@ l from sch@@ war@@ z@@ ach , ste@@ fan br@@ ick@@ l and fl@@ ori@@ an re@@ wit@@ zer from sch@@ mid@@ ga@@ den , joh@@ ann@@ es be@@ re@@ wit@@ zer .
the new tra@@ ine@@ es previously visited primary or secondary schools and secondary schools .
from wednesday to friday , the tra@@ ine@@ es of all the years and the instruc@@ tors will be atten@@ ding a team training event in ob@@ er@@ am@@ mer@@ ga@@ u , where they will enjoy a full day hi@@ ke and ra@@ fting on the inn .

the socialists in france should &apos; keep their mou@@ ths and put france in order &apos; , said the main ally of fran@@ co@@ is hol@@ lan@@ de .
mr v@@ alls called on the deeply divided left to &apos; put their love &apos; to the controversial socialist president .
the president deserves respect to everyone , he deserves our loy@@ alty , he deserves our support .
&quot; it is our duty to stay with him , &quot; he said with great applause .
as a so@@ ber@@ ing ge@@ st@@ ure , the prime minister insi@@ sted that his government should not post@@ p@@ one the controversial 35 hour week in france , despite strong demands for a relaxation of em@@ manu@@ el mac@@ ron ’ s regime , the new economic minister .
on saturday , mr hol@@ lan@@ de ur@@ ged his co-@@ socialists to &apos; join together &apos; with the government .
but christi@@ ane tau@@ bi@@ ra , the minister for justice , has been pus@@ hing a stre@@ tch of sand into the wheel , at a meeting of re@@ neg@@ ade socialist members , and the socialist party critic@@ ised her for critic@@ ising her &quot; .
marine le pen , the far-@@ right leader of the national front , mo@@ c@@ ked the socialists ’ continuing p@@ uni@@ tive strugg@@ les and said that she could not imagine the new v@@ all ’ s government going through for more than a few months .
fran@@ co@@ is hol@@ lan@@ de is the emper@@ or without clothes , but prin@@ ce manu@@ el v@@ alls has no , they are forced to form a new government if the old one does not even survive a summer .
&quot; and the new will not survive autumn or winter , &quot; said fr@@ ä@@ u@@ le@@ in le pen towards sup@@ porters .
she repeated her party &apos;s call for parliament to be dis@@ ban@@ ded and said that she was confident that she would win in early elections and be ready to rule .
the ruling french party suffered a defe@@ at in the municip@@ al elections in march and the right-@@ wing national front was at the eu elections in may .
a survey in the sunday newspaper journal du di@@ man@@ che showed that 76 % of french people believe that the socialist group is in danger of being over@@ run by the end of the term .
pas@@ cal per@@ r@@ in@@ ea@@ u , a political scienti@@ st at sciences po university , war@@ ned that the french would quickly lose pati@@ ence if the new socialist group had no improvement in the economy and the record .
&quot; there is a small window of possibilities , but public opinion must quickly feel that things are changing , &quot; he war@@ ned .
otherwise , the situation could deterior@@ ate further .

the standing committee of the national people &apos;s congress adopted a framework law on sunday , which only allowed two or three candidates for the hong kong leadership election in 20@@ 17 .
all candidates must first seek majority support from a nom@@ ination committee , which is expected to work with pe@@ king@@ -@@ loy@@ al members .

putin is demanding ki@@ e@@ v to open &quot; state@@ hood talks &quot; with east ukraine .
russian president v@@ la@@ di@@ mir putin , according to russian media reports , on sunday demanded that the ukra@@ inian government stop fighting separ@@ ati@@ sts in the east and immediately start negotiations on the &quot; state@@ hood &quot; of the country .
his spo@@ kes@@ man , di@@ mit@@ ri pes@@ ko@@ v , later made it clear that putin did not mean that this would be the territory of the east ukraine under the control of the separ@@ ati@@ sts , but that his status vis@@ -@@ à@@ -@@ vis ukraine should be defined .
putin ’ s call to ki@@ e@@ v ’ s government to negotiate on an equal foot@@ ing with pro-@@ russian insur@@ g@@ ents f@@ its in with the one he has apparently pursued since the ri@@ ots began five months ago : help for separ@@ ati@@ st areas .
in an interview with the state television channel one , putin condemned the ukra@@ inian military campaign to re@@ con@@ qu@@ er the rights held by separ@@ ati@@ sts in the eastern regions of don@@ et@@ sk and lu@@ han@@ sk , which took place in march .
the kre@@ m@@ lin and separ@@ ati@@ sts have recently declared the territory they have taken as &quot; no@@ vor@@ os@@ si@@ ya &quot; or &quot; ne@@ o-@@ russia &quot; , a term that is remin@@ is@@ cent of the pre-@@ revolutionary shine of the russian empire .
putin pointed out that all those who have been involved in ukra@@ inian politicians ’ campaigns for the elections on 26 october , and while government groups are killing civilian communities in the areas that were kept by separ@@ ati@@ sts .
&quot; we need to start a detailed discussion immediately , not only on technical issues , but also on the political organisation of society and the state of south-@@ east ukraine , in order to protect the interests of the people living there , &quot; he said .
pes@@ ko@@ v said that putin ’ s reference to state@@ hood in the context of greater autonomy , which has been held for months by ki@@ e@@ v ’ s leadership , must be seen to address fears in rus@@ si@@ an-@@ speaking areas .
only the ukra@@ inian government can give the eastern regions the necessary autonomy , pes@@ ko@@ v said .
this is not about negotiations between ukraine and russia , pes@@ ko@@ v said , &apos; because it is not a conflict between russia and ukraine , but an internal conflict in ukraine &apos; .
the clari@@ fication of the kre@@ m@@ lin speaker to correct the pu@@ tin@@ i &apos;s &quot; mis@@ interpretation &quot; under@@ lined russia &apos;s leadership in dealing with separ@@ ati@@ st re@@ bel@@ lion in the east , unlike the direct threat of ne@@ po@@ tism .
moscow would have much greater difficulty in supporting the don@@ et@@ sk and lu@@ han@@ sk regions in eastern ukraine , as most of the 6.@@ 5 million inhabitants are not rus@@ sians and po@@ lls from the pre-@@ conflict period are a pre@@ domin@@ ance .
the autonomy that russian diplom@@ ats have mentioned in international forums would be a matter of power to regional governments in ukraine to negotiate their own trade agreements and external relations , thereby giving the kre@@ m@@ lin de fac@@ to control over an area of russian territory .
the peninsula , anne@@ xed five months ago in the black sea , is the home port for most of the russian na@@ vy , as well as an important commercial port and historic coastal region .
the regions between the r@@ ust area in russia and the cri@@ me@@ a are also rich in mines , fac@@ tories and foun@@ dri@@ es , which are important components for the russian military .
ukra@@ inian president pe@@ tr@@ o por@@ o@@ sh@@ en@@ ko proposed a new approach to the problem of ukraine during his speech on june 7 .
but his idea of autonomy seems to be in sharp contrast to that of the kre@@ m@@ lin and the separ@@ ati@@ st re@@ be@@ ls , whose arm@@ ing and inc@@ ar@@ n@@ ation is acc@@ using moscow .
putin ’ s last call to ki@@ e@@ v to work with separ@@ ati@@ st leaders on an equal foot@@ ing followed a further push by the re@@ be@@ ls in the past week , after russian troops and tan@@ ks had previously over@@ taken the soviet union .
the separ@@ ati@@ sts supported by russia took on a pal@@ e bar@@ gain , which , according to ukra@@ inian security officials , was the first step in a campaign to take over the strategic coastal region to cri@@ me@@ a , control no@@ vo@@ az@@ ov@@ sky .
that is why massive civil and military preparations have begun to protect mari@@ u@@ pol , a steel industrial port with 5@@ 00@@ ,000 in@@ hab@@ ited .
por@@ o@@ sh@@ en@@ ko spoke at a meeting of the eu leadership in brussels on saturday and ur@@ ged action to prevent another russian aggres@@ sion against ukraine , a former soviet republic , which has been under threat for 23 years .
&quot; we are on the ver@@ ge of a point where there is no return , &quot; por@@ o@@ sh@@ en@@ ko war@@ ned .
thousands of foreign troops and hundreds of foreign tan@@ ks are now on the territory of ukraine .
the eu summit did not decide on concrete actions , the leadership demanded further sanctions against russia , which would not be possible if the ukra@@ inian crisis es@@ cal@@ ated un@@ specified .
ukra@@ inian soldiers had to move back from their positions in il@@ o@@ wa@@ j@@ sk after two russian tan@@ k colum@@ ns and 1@@ ,000 soldiers entered the don@@ et@@ sk region last week to overcome the sie@@ ge separ@@ ati@@ sts .
the first probably 63 ukra@@ inian soldiers who were killed by the russian incur@@ sion in il@@ o@@ wa@@ j@@ sk were killed on sunday against 10 russian par@@ at@@ ro@@ op@@ ers who were killed on ukra@@ inian territory a week ago .

the film town is in ex@@ ci@@ tement after a series of clear photos of a na@@ ked j@@ enni@@ fer law@@ rence in a h@@ acking scand@@ al around cele@@ bri@@ ties on the internet .
the h@@ ack@@ er responsible for this may have 60 nu@@ de photos of law@@ rence , star of &quot; the tribute of pan@@ em &quot; and of super@@ stars , including the models k@@ ate up@@ ton and car@@ a le@@ e de@@ luxe .
the austr@@ ali@@ an ac@@ tress te@@ res@@ a pal@@ mer , em@@ ily brow@@ ning , y@@ v@@ on@@ ne stra@@ ho@@ v@@ ski , and g@@ rec@@ ko from mel@@ bour@@ ne sup@@ pos@@ ed@@ ly also published private photos on the basis of an ic@@ l@@ oud hole .
there are 10@@ 1 cele@@ bri@@ ties on the list .
the no@@ bl@@ est who had been bo@@ wed with g@@ rec@@ ko last month said to confid@@ ential : &quot; it is dis@@ gu@@ sting . &quot;
all private letters and pictures should remain private .
it is a sh@@ ame that private information has been sto@@ len and can be passed on to others .
g@@ rec@@ ko , currently in new york , re@@ porte@@ dly said that the h@@ ack is &quot; sh@@ ame@@ ful &quot; and that the people concerned feel &quot; hur@@ t &quot; .
the h@@ ack@@ er probably has 30 images of pal@@ mer with her ex@@ -@@ friend scot@@ t spe@@ ed@@ man , including two sho@@ ts in which it is up without lying in a pool .
pal@@ mers &apos; film works include &quot; love is inv@@ inci@@ ble &quot; with li@@ am hem@@ s@@ worth .
pal@@ mer , ch@@ uc@@ k-@@ star stra@@ ho@@ v@@ ski and ac@@ tress brown from suc@@ ker pun@@ ch stood yesterday for comments on the ch@@ op@@ ped images .
a representative law@@ rence said to t@@ m@@ z : &apos; it is a he@@ in@@ ous violation of privacy . &apos;
actors se@@ th ro@@ gen condemned the h@@ ack@@ er in his t@@ we@@ et : &quot; h@@ acked images from a mobile phone is nothing other than selling h@@ ats .

cy@@ cli@@ sts , jo@@ gg@@ ers and hi@@ kers were present yesterday at the 8@@ th cycling race on the gro@@ ß@@ e fel@@ d@@ berg and supported the &quot; hil@@ fe für kre@@ b@@ sk@@ ran@@ ke kin@@ der &quot; association .
the tour , which was a tor@@ tu@@ ous one for one , was a very easy training for the other .
however , one was all agreed : it was fun .
thomas stu@@ dan@@ ski may have sle@@ pt well last night .
for the first time in his life , the head of the ob@@ er@@ ur@@ sel@@ er bra@@ u@@ haus went on a bike yesterday to fel@@ d@@ berg .
for the good cause .
he can easily remove the small mus@@ cle cap , especially since he can ride on the 8@@ th cycling on the big fel@@ d@@ berg in fav@@ or of the association &quot; help for cancer children &quot; ( frankfurt ) .
a great thing .
&quot; i now know that i can - fine ! &quot;
small pu@@ zz@@ les on the way in the ap@@ ple@@ us@@ cur@@ ve ?
but if i had stopped , i would have been out ...
as thomas stu@@ dan@@ ski , who is responsible for the c@@ du in the upper ur@@ sel@@ le city parliament , many of the 7@@ 18 participants yesterday caught up in the early morning and came close to exhaus@@ tion , but happy to te@@ au .
others , on the other hand , found it easier to cross the well ele@@ ven kilometres long route between ho@@ hem@@ ar@@ k and fel@@ d@@ berg .
nor@@ man di@@ ess@@ ner , for example .
the green politici@@ an from the circle - red dre@@ ss , red d@@ ress , red bike - made a little more under@@ sta@@ te@@ ment ( &quot; every bit of professional , because there is arrived the goal ! &quot;
he too has gone through the course in a sli@@ de , as well as n@@ ina ku@@ hn , press spo@@ kes@@ woman of the city of ob@@ er@@ ur@@ sel , who has been making his way with frank gr@@ ün@@ iron .
the &quot; fel@@ d@@ berg cycling &quot; was not necessarily a sport@@ y challenge for the two tri@@ athle@@ tes : &quot; this is about char@@ ity , we are happy to be there - an exit we would have done anyway today &quot; .
on the way , they met paul w@@ en@@ z@@ el from ob@@ er@@ re@@ i@@ f@@ en@@ berg .
the boy ( 12 ) had gone down to ob@@ er@@ ur@@ sel in the morning to jum@@ p up the hill right after that .
the fl@@ ori@@ an or@@ nam@@ ent in frankfurt had moved to the sadd@@ le at 9 a.m. in the morning , &quot; made &quot; the fel@@ d@@ berg twice , then to roll home with fun .
also , &quot; fr@@ it@@ ten@@ -@@ ton@@ i &quot; had fun .
for the head of the upper ur@@ sel@@ le cul@@ t ki@@ os@@ k , cycling tours via fel@@ d@@ berg are just part of this .
he had a 6@@ ,@@ 5 kil@@ o race bike and he had been driving for 40 minutes .
a cra@@ zy event .
for this purpose - and i am happy to be there , &quot; said andre@@ as bal@@ z@@ ke .
the sophisticated main@@ zer says he is a &quot; ambitious racing bike &quot; .
it must be , because it was connected with the &quot; fix@@ y wheel &quot; , which are also racing bi@@ kes , but without circuit ...
the fact that it went up without a wheel , not only did the 20 hi@@ kers who clim@@ bed the white wall and the fu@@ ch@@ stan@@ z up to the summit , but also a jo@@ gger who was at a cor@@ d .
hi@@ ke doctor professor vol@@ ker lis@@ ch@@ ke , who is equipped with his team , equipped with all@@ rad@@ -@@ bul@@ ly and qu@@ ad , for safety , said : &quot; the ken@@ n &quot; i from frankfurt , who trains .
the 7@@ 18 participants - and thus as many as never before - had been sent into groups in the morning .
the hi@@ kers first at 9.@@ 30 am .
the first cy@@ cli@@ sts and run@@ ners followed at 10 a.m.
five minutes later , the first mountain bi@@ kers started off .
b@@ ent han@@ sen , chairman of the association &quot; cycling on the great fel@@ d@@ berg &quot; , gave the comm@@ ands and wanted the participants a nice trip .
for next year he hopes that it will be possible to go up the road to fel@@ d@@ berg to ensure the safety of the participants .
