re@@ member@@ ing the very american ideal of labour rights as human rights
congress me@@ p ke@@ ith el@@ lis@@ on and john le@@ w@@ is have put forward a legislative proposal to make trade unions more civil rights .
&quot; just as unions die , so do middle class jobs , &quot; said el@@ lis@@ on , a democr@@ at from min@@ n@@ es@@ ot@@ a and ste@@ ward jo@@ s@@ é mar@@ t@@ í@@ n .
i am therefore proud to present , together with the citizens &apos; rights si@@ k@@ one john le@@ w@@ is , the staff authorisation act .
this gr@@ ound@@ breaking law gives workers the same legal opportunities in the event of discrimination on the grounds of the organisation of trade unions as in other forms of discrimination - and thus stops anti-@@ trade union forces .
the addition of the national labour law law to provide a possibility of discrimination against workers employed to organise a trade union representation to protect themselves against discrimination in a civil court - and to seek compensation for damages or penalties .
but it is certainly not a radical initiative - at least not according to american standards .
indeed , the best way to understand what el@@ lis@@ on , le@@ w@@ is , and the other spon@@ sors of their legislative proposal , is to re@@ connect to a very american idea .
despite the set@@ backs that the unions have suffered in recent years - in wis@@ con@@ s@@ in , mic@@ hi@@ gan and other states throughout the country - americans once welcomed countries around the world .
there was a time when millions of americans remember when this country was building democracy , freedom of speech , freedom of the press and the right to association in one bre@@ ath .
when the united states occupied japan after world war ii , general dou@@ gl@@ as mac ar@@ th@@ ur and his staff encouraged the country to adopt a constitution that would ensure that the country ’ s milit@@ ari@@ zed auto@@ cr@@ acy he@@ d@@ ki was free .
fully aware that workers and their trade unions are playing a key role in creating a new japan , they used a language that explicitly states that the world is &quot; the rights of workers on unification and common mer@@ ger and action .
when the united states occupied germany after world war ii , general d@@ wi@@ ght david e@@ is@@ en@@ ho@@ wer and his staff ur@@ ged the german@@ s to write a constitution that would ensure that fas@@ c@@ ism was hit@@ ol@@ f hit@@ s .
recogn@@ ising that workers would have to organise themselves and their voice in the new nation , i added the german government clause to the effect that the workers should speak explicitly .
agreements that restrict or aim to restrict this right are not acceptable .
when the former first lady ele@@ an@@ or roo@@ se@@ vel@@ t was in the chair of the international commission on human rights , which adopted the universal declaration of human rights , as it was adopted by the united nations in 194@@ 8 as a global agreement .
for generations , americans have accepted the basic pre@@ mise that labour rights are human rights .
when this country told other countries how to use civil and democratic societies , the americans declared that the right to freedom of establishment was not a right - and that these unions were then bound by collective bar@@ gaining as equ@@ als .
after these rights were under attack in america , it is indeed very wise to re@@ think the american ideal , which is that working people should have the right to move .
as pa@@ st@@ or martin lu@@ ther king j@@ r. said fif@@ ty years ago :
history is a great teacher .
now everyone knows that the workers &apos; movement cannot restrict the strength of the nation , but increased it .
by raising the standard of living of millions of people , work has mir@@ ac@@ ul@@ ously created a market for industry and has brought the entire nation to un@@ imag@@ in@@ able levels of production .
those who attack the work forget these simple tru@@ ths , but history preser@@ ves them .
history re@@ members , and we should do so .
formal recognition of labour rights as human rights - and the extension of the protection of citizens &apos; rights as a protection against discrimination in the creation of employee representatives - is long over@@ due .
ke@@ ith el@@ lis@@ on and john le@@ w@@ is re@@ new the ide@@ als that america has made great in the past and that have re@@ deemed the promise of democracy .
jud@@ ges tempor@@ arily stops law that all abor@@ tion clin@@ ics in lou@@ i@@ si@@ ana are forced to close .
a us federal judge stopped the implementation of a law in lou@@ i@@ si@@ ana on sunday , which lawyers have said is not likely to close down all five accounts .
this measure , which was taken by bo@@ b@@ by j@@ in@@ dal , govern@@ or of lou@@ i@@ si@@ ana , in june , and which was launched on 1 september , would be used by doctors who are taking abor@@ tions .
the judge &apos;s decision , however , means that doctors are still legally required to carry out abor@@ tions for the time being while they are applying for such a right .
&quot; the pla@@ in@@ ti@@ ffs may continue to work according to the law while they seek to obtain these rights , &quot; wrote bun@@ des@@ rich@@ ter john de@@ gra@@ vel@@ les in his judgment .
a hearing will be held within a month for the judge to establish a lasting legal decision .
pro-@@ abor@@ tion sup@@ porters welcomed the decision to include the most recent in a series of jud@@ gments against similar measures , saying that doctors had given more time to re@@ sume hospital ad@@ missions .
&quot; today &apos;s decision means that women in lou@@ i@@ si@@ ana are subjec@@ ted to a v@@ ile law that depri@@ ves them of their health and rights , &quot; said n@@ ancy nor@@ th@@ up , president and chair of the centre for re@@ productive rights ,
it was not immediately clear whether the judgment would also apply to doctors from the two clin@@ ics who had been involved in the law@@ suit and were also able to give permission .
lou@@ i@@ si@@ ana is one of 11 states that have en@@ acted similar laws , with the courts recently adopting such measures in al@@ ab@@ ama and missi@@ ssi@@ pp@@ i as un@@ constitutional .
key points of a law in tex@@ as that covers most of the clin@@ ics left in the state to close were taken up by a federal judge on friday .
ad@@ voca@@ tes of abor@@ tion and the american college of o@@ stre@@ tr@@ ici@@ ans and gy@@ nec@@ o@@ logi@@ sts , as well as the american medical association , agree that en@@ qui@@ ries should be granted by doctors without any unnecessary restrictions .
oppon@@ ents of abor@@ tion argue that measures are contrary to the protection of women &apos;s health , although some also have the effect of closing down clin@@ ics .
only a doctor who is abor@@ ting in lou@@ i@@ si@@ ana has patients &apos; in@@ im@@ itable rights , partial or complete treatment .
if all other doctors in the state are forced to stop abor@@ tion , that doctor would be forced to take sur@@ gery for fear of his safety , the group said .
in argu@@ ing against the ver@@ dic@@ t , representatives of the state of lou@@ i@@ si@@ ana said that they would not be pen@@ alising doctors for carrying out abor@@ tions while their applications for patients &apos; in@@ duc@@ tion rights were still pending .
dela@@ yed diagno@@ sis and lack of access to the best treatment options lead to higher death rates from o@@ vari@@ an cancer in rural areas .
angel@@ ina jo@@ lie and her brother james have a video hom@@ age for her mother online , which was sent to ei@@ er@@ stoc@@ king cancer in 2007 .
for women in australia &apos;s rural areas , there is a greater risk of dying of o@@ vari@@ an cancer than for women in cities .
researchers analy@@ zed the medical data of more than 1@@ 100 austr@@ ali@@ ans , in which in 2005 eg@@ g growth cancer was detec@@ ted , and found that only 25 percent were diagno@@ sed at the time of diagno@@ sis .
the research director sus@@ an j@@ ord@@ an of q@@ im@@ r ber@@ g@@ ho@@ fer medical research institute said that for those who live in rural and remote regions of the state , the ster@@ ili@@ zation process is ris@@ ky .
small study : new drugs could cause l@@ ung and eg@@ g stock cancer to slow down .
researchers investig@@ ated women ’ s health care for seven years .
dr. j@@ ord@@ an said that the age of a woman in diagno@@ sis , the type of eg@@ g stock cancer , existing pre-@@ diseases as well as social and economic status also increase the chan@@ ces of survival .
for older women and those whose cancer is already on the way to diagno@@ sis , the disease was in the worst condition for survival .
for those who live in rural and remote regions of the state , mort@@ ality rates were lower than in the study .
although the study did not examine why women living outside the city are more likely to suffer from o@@ vari@@ an cancer , it is estimated that dr. j@@ ord@@ an has been diagno@@ sed late and has not been given access to the best treatment centres .
&quot; this disease is best treated by gy@@ na@@ eco@@ logi@@ sts , and these are usually found in larger cities , &quot; she said .
despite the improvement of the medical services in order to counter di@@ stances , it proposed as a possible re@@ me@@ dy a strengthening of the service of in@@ coming doctors to provide specialists with the opportunity to di@@ gi@@ tiz@@ e women to their place of residence .
dr. j@@ ord@@ an said that the study , regardless of geographical status , has a poor long-term survival rate for women in o@@ vari@@ an cancer and under@@ lined the need for better treatment and treatment .
the rio t@@ into ride to con@@ qu@@ er cancer funding is now being published in the medical journal of australia .
in march 2013 , el@@ ish@@ a ne@@ a@@ ve , a young mother of 33 years of gold coast , learned that she had an aggres@@ sive form of o@@ vari@@ an cancer .
garden centers regret dec@@ lining house owners , with the number of homes dec@@ lining ,
the decline , together with a growing decline in the number of home@@ owners under 35 years of age , could result in tens of thousands of p@@ ounds being lost each year if today &apos;s young consumers are forced to pay for their services following a h@@ ta study , as reported in the financial journal .
the report states that , on average , ten@@ ants spend 55 % of the amount that people with their own homes spend on their garden .
the increase in people living in highly ur@@ ban@@ ized areas without gardens , the popular procedure , front gardens to park purposes for asp@@ th@@ al@@ ate and the dec@@ lining garden size are further factors that are driving the industry .
in the london metro@@ politan area , where the share of home@@ owners in london rose from 61 to 43 % over a period of 6 years , the lowest spending on garden products per household is reported .
the h@@ ta and royal hor@@ tic@@ ul@@ tural society point out that the living to rent is a small garden or a house that does not mean that people can not move plants .
gu@@ y bar@@ ter , chief gar@@ den@@ er for the r@@ r@@ us said : &quot; contain@@ er gar@@ den@@ ers are very popular with ten@@ ants , for example , because they can take their plants with them in a move &quot; .
the h@@ ta report identified the period between 1997 and 2005 as the &apos; golden age &apos; of the retail garden as a result of rising home ownership and economic prosperity from the late 1980 ’ s to the mid-@@ 1990 ’ s .
he predic@@ ted that a further increase in the market situation this year would be due to the better weather conditions in march and april last year .
the political will , which was expressed by the opposition politici@@ an im@@ ran kh@@ an and the cl@@ er@@ ical ta@@ h@@ ir@@ u@@ l q@@ ad@@ ri , is continuing .
in the capital islam@@ ab@@ ad , about 1000 demonstr@@ ators have been watching p@@ tv , the state television station .
information minister per@@ v@@ ai@@ z r@@ as@@ hi@@ d said that soldiers had sent the prote@@ sters back out of p@@ tv buildings .
the trans@@ mit@@ ter set up its operation for about 40 minutes , but is now sending back .
at the same time , around 3@@ 000 demonstr@@ ators tried to return to prime minister na@@ wa@@ z shar@@ if ’ s residence .
about a kil@@ ome@@ tre away , they supplied themselves with po@@ les and stones cl@@ ash@@ es with security forces .
the police interven@@ ed in te@@ ar gas .
the demonstr@@ ators called for shar@@ if ’ s re@@ sign@@ ation , but he ref@@ uses to do so .
the country ’ s army is ur@@ ging a political solution to the conflict , &apos; without wa@@ sting time and using force &apos; .
after a meeting at the headquarters on sunday evening , the military announced : &quot; the army remains committed to its role in ensuring the security of the state &quot; .
the military plays an important role in pakistan and has already repeatedly put on the spot .

turkey orders us diplom@@ ats for sp@@ y reports .
the turkish foreign ministry has sent the most senior us diplom@@ at to the country to report a report on american and british es@@ pi@@ on@@ age in turkey .
vice-president b@@ ü@@ l@@ ent said that the us emb@@ ass@@ y ’ s business and turkish officials discussed the report on monday .
the german magazine der spi@@ e@@ gel as well as the online magazine the inter@@ cep@@ t reported that the results of the previous us analy@@ st of the national security agency , ed@@ ward snow@@ den , show that turkey is a major activity area for turkey .
according to turkish news agencies , the turkish president , rec@@ ep ta@@ y@@ y@@ ip er@@ do@@ gan , played the importance of the report , saying that all the major countries must mu@@ tually play .
an earlier report that the most important intelligence service in germany also targeted an@@ kar@@ a caused much confusion .

there are no regional priorities .
the main thr@@ ust of the warning strike is freight transport .
the deutsche bahn in n@@ r@@ w announced that it would do everything possible to minim@@ ize the impact .
however , the g@@ d@@ l did not say where it wanted to strike , so it is difficult to predic@@ t the consequences in concrete terms .
police chief of mag@@ alu@@ f accused of corruption
the prosecu@@ tors sent a letter to the office of the public prosecu@@ tor of mall@@ orca on friday for black@@ mail by police officers and employees of the city of cal@@ vi@@ à .
the head of the police of cal@@ vi@@ à on the island of mall@@ orca was arrested after acc@@ us@@ ations of corruption by business@@ men and cash owners in the not@@ ori@@ ous b@@ ing@@ e-@@ drinking hot@@ spot mag@@ alu@@ f .
prime minister jo@@ s@@ é ant@@ oni@@ o na@@ var@@ ro was arrested after acc@@ us@@ ations of corruption against him by several business@@ men from pun@@ ta b@@ all@@ ena , the street where most bars and night@@ clubs of mag@@ alu@@ f are located .
according to the online daily mall@@ orca di@@ ario , the prosecu@@ tors handed over to the office of the prosecu@@ tor for the fight against corruption in mall@@ orca on friday evidence of black@@ mail by police officers and employees of the city of cal@@ vi@@ à .
two other local police officers were arrested by the spanish civil guard in connection with the corru@@ pt orders of the city .
the national spanish daily ab@@ c reported that the an@@ gr@@ y night@@ club owners are saying that they had been ve@@ t@@ tering .
&quot; it is no longer about making money , it is about survival , &quot; said one of the business@@ men to the court .
let our live@@ li@@ hood be put out of the game .
we have nothing to lose .
mag@@ alu@@ f made a mistake this summer because of a vir@@ al you@@ tube video , in which a 18@@ -@@ year-@@ old british tourist from the uk was shown to be working on 24 men during a sho@@ oting .
since then , the island authorities have tried to prevent the illegal behaviour of alcoho@@ lic holi@@ day@@ makers in mag@@ alu@@ f by preventing the number of participants in the not@@ ori@@ ous alcohol drink .
the play@@ house club , where fel@@ la@@ ti@@ o happened , was designed for one year to close , while play@@ house and the k@@ nei@@ p@@ p to@@ wers were forced to close for a year .
the tourist resort of mag@@ alu@@ f , which is popular with young british tourists , is also popular for many accidents involving alcohol .
the first day of spring with we@@ t and stor@@ my weather conditions affects flights from ade@@ la@@ ide airport .
spring has a winter season in southern italy .
in the evening until 9 p.m. , another 5@@ mm rain fell on the city , after 6.@@ 6@@ mm , which was already falling down on sunday at night .
the last pre@@ cip@@ itation was the result of a series of short , stor@@ my sho@@ wers , including a cast that began just before 8 p.m. and was bur@@ ied in about 10 minutes for almost 4@@ mm pre@@ cip@@ itation .
after winter last week for an early do@@ se of spring had taken place , the temperatures in the city fell on monday again to a maximum of only 15@@ .@@ 8 ° c .
the bad weather conditions have probably led to the late lan@@ ding of a flight from vir@@ gin airlines from mel@@ bour@@ ne to ade@@ la@@ ide .
the aircraft could have lan@@ ded shortly after 19@@ .@@ 30 , but was hit by a win@@ ds - a su@@ dden change in wind speed or direction over a short distance - and had to start through .
wind sho@@ ots reached about 50 km / h on the ground at ade@@ la@@ ide airport at this time .
the flight data showed that the aircraft could also be carried out on a second lan@@ ding , and finally it was stopped at around 8.@@ 40 p.m.
the flight delay subsequently led to the delay of some other flights , including an em@@ i@@ rates flight from du@@ ba@@ i and a qu@@ ant@@ as flight from sy@@ d@@ ney .
for ade@@ la@@ ide , a maximum temperature of 16 ° c is predic@@ ted on tuesday , with possible sho@@ wers .
mat@@ th@@ ies says : it is high time to link up a lot of time to the network .
given the gal@@ lo@@ ping technical progress that has made our cosy home in high-@@ tech environments , we are now in a position to make the world a more con@@ sol@@ ing space for our colum@@ n@@ ist ber@@ nd mat@@ thi@@ es .
as i write this here , my view of the spir@@ al cable that drives the list@@ en@@ er to the phone is striking , and i think : bo@@ ah , like re@@ tr@@ o is that ?
but there is a thought behind this : if the cable was not , all hearing aids would be wi@@ ped out in the house in the shor@@ test time , and that would be significantly more re@@ tr@@ o .
in any case , the ec@@ lec@@ tic ( ec@@ lec@@ tr@@ onic ?
no , ty@@ po@@ s : electronic ) sector the rule that today &apos;s world nov@@ el@@ ty is the electric sc@@ ra@@ p of tomorrow , bought - out@@ dated .
and if you are looking for a tv in your living room today , for example , you simply say that you are fundament@@ ally opposed to television .
why do these considerations ?
because we are not aware of the i@@ fa &apos;s cr@@ ack@@ down on the radio tower this week again , our absolute in@@ competence in electronic matters .
the lay@@ man , who used to be blind mas@@ ch@@ ine and cd player , does not even understand the purpose of the devices that are equipped with in@@ con@@ cei@@ vable expert spre@@ ads before him .
yes , is it still possible ?
what is it about talking to people who seem to be volun@@ tar@@ ily spre@@ ading such quar@@ k ?
after all , for about 20 years now , the main thing is that we are pleased to connect our house .
to make the yo@@ gh@@ ur@@ t look after itself , so that the fire detec@@ tor can help us during the holiday in the mal@@ di@@ ves , that it is burning in the working room degrees .
and would it not be wonderful if we could have air conditioning from our office to arrive in the near future ... ?
yes , however , this requires air conditioning .
but a dream will certainly come true soon : we raise our watch , say your l@@ oud &quot; suc@@ k ! &quot; - and at home the d@@ ust vacu@@ um robo@@ t goes off .
wrong .
everything is in no way a revolution : &apos; the boundar@@ ies between white and brown goods are bl@@ ur@@ ring &apos; , ra@@ un@@ t a sec@@ tor@@ -@@ conscious , you can cut the washing machine with a head@@ phone , which is connected to the camera .
we also know from everyday practice that if a new device is really needed urgently , it is guaranteed that the battery will be empty .
another reason is that the spir@@ al cable is also connected to the next radio exhibitions .
israeli children return to gaza after the war .
thousands of israeli children from the areas near gaza strip are returning to israel on monday .
the school launch brought the country affected by ro@@ cket laun@@ ching ho@@ les in southern israel a sense of joy and expec@@ tation , but the signs of fighting are still fresh .
in the southern city of ash@@ do@@ d , staff of the &quot; pas@@ ho@@ sh &quot; kin@@ der@@ gar@@ ten , who was hit by a missi@@ le , were removed before the students met gran@@ ate sh@@ ards from the walls and sli@@ ding sho@@ wers .

many children from our area urgently need a return to rout@@ ine .
her 1@@ 1-@@ year-@@ old daughter sh@@ ani b@@ art said it feels &quot; a bit com@@ ical &quot; to be suddenly re@@ born in the school .
&quot; these were difficult times , and we did not go out of the house at all , &quot; she said .
president re@@ u@@ ven ri@@ v@@ lin visited the ki@@ b@@ but@@ z near the gaza border to offer his support .
until a ce@@ as@@ e@@ fire ended last week , thousands of people living in border communities such as sa@@ ad remained in their homes or left their homes to live in sa@@ fer areas further away from gaza .
many na@@ h@@ al o@@ z inhabitants , a municip@@ ality near the border with gaza , where a 4-@@ year-@@ old boy was killed by a palestinian k@@ ill@@ er .
the ministry of education announced that about a do@@ zen families have not returned .
their children have been tempor@@ arily hou@@ sed in other schools .
prime minister ben@@ jam@@ in net@@ any@@ ah@@ u attended a school in s@@ der@@ ot , a border town on gaza , which was se@@ ve@@ rely affected by the palestinian sho@@ ck .
he called on the children to learn a lot and said &apos; we will make sure that their knowledge is acquired and offer you security &apos; .
israel and hamas agreed last tuesday to an open-@@ ended peace treaty .
the ce@@ as@@ e@@ fire has brought an immediate end to the fighting , but important problems remain un@@ resolved , as hamas ’ s call for the isra@@ eli@@ -@@ egyp@@ tian bloc@@ k@@ ade of gaza and the re@@ opening of the a@@ e@@ ge@@ an and sea ports .
israel is calling for the dis@@ arm@@ ament of hamas and the transfer of the bodies of two israeli soldiers killed in the fighting .
a new round of indirect talks is expected to take place in egypt this month .
in the war , more than 2,@@ 100 palestinians were killed , three quarters of them civili@@ ans , and at least 4@@ 94 children , according to estimates by the palestinians and the un .
israel den@@ ies this information and estimates that at least half of the deaths are from violence .
on the israeli side , 66 soldiers and six civili@@ ans , including a th@@ ai work@@ er , have been killed .
hamas and other gaza figh@@ ters fi@@ red 4@@ ,@@ 5@@ 91 missi@@ les and mur@@ dered sh@@ ell@@ s during the fighting on israeli cities .
meanwhile , the israeli military carried out more than 5@@ ,000 air and other attacks .
the israeli attacks damaged or destroyed thousands of homes in the gaza area and about 2@@ 50@@ ,000 people were searching for peace in more than 100 un schools that were provi@@ sion@@ ally located .
while tens of thousands of people continue to live in the shel@@ ter and continue fighting , educational authorities last week postpon@@ ed the start of the school year .
&quot; i hope the school is soon re@@ opened so that we can continue learning , just as the children in the world and the jewish children , &quot; said mo@@ ham@@ ma@@ d am@@ ara , a 13@@ -@@ year-@@ old boy who is currently in prison .

berlin - according to the c@@ du federal vi@@ ze thomas stro@@ b@@ l , the current prohibi@@ tion proceedings against the n@@ p@@ d should be brought to an end in the federal constitutional court .
&quot; the n@@ p@@ d cuts worse than last time , &quot; stro@@ b@@ l said , who also uses c@@ du as head of state in bad@@ en-@@ w@@ ür@@ t@@ tem@@ berg , the &quot; le@@ ip@@ zi@@ g fol@@ k newspaper &quot; .
this is a welcome development in the right direction and a development that should lead me to the conclusion that we should not forget the n@@ p@@ d politically and not before the constitutional court .
the n@@ p@@ d was very close to the fi@@ ve-@@ percent h@@ ul@@ l during sunday ’ s vote .
a first attempt to ban the extreme right party was failed in 2003 , because the constitutional protection was also en@@ shr@@ ined in the n@@ p@@ d top .

har@@ burg : t@@ ents for new refugees
refugees are now being placed in new countries in t@@ ents .
the central initial reception for refugees in har@@ burg is bur@@ sting out of all se@@ ams .
now the internal authority has put three t@@ ents of the red cross on the spot .
the district politicians were informed just a moment before - they are not very enthusi@@ astic .
&quot; these ha@@ ur@@ uck actions further fuel reservations among citizens and give the district politicians no opportunity to engage construc@@ tively in the human accommodation of refugees .
your party calls for the district administration of har@@ burg to be able to use un@@ used houses for accommodation at the moment .
96 refugees can be accommo@@ dated in the three t@@ ents .
the reasons for the over@@ crow@@ ding in the initial photo are the stor@@ m of people looking for help - and the fact that the authorities do not have enough places in follow-up facilities .
many refugees therefore remain longer than the regular three months .
house prices have increased the strong@@ est increase in winter in seven years , showing a widely observed index .
r@@ p data co@@ re@@ logic he@@ don@@ ic home value index for home and office owners in australia .
this increase puts the total increase in june , july and august at 4.@@ 2 % , the biggest increase in the winter months since 2007 .
the annual price increase was 10.@@ 9 percent , more than twice the price of the us dollar ’ s rise in the 12 months to august 2013 , but the increases were not even@@ ly distributed across the country .
the research director of r@@ p data , ti@@ m law@@ less , announced that sy@@ d@@ ney and mel@@ bour@@ ne had a two-@@ ti@@ er market .
r@@ p data ’ s figures show that house prices in sy@@ d@@ ney were up by 16@@ .@@ 1 % last year , and that in mel@@ bour@@ ne by 11.@@ 7 % .
the following markets are ade@@ la@@ ide , br@@ is@@ ban@@ e and dar@@ win , where prices are on average five and six percent higher .
at the other end of the scale is can@@ ber@@ ra , which is hard hit by the cuts in government spending , where prices are down by only 1.@@ 4 % over the year .
mr law@@ less also said that the beginning of spring is now about to see an increase in the prices for sale in the next few months , which will &apos; make the market a real test &apos; .
&quot; if you want to keep the constantly high rate of au@@ ction prices , a generally fast sales rate and the ongoing low prices , you can expect a very high price .
in an opinion to the new press , he contradic@@ ts statements by ceo pe@@ er med@@ au and acc@@ uses this , &quot; like a fel@@ d@@ her@@ r &quot; .
the style of the university is not that , it says in the communication .
the med@@ au family was already &quot; informed or@@ ally by mid-@@ june about the idea of the university .
the statement that the plans were not announced until july is definitely wrong , &quot; says p@@ ö@@ tz@@ l .
at the same time , it points out that the plans are not &apos; pre@@ conditions or even decisions &apos; , but that they are &apos; preferences &apos; .
the development of the narrow road , which is necessary for access to the castle , is less dramatic than the med@@ a fear .
from a nine metr@@ e wide road , there was and is not mentioned .
as things stand , we are talking about 5.@@ 50 metres , which is a metr@@ e wider than we have seen , &quot; explains p@@ ö@@ tz@@ l .
the argument of med@@ u operators that their free and educational parking spaces will be limited in future only by students of the university is not intended to make p@@ ö@@ tz@@ l valid .
there is no parking at all because , as with other public parking areas , it is now possible to solve this intellig@@ ently .
the local people think of the people living near them
the children ’ s cri@@ b ber@@ g@@ w@@ ich@@ tel , located on the site and on its do@@ or@@ step the access to the parking dec@@ k is said to be &quot; not affected &quot; by the president of the university of applied sciences .
instead , he points out that this is not just about the cr@@ è@@ che , but also about the people living near the mouth to the fried@@ rich stre@@ i@@ b-@@ stra@@ ß@@ e and the 800 students of the neighbouring real school .
so it is a question of much more than of the specific interests of mr med@@ au &apos; , says p@@ ö@@ tz@@ l .
whether paren@@ tal advisory board criticism of the cr@@ è@@ che , the expansion of the road would be &quot; one of the few natural spots of co@@ burg lost &quot; is justified , &quot; the reader can read himself &quot; .
in early october p@@ ö@@ tz@@ l will be working with the state building office b@@ am@@ berg to publish the city maps on the construction development of the university until 2020 &quot; and in this context to address the importance of new development &quot; .
pe@@ er med@@ au had invited the parents of the children &apos;s cri@@ b to the university &apos;s plans last week .
the entrance to the new parking dec@@ k should not be via the camp@@ us and fried@@ rich@@ -@@ stre@@ i@@ b-@@ stra@@ ß@@ e as it has been until now , but via the me@@ d@@ au@@ -@@ berg .
this would mean that the narrow road would have to be extended to about one kil@@ ome@@ tre in two lan@@ es .
according to the high accounts of med@@ a , traffic in the park of ho@@ hen@@ f@@ els castle would increase ten@@ fold .
of around 2000 vehicles per day .
the city has not yet been asked to comment on the project .
gl@@ and@@ or@@ f is a team of hand@@ ball players who are in the hands of the national team .
hol@@ ger gl@@ and@@ or@@ f will no longer play for the dh@@ b team .
the 3@@ 1-@@ year-@@ old from the bun@@ des@@ lig@@ ist s@@ g fl@@ ens@@ bur@@ g-@@ han@@ de@@ wit@@ t made this decision mainly with health problems .
i did not find it easy to make the decision , it has mat@@ ured for several months .
it is time for me to respond to the signals of my body and to continue my career in the national team , &quot; said the world champi@@ on from 2007 on his fac@@ e@@ book page .
it thus takes stock of 16@@ 7 country games and 5@@ 76 goals for germany into the international reti@@ rement age .
because the re@@ ar wing player is a powerful re@@ ar com@@ part@@ ment for the champi@@ ons league winner from fl@@ ens@@ burg for a few years to go on to@@ re@@ hun@@ ting , he is now on the new d@@ ag@@ ur bun@@ de@@ stra@@ iner .
the ic@@ el@@ and@@ ers , who took the leadership role in the country mat@@ ches against switzerland on tuesday , led gl@@ and@@ or@@ f to lead a long and good con@@ vers@@ ation .
his ideas and approaches have inspired me just as much as they have inspired my long@@ time fellow players and my success@@ ors .
but for my club i would like to be healthy in the next few years , and that is why longer periods of reg@@ ener@@ ation are needed , which do not permit the current double burden .
the lef@@ t-@@ wing han@@ der had a new le@@ g after a he@@ el inf@@ ection in 2012 .
the most common problem was that he had to be trained by german hand@@ ball team doctors ( dh@@ b ) with a cor@@ ti@@ son injec@@ tion .
an emergency operation and two other interven@@ tions followed .
then gl@@ and@@ or@@ f had fil@@ ed a compla@@ int against the team doctor , the dispute ended with a comparison .
twelve years of professional and ele@@ ven years of national team career are not passed by any body without tr@@ ace .
i have some health building sites that i can no longer ignore .
after the three inf@@ ec@@ tion-@@ related foot operations carried out in short inter@@ vals in 2012 , i started to use my blood pressure .
this includes a number of other we@@ ar@@ -@@ related complaints .
at the beginning of the year i noticed that i am ste@@ ering my head , but i cannot dec@@ ei@@ ve my body , &quot; explained gl@@ and@@ or@@ f in the interview to the magazine &quot; hand@@ ball time &quot; .
for a com@@ e@@ back , it would only be available in absolute emergency .
&quot; when all the k@@ n@@ its te@@ ar , i am always ready to talk , &quot; the double family father explained to the magazine .
however , i cannot understand the years in which i can still play hand@@ ball at one hand .
i must also say that after my long hospital stay in 2012 , i also became quite hum@@ ble about my health .
after my career , i would like to be able to go at least to some extent .
in addition to the world cup title 2007 and the champi@@ ons league 20@@ 14 , he won the 2008 ( h@@ s@@ g n@@ ord@@ hor@@ n ) and 2010 ( t@@ b@@ v le@@ m@@ go ) the e@@ h@@ f-@@ cup .
in 2012 , he also secured the european cup of the po@@ kal@@ sie@@ ger with fl@@ ens@@ burg .
german economy in the spring sh@@ run@@ k by 0.@@ 2 %
the crises around the world have hit the german economy in the second quarter .
gross domestic product fell from april to the end of june 20@@ 14 compared to the previous quarter by 0.@@ 2 percent .
this was reported by the federal statistical office and confirmed by the preliminary calcul@@ ation .
consumption alone revi@@ ved the economy in the spring , while investment dec@@ lined .
foreign trade , too , slow@@ ed the economy .
thanks to the strong year start , the first half of the year will see a total gdp increase of 0.@@ 8 % compared to the second half of 2013 .
hor@@ st@@ mar was the starting point and the destination of the &quot; m@@ ün@@ ster@@ land@@ -@@ mo@@ o@@ i@@ ste &quot; , which was first introduced on sunday to the town of bur@@ g@@ man@@ n@@ s@@ stadt .
the bur@@ g@@ man@@ n@@ stadt hor@@ st@@ mar was inv@@ aded by dutch &quot; fe@@ tz@@ en@@ ri@@ der &quot; on sunday .
the largest cycling association in the netherlands , n@@ t@@ f@@ u , organised the so-called &quot; m@@ ün@@ ster@@ lan@@ de mo@@ o@@ i@@ ste &quot; .
this is the biggest cycling tour through the m@@ ün@@ ster@@ land , the cycle trail paradise of the alps near the netherlands .
more than 1000 participants than@@ ked jo@@ s ter hu@@ er@@ ne for the organisation of this tour through the m@@ ün@@ ster@@ land .
published in various trade journ@@ als , this tour was offered to interested parties .
we come from the her@@ oes and went over@@ night to participate in this tour .
we would also like to bring the m@@ ün@@ ster@@ land closer to us in this way , &quot; cy@@ cli@@ sts were delighted with the route through the ste@@ in@@ furt , bor@@ ken and co@@ es@@ fel@@ d districts .
after registration at the club house of the s@@ ü@@ d@@ z@@ ü@@ tz@@ br@@ ä@@ der@@ schaft sta .
k@@ ath@@ ar@@ ina was on a small &quot; peace trip &quot; through the city across the wall , where the start was also made .
the route , which is designed to be adver@@ ti@@ sed for three different categories , led to the her@@ ren@@ hol@@ z over the sch@@ ö@@ pp@@ inger mountain in the direction of co@@ es@@ fel@@ d and via ha@@ vi@@ x@@ bec@@ k and b@@ ill@@ er@@ bec@@ k .
on routes of 95 kilometres with 1@@ 17@@ 5 metres of al@@ titude , 120 kilometres with 14@@ 75 metres of al@@ titude and 14@@ 5 kilometres of al@@ titude , the cy@@ cli@@ sts have proved their good condition .
they were ca@@ red for on the way to ha@@ vi@@ x@@ bec@@ k and b@@ ill@@ er@@ bec@@ k .
the main organiz@@ er jo@@ s ter hu@@ er@@ ne and may@@ or he@@ in@@ z l@@ ö@@ l@@ fing showed the success of this cycling event very pleased .
we are satisfied and it was a nice experience for all those involved .
the organization went without a problem and there were no negative inci@@ dents , &quot; attrac@@ ts he@@ in@@ z l@@ ö@@ l@@ fing a positive conclusion of this event .
unfortunately , not as many participants as the organiz@@ er had hoped , which was probably due to the bad weather forec@@ asts and the morning weather .
&quot; we are back in 20@@ 15 , hopefully in good weather on august 30 or during another weekend , &quot; the cy@@ cli@@ sts promised to return to m@@ ün@@ ster@@ land and the organis@@ ers plan to re@@ issue the new edition .
kon@@ stan@@ tin w@@ ec@@ ker &apos;s un@@ scr@@ up@@ ulous honest mem@@ o@@ irs
it is actually more philosoph@@ ical testi@@ mony than bio@@ graphy , which kon@@ stan@@ tin w@@ ec@@ ker , li@@ e@@ der@@ mach@@ er , paci@@ f@@ ist , politically safe acti@@ vis@@ t , ex@@ -@@ de@@ tain@@ ee , in &quot; mon@@ en k@@ ri@@ e@@ g and ...
not chron@@ o@@ log@@ ically , but more thoughts fe@@ t@@ ches for f@@ ou@@ ls of thought have been given to the co@@ smo@@ politan artist , born on june 1 , 194@@ 7 , each chapter comm@@ enced by a suitable song text .
and he is ru@@ th@@ lessly honest : from the on@@ ani@@ e as a gy@@ m@@ na@@ si@@ um to sho@@ p@@ lif@@ ting and drug use , he leaves no human weak@@ ness .
also , to show how he himself can show tolerance in dealing with his fellow human beings .
there is also a broad range of ab@@ str@@ act , but even more important terms : love , soul , e@@ go , being in the now , spirit@@ u@@ ality - all this he tries to get to the bottom of , in very philosoph@@ ical but also very philosoph@@ ical terms .
and he also explains his paci@@ f@@ ism , his social criticism , his political commitment - and also how he is influenced not only by music ( the opera lo@@ ver was named sou@@ l and rock music ) .
the latter has named the le@@ be@@ mann kon@@ stan@@ tin w@@ ec@@ ker also closer to the as@@ ke@@ tic mon@@ k , who is &quot; created by sub@@ tr@@ action &quot; , as he says , &quot; leaving everything unnecessary &quot; .
there is a difference between all the high spiritual views , however , and also short an@@ ec@@ do@@ tes for earth : for example , on be@@ at@@ ings in a local or an in@@ san@@ e car trip , where he is in front .
here too , he is ru@@ th@@ lessly honest .
len@@ ny hen@@ ry : my father never put me in the arm .
never said &quot; i love you &quot;
hen@@ ry was one of seven children of a family of jam@@ a@@ ic@@ an immigrants in du@@ d@@ ley in the mid@@ lands in 195@@ 8 .
his father , who died when hen@@ ry 19 was , worked in a factory and their relationship was limited .
hen@@ ry is trying for a com@@ edy , ru@@ dy &apos;s rare records , which is partly based on an imag@@ inary con@@ vers@@ ation with his father and is from the series on radio 4 .
the sound@@ track is a mix@@ ture of reg@@ ga@@ e and ra@@ p , with lively me@@ lo@@ dies .
but hen@@ ry had to be inspired by some difficult child@@ hood moments .
he visited &quot; many &quot; therap@@ ies after the death of his mother , and hen@@ ry is th@@ ough@@ t@@ ful about his relationship with his father .
it was difficult to know him .
you never saw his face , only heard his voice : &quot; listen to the cr@@ ash .
let your si@@ ster rest in peace .
get yourself !
i want to look at cr@@ ick@@ et .
my el@@ der bro@@ thers se@@ y@@ m@@ our and hil@@ ton - who had grown up when i was a child - went to the pu@@ b with him and talked about things like the form of beer glass or the beauty of a cr@@ ick@@ et .
i have never had such a con@@ vers@@ ation with him .
he was a serious gu@@ y in the corner of my life , reading the newspaper .
recently , hen@@ ry opened a foun@@ dry in du@@ d@@ ley , and although the conditions are better than in the days of his father , he won an insight into how life is for him .
it is now somewhat bri@@ ghter , but they are dark , smo@@ ked , deep stylish lab@@ y@@ r@@ in@@ ths with fl@@ ame sho@@ cks and smo@@ ke and much so@@ ot .
my father simply put his p@@ an in the past and then he was slowly heard how to sing .
when i ran around , i realized that he had been doing this for years to get the food on the table .
yet hen@@ ry grew up as a child without his parents ’ love testi@@ mon@@ ies .
my father never embr@@ ac@@ ed me , he never said &quot; i love you &quot; .
only when my mother was ill at the end of her life did we start to love you , i love you , i love you , i love you .
by his own daughter bill , with da@@ wn french , he could share the love he had as a child .
could you ever be with the &quot; i love you &quot; ?
stop me embr@@ ac@@ ing !
dad , i am 22 !
with da@@ wn french .
why should we not be friends ?
she is a great mother .
it is still with french friends , with whom he has 25 years of marriage .
da@@ wn is a good man .
why should we not be friends ?
she is a great mother .
hen@@ ry &apos;s own mother was a di@@ abe@@ tic .
this contributed to their death .
so when i was very , very over@@ weight and had symp@@ t@@ oms of di@@ abe@@ tes , my doctor said &apos; you must be radical .
so i moved this fit@@ n@@ ess@@ ing. i had to make a dr@@ astic di@@ et to reverse the symp@@ t@@ oms .
it is very difficult .
and it is ex@@ hau@@ sting .
nobody li@@ kes to eat car@@ ro@@ ts .
hen@@ ry ’ s career changes may be reflected in his elegant , short cut be@@ ard .
since he was nom@@ inated by the cri@@ tics for his o@@ th@@ ell@@ o , he has been cap@@ tured by the theatre .
the com@@ edy of the mistakes followed , and then f@@ ences of august wil@@ son .
this is a different experience from the sit@@ com@@ s and com@@ edy that his busy working life has filled .
he began with only 16 years when he worked in a factory .
a d@@ j discovered him on stage when he im@@ it@@ ated and wrote to new faces about him .
his television career began in the mid-@@ 197@@ 0s . &quot; i was for a fairly long time the only black im@@ it@@ ator / com@@ edi@@ an on television . &quot;
he learned at work .
i had to be big not only in the eyes of the public , but also from 197@@ 5 to 198@@ 5 to learn how to create an efficient jo@@ ke nar@@ ra@@ tive machine , while watching television as a star , and that was really difficult .
len@@ ny 197@@ 5 at new faces
his manager has set the stage right at black and white min@@ stre@@ l show , so he was a s@@ light entertainment program where he could find out what he was looking for .
the room was very small and the bathroom was very small .
i would some@@ how wish it never happened , but i do not regret that i did it .
it was a strange , un@@ pleasant position for me , but i worked on giant projects and learned how to work with a large audience .
but this &quot; year &apos;s awar@@ d-@@ winning light pillar of british television &quot; was also a &quot; gro@@ te@@ s@@ que par@@ o@@ dy of black people . &quot;
by introducing figures that the british black culture both dil@@ u@@ ted and co@@ war@@ dly , hen@@ ry worked in the 1980 ’ s at an alternative com@@ ed@@ y@@ circle .
the first series of len@@ ny hen@@ ry show was broad@@ cast in 198@@ 4 , and in the 199@@ 0s he was known as the ch@@ ef g@@ are@@ th black@@ lock in the com@@ edy club series .
advertising , docum@@ ent@@ aries , tv series and film roles have shaped his next decade , but after his bb@@ c series len@@ ny@@ hen@@ ry@@ .@@ tv 2008 thought that he would be &quot; what is you doing next ?
then came a docum@@ entary series for radio 4 , entitled what &apos;s so great about ... ?
the first episode was about sha@@ kes@@ pe@@ are .
sha@@ kes@@ pe@@ are was a real aller@@ gic person .
i never really had learned something about him in school and thought it was mostly a domain of the middle class , white in ti@@ ghts , and a little bit of a coal head in front of it .
so i was very afraid of it .
all of us who inter@@ viewed for the show , peter hall , tre@@ v@@ or n@@ un@@ n , adri@@ an les@@ ter , ju@@ di den@@ ch said , &quot; you should try it .
do not do it badly if you don &apos;t know what you are talking about .
put a few words in your mouth , and then you will understand why we all sha@@ kes@@ pe@@ are so dear .
hen@@ ry introduced 20 lines from o@@ th@@ less last speech for the docum@@ entary film and he was enthusi@@ astic .
i felt i could do that .
it was as if someone had finally put my head right .
&quot; that is what it is about , it is a serious thing , take them seriously , read your text , research a little .
the sam@@ ples were brut@@ al , and i read this piece for months before we made it .
and it was a success .
they seemed to expect a car accident , and that simply did not happen .
and soon he joined the com@@ edy of the mistakes .
suddenly i was in the national theatre and i could hardly believe it .
there was a moment when i thought &quot; o@@ h , you changed you &quot; .
there was a technical error and hen@@ ry felt inst@@ inc@@ tively that he had to enter@@ tain the audience .
&quot; a little voice told me &quot; you must now bridge 10 minutes while you repair the computer . &quot;
instead , the stage leader announced that the idea would continue as soon as the problem was resolved .
i went from the stage and something in me said &quot; o@@ h , thank god &quot; .
i am not responsible for that .
i can leave that to someone else .
&quot; you play in a play , so stay in your role . &quot;
hen@@ ry in f@@ ences at the du@@ ch@@ ess theatre
learning the text for f@@ ences was challenging .
pan@@ ic is very good , that strength@@ ens the desi@@ res .
that too was a good thing , so it is like a great shi@@ eld of the go@@ ds who tell me &quot; this is your dest@@ iny &quot; .
he says this , of course , with a th@@ under@@ ing voice .
so i will stick to that .
i really love that .
i love to be in a sample room .
hen@@ ry still has the head of a com@@ edi@@ an - our con@@ vers@@ ation is full of hum@@ or@@ ous out@@ breaks while he is im@@ it@@ ating people .
i decided not to use a stand@@ -up com@@ edy because i think that this type of immediate release is not the right place for a chamber full of str@@ ang@@ ers .
if you are looking for something , you are driving in front of a wall .
i sometimes go live in apo@@ llo when i want to see it , but overall i don &apos;t have as much time as i did before .
i ask him if he ever has a stand@@ -up com@@ edy tour again .
the fun i have in a room with a director who helps to create a beginning , a middle part and the end of a journey - i think not , that i have ever seen it again .
so is this his new inc@@ ar@@ nation ?
i think so .
i am a actor .
it is fun .
you always tell a story , and that is great .
i love stories .
people love stories .

ken@@ ya regi@@ sters officials to &quot; g@@ host employees &quot; to contain the burden of &quot; g@@ host employees &quot; .
ken@@ ya has begun to b@@ ind all state officials bi@@ ome@@ tric to &quot; con@@ front g@@ host workers &quot; from the pay lists of the government .
employees who are not registered in the next two weeks would no longer be paid , and there was a government communication .
the government susp@@ ects that thousands of people will still be able to escape from the public service with pay .
president u@@ hur@@ u ken@@ y@@ att@@ a promised to build a new government corruption in 2013 .
at the beginning of this year , it was discovered that at least $ 1 million ( £ 7@@ 00@@ ,000 ) per month of payments for &quot; g@@ host workers &quot; and other ab@@ u@@ sive financial practices were lost .
the government susp@@ ects that sal@@ aries will continue to be paid on accounts after a person has died or has been dis@@ missed from the public service , reports w@@ any@@ ama che@@ bu@@ si@@ ri for the bb@@ c from the capital na@@ i@@ rob@@ i .
all officials must now be present at identification centres in the next two weeks to ensure that their data on bi@@ ome@@ tric regi@@ stra@@ tions are included , was reported in a government message .
all those who cannot do this without a credible apo@@ logy would be removed from the pay list , which was the communication .
&quot; this approach will make a significant contribution to the ra@@ tion@@ alization of public services by identi@@ fying the actual number of officials and by also reducing the pay list on both levels of government - thus the &quot; g@@ host employees &quot; will be elimin@@ ated .

in the case of the case , it is stated that ach@@ en@@ bach has already made a significant contribution to the purchase of works of art and ol@@ d@@ tim@@ ers and has paid ber@@ th@@ old al@@ bre@@ cht higher than actual paid purchase prices .
this also means that the commission agreed to be higher .

children need roots and w@@ ings
he was in school for 44 years , 23 of them as head of the school .
from this time , man@@ f@@ red rich@@ ter knows many senior pe@@ ter@@ sha@@ us@@ en@@ er and k@@ ol@@ l@@ b@@ ach@@ er from their time as a student .
his methods were sometimes un@@ conventional , but always supported by his desire to te@@ ach the people .
the snow@@ k@@ op@@ pe is the most famous mountain in the giant mountains .
man@@ f@@ red rich@@ ter lo@@ ves the painting with the mo@@ ti@@ f from his home country .
jud@@ ges were born in tr@@ au@@ ten@@ au , north bo@@ hem@@ ia , now tr@@ ut@@ no@@ v .
he was already interested in the german language after four years of secondary school .
one year on , the su@@ de@@ ten german@@ s were ex@@ propri@@ ated .
within half an hour , the family had to leave their house .
after a few months in a ware@@ house went to bav@@ aria in 194@@ 6 - in the freight wag@@ on .
jud@@ ges went into the upper fran@@ con@@ ian s@@ enc@@ ill@@ ant village .
the teacher training took place in b@@ am@@ berg .
to this end , man@@ f@@ red rich@@ ter had to walk six times a week to the ne@@ arest train station , travel by train to b@@ am@@ berg , there three kilometres across the city to school and return in the evening .
after two months , man@@ f@@ red got jud@@ ges in a red cross home in b@@ am@@ berg : together with up to 15 students in a sle@@ eping room .
in 195@@ 1 , he made the first and in 195@@ 4 , after three years of school gradu@@ ate , the second state ex@@ am .
since ob@@ er@@ fran@@ ken had no free teacher &apos;s office for him , he applied for upper bav@@ aria and came to the university on november 1 , 195@@ 4 .
the &quot; fr@@ ä@@ u@@ le@@ in room &quot; was his first &quot; business apartment &quot; in the school building .
in 195@@ 8 he moved to the new building teacher &apos;s house next to the school a three-@@ room apartment .
this house bought man@@ f@@ red rich@@ ter in 1980 , after the school dis@@ solved in k@@ ol@@ l@@ bach in 196@@ 8 .
until then , there were no such events in k@@ ol@@ l@@ bach in the pe@@ ter@@ sha@@ us@@ en-@@ k@@ ol@@ l@@ bach school association and in pe@@ ter@@ sha@@ us@@ en five classes .
from the school year 196@@ 8 / 69 , these were published in pe@@ ter@@ sha@@ us@@ en in today &apos;s town hall .
when the school association indi@@ er@@ s@@ dorf was founded , only primary school remained in the village .
in order to avoid a down@@ grade in the now smaller school , the then rec@@ tor geor@@ g si@@ g@@ l moved to kar@@ ls@@ fel@@ d - and man@@ f@@ red rich@@ ter was his success@@ or .
but pe@@ ter@@ sha@@ us@@ en grew , and so the children and their teachers were able to move to the present building , which was built in 1997 according to judge reti@@ rement .
man@@ f@@ red rich@@ ter comm@@ ends the un@@ complicated gener@@ os@@ ity of the then may@@ or lu@@ d@@ wi@@ g g@@ ö@@ tz , who added a work room and a k@@ ell@@ er@@ rooms to the commun@@ al costs in 1997 , although this was guidelines according to the extension .
&quot; may@@ or g@@ ö@@ tz was very scho@@ ol@@ -@@ friendly &quot; , re@@ mem@@ bered judge .
in all his career , man@@ f@@ red rich@@ ter never heard the speech of a government representative who was waiting for a school council unit on justice and law : &apos; you cannot ever be the lo@@ ver &apos; .
&quot; we must give the children two things : roots and w@@ ings , &quot; says the 8@@ 4-@@ year-@@ old today .
and he had to learn : &quot; that is not always successful &quot; , whether he is only talking about his students or his own six children , is not quite clear .
in any case , jud@@ ges were sometimes un@@ conventional .
when students check , they did not get a pen@@ al job and were not allowed to sit down .
jud@@ ges had two pa@@ irs of bo@@ x@@ ing glo@@ ves at the expense of the community and had the two oppos@@ ing men compete against each other , even though there was a ve@@ il .
for the good of the school , jud@@ ges used to have a good relationship as rec@@ tor with the then may@@ or lu@@ d@@ wi@@ g g@@ ö@@ tz ( c@@ su ) .
he moved the par@@ tis@@ an judge after his reti@@ rement to be the last to appear on the c@@ su list for the local council in 1996 .
but jud@@ ges were chosen to rank six and joined the c@@ su .

hr@@ 4-@@ cycling tour 700 cy@@ cli@@ sts take part in the spa park of bad salz@@ haus@@ en and sch@@ ot@@ ten sto@@ po@@ vers .
if rad@@ ler is on tour in bad salz@@ haus@@ en or sch@@ ot@@ ten , that is not something special in itself .
on friday , however , the number of re@@ sting impres@@ sions were only as follows : the 700 participants of the hr@@ 4 cycling tour and the accompan@@ ying tro@@ ss enjoyed a break in the lower spa park of bad salz@@ haus@@ en and later a party outside .
under the mo@@ tto &quot; cycling and celebr@@ ating on newly discovered paths between ni@@ d@@ da and kin@@ zi@@ g &quot; , participants had a meeting in bad vil@@ bel on thursday and had a concert by van ba@@ ker &amp; band .
friday was a serious day : the cy@@ cli@@ sts took the first stage , which took 60 kilometres across fl@@ or@@ stadt to bad salz@@ haus@@ en and further to scotland .
in bad salz@@ haus@@ en , the athle@@ tes of may@@ or han@@ s-@@ peter s@@ eu@@ m , who was bi@@ king in bad vil@@ bel , and the leader of the self-@@ catering bad salz@@ haus@@ en , pe@@ tra sch@@ win@@ n , were invited .
for a refres@@ hing break in body and mind , everything was prepared : the women of the ran@@ town and the ni@@ e@@ der@@ -@@ mo@@ ck@@ stadt had 85 sheets of apple , go@@ at , stre@@ aming , and other cheese .

the park &apos;s beautiful ambi@@ ence was relaxing .
a gentle@@ man also enjoyed a head massage from his partner : &quot; he deserves , after all , he has already jum@@ ped off bicycle cha@@ ins today .

after arriving in scotland , the group was allowed to take a short break .

under the direction of the sch@@ ot@@ ten@@ er ges@@ ell@@ schaft für tourism and city marketing ( g@@ ts ) , the park had received a beautiful fe@@ st@@ ambi@@ ente and of course had ta@@ sty delic@@ acies , such as fl@@ ame ca@@ kes with well cool@@ ed feder@@ ite wh@@ ites .

not all ukraine ’ s children return to school
schools opened in almost all ukraine on monday ( september 1 ) after the summer holidays .
this day is tradi@@ tionally an important day for families , and , like thousands of other ukra@@ inian parents , prime minister ar@@ sen@@ i j@@ az@@ en@@ ju@@ k brought his daughter to school .
there he told waiting journalists that not all schools had re@@ opened , but that he was determined to open the country for future generations :
september celebra@@ tions were not held in every school .
the sky is not peaceful across ukraine .
we must fight for a peaceful heav@@ en .
the whole of ukraine , a huge common ukra@@ inian people &apos;s front , must fight for a peaceful heav@@ en .
ale@@ k@@ san pa@@ stu@@ k@@ how , head of school in sla@@ v@@ jan@@ sk , the j@@ az@@ en@@ ju@@ k daughter visited , spoke in russian .
we hope that peace will finally re@@ ign here and that children will receive an education that will be useful to them in their further life .
the first day of the new school year is tradi@@ tionally celebrated , with children em@@ bro@@ ide@@ red shir@@ ts , bal@@ lo@@ ons in their hands and their teachers being flowers .
with r@@ ona fair@@ head , the bb@@ c may have found the great director it needs .
it meets with a proud gl@@ ory from the banking world , media management and the inner circle of tory party .
and she has her own fron@@ tal experience .
her career began with the global management consulting company ba@@ in and co . , to which she has been awarded mor@@ gan stan@@ ley , bom@@ ba@@ di@@ er , ic@@ i and the media world of pe@@ ar@@ s@@ ons .
she was the ceo of the financial times for seven years and re@@ signed when the chief post of parent company pe@@ ar@@ son was transferred to a younger male .
their sever@@ ance was supposed to be nearly £ 1 million .
their political ran@@ king is also solid .
she was played by lord brown , the former chairman of b@@ p , david camer@@ on , when he was looking for more private knowledge in wh@@ ite@@ hall : she was appointed ber@@ ate .
her hus@@ band is a former tory council member .
in may , i described the task of the chairman with a po@@ is@@ oned cup .
not only is the bb@@ c a huge and complex entity in the heart of public life , but there is also an internal par@@ ado@@ x in its structure .
confidence is tw@@ o@@ fold : in@@ ward to the first guard of the own management hier@@ arch@@ y in the bb@@ c , but also to the outside as a voice of public concern and dis@@ quiet when things go wrong .
this creates an almost un@@ sustainable du@@ o@@ po@@ ly , which , in turn , requires a complete comprehensive reform .
but what new in@@ coming chairman would risk joining the european parliament to do everything and set up an institution that is so complex as a chinese dy@@ na@@ sty that , while standing in the process of raising its own jobs , he might be doing .
it is a difficult task .
and as if this were not enough , many are still interested in seeing the bb@@ c reduced - power , money and status over@@ taken .
while competition is appro@@ aching and new technologies are creating a threat to old , convenient col@@ lateral , the forthcoming negotiation of licence fees for the bb@@ c will enta@@ il particular dangers .
for the modest sum of £ 14@@ 5.@@ 50 per year , the british public is buying up to what is certainly the largest media company in the world .
the bb@@ c tells a good story : it says that it has reached 96 % of all house@@ holds and each of them costs only 40 p@@ ence a day .
and it seems that the bb@@ c is rising on the popul@@ arity scale again : 53 % support the us today , compared to 31 % before 10 years .
the visual and usage hab@@ its for the bb@@ c have changed : i get news reports today .
but she remains a very be@@ loved and no@@ table institution .
it needs a considerable chairman - i hope she has found him .
per@@ ry from tex@@ as says that des@@ cen@@ ding t@@ we@@ et was not authorized .
a t@@ we@@ et from the republic@@ an govern@@ or ’ s official account , ric@@ k per@@ ry , on sunday de@@ bu@@ ted a down@@ ward trend .
the t@@ we@@ et was later deleted and replaced by another per@@ ry user account that changed the previous last time .
a t@@ we@@ et is sent out from my account that is not authorized by me .
&quot; i don &apos;t approve the t@@ we@@ et and have deleted it , &quot; said it in the later news .
per@@ ry staff did not respond promp@@ tly to requests for comments .
although the t@@ wee@@ ts of per@@ ry &apos;s official account were out , it was not clear who actually received the feed .
in the former t@@ we@@ et , an un@@ favor@@ able picture of the district prosecu@@ tor of tra@@ vis county , ros@@ em@@ ary le@@ h@@ m@@ berg , was drawn , which was published in april 2013 for dr@@ un@@ ken@@ ness .
per@@ ry ve@@ to@@ ed financial support for her office when she refused to grant it .
the t@@ wee@@ ts text reads : &apos; i do not always drink dr@@ un@@ k with the tri@@ ple permitted alcohol level ... but if i do it , i am compla@@ ining .
i am the most dr@@ un@@ k democr@@ at in tex@@ as .
le@@ h@@ m@@ berg ’ s office was not in charge of the examination of the grand jury against per@@ ry .
this was created by michael mc@@ cr@@ um , a special prosecu@@ tor from san ant@@ oni@@ o , who was chosen by a republic@@ an judge .
per@@ ry is ple@@ ading for not guil@@ ty and calling the charge a political tr@@ ick .
his high-@@ class team of legal advis@@ ers applied for the case to be referred to as the prosecu@@ tor .
per@@ ry stopped $ 7.@@ 5 million of government funds to the public integrity union .
this ve@@ to caused a public compla@@ int from a lef@@ t-@@ wing wat@@ ch@@ dog group .
per@@ ry &apos;s official account is frequently updated - and sometimes famous .
after having been elected to the i@@ ow@@ a election meetings during his presidential candi@@ d@@ acy in 2012 as the fifth , per@@ ry went on to spec@@ ulate that he would stop .
ber@@ ke@@ ley explains the housing market to be &quot; normal &quot; again .
one of the most prominent buil@@ ders in london pointed out that the housing sector is in the south-@@ east of england again becoming a normal &apos; back door &apos; .
homes in the capital were ho@@ tly sought and the subject of huge price increases , which the bank of england did not want to see , owing to widespread fear of a credit bu@@ b@@ ble .
ton@@ y pi@@ d@@ g@@ ley , founder and ceo of the high-@@ class construction company ber@@ ke@@ ley said on monday : &quot; since the start of the current financial year , the market has returned to normal transaction levels since the highest level in 2013 .
the property market in london was well established during the down@@ turn , as foreign bu@@ yers pus@@ hed into the capital .
according to the regi@@ stry office , prices in the city area have dro@@ pped by 18@@ .@@ 5 % in the last year alone , far more than the average increase in england and wal@@ es as a whole .
the average sales price at ber@@ ke@@ ley ’ s private , cheap , and student offers rose by about a fifth last year , reaching a level of 4@@ 23@@ ,000 £ at the end of april .
however , a stronger p@@ ound has brought real estate property in london to foreign bu@@ yers less attractive in recent months - some of them have also been weak@@ ened by the introduction of new property taxes and political rhe@@ tor@@ ic about a possible &quot; villa tax &quot; .
london real estate agent fo@@ x@@ ton war@@ ned that the last week , the mort@@ gage market price report for april , in which the shar@@ per interest rate on l@@ ending was expected to be in the first reading .
new data from the bank of england on monday show a decline in mort@@ gage allow@@ ance in july , which also indicates that the uk &apos;s housing market is slow@@ ing .
h@@ amp@@ tions international , another real estate agency , correc@@ ted its forec@@ ast for the rise in london ’ s property prices for 20@@ 15 to 3 % , based on a weak@@ er growth rate already in place .
the volume of transactions in the most expensive areas of london , such as ch@@ el@@ sea , may@@ fair and ken@@ sing@@ ton , has now fallen by a quarter year on year , according to the bro@@ ker wa ell@@ is .
however , the desire for a home in the capital of ber@@ ke@@ ley is a bl@@ essing , as the amounts due for forward sales are more than 2.@@ 2 billion £ .
mr pi@@ d@@ g@@ ley added : &apos; the demand for the right , well-@@ planned product at the best locations remained stable and as a result are the dead@@ lines sales .
in june , the company reported that there were 3,@@ 7@@ 42 new homes in the year until the end of april - almost a third more than at the 2007 peak before the crisis .
annual preliminary tax ear@@ nings rose by 40 percent to € 2@@ 80 million , sales rose by 18 percent to € 1.@@ 6 billion .
in a communication on monday before the company &apos;s annual meeting , mr pi@@ d@@ g@@ ley said that the revenue for ber@@ ke@@ ley is expected to be in line with current market expectations in the current year .
the analy@@ sts es@@ timate , in agreement , the annual preliminary tax result to £ 4@@ 50 million .
ber@@ ke@@ ley shares were held in london in the afternoon at 2@@ 3.@@ 96 £ .
nu@@ de photos of j@@ enni@@ fer law@@ rence by h@@ ack@@ ers published on the internet .
j@@ enni@@ fer law@@ rence gi@@ g at the 8@@ 5th o@@ sc@@ ar award .
nu@@ de photos of the o@@ sc@@ ar winner j@@ enni@@ fer law@@ rence were taken online by a h@@ ack@@ er who claimed that a &quot; mas@@ tered list &quot; of images of another 100 star@@ lets .
a representative of the star &quot; the tribute of pan@@ em &quot; confirmed that the photos of la@@ v@@ ren@@ ce ec@@ ht are genuine and compla@@ ined of the h@@ ack@@ er for &quot; bl@@ at@@ ant violation of privacy &quot; .
the authorities have been notified and will follow up all those who have taken the sto@@ len photos of j@@ enni@@ fer law@@ rence .
the photos originally taken on the photo sharing page 4@@ ch@@ an are now available in the photo gallery .
it is not certain how many images are genuine , although win@@ ste@@ ad , star from &quot; scot@@ t pil@@ gri@@ m against the rest of the world &quot; on t@@ wit@@ ter also condemned the h@@ ack .
&quot; to those of you who look at photos that my hus@@ band and i took years ago in the private environment of our house - i hope you are so satisfied with you , &quot; win@@ ste@@ ad wrote on t@@ wit@@ ter .
victori@@ a justice from the nic@@ lo@@ de series &quot; ic@@ ar@@ ly &quot; and &quot; victori@@ a justice &quot; are now on the way to a new series of photographs .
let us stand up for the beginning . * word play intended * .
bu@@ zz@@ feed reported on late sunday that a speaker of the pop@@ star has been ari@@ ana gran@@ de , who has been trying to explain the authentic@@ ity of the alleg@@ ed photos of her .
exclusive ex@@ cer@@ pt from ho@@ ward jac@@ ob@@ son ’ s highly acc@@ laim@@ ed new novel about love and the letters &quot; j &quot; .
they were dis@@ rup@@ ted , so it was best to describe it , they slowly dis@@ solved like a card@@ board that could be put up in the rain .
occa@@ sion@@ ally , a woman told him that he was too serious , stren@@ u@@ ous , intensive , di@@ stan@@ ced and perhaps a little scr@@ at@@ ch-@@ brus@@ hing .
and then sha@@ ken his hand .
scr@@ at@@ z@@ brus@@ ti@@ g he knew .
he was st@@ ach@@ ec@@ on@@ ous , as in i@@ gel , yes .
the last victim of this st@@ asis was a recent aff@@ air that was promising .
a@@ il@@ in sol@@ om@@ ons was a trem@@ bling beauty with un@@ t@@ amed hair and a fla@@ ir .
she was married to an older compan@@ ion , who had been known to ke@@ ver@@ n for her a@@ un@@ t , and who had built a p@@ lot in a dam@@ p but paradise valley with the name paradise valley .
for several years , no one had lived in the house .
the tu@@ bes were le@@ ak , in the ba@@ ths were still sp@@ in@@ ning , nu@@ de nec@@ ks had their tracks on all windows and believed that they were in the same thing , and the garden was filled with un@@ ru@@ ly co@@ ws .
it was like the house of a child fair@@ y , both threat@@ ening and temp@@ ting , a garden full of secre@@ ts .
por@@ tra@@ it of the author : ho@@ ward jac@@ ob@@ son , whose novel &quot; j &quot; on the long@@ list for which man boo@@ ker prize 20@@ 14 is written .
the short@@ list will be announced next week .
ke@@ ver@@ n had a trade holding with a@@ il@@ in on the broken dec@@ k chairs in the high gr@@ ass and had an un@@ usually warm spring afternoon .
your feet are too big .
because of their own aggres@@ si@@ veness , songs of this kind were no longer played on the con@@ sole .
not banned - nothing was really for@@ bi@@ dden - simply not played .
it has been successfully ob@@ sol@@ es@@ cent , just as the word ob@@ sole@@ te .
the general taste created what decre@@ es and regulations could never have done , and how people used vo@@ m t@@ ones in books .
in the eu@@ ph@@ oria of the day , ke@@ ver@@ n began to play an imag@@ inary piano and to perform in a gro@@ b-@@ com@@ ic se@@ ren@@ ade of a@@ il@@ in ’ s great feet .
a@@ il@@ in@@ n did not understand that .
&quot; this was a well-known song of a jazz pi@@ an@@ ist called f@@ ats w@@ all@@ er , &quot; he explained it and automatically put two fing@@ ers on his li@@ ps .
his father had always done this to stop the letter j before he left his mouth .
it had been a game between him and his father when he was still small .
his father had played it with his own father , so he had told .
if you start a word with a j without putting two fing@@ ers over your li@@ ps , it costs you a pen@@ ny .
it was not a very fun@@ ny game at that time , and it was not very fun@@ ny even now .
he knew that he was expec@@ ting him , that was all .
it had to explain what jazz was .
a@@ il@@ inn had never heard of any .
jazz , although not directly banned , was not played .
impro@@ vis@@ ation was no longer modern .
there was only room for a single &quot; if &quot; in life .
people wanted to be at the beginning of a me@@ lo@@ dy quite sure where it would end .
so is the mind .
his un@@ predic@@ tability made people ner@@ vous .
and jazz was musi@@ cally expres@@ sive mind .
although he was 10 years old without being taught by sam@@ my dav@@ is junior , he knew that he was a little bit about jazz from the semi-@@ secret collection of old c@@ ds by his father .
but at least he did not have to explain to a@@ il@@ in that f@@ ats w@@ all@@ er was black .
at her age , she probably could not remember a time when pop sing@@ ers were not black .
once again , no laws or constra@@ ints were in place .
a con@@ form society meant that every element of this society than@@ k@@ fully adhe@@ red to the principle of group tal@@ ents - than@@ k@@ fully , like those spa@@ red from fate .
people with a@@ fro@@ -@@ caribbean origin@@ s were affected by temper@@ ament and body building for entertainment and sport , so san@@ g and run them .
people who were originally from the indian sub@@ continent were like nature with electronic talent , but they were not very happy with the task of getting them to work .
what remains of the polish community was not concerned with the se@@ wer system ; what was proposed by the gre@@ e@@ ks was s@@ wal@@ low@@ ed down .
those from the gulf states and the lev@@ ante , whose grand@@ parents had not quickly left the country than what had happened when it had happened , were fe@@ ar@@ ful of being tor@@ n down by fire .
everyone according to their abilities .
she was a member of the &quot; k@@ ul@@ tur@@ sti@@ f@@ tun@@ g &quot; ( the &quot; k@@ ul@@ tur@@ sti@@ f@@ tun@@ g &quot; ) , and she was a member of the &quot; k@@ ling@@ on empire &quot; .
music was an expression of love .
&quot; they are not really off@@ ensive , &quot; ke@@ ver@@ n said .
except perhaps for people whose feet are too big .
my father never insul@@ ted anyone , but he loved this song .
he talked too much , but the negl@@ ected garden gave him the dec@@ ep@@ tive feeling of security .
the room was very small and the bathroom was very small .
a@@ il@@ in@@ n still did not understand .
why should your father have loved this ?
he wanted to say that it was a ju@@ x , but hesit@@ ated to return to two fing@@ ers in their presence .
she already thought that he had something strange .
&quot; it seemed fun@@ ny to him , &quot; he said instead .
she sh@@ at@@ tered dis@@ belief and bloc@@ ked bo@@ ge@@ ons ’ view .
there was nothing else to see the world over than to see your un@@ comb@@ ated r@@ ab@@ bit black hair .
there was nothing he would have liked to see otherwise .
&quot; if you say it , &quot; you mean without convic@@ tion .
but that doesn &apos;t explain why you want to do it to me .
they seemed to be genuinely concerned .
are my feet too big ?
he looked back again .
your feet so directly not .
maybe your an@@ k@@ les , a little bit ...
and you say , you h@@ ate me because my an@@ k@@ les are too th@@ ick ?
h@@ ate you ?
of course i do not h@@ ate you .
that is just the st@@ up@@ id song .
he could have said &quot; i love you &quot; , but it was too early for that .
&quot; your big an@@ k@@ les are exactly the reason why you like me , &quot; tried to make it instead .
i am a little per@@ verse .
that sounds wrong .
it was fun@@ ny .
when he tried to be fun@@ ny , he often got into trouble because he was like his father , not having the cal@@ ming charm .
perhaps his father also wanted to be cru@@ el .
perhaps he wanted to be that , ke@@ ver@@ n .
despite his kind eyes .
a@@ il@@ in sol@@ om@@ ons was red and rose from her mo@@ oring .
the wine of the fl@@ oral , so dr@@ un@@ ken@@ ness was no exc@@ use for him .
in their ex@@ ci@@ tement , they seemed to trem@@ ble as pal@@ m we@@ del did in the stor@@ m .
and your th@@ ick head is exactly the reason why i feel per@@ verse unto you .
except that i am not .
she was suffering from both the unnecessary in@@ friend@@ liness of his words and the fear that has spread in her eyes when she turned against him .
did you think he would beat them ?
she had not told him of life on the cold northern archi@@ pel@@ ago , where she had grown up , but he had no doubt that there was essentially such a thing as here .
the same huge and ic@@ e-@@ cold ocean bro@@ ke here as there on the shore .
the same conf@@ used men , with even th@@ ick@@ er skin and ver@@ ily after what happened , as it was their an@@ ce@@ st@@ ors s@@ mu@@ gg@@ lers and beach rob@@ bers , moved from k@@ nei@@ pe to k@@ nei@@ pe .
a big head ?
they would have shown her a big f@@ ist if she didn &apos;t fit up !
you can k@@ nu@@ t first - it was the most commonly used word for ero@@ tic an@@ xi@@ ety .
ke@@ ver@@ n ’ s view was that this was an unnecessary re@@ fin@@ ement , as the k@@ nu@@ t itself was already an act of violence .
a@@ il@@ in sol@@ om@@ ons gave him a sign through her body .
he was born from the rec@@ um@@ b@@ ent like an old man .
she also felt st@@ uck , but the power of his gri@@ ef surprised her .
that was not the end of the world .
they hardly knew about it .
she looked at him as he di@@ stan@@ ced himself - as he did from a room on the top floor , her compan@@ ion wat@@ ched him - a man , compla@@ ining about something he himself had sum@@ mon@@ ed .
ad@@ am leaves the garden , she thought .
she felt a su@@ dden pain for him and men in general , although some rose up their hands against them .
a man turned away from her , his back bo@@ wed , ash@@ amed , defe@@ ated , without any fighting spirit - why was this a sight that she had good to know ?
when she was alone again , a@@ il@@ in looked at her feet .
several years before the events that have just been told , es@@ me n@@ us@@ s@@ bau@@ m , an intelligent and enthusi@@ astic 32 year old resear@@ cher on behalf of of@@ now , the non-@@ legislative surveillance office of the european union .
&quot; a lot has been done and a lot still needs to be done , &quot; she wrote , &quot; to defend the in@@ n@@ ate aggres@@ si@@ veness of a people that led a thousand wars and won most of them , especially in the remote regions .
but some features are un@@ ext@@ inc@@ tible .
the higher the church tower , it seems , the lower the passion it continues to ar@@ ou@@ se .
the people are cr@@ ying when listening to s@@ enti@@ mental bal@@ la@@ den , they are be@@ wit@@ ching stories of over@@ came difficulties and claim@@ ing to remember the virtu@@ es of marriage and family life , but yet not only does ro@@ h@@ th@@ ness hold the rural communities .
&quot; they have an unfortunate tend@@ ency to ex@@ ag@@ ger@@ ation , &quot; said their ment@@ or when he read the whole report .
i propose that you read less nov@@ els .
es@@ me n@@ us@@ s@@ bau@@ m lo@@ wered her head .
i must also ask : are you a@@ the@@ ist ?
&quot; i think i don &apos;t have to say that &quot; rep@@ lied es@@ me n@@ us@@ s@@ bau@@ m .
are they les@@ bian ?
again es@@ me spoke about her right to privacy and ref@@ usal of statement .
fem@@ in@@ ist ?
silence again .
&quot; i don &apos;t ask this , &quot; said lu@@ ther r@@ ab@@ in@@ o@@ wit@@ z , &quot; because i am against a@@ the@@ ism , les@@ bian or fem@@ in@@ ism .
this is a job without pre@@ jud@@ ice .
we are serving a society that is free from pre@@ jud@@ ice .
but certain types of hyper@@ sensi@@ tivity , which are in itself absolutely acceptable and comm@@ end@@ able , may occa@@ sion@@ ally produce results , as you have presented .
you yourself have obviously been pre@@ ju@@ dic@@ ed against the church , and these things that you describe as &apos; dis@@ gu@@ sting &apos; and &apos; raw &apos; could be as well expressed by others as an expression of a natural strength and vit@@ ality .
if you continue on the road that has happened , you will be able to see that if there were any problems yesterday , then you will be able to give the country its essential vit@@ ality .
es@@ me wal@@ nu@@ t saw the way around , while r@@ ab@@ in@@ o@@ wit@@ z spoke .
behind his head , a led letter in fl@@ am@@ ing@@ or@@ os@@ a repeated the advice that of@@ now gave to the country in the last quar@@ ter-@@ century or more .
sm@@ ile to your neighb@@ our , value your partner , listen to b@@ all@@ ads , visit musi@@ c@@ als , use your phone , talk , explain how you listen to your voice , agree to be apo@@ logi@@ zed .
speaking is better than silence , the common word is better than the written , but nothing is better than love .
&quot; i understand absolutely what they want to do , &quot; es@@ me n@@ us@@ s@@ bau@@ m rep@@ lied with calm voice when she was sure that her superior would have spoken to the end , &quot; and i say nothing but that we are still doing .
my concern is that without warning we may be able to find ways of improving the mistakes we have made in the first place in relation to what has happened , when it has happened .
this time , however , it is not the others that we have to take away our an@@ ger and mi@@ str@@ ust .
lu@@ ther r@@ ab@@ in@@ o@@ wit@@ z shaped a py@@ ram@@ id with his hands .
to achieve an eng@@ el@@ -@@ pati@@ ence .
&quot; they go too far , &quot; he said , &quot; if they call acts &quot; error &quot; that our grand@@ parents may or may not have committed .
they also go too far in saying that they have their &apos; an@@ ger &apos; and their &apos; mi@@ str@@ ust &apos; to &apos; others &apos; .
it should not be necessary to give someone in their position to remind you that we have a lot to do in understanding the past , as in protecting the present , not &quot; us &quot; and &quot; others &quot; .
there was no &quot; we &quot; and there were no &quot; others &quot; .
it was a time of dis@@ order , that is all we know .
&quot; of the if we are honest with ourselves , &quot; d@@ ared to throw in es@@ me , &quot; no part of society can claim to have be@@ having well .
i am not compla@@ ining to anyone .
whether it was done badly or well , what happened has happened .
that was then .
nothing more needs to be said about this - we are in agreement on that .
and , just as no fault has to be attribu@@ ted , no guil@@ t must be re@@ paid if such re@@ payment is appropriate and if there is a way to re@@ pay it .
but what is the point of the past if we do not learn from it - and i am not learning from it - and what is the point of the past ?
the past serves to make us forget them .
if i may say something about this , i would like to say something about it .
lu@@ ther r@@ ab@@ in@@ o@@ wit@@ z put his py@@ ram@@ id together .
&quot; i will consider your report , &quot; he said and dis@@ missed it .
the next day , when she went to work as usual , she was over@@ run by a motor@@ cy@@ c@@ list who , as pas@@ ser@@ s-@@ by described , was living in a kind of &quot; brut@@ al r@@ age &quot; on the foot@@ path .
there are coinci@@ d@@ ences .
les@@ o@@ th@@ o military member says that no cou@@ p d &apos;@@ é@@ t@@ at is planned ; prime minister remains in south africa ; prime minister remains in south africa ; prime minister remains in south africa
military officials in les@@ o@@ th@@ o cont@@ end that a cou@@ p d &apos;@@ é@@ t@@ at was planned to over@@ throw the government , and said that they were against polic@@ em@@ en who had been denied the arm@@ ing of political fan@@ a@@ tics .

the premier brought his family to the neighbouring south africa after being tor@@ tured by the threats of ass@@ ass@@ ination .
military spo@@ kes@@ man major n@@ t@@ le@@ le n@@ to@@ i said that there is , in fact , no cou@@ p d &apos;@@ é@@ t@@ at , but that the military is respon@@ ding to the threat of &apos; political fan@@ a@@ tics &apos; , whose weapons were put in the police .
&quot; what happened this morning was that the defence forces of les@@ o@@ th@@ o acted after he had met several intelligence reports .
the south african spo@@ kes@@ man cla@@ y@@ son mon@@ y@@ ela said that the military action has the impression of a tur@@ mo@@ il .
&quot; even if no one has claimed that the government had been tor@@ n by violence , all the reports are agreed that the activities of les@@ ot@@ to &apos;s defence forces have so far been indic@@ ative of a cou@@ p , &quot; he said .
spo@@ kes@@ man of the les@@ o@@ th@@ o military said on sunday that the soldiers had entered their bar@@ r@@ acks and had to leave the situation in the capital calm .
meanwhile , the vice premier mo@@ the@@ t@@ jo@@ ya met@@ sing takes over the leadership of th@@ ab@@ ane ’ s absence .
th@@ ab@@ ane said that he believed he was a man who was ab@@ sent from the country because of his attempt to combat corruption .
in les@@ o@@ th@@ o , there have been major ten@@ sions since june , after th@@ ab@@ ane &apos;s parliamentary meetings have been suspended because of the disputes in his unity government .
he said that his actions would not have under@@ min@@ ed the government , despite otherwise l@@ oud acc@@ us@@ ations .
production in the eurozone at a 13@@ -@@ month low
the growth in eurozone output slow@@ ed in august to the lowest level in the last 13 months , so one could see a very closely observed study .
the final mark@@ it purchasing management index of the manufacturing industry ( p@@ mi ) fell in august to 5@@ 0.@@ 7 , after a bo@@ oth of 5@@ 1.@@ 8 in july .
a figure of 50 indicates an expansion .
new orders went down and fac@@ tories suffered break@@ down@@ s at a time of rising ten@@ sions between the eu and russia over ukraine .
the figures are available before the european central bank ( ecb ) meeting on thursday .
markets expect the bank to provide a clear plan for dealing with a eurozone re@@ luc@@ t@@ ant recovery , as well as for the im@@ minent de@@ fl@@ ation of only 0.@@ 3 % inflation rate .
there is spec@@ ulation that the head of the ecb , mari@@ o drag@@ hi , will be able to provide further information later this week as to whether he is going to propose quanti@@ tative eas@@ ing for the euro area , according to those from the united kingdom .
&quot; although a small growth is better than no growth at all , the bra@@ king effects of the increasing economic and geo@@ political un@@ certain@@ ties have become clearer for manufacturers , &quot; said ro@@ b do@@ b@@ son , chief econom@@ ist mark@@ it .
the factory p@@ mi for germany , russia ’ s largest trading partner in the eu , fell to the lowest level in 11 months with 5@@ 1.@@ 4 .
meanwhile , in the second largest economy in the block , france , the p@@ mi fell to 4@@ 6.@@ 9 .
france remains a trou@@ b@@ led child , as is italy ’ s decline from solid expansion to stag@@ nation .
evidence that stimul@@ us growth is in the key industry mechanism in germany and spain and the netherlands is no longer effective is also un@@ re@@ ass@@ uring , &quot; said mr. do@@ b@@ son .
the decline in industry is likely to fuel the fire of analy@@ sts who want to avoid further monetary or fiscal stimul@@ us .
positive news came from the republic of ireland , where the p@@ mi rose to 5@@ 7.@@ 3 , the highest level since the end of 1999 .
ho@@ ward ar@@ cher , chief econom@@ ist at i@@ h@@ s global insight , said : &quot; the best thing you can do for the purchasing management index of the manufacturing business is in the euro zone from august .
he added : &apos; eurozone producers find life now quite difficult , as the current increase in geo@@ political ten@@ sions - especially in terms of russia and ukraine - is un@@ certain about the remaining difficult conditions in many countries .
these increased un@@ certain@@ ties have clearly affected the economy - especially , and consumer confidence , and probably will result in some emerging orders being dela@@ yed or even cancelled .
he said that it would become &quot; increasingly likely &quot; that the ecb would eventually introduce a kind of q@@ e , &quot; although we susp@@ ect that this would be limited . &quot;
the hel@@ l@@ decade of bes@@ lan survi@@ v@@ ors : ten years have passed since the terrible sie@@ ge of the school , as the people who d@@ rank it still suffer today .
ten years ago , more than 1@@ ,000 people were killed by chec@@ hen mil@@ i@@ ti@@ as in a school in bes@@ lan in southern russia .
more than 3@@ 30 people , more than half of them children , were killed in the three-@@ day mar@@ ty@@ r@@ dom that sho@@ c@@ ked the world .
we returned to bes@@ lan to visit some of the victims who were victims of the death of the at@@ ro@@ city in the class@@ room .
exactly a decade after the app@@ alling sie@@ ge of bes@@ lan &apos;s school , at which 3@@ 34 people died , including 18@@ 6 children , the her@@ o@@ ic sla@@ ves war@@ ned the last night before a new apo@@ c@@ aly@@ pse .
as fan@@ a@@ tical islam@@ ist terrorists , children and parents were killed on 1 september 2004 , the beginning of a new school year , and they seemed like the evil gu@@ y of evil .
the tragedy united west and east in ab@@ hor@@ rence , and turned into surprise .
ten years later , we returned to bes@@ lan to visit some of the victims who died in the gre@@ u@@ el de@@ tention camp .
we found surprising young people who have overcome resistance , although the memory of this terrorist hel@@ l makes them persecu@@ ted fore@@ ver .
their best hope ?
the fact that the war that is now w@@ aging ukraine - and in which children like them die - is now coming to an end .
the girl who was photograph@@ ed in the attempt to enter the sho@@ ved school sports hall was forced to clim@@ b back into the school sports hall .
she was played by the russian star photograph@@ er di@@ mit@@ ri be@@ li@@ ak@@ ov and famous when she was only in her under@@ wear to get into the sho@@ t@@ ted school sports hall .
a@@ id@@ a was completely conf@@ used to search for her mother lar@@ is@@ sa , now 40 years old .
both were considered dead , but they survi@@ ved .
&quot; a woman told me i should race for my life , but i could not , &quot; said a@@ id@@ a then .
my leg@@ s were bloo@@ d@@ sh@@ ed .
i stood up and clim@@ bed back to my mother .
a soldi@@ er brought them to safety .
after a series of operations , she decided to be completely cu@@ red , but said yesterday : &quot; three months ago , the pain returned .
i fear that i will have to be re@@ operated .
some sh@@ ards of gran@@ ate are still in my k@@ ne@@ es .
their goal is to become a d@@ enti@@ st to help people , as they have been helped by doctors .
&quot; this tragedy changed my life , but it did not break me , &quot; she says mar@@ tial .
&quot; that happened to me , and that cannot be changed .
once a year i always go to the sports hall to remember those who were staying there .
my friends and i are trying not to talk about it on other days .
the pain is too great .
my best friend and future class@@ m@@ ate d@@ zer@@ a ga@@ po@@ eva was killed there .
we played together when we were small , dre@@ aming of being together at school .
&quot; i don &apos;t want to mar@@ ry until i finish my studies and start my career .
i am thinking of a family later .
it says that the sie@@ ge must always remain part of it , although the memory is getting weak@@ er every year .
i am glad that many people in the world remember our hor@@ r@@ ors and we are so grateful for the help we received from people in britain and everywhere .
when i see the photo online of me , how i clim@@ b back to school , i think that many people do see it for the first time , understand our disaster and contribute to that thing not happening again .
the boy who is f@@ led by the ball ho@@ ok , in the opinion that his mother was dead , was killed .
it was his first day of school ( rus@@ sians go to school at 7 years ) and survi@@ ved the three-@@ day sie@@ ge in the arms of his mother tam@@ ara .
as a se@@ ven@@ -@@ year-@@ old , he said , &apos; m@@ ama told me that i should put myself in the l@@ ur@@ ch if there were an explo@@ sion and keep your hand &apos; .
after an explo@@ sion he thought she would die .
she said to him : &apos; run &apos; .
full of fear that she could be dead , he f@@ led and saw a we@@ eping little child on the way , took it at hand and f@@ led through a ball ho@@ ok .
his father v@@ la@@ di@@ mir , who had put his son outside into his arms , said : &apos; dam@@ ir told me that his mother died .
he said : &apos; i could not save them &apos; .
in fact , tam@@ ara was st@@ um@@ b@@ led outside and in@@ ju@@ red with le@@ g in@@ jur@@ ies in the hospital , in turn assum@@ ing that her son had died .
after re@@ unification , she said : &apos; i we@@ pt before joy .
i could not believe it .
he ran in and embr@@ ac@@ ed me .
dam@@ ir was later flo@@ wn to london ( from the now dis@@ solved news of the world ) to be replaced by the then premier ton@@ y bla@@ ir and his wife ch@@ eri@@ e .
&quot; this hor@@ ror is persecu@@ ting you every day , but i wish i could stop remin@@ ding , &quot; he said yesterday .
but i can say that it is bl@@ at@@ ant in my memory .
i know that i will be able to use all my to@@ y gun@@ s immediately after that .
but now i can play computer games with shot scenes and that is no problem for me .
&quot; i am not afraid to go back to the sports hall , but i do not think about myself .
i remember these children with whom i played in the court , and who did not go out to see them .
we never say that they were killed or dead .
we say that they have stayed in the sports hall .
i remember very well my trip to london , especially the to@@ y store , where i could choose everything .
but now he is afraid of the place like ukraine , where wars cause the kind of mis@@ fortun@@ e he and his friends suffered .
this hor@@ ror is following you every day , but i wish i could stop thinking that .
&quot; i am so sorry for all those who suffer from the ab@@ om@@ inations , &quot; dam@@ ir said , who was volunte@@ er last week in a monaster@@ y .
i am happy to help .
i want to go to the police one day and hope that you will be able to take me to the school academy next year .
his mother tam@@ ara , 48 said : &quot; 37 children from our neighbourhood were killed , they can imagine that ?
i remember the terrible silence after the sie@@ ge , there were simply no children who were calling and che@@ ering .
she is vi@@ vi@@ dly remin@@ ded of her trip to london with dam@@ ir .
the people of london we@@ pt when i told our story .
i understood then how people on the other side of the world can understand our feel@@ ings and their support .
she was ch@@ eri@@ e bla@@ ir and her foundation grateful for the prize and the opportunity to travel to london in the autumn of 2004 .
i wish i could call ch@@ eri@@ e and just tell her that 10 years have passed , but i always wonder what i was going to do for her and her hus@@ band in london , and how that dam@@ ir and me helped .
i remember dam@@ ir lo@@ v@@ ingly calling for bor@@ sch@@ ts@@ ch to eat and have all the local russian restaurants called .
i remember him talking to wa@@ it@@ ers in a restaurant , and dam@@ ir was sho@@ oting with his water gun on them and they ran away and played with him .
and that was only a month after the hor@@ ror .
i was surprised that the british were so willing to share our pain and supported us .
she said : &apos; i always think that this world has not improved in these 10 years .
in ukraine , the war is continuing and people are dying every day , and i believe that many children have been killed and still are being killed .
these are just such children as ours .
i think that for many of the war is part of the news you hear when you are bo@@ red or with something else .
i simply know what these people feel , the whole hor@@ ror .
and i cannot stop feeling that .
nothing has changed , people still want to kill each other and that is so sad .
dam@@ ir became big and is a very gent@@ le and calm boy , he is not aggres@@ sive or an@@ gr@@ y at all .
for example , he is not looking for reven@@ ge , he is not overwhel@@ med by past ab@@ om@@ inations .
i know that he does not like to recall that , but he has six close friends from the class and they occa@@ sion@@ ally go to the sports hall and ign@@ ite c@@ and@@ les there .
when he was smaller , he suffered - i remember he was sometimes on the so@@ fa@@ -@@ bed that was the face of us , hours of sun@@ shine .
not sle@@ eping , his eyes were open .
i also remember him all his weapons and other military games .
i can hardly believe that i was so sure for a few hours that he was dead and i would never see him again .
when i reco@@ vered after the explo@@ sion and got on my feet , i looked around and saw the hel@@ l around me , with all around me , with body parts .
i was absolutely sure that my little boy in this hel@@ l could have survi@@ ved .
&quot; i remember listening to him , &quot; i said , &quot; dam@@ ir , run away , &quot; but i was also so sure that he could not hear me .
but he has heard it and he has gone away .
and thus life , unlike many others , continues for us .
geor@@ gi@@ j il@@ y@@ in , 17
the boy whose terrible image after the sie@@ ge to the symbol of the ab@@ om@@ inations of bes@@ lan was killed .
comfort : the bes@@ lan survi@@ v@@ or geor@@ gi@@ j ly@@ in with his mother fa@@ tim@@ a after the sie@@ ge of 2004 , right a picture of geor@@ gi@@ j today , right a picture of geor@@ gi@@ j on the right .
his bloo@@ d-@@ ex@@ u@@ ber@@ ant face was fri@@ ghten@@ ed when he ran around his life , while chec@@ hen terrorists were destro@@ ying his class@@ mates .
his image was one of the most sho@@ cking symb@@ ols of the bar@@ bar@@ ism of bes@@ lan .
his mother fa@@ tim@@ a , 54 , a doctor , had taken him to school for his first day before she rus@@ hed to give her el@@ der son v@@ la@@ di@@ mir to university .
&quot; i left the court about two minutes before the terrorists stor@@ med it , and so my little boy remained there for three terrible days alone , &quot; remin@@ ds me .
not quite alone , there was a whole family of rela@@ tives of us , but they were all killed .
only my geor@@ gi@@ j managed to survive .
the closer this date approaches , the more difficult it is to think about and talk about it .
there is not a single day on which we cannot remember this tragedy .
we do not think it has been a long time ago , i think it would have happened yesterday , some scenes from these days are watching me fore@@ ver .
nobody will ever forget that , i promise you .
the picture of geor@@ gi@@ j ( left ) was one of the most sho@@ cking of the attack and was used as a stat@@ ue ( right ) .
i remember that geor@@ gi@@ j was so happy to go to school on that day , he said he wanted to hu@@ g his teacher .
i knew that he was alive when i first saw him on television .
and now there is even this stat@@ ue of the we@@ eping geor@@ gi@@ j in san mar@@ ino .
geor@@ gi@@ j does not like the picture , and it is in our home on the book@@ shel@@ f .
i understand that , but i also think that people all over the world can feel our pain thanks to this image .
geor@@ gi@@ j says today : &apos; it is important that this never happens again .
&quot; i doubt that we will ever know the truth .
people are constantly investig@@ ating such trag@@ e@@ dies and never learn the truth .
and now they are investig@@ ating the cr@@ ash of this bo@@ eing in ukraine .
will we ever know what caused it ?
this world is becoming a bit terrible .
&quot; i can not understand how this is possible , because if you ask people , no one wants a war , so how is that done ?
ten years is nothing of such pain .
we need do@@ z@@ ens of years to forget it a little .
it has att@@ acked my health and i still feel it .
for about three or four years i had a few night@@ ma@@ res because of the sie@@ ge , but then it became better .
i went to school later in 2004 and was afraid every day .
i thought to my friends and class@@ mates who were killed .
that is why i always go to the sports hall when 1 september approaches .
i want to pay tribute to my old child@@ hood friends .
it is difficult for me to go to the sports hall , but i must do it .
i do not feel like a victim , this story is now part of my past .
i will not forget it , but i am not sorry .
my life goes on .
i finished school this year and i visit a medical college in v@@ la@@ di@@ ka@@ w@@ ka@@ z .
i will become a heart sur@@ ge@@ on .
my first choice was an army training .
i wanted to become a soldi@@ er , but my health didn &apos;t allow it .
i wanted to fight for my country , but that will not happen .
geor@@ gi@@ j fan@@ i@@ ye@@ v , 20
the boy who survi@@ ved , although he was at the foot of a mur@@ der@@ ous terrorist , was a man of peace and security .
a mir@@ acle : geor@@ gi@@ j fan@@ i@@ ye@@ v was at the foot of a mur@@ der@@ ous terrorist while sie@@ ge , but he managed to find a way to survive .
during the sie@@ ge he was caught in the sports hall and sat next to the bom@@ b which was at the foot of a mur@@ der@@ ous terrorist .
it is a real mir@@ acle that he was not killed .
&quot; we feel it was yesterday , &quot; says geor@@ gi@@ j , who was a secret service officer of the f@@ s@@ b , but this because of his health damage due to the sie@@ ge , could not do so .
it is still with me , it is not something i have left behind .
i am now older and people say that children can easily handle bad experiences - i have to say that is not true .
&quot; in 2006 i worked with psycho@@ logi@@ sts and then felt a little better , but i can not forget it .
and i would like to forget .
2005 - in the year after - was the first and only time that i went back to the sports hall .
i lost consci@@ ousness .
i will never return to that country again and please do not ask me to show you where i have sat in this famous picture .
survi@@ v@@ ors : geor@@ gi@@ j fan@@ i@@ ye@@ v today , with a photo of himself in hospital after the sie@@ ge on the lap@@ top .
my pain is mon@@ strous and i wear it every day .
my friends know that i do not like to think about it or talk about it , and they never asked me about school .
i am physi@@ cally well off .
i should be careful with my w@@ oun@@ ded k@@ ne@@ e , but i can now run well .
but because of my health , i could not attend the f@@ s@@ b secret service academy in saint pe@@ ter@@ sburg , as i wanted .
i have my documents , including the medical ones , and you have rep@@ lied that it is not possible .
my second passion was the animals , so i went to the veter@@ inary institute .
i have been there for two years .
he lear@@ ns the treatment of all animals &quot; from c@@ ats to co@@ ws &quot; .
he said : &apos; i knew that i would never tell my children of my experiences .
children should not know about this and they should not , of course , suffer it .
his mother marina , 42 , said : &quot; this pain never leaves me .
he is worse in my soul when the anniversary approaches .
i will be comm@@ em@@ or@@ ating the celebra@@ tions .
i know that geor@@ gi@@ j will not go there .
he still needs to be much more violent because he was there and i did not .
i wa@@ ited at home and could not help .
i am so grateful to god that he has been returned to me , and here in bes@@ lan , all of them are drawn .
it remains in us .
geor@@ gi@@ j is now an adult , but this hor@@ ror is still in him .
it is difficult to accept this when something so unfair is being met .
he is a boy , he li@@ kes sport , but he cannot participate because of his k@@ ne@@ es .
he has been operated on several occasions , but he can not do any sport .
i would say that he has reduced the hor@@ ror to 50 % , but it is never entirely possible to overcome it and forget it .
this terrible experience will always follow us .
many friends and neighbours were killed during the sie@@ ge and this only ag@@ gra@@ v@@ ated my pain .
i have lost many people i knew well and which were expensive to me .
my son is with me , and this is the greatest gift that god could make me , but my heart we@@ ars to the sla@@ in .
i know of families where new children were born , but also wi@@ do@@ ws who have never been married again .
it is hard to accept that life goes on , even if you do not want it .
i will never forget how my heart jum@@ ped in me when i saw him in the hospital .
and now i see what is happening in the world - wars in other regions .
what are these people fighting for ?
why are they killing each other ?
the war is now very close to our country and i almost cannot believe it .
we used to be a friendly country , how can it be that we are now fighting ?
people and children are suffering , i am sure that many children have already been killed in ukraine and many are still killed .
if we only use and throw out all these re@@ be@@ ls - as far as possible .

the world was bre@@ a@@ thing in 2004 when the baby al@@ j@@ ona was born in the arms of a russian polic@@ em@@ an from the bes@@ lan sie@@ ge .
the terrorists left them , but kept their 30@@ -@@ year-@@ old mother , the 10-@@ year-@@ old si@@ ster k@@ ri@@ st@@ ina and her brother ma@@ k@@ ha@@ r in school sports hall in their cru@@ el@@ ty .

4 tips for better under@@ water photos and videos .
if you like to take photos or videos under water , there is a selection of devices .
the most affordable option is a water@@ proof poin@@ t-@@ and-@@ sho@@ ot , like the ni@@ kon cool@@ pi@@ x aw@@ 120 or a acti@@ ve-@@ card .
i took these photos at a family festival with several cameras , all at a price of less than $ 3@@ 50 .
regardless of the equipment , there are some rules for the best results .
check your equipment twice .
even if you have a water@@ proof camera , make sure that the battery is not too hot and does not bur@@ n .
put your camera on the photos or videos you want to record .
some cameras and cam@@ cor@@ ders have scene and recording modes that allow the camera to be exposed to the d@@ us@@ k and d@@ amp@@ ened sub@@ mer@@ ged conditions .
and before you jum@@ p in , check to what depth your equipment is functional .
some cameras are only allowed for up to 5 feet , others up to 50 or 60 feet .
search our shopping guide and the reviews for digital cameras for conventional and water@@ proof models .
do multiple rec@@ ord@@ ings - because many will not work .
poin@@ t-@@ and-@@ sho@@ ot cameras have an l@@ cd that lets you comp@@ ress images .
even if you have an l@@ cd , it is difficult to see this under water and the right image setting is a lu@@ cky matter .
so you make many pictures .
if your camera has a row mode that allows you to capture a series of images with slightly changed exposure settings , use it .
stay close to the surface .
the light is dram@@ atically worse as it moves away from the surface .
so if possible they stay close to the surface when you take pictures in a pool , a lake or the sea .
this allows you to bring more color to your photos ; the de@@ eper you go , the less color you will see .
go close to the objects .
this is also good advice on land , but it is all the more important under water because of poor lighting conditions .
it is particularly important that you are connected to an action c@@ am : these devices often have a fixed wide angle lens , which means that the camera can be po@@ e@@ tically align@@ ed to your objects when they are connected to the entire frame .
andre@@ w law@@ son was a man of the variety whose character changed things even in such a gi@@ gan@@ tic organization as the n@@ h@@ s .
as an advisory an@@ aes@@ the@@ sia doctor , he devoted his career to helping patients both face ag@@ ony and to the disease .
among his patients , his wife re@@ members , was a mi@@ 6 employee who was confron@@ ted with the dev@@ ast@@ ating effects of torture .
law@@ son knew that doctors would be better served by diagno@@ sis and disease , while treatment was more often associated with something completely different .
one day in 2007 , however , he was the person whose path began .
&quot; i did not feel like it , &quot; he wrote in may of this year .
i had difficulty getting up .
while he was dealing with influ@@ en@@ za symp@@ t@@ oms , he noticed that he was giving his wife ju@@ li@@ et im@@ pati@@ ently re@@ pro@@ ach .
&quot; i want everything to be done immediately rather than later &quot; , he noted .
as ju@@ li@@ et spent a week on a business trip , law@@ son felt very un@@ usually and without reason wor@@ ried .
something was in the air .
he asked a colleague to carry out an x-@@ ray inspection of his bre@@ ast .
only two weeks ago he was in the french alps for skiing .
the results of the x-@@ ray inspection were available .
he suffered from mes@@ o@@ the@@ li@@ om , an incur@@ able cancer that caused the bre@@ ast fur , that is , the skin over@@ flow@@ ing with the lun@@ gs .
as with most can@@ c@@ ers , the exact cause is usually difficult to determine .
for example , while some smo@@ kers are suffering from l@@ ung cancer , not all l@@ ung cancer patients have been smo@@ kers earlier .
but mes@@ o@@ the@@ li@@ om is different .
in almost all cases , the tri@@ gger is an as@@ be@@ sto@@ s load - contact with the fi@@ bre which was once considered a &quot; mir@@ acle &quot; but has since been recognized as le@@ th@@ al .
for most of us mes@@ o@@ the@@ li@@ om is a disease that can easily be ignored .
as@@ be@@ sto@@ s is , after all , a product of the past .
the most dangerous as@@ be@@ sto@@ s type has not been used in britain since the 196@@ 0s , when the industry volun@@ tar@@ ily committed to stop using it .
even where it was still in use , only people in certain sectors worked directly with the fab@@ ric - pl@@ um@@ ber , construction workers , car@@ p@@ ent@@ ers and shi@@ py@@ ard workers , for example .
as an industrial hazar@@ dous material from another era , it seems that it is hardly worrying today .
but this com@@ plac@@ ency is in@@ appropriate .
britain , it seems , is experiencing the cul@@ min@@ ation of a mes@@ o@@ the@@ li@@ om ep@@ ide@@ mic today .
there are more mes@@ o@@ the@@ li@@ om@@ a deaths here than anywhere else in the world .
with a total of 2,@@ 500 deaths per year , twice as many people die of this disease as in road accidents .
annual figures of mes@@ o@@ the@@ li@@ um deaths since 1980 and expected future deaths in the uk are estimated to be around 10 % of the year in the uk .
the reason why we are now seeing the dead@@ ly effects , when as@@ be@@ sto@@ s has been illegal for years ( in 1999 all as@@ be@@ sto@@ s types were banned ) is that a mes@@ o@@ the@@ li@@ um only develops after decades .
and the s@@ cour@@ ge of the mes@@ o@@ the@@ li@@ um is not limited to former workers in the construction industry .
as@@ be@@ sto@@ s was , and is still often present , in the houses we live in , the offices in which we work , the schools where we learn and the shops in which we shop .
and therefore mes@@ o@@ the@@ li@@ om does not know any class barriers , financial limits , profes@@ sions or age .
the privileged bas@@ tions , from the elegant department stores in london to private schools , are not a protec@@ tive area .
parliament &apos;s buildings are contam@@ inated with as@@ be@@ sto@@ s .
in hospit@@ als too , where we are supposed to be healthy , we are already starting out from this dead@@ ly car@@ cin@@ og@@ ens .
andre@@ w law@@ son was not old .
he was not a pl@@ um@@ ber either .
he was indeed hard to imagine that he would be able to deal with as@@ be@@ sto@@ s .
then he found it out .
&quot; it looks as if the tun@@ nels on the gu@@ y &apos;s hosp@@ ital@@ . where i have spent six years training , there are many more .
all - students , nur@@ ses , doctors and par@@ ish - use the tun@@ nels .
one won@@ ders how many of my con@@ tempor@@ aries will suffer from the same ill@@ ness ?
unfortunately , he was able to answer this question at least in part .
&quot; of the four doctors who participated in the gu@@ y &apos;s hospital , and who were in the last five years to mes@@ o@@ the@@ li@@ om , &quot; he wrote .
how many of us will still be si@@ ck ?
andre@@ w law@@ son was born in mes@@ o@@ the@@ li@@ om at the age of 48 .
when he died on 17 february this year , he was 55 .
this was an un@@ usually long survival time .
fif@@ ty percent of all mes@@ o@@ the@@ li@@ o@@ si@@ ac@@ al diseases die within 8 months of diagno@@ sis .
the disease always ends up fat@@ al .
we can therefore only repeat the question of law@@ son : &apos; how many of us will still be si@@ ck ? &apos;
britain &apos;s leading expert on mes@@ o@@ the@@ li@@ om , professor ju@@ lian pe@@ to , assum@@ es that between 18@@ 70 and 20@@ 50 , when as@@ be@@ sto@@ pi@@ ds were in the uk , it is expected that they will come to a hal@@ t .
most of them have no idea at the moment that they will die .

a quick look at the files of the courts , to which the parties concerned often apply for compensation , shows how far the s@@ cour@@ ge of the mes@@ o@@ the@@ li@@ om is already spread .
in june of this year , for example , marks &amp; sp@@ enc@@ er ad@@ mitted that jan@@ ice was neglig@@ ently exposed to as@@ be@@ sto@@ s .
she worked for nine years for the chain , from 197@@ 8 to 198@@ 7 , and was responsible for the clothing department at two locations - one of them the flag@@ ship store in ox@@ ford street .
m@@ r@@ s. allen was only 18 years when she started her business at m &amp; s .
now she has two children in the tw@@ en@@ ties .
&quot; before this thing , &quot; she says , &quot; i had never heard of mes@@ o@@ the@@ li@@ om , i didn &apos;t even know anything about as@@ be@@ sto@@ s .
i never thought that would affect me .
there are few people who know a lot about as@@ be@@ sto@@ s .
the fact is that the term as@@ be@@ sto@@ s is not a substance , but a group of six min@@ er@@ als .
the name deri@@ ves from the word &quot; as@@ be@@ sto@@ -@@ style &quot; , a description of the fi@@ bre structure that makes the fab@@ ric resistant and flexible .
three of the six were used in the construction industry .
ch@@ ry@@ so@@ tile , also known as white as@@ be@@ sto@@ s , is by far the most common as@@ be@@ sto@@ s in buildings today .
it has been designed for roof tiles , floor tiles , ro@@ h@@ s insul@@ ation , bo@@ iler insul@@ ation , even for bra@@ ke p@@ ads in cars .
it is less fat@@ al than other forms of as@@ be@@ sto@@ s , but it is nevertheless described by the eu and the who as a &apos; great health risk &apos; with possible death .
but the brown as@@ be@@ sto@@ s ( am@@ os@@ ite ) and blue as@@ be@@ sto@@ s ( k@@ ro@@ ky@@ dol@@ ith ) are more dangerous .
britain was once the world ’ s largest im@@ porter of brown as@@ be@@ sto@@ s , and experts susp@@ ect that &apos; there are clear but indirect indic@@ ations that this is a major reason for the uni@@ qu@@ ely high mes@@ o@@ the@@ li@@ um rates &apos; .
a staff member at marks &amp; sp@@ enc@@ er was trained in the flag@@ ship store in ox@@ ford street , london , as@@ be@@ sto@@ s exposed al@@ am@@ y al@@ am@@ y .
jan@@ ice allen may not have been a typical mes@@ o@@ the@@ li@@ om@@ op@@ per , but ju@@ li@@ an pe@@ to de@@ bu@@ ted in his work to suggest that her story is not un@@ common .
he has presented a study of the stakeholders , which shows that &apos; a significant proportion of mes@@ o@@ the@@ li@@ omas are produced without a known suspension by work or in the house probably due to as@@ be@@ sto@@ s contact in the environment &apos; .
much of these contacts , according to him , are based on the &quot; normal use and aging &quot; of our buildings .
it looks as if no one can be sure .
a report by go@@ d@@ d@@ ard consulting , which describes the palace of west@@ min@@ ster , shows how people can live in the heart of the government , un@@ kno@@ w@@ ingly exposed to the substance .
in 2009 , go@@ d@@ d@@ ard reported that service p@@ acks and pi@@ pes behind the com@@ part@@ ments of parliament were contam@@ inated with as@@ be@@ sto@@ s , whose dead@@ ly fi@@ b@@ res were destroyed by something as harm@@ less as &apos; strong air movements &apos; .
members of parliament are often accused of stri@@ ving for their own interests , but it seems that dre@@ aming of the opposite is the case .
while the management of the parliamentary labour force insi@@ sted that the west@@ min@@ ster palace be a &apos; clean health certificate &apos; , it is now in@@ dispu@@ table that 1 billion people spend on work on several years .
the go@@ d@@ d@@ ard report also pointed out that &apos; the existence of as@@ be@@ sto@@ s is not regulated in accordance with the relevant provisions &apos; .
no one can know whether this mis@@ management will cost lives .
all that can be done now is waiting .
a person who has never exactly determined contact with as@@ be@@ sto@@ s is gra@@ ham ab@@ bot@@ t , a general medical practi@@ tion@@ er .
as andre@@ w law@@ son susp@@ ects , the 50@@ -@@ year-@@ old ab@@ bot@@ t is susp@@ ected of having been exposed to as@@ be@@ sto@@ s during his work in hospit@@ als .
&quot; i worked in a hospital where as@@ be@@ sto@@ s complaints were posi@@ tively decided , &quot; he says , &quot; but i can &apos;t prove it in my case .
it is so difficult to remember all the places where work has been done and the data .
what he re@@ members is the day at the beginning of december 2009 , when he was holding such a fe@@ ver .
he was 45 , and was carrying out an operation just late in the evening .
suddenly i had a sha@@ king fro@@ st .
it all suddenly happened .
i felt terrible .
i thought that the journey home was no longer possible .
as a doctor , ab@@ bot@@ t knew that the pain from the ch@@ est co@@ at , the skin around his lun@@ gs , was sti@@ r@@ ring up .
but , like jan@@ ice allen , he had no reason to susp@@ ect a mes@@ o@@ the@@ li@@ om .
he did not go to work for a month .
cur@@ ious doctors made x-@@ ray rec@@ ord@@ ings of his bre@@ ast and put ple@@ ur@@ a@@ ka@@ the@@ ther in order to remove flu@@ id from the lun@@ gs and test it in the laboratory .
his complaints , however , remained without diagno@@ sis .
his health was slowly improving and he returned to work .
from time to time , however , the symp@@ t@@ oms returned , often after sporting activity and intense attack .
in 2011 , a patient ab@@ bot@@ t with similar symp@@ t@@ oms came to his practice and was later diagno@@ sed with mes@@ o@@ the@@ li@@ om .
but even now , ab@@ bot@@ t did not associ@@ ate this with his own case .
after all , his patient was several decades older and had worked directly with as@@ be@@ sto@@ s .
the connection in the case was clear .
in september 2011 , ab@@ bot@@ t ’ s condition deterior@@ ated again , and his family doctor brought his c@@ t sc@@ ans and x-@@ ray sho@@ ts to a group of experts .
in december 2011 , exactly two years after ab@@ bot@@ t first became ill , he was re@@ signed to a camera equipped son@@ de in the ca@@ ve between the ri@@ b and the sea .
i am an optim@@ ist .
i usually continue , &quot; he says .
to be honest , i did not have so many concerns .
but rac@@ hel , my wife , was wor@@ ried .
the result of the bi@@ op@@ sy was a week between christmas and new year : &quot; i was told that there was mes@@ o@@ the@@ li@@ om . &quot;
gra@@ ham ab@@ bot@@ t : diagno@@ sis mes@@ o@@ the@@ li@@ om
suddenly , ab@@ bot@@ t had appoin@@ t@@ ments with mac@@ mill@@ an nur@@ ses , of whom one recommended that he should seek a law@@ yer .
only now did he understand the scale of the ep@@ ide@@ mic .
&quot; it turned out that as@@ be@@ sto@@ s was very common , especially in large public buildings where pi@@ pes are often insu@@ lated with as@@ be@@ sto@@ s , &quot; he says .
the people who have been exposed to as@@ be@@ sto@@ s in these buildings are now si@@ ck .
and so mes@@ o@@ the@@ li@@ om is now meeting younger people who have not worked in the typical profes@@ sions .
the most dangerous pi@@ pes with as@@ be@@ sto@@ s insul@@ ation in hospit@@ als were located below the earth , so patients were probably not exposed to the substance .
but many employees who work in pede@@ strian tun@@ nels from one building to another ( like andre@@ w law@@ son ) or in underground tun@@ nels , are not allowed to work .
it is evident that , over several decades after the war , hospit@@ als may have been life@@ -@@ saving for patients , but life@@ -@@ threat@@ ening for the doctors involved .
it is still being removed today .
students put their bun@@ s@@ cape bur@@ ners on as@@ be@@ sto@@ s mat@@ s .
it does not just concern hospit@@ als .
as@@ be@@ sto@@ s was developed for the production of the most modern , highly isolated and fl@@ ame re@@ tar@@ dant materials in offices , shops , libraries and town h@@ alls .
schools too .
indeed , many people probably have the first contact with as@@ be@@ sto@@ s in the class@@ room .
throughout the country , thousands of chemical lessons , students have their bun@@ ch bur@@ ners on as@@ be@@ sto@@ s mat@@ s .
on websites , the theme as@@ be@@ sto@@ s is often raised in schools .
meanwhile , inno@@ cent objects in our homes , such as floor tiles or d@@ and@@ ru@@ ff s@@ acks , have as@@ be@@ sto@@ s by default .
&quot; it is an industrial po@@ ison that is contained in large parts of our properties , &quot; says andre@@ w mor@@ gan , the law@@ yer who is andre@@ w law@@ son in his trial against gu@@ y &apos;s hosp@@ ital .
in one case , the only contact that occurred to a woman concerned was the demo@@ lition of a gar@@ d@@ ening sc@@ al@@ p in the 197@@ 0s .
so make sure you have your gar@@ d@@ ening sh@@ ed cut off .
the impact of diagno@@ sis , and the knowledge that the disease is incur@@ able , is immen@@ se .
&quot; it takes a while to process it , &quot; says gra@@ ham ab@@ bot@@ t .
i went back to work and tried to continue , but i realized that i could not concentrate on what i was doing .
i was in practice for two weeks .
then i knew that i would go and take care of myself .
well , i will not see another christmas .
the most difficult thing was the change of perspective from the position of a doctor to that of a patient .
like countless patients before him , he re@@ members how overwhel@@ med he is by all the information he has rightly received .
&quot; it was very difficult to record all this , &quot; he says .
&quot; i asked my doctor &quot; how long do i still have ? &quot;
and i was given about 12 months .
i remember thinking that &quot; na ja , i &apos;ll not have another christmas day , but i &apos;ll be there again .
that was then &apos; .
mes@@ o@@ the@@ li@@ om is particularly insi@@ di@@ ous because it is our life@@ -@@ saving mechanism - bre@@ a@@ thing itself - that is caused by fat@@ al cancer .
most mes@@ o@@ the@@ li@@ om@@ a cases are caused by as@@ be@@ sto@@ s contact .
as@@ be@@ sto@@ s consists of small@@ est fi@@ b@@ res .
if as@@ be@@ sto@@ s is bur@@ nt and fi@@ b@@ res are in@@ hal@@ ed , they can be absor@@ bed in the ch@@ est co@@ at , the skin around the lun@@ gs .
as@@ be@@ sto@@ s fi@@ bers ir@@ rit@@ ate the ch@@ est co@@ at and may cause cell mu@@ tations .
&quot; the problem ar@@ ises from the in@@ hal@@ ed nee@@ d@@ le-@@ shaped as@@ be@@ sto@@ s fi@@ bers , &quot; says professor tom treas@@ ure , a heart / thor@@ a@@ x doctor who passed to the gu@@ y &apos;s hospital in 2001 .
the hospital andre@@ w law@@ son susp@@ ected of having been in prison for as@@ be@@ sto@@ s is now mista@@ ken .
treas@@ ure knew law@@ son and treated some other , who probably also had to be in hospital during their training in hospital .
once the as@@ be@@ sto@@ s nee@@ d@@ les reach the l@@ ung tissu@@ e , says treas@@ ure , &quot; will they be sent from the bre@@ a@@ thing process to the edge where the skin is .
it is in@@ he@@ ren@@ tly inv@@ a@@ sive from the beginning .
the usual options for other can@@ c@@ ers work in mes@@ o@@ the@@ li@@ om not so good .
the effectiveness of an operation , for example , is highly controversial .
some say that it is worth trying .
treas@@ ure den@@ ies that .
&quot; you can &apos;t cut the ch@@ est co@@ at , &quot; he says .
you don &apos;t get around with the k@@ ni@@ fe .
meanwhile , cancer spe@@ aks &quot; on chem@@ other@@ ap@@ y not very good , &quot; the &quot; effect &quot; , but not he@@ als .
&quot; sometimes there are long-term survi@@ v@@ ors , &quot; says treas@@ ure .
but in the end they all die .
fortunately , some patients actually live long , much longer than expected .
the author ste@@ ph@@ en j@@ ay g@@ ould died 20 years after the diagno@@ sis .
two and a half years after his own diagno@@ sis , gra@@ ham ab@@ bot@@ t is still strugg@@ ling .
after cont@@ acting mes@@ o@@ the@@ li@@ om , ab@@ bot@@ t came into contact with andre@@ w law@@ son , who was diagno@@ sed with a one-@@ man support and re@@ medi@@ al consulting office for co-@@ affected persons four years after his diagno@@ sis .
&quot; hel@@ lo , cancer center , &quot; he asked himself about calls happ@@ ily .
&quot; he was very positive , &quot; says ab@@ bot@@ t .
he had received his diagno@@ sis 4 years earlier and was still very active .
originally , ab@@ bot@@ t had six chem@@ other@@ ap@@ y cy@@ cles , which las@@ ted four months and would probably only last for one month .
&quot; i was desper@@ ate , &quot; he says .
i wanted to give up .
however , law@@ son managed to &apos; do things in a somewhat more positive light . &apos;
after consulting several doctors , ab@@ bot@@ t decided to continue his treatment with prof@@ . lo@@ ic lan@@ g-@@ la@@ z@@ dun@@ ski , heart / thor@@ a@@ x specialist at gu@@ y &apos;s .
&quot; we had an advantage by not having to be forwar@@ ded , i just called on and got a date , &quot; says gra@@ ham .
a normal patient would have to be re@@ funded and wait for the treatment to be approved .
money is crucial to mes@@ o@@ the@@ li@@ om suff@@ e@@ rers to obtain the best available therap@@ ies .
but when these treatments inevitably fail , they are often the cause of a different financial concern - over and above the future of families they are leaving .
and so they turn to the courts in the hope of compensation .
andre@@ w law@@ son cont@@ acted andre@@ w mor@@ gan of field fish@@ er water@@ house ll@@ p .
&quot; it is known since 18@@ 98 that as@@ be@@ sto@@ s is extremely dangerous for health , &quot; says mor@@ gan .
but what changed in the 19@@ 60 ’ s is that it was recognized that a very small burden would also present a health risk .
and here , the neglig@@ ence of companies began to play a role .
andre@@ w law@@ son and gu@@ y &apos;s hospital put their case in the end , but it was not what mor@@ gan called a &quot; full compensation . &quot;
after the investigation into his death , a gu@@ y &apos;s spo@@ kes@@ man confirmed that &quot; as@@ be@@ sto@@ s fi@@ b@@ res in the cel@@ lar area affected in the 199@@ 0s were removed &quot; .
this was a late occasion for andre@@ w law@@ son .
how as@@ be@@ sto@@ s can be removed
indeed , mes@@ o@@ the@@ li@@ om suff@@ e@@ rers who seek compensation are a huge problem .
many of their former employers have been sold or closed .
insurance documents can be lost .
and those who oppose claims know that the time for them is to do so , but certainly not with the pla@@ in@@ ti@@ ffs .
in response to this , there have been clear new legislation this year , which allows for the easier access to a compensation for mes@@ o@@ the@@ li@@ om suff@@ e@@ rers , even if their former employers are no longer found .
the law has created a market fund of 3@@ 50 million £ for all supported by the insurance industry , which is diagno@@ sed after july 2012 , a contact which is not a guarantee to anyone .
in these cases , the pla@@ in@@ ti@@ ffs receive 80 % of what a court can do in a normal compensation process - about 1@@ 20@@ ,000 £ .
about 300 successful applications for the programme are expected each year .
andre@@ w mor@@ gan thin@@ ks like so many mes@@ o@@ the@@ li@@ om suff@@ e@@ rers that £ 3@@ 50 million is a &quot; very good work &quot; of the insurance industry .
&quot; this is a deal of insu@@ rers for insu@@ rers , &quot; he says , and suggests that the insurance is a sum of one quarter of what insu@@ rers would have to pay if the time had not been over@@ taken .
mi@@ ke pen@@ ning , the former labour and pension minister , also ad@@ mitted that the law &quot; is not perfect &quot; .
but both pen@@ ning and mor@@ gan ad@@ mitted that , with seven deaths a fast and rapid response was needed every day .
&quot; people are suffering so much and need help today , &quot; said pen@@ ning during the second hearing of the mes@@ o@@ the@@ li@@ om law in december of last year .
at that time , gra@@ ham ab@@ bot@@ t had been in the hands of professor lo@@ ic lan@@ g-@@ la@@ z@@ dun@@ ski for 19 months .
after their initial consultation , lan@@ g-@@ la@@ z@@ dun@@ ski recommended an operation which , unlike tom tre@@ ad@@ ur@@ ie , had a positive effect .
this was done by a radiation therapy and chem@@ other@@ ap@@ y - a tri@@ ple therapy , which has been used to treat long la@@ z@@ dun@@ ski a survival rate of up to 40 % over five years .
ab@@ bot@@ t felt strengthened .
&quot; this is of course the most important thing , &quot; says ab@@ bot@@ t .
this is seen time and again in patients .
there is something that lets you continue .
when you give up , you will get worse very quickly .
gra@@ ham ab@@ bot@@ t was the president of the operation in march 2012 .
at the end of august , he had the last of the six chem@@ other@@ ap@@ y cy@@ cles .
after@@ -@@ care scan@@ ners showed no signs of disease .
then i had a s@@ can in march 20@@ 14 .
there were several cancer spots around my ch@@ est .
i was just 50 .
this is not life@@ -@@ threat@@ ening .
that is a life@@ -@@ ending exercise .
again , ab@@ bot@@ t under@@ went six chem@@ other@@ ap@@ y cy@@ cles .
there is no tr@@ ace of the t@@ um@@ ours left .
but the process is physical and psycho@@ logical very stren@@ u@@ ous .
they must think about practical things - about the money , if i am no longer , for example , or my wife , how the bo@@ iler time setting works .
if you receive bad news , you will be negative .
they must look forward .
as el@@ lie &apos;s father , 16 , and tam@@ s@@ in , 14 , this is not always easy .
&quot; for parents , that is difficult , &quot; he says .
it is hard to know what to say and how much .
when i was diagno@@ sed first , i told my girls that i had a disease i didn &apos;t want to get old .
they re@@ acted in very different ways .
tam@@ s@@ in is very soci@@ able and im@@ bu@@ ed .
she told her friends and soon we got a lot of calls .
el@@ lie was more re@@ stra@@ ined .
she did not say much .
such talks are something that all cancer patients must per@@ cei@@ ve .
but for mes@@ o@@ the@@ li@@ o@@ car@@ b@@ ons , such talks are not driven by hope , not by a tr@@ ace of hope for survival .
the disease ( as well as ste@@ ph@@ en j@@ ay g@@ ould ) brings a gri@@ m security .
as andre@@ w mor@@ gan says , &quot; mes@@ o@@ the@@ li@@ om is not life@@ -@@ threat@@ ening .

china is ref@@ using hong kong to be elected in government , demonstr@@ ators swe@@ ar re@@ tali@@ ation , and the chinese are re@@ luc@@ t@@ ant to re@@ tali@@ ate .
on sunday , despite the increased calls for democratic reform , the chinese parliament decided against nom@@ in@@ ating candidates for the 20@@ 17 elections by the hong kong elec@@ tor@@ ate .
this is probably the reason why pro@@ tests in hong kong have been announced for so long , while activi@@ sts have been dela@@ ying planning and mobili@@ zation within a few hours of the announcement .
the decision of the chinese people ’ s congress allows communist leaders to ban all non-@@ beijing candidates in principle .
&quot; this is not un@@ expected , but it makes us an@@ gr@@ y , &quot; said legal expert em@@ ily la@@ u , chairman of the democratic party .
that is not what beijing promised .
the people of hong kong have been lied to .
and it is clear that we are dealing with an author@@ itarian regime .
in his defense of china ’ s decision , li fe@@ i , vice secre@@ tar@@ y-@@ general of the standing committee of the national people ’ s congress , said that the approval of public nom@@ inations in the elections to the hong kong government would be too &apos; cha@@ otic &apos; .
since 1997 , when britain lost control of hong kong to the chinese , beijing has promised to re@@ patri@@ ate the chinese from 20@@ 17 .
china ’ s leaders presented sunday ’ s decision as a democratic break@@ through , because it offered hong kong ’ s citizens direct voting rights , but the decision also makes it clear that china ’ s leaders are changing the process through a nar@@ ro@@ w@@ ly controlled beijing tea .
a new clause also states that candidates should only be &apos; with love for the country and love for hong kong &apos; .
the decision follows a summer in which some of the largest and most public@@ -@@ sphere pro@@ tests in hong kong have been taking place for several years .
behind hong kong &apos;s pro-@@ democracy campaign , the occup@@ y central movement with love and peace is standing , whose organiz@@ ers have threatened to dis@@ miss the financial district .
on sunday evening , within a few hours of the announcement , hundreds of occup@@ ants had been forced to fle@@ e the re@@ vol@@ t in the rain outside the government headquarters in hong kong .
the demonstration was attended by the organiz@@ ers saying that their movement would lead to a new level of civil dis@@ o@@ be@@ di@@ ence and that they would have planned protest waves in the coming weeks .
they did not provide any further information , however , apparently to avoid problems with the authorities .
in an online communication , the organiz@@ ers announced that the movement &quot; the occupation of the central district was only a last resort .
we are sorry to have to say that all the opportunities for dialogue have been exhaus@@ ted today and that the occupation of the central district will definitely take place .
the hong kong authorities have been preparing for the beijing announcement for days , and g@@ 8 was scheduled to take place on sunday .
the distur@@ ban@@ ces are caused by the feeling of many in hong kong that they are slowly losing control of their city .
the migration of people from the main@@ land is increasing competition for products and services .
there is also growing fear that hong kong &apos;s values , such as democracy and freedom of speech , will become bro@@ o@@ ked under growing pressure from beijing .
some cri@@ tici@@ zed the demonstra@@ tions of the occup@@ y centr@@ al movement , as they were destro@@ ying business operations - hong kong &apos;s li@@ fel@@ ine .
&quot; the pro@@ tests they are talking about could cause great economic damage , depending on how many are involved and how long they last , &quot; said law@@ -@@ experts .
we do not want to raise fears that hong kong will get out of control .
this impression is bad for investment .
china ’ s state@@ -@@ controlled media recently reported about the democra@@ tically elected activi@@ sts in hong kong as being led by western powers .
this summer , activi@@ sts organised an un@@ official referendum on electoral rights , involving 7@@ 8@@ 0,000 people .
in july , tens of thousands participated in one of the largest democratic demonstra@@ tions in the region ’ s history .
the tradition of the school gradu@@ ate b@@ alls in the us is now transferred to universities , where fres@@ h@@ men perform on private aircraft .
we are pleased to respond to this demand and to offer the first luxury travel service in britain for students of today .
to make a particularly impressive appearance at the university , the company also offers transport options such as private aircraft , roll@@ s-@@ roy@@ ce ph@@ an@@ tom , ast@@ on mar@@ ten or m@@ cla@@ ren p@@ 1 .
mr ste@@ w@@ art also said that the service has a security section .
this service is an ideal alternative for students who otherwise want to improve their hab@@ its in a danger@@ ously over@@ loaded car .
together with our new vi@@ f options , we look forward to this year ensuring that students can start the university with a minimum of effort and maximum level of luxury .
a company spo@@ kes@@ man said that no new book@@ ings are available , as the service has just been introduced , added a new book@@ ings to the list of &quot; students who will book the service in the next few weeks &quot; .
the company also announced that , despite the tu@@ ition fees of £ 9@@ ,000 per year , there was a market for this offer .
students today differ in their expectations and expectations from those of 10 , 20 , 30 or 40 years ago - it is more important than ever to make a great first impression , and with vi@@ f you can do just that .
the national student union , however , critic@@ ised the service as being ab@@ sent .
me@@ gan dun@@ n , vice president of the n@@ us for higher education said : &quot; this offer seems to be completely separate from the lives of the majority of students .
many students who start stu@@ dying this month are facing a crisis of living costs , as the available financial assistance in the form of loans and grants is not available with the very rising levels of b@@ ills for the simpl@@ est living conditions .
fem@@ ini@@ sts cri@@ tici@@ ze r@@ aci@@ al issues and police behavior in fer@@ g@@ us@@ on
the un@@ armed te@@ en@@ ager was killed by a police officer in fer@@ g@@ us@@ on , mo at the beginning of this month .
the participants lif@@ ted their hands into the air and san@@ g , &quot; hands high , not sho@@ ot , &quot; while waiting before the fun@@ eral .
after two weeks of pro@@ tests in fer@@ g@@ us@@ on , mo , due to the sho@@ oting of the un@@ armed te@@ en@@ ager michael brown , the blo@@ gger mi@@ ri@@ am zo@@ il@@ a per@@ e@@ z noticed a change in the game .
in their experience , white fem@@ in@@ ist comm@@ ent@@ ators put the gender before the race when it comes to re@@ productive law and income inequality .
but , as ten@@ sions in the middle west rose and received attention throughout the country , pe@@ re@@ z saw that white women ’ s answers were 100 % r@@ aci@@ al .
compared to the answers given by black women shortly after the sho@@ ts of 9 august , personal es@@ says with tit@@ les such as &quot; thoughts to fer@@ g@@ us@@ on by a white woman &quot; and &quot; fem@@ in@@ ism is not only about the women .
but for pe@@ re@@ z , that meant an important change .
&quot; i do not think that fem@@ in@@ ism can find many people who know what and have privile@@ ges in such a high class way , &quot; she said .
people felt ur@@ ged to do something about the events .
it is characteristic of the crisis we are experiencing and because the situation in fer@@ g@@ us@@ on is so eth@@ n@@ ici@@ zed that it must be expressed .
for the lec@@ ture@@ r , k@@ ori@@ th@@ a mit@@ ch@@ ell , from o@@ hi@@ o state university , fer@@ g@@ us@@ on brought to light problems to which black american women are exposed every day but are not considered women &apos;s issues .
&quot; i can do something fun on fac@@ e@@ book about me and my partner and get 150 li@@ kes from anywhere , &quot; said mit@@ ch@@ ell .
if i post something about how colo@@ red in your own country are under sie@@ ge , silence is ear@@ -@@ looking .
&quot; how can women be sure to talk publicly about a relationship , but not about public security ? &quot; asked her .
for black women like mit@@ ch@@ ell , the race , sex and sex@@ u@@ ality in the history of the us , there is no dic@@ ho@@ tom@@ y between race and sex .
for them , black women have not had the luxury of divi@@ ding the topics ne@@ at@@ ly ; they live every day in the combined reality .
while white women are now discussing race and gender issues in the fem@@ in@@ ist main@@ stream , the german chancell@@ or ang@@ ela h@@ at@@ tery says that women and gender issues should be addressed .
&quot; between 18@@ 65 and 18@@ 90 at least 10@@ ,000 black men were gel@@ y@@ n@@ cht and the ra@@ pe of a white woman , &quot; said h@@ at@@ tery .
white women had to be involved in history to prevent ly@@ n@@ ch@@ mur@@ ders .
for h@@ at@@ tery , the division between white and black women came at the point where white figh@@ ters were fighting for women ’ s electoral law , such as sus@@ an b@@ . an@@ th@@ ony , and the country in the late n@@ ine@@ teenth century .
&quot; they decided to op@@ t for women &apos;s electoral law , and the right to vote for black should come later , &quot; said h@@ at@@ tery .
when you remember such things , you are power@@ fully aware of why colo@@ red women do not trust white women .
we did not do our job well .
we have never helped black women to find their hus@@ bands and s@@ ons .
even after women were given the right to vote in 19@@ 20 , it took another decade for white women to fight the ly@@ n@@ ch in the association of southern women .
the group was created almost 40 years after the original request for help from black women , says mit@@ ch@@ ell .
for mit@@ ch@@ ell , the flo@@ od of white fem@@ in@@ ist responses to the concerns raised by fer@@ g@@ us@@ on - police behaviour , r@@ aci@@ al discrimination - is a reflection of the time when white fem@@ ini@@ sts &apos; catch &apos; .
&quot; would it not be great if the activi@@ sts who have such traditional fem@@ in@@ ist platforms had the right to raise a child as seriously as they would be ?
second generation fem@@ ini@@ sts who want to continue their career in the struggle for reproduction rights and access to contrac@@ ep@@ tive means are now looking for a new way of understanding what that means .
the well-known white fem@@ in@@ ist acti@@ vis@@ t gl@@ oria ste@@ iner went to the united states two weeks after michael brown ’ s sho@@ oting and released a po@@ in@@ ert article from re@@ be@@ c .
&quot; i hope that women who have a different but parallel reason to take a position in@@ he@@ rent to the body will understand - and opinions on the race , the body is in public opinion po@@ lls , are significantly different - the changes will lead to .
although ste@@ iner is in favour of a rather inter@@ sec@@ tional fem@@ in@@ ism , in which r@@ aci@@ al as well as gender issues are addressed , some of her comments on r@@ aci@@ al issues in america are ast@@ oun@@ ding .
christ@@ ina som@@ mer , resear@@ cher at the american enterprise institute and author of who st@@ ol@@ e fem@@ in@@ is@@ m ? , said to her that she is the best young men in the united states , especially young far@@ b@@ is .
there are now hundreds of special programmes for girls and young women , but almost nothing for bo@@ ys .
but when the white house recently launched a small program , my brother &apos;s ke@@ eper , to protect vulnerable young black and heat spanish men .
the police relationship with the black community is not the only problem that has come to the fore in main@@ stream fem@@ in@@ ism .
after the us border police have carried out nearly 6@@ 3@@ ,000 un@@ accompanied min@@ ors on the sou@@ th@@ west border of the country this year , the issue of immigration reform is also returning to the surface - this time as a women &apos;s issue .
andre@@ a mer@@ c@@ ado , co-@@ chairman of we bel@@ ong together , an organization that provides women with a role in immigration reform , said that a new dimension is needed to re@@ consider the issue as a major women ’ s issue .
&quot; they speak for themselves , &quot; said mer@@ c@@ ado .
if the vast majority of work vis@@ as to male immigrants go , women , who are accompanied by them , are in a position where they are considered to be responsible for domestic violence and exploitation .
&quot; these stories find a lasting presence in women &apos;s organisations , &quot; she said .
&quot; pi@@ g@@ gy house &quot; in ip@@ sw@@ ich is for sale in the netherlands .
the image of a house for sale has been removed by real estate agents when it became clear that it was a big pi@@ g that it could easily be made in the living room .
the de@@ t@@ ached house has one bedroom , located on a private road in ip@@ sw@@ ich and is offered for £ 1@@ 20@@ ,000 .
details included an image of the living room of the house - including a pi@@ g , a por@@ k that had his head on a sof@@ a - and the details of the room .
real estate bro@@ ker conn@@ ell@@ s said that the pi@@ g in the photo is the pet of the owner .
&quot; the photo was , however , wr@@ ong@@ ly published and has since been removed &quot; said a spo@@ kes@@ person of the company .
the ex@@ po@@ é of the house described the former meeting room of the former con@@ gre@@ gation as a &quot; unique one-@@ family house with one bedroom &quot; .
although the bro@@ ker may have removed the image from the website , it still appears on advertising material .
the sale of homes has been of interest to the social media when some asked whether the pi@@ g was included in the purchase price .
the s@@ w city har@@ ve@@ y is home to a new million dollar lo@@ t@@ tery after lo@@ t@@ tery win .
a har@@ ve@@ y lo@@ t@@ tery will be released this month .
the search for a new mil@@ li@@ on@@ air@@ e in the sou@@ th@@ west of per@@ th continues , with a happy winner who has left the lo@@ t@@ tery drawing on saturday almost $ 1.@@ 1 million .
a newspaper ki@@ os@@ k in har@@ ve@@ y moved to the j@@ ack bar for the second time in five years .
the lu@@ cky winner must still report .
the store owner ste@@ ve forward said that winning is a concern for talking in the small town in the sou@@ th@@ west of per@@ th .
the city is talking about nothing else , and everyone is pretty ex@@ ci@@ ted .
we thought that such a profit could occur .
eight wa winners won pri@@ zes last month in the first division , a prize winner of the first few lu@@ cky weeks for the players in the state .
last week , a can@@ ning val@@ e player was killed in the first two months of august after a couple of bel@@ mon@@ t cou@@ ples left the me@@ ga@@ -@@ winning of 7.@@ 5 million dollars .
the winning pair had played for twenty years and said that the profit allowed them to travel the world and buy a new home .
the mil@@ li@@ on@@ air@@ e from har@@ ve@@ y is the 5@@ 9@@ th winner of the first division in the wa this year , with a total of almost $ 85 million .
leon@@ id@@ as asked for the gla@@ di@@ at@@ orial arena to be opened .
not only the gla@@ di@@ ators were an@@ k@@ le deep in the mat@@ sch at the first r@@ ö@@ mer@@ tag in the leisure park .
but the attr@@ action of the event was strong enough to attract more than 1000 visitors yesterday , who were watching the rain sho@@ wers and the autumn cold de@@ fy and were able to enjoy the historic spectac@@ le .
there was a color@@ ful range of representa@@ tions , performances , games , exhi@@ bits and information about the time of the roman@@ s and their importance for the r@@ hin@@ eland .
the main attr@@ action of the day was undoubtedly the mar@@ ti@@ alist figh@@ ter force from the gla@@ di@@ at@@ orial school &quot; am@@ or mor@@ tis &quot; , which took every ra@@ iny break to the stage in which with soft sand preparation was applied .
gla@@ di@@ ator owner &quot; leon@@ id@@ as &quot; proved to be a hum@@ or@@ ous and expert presentation .
first , the pro@@ voca@@ te@@ urs were on the line with rec@@ tan@@ gu@@ lar shi@@ eld and short s@@ word , and leg@@ s on the left le@@ g and arm rail on the right arm .
the &quot; es@@ se@@ d@@ ari@@ i &quot; followed with bre@@ ast shi@@ eld , short s@@ word and thro@@ wing l@@ ance , and iron gla@@ di@@ ator hel@@ met , le@@ g and arm protection .
the performance of the &quot; reti@@ ari@@ us &quot; , which was accompanied by a thro@@ wing net , a tri@@ ple and a dol@@ ch against the &quot; sec@@ ut@@ or &quot; , was particularly impressive and the bur@@ s@@ ese came to the ground after a short fight .
as s@@ words are scr@@ at@@ ching to each other , the sch@@ ap@@ per@@ ten shi@@ el@@ ds and the tur@@ f lan@@ ces flo@@ wn sur@@ ren@@ der through the arena that gives a fear and b@@ low to the health of the gla@@ di@@ ans .
but the imposing &quot; sum@@ ma ru@@ di@@ us &quot; , which had a mus@@ cu@@ lar re@@ fe@@ ree , had always been a atten@@ tive eye .
&quot; we wanted to revi@@ ve everyday roman life and to revi@@ ve the culture of the roman era , &quot; lor@@ en@@ z e@@ us@@ kir@@ chen , chairman of the organiz@@ er &quot; fre@@ un@@ desk@@ re@@ is r@@ ö@@ mer kan@@ al &quot; , explained .
after two years of preparation , the theme park became an op@@ pi@@ d@@ um roman@@ um for one day , a roman town , as vice may@@ or cl@@ aus w@@ re@@ h@@ age said in his gre@@ e@@ ting .
after all , the roman@@ s have not only brought war and con@@ quest to our region , but also the roman culture and numerous buildings that we still adm@@ ire today .
the remains of these were also to be seen at the roman day , such as &quot; aqu@@ educ@@ t mar@@ ble &quot; by the ele@@ ven meter high and 14@@ 00 meter long roman canal bridge , which was once built by l@@ ü@@ f@@ tel@@ berg .
the fron@@ tin@@ us society provided the water and energy supply once and now , and managing director pe@@ tra fr@@ ic@@ ke knew : &quot; we are still using the knowledge of those days &quot; .
this is confirmed by the diplom@@ a surve@@ y@@ or r@@ alp@@ h he@@ ili@@ ger of the &quot; engine@@ er team two &quot; from rhe@@ in@@ bach , the measuring instruments of the roman@@ s such as ch@@ or@@ ob@@ at , gro@@ ma or di@@ op@@ pe .
the roman@@ es@@ que villa in blan@@ ken@@ heim presented s@@ ket@@ ches and models of exc@@ av@@ ations an@@ no 18@@ 94 and br@@ ic@@ ks from the original hypo@@ cau@@ ca@@ sian , the warm air he@@ ater , which once served as the home of the world .
the foot im@@ print , which is used by wol@@ f and fu@@ ch@@ s two mill@@ en@@ nia ago in the foot@@ steps of sound , before the foot prin@@ ts bur@@ ned .
in 2011 , the office for land@@ mark conservation had the over@@ t@@ ones of a roman villa in the industrial park nor@@ d in r@@ hin@@ bach .
you have seen the walls of an economic building with a dar@@ re to dry gra@@ in and to m@@ ill .
the building probably had to be converted to a villa rus@@ tic@@ a , an agricultural property , explained the archae@@ o@@ log@@ ist dr. j@@ enni@@ fer mor@@ sche@@ is@@ er .
a number of finds from these exc@@ av@@ ations were made in a glass display , including a large t@@ ent , several f@@ lower glass vessels and a part of a delicate nec@@ k .
the villa was probably built from the first to the fourth century ad to christ , until the german@@ s arrived in the then roman r@@ hin@@ eland .
the children also engaged in the roman wind@@ m@@ ill game , similar to the m@@ ill game of today , or they wrote as the roman times did their names with metal gri@@ ps on wa@@ x boards .
at the bo@@ oth of the roman thermal ba@@ ths z@@ ü@@ l@@ p@@ ich the children were allowed to put their own mo@@ sa@@ ics , at the stand of the glass museum rhe@@ in@@ bach glass mo@@ sa@@ ics and at the stand of the nature centre ei@@ fe@@ l net@@ ter@@ sh@@ ei@@ m .
with the “ ch@@ ill@@ -@@ out ” of two cold flowers , the original roman tro@@ l@@ le@@ y@@ bus tr@@ uc@@ ks were used to transport visitors through the leisure park and also came to the impressive sta@@ dium of the city gy@@ m@@ na@@ si@@ um .
the first one was a week of roman studies from 13 to 21 september , and the town of w@@ ach@@ t@@ berg will also be entering the r@@ hin@@ eland roman year 20@@ 14 , which was remin@@ is@@ cent of the death of emper@@ or au@@ gu@@ st@@ us 2000 years ago .
together with the national and historical associations and the w@@ ach@@ t@@ ber@@ ger wan@@ der@@ -@@ vere@@ in , the partnership association and the am@@ ani@@ en@@ spi@@ el@@ kre@@ is ob@@ er@@ b@@ ac@@ he@@ m will be presenting them@@ atic hi@@ kes , lec@@ tures and cooking even@@ ings .
for example , a roman legi@@ on@@ na@@ ire is being de@@ vi@@ ated from his work on the zu@@ g w@@ ach@@ t@@ berg , plants are being cultiv@@ ated as living monuments from the roman era and a fun@@ ny lesson in international understanding .
the ad@@ endor@@ fer ele@@ mentary school is dedicated to the roman@@ s in a project week .
the roman week is intended to bring together the many , but often no longer visible , trac@@ es of the roman@@ s in w@@ ach@@ t@@ berg .
the w@@ ach@@ t@@ ber@@ ger ra@@ th@@ aus offers a small presentation to the find of the ber@@ k@@ um@@ er mat@@ ron sanc@@ tu@@ ary in 18@@ 7@@ 9 .
e@@ bol@@ a : the ep@@ ide@@ mic is bur@@ d@@ ening west africa ’ s economy
the e@@ bol@@ a ep@@ ide@@ mic in west africa is also a serious b@@ low to the economy .
markets are or@@ ph@@ an@@ ed - and international companies are di@@ stan@@ cing themselves .
the dev@@ ast@@ ating e@@ bol@@ a ep@@ ide@@ mic is giving western africa &apos;s economy a heavy b@@ low .
the har@@ v@@ est ro@@ ta@@ tes in the fields , the mines are abandoned and the markets or@@ ph@@ an@@ ed - the virus has inf@@ lic@@ ted severe damage on the region .
some international companies are also already di@@ stan@@ cing themselves .
&quot; the e@@ bol@@ a ep@@ ide@@ mic is not only a medical crisis , but also an economic one , &quot; the head of the african development bank , don@@ ald k@@ ab@@ er@@ u@@ ka , jud@@ ged .
liber@@ ia is the hard@@ est hit .
&quot; it is a total disaster , we lose a lot of money , &quot; says al@@ ha@@ ji b@@ am@@ o@@ go , who is the second largest market in liber@@ ia &apos;s capital , mon@@ ro@@ via &apos;s clothing .
the only thing that comes onto the market is who can supply food or something for dis@@ inf@@ ection against e@@ bol@@ a .
liber@@ ia is hard@@ est hit by the virus , but here alone the fe@@ ver fell more than 600 people .
recently , health agencies said that the disease was spread to every corner of the country .
in gu@@ ine@@ a , sier@@ ra le@@ one and ni@@ geria , too , the virus has spread .
in total , more than 15@@ 00 people died , thousands more were inf@@ ected .
foreign companies attract employees
across res@@ our@@ ce-@@ rich countries , companies are setting up their operations .
foreign companies such as the steel company ar@@ cel@@ or mit@@ tal are attrac@@ ting their employees , several international airlines are no longer flying to the affected regions .
local trad@@ ers and farmers are also re@@ acting : few merchan@@ ts are still leaving their homes to buy back .
in some areas of sier@@ ra le@@ one and liber@@ ia , which are quar@@ ant@@ ine , there are the most dangerous areas for exports , such as co@@ co@@ a and coffee be@@ ans .
farmers d@@ are not pay for the har@@ v@@ est .
food is scar@@ ce
&quot; people will travel less and less &quot; , says phil@@ li@@ pe de v@@ re@@ yer , paris expert for west africa &apos;s economy .
for example , the man who normally goes to the market and sel@@ ls his vegetables is better at home .
the population is therefore directly and urgently affected by the ep@@ ide@@ mic : food is being scar@@ ce .
markets are falling in stocks of basic food@@ stuffs such as rice .
at the same time , the region heavily dependent on international companies is threat@@ ening to damage its image , with far-@@ reaching consequences .
the greatest danger is that international companies will generally avoid the area for a long time , says phili@@ ppe hu@@ g@@ on of the french think tan@@ k ir@@ is .
the key is how far and how long the virus will spread .
investors may have the impression that &apos; it is dangerous to invest in gu@@ ine@@ a , sier@@ ra le@@ one and liber@@ ia , and thus to invest too &apos; , hu@@ g@@ on war@@ ns .
the disease also affects the eu &apos;s member states &apos; hard national budgets .
the disease also affects the already stra@@ ined national budgets of the states concerned .
the mo@@ o@@ dy &apos;s credit rating agency fears that its budget will be heavily influenced by the high expenditure on the health system and , in addition , by the wor@@ sen@@ ing economy .
the african development bank has already promised to provide the health systems of the countries concerned with $ 60 million ( eur 45 million ) .
the effects are also felt in ni@@ geria , where few e@@ bol@@ a cases have been diagno@@ sed so far .
although the o@@ il@@ -@@ rich region of the southern ni@@ ger del@@ ta has not been affected .
but elsewhere , many people are already left in the country for fear of cont@@ ag@@ ion .
reservations in hotels also go down significantly .
protect your celebr@@ ation of the 50@@ th anniversary
the sch@@ ü@@ tz@@ en@@ vere@@ in &quot; t@@ ann@@ en@@ wal@@ d &quot; bern@@ ga@@ u celebra@@ tes its 50@@ th anniversary from september 12@@ th to 14@@ th .
the sch@@ ut@@ z@@ vere@@ in t@@ ann@@ en@@ wal@@ d is preparing for the 50@@ th anniversary of the founding of the festival in the high reach@@ es of september 12@@ th to 14@@ th .
the plan is on friday , september 12@@ th , a big evening with the group &quot; dor@@ fro@@ ck@@ er &quot; .
on saturday , the great b@@ ö@@ ll@@ er@@ sch@@ nit@@ t is at 6 p.m.
then the large t@@ ent of the mo@@ od evening with the &quot; sto@@ ap@@ fal@@ zer sp@@ it@@ z@@ bu@@ am &quot; is in the big f@@ es@@ tive t@@ ent .
br@@ ass band provides the music and the music of the music .
highlights on sunday are the celebr@@ ation service and 9.@@ 30 am in the par@@ ish church and the great de@@ tention at 2 p.m.
in the afternoon , the federal and gau@@ ge sho@@ oting prize will be distributed .
a particularly beautiful sight will be the 25 women who will be celebr@@ ating their dir@@ n@@ d@@ l@@ n .
fe@@ st@@ k@@ ap@@ elle is the br@@ ass band bern@@ ga@@ u .
the pat@@ ron@@ age has been given by may@@ ors wol@@ f@@ gan@@ g wild and secretary of state al@@ bert fü@@ r@@ ack@@ er .
the original term &quot; sch@@ ü@@ tz@@ en@@ ges@@ ell@@ schaft t@@ ann@@ en@@ wal@@ d bern@@ ga@@ u &quot; dates from 19@@ 07 when the association for &quot; social entertainment by means of exercise in the room studies and small cal@@ li@@ graphy sho@@ oting &quot; was founded on 21 march .
the na@@ zi regime had abol@@ ished the association in 19@@ 37 .
only in 196@@ 4 did 19 young men find themselves again , who were in the gu@@ es@@ thouse lu@@ k@@ as on 30 april the &quot; new &quot; sch@@ ü@@ tz@@ en@@ vere@@ in &quot; p@@ ann@@ en@@ wal@@ d &quot; bern@@ ga@@ u .
kar@@ l march and ad@@ ol@@ f ried led the club as a protec@@ tor through a difficult early period , when it was mainly about getting a united europe .
as early as the autumn of 196@@ 5 , the sch@@ ü@@ tz@@ en@@ vere@@ in im gas@@ th@@ aus &quot; le@@ in@@ inger &quot; started with two teams in the la@@ p competi@@ tions .
in the following years , sports sho@@ ot@@ ers , who have now been organized in seven teams , established themselves in all classes , right up to the 1st ga@@ ul@@ lig@@ a .
the club records are all about the year and the magic b@@ ound@@ ary of 3@@ 80 r@@ ings was first mentioned by ru@@ di me@@ i@@ er in 1980 .
just as the performance of the active sho@@ ot@@ ers has increased , the number of members has also improved .
after the club &quot; le@@ in@@ inger &quot; no longer meets the requirements of a modern sho@@ ot@@ ers &apos; association , the d@@ aim@@ ler board of the time , led by jo@@ han@@ n r@@ in@@ n , decided to join the bas@@ ement rooms .
after a work performance of 27@@ 00 hours , on 8 may 198@@ 8 , pri@@ est str@@ ass@@ er gave a lec@@ ture for the new sho@@ ot@@ ings .
one of the great highlights in the history of the association was certainly the 4@@ 4th ga@@ ul@@ s@@ sch@@ aus@@ en , cou@@ pled with the sole@@ m@@ n con@@ sec@@ r@@ ation of the new sho@@ ot@@ ers flag in july 1991 .
on 23 and 24 april 1994 , the sch@@ ü@@ tz@@ en@@ vere@@ in celebrated its 30@@ th anniversary .
in 1995 a b@@ ö@@ ll@@ er group was established .
jo@@ se@@ f sch@@ mal@@ z@@ l was b@@ ö@@ ll@@ er@@ re@@ her speaker .
a big challenge for the b@@ ö@@ ll@@ e@@ rer and for the association as a whole was the orientation of the bav@@ arian b@@ ö@@ ll@@ er@@ tre@@ ff@@ en 2005 .
in many hours of volunte@@ er work , the members of the association last year opened the premises and the sho@@ oting facility in the bern@@ ga@@ u court and thus updated the technology .
ele@@ ven teams in la@@ p competi@@ tions
the sporting performances of the sho@@ ot@@ ers &apos; association can also be seen .
a total of ele@@ ven teams are currently participating in the la@@ p competi@@ tions : six air@@ ri@@ f@@ le teams , an air gun team , a sports gun k@@ k@@ 1 , a youth and two ah@@ -@@ teams .
the first team with lars ell@@ rich , k@@ ath@@ ar@@ ina ell@@ rich , ste@@ ff@@ i gra@@ d and ker@@ sti@@ n kel@@ ler@@ mann was in the round of 2013 / 14 by the gau@@ ob@@ er@@ lig@@ a ( highest league in sch@@ ü@@ tz@@ eng@@ u ) .
the second team with ve@@ ren@@ a mo@@ os@@ bur@@ ger alex@@ and@@ ra me@@ i@@ er , eva sch@@ u@@ h@@ mann and to@@ bi@@ as gram@@ l was elected by the gau@@ lig@@ a nor@@ d to the gau@@ ob@@ er@@ lig@@ a .
besides the sho@@ oting , events such as bo@@ ck@@ ste@@ chen , car@@ ni@@ val and royal ball , club excur@@ sion and christmas party have tradition .
the sho@@ ot@@ ers are also involved in this at the festi@@ vals in par@@ ish and par@@ ish .
ton@@ y ste@@ w@@ art is suffering an accident on his return to the race track .
ton@@ y ste@@ war@@ ts return to the race track , for example , hal@@ f@@ way through his race on the atlan@@ ta motor spe@@ ed@@ way .
ste@@ w@@ art went against the wall for the second time after his right front ti@@ re bur@@ st in round 17@@ 2 and ended his evening .
ste@@ w@@ art dro@@ ve his damaged car into the garage and left without talking to journalists .
his team leader ch@@ ad jo@@ hn@@ ston said that his 1@@ 4-@@ member team was disappointed that he was concentr@@ ating on the project .
&quot; i wish we had a better use and a better result for him , &quot; said jo@@ hn@@ ston .
we drive to rich@@ mon@@ d and hope that we can do better there .
ste@@ w@@ art rac@@ ed earlier on sunday evening after a col@@ li@@ sion with ky@@ le bus@@ ch and had to leave the right side of his car repa@@ ired .
&quot; i am quite hope@@ ful today that a good result will be achieved , &quot; said jo@@ hn@@ ston and added : &quot; it simply did not work . &quot;
not long after the second accident , ste@@ war@@ ts wag@@ ons were loaded into the tra@@ iler and the team had packed and was ready to leave .
ste@@ w@@ art left three nas@@ car spr@@ int cup rac@@ es after his car had won another driver at an ash course in the north of new york state and killed him .
he decided to return this week and either to visit atlan@@ ta or the next race in rich@@ mon@@ d to win a place in the persecu@@ tion .
he returned to work , while stu@@ dying the tragic incident that occurred at the end of the 20@@ -@@ year-@@ old k@@ ev@@ in ward j@@ r. , who was in a race at the road@@ side .
the authorities informed us on friday that the investigation into the cause of the accident would last at least two weeks .
no decision has yet been taken on whether ste@@ w@@ art will be charged with an acc@@ us@@ ation .
the champi@@ on of the three times received a great applause when he was presented before the race .
after a start at 12@@ th position , ste@@ w@@ art was soon hit into the first 10 and was tempor@@ arily in fourth place .
after a re@@ start in round 12@@ 2 , bush ’ s re@@ sign@@ ation was a little bit of a m@@ ess .
car with no . 18 out of control after exit from cur@@ ve 2 and col@@ li@@ ded with ste@@ w@@ art , both cars being driven against the wall .
ste@@ w@@ art continued to dro@@ wn , but dro@@ pped to number 21 .

the army also announced that in the last 24 hours seven soldiers have been killed .
ukra@@ inian president pe@@ tr@@ o por@@ o@@ sh@@ en@@ ko has previously drawn human conclusions from his army ’ s severe defe@@ at in the fight against the separ@@ ati@@ sts , and has announced changes in the supreme army leadership without speci@@ fying details .
pr@@ or@@ us@@ sian separ@@ ati@@ sts shot aircraft from the air@@ field
in the fight against ukra@@ inian government forces , pr@@ or@@ us@@ sian separ@@ ati@@ sts have , on their own account , once again produced a figh@@ ter and two military helicop@@ ters .
about 100 soldiers were also involved in batt@@ les in the don@@ et@@ sk region , or were killed , the insur@@ g@@ ents shared the russian agencies on monday .
ships of the coast@@ guard
the insur@@ g@@ ents also claimed that , for the first time in the az@@ ov sea , two boats from the ukra@@ inian coast@@ guard were sun@@ k .
ukraine ’ s border guards confirmed that two of its ships were close to the port city of mari@@ u@@ pol on sunday .
seven border guards have been in@@ ju@@ red , said a speaker in ki@@ e@@ v to the sen@@ der 1@@ 12.@@ u@@ a .
two crew members were seen as missing .
local media made russia responsible for the incident .
the separ@@ ati@@ sts also reported that several villages in the don@@ et@@ sk area were brought under their control .
diplomatic off@@ ensive in min@@ sk

alongside representatives from ukraine , russia and the os@@ ce , this should also be attended by a representative of the separ@@ ati@@ sts from eastern ukraine .
in advance , all the actors used their appear@@ ances to public@@ ise their claim .
nato does not want to break agreements with russia
nato is being strengthened by the planned dep@@ loy@@ ment in eastern europe as a result of the ukra@@ inian crisis .
nato secre@@ tar@@ y-@@ general and@@ ers fo@@ gh r@@ as@@ mus@@ sen said on monday in brussels that nato is ab@@ i@@ ding by the founding agreement of the nato russia council of 1997 .
the nato bo@@ ss , however , accused russia of a &apos; g@@ lar@@ ing break &apos; of the agreement .
&quot; today we have to face the reality that russia does not regard nato as a partner , &quot; r@@ as@@ mus@@ sen says .
documents and statements from the russian side indicate that they are &apos; looking at us as oppon@@ ents &apos; .
stronger nato presence
r@@ as@@ mus@@ sen has also announced that nato &apos;s presence in eastern europe will be strengthened .
a report on the peace process to be adopted at the nato summit in wal@@ es will ensure that &apos; we have more visible nato presence in the east &apos; , as long as this is necessary , said r@@ as@@ mus@@ sen on monday .
ki@@ e@@ v and moscow are agre@@ eing on new gas talks .
russia and ukraine have officially agreed to new talks to resolve their gas dispute .
the negotiations are scheduled for next saturday , as the russian energy minister alexander no@@ wa@@ k said on monday .
there is still a wait for a decision by the european union as to whether it will also send a representative to the talks .
the dispute over the price of gas has left ukraine with no fuel from russia for weeks .
last time , eu energy commissioner g@@ ün@@ ther o@@ et@@ t@@ inger medi@@ ated between both sides .
ukraine had war@@ ned that russia could also cut off gas supplies to europe .
europe is bor@@ ro@@ wing about a third of its natural gas from russian sources , a large proportion of which is flow@@ ing through ukraine .
mer@@ kel spe@@ aks power : tol@@ l will come &quot; quite clearly &quot; .
now the chancell@@ or once again clearly recogn@@ ises this .
a licence for all complicated details is not .
persi@@ stent concerns from the c@@ du against car tol@@ ls have promp@@ ted the c@@ su to make a significant impact .
chancell@@ or ang@@ ela mer@@ kel has called for a new eu law after continuing resistance from her c@@ du .
&quot; to put it quite clearly , it is in the coalition treaty and it will come , &quot; said the party leader on monday after the c@@ du@@ -@@ top governing meetings in berlin .
a detailed model , however , mer@@ kel did not set out for the time being .
in the black and red government programme , &apos; certain parameters &apos; are mentioned .
federal transport minister alexander do@@ br@@ in@@ dt ( c@@ su ) has made a proposal , and this is what is now being done .
the n@@ r@@ w-@@ c@@ du , however , insi@@ sts on its &apos; no &apos; to tol@@ ls on all roads .
mer@@ kel stressed that finance minister wol@@ f@@ gan@@ g sch@@ ä@@ u@@ ble ( c@@ du ) , too , is making constructive contributions to the deliber@@ ations on a draft law .
beyond the topic , he has worked with do@@ br@@ in@@ dt to find more private capital for infrastructure investment , such as the broad@@ band internet .
&quot; there is nothing special about this , &quot; sch@@ ä@@ u@@ ble had a &quot; mirror &quot; report un@@ comm@@ ented on sunday , his house is exam@@ ining its own concept to help motorway investors with tol@@ l revenue .
c@@ su head hor@@ st see@@ ho@@ fer war@@ ned that the us would not be able to introduce tol@@ l concepts in the cab@@ in@@ et against the lead minister .
c@@ du bun@@ des@@ vi@@ ze arm@@ in las@@ ch@@ et re@@ affir@@ med his objec@@ tions .
&quot; the coalition treaty never assumed that all cir@@ cles and federal roads would be wall@@ ed , &quot; said the north r@@ hin@@ e-@@ west@@ ph@@ ali@@ an c@@ du president .
in this respect , it is an important signal that see@@ ho@@ fer has now announced that he will be speaking again on the subject .
opposition to the plans also comes from the c@@ du regional feder@@ ations bad@@ en-@@ w@@ ür@@ t@@ tem@@ berg and r@@ hin@@ el@@ and-@@ pal@@ at@@ in@@ ate .
there are concerns that a tol@@ l would reduce the traffic to neighbouring countries .
see@@ ho@@ fer had to leave the city because of the tol@@ l criticism from ro@@ ws of the c@@ du coalition loy@@ alty .
the left sees plans as a serious obstac@@ le to the union &apos;s dispute .
&quot; the mur@@ ks tol@@ l is dead , &quot; said party leader ber@@ nd ri@@ e@@ x@@ inger of the &quot; new os@@ n@@ ab@@ r@@ ü@@ ck@@ er ze@@ it@@ ung &quot; ( monday ) .
&quot; with the tol@@ l , the minister fails &quot; do@@ br@@ in@@ dt wants to introduce a vig@@ net@@ te duty on all german roads to start in 20@@ 16 .
according to the coalition agreement , domestic car owners must not be charged extra .
therefore , they should be able to achieve full compensation for tol@@ ls through the motor vehicle tax .
the model may not , however , be pen@@ alised by foreign drivers on account of their nation@@ ality in accordance with eu law .
genetic dis@@ order often mis@@ diagno@@ sed with genetic dis@@ order
a british person says that she thought that , as a result of a mis@@ diagno@@ sis , she would die for many years .
kar@@ in ro@@ d@@ gers lived almost all her youth in the belief that she would live only a few years after she had been diagno@@ sed with another disease .
she actually suffered from the char@@ co@@ t mari@@ e-@@ to@@ oth disease ( c@@ mt ) - a group of in@@ h@@ eri@@ ted dis@@ orders that caused ner@@ ves outside the brain and sp@@ inal cor@@ d .
char@@ ity c@@ mt uk stated that mis@@ diagno@@ sis is a common problem for people with c@@ mt who have been diagno@@ sed with it because so little is known about it .
some 23@@ ,000 people in britain are likely to suffer from c@@ mt , which may lead to motor dis@@ orders such as mus@@ cle weak@@ ness , un@@ safe gear and cur@@ ved to@@ es .
suff@@ e@@ rers also suffer from de@@ af@@ ness or pain .
when ro@@ d@@ gers 13 was , she believed that she had died in a peac@@ e-@@ lo@@ ving at@@ a@@ xi@@ e ( fa ) , a disease with very poor chan@@ ces of survival .
ro@@ d@@ ger thought she would sit in the whe@@ el@@ chair before she would 18 , and before her 30@@ th birth@@ day die .
the mother of two children , who are 51 today , said : &apos; as a child , i knew i could not do the same as the others .
i fell down constantly and everything took longer for me .
i could never go roll@@ -@@ sk@@ ating or sk@@ ating with the other children and was often in school because of my way of going and running .
ro@@ d@@ gers said that they had been working at the age of 13 after several operations to reli@@ eve their ach@@ ill@@ es and stre@@ tch their feet their medical records , as their doctor had left the room and read that they had .
&quot; i felt guil@@ ty because i was cur@@ ious , so i have not seen anyone .
when i received a reply , i was sho@@ c@@ ked and pan@@ ic@@ ked .
i thought i was going to be in the whe@@ el@@ chair with 18 and die with 25 , and in between i would slowly lose all my abilities .
i made all this with me alone and planned my own fun@@ eral .
she said when she was 17 , she realized that her skills were not so much reduced as she could imagine .
it simply stood up and embr@@ ac@@ ed me and said , &quot; my love , i do not think you have that , otherwise you are already in the whe@@ el@@ chair &quot; .
i think you have a little less life@@ -@@ threat@@ ening .
after some genetic tests , she found a c@@ mt .
&quot; when he explained to me what c@@ mt was , i felt like i was a winner , &quot; she said .
char@@ ity c@@ mt uk has a c@@ m@@ t-@@ awareness month started , to access this disease .
the company is based in the netherlands and operates in the netherlands since the closure of the former training place .
for almost ten years , the former training center in m@@ ün@@ sing@@ en has been closed .
however , every month , mur@@ der@@ ous am@@ m@@ uni@@ tion still appears at the heart of the sch@@ w@@ ä@@ bis@@ che al@@ b bio@@ sphere reserve .
the g@@ ren@@ ades are sometimes so dangerous that they are explo@@ ited loc@@ ally .
a de@@ af@@ ening ch@@ ill h@@ its the sp@@ in@@ ning of the hear@@ ts of the bio@@ sphere reserve .
in december 2004 , the last sharp shot of the tro@@ op training center munich , which was completed in late 2005 after 1@@ 10 years of military operation , fell .
since then , the 6@@ 500 hec@@ tares of the area has been the core of the bio@@ sphere reserve sch@@ w@@ ä@@ bis@@ che al@@ b , which is situated on 13 designated trails for hi@@ kers and cy@@ cli@@ sts .
tax bur@@ dens on business people in the washington area are rising with the economic recovery .
economic recovery means more customers , more sales and new jobs .
it also means higher taxes .
government and local tax reports for domestic companies increased slightly last year , while the economic recovery acceler@@ ated , so a new public@@ ized study in the past week suggested that the firms in the washington area should be closed .
companies in the district , mar@@ y@@ land and vir@@ g@@ ini@@ a jointly paid $ 2@@ 7.@@ 6 billion to government and local authorities in the 2013 financial year , a 3.@@ 8 percent increase in revenue from 2012 amoun@@ ting to 2@@ 6.@@ 6 billion .
the government and local tax burden on businesses increased by 4.@@ 3 % last year to $ 6@@ 71 billion , compared to 3.@@ 9 % in the year before , and it was the third year of growth in succ@@ ession after several years of modest decline .
government taxes have ris@@ en more than local taxes to reach 4.@@ 3 % , according to the study carried out by the services agency seriously &amp; yo@@ ung with the center for state taxation .
more than half of the district ’ s tax revenue is from corporate taxes , while 36 % of its revenues go to mar@@ y@@ land .
vir@@ g@@ ini@@ a achiev@@ es the lowest tax revenue from companies with 28 percent .
much of the tax revenue increase is due to a recovery in business real estate values , according to researchers , which led to an increase in property taxes by 3.@@ 7 % in the year following the three con@@ secu@@ tive years of growth with growth .
while much of these profits come from large states like california , new york , and tex@@ as , the process seems to be well in the region of washington .
businesses in the district , mar@@ y@@ land and vir@@ g@@ ini@@ a jointly paid over $ 10 billion in government and local real estate taxes last year , compared to $ 9.@@ 6 billion in 2012 - an increase over a year of 4.@@ 2 % .
but the apparent recovery in real estate values in mar@@ y@@ land is not so effective in increasing government and local tax revenues , as the real estate taxes are close to more than one-@@ fifth of the tax returns of businesses .
companies in vir@@ g@@ ini@@ a and d.@@ c. pay almost half of their public and local taxes in the form of real estate taxes .
&quot; in mar@@ y@@ land , a large proportion of the properties are sold , especially in tax areas around the d.@@ c. , either by government or by non-@@ profit organizations that do not pay real estate taxes , &quot; said dou@@ gl@@ as lin@@ d@@ holm .
mar@@ y@@ land is therefore forced to concentrate much more on income taxes , for example , to provide the same services that other states offer .
the recent recovery in tax revenues by companies cannot be attribu@@ ted to the recovery of the housing market alone .
company revenues also seem to recover , according to data .
companies in the region reported income taxes at state organizations of 2.@@ 3 billion $ in comparison to 2.@@ 1 billion in the year 2012 .
mar@@ y@@ land cap@@ tured $ 1 billion in corporate income taxes , the highest amount in the region .
while the trend is in the same direction , local tax bur@@ dens on companies are not increasing even@@ ly in all three places .
the growth rate in the district was 4.@@ 3 percent , equivalent to the national average , while the mar@@ y@@ land rise was significantly higher , 4.@@ 9 percent .
only vir@@ g@@ ini@@ a reported an under@@ -@@ average tax revenue of 4.@@ 1 percent .
vir@@ g@@ ini@@ a has achieved a significant lower level of corporate income in all three areas of office ( in all three there are firm corporate tax rates ) .
the mar@@ y@@ land corporate tax rate is 8.@@ 25 percent and in the district is relatively high 9.@@ 9.@@ 9@@ 75 percent .
a comparable study by the us chamber of commerce at the beginning of this year showed that less state and local corporate taxes are required in vir@@ g@@ ini@@ a , and that there is a better overall tax climate than in mar@@ y@@ land .
the study did not examine the district .
despite the advantages , vir@@ g@@ ini@@ a is under pressure from its southern neighb@@ our .
north car@@ ol@@ ina has laws to reduce its corporate tax rates from 6.@@ 9 % this year to 6 % , the same rate as vir@@ g@@ ini@@ a , and the rate will be raised to 5 % next year .
if the state continues to achieve its income targets in the coming year , this law could reduce the state ’ s corporate income tax rate to 3 % by 20@@ 17 .
meanwhile , small businesses in the washington area seem to be doing better , and they are paying more government and local taxes , according to the latest study .
corporate taxes , which are imposed as personal income taxes by small business@@ men - a transitional structure that most small businesses are organized under - are in the district , mar@@ y@@ land and vir@@ g@@ ini@@ a increased by 20 percent to 2.@@ 4 percent last year .
researchers say that the trend and increase in corporate taxes in the whole country is likely to increase this year , with a rise in the overall multi-@@ defense revenue for the state and the local economy .
nevertheless , the space of washington may be lag@@ ging behind if federal government spending cuts are concentrated on the region ’ s labor market .
partner city : german beer for gu@@ ang@@ z@@ ho@@ u
ho@@ ps and mal@@ t - a popular combination in china as well .
german beer enjoys an excellent reputation in china .
frankfurt ’ s partner city in china now wants a bre@@ w@@ ery and also hopes for a direct flight connection between the two cities .
german beer , used in frankfurt ’ s partner city of gu@@ ang@@ z@@ ho@@ u – that is the urgent wish of the officials in china .
&quot; we would be very pleased if a german bre@@ w@@ ery would set@@ tle in our city , &quot; said the vice-@@ party secretary of the southern chinese metro@@ polis , li y@@ i@@ we@@ i , this week when visiting a sp@@ d delegation in his city .
the official of the ruling communist party of china repeatedly came to power during the discussion on this issue of the 12 million metro@@ polis .
gu@@ ang@@ z@@ ho@@ u , which is also called can@@ ton in germany , is one of china &apos;s rich@@ est cities , and li war@@ ned .
that is why people also poss@@ essed the purchasing power to buy german beer .
the hes@@ sian sp@@ d chairman thor@@ ste@@ n sch@@ ä@@ fer@@ -@@ g@@ ü@@ m@@ bel , who led the german political delegation , said to the host that he would be looking for a possible partner for the project in germany .
&quot; beer does not need much : good water , gra@@ in and jo@@ ie de vi@@ vre , &quot; he added to the party leader &apos;s lunch in gu@@ ang@@ z@@ ho@@ u .
this jo@@ ie de vi@@ vre is already being ex@@ ci@@ ted by mr li , he fl@@ at@@ tered the host .
the officials then came up with a new proposal from gu@@ ang@@ z@@ ho@@ u , with sch@@ ä@@ fer gu@@ m@@ bel , with red wine , which was served for the meal .
the chinese brand t@@ sing@@ ta@@ o is based on german bre@@ wing art .
t@@ sing@@ ta@@ o beer is produced according to the german pur@@ ity rule .
more business
a second wish from china ’ s hosts would be to have a direct flight connection between frankfurt and gu@@ ang@@ z@@ ho@@ u , vice party leader li said .
lu@@ f@@ than@@ sa had offered the flight earlier , but in 2012 it was cancelled for economic reasons .
&quot; it would be worth it again &quot; , the local politici@@ an convinced .
&quot; business traffic between our two cities is growing ever more &quot; .
at present , travellers would have to take the de@@ tour via chan@@ g@@ sh@@ a in hun@@ an province , li compla@@ ined .
the gu@@ ang@@ d@@ ong province , the capital of gu@@ ang@@ z@@ ho@@ u , also hopes for the flight .
the vice govern@@ or of the province , chen y@@ un@@ xi@@ an , expressed this wish in his con@@ vers@@ ation with the social democrats .
&quot; this is a very good idea &quot; , said sch@@ ä@@ fer@@ -@@ g@@ ü@@ m@@ bel - chinese vice minister li j@@ in@@ ju@@ n , an in@@ timate german expert , n@@ ick@@ named ass@@ ent .
a well-@@ maintained partnership
the be@@ le@@ agu@@ ered gu@@ an@@ an@@ g@@ z@@ ho@@ u party leader hopes that he will be able to lead frankfurt next year to a partnership meeting .
li y@@ i@@ we@@ i was already on the main , but not yet in this position .
it was only this year that he came into office after his pre@@ dec@@ essor had been removed from office for acc@@ us@@ ations of corruption .
the local party leader wan q@@ ing@@ lian had to go as well .
the action taken against gu@@ ang@@ z@@ ho@@ u officials is part of a nation@@ wide campaign against corruption in the party and administration led by head of state x@@ i j@@ in@@ ping with ri@@ g@@ our .
li y@@ i@@ we@@ i , the new leader , had argu@@ ed for a us company before his party career , which was highly unusual in china ’ s communist party .
before taking office in gu@@ ang@@ z@@ ho@@ u , he was a top official in fu@@ j@@ ian , where the car manufacturer v@@ w was a major work .
frankfurt is officially more than a do@@ zen town@@ -@@ tw@@ in@@ ning partnerships .
the connection to the 9@@ 000 km away gu@@ ang@@ z@@ ho@@ u is one of those that is nur@@ tured by both sides , for example with a student exchange .
last year , the 2@@ 5-@@ year anniversary of the german@@ -@@ chinese association was celebrated .
the southern chinese metro@@ polis on the per@@ l river is almost as strong as the whole of h@@ ess@@ en with its economic power .
next year , it is going to increase its gross domestic product of eur 250 billion , reported li .
the family of jo@@ an ri@@ vers &quot; pus@@ hes the thum@@ bs &quot; down the thum@@ b &quot; .
jo@@ an ri@@ vers has been in hospital in new york city since she was delivered three days ago ; her daughter showed her@@ self ho@@ pel@@ ess@@ ly that she was in the mid@@ st of a mis@@ er@@ able ill@@ ness .
&quot; thank you for your constant love and support , &quot; mel@@ is@@ sa river said today in a communication .
we are all keeping our fing@@ ers cros@@ sed .
her mother was named after her sources on thursday after an emergency for heart sti@@ ll@@ ness in a clin@@ ic at the upper east side , yor@@ k@@ ville en@@ do@@ scop@@ y , in the mount sin@@ ai hospital .
doctors deliber@@ ately keep them se@@ aled and , under close observation , until they are more satisfied with their condition , which continues to be described as &quot; serious &quot; .
the re@@ actions came from many quarters , including in the form of an overwhel@@ ming online support from don@@ ald tr@@ um@@ p , mon@@ tel wil@@ liam@@ s and kel@@ ly ri@@ pa .
environmentally friendly vacu@@ um clean@@ ers and rising wages
for cars and vacu@@ um clean@@ ers that will be on sale from today , stric@@ ter environmental standards will apply in future .
similar to re@@ fri@@ ger@@ ators and washing machines , new vacu@@ um clean@@ ers will be sent from 1 september to a label on which the buyer can at a gl@@ ance identify central data such as the energy efficiency of the device .
new cars are subject to euro 6 in the pollu@@ t@@ ant class .
there is also more money for s@@ ca@@ ff@@ ol@@ ding farmers : they receive a nation@@ wide uniform minimum wage of eur 10.@@ 25 .
amaz@@ on bu@@ ys t@@ wit@@ ch for $ 1.@@ 04 billion for $ 1.@@ 04 billion .
amaz@@ on has just confirmed what information reported on monday morning : the online re@@ tail@@ er - and video producer , and a lot of other things - bu@@ ys the video stre@@ aming service t@@ wit@@ ch for 1.@@ 04 billion $ ( $ 94 billion ) .
the announcement comes as a surprise , not because no one expected t@@ wit@@ ch to be adopted , but because it was widely believed that you@@ tube would buy the company .
three months ago , the sale of t@@ wit@@ ch to the video service of google seemed to be a cool billion .
t@@ wit@@ ch , which was only three years ago founded as ju@@ st@@ in@@ .@@ tv , was known as a general stream service - a live version of you@@ tube .
instead , it quickly became a platform for players who want to publish their bra@@ v@@ ura plays , a &quot; you@@ tube for live games &quot; , according to an in@@ sid@@ er .
the t@@ wit@@ ch interface .
and &quot; let &apos;s play &quot; , a video gen@@ re where better knowledge is the ( mostly older ) play a painting .
it is just that you@@ tube is often called if you are using t@@ wit@@ ch to describe , so the message that you@@ tube is using t@@ wit@@ ch was not mentioned .
it is a myster@@ y why the deal with you@@ tube did not come about , as the company re@@ porte@@ dly was willing to pay as much as amaz@@ on .
all we know at the moment is this statement by em@@ met she@@ ar , president of t@@ wit@@ ch : &apos; we have chosen amaz@@ on@@ .com to make it a part of our community .
another secret , frank@@ ly , is the incredible success of t@@ wit@@ ch .
for snow@@ s like me who say that they prefer to do sports than watch it , it is hard to beat the attr@@ action that is assumed to be helping others play .
it is one thing to tell a friend about the shoul@@ der at 3 a.m. while they are walking through resid@@ ent evil , and something quite different , a sp@@ in@@ ning .
all these games you could watch right now .
another problem is that many of the most popular games are e@@ go games today , so that you can watch without your own control over the perspective can be a really good reci@@ pe for head@@ aches .
i admit that the rapid procedures in which the ro@@ ger ban@@ ni@@ sters of our electronic age are entering entire games in record time are not really going to be very enter@@ taining .
but until a virtual player or hum@@ or is present , his t@@ wit@@ ch channel is probably not so interesting .
but what do s@@ cep@@ tics know about this ?
t@@ wit@@ ch is visited by 55 million different visitors per month and is the fourth largest source of internet traffic pe@@ aks .
and how exactly does amaz@@ on want to make money from it ?
it is hard to imagine that t@@ wit@@ ch is so elegant in amaz@@ on inst@@ ant video , as yo@@ lan , and the like .
but t@@ wit@@ ch has something that every company would like : thousands of young men who are adver@@ ti@@ sed as advertising clients .
as the chairman of t@@ wit@@ ch , she@@ ar , said , amaz@@ on and t@@ wit@@ ch &quot; both believe in the future of gaming , &quot; and the medium does not indicate any signs of shr@@ in@@ king , not even yet .
the h@@ ü@@ p@@ f@@ burg near the bur@@ g@@ gar@@ ten@@ fest was a lot of fun on saturday .
the concept of the organis@@ ers was right .
despite the strong ra@@ inf@@ all on saturday evening , an estimated 1@@ 200 music fans came to the open-@@ air festival in the bur@@ g@@ gar@@ ten .
at times , the entrance had to be stopped .
&quot; that was an@@ no@@ ying , &quot; said ron se@@ m , one of the organiz@@ ers .
sal@@ we@@ del l light and fun .
mat@@ ching two spanish words , ma@@ xi@@ m s@@ ach@@ ra@@ j and ron se@@ m have formed the name am@@ ula .
the open air in the castle garden of sal@@ we@@ del@@ er bur@@ g@@ gar@@ ten is supposed to show bri@@ ght@@ ness during the day and in the evening through various shows .
well , and the fun is coming on its own anyway .
this was apparent in the early saturday , when the first visitors came to the open air .
a festival for all generations had promised the organiz@@ ers .
and you have succeeded .
around the stands of the bur@@ g@@ gar@@ ten@@ wi@@ ese , sal@@ we@@ de@@ rer , as well as guests from the nearby and further surroundings , had made it comfortable .
they followed the first live performances , wi@@ ped out with the foot in the beat , enjoyed cool drinks - short : relaxation pure and enjoy@@ able were awa@@ ited .
and that all over the generations .
while some are on the ben@@ ch of the extra white sand on the beach bar , some are lying on a quarter of the wine in the vin@@ o@@ the@@ que , and others are r@@ aging in the sand .
but even for child smo@@ ke making , the volunte@@ ers had liter@@ ally all their hands full .
the larger ones used the k@@ ick@@ er@@ tables or participated in a sk@@ ate@@ board workshop that the good@@ foot@@ -@@ crew from sal@@ we@@ del developed .
until the great rain came .
just before 5.@@ 30 p.m. , he pr@@ ou@@ dly cri@@ ed to the visitors , especially families were looking for the wide and dry .
but the attr@@ acti@@ veness of the festival did not dis@@ ru@@ pt this .
&quot; more people came than expected , &quot; said ron se@@ m , who spoke of a &quot; success all along the line &quot; .
i therefore think it is very important to repeat the big party next year .
although the content and size of the event still need to be worked on , se@@ m made a first record against the popular vote on sunday .
he was an@@ no@@ yed that the invitation to visit was hal@@ ted in the meantime .
obviously , the security company had been booked with too little power .
the result is that some who had already paid no longer came to the grounds .
the response was very good .
in a first careful es@@ timate , the sal@@ we@@ del@@ er co-@@ organiz@@ er spoke of about 1@@ 200 visitors who were in the castle garden .
there were problems with sound technology .
the hi@@ p-@@ hop band bloc@@ k@@ s@@ `@@ n@@ `@@ ro@@ x bro@@ ke its performance , therefore , and it was not until the end of the show .
the techn@@ ici@@ ans were unable to produce a reason@@ ably reasonable sound .
the planned sh@@ ish@@ a loun@@ ges could not be built because the t@@ ents were closed because of a ti@@ re break@@ down .
&quot; next year , however , you will be there , &quot; says the organiz@@ er .
the premi@@ ere of the am@@ u@@ la@@ -@@ open air was more than successful by the number of visitors .
and this in bad weather .
however , the organis@@ ers have made some mistakes , which are still to be made the first time , but which must be correc@@ ted in the second edition .
also in the social network fac@@ e@@ book the organiz@@ ers must include criticism .
&quot; sorry , but for 12 euros you just expected more , &quot; says mel@@ ani@@ e me@@ i@@ er at the event page .
&quot; you have taken over a little , &quot; says e@@ le zim@@ mer@@ mann in the same place .
others do not see the initial problems as closely as they were .
i think it is very good that some people are not only st@@ up@@ id , but are also really trying to put something on their feet .
h@@ ats off ! &quot; , says ste@@ ph@@ ani@@ e j@@ enni@@ e to the am@@ ula .
now the organis@@ ers have a year to overcome these critic@@ isms .
new rad@@ om in ber@@ k@@ um : w@@ ach@@ t@@ berg ’ s land@@ mark is shr@@ in@@ king .
as expected , this is not the case .
rather , the ready installed part is waiting to be inser@@ ted into the distinc@@ tive building .
the action is in the context of a major measure : almost 50 years after the establishment of the ti@@ ra space observation rad@@ ar , the cover , called the rad@@ om , is completely renewed .
the new rad@@ ome is equipped with a di@@ ameter of 4@@ 7.@@ 5 meters a little smaller than the old one .
but the size remains world record .
the final step to complete the new case is the cap@@ ping exchange .
the upper quarter of the old case is separated and covered with a cr@@ ane .
then the last quarter of the new case will be set up .
if the weather is involved , the action is scheduled to start this week .
participants in the ice bu@@ c@@ ket@@ -@@ challenge will be able to get to know the p@@ ine forest and the surrounding area .
is@@ ab@@ elle ro@@ ber@@ ts from the uk cr@@ y so much as their ic@@ e-@@ cold water p@@ oured over their head that they could not change the bone structure of their face .
this ice bu@@ cket challenge was pain@@ fully than@@ k@@ ful .
a woman was sent to hospital after having been taken to the ice bu@@ cket challenge as much as she could have been .
is@@ ab@@ elle ro@@ ber@@ ts from the uk was so sk@@ il@@ ful that their ic@@ e-@@ cold water was p@@ oured over their head that they could not change their fac@@ ial structure .
&quot; the water was so cold that i sh@@ ou@@ ted , and while i did , my ja@@ w remained simple , &quot; she said to the mir@@ r@@ ors .
ice water is being sha@@ ken over the 20@@ -@@ year-@@ old .
is@@ ab@@ elle ro@@ ber@@ ts a few seconds before the accident occurred .
i wanted to close my mouth , but that did not go , the ja@@ w was ha@@ sty , and then i understood that something was wrong .
my mother and si@@ ster saw this and made themselves lau@@ gh almost into their p@@ ants , but i had to go to the emergency .
the 20 year-@@ old from the uk was sent to hospital to take the ja@@ w after participating in the vir@@ al trend on tuesday .
the cli@@ p has been developed to a web@@ -based and thousands of times on fac@@ e@@ book and t@@ wit@@ ter .
soon , the castle clubs will pul@@ l together again ?
finally , there has been a constant cl@@ ash between the two wol@@ fr@@ at@@ sha@@ us@@ en bur@@ g@@ ver@@ uni@@ en .
now , the board of directors is thinking about possible cooperation .
as a model for the reconstruction of the wol@@ fr@@ at@@ sha@@ us@@ er burg , the late richard di@@ mb@@ ath , former chairman of the wol@@ fr@@ at@@ sha@@ user bur@@ g@@ fre@@ un@@ de , led the project in the french gu@@ é@@ del@@ on .
a year ago , there was no good climate between the bur@@ g@@ vere@@ in and the friends of wol@@ fr@@ at@@ sha@@ us@@ en .
the positions of the council and the commission have so far been very different , as has been the case with the history of wol@@ fr@@ at@@ sha@@ us@@ er burg and possible reconstruction .
now the two camps are moving towards one another : talks are about a common approach soon .
the association ’ s board members tor@@ ste@@ n s@@ j@@ ö@@ berg ( bur@@ g@@ vere@@ in ) and her@@ bert pi@@ ff@@ l ( friends of the castle ) confirm this on request of our newspaper .
&quot; i have called mr pi@@ ff@@ l and suggested that we could sit down together once , &quot; says s@@ j@@ ö@@ berg .
he said that all members of both clubs could in future move in the same direction .
this will allow visible succ@@ esses to be achieved more quickly .
while the castle friends were waiting for the suddenly late richard di@@ mb@@ ath to last see the reconstruction of the castle at the mountain forest , the castle is still under construction .
her@@ bert pi@@ ff@@ l , second chairman of the friends of the castle , has been very pleased to hear his own information about the call .
since di@@ mb@@ ad &apos;s death , he has been standing before the bur@@ g@@ fre@@ un@@ de .
a new chairman is due to be found in a members ’ meeting in mid-@@ september .
currently , according to the 7@@ 4-@@ year-@@ old , the association has about 40 members .
&quot; after the death of my friend richard di@@ mb@@ ath , we have re@@ organized the club activities out of respect &quot; .
according to pi@@ ff@@ l , the new chairman will then go into the con@@ vers@@ ation with the bur@@ g@@ vere@@ in .
in the meantime , the castle friends could also get a current mo@@ od within their group .
there is still no candidate for the presidency , pi@@ ff@@ l says .
&quot; but i am confident that someone will find himself &quot; , he himself does not want to stand because he is resid@@ ing in bad t@@ ö@@ l@@ z .
the new chairman should be a wol@@ fr@@ at@@ sha@@ us@@ er .
the t@@ ö@@ l@@ zer wo@@ ol was involved in the project &quot; but very much like to continue working &quot; .
the different positions on reconstruction are being ignored in pi@@ ff@@ l ’ s eyes in the near future .
he hon@@ ors di@@ mb@@ ath as a &quot; mis@@ sion@@ ary &quot; who has always believed in the reconstruction of the castle .
two similar , well advanced projects in austria and france would show that this idea is not a castle of the air .
the high participation of the population and voluntary assistance from around the world make them a tourist mag@@ net .
pi@@ ff@@ l : &quot; i too was s@@ cep@@ tical at the beginning .
but over time i am more and more convinced that it is useful to have the project moving forward &apos; , but it could be a &apos; one-@@ stop feature &apos; for the flu@@ tes &apos; city .
there is nothing else here .
moreover , the project would be supported by eu grants , visitor tickets and potential spon@@ sors , believes pi@@ ff@@ l .
&quot; the idea of reconstruction does not , personally , mean that i do not want to throw it off the board &quot; , and he hopes that the bur@@ g@@ vere@@ in may be moving a little on this point .
their goal to document history first is &quot; important and good &quot; .
then we could go further .
cle@@ ver ways to save on university tex@@ t@@ books
since the cost of university tex@@ t@@ books to many students is more than $ 1@@ ,000 per year , the fast second sem@@ ester has considered the most important topic of study in mat@@ t sch@@ ro@@ e@@ der .
he inven@@ ted a bor@@ ro@@ wing system for books of students of higher sem@@ ester and offered nom@@ inal compensation to the re@@ tail@@ er to delay the res@@ ale .
&quot; my mathem@@ a@@ tical book usually costs $ 18@@ 0 , but i got it for $ 10 for a sem@@ ester and a ch@@ ick fil@@ -@@ a-@@ ke@@ ks , &quot; said sch@@ ro@@ e@@ der , 19 who used the co@@ ven@@ ant .
the data required for the last sem@@ ester would have cost him $ 4@@ 30 , he said .
he gave $ 120 .
the college administration announced that students in the college have more than 1,@@ 200 $ a year for tex@@ t@@ books and study material that it is not available to students , but that there are different cost reduction options .
online stores and creative approaches such as the sch@@ ro@@ e@@ der are increasingly the solution for students .
the ren@@ ting of tex@@ t@@ books is becoming more popular , so students can read a book for a sem@@ ester , often at a much cheaper price than buying it .
ne@@ e@@ bo inc , which has more than 250 university book@@ shops , announced that it has been re@@ tained for the rental of tex@@ t@@ books since 2011 .
industry surve@@ ys show that about a quarter of books are in the college book@@ stores last spring .
less than half of all tex@@ t@@ books are produced , according to the national association of college stores , in camp@@ us book@@ stores .
here is the one time for the best deals .
buy online online
some new books cost only one third of the price online , for which you are available in the camp@@ us book@@ shop .
the n@@ in@@ th edition of &quot; cal@@ cul@@ us &quot; v@@ no ron lar@@ won , bru@@ ce ed@@ wards and robert ho@@ re@@ t@@ ler costs almost $ 2@@ 90 , but can be found at the specialized tex@@ t@@ book re@@ tail@@ er , $ 9@@ 23@@ 99 .
used to buy used
if you want to read the notes of other or normal usage tracks , you can use a good option .
&quot; cal@@ cul@@ us &quot; is used on che@@ gg@@ .com for $ 9@@ 3.@@ 49 .
mat@@ t cas@@ ad@@ ay , 25 , gradu@@ ate student at bri@@ g@@ ham young university , says that he is on amaz@@ on@@ .com 42 c@@ ents spent on a used edition of &quot; strategy game &quot; .
the book has been sold for $ 48 .
aca@@ dem@@ ics such as ing@@ rid br@@ ac@@ ey , head of the university of mass@@ ach@@ us@@ et@@ ts at am@@ her@@ st college without walls em@@ pa@@ thy recommended students to study at their prof@@ ess@@ ors if they had previously been allowed to do so .
sometimes the updates for the seminar work are not relevant .
in such cases , older edi@@ tions can often be used for a fr@@ action of the cost of the latest edition .
besides che@@ g@@ g and amaz@@ on , hal@@ f@@ .com is also a popular alternative for used and used books from e@@ bay inc .
ren@@ ting a house in the costa del sol in spain is a great option for your holidays in the costa del sol .
the rental of tex@@ t@@ books is worth considering if you want to rent them reason@@ ably well , remember to give them back and to look at the books after the course is completed .
you can pay more than 80 percent of the costs of a newly bought book .
a student could , for example , use &quot; calcul@@ us &quot; for the duration of a sem@@ ester for about $ 20 .
find out about the terms of the business you are ren@@ ting , including the penalty fees that may apply to writing no@@ te@@ books , sign@@ atures , etc .
the ren@@ ter pays attention : if you do not return the book , the penalty fees may even exceed the price of a new book .
e-@@ books
e-@@ books , instead of conventional tex@@ t@@ books , are also an option .
sometimes these books are de fac@@ to ren@@ ted by buying an electronic license for a certain period of time from whol@@ es@@ al@@ ers such as amaz@@ on@@ .com , che@@ g@@ g and bar@@ nes &amp; no@@ ble inc@@ . .
at che@@ g@@ g you can use &quot; calcul@@ us &quot; for 6 months for about $ 61 .
br@@ ac@@ ey says that students in literature courses often find the best offers , as many classi@@ cs are downloaded free nowadays , while scientific and engineering schol@@ ars are very expensive .
look around .
jo@@ e ga@@ ult , 29 , who will soon be the pe@@ pper law school , will recommend that you take a look at the is@@ b@@ n number for price determination in books , as you can be so sure to find the right teaching material .
and before or@@ dering online , you should check , so ga@@ ult says , if the book is actually in stock .
he learned this lesson from the hard tour .
he bought a book that had four weeks delivery time and finally paid the full price in the college book@@ shop .
why &quot; guar@@ di@@ ans of the gal@@ ax@@ y &quot; is not a cash sho@@ o@@ ter ?
&quot; the exp@@ and@@ ables 3 &quot; by sy@@ l@@ ves@@ ter st@@ all@@ one played less than 30 million dollars of his 90 million dollar budget in the us , while &quot; s@@ in city : a d@@ ame to kill for &quot; .
the image of the camera di@@ a@@ z &quot; sex tape &quot; , which was tailored to the audience , played only $ 14@@ .@@ 6 million at the opening weekend , while children &apos;s films such as &quot; drag@@ on sa@@ ws easy to earn 2 &quot; also dis@@ ap@@ point .
an article of the te@@ leg@@ raph film cri@@ tic rob@@ bi@@ e col@@ lin suggests that the children &apos;s films of the lack of quality in the films themselves are the reason why .
col@@ lin called 20@@ 14 &quot; the worst year &quot; for children &apos;s films and described &quot; drag@@ on@@ flight coun@@ ting easily made 2 &quot; as pure &quot; functional &quot; fant@@ as@@ y continuation .
for films for a slightly older target group , however , it seems that the quality of the films is not necessarily the problem .
in july , entertainment weekly compared the average c@@ ame@@ o sco@@ re@@ - and me@@ tac@@ ri@@ tic rating for each summer movie start , which is between the american mem@@ orial and the world &apos;s 20th july 2013 .
the results are based on the opinion of the cinema visitors and film cri@@ tics and indicate that this year &apos;s film h@@ its are similar to those of last year .
some comm@@ ent@@ ators say that the development is due to changing visual hab@@ its and the growing popul@@ arity of web stre@@ aming services like net@@ f@@ li@@ x .
director j@@ on fav@@ re@@ au , currently working on dis@@ ney &apos;s upcoming jun@@ g@@ le book film , is said to have been a friend of the ho@@ ll@@ y@@ wood re@@ porter website : &quot; i think the times are changing . &quot;
we must accept that and not try to follow the past .
unlike the weak cash out@@ comes of the ho@@ ll@@ y@@ wood produc@@ tions , net@@ f@@ li@@ x has recently achieved a tur@@ nover of € 5@@ 9.@@ 4 billion with stre@@ aming content .
last summer , the director ste@@ ven spi@@ el@@ berg cri@@ tici@@ zed the film studios for being too focused on film production in com@@ ics .
in the light of the current down@@ turn , some comm@@ ent@@ ators argue that his gri@@ m pro@@ ph@@ ec@@ y is a true core .
the expected increase in the potential cash savings in the summer of 20@@ 15 , including aven@@ gers : age of ul@@ tr@@ on , mini@@ ons and jur@@ as@@ sic world , has made other representatives of the film industry more optim@@ istic :
the producer of x-@@ men , sim@@ on kin@@ berg , described the decline in cash out@@ comes recently as simply &quot; cy@@ clic@@ al &quot; and said to ho@@ ll@@ y@@ wood re@@ porter : &quot; the next summer will be the biggest summer of the year .
when the 2nd table tennis district tennis class was founded a few years ago to stre@@ am@@ line the division of the league , this is a step in the right direction .
now the german table tennis federation has an additional 3rd bun@@ des@@ lig@@ a .
the result : if you did not rise , you went off .
for example , g@@ ö@@ tt@@ ingen ’ s class highest team tor@@ pe@@ do has won the most prestigious title in the ob@@ er@@ lig@@ a release , but will play only five classi@@ cs in the coming season .
the fourth class is the women of tor@@ pe@@ do , despite their gran@@ di@@ ose mar@@ ching into the regional league .
the bo@@ ys and girls of tor@@ pe@@ do start in the lower sa@@ x@@ ony league , as well as the bo@@ ys of the s@@ c we@@ en@@ de .
s@@ g leng@@ lers and the tor@@ pe@@ do reserve are now in the new association league .
at the ladies , the tt@@ v ge@@ is@@ mar plays in the association league , the tor@@ pe@@ do second in the league of the country .
what looks like a better district class , is now the new district class .
this is where ts@@ v s@@ eu@@ ling@@ en , v@@ f@@ b l@@ ö@@ d@@ ing@@ sen , tor@@ pe@@ do iii , ge@@ is@@ mar , ein@@ bec@@ k , ham@@ en@@ ste@@ dt , bo@@ ven@@ der sv , lan@@ gen@@ hol@@ ten@@ sen , the f@@ c .
in the district sli@@ ga as regional representative , d@@ ran@@ s@@ fel@@ d and s@@ c we@@ en@@ de , play in the district class of tt@@ c ii , red and white , the bo@@ ven@@ der sv ii and the tt@@ v teams .
g@@ ün@@ ter@@ sen , the tt@@ c and the tt@@ v ge@@ is@@ mar ii are also included here .
in the district sli@@ ga run tor@@ pe@@ do iii and sat@@ ten@@ haus@@ en / w@@ ö@@ ll@@ mar@@ sha@@ us@@ en .
with nine teams each ,
the s@@ c we@@ en@@ de sen@@ ds his girls to the small district sli@@ ga .
the district sli@@ ga season of the sc@@ w bo@@ ys - there is another tor@@ pe@@ do ii to start - is not complete .
in a district class , ge@@ is@@ mar , tus@@ po we@@ en@@ de and bo@@ ven@@ der sv are going into the season .
in the first season of the newly established regional association , the two go@@ d@@ d@@ ess cir@@ cles start with each nine teams .
in the west season , the red and white ii , bo@@ ven@@ der sv iii , lau@@ bach ii , tor@@ pe@@ do iv and v , m@@ tv gr@@ one , dr@@ ans@@ fel@@ der s@@ c ii , mi@@ el@@ haus@@ en .
in the east season , among other things , sat@@ ten@@ haus@@ en / w@@ ö@@ ll@@ mar@@ sha@@ us@@ en , ni@@ ko@@ la@@ us@@ berg and land@@ ol@@ f@@ sha@@ us@@ en play .
the ladies kre@@ is@@ lig@@ a consists of s@@ att@@ en@@ haus@@ en / w@@ ö@@ ll@@ mar@@ sha@@ us@@ en ii , bil@@ sha@@ us@@ en , hem@@ el@@ n , s@@ eu@@ ling@@ en ii , tus@@ po we@@ en@@ de and s@@ g r@@ hu@@ me .
this is still better than in the o@@ ster@@ o@@ de district , where there is no women teams at all at k@@ re@@ is@@ -@@ level .
it is striking that none of the six 2nd circle classes is to be achieved , here the innovative and out@@ -@@ dated board of directors will have to think about .
nato summit : first pro@@ tests in new@@ port and car@@ di@@ ff
at the weekend there were pro@@ tests from oppon@@ ents of the nato summit in new@@ port .
on saturday , hundreds of people gathered in the centre of new@@ port to fight an anti-@@ nato march .
on sunday , about 150 people arrived in car@@ di@@ ff in front of the town hall to meet a so-called counter@@ -@@ summit .
ste@@ ph@@ en fair@@ cl@@ ough has described the developments at the weekend and talked to demonstr@@ ators from brid@@ ging to belgium .
te@@ en@@ ag@@ ers from the blue mountains have been flo@@ wn out of the blue mountains .
two young bus@@ h@@ hi@@ kers were shot in safety with the ro@@ pe win@@ ch after they had spent the night in the blue mountains in n@@ s@@ w .
the 16@@ -@@ year-@@ old girl and the 19@@ -@@ year-@@ old man bro@@ ke into go@@ ve@@ ts lea@@ p in black@@ he@@ ath shortly after sunday lun@@ ch@@ time .
wor@@ ried rela@@ tives called at about 8 p.m. the police when the two were not returning home .
a local police and re@@ treat@@ s team bro@@ ke up and the couple was killed by about 11 p.m. in the vicinity of the brid@@ al ve@@ il water@@ falls .
the girl had been hur@@ t at her k@@ ne@@ es and the man had fallen and had be@@ aten his head .
rescue forces remained in the hands of the couple over@@ night , and they were fle@@ eing out on monday morning .
they were built in a stable condition with a am@@ bul@@ ance in the blue mountains hospital .
anti-@@ government pro@@ tests in pakistan are es@@ cal@@ ating
the 1000 or so demonstr@@ ators were sta@@ tioned by soldiers from the p@@ tv building , said information minister per@@ v@@ ai@@ z r@@ as@@ hi@@ d .
the station was closed after more than half an hour .
p@@ tv director ath@@ ar far@@ o@@ o@@ o@@ q said that the po@@ les equipped with po@@ les had devices in the ed@@ it@@ orial .
dead or in@@ ju@@ red have not been reported .
the demonstr@@ ators are calling for the re@@ sign@@ ation of the prime minister , whom they acc@@ use of electoral fraud .
the police told us about one kil@@ ome@@ tre from the residence of prime minister na@@ wa@@ z shar@@ if , whether it was to cl@@ ash again on monday with around 3@@ 000 demonstr@@ ators with security forces .
according to hospital information , a polic@@ em@@ an was in@@ ju@@ red .
at least three people were killed at the weekend and more than 500 were in@@ ju@@ red when demonstr@@ ators tried to return to shar@@ if ’ s residence .
you are calling for the prime minister to resi@@ gn .
the powerful military had a military squ@@ ab@@ bling on sunday evening after a meeting in the army headquarters to find a political solution to the conflict , &quot; without wa@@ sting time and using force &quot; .
the communication also said : &apos; the army remains committed to its role in ensuring the security of the state &apos; .
the es@@ cal@@ ating violence has caused concern about military intervention , which is taking place in the past more often than not .
the political will , which was expressed by the opposition politici@@ an im@@ ran kh@@ an and the pre@@ ach@@ er ta@@ h@@ ir@@ u@@ l q@@ ad@@ ri , has been in force since the day of independence on 14 august .
shar@@ if re@@ jects re@@ sign@@ ation .
kh@@ an and q@@ ad@@ ri had ur@@ ged their sup@@ porters to stay on sunday .
&quot; we will not go back without calling shar@@ if to resi@@ gn , &quot; said kh@@ an .
q@@ ad@@ ri expressed a similar view .
kh@@ an acc@@ uses shar@@ if of holding the parliamentary election last may by fraud .
q@@ ad@@ ri calls for the re@@ sign@@ ation of central and provin@@ cial governments .
then a transitional government is to reform the electoral system and call for new elections .
more than 40 000 security forces are in operation to protect the government district .
the demonstr@@ ators had initially been peace@@ fully hi@@ jack@@ ed before parliament , until kh@@ an and q@@ ad@@ ri forced them to stop the bom@@ bing of shar@@ if ’ s residence at the weekend .
h@@ ü@@ t@@ tel@@ dor@@ fer after second win in the season on place three of the table .
the 2 : 0 over gr@@ ö@@ di@@ g has a bit@@ ter week on sunday for rapid has a reconciliation end .
&quot; the victory is very liber@@ ating , &quot; said tra@@ iner z@@ or@@ an b@@ ari@@ sic , whose team is in the lead with the team from the euro@@ pa league on thursday .
&quot; the success was un@@ den@@ i@@ ably important , &quot; said captain j@@ ack and go@@ al@@ ke@@ eper ste@@ ff@@ en ho@@ f@@ mann , who was working with green white on the third place .
sch@@ ram@@ me@@ l dre@@ am@@ tor brings rapid to the winner &apos;s road rapid has won the second season victory and the right reaction to the dis@@ appointment with hel@@ sin@@ ki and is starting with a success experience .
&quot; we wanted to show a positive response , &quot; said foreign def@@ en@@ der thomas sch@@ ram@@ me@@ l , who , with his magnificent leadership vol@@ ley of the six@@ teenth corner , set the course for victory in the 14@@ th minute .
&quot; i thought i had all the fru@@ stration of thursday and i was going to sm@@ ell it under the lat@@ te , &quot; said the 26 year-@@ old s@@ mil@@ ing .
when sch@@ ram@@ m@@ el was invited to the last session in a bun@@ des@@ lig@@ a for the 13@@ th nov@@ member 2010 , it was still for ried .
the first championship hit in the rapi@@ d-@@ d@@ ress will therefore be a special memory for him .
&quot; for me this is something very special , i am from the rapid new@@ com@@ ers , &quot; sch@@ ram@@ me@@ l said .
due to the short bas@@ in b@@ lasting of mari@@ o pav@@ el@@ ic sch@@ ram@@ me@@ l moved from the left to the right def@@ ensive side and made the right side of his business very good .
he has enough experience in that he is also able to use this position in a mis@@ guided manner .
he deserves the gate , he has already assi@@ sted some of the others this year , &quot; p@@ raised bar@@ i@@ sic .
the team shows character sch@@ ram@@ me@@ l also supplied the f@@ lan@@ k at 2 : 0 by ho@@ f@@ mann after just over an hour that finally brought the decision .
the fact is that the guests could have been cont@@ acted before that .
&quot; thank god we have been a little lu@@ cky today , &quot; sch@@ ram@@ me@@ l , who pointed out the g@@ aps in performance and result in recent weeks .
b@@ ari@@ sic even found that &quot; in many games before , you were better than today &quot; - against &quot; the strong@@ est team that has been in this season at this sta@@ dium &quot; .
the first tri@@ ple point since 26 july has therefore proved that the team structure has not been able to cope with the set@@ backs , &quot; today my team has shown that it is of character &quot; .
it is no less pleas@@ ing to him that we have finally played too zero again .
a lot of work during the country break also the fact that with bri@@ an beh@@ ren@@ dt , mari@@ o pav@@ el@@ ic , chri@@ stop@@ her di@@ bon , den@@ i al@@ ar and michael sch@@ imp@@ el@@ s@@ ber@@ ger have several out@@ breaks .
&quot; we must not forget this &quot; , bar@@ i@@ sic , who has been in charge of the european union for the last three days , war@@ ned that he was &quot; the last time very stable .
the country ’ s p@@ ause must therefore be used to “ lic@@ k w@@ ounds and to create a little more physical space ” , bar@@ it@@ one said , the five u@@ 2@@ 1-@@ aus@@ w@@ ass@@ er k@@ ni@@ fe players in his team .
one who is probably particularly interested in the break is captain ho@@ f@@ mann .
it te@@ ars up for the team , goes over pain .
it is precisely at this difficult stage that he has shown that he is a very important player for us , &quot; noted b@@ ari@@ sic .
ho@@ f@@ mann gave the game rapi@@ ds before it was replaced in the 6@@ 8@@ th minute not only the structure but also achieved the second goal .
for the 3@@ 3-@@ year-@@ old who has been playing his 3@@ 50@@ th bun@@ des@@ lig@@ a game , it was the first hit out of the game since november 2 , 2013 ( 4 : 2 on the ad@@ mir@@ a ) .
ho@@ f@@ mann : &apos; must not believe that everything is good now &apos; &apos; we certainly have also had a bit of lu@@ ck , but at some point happ@@ iness must come back to us too .
now it was high time , &quot; ho@@ f@@ mann said .
but he war@@ ned that more concentrated work would be needed : &quot; you cannot always do it in black and white .
we have not played so badly in recent weeks as has been pointed out .
nor must we believe that everything is good now .
the importance of his role for the team he could not deny .
it is a very young team , and i am very happy to help .
they are still in my pos@@ session at certain stages , &quot; ho@@ f@@ mann said .
gr@@ ö@@ di@@ g-@@ co@@ ach michael bau@@ r had little to critic@@ ise for himself and his team .
he regre@@ t@@ ted the quick hit &quot; from the magic gate &quot; category , as well as the regular gate of nu@@ tz in the 40@@ th minute , which was replaced by re@@ fe@@ ree colle@@ gi@@ ate wr@@ ong@@ ly .
the only acc@@ us@@ ation i can make to the team is that we are heading towards tor in some stages not being concrete enough .
we have not had enough conclu@@ ding conclusions on this .
internal def@@ en@@ der maxim@@ ili@@ an kar@@ ner saw it similarly : &quot; it just started badly , but then we have found a pure and even made a gate .
by and large , more would have been in it .
under this wh@@ ir@@ l@@ pool , there is a ru@@ g of ru@@ in .
a powerful tri@@ be was shown in our pu@@ zz@@ le task of the summer series &quot; my piece of rh@@ ö@@ ner lu@@ ck &quot; last friday .
several of these tree gi@@ ants still exist in the county , the illustra@@ ted copy is the &quot; s@@ cour@@ ge re@@ sting he@@ a@@ ke &quot; above the wel@@ ding foun@@ tain .
a bu@@ mp@@ y walk leads up to the 6@@ 00@@ -@@ year-@@ old o@@ ak .
it passes by cou@@ pl@@ ings , bas@@ alt pil@@ es and bas@@ alt stone seas .
a piece below the stone bridge from the bau@@ er@@ s@@ berg , one kil@@ ome@@ tre north of the road to we@@ is@@ bach , stands it .
vital looks at the natural mon@@ ument , it s@@ its over the other trees in the surrounding area and remin@@ ds with a size of more than eight meters an american m@@ am@@ mo@@ th tree .
a little bud@@ d@@ ha on a tree st@@ um@@ p suggests that it is a spiritual bud@@ dh@@ ist or my@@ s@@ tical place .
but , despite intensive research , there was only evidence of the name origin@@ s .
dr. wol@@ f@@ gan@@ g sch@@ nei@@ der has specifically consulted the bis@@ ch@@ of@@ sh@@ ei@@ m archive and has visited older people from the wel@@ ten@@ brun@@ n to find out what is the equivalent of the s@@ cour@@ ge he@@ al .
the results of his research were quite so@@ ber in expla@@ ining the name .
thus , up to about 80 years ago , go@@ at she@@ ph@@ er@@ ds were supposed to take their animals from under@@ we@@ is@@ sen@@ brun@@ n to the lab@@ ori@@ ously ro@@ lled and fre@@ ed me@@ ado@@ ws .
at the foot of the tree , the ru@@ ins of the as@@ cent should have been rested .
meanwhile , the sector has reg@@ a@@ ined its importance , as pa@@ st@@ ures are in fact again used for go@@ ats .
the area has also become the core zone of the bio@@ sphere reserve , has further highlighted sch@@ nei@@ der .
when entering the stone collections , however , you should be careful , because the sun &apos;s war@@ med up bas@@ al@@ t is also suitable for cross-@@ ot@@ ters .
a hiking trail leads from un@@ ter@@ wei@@ ß@@ brun@@ n to the tree , which is hidden a little .
other routes are sign@@ posted , the direction ho@@ rh@@ ö@@ n as@@ cen@@ ds and leads to an extensive hi@@ ke .
where is the water@@ castle ?
a water@@ castle that we will be looking for next to our task , however , is rather rare in height .
the reflection in the mo@@ at gives a good impression of the building , but we have some historical buildings in the district , including the kon@@ ter@@ fe@@ i building .

after weeks of tu@@ g-@@ of-@@ war , italy ’ s prime minister and eu president , mat@@ te@@ o ren@@ zi , has pro@@ tested against strong conservative opposition at the special eu summit last week to the nom@@ ination of his foreign minister , feder@@ ica mo@@ ham@@ ed .
ren@@ zi considers how the newspaper la rep@@ ul@@ b@@ lic@@ a re@@ produces the cal@@ am@@ ity of his work , also called the fav@@ ori@@ tes in government , which he also fav@@ ors in government , as a strengthening of the position of the social democrats and his own .
he also exp@@ ects to be a driving force for his &apos; reform package &apos; in italy .
last but not least , ren@@ zi hopes that the inv@@ asion of iraq , which is always co@@ ve@@ ted against him , can be cal@@ med down , because mo@@ gh@@ er@@ ini will be able to support it , albeit in a moderate way .
i would like to say to the conservative representatives , with president je@@ an-@@ cla@@ ude jun@@ ck@@ er and the po@@ le , who is the president of the council , that the prevail@@ ing opinion in rome is that a political balance should be struck .
because the eu &apos;s chief diplom@@ at will be the vice-president of the commission , mr jun@@ ck@@ er .
the pending approval of the european parliament is considered to be safe .
otherwise , president gi@@ or@@ gio na@@ polit@@ ano would have rejected the nom@@ ination of the 4@@ 1@@ th year-@@ old politici@@ an of the ruling democratic party ( p@@ d ) hardly any &quot; important recognition &quot; of italy &apos;s role in the eu .
la re@@ pub@@ b@@ lic@@ a is a widespread optim@@ ism that the political will to re@@ build the european union , which has been proven in leading party offices for almost two decades and has been well known for its ambition .
the roman@@ s are married to the family and have two dau@@ gh@@ ters .

pro-@@ hong kong activi@@ sts condemn china the day after the election .
a pe@@ king@@ -@@ loy@@ alty group ro@@ c@@ ked the chinese flag nearby .
the standing committee of the national people &apos;s congress passed a framework law on sunday , which only allowed two or three candidates for the hong kong leadership in 20@@ 17 .
all candidates must first have the majority support of a nom@@ ination committee that is expected to be formed with beijing loy@@ al members .
this decision makes it difficult for opposition democrats to vote .
political reforms have long been a controversial issue in hong kong ; party leaders have been concerned that the chinese will not be able to rely on other cities to make democracy .
after the publication of a beijing white paper in june , which called for china to domin@@ ate hong kong , the democratic institutions considered that the country was an un@@ official referendum on the electoral process .
l@@ is survey is conducted by the government in hong kong and the chinese li@@ a@@ ison office in hong kong .
the vice-@@ chair of the standing committee on legal affairs , z@@ han@@ g r@@ ong@@ sh@@ un , and the vice director of hong kong and mac@@ ao &apos;s council of state , f@@ en@@ g we@@ i , should be in charge of the day .
student activi@@ sts announced that they would be in front of the office of the leaders in hong kong in the afternoon .
britain saw a major economic crisis until the end of hong kong ’ s 15@@ 0-@@ year-@@ old colonial government .
putin is demanding ki@@ e@@ v to include &quot; state@@ hood talks &quot; with the eastern ukraine .
russian president v@@ la@@ di@@ mir putin demanded russian media reports that russia ’ s government should stop the government fighting for independence on sunday .
his spo@@ kes@@ man , di@@ mit@@ ri pes@@ ko@@ v , later made it clear that putin did not mean that it was under the control of the separ@@ ati@@ sts that the eastern ukraine was going to become part of russia , but that its status was being defined vis@@ -@@ à@@ -@@ vis the russian .
putin ’ s call to the ki@@ e@@ v government to negotiate equ@@ itably with the pro-@@ russian insur@@ g@@ ents , however , f@@ its in with the one he has been calling since the out@@ cr@@ y began five months ago : help for the people .
in an interview with the state television channel one , putin condemned the ukra@@ inian military campaign to re@@ con@@ qu@@ er the separ@@ ati@@ st interests .
the kre@@ m@@ lin and the separ@@ ati@@ sts have recently taken the area taken as &apos; nov@@ or@@ os@@ si@@ ja &apos; or &apos; new russia &apos; , a term that is remin@@ is@@ cent of the pre-@@ revolutionary gl@@ ory of the russian empire .
putin pointed out that all those who were killed during the ukra@@ inian campaign were in danger of losing their lives in the elections on 26 october , and while government groups were destro@@ ying civilian communities in the areas held by separ@@ ati@@ sts .
&quot; we must start detailed discussions immediately , not only on technical issues , but also on the political organisation of society and the state status of south-@@ east asia , in order to protect the interests of the people living there , &quot; he said .
pes@@ ko@@ v said that putin ’ s reference to state@@ hood in the context of greater autonomy must be seen , which has been supported for months by the ki@@ e@@ v leadership to avoid fears in russian society .
only the ukra@@ inian government can provide the eastern territories with the necessary autonomy , pes@@ ko@@ v said .
this is not a question of negotiations between ukraine and russia , pes@@ ko@@ v said , &apos; because it is not a conflict between russia and ukraine , but an internal conflict in ukraine &apos; .
clari@@ fication of the kre@@ m@@ lin spo@@ t@@ ter to correct the &quot; mis@@ interpretation &quot; of putin &apos;s remarks under@@ lined the leadership claim of russia in dealing with the separ@@ ati@@ st re@@ bel@@ lion in the east , in contrast to the direct opposition of the united states .
moscow would have far greater difficulty in getting the regions of don@@ et@@ sk and lu@@ han@@ sk to annex the eastern ukraine , as most of the 6.@@ 5 million inhabitants do not belong to rus@@ sians and surve@@ ys from the pre-@@ conflict period are a broad majority .
the autonomy that russian diplom@@ ats have mentioned in international for@@ a would give regional governments in ukraine the power to create their own trade agreements and external relations .
the anti-@@ terrorist movement , which was anne@@ xed five months ago in the black sea , is the port of the home for most of the russian na@@ vy , as well as an important commercial port and historic coastal region .
the regions between the ro@@ sto@@ v area in russia and cri@@ me@@ a are also rich in mines , fac@@ tories and foun@@ dri@@ es , which are important components for the russian military .
ukra@@ inian president pe@@ tr@@ o por@@ o@@ sh@@ en@@ ko proposed , when he spoke on 7 june , that ukra@@ inian authorities should be required to comply with ukra@@ inian legislation - after new elections - with constitutional amendments that would allow the territories to be controlled .
but his notion of autonomy seems to be in sharp contrast with that of the kre@@ m@@ lin and the separ@@ ati@@ st re@@ be@@ ls , whose arm@@ ament and inci@@ tement moscow has been accused of .
putin ’ s last call to ki@@ e@@ v to cooperate with the separ@@ ati@@ st leaders on an equal foot@@ ing followed another pre@@ occupation with the re@@ be@@ ls in the past week , after russian troops and tan@@ ks had been killed over the region .
the separ@@ ati@@ sts , supported by russia , took over in a hand@@ cu@@ ff that , according to ukra@@ inian security officials ’ fears , was the first step in a campaign to take over the strategic coastal region to cri@@ me@@ a .
this is why massive civilian and military preparations have been made to prevent mari@@ u@@ pol , a steel industry , from being able to compete with 500 000 people .
por@@ o@@ sh@@ en@@ ko spoke at a meeting of eu leaders in brussels on saturday and ur@@ ged action to prevent another russian aggres@@ sion against ukraine .
&quot; we are on the ver@@ ge of a point where there is no going back , &quot; por@@ o@@ sh@@ en@@ ko war@@ ned .
thousands of foreign troops and hundreds of foreign tan@@ ks are now on the territory of ukraine .
the eu summit did not decide on any specific actions , the leadership demanded a draft further sanctions against russia , which would be lif@@ ted if ukraine ’ s crisis es@@ cal@@ ated un@@ specified .
ukra@@ inian soldiers had to move away from their positions in il@@ o@@ wa@@ j@@ sk after two russian tan@@ k colon@@ ies and 1@@ ,000 soldiers were sent to the danube region last week .
the first probably 63 ukra@@ inian soldiers who were killed by the russian inv@@ asion of il@@ o@@ wa@@ j@@ sk were killed on sunday at 10 russian par@@ ach@@ uti@@ sts .
nu@@ de photo scand@@ al around austr@@ ali@@ an cele@@ bri@@ ties and gab@@ i g@@ rec@@ ko
ge@@ off@@ rey no@@ ble made no secret of his an@@ ger over h@@ ack@@ ers , who are probably nu@@ de images of his fi@@ anc@@ é gab@@ i g@@ rec@@ ko and a who is who of the a-@@ cele@@ bri@@ ties from ho@@ ll@@ y@@ wood .
the film city is in ex@@ ci@@ tement after a series of clear photos of a na@@ ked j@@ enni@@ fer law@@ rence in a h@@ acking scand@@ al around celebr@@ ity in the internet .
the h@@ ack@@ er responsible for this probably has 60 na@@ ked photos of law@@ rence , star from &quot; the tribute of pan@@ em &quot; and from super@@ stars , including the mo@@ del@@ s k@@ ate up@@ ton and car@@ a .
the austr@@ ali@@ an ac@@ tress te@@ res@@ a pal@@ mer , em@@ ily brow@@ ning , y@@ v@@ on@@ ne stra@@ ho@@ v@@ ski , and g@@ rec@@ ko of mel@@ bour@@ ne , alle@@ ge@@ dly also took private photos due to an ic@@ l@@ oud gap .
10@@ 1 cele@@ bri@@ ties are listed on the list .
no@@ bl@@ est who had been lost with g@@ rec@@ ko last month said to confidence .
all private letters and pictures should remain private .
it is a sh@@ ame that private information has been sto@@ len and passed on to others .
g@@ rec@@ ko , currently in new york , has reported that a news web site has said that the h@@ ack is &quot; sh@@ ame@@ ful &quot; and that the people affected felt &quot; in@@ ju@@ red &quot; .
the h@@ ack@@ er probably has 30 images of pal@@ mer with her ex@@ -@@ friend scot@@ t spe@@ ed@@ man , including two sho@@ ts where you can see them without being in a pool .
the pal@@ mers film works include &quot; love is un@@ be@@ at@@ able &quot; with li@@ am hem@@ s@@ worth .
pal@@ mer , ch@@ uc@@ k-@@ star stra@@ ho@@ v@@ ski and ac@@ tress brow@@ ning from suc@@ ker pun@@ ch were available yesterday for comments on the h@@ acked images .
a law@@ rence &apos; said to t@@ m@@ z : &apos; it is a des@@ pic@@ able violation of privacy &apos; .
actors se@@ th ro@@ gen condemned the h@@ ack@@ er in his t@@ we@@ et : &quot; h@@ acked images from a mobile to post is nothing other than the sale of h@@ ack@@ er goods . &quot;
from a purely legal point of view , the spread of sto@@ len images should not be toler@@ ated .
cy@@ cli@@ sts , jo@@ gg@@ ers and hi@@ kers were on the big fel@@ d@@ berg yesterday at the 8@@ th bi@@ ke@@ -@@ bike run and thus won the support of the association &quot; help for cancer children &quot; .
the tour , which was a tor@@ ture for some , was a light training for others .
but there was one thing that everyone agreed on : it was fun .
thomas stu@@ dan@@ ski will have sle@@ pt well last night .
for the first time in his life , the head of the ob@@ er@@ ur@@ sel@@ er bre@@ w@@ ery went to fel@@ d@@ berg by bike yesterday .
for the good purpose .
the small mus@@ cu@@ lar cat can easily be hidden away , especially since he was not allowed to participate in the 8@@ th bi@@ king on the great fel@@ d@@ berg in favour of the association &quot; help for cancer children &quot; ( frankfurt ) .
it is a great thing .
&quot; i now know that i can - fine ! &quot;
small pe@@ eing on the way in the applause cur@@ ve ?
ne@@ e , if i had stopped , then you &apos;d been out ...
as thomas stu@@ dan@@ ski , who was responsible for the c@@ du in the ob@@ er@@ ur@@ sel@@ er city parliament , many of the 7@@ 18 participants yesterday s@@ wal@@ low in the spring and came close to exhaus@@ tion , but happy to see it .
others , however , have been easier to cross the 11 km long route between ho@@ he@@ mark and fel@@ d@@ berg .
nor@@ man di@@ e@@ ß@@ ner , for example .
the red green light politici@@ an from the district day - red red d@@ ress , red bi@@ king - made a big mistake at the start .
he is also the route in a sli@@ de , as n@@ ina ku@@ hn , press spo@@ kes@@ person of ob@@ er@@ ur@@ sel , who , together with frank gr@@ ün@@ e@@ is@@ en , set off on the way .
for the two tri@@ athle@@ tes the &quot; fel@@ d@@ berg bi@@ kes &quot; was not necessarily a sporting challenge : &quot; this is about char@@ ity , we are happy to participate - a trip would have been possible today .
on the way , they had invited paul w@@ en@@ z@@ el from ob@@ er@@ re@@ i@@ f@@ en@@ berg .
the boy ( 12 ) was in the morning to ob@@ er@@ ur@@ sel to get back to the height of the hill .
the fl@@ ori@@ an zi@@ er@@ z frankfurt had set out to work in the sadd@@ le at 9 a.m. at home in the morning , &quot; made &quot; the fel@@ d@@ berg twice , and then roll home with fun .
the &quot; fr@@ it@@ ten@@ -@@ ton@@ i &quot; was also fun .
for the head of the ob@@ er@@ ur@@ sel@@ er k@@ ul@@ t@@ ki@@ os@@ k , cycling tours over the fel@@ d@@ berg are simply included .
he had a race track of 40 minutes with his 6.@@ 5 kil@@ o .
a cra@@ zy event .
for this purpose - i am happy to be there &quot; , said andre@@ as bal@@ z@@ ke .
the thir@@ sty main@@ zer says that he is a &quot; ambitious and ambitious racing cy@@ c@@ list &quot; .
it must be , because it was associated with the &apos; fix@@ ing wheel &apos; , but it is also a racing bike , but without circuit ...
the fact that it was loo@@ sely up without a wheel , not only proved the 20 hi@@ kers who wal@@ ked across the white wall and the fo@@ o@@ th@@ ills to the summit , but also a jo@@ gger who was standing on a cor@@ d .
mountain wat@@ ch@@ doctor professor vol@@ ker lis@@ ch@@ ke , who with his team , equipped with all@@ wheel bu@@ l@@ ly and qu@@ ad , for safety .
the 7@@ 18 participants - and thus many as never before - were in groups on the track in the morning .
hi@@ kers first at 9.@@ 30 a.m.
the first cy@@ cli@@ sts and run@@ ners followed at 10 am .
five minutes later , the first mountain bi@@ kers set off .
b@@ ent han@@ sen , chairman of the association &quot; bi@@ king on the great fel@@ d@@ berg &quot; , gave the start comm@@ ands and wanted the participants a nice trip .
next year , he hopes that he will succeed in getting up to fel@@ d@@ berg to ensure the safety of the participants .
