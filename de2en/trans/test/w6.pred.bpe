re@@ member@@ ing the very american ideal of labour rights as human rights as a human rights human rights , which is a very american ideal , human rights , as human rights , as a human rights human rights , as a human rights human rights ,
congress m@@ ps ke@@ ith el@@ lis@@ on and john le@@ w@@ is have tabled a legislative proposal to strengthen the organization of trade unions as civil rights .
&quot; just as unions die , so do the mid@@ d@@ le-@@ class jobs , &quot; el@@ lis@@ on said , a democr@@ at from min@@ n@@ es@@ ot@@ a and depu@@ ty chairman of the progressive labour party .
i am therefore proud to be able to express my support for the staff register together with the civil rights icon john le@@ w@@ is .
this gr@@ ound@@ breaking law gives workers the same legal opportunities to discrimin@@ ate against because of the organization of trade unions as in other forms of discrimination - and thus stops anti-@@ union forces .
the addition of the national labour law to provide an opportunity for discrimination against employed workers to organise a trade union representation is an important step in bringing an appeal to a civil court - and to prevent damages or criminal penalties .
but it is certainly not a radical initiative - at least not in accordance with american standards .
indeed , the best way to understand what el@@ lis@@ on , le@@ w@@ is , and other spon@@ sors of their legislative proposal are to link back to a very american idea .
despite the set@@ backs that unions have been subjec@@ ted to in recent years - in wis@@ con@@ s@@ in , mic@@ hi@@ gan and other countries throughout the country - americans once had a duty to encourage countries around the world to recognise labour rights , especially in china .
there was a time when millions of americans remember that when this country was democracy , freedom of speech , freedom of the press and the right to association , it was still in the same bre@@ ath .
when the united states occupied japan after world war ii , general dou@@ gl@@ as mac ar@@ th@@ ur and his staff encouraged the country to create a constitution that would ensure that the country would not be milit@@ ar@@ ised auto@@ cr@@ acy .
in full awareness of the need for workers and their unions to help create a new japan , they used a language that was explicitly called “ the world ’ s first ” .
when the united states occupied germany after world war ii , general d@@ wi@@ ght david e@@ is@@ en@@ ho@@ wer and his staff ur@@ ged the german@@ s to write a constitution that would ensure that fas@@ c@@ ism was ad@@ ol@@ f hit@@ ler ’ s democracy .
recogn@@ ising that workers would organize , the commission would not be able to speak out in the new nation , the german@@ s added a clause that explicitly states that the workers would be free to speak .
agreements that restrict or limit this right to make it more difficult to achieve are n@@ ul@@ l and vo@@ id ; to achieve these measures are illegal and un@@ law@@ ful .
when the former first lady ele@@ an@@ or roo@@ se@@ vel@@ t was in charge of the international human rights commission , the commission that signed the universal declaration of human rights , as it was signed by the united nations in 194@@ 8 as a global agreement .
for generations , americans have accepted the basic pre@@ mise that labour rights are human rights .
when this country told other countries how to protect civil and democratic societies , they said that they would not respect the right to establish a trade union - and that they would not be able to participate in collective negotiations as equ@@ als .
after these rights were under attack in america , it is indeed very wise to re-@@ establish the american ideal , which is that the working population should have the right to move .
as pa@@ st@@ or martin lu@@ ther king j@@ r. said 50 years ago ,
history is a great teacher .
now everyone knows that the workers &apos; movement does not limit the strength of the nation , but has increased it .
by raising the living standards of millions of people , work mir@@ ac@@ ul@@ ously created a market for industry , bringing the entire nation into un@@ imag@@ in@@ able levels of production .
those who attack the work forget this simple tru@@ ths , but history preser@@ ves them .
history rec@@ alls , and we should do so .
formal recognition of labour rights as human rights - and the extension of the protection of citizens &apos; rights as a protection against discrimination in the creation of employee representatives - is long over@@ due .
ke@@ ith el@@ lis@@ on and john le@@ w@@ is are renew@@ ing the ide@@ als that have made america great in the past and hon@@ oring the promise of democracy .
judge tempor@@ arily stops law that all abor@@ tion clin@@ ics in lou@@ i@@ si@@ ana are forced to close .
a us federal judge stopped the bi@@ d@@ ding for the time being in lou@@ i@@ si@@ ana on sunday , and lawyers said that it would probably lead to the closure of all five abor@@ tion clin@@ ics in the state .
this measure , which was proposed by bo@@ b@@ by j@@ in@@ dal , govern@@ or of lou@@ i@@ si@@ ana , in june , and which was adopted on 1 september , is likely to bring doctors who have abor@@ tions into force .
the judge &apos;s decision means , however , that doctors will continue to have legal abor@@ tions for the time being , while they are requ@@ est@@ ing such a right .
&quot; the pla@@ in@@ ti@@ ffs can continue to work in accordance with the law while they strive to obtain these rights , &quot; wrote federal judge john de@@ gra@@ vel@@ les in his judgment .
within a month , a hearing will be organised for the judge to establish a permanent legal decision .
pro-@@ abor@@ tion welcomed the decision to include the youn@@ g@@ est in a series of jud@@ gments against similar measures and said that doctors had more time to take care of hospital care .
&quot; today &apos;s decision means that women in lou@@ i@@ si@@ ana are subjec@@ ted to a de@@ vi@@ ous law that depri@@ ves them of their health and rights , &quot; said n@@ ancy nor@@ th@@ up , president and chairman of the centre for re@@ productive rights .
it was not immediately clear whether the judgment would affect doctors from the two clin@@ ics as well , who were in charge of the compla@@ int and were also in favour of the right of re@@ ferr@@ al .
lou@@ i@@ si@@ ana is one of 11 countries that have en@@ acted similar laws , with courts recently taking such measures in al@@ ab@@ ama and missi@@ ssi@@ pp@@ i for non-@@ constitutional purposes .
key points of a law in tex@@ as that covers most of the clin@@ ics remaining in the state to close were taken up by a federal judge on friday .
pro-@@ abor@@ tion and the american college of o@@ stre@@ tr@@ ici@@ ans and gy@@ nec@@ o@@ logi@@ sts , as well as the american medical association , are all in agreement with the view that the right of re@@ ferr@@ al by doctors is unnecessary restrictions .
anti-@@ abor@@ tion is opposed to the idea that the measures should be aimed at protecting women &apos;s health , although some people also consider the effects of closing clin@@ ics to be a positive thing .
only one doctor who has been abor@@ ted in lou@@ i@@ si@@ ana has patients &apos; rights to enter the hospital , divided the centre for re@@ productive rights with them .
if all other doctors in the state are forced to stop abor@@ ting , this doctor would not be able to take the operation for fear of his safety , the group said .
in its arguments against the judgment , representatives of lou@@ i@@ si@@ ana said that they did not want doctors to be prosecu@@ ted for abor@@ tion .
dela@@ yed diagno@@ ses and lack of access to the best treatment methods lead to higher death rates by e@@ gg@@ s cancer in rural areas .
angel@@ ina jo@@ lie and her brother james have a video hom@@ age to their mother online .
for women in rural australia , there is a greater risk of losing e@@ gg@@ s cancer .
researchers analy@@ zed the medical data of more than 1@@ 100 austr@@ ali@@ ans , who in 2005 had detec@@ ted ov@@ aries , and found that only 25 % of the patients were diagno@@ sed five years after diagno@@ sis .
the research director sus@@ an j@@ ord@@ an of the q@@ im@@ r ber@@ gh@@ of@@ er medical research institute said that for those who work in rural and remote regions of the state , the ster@@ b@@ alized system is the risk of death by 20 % .
small study : new drugs could be l@@ ung and o@@ vari@@ an cancer .
the researchers studied the medical care of women over seven years .
dr. j@@ ord@@ an said that the age of a woman in diagno@@ sis , the type of o@@ vari@@ an cancer , existing pre@@ dis@@ orders , and the social and economic status also affect the chan@@ ces of survival .
for older women and those whose cancer is not yet known at diagno@@ sis time , the number of patients in the age of 16 was the lowest .
for those who live in rural and remote regions of the state , the mort@@ ality rate was at around 10 % lower than in the case of those in urban areas .
although the study did not investigate why non-@@ urban women with higher prob@@ ability of ov@@ aries were not able to die , it susp@@ ects that j@@ ord@@ an would have been able to diagno@@ se the disease be@@ lated and lack of access to the best treatment centres .
&quot; this disease is best described by gy@@ na@@ ecological on@@ co@@ logi@@ sts , and these are usually found in larger cities , &quot; she said .
despite the improvement in tele@@ medical services to counter di@@ stances , the commission proposed that the situation be rever@@ sed as a possible re@@ me@@ dy .
dr. j@@ ord@@ an said that the study is a bad long-term study , ir@@ respective of geographical status , of women in o@@ vari@@ an cancer and under@@ lined the need for better treatment .
the rio t@@ into ride to con@@ qu@@ er c@@ anc@@ er financed study is now being published in the medical journal of australia .
in march 2013 , el@@ ish@@ a ne@@ a@@ ve , a young mother of 33 years from the gold coast , learned that she had an aggres@@ sive form of ov@@ ary cancer .
garden centers regret falling house owners , and the number of house@@ holds dec@@ lining in the garden dec@@ lines .
the decline , together with a sharp fall in the number of home@@ owners under the age of 35 , could result in garden centres losing tens of thousands of p@@ ounds a year if today &apos;s young consumers were to suffer from a study by h@@ ta , as reported in the financial core times .
the report states that ten@@ ants account for an average of 55 % of the amount spent on home purch@@ ases .
the increase in people living in highly ur@@ ban@@ ised areas without gardens , the popular procedure of re@@ vol@@ ving around the park for as@@ ph@@ alt and the sin@@ king of garden size are further factors that will affect the industry .
in the london area , where 6 years of the share of home@@ owners in the united kingdom rose from 61 to 43 % , the lowest number of household expenses for garden products is reported .
the h@@ ta and the royal hor@@ tic@@ ul@@ tural society point out that the housing is used for rent or for small gardens , not that people do not want to pul@@ l plants .
gu@@ y bar@@ ter , chief garden consult@@ ant for the r@@ rs said : &quot; contain@@ er gar@@ den@@ ers are very popular with ten@@ ants , for example , because they can feed their plants with them when moving . &quot;
the h@@ ta report identified the period between 1997 and 2005 as the &apos; golden age &apos; of hor@@ tic@@ ul@@ tural retail trade due to increasing home@@ owners &apos; numbers and economic prosperity from the late 1980 ’ s to the mid-@@ 199@@ 0s .
he predic@@ ted that the number of jobs in the market would increase this year , owing to better weather conditions .
the opposition politici@@ an im@@ ran kh@@ an and the cl@@ er@@ gy@@ man
in the capital islam@@ ab@@ ad , around 1000 demonstr@@ ators have broad@@ cast p@@ tv to the state television station .
information minister per@@ va@@ i@@ z r@@ as@@ hi@@ d said that soldiers had taken the prote@@ sters back out of p@@ tv buildings .
the station opened its operation for about 40 minutes , but is now sending again .
at the same time , around 3@@ 000 demonstr@@ ators attemp@@ ted to return to prime minister na@@ wa@@ z shar@@ if ’ s residence .
about a kil@@ ome@@ tre away , they supplied themselves with stic@@ ks and stones equipped cl@@ ash@@ es with security forces .
the police used te@@ ar gas .
the demonstr@@ ators called for sh@@ ari@@ f ’ s re@@ sign@@ ation , but he refused .
the country &apos;s army is meanwhile ur@@ ging a political solution to the conflict , &apos; without wa@@ sting time and using force &apos; .
after a meeting at the headquarters on sunday evening , the military announced that &quot; the army remains its role .
the military plays an important role in pakistan and has already been pus@@ hing more often .

turkey is occup@@ ying us diplom@@ at for sp@@ ying on the us diplom@@ at ’ s report .
the turkish foreign ministry has sent the most serving us diplom@@ at in the country to report on american and british es@@ pi@@ on@@ age in turkey .
vice-president b@@ ü@@ l@@ ent said that the us emb@@ ass@@ y and turkish officials read the report on monday .
the german magazine der spi@@ e@@ gel as well as the online magazine the inter@@ cep@@ t reported that the data collected by the former us analy@@ st of the national security agency , ed@@ ward snow@@ den , show that turkey is a major area of activity .
according to turkish news agencies , the turkish president re@@ bec@@ p ta@@ y@@ y@@ y@@ ip er@@ do@@ gan played the importance of the report down and said that all the major countries must each other sp@@ y out .
an earlier report that also included germany ’ s main intelligence service , an@@ kar@@ a , provided a significant an@@ ger for the re@@ actions of the turkish government .

chief of the police of mag@@ alu@@ f accused of corruption
the prosecu@@ tors put a stop to the office of the public prosecu@@ tor of mall@@ orca on friday to evidence of black@@ mail by the city &apos;s polic@@ em@@ en and employees .
the head of the police of cal@@ vi@@ à on the holiday island of mall@@ orca was arrested after corruption charges by business@@ men and bar@@ -@@ owners in the not@@ ori@@ ous b@@ ing@@ e-@@ drinking hot@@ spot mag@@ alu@@ f .
chief commissioner jo@@ s@@ é ant@@ oni@@ o na@@ var@@ ro was arrested following charges of corruption against him by several business@@ men from pun@@ ta b@@ all@@ ena , the road in which most bars and night clubs of mag@@ alu@@ f are located .
according to the online daily newspaper mall@@ orca di@@ ario , the prosecu@@ tors put a charge on the office of the prosecu@@ tor for combating corruption in mall@@ orca on friday .
two other local police officers were arrested by spanish guar@@ dia civil in connection with the corru@@ pt practices of the spanish government .
the national spanish daily ab@@ c reported that the an@@ gr@@ y night clubs in spain were looking for a way to cur@@ tail the ne@@ po@@ tism of the authorities .
&quot; it is no longer a question of money making , it is about survival , &quot; said one of the business@@ men to the court .
let our live@@ li@@ hood be taken out of the game .
we have nothing to lose .
mag@@ alu@@ f made a huge lea@@ p in the world this summer due to a vir@@ al you@@ tube video , which was home to an 18@@ -@@ year-@@ old british tourist who attended 24 men during a tour of the river fel@@ la@@ ti@@ o .
since then , the island authorities have tried to prevent the illegal behaviour of alcoho@@ lic holi@@ day@@ makers in mag@@ alu@@ f , by preventing the number of participants in the in@@ famous alcohol trade .
the play@@ house club , where the fel@@ la@@ ti@@ o incident took place , was closed for a year , while play@@ house and the k@@ nei@@ p@@ p school were closed .
mag@@ alu@@ f , the tourist resort that is popular with young british holi@@ day@@ makers , is also suitable for a number of accidents involving alcohol .
the first spring day with we@@ t and stor@@ my weather conditions affects flights from ade@@ la@@ ide airport .
spring has brought southern str@@ alia a winter surprise .
in the evening until 9 p.m. another 5@@ mm rain fell on the city , after 6.@@ 6@@ mm , which was already on sunday night .
the last ra@@ inf@@ all was the result of a series of short , stor@@ my sho@@ wers , including a cast that began just before 8 p.m. and was used for almost 4@@ mm ra@@ inf@@ all in about 10 minutes .
after the winter last week for an early do@@ se of spring had provided , the temperature of the region fell by about 20 degrees cel@@ si@@ us on monday .
the bad weather conditions probably led to the late lan@@ ding of a flight of vir@@ gin airlines from mel@@ bour@@ ne to ade@@ la@@ ide .
the aircraft would have lan@@ ded shortly after 7.@@ 30 p.m. , but was caught by a tor@@ rent - a su@@ dden change in wind speed or direction over a short distance - and had to go through .
wind@@ falls reached about 50 km / h at this time on the ground at ade@@ la@@ ide airport .
flight data showed that the aircraft was also in operation on a second lan@@ ding flight and eventually dro@@ pped by around 8.@@ 40 p.m.
the flight delay resulted in delays in some other flights , including a flight from em@@ i@@ rates from du@@ ba@@ i and a qu@@ an@@ tu@@ m flight from the sy@@ d@@ ney .
for ade@@ la@@ ide , a maximum temperature of 16 ° c is predic@@ ted on tuesday , with possible sc@@ ales .
mat@@ thi@@ es says : it is high time to connect to a large network .
given the gal@@ lo@@ ping technological adv@@ ances that have made our comfortable home in high-@@ tech , high-@@ tech swit@@ ch@@ gear , the new technology is likely to be con@@ sol@@ ing .
while i write this here , my view of the spir@@ al cable that connec@@ ts the list@@ en@@ er to the phone is striking , and i think : bo@@ ah , how re@@ tr@@ o is that ?
but there is one thought behind it : if the cable were not , in the shor@@ test possible time , all the list@@ en@@ ers would fly around in the house , and that would be even more re@@ tr@@ o .
in any case , the ec@@ cle@@ tr@@ onic ( dis@@ gu@@ ised ) is the one that applies to the e@@ kel@@ tr@@ onic ?
no , ty@@ po@@ s : electronic ) sector the rule that the world nov@@ el@@ ty of today is the electric sc@@ ra@@ p of tomorrow , bought - out@@ dated .
and anyone who still wants a tube tv in the living room today , for example , simply says that he is fundament@@ ally opposed to television .
why are these considerations ?
because we are not convinced by the pressure from i@@ fa on the radio tower this week , our absolute in@@ competence in matters of electronics .
the lay@@ man , who used to be blind as a washing machine and cd player , does not even understand today the purpose of devices that are equipped with in@@ comprehen@@ sible expert spre@@ ch in front of him : &quot; connect &quot; .
yes , can we ?
what should we talk about with people who apparently volun@@ tar@@ ily spread such quar@@ k ?
in fact , for some 20 years now , the main issue has been that we like to link our house .
in order for the yo@@ gh@@ ur@@ t to re@@ new itself so that the fire alarm can come to our attention during the holiday in the mal@@ di@@ ves , it is reported that it is burning in the working room .
and would it not be wonderful if we were to have the air conditioning on our arrival ... ?
yes , but that requires air conditioning .
but a dream will certainly come true soon : we lift our arm@@ band watch , say ye &quot; sau@@ gen ! &quot; - and to the home the d@@ ust is running from the d@@ ust extrac@@ tor .
wrong .
everything is in no way anything other than a revolution : &apos; the borders between white and brown goods are bl@@ ur@@ red &apos; , ra@@ un@@ t has a sector expert , you can use the washing machine with a head@@ phone , the steam engine is connected .
we also know from everyday practice that if a new device really is needed urgently , it is guaranteed that the battery will be empty .
what is another reason why the spir@@ al cable on the phone is also the next radio exhibitions .
israeli children are returning to gaza after the war .
thousands of israeli children from the areas near gaza are being persecu@@ ted , and they returned to the schools on monday after they had left the summer in air@@ space .
the start of the school brought the peace process fu@@ el@@ ed by ro@@ cket ho@@ les in southern israel .
in the southern town of ash@@ do@@ d , employees of the &quot; pas@@ ho@@ sh &quot; kin@@ der@@ gar@@ ten , which was hit by a ro@@ cket , were de@@ ported before the pu@@ pil@@ s arrived from the walls and sho@@ wered .
&quot; we are a little afraid , but are ex@@ ci@@ ted , &quot; said ron@@ it b@@ art , resid@@ ent in ki@@ b@@ but@@ z sa@@ ad and there english teacher .
many children from our area urgently need a return to rout@@ ine .
her 1@@ 1-@@ year-@@ old daughter sh@@ ani b@@ art said that it feels &quot; a bit of a com@@ ic &quot; , suddenly re@@ appe@@ aring in school .
&quot; these were difficult times , and we were not out of the house at all , &quot; she said .
president re@@ u@@ ven ri@@ v@@ lin visited the ki@@ b@@ but@@ z near the border with gaza to offer his support .
until a ce@@ as@@ e@@ fire inter@@ rup@@ ted last week , thousands of border communities such as sa@@ ad remained in their homes or left their homes to live in sa@@ ad in sa@@ fer areas further away from gaza and to escape the missi@@ le .
many na@@ h@@ al o@@ z residents , a municip@@ ality near the gaza border , are still living in a four-@@ year-@@ old boy , tor@@ n by a palestinian mur@@ der@@ ous sh@@ ell@@ s .
the ministry of education announced that it had received about a do@@ zen families .
their children were tempor@@ arily accommo@@ dated in other schools .
prime minister bin@@ y@@ am@@ in net@@ any@@ ah@@ u visited a school in s@@ der@@ ot , a border town with gaza that was badly affected by palestinian sho@@ oting .
he called on the children to learn a lot and said &apos; we will make sure that their knowledge is acquired and offer you security &apos; .
israel and hamas agreed last tuesday on a vo@@ la@@ tile peace process .
the ce@@ as@@ e@@ fire provided an immediate end to the fighting , but important issues remain un@@ resolved , as hamas ’ s demand for the isra@@ eli@@ -@@ egyp@@ tian bloc@@ k@@ ade of gaza and the re@@ opening of the air and sea e@@ h@@ s .
israel is calling for hamas to be dis@@ armed and for the bodies of two to be handed over to the fighting israeli soldiers .
a new round of indirect talks is expected to be held in egypt this month .
in the war , more than 2,@@ 100 palestinians were killed , three quarters of them civili@@ ans , and at least 4@@ 94 children were killed according to estimates by the palestinians and the un .
israel is den@@ ying these claims and estimates that at least half of the deaths are deaths from milit@@ ants who were killed , but did not provide any concrete evidence of this information .
on the israeli side , 66 soldiers and six civili@@ ans , including a th@@ ai work@@ er , were killed .
hamas and other figh@@ ters in gaza fi@@ red 4@@ ,@@ 5@@ 91 missi@@ les and k@@ ill@@ ers during the fighting in gaza .
meanwhile , the israeli military conducted more than 5@@ ,000 air and other attacks .
israel ’ s attacks damaged or destroyed thousands of houses in gaza , and about 2@@ 50@@ ,000 people sought refu@@ ge in more than 100 un schools , which were in temporary de@@ tention areas .
while tens of thousands of people continue to live in the shel@@ ters and continue fighting , education authorities have postpon@@ ed the start of the school year last week .
&quot; i hope the school is soon open again , so we can continue learning , just as the children in the world and the jewish children , &quot; said mo@@ ham@@ ma@@ d am@@ ara , a 13@@ -@@ year-@@ old boy who is currently in prison .
at its choice in sa@@ x@@ ony : c@@ du@@ -@@ vi@@ ze stro@@ b@@ l provides n@@ p@@ d prohibi@@ tion procedures in question .
in view of the n@@ p@@ d ’ s losses in sa@@ x@@ ony , c@@ du federal vi@@ ze thomas stro@@ b@@ l has argu@@ ed for an end to the ongoing n@@ p@@ d prohibi@@ tion procedure before the federal constitutional court .
berlin – according to c@@ du@@ -@@ bun@@ des@@ vi@@ ze thomas stro@@ b@@ l , the ongoing prohibi@@ tion proceedings against the n@@ p@@ d should end before the federal constitutional court .
&quot; the n@@ p@@ d per@@ forms worse than last time , &quot; said stro@@ b@@ l , who also has c@@ du lan@@ ding chief in bad@@ en-@@ w@@ ür@@ t@@ tem@@ berg , who is the &quot; le@@ ip@@ zi@@ ger vol@@ k@@ s@@ ze@@ it@@ ung &quot; .
this is a welcome development in the right direction and a development that leads me to believe rather than to believe that the n@@ p@@ d should be comb@@ ated politically and not before the constitutional court .
the n@@ p@@ d was quite close to the fifth round of voting on sunday .
a first attempt to ban the extreme right was made in 2003 , when the treaty of lisbon was also en@@ shr@@ ined in the n@@ p@@ d &apos;s top .
in december 2013 , the federal council , after long preparation , submitted a new application in kar@@ ls@@ ru@@ he .
the federal government and the bun@@ de@@ sta@@ g did not join .
har@@ burg : t@@ ents for new refugees
refugees are now being placed in t@@ ents in new countries .
the first reception for refugees in har@@ burg bur@@ sts out of all se@@ ams .
now the interior authority has three red cross t@@ ents next to it .
district politicians were only informed a short time before – they were not very enthusi@@ astic .
&quot; these sli@@ p@@ per@@ y actions continue to fuel popular reservations and give district politicians no opportunity to play a constructive role in the human@@ e provision of refugees .
your party demands that the district administration of har@@ burg be un@@ used houses at present to provide accommodation .
96 refugees can be accommo@@ dated in the three t@@ ents .
reasons for over@@ crow@@ ding in the first shot are the rus@@ h of aid see@@ kers - and the fact that the people in the authorities do not have sufficient places in follow-up facilities .
many refugees therefore remain longer than the regular three months .
house prices have reached the highest winter rate in seven years , showing a widely observed trend in the world .
r@@ p data co@@ re@@ logic he@@ don@@ ic home value index for own homes , homes , and other properties in australia &apos;s capital increased by 1.@@ 1 % in august , according to the r@@ p data of monday .
this increase has reduced the overall increase in june , july and august to 4.@@ 2 % , the largest increase in the winter months since 2007 .
the annual price rise was 10.@@ 9 % , more than twice the annual price increase of the us $ 1.@@ 9 billion .
the research leader of r@@ p data , ti@@ m law@@ less , said that sy@@ d@@ ney and mel@@ bour@@ ne had a two-@@ ti@@ er market .
r@@ p data figures show that the house prices in sy@@ d@@ ney are down by a 16@@ .@@ 1 % last year , with mel@@ bour@@ ne in the region at 11.@@ 7 % .
the following markets are ade@@ la@@ ide , br@@ is@@ ban@@ e and dar@@ win , where prices are on average five and six percent higher .
at the other end of the scale is can@@ ber@@ ra , which is affected by cuts in government spending and where prices have ris@@ en by only 1.@@ 4 % over the year .
mr law@@ less also said that the spring beginning is now the beginning of a rise in the number of jobs for sale .
&quot; if you look at the continuing high rate of au@@ ction prices , a generally rapid sales rate and the continuing high prices of the au@@ ction market , you can probably see that the real estate prices are in the next three months .
in an opinion to the new press , he contradic@@ ts statements by the managing director pe@@ er med@@ au and att@@ aches an &apos; like a field master &apos; to the press .
the style of the university is not this , it says in the communication .
the med@@ au family was in munich as early as mid-@@ june to discuss the request of the university .
the statement that the plans were only announced in july is definitely wrong , &quot; po@@ et@@ z@@ l said .
at the same time , he points out that the plans are not &apos; pre@@ determined &apos; or even decisions &apos; , but &apos; pre@@ feren@@ tial &apos; .
the parking lot needed for access to the narrow road up to the castle is also less dramatic than the med@@ a fears .
from a nine metr@@ e road was not and is not mentioned .
at present , the figure is 5.@@ 50 metres , which is a metr@@ e wider than it is now , &quot; explains p@@ ö@@ tz@@ l .
the argument put forward by the me@@ d@@ at operators that their free and scho@@ ol@@ -@@ operated parking areas will only be used in future by students of the university is not to be allowed to apply .
the hotel is not in the centre of the city , but in the center of the city .
people living near the river
the ber@@ g@@ w@@ ich@@ tel children &apos;s cri@@ b , located on the site and on its do@@ or@@ step the access to the parking dec@@ k is to be opened according to the president of the university .
it gives us to remember , &quot; that this is not just about the cr@@ è@@ che , but also about the residents of the mouth of the fried@@ rich stre@@ ib@@ -@@ stra@@ ß@@ e and the 800 students of the neighbouring real@@ sch@@ u@@ le .
so it is much more than a question of the individual interests of mr med@@ au , &quot; says p@@ ö@@ tz@@ l .
whether the parents &apos; committee &apos;s criticism of the cr@@ è@@ che , the extension of the road , would be equivalent to &quot; the few natural spots of co@@ bur@@ gs lost &quot; , can the reader say himself .
in early october , p@@ ö@@ tz@@ l , together with the state building office of b@@ am@@ berg , intends to publish the counc@@ ils on the building development of the university until 2020 &quot; and in this context to address the importance of the new development &quot; .
pe@@ er med@@ au had the parents of the cr@@ è@@ che last week to talk about the plans of the university .
therefore , the access for the new parking dec@@ k should not be via the camp@@ us and the fried@@ rich@@ -@@ stre@@ ib@@ -@@ stra@@ ß@@ e as before , but via the me@@ d@@ al-@@ mountain .
this would mean that the narrow road would have to be extended in two lan@@ es , which is about a kil@@ ome@@ tre long .
according to the med@@ a estimates , transport in the park of ho@@ hen@@ f@@ els would increase ten@@ fold .
of about 2000 vehicles every day , we are talking about them .
the city has not yet decided to express its opinion on the project .
g@@ land@@ or@@ f is a hand@@ ball national team that is back .
hol@@ ger g@@ land@@ or@@ f will no longer be playing for the dh@@ b team .
the 3@@ 1-@@ year-@@ old german football team , head@@ ed by the bun@@ des@@ lig@@ ist s@@ g fl@@ ens@@ bur@@ g-@@ han@@ de@@ wit@@ t , was particularly concerned about health problems .
i did not like the decision easy , it has gone on for several months .
it is time for me to listen to the signals of my body and to begin my career in the national team , &quot; said the world champi@@ on of 2007 at his fac@@ e@@ book page .
it therefore goes hand in hand with a balance sheet of 16@@ 7 country games and 5@@ 76 goals for germany in international reti@@ rement .
because the thro@@ w-@@ ro@@ lled spac@@ er for the champi@@ ons league winner is from fl@@ ens@@ burg yet another few years on to@@ re@@ hun@@ t .
the ic@@ el@@ an@@ dic , who was elected for the national games against switzerland on tuesday , is the first time that g@@ land@@ or@@ f has had a &quot; long and good con@@ vers@@ ation .
his ideas and approaches have inspired me as much as they have been to my many years of fellow players and success@@ ors .
but for my club i would like to be healthy in the next few years , for which longer reg@@ ener@@ ation periods are necessary , which will reduce the current double burden .
the left hand@@ ler had a long way to go in 2012 after a he@@ el inf@@ ection .
because of ach@@ ill@@ es h@@ ash problems , he had been caught by team doctors from the german hand@@ ball league ( dh@@ b ) with a cor@@ tis@@ one injec@@ tion that later had a strong infl@@ am@@ mation .
an emergency operation and two other operations followed .
then g@@ land@@ or@@ f had fil@@ ed a compla@@ int against the team doctor , the dispute ended with a comparison .
twelve years of professional and ele@@ ven years of national team career do not go un@@ noticed by any body .
i have some health care sites that i can no longer ignore .
after the three inf@@ ec@@ tion-@@ related foot operations that started in 2012 in a short space of time , i have never really put my blood pressure under control .
there are also a number of other we@@ ar@@ -@@ related complaints .
as early as the beginning of the year , i noticed that i am taxes my head , but i cannot dec@@ ei@@ ve my body , &quot; explained g@@ land@@ or@@ f in the interview to the magazine &quot; hand@@ ball time &quot; .
for a com@@ e@@ back , he would only be available in absolute emergency .
&quot; when all the k@@ n@@ its te@@ ar , i am always ready to talk , &quot; said the double family father to the magazine .
however , i cannot understand the years in which i can still play hand@@ ball in one hand .
i must also say that after my long stay in hospital in 2012 , i also became quite hum@@ ble about my health .
after my career i would like to be able to go at least a little .
in addition to the 2007 world cup title and the winning of the champi@@ ons league 20@@ 14 , he won the 2008 ( h@@ s@@ g n@@ ord@@ hor@@ n ) and 2010 ( t@@ b@@ v le@@ m@@ go ) the e@@ h@@ f cup .
in 2012 , he also secured the european cup in the cup in fl@@ ens@@ burg .
german economy in the spring fell by 0.@@ 2 % .
the crises around the world have hit the german economy in the second quarter .
gross domestic product dec@@ lined from april to the end of june 20@@ 14 compared to the prior quarter by 0.@@ 2 % .
this was reported by the federal statistical office and confirmed that the data was provi@@ sional .
consumption alone en@@ li@@ ven@@ ed the economy in the spring , while investment dec@@ lined .
foreign trade , too , is slow@@ ing economic activity .
thanks to the strong start of the year , a total of eur 1 billion is expected for the first half of the year compared to the second half of 2013 .
hor@@ st@@ mar was the starting point and goal of the &quot; m@@ ün@@ ster@@ land@@ -@@ mo@@ o@@ i@@ ste &quot; , which was first introduced on sunday through the bur@@ g@@ man@@ n@@ s@@ stadt .
the bur@@ g@@ man@@ n@@ stadt hor@@ st@@ mar experienced an inv@@ asion of dutch &quot; fi@@ et@@ z@@ en@@ ri@@ e@@ ren &quot; on sunday .
the largest cycling association in the netherlands , n@@ t@@ f@@ u , held the so-called &quot; m@@ ün@@ ster@@ lan@@ de mo@@ o@@ i@@ ste &quot; .
it is the biggest bicycle tour across the country .
over 1000 participants than@@ ked me with their registration at jo@@ s ter hu@@ er@@ ne for organis@@ ing this tour through the m@@ ün@@ ster@@ land .
posted in various trade magaz@@ ines this tour was offered to interested visitors .
we come from the her@@ oes and went over@@ night to take part in this tour .
we would also like to take a closer look at the m@@ ün@@ ster@@ land in this way , &quot; said cy@@ cli@@ sts who were delighted by the route through the ste@@ in@@ furt , bor@@ ken and co@@ es@@ fel@@ d districts .
after registration at the sch@@ ü@@ tz@@ en@@ bru@@ der@@ schaft sta .
k@@ ath@@ ar@@ ina was on a small &quot; peace trip &quot; through the city over the wall , where the start was also made .
the route that was designed for three different categories also led to her@@ ren@@ hol@@ z over the sch@@ ö@@ pp@@ inger mountain in the direction of co@@ es@@ fel@@ d and about ha@@ vi@@ x@@ bec@@ k and b@@ ill@@ er@@ bec@@ k back to hor@@ st@@ mar .
on 95 kilometres with 1@@ 17@@ 5 metres of al@@ titude , 120 kilometres with 14@@ 75 metres of al@@ titude and 14@@ 5 kilometres of 17@@ 75 metres of al@@ titude , cy@@ cli@@ sts proved their good condition .
they were fed on the way in ha@@ vi@@ x@@ bec@@ k and bil@@ ler@@ bec@@ k .
the main organiz@@ er jo@@ s ter hu@@ er@@ ne and may@@ or he@@ in@@ z l@@ ö@@ l@@ fing was pleased to announce the success of this cycling event .
we are satisfied and it was a nice experience for all concerned .
the organization was without problems and there were no negative inci@@ dents , &quot; notes he@@ in@@ z l@@ ö@@ l@@ fing to a positive conclusion of this event .
unfortunately , not as many participants as the organiz@@ er had hoped , which probably happened to the bad weather forec@@ ast .
&quot; in 20@@ 15 , we will be back in hopefully nice weather on august 30 or during another weekend , &quot; the cy@@ cli@@ sts promised to return to m@@ ün@@ ster@@ land and the organis@@ ers are planning a new edition .
kon@@ stan@@ tin w@@ ec@@ ker &apos;s ru@@ th@@ less honest mem@@ o@@ irs
it is actually more philosoph@@ ical than bio@@ graphy , which is con@@ stan@@ t@@ ine alarm , song maker , pacific artist , and po@@ et .
not chron@@ o@@ log@@ ically , but more thought s@@ parks for thought sc@@ ra@@ ps , the new world war ii , born on june 1 , 194@@ 7 , has lost its mem@@ o@@ irs , each chapter is opened by a suitable song text .
and he is fa@@ i@@ th@@ fully honest : from on@@ ani@@ e as a gy@@ m@@ na@@ si@@ ast to sho@@ p@@ lif@@ ting and drug use , he leaves no human weak@@ ness out .
also , to show how he himself can show tolerance in dealing with his fellow human beings .
ab@@ str@@ act but also more important concepts are taking up a broad scope : love , soul , e@@ go , that being in now , spirit@@ u@@ ality - all of which he tries to get to the bottom , in very philosoph@@ ical , but also .
and he also explains his paci@@ f@@ ism , his social critique , his political commitment - and also how he sees not only music ( which is opera lovers ) , but also his social and cultural life .
the latter has consistently supported the li@@ be@@ man kon@@ stan@@ tin alarm also the as@@ ce@@ tic mon@@ k , who &quot; by sub@@ tr@@ action &quot; ar@@ ises , as he says , &quot; by making everything unnecessary . &quot;
there is a clear distinction between all the highly spiritual views , but there are also short an@@ ec@@ do@@ tes to the earth : about sle@@ eping in a local or a wat@@ ch@@ ful world , for example , in a g@@ is frequ@@ ented car .
he is ru@@ th@@ less in his approach .
len@@ ny hen@@ ry : my father never got me into the arms .
never said &quot; i love you &quot; , i love you !
hen@@ ry was one of seven children of a jam@@ a@@ ic@@ an family in du@@ d@@ ley in the mid@@ lands in 195@@ 8 .
his father , who died when hen@@ ry was 19 , worked in a factory and their relationship was limited .
hen@@ ry is trying for a com@@ edy , ru@@ dy &apos;s rare records , and the most recent com@@ edy series .
the sound@@ track is a mix@@ ture of reg@@ ga@@ e and ra@@ p , with lively me@@ lo@@ dies .
but hen@@ ry had to be replaced by some difficult child@@ hood moments .
he visited &quot; many &quot; therap@@ ies after the death of his mother , and hen@@ ry is thinking about his relationship with his father .
it was difficult to know him .
you never saw his face , heard only his voice : &quot; listen with the cr@@ ash .
let your si@@ ster rest .
get down to it !
i want to look at cr@@ ick@@ et .
my older bro@@ thers se@@ y@@ m@@ our and hil@@ ton - who had grown up when i was a child - went with him to the pu@@ b and talked about things like form of beer .
i have never had such a con@@ vers@@ ation with him .
he spent much of my life in this serious type in the corner that the newspaper read .
recently , hen@@ ry opened a foun@@ dry in du@@ d@@ ley , and although the conditions are better than they were at the time of his father , he gained an insight into how life was for him .
it is now a little bri@@ ghter , but they are dark , smo@@ ked , deep stylish lab@@ y@@ r@@ in@@ ths with fl@@ ame bu@@ sts and smo@@ ke and much so@@ ot .
my father used to sit in the bath and then he could be heard slowly as he sing .
when i was around , i realized that he was going to do so for years in order to prepare the food .
however , hen@@ ry grew up as a child without his parents ’ love testi@@ mony .
my father never hu@@ gged me , he never said &quot; i love you &quot; .
only when my mother was ill towards the end of her life did we begin to &quot; i love you , i love you , i love you &quot; to say .
with his own daughter , bil@@ ly , with da@@ wn fren@@ ch , he could share the love he had lost as a child .
could you possibly be with the &quot; i love you &quot; stop ?
stop asking me to hu@@ g me !
pap@@ a , i am 22 !
with da@@ wn french .
why should we not be friends ?
she is a great mother .
it is still covered with french friends , with the one he spent 25 years in paris .
da@@ wn is a good man .
why should we not be friends ?
she is a great mother .
hen@@ ry &apos;s own mother was di@@ abe@@ tic .
this contributed to their death .
so when i was very , very over@@ weight and symp@@ t@@ oms of di@@ abe@@ tes showed , my doctor said &apos; you must be radical .
so i went through this fitness and had to wear a dr@@ astic di@@ et to get rid of the symp@@ t@@ oms .
it is very difficult .
and it is a ti@@ ring task .
nobody li@@ kes to eat car@@ ro@@ ts .
hen@@ ry &apos;s career changes may be reflected in his elegant , short cut be@@ ard .
since he was cri@@ tici@@ zed by the cri@@ tics for his o@@ th@@ ell@@ o , he has been cap@@ tured by the theatre .
the com@@ edy of the ir@@ r@@ itation followed , and then f@@ ences of august wil@@ son .
this is a different experience than the sit@@ com@@ s and com@@ edy that has made his busy working life complete .
he began with only 16 years when he worked in a factory .
a d@@ j discovered him on stage when he im@@ it@@ ated people and wrote to new faces about him .
his television career began in the mid-@@ 197@@ 0s . &quot; i was for a fairly long time the only black im@@ it@@ ator / com@@ edi@@ an on television . &quot;
he learned at work .
i had to be very clear not only from the public &apos;s eyes , but also from 197@@ 5 to 198@@ 5 how to create an efficient jo@@ ke nar@@ ra@@ tive machine , while i was watching television as a star , and that was really difficult .
len@@ ny was born in 197@@ 5 in new faces , new faces , new faces , new faces , new york , in 197@@ 5 .
since his manager is the stage law at black and white min@@ stre@@ l show , he was a light man , and he was a great fan of the show .
the hotel is very close to the airport and the airport .
i would like to see it never happened , but i regret not that the commission has done so .
it was a strange , un@@ pleasant position for me , but i worked on giant projects and learned how to make a living with a large audience .
but this &quot; pri@@ z@@ e-@@ winning , light@@ weight pillar of british television &quot; was also a &quot; gro@@ te@@ s@@ que par@@ o@@ dy of black people . &quot;
the introduction of figures that the british black culture has both mo@@ c@@ ked and celebrated has made hen@@ ry work in the eigh@@ ties .
the first series of len@@ ny hen@@ ry show was broad@@ cast in 198@@ 4 and in the 199@@ 0s he was among others known as the ch@@ ef gare@@ th black@@ lock .
advertising , docum@@ entary films , tv series and film roll@@ s were the h@@ all@@ marks of his next decade , but after his bb@@ c series len@@ ny@@ hen@@ ry@@ .@@ tv 2008 he thought : &quot; what do you do next , what do you do ?
after that came a docum@@ entary series for radio 4 entitled what &apos;s so great about ... ?
the first episode was about sha@@ kes@@ pe@@ are .
on sha@@ kes@@ pe@@ are , i was really aller@@ gic .
i never really had anything learned about him in school and thought he was mostly a domain of middle class , but white in st@@ um@@ p ho@@ ses and a com@@ b head .
so i was very afraid of it .
all of us inter@@ viewed for the show , peter hall , tre@@ v@@ or n@@ un@@ n , adri@@ an les@@ ter , ju@@ di den@@ ch said &quot; you should try it .
do not make it bad if you don &apos;t know what you are talking about .
take some of the words in your mouth , and then you will understand why we all sha@@ kes@@ pe@@ are so love .
hen@@ ry ran 20 lines from o@@ th@@ le@@ los last speech for the docum@@ entary film and he was enthusi@@ astic .
i had the feeling that i could do that .
it was almost as if someone had finally put my head right .
&quot; that &apos;s what it is about , it &apos;s a serious thing , take it seriously , learn your text , search a bit .
the sam@@ ples were brut@@ al , and i read this piece of work for months before we did it .
and it was a success .
they seemed to expect an accident , and that simply did not happen .
and soon he joined the com@@ edy of the ir@@ r@@ itation .
suddenly i was in the national theatre and i could not believe it .
there was a moment when i thought &quot; o@@ h , you &apos;ve changed you &quot; .
there was a technical error and hen@@ ry felt inst@@ inc@@ tively that he had to enter@@ tain the audience .
&quot; a small voice told me &quot; you must now bridge 10 minutes while you are repa@@ iring the computer &quot; .
instead , the stage manager announced that the idea of moving forward as soon as the problem has been solved .
i went from stage and something in me said &quot; o@@ h , god be , &quot; .
i am not responsible for this .
i can leave it to someone else .
&quot; you play in a play , so stay in your role . &quot;
hen@@ ry in f@@ ences at the du@@ ch@@ ess theatre
to learn the text for f@@ ences was challenging .
pan@@ ic is very good , it strength@@ ens the sin@@ s .
that too was good , so it is like a big shi@@ eld of the go@@ ds , who tell me &quot; that is your dest@@ iny &quot; .
he says so , of course , with a th@@ under@@ ing voice .
so i stand by that .
i really love that .
i love to be in a sample room .
but hen@@ ry still has the head of a com@@ edi@@ an - our con@@ vers@@ ation is full of hum@@ or@@ ous out@@ bur@@ sts , while he im@@ it@@ ates people again and again .
i have decided not to make a stand@@ -@@ up com@@ edy because i think that this kind of immediate satisfaction is of a chamber full of str@@ ang@@ ers some@@ how dangerous .
if we are looking for this , we are going to be facing a wall .
i sometimes meet live in apo@@ llo when i am interested in seeing it , but there is not so much i can do in general .
i ask him whether he ever had a stand@@ -up com@@ edy tour again .
the fun i have in a room with a director who is helping to create a beginning , a middle part and the end of a journey - i think not , that i can ever repeat it .
so is this his new inc@@ ar@@ nation ?
i think so .
i am a great actor .
it is fun .
we always tell a story , and that is great .
i love stories .
people love stories .

ken@@ ya has begun to provide all state officials with bi@@ ome@@ tric registration to &quot; g@@ host employees &quot; from the sal@@ ary lists of the government .
staff who will be unable to register in the next two weeks would not pay any more , was a government communication .
the government susp@@ ects that thousands of people will be forced to leave the public service even after they have left .
president u@@ hur@@ u ken@@ y@@ att@@ a promised to do so when he took office in 2013 .
when we examined it at the beginning of this year , it was found that at least $ 1 million ( £ 7@@ 00@@ ,000 ) per month was paid for g@@ host employees and other ab@@ u@@ sive financial practices .
the government susp@@ ects that sal@@ aries will continue to be paid on accounts after a person has died or has received the public service , reports w@@ any@@ ama chem@@ o@@ si@@ ri for the b@@ b .
all officials will now have to be present at identification centres in the next two weeks to ensure that their data on bi@@ ome@@ tric regi@@ stra@@ tions are recorded , was reported in a government message .
all those who do not do so without a credible apo@@ logy would be removed from the pay list , was the communication .
&quot; this approach makes a significant contribution to ra@@ tion@@ alising public services by reducing the actual number of officials and also reducing sal@@ ary lists on both government levels .

he was in school for 44 years , 23 of whom were in charge of the school .
from that time man@@ f@@ red rich@@ ter knows many pe@@ ter@@ sha@@ us@@ en@@ er and k@@ ol@@ l@@ b@@ ach@@ er from their time as a student .
his methods were sometimes un@@ conventional , but always driven by his desire to help people in the pu@@ p@@ il .

judge was born in 19@@ 30 in tr@@ au@@ ten@@ au / northern bo@@ hem@@ ia , today tr@@ ut@@ no@@ v .
he was already interested in the first two years of his life after four years of secondary school .
one year later , the su@@ de@@ ten german@@ s were ex@@ propri@@ ated .
within half an hour , the family had to leave their homes .
after a few months in a camp , the company moved to bav@@ aria in 194@@ 6 - the freight wag@@ on .
jud@@ ges were thus in the upper fran@@ con@@ ian valley .
the teacher training took place in b@@ am@@ berg .
man@@ f@@ red rich@@ ter had to travel ten kilometres to the ne@@ arest railway station six times a week , travel by train to b@@ am@@ berg , and travel three kilometres across the city to school and return in the evening .
after two months , man@@ f@@ red rich@@ ter got a red cross home in b@@ am@@ berg : together with up to 15 co-@@ students , he was able to sleep in a dor@@ mit@@ ory .
in 195@@ 1 he made the first and in 195@@ 4 after three years of teaching assi@@ stant , he was the second state ex@@ am .
since ob@@ er@@ fran@@ ken is not a fre@@ e-@@ for@@ -@@ all teacher , he applied to upper bav@@ aria and joined the university of munich on november 1 , 195@@ 4 .
the &quot; m@@ ä@@ u@@ le@@ in room &quot; was his first &quot; service flat &quot; in the school building .
in 195@@ 8 , he moved to the new teacher &apos;s house next to the school , where he was working on a three-@@ room apartment .
this house bought man@@ f@@ red rich@@ ter in 1980 , after the school in k@@ ol@@ l@@ bach had been dis@@ solved in 196@@ 8 .
until then , there were no official meetings in k@@ ol@@ l@@ bach at the pe@@ ter@@ sha@@ us@@ en-@@ k@@ ol@@ l@@ bach school association and in pe@@ ter@@ sha@@ us@@ en five .
from the school year 196@@ 8 / 69 , these were re@@ alised in pe@@ ter@@ sha@@ us@@ en in the town hall today .
when the school association in@@ der@@ s@@ dorf was founded , only primary school remained in the village .
to give a back@@ ward position to the now smaller school , the da@@ wn re@@ ch@@ tor geor@@ g si@@ gl moved to kar@@ ls@@ fel@@ d - and man@@ f@@ red rich@@ ter was his success@@ or .
but pe@@ ter@@ sha@@ us@@ en grew , and so the children and their teachers were able to build today from september 198@@ 2 , which was built in 1997 after judge reti@@ rement .
man@@ f@@ red rich@@ ter p@@ raised the un@@ complicated gener@@ os@@ ity of the then may@@ or lu@@ d@@ wi@@ g g@@ ö@@ tz , who also built a workshop at local costs and extended cel@@ lar rooms in 1997 , although this was according to the guidelines .
&quot; may@@ or g@@ ö@@ tz was very scho@@ ol@@ friendly &quot; , jud@@ ges re@@ mem@@ bered grateful .
in all his career , man@@ f@@ red rich@@ ter never heard a speech from a government representative who was waiting for a department of justice and justice .
&quot; children must be given two things : roots and w@@ ings , &quot; says the 8@@ 4-@@ year-@@ old .
and he had to learn : &quot; this is not always possible &quot; , whether he is only his pu@@ pil@@ s or his own six children , is not entirely clear .
in any case , jud@@ ges were sometimes un@@ conventional .
when students are tested , they did not get a penalty , and were not sent@@ enced to a night &apos;s sleep .
at the expense of the municip@@ ality , jud@@ ges had created two pair of bo@@ x@@ ing glo@@ ves and had the two counter@@ parties compete , even though there was a ve@@ il .
for the good of the school , jud@@ ges had a good relationship with the then may@@ or lu@@ d@@ wi@@ g g@@ ö@@ tz ( c@@ su ) .
he moved the par@@ tis@@ an judge to take over at least as the last judge at the c@@ su list in 1996 .
but jud@@ ges were chosen in place six , and joined the c@@ su .

on friday , however , the number of re@@ st@@ less impres@@ sions alone : the 700 participants of the hr@@ 4 bike tour and accompan@@ ying tro@@ ss enjoyed a break in the lower spa park of bad salz@@ haus@@ en and later a party under the sky .
under the mo@@ tto &quot; cycling and celebr@@ ating new paths between ni@@ d@@ da and kin@@ zi@@ g &quot; , the participants had decided to take part in the event on thursday in bad vil@@ bel and had a concert from van ba@@ ker &amp; band .
on friday it became serious : the cy@@ cli@@ sts took the first stage , which was 60 km across fl@@ or@@ stadt to bad salz@@ haus@@ en and further to sch@@ ot@@ ten .

the beautiful ambi@@ ence of the park was relaxing .
a gentle@@ man also enjoyed a head@@ -@@ massage from his partner : &quot; he deserves it , after all he has already dro@@ pped off bike cha@@ ins today .
meanwhile , the may@@ or and the managing director had to work : they were at the well in front of the re@@ porter ram@@ on ’ s drinking house .
also head of promotion to@@ bi@@ as h@@ agen , since the first hr@@ 4 bike tour in 2004 , has been able to only sk@@ ir@@ t short , since he had plenty of experience with on-@@ site technology .
his pic@@ k@@ up tr@@ uck , where he was shot by three phones and a radio unit with his staff and the 15 member of the motor@@ cycle team , was a very good example of this .
&quot; the majority of participants come from the r@@ hin@@ e-@@ main region , &quot; he said , &quot; but also from gi@@ e@@ ß@@ en or ful@@ da , from lau@@ ter@@ bach or the ta@@ un@@ us , and even from numerous cities in west@@ ph@@ alia .
the number of participants is a bit dependent on the available over@@ night capacities .
in category i , the participants are accommo@@ dated in hotels , in category ii in collective accommodation .
from the spa town the cy@@ cli@@ sts had a good impression when they were re@@ opened after a year and a half : &quot; sho@@ ot ! &quot;
&quot; it was nice in bad salz@@ haus@@ en ! &quot; w@@ av@@ ed you to f@@ are@@ well .
after arriving in scotland , the group was allowed to take a short break .
but in the evening the cy@@ cli@@ sts were in the id@@ yl@@ lic al@@ te@@ bur@@ g@@ park .
under the direction of the sch@@ ot@@ ten@@ er ges@@ ell@@ schaft für tour@@ is@@ m@@ us und stad@@ t@@ marketing ( g@@ ts ) , the park had a beautiful fe@@ st@@ am@@ bi@@ ente and of course had to be tas@@ ted , for example fl@@ ame ca@@ ke with well-@@ cool@@ ed fea@@ ther with well-@@ cool@@ ed white fea@@ ther .
may@@ or sus@@ anne sch@@ a@@ ab , g@@ ts managing director mark@@ us ho@@ ß@@ fel@@ d and ms@@ c chairman wol@@ f@@ gan@@ g wag@@ ner@@ -@@ s@@ ach@@ s in his role as member of the board of ad@@ ac h@@ ess@@ en-@@ thur@@ in@@ gia .
the three were obviously pleased with the &quot; many operations in scotland &quot; .
d@@ j to@@ bi@@ as h@@ agen then released the dance stage .
the opportunity to move freely in the open air was not lost despite the sporting activity on the bicycle .
among the guests were increasingly citizens who were impres@@ sed by the good mo@@ od as well as the great crow@@ d of cy@@ cli@@ sts .
on the second day , the bir@@ stein , guar@@ dian bach and bad or@@ b stations were opened for cy@@ cli@@ sts , including a concert with the tren@@ k@@ wal@@ der .
yesterday , after 18@@ 0 kilometres cycling , the sports people met again in bad vil@@ bel .
do@@ z@@ ens of turkish police officers for &quot; con@@ spir@@ acy &quot; against the government have been arrested and sent@@ enced to death for &quot; con@@ spir@@ acy &quot; .
a total of 33 police officers were arrested in turkey on susp@@ ici@@ on of &apos; con@@ spir@@ acy against the government &apos; , report local media agencies .
the police authorities did not make an immediate comment .
among those arrested , 14 senior police officers , mel@@ de@@ t hur@@ ric@@ ane and the police officers were arrested .
some of them were involved in the corruption investigations against government officials , including four government ministers last december .
a number of turkish police officers were arrested in july for alle@@ ge@@ dly having committed organised criminal organisations and for using telephone numbers to get to the bottom of the matter .
the turkish president rec@@ ep ta@@ y@@ y@@ ip er@@ do@@ gan ( who was then prime minister ) described her actions as part of the activities that were carried out by the islam@@ ist cl@@ er@@ gy@@ man fe@@ thu@@ lla against him and others .
not all children in ukraine return to school .
schools almost everywhere in ukraine opened on monday ( 1 september ) after the summer holidays .
this day is tradi@@ tionally an important day for families , and like thousands of other ukra@@ inian parents , prime minister ar@@ sen@@ i@@ j ja@@ z@@ en@@ ju@@ k brought his daughter to school .
there he told waiting journalists that not all schools were re@@ opened , that he was determined to keep the country open for future generations : he was the first to do so .
the september celebra@@ tions were not held in every school .
the sky is not peaceful across ukraine .
we must fight for a peaceful sky .
the whole of ukraine , a huge common ukra@@ inian people &apos;s front , must fight for a peaceful sky .
ale@@ k@@ san pa@@ stu@@ k@@ how , school director of the school in sla@@ v@@ jan@@ sk , the j@@ az@@ en@@ ju@@ k &apos;s daughter visited , spoke in russian .
we hope that peace will finally re@@ ign here and that children will be given an education that will be useful to them in the future .
the first school day of the new school year is tradi@@ tionally celebrated , with children em@@ bro@@ ide@@ red shir@@ ts , bal@@ lo@@ ons in their hands and their teachers being f@@ lower .
with ron@@ a fair@@ head , the bb@@ c may have found the great director it needs .
it is proud to have a proud to@@ w from the banking world , media management and the inner circle of tory party .
and she has her own fron@@ t-@@ end experience .
her career began with the global management consulting firm ba@@ in and co . , on which she was awarded to mor@@ gan stan@@ ley , bom@@ ba@@ di@@ er , ic@@ i and the media world of pe@@ ar@@ s@@ ons .
it was the chairman of the board of directors of the financial times for seven years and re@@ signed when the top post of pe@@ ar@@ s@@ ons ’ parent company was sent to a younger male colleague .
their compensation was supposed to be nearly £ 1 million .
your political ran@@ king is also solid .
she was born by lord brown , the former chairman of b@@ p , to david camer@@ on , when he was asked for more private economic knowledge in wh@@ ite@@ hall : she was appointed advis@@ or to the cab@@ in@@ et .
her hus@@ band is an earlier tory counc@@ ill@@ or .
as long ago as may , i described the task of the chairman with a po@@ is@@ oned kel@@ ch .
not only is the bb@@ c a huge and complex entity in the heart of public life , but there is also an internal par@@ ado@@ x in its structure .
confidence works in two directions : internal to the first guard of its own management hier@@ arch@@ y in the bb@@ c , but also exter@@ n@@ ally as the voice of public concern and un@@ rest when things go wrong .
this is creating an almost un@@ sustainable du@@ o@@ po@@ ly , which , after a complete comprehensive reform , demands .
but which new coming chairman would risk being att@@ acked , and not being able to take an institution apart , which is so complex as a chinese dy@@ na@@ sty , while being in a position to care for its own job ?
it is a difficult task .
and as if that were not enough , many people are still interested in seeing the bb@@ c reduced - power , money , and status ob@@ sole@@ te .
while the competition is appro@@ aching and new technologies are making old , convenient col@@ lateral threat@@ ening , the forthcoming negotiation of licence fees for bb@@ c with special risks is bound to be a reality .
for the modest sum of £ 14@@ 5.@@ 50 per year , the british public is buying itself into what is certainly the largest media company in the world .
the bb@@ c tells a good story : it says that it is worth 96 % of house@@ holds , and that each of them costs only 40 p@@ ence a day .
and the bb@@ c seems to be rising on the popul@@ arity scale again .
the visual and usage hab@@ its of the bb@@ c have changed : i am now getting news reports about the future of my mobile and i see pack@@ aged programmes later on on my i@@ player .
but she remains a very be@@ loved and no@@ ble institution .
it needs a considerable chairman - i hope she has found it .
per@@ ry from tex@@ as says that low@@ ering t@@ we@@ et is not authorized to use the internet .
a t@@ we@@ et from the official account of the republic@@ an govern@@ or of tex@@ as , ric@@ k per@@ ry , was included on sunday in a down@@ right re@@ mark about the democratic district state prosecu@@ tor , who was at the heart of a newspaper .
the t@@ we@@ et was later deleted and replaced by another per@@ ry user account that was previously running the ab@@ str@@ act .
a t@@ we@@ et is currently sent from my account , which is not authorized by me .
&quot; i approve of the t@@ we@@ et and have deleted it , &quot; it was called in the later news .
per@@ ry staff did not respond promp@@ tly to comments .
although the t@@ wee@@ ts from per@@ ry &apos;s official account were out , it was not clear who actually used the feed .
in the previous t@@ we@@ et was an un@@ favourable picture of the district prosecu@@ tor of tra@@ vis county .
per@@ ry put a ve@@ to on financial support for her office when she refused to allow her to resi@@ gn , leading to an acc@@ us@@ ation against per@@ ry - possibly in 20@@ 16 presidential candidate .
the text of the t@@ wee@@ ts is : &apos; i don &apos;t always go dr@@ un@@ k with the tri@@ ple permitted alcohol level ... but if i do , k@@ ick me go@@ o@@ ver@@ ne@@ ur .
i am the most dr@@ un@@ k democr@@ at in tex@@ as .
le@@ h@@ m@@ berg ’ s office was not responsible for the investigation of the grand jury against per@@ ry .
this was written by michael mc@@ cr@@ um , a special prosecu@@ tor from san ant@@ oni@@ o , who was chosen by a republic@@ an judge .
per@@ ry argu@@ es in no guil@@ ty and called the charge a political tr@@ ick .
his high-@@ class team of legal advis@@ ers requested that the court of justice appointed with the case be able to reject the charge and argue that the law would be in@@ compatible with the law against the most serv@@ ant govern@@ or .
per@@ ry stopped $ 7.@@ 5 million of government money to the public integrity agency .
this ve@@ to provided a public compla@@ int from a lef@@ t-@@ wing wat@@ ch@@ dog party .
per@@ ry &apos;s official account is often updated - and sometimes famous .

ber@@ ke@@ ley explains the housing market again for &quot; normal &quot; .
one of the most prominent buil@@ ders in london pointed out that the construction of the housing market in the south-@@ east of england is back to normal levels .
homes in the capital were ho@@ tly sou@@ gh@@ t-@@ after and were the subject of huge price increases , which the bank of england has been unable to do because of the widespread fear of a credit bu@@ b@@ ble .
ton@@ y pi@@ d@@ g@@ ley , founder and ceo of the high class construction company ber@@ ke@@ ley said on monday : &quot; since the beginning of the current financial year , the market has returned to normal transaction levels since the peak of the year .
the london real estate market was a good place to start during the down@@ turn , as foreign bu@@ yers pus@@ hed the capital .
according to the register of the regi@@ stra@@ tions , prices in the city area alone rose by 18@@ .@@ 5 % in the past year alone , far more than the average increase in england and wal@@ es overall .
the average sales prices for ber@@ ke@@ ley ’ s private , in@@ expensive and student offers rose by about one-@@ fifth in the past year , and at the end of april were around £ 4@@ 23@@ ,000 .
a stronger p@@ ound has , however , in recent months , brought real estate ownership in london less attractive to foreign bu@@ yers - some of them have also been affected by the introduction of new real estate taxes and political rhe@@ tor@@ ic about a possible &quot; ville tax &quot; in the coming elections . &quot; .
the london real estate agent fo@@ x@@ ton war@@ ned in the past week that the mort@@ gage market in the us was in the off@@ ing for april , when more severe credit allocation schemes were presented .
new data from the bank of england on monday show a decline in mort@@ gage allocation in july , which also suggests that the us is reco@@ vering from the recession .
h@@ amp@@ tions international , another real estate agency , correc@@ ted its forec@@ ast for the rise in property prices in london for 20@@ 15 to 3 % , based on an already weak@@ er growth rate .
the transaction volume in the most expensive areas of london , such as ch@@ el@@ sea , may@@ fair and ken@@ sing@@ ton , has now increased by a quarter year , according to the bro@@ ker wa el@@ l@@ is .
nevertheless , the desire for a home in the capital for ber@@ ke@@ ley is a bl@@ essing , as the su@@ ms due for fu@@ tures sales amount to more than eur 2.@@ 2 billion .
mr pi@@ d@@ g@@ ley added : &apos; demand for the right , well-@@ planned product to the best locations is still stable .
in june , the company reported that it had acquired 3,@@ 7@@ 42 new homes in the year until the end of april - almost a third more than at the peak of 2007 before the crisis .
the annual pre-@@ tax result rose by 40 % ann@@ ually to £ 2@@ 80 million , with sales of 18 percent to £ 1.@@ 6 billion .
in a communication on monday before the company &apos;s annual meeting , mr pi@@ d@@ g@@ ley said that the revenue for ber@@ ke@@ ley is expected to reach the current market expectations this year .
analy@@ sts all agree that the annual pre-@@ tax result is estimated at 4@@ 50 million p@@ ounds .
ber@@ ke@@ ley shares were in london in the afternoon , at 2@@ 3.@@ 96 £ .
na@@ ked photos from j@@ enni@@ fer law@@ rence by h@@ ack@@ er published on the internet by h@@ ack@@ ers published on the internet .
j@@ enni@@ fer law@@ rence appeared at the 8@@ 5th o@@ sc@@ ar award .
na@@ ked photos of the o@@ sc@@ ar winner j@@ enni@@ fer law@@ rence were posted online by a h@@ ack@@ er who claimed that she had &quot; made a master list &quot; of other 100 star@@ le@@ ts .
a representative of the star from &quot; the tribute of pan@@ em &quot; confirmed that the photos of la@@ v@@ ren@@ ce e@@ cht are real and compla@@ ined the h@@ ack@@ er because of &quot; bl@@ at@@ ant violation of privacy &quot; .
the authorities have been notified and will follow all those who have taken the sto@@ len photos of j@@ enni@@ fer law@@ rence .
the photos originally taken on the photo sharing page 4@@ ch@@ an are now available in english .
it is not certain how many of the images are genuine , although win@@ ste@@ ad , star from &quot; scot@@ t pil@@ gri@@ m against the rest of the world &quot; on t@@ wit@@ ter also condemned the h@@ ack .
&quot; to those of you who look at photos that my hus@@ band and i took years ago in the private environment of our house - i hope you are really satisfied with you &quot; , wrote win@@ ste@@ ad on t@@ wit@@ ter .

exclusive ex@@ cer@@ pt from ho@@ ward jac@@ ob@@ s@@ ons highly p@@ raised new novel about love and the letter &quot; j &quot; .
they were broken , so they could best describe it , they dis@@ solved slowly , like a card@@ board , which could be bur@@ ned in the rain .
occa@@ sion@@ ally a woman said that he was too serious , stren@@ u@@ ous , intensive , di@@ stan@@ ced and perhaps somewhat scr@@ at@@ ch-@@ brus@@ hed .
and then sha@@ ke his hand .
scr@@ at@@ ch-@@ brus@@ hed he knew .
he was st@@ uck , as in i@@ gel , yes .
the last victim of this stag@@ el@@ ance was a recent aff@@ air , which was more promising for a relief of the lon@@ ely lan@@ ding of his life .
a@@ il@@ in sol@@ om@@ ons was a trem@@ bling and delicate beauty with un@@ t@@ amed hair and a fl@@ at@@ tering heart from a village on the north island , which even more had remote parts and smo@@ other .
she was with an older compan@@ ion coming south , which ke@@ ver@@ n held for her a@@ un@@ t , and which was a p@@ lot in a dam@@ p but par@@ adi@@ si@@ ac@@ al valley with the appropriate name paradise valley .
for several years , no one had lived in the house .
the pi@@ pes were le@@ ak@@ y , in the bathrooms were still sp@@ id@@ ers , nu@@ de ch@@ un@@ ks had their trac@@ es left on all windows and believed they belong@@ ed to all of them , and the garden was filled with wee@@ ds .
it was like the house from a children &apos;s fair@@ y , both threat@@ ening and temp@@ ting , a garden full of myster@@ ies .
por@@ tra@@ it of the author : ho@@ ward jac@@ ob@@ son , whose novel &quot; j &quot; was published on the long@@ list for which man boo@@ ker prize 20@@ 14 is available .
the short@@ list will be announced next week .
ke@@ ver@@ n had deal@@ ers with a@@ il@@ in on the broken songs of the german high grade .
your feet are too big .
their own aggres@@ sion led to songs of this kind no longer being played on the con@@ sole .
not prohibited - nothing was really banned - simply did not play .
ob@@ sole@@ te , as the word ob@@ sol@@ es@@ cent was successfully used .
the general taste was good , which en@@ acted and en@@ acted rules would never have been possible , and how people could have used v@@ om tell@@ rec@@ ord@@ -@@ in-@@ mil@@ li@@ on@@ air@@ e mem@@ o@@ irs , cook@@ books and romantic books .
in the eu@@ ph@@ oria of the day , ke@@ ver@@ n began to play an imag@@ inary piano and to play in a gro@@ b fun@@ ny se@@ ren@@ ade ail@@ in@@ n ’ s big feet .
a@@ il@@ in did not understand that .
&quot; this was a well-known song of a jazz pi@@ an@@ ist called f@@ ats wall@@ er , &quot; he explained it and automatically put two fing@@ ers on his li@@ ps .
his father had always done this to write j . , before he was released from his mouth .
it had been seen as a game between him and his father when he was still small .
his father had played it with his own father , so he had told .
if you start a word with a j , without two fing@@ ers over your li@@ ps , it costs you a pen@@ ny .
it was not a very fun@@ ny game even then , and it was not very fun@@ ny even now .
he knew that he would expect it to do so .
it had to explain what jazz was .
a@@ il@@ in had never heard of any .
jazz , though not directly banned , was not played .
impro@@ vis@@ ation was no longer modern .
it was only room for a single &quot; if &quot; in life .
people wanted to start a me@@ lo@@ dy quite sure where it would end .
likewise , the mind .
its un@@ predic@@ tability made people ner@@ vous .
and jazz was musi@@ cally expres@@ sive mind .
although he had been 10 years old without being taken by sam@@ my dav@@ is junior , he knew he was a little bit an@@ no@@ yed about jazz from the half-@@ secret collection of old c@@ ds of his father .
but at least he did not have to explain that f@@ ats w@@ all@@ er was black .
at her age she probably could not remember a time when pop@@ -@@ sing@@ ers were not black .
again , no laws or constra@@ ints were applied .
a con@@ form@@ ist society meant that every element of this society would be grateful to the principle of group talent - grateful as the people spa@@ red from fate .
people with a@@ fro@@ -@@ caribbean origin were affected by temper@@ ament and body building for entertainment and sports , meaning that san@@ ges and ran them .
people originally from the indian sub@@ continent were like people from nature with electronic equipment .
what remains of the polish community is the fact that the can@@ al@@ isation was concerned ; what the gre@@ e@@ ks left was sh@@ at@@ tered by plates .
those from the gulf states and the lev@@ ante , whose grand@@ parents did not leave the country quickly than what had happened , were not able to do so , out of fear of being att@@ acked for fi@@ re-@@ fighting .
everyone according to his or her abilities .
since she only heard b@@ all@@ ads , a@@ il@@ in@@ n was hard to understand how the off@@ ensive words , which are ke@@ ver@@ n her just vo@@ ic@@ ed , could be more ver@@ mon@@ ished .
music was an expression of love .
&quot; they are not really off@@ ensive , &quot; ke@@ ver@@ n said .
except perhaps for people whose feet are too large .
my father never insul@@ ted anyone , but he loved this song .
he talked too much , but the negl@@ ected garden gave him the dec@@ ep@@ tive sense of security .
nothing could prevent the sound insul@@ ation of the huge carbon dio@@ xide leaves .
a@@ il@@ in still did not understand .
why would your father have loved this ?
he wanted to say that it was a ju@@ x , but hesit@@ ated to re@@ sume two fing@@ ers in their presence .
she thought she was already doing something strange anyway .
&quot; it seemed fun@@ ny to him , &quot; he said instead .
she sha@@ ved dis@@ beli@@ ever@@ s and bloc@@ ked ke@@ ver@@ ns ’ vision .
there was nothing else in the world to see than the un@@ comb@@ ed r@@ ab@@ bin@@ ic hair .
there was nothing he would have liked to see otherwise .
&quot; if you say it , &quot; they mean it without convic@@ tion .
but that doesn &apos;t explain why you prefer to tell me .
they seemed to be honest .
are my feet too big ?
he looked again .
your feet are not so direct .
maybe your an@@ k@@ les , a little bit ...
and tho@@ u sa@@ ith tho@@ u h@@ ast ha@@ ted me , because my an@@ k@@ les are too th@@ ick ?
h@@ ate yourself ?
of course i h@@ ate you not .
that is just the sil@@ ly song .
he could have said &quot; i love you &quot; , but it was too early for that .
&quot; your th@@ ick an@@ k@@ les are exactly why you like me .
i am a bit per@@ verse .
that was not right .
it was fun@@ ny to say .
if he tried to be fun@@ ny , he often got into trouble because he was like his father , not talking about the re@@ ass@@ uring charm that he had to buy .
perhaps his father wanted to be cru@@ el .
perhaps he , ke@@ ver@@ n , wanted to be that .
despite his friendly eyes .
a@@ il@@ in sol@@ om@@ ons was red and raised from her song &quot; the sun &quot; , thro@@ wing the con@@ sole around and dis@@ appe@@ aring .
the wine of the hol@@ low flowers , so dr@@ un@@ ken@@ ness was no exc@@ use for him .
in their ex@@ ci@@ tement , they seemed to trem@@ ble as pal@@ m@@ we@@ del was in stor@@ m .
and your th@@ ick head is exactly why i am per@@ ver@@ ted to you .
apart from that i am not at all .
she was sorry , both because of the unnecessary us@@ eless nature of his words and because of the fear that she had shown when she stood up against him .
did she think he would beat them ?
she had not told him about life on the cold northern archi@@ pel@@ ago , where she grew up , but he had no doubt that she was in essence so .
the same huge and ic@@ e-@@ cold ocean bro@@ ke out here as there on the shore .
the same conf@@ used men , with even th@@ ick@@ er skin and ad@@ dic@@ tive after what happened , were not their pre@@ dec@@ ess@@ ors s@@ mu@@ gg@@ lers and beach rob@@ bers , moved from cr@@ ack@@ ers to k@@ nei@@ pe .
th@@ ick ?
they would have shown her a big f@@ ist if she didn &apos;t fit up !
you first k@@ n@@ ut@@ sch@@ en - k@@ nu@@ t@@ sch@@ en was the most commonly used word for an ero@@ tic attr@@ action between men and women , a counter@@ -@@ po@@ ison to the no@@ where love bal@@ la@@ sts from the world .
ke@@ ver@@ n ’ s view was that this was an unnecessary re@@ fin@@ ement , as the cr@@ ut@@ ching itself was already an act of violence .
a@@ il@@ in sol@@ om@@ ons gave him a sign through her body to go .
he was raised from the dec@@ k chair like an old man .
she also felt ble@@ ak , but the power of his sor@@ row surprised her .
this was not the end of the world .
they hardly knew each other .
she was watching him as he di@@ stan@@ ced himself - as from a room on the upper floor her compan@@ ion was watching him - a man compla@@ ining with something he himself had to deal with .
ad@@ am leaves the garden , she thought .
she felt a su@@ dden pain for him and men in general , although some had raised their hands against them .
a man turned away from her , his back b@@ ent , ash@@ amed , defe@@ ated , without fighting spirit - why was that a sign of a man that she had good to know , if she was not so familiar with ?
when she was alone again , a@@ il@@ in@@ n looked at her feet .
several years before the stories of the past , es@@ me n@@ us@@ s@@ bau@@ m , an intelligent and enthusi@@ astic 3d anim@@ ation team , worked on behalf of of@@ no@@ v , the non-@@ legislative director of the supervisory body for the research and development .
&quot; much has been done and much still needs to be done , &quot; she wrote , &quot; to the in@@ n@@ ate aggres@@ si@@ veness of a people who has suffered a thousand wars and who have won most of them , especially in the last few years .
but some features are in@@ ex@@ or@@ able .
the higher the church tower , it seems , the lower the passion that he continues to ar@@ ou@@ se .
the people cr@@ y when hearing s@@ enti@@ mental bal@@ la@@ sts , are ab@@ str@@ acted by stories of over@@ taken difficulties , claim@@ ing to be firmly bound by the virtu@@ es of marriage and family life , but still not only the former raw material .
&quot; they have an unfortunate tend@@ ency to ex@@ ag@@ ger@@ ate , &quot; said their ment@@ or when he read the whole report .
i suggest that you write less nov@@ els .
es@@ me n@@ us@@ s@@ bau@@ m lo@@ wered her head .
i must also ask : are you a@@ the@@ ist ?
&quot; i do not think i have to say , &quot; es@@ me n@@ us@@ s@@ bau@@ m rep@@ lied .
are you les@@ bian ?
again es@@ me rec@@ alled her right to privacy and ref@@ using to say .
fem@@ in@@ ist ?
again , silence .
&quot; i don &apos;t ask , &quot; said lu@@ ther r@@ ab@@ in@@ o@@ wit@@ z , &quot; because i am against a@@ the@@ ism , les@@ bi@@ an@@ ism or fem@@ in@@ ism .
this is a pre@@ ju@@ dic@@ ed job .
we are serving a society without pre@@ jud@@ ice .
but certain types of hyper@@ sensi@@ tivity , which are in themselves absolutely acceptable and comm@@ end@@ able , can result occa@@ sion@@ ally as you have presented .
you yourself have obviously taken pre@@ jud@@ ices against the church , and these things you call &apos; dis@@ gu@@ sting &apos; and &apos; raw &apos; could be used by others as well as an expression of natural strength and vit@@ ality .
if you continue on the path of what has happened when it happened , as if it were , you will be able to do it yesterday , and that means giving the country its essential vit@@ ality .
es@@ me n@@ us@@ s@@ bau@@ m looked around while r@@ ab@@ in@@ o@@ wit@@ z spoke .
behind his head , an led let@@ tering in fl@@ am@@ ing@@ or@@ os@@ a repeated the advice that of@@ now gave to the country in the last quarter of a century or more .
sm@@ ile on your neighb@@ our , value your partner , listen to b@@ all@@ ads , visit musi@@ c@@ als , use your phone , talk , explain your message , listen to , vote , and more .
speaking is better than silence , the healthy word is better than the written , but nothing is better than love .
&quot; i understand absolutely what you want to go out , &quot; es@@ me n@@ us@@ s@@ bau@@ m rep@@ lied with a calm voice when she was sure that her superior had spoken to the end , &quot; and i say nothing other than that we are still secret .
my concern is that we are not being able to help us , without warning , to see how we are repe@@ ating the mistakes that have been made at all on what happened when it happened .
this time it is not the others that we are an@@ gr@@ y and di@@ str@@ ust .
lu@@ ther r@@ ab@@ in@@ o@@ wit@@ z formed a py@@ ram@@ id with his hands .
to make an an@@ gel &apos;s pati@@ ence possible .
&quot; they go too far , &quot; he said , &quot; if they are calling acts &quot; mistakes &quot; that our grand@@ parents may or may not have committed .
they also go too far when they say that they are going to share their &quot; an@@ ger &quot; and their &quot; susp@@ ici@@ on &quot; of &quot; others &quot; .
it should not be necessary to give someone in their position the remin@@ der that we are not the same thing as in the case of the past as in the protection of the present .
there was no &apos; we &apos; and there were no &apos; others &apos; .
it was a time of dis@@ order , that is all we know .
&quot; from the , if we are honest to ourselves , &quot; es@@ me d@@ ared to in@@ ject &quot; no part of society can claim to have be@@ have well .
i am not compla@@ ining to anyone .
whether it was done badly or well , what happened has happened .
that was then .
nothing more needs to be said about this - we agree on that .
and just as no blame must be assigned , so no blame must be re@@ paid if a debt of this kind is appropriate and if it is a way to prevent it .
but what is the use of the past if we do not learn from it - and i am sure we will learn from it - if we do not learn from it - and we do not learn from it - and i am sure that this is not the case ?
the past serves to make us forget them .
if i may say something about this , i would like to say something about it .
lu@@ ther r@@ ab@@ in@@ o@@ wit@@ z let his py@@ ram@@ id collapse .
&quot; i will consider your report , &quot; he said and dis@@ missed it .
the next day , when you went to work as usual , she was taken over by a motor@@ cy@@ c@@ list who , as pass@@ ers have described , was in a kind of &quot; brut@@ al r@@ age &quot; .

prime minister thomas th@@ ab@@ ane f@@ led the country and said that the country ’ s army had re@@ located to its seat and that government buildings in the capital , mas@@ er@@ u , had been occupied .
the premier brought his family to the ad@@ jac@@ ent south africa after being att@@ acked by threats of attack .
military spo@@ kes@@ man major n@@ t@@ le@@ le n@@ to@@ i said that there is de fac@@ to no cou@@ p , but that the military is respon@@ ding to the threat of &apos; political fan@@ a@@ tics &apos; , whose re@@ ign of arm@@ ament is under control .
&quot; what happened this morning was that the staff of defense forces of les@@ o@@ th@@ o acted after having discovered several intelligence reports .
the south african government spo@@ kes@@ man cla@@ y@@ son mon@@ y@@ ela said that the military action was a rela@@ pse .
&quot; although no one has claimed that the government has been tor@@ n by violence , all the reports are agreed that the activities of the defense forces of les@@ o@@ th@@ o have yet to show signs of a cou@@ p d &apos;@@ é@@ t@@ at .
spo@@ kes@@ men for the military of les@@ o@@ th@@ o announced on sunday that the soldiers had entered their bar@@ r@@ acks and the situation in the capital was calm .
meanwhile , vice premier mo@@ th@@ et@@ jo@@ ya me@@ tering takes over the leadership during th@@ ab@@ an@@ es ’ absence .
th@@ ab@@ ane announced that he believes he is un@@ willing to accept the government ’ s ple@@ dge to combat corruption .
in les@@ o@@ th@@ o , there has been great tension since june , after th@@ ab@@ ane parliamentary meetings had been held because of the conflicts in his unity government .
he said that his actions should not have under@@ min@@ ed the government , which is not the case .
production in the eurozone on a 13@@ -@@ month low
the increase in production in the eurozone slow@@ ed in august to the lowest point in the last 13 months , such a closely observed increase in the number of countries .
the final tag shopping index of the producer trade is marked by a &quot; buy &quot; index .
a value of 50 indicates an expansion .
new orders were with@@ drawn and fac@@ tories suffered a drop in the face of rising ten@@ sions between the eu and russia over ukraine .
the figures are very clear before the european central bank ( ecb ) meeting on thursday .
markets expect the bank to provide a clear plan for dealing with a slow recovery in the eurozone , as well as for the im@@ minent de@@ fl@@ ation of only 0.@@ 3 % inflation .
there is spec@@ ulation that the ecb head , mari@@ o drag@@ hi , will be in a position to make further information later this week as to whether he will be able to provide quanti@@ tative eas@@ ing for the eurozone , according to the united kingdom and the united kingdom .
&quot; although small growth is better than no growth , the bra@@ king effects of increasing economic and geo@@ political un@@ certain@@ ties are not easy for producers to understand , &quot; said ro@@ b do@@ b@@ son , senior econom@@ ist at mark .
factory p@@ mi for germany , the largest trading partner of russia in the eu , fell to the bottom in 11 months with 5@@ 1.@@ 4 .
meanwhile , the second world war fell by more than half , france , the pl@@ c , to 4@@ 6.@@ 9 .
france remains a concern child , as does italy ’ s decline from a solid expansion to stag@@ n@@ ant growth .
indic@@ ations that growth stimul@@ us in the key industry mechanism is germany , as well as spain and the netherlands , are also not re@@ ass@@ uring , &quot; said mr do@@ b@@ son .
the decline in industry is likely to fuel the fire of analy@@ sts who are seeking further monetary or fiscal stimul@@ us .
one positive news came from the republic of ireland , where the p@@ mi rose to 5@@ 7.@@ 3 , the highest level since the end of 1999 .
ho@@ ward ar@@ cher , chief econom@@ ist at i@@ h@@ s global insight , said : &quot; the best thing you can do for the shopping man@@ a index of the producer &apos;s business in the eurozone is august .
he added : &apos; eurozone producers find life at present quite difficult , as the current increases in geo@@ political ten@@ sions - especially in terms of russia and ukraine - are un@@ certain in the continued difficult circumstances in many countries .
these increased un@@ certain@@ ties have clearly affected the economy - particularly , and the confidence of consumers , and pre@@ sum@@ ably leads to some orders being dela@@ yed or even cancelled , particularly large orders .
he said that it is becoming &apos; increasingly likely &apos; that the ecb will eventually become a kind of q@@ e , &apos; although we susp@@ ect that this is limited , it will be . &apos;
the hel@@ l@@ fire of the survi@@ v@@ ors of bes@@ lan : ten years have passed since the terrible sie@@ ge of school , as the people who were tr@@ app@@ ed in it are still suffering .
ten years ago , more than 1@@ ,000 people were killed by chec@@ hen mil@@ i@@ ti@@ as in a school in bes@@ lan in southern russia .
more than 3@@ 30 people , more than half of them children , were killed in the three-@@ day mar@@ ty@@ r@@ dom that sho@@ c@@ ked the world .
we returned to bes@@ lan to take some of the victims , who were killed by the gre@@ y army and the people who were killed in the class@@ room .
exactly a decade after the app@@ alling sie@@ ge of the bes@@ lan school , which claimed 3@@ 34 lives , including 18@@ 6 children , war@@ ned the hel@@ den@@ ic survi@@ v@@ ors of the night before a new apo@@ c@@ aly@@ pse .
as a fan@@ a@@ tical islam@@ ist terrorist , children and parents were arrested on 1 september 2004 , the beginning of a new school year , and imprison@@ ed , it seemed like the most evil of evil .
the tragedy united west and east in rev@@ ul@@ sion , and transformed the world into a more un@@ certain stor@@ m of p@@ ity and hope in the worst of mis@@ ery .
ten years later we returned to bes@@ lan to take some of the victims , who were killed by the gre@@ y army .
we found surprising young people who had overcome resistance , although the memory of these terrorist ca@@ ver@@ ns made them persecu@@ te for ever .
their greatest hope ?
that the war that is now r@@ aging ukraine - and in which children like them are dying - is now ending .
the girl who was photograph@@ ed in an attempt to enter the tor@@ n school hall of f@@ ame was not able to see the light of day .
it was taken by the russian star photograph@@ er di@@ mit@@ ri be@@ li@@ ak@@ ov and famous when she was only in her under@@ wear trying to get into the sh@@ at@@ tered school sports hall .
the first time a@@ id@@ a was looking for her mother lar@@ is@@ sa , now 40 years old .
both were considered dead , but they survi@@ ved .
&quot; a woman told me i should run for my life , but i could not , &quot; said a@@ id@@ a back then .
my leg@@ s were floo@@ ded .
i stood up and clim@@ bed back to my mother to find .
a soldi@@ er brought them to safety .
after a series of operations , it was considered completely heal@@ ed , but said yesterday : &apos; three months ago , the pain returned .
i am afraid i have to be operated again .
some sh@@ ards of sh@@ ell@@ s are still in my k@@ ne@@ e .
its goal is now to become a d@@ enti@@ st to help people , as their health is helped by doctors .
&quot; this tragedy changed my life , but it did not break me , &quot; she says combat flu@@ x .
&quot; that happened to me and you cannot change that .
once a year i always go to the sports hall to remember those who have been there .
my friends and i try not to talk about it on other days .
the pain is too great .
my best friend and future class@@ m@@ ate d@@ zer@@ a ga@@ po@@ eva was there !
we played together when we were small , dre@@ aming of being together at school .
&quot; i don &apos;t want to mar@@ ry until i finish my studies and start my career .
i am thinking of a family later on .
it says that the sie@@ ge is always part of it , although the memory is a little weak@@ er every year .
i am glad that many people in the world still remember our hor@@ r@@ ors and we are so grateful for the help we have received from people in britain and everywhere .
when i see the photo of me online , how to go back to school , i think that many people it is the first time that we understand our catastro@@ ph@@ e and help to prevent this happening again .
the boy who was thro@@ wn through the bul@@ let ha@@ il , in the opinion that his mother was dead , was a child .
it was his first school day ( rus@@ sians go to school at 7 years ) and survi@@ ved the three-@@ day sie@@ ge in the arms of his mother tam@@ ara .
when he was seven , he said : &apos; m@@ ama told me i should go to the ground when there was an explo@@ sion , and their hands should be held &apos; .
after an explo@@ sion he thought she would die .
she said to him : &apos; run &apos; .
they are afraid that they may be dead , he f@@ led and saw a cr@@ ying inf@@ ant on the way , took it by hand and f@@ led through a bul@@ let ha@@ il .
his father v@@ la@@ di@@ mir , who had his son out in the poor castle , said : &quot; dam@@ ir told me that his mother had died .
he said : &apos; i could not save her &apos; .
in reality , tam@@ ara was st@@ um@@ b@@ led out and in@@ ju@@ red with le@@ g in@@ jur@@ ies in the hospital , in turn , assum@@ ing that her son had died .
after re@@ unification , she said : &apos; i cr@@ y with joy .
i could not believe it .
he ran in and embr@@ ac@@ ed me .
dam@@ ir was later flo@@ wn to london ( from the now un@@ released newspaper news of the world ) to the premi@@ ere ton@@ y bla@@ ir and his wife ch@@ eri@@ e .
&quot; this hor@@ ror is following you every day , but i wish i could go on re@@ member@@ ing , &quot; he said yesterday .
but i can say that in my memory it was getting worse .
i still know that i will be able to use all my to@@ y pi@@ st@@ ols immediately afterwards .
but now i can play computer games with sho@@ oting scenes and this is no problem for me .
&quot; i am not afraid to enter the sports hall , but i do not think about myself .
i remember these children who i met in the cour@@ ty@@ ard and who did not go outside .
we never say that they were killed or dead .
we say that you will stay in the sports hall .
i remember very well my trip to london , especially the to@@ y store , where i had to choose everything .
but now he is afraid of location like ukraine , where wars are the kind of mis@@ fortun@@ e that he and his friends have suffered .
this hor@@ ror is following you every day , but i wish i could stop remin@@ ding me of this .
&quot; i am so sorry for all those who have suffered the ab@@ om@@ inations , &quot; dam@@ ir said , who was working as a volunte@@ er in a monaster@@ y last week .
i would like to help .
one day i want to go to the police and i hope that they will be able to take me to the school academy next year .
his mother tam@@ ara , 48 , said : &quot; 37 children from our neighbourhood were killed , they can imagine what it would be like ?
i remember the terrible silence after the sie@@ ge that took place , there were simply no children calling and cr@@ ying .
she vi@@ vi@@ dly rec@@ alls her trip to london with dam@@ ir .
the people of london cr@@ ying when i told our story .
i understood then how people on the other side of the world could understand our feel@@ ings , and their support showed .
she was ch@@ eri@@ e bla@@ ir and her foundation grateful for the prize and the opportunity to travel to london in autumn 2004 .
i wish i could call ch@@ eri@@ e and just tell her her@@ self that 10 years have passed , but i am still going to meet her and her hus@@ band in london to remember how that happened .
i remember how dam@@ ir li@@ kes to call bor@@ sch@@ ts@@ ch and she met all the local russian restaurants .
i remember how he worked with cell@@ ars in a restaurant , but dam@@ ir was sho@@ c@@ ked by his water gun and they ran away .
and that was only one month after the hor@@ ror .
i was surprised that the british were so willing to share our pain and support us .
she said , &apos; i always think that this world has not improved over these 10 years .
in ukraine , the war is now continuing , and people are dying every day , and i believe that many children have been killed and are still being killed .
these are just as children as ours .
i think that for many of the war is part of the news they hear when they are bo@@ red or with something else .
i simply know what these people feel , the whole hor@@ ror .
and i cannot stop saying that .
nothing has changed , people still want to kill each other and that is so sad .
dam@@ ir was large and is a very gent@@ le and calm boy , he is not aggres@@ sive at all or an@@ gr@@ y .
for example , he is not looking for reven@@ ge , he is not overwhel@@ med by the past ab@@ om@@ inations .
i know he does not like to remember that , but he has six close friends from the class and they occa@@ sion@@ ally go to the sports hall and infl@@ ate there c@@ and@@ les .
when he was smaller , he suffered - i remember how he was sometimes on the sound of a sof@@ a , the face of us , hours of work .
not sle@@ eping , his eyes were open .
i also remember how he all used his weapons and other military to@@ ys .
i can hardly believe that i have been so sure for a few hours that he was dead and i would never see him again .
when i reco@@ vered and was ready for the explo@@ sion , i saw for myself , and saw the hel@@ l around me , with everywhere .
i was absolutely sure that my little boy was unable to survive in this hel@@ l .
&quot; i remember having listened to him , &quot; da@@ em@@ ir , lau@@ f , lau@@ f away &quot; , but i was also so sure that he did not hear me .
but he heard it and he has gone away .
and so life , unlike many others , goes on for us .
geor@@ gi@@ j il@@ y@@ in , 17
the boy , whose terrible image after the sie@@ ge became the symbol of the bes@@ lan at@@ ro@@ cities , was born in the city of bes@@ lan .
con@@ sol@@ ation : the bes@@ lan survi@@ v@@ or geor@@ gi@@ j ly@@ in with his mother fa@@ tim@@ a after the sie@@ ge of 2004 , right a picture of geor@@ gi@@ j today , right of geor@@ gi@@ j a picture of geor@@ gi@@ j today .
its bloo@@ d-@@ floo@@ ded face was characterized by fear when he was ran@@ ked for his life , while chec@@ hen terrorists lost his class camer@@ am@@ en .
his image was one of the most sho@@ cking symb@@ ols of the bar@@ bar@@ ism of bes@@ lan .
his mother fa@@ tim@@ a , 54 , a doctor , had invited him for his first day of school before she rus@@ hed to get her older son w@@ la@@ di@@ mir to university .
&quot; i left the farm about two minutes before the terrorists stor@@ med it , and so the mine little boy remained there for three terrible days alone , &quot; rec@@ alls the man .
not entirely alone , there was a whole family of rela@@ tives of us , but they were all killed .
only my geor@@ gi@@ j managed to survive .
the closer this date is , the har@@ der it is to think about it and talk about it .
there is not a single day on which we cannot remember this tragedy .
we do not think it is a long time ago , i think it had happened yesterday , some scenes from these days are following me fore@@ ver .
no one will ever forget that , i promise you .
pen@@ etr@@ ating : the image of geor@@ gi@@ j ( left ) was one of the most sho@@ cking of the attack and was called stat@@ ue ( right ) .
i remember geor@@ gi@@ j taking part in the meeting at school on that day , saying he wanted to give his teacher a hu@@ g .
i knew that he was alive , when i saw him on television .
and now there is even this stat@@ ue of the we@@ eping geor@@ gi@@ j in san mar@@ ino .
geor@@ gi@@ j does not like the picture , and it is in our home book@@ shel@@ f .
i understand that , but i also believe that people around the world , thanks to this picture , feel our pain .
geor@@ gi@@ j says today : &apos; it is important never to repeat this .
&quot; i doubt that we have ever learned the truth .
people are increasingly looking at such trag@@ e@@ dies and never knowing the truth .
and now they are investig@@ ating the cr@@ ash of this bo@@ eing in ukraine .
will we ever know what caused him ?
this world is becoming something terrible .
&quot; i cannot understand how this is possible , because if you ask people , nobody wants a war , so how is it done ?
ten years is not at all the same with such pain .
we need do@@ z@@ ens of years to forget it a little .
it has att@@ acked my health and i still feel it .
for about three or four years , i had some night@@ ma@@ res because of the sie@@ ge , but then it became better .
i went back to school later in 2004 and was afraid every day .
i thought of my friends and class@@ mates who were killed .
that is why i always go to the sports hall when 1 september approaches .
i want to thank my old child@@ hood friends .
it is difficult for me to enter the sports hall , but i must do it .
i do not feel like a victim , this story is now part of my past .
i will not forget it , but i am not sorry .
my life goes on .
i finished school this year and i have visited a medical college in v@@ la@@ di@@ ka@@ w@@ ka@@ z .
i will be a car@@ di@@ ac sur@@ ge@@ on .
my first choice was an education in the army .
i wanted to become a soldi@@ er , but my health did not allow it .
i wanted to fight for my country , but that will not happen .
geor@@ gi@@ j f@@ ani@@ ye@@ v , 20 years old , 20 years old , has been a member of the european parliament .
the boy who survi@@ ved , although he was at the foot of a mur@@ der@@ ous terrorist , was a man who was a prison@@ er .
a mir@@ acle : geor@@ gi@@ j f@@ ani@@ ye@@ v was to be found at the foot of a mur@@ der@@ ous terrorist , but he did not manage to survive .
during the sie@@ ge he was held in the sports hall and sat next to the bom@@ b that was at the foot of a mur@@ der@@ ous terrorist .
it is a real mir@@ acle that he was not killed .
&quot; we feel it was yesterday that we said , &quot; geor@@ gi@@ j says , who was appointed intelligence officer of the f@@ s@@ b , but this was because of his health damage due to the sie@@ ge .
it is still with me , it is nothing i have left behind .
i am now older and people say that children can easily cope with bad experiences - i must say that is not true .
&quot; in 2006 i worked with psycho@@ logi@@ sts and felt a bit better after that , but i can not forget it .
i would like to forget that .
2005 - in the year after - was the first and only time i went back to the sports hall .
i lost consci@@ ousness .
i will never go back there again and please do not ask me to show you where i stand in this famous picture .
survi@@ v@@ ors : geor@@ gi@@ j f@@ ani@@ ye@@ v today , with a photo of himself in hospital after the sie@@ ge on the lap@@ top .
my pain is immen@@ se and i wear it every day with me .
my friends know that i do not like to think about it or talk about it , and they never asked me about school .
physi@@ cally , i am doing well .
i should be careful with my in@@ ju@@ red k@@ ne@@ e , but i can now run well .
but because of my health i could not attend the f@@ s@@ b secret service academy in st. pe@@ ter@@ sburg , as i wanted .
i have received my documents , including medical documents , and you have rep@@ lied that it is not possible .
my second passion was the animals , so i went to the veter@@ inary institute .
i have been behind me for two years .
he lear@@ ns the treatment of all animals &quot; from c@@ ats to co@@ ws &quot; .
he said : &apos; i knew i had never told my children of my experiences .
children should not know about this and they should not suffer from it , of course .
his mother marina , 42 , said : &quot; this pain never leaves me .
he is in my soul , worse when the anniversary approaches .
i will be invited to comm@@ em@@ or@@ ate the comm@@ em@@ or@@ ation cere@@ mony .
i know that geor@@ gi@@ j will not go .
he still has to be much more violent because he was there and i was not .
i wa@@ ited at home for him and could not help .
i am so grateful to god that he was returned to me , and here in bes@@ lan all of them are drawn .
it remains in us .
geor@@ gi@@ j is now an adult , but this hor@@ ror is still in him .
it is difficult to accept this when something so unfair is being proposed .
he is a young , he li@@ kes sport , but he cannot participate because of his k@@ ne@@ es .
he has been operated several times , he can run , but he cannot do sport .
i would say that he has been 50 % hor@@ ror , but one cannot say that entirely .
this terrible experience will always be with us .
many friends and neighbours were killed in the sie@@ ge and this only rein@@ forces my pain .
i have lost many people i knew well and who i was expensive .
my son is with me , and that is the greatest gift that god could make me , but my heart cr@@ ies for the dead .
i know of families where new children were born , but also of wi@@ do@@ ws who never again married .
it is difficult to accept that life should continue , even if we do not want it .
i will never forget how my heart jum@@ ped in me when i saw him in hospital .
and now i see what is happening in the world - wars in other regions .
what are these people fighting for ?
why are they killing each other ?
the war is now very close to our country and i almost cannot believe that .
we used to be a friendly country , how can it be that we are fighting now ?
people and children are suffering , i am sure that many children have already been killed in ukraine and many more are still being killed .
if we only attack all these re@@ be@@ ls and throw them out - as far as possible .
al@@ j@@ ona t@@ sk@@ ay@@ eva , 10
the baby that is so att@@ acking from a special mission command in safety is a very important part of the baby &apos;s life .
saved : al@@ j@@ ona t@@ sk@@ ay@@ eva is run by a russian special mission command ( left ) .
it is now ten ( right ) and does not remember the cru@@ el@@ ty of the people of the united states at all .
the world held its bre@@ ath in 2004 , when the baby al@@ j@@ ona died in the arms of a russian polic@@ em@@ an from the sie@@ ge of bes@@ lan .
the terrorists let them go , but kept their 30@@ -@@ year-@@ old mother , who was 10-@@ year-@@ old si@@ ster k@@ ri@@ st@@ ina and her brother ma@@ k@@ ha@@ r in school sports hall , in their cru@@ el@@ ty .
ma@@ k@@ ha@@ r , then three years old , es@@ cap@@ ed , but al@@ jon@@ as mother and si@@ ster died in the mur@@ der@@ ous slau@@ ghter .
her father rus@@ lan has since married again and has been with his new wife swe@@ t@@ lan@@ a a a little girl who , after his lost daughter , cri@@ st@@ ina , has called him .
al@@ j@@ ona , now ten years old , does not remember the sie@@ ge and has become an intelligent and happy girl .
&quot; you are now a great happy family and al@@ j@@ ona and ma@@ k@@ ha@@ r are both great children , &quot; says a close friend .
rus@@ lan is a fantastic father and wants to give you all the mem@@ ories that come with the t@@ enth anniversary .

4 tips for better under@@ water photos and videos .
if you like to make photos or videos under water , there is a selection of equipment .
the che@@ apest option is a water@@ tight point and sho@@ ot , as the ni@@ kon cool@@ pi@@ x does .
i took these photos at a family party with several cameras , all at a price of less than $ 3@@ 50 .
regardless of the equipment , there are some rules for the best results .
check your equipment twice .
even if you have a water@@ proof camera , make sure that the battery is not damaged or damaged .
set your camera to the photos or videos you want to record .
some cameras and cam@@ cor@@ ders have scene and recording modes , with which the occup@@ ants can adjust the exposure time for the tw@@ ili@@ ght under@@ water conditions .
and before jum@@ ping in , check to which depth your equipment is functional .
some cameras are only allowed for 5 feet , others up to 50 or 60 feet .
search our shopping guide and the reviews for digital cameras for conventional and water@@ proof models .
take multiple sho@@ ts - because many will not work .
point and sho@@ ot cameras have a l@@ cd , which allows you to comp@@ ile images .
even if you have an l@@ cd , it is difficult to see it under water and the right image is a lu@@ cky case .
so you take a lot of pictures .
if your camera has a sequ@@ ence mode with which a series of images can be taken with slightly changed exposure settings , use it .
stay close to the surface .
the light is dram@@ atically worse the further it is away from the surface .
so , if possible , they will stay close to the surface when they take pictures in a pool , a lake or the sea .
this allows you to add more color to your photos ; the de@@ eper you go , the less color you will see .
go close to the objects .
this is also good advice on land , but it is all the more important under water because of poor lighting conditions .
it is particularly important that you are connected to an action c@@ am : these devices often have a fixed wide angle lin@@ e. they are therefore suitable for all types of applications .
andre@@ w law@@ son was a man of the variety whose character changes things , even in such a gi@@ gan@@ tic organization as the n@@ h@@ s .
as an advis@@ ing an@@ aes@@ the@@ sia doctor , he devoted his career to helping the si@@ ck both the ag@@ ony of the disease and the ag@@ ony of the treatment .
among his patients , his wife rec@@ alls , was a mi@@ 6 employee who was involved in the dev@@ ast@@ ating effects of torture .
law@@ son knew that doctors would not be able to diagno@@ se and diagno@@ se diseases , while the over@@ do@@ se was largely accompanied by something else : pain .
one day in 2007 , however , he was the one whose path began .
&quot; i did not feel &quot; wrote the book in may of this year .
i had difficulty getting up .
while he was on the subject of fl@@ u similar symp@@ t@@ oms , he noted that he was telling his wife ju@@ li@@ et im@@ pati@@ ently .
&quot; i want everything to be done now , &quot; he noted .
as ju@@ li@@ et for a week on a business trip , law@@ son felt very unusual in feeling un@@ comfortable and un@@ comfortable .
something was in the air .
he asked a colleague to send an x-@@ ray investigation of his bre@@ ast .
only two weeks ago he was in the french alps for skiing .
the result of the x-@@ ray inspection was available .
he suffered from mes@@ o@@ the@@ li@@ om , an incur@@ able cancer that caused the bre@@ ast skin , that is , the lun@@ gs over@@ drawing skin .
as with most can@@ c@@ ers , the exact cause is usually difficult to determine .
for example , while some smo@@ kers are suffering from l@@ ung cancer , not all l@@ ung cancer suff@@ e@@ rers have been smo@@ kers in the past .
but mes@@ o@@ the@@ li@@ om is different .
in almost all cases , the tri@@ gger is an as@@ be@@ sto@@ s load - contact with the fi@@ bre construction material , which was once known as &quot; mir@@ acle &quot; but has now been recognized as fat@@ al .
for most of us , mes@@ o@@ the@@ li@@ om is a disease that can easily be ignored .
as@@ be@@ sto@@ s is , after all , a product of the past .
the most dangerous type of as@@ be@@ sto@@ s has not been used in britain since the 196@@ 0s when the industry volun@@ tar@@ ily committed to ce@@ asing to use it .
even where it has been used , only people in certain sectors have worked directly with the fab@@ ric - pl@@ um@@ bers , buil@@ ders , car@@ pen@@ try and shi@@ py@@ ard workers , for example .
as an industrial hazar@@ dous material from another time , it seems to be hardly even more worrying today .
but this com@@ plac@@ ency is in@@ appropriate .
britain , it seems , is now at the height of a mes@@ ol@@ the@@ li@@ om ep@@ ide@@ mic .
there are more fat@@ alities from mes@@ o@@ the@@ li@@ om here than in any other country in the world .
with 2,@@ 500 deaths per year , twice as many people die from this disease as in road accidents .
annual figures of the fat@@ alities of the mes@@ o@@ the@@ li@@ om@@ a since 1980 and anticip@@ ated future deaths in the uk
the reason we have now seen the le@@ th@@ al effects , although as@@ be@@ sto@@ s has been illegal for years ( in 1999 all types of as@@ be@@ sto@@ s were banned ) , is that a mes@@ o@@ the@@ li@@ om is only developing after decades .
and the s@@ cour@@ ge of mes@@ o@@ the@@ li@@ om is not due to former construction workers .
as@@ be@@ sto@@ s was , and is often still present , in the houses in which we live , the offices in which we work , the schools where we learn and the shops in which we shop .
and therefore mes@@ o@@ the@@ li@@ om knows no class barriers , financial limits , profes@@ sions or age .
the privileged bas@@ tions , from the elegant department stores in london to private schools , are not a shel@@ ter .
the parliament buildings are contam@@ inated with as@@ be@@ sto@@ s .
in hospit@@ als , where we are healthy , too , there are already many people who are starting to use this dead@@ ly car@@ cin@@ o@@ gen@@ ic gen@@ e .
andre@@ w law@@ son was not old .
nor was he a pl@@ um@@ ber .
he did indeed find it difficult to imagine where he might be dealing with as@@ be@@ sto@@ s .
then he found out .
&quot; it looks like the tun@@ n@@ eling on the gu@@ y &apos;s ho@@ spi@@ tal , where i have been for six years , is a very interesting experience .
all - students , nur@@ ses , doctors and pa@@ st@@ ors - use the tunnel .
one won@@ ders how many of my con@@ tempor@@ aries will suffer from the same disease ?
unfortunately , he was able to answer that question at least in part .
&quot; of the four doctors who were on gu@@ y &apos;s hospital , the number of patients in the last five years was about 5 % .
how many of us will still be ill ?
andre@@ w law@@ son was born in the age of 48 .
when he was killed on 17 february of this year , he was 55 .
this was an un@@ usually long survival time .
fif@@ ty per cent of all mes@@ o@@ the@@ li@@ o@@ id diseases die within 8 months of diagno@@ sis .
the disease always ends fat@@ ally .
we can therefore only repeat law@@ son &apos;s question : &apos; how many of us will still be ill ? &apos;
the uk &apos;s leading expert on mes@@ o@@ the@@ li@@ om , professor ju@@ lian pe@@ to , assum@@ es that between 18@@ 70 and 20@@ 50 , when as@@ be@@ sto@@ s ide@@ als were in the uk , it would probably be a hal@@ t .
most of them have no idea at the moment that they will die like this .

a quick look at the files of the courts to which the persons concerned often referred for damages claims shows how far the intellectual property s@@ cour@@ ge of the mes@@ o@@ the@@ li@@ om is already widespread .
in june this year marks &amp; sp@@ enc@@ er , for example , ad@@ mitted that jan@@ ice was neglig@@ ently exposed to as@@ be@@ sto@@ s .
she worked for nine years for the chain , from 197@@ 8 to 198@@ 7 , and was responsible for the gar@@ ment department at two locations - one of which is the flag@@ ship store in ox@@ ford street .
m@@ r@@ s. allen was only 18 years old when she started her activity at m &amp; s .
now she has two children in the tw@@ en@@ ties .
&quot; before this thing , &quot; she says , &quot; i had never heard of mes@@ o@@ the@@ li@@ om , i did not even know anything about as@@ be@@ sto@@ s .
i never thought that this would affect me .
there are few people who know a lot about as@@ be@@ sto@@ s .
the fact is that the term as@@ be@@ sto@@ s does not con@@ fine itself to a substance , but to a group of six min@@ er@@ als .
the name deri@@ ves from the word &quot; as@@ be@@ sti@@ form &quot; , a description of the fi@@ bre structure that makes the fab@@ ric resistant and flexible .
three of the six were used in the construction industry .
ch@@ ry@@ so@@ tile , also known as white as@@ be@@ sto@@ s , is by far the most common form of as@@ be@@ sto@@ s found in buildings today .
it is designed for roof@@ ing , floor tiles , pi@@ pe sol@@ ations , bo@@ il@@ er@@ is@@ ations , even for bra@@ ke co@@ ver@@ ings in cars .
it is less fat@@ al than other forms of as@@ be@@ sto@@ s , but it is still regarded by the eu and the who as &apos; great health risk &apos; with possible death .
but the brown as@@ be@@ sto@@ s ( am@@ o@@ sit ) and the blue as@@ be@@ sto@@ s ( cro@@ ky@@ dol@@ ith ) are more dangerous .
britain was once the world ’ s largest im@@ porter of brown as@@ be@@ sto@@ s , and experts susp@@ ect that &quot; it has clear but indirect evidence that this is a major reason for the uni@@ qu@@ ely high mes@@ o@@ the@@ li@@ om@@ ation rates . &quot;
a mark &amp; sp@@ enc@@ er employee was registered in the flag@@ ship store in ox@@ ford street , london , as@@ be@@ sto@@ s exposed al@@ am@@ y to al@@ am@@ y .
jan@@ ice allen may not have proven to be a typical mes@@ o@@ the@@ li@@ om@@ op@@ er , but the work of ju@@ lian pe@@ to suggests that the truth is not its story .
he has presented a study by the stakeholders , which shows that &apos; a significant proportion of the mes@@ o@@ the@@ li@@ om@@ es are affected without known inter@@ ru@@ ption by work or in the house probably by as@@ be@@ sto@@ s contact in the environment &apos; .
much of these contacts , he says , are based on &quot; normal use and aging &quot; of our buildings .
it looks as if no one can assume that they are safe .
a report by go@@ d@@ d@@ ard consulting , which describes the palace of west@@ min@@ ster , shows how people can also live in the heart of the government , un@@ kno@@ w@@ ingly exposed to the substance .
in 2009 , go@@ d@@ d@@ ard reported that service p@@ acks and pipel@@ ines were behind the committee rooms of parliament with as@@ be@@ sto@@ s , whose deaths were fat@@ al due to something as harm@@ less as the &apos; strong air movements &apos; .
members of parliament are often accused of taking care of their own interests , but here it seems that they are not doing the opposite .
while the director@@ ate of the parliamentary labour service insi@@ sted that the west@@ min@@ ster palace should be a &apos; clean health certificate &apos; , it is now un@@ den@@ i@@ able that 1 billion £ of work is spent over several years .
the go@@ d@@ d@@ ard report also pointed out that &apos; the existence of as@@ be@@ sto@@ s cannot be regulated in accordance with the relevant provisions &apos; .
no one can know whether this mis@@ management will cost lives .
all you can do now is wait .
a person who has never exactly determined contact with as@@ be@@ sto@@ s is gra@@ ham ab@@ bot@@ t , a general practi@@ tion@@ er .
as andre@@ w law@@ son susp@@ ects , the 50@@ -@@ year-@@ old ab@@ bot@@ t , that he would be exposed to as@@ be@@ sto@@ s during his work in hospit@@ als .
&quot; i worked in a hospital where as@@ be@@ sto@@ s complaints were posi@@ tively decided , &quot; he says , &quot; but i can not do it in my case .
it is so difficult to remember all the places where you worked , and to the data .
what he remember very well is the day in early december 2009 , when he had such a fe@@ ver .
he was 45 and led an operation just late in the evening .
suddenly i had sha@@ ken .
it happened suddenly .
i felt hor@@ ri@@ ble .
i thought that the journey home was no longer a job .
as a doctor , ab@@ bot@@ t knew that the pain of the ch@@ est co@@ at , the skin around his lun@@ gs , was sti@@ r@@ ring .
but , like jan@@ ice allen , he had no reason to susp@@ ect a mes@@ o@@ the@@ li@@ om .
he did not go to work for a month .
amaz@@ ingly , doctors made x-@@ ray pictures of his bre@@ ast and put ple@@ ur@@ a@@ k@@ ath@@ e@@ ther on to extr@@ act liquid from the lun@@ gs and to work in the laboratory .
his complaints , however , remained un@@ diagno@@ sed .
his health improved slowly , and he returned to his job .
from time to time , however , the symp@@ t@@ oms returned , often after sporting activity and sti@@ ff at@@ titu@@ des .
in 2011 , a patient ab@@ bot@@ t with similar symp@@ t@@ oms came to his practice and was later diagno@@ sed with mes@@ o@@ the@@ li@@ om .
but also now , ab@@ bot@@ t did not combine this with his own case .
after all , his patient was a few decades older and had worked directly with as@@ be@@ sto@@ s .
the connection in that case was clear .
in september 2011 , ab@@ bot@@ t ’ s condition deterior@@ ated again , and his general practi@@ tion@@ er brought his c@@ t sc@@ ans and x-@@ ray images to a group of experts .
in december 2011 , exactly two years after ab@@ bot@@ t first became ill , he was able to make a decision on the sony er@@ ic@@ s@@ son s@@ 7@@ 20 , equipped with a camera .
i am an optim@@ ist .
i usually go on , &quot; he says .
to be honest , i had not been so concerned about it .
but rac@@ hel , my wife , was wor@@ ried .
the result of bi@@ op@@ sy was in the week between christmas and new year : &quot; i was told that there was mes@@ o@@ the@@ li@@ om . &quot;
gra@@ ham ab@@ bot@@ t : diagno@@ sis of mes@@ o@@ the@@ li@@ om
suddenly , ab@@ bot@@ t had appoin@@ t@@ ments with mac@@ mill@@ an nur@@ ses , one of whom recommended that he take a law@@ yer , and that he should not be allowed to do so .
only now did he understand the extent of the ep@@ ide@@ mic .
&quot; it turned out that as@@ be@@ sto@@ s was very common , especially in large public buildings where pi@@ pes were often filled with as@@ be@@ sto@@ s , &quot; he says .
the people who are exposed to as@@ be@@ sto@@ s in these buildings are now suffering .
and so mes@@ o@@ the@@ li@@ om now meets younger people who are not working in the typical profes@@ sions .
the most dangerous pi@@ pes with as@@ be@@ sto@@ s insul@@ ation in hospit@@ als were below the earth , so patients were probably not exposed to the substance .
but many employees who work in pede@@ strian tun@@ nels from one building to another ( such as andre@@ w law@@ son ) or in underground areas of can@@ teen a@@ dian ( such as gra@@ ham ab@@ bot@@ t often did ) , are not able to do so .
it is clear that , over several decades after the war , hospit@@ als may have been life@@ -@@ saving for patients , but they have been life@@ -@@ threat@@ ening for the doctors who treat them .
it is still being removed today .
students presented their bun@@ sen@@ bren@@ ner on as@@ be@@ sto@@ s mat@@ s .
it does not just concern hospit@@ als .
as@@ be@@ sto@@ s was developed because of its fab@@ ulous insul@@ ating properties and fl@@ ame re@@ tar@@ d@@ ants in offices , shops , libraries and city h@@ alls .
schools are also involved .
indeed , many people probably have the first as@@ be@@ sto@@ s contact in the class@@ room .
throughout the country , in thousands of hours of chem@@ i@@ stry , students have their bun@@ sen@@ bren@@ ner dis@@ ks placed on as@@ be@@ sto@@ s mat@@ s .
on websites as@@ be@@ sto@@ s is now frequently addressed in schools .
and so inno@@ cent objects have been found in our homes , such as flo@@ oring or sh@@ ing@@ le blan@@ kets , by default .
&quot; it is an industrial po@@ ison that is contained in much of our property , &quot; says andre@@ w mor@@ gan , law@@ yer , who is andre@@ w law@@ son in his trial against gu@@ y &apos;@@ s-@@ ho@@ sp@@ ital .
in one case , the only contact that was made to a woman concerned was to demo@@ lish a sh@@ ed in the 197@@ 0s .
so watch out for your sh@@ ell@@ s .
the effects of diagno@@ sis , and knowing that the disease is incur@@ able , is immen@@ se .
&quot; it takes a while to process it , &quot; says gra@@ ham ab@@ bot@@ t .
i went back to work and tried to continue , but i realized that i was not on the focus .
i was in practice for two weeks .
then i knew that i would go and take care of myself .
well , i will not be able to experience another christmas .
the most difficult aspect was the change of perspective from the position of a doctor to that of a patient .
how countless patients before him he re@@ members how overwhel@@ med he is by all the information he has been able to get .
&quot; it was very difficult to include all of this , &quot; he says .
&quot; i asked my doctor &quot; how long do i have ? &quot;
and i was given about 12 months .
i remember having thought that &quot; well , i &apos;m going to not have another christmas party , i &apos;ll be watching .
that was then . &apos;
mes@@ o@@ the@@ li@@ om is particularly insi@@ di@@ ous because it is our life preser@@ vation mechanism - the bre@@ a@@ thing itself - that is causing fat@@ al cancer .
most cases of mes@@ o@@ the@@ li@@ om@@ a are caused by as@@ be@@ sto@@ s contact .
as@@ be@@ sto@@ s is made up of small@@ est fi@@ b@@ res .
when as@@ be@@ sto@@ s is un@@ le@@ ash@@ ed and the fi@@ b@@ res are in@@ hal@@ ed , they can be found in the ch@@ est skin , the skin around the lun@@ gs .
as@@ be@@ sto@@ s fi@@ b@@ res ir@@ rit@@ ate the bre@@ ast skin and can tri@@ gger cell mu@@ tations .
&quot; the problem ar@@ ises with the in@@ hal@@ ed con@@ i@@ fer@@ ous fi@@ b@@ res , &quot; says professor tom tre@@ as@@ ure , a hear@@ t-@@ thro@@ at specialist .
it is precisely the hospital that andre@@ w law@@ son susp@@ ects will be able to exposed to as@@ be@@ sto@@ s that is now ir@@ on@@ ically a leading centre for the treatment of mes@@ o@@ the@@ li@@ om@@ a .
treas@@ ure knew law@@ son and treated the people of the island , who probably also had to be in hospital during their training .
once the as@@ be@@ sto@@ s nee@@ d@@ les reach the l@@ ung tissu@@ e , says treas@@ ure , &quot; they will be taken from the resp@@ ir@@ atory process to the edge , where the skin is .
by its very nature , it is inv@@ a@@ sive from the outset .
the usual options for other can@@ c@@ ers work in mes@@ o@@ the@@ li@@ om not so well .
the effectiveness of an operation is , for example , highly controversial .
some say that it is worth trying .
treas@@ ure den@@ ies this .
&quot; you can &apos;t remove the ch@@ est co@@ at , &quot; he says .
they do not get around with the k@@ ni@@ fe .
meanwhile , cancer spe@@ aks &quot; on chem@@ other@@ ap@@ y &quot; not very well , &quot; the &quot; effect &quot; but does not he@@ al .
&quot; sometimes there are long-term survi@@ v@@ ors , &quot; says treas@@ ure .
but in the end they all die .
fortunately , some patients actually live long , much longer than expected .
the author ste@@ ph@@ en j@@ ay g@@ ould died 20 years after the diagno@@ sis .
two and a half years after his own diagno@@ sis , gra@@ ham ab@@ bot@@ t is still fighting .
after cont@@ acting mes@@ o@@ the@@ li@@ om , ab@@ bot@@ t came into contact with andre@@ w law@@ son , who was diagno@@ sed with a one-@@ man sur@@ ge@@ on and coun@@ sel@@ ing office four years after his diagno@@ sis .
&quot; hel@@ lo , cancer centre , &quot; he stood up for calls while he was happy .
&quot; he was very positive , &quot; says ab@@ bot@@ t .
he had made his diagno@@ sis 4 years earlier and was still very active .
the first group of companies to be established was the ab@@ bot@@ t group , which had been offering six chem@@ other@@ ap@@ y cy@@ cles , which would probably only last four months and would probably only extend its life by one month .
&quot; i was desper@@ ate , &quot; he says .
i wanted to give up .
law@@ son managed to &quot; make things in a slightly more positive light &quot; , however .
after consulting several doctors , ab@@ bot@@ t decided to continue his treatment with prof@@ . lo@@ ic lan@@ g-@@ la@@ z@@ dun@@ ski , her@@ z-@@ thor@@ a@@ x specialist at the gu@@ y &apos;s .
&quot; we had an advantage by not being able to be further re@@ directed , i just called and got an appointment , &quot; says gra@@ ham .
a normal patient would receive a re@@ ferr@@ al and would be waiting for the treatment to be approved .
money is crucial for mes@@ o@@ the@@ li@@ om@@ -@@ suff@@ e@@ rers to obtain the best available therap@@ ies .
but when these treatments eventually fail , they are likely to be a source of another financial concern - about the future of families , about the future of families they leave behind .
and so they turn to the courts in the hope of compensation .
andre@@ w law@@ son cont@@ acted andre@@ w mor@@ gan of field fish@@ er watch .
&quot; it has been known since 18@@ 98 that as@@ be@@ sto@@ s is extremely dangerous for health , &quot; says mor@@ gan .
but what happened in the 196@@ 0s was that we realized that the world was also very low .
and here the neglig@@ ence of companies began to play a role .
andre@@ w law@@ son and gu@@ y &apos;s hospital put their case to the end , but it was not what mor@@ gan had called a &quot; full compensation &quot; .
after the investigation into his death , a gu@@ y &apos;s spo@@ kes@@ man confirmed that &quot; the as@@ be@@ sto@@ s fi@@ b@@ res in the affected cel@@ lar area were not removed in the 199@@ 0s . &quot;
this was a very late event for andre@@ w law@@ son .
how to remove as@@ be@@ sto@@ s
indeed , it is not easy for people with a mes@@ o@@ the@@ li@@ om to seek compensation to be confron@@ ted with a huge problem , namely the dead@@ ly as@@ be@@ sto@@ s contact between a company or a work@@ place - usually decades after the events .
many of their former employers have been sold or closed .
insurance documents may be lost .
and those who oppose claims know that the us is not the time to do so , but certainly not the pla@@ in@@ ti@@ ffs .
in response to this , there have been significant new legislation this year that has allowed people affected by mes@@ o@@ the@@ li@@ om to receive compensation .
the law has a patent system promoted by the insurance industry of £ 3@@ 50 million for all who are to be diagno@@ sed after july 2012 , a contact that is not yet available to anyone .
in these cases , pla@@ in@@ ti@@ ffs receive 80 % of what a court can do in a normal compensation process - say , 1@@ 20@@ ,000 £ .
about 300 successful applications for the programme are expected to be submitted ann@@ ually .
andre@@ w mor@@ gan , like so many people affected by the mes@@ o@@ the@@ li@@ om , thin@@ ks that £ 3@@ 50 million is a &quot; very good job &quot; for the insurance industry .
&quot; this is a deal for insu@@ rers , &quot; he says , and suggests that the insurance industry is a global deal .
mi@@ ke pen@@ ning , who was then working and pension ministers , also ad@@ mitted that the law &quot; not perfect &quot; was .
but both pen@@ ning and mor@@ gan ad@@ mitted that , with seven deaths on a daily basis , rapid action is needed .
&quot; people suffer so much and need help today , &quot; said pen@@ ning during the second hearing of the mes@@ o@@ the@@ li@@ om law in december last year .
at that time , gra@@ ham ab@@ bot@@ t had been in the hands of prof@@ . lo@@ ic lan@@ g-@@ la@@ z@@ dun@@ ski for 19 months .
after their initial discussions , lan@@ g-@@ la@@ z@@ dun@@ ski recommended an operation that , unlike tom@@ sk tre@@ ach@@ ur@@ e , would have a positive effect .
this was done by radiation therapy and chem@@ other@@ ap@@ y - a tri@@ ple therapy .
ab@@ bot@@ t felt stronger .
&quot; this is of course the most important , &quot; says ab@@ bot@@ t .
this is evident time and again in patients .
there is something that will keep you going .
if you give up , you will get worse very quickly .
gra@@ ham ab@@ bot@@ t under@@ went the operation in march 2012 .
at the end of august , he had the last of the six chem@@ other@@ ap@@ y cy@@ cles behind him .
the following year , the company was awarded the &quot; best of the year &quot; award .
then in march 20@@ 14 i had a s@@ can .
there were several cancer spots around my bre@@ ast .
i have just been 50 .
this is not life@@ -@@ threat@@ ening .
this is a life@@ -@@ ending exercise .
again , ab@@ bot@@ t under@@ went six chem@@ other@@ ap@@ y cy@@ cles .
now there is no longer a tr@@ ace of t@@ um@@ ours .
but the process is physi@@ cally and ment@@ ally very ex@@ hau@@ sting .
they must think of practical things - about money , if i am no longer , for example , or my wife , show how to set the bo@@ iling time works .
if you receive bad news , you will be negative .
they must look to the future .
as the father of el@@ lie , 16 , and tam@@ s@@ in , 14 , this is not always easy .
&quot; this is difficult for parents , &quot; he says .
it is hard to know what to say and how much .
when i received my first diagno@@ sis , i told my girls that i had a disease with which i would not grow old .
they re@@ acted in very different ways .
tam@@ s@@ in is very soci@@ able and im@@ patient .
she told her to her friends and we soon got a lot of calls .
el@@ lie was more cau@@ tious .
she did not say much .
such talks are something that affects all cancer patients .
but for mes@@ o@@ the@@ li@@ o@@ logi@@ an diseases such talks have not been driven by hope , not by a tr@@ ace of hope for survival .
the disease ( as well as eventually also for ste@@ ph@@ en j@@ ay g@@ ould ) brings a gri@@ m security .

china is ref@@ using hong kong to be entitled to government elections , demonstr@@ ators swe@@ ar re@@ tali@@ ation , and re@@ tali@@ ation .
on sunday , despite the increasing number of calls for democratic reforms , the chinese parliament decided against nom@@ in@@ ating candidates for the 20@@ 17 elections by the hong kong elec@@ tor@@ ate .
this is probably the most likely way of fu@@ elling the long-@@ announced pro@@ tests in hong kong ’ s business district , while activi@@ sts are bloc@@ king planning and mobil@@ isation within hours of the announcement .
the decision of the people ’ s congress in china basically allows communist leaders to ignore all non-@@ pe@@ king@@ -@@ loy@@ al candidates .
&quot; this is not un@@ expected , but it makes us an@@ gr@@ y , &quot; said right-@@ wing expert em@@ ily la@@ u , chairman of the democratic party .
that is not what beijing had promised .
the people of hong kong have been lied to .
and it is clear that we are dealing with an author@@ itarian regime .
in defending china ’ s decision , li fe@@ i , depu@@ ty secretary general of the standing committee of the national people ’ s congress , said that the approval of public nom@@ inations in the hong kong government was too &quot; cha@@ otic &quot; .
since 1997 , when britain lost control of hong kong , the chinese have been for@@ given for promising to leave the inhabitants of hong kong to take over the government from 20@@ 17 .
china ’ s leaders presented sunday ’ s decision as a democratic break@@ through , because it gave hong kong citizens direct voting rights , but the decision also makes it clear that china ’ s leaders are not going to change the process through a ti@@ gh@@ tly controlled beijing mini-@@ .
a new clause also states that candidates should only be &apos; with love for the country and love for hong kong &apos; .
the decision follows a summer in which some of the largest and most public@@ -@@ spi@@ ri@@ ted pro@@ tests in hong kong have been taking place for a number of years .
behind the pro@@ democratic campaign in hong kong is the oc@@ cu@@ p@@ y central movement with love and peace , whose organiz@@ ers have been threatened with a further increase in the financial district .
on sunday evening , in a few hours &apos; time , hundreds of people from occup@@ ations had been arrested and sent@@ enced to death by the police and the police in front of the hong kong headquarters .
the organiz@@ ers said at the demonstration that their movement needed a new stage of civil dis@@ o@@ be@@ di@@ ence and that they would be pro@@ testing in the coming weeks .
they did not give any details on this , however , apparently to avoid problems with the authorities .
in an online communication , the organiz@@ ers said that the movement &quot; the occupation of the central district only as a last resort to consider , a campaign that was only possible if the central district is fully integrated into the system .
sorry , we have to say that all the opportunities for dialogue have been exhaus@@ ted today and the occupation of the central district has definitely taken place .
the hong kong authorities have been focusing for days on the beijing announcement that they will be meeting the beijing conference on sunday .
the un@@ rest is caused by the feeling of many in hong kong that they are slowly losing control of their city .
the influ@@ x of people from main@@ land increases competition for products and services .
moreover , there is growing fear that hong kong ’ s values of democracy and freedom of speech will be under@@ min@@ ed by growing pressure from beijing .
some cri@@ tici@@ zed the demonstra@@ tions of the occup@@ y centr@@ al movement , as they were threat@@ ening the business - the li@@ fel@@ ine of hong kong .
&quot; the pro@@ tests they talk about could have major economic damage , depending on how many people are involved and how long they are going to last , &quot; said right-@@ wing expert reg@@ ine i@@ p , who was driving the movement for a long time .
we do not want to raise any fears that hong kong will get out of hand .
this impression is bad for investment .
the state@@ -@@ controlled media in china also recently reported about the democratic activi@@ sts in hong kong as being viewed by western powers .
this summer , activi@@ sts organised an un@@ official referendum on the right to vote , involving 7@@ 8@@ 0,000 people - more than one fifth of the elec@@ tor@@ ate in hong kong .
in july , tens of thousands took part in one of the largest democracy demonstra@@ tions in the region ’ s history .
the tradition of school leaving b@@ alls in the us is now being transferred to universities where fres@@ h@@ men perform with the private aircraft .
we are looking forward to being able to respond to this demand and to the first luxury uk travel service for students of today .
to make a particularly impressive performance at the university , the company also offers transport options such as private aircraft , roll@@ s-@@ roy@@ ce ph@@ an@@ tom , ast@@ on mar@@ ten or m@@ cla@@ ren p@@ 1 .
mr ste@@ w@@ art also stated that the service is a security area .
this service is an ideal alternative for students who would otherwise have to leave their habit@@ ats in a danger@@ ously over@@ loaded car through the country .
together with our new vi@@ f options , we look forward to making sure that the students get to know the university with a minimum of effort and maximum efficiency .
a company spo@@ kes@@ man said that no new book@@ ings have been made , as the service has only just been introduced , but added that the &quot; students will not be able to use the service in the next few weeks &quot; .
the company also announced that , despite tu@@ ition fees , it had increased from £ 9@@ ,000 per year to a market for this offer .
students today differ in their expectations and requirements from students 10 years ago , 20 , 30 or 40 years ago - it is more important than ever to get a great first impression and to be able to do exactly that with vi@@ f .
the national student union critic@@ ised service as being out of the question .
me@@ gan dun@@ n , vice president of the n@@ us for higher education said : &quot; this offer seems to be completely separate from the life of most students .
many students who started their studies this month face a crisis in the cost of living , as the available financial assistance in the form of loans and grants is insufficient .
fem@@ ini@@ sts cri@@ tici@@ ze race issues and police behavior after fer@@ g@@ us@@ on

the participants raised their hands and san@@ g , &quot; hands high , not sho@@ ot , &quot; while they were waiting for the fun@@ eral .
after two weeks of pro@@ tests in fer@@ g@@ us@@ on , mo , because of the sho@@ oting of the un@@ armed te@@ en@@ ager michael brown , the blo@@ gger noticed mil@@ o@@ se@@ vic &apos;s death .

compared to the answers given by black women shortly after the sho@@ ts of 9 august , personal es@@ says with tit@@ les such as &quot; thoughts to fer@@ g@@ us@@ on by a white woman &quot; and &quot; fem@@ in@@ ism is not only about op@@ pression .
but for pe@@ re@@ z , this was an important change .
&quot; i do not believe that fem@@ in@@ ism can find many people who know and enjoy privile@@ ges on such high-@@ class forms .
people felt ur@@ ged to do something about the inci@@ dents .
it is characteristic of the crisis we are experiencing and because the situation in fer@@ g@@ us@@ on is so eth@@ n@@ ici@@ zed that it does not need to express it .
for english professor k@@ ori@@ th@@ a mit@@ ch@@ ell of o@@ hi@@ o state university , he brought fer@@ g@@ us@@ on ’ s problems to light that black americans face every day , which are not considered &quot; women &apos;s the@@ ories &quot; .
&quot; i can do something fun@@ ny on fac@@ e@@ book about me and my partner and get 150 li@@ kes from anywhere , &quot; said mit@@ ch@@ ell .
if i post something about how colo@@ red in your own country are under sie@@ ge , the silence of e@@ ars is not the only thing i can hear .
&quot; how can it be safe for women to talk publicly about a relationship , but not about public security ? &quot; she asked .
for black women like mit@@ ch@@ ell , the race , sex and sex@@ u@@ ality in the history of the us , there is no dic@@ ho@@ tom@@ y between race and sexual orientation .
for them , black women have not had the luxury of keeping the issues clean ; they live every day in the combined reality .
while white women are now discussing race and gender issues in fem@@ in@@ ist main@@ stream cir@@ cles , the ang@@ ela hat@@ ter@@ y says , professor of r@@ aci@@ al and gender research , at geor@@ ge ma@@ son university .
&quot; between 18@@ 65 and 18@@ 90 , at least 10@@ ,000 black men were gel@@ y@@ n@@ cht and the justi@@ fication was almost always the ra@@ pe of a white woman , &quot; said h@@ at@@ ry .
white women have had to be involved in history in order to justify ly@@ n@@ ch@@ k@@ ill@@ ings .
for h@@ att@@ ory , the white and black women split at the point where white figh@@ ters were fighting for women ’ s electoral law , such as sus@@ an b@@ . an@@ th@@ ony , in the late 19@@ 00@@ s analy@@ zed the country and analy@@ zed it .
&quot; they decided to op@@ t for women &apos;s electoral rights , and the right to vote for black should come later , &quot; said h@@ att@@ ory .
if you remember such things , you are power@@ fully aware of why women in colour do not trust white women .
we did not do our job well .
we have never helped black women to protect their hus@@ bands and s@@ ons .
even after women had the right to vote in 19@@ 20 , it took another decade for white women to resi@@ st ly@@ n@@ ch in the association .
the group was established almost 40 years after the original request for assistance from black women , says mit@@ ch@@ ell .
for mit@@ ch@@ ell , the flo@@ od of white fem@@ in@@ ist re@@ actions to the issues raised by fer@@ g@@ us@@ on - police behaviour , r@@ aci@@ al discrimination - is a mirror of the time when white fem@@ ini@@ sts were caught &quot; cap@@ turing &quot; .
&quot; would it not be great if the activi@@ sts who have such traditional fem@@ in@@ ist platforms had the right to education a child ?
fem@@ ini@@ sts of the second generation , who have been re@@ producing their care@@ ers in the struggle for re@@ productive rights and access to contrac@@ ep@@ tive means , are now trying to understand what that means .
the famous white fem@@ in@@ ist acti@@ vis@@ t gl@@ oria ste@@ iner went to the streets two weeks after the sho@@ oting of michael brown .
&quot; i hope that women who have a different but parallel reason to be a member of the body are not exposed to this risk - and opinions on rapid reaction , which is not the case in public surve@@ ys - will understand the changes .
although ste@@ iner is in favour of more inter@@ sec@@ tional fem@@ in@@ ism , in which race as well as gender issues are addressed , some of her comments on r@@ aci@@ al issues are not yet hidden in america .
christ@@ ina som@@ mer , resear@@ cher at the american enterprise institute and author of &quot; who st@@ ol@@ e fem@@ in@@ ism ? &quot; said to her the pe@@ o@@ po@@ le that young men in the united states , especially young farmers .
there are now hundreds of special programmes for girls and young women , but almost nothing for bo@@ ys .
but when the white house recently launched a small program , my brother &apos;s ke@@ eper , it put in order to protect vulnerable young black and h@@ is@@ pan@@ ic men , there were an@@ no@@ ying re@@ actions from many fem@@ ini@@ sts , including women .
the relationship between the police and the black community is not the only problem that has come to the fore in main@@ stream fem@@ in@@ ism .
after the us border police have killed almost 6@@ 3@@ ,000 un@@ accompanied min@@ ors on the country ’ s sou@@ th@@ west border this year , the issue of immigration reform is also returning to the surface - this time as a women ’ s issue .
andre@@ a mer@@ c@@ ado , co-@@ chairman of we bel@@ ong together , an organization that provides women with a job in immigration reform , said that for a new look at the subject , it is essential to have women as an essential issue .
&quot; they speak for themselves , &quot; mer@@ c@@ ado said .
if the vast majority of working vis@@ as are sent to male immigrants , women , who are accompan@@ ying them , are in a position where they are responsible for domestic violence and exploitation .
&quot; these stories find a sustainable contribution to women &apos;s organisations , &quot; she said .
&quot; sch@@ we@@ in@@ e-@@ haus &quot; in ip@@ sw@@ ich is for sale in ip@@ sw@@ ich .
the image of a house for sale was removed by real estate agents when it became clear that there was a large pi@@ g that it could easily be made in the living room .
the de@@ t@@ ached house has one bedroom , is located on a private street in ip@@ sw@@ ich and is offered for 1@@ 20@@ ,000 £ .
the details included a picture of the living room of the house - including a pi@@ g .
real estate agents conn@@ ell@@ s said that the pi@@ g on the photo is the pet of the owner .
&quot; the photo was er@@ ron@@ e@@ ously published and was removed &quot; said a spo@@ kes@@ man of the company .
the hotel ’ s exposure described conn@@ ell@@ s as the former meeting house as a “ unique ” simple family house .
although the bro@@ ker has removed the image from the website , it still appears on advertising material .
the sale of homes caused interest in the social media when some asked whether the pi@@ g was in the purchase price .
the s@@ w city of har@@ ve@@ y is home to a new million dollar after lo@@ t@@ tery win .
a har@@ ve@@ y lo@@ t@@ tery player is scheduled to be released this month .
the search for a new mil@@ li@@ on@@ air@@ e in the sou@@ th@@ west of per@@ th is on , with a happy winner who has left the lo@@ t@@ tery on saturday almost $ 1.@@ 1 million .
a newspaper ki@@ os@@ k in har@@ ve@@ y moved for the second time in five years to the jack@@ pot in drawing the first division , after 1 million $ in november 2009 .
the lu@@ cky winner must still report .
the sho@@ p@@ ke@@ eper ste@@ ve forward said that the profit is a source of con@@ vers@@ ation in the small town in the sou@@ th@@ west of per@@ th .
the city talks about nothing else , and all are quite ex@@ ci@@ ted .
we thought that such a profit could come into being .
eight wa winners have won pri@@ zes in the first division last month , a char@@ ge@@ able deal for a few happy weeks for the players in the state .
last week , a can@@ ning val@@ e player was one of the five mil@@ li@@ on@@ ai@@ res in august , after a couple from bel@@ mon@@ t had just received the me@@ ga win of $ 7.@@ 5 million a few weeks earlier .
the winning couple had been playing for twenty years and said that the profit allows you to travel around the world and buy a new house .
the mil@@ li@@ on@@ air@@ e from har@@ ve@@ y is the 5@@ 9@@ th winner of the first division in the wa this year , with a total of almost $ 85 million .
leon@@ id@@ as asked for the gla@@ di@@ at@@ ori@@ um arena in the city .
not only the gla@@ di@@ ators were on the an@@ k@@ le low in the mat@@ sch at the first r@@ hin@@ eland roman day in the am@@ us@@ ement park .
but the attr@@ action of the event was strong enough to be able to attract more than 1000 visitors yesterday who were watching the rain sho@@ wers and the autumn cold .
there was a color@@ ful set of representa@@ tions , performances , games , exhi@@ bits and information about the time of the roman@@ s and their importance to the r@@ hin@@ eland .
the main attr@@ action of the day was undoubtedly the mar@@ ti@@ alistic figh@@ ter force of the gla@@ di@@ ator school &quot; am@@ or mor@@ tis &quot; , which was able to make use of every ra@@ iny break to live with soft sand .
gla@@ di@@ at@@ or@@ ist &quot; leon@@ id@@ as &quot; proved to be a hum@@ or@@ ous and kno@@ wled@@ ge@@ able pres@@ enter and sent his men to the ring to the her@@ o@@ ic two-@@ way battle in various gla@@ di@@ ator eng@@ at@@ ors .
first , the &quot; pro@@ voca@@ te@@ urs &quot; were in turn with a rec@@ tan@@ g@@ le shi@@ eld and short s@@ word as well as le@@ g rail on the left le@@ g and arm rail on the right arm .
the &quot; es@@ se@@ d@@ ari@@ i &quot; followed with bre@@ ast shi@@ eld , short s@@ word and thro@@ wing lan@@ ze , and iron gla@@ di@@ ator hel@@ met , leg@@ - and arm hel@@ met .
the performance of the &quot; reti@@ rement age &quot; was particularly impressive , with a roll of thro@@ ws , tri@@ ple and dol@@ ch against the &quot; sec@@ ut@@ or &quot; and followed a short fight with the bur@@ sch@@ er .
the s@@ words of the s@@ words cl@@ ash me@@ tal@@ lic , the shi@@ el@@ ds sh@@ em@@ ales and the thro@@ wing lan@@ ces flo@@ wn sur@@ rep@@ ti@@ ously through the arena that is going to be afraid for the health of the gla@@ di@@ ans .
but on that one had to wait the imposing &quot; sum@@ ma ru@@ d@@ is &quot; , the mus@@ cu@@ lar re@@ fe@@ ree , an always atten@@ tive eye .
&quot; we wanted to re@@ discover the everyday life of rome and to re@@ discover the culture of roman times &quot; , said lo@@ ren@@ z e@@ us@@ k@@ ir@@ chen , chairman of the &quot; friends of the roman society &quot; .
after two years of preparation , the theme park became a &quot; opport@@ un@@ istic &quot; for a day , a roman city .
after all , the roman@@ s not only fought war and con@@ quest in our region , but also the roman culture and numerous monuments that we still adm@@ ire today .
the remains of this were also to be seen at the roman day , such as &quot; aqu@@ educ@@ t mar@@ ble &quot; from the ele@@ ven metr@@ e high and 1,@@ 400 meters long roman canal bridge , which was once built in v@@ ü@@ tel@@ berg .
the fron@@ tin@@ us company presented the water and energy supply once and now , and managing director pe@@ tra fr@@ ic@@ ke knew : &quot; we are still using the internet today to gain advantage from the knowledge of then &quot; .
this also confir@@ ms diplom@@ -@@ surve@@ y@@ or r@@ alp@@ h sa@@ ints of the &quot; engine@@ er@@ te@@ am@@ z@@ two &quot; from rhe@@ in@@ bach , the measurement instruments of the roman@@ s such as ch@@ or@@ ob@@ at , gro@@ ma or di@@ op@@ tra .
the roman@@ es@@ que villa in blan@@ ken@@ heim presented s@@ ket@@ ches and models of exc@@ av@@ ations an@@ no 18@@ 94 and br@@ ic@@ ks from the original hypo@@ ca@@ ste , the hot lu@@ br@@ ic@@ ation , the old one .
the foot@@ prin@@ ts , which are taken by wol@@ f and fu@@ ch@@ s two mill@@ en@@ nia ago in the foot@@ steps of cla@@ y , were also impressive before they bur@@ ned .
in 2011 , the land@@ mark management office had a number of outstanding remains of a roman villa in the industrial park of nor@@ d in r@@ hin@@ bach .
they have built f@@ encing walls of an economic building with a dar@@ r@@ age for dr@@ ying cere@@ als and for mo@@ wing .
the building probably belong@@ ed to a villa rus@@ tic@@ a , an agricultural estate , explained the archae@@ o@@ log@@ ist dr. j@@ enni@@ fer mor@@ sch@@ is@@ er .
a number of finds from these exc@@ av@@ ations were found in a glass tr@@ ay , including a large glass plate , several finds of fine glass , and parts of a delicate br@@ ick chain .
the villa was probably built from the first to the fourth century after christ , until the first german@@ s arrived in the then roman r@@ hin@@ eland , pre@@ sum@@ ably mor@@ sch@@ is@@ er .
the children also worked with the roman wind@@ m@@ ill game , similar to the current m@@ ill game , or they did not write as the roman wind@@ m@@ ills once did .
at the stand of the roman thermal ba@@ ths z@@ ü@@ l@@ p@@ ich the children were allowed to lay mo@@ sa@@ ics themselves , at the stand of the glass museum rhe@@ in@@ bach gl@@ as@@ mo@@ sa@@ ics and at the stand of the nature centre ei@@ fe@@ l net@@ ter@@ sh@@ ei@@ fe@@ l net@@ ter@@ sh@@ ei@@ heim serve a .
the two cold blo@@ ss@@ oms of the original , fa@@ i@@ th@@ fully re@@ constructed roman v@@ ans , have brought visitors to the park and came to the impressive castle stand .
with a week of rome from 13 to 21 september , the municip@@ ality of w@@ ach@@ t@@ berg will also be able to enter the r@@ hin@@ eland roman year 20@@ 14 , which is due to the death of emper@@ or au@@ gu@@ st@@ us 2000 years ago .
together with the country ’ s national and historical associations and the w@@ ach@@ t@@ ber@@ ger wan@@ der@@ -@@ association , the partnership association and the la@@ i@@ en@@ spi@@ el@@ kre@@ is ob@@ er@@ bac@@ he@@ m , them@@ atic hi@@ kes , lec@@ tures , cooking even@@ ings and lec@@ tures are offered .
for example , a roman legi@@ on@@ na@@ ire is being held back by his work on the zu@@ g@@ en@@ en w@@ ach@@ t@@ berg , and plants are being presented as living monuments from roman times and a fun@@ ny lesson in international understanding .
the ad@@ endor@@ fer primary school is dedicated to the development of the roman topic within the framework of a project week .
the roman week is intended to bring to an end the numerous , but often no longer visible , trac@@ es of the roman@@ s in w@@ ach@@ t@@ berg .
the w@@ ach@@ t@@ ber@@ ger ra@@ th@@ aus presents a small presentation to the fund of the ber@@ k@@ um mat@@ ron sanc@@ tu@@ ary in 18@@ 7@@ 9 .
e@@ bol@@ a : the ep@@ ide@@ mic is bur@@ den@@ ing west africa ’ s economy with its economy , and the economy is bur@@ sting west africa ’ s economy with the ep@@ ide@@ mic .
the e@@ bol@@ a ep@@ ide@@ mic in west africa is also a serious b@@ low to the economy .
markets are or@@ ph@@ an@@ ed - and international companies are di@@ stan@@ cing themselves .
the dev@@ ast@@ ating e@@ bol@@ a ep@@ ide@@ mic is putting a heavy b@@ low to the west african economy .
the har@@ v@@ est is ro@@ tting in the fields that are deser@@ ted and the markets or@@ ph@@ an@@ ed - the virus has caused a great deal of damage to the region .
some international companies are also already di@@ stan@@ cing themselves from this .
&quot; the e@@ bol@@ a ep@@ ide@@ mic is not only a medical crisis , but also an economic one , &quot; jud@@ ged by the head of the african development bank , don@@ ald k@@ ab@@ er@@ u@@ ka .
liber@@ ia is the hard@@ est hit
&quot; it is a total disaster , we lose a lot of money , &quot; says al@@ ha@@ ji b@@ am@@ o@@ go , who is on the second largest market in liber@@ ia &apos;s capital , mon@@ ro@@ via , selling clothes .
the only way to get on the market is to use food or something to dis@@ inf@@ ect e@@ bol@@ a .
liber@@ ia is the hard@@ est hit by the virus , alone here fell fi@@ ber more than 600 people to be killed .
recently , the health authorities stated that the disease is spread across every corner of the country .
in gu@@ ine@@ a , sier@@ ra le@@ one and ni@@ geria , the virus has spread .
in total , more than 15@@ 00 people have died , thousands more have died .
foreign companies prefer employees to be members of staff .
throughout res@@ our@@ ce-@@ rich countries , companies are running their business .
foreign companies such as the steel group ar@@ cel@@ or mit@@ tal are with@@ drawing their employees , several international airlines are no longer flying to the affected regions .
local trad@@ ers and farmers are also respon@@ ding : few merchan@@ ts are left to leave their homes to buy supplies .
in some areas of sier@@ ra le@@ one and liber@@ ia , which are quar@@ ant@@ ine , the number of people responsible for ex@@ porting is dec@@ lining .
farmers d@@ are not pay their own home for the har@@ v@@ est .
food is scar@@ ce
&quot; people are going to travel less and less &quot; , says phil@@ li@@ pe de v@@ re@@ yer , paris expert for the economy of west africa .
the man , for example , who normally goes to the market and sel@@ ls his vegetables , would rather stay at home .
the population is therefore feeling the direct and urgent consequences of the ep@@ ide@@ mic : food is scar@@ ce .
markets are being sh@@ ut down by stocks of basic food@@ stuffs such as rice .
at the same time , the region , which is heavily dependent on international companies , is threat@@ ening to damage its image - with far-@@ reaching consequences .
the biggest danger is that international companies will be able to avoid the area for a long time , says phili@@ ppe hu@@ g@@ on of the french think tan@@ k ir@@ is .
the crucial factor is how far and how long the virus will spread .
investors might get the impression that &quot; it is dangerous to invest in gu@@ ine@@ a , sier@@ ra le@@ one , and liber@@ ia , and thus to invest , &quot; says hu@@ g@@ on .
the disease also affects the har@@ d-@@ pressed national budgets of the states , which are the ones that are the ones that are suffering from the disease , in the states of the member states , and the states that are hard hit by it .
the disease also affects the already har@@ sh national budgets of the countries concerned .
the rating agency mo@@ o@@ dy &apos;s fears that the latter &apos;s budget will be heavily dependent on the high spending on the health system and , in addition , on the deterior@@ ating economy .
the african development bank has already promised to provide health care systems in the countries concerned with usd 60 million ( eur 45 million ) .
the effects are also visible in ni@@ geria , where only a few e@@ bol@@ a cases have been diagno@@ sed so far .
while the o@@ il@@ -@@ rich region in the southern ni@@ ger del@@ ta has not been affected so far .
but elsewhere , many people are already left out of fear of cont@@ ag@@ ion .
reservations in hotels are also falling shar@@ p@@ ly .
protect your 50@@ th anniversary from the start of the year !
the sch@@ ü@@ tz@@ en@@ vere@@ in &quot; t@@ ann@@ en@@ wal@@ d &quot; bern@@ ga@@ u celebra@@ tes its 50@@ th anniversary from 12 to 14 september .
on high tours , the sch@@ ü@@ t@@ ten@@ vere@@ in t@@ ann@@ en@@ wal@@ d is preparing for the 50@@ th anniversary of the foundation of the festival from 12@@ th to 14@@ th september .
the plan is to be signed on friday , september 12 , a great evening of entertainment with the group &quot; dor@@ fro@@ ck@@ er &quot; .
on saturday at 6 p.m. the big b@@ ö@@ ll@@ er@@ sch@@ u@@ ß@@ en is open .
then the t@@ ent is placed in the big f@@ ence with the &quot; sto@@ ap@@ fal@@ zer sp@@ it@@ z@@ bu@@ am &quot; .
bl@@ as@@ k@@ ap@@ elle is a br@@ ass band that provides music and music for the music .
highlights on sunday are the festival service and 9.@@ 30 a.m. in the par@@ ish church and the great fe@@ ast at 2 p.m.
in the afternoon , the federal and gau@@ ge price is also distributed .
a particularly beautiful view will be provided by the 25 ladies with their dir@@ n@@ d@@ l@@ n .
fe@@ st@@ k@@ ap@@ elle is the b@@ all@@ as@@ k@@ ap@@ elle bern@@ ga@@ u .
the pat@@ ron was may@@ or wol@@ f@@ gan@@ g wild and secretary of state al@@ bert fü@@ r@@ ack@@ er .
the original name &quot; sch@@ ü@@ tz@@ en@@ ges@@ ell@@ schaft t@@ ann@@ en@@ wal@@ d bern@@ ga@@ u &quot; dates from 19@@ 07 , when the society for social entertainment was founded on 21 march in the room and small cab@@ in sho@@ oting &quot; .
the na@@ zi regime had announced the dis@@ solution of the association in 19@@ 37 .
only in 196@@ 4 did 19 young men find themselves again , who were born on april 30 at the inn lu@@ k@@ as the &quot; new &quot; sch@@ ü@@ tz@@ en@@ vere@@ in &quot; t@@ ann@@ en@@ wal@@ d &quot; bern@@ ga@@ u from b@@ ap@@ tism .
kar@@ l march and ad@@ ol@@ f ried lead the association as a sho@@ ot@@ master through a difficult initial period in which it mainly focused on the creation of a club .
in the autumn of 196@@ 5 the sch@@ ü@@ tz@@ en@@ vere@@ in started its activities in the inn &quot; le@@ in@@ inger &quot; with two teams .
in the years that followed , the sport@@ sm@@ en who have now been organized into seven teams established themselves in all classes up to the 1st gau@@ lig@@ a .
the association records are the first to be published every year and the magic limit of 3@@ 80 r@@ ings was first established in 1980 by ru@@ di me@@ i@@ er .
just as the efficiency of active sho@@ ot@@ ers has increased , members have also improved .
after the &quot; le@@ in@@ inger &quot; club no longer meets the demands of a modern sho@@ o@@ ter club , the team has changed its name to the &quot; le@@ in@@ inger &quot; .
after a working performance of 27@@ 00 hours , on 8 may 198@@ 8 , par@@ ish str@@ ass@@ er awarded the prize for the new protec@@ tive rooms .
one of the great highlights of the club ’ s history was certainly the 4@@ 4th edition of the art of ga@@ thering , cou@@ pled with the f@@ es@@ tive con@@ flag@@ r@@ ation of the new s@@ ag@@ it@@ tari@@ us flag in july 1991 .
on 23 and 24 april 1994 , the sch@@ ü@@ tz@@ en@@ vere@@ in celebrated its 30@@ th anniversary .
1995 a b@@ ö@@ ll@@ er@@ group was founded .
jo@@ se@@ f sch@@ mal@@ z@@ l was b@@ ö@@ ll@@ er@@ referen@@ ced .
a big challenge for the &quot; b@@ ö@@ ller &quot; and for the association as a whole was the orientation of the bav@@ arian b@@ ö@@ ll@@ er@@ tre@@ ff@@ en 2005 .
in many hours of volunte@@ er work , the club members last year opened the rooms and the sho@@ oting facility in the bern@@ ga@@ u hof , thus up@@ dating to the latest technology .
ele@@ ven teams in round mat@@ ches
the sport@@ y performance of the sho@@ o@@ ter club can also be seen .
al@@ together , 11 teams are currently participating in the round mat@@ ches : six air ri@@ f@@ le teams , an air gun team , a sports pilot and a team k@@ k@@ 1 , a youth and two ah@@ -@@ teams .
the first team with lars ell@@ rich , k@@ ath@@ ar@@ ina ell@@ rich , ste@@ ff@@ i gra@@ d and ker@@ sti@@ n kel@@ er@@ mann is in round 2013 / 14 of the gau@@ ob@@ er@@ lig@@ a ( highest league in the sch@@ ü@@ tz@@ eng@@ u district ) .
the second team with ve@@ ren@@ a mo@@ os@@ bur@@ ger alex@@ and@@ ra me@@ i@@ er , eva sch@@ u@@ h@@ mann and to@@ bi@@ as gram@@ l is nom@@ inated by the gau@@ lig@@ a nor@@ d to the gau@@ ob@@ er@@ lig@@ a .
besides sho@@ oting , events such as bo@@ ck@@ ste@@ chen , car@@ ni@@ val and kö@@ ni@@ g@@ s@@ ball , club excur@@ sion and christmas party have tradition .
the sho@@ ot@@ ers are also present at the festi@@ vals in par@@ ish and municip@@ ality .
ton@@ y ste@@ w@@ art is suffering an accident on return to the track .
ton@@ y ste@@ war@@ t &apos;s return to the race track ended about half way through his race on the atlan@@ ta motor spe@@ ed@@ way .
ste@@ w@@ art dro@@ ve against the wall for the second time , after his right front ty@@ re bur@@ st in round 17@@ 2 and finished his evening .
ste@@ w@@ art dro@@ ve his damaged car into the garage and left without going to the press .
his team leader ch@@ ad jo@@ hn@@ ston said that his 14 head was a good one .
&quot; i wish we had a better commitment and a better result for him , &quot; said jo@@ hn@@ ston , &quot; he said .
we drive to rich@@ mon@@ d and hope that we can do better there .
ste@@ w@@ art already used to drive to the race on sunday evening after a col@@ li@@ sion with ky@@ le bus@@ ch and had to repair the right side of his car .
&quot; i am quite hope@@ ful today for a good result , &quot; jo@@ hn@@ ston said and put it to me : &quot; it was simply not a success . &quot;
not long after the second accident , ste@@ ward &apos;s car was loaded into the tra@@ iler and the team had packed and was ready to leave .
ste@@ w@@ art left three nas@@ car spr@@ int cup rac@@ es after his car had taken another driver at an ash@@ -@@ train race in the north of new york state and killed .
he decided to return this week and either to go to atlan@@ ta or to the next race in rich@@ mon@@ d to win a place in persecu@@ tion .
he returned to his job , while stu@@ dying the tragic incident that occurred at the death of the 20@@ -@@ year-@@ old k@@ ev@@ in ward j@@ r. , who was at the time of a race on the track to ste@@ w@@ art .
the authorities announced on friday that the investigation into the cause of the accident would be ongoing for at least two weeks .
no decision has yet been taken on whether ste@@ w@@ art should be charged with an acc@@ us@@ ation .
the three champi@@ on was received with great applause when he was presented before the race .
after a start at 12@@ th position , ste@@ w@@ art was already on the stage for the first 10 and was tempor@@ arily in fourth position .
after a re@@ start in round 12@@ 2 , bush ’ s oppon@@ ent came to power .
car no . 18 out of control after exit from cur@@ ve 2 and col@@ li@@ ded with ste@@ w@@ art , with both cars walking against the wall .
ste@@ w@@ art continued , but fell back to position 21 .
d@@ ancing enthusi@@ astic young people sought to find their way around the world .

like many other clubs , jazz groups are also very popular in the tv j@@ ah@@ n year , and the secondary schools are the main means of doing this .
after the summer holidays , some groups have made a great deal of deci@@ sion@@ . the majority of them have decided to go on holiday .
now more and more young people are being sought for a sport that is healthy and has great fun .
in the two jazz and modern dance groups of lis@@ a ne@@ it@@ z@@ el , form@@ erly d@@ anc@@ er in the jazz and modern dance scene , the band &quot; spi@@ ri@@ ts &quot; , they are only nine children .
&quot; three in the group of 8-@@ 12 years , six in the group of twelve to 15@@ -@@ year-@@ ol@@ ds , &quot; says the 20@@ -@@ year-@@ old .
with more active , the whole thing would be much more fun , &quot; you could dance to quite different cho@@ re@@ o@@ gra@@ phi@@ es &quot; she says .
if you are interested in dance , you can enjoy a drink on thursday between 5 and 6 p.m. or on fri@@ days between 5 and 6.@@ 30 p.m. in the dance sports room at the former hotel me@@ yer , fre@@ i@@ stra@@ ß@@ e 9 , without obligation .
&quot; the training starts regularly with a war@@ m@@ -up program , &quot; says the co@@ ach .
after that , various cho@@ re@@ o@@ gra@@ phi@@ es are performed .
jaz@@ z@@ dance has the feature that there is no fixed form and is therefore not suitable for many styles .
elements from fol@@ kl@@ ore , classical music , sports and ac@@ ro@@ ba@@ tics are presented in jazz dance .
of course , soci@@ ability is not too short .
&quot; we go eating , watch dance films and we have also already seen a dance in the dance room &quot; , reports li@@ sa ne@@ it@@ z@@ el .
the group can make friends , have a beautiful ho@@ b@@ by and even have a lot of fun with your own engine development .
if you don &apos;t like jazz dance , you can also find it in one of the other offers of tv j@@ ah@@ n .
children and young people can always enter the classes on wednesday in the areas of children dance / jazz dance , b@@ am@@ bin@@ i bal@@ let , vide@@ oc@@ li@@ p-@@ d@@ ancing and hi@@ p-@@ hop .

bulg@@ arian prison guards are pro@@ testing nation@@ wide .
hundreds of prison staff from all over bulgaria have been arrested in the capital so@@ fi@@ a before the ministry of justice .
in the peaceful demonstration , they reiter@@ ated their demands for the restoration of their old working conditions , which have recently been changed .

nato does not want to break agreements with russia
nato will be strengthened by the planned sta@@ tioning in eastern europe as a result of the ukra@@ inian crisis .
nato secre@@ tar@@ y-@@ general and@@ ers fo@@ gh r@@ as@@ mus@@ sen said in brussels on monday that nato is following the founding agreement of the nato russia council of 1997 .
nato ’ s chief , however , accused russia of &quot; a cr@@ ack@@ down &quot; on the agreement .
&quot; today we must face up to reality that russia does not regard nato as a partner , &quot; r@@ as@@ mus@@ sen said .
documents and statements from the russian side indicate that &apos; you will not consider us to be oppon@@ ents &apos; .
stronger nato presence
r@@ as@@ mus@@ sen has also announced that nato will strengthen its presence in eastern europe .
a report on the issue of the &apos; reach agreement &apos; to be adopted at the nato summit in wal@@ es will ensure that &apos; we have more visible nato presence in the east as long as this is necessary &apos; , said r@@ as@@ mus@@ sen on monday .
ki@@ e@@ v and moscow are united on new gas talks with russia .
russia and ukraine have officially agreed to re@@ sume talks to resolve their gas dispute .
the negotiations were scheduled for next saturday , the russian energy minister , alexander no@@ wa@@ k , said on monday .
there is still a decision being taken by the european union as to whether or not to send a representative to the talks .
because of the dispute over gas prices , ukraine has not been receiving fuel from russia for weeks .
last , eu energy commissioner g@@ ün@@ ther o@@ et@@ t@@ inger conve@@ yed a message between the two sides .
ukraine had war@@ ned that russia could also supply gas to europe .
europe imports about one third of its natural gas from russian sources , a large proportion of which flows through ukraine .
mer@@ kel spe@@ aks of power : tol@@ l is &quot; quite clear &quot; coming , tol@@ l will come &quot; quite clearly &quot; .
now the chancell@@ or is once again clearly committed to this .
a license for all the complicated details , however , it is not .
persi@@ stent concerns from the c@@ du against the passenger car tol@@ l have made the c@@ su increasingly aware that the european union is not doing anything to help them .
chancell@@ or ang@@ ela mer@@ kel has , after sustained resistance , left her c@@ du a power word for the introduction of a passenger tol@@ l .
&quot; to be perfectly clear , it is in the coalition treaty , and it will come , &quot; said the party leader on monday after meetings of the c@@ du leaders .
the project was based on a detailed model but not on it .
in the black@@ -@@ red governance programme , &apos; certain parameters &apos; are mentioned .
federal minister of transport alexander do@@ br@@ in@@ dt ( c@@ su ) has made a proposal , and that is what is now being further worked on .
the n@@ r@@ w-@@ c@@ du , however , insi@@ sts on its ‘ no ’ to tol@@ ls on all roads .
mer@@ kel stressed that finance minister wol@@ f@@ gan@@ g sch@@ ä@@ u@@ ble ( c@@ du ) also makes a constructive contribution to the deliber@@ ations on a draft law .
beyond the subject , he also talked about other possibilities with do@@ br@@ in@@ dt to invest more private capital in infrastructure , including in broad@@ band .
&quot; there is nothing special about it &quot; , sch@@ ä@@ u@@ ble had a &quot; mirror &quot; report on sunday , which he did not comment on , his house examined a separate concept to provide car investors with tol@@ l revenues .
c@@ su ch@@ ef hor@@ st see@@ ho@@ fer war@@ ned that the world would be in a position to impose tol@@ l concepts on the lead minister in the cab@@ in@@ et .
c@@ du bun@@ des@@ vi@@ ze arm@@ in las@@ ch@@ et re@@ affir@@ med his objec@@ tions .
&quot; the coalition treaty never assumed that all kre@@ is@@ - and bun@@ des@@ stra@@ ß@@ e streets would be tol@@ led , &quot; said the north r@@ hin@@ e-@@ west@@ ph@@ ali@@ an c@@ du head of state .
in this respect , it is an important signal that see@@ ho@@ fer has now announced that he will be talking about this issue again .
resistance to the plans also comes from the c@@ du national associations of bad@@ en-@@ w@@ ür@@ t@@ tem@@ berg and r@@ hin@@ el@@ and-@@ pal@@ at@@ in@@ ate .
the background is that there is a fear that a tol@@ l would affect small border traffic with neighbouring countries .
the se@@ af@@ aring sho@@ ck was due to the tol@@ l criticism from the c@@ du coalition .
the left sees the plans as being very difficult in the face of the dispute in the union .
&quot; the mur@@ k tol@@ l is dead , &quot; said party leader ber@@ nd ri@@ ex@@ inger of the &quot; new os@@ n@@ ab@@ r@@ ü@@ ck@@ er ze@@ it@@ ung &quot; ( monday ) .
&quot; with the tol@@ l the minister fails &quot; . do@@ br@@ in@@ dt wants to impose a vig@@ net@@ te duty on all german roads that are to start in 20@@ 16 .
domestic car owners are allowed to use the coalition agreement but not to be additional bur@@ dens .
therefore , they should have a full compensation for the tol@@ ls through the motor vehicle tax .
the model must not , however , be used to discrimin@@ ate against foreign drivers because of their nation@@ ality under eu law .
genetic dis@@ order often mis@@ diagno@@ ses it .
a british woman says that she thought she was going to die in the united states as a result of a mis@@ diagno@@ sis for many years .
kar@@ in ro@@ d@@ gers lived almost all of her youth in the belief that she was only a few years away after she had been diagno@@ sed with another disease .
she was indeed suffering from the char@@ co@@ t-@@ mari@@ e-@@ to@@ oth disease ( c@@ mt ) - a group of in@@ h@@ eri@@ ted dis@@ orders that spread ner@@ ves outside the brain and sp@@ inal cor@@ d .
char@@ ity c@@ mt uk announced that missing diagno@@ ses are a frequent problem with people with cancer c@@ mt , because this is not the case .
about 23@@ ,000 people in britain are likely to suffer from c@@ mt , which may cause engine dis@@ orders such as mus@@ cle weak@@ ness , an un@@ certain gear and cur@@ ved to@@ es .
suff@@ e@@ rers also suffer from de@@ af@@ ness or pain , and the disease is incur@@ able and progres@@ sively , which means that the symp@@ t@@ oms are linked with time .
when ro@@ d@@ ger was 13 , she believed that she was interested in fried@@ re@@ ich@@ -@@ at@@ a@@ xi@@ e ( fa ) - a disease with very poor chan@@ ces of survival .
ro@@ d@@ ger thought she would be in a whe@@ el@@ chair before she was 18 , and before her 30@@ th birth@@ day .
the mother of two children , who is 51 years old today , said : &apos; as a child , i knew that i could not do the same as the others .
i was constantly falling and everything las@@ ted longer with me .
i never could play roll@@ ers or sk@@ ate@@ boards with the other children and was often critic@@ ised in school for my way of going and running .
ro@@ d@@ gers said that she was born at the age of 13 after several operations to reli@@ eve her ach@@ ill@@ es and stret@@ ching her feet .
&quot; i felt guil@@ ty because i was cur@@ ious .
when i was told i was sho@@ c@@ ked and hor@@ ri@@ fied .
i thought that i was in whe@@ el@@ chair with 18 and died with 25 , and in between , slowly lose all my skills .
i did all this with me alone and planned my own fun@@ eral .
she said when she was 17 she became aware that her skills were not so much reduced as she had hoped .
he was standing up , and hu@@ gged me and said , &quot; my love , i do not think you have that , otherwise you are already in the whe@@ el@@ chair . &quot;
i think you have a far less life@@ -@@ threat@@ ening thing .
after some genetic tests , her c@@ mt was detec@@ ted .
&quot; when he told me what c@@ mt was , i felt as if i were a winner , &quot; said she .
char@@ ity c@@ mt uk has a c@@ m@@ t-@@ awareness month , which is to be followed by a c@@ mt awareness month .

tax burden on business@@ men in the washington area increases with economic recovery
economic recovery means more customers , more sales and new jobs .
it also means higher taxes .
government and local tax decisions for domestic companies increased by a s@@ light increase last year , while economic recovery acceler@@ ated , such as a newly published study in the past week , and firms in the washington area formed no exception .
companies in the district , mar@@ y@@ land and vir@@ g@@ ini@@ a area jointly paid $ 2@@ 7.@@ 6 billion to state and local authorities in the 2013 financial year , an increase of 3.@@ 8 % over 2012 ’ s 2012 revenues of $ 2@@ 6.@@ 6 billion .
the state and local tax burden on companies increased by 4.@@ 3 % last year to eur 6@@ 71 billion , compared to 3.@@ 9 % in 2006 .
government taxes increased more than local taxes to $ 4.@@ 3 % , so the study suggests , from the service industry to the private sector .
more than half of district tax revenue , 56 percent , comes from corporate taxes , while 36 percent of revenues are mar@@ y@@ land ’ s .
vir@@ g@@ ini@@ a achiev@@ es the lowest tax revenue from companies , at 28 % .
much of the rise in tax revenues is due to a recovery in corporate property values , say the fore@@ sters , which leads to an increase in real estate taxes by 3.@@ 7 % this year after the three succ@@ essive years with a rise in the number .
while much of these profits are from large states such as california , new york , and tex@@ as , the process also seems to be moving in the washington area .
companies in the district , mar@@ y@@ land and vir@@ g@@ ini@@ a have jointly paid over $ 10 billion in government and local real estate taxes last year , compared to $ 9.@@ 6 billion in 2012 - an increase over the course of a year by 4.@@ 2 % .
but the apparent recovery in real estate values is not as effective in mar@@ y@@ land in increasing government and local tax revenues , as this is where real estate taxes are amoun@@ ting to just over a fifth of the corporate tax burden .
companies in vir@@ g@@ ini@@ a and d.@@ c. pay almost half of their government and local taxes in the form of property taxes .
&quot; in mar@@ y@@ land , the following is happening : a large proportion of real estate , especially in the tax area around d.@@ c. , is owned either by the government or by non-@@ profit organizations that do not pay real estate taxes , &quot; said dou@@ gl@@ as lin@@ d@@ holm center .
mar@@ y@@ land is therefore forced to focus much more on income taxes , for example , to provide the same services that other countries offer .
the recent fiscal recovery by businesses cannot be attribu@@ ted solely to the recovery of the housing market .
corporate revenues also seem to recover , so the data .
companies in the region reported income taxes on state organizations , from 2.@@ 3 billion dollars in comparison with 2.@@ 1 billion in 2006 .
mar@@ y@@ land took $ 1 billion in corporate income taxes that were the highest in the region .
while the trend is in the same direction , local tax burden on companies is not increasing in all three places equally .
the district govern@@ or ’ s rate of increase was 4.@@ 3 % of the national average , while the mar@@ y@@ land rise was significantly higher , 4.@@ 9 % .
only vir@@ g@@ ini@@ a reported a lower average tax of 4.@@ 1 % .
vir@@ g@@ ini@@ a has a record record of a very low tur@@ nover of 6 % in all three areas of office ( in all three , there are firm corporate tax rates ) .
the mar@@ y@@ land corporate tax rate is 8.@@ 25 % and the district is relatively low .
a similar study by the us chamber of commerce earlier this year showed that in vir@@ g@@ ini@@ a , lower government and local corporate taxes are required , and overall , there is a better fiscal climate than in mar@@ y@@ land .
the study did not investigate the district .
in spite of the advantages vir@@ g@@ ini@@ a is under pressure from its southern neighb@@ our .
north car@@ ol@@ ina has laws to reduce its corporate tax rates this year from 6.@@ 9 % to 6 % , which is the same as vir@@ g@@ ini@@ a , and the rate will be increased to 5 % next year .
if the state continues to raise its income targets in the coming year , this law could reduce the state ’ s corporate income tax rate to 3 % by 20@@ 17 .
meanwhile , it seems that small businesses in the washington area are doing better , and they are paying more government and local taxes , according to the latest study .
corporate taxes , which are paid as personal income taxes by small business@@ men - a transitional structure whereby most small businesses are organized - are paid in the district , mar@@ y@@ land , and vir@@ g@@ ini@@ a by 20 % last year , to $ 2.@@ 7 billion .
researchers say that the trend and increase in the number of corporate taxes across the country is likely to continue this year , with an increase in the general vat revenue for the state and the local authorities .
yet washington may be lag@@ ging behind if the spending cuts are not implemented by the federal government .
partner city : german beer for gu@@ ang@@ z@@ ho@@ u
ho@@ ps and mal@@ t - a popular combination in china as well .
german beer enjoys a very good reputation in china .
frankfurt ’ s partner city in china now wants a bre@@ w@@ ery and also hopes for a direct flight connection between the two cities .
german beer , used in frankfurt &apos;s partner city gu@@ ang@@ z@@ ho@@ u - that is the urgent wish of the officials in china .
&quot; we would be very pleased if a german bre@@ w@@ ery could establish itself in our city , &quot; said the vice party secretary of the south china metro@@ polis , li yi@@ we@@ i , in the german bre@@ w@@ ery visiting a delegation this week .
time and again , the func@@ tion@@ alist of the ruling chinese communist party came to this issue during the con@@ vers@@ ation of the twel@@ ve-@@ million metro@@ polis .
gu@@ ang@@ z@@ ho@@ u , which is also called can@@ ton in germany , is one of the rich@@ est cities in china , war@@ ned li .
so people also poss@@ ess the purchasing power to buy german beer .
the chairman of the german social democratic party ( sp@@ d ) , thor@@ ste@@ n sch@@ ä@@ fer@@ -@@ g@@ ü@@ m@@ bel , who led the german political delegation , said to the host that he would look for a possible partner for the project in germany .
&quot; for beer it does not take much : good water , gra@@ in and jo@@ ie de vi@@ vre &quot; , he added at lunch with the party leader in gu@@ ang@@ z@@ ho@@ u .
this jo@@ ie de vi@@ vre is already be@@ aming up with mr. li , he fl@@ at@@ tered the host .
the functional committee then came up with a proposal from gu@@ ang@@ z@@ ho@@ u to replace sch@@ ä@@ fer g@@ ü@@ m@@ bel with red wine , which was served for the meal .
the chinese brand t@@ sing@@ ta@@ o is based on german bre@@ wing art .
t@@ sing@@ ta@@ o beer is produced according to the german pur@@ ity order .
more business
a second wish of chinese hosts would be to have a direct flight connection between frankfurt and gu@@ ang@@ z@@ ho@@ u , said vice party leader li .
lu@@ f@@ than@@ sa had offered the flight earlier , but in 2012 , it was cancelled for economic reasons .
&quot; it would be worth it again , &quot; the local politici@@ an expressed his convic@@ tion .
&quot; the business between our two cities is growing all the time &quot; .
currently , travellers would have to travel by de@@ tour via chan@@ g@@ sh@@ a in hun@@ an province , li compla@@ ined .
the administration of gu@@ ang@@ d@@ ong province , the capital of gu@@ ang@@ z@@ ho@@ u , also hopes for the flight connection .
the vice govern@@ or of the province , chen y@@ un@@ xi@@ an , expressed this wish during his con@@ vers@@ ation with the social democrats .
&quot; this is a very good idea , &quot; sch@@ ä@@ fer@@ -@@ g@@ ü@@ m@@ bel rep@@ lied - the chinese vice minister li j@@ in@@ ju@@ n , an in@@ timate german con@@ no@@ iss@@ eur , said no@@ k@@ ked .
well-@@ kept partnership
the li@@ fel@@ ess vice leader of gu@@ ang@@ z@@ ho@@ u ho@@ u hopes that he will be able to persu@@ ade frankfurt to join a partnership meeting next year .
li yi@@ we@@ i was already on the main but not yet in this function .
he only came into office this year after his pre@@ dec@@ essor had been arrested for corruption charges .
the local party leader , wan q@@ ing@@ lian , also had to go .
the action taken against gu@@ ang@@ z@@ ho@@ u officials is part of a nation@@ wide campaign against corruption in the party and administration , led by head of state x@@ i j@@ in@@ ping .
the new leader , li yi@@ we@@ i , had been campaign@@ ing for an american company before his party career , which was most unusual in the chinese communist party .
before he took office in gu@@ ang@@ z@@ ho@@ u , he was a senior official in fu@@ j@@ ian , where the car manufacturer v@@ w was a great plant .
frankfurt is officially more than a do@@ zen tw@@ in@@ ning partnerships between cities .
the connection to the gu@@ an@@ gl@@ er lake , which is 9@@ ,000 kilometres away , is one of those that are maintained by both sides , for example with an exchange of pu@@ pil@@ s .
last year , the 2@@ 5-@@ year anniversary of the german@@ -@@ chinese association was celebrated .
the southern chinese metro@@ polis on the pe@@ ar@@ l river is almost as strong as the whole of h@@ ess@@ en with its economic power .
next year , it intends to increase gross domestic product of eur 250 billion , according to li .
family of jo@@ an ri@@ vers &quot; expres@@ ses the thum@@ bs &quot; .
jo@@ an ri@@ vers has been a medical hospital since she was born in new york city three days ago ; her daughter was not aware of any hope today that she would not have been able to find her way from si@@ ck@@ ness .
&quot; thank you for your continued love and support , &quot; said mel@@ is@@ sa ri@@ vers today in a communication .
we are all raising our fing@@ ers .
according to her mother , on thursday after an emergency , she was found in a clin@@ ic at upper east side , yor@@ k@@ ville en@@ do@@ s@@ scop@@ y , in london .
the doctors deliber@@ ately keep them se@@ ded and under close observation , until they are satisfied with their condition , which continues to be described as &quot; serious &quot; .
the re@@ actions have come from many quarters , including the overwhel@@ ming online support of don@@ ald re@@ ag@@ an .
environmentally friendly vacu@@ um clean@@ ers and rising wages
for cars and vacu@@ um clean@@ ers that are now coming into the market , stric@@ ter environmental standards will apply in future .

new cars are subject to a &quot; euro 6 &quot; level of emissions of nit@@ ro@@ gen o@@ xide .
there is also more money for s@@ ca@@ ff@@ ol@@ ding buil@@ ders : they receive a nation@@ wide uniform minimum wage of 10.@@ 25 euros .
amaz@@ on bu@@ ys t@@ wit@@ ch for $ 1.@@ 04 billion in $ 1.@@ 04 billion in t@@ wit@@ ch , $ 1.@@ 04 billion in $ 1.@@ 04 billion in $ 1.@@ 4 billion in $ 1.@@ 4 billion .
amaz@@ on has just confirmed what information was reported on monday morning : the online re@@ tail@@ er - and video producer , and a host of other things - bu@@ ys the video stre@@ aming service t@@ wit@@ ch for 1.@@ 04 billion $ ( $ 1.@@ 04 billion ) .
the announcement comes surprising , not because no one wants to take on t@@ wit@@ ch , but because it was widely susp@@ ected that you@@ tube was the company that would buy .
three months ago , it seemed that the sale of t@@ wit@@ ch to the video service of google for a cool billion was decided on .
t@@ wit@@ ch , which was only founded three years ago as ju@@ st@@ in@@ .@@ tv , was a general stre@@ aming service - a live version of yo@@ st@@ out@@ -@@ tv .
instead , it quickly became a platform for players who wanted to play their bra@@ v@@ ura games , a &quot; you@@ tube for live games &quot; that was a great in@@ sid@@ er .
the t@@ wit@@ ch interface .
and &quot; let &apos;s play &quot; , a video gen@@ re in which better gu@@ ys can see the ( mostly older ) playing a painting of secret science theat@@ ers , are on you@@ tube .
it is just that you@@ tube is often called when you use t@@ wit@@ ch to describe what you are doing , so the message that you@@ tube t@@ wit@@ ch was trying to buy was somewhat bo@@ red .
it is a myster@@ y why the deal with you@@ tube is not made , as the company reports that it was willing to pay as much as amaz@@ on did .
all we know at the moment is that e@@ m@@ met sm@@ ith said that he was president of t@@ wit@@ ch : &apos; we have chosen amaz@@ on to be because they are bound by our community , they share our values and long-term values .
another secret , frank@@ ly , is the incredible success of t@@ wit@@ ch .
for s@@ no@@ bs like me , who explain that they prefer to do sport rather than watch it , it is difficult to understand the attr@@ action that is supposed to help others play than to take control con@@ sol@@ es into the hands of themselves .
it is one thing to tell a friend about the shoul@@ der at 3 o &apos;@@ clock in the morning , while resid@@ ent evil s@@ ne@@ aks , and something quite different , a sp@@ in@@ ner watching as he gets 20 times in succ@@ ession .
all these games you could watch right now .
another problem is that many of the most popular games today are e@@ go games , so the watching can be done without own control over the perspective a really good reci@@ pe for head@@ ache .
i admit that the rapid procedures in which the ro@@ ger ban@@ ni@@ sters of our electronic age are based are not very easy to use .
but until a game or hum@@ or@@ virtu@@ os@@ ity is present , its t@@ wit@@ ch channel is probably not so interesting .
but what do ske@@ p@@ tics know about this , like me ?
t@@ wit@@ ch is used by 55 million different visitors per month and is the fourth largest source of internet traffic pe@@ aks .
and how exactly does amaz@@ on want to make money from it ?
it is difficult to imagine that t@@ wit@@ ch is so elegant in amaz@@ on inst@@ ant video that it is like you@@ tube .
but t@@ wit@@ ch has something that every company would like : thousands of young men who are turned into advertis@@ ers .
as the chairman of t@@ wit@@ ch , she@@ ar , said , amaz@@ on and t@@ wit@@ ch &quot; both believe in the future of gaming , &quot; and the medium shows no signs of a shr@@ in@@ king , nor yet .
on the h@@ ü@@ p@@ f@@ burg near the bur@@ g@@ gar@@ ten festival , a lot of things were going on on on saturday .
the concept of the organiz@@ ers agreed .
despite the strong ra@@ in-@@ casting on saturday evening , an estimated 1@@ 200 music fans came to the open-@@ air festival in bur@@ gun@@ dy garden .
at times the entry had to be stopped .
&quot; that was an@@ no@@ ying , &quot; said ron se@@ m , one of the organiz@@ ers .
sal@@ z@@ we@@ del l lic@@ ht und fre@@ u@@ en .
we have heard from two spanish words ma@@ xi@@ m s@@ ach@@ ra@@ j and ron se@@ m the name am@@ ula .
the open air in the salz@@ we@@ del@@ er bur@@ g@@ gar@@ ten is supposed to show bri@@ ght@@ ness during the day and in the evening through various shows .
well , and the fun comes from alone anyway .
this was already evident early on saturday when the first visitors to the open air .
a fe@@ ast for all generations had promised the organiz@@ ers .
and they have succeeded .
around the supply stands on the bur@@ g@@ gar@@ ten@@ wi@@ ese were salt water producers , but also guests from the ne@@ arer and wider surroundings .
they followed the first live performances , wi@@ ped with the foot in the beat , enjoyed the k@@ is@@ ses - short : relaxation pure and enjoy@@ ment were desired .
and the way through generations .
while some people are focusing on blan@@ kets on the extra car@@ r@@ y-@@ on white sand on the beach bar , others are bu@@ st@@ ling with a quarter of wine in the vin@@ o@@ the@@ k , the young on the hi@@ p@@ f@@ burg r@@ aged .
but also when it comes to children &apos;s min@@ ks , the volunte@@ ers had liter@@ ally all their hands full to help the and@@ ro@@ id .
the larger ones used the k@@ ick@@ er@@ tables or took part in a sk@@ ate@@ board workshop that the good@@ foot cre@@ ws from sal@@ z@@ we@@ del had built .
until the great rain came .
just before 5.@@ 30 p.m. he was pr@@ one to the visitors , especially families who were looking for the wide and dry .
but the attr@@ acti@@ veness of the festival did not de@@ tr@@ act from this .
&quot; more people came than expected , &quot; said ron se@@ m , who spoke of a &quot; success all over the line &quot; .
i am therefore very critical of the great party being repeated next year .
although the content and size of the event still need to be worked on , se@@ m made a first assessment of the popular vote on sunday .
the first time he was a member of the group , he was a member of the group , and he was a member of the group .
obviously , the security company was booked with too little force .
the result is that some who had already paid out no longer came to the area .
the response was very good .
in a first cau@@ tious es@@ timate , the sal@@ z@@ we@@ del@@ er co-@@ organiz@@ er spoke of about 1@@ 200 visitors who were in the garden of the castle .
there were problems with sound technology .
the hi@@ p-@@ hop sal@@ z@@ we@@ del@@ er band bloc@@ k@@ s@@ `@@ n@@ `@@ ro@@ x bro@@ ke their performance out of ner@@ v@@ ousness .
the techn@@ ici@@ ans were unable to find a reason@@ ably reasonable sound .
the planned sh@@ ish@@ a loun@@ ges could not be built because the t@@ ents were closed due to a ty@@ re break@@ down .
&quot; next year , you will be there , &quot; says the organiz@@ er .
the premi@@ ere of the am@@ u@@ la@@ -@@ open air was marked by the number of visitors more than ever .
and that in bad weather .
however , the organiz@@ ers have made some mistakes which were dela@@ yed the first time , but at the second edition they must be removed .
fac@@ e@@ book also needs to be critical in the social network .
&quot; sorry , but for 12 euros you just expected more , &quot; says mel@@ ani@@ e me@@ i@@ er at the event page .
&quot; you &apos;ve taken a bit of it on , &quot; says e@@ le zim@@ mer@@ mann at the same place .
others do not see the initial problems as close as they are .
i think it is very good that some people are not only st@@ up@@ id , but are actually trying to put something on their feet .
hu@@ t off ! &quot; wri@@ tes ste@@ ph@@ ani@@ e jen@@ s@@ ß to am@@ ula .
now the organiz@@ ers have a year to answer these critic@@ isms .
new rad@@ om in ber@@ k@@ um : w@@ ach@@ t@@ berg ’ s land@@ mark shr@@ ines
this is not as expected .
instead , the ready component is waiting to be integrated into the distinc@@ tive building .
the action is in the context of a larger measure : almost 50 years after the space observation rad@@ ar ti@@ ra was established , the shell , the so-called rad@@ om , is being completely renewed .
the new rad@@ om is equipped with a di@@ ameter of 4@@ 7.@@ 5 meters slightly smaller than the old one .
however , the size remains world record .
the last step towards comple@@ ting the new cover is the change of the cap .
the upper part of the old shell is separated and covered with a cr@@ ane .
after that , the last quarter of the new shell is set up .
if the weather is present , the action will be taken at the beginning of this week .

the 20@@ -@@ year-@@ old from the uk was sent to the hospital to get rid of the ja@@ w after taking part in the vir@@ al trend on tuesday .

do the bur@@ g@@ vere@@ ins soon pul@@ l back together ?
finally , there was a constant conflict between the two wol@@ fr@@ at@@ sha@@ us@@ ers bur@@ gun@@ dy clubs .
now , the boards of directors are considering possible cooperation .
as a model for the reconstruction of the wol@@ fr@@ at@@ sha@@ us@@ er castle , the late richard di@@ mb@@ ath , former chairman of the wol@@ fr@@ at@@ sha@@ us@@ er bur@@ g@@ fre@@ un@@ de , carried out the project in french gu@@ é@@ del@@ on .
just a year ago , there was no good climate between the bur@@ g@@ vere@@ in and the friends of the bur@@ gun@@ dy wol@@ fr@@ at@@ sha@@ us@@ en .
the positions of the commission and the council on the history of wol@@ fr@@ at@@ sha@@ us@@ er burg have seemed to be very different .
now the two camps are moving together : there are to be talks soon about a common approach .
this is confirmed by the board of directors of tor@@ ste@@ n s@@ j@@ ö@@ berg ( bur@@ g@@ vere@@ in ) and her@@ bert pi@@ ff@@ l ( bur@@ g@@ fre@@ un@@ de ) at the request of our newspaper .
&quot; i listened to mr pi@@ ff@@ l and suggested that we should sit down together , &quot; says s@@ j@@ ö@@ berg .
he believes that all members of both clubs could in future pul@@ l together again .
this is how visible succ@@ esses can be achieved more quickly .
while the bur@@ gun@@ dy friends are still trying to get rid of richard di@@ mb@@ ath until the last time , the castle on the ber@@ g@@ wal@@ d was re@@ built , the bur@@ g@@ vere@@ in around s@@ j@@ ö@@ berg stands for &quot; expl@@ or@@ ation and adventure &quot; .
her@@ bert pi@@ ff@@ l , second chairman of the bur@@ g@@ fre@@ un@@ de , has made a great pleasure by his own information about the call .
since di@@ mb@@ at ’ s death , he has been standing before the bur@@ gun@@ dy ’ s friends .
a new chairman is due to be found in a member &apos;s meeting in mid-@@ september .
currently , the association counts about 40 members according to the 7@@ 4-@@ year-@@ old .
&quot; after the death of my friend richard di@@ mb@@ ath , we have the club activities from respect first ru@@ ined . &quot;
according to pi@@ ff@@ l , the new chairman will then be in contact with the bur@@ g@@ vere@@ in .
until then , bur@@ gun@@ dy ’ s friends could also get a current picture of their grou@@ ping .
there is currently no candidate for the presidency , says pi@@ ff@@ l .
&quot; but i am confident that someone will find himself &quot; he himself does not want to stand because he is resid@@ ent in bad t@@ ö@@ l@@ z .
the new chairman should be a wol@@ fr@@ at@@ sha@@ user .
the t@@ ö@@ l@@ zer wants to participate in the project &quot; but very much like to continue working &quot; .
the different points of view on reconstruction are not likely to be discussed in pi@@ ff@@ l ’ s eyes in the near future .
he appreci@@ ates di@@ mb@@ ath as a &quot; mis@@ sion@@ ary &quot; , who always believed in the reconstruction of the castle .
two similar , already well advanced projects in austria and france would show that this idea is not a dead letter .
the high level of participation of the population and the volunte@@ ers from around the world make them a tourist mag@@ net .
pi@@ ff@@ l : &quot; i too was s@@ cep@@ tical at the beginning .
but over time i am more and more convinced that the european union is making sense in moving the project forward , &quot; it could be a &apos; one-@@ stop@@ -@@ shop &apos; for the flu@@ te city .
there is nothing else here .
moreover , the project would be financed by eu grants , visitor tickets and potential spon@@ sors .
&quot; the idea of reconstruction is not something i personally want to throw out , &quot; he hopes that the bur@@ g@@ vere@@ in will perhaps take a step forward on this point .
its goal of first docum@@ enting history is &quot; important and good &quot; .
then we could look further .
cle@@ ver ways to save money on university tex@@ t@@ books
since the cost of university tex@@ t@@ books is more than $ 1@@ ,000 per year for many students , the fa@@ st-@@ second half of the student has considered mat@@ t sch@@ ro@@ e@@ der a cle@@ ver sp@@ ar@@ y-@@ idea .
he inven@@ ted a lo@@ an system for books of students of higher sem@@ ester and offered a nom@@ inal re@@ mun@@ er@@ ation to facilitate res@@ ale .
&quot; my mathem@@ a@@ tics book costs $ 18@@ 0 normally , but i got it for $ 10 for a sem@@ ester and a ch@@ ick@@ -@@ fil@@ -@@ a-@@ ke@@ ks , &quot; said sch@@ ro@@ e@@ der , 19 who had the co@@ ven@@ ant .
the financial resources required for the last sem@@ ester would have cost $ 4@@ 30 , he said .
he gave out $ 120 .
the college administration announced that the student would be on average over 1,@@ 200 $ a year for tex@@ t@@ books and study material , and that it would be more than $ 200 for students to use various cost cus@@ hi@@ ons .
online shops and creative approaches such as the sch@@ ro@@ e@@ der are increasingly the solution of choice for students .
ren@@ ting tex@@ t@@ books is becoming more popular , and so students can book a sem@@ ester long , often at a much cheaper price than when buying .
ne@@ eb@@ o inc , which has more than 250 university book@@ stores , announced with the release of the new version of tex@@ t@@ books .
surve@@ ys in the industry show that about a quarter of books in the college book@@ shops were published last spring .
less than half of all tex@@ t@@ books are published according to the national association of college stores in camp@@ us@@ -@@ book@@ stores .
here is the one-@@ off for the best deals .
online buying
some new books cost only one third of the price for which they are sold in the camp@@ us book@@ shop online .
the n@@ in@@ th edition of &quot; cal@@ cul@@ us &quot; v@@ no ron lar@@ won , bru@@ ce ed@@ wards and robert ho@@ re@@ t@@ ler costs almost $ 2@@ 90 , but can be ordered at the specialized book@@ seller che@@ gg@@ .com for 23@@ rd books .
buy used
if you like to receive the notes of other or normal usage tracks , you need to buy a good option .
&quot; cal@@ cul@@ us &quot; is used on che@@ gg@@ .com for $ 9@@ 3.@@ 49 .
mat@@ t cas@@ day , 25 , gradu@@ ate student at bri@@ g@@ ham young university , says that he is on am@@ az@@ on@@ .com 42 c@@ ents .
the book was sold for $ 48 .
aca@@ dem@@ ics such as ing@@ rid br@@ ac@@ ey , head of the university of mass@@ ach@@ us@@ et@@ ts at the am@@ her@@ st college without walls em@@ pa@@ th@@ ic students to make their prof@@ ess@@ ors ask whether they had read earlier issues .
sometimes the updates for the seminar work are not relevant .
in such cases , older edi@@ tions can often be used for a fr@@ action of the cost of the latest edition .
besides che@@ g@@ g and amaz@@ on , hal@@ f@@ .com is also a popular online store for secon@@ d-@@ hand books .
ren@@ ts
ren@@ ting tex@@ t@@ books is worth considering when you want to use them reason@@ ably well , remember that they are returned and they are going to leave the books after the course has been completed .
you can pay more than 80 % of the cost of a newly purchased book .
a student could , for example , use &quot; cal@@ cul@@ us &quot; for a sem@@ ester for about $ 20 .
find out about the terms of the business you rent with , including the penalty fees , which may apply to writing a note or a letter of notice .
ten@@ ants pay attention : if you do not return the book , the penalty fees may exceed the price of a new book .
e-@@ books
e-@@ books , rather than conventional tex@@ t@@ books , are also an option .
sometimes these books are ren@@ ted de fac@@ to by using an electronic license for a certain period of time by whol@@ es@@ al@@ ers such as amaz@@ on@@ .com , che@@ g@@ g and bar@@ nes &amp; no@@ ble inc .
at che@@ g@@ g you can find &quot; cal@@ cul@@ us &quot; for 6 months for about 61 $ .
br@@ ac@@ ey says that students in literature courses often receive the best offers , since many classi@@ cs are downloaded free nowadays , while scientific and engineering students often find the best offers .
look around at each other .
jo@@ e ga@@ ult , 29 , who will soon be the pe@@ p@@ per@@ d@@ ine law school , recomm@@ ends the is@@ b@@ n number for the price determination for b@@ ü@@ cher , because you can be so sure that you have the right teaching .
and before or@@ dering online you should check , so ga@@ ult says , whether the book is in fact in stock .
he learned this lesson from the hard tour .
he bought a book that had four weeks delivery time and finally paid the full price in the college book@@ shop .
why &quot; guar@@ di@@ ans of the gal@@ ax@@ y &quot; no cash battle has been won ?
&quot; the exp@@ and@@ ab@@ les 3 &quot; by sy@@ l@@ ves@@ ter st@@ all@@ one played less than 30 million dollars of his 90 million dollars budget in the us , while &quot; s@@ in city : a lady to kill for &quot; only 12 million dollars .
the new camera control system , designed to meet the needs of the camera di@@ a@@ z , played only 14@@ .@@ 6 million dollars at the opening weekend , while children &apos;s films such as &quot; drag@@ on trees made easily 2 &quot; also dis@@ ap@@ point revenue .
an article of the te@@ leg@@ raph movie cri@@ tic rob@@ bi@@ e col@@ lin suggests that the first children ’ s films were the lack of quality in the films themselves .
col@@ lin called 20@@ 14 &quot; the worst year &quot; so far for children &apos;s films and described &quot; drag@@ on &apos;s coun@@ ting made easy 2 &quot; as purely &quot; functional &quot; fant@@ as@@ y continuation .
for films for a slightly older target group , however , it seems that the quality of the films does not necessarily pose a problem .
in july , entertainment weekly re@@ compared the average cin@@ em@@ as@@ co@@ res and me@@ ta@@ -@@ cri@@ tic rating for each summer movie start , which is between the american mem@@ orial and the american film day on july 20 , 2013 and the current year .
the results are based on the opinion of the cinema visitors and film cri@@ tics , and suggest that this year &apos;s film h@@ its are similar to those of the past year .
some comm@@ ent@@ ators believe that the trend is due to changing visual hab@@ its and growing popul@@ arity of web stre@@ aming services such as net@@ f@@ li@@ x .
director j@@ on fav@@ re@@ au , who is currently working on dis@@ ney &apos;s upcoming jun@@ g@@ le book movie , said to the website ho@@ ll@@ y@@ wood .
we must accept this and not try to follow the past .
unlike the currently weak cash out@@ comes of the ho@@ ll@@ y@@ wood produc@@ tions , net@@ f@@ li@@ x has recently achieved sales of € 3@@ 9.@@ 2 billion ( $ 1.@@ 2 billion ) .
last summer , the director ste@@ ven spi@@ el@@ berg critic@@ ised film studios for not being too bo@@ ld in their focus on film films by com@@ ics and pro@@ p@@ he@@ si@@ ed a &quot; core mel@@ t@@ down &quot; of ho@@ ll@@ y@@ wood .
in the light of the current down@@ turn , some comm@@ ent@@ ators argue that his gri@@ m pro@@ ph@@ ec@@ y may well be a true core .
the new economy will be in a much worse state because of the potential cash sp@@ ill@@ ers that awa@@ it in the summer of 20@@ 15 , including av@@ eng@@ ers : age of ul@@ tr@@ on , mini@@ ons , and jur@@ as@@ sic world .
the producer of x-@@ men , sim@@ on kin@@ berg , described the decline in cash out@@ comes recently as simply &quot; cy@@ clic@@ al &quot; and said to ho@@ ll@@ y@@ wood re@@ porter : &quot; the next summer will be the largest summer on the internet .
when the second table tennis district was opened a few years ago in order to stre@@ am@@ line the league division , the second table tennis district was taken a step in the right direction .
now the german table tennis league has an additional 3rd bun@@ des@@ lig@@ a .
the result : those who have not clim@@ bed have gone down .
for example , g@@ ö@@ tt@@ ingen ’ s highest class team tor@@ pe@@ do has won the prestigious “ best of the year ” in the upper league release but will play only fifth ran@@ king in the coming season .
fourth class of the series , tor@@ pe@@ do ’ s ladies , despite their gran@@ di@@ ose pass@@ age into the regional league .
the bo@@ ys and girls of tor@@ pe@@ do start in the lower sa@@ x@@ ony league , as well as the bo@@ ys of the s@@ c we@@ en@@ de .
the s@@ g hand@@ lers and the tor@@ pe@@ do reserve are entering the new association list .
the tt@@ v ge@@ is@@ mar plays in the association li@@ ga , which is the tor@@ pe@@ do second in the national league .
what the composition looks like a better district class is now the new district class .
t@@ sv si@@ ll@@ ingen , v@@ f@@ b l@@ ö@@ d@@ ing@@ sen , tor@@ pe@@ do iii , ge@@ is@@ mar , ein@@ bec@@ k , ham@@ men@@ ste@@ dt , bo@@ ven@@ der sv , lan@@ gen@@ hol@@ ten@@ sen , the f@@ c .
in the district sli@@ ga play as regional representative d@@ ran@@ s@@ fel@@ d and the s@@ c we@@ en@@ de , in the district class of tt@@ c ii , ro@@ t-@@ wei@@ ß , the bo@@ ven@@ der sv ii and the teams of the team of the t@@ tv .
g@@ ün@@ ter@@ sen , the tt@@ c and the tt@@ v ge@@ is@@ mar ii are here with from the game .
in the district sli@@ ga run tor@@ pe@@ do iii and sat@@ ten@@ haus@@ en / w@@ ö@@ ll@@ mar@@ sha@@ us@@ en .
with nine teams each , each with nine teams ,
the s@@ c we@@ en@@ de sen@@ ds his girls to the small district sli@@ ga .
the district sli@@ ga season of the sc@@ w bo@@ ys - there is still tor@@ pe@@ do ii starting - is not complete .
in a district class ge@@ is@@ mar , tus@@ po we@@ en@@ de and the bo@@ ven@@ der sv go into the season .
in the first season of the newly established regional association , the two g@@ ö@@ tt@@ inger circu@@ lar le@@ ag@@ ues start with nine teams each .
in the west season , the red and white ii , bo@@ ven@@ der sv iii , lau@@ bach ii , tor@@ pe@@ do iv and v , m@@ tv gr@@ one , d@@ ran@@ s@@ fel@@ d s@@ c ii , mi@@ el@@ haus@@ en and mi@@ el@@ en@@ .
in the east season , sa@@ ti@@ e &apos;s / w@@ ö@@ ll@@ mar@@ sha@@ us@@ en , ni@@ ko@@ la@@ us@@ berg and land@@ ol@@ f@@ sha@@ us@@ en , among others , play .
the women &apos;s kre@@ is@@ sli@@ ga consists of sat@@ ten@@ haus@@ en / w@@ ö@@ ll@@ mar@@ sha@@ us@@ en ii , bil@@ sha@@ us@@ en , hem@@ el@@ n , si@@ ll@@ ingen ii , tus@@ po we@@ en@@ de and the s@@ g r@@ hu@@ me .
that is still better than in o@@ ster@@ o@@ de county , where there is no female bre@@ eding team at all .
it is striking that none of the six 2.@@ circle classes should be har@@ der to achieve , and this is where the innovative and ex@@ ci@@ ted circle board of directors will have to worry .
nato summit : first pro@@ tests in new@@ port and car@@ di@@ ff
at the weekend there were pro@@ tests from oppon@@ ents of the nato summit in new@@ port .
on saturday , hundreds of people gathered in the centre of new@@ port to take part in an anti-@@ nato march .
on sunday , around 150 people arrived in car@@ di@@ ff in front of the town hall to find a so-called counter@@ -@@ summit .
ste@@ ph@@ en fair@@ cl@@ ough has been following developments for us at the weekend and has spoken to demonstr@@ ators who , from bri@@ gh@@ tly , have travell@@ ed to belgium .
te@@ en@@ ag@@ ers from the blue mountains flo@@ wn out of the park .
two young bus@@ h@@ wal@@ kers were caught in safety with the ro@@ pe win@@ ch after they had been thro@@ wn into the blue mountains in n@@ s@@ w .
the 16@@ -@@ year-@@ old girl and the 19@@ -@@ year-@@ old man bro@@ ke a go@@ ve@@ t@@ t lea@@ p in black@@ he@@ ath just after sunday lun@@ ch@@ time .
concerned rela@@ tives called for about 8 p.m. the police when the two were not home .
a local search team and a rescue team are bra@@ king on the ground and the couple was reduced to a police station around 11 p.m. near the brid@@ al ve@@ il .
the girl had w@@ oun@@ ded on her k@@ ne@@ e and the man had fallen and had turned his head .
rescue workers remained at the pa@@ irs over@@ night , and they were exp@@ elled on monday morning .
they were built in stable condition with a am@@ bul@@ ance in the blue mountains hospital .
anti-@@ government pro@@ tests in pakistan es@@ cal@@ ate
the approximately 1000 demonstr@@ ators were killed by soldiers from the p@@ tv building , said information minister per@@ v@@ ai@@ z r@@ as@@ hi@@ d .
the station has a good half hour to re@@ sume the broad@@ cast .
p@@ tv director a@@ th@@ ar far@@ o@@ q said that the equipped with stic@@ ks demonstr@@ ators could have used equipment in the ed@@ it@@ orial department .
dead or in@@ ju@@ red have not been reported .
the demonstr@@ ators are calling for the re@@ sign@@ ation of the heads of government , to whom they acc@@ use electoral fraud .
the police told us that about a kil@@ ome@@ tre from the residence of prime minister na@@ wa@@ z shar@@ if , it would be possible to cl@@ ash again on monday with around 3@@ 000 demonstr@@ ators with security forces .
according to hospital data , a polic@@ em@@ an was in@@ ju@@ red .
at the weekend , at least three people were killed and more than 500 in@@ ju@@ red when demonstr@@ ators tried to return to shar@@ if ’ s residence .
they are calling for the re@@ sign@@ ation of the prime minister .
the powerful military had a very strong military presence on sunday evening after a meeting in the headquarters of the army .
it was also stated in the communication : &apos; the army remains committed to its role of guaranteeing the security of the state &apos; .
the es@@ cal@@ ating violence has caused concern about military intervention .
the opposition politici@@ an im@@ ran kh@@ an and the pre@@ ach@@ er ta@@ h@@ ir@@ u@@ l q@@ ad@@ ri ’ s pro@@ tests have las@@ ted since independence day on 14 august .
shar@@ if re@@ jects re@@ sign@@ ation .
kh@@ an and q@@ ad@@ ri had their sup@@ porters called on sunday to stay .
&quot; we will not go back without sh@@ ar@@ if forced to resi@@ gn , &quot; said kh@@ an .
q@@ ad@@ ri was similarly s@@ enti@@ ent .
kh@@ an acc@@ uses shar@@ if of holding the parliamentary election last may by che@@ ating .
q@@ ad@@ ri calls for the re@@ sign@@ ation of central and provin@@ cial governments .
then a transitional government should reform the electoral system and call new elections .
more than 40 000 security forces are in operation to attack the government quarter .
the demonstr@@ ators had initially peace@@ fully demonstrated before parliament that they had been arrested until kh@@ an and q@@ ad@@ ri invited them to do so at the weekend .
h@@ ü@@ t@@ tel@@ dorf after second season victory in third place of the table .
the 2 : 0 over val gar@@ den@@ a has a bit@@ ter week for rapid on sunday .
&quot; victory is very liber@@ ating , &quot; said tra@@ iner z@@ or@@ an bar@@ ic , whose team is in the process of being awarded the european league on thursday an intermedi@@ ate level .
&quot; the success story was terri@@ bly important , &quot; said the captain of the company and tor@@ sch@@ u@@ le ste@@ ff@@ en ho@@ f@@ mann , who was working on the third place with green white .
sch@@ ram@@ me@@ l dre@@ am@@ tor brings rapid to sie@@ ger@@ stra@@ ß@@ e rapid with the second season victory the right response to the dis@@ appointment against hel@@ sin@@ ki showed and goes with a success story .
&quot; we wanted to show a positive response , &quot; said foreign def@@ en@@ der thomas sch@@ ram@@ me@@ l , who was very happy with his magnificent leadership vol@@ ley of the six@@ teenth minute on the 14@@ th minute .
&quot; i thought i had to say all the fru@@ its of thursday and i was s@@ nor@@ ing him .
when the sm@@ ile was on 13 nov@@ member 2010 for the last time in a bun@@ des@@ lig@@ a match , the game was still very popular .
the first ra@@ pi@@ d-@@ dre@@ dge championship will therefore be held in special mem@@ ories .
&quot; for me this is something very special , i am from the rapid youth &quot; , said sch@@ rap@@ mann , a member of the german society for the protection of human rights .
due to the short-term bas@@ ket b@@ lis@@ s@@ age of mari@@ o pa@@ ve@@ lic , sch@@ ram@@ me@@ l moved from the left to the right def@@ ensive side and made his cause very good there too .
he has enough experience that he has also mis@@ led this position .
he deserves the goal , he has already won some assi@@ sts this year , &quot; p@@ raised b@@ ari@@ sic .
team shows character sch@@ ram@@ me@@ l also delivered the f@@ lan@@ k to the 2 : 0 through ho@@ f@@ mann after well an hour , which finally brought the decision .
because before that , guests could have written .
&quot; thank god we have had some lu@@ ck today , &quot; sch@@ ram@@ me@@ l also noted , who was thus waiting for the gap between performance and results in the past few weeks : &quot; the results have not been correct , but that is the game .
bar@@ i@@ sic even found that &quot; in many games you were better than today &quot; - against &quot; the strong@@ est man@@ power , the most powerful in this season at this sta@@ dium &quot; .
the first three-@@ point since 26 july has therefore proved that the team structure is the back@@ l@@ ash despite the set@@ backs .
for him , it is no less gra@@ ti@@ fying : &apos; we have finally played back to zero &apos; .
a lot of work during the country break is also done by the fact that bri@@ an beh@@ ren@@ dt , mari@@ o pa@@ ve@@ lic , chri@@ stop@@ her di@@ bon , den@@ i al@@ ar and michael sch@@ im@@ mel@@ s@@ ber@@ ger have recorded several cases .
&quot; we must not forget this , &quot; he war@@ ned , &quot; he said , that he had been working with beh@@ ren@@ dt and pa@@ ve@@ lic players in the last three days , &quot; he has recently been very stable .
the national p@@ ause must therefore be used to &apos; w@@ ound w@@ ounds and to &apos; break &apos; a little more in the physical sphere &apos; , bar@@ i@@ sic said , who had five u@@ 21 aus@@ wa@@ h@@ la@@ te@@ urs in his home country .
one who probably feels particularly comfortable with the break is captain ho@@ f@@ mann .
he is te@@ aring himself up for the team , going over pain .
it is precisely at this difficult stage that he has shown that he is a very important player for us , &quot; said bar@@ i@@ sic .
ho@@ f@@ mann gave the game rapi@@ ds before his replacement in the 6@@ 8@@ th minute not only the structure but also achieved the second goal .
for the 3@@ 3-@@ year-@@ old who has won his 3@@ 50@@ th bun@@ des@@ lig@@ a game , it was the first match hit since 2 november 2013 ( 4 : 2 on the ad@@ mi@@ ra ) .
ho@@ f@@ mann : &quot; must not believe that now everything is good &quot; , &quot; we certainly have also had a bit of lu@@ ck , but lu@@ ck must come back to us at some point .
now it was high time , &quot; said ho@@ f@@ mann .
but he was too focused to continue working : &quot; you cannot let this always be black and white .
in recent weeks , we have not played as badly as has been suggested .
nor must we believe that everything is good now .
the importance of his role for the team he could not deny .
it is a very young team , which i am currently very able to help .
they are still in my hands in certain ph@@ ases , &quot; said ho@@ f@@ mann .
val gar@@ den@@ a michael bau@@ r and his team had little to re@@ pro@@ ach themselves .
he regre@@ t@@ ted the quick &apos; magic gate &apos; hit , as well as the regular ga@@ te@@ way to nu@@ tz in the 40@@ th minute , which was collected by re@@ fe@@ ree colle@@ gger un@@ ju@@ stly .
the only criticism i have made of the team is that we are heading towards tor in some ph@@ ases not enough .
we have too little qualifications in this area .
maxim@@ ili@@ an kar@@ ner , the internal def@@ en@@ der , saw it similar : &quot; it started badly , but then we found a door and we did it .
by and large , it would have been more in .
there is a f@@ uss under this m@@ ess , a f@@ uss of ru@@ h .
a powerful tri@@ be was shown in our en@@ ig@@ matic task of the summer series &quot; my piece of the rhe@@ in@@ er lu@@ ck &quot; last friday .
several of these trees are still in the county , the illustra@@ ted copy is the &quot; ge@@ i@@ ß@@ ru@@ he@@ ic@@ he &quot; above below the lower wel@@ sh@@ en@@ brun@@ n .
a bu@@ mp@@ y foot@@ path leads up to the approximately 600 year old o@@ ak .
it passes by cou@@ ples , bas@@ alt p@@ its and bas@@ alt stone me@@ ado@@ ws .
a little bit below the quar@@ ry of the bau@@ er@@ s@@ berg , one kil@@ ome@@ tre north of the road to we@@ is@@ bach , it stands .
vital sees the natural mon@@ ument , it rises above the other trees in the area and remin@@ ds with a range of over eight meters of an american m@@ am@@ mo@@ th tree .
a small bud@@ d@@ ha on a tree pl@@ um@@ b indicates that it is a spiritual her@@ o or my@@ s@@ tical place .
but , despite intensive research , there was only evidence of the origin of the name .
dr. wol@@ f@@ gan@@ g sch@@ nei@@ der has created a special consultation with the bis@@ ch@@ of@@ sh@@ ei@@ mer archi@@ v and consulted older people from under@@ wel@@ sh@@ ell@@ brun@@ n to find out what the relationship is with s@@ cour@@ ge .
the result of his research remained the rather so@@ ber explanation for the name .
so , until about 80 years ago , the she@@ ph@@ er@@ ds of the go@@ ats were supposed to have their animals fed up with the mu@@ ch-@@ va@@ un@@ ted and ro@@ c@@ ked me@@ ado@@ ws from stones .
at the foot of the tree , the mountains covered by the as@@ cent are said to have been relaxed .
meanwhile , the sector has reg@@ a@@ ined its importance , because gra@@ zing is actually re@@ appe@@ aring on the me@@ ado@@ ws .
the area is also part of the core area of the bio@@ sphere reserve , has further been found out by sch@@ nei@@ der .
when entering the stone collections , however , be careful not to let the stone you are looking for , because the bas@@ alt war@@ med up by the sun is a popular place of stay for cross users .
a trail leads from under@@ wei@@ ß@@ brun@@ n to the tree , which is hidden .
other routes are indicated , the direction high r@@ ho@@ en up and down to a wider view of the valley .
where is the water@@ burg ?
a water@@ castle that will be sought at our next task , however , is ra@@ rely found at al@@ titude .
the mirror in the di@@ gging gives a good impression of the building , but we have some historical buildings in the district , including the building counter@@ -@@ fe@@ i .

the most beautiful photos will be published .
after weeks of tu@@ g-@@ of-@@ war , italy &apos;s prime minister and president-in-office of the eu , mat@@ te@@ o ren@@ zi , has fought against strong conservative resistance at the eu special summit last week to nom@@ in@@ ate his foreign minister feder@@ ica mo@@ ham@@ ed .

putin demands ki@@ e@@ v to accept the inclusion of &apos; state@@ hood talks &apos; with eastern ukraine .
russian president v@@ la@@ di@@ mir putin demanded russian media reports on sunday that the russian government should not allow the fighting to be won against the separ@@ ati@@ sts in the east of the country and start negotiations directly on &apos; state@@ hood &apos; .
his spo@@ kes@@ man , di@@ mit@@ ri pes@@ ko@@ v , later made it clear that putin did not mean that this was under the control of the separ@@ ati@@ sts in eastern ukraine as part of russia , but that his status with ukraine was new .
putin ’ s appeal to the ki@@ e@@ v government to negotiate on an equal foot@@ ing with pro-@@ russian insur@@ g@@ ents , however , f@@ its with the policy that he has been seem@@ ingly pursuing since the ri@@ ots began five months ago : help for the palestinians .
in an interview with the state television station channel one , putin condemned ukra@@ inian military campaign to re@@ con@@ qu@@ er the country ’ s separ@@ ati@@ st territories .
the kre@@ m@@ lin and the separ@@ ati@@ sts have recently closed the area that was taken as &apos; no@@ vor@@ os@@ si@@ ya &apos; or &apos; ne@@ ur@@ us &apos; , a concept that is remin@@ is@@ cent of pre-@@ revolutionary russian imperi@@ um .
putin pointed out that all those who are in a position to support ukra@@ inian politicians in their election campaign on 26 october were not prepared to do so , and while government groups were supporting civil communities in the areas held by separ@@ ati@@ sts .
&quot; we need to start extensive talks immediately , not only on technical issues , but also on the political organisation of society and the state status of south-@@ east ukraine , in order to protect the interests of the people living there , &quot; he said .
pes@@ ko@@ v said that putin ’ s reference to state@@ hood in the context of greater autonomy was to be seen , which has been supported by the ki@@ e@@ v leadership for months to fear .
only the ukra@@ inian government can offer the necessary autonomy to the eastern territories , pes@@ ko@@ v said .
this is not a question of negotiations between ukraine and russia , as pes@@ ko@@ v said , &apos; because it is not a conflict between russia and ukraine , but an internal conflict in ukraine &apos; .
the kre@@ m@@ lin ’ s spo@@ kes@@ man for correc@@ ting the mis@@ interpretation of putin ’ s remarks under@@ lined the need for leadership by russia in dealing with the separ@@ ati@@ st re@@ bel@@ lion in the east , unlike the direct repres@@ sion of the direct attacks .
moscow would have far greater difficulty in getting the regions of don@@ et@@ sk and lu@@ han@@ sk into eastern ukraine .
the autonomy enjoyed by russian diplom@@ ats in international for@@ a would give regional governments in the ukraine full power to take their own trade agreements and external relations .
the eu &apos;s half-@@ blood island , which was anne@@ xed five months ago , is the home port for most of russia &apos;s na@@ vy and an important commercial port and historic coastal region .
the regions between the ro@@ sto@@ v region in russia and cri@@ me@@ a are also rich in mines , fac@@ tories and foun@@ dri@@ es that contain important components for russian military operations .
ukra@@ inian president pe@@ tr@@ o por@@ o@@ sh@@ en@@ ko suggested , when he opened his office on 7 june , that ukra@@ inian legislation - after new@@ -@@ elections - should be supple@@ mented with constitutional addi@@ tions that would allow the respective territories to be subject to greater control of their finances .
but his notion of autonomy seems to be in sharp contrast to those of the kre@@ m@@ lin and separ@@ ati@@ st re@@ be@@ ls whose armed and re@@ vol@@ ting forces are motivated by moscow .
putin ’ s last request to ki@@ e@@ v to negotiate with separ@@ ati@@ st leaders on an equal foot@@ ing followed a similar request from the us .
the separ@@ ati@@ sts supported by russia took over in the hand@@ -@@ over , which , according to ukra@@ inian security officials , was the first step in a campaign to take over the strategic coastal region to cri@@ me@@ a , to strengthen control of no@@ vo@@ as@@ k .
that is why massive civilian and military preparations have started to prevent mari@@ u@@ pol , a sta@@ h@@ lin industrial producer , from being forced to close down to the port of mar@@ y , which is located between no@@ vo@@ az@@ ov@@ sky and the lake .
por@@ o@@ sh@@ en@@ ko spoke at a meeting of eu leaders in brussels on saturday and ur@@ ged action to prevent another russian aggres@@ sion against ukraine .

thousands of foreign troops and hundreds of foreign tan@@ ks are now on the territory of ukraine .
the eu summit did not decide on concrete actions , the leadership demanded the drafting of further sanctions against russia , which would be impossible to achieve in the event of an un@@ specified es@@ cal@@ ation of the ukra@@ inian crisis .

the film city is in ex@@ ci@@ tement after a series of unique photos of a na@@ ked j@@ enni@@ fer law@@ rence in a h@@ ack@@ ling scand@@ al to obtain cele@@ bri@@ ties on the internet .
the h@@ ack@@ er responsible for this is probably equipped with 60 na@@ ked photos of law@@ rence , star from &quot; the tribute of pan@@ em &quot; and super@@ stars , including the mo@@ del@@ s-@@ k@@ ate up@@ ton and car@@ a de@@ luxe .
the austr@@ ali@@ an ac@@ t@@ res@@ ses te@@ res@@ a pal@@ mer , em@@ ily brow@@ ning , y@@ v@@ on@@ ne stra@@ ho@@ v@@ ski , and gre@@ ck@@ o from mel@@ bour@@ ne were also supposed to have taken private photos due to an ic@@ l@@ oud gap .
there are 10@@ 1 cele@@ bri@@ ties on the list .
the most precious ones who met with gre@@ ck@@ o last month said to conf@@ ession to confi@@ den@@ tic : &quot; it is dis@@ gu@@ sting . &quot;
all private letters and pictures should remain private .
it is a sh@@ ame that private information is sto@@ len and passed on to others .
gre@@ ck@@ o , currently in new york , re@@ porte@@ dly said that a news website said that the h@@ ack was &quot; dis@@ gr@@ ac@@ eful &quot; and that the people affected felt &quot; in@@ ju@@ red &quot; .
the h@@ ack@@ er probably has 30 pictures of pal@@ mer with her ex@@ -@@ friend scot@@ t spe@@ ed@@ man , including two pictures where she was up without in a pool .
the film works of pal@@ mers include &quot; love is inv@@ inci@@ ble &quot; with li@@ am hem@@ s@@ worth .

cy@@ cli@@ sts , jo@@ gg@@ ers and hi@@ kers were on the big fel@@ d@@ berg yesterday at the 8@@ th cycling event and have thus joined the &quot; help for cancer children &quot; association .
the tour , which for one was a tor@@ tu@@ r , was a very easy training for the other .
in one , however , everyone agreed that it was fun .
thomas stu@@ dan@@ ski will be sle@@ eping well last night .
for the first time in his life , the head of the ob@@ er@@ ur@@ sel bre@@ w@@ ery yesterday went on a bike to the fel@@ d@@ berg .
for the good purpose .
the small mus@@ cle cat can be easily cu@@ red , especially as it is not allowed to participate in the 8@@ th cycling race on the big fel@@ d@@ berg in favour of the association &quot; help for cancer children &quot; ( frankfurt ) .
a great thing .
&quot; i know now that i can - fine ! &quot;
small pe@@ ts on the way to the applause cur@@ ve ?
ne@@ e , if i had stopped , why not ?
as thomas stu@@ dan@@ ski , who was responsible for the c@@ du in the ob@@ er@@ ur@@ sel city parliament , many of the 7@@ 18 participants yesterday in the early stages were ag@@ on@@ izing and came close to exhaus@@ tion , but happy .
others , on the other hand , have been easier to cross the 1@@ 1-@@ kil@@ ome@@ tre long distance between ho@@ he@@ mark and fel@@ d@@ berg .
nor@@ man di@@ ess@@ ner , for example ,
the red light bul@@ b of the green politici@@ an - red , red d@@ ress , red bit@@ ch - made a big difference at the start .
he is also the track in a sli@@ de , as n@@ ina ku@@ hn , pres@@ s@@ es@@ pre@@ cher of the city of ob@@ er@@ ur@@ sel , who worked with frank gr@@ ün@@ e@@ is@@ en to get on the road .
the tri@@ athle@@ tes were awarded the &quot; fel@@ d@@ berg cycling &quot; not necessarily a sporting challenge : &quot; here it is about char@@ ity , because there we are happy to be part of it - we would have a exit today anyway &quot; .
on the way , they had been a member of paul w@@ en@@ z@@ el from ob@@ er@@ re@@ i@@ f@@ en@@ berg .
the boy ( 12 ) was in the morning down to ob@@ er@@ ur@@ sel to get back to the height immediately .
the frankfurt fl@@ ori@@ an or@@ nam@@ ent had to leave at 9 a.m. in the morning in the sadd@@ le , &quot; made &quot; the fel@@ d@@ berg twice to go with fun .
the first part of the album was &quot; fr@@ it@@ ten@@ -@@ ton@@ i &quot; .
for the chief of the ob@@ er@@ ur@@ sel k@@ ul@@ t@@ ki@@ os@@ k , cycling through the fel@@ d@@ berg is simply part of the process .
he had a very good experience with his 6.@@ 5-@@ kil@@ o bike .
a cra@@ zy event .
for this purpose - and i am happy to be part of this , &quot; andre@@ as bal@@ z@@ ke said .
the highly trained main@@ zer says that the user is a &quot; ambitious &quot; racing bike .
it must be , because it was the &apos; fix@@ ing wheel &apos; that was used to drive the car , but that is not the case .
the fact that it was going up without a wheel , too , proved not only the 20 hi@@ kers who cros@@ sed the white wall and the fu@@ ch@@ stan@@ z up to the summit , but also a jo@@ gger who was on a cor@@ d .
ber@@ g@@ w@@ ach@@ t-@@ doctor professor vol@@ ker lis@@ ch@@ ke , who with his team , equipped with all@@ wheel bul@@ ly and qu@@ ad , for safety .
the 7@@ 18 participants - and so many as never before - were in groups in the morning .
the hi@@ kers first at 9.@@ 30 a.m.
the first cy@@ cli@@ sts and run@@ ners followed at 10 a.m.
five minutes later , the first mountain bi@@ kers started .
b@@ ent han@@ sen , chairman of the association &quot; cycling on the great fel@@ d@@ berg &quot; , gave the start comm@@ ands and wanted the participants a nice trip .
for next year , he hopes that the route will be able to be extended to the fel@@ d@@ berg to ensure the safety of the participants .
