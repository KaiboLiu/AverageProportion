re@@ consideration of the very american ideal of labour rights as human rights
cong@@ res@@ sm@@ en ke@@ ith el@@ lis@@ on and john le@@ w@@ is have tabled a legislative proposal to improve the organisation of trade unions as citizens &apos; rights .
&quot; like trade unions die , so do the middle class jobs .
i am therefore proud , together with the citizens &apos; rights initiative john le@@ w@@ is , to have the staff authorisation act .
this gr@@ ound@@ breaking law gives workers the same legal opportunities in the event of discrimination on the grounds of the organisation of trade unions as in other forms of discrimination - and thus stops anti-@@ union forces .
the addition of the national employment law to provide an opportunity for discrimination against workers who have been exposed to the organisation of trade union representation , in order to appeal for justice in a civil court - and to avoid compensation or penalties .
but it is certainly not a radical initiative - certainly not in accordance with american standards .
indeed , the best way to understand what is el@@ li@@ son , le@@ w@@ is , and other spon@@ sors is to use the legislative proposal to establish the link back to a very american idea .
despite the set@@ backs that trade unions have been facing in recent years - in wis@@ con@@ s@@ in , mil@@ o@@ se@@ vic and other countries across the country - americans once welcomed countries around the world .
there was a time when millions of americans , including the us , re@@ mem@@ bered when it was building democracy , freedom of speech , freedom of the press and the right of association in one bre@@ ath .
when the united states , after world war ii , occupied japan , general dou@@ gl@@ as mac ar@@ th@@ ur and his staff encouraged the country to adopt a constitution that would ensure that japan would remain a milit@@ ar@@ ised auto@@ cr@@ acy .
with full awareness of the fact that workers and their trade unions are working to create a new japan , they used a language that was explicitly defined as the “ national ” language .
when the united states , after world war ii , occupied germany , general d@@ wi@@ ght david e@@ is@@ en@@ ho@@ wer and his staff ur@@ ged the german@@ s to write a constitution that would ensure that fas@@ c@@ ism would be ad@@ ol@@ f hit@@ ler ’ s .
recogn@@ ising that the workers are willing to organize , and their voice in the new nation , they are encouraged to join the new nation by a clause that explicitly states that the “ no ” side is the right to associ@@ ate .
agreements that restrict this right or aim to prevent it from being implemented are not worth the money .
when the former first lady ele@@ an@@ or roo@@ se@@ vel@@ t was in the chair of the international commission on human rights , which the general declaration of human rights was drafted , as it was signed by the united nations in 194@@ 8 as a global agreement .
americans have for generations accepted the basic pre@@ mise that labour rights are human rights .
when this country reported to other countries how to build civil and democratic societies , it declared that americans would not be allowed to exercise the right to establish a trade union - and that this trade union would then be involved in collective negotiations as equal partners .
after these rights were vio@@ lated in america , it is indeed wise to look at the american ideal again .
like pa@@ st@@ or martin lu@@ ther king j@@ r. 50 years ago , he said :
history is a great teacher .
now everyone knows that the workers &apos; movement is the nation &apos;s strength , not its limits .
by raising living standards for millions of people , work has been mir@@ ac@@ ul@@ ously creating a market for industry and bringing the entire nation to an un@@ imag@@ in@@ able level of production .
those who want to attack work forget these simple tru@@ ths , but history preser@@ ves them .
history re@@ members , and we should do so .
formal recognition of labour rights as human rights - and the extension of protection of citizens &apos; rights as protection against discrimination in the creation of employee representation - is long over@@ due .
ke@@ ith el@@ lis@@ on and john le@@ w@@ is re@@ new the ide@@ als that america has made great in the past , and that have re@@ deemed the promise of democracy .
judge tempor@@ arily stops law that all ab@@ uses of abor@@ tion in loc@@ i@@ si@@ ana are to close .
a us federal judge stopped the trial on sunday for the time being in lou@@ i@@ si@@ ana , which was referred to by lawyers as &apos; pre@@ sum@@ ably closing all five departments of abor@@ tion &apos; .
this measure , which was adopted by bo@@ b@@ by j@@ in@@ dal , govern@@ or of lou@@ i@@ si@@ ana , in june , as a law and which was adopted on 1 september , would require doctors , who are abor@@ tions .
the judge ’ s decision , however , means that doctors are still legally required to carry out abor@@ tions for the time being , while they are requ@@ est@@ ing such a right .
&quot; the pla@@ in@@ ti@@ ffs may continue to work in accordance with the law while they are seeking to obtain these rights , &quot; bun@@ des@@ rich@@ ter john de@@ gra@@ vel@@ les wrote in his judgment .
within a month , a hearing will be organised for the judge to ensure that the law is more permanent .
sup@@ porters of abor@@ tion welcomed the decision to include the latest in a series of jud@@ gments against similar measures and said that doctors would take so much time to get the hospital and hospital records .
&quot; today &apos;s decision means that women in lou@@ i@@ si@@ ana are subjec@@ ted to a de@@ vi@@ ous law that threat@@ ens their health and their rights , &quot; said n@@ ancy nor@@ th@@ up , president and chair of the centre for re@@ productive rights .
it was not immediately clear whether the judgment would also affect doctors from the two clin@@ ics .
lou@@ i@@ si@@ ana is one of 11 countries that have adopted similar laws , and courts have recently adopted such measures in al@@ ab@@ ama and missi@@ ssi@@ pp@@ i for non-@@ constitutional .
key points of a law in tex@@ as that covers most of the remaining clinical and medical clin@@ ics .
sup@@ porters of abor@@ tion and the american college of east asia have been calling for a ban on abor@@ tion , as well as the american medical association .
oppon@@ ents of abor@@ tion argue that the measures should be aimed at protecting women &apos;s health , even though some may have the effect of closing clin@@ ics .
only a doctor who is in lou@@ i@@ si@@ ana has abor@@ tions has a patient &apos;s involvement in the treatment .
if all other doctors in the state are forced to do not carry out abor@@ tions , this doctor would be forced to leave the operation for fear of his safety , the group said .
in your argument against the judgment , representatives of the state of lou@@ i@@ si@@ ana said that they did not allow doctors to take abor@@ tions .
dela@@ yed diagno@@ ses and a lack of access to the best treatment opportunities lead to higher death rates from eg@@ g cancer .
angel@@ ina jo@@ lie and her brother j@@ ames have a video ho@@ sted the show for her mother .
for women in rural areas of australia , there is a higher risk of becoming ti@@ ed to eg@@ g cancer than to women in cities .
researchers analy@@ zed the medical data of more than 1@@ 100 austr@@ ali@@ ans , with e@@ gg@@ s cancer in 2005 being detec@@ ted , and found that only 25 % of the data were available five years after diagno@@ sis .
the research director sus@@ an j@@ ord@@ an of the q@@ im@@ r ber@@ g@@ ho@@ fer medical research institute said that for those who work in rural and remote areas , the state is not the only one .
small study : new medicines could contain l@@ ung and eg@@ g cancer .
researchers investig@@ ated the medical care of women over seven years .
dr. j@@ ord@@ an said that a woman &apos;s age in diagno@@ sis , type of eg@@ g cancer , is a constant concern of existing pre@@ dis@@ positions and social and economic status .
for older women and those whose cancer is used as a diagno@@ sis , it is a good idea to have a vacc@@ ine for the lowest survival rate .
for those who live in rural and remote regions of the state , the ratio of mort@@ ality to death was only 0.@@ 5 % during the study .
although the study did not investigate why outside the city live women with higher prob@@ ability of ic@@ e-@@ po@@ pping cancer died , the study suggests that the disease was caused by a be@@ lated diagno@@ sis and a lack of access to the best treatment centres .
&quot; this disease is best treated by gy@@ na@@ ecological on@@ co@@ logi@@ sts , and these are usually found in larger cities , &quot; said she .
despite the improvement of tele@@ medicine services to meet di@@ stances , the commission proposed a new approach to the problem of distance .
dr. j@@ ord@@ an said that the study is independent of geographical status , and that it is a poor long-term survival rate for women in eg@@ g cancer and under@@ sco@@ red the need for better treatment and prevention .
the rio t@@ into ride to con@@ qu@@ er cancer funding is a study that is being carried out today in the medical journal of australia .
in march 2013 el@@ ish@@ a ne@@ a@@ ve , a young mother of 33 years , was told by the gold coast that she had an aggres@@ sive form of o@@ vari@@ an cancer .
garden centres regret falling house owners , and the number of people in the garden is falling .
the decline , together with an increased reduction in the number of home@@ owners under the age of 35 , could result in tens of thousands of p@@ ounds losing each year if today ’ s young consumers , following a study by the h@@ ta , are treated as described in the financial study .
the report states that ten@@ ants are 55 percent of the amount on average , which is paid to people with homes for their garden .
the increase in people living in highly ur@@ ban@@ ized areas without gardens is a major cause of concern for the popular procedure to use parking areas for as@@ ph@@ alt and the falling demand for garden size .
in london , where more than a quarter of a century of population growth has been recorded , the share of home@@ owners fell from 61 % to 43 % .
the h@@ ta and royal hor@@ tic@@ ul@@ tural society have agreed to the need to improve housing for the elderly and to build small gardens .
gu@@ y bar@@ ter , chief garden advis@@ or for the rh@@ s said : &quot; contain@@ er gar@@ den@@ ers are not available to ten@@ ants , for example , because they sell their plants in a move . &quot;
the h@@ ta report identified the period between 1997 and 2005 as the &apos; golden age &apos; of the garden retail trade due to rising house ownership .
it predic@@ ts a total of eur 1.@@ 2 billion in the market this year , due to the better weather conditions in the winter and the un@@ pleasant weather in march and april last year .

turkey orders us diplom@@ at for sp@@ y report .
the turkish ministry of foreign affairs has given the most senior us diplom@@ ats in the country information on the american and british sp@@ ies that are being carried out in turkey .
vice-president b@@ ü@@ l@@ ent said that the business owner of the us emb@@ ass@@ y and turkish officials will discuss the report on monday .

the main thr@@ ust of the war@@ nings strike is freight transport .
deutsche bahn in n@@ r@@ w announced that it will do everything to make the impact as low as possible .

the prosecu@@ tors issued a letter to the office of the prosecu@@ tor of mall@@ orca on friday of ex@@ tor@@ tion by police and accused of human rights violations in the city of cal@@ vi@@ à .
the head of the cal@@ vi@@ à police at the holiday island of mall@@ orca was arrested following corruption charges by business@@ men and bar@@ -@@ owners in the not@@ ori@@ ous b@@ ing@@ e drinking hot@@ spot .
main commissioner jo@@ s@@ é ant@@ oni@@ o na@@ var@@ ro was arrested following acc@@ us@@ ations of corruption by several business@@ men from pun@@ ta b@@ all@@ ena , the street in which most bars and night@@ clubs in mad@@ ag@@ as@@ car are located .
according to the mall@@ orca daily online newspaper , the an@@ k@@ les laid the office of the public prosecu@@ tor for corru@@ pt practices in mall@@ orca on friday .
two other loc@@ alities were occupied by the spanish guar@@ dia ci@@ vi@@ l in connection with the corru@@ pt authorities of the spanish republic .

&quot; it is no longer about making money , it is about survival , &quot; said one of the business@@ men to the court .
let us make our live@@ li@@ ho@@ ods come out of the game .
we have nothing to lose .
mag@@ alu@@ f made a great effort this summer to make the world a better place for her work because of a vir@@ al you@@ tube video , in which an 18@@ -@@ year-@@ old british tourist was shown to work on 24 men during a sho@@ oting tour fel@@ la@@ ti@@ o .
the island authorities have since tried to prevent the illegal behaviour of alcoho@@ lic be@@ ver@@ ages in mad@@ ag@@ as@@ car .

the first spring day with we@@ t and stor@@ my weather conditions affects flights from the airport of ade@@ la@@ ide .
spring has a southern r@@ ab@@ bit of winter surpris@@ es .
in the evening until 9 p.m. , another 5@@ mm rain fell on the city , after 6.@@ 6@@ mm , which was already at night dro@@ pped to sunday .
the last ra@@ inf@@ all was the result of a series of short , stor@@ my sho@@ wers , including a cast that was just before 8 p.m. and was ra@@ ted for almost 4@@ mm in about 10 minutes .
after last week &apos;s winter had been spent on an early do@@ se of spring , the first few months of the winter season in the city fell to a maximum of only 15@@ .@@ 8 ° c .
the bad weather conditions probably led to the delay in lan@@ ding a river in the area of vir@@ gin airlines from mel@@ bour@@ ne to ade@@ la@@ ide .
the aircraft should have been flying shortly after 7.@@ 30 p.m. , but was taken by a ro@@ ar wind - a su@@ dden change in wind speed or direction over a short distance - and had to start .
wind@@ sur@@ ges reached a height of about 50 km / h on the ground at ade@@ la@@ ide airport .
the flight data showed that the aircraft was also able to fly in a second lan@@ ding and finally , by about 20@@ .@@ 40 , it was ready .
the flight delay caused the aircraft to be dela@@ yed by some other flights , including an em@@ i@@ rates flight from du@@ ba@@ i and a qu@@ an@@ t@@ as flight from sy@@ d@@ ney .
for ade@@ la@@ ide , a new maximum temperature of 16 ° c is predic@@ ted on tuesday , with possible sho@@ wers .
mat@@ thi@@ as says : it is high time to build a great net@@ working network .
given the gal@@ lo@@ ping technical progress that has made our co@@ zy and welcoming home in high-@@ tech , the new h@@ p photo@@ smart c@@ 6@@ 50 is a good example of how to get the best out of it .
while i am writing this , my view of the spir@@ al cable , which is the recei@@ ver with the phone , is falling , and i think : bo@@ ah , like re@@ tr@@ o is that ?
but there is a thought behind this : if the cable were not , the costs would be reduced in a very short time .
in any case , the v@@ agu@@ en@@ ess of the e@@ kel@@ tr@@ onic ( dis@@ gu@@ sting ?
no , ty@@ po@@ s : electronic sector the rule that the world nov@@ el@@ ty of today is electric sc@@ ra@@ p of tomorrow , bought - sold out .
and those who still have a tube tv in the living room , for example , are simply saying that they reject television in principle .
why are these considerations ?
because we are not aware of the pressure on i@@ fa at the radio tower this week , we are once again being totally in@@ competent in matters of electronics .
the lay@@ man who used to use washing machines and cd players blin@@ dly dominated , now does not even understand the purpose of the devices that are equipped with an incredi@@ bly e@@ there@@ al expert spre@@ e in front of him : &quot; connec@@ tic@@ ut .
yes , it &apos;s still possible ?
what should we talk about with people who seem to be volun@@ tar@@ ily extending such quar@@ k ?
basically , the issue has been before us for some 20 years , above all , that we are happy to link our house .
to make the yo@@ gh@@ ur@@ t itself a perfect gift , we have a fire alarm on your vacation in the mal@@ di@@ ves to tell us that it is in the working room that it is burning .
and would it not be wonderful if we could have the air conditioning from our office on our early arrival ... ?
yes , this does require air conditioning .
but a dream will certainly come true soon : we are raising our arms deal@@ er , say your l@@ oud &quot; suc@@ k ! &quot; and to the home the d@@ ust vacu@@ um robo@@ t is going out .
i am wrong .
everything is in the opposite way to a revolution : &apos; the borders between white and brown are not the same as the white goods &apos; .
from daily practice , we also know that if a new fashi@@ on@@ able device is really needed urgently , the battery pack is guaranteed to be empty .
another reason for this is that the spir@@ al cable is not available on the phone , even the next radio shows .
israeli children return to gaza after the war .
thousands of israeli children from the areas near the gaza strip are being forced to return home on monday .
the start of the school brought the war , which was w@@ aged by ro@@ cket laun@@ chers , to southern israel ’ s attention , a feeling of joy and expec@@ tation , but the signs of fighting are still fresh .
in the southern town of ash@@ do@@ d , employees of the &quot; pas@@ ho@@ sh &quot; kin@@ der@@ gar@@ ten , who was att@@ acked by a ro@@ cket , were removed from the camp before the arrival of students &apos; spl@@ it@@ ters from the walls and ce@@ il@@ ings .
&quot; we have a little fear , but are ex@@ ci@@ ted , &quot; said ron@@ it b@@ art , a resid@@ ent in ki@@ b@@ but@@ z sa@@ ad and there eng@@ lish@@ -@@ teacher .
many children in our area urgently need a return to a rout@@ ine .
her 1@@ 1-@@ year-@@ old daughter sh@@ ani b@@ art said that it felt &quot; a bit like cooking &quot; .
&quot; these were difficult times , and we are not out of the house at all , &quot; she said .
president re@@ u@@ ven ri@@ v@@ lin visited the ki@@ b@@ but@@ z near the border with gaza to see his support .
until a ce@@ as@@ e@@ fire ended last week ’ s war , thousands of inhabitants of border communities such as sa@@ ad remained in their homes , or left their homes to live in sa@@ fer areas further away from gaza .
many na@@ h@@ al o@@ z residents , a community near the border with gaza , are in a state where a four-@@ year-@@ old boy is threatened by a palestinian mor@@ tar g@@ ren@@ ade .
the ministry of education announced , about a do@@ zen families were not yet back .
their children were tempor@@ arily taught in other schools .
prime minister ben@@ jam@@ in net@@ any@@ ah@@ u attended a school in s@@ der@@ ot , a border town with gaza that was heavily damaged by palestinian sho@@ cks .
he called on the children to do a lot of learning and said &apos; we will ensure that their knowledge is acquired and offer you security &apos; .
israel and hamas agreed on a joint resolution last tuesday to establish a permanent ce@@ as@@ e@@ fire .
the ce@@ as@@ e@@ fire ensured an immediate end to the fighting ; important problems remain un@@ resolved , as the request of hamas for a suspension of the isra@@ eli@@ -@@ egyp@@ tian bloc@@ k@@ ade of gaza and the re@@ opening of air and sea ports .
israel is calling for hamas to be dis@@ armed and for the bodies of two to be handed over to the israeli army killed during the fighting .
a new round of indirect talks is expected to take place this month in egypt .
in the war , more than 2,@@ 100 palestinians were killed , three-@@ quarters of them civili@@ ans , and at least 4@@ 94 children were killed , according to the estimates of the palestinians and the un .
israel den@@ ies this information and estimates that it is a minimum of half of the killed victims of the bom@@ bing , but it did not provide any concrete evidence of this information .
on the israeli side , 66 soldiers and six civili@@ ans , including a th@@ ai work@@ er , were killed .
hamas and other figh@@ ters in gaza fi@@ red 4.@@ 5@@ 91 r@@ allies , and mur@@ de@@ rers were killed during the fighting .
meanwhile , the israeli military led more than 5@@ ,000 air and air stri@@ kes to the ground .
the israeli attacks damaged or destroyed the thousands of homes in the gaza area and about 25@@ 0,000 people in search of land in more than 100 un schools .
while tens of thousands of people continue to live in the protected areas and the fighting continues , the educational authorities have postpon@@ ed the start of the school year last week .
&quot; i hope the school is soon open again so we can continue learning so as to keep the children in the world and the jewish children , &quot; said mo@@ ham@@ ma@@ d am@@ ara , a 13@@ -@@ year-@@ old boy , who is currently in school .
at the choice of sa@@ x@@ ony : c@@ du@@ -@@ vi@@ ze stro@@ b@@ l provides n@@ p@@ d prohibi@@ tion procedures in question .
given the loss of votes by the n@@ p@@ d in sa@@ x@@ ony , c@@ du@@ -@@ bun@@ des@@ vi@@ ze has called thomas stro@@ b@@ l for an end to the current n@@ p@@ d prohibi@@ tion procedure before the federal constitutional court .
berlin - according to c@@ du@@ -@@ bun@@ des@@ vi@@ ze thomas stro@@ b@@ l , the current prohibi@@ tion proceedings against the n@@ p@@ d should be brought to an end in the federal constitutional court .
&quot; the n@@ p@@ d is doing worse than the last time , &quot; said stro@@ b@@ l , who also had c@@ du state secretary in ba@@ den w@@ ür@@ t@@ tem@@ berg .
this is a welcome development in the right direction and a development that will give me more of a feeling of satisfaction than a result of the political fight against the n@@ p@@ d and not the constitutional court .
the n@@ p@@ d was not present at the vote on sunday at the five percent hur@@ dle .
a first attempt at ban@@ ning the extreme right party was in 2003 , when the government of the republic of china also failed in the n@@ p@@ d ’ s top .
in december 2013 , the federal council submitted a new application to kar@@ ls@@ ru@@ he after long preparation .
the federal government and the bun@@ de@@ sta@@ g did not join .
har@@ burg : t@@ ents for new refugees
the new member states are now being placed in t@@ ents .
the central initial reception for refugees in har@@ burg is bur@@ sting with water from all se@@ ams .
now the home office has three t@@ ents of the red cross next to it .
the regional politicians were only recently informed - they are not enthusi@@ astic .
&quot; this back@@ up action further sti@@ mu@@ lates reservations on the part of the citizens and does not give the local politicians the opportunity to participate construc@@ tively in the human@@ e housing of refugees , &quot; says brit@@ ta her@@ r@@ mann , group leader of the green group .
your party is calling for the district administration of har@@ burg to be able to build houses that are currently un@@ used .
96 refugees can be found in the three t@@ ents .
the reason for the over@@ crow@@ ding in the first picture is the rus@@ h to help see@@ kers - and the fact that the people in the public authorities are not sufficiently available in subsequent facilities .
many refugees therefore remain longer than the regular three months .
house prices have hit the most powerful winter rise in seven years , showing a widely observed growth in the index .
r@@ p data co@@ re@@ lo@@ gic he@@ don@@ ic home value is a global index of home ownership in the austr@@ ali@@ an capital , which rose by 1.@@ 1 % in august , according to r@@ p data from monday .
this increase in total increases in the number of vehicles in june , july and august is 4.@@ 2 percent , the largest increase in the winter months since 2007 .
the annual price increase was $ 10.@@ 9 per cent , more than twice as high as the increase in the 12 months to august 2013 , but the increases in the figure were not even over the country .
the research director of r@@ p data , ti@@ m law@@ less , told us that the sy@@ d@@ ney and mel@@ bour@@ ne had a two-@@ ti@@ er market .
the figures from r@@ p data show that skin care prices in syria are rising in the past year at 16@@ .@@ 1 % .
the following markets are ade@@ la@@ ide , br@@ is@@ ban@@ e and dar@@ win , in which prices are on average five and six percent higher than in the past .
at the other end of the scale is can@@ ber@@ ra , which is the most affected by cuts in government spending , and where prices have fallen by just 1.@@ 4 % over the year .
mr law@@ less also said that the treaty of spring is now a time for the coming months to bring about an increase in the number of property on sale , which will &apos; open up the market to a real test &apos; .
&quot; if you look at the continuing high rate of au@@ ction prices , a generally fast sales price is and the continuing high prices , you will see that the price of the au@@ ction is probably the same .
in a statement to the new press , he contradic@@ ts statements by managing director pe@@ er med@@ au and at@@ te@@ station this , &quot; as a fel@@ d@@ her@@ r &quot; .
the style of the college is not this , it says in the communication .
so the med@@ au family was already &quot; m@@ ün@@ d@@ lich ü@@ ber die an@@ sin@@ nen der ho@@ ch@@ sch@@ u@@ le be@@ u@@ tet w@@ ur@@ de .
the statement that the plans will not be announced until july is definitely wrong , &quot; says po@@ et@@ z@@ l .
at the same time , it points out that the plans are not &apos; preliminary &apos; decisions or even decisions .
the commissioner responsible for access to the narrow road is also responsible for the extension of the narrow road up to the castle , which is less dramatic than the med@@ as fear .
from a nine metr@@ e road , it was not and is not mentioned .
the current situation is 5.@@ 50 metres , which is a metr@@ e wide than before &apos; , explains p@@ ö@@ tz@@ l .
the argument of the med@@ a operators that their free and educational resources are not available in the future is only used by university students .
the room was very small and the bed was very un@@ comfortable .
the people living in the vicinity are thinking about the people who live in the area .
the mountain range children ’ s cri@@ b , located on the site and in front of the house , offers access to the park dec@@ k .
it is more important to remember that &apos; it is not just about the cr@@ è@@ che , but also about the people living in the mouth of the fried@@ rich@@ -@@ stre@@ i@@ b road and the 800 students of the neighbouring real@@ sch@@ u@@ le .
so we are talking about much more than the interests of the individual members of mr med@@ au , &quot; said p@@ ö@@ tz@@ l .
whether the criticism of the paren@@ tal advisory board of the children &apos;s cri@@ b , with the extension of the road , would be one of the few un@@ contam@@ inated spots in co@@ burg &quot; justified , &quot; the reader can decide for himself .
in early october , p@@ ö@@ tz@@ l and the ba@@ um@@ berg state building agency want to introduce the city counc@@ ils on the development of the construction of the university by 2020 , &quot; and in this context to address the importance of the new development &quot; .
pe@@ er med@@ au had a chance to visit the parents of the children &apos;s cri@@ b last week about the plans of the university .
the aim is therefore to facilitate access to the new parking dec@@ k via the camp@@ us and the fried@@ rich@@ -@@ stre@@ i@@ b street , rather than through the me@@ da@@ u mountain .
this would have meant that the narrow road would have to be two-@@ lan@@ e on about one kil@@ ome@@ tre long .
according to estimates by the med@@ a , transport in the park of ho@@ hen@@ f@@ els would be ten@@ -@@ fold .
of about 2000 vehicles a day are mentioned .
from the city side , it has not yet been the intention to express an opinion on the project .
g@@ land@@ or@@ f is a member of the hand@@ ball national team .
hol@@ ger g@@ land@@ or@@ f will no longer be responsible for the dh@@ b team .
the 3@@ 1-@@ year-@@ old from the german bun@@ des@@ lig@@ a s@@ g fl@@ ens@@ bur@@ g-@@ han@@ de@@ wit@@ t was mainly responsible for health problems .
i did not find the decision easy , it was a matter of months .
it is time for me to listen to the signals of my body and to start my career in the national team . &quot;
it is therefore taking stock of 16@@ 7 country games and 5@@ 76 goals for germany in the international ru@@ hr .
because the ro@@ ot@@ -@@ and-@@ branch back@@ room player for the champi@@ ons league winner is from fl@@ ens@@ burg still some years on tor@@ onto .
the ic@@ el@@ and@@ ers , who will be taking their cu@@ t@@ backs for the country games against switzerland on tuesday , introduced g@@ land@@ or@@ f as a &quot; long and good con@@ vers@@ ation .
his ideas and approaches have made me as enthusi@@ astic as they have my long-@@ time fellow players and my success@@ ors .
but for my club i would like to be healthy for the next few years , for longer periods of reg@@ ener@@ ation are needed , the time of the current double load is not allowed .
the left hand had a strong majority in 2012 after a he@@ el inf@@ ection .
because of ach@@ il@@ le@@ sian problems , he had moved from team doctors of the german hand@@ ball federation ( dh@@ b ) to a cor@@ ti@@ s@@ one injec@@ tion .
an emergency operation and two other interven@@ tions followed .
then g@@ land@@ or@@ f had a compla@@ int against the team doctor who had been involved in the dispute with a comparison .
twelve years of professional and ele@@ ven years of national team career are not a matter of track for any body .
i have some health sites that i do not ignore any more .
after three inf@@ ec@@ tious foot sur@@ gery , which took place in short periods in 2012 , the european union has been increasing blood pressure .
this is the case with some other we@@ ar@@ -@@ related complaints .
the first time i noticed that the commission had been involved in the process of ste@@ ering my head , but i cannot dec@@ ei@@ ve my body , &quot; explained g@@ land@@ or@@ f in the interview to the magazine &quot; hand@@ ball time &quot; .
for a com@@ e@@ back , he would only be available in an absolute emergency .
&quot; if all the k@@ nit@@ ting te@@ ars te@@ ar , i am always willing to talk , &quot; explained the double family father to the magazine .
however , i cannot accept the years in which i can play hand@@ ball at one hand .
i must also say that i have been in the hospital for a long time in 2012 , and i have become quite hum@@ ble as far as my health is concerned .
after my career i would like to at least be able to go somewhat straight .
besides the world championship title 2007 and the winner of the champi@@ ons league 20@@ 14 , he won the 2008 ( h@@ s@@ g n@@ ord@@ hor@@ n ) and 2010 ( t@@ b@@ v le@@ m@@ go ) e@@ h@@ f-@@ cup .
in 2012 , he also secured a contract with fl@@ ens@@ burg for the european cup of the cup winners .
german economy in the spring by 0.@@ 2 % fell by 0.@@ 2 % , and the country ’ s economy fell by 0.@@ 2 % .
the crises surrounding the globe have made the german economy more competitive in the second quarter .
gross domestic product ( gdp ) fell by 10 % from april to the end of june 20@@ 14 compared with the prior quarter .
this was the result of the federal statistical office ’ s announcement and confirmed preliminary results .
consumption alone is a source of income for the economy in the spring , while investment fell .
foreign trade , too , has slow@@ ed the economy .
thanks to the strong start of the year , the first six months of the year have seen a total gdp plus of 0.@@ 8 % compared to the second half of 2013 .
hor@@ st@@ mar was the starting point and goal of the &quot; m@@ ün@@ ster@@ land@@ -@@ mo@@ o@@ i@@ ste &quot; , which was first launched on sunday by the bur@@ g@@ man@@ n@@ s@@ stadt .
the city of hor@@ st@@ mar in bur@@ g@@ man@@ n@@ heim experienced an inv@@ asion of dutch &quot; fe@@ at drivers &quot; on sunday .
the largest cycling association in the netherlands , n@@ t@@ f@@ u , organised the so-called &quot; m@@ ün@@ ster@@ lan@@ de mo@@ o@@ i@@ ste &quot; .
it is a question of the biggest cycling tour across the co@@ in@@ ster@@ land , the cycling paradise of the nearby mountains .
more than 1000 participants than@@ ked the participants with their registration at jo@@ s ter hu@@ er@@ ne for organiz@@ ing this tour through the m@@ ün@@ ster@@ land .
the competition is open to all interested parties in various specialist journ@@ als .
we come from the her@@ oes and went over@@ night to participate in this tour .
we would like to welcome the m@@ ün@@ ster@@ land in this way , too , &quot; the cy@@ cli@@ sts were delighted to see the route through the ste@@ in@@ furt , bor@@ ken and co@@ es@@ fel@@ d districts .
after registration at the club of sch@@ ü@@ tz@@ en@@ fr@@ at@@ ern@@ schaft sta .
k@@ ath@@ ar@@ ina went on a small &quot; peace drive &quot; through the city over the wall , where the start was also made .
the route continued , which was planned for three different categories , in the direction of her@@ ren@@ hol@@ z over the sch@@ ö@@ pp@@ inger mountain towards co@@ es@@ fel@@ d and via ha@@ vi@@ x@@ bec@@ k and b@@ ill@@ er@@ bec@@ k back to hor@@ st@@ mar .
on routes of 95 kilometres with 1@@ 17@@ 5 metres of al@@ titude , 120 kilometres with 14@@ 75 metres of al@@ titude and 14@@ 5 kilometres with 17@@ 75 metres of al@@ titude , cy@@ cli@@ sts have demonstrated their good condition .
the food was good and the food was good .
the main organiz@@ er jo@@ s ter hu@@ er@@ ne and may@@ or of he@@ in@@ z l@@ ö@@ l@@ fing were the success of this cycling event .
we are satisfied and it was a nice experience for all concerned .
the organization went without problems and there was no negative inci@@ dents &quot; , dra@@ ws he@@ in@@ z l@@ ö@@ l@@ fing a positive conclusion .
unfortunately , not so many participants , as the organiz@@ er hoped , came what would probably be due to the bad weather forec@@ asts and the mor@@ nings .
&quot; we are facing a new challenge in 20@@ 15 , hopefully in good weather on 30 august or during another weekend , &quot; the cy@@ cli@@ sts promised to go back to munich .
con@@ stan@@ t@@ ine w@@ ec@@ ker &apos;s un@@ scr@@ up@@ ulous honest mem@@ o@@ irs
it is actually more philosoph@@ ical testi@@ mony than bio@@ graphy , which is con@@ stan@@ t@@ ine w@@ ec@@ ker , li@@ e@@ der@@ mach@@ er , paci@@ f@@ ist , poli@@ ti@@ co-@@ safe acti@@ vis@@ t , ex@@ -@@ de@@ tain@@ ee , in &quot; mon@@ k and .
not chron@@ o@@ log@@ ically , but more thought sc@@ ra@@ ps for thought fe@@ eds has the least impact on the political will of the min@@ d-@@ bo@@ gg@@ ling movement born on 1 june 194@@ 7 .
and he is gent@@ le honest : from the on@@ an@@ ie as a gy@@ m@@ na@@ si@@ ast to the la@@ den di@@ gging .
also to show how he himself toler@@ ates tolerance in dealing with his fellow human beings .
the wide range of the rooms also includes ab@@ str@@ act concepts , but the more important ones are : love , soul , e@@ go , being in the now , spirit@@ u@@ ality - all of this he tries to gr@@ as@@ p , in a very philosoph@@ ical but also personal way .
and he also explains his paci@@ f@@ ism , his social criticism , his political commitment - and also , as he does not just have the music ( the opera &apos;s lo@@ ver was named sou@@ l and rock sing@@ er ) .
the latter has the li@@ ver con@@ stan@@ t@@ ine w@@ ec@@ ker also added to the as@@ ce@@ tic mon@@ k who is &quot; replaced by sub@@ tr@@ action &quot; as he says &quot; by being all un@@ necessarily &quot; away &quot; .
between all the highly spiritual views , there are also short an@@ ec@@ do@@ tes to the earth : about sle@@ eping , about a sle@@ eping in a room frequ@@ ented by g@@ is , or a cra@@ zy auto@@ trip , where you can see fron@@ ts .
here , too , he is ru@@ th@@ less honest .
len@@ ny hen@@ ry : my father never put me in the arm .
never said &quot; i love you &quot; , &quot; i love you &quot; , &quot; i love you &quot; .
hen@@ ry was one of seven children of a family of jam@@ a@@ ic@@ an immigrants in du@@ d@@ ley in the mid@@ lands in 195@@ 8 .
his father , who died when hen@@ ry 19 , worked in a factory in which she had a limited relationship .
hen@@ ry is trying for a com@@ edy , ru@@ dy &apos;s rare re@@ hear@@ s@@ als , which are partly based on an imag@@ inary con@@ vers@@ ation with his father and is released from the series on radio 4 .
the sound@@ track is a mix@@ ture of reg@@ ga@@ e and ra@@ p , with lively me@@ lo@@ dies .
but hen@@ ry had to be replaced by some difficult child@@ hood moments .
he visited &quot; many &quot; therap@@ ies after the death of his mother , and hen@@ ry is th@@ ough@@ t@@ ful about his relationship with his father .
it was difficult to know him .
you never saw his face , heard only his voice : &quot; listen to the cr@@ ash .
let your si@@ ster rest in peace .
get away from it !
i will look at cr@@ ick@@ et .
my older bro@@ thers se@@ y@@ m@@ our and hil@@ ton - who have been grown up before i was a child - went to the k@@ nei@@ pe with him and spoke about things like the form of beer glass .
i never had such a con@@ vers@@ ation with him .
a lot of my life he was this serious gu@@ y in the corner , who read the newspaper .
recently opened hen@@ ry a foun@@ dry in du@@ d@@ ley , and although the conditions are better than in the days of his father , he won a one-@@ look at how the company &apos;s life was .
it is now slightly bri@@ ghter , but they are dark , smo@@ ked , deep sty@@ gic lab@@ y@@ r@@ in@@ ths with fl@@ ame stri@@ ps and smo@@ ke and plenty of rus@@ h .
my father used to simply put himself in the bath and then he was slowly heard as he was going to sing .
when i was around there , i realized that i had the long@@ standing experience of doing so .
nevertheless , hen@@ ry grew up as a child without love testi@@ mony from his parents .
my father hu@@ gged me never , he never said &quot; i love you &quot; .
only when my mother died at the end of her life , we began to &quot; i love you , i love you , i love you &quot; to say .
with its own daughter , b@@ ile , with da@@ wn fren@@ ch , he could share the love he felt as a child .
could you ever start with the &quot; i love you &quot; ?
stop talking to me , i am not going to be a fo@@ ol !
pap@@ a , i am 22 !
with da@@ wn fren@@ ch .
why should we not be friends ?
it is a great mother .
it is still with french be@@ fre@@ un@@ de@@ t , with whom he spent 25 years in marriage .
da@@ wn is a good person .
why should we not be friends ?
it is a great mother .
hen@@ ry &apos;s own mother was a di@@ abe@@ tic .
this contributed to their death .
so , when i was very , very over@@ weight and had to treat symp@@ t@@ oms of di@@ abe@@ tes , my doctor said &quot; they must be radical .
so i pul@@ led this fitness and had to take a dr@@ astic di@@ et to reduce the symp@@ t@@ oms .
it is very difficult .
and it is ex@@ hau@@ sting .
nobody li@@ kes to eat car@@ ro@@ ts .
hen@@ ry &apos;s career change may be reflected in his elegant , short-@@ cut bar , which is a popular meeting place for young and old alike .
since he was elected by cri@@ tics for his o@@ th@@ ell@@ o , he has been a member of the theatre .
the com@@ edy &quot; the ir@@ r@@ itation &quot; followed , and then f@@ ences of august wil@@ son .
this is a different experience from the sit@@ com@@ s and com@@ edi@@ a that have been his busy working life .
he began with only 16 years when he was in a factory .
a d@@ j discovered him on stage when he was playing people and playing music .
his television career began in the mid-@@ 197@@ 0s . &quot; i was responsible for a fairly long time the only black im@@ it@@ ator / com@@ edi@@ an on television . &quot;
he learned at work .
i had to face not only the public eye , but also from 197@@ 5 to 198@@ 5 , as i have seen an efficient jo@@ ke nar@@ ra@@ tive machine .
len@@ ny 197@@ 5 at new faces
because his manager has not yet fully respected the stage law at the black and white min@@ stre@@ l show , a light entertainment law program that was used to make people &quot; black &quot; .
my family was very un@@ comfortable .
i some@@ how wish that it never happened , but i am sorry that i am not here .
it was a strange , un@@ pleasant position for me , but i worked on giant projects with and learned how to make a difference with a large audience .
but this &apos; years of awar@@ d-@@ winning light pillar &apos; of the british television industry was also a &apos; big &apos; .
the introduction of figures , which will be the british black culture both mo@@ c@@ ked and celebrated , has enabled hen@@ ry to work in the 198@@ 0s on an alternative com@@ edy circle .
the first line of len@@ ny hen@@ ry show went on broad@@ cast in 198@@ 4 , and in the 199@@ 0s he was among the ch@@ ef of gar@@ re@@ th bla@@ ir .
advertising , docum@@ ent@@ aries , tv series and film roll@@ s have made a name for its next decade , but after its bb@@ c series len@@ ny@@ hen@@ ry@@ .@@ tv 2008 he thought : &quot; what can you do as you go next ?
after that , a docum@@ entary series for radio 4 , entitled what &apos;s so great about ... ?
the first episode was about sha@@ kes@@ pe@@ are .
on sha@@ kes@@ pe@@ are i was really aller@@ gic .
i had never really heard about him at school and i thought he was mostly a doctor &apos;s domain .
so i was very afraid of it .
all of us who inter@@ viewed for the show , peter hall , tre@@ v@@ or n@@ un@@ n , adri@@ an les@@ ter , ju@@ di den@@ ch said &quot; you should do it .
don &apos;t worry if you don &apos;t know what you &apos;re talking about .
take a few of the words in your mouth , and then you will understand why we all have sha@@ kes@@ pe@@ are so love .
hen@@ ry led 20 lines from o@@ th@@ el@@ len last speech for the docum@@ entary and he was enthusi@@ astic .
i felt that i was doing what i could .
it was almost as if someone had finally turned my head up properly .
&quot; that &apos;s what it is all about , it &apos;s a serious thing to take you seriously , get your text , search a little bit .
the sam@@ ples were brut@@ al , and i read this piece for months before we did it .
and it was a success .
they seemed to have a car accident to expect , and that simply did not happen .
and soon he joined the com@@ edy of the f@@ all@@ acies .
suddenly i was in the national theatre and i could hardly believe it .
there was a moment when i thought that &quot; o@@ h , you have not changed . &quot;
there was a technical error and hen@@ ry felt inst@@ inc@@ tive that he could un@@ wind the audience .
&quot; a little voice told me &quot; you have to go over 10 minutes while you are on the computer . &quot;
instead , the stage director , the author of the idea , announced that the idea would go ahead as soon as the problem was resolved .
i went from the stage and something was in me said &quot; o@@ h , god be than@@ k@@ ful &quot; .
i am not responsible for this .
i can leave that to someone else .
&quot; you play in a play , so stay in your role . &quot;
hen@@ ry in f@@ ences at the du@@ ch@@ ess theatre , the royal palace , the royal palace and the royal palace .
the text for f@@ ences was demanding .
pan@@ ic is very good , it strength@@ ens the long@@ ings .
that was also good , so it is like a big sign of the go@@ ds that tell me &quot; that here is your dest@@ iny . &quot;
he says this , of course , with a th@@ under@@ ing voice .
so i stand by it .
i really love that .
i love to live in a sample room .
hen@@ ry , however , still has the head of a com@@ edi@@ an - our con@@ vers@@ ation is about hum@@ or@@ ous out@@ bur@@ sts , while he repeatedly im@@ it@@ ates people .
i have decided not to take stand@@ -@@ up com@@ edy , because i find that it is a very important way of satis@@ fying the situation immediately from a room full of str@@ ang@@ ers .
if you look at it all the time , you are driving in front of a wall .
i sometimes come to the apo@@ llo live , when i feel like i am , but overall there is not so much as i did before .
i ask him if he ever has a stand@@ -@@ up com@@ edy tour again .
the fun i had in a room with a director is that i am not so happy with the beginning , the middle part and the end of a trip - i do not think i am ever going to give up .
is that what he is doing here ?
i think so .
i am a great actor .
it is fun .
you always tell a story , and that is great .
i love stories .
people love stories .
hu@@ thi@@ -@@ re@@ be@@ ls are bloc@@ king streets in y@@ em@@ en ’ s capital city , y@@ em@@ en , the capital , and the capital of y@@ em@@ en .
in the conflict between shi@@ a hu@@ th@@ i re@@ be@@ ls and y@@ em@@ en@@ i ’ s government , the hu@@ th@@ i have become civilian dis@@ o@@ be@@ di@@ ence in the capital , san@@ a@@ a .

according to the online edition of the newspaper &quot; ye@@ men post &quot; , hu@@ thy leader ab@@ dul@@ m@@ ali@@ k al-@@ hu@@ th@@ i had a meeting with the commission on sunday evening .
hu@@ th@@ i threatened to be the first to be elected , according to the sheet , with the conflict es@@ cal@@ ating further if his demands were not met .
the shi@@ a hu@@ th@@ i people are fighting for greater independence from the sun@@ ni regime in y@@ em@@ en and are calling for the government to resi@@ gn .
the people of hu@@ th@@ i are now be@@ sie@@ ging the y@@ em@@ en@@ i capital for just under two weeks .
about 30@@ ,000 re@@ be@@ ls have camps in the large access areas of the island of san@@ a@@ a .

ken@@ ya regi@@ sters officials to &quot; g@@ host workers &quot; and to protect the children of the roma .
ken@@ ya has begun to recru@@ it all civil serv@@ ants bi@@ ome@@ tr@@ ically to be &quot; g@@ host workers &quot; from the sal@@ aries lists of the government .
employees who have been in the company for the next two weeks would not be paid more , was a government statement .
the government susp@@ ects that thousands of people will be killed after they leave the public service , even after they leave .
president u@@ hur@@ u ken@@ y@@ att@@ a promised to make a commitment to the fight against public corruption when he took office in 2013 .
when exam@@ ining the situation at the beginning of this year , it was found that at least 1 million $ ( 7@@ 00@@ ,000 ) per month in payments for g@@ host workers and other ab@@ u@@ sive financial practices were lost .
the government susp@@ ects that sal@@ aries will continue to be paid on accounts after a person has died .
all officials must now be able to obtain a certificate of authentic@@ ity in the next two weeks to ensure that their data on the bi@@ ome@@ tric regi@@ stra@@ tions are received in a government message .
all those who do not do so without a credible apo@@ logy would be hit by the pay list , but the announcement was continued .
&quot; this approach will make a significant contribution to ra@@ tion@@ alising public service by reducing the actual number of officials and also by reducing the pay list on both levels of government .

this was a court ruling that was issued on monday .
in the compla@@ int , it is said that ach@@ en@@ bach had a lot of money in buying works of art and classic cars and that ber@@ th@@ old al@@ bre@@ cht had paid more than the actual purchase prices .
this also meant that the agreed commission was higher .

he was the director of the school for 44 years , 23 of which were the school director .
from this time man@@ f@@ red rich@@ ter knows many st@@ aged pe@@ ter@@ sha@@ us@@ en and k@@ ol@@ l@@ b@@ ach@@ er from their time as a student .
his methods were sometimes un@@ conventional , but always carried by his desire to be the pu@@ p@@ il of the people .
the snow@@ -@@ cap@@ ped mountain is the most famous mountain in the giant mountains .
man@@ f@@ red rich@@ ter lo@@ ves the painting with the mo@@ ti@@ f from his home country .
judge was arrested in 19@@ 30 in tr@@ au@@ ten@@ au / northern bo@@ hem@@ ia , today tr@@ ut@@ no@@ v .
he was already interested in the project after four years at the school of higher education .
one year later , the su@@ de@@ ten german@@ s were taken away from the country .
within half an hour , the family had to leave their homes .
after a few months in a camp , the road went to bav@@ aria in 194@@ 6 - in the wag@@ on .
so it was jud@@ ges in the ob@@ er@@ fran@@ ken sen@@ k@@ endor@@ f .
teacher training took place in b@@ am@@ berg .
man@@ f@@ red rich@@ ter had to be ten kilometres in the next train station six times a week , by train to b@@ am@@ berg , and three kilometres in the distance of the city to school and back in the evening .
after two months , man@@ f@@ red rich@@ ter received a red cross home in b@@ am@@ berg to sleep : together with up to 15 co-@@ sha@@ kers in a sle@@ eping room .
in 195@@ 1 he made the first and in 195@@ 4 after three years of le@@ h@@ ram@@ t@@ san@@ g gradu@@ ate with the second state ex@@ am .
since ob@@ er@@ fran@@ ken is not a free teacher &apos;s place for him , he applied for upper bav@@ aria and came to berlin on november 1 , 195@@ 4 .
the &quot; fr@@ ä@@ u@@ le@@ in room &quot; was his first &quot; servic@@ ed apartment &quot; in the school building .
in 195@@ 8 he moved to the new building of the teacher &apos;s house next to the school and a three-@@ room servic@@ ed apartment .
this house bought man@@ f@@ red rich@@ ter in 1980 , after the school in k@@ ol@@ l@@ bach was dis@@ solved in 196@@ 8 .
until then , there were no more than 100 children in k@@ ol@@ l@@ bach in the pe@@ ter@@ sha@@ us@@ en-@@ k@@ ol@@ l@@ bach school association and five in pe@@ ter@@ sha@@ us@@ en .
from the school year 196@@ 8 / 69 these were published in pe@@ ter@@ sha@@ us@@ en in the current town hall .
when the school association in@@ der@@ s@@ dorf was founded , only the basic school remained in the village .
to avoid a down@@ grade in the now smaller school , the school moved to the new school .
pe@@ ter@@ sha@@ us@@ en grew , however , and so the children and their teachers could learn the modern construction from september 198@@ 2 , which was opened in 1997 after judge reti@@ rement .
man@@ f@@ red rich@@ ter comm@@ ends the un@@ complicated gener@@ os@@ ity of the then may@@ or lu@@ d@@ wi@@ g g@@ ö@@ tz , who was also responsible for building a workshop and enlargement in 1997 .
&quot; may@@ or g@@ ö@@ tz was very scho@@ ol@@ -@@ friendly &quot; , judge than@@ ked .
in his entire career , man@@ f@@ red rich@@ ter never heard the speech of a government representative who was waiting for a lec@@ ture from a school council on justice and justice : &quot; one cannot ever forget the love &quot; .
&quot; we must offer children two things : roots and w@@ ings &quot; , says the current 8@@ 4-@@ year-@@ old .
and he had to learn : &quot; this doesn &apos;t always work &quot; , whether he only met his students or his own six children , is not quite clear .
in any case , jud@@ ges were sometimes un@@ conventional .
if students have checked , they were given no information from him .
at the community &apos;s expense , jud@@ ges had two pa@@ irs of bo@@ x@@ ing glo@@ ves and let the two oppon@@ ents compete against each other , even if there was a ve@@ il .
for the good of the school , jud@@ ges used to have a good relationship with the then may@@ or lu@@ d@@ wi@@ g g@@ ö@@ tz ( c@@ su ) .
this moved the par@@ tis@@ an judge to the court of appe@@ als in 1996 , at least as the last on the c@@ su list .
but jud@@ ges were selected for sixth place and joined the c@@ su .

hr@@ 4-@@ cycling 700 bicycle ri@@ ders will be able to enjoy the beauty of the salz@@ haus@@ en spa park and the sch@@ ot@@ ten sto@@ po@@ vers .
if cy@@ cli@@ sts are on their tour in bad salz@@ haus@@ en or sch@@ ot@@ ten , that is not something special in itself .
on friday , however , the number of people who are still in the mo@@ od , alone , made the impression : the 700 participants of the hr@@ 4 cycle tour together with the accompan@@ ying tro@@ ss enjoyed a break in the lower spa park of bad salzburg and later a party under the sk@@ ies .
under the mo@@ tto &quot; cycling and celebr@@ ating on newly discovered paths between ni@@ d@@ da and k@@ ine@@ g &quot; , participants had a chance to meet in bad vil@@ bel on thursday and to hear a concert by van ba@@ ker &amp; band .
on friday , it was serious : the cy@@ cli@@ sts took the first stage , which is 60 kilometres over fl@@ or@@ stadt to bad salz@@ haus@@ en and further to sch@@ ot@@ ten .
in bad salz@@ haus@@ en , athle@@ tes were invited by may@@ or han@@ s-@@ peter s@@ eu@@ m , who was awarded the bicycle in bad vil@@ bel .
for refres@@ h@@ ment of body and mind , all the good things had been prepared : the women of the ran@@ stadt and ni@@ e@@ der@@ -@@ mo@@ ck@@ stadt had 85 sheets of apple , for the purpose of stret@@ ching , spre@@ ading and dr@@ ying .
&quot; such ca@@ kes can only ba@@ ke farm@@ women , &quot; p@@ raised a particip@@ ant from a@@ ul@@ en@@ di@@ e@@ bach , while he ordered another piece of ca@@ ke .
the hotel is situated in the centre of the city , in the centre of the city , near the famous &quot; s@@ ü@@ ß@@ -@@ ni@@ d@@ da &quot; .

the beautiful ambi@@ ence of the park was relaxing .
a lord also enjoyed a head massage from his partner : &quot; the woman has earned , after all , he has already dro@@ pped off driving bi@@ kes .
meanwhile , the may@@ or and the manager of the company had to work : they were placed at the well in front of the drinking cure house of re@@ porter ra@@ iner jan@@ ke and used the tools to get a good impression on the radio for bad salz@@ haus@@ en .
the most important thing is that you can find the right place for your project .
his pic@@ k@@ up tr@@ uck , where he was able to take over the radio via three tele@@ phones and a radio station with his staff and the 15@@ -@@ member motor@@ cycle season of the police h@@ ess@@ en , was fac@@ e@@ book entries .
&quot; most of the participants come from the rhe@@ in-@@ main region &quot; , he told us that &quot; but also from gi@@ e@@ ß@@ en or ful@@ da , from lau@@ ter@@ bach or the ta@@ un@@ us and even from numerous cities in west ful@@ al .
the number of participants is a bit based on the available over@@ night capacity .
in category i , the participants are accommo@@ dated in hotels , in category ii in group accommodation .
from the spa , the cy@@ cli@@ sts had a good impression of being able to re@@ start after one and a half hours : &quot; b@@ ü@@ ss ! &quot;
&quot; it was beautiful in bad salz@@ haus@@ en ! &quot; they w@@ av@@ ed to f@@ are@@ well .
after arriving in scotland , the group was allowed to take a short break in the snow@@ fall .
but in the evening the cy@@ cli@@ sts were in the id@@ yl@@ lic al@@ te@@ bur@@ g@@ park .

the three showed themselves to be obviously pleased with the &quot; many farm in scotland &quot; .
d@@ j to@@ bi@@ as h@@ agen then announced the dance stage .
the opportunity to move around freely is not missed despite the sports activities .
among the guests were increasingly citizens who were affected by the good mo@@ od as well as the great crow@@ d of cy@@ cli@@ sts .

do@@ z@@ ens of turkish police officers have been arrested for &quot; con@@ spir@@ acy &quot; against the government .
33 police officers were arrested in turkey due to susp@@ ici@@ on of &quot; con@@ spir@@ acy against the government &quot; .
the police authorities did not make immediate comments .
among the de@@ tain@@ e@@ es , 14 senior police officers , reported that hur@@ ric@@ ane mit@@ ch , and the police were in charge of the prison .
some of them were involved in corruption investigations against government officials , including four government ministers last december .
in july , a number of turkish police were arrested for having alle@@ ge@@ dly carried out organised criminal activity .
the turkish president rec@@ ep ta@@ y@@ y@@ ip er@@ do@@ gan ( the then prime minister ) decided to change the way they did as part of the activities that the islam@@ ist cl@@ er@@ gy fe@@ th@@ ul@@ la had directed against him and other people .
not all children in ukraine are returning to school .
schools in almost all ukraine opened on monday ( september 1 ) after the summer holidays .
this day is tradi@@ tionally an important day for families , and like thousands of other ukra@@ inian parents , prime minister ar@@ sen@@ i@@ j j@@ az@@ en@@ ju@@ k brought his daughter to school .
he told waiting journalists that he had not been able to open all schools , that he had decided to open the country for future generations .
the september celebra@@ tions were not held in every school .
the sky is not always peaceful across ukraine .
we must ensure that the sky is peaceful .
the entire ukraine , a huge common ukra@@ inian people &apos;s front , must be open to a peaceful sky .
ale@@ k@@ san pa@@ stu@@ k@@ how , school leader of the school in sla@@ v@@ jan@@ sk , the j@@ az@@ en@@ ju@@ k daughter visited , spoke in russian .
we hope that this will finally be a peaceful one and that children will be given an education that will be useful in the future .
the first day of the new school year is tradi@@ tionally celebrated , with children being bri@@ bed and sti@@ t@@ ched .
with ron@@ a fair@@ head , bb@@ c has perhaps won the great director , who she needs .
it meets with a proud gl@@ ory to@@ w from the banking world , the media management and the inner circle of tory party .
and it has its own fron@@ t-@@ line experience .
her career began at the global management consult@@ ancy ba@@ in and co . , which she has been waiting for to become mor@@ gan stan@@ ley , bom@@ ba@@ di@@ er , ic@@ i and the media world of pe@@ ar@@ s@@ ons .
she has been a member of the board of directors of the financial times for seven years , and has re@@ signed as the chief post of the parent company pe@@ ar@@ son to a younger male colleague .
your compensation was sup@@ pos@@ ed@@ ly nearly £ 1 million .
their political ran@@ king is also solid .
she was appointed david camer@@ on by lord brown , the former chairman of b@@ p , when he was appointed to the board of directors after more private knowledge of wh@@ ite@@ hall : she was appointed advis@@ or of the cab@@ in@@ et .
her hus@@ band is a former tory member of the council .
as early as may , i described the role of the chairman with a po@@ is@@ oned cel@@ lar .
not only is the bb@@ c a huge and complex entity at the heart of public life , but there is also an internal par@@ ado@@ x in its structure .
confidence has two directions : in@@ ward , towards the first guard of its own management hier@@ arch@@ y in bb@@ c , but also towards the outside as a voice of public concern and un@@ rest when things go wrong .
this provides an almost un@@ sustainable du@@ o@@ po@@ ly that is being played after a complete reform .
but what new president would it be ris@@ ky to start ?
it is a difficult task .
and as if that were not enough , many are still interested in keeping the bb@@ c down .
while the competition is getting closer and new technologies are changing old , comfortable col@@ lateral , the ann@@ u@@ ity of the upcoming negotiation of the license fees for the bb@@ c is associated with particular dangers .
for the modest sum of eur 14@@ 5.@@ 50 per year , the british public is buying up what is surely the world ’ s largest media company .
the bb@@ c tells a good story : it says that it has 96 % of all house@@ holds and only 40 pen@@ ce per day .
and it seems that the bb@@ c is on the popul@@ arity scale .
the visual and usage hab@@ its for bb@@ c have changed .
but it remains a very be@@ loved and significant institution .
it needs a considerable chairman - i hope you have taken him .
per@@ ry from tex@@ as says that down@@ gr@@ ading t@@ we@@ et is not authorized .
a t@@ we@@ et from the republic@@ an govern@@ or &apos;s official account is used to create a t@@ we@@ et .
the t@@ we@@ et was deleted later and replaced by another one by per@@ ry &apos;s account , which was the previous shut@@ down .
just a t@@ we@@ et from my account is sent out , which is not from me authorized .
&quot; i approve the t@@ we@@ et and have deleted it , &quot; hi@@ e@@ ß@@ es in der n@@ ä@@ ch@@ ste@@ n n@@ ach@@ fol@@ ge .
per@@ ry staff did not answer questions immediately .
although the t@@ wee@@ ts of per@@ ry ’ s official account were out of date , it was not clear who actually signed up for the feed .
in the former t@@ we@@ et an un@@ favor@@ able picture of the district council of the state of tr@@ av@@ is county , ro@@ se@@ mar@@ y le@@ h@@ m@@ berg was drawn , which was published in april 2013 due to dr@@ un@@ ken@@ ness at the wheel .
per@@ ry put a ve@@ to on financial support for her office when she was ref@@ using to grant re@@ sign@@ ation , leading to a charge of her own personal rights .
the text of the t@@ wee@@ ts is : &apos; i am not always dr@@ un@@ k with the tri@@ ple acceptable alcohol level &apos; . but if i do , i am not compla@@ ining .
i am the dr@@ un@@ k democr@@ at in tex@@ as .
le@@ h@@ m@@ berg ’ s office was not connected with the management of the grand jury ’ s investigation of per@@ ry .
this was done by michael mc@@ cr@@ um , a special prosecu@@ tor from san ant@@ oni@@ o who was elected by a republic@@ an judge .
per@@ ry argu@@ es for not guil@@ ty and called the prosecu@@ tor a political tri@@ bun@@ al .
his highly classical team of legal assi@@ stan@@ ts requested a special status in the case of the judge who was charged .
per@@ ry stopped 7.@@ 5 million $ of government money to the public integrity foundation .
this ve@@ to has provided a public compla@@ int from a lef@@ t-@@ wing wa@@ te@@ ur to the commission .
per@@ ry &apos;s official user account is frequently updated - and sometimes famous .
after winning the election , he was elected to the i@@ ow@@ a election campaign during his presidential candi@@ d@@ acy in 2012 , and per@@ ry went on to spec@@ ulate that he would stop .
ber@@ ke@@ ley explains housing market again for &quot; normal &quot; housing .
one of the most prominent buil@@ ders in london &apos;s history pointed out that the building owner was the owner of the housing market in the south-@@ east of england .
home in the capital were hot and the city was the subject of huge price increases .
ton@@ y pi@@ d@@ g@@ ley , founder and ceo of the high-@@ class bau@@ haus company ber@@ ke@@ ley , said on monday : &quot; since the beginning of the current financial year , the market has been re@@ oriented to normal transaction levels since the peak of 2013 .
the real estate market in london was a key factor during the down@@ turn , as foreign bu@@ yers pus@@ hed into the capital .
according to the cad@@ a@@ str@@ e , the prices in the urban area have fallen by a quarter of the same as last year alone , far more than the average increase in england and wal@@ es as a whole .
the average selling prices at ber@@ ke@@ ley ’ s private , cheap and student offers rose by about a fifth , compared to the same period last year , at the end of april , around £ 4@@ 23@@ ,000 .
a stronger p@@ ound , however , has created real estate ownership in london in recent months for foreign bu@@ yers - some of them are also affected by the introduction of new property taxes and political rhe@@ tor@@ ic to create a possible &quot; villas tax &quot; before the general may .
the london im@@ mobili@@ en@@ bro@@ ker fo@@ x@@ ton war@@ ned in the past week that the mort@@ gage market price report for april , in which weak interest rates were applied , was a good one .
new data from the bank of england on monday show a decline in mort@@ gage l@@ ending in july , which also indicates that the current situation is not improving .
h@@ amp@@ tions international , another real estate agency , correc@@ ted its predic@@ tion for the increase in real estate prices in london for 20@@ 15 to 3 % , on the basis of a already weak@@ er market .
the volume of transactions in the most expensive areas of london , such as ch@@ el@@ sea , may@@ fair and ken@@ sing@@ ton , has now increased by a quarter year , so the mag@@ net bro@@ ker wa el@@ is .
nevertheless , the desire for a home in the capital is not a good thing for ber@@ ke@@ ley , as the su@@ ms due for sales in the fu@@ tures market are more than £ 2.@@ 2 billion .
mr pi@@ d@@ g@@ ley added : &apos; the demand for the right , well-@@ planned product to the best locations in b@@ reg@@ en@@ z remained stable and as a result the sales of the termin@@ als remained stable . &apos;
in june , the company reported that it had 3@@ 7@@ 42 new homes in the year up to the end of april - almost a third more than at the peak in 2007 before the crisis .
the annual de@@ duc@@ tion from the tax income rose by 40 % to £ 2@@ 80 million ann@@ ually , and sales rose by 18 % to £ 1.@@ 6 billion .
in a communication on monday before the company &apos;s annual meeting , mr pi@@ d@@ g@@ ley said that revenues for ber@@ ke@@ ley will be expected to reach the current market share of the current year .
the analy@@ sts agree that the annual management of the pre-@@ tax income is eur 4@@ 50 million .
ber@@ ke@@ ley ’ s shares were in london ’ s trade in the afternoon , at £ 2@@ 3.@@ 96 .
nu@@ de photos from j@@ enni@@ fer law@@ rence through h@@ ack@@ er on the internet published on the internet .
j@@ enni@@ fer law@@ rence performance at the 8@@ 5th os@@ car@@ ver@@ l@@ ä@@ u@@ hun@@ g .
nu@@ de photos of the o@@ sc@@ ar winner jen@@ ni@@ fer la@@ v@@ ren@@ ce were taken online by a h@@ ack@@ er who claimed that the f@@ lic@@ k@@ r &apos;s &quot; master list &quot; was a collection of pictures of 100 more star@@ lets .
a star from &quot; the tri@@ bu@@ tes of pan@@ em &quot; confirmed the event , which was a great success .
the authorities were notified and will follow all those who took the sto@@ len photos of that person .
the photos originally published on the photo sharing page 4@@ ch@@ an are now available in the pdf format .
it is not certain how many of the images are real , although win@@ ste@@ ad , star from &quot; scot@@ t pil@@ gri@@ m against the rest of the world &quot; on t@@ wit@@ ter also condemned the h@@ ack .
&quot; to those of you who look at photos that my hus@@ band and i took years ago in the private environment of our house - i hope you are really satisfied with you &quot; , he wrote .

let us fight against the begin@@ nings .
bu@@ zz@@ feed reported on the late sunday , that a speaker was speaking of pop@@ star@@ s ari@@ ana gran@@ de , the real thing about the alleg@@ ed photos of her ab@@ st@@ in@@ ence .
exclusive ex@@ cer@@ pt from ho@@ ward jac@@ ob@@ son ’ s highly acc@@ laim@@ ed new novel on love and the letter “ j ” .
they dis@@ integrated , so it was best described .
occa@@ sion@@ ally a woman told him that he was too serious , ex@@ hau@@ sting , intensive , di@@ stan@@ ced and perhaps scr@@ at@@ ched .
and sha@@ ke him the hand .
scr@@ at@@ ch brus@@ h he knew .
he was st@@ ac@@ he@@ an , as in i@@ gel , yes .
the last victim of this state of affairs was a straight starting aff@@ air , which was promising .
a@@ il@@ in sol@@ om@@ ons was a trem@@ bling ten@@ der beauty with un@@ t@@ amed hair .
it was accompanied by an older compan@@ ion to the south , who was a ke@@ ver@@ n for her a@@ un@@ t , and who had a p@@ lot in a dam@@ p but par@@ adi@@ si@@ ac@@ al valley , with the name paradise valley .
for several years , no one had lived in the house .
the pi@@ pes were le@@ ak , in the bathrooms were still sp@@ in@@ ning , na@@ ked nec@@ k nec@@ ks had their trac@@ es on all windows and believed that they were owned by the same thing , and the garden was covered with un@@ cr@@ um@@ bs .
it was like the house from a children &apos;s fair@@ y tal@@ e , both threat@@ ening and temp@@ ting , a garden full of secre@@ ts .
por@@ tra@@ it of the author : ho@@ ward jac@@ ob@@ son , whose novel &quot; j &quot; was published at the long@@ list for which man boo@@ ker price 20@@ 14 .
the short@@ list is displayed in the next week .
ke@@ ver@@ n had worked with ail@@ in to keep the cere@@ br@@ al market broken .
your feet are too big .
due to their in@@ he@@ rent aggres@@ si@@ veness , songs of this kind were no longer played on the con@@ sole .
not for@@ bi@@ dden - nothing was so for@@ bi@@ dden - simply not played .
it was successfully ob@@ sole@@ te , as the word ob@@ sole@@ te .
the general taste of what has been done has never been achieved , and how the people have worked in books .
in the eu@@ ph@@ oria of the day , ke@@ ver@@ n began an imag@@ inary piano to play and in a gro@@ b-@@ fun@@ ny se@@ ren@@ ade a@@ il@@ in@@ ns large feet to sing .
a@@ il@@ in did not understand that .
&quot; this was a well-known song of a jazz pi@@ an@@ ist called f@@ ats w@@ all@@ er , &quot; he explained to her and automatically put two fing@@ ers on his li@@ ps .
his father had always done to change the letter j .
it had been a game between him and his father when he was still small .
his father had it with his own father , so he had told .
if you want to add a word to a j without having to use two fing@@ ers over your li@@ ps , it costs you a pen@@ ny .
it was not a very fun@@ ny game at that time , and it was not very fun@@ ny now either .
he knew that this was not expected of him , that was all .
it had to explain what jazz was .
a@@ il@@ in had never heard of anyone .
jazz was also used , even if it was not directly prohibited .
impro@@ vis@@ ation was no longer modern .
it was only room for a single &quot; if &quot; in life .
people wanted to be heard at the beginning of a me@@ lo@@ dy , where they would end .
so is the mind .
his un@@ predic@@ tability made people ner@@ vous .
and jazz was musi@@ cally expres@@ sive , and the music was not so much a matter of time .
although he became 10 years old , without being cont@@ acted by sam@@ my dav@@ is junior , he knew that ke@@ ver@@ n had something to say about jazz from the semi-@@ secret collection of old c@@ ds of his father .
but at least he had to stop a@@ il@@ in expla@@ ining that f@@ ats wh@@ all@@ er was black .
in her age she could probably not remember a time when she was a pop sing@@ er .
again , no laws or constra@@ ints were applied .
a con@@ for@@ man@@ ce society meant that every element of this society was grateful to the principle of group talent - than@@ k@@ fully as the dest@@ iny spa@@ red .
people with a@@ fro@@ -@@ caribbean origin were affected by temper@@ ament and body construction for entertainment and sport .
people who were originally from the indian sub@@ continent were like the indian people with electronics .
what remains of the polish community is a concern of the polish government .
those from the gulf states and the lev@@ ante , whose grand@@ parents did not leave the country quickly than what had happened when it happened , were not able to do so , for fear of fire@@ fighting .
each according to his or her abilities .
as they are only heard of bal@@ la@@ d , it was el@@ in difficult to understand how the insul@@ ts were being used in the words that ke@@ ver@@ n just sent her .
music was an expression of love .
&quot; they are not really off@@ ensive , &quot; said ke@@ ver@@ n .
except perhaps for people whose feet are too big .
my father never met anyone who was off@@ ended , but he loved this song .
he talked too much , but the negl@@ ected garden gave him the tr@@ ick@@ y feeling of security .
nothing could be better for the sound insul@@ ation of the huge coal leaves .
a@@ il@@ in still did not understand .
why would your father love something like this ?
he wanted to say that it was a ju@@ x , but hesit@@ ated to be in your presence again two fing@@ ers to the li@@ ps .
she thought anyway , that the only thing she could do was to be a little strange .
&quot; it seemed fun to him , &quot; he said instead .
she sha@@ ken dis@@ belief and was not able to see the ke@@ ver@@ ns view .
there were many people around the world who saw their un@@ che@@ ered life as a result of their own r@@ ab@@ ies .
there was nothing he would have wanted to see .
&quot; if you say it , &quot; do you mean without convic@@ tion .
but that does not explain yet why you are saying it to me .
she seemed to be honest .
are my feet too big ?
he looked again .
your feet are not so direct .
maybe your an@@ k@@ les , a little bit ...
and tho@@ u sa@@ y@@ est that tho@@ u h@@ ate me , because my an@@ k@@ les are too th@@ ick ?
h@@ ate you ?
of course , i h@@ ate you not .
that is just the st@@ up@@ id song .
he could have said &quot; i love you &quot; , but it was too early for that .
&quot; your th@@ ick an@@ k@@ les are exactly the reason you tell me what you like , &quot; i tried to do it instead .
i am a little per@@ verse .
this did not sound right .
it was fun@@ ny .
if he tried to make com@@ ic , he brought himself to the trouble of many , because he was not familiar with the cal@@ ming char@@ m like his father , which he needed to be the one in jo@@ kes .
perhaps his father also wanted to be cru@@ el .
perhaps he wanted to make a secret of this .
despite his kind eyes .
a@@ il@@ in sol@@ om@@ ons was red and raised in the form of her dec@@ k .
hol@@ under@@ fl@@ ü@@ der wine , so dr@@ un@@ ken@@ ness was no exc@@ use for him .
in their ex@@ ci@@ tement , they seemed to trem@@ ble as pal@@ m@@ we@@ del did in stor@@ m .
&quot; and your th@@ ick head is precisely the reason why i per@@ verse to you .
besides that i didn &apos;t like that .
she was sorry for him , both because of the unnecessary kin@@ dness of his words and the fear that has ar@@ is@@ en in her eyes when she turned against him .
thought she would be sugge@@ sting it ?
she did not tell him about life on the cold northern archi@@ pel@@ ago .
the same huge and ic@@ e-@@ cold ocean bro@@ ke out here as there on the shore .
the same confusion of men with even more th@@ ick skin and conf@@ used hair .
th@@ ick head ?
they would have been a big f@@ ist to her if she had not been fit !
she only cr@@ um@@ bs - k@@ nu@@ t@@ sch@@ en was the most used word for a ero@@ tic an@@ xi@@ ety .
after ke@@ ver@@ n ’ s view , this was an unnecessary re@@ fin@@ ement , because the cr@@ un@@ ch itself was an act of violence .
a@@ il@@ in sol@@ om@@ ons gave him through her body a sign to go .
he was raised from the dec@@ k of the chair like an old man .
she also felt like staying , but the strength of his m@@ our@@ ning surprised her .
that was not the end of the world .
they knew little about it .
she saw him as he was moving away - as was the case with a room on the upper floor her compan@@ ion stood by him - a man who compla@@ ined about something he himself was doing .
ad@@ am leaves the garden , thought she .
she felt a su@@ dden pain for him and men in general , although some had their hands raised against them .
a man turned away from her , his back pra@@ yed , damaged her , be@@ aten and killed her without fighting spirit - why was it a sign of her being in good hands ?
when she was alone again , a@@ il@@ in so@@ lo@@ mon@@ s looked at her feet .
several years before the stories we just told , he worked with nu@@ ss@@ bau@@ m , a smart , and enthusi@@ astic community of 32 years of research in the field of o@@ f@@ now .
&quot; a lot has been done and much still remains to be done , &quot; she wrote , &quot; to the in@@ n@@ ate aggres@@ si@@ veness of a people , which is a thousand wars and which most of them won , especially in the united states .
but some features are in@@ es@@ capable , and the fact that they are not ext@@ inc@@ t is a sign of the fact that they are not .
the higher the church tower , it seems , the lower the passion for the church .
the population is cr@@ ying s@@ enti@@ mental bal@@ la@@ den , rob@@ bing itself of stories about over@@ w@@ oun@@ ded difficulties , and claim@@ ing to be firmly committed to the virtu@@ es of marriage and family life , but still not only the former .
&quot; they have an unfortunate tend@@ ency to ex@@ ag@@ ger@@ ate , &quot; said their ment@@ or , when he was reading the whole report .
i propose that you should be less nov@@ els .
es@@ me n@@ us@@ s@@ bau@@ m lo@@ wered her head .
i must also ask : are you a@@ the@@ ist ?
&quot; i think i don &apos;t have to say that &quot; answered es@@ me n@@ us@@ s@@ bau@@ m .
are you les@@ bian ?
again , es@@ me reported on her right to privacy and refused to accept the statement .
fem@@ in@@ ist ?
silence again .
&quot; i don &apos;t ask that , &quot; said lu@@ ther r@@ ab@@ in@@ o@@ wit@@ z , &quot; because i am against a@@ the@@ ism , les@@ b@@ ent@@ um , or fem@@ in@@ ism .
this is an pre@@ jud@@ ice free job .
we are serving pre@@ jud@@ ice free society .
but certain types of hyper@@ sensi@@ tivity that are in itself totally acceptable and comm@@ end@@ able can be considered occa@@ sion@@ ally results , as they have presented .
you yourself have obviously expressed pre@@ jud@@ ices against the church , and these things you call &apos; dis@@ proportion@@ ate &apos; and &apos; raw &apos; are not acceptable to others as well as to the expression of a natural strength and vit@@ ality .
if you continue to walk around , what happens is not the case .
es@@ me n@@ us@@ s@@ bau@@ m looked around while r@@ ab@@ in@@ o@@ wit@@ z spoke .
behind his head , a led letter repeated in fl@@ am@@ ing@@ or@@ os@@ a the advice that o@@ f@@ no@@ w gave to the country in the last quarter century or longer .
sm@@ ile on your neighb@@ our , value your partner , listen to bal@@ lo@@ ons , visit music clubs and enjoy the best of your time , talk , explain your ideas and listen to your friends .
speaking is better than silence , the common word is better than the word written .
&quot; i understand absolutely what you want to go out , &quot; es@@ me n@@ us@@ s@@ bau@@ m rep@@ lied with a quiet voice when she was sure that her superior would end up speaking , &quot; and i say nothing else , than that we are .
my concern is that without pre@@ warning , we may not be able to find out how we can repeat the mistakes that were made at all about what happened when it happened .
this time , however , it is not the others that we are trying to share our an@@ ger and mi@@ str@@ ust .
lu@@ ther r@@ ab@@ in@@ o@@ wit@@ z formed a py@@ ram@@ id with his hands .
in order to achieve an en@@ gel pati@@ ence .
&quot; they go too far , &quot; he said , &quot; if they act as &quot; mistake &quot; , which our grand@@ parents might or may not have committed .
they also go too far if they say that this is their &quot; an@@ ger &quot; and their &quot; mi@@ str@@ ust &quot; of &quot; others &quot; .
it should not be necessary to tell someone in your position that you are not in the process of understanding the past , as in the case of protecting the present , of &apos; us &apos; and &apos; others &apos; .
there was no &apos; we &apos; and there were no &apos; others &apos; .
it was a time of dis@@ order , that is all we know .
&quot; of that if we hon@@ est@@ ly to ourselves , &quot; d@@ ared es@@ me to throw &quot; no part of society can claim to be good .
i am not compla@@ ining to anyone .
whether it is bad or good , what has happened has happened .
that was then .
nothing more needs to be said about this - we are in agreement on that .
and just like no blame must be assigned , so no blame must be paid .
but what is the point of the past if we do not learn from it - and i am not saying this - if we do not learn from it - what is to be done - if we do not learn from it - what is to be done ?
the past serves to make us forget them .
if i may say something about this - and i am not going to repeat what i said - i would like to make a comment on it , as mr po@@ et@@ tering has already said - i would like to make a comment on this point .
lu@@ ther r@@ ab@@ in@@ o@@ wit@@ z left his py@@ ram@@ id collap@@ sed .
&quot; i will take your report on board , &quot; he said and dis@@ missed it .
the next day , when you were ready to work as usual , it was taken by a motor@@ cy@@ c@@ list who , like pas@@ ser@@ s-@@ by , was in a kind of &apos; brut@@ al r@@ age &apos; on the way .
coinci@@ dence exists .
les@@ o@@ th@@ o &apos;s military member says that no cou@@ p d &apos;@@ é@@ t@@ at is planned ; prime minister remains in south africa ; prime minister remains in south africa .
military officials in les@@ o@@ th@@ o dispu@@ ted the need to establish a cou@@ p d &apos;@@ é@@ t@@ at to over@@ turn the government , saying that they were against polic@@ em@@ en who had been denied the arm@@ ament of political fan@@ a@@ tics .
prime minister thomas th@@ ab@@ ane f@@ led the country and said that the army of the country had lost his office .
the premier brought his family to the ad@@ jac@@ ent south africa after being att@@ acked by the threat of attacks .
military spo@@ kes@@ men major n@@ tele@@ le n@@ to@@ i said that there is de fac@@ to no cou@@ p d &apos;@@ é@@ t@@ at , but that the military respon@@ ded to the threat of &quot; political fan@@ a@@ tics &quot; whose occupation is still un@@ armed .
&quot; what happened this morning was that the staff of defence forces of les@@ o@@ th@@ o acted , after he had sent several intelligence reports .
the south african government spo@@ kes@@ man cla@@ y@@ son mon@@ y@@ ela said that the military action has the impression of a cou@@ p .
&quot; even if no one has claimed that the government was tor@@ n down by violence , everyone &apos;s reports are agreed that the activities of the defence forces of les@@ o@@ th@@ o have so far shown signs of a cou@@ p d &apos;@@ é@@ t@@ at .
the military spo@@ kes@@ man of les@@ o@@ th@@ o announced on sunday that the soldiers would be in their bar@@ r@@ acks .
in the meantime , the vice-president mo@@ th@@ ley will take over the management of the company during th@@ ab@@ an@@ es ’ absence .
th@@ ab@@ ane announced that he believed that he was in prison for trying to get rid of corruption in the country .
in les@@ o@@ th@@ o , there have been great ten@@ sions since june , following the fact that th@@ ab@@ ane parliamentary sit@@ t@@ ings suspended due to the disputes in his unity government .
he said that his actions had not under@@ min@@ ed the government , that other acc@@ us@@ ations had been made .
production in the eurozone on a 13@@ -@@ month low
the increase in production in the eurozone slow@@ ed by a quarter of the year in august , and the growth in the eurozone was precisely the same .
the final mark@@ er purchasing manager index of the producer &apos;s trade ( p@@ mi ) will fall to the bottom of 5@@ 0.@@ 7 in august , after a bo@@ oth of 5@@ 1.@@ 8 in july .
a 50 or more indicates an expansion .
new orders have been received and fac@@ tories have been hit by a period of rising tension between the eu and russia over ukraine .
the figures are not available before the meeting of the european central bank ( ecb ) on thursday .
the markets expect the bank to draw up a clear plan for dealing with a re@@ luc@@ t@@ ant recovery in the eurozone , and for the im@@ pending de@@ fl@@ ation at an inflation rate of only 0.@@ 3 % .
there is spec@@ ulation that the head of the ecb , mari@@ o drag@@ hi , will be in the process of providing further information this week as to whether he will be able to make a quanti@@ tative eas@@ ing for the eurozone , in line with that of the united kingdom .
&quot; although small growth is better than no growth at all , the bra@@ kes on growth are the most important factor in the economic and geo@@ political un@@ certain@@ ties facing manufacturers , &quot; said ro@@ b do@@ b@@ son , managing econom@@ ist at mark@@ it .
the factory p@@ mi for germany , the largest trading partner in russia in the eu , fell to the lowest level in 11 months with 5@@ 1.@@ 4 .
in the meantime , the second half of the world ’ s economy fell by the time the p@@ mi was built , france dro@@ pped to 4@@ 6.@@ 9 .
france remains a trou@@ bl@@ es@@ ome child , as is italy ’ s decline from a solid expansion to stag@@ nation .
evidence that growth rates are higher in the key index than in the us and the us .
the decline in industry probably fuels the fire of analy@@ sts who want to avoid further monetary or fiscal stimul@@ us .
one positive news came from the republic of ireland , where the p@@ mi was rising to 5@@ 7.@@ 3 , the highest level since the end of 1999 .
ho@@ ward ar@@ cher , chief econom@@ ist at i@@ h@@ s global insight , has said : &quot; the best thing that can be done for purchasing management is to buy a product .
he added : &apos; producers in the eurozone find life difficult at the moment , obviously , because the current elev@@ ated geo@@ political ten@@ sions - especially with regard to russia and ukraine - are creating uncertainty in the still difficult conditions in many countries .
these increased un@@ certain@@ ties have clearly made the economy more vulnerable , especially in the case of consumer confidence , and pre@@ sum@@ ably lead to the delay in some orders or even to the cancellation of large orders , in particular large orders .
he said that there is &apos; more and more likely &apos; that the ecb will eventually become a kind of q@@ e that is &apos; although we susp@@ ect that this is limited &apos; .
the hel@@ l decade of the survi@@ v@@ ors of bes@@ lan : ten years have passed since the terrible sie@@ ge of the school , as the people who were tr@@ app@@ ed there are still suffering .
ten years ago , more than 1 000 people were killed by chec@@ hen mil@@ i@@ ti@@ as in a school in bes@@ lan in southern sudan .
more than 3@@ 30 people , more than half of them children , were killed in the three-@@ day mar@@ ty@@ ri@@ um that sho@@ c@@ ked the world .
we are in bes@@ lan and we will be back to help find some of the victims who have died in the at@@ ro@@ cities in the class@@ room .
exactly a decade after the app@@ alling sie@@ ge of the school of bes@@ lan , where 3@@ 34 people were killed , including 18@@ 6 children , the police war@@ ned the her@@ o@@ ic survi@@ v@@ ors last night of a new apo@@ c@@ aly@@ pse .
as fan@@ a@@ tical islam@@ ist terrorists , children and parents were killed on 1 september 2004 , the start of a new school year , and killed , a few months ago , like the most evil one .
the tragedy united west and east in ab@@ hor@@ rence , and it transformed the west into a more surprising , more violent act and hope .
ten years later , we moved back to bes@@ lan to meet some of the victims who were victims of death in the at@@ ro@@ cities in the class@@ room .
we found surprising young people who were resi@@ sting , who were still re@@ mem@@ bered these terrorist c@@ ess@@ ation .
their greatest hope ?
the fact that the war that has now struck ukraine - and in which children like them die - is now coming to an end .
the girl who tried to sho@@ ot , in the cere@@ mony , was shot in the sh@@ at@@ tered school sports hall .
it was founded by the russian star photograph@@ er di@@ mit@@ ri be@@ li@@ ak@@ ov and famous for being a mere reference .
it is quite conf@@ using to look for her mother lar@@ is@@ sa , now 40 years old .
both were held dead , but they survi@@ ved .
&quot; a woman told me i should be concerned about my life , but i could not , &quot; said a@@ id@@ a at the time .
my leg@@ s were bloo@@ d@@ filled .
i stood up and clim@@ bed back into the mountain to get to my mother .
a soldi@@ er brought them to safety .
after a series of operations she decided to stay completely heal@@ ed , but said yesterday : &quot; three months ago , the pain returned .
i fear that i will be operating again .
some p@@ it spl@@ it@@ ters are still in my k@@ ne@@ e .
its aim is to help d@@ enti@@ sts who have been diagno@@ sed with d@@ enti@@ stry and have been treated with care .
&quot; this tragedy changed my life , but it made me not broken .
&quot; this happened to me , and you cannot change it .
once a year i go to the sports hall to meet the people who are here .
my friends and i try to be un@@ happy about it on other days .
the pain is too great .
my best friend and future class mates are the d@@ zer@@ a g@@ ap@@ i@@ eva .
we played together when we were small , and dre@@ amed of being together to school .
&quot; i don &apos;t want to mar@@ ry until i finish my studies and start my career .
i am thinking of a family later .
she says that the sie@@ ge is always a part of it , although the memory is something weak every year .
i am glad that many people around the world are still remin@@ ding themselves of our hor@@ r@@ ors and we are so grateful for the help we have received from people in britain and everywhere .
when i up@@ load the photo online from me , how i can clim@@ b back to school , i think that many people will see it for the first time , understand our catastro@@ ph@@ e and help not to do it again .
the boy who was shot by the ball h@@ ag@@ el in the opinion that his mother was dead was dead .
it was his first day of school ( rus@@ sians go to school at the age of 7 ) and survi@@ ved the three-@@ day sie@@ ge in the poor of his mother tam@@ ara .
as a se@@ ven@@ -@@ year-@@ old he said : &apos; m@@ ama told me that i should lie down when there is an explo@@ sion , and her hand should hold . &apos;
after an explo@@ sion he thought she would die .
she said to him : &quot; run . &quot;
they are afraid that they can be dead , f@@ led and saw on the way a we@@ eping inf@@ ant , took it to their hands and f@@ led through a b@@ all@@ h@@ ag@@ el .
his father v@@ la@@ di@@ mir , who was able to put his son out into the arms , said : &apos; dam@@ ir told me that his mother had died .
he said : &apos; i could not save them . &apos;
in reality , tam@@ ara was outside and was not able to get into the hospital with le@@ g in@@ jur@@ ies , in turn assum@@ ing that her son had died .
after their re@@ unification , she said : &quot; i we@@ pt for joy .
i could not believe it .
he ran in and hu@@ gged the people .
dam@@ ir was later f@@ led to london ( from the now dis@@ solved newspaper news of the world ) to be taken from the then premier ton@@ y bla@@ ir and his wife ch@@ eri@@ e to the title of a bar@@ nar@@ do &apos;s children &apos;s .
&quot; this hor@@ ror is following you every day , but i wish i could with the re@@ mem@@ br@@ ance , &quot; he said yesterday .
but i can say that in my memory , it is more pal@@ at@@ able .
i still know that i will be able to buy all my to@@ ys immediately after that .
but now i can play computer games with sho@@ ts and that &apos;s for me no problem .
&quot; i am not afraid to go to the sports hall , but i think not about me .
i remember this children , with whom i spoke in the court , and the children who did not go out .
we never say that they have been killed or killed .
we say that they are not allowed to stay in the sports hall .
i remember very well my trip to london , especially the united states to@@ y store , where i bought everything .
but now he is afraid of place like ukraine , where wars are the kind of disaster that is caused by him and his friends .
this hor@@ ror is following you every day , but i wish i could stop , i could stop remin@@ ding you of it .
&quot; i am so sorry for all those who are suffering the hor@@ r@@ ors , &quot; said dam@@ ir , who last week was volunte@@ ering in a monaster@@ y .
i am happy to help .
i will one day go to the police and hope that you will be able to attend the school next year .
his mother tam@@ ara , 48 , said : &quot; 37 children from our neighbourhood were killed .
i remember the terrible tragedy of the silence following the sie@@ ge , there were simply no children who were calling and sh@@ ou@@ ting , and these silent people were taking many months to get there .
it re@@ members vi@@ vi@@ dly the journey to london with dam@@ ir .
the people of london we@@ pt when i learned our history .
i understood then how people around the world would think of our feel@@ ings .
she was ch@@ eri@@ e bla@@ ir and her foundation grateful for the price and the opportunity to travel to london in autumn 2004 .
i wish i could ch@@ eri@@ e call and just give her a call and say that 10 years have passed , but i still remember the meeting i had with her and her hus@@ band in london , and how the dam@@ ir and myself helped .
i remember when the first woman in the street was born in bor@@ sch@@ ts@@ ch and she was a friend of all the local russian restaurants .
i remember how he was working with cell@@ ars in a restaurant , and dam@@ ir shot with his water pi@@ st@@ ol on them and they ran away .
and that was just one month after the hor@@ ror .
i was surprised that the british were so willing to accept our pain .
she said : &apos; i always think that this world has been un@@ be@@ ar@@ able in these 10 years .
in ukraine , the war is now continuing , and every day people die , and i believe that many children have been killed and are still being killed .
these are exactly the children like ours .
i think that for many of the war , part of the news you hear when you are bo@@ red .
i simply know what these people feel , the whole hor@@ ror .
and i cannot stop saying that .
nothing has changed , people want to stay mu@@ tually killing and trying to do it is so sad .
dam@@ ir became great and is a very gent@@ le and quiet young , he is not aggres@@ sive at all or an@@ gr@@ y .
for example , he is not looking for reven@@ ge , he is not overwhel@@ med by the past hor@@ r@@ ors .
i know that he does not like to recall it , but he has six close friends from the class and they occa@@ sion@@ ally go to the sports hall and infl@@ ate there c@@ and@@ les .
when he was smaller , he suffered - i remember the last time he was in the house of comm@@ ons , which he had to leave on his face , face for hours .
not sle@@ eping , his eyes were open .
i also remember that the council all expressed its arms and other military games .
i can hardly believe that i spent a few hours so sure that he was dead and i would never have seen him again .
when i was in the after@@ mat@@ h of the explo@@ sion and came on my feet , i looked around and saw the hel@@ l around me , with around me , with all parts of the body .
i was absolutely sure that my little boy was in this hel@@ l impossible to survive .
&quot; i remember that i told him that he was going to be a sla@@ ve , &quot; dam@@ ir , lau@@ f , lau@@ f we@@ g &quot; , but i was so sure he had not heard me .
but he has heard it and he has gone away .
and so goes life , unlike that of many others , for us .
geor@@ gi@@ j il@@ y@@ in , 17
the boy whose terrible image after the sie@@ ge became the symbol of the ab@@ om@@ inations of bes@@ lan was be@@ aten and be@@ aten .
comfort : the bes@@ lan over@@ life is a geor@@ gi@@ j ly@@ in with his mother fa@@ tim@@ a after the sie@@ ge of 2004 , on the right a picture of geor@@ gi@@ j today .
his blood flow is a result of fear , but he was not afraid to take part in the trial .
his image was one of the most sho@@ cking symb@@ ols of the bar@@ bar@@ ism of bes@@ lan .
his mother fa@@ tim@@ a , 54 , a doctor , had appointed him for his first day at school before she could go out .
&quot; i left the court about two minutes before the terrorists took him to the court , and so the man in my small room remained there for three terrible days alone , &quot; she rec@@ alls .
not entirely alone , there was a whole family of rela@@ tives of us , but they were all killed .
only my geor@@ gi@@ j managed to survive .
the closer this date approaches , the har@@ der it is to remember and to decide what it is .
there is not a single day when we cannot remember this tragedy .
we do not think it is long ago , i think it would have happened yesterday , some scenes from these days are still following me .
no one will ever forget that , i promise you .
i would like to make it clear that geor@@ gi@@ j ( left ) was one of the most sho@@ cking of the attack and was described as a stat@@ ue ( right ) .
i remember that george w. bush was in power on that day .
i knew that the first day he was alive when i saw him on television .
and now there are even this stat@@ ue of the we@@ eping geor@@ gi@@ j in san mar@@ ino .
geor@@ gi@@ j does not like the picture , and it is at home in the book@@ shel@@ f .
i understand that , but i also think that the people of the world are right , thanks to this image , to feel our pain .
geor@@ gi@@ j says today : &apos; it is important to avoid this kind of thing again .
&quot; i doubt that we will ever be able to find the truth .
people are investig@@ ating such trag@@ e@@ dies time and time again and never get to know the truth .
and now they are investig@@ ating the cr@@ ash of this bo@@ eing in ukraine .
will we ever know what caused it ?
this world is becoming something terrible .
&quot; i cannot understand how that is possible , because if you want to ask people , nobody wants a war , so how is that happening ?
ten years is not a time for such pain .
we need do@@ z@@ ens of years to make it a little forgotten .
it has att@@ acked my health and i still feel it .
about three or four years ago i had a few night@@ ma@@ res because of the sie@@ ge , but then it became better .
i went later in 2004 to school again and had every day fear .
i thought of my friends and class@@ mates , who were killed , but i was not sure if i could .
i am therefore always going to the sports hall when 1 september approaches .
i want to use my old child@@ hood friend a tribute .
it is difficult for me to go to the sports hall , but i have to do it .
i do not feel as a victim , this story is now part of my past .
i will not forget it , but i am sorry not to be so .
my life continues .
i have this year finished school and i visit a medical college in v@@ la@@ di@@ ka@@ v@@ ka@@ z .
i will be a heart sur@@ ge@@ on .
my first choice was to train in the army .
i wanted to become a soldi@@ er , but my health did not allow that .
i wanted to fight for my country , but that will not happen .
geor@@ gi@@ j f@@ ani@@ e@@ v , 20
the boy who survi@@ ved , though he was at the foot of a mur@@ der@@ ous terrorist , was a prison@@ er of war .
one mir@@ acle : geor@@ gi@@ j f@@ ani@@ e@@ v was a prison@@ er during the sie@@ ge at the foot of a mur@@ der@@ ous terrorist , but he managed to survive .
during the sie@@ ge he was in the sports hall and s@@ its next to the bom@@ b that was at the foot of a mur@@ der@@ ous terrorist .
it is a real wonder that he has not been killed .
&quot; we feel it is as if it were yesterday , &quot; says geor@@ gi@@ j , who is a intelligence officer on the f@@ s@@ b , but this is because of his health damage due to the sie@@ ge .
it is still with me , it is not something i am left behind .
i am now older and people say that children are easily inf@@ ected with bad experiences - i have to say that is not true .
&quot; in 2006 i worked with psycho@@ logi@@ sts and felt really better after that , but i can not forget it .
i would like to forget .
2005 - in the year after - the first and only time i was back in the sports hall .
i lost the consci@@ ousness .
i will never return to that and ask me if i can tell you that i am not in this famous picture .
survi@@ v@@ ors : geor@@ gi@@ j f@@ ani@@ ye@@ v today , with a photo of himself in hospital after the sie@@ ge on the lap@@ top .
my pain is immen@@ se and i wear it every day with me .
my friends know that i do not like to think about it or talk about it , and they never asked me about school .
physi@@ cally , i am doing well .
i should be careful with my in@@ ju@@ red k@@ ne@@ e , but i can now run well .
but because of my health i could not attend the intelligence academy of the f@@ s@@ b in san@@ kt pe@@ ter@@ sburg , as i wanted .
i have not received my documents , including the medical ones , and you have rep@@ lied that it is not possible .
my second passion was the animals , so i went to the veter@@ inary institute .
i have been there for two years .
he lear@@ ns to treat all animals &quot; from c@@ ats to co@@ ws &quot; .
he said : &apos; i knew that i would be able to help my children from my experiences .
children should not know about this and they should not , of course , suffer it .
his mother marina , 42 , said : &quot; this pain leaves me never .
he is in my soul , worse if the anniversary is appro@@ aching .
i will be taking part in the comm@@ em@@ or@@ ation cere@@ mon@@ ies .
i know that geor@@ gi@@ j cannot go .
it still needs to be much more violent for him because he was there and i did not .
i wa@@ ited at home for him and could not help .
i am so grateful to god that he has returned to me , here in bes@@ lan , all of them are drawn .
we remain in it .
geor@@ gi@@ j is now an adult , but this hor@@ ror is still in him .
it is difficult to accept this when something like this is being denied .
he is a young man who li@@ kes sport , but he cannot be here because of his k@@ ne@@ e .
he has been operating several times , he can run , but he can not exercise .
i would say that he has been too 50 % over@@ coming the hor@@ ror , but it is never possible to completely over@@ look and forget that .
this terrible experience is always being brought to our attention .
many friends and neighbours were killed during the sie@@ ge and this only rein@@ forces my pain .
i have lost many people i know well and who have been expensive .
my son is with me , and this is the greatest gift that god can make me , but my heart we@@ ars around the sla@@ in .
i know from families where new children were born , but also from wit@@ wy@@ n , who never again married .
it is difficult to accept that life continues , even if you can &apos;t .
i will never forget how my heart sp@@ ran@@ g in me when i saw him in the hospital .
and now i see what is happening in the world - wars in other regions .
what are these people fighting for ?
why are they killing each other ?
war has now become very close to our country and i almost cannot believe that .
we were a friendly country in the past , how can it be that we are now fighting ?
people and children are suffering , i am sure that ukraine has already had many children killed and still has many killed .
if we only want to take all these re@@ be@@ ls and throw out - as far away as possible .

it is now ten ( right ) and does not remember the cru@@ el@@ ty of the past .
the world held its bre@@ ath in 2004 , when the baby al@@ j@@ ona was born in the arms of a russian polic@@ em@@ an from the sie@@ ge of bes@@ lan .
the terrorists left them , but kept in their cru@@ el@@ ty their 30@@ -@@ year-@@ old mother , who was 10 years old si@@ ster k@@ ri@@ st@@ ina and her brother ma@@ k@@ ha@@ r in the school sports hall .
ma@@ k@@ ha@@ r , then three years old , es@@ cap@@ ed , but al@@ jon@@ a &apos;s mother and si@@ ster died in the mur@@ der@@ ous slau@@ ghter .
her father rus@@ lan has since married again .

&quot; you are now a great happy family and al@@ j@@ ona and ma@@ k@@ ha@@ r are both great children , &quot; says a close friend .
rus@@ lan is a fantastic father and wants to give you all the mem@@ ories you need to make your t@@ enth anniversary a success .

4 tips for better under@@ water photos and videos .
if you like to take photos or videos under water , there is a selection of devices .
the che@@ apest option is a water@@ proof poin@@ t-@@ an@@ de@@ rer .
i took these photos at a family festival with several cameras , all of them at a price of less than $ 3@@ 50 .
regardless of the equipment , there are some rules for the best results .
control your equipment twice .
even if you have a water@@ proof camera , make sure that the camera is in the right position .
set your camera to the photos or videos you want to record .
some cameras and cam@@ cor@@ ders have scene and record cap@@ turing modes , which allow the capture of the exposure time for the d@@ us@@ k subjects .
and before you jum@@ p into , check to see what depth your equipment is working .
some cameras are only available for up to 5 feet , others up to 50 or 60 feet .
search our purchasing guide and rat@@ ings for digital cameras for conventional cameras .
make multiple sho@@ ts - because many do not go down .
point and sho@@ ot games are available with a l@@ cd , which allows you to comp@@ ress images .
even if you have an l@@ cd , it is difficult to do this under water , and the correct image setting is a gam@@ bling aff@@ air .
so make many sho@@ ts .
if your camera has a row mode , which allows a number of sho@@ ts to be taken with slightly changed exposure settings , use the camera .
stay close to the surface .
the light is dram@@ atically worse the further it moves away from the surface .
if possible , they remain close to the surface when they take rec@@ ord@@ ings in a pool , a lake or the sea .
this allows you to add more color to your photos ; the de@@ eper you go , the less color you will see .
walk closely to the objects and see how they are made .
this is also a good advice on land , but it is all the more important under water because of the poor light conditions .
it is particularly important to be familiar with an action call .
andre@@ w law@@ son was a man of the variety whose character made things different , even in a gi@@ gan@@ tic organization like the n@@ h@@ s .
as an advisory an@@ aes@@ the@@ ti@@ st he devoted his career to the task of helping the si@@ ck to both ag@@ ony of the disease and qu@@ ell the pain of treatment .
among his patients , his wife re@@ members , was a mi@@ 6 employee who worked with the dev@@ ast@@ ating effects of torture .
law@@ son knew that the us medical doctors had been denied the diagno@@ ses and diseases , while the treated patients were mostly treated with something quite different .
one day in 2007 , however , he was the one who was the path of suffering .
&quot; i did not feel that i &quot; wrote , &quot; in may of this year .
i had difficulty in getting up .
while he was playing with the fl@@ u similar symp@@ t@@ oms , he noticed that he was not able to help his wife ju@@ li@@ et im@@ pati@@ ently .
&quot; i want to do everything better immediately than later , &quot; he noted .
when ju@@ li@@ et was on a business trip for a week , lam@@ bert felt very un@@ conventional in his approach to the issue .
something is wrong with the air .
he asked a colleague to write an x-@@ ray of his bre@@ ast .
only two weeks ago he was in the french alps for skiing .
the result of the x-@@ ray inspection was available .
he suffered from mes@@ o@@ the@@ li@@ om@@ a , an incur@@ able cancer that could cause the bre@@ ast skin , that is , the lun@@ gs over@@ taking skin .
as with most cancer cases , the risk of cancer is precisely the most difficult to determine .
for example , while some smo@@ kers suffer from l@@ ung cancer , not all l@@ ung cancer is the same .
but mes@@ o@@ the@@ li@@ om is different .
in almost all cases , the tri@@ gger is an as@@ be@@ sto@@ s load - contact with the fi@@ bre building material that was once known as &quot; mir@@ acle &quot; but has now been found to be fat@@ al .
for most of us , mes@@ o@@ the@@ li@@ om@@ a is a disease that is as easily ignored .
after all , as@@ be@@ sto@@ s is a product of the past .
the most dangerous as@@ be@@ sto@@ s type has been used in britain since the 19@@ 60 ’ s , when industry volun@@ tar@@ ily committed itself to not using it .
even where he is still in use , only people in certain industries worked directly with the substance - pl@@ um@@ bers , construction workers , car@@ pen@@ try and shi@@ py@@ ard workers , for example .
as an industrial hazar@@ dous material from a different time , it seems that it is hardly even more worrying today .
but this com@@ plac@@ ency is in@@ appropriate .
britain , it seems , is experiencing the cul@@ min@@ ation of a mes@@ o@@ the@@ li@@ om ep@@ ide@@ mic .
there are more deaths from mes@@ o@@ the@@ li@@ om@@ a here than in any other country in the world .
with a total of 2,@@ 500 deaths a year , twice as many people die from this disease as from road accidents .
annual figures from the mes@@ o@@ the@@ li@@ om@@ a deaths since 1980 and prospec@@ tive future deaths in britain are estimated to be around eur 1 billion .
the reason we have not yet seen the fat@@ al effects , even though as@@ be@@ sto@@ s has been illegal for years ( 1999 all types of as@@ be@@ sto@@ s were banned ) is that a mes@@ o@@ the@@ li@@ om@@ a is only developing after decades .
and the s@@ cour@@ ge of the mes@@ o@@ the@@ li@@ om is not con@@ fined to former workers in the construction sector .
as@@ be@@ sto@@ s was , and is often still present in the houses in which we live , the offices in which we work , the schools where we learn and the shops where we work .
mes@@ o@@ the@@ li@@ om@@ a therefore knows no class barriers , financial limits , profes@@ sions or age .
the privileged bas@@ tions , of which the elegant department stores in london and private schools , are not a shel@@ ter .
the parliament buildings are as@@ be@@ sto@@ s contam@@ inated .
in hospit@@ als , where we are healthy , we also have a great deal of work to do in this dead@@ ly car@@ cin@@ o@@ gen@@ ic gen@@ e .
andre@@ w law@@ son was not old .
he was not a pl@@ um@@ ber either .
he fell in love with the idea of what would be the best way to deal with as@@ be@@ sto@@ s .
then he found out .
&quot; it looks like the european union is going to be in the tun@@ nels at gu@@ y &apos;s hospital , where i spent six years stu@@ dying my training .
all - students , nur@@ ses , doctors and nur@@ ses - are using the tun@@ nels .
one won@@ ders how many of my colleagues at the same disease will suffer ?
he was unfortunately able to answer this question in part at least .
&quot; of the four doctors who worked at gu@@ y &apos;s hospital , the only one was the gu@@ y &apos;s hospital .
as many of us are still ill ?
andre@@ w law@@ son was a mes@@ o@@ the@@ li@@ om at the age of 48 .
when he was elected on 17 february this year , he was 55 .
this was an un@@ usually long period of survival .
fif@@ ty per cent of all mes@@ o@@ the@@ li@@ o@@ car@@ p@@ sis die within 8 months of diagno@@ sis .
the disease always ends up dead@@ ly .
we can only support law@@ son ’ s question : &apos; how many of us will be ill ? &apos;
the leading uk expert on mes@@ o@@ the@@ li@@ om@@ a , professor ju@@ lian pe@@ to , takes part in the international trade fair for mes@@ o@@ the@@ li@@ om@@ a between 18@@ 70 and 20@@ 50 , when the as@@ be@@ sto@@ pi@@ de@@ mi@@ e is expected to fall in britain .
most of these have not yet been known that they are dying like this .
an as@@ be@@ sto@@ s mine in que@@ be@@ c , canada al@@ am@@ y , canada , canada , al@@ am@@ y , canada , and the united states is a major source of information for the european union .
a brief look at the records of the courts to which the people concerned often have to turn for compensation claims shows how far the intellectual property rights s@@ cour@@ ge has gone .
in june this year marks &amp; sp@@ enc@@ er ad@@ mitted , for example , that jan@@ ice would be exposed to as@@ be@@ sto@@ s in all neglig@@ ence .
she worked for nine years for the chain , from 197@@ 8 to 198@@ 7 , and was responsible for the clothing department at two locations - one of which was the flag@@ ship store in the ox@@ ford street .
m@@ r@@ s. allen was only 18 years after she began her business at m &amp; s .
now she has two children in the tw@@ enti@@ eth century .
&quot; before this thing , &quot; she says , &quot; i have never heard of mes@@ o@@ the@@ li@@ om , i knew not even really anything about as@@ be@@ sto@@ s .
i never thought that the time would concern me .
there are few people who have heard a lot about as@@ be@@ sto@@ s .
the fact is that the term as@@ be@@ sto@@ s does not refer to a substance , but to a group of six min@@ er@@ als .
the name comes from the word &quot; as@@ be@@ sto@@ s &quot; , a description of the fi@@ bre structure that character@@ iz@@ es the fab@@ ric and makes it flexible .
three of the six were used in the construction industry .
ch@@ ry@@ so@@ tile , also known as white as@@ be@@ sto@@ s , is by far the most common form of as@@ be@@ sto@@ s found in buildings today .
it was designed for roof tiles , floor tiles , pi@@ pe sol@@ es , bo@@ il@@ ers , even for bra@@ ke surface .
it is less fat@@ al than other forms of as@@ be@@ sto@@ s , but it is still considered by the eu and the who as &apos; great health risk &apos; with possible death .
however , the brown as@@ be@@ sto@@ s ( am@@ os@@ ite ) and blue as@@ be@@ sto@@ s ( k@@ ro@@ ky@@ do@@ lit@@ h ) are dangerous .
britain was once the world ’ s largest im@@ porter of brown as@@ be@@ sto@@ s , and experts susp@@ ect that &quot; there are clear but indirect indic@@ ations that this is a major reason for the uni@@ qu@@ ely high mes@@ o@@ the@@ li@@ om@@ rates .
a mark &amp; sp@@ enc@@ er employee was arrested in the flag@@ ship store in the ox@@ ford street , london , as@@ be@@ sto@@ s exposed al@@ am@@ y .
jan allen has perhaps not been a typical mes@@ o@@ the@@ li@@ om@@ op@@ fer , but he has been a great success for ju@@ lian pe@@ to .
he has carried out a study of the people concerned , showing that &apos; a significant proportion of the mes@@ o@@ the@@ li@@ om@@ a is produced without known suspension by work or in the house , pre@@ sum@@ ably by contact with as@@ be@@ sto@@ s in the environment &apos; .
a large part of these contacts is based on the &quot; normal use and ag@@ eing &quot; of our buildings .
it looks as if nobody can assume that the european union will be safe .
a report by go@@ d@@ d@@ ard consulting , which describes the palace of west@@ min@@ ster , is a good example of how people can be found in the heart of the government , un@@ kno@@ w@@ ingly exposed to the substance .
in 2009 , go@@ d@@ d@@ ard reported that the service sha@@ fts and pi@@ pes are located behind the committee rooms of parliament with as@@ be@@ sto@@ s , whose dead@@ ly fac@@ tories are replaced by something as harm@@ less as &apos; strong air &apos; .
members of parliament are often accused of taking care of their own interests , but this is where it appears that the european parliament is doing the opposite .
while the director@@ ate for parliamentary labour has insi@@ sted that the west@@ min@@ ster palace be a &apos; clean health certificate &apos; , the commission is not in a position to take any action to save £ 1 billion of work over several years .
go@@ d@@ d@@ ard &apos;s report also pointed out that &apos; the existence of a single source of as@@ be@@ sto@@ s does not cor@@ respond to the respective provisions &apos; .
no one can know whether this mis@@ management will cost lives .
everything that can be done now is waiting .
a person who has lost contact with as@@ be@@ sto@@ s is gra@@ ham ab@@ bot@@ t , a general practi@@ tion@@ er .
as andre@@ w law@@ son suggests , the 50@@ -@@ year-@@ old ab@@ bot@@ t susp@@ ects that he was in hospital for as@@ be@@ sto@@ s .
&quot; i have been working in a hospital where as@@ be@@ sto@@ s complaints have been decided posi@@ tively , &quot; he says , &quot; but i can &apos;t prove it in my case .
it is so difficult to get to any place where you can work .
what he has just re@@ mem@@ bered is the day at the beginning of december 2009 , when he was be@@ having like this .
he was 45 , and he led an operation just late in the evening .
suddenly i had sha@@ ken fro@@ st .
suddenly , it came .
i felt terrible .
i believed that the journey home no longer could be made .
as a doctor , ab@@ bot@@ t knew that the pain was caused by the ch@@ est , the skin around his lun@@ gs and the skin .
but as jan allen said , he had no reason to be a mes@@ o@@ the@@ li@@ om@@ a .
he did not go to work for a month .
i am surprised that the doctors made x-@@ ray rec@@ ord@@ ings of his ch@@ est and use the pl@@ ur@@ ac@@ ath@@ e@@ ther to remove flu@@ id from the lun@@ gs and to test it in the laboratory .
his complaints , however , remained un@@ diagno@@ sed .
his health improved slowly , and he returned to his work@@ place .
from time to time , the symp@@ t@@ oms returned , often after sporting re@@ actions .
in 2011 , a patient ab@@ bot@@ t came with similar symp@@ t@@ oms in his practice and was later treated with mes@@ o@@ the@@ li@@ om .
but now , ab@@ bot@@ t did not con@@ fine this to his own case .
after all , his patient was a few decades older and had to work directly with as@@ be@@ sto@@ s .
the connection in that case was clear .
in september 2011 , ab@@ bot@@ t ’ s state deterior@@ ated again , and his general practi@@ tion@@ er brought his c@@ t sc@@ ans and x-@@ ray rec@@ ord@@ ings to a group of experts .
in december 2011 , exactly two years after ab@@ bot@@ t first joined the si@@ ck , the german government was forced to take a camera equipped pro@@ be into the ca@@ ve between the ri@@ b and the bre@@ ast f@@ ell .
i am an optim@@ ist .
i usually make further progress , &quot; he says .
frank@@ ly , i had not even had so many concerns .
but rac@@ hel , my wife , was concerned .
the result of the bi@@ op@@ sy was between christmas and new year before : &quot; you said to me that it was mes@@ o@@ the@@ li@@ om@@ a . &quot;
gra@@ ham ab@@ bot@@ t : diagno@@ sis mes@@ o@@ the@@ li@@ om@@ a mes@@ o@@ the@@ li@@ om@@ a diagno@@ sis
suddenly , ab@@ bot@@ t had appoin@@ t@@ ments with mac@@ mill@@ an nur@@ ses , of whom one had recommended him to take a look at a law@@ yer .
he was only now aware of the extent of the ep@@ ide@@ mic .
&quot; it turned out that as@@ be@@ sto@@ s was very common , especially in large public buildings where ro@@ h@@ s were often exposed to as@@ be@@ sto@@ s , &quot; he says .
the people who are exposed to as@@ be@@ sto@@ s in these buildings are now ill .
and so mes@@ o@@ the@@ li@@ om is now hit@@ ting younger people who are not working in the typical profes@@ sions .
the most dangerous pi@@ pes with as@@ be@@ sto@@ s insul@@ ation in hospit@@ als were located bene@@ ath the earth , so patients were probably not exposed to the substance .
but many employees who work in pede@@ strian tun@@ nels from one building to another are not allowed to use the car in the same way as andre@@ w law@@ son , or in underground can@@ teen ( as gra@@ ham ab@@ bot@@ t often did ) .
it is clear that , for several decades after the war , hospit@@ als may have been the life@@ -@@ saving for patients , but they are life@@ -@@ threat@@ ening for the doctors they deal with .
he is still being removed today .
students put their bun@@ sen@@ bren@@ ner on as@@ be@@ sto@@ s mat@@ s .
and it does not just concern hospit@@ als .
as@@ be@@ sto@@ s has been developed for its fab@@ ulous insul@@ ating and fl@@ ame re@@ tar@@ dant properties , often in offices , shops , libraries and town h@@ alls .
schools too .
indeed , many people probably have the first as@@ be@@ sto@@ s contact in the class@@ room .
throughout the country , in thousands of chem@@ i@@ stry lessons , students have their bun@@ kers on as@@ be@@ sto@@ s mat@@ s .
on websites , the issue of as@@ be@@ sto@@ s is now frequently raised in schools .
and meanwhile , inno@@ cent objects have been bur@@ ied in our houses like floors or sc@@ al@@ e-@@ cu@@ p@@ boards by default .
&quot; it is an industrial po@@ ison that is used in large parts of our real estate , &quot; says andre@@ w mor@@ gan , the law@@ yer who is andre@@ w law@@ son in his trial against gu@@ y &apos;s .
in one case , the only contact that could be found in a woman concerned was the demo@@ lition of a sh@@ ed in the 197@@ 0s .
so be careful how you can fit your garden sh@@ ed .
the effects of diagno@@ sis , and the knowledge that the disease is incur@@ able , is immen@@ se .
&quot; it takes a while to process that , &quot; says gra@@ ham ab@@ bot@@ t .
i went back to work and tried to continue , but i noticed that i had to go to the office to work .
i was in practice for two weeks .
then i knew that i would go and take care of myself .
well , i will not give another christmas party .
the greatest difficulty was the perspective change from the position of a doctor to the position of a patient .
like countless patients before him , he re@@ members how overwhel@@ ming he is of all the information he has had to deal with .
&quot; it was very difficult to include all of this , &quot; he says .
&quot; i asked my doctor &quot; how long have i left ? &quot;
and they gave me another 12 months .
i remember that i thought i was &quot; well , i was going to not give another christmas party .
that &apos;s it . &quot;
mes@@ o@@ the@@ li@@ om is particularly insi@@ di@@ ous , because it is our life support mechanism - bre@@ a@@ thing itself - that the dead@@ ly cancer is caused .
most of the mes@@ o@@ the@@ li@@ om@@ a are caused by as@@ be@@ sto@@ s contact .
as@@ be@@ sto@@ s consists of the small@@ est fi@@ bers .
if the as@@ be@@ sto@@ s is w@@ ound up and the fi@@ b@@ res are in@@ hal@@ ed , you can feel comfortable in the ch@@ est , the skin around the lun@@ gs .
as@@ be@@ sto@@ s fi@@ bers ir@@ r@@ age the ch@@ est and can tri@@ gger cell mu@@ tations .
&quot; the problem ar@@ ises with the in@@ hal@@ ed nee@@ dle shaped as@@ be@@ sto@@ s fi@@ b@@ res , &quot; professor tom tre@@ as@@ ure , a hear@@ t-@@ thro@@ wn man .
it is the hospital that andre@@ w law@@ son susp@@ ects that is the only one that has exposed him to as@@ be@@ sto@@ s that is ir@@ on@@ ically a leading centre in the treatment of mes@@ o@@ the@@ li@@ om@@ a .
treas@@ ure knew la@@ wn@@ s and be@@ tr@@ ay@@ ed some others who probably also had to work in the hospital during their training .
once the as@@ be@@ sto@@ s nee@@ d@@ les reach the l@@ ung tissu@@ e , treas@@ ure says , &quot; you will be taken from the bre@@ a@@ thing process to the edge where the skin is .
by nature , it is in@@ he@@ ren@@ tly inv@@ a@@ sive from the beginning .
the usual options for other cancer diseases are not working in mes@@ o@@ the@@ li@@ om@@ a .
the effectiveness of an operation is highly controversial , for example .
some say that they value an attempt .
treas@@ ure ne@@ sts on it .
&quot; you can use the bre@@ ast co@@ at not cut out , &quot; he says .
you will arrive with the k@@ ni@@ fe not around it .
meanwhile , cancer is &quot; at chem@@ other@@ ap@@ y not very well , &quot; the &quot; effect shows &quot; , but not heal@@ ing .
&quot; sometimes there are long-term survi@@ v@@ ors , &quot; says treas@@ ure .
but in the end they all die .
fortunately , some patients actually live long , much longer than expected .
the author ste@@ ph@@ en j@@ ay g@@ ould died 20 years after diagno@@ sis .
two and a half years after his own diagno@@ sis , gra@@ ham ab@@ bot@@ t is still fighting .
after having bought mes@@ o@@ the@@ li@@ om , ab@@ bot@@ t came into contact with andre@@ w law@@ son , who spent four years in the hospital after his diagno@@ sis .
&quot; hel@@ lo , cancer center , &quot; he stood at calls f@@ ö@@ h@@ lich before .
&quot; he was very positive , &quot; says ab@@ bot@@ t .
he had his diagno@@ sis four years earlier and was still very active .
originally , ab@@ bot@@ t had six chem@@ other@@ ap@@ y cy@@ cles , which included four months of chem@@ other@@ ap@@ y and is expected to be extended by only one month .
&quot; i was desper@@ ate , &quot; he says .
i wanted to give up .
law@@ son managed to &quot; make things in a slightly more positive way &quot; .
after consulting several doctors , he decided to take a course in the treatment with prof@@ . lo@@ ic lan@@ g@@ -@@ la@@ z@@ dun@@ ski , her@@ z@@ -@@ thor@@ a@@ x specialist at the gu@@ y &apos;s .
&quot; we have had an advantage by not referring .
a normal patient would have a re@@ fund and would have to wait for the approval of the treatment .
money is crucial for mes@@ o@@ the@@ li@@ om@@ -@@ suff@@ e@@ rers to obtain the best available therap@@ ies .
but if these treatments inevitably lead to failure , the risks are many .
and so you turn to the courts in the hope of compensation .
andre@@ w law@@ son cont@@ acted andre@@ w mor@@ gan of field college and the board of directors for a letter to the board of directors .
&quot; it has been known since 18@@ 98 that as@@ be@@ sto@@ s is extremely dangerous for health , &quot; says mor@@ gan .
but what has changed in the 19@@ 60 ’ s is that it was recognized that even a very small burden is a health risk .
and here began the neglig@@ ence of companies to play a role .
andre@@ w law@@ son and gu@@ y &apos;s hospitality company put their case to the court , but it was not that they wanted to make mor@@ gan a &quot; full compensation &quot; .
after the investigation to his death , a spo@@ kes@@ man of the gu@@ y &apos;s confirmed that &quot; the as@@ be@@ sto@@ s fi@@ bers in the affected cel@@ lar area in the 199@@ 0s were removed . &quot;
that was a great achievement for andre@@ w law@@ son .
like as@@ be@@ sto@@ s can be removed , it can be removed from the same way as as@@ be@@ sto@@ s can be removed .
indeed , mes@@ o@@ the@@ li@@ om@@ -@@ suff@@ e@@ rers who have sought compensation are not likely to suffer from a huge problem , the dead@@ ly as@@ be@@ sto@@ s contact of a company or a job - usually decades after the incident .
many of their former employers are sold or closed .
insurance documents can be lost .
and those who are opposed to claims know that they are not going to have time , but certainly not with the cold people .
in response , there have been clear new legislation this year , which will make it easier for mes@@ o@@ the@@ li@@ om@@ -@@ affected parties to obtain compensation .
the law has a code of conduct promoted by the insurance industry of eur 3@@ 50 million for all those who have been in the diagno@@ sis after july 2012 .
in such cases , the pla@@ in@@ ti@@ ff will receive 80 % of what a court can obtain in a normal compensation process - about 1@@ 20@@ ,000 £ .
about 300 successful applications were submitted to the program each year .
andre@@ w mor@@ gan thin@@ ks like so many mes@@ o@@ the@@ li@@ om people that 3@@ 50 million £ is a &quot; very good work &quot; of the insurance industry .
&quot; this is a deal of insu@@ rers for insu@@ rers , &quot; he says , and indicates that the insurance is a real deal .
mi@@ ke pen@@ ning , then employed as a work@@ er and pension minister , ad@@ mitted that the law &quot; was not perfect .
but both pen@@ ning and mor@@ gan ad@@ mitted that , with seven deaths , the number of deaths was increasing every day .
&quot; people suffer so much and need help today , &quot; said pen@@ ning during the second hearing of the mes@@ o@@ the@@ li@@ om act in december last year .
at that time , gra@@ ham ab@@ bot@@ t was in the hands of prof@@ . lo@@ ic lan@@ g@@ -@@ la@@ z@@ dun@@ ski for 19 months .
after their initial deliber@@ ations , lan@@ g-@@ la@@ z@@ dun@@ ski recommended an operation that he could not have expected to have been performed , unlike tom treas@@ ure .
this was caused by radiation therapy and chemical therapy .
ab@@ bot@@ t felt stronger .
&quot; this is of course the most important thing , &quot; says ab@@ bot@@ t .
this is always seen in patients .
there is something that will keep you going .
if you give up , you are going very quickly worse .
gra@@ ham ab@@ bot@@ t under@@ went a major review of the operation in march 2012 .
at the end of august , he had the last of the six chem@@ other@@ ap@@ y cy@@ cles .
follow-up scan@@ s@@ can did not show any signs of the disease .
then i had a meeting in march 20@@ 14 .
there have been several cancer spots around my bre@@ ast .
i was just 50 .
this is not life@@ -@@ threat@@ ening .
this is an end to life .
again , ab@@ bot@@ t under@@ took six chem@@ other@@ ap@@ y cy@@ cles .
now there is no tr@@ ace of the t@@ um@@ ors visible .
but the process is physi@@ cally and ment@@ ally very demanding .
they must think of practical things - about money , if i am no longer , for example , or show my wife how the bo@@ iler time setting works .
if you receive bad news , you will be negative .
they must look forward .
as the father of el@@ lie , 16 , and tam@@ s@@ in , 14 , this is not always easy .
&quot; for parents , this is difficult , &quot; he says .
it is difficult to know what to say and how much .
when i first received my first diagno@@ sis , i told my girl that i had a disease with which i could not get old .
they respon@@ ded very differently .
tam@@ s@@ in is very soci@@ able and dis@@ cour@@ aged .
she told her friends and we were told that we would get a lot of calls soon .
el@@ lie was more cau@@ tious .
she did not say much .
such talks are something that all cancer patients should have gone through .
but for mes@@ o@@ the@@ li@@ o@@ car@@ p@@ ent@@ ers such talks did not pass through hope , not a tr@@ ace of hope for survival .
the disease brings ( as eventually it also means for ste@@ ph@@ en j@@ ay g@@ ould ) a gri@@ m security .
as andre@@ w mor@@ gan says , &quot; mes@@ o@@ the@@ li@@ om is not life@@ -@@ threat@@ ening .

china ref@@ uses to recognise hong kong &apos;s right to government , and prote@@ sters swe@@ ar re@@ tali@@ ation and re@@ tali@@ ation .
on sunday , the chinese parliament decided to hold a referendum on the chinese constitution , despite the more calls for democratic reforms .
this approach pre@@ sum@@ ably fi@@ ghts the long-@@ proc@@ laim@@ ed pro@@ tests in hong kong &apos;s business district , while activi@@ sts continue to support planning and mobil@@ isation within a few hours of the announcement .
the chinese people ’ s congress ’ s decision allows communist leaders to use all non-@@ beijing rights to re@@ build their country .
&quot; that &apos;s not un@@ expected , but it makes us an@@ gr@@ y , &quot; said legal expert em@@ ily la@@ u , chairman of the democratic party .
this is not what beijing is promised .
the inhabitants of hong kong have been lied to .
it is clear that we are dealing with an author@@ itarian regime which is not the only one .
in defending china ’ s decision , li fe@@ i , the secretary general of the standing committee of the national people ’ s congress , said that the approval of public nom@@ inations in the hong kong government ’ s elections would lead to cha@@ otic .
since 1997 , when britain lost control of hong kong to the chinese , the chinese have been ple@@ d@@ ging to re@@ patri@@ ate the chinese government from 20@@ 17 .
china ’ s leaders presented sunday ’ s decision as a democratic break@@ through , because it was a clear signal to hong kong ’ s citizens that the choice was made , but the decision also shows that china ’ s leaders are not in a position of close beijing .
a new clause also states that only candidates who are &quot; lo@@ ving to the land and love for hong kong &quot; shall be allowed .
the decision follows a summer in which some of the largest and most popular events in the world were held in hong kong for several years .
behind the pro-@@ democratic campaign in hong kong is the oc@@ cu@@ p@@ y central with love and peace movement .
on sunday evening , within a few hours of the announcement , the number of people who had been occup@@ ying the premises had reached hundreds of occup@@ y central sup@@ porters in front of the hong kong government headquarters .
during the demonstration , the organiz@@ ers said that their movement had under@@ gone a new stage of civil dis@@ o@@ be@@ di@@ ence and that they would be pro@@ testing waves in the coming weeks .
however , they did not specify any more , apparently to avoid problems with the authorities .
in an online communication , the organiz@@ ers stated that the movement &quot; the occupation of the central district only as the last means in consideration &quot; was a major step forward .
we are sorry to say that the situation is that all the opportunities for dialogue are being exhaus@@ ted today and the occupation of the central district is going to take place defini@@ tively .
the hong kong authorities have been working on the announcement of beijing &apos;s intention to open negotiations with the chinese authorities on sunday before the government building .
the un@@ rest is being caused by the feeling of many in hong kong that they are slowly losing control of their city .
the influ@@ x of people from the main@@ land increases competition for products and services .
moreover , there is growing fear that hong kong ’ s values , such as democracy and freedom of speech , will be ero@@ ded under the growing pressure of beijing .
some cri@@ tici@@ zed the demonstra@@ tions of the occup@@ y-@@ center movement , because they did not pro@@ hi@@ bit business - the life bar of hong kong - .
&quot; the pro@@ tests they are talking about could have major economic damage , the depending on how many people are involved and how long they last .
we do not want to fuel any fear that hong kong will get out of control .
this impression is bad for investment .
state@@ -@@ controlled media in china reported a similar situation recently , as the pro-@@ democracy activi@@ sts in hong kong reported .
this summer , activi@@ sts organized an un@@ official referendum on the election rights that the eu had 7@@ 8@@ 0,000 people in - more than a fifth of the elec@@ tor@@ ate in hong kong .
in july , tens of thousands took part in one of the largest democratic demonstra@@ tions in the region ’ s history .
the tradition of school final b@@ alls in the us is now being transferred to universities , where fres@@ h@@ men perform with the private aer@@ op@@ lan@@ e .
we look forward to respon@@ ding to this demand and to the first luxury travel service in the uk for students of today .
to enjoy a particularly impressive performance at the university , the hotel offers a range of transport options , including private aircraft , roll@@ s-@@ roy@@ ce ph@@ an@@ tom , ast@@ on mar@@ ten or m@@ cla@@ ren p@@ 1 .
mr ste@@ w@@ art also stated that the service is a security section .
this service is an ideal alternative for students who would otherwise have their hab@@ its in a danger@@ ously over@@ loaded car through the country of co@@ ach .
together with our new vi@@ f options , we look forward to this year &apos;s edition of vi@@ f to ensure that students get the university with a minimum of effort and a maximum of luxury .
a company spo@@ kes@@ man said that there are no new book@@ ings yet , because the service is only just launched .
the company also announced that it had not yet received any training fees of £ 9@@ ,000 per year , despite the tu@@ ition fees .
students today differ in their expectations and expectations very much from the students before 10 , 20 , 30 or 40 years ago - it is more important than ever to have a great first impression , and with vi@@ f you can do just that .
the national student union critic@@ ised the service as being cancelled .
me@@ gan dun@@ n , vice president of the n@@ us for higher education , said : &quot; this offer seems to be completely separate from the life of the majority of students .
many students who have been stu@@ dying this month are facing a crisis of life@@ -@@ support costs , as the available financial assistance in the form of loans and grants is not available to the most rapidly growing invo@@ ices for the simpl@@ est living conditions .
fem@@ ini@@ sts cri@@ tici@@ ze r@@ aci@@ al issues and polic@@ ing in fer@@ g@@ us@@ on
the un@@ armed te@@ en@@ ager was arrested at the beginning of this month by a police officer in fer@@ g@@ us@@ on , mo .
participants raised their hands in the air and san@@ g , &quot; hands high , not sho@@ ot , &quot; while they were before bur@@ ial .
after two weeks of pro@@ tests in fer@@ g@@ us@@ on , mo , due to the sho@@ oting of the un@@ armed te@@ en@@ ager michael brown noticed that the blo@@ gg@@ ers had been in the news .
after their experience , white fem@@ in@@ ist comm@@ ent@@ ators put gender before the race , if it is a question of re@@ productive rights and income inequality .
while ten@@ sions in the middle west have ris@@ en and taken he@@ ed throughout the country , pe@@ re@@ z saw that the responses of white women were 100 % concerned with the bre@@ ed .
compared to the responses of black women shortly after the sho@@ ts of 9 august , personal es@@ says were printed with tit@@ les such as &quot; thoughts on fer@@ g@@ us@@ on of a white woman &quot; and &quot; fem@@ in@@ ism is not just about op@@ pression .
but for pe@@ re@@ z , this was an important change .
&quot; i do not think you can be a lot of people in fem@@ in@@ ism who know about it and who have privile@@ ges in such a sophisticated way , &quot; she said .
people felt they were pressed to do something about the inci@@ dents that took place .
it is characteristic of the crisis in which we find ourselves and because the situation in fer@@ g@@ us@@ on is so eth@@ n@@ ici@@ zed that it expres@@ ses this .
for english professor k@@ ori@@ th@@ a mit@@ ch@@ ell of the o@@ hi@@ o state university , please visit the website of fer@@ g@@ us@@ on .
&quot; i can find something fun on fac@@ e@@ book about me and my partner and get 150 lit@@ res of everything from the top down , &quot; said mit@@ ch@@ ell .
if i am to talk about how col@@ oured in your own country are under sie@@ ge , then the silence is e@@ ars .
&quot; how can it be safe for women to talk publicly about a relationship , but not about security in public space ? &quot; she asked .
for black women like mit@@ ch@@ ell , the race , gender and sexual orientation in the history of the us , the new york times have no den@@ sity .
for them , black women do not have the luxury of choosing the topics ne@@ at@@ ly separated ; they live in the combined world every day .
while white women are now the subjects of race and gender in the fem@@ in@@ ist main@@ stream cir@@ cles , the ang@@ ela h@@ att@@ ory says , professor of fem@@ in@@ ist gender equality .
&quot; between 18@@ 65 and 18@@ 90 , at least 10@@ ,000 black men were yel@@ low@@ ed and the ra@@ tion@@ ale was almost always the ra@@ pe of a white woman , &quot; said hat@@ tery .
white women had to be involved in the story to help the ly@@ n@@ ch@@ ess murder .
for h@@ at@@ tery , the split between white and black women reached the point where female white figh@@ ters were fighting for the women ’ s voting right , such as sus@@ an b@@ . an@@ th@@ ony , in the late n@@ ine@@ teenth century .
&quot; they decided to take a stand for the women &apos;s voting rights , and the right to vote for black should come later , &quot; said h@@ at@@ tery .
if we remember such things , we are being power@@ fully aware of why colo@@ red women are not we@@ aring white women .
we have not done our job well .
we have never helped black women to get their hus@@ bands and s@@ ons to protect themselves .
even after women won the election in 19@@ 20 , it took another decade to get the election to be made public .
the group was established almost 40 years after the original request for help from black women , says mit@@ ch@@ ell .
for mit@@ ch@@ ell , the flo@@ od of white fem@@ in@@ ist responses to the he@@ ter@@ o@@ gene@@ ous problems raised by fer@@ g@@ us@@ on - police behavior , r@@ aci@@ al discrimination - is a mirror of the time when white fem@@ ini@@ sts catch .
&quot; would it not be great if the activi@@ sts who have such traditional fem@@ in@@ ist platforms were to have the right to education of a child so seriously ?
fem@@ ini@@ sts of the second generation who have made their career in the struggle for re@@ productive rights and access to contrac@@ ep@@ tion rights are now being forced to seek to understand what the system means .
the famous white fem@@ in@@ ist acti@@ vis@@ t gl@@ oria ste@@ iner went to the hospital two weeks after the sho@@ oting of michael brown .
&quot; i hope that women who have a different but parallel mind will be able to find a solution that is in@@ he@@ rent to the body - and opinions on the race , the way in public surve@@ ys are significantly different - the changes .
although ste@@ iner is responsible for a rather inter@@ sec@@ tional fem@@ in@@ ism , in which r@@ aci@@ al as gender issues are addressed , some of her comments are not relevant .
christ@@ ina som@@ mer , resear@@ cher at the american enterprise institute and author of the &quot; who st@@ ol@@ e fem@@ in@@ is@@ m ? &quot; said to she the people of europe .
there are now hundreds of specific programmes for girls and young women , but almost nothing for bo@@ ys .
but when the white house recently adopted a small program , my brother &apos;s ke@@ eper , it was not clear how to help vulnerable young black and h@@ is@@ pan@@ ic men , there was an@@ no@@ ying re@@ actions from many fem@@ ini@@ sts , including women .
the relationship between the police and the black community is not the only problem that has come to the fore of main@@ stream fem@@ in@@ ism .
after the us border police arrested almost 6@@ 3@@ ,000 un@@ accompanied min@@ ors on the sou@@ th@@ west border of the country this year , the international criminal court is also taking up the issue of immigration reform - this time as a women &apos;s issue .
andre@@ a mer@@ c@@ ado , co-@@ chair of we bel@@ ong together , a group that is supporting women for immigration and the fight against illegal immigration , said that there is no need for a re@@ consideration of the issue as a fundamental women &apos;s issue .
&quot; they speak for themselves , &quot; said mer@@ c@@ ado .
if the vast majority of labour vis@@ as are to be sent to male immigrants , women who are forced to ac@@ company them are in a position where they are responsible for domestic violence and exploitation .
&quot; these stories find a sustainable way of life in women &apos;s organisations , &quot; she said .
&quot; sch@@ we@@ in@@ e-@@ haus &quot; in ip@@ sw@@ ich is available for sale .
the image of a house for sale was created by real estate agents , when it became clear that there was a big pi@@ g that it could afford to be comfortable in the living room .
the de@@ t@@ ached house has one bedroom , located on a private street in ip@@ sw@@ ich and is ren@@ ted for 1@@ 20@@ ,000 p@@ ounds .
the details included a picture of the living room of the house - one of which was a pi@@ g , that had his head on a sof@@ a bed .
real estate agents conn@@ ell@@ s said that the pi@@ g on the photo is the pet .
&quot; the photo was taken by mistake and was published by now &quot; said a spo@@ kes@@ person of the company .
the exc@@ el@@ é of the house described conn@@ ell@@ s as the former meeting house as a &quot; unique &quot; house .
although the bro@@ ker may have the image removed from the website , it still appears on advertising material .
the house sales in the social media were of interest when some asked whether the house would be in the purchase price .

leon@@ id@@ as asked the gla@@ di@@ ator band to be released on the market .
not only the gla@@ di@@ ators were standing an@@ k@@ le in the mat@@ sch at the first rhe@@ in@@ b@@ ach@@ er r@@ ö@@ mer@@ tag in the leisure park .
but the attr@@ action of the event was strong enough to be well over 1000 visitors yesterday .
there was a color@@ ful series of dep@@ ic@@ tions , performances , games , exhibition pieces and information about the time of the roman@@ s and their importance for the rhe@@ in@@ land .
the main attr@@ action of the day was undoubtedly the mar@@ ti@@ al@@ ic figh@@ ter force of the gla@@ di@@ ator school &quot; am@@ or mor@@ tis &quot; , which was a great help to get the most out of every ra@@ iny season .
gla@@ di@@ ator owner &quot; leon@@ id@@ as &quot; proved to be a human@@ e and efficient person .
first , the &quot; pro@@ voca@@ te@@ urs &quot; were in the series with rec@@ tan@@ gu@@ lar and short-@@ s@@ word as well as le@@ g on the left le@@ g and arm rail on the right arm .
the &quot; e@@ states &quot; followed , with bre@@ ast chi@@ ds , short cuts and a lit@@ ter plan@@ ze , and iron cur@@ tain .
the hotel was very impressive , the performance of the &quot; re@@ ti@@ ari@@ us &quot; , which was connected with the lit@@ ter net , tri@@ ple and dol@@ ch against the &quot; secur@@ or &quot; and was subsequently able to ground the bur@@ n after a short fight .
the s@@ words of metal and metal scr@@ at@@ ch together , the shi@@ el@@ ds s@@ ket@@ ches and the thro@@ wing lan@@ ces fle@@ w sur@@ ren@@ dering through the arena that is a fear and fear .
but the imf ’ s imposing &quot; sum@@ ma ru@@ di@@ t &quot; , the mu@@ k@@ ul@@ ous sho@@ o@@ ter , had always been an atten@@ tive eye .
&quot; we wanted to make the everyday life of rome a reality again and to preserve the culture of the roman period , &quot; said lo@@ ren@@ z e@@ us@@ kir@@ chen , chairman of the organiz@@ er &quot; fre@@ un@@ desk@@ re@@ is r@@ ö@@ mer@@ kan@@ al &quot; .
after two years of preparation , the park for a day became a &quot; opport@@ un@@ istic &quot; .
after all , the roman@@ s not only fought and con@@ qu@@ ered our region , but also the roman culture and numerous buildings that we still have today .
remains of these were also found in the roman day .
the fron@@ tin@@ us company placed the water and energy supply on the agenda once and now , and managing director pe@@ tra fr@@ ic@@ ke knew : &quot; we are still drawing benefits from the knowledge of that time &quot; .
this also confir@@ ms the degree survey engine@@ er r@@ alp@@ h he@@ ili@@ ger of the &quot; ing@@ eni@@ eur@@ te@@ am@@ z@@ we@@ i &quot; from rhe@@ in@@ bach , the surve@@ ying instruments of the roman@@ s such as ch@@ or@@ ob@@ at , gro@@ ma or di@@ op@@ tra .
the roman@@ es@@ que villa in blan@@ ken@@ heim presented s@@ ket@@ ches and models of the exc@@ av@@ ations an@@ no 18@@ 94 and br@@ ick from the original hy@@ po@@ ca@@ ste , the war@@ m@@ th of the air , the once the roman ba@@ ths .
the pede@@ strian prec@@ inc@@ t is also impressive , as wol@@ f and fu@@ ch@@ s discovered two mill@@ en@@ nia ago in the cla@@ y foot@@ steps .
in 2011 , the town hall of the national association of rhe@@ in@@ land had the remains of a roman villa in the industrial park nor@@ d in rhe@@ in@@ bach .
the wall was e@@ rec@@ ted in an economic building with a dr@@ ying dr@@ ying dr@@ ying of cere@@ als and m@@ illing .
the building probably had to be converted into a villa rus@@ tic@@ a , an agricultural property , explained the archae@@ o@@ log@@ ist dr. j@@ enni@@ fer mor@@ sch@@ is@@ er .
a number of finds from these ex@@ positions were found in the area of gl@@ ass@@ -@@ display , including a large tunnel plate , several foun@@ tains of glass , and parts of a delicate nec@@ kl@@ ace .
the villa was probably built from the first century to the fourth century ad until the beginning of the ger@@ man@@ s &apos; arrival in the roman r@@ hin@@ eland , pre@@ sum@@ ably mor@@ sch@@ ei@@ ser .
it was the children who also worked with the roman wind@@ m@@ ill game , similar to today &apos;s m@@ ill game , or they wrote as they once wrote the roman pu@@ pil@@ s with metal hand@@ les on existing tab@@ les .
the bo@@ oth of the r@@ ö@@ mer@@ ther@@ men z@@ ü@@ l@@ p@@ ich was the place for the children to put mo@@ sa@@ ics themselves , at the stand of the rhe@@ in@@ bach glass mo@@ sa@@ ics and at the stand of the natural centre ei@@ fe@@ l we@@ it@@ ter@@ sh@@ ei@@ fe@@ l we@@ it@@ ter@@ sh@@ ei@@ fe@@ l we@@ it@@ ter@@ sh@@ ei@@ m .

for example , a roman legi@@ on@@ na@@ ire is being de@@ ported from his work at the appropriate w@@ ach@@ t@@ berg , plants are being used as living mon@@ ument from the roman era and a fun@@ ny lesson is being taught in matters of international understanding .
the ad@@ endor@@ fer ele@@ mentary school is dedicated to the development of the r@@ ö@@ mer@@ them@@ a during a project week .
the roman@@ s week is intended to bring together the many , but often not at first gl@@ ance , trac@@ es of the roman@@ s in w@@ ach@@ t@@ berg .

e@@ bol@@ a : the ep@@ ide@@ mic is a burden on west africa ’ s economy
the e@@ bol@@ a ep@@ ide@@ mic in west africa is also a serious b@@ low to the economy .
markets are or@@ ph@@ an@@ ed - and international companies are di@@ stan@@ cing themselves .
the dev@@ ast@@ ating e@@ bol@@ a ep@@ ide@@ mic is putting the economy of west africa at a serious b@@ low .
the har@@ v@@ est is ro@@ tting on the fields that have mines left and the markets are wa@@ sting - that virus has destroyed the region hard .
some international companies are also already at a distance .
&quot; the e@@ bol@@ a ep@@ ide@@ mic is not only a medical crisis , but also an economic one , &quot; the chief of the african development bank , don@@ ald k@@ ab@@ er@@ u@@ ka , jud@@ ges .
liber@@ ia is the hard@@ est hit , and the worst affected is the country .
&quot; it is a total disaster , we lose a lot of money , &quot; says al@@ ha@@ ji b@@ am@@ o@@ go , who is on the second largest market in liber@@ ia &apos;s capital mon@@ ro@@ via clothing .
the market is only when you buy food or something for dis@@ inf@@ ection from e@@ bol@@ a .
liber@@ ia is the hard@@ est hit by the virus , alone here fell the f@@ right .
recently , the health authorities declared that the disease was spread to every corner of the country .
gu@@ ine@@ a , sier@@ ra le@@ one and ni@@ geria have also been affected by the virus .
in total , more than 15@@ 00 people have died , thousands more have died .
foreign companies attract employees from abroad to work in the company .
throughout the res@@ our@@ ce-@@ rich countries , firms are setting up their business .
foreign companies such as the steel group ar@@ cel@@ or mit@@ tal are with@@ drawing their employees , several international airlines are flying to the affected regions .
the local deal@@ ers and farmers are also re@@ acting : few merchan@@ ts are still leaving their homes to buy a re@@ fund .
in some areas of sier@@ ra le@@ one and liber@@ ia , which suffered quar@@ ant@@ ine , the situation is getting worse , including the areas of land important for export of co@@ co@@ a and coffee be@@ ans .
farmers do not d@@ are to pay for the har@@ v@@ est .
food is scar@@ ce
&quot; people are going to travel less and less , &quot; says phil@@ li@@ pe de v@@ re@@ yer , paris expert on the economy of west africa .
the man , for example , who normally goes on the market and sel@@ ls his vegetables , would rather stay at home .
the people are therefore being told the consequences of the ep@@ ide@@ mic directly and urgently : food is getting scar@@ ce .
in the markets , the stock of basic food@@ stuffs such as rice is d@@ wind@@ ling .
at the same time , the highly dependent region is threat@@ ening to damage its image , with far-@@ reaching consequences .
the greatest danger is that international companies will generally have to leave the area for a long time , says phili@@ ppe hu@@ g@@ on of the french think tan@@ k ir@@ is .
the crucial thing is how far and how long the virus will spread .
investors may feel that &quot; the problem is dangerous , in good faith , to live in gu@@ ine@@ a , sier@@ ra le@@ one and liber@@ ia , and thus to invest &quot; , hu@@ g@@ on war@@ ns .
the disease also affects the stra@@ ined public budgets of the states .
the disease also affects the already pain@@ ful and un@@ healthy national budgets of the countries concerned .
credit rating agency mo@@ o@@ dy &apos;s has been afraid that the credit rating agencies &apos; budgets will be heavily affected by the high expenditure on the health system and , in addition , by the wor@@ sen@@ ing economy .
the african development bank has already promised to provide the health systems of the countries concerned with $ 60 million ( eur 45 million ) .
the effects are also already felt in ni@@ geria , where only a few e@@ bol@@ a cases have been diagno@@ sed .
although the o@@ il@@ -@@ rich region of the southern ni@@ ger del@@ ta has not been affected so far .
but elsewhere , many people have already left for fear of inf@@ ection at home .
reservations for hotels are also significantly reduced .

the pat@@ ron@@ age was given to may@@ or wol@@ f@@ gan@@ g wild and secretary of state al@@ bert fü@@ r@@ ack@@ er .
the original name &quot; tan@@ k forest ber@@ n@@ ga@@ u &quot; was derived from the year 19@@ 07 when the first plant was opened on march 21 .
the na@@ zi regime had the dis@@ solution of the association in 19@@ 37 .
only in 196@@ 4 did 19 young men find themselves again , who were born on april 30 at the gu@@ es@@ thouse lu@@ k@@ as the &quot; new &quot; protec@@ tor &apos;s association &quot; t@@ ann@@ en@@ wal@@ d &quot; bern@@ ga@@ u .
kar@@ l march and ad@@ ol@@ f ried led the association as protec@@ tor champi@@ ons through a difficult initial period in which it pre@@ domin@@ antly sought to improve a uni@@ fied and independent club .
in the autumn of 196@@ 5 , the sch@@ ü@@ tz@@ en@@ vere@@ in started the &quot; le@@ in@@ inger &quot; inn with two teams in the run@@ den@@ competi@@ tions .
in the following years , the sports sho@@ ot@@ ers , who have now been organized in seven teams , established themselves in all classes up to the 1st gau@@ lig@@ a .
the club records p@@ ur@@ z@@ el@@ ten every year and the magic border of 3@@ 80 r@@ ings was first mentioned in 1980 by ru@@ di me@@ i@@ er .
just as the performance of the active def@@ enders has increased , the members ’ numbers have also improved .
after the club &quot; le@@ in@@ inger &quot; was no longer able to meet the demands of a modern sho@@ oting club , the association has decided to take over the management board of the former , led by jo@@ han@@ n r@@ inn .
after a work output of 27@@ 00 hours , the company awarded the first prize on 8 may 198@@ 8 for the new sho@@ ot@@ ers rooms to the church .
one of the great highlights of the club &apos;s history was certainly the 4@@ 4th sho@@ oting , combined with the sole@@ m@@ n con@@ sec@@ r@@ ation of the new sho@@ o@@ ter flag in july 1991 .
on 23 and 24 april 1994 , the sch@@ ü@@ tz@@ en@@ vere@@ in founded its 30@@ -@@ year founding anniversary .
1995 is a b@@ ö@@ ll@@ er@@ group was founded .
jo@@ se@@ f sch@@ mal@@ z@@ l was appointed a b@@ ö@@ ll@@ er@@ re@@ stant .
a major challenge for the &quot; b@@ ö@@ l@@ le@@ rer &quot; and for the club as a whole was the orientation of the bav@@ arian b@@ ö@@ ll@@ er@@ tre@@ ff@@ en 2005 .
in many hours of volunte@@ ering , the members of the association have opened the rooms and the sho@@ oting facility in the bern@@ ga@@ u hof and have thus been updated .
ele@@ ven teams in run@@ den@@ competi@@ tions
the hotel is also well known for its sporting performance .
al@@ together , ele@@ ven teams are currently participating in the run@@ den@@ competi@@ tions : six air ri@@ f@@ le teams , an air gun team , a sports pilot team and a team of run@@ ners .
the first team with lars ell@@ rich , k@@ ath@@ ar@@ ina ell@@ rich , ste@@ ff@@ i gra@@ d and ker@@ sti@@ n k@@ ell@@ er@@ mann is in round 2013 / 14 of the gau@@ ob@@ er@@ lig@@ a ( highest league in the protec@@ tive eng@@ ad@@ u ) .

nato secre@@ tar@@ y-@@ general and@@ ers fo@@ gh r@@ as@@ mus@@ sen said in brussels on monday that nato is following the founding agreement of the nato / russia council of 1997 .
nato ’ s chief accused the us of &quot; one cr@@ ass brother . &quot; the agreement was not signed .
&quot; today we have to face reality that russia is not nato &apos;s partner . &quot;
documents and opinions from russian experts suggest that the &apos; that they are going to see us as oppon@@ ents &apos; .
greater nato presence
r@@ as@@ mus@@ sen also announced that nato &apos;s presence in eastern europe will be strengthened .
a compromise reached at the nato summit in wal@@ es was reached on the basis of a common position .
ki@@ e@@ v and moscow agree on new gas talks .
russia and ukraine have agreed , according to official data , to new talks to resolve their gas dispute .
the negotiations are scheduled for next saturday , the russian energy minister alexander no@@ wa@@ k said on monday .
there is still a decision by the european union to wait for it to ap@@ point a representative for the talks .
the conflict over gaza has led to the ukraine having a monopo@@ ly on fuel for weeks .
last , eu energy commissioner g@@ ün@@ ther o@@ et@@ t@@ inger medi@@ ated between the two sides .
ukraine had war@@ ned that russia could also use gas supplies for europe .
europe accounts for about a third of its natural gas from russian sources , a large proportion of which is going through ukraine .
mer@@ kel spe@@ aks the power word : tol@@ ls are &quot; clearly &quot; to come &quot; .
now the firm is committed to the need to do so again .
a licence for all the complicated details is , however , not .
persi@@ stent concerns from the c@@ du against the p@@ k@@ w tol@@ ls have made c@@ su more and more vulnerable .
chancell@@ or ang@@ ela mer@@ kel has , after ongoing opposition from her c@@ du , taken a power word for the introduction of a car tol@@ l .
&quot; to be quite clear , it is in the coalition treaty , and it will come &quot; , said the party leader , the president of the party , after meetings of the c@@ du top bodies in berlin on monday .
we are proud to announce that mer@@ kel has now decided to introduce a detailed model .
in the black and red government programme , &apos; certain parameters &apos; are mentioned .
federal transport minister alexander do@@ br@@ in@@ dt ( c@@ su ) has &quot; made a proposal , and that is now being worked on &quot; .
the n@@ r@@ w-@@ c@@ du , however , insi@@ sts on its no to a tol@@ l on all roads .
mer@@ kel stressed that finance minister wol@@ f@@ gan@@ g sch@@ ä@@ u@@ ble ( c@@ du ) also makes constructive efforts to engage in discussions on a bill .
beyond the subject , he has worked with do@@ br@@ in@@ dt on other ways of creating more private capital for investment in infrastructure , including in broad@@ band .
&quot; there is nothing special about it , &quot; sch@@ ä@@ u@@ ble had a &quot; mirror &quot; on sunday un@@ comment .
c@@ su chief hor@@ st see@@ ho@@ fer war@@ ned dar@@ k@@ ened that the us would be in the cab@@ in@@ et to impose tol@@ ls against the lead minister .
c@@ du federal vi@@ ze arm@@ in las@@ ch@@ et re@@ affir@@ med his objec@@ tions .
&quot; the coalition treaty never assumed that the entire circle and party members had the right to charge for the road , &quot; said the north r@@ hin@@ e-@@ west@@ ph@@ ali@@ an c@@ du president .
in this respect , it is an important signal that sea@@ ho@@ fer has now announced that it will discuss the issue again .
opposition to the plans also comes from the c@@ du national associations ba@@ den w@@ ür@@ t@@ tem@@ berg and rhe@@ in@@ land@@ -@@ p@@ fal@@ z .
the background to this is that there is a problem with tol@@ ls affecting small border traffic with neighbouring countries .
see@@ ho@@ fer had a lot of trouble with tol@@ l criticism from the c@@ du coalition .
the left sees the plans as a step in the right direction in the face of the union ’ s dispute .
&quot; the mur@@ k@@ s-@@ tol@@ l is dead , &quot; said the leader of the party , ber@@ nd ri@@ e@@ x@@ inger , the &quot; new os@@ n@@ ab@@ r@@ ü@@ ck ze@@ it@@ ung &quot; ( monday ) .
&quot; with the tol@@ l the minister fails &quot; . do@@ br@@ in@@ dt wants to build a vig@@ net@@ te duty on all german roads that will start in 20@@ 16 .
domestic car owners may , according to the coalition agreement , not be additionally charged .
therefore , they should be tax@@ ed in full by means of motor tax , which is why they should receive a full compensation for tol@@ ls .
the model may however be used by foreign drivers , under eu law , not because of their nation@@ ality .
genetic dis@@ order is often mis@@ diagno@@ sed , and often mis@@ diagno@@ sed .
a british person says she thought that as a result of a mis@@ diagno@@ sis , for many years , she would die .
kar@@ in ro@@ d@@ gers lived almost her entire youth in the belief that she was only a few years to live after she had been married to another disease .
it was actually suffering from the char@@ co@@ t mari@@ e to@@ oth disease ( c@@ mt ) - a group of in@@ h@@ eri@@ ted dis@@ orders that spread the ner@@ ves outside the brain and sp@@ inal cor@@ d .
char@@ ity c@@ mt uk announced that it is not possible to diagno@@ se mal@@ nutri@@ tion in people with c@@ mt , because it is so little known about this disease .
about 23@@ ,000 people in britain are likely to suffer from c@@ mt , which may lead to motor dis@@ orders such as mus@@ cle weak@@ ness , un@@ safe gear , and cur@@ ved to@@ es .
suff@@ e@@ rers also suffer from de@@ af@@ ness s@@ enti@@ ments or pain , and the disease is incur@@ able and progres@@ sively , which means that symp@@ t@@ oms are associated with time .
when ro@@ d@@ gers 13 was , she believed that she was interested in c@@ em@@ e@@ tery at@@ ax@@ y ( i@@ as ) - a disease with very poor survi@@ v@@ ability .
ro@@ d@@ gers thought she would be in a whe@@ el@@ chair before she would 18 would , and before her 30@@ th birth@@ day .
the mother of two children who are 51 years old today said : &apos; as a child , i knew that i was not the same thing as the other .
i have been falling and everything took me longer .
i never could talk to other children roll@@ er sk@@ ate@@ board or sk@@ ate@@ board and was often over@@ looked at school for my own way of going and running .
ro@@ d@@ gers said that they were 13 years old , after several operations to reli@@ eve their ach@@ ill@@ es .
&quot; i felt guil@@ ty because i was cur@@ ious to see how the european union could be a better place to live .
when i received a reply , i was sho@@ c@@ ked and was terri@@ bly al@@ armed .
i thought i was 18 in the whe@@ el@@ chair , and with 25 i would die , and in between i would slowly lose all my skills .
i made all this on my own and planned to build my own fun@@ eral .
she said when she was 17 , she realized that her skills were not as strong as she had been .
he stood up and hu@@ gged the people and said that &apos; my love , i believe not , that you have that which is war@@ m@@ th now .
i think you have a little less life@@ -@@ threat@@ ening .
after some genetic tests , her c@@ mt was found .
&quot; when he explained to me what c@@ mt was , i felt as if i were a winner .
char@@ ity c@@ mt uk has developed a c@@ m@@ t-@@ awareness report month .
stab@@ s@@ fel@@ d@@ we@@ bel a. d. ber@@ ni di@@ e@@ ther has been working since the closure of the former training place as a fire@@ work@@ er since the fire work@@ er was started .

in december 2004 , the last sharp shot fell on the tro@@ op exercise square in m@@ ün@@ sing@@ en , which was closed at the end of 2005 after 1@@ 10 years of military operation .

tax burden on business@@ people in the washington area is rising as the economy reco@@ vers .
economic recovery means more customers , more sales , and more jobs .
it also means higher taxes .
state and local tax regulations for companies in the country increased by slightly last year , while the economic recovery acceler@@ ated , so a newly published tax study in the past week , and the firms in the area of washington formed no exception .
distribu@@ tor , mar@@ y@@ land and vir@@ g@@ ini@@ a companies jointly paid 27@@ ,@@ 6 billion $ in government and local government and private finance .
the state and local tax burden of companies rose by 10 % last year , to eur 6@@ 71 billion .
government taxes rose more than local taxes , which would reduce the rate of government spending by 4.@@ 3 % , according to the study carried out by the ern@@ st &amp; young service agency , with the center for state taxation , a tax policy group .
more than half of the district ’ s tax revenues , 56 % , come from corporate taxes , while 36 % of mar@@ y@@ land ’ s income comes from businesses .
vir@@ g@@ ini@@ a achiev@@ es the lowest tax revenue from companies with 28 % .
much of the increase in tax revenues is due to a recovery in real estate values among companies , say the researchers .
while a large part of these profits come from large states such as california , new york , and tex@@ as , the process seems to have been promising for the washington area as well .
district companies , mar@@ y@@ land and vir@@ g@@ ini@@ a jointly paid more than $ 10 billion in government and local real estate taxes last year , compared to $ 9.@@ 6 billion in 2008 .
but the apparent recovery in housing values is not in mar@@ y@@ land as effective in raising interest rates and local government spending .
companies in vir@@ g@@ ini@@ a and d.@@ c. pay almost half of their government and local taxes in the form of real estate taxes .
&quot; in mar@@ y@@ land happens the following : a large proportion of real estate , especially in the tax area around d.@@ c. , is owned either by the government or by non-@@ profit organizations that do not pay real estate taxes , &quot; said dou@@ gl@@ as lin@@ d@@ aul lin@@ d@@ sta@@ at@@ ation center holm .
mar@@ y@@ land is therefore forced to pay much more attention , for example , to income taxes in order to provide the same services that other states offer .
the recent fiscal recovery by companies can no longer be con@@ fined to the housing market ’ s recovery alone .
corporate income also seems to be reco@@ vering , according to data .
companies in the region reported about income taxes on government organisations , and the figure is 2.@@ 3 billion dollars compared to 2.@@ 1 billion in 20@@ 12 .
mar@@ y@@ land took $ 1 billion in corporate income taxes , while the highest amount of the region .
while the trend towards the same direction is increasing , local tax burden on businesses is not increasing in all three places even@@ ly .
the rate of increase in the district was comparable to 4.@@ 3 % in the national average , while the increase in mar@@ y@@ land was significantly higher than in the previous year , 4.@@ 9 % .
only vir@@ g@@ ini@@ a reported an under@@ -@@ average tax revenue of 4.@@ 1 percent .
vir@@ g@@ ini@@ a has a strong record of 6 percent in all three areas of office , with significantly lower corporate income taxes ( in all three there are fixed corporate tax rates ) .
the corporate tax rate in mar@@ y@@ land is 8.@@ 25 % and in the district is relatively low .
a similar study by the us chamber of commerce earlier this year showed that in vir@@ g@@ ini@@ a , lower government and local corporate taxes were required , and overall , better fiscal conditions prevail@@ ed than in mar@@ y@@ land .
the study has identified the district as not investig@@ ating .
despite the advantages vir@@ g@@ ini@@ a is under pressure from its southern neighb@@ our .
north car@@ ol@@ ina has adopted laws to reduce its corporate tax rates this year from 6.@@ 9 % to 6 % .
if the state continues to pursue its income targets next year , this law could reduce corporate income tax by the state by 20@@ 17 to a 3 % rate .
in the meantime , it seems that small businesses in the washington area are doing better and are paying more government and local taxes , so the recent study .
corporate taxes , which are seen as personal income taxes by small business people - a transitional structure according to which most small businesses are organized - are paid in the district , mar@@ y@@ land and vir@@ g@@ ini@@ a last year by 20 % .
researchers say that the trend is not so great as to increase corporate taxes across the country .
nevertheless , the washington area could be lag@@ ging behind if spending cuts were to be made by the federal government on the labour market in the region .
partner city : german beer for gu@@ ang@@ z@@ ho@@ u ( gu@@ ang@@ z@@ ho@@ u )
ho@@ ps and mal@@ t - also in china a popular combination .
german beer enjoys a high reputation in china .
frankfurt ’ s partner city in china now wants a bre@@ w@@ ery and hopes for a direct flight connection between the two cities .
german beer , used in frankfurt &apos;s partner city gu@@ ang@@ z@@ ho@@ u .
&quot; we would be very pleased if a german bre@@ w@@ ery could establish itself in our city , &quot; said the vice-@@ party secretary of the south chinese metro@@ polis , li y@@ id@@ we@@ i , in this week &apos;s visit to a sp@@ d delegation .
time and again , the director ’ s official came to the attention of the chinese government during the course of the con@@ vers@@ ation .
gu@@ ang@@ z@@ ho@@ u , which is also can@@ ton in germany , is one of the rich@@ est cities in china , war@@ b li .
therefore , people would also have the purchasing power to buy german beer .
the hes@@ sian sp@@ d chairman thor@@ ste@@ n sch@@ ä@@ fer@@ -@@ g@@ ü@@ m@@ bel , who is the lead of the german political delegation , said to the host that he would seek a possible partner for the project in germany .
&quot; for beer , it doesn &apos;t take much : good water , gra@@ in and joy of life , &quot; he added at lunch with the party leader .
this joy of life is already b@@ lasting out mr li , he fl@@ at@@ tered to the host .
the first group of the party of european socialists was elected in january 2001 .
the chinese brand t@@ sing@@ ta@@ o is based on german bre@@ wing .
t@@ sing@@ ta@@ o beer is produced according to the german pur@@ ity law .
more business
a second wish of chinese hosts would be a direct flight connection between frankfurt and gu@@ ang@@ z@@ ho@@ u , said vice party chief and vice president li .
lu@@ f@@ than@@ sa had offered the flight earlier , but in 2012 for economic reasons it was cancelled .
&quot; it would be worth it again &quot; , the municip@@ al politici@@ an was convinced .
&quot; the business transactions between our two cities are growing ever further &quot; .
at present , travellers would have to pay the de@@ tour via chan@@ g@@ sh@@ a in hun@@ an province , li compla@@ ined .
the administration of gu@@ ang@@ d@@ ong province , whose capital is gu@@ ang@@ z@@ ho@@ u , also hopes for the airport connection .
the vice-@@ govern@@ or of the province , chen y@@ un@@ x@@ ian , put this desire to his con@@ vers@@ ation with the social democrats .
&quot; this is a very good idea &quot; , sch@@ ä@@ fer@@ -@@ g@@ ü@@ m@@ bel rep@@ lied - the chinese vice minister li j@@ in@@ ju@@ n , an in@@ timate con@@ no@@ iss@@ eur of germany , no@@ d@@ ded in agreement .
well-@@ maintained partnership
the li@@ fel@@ ess vice-president of the party , gu@@ ang@@ z@@ ho@@ u ho@@ ping that the election will bring about a successful outcome in frankfurt next year .
li yi@@ we@@ i was already in the main but not yet in this function .
he came to the office only this year , after his pre@@ dec@@ essor was arrested for corruption charges .
the local leader of the party wan q@@ ing@@ lian also had to go .
the action against officials from gu@@ ang@@ z@@ ho@@ u is part of a nation@@ wide campaign against corruption in the party and administration , which is being led by head of state x@@ i j@@ in@@ ping with tough force .
the new leader li yi@@ we@@ i had promised to leave the country before his party career .
before taking office in gu@@ ang@@ z@@ ho@@ u , he was the top official in the fu@@ ji@@ an community , where the car manufacturer had to pay a large amount of work .
frankfurt is officially more than a do@@ zen partner cities .
the connection to the 9@@ 000 km dist@@ ant gu@@ ang@@ z@@ ho@@ u is one of those that can be maintained from both sides , for example with a student exchange .
last year , the 2@@ 5-@@ year-@@ old german chinese association was celebrated .
the south chinese metro@@ polis on the river per@@ l is connected with its economic strength almost as strong as h@@ ess@@ en .
next year , it wants to set a gross domestic product of eur 250 billion , reported the commission &apos;s report .

amaz@@ on bu@@ ys t@@ wit@@ ch for 1.@@ 04 billion $
amaz@@ on confirmed just now what information is on monday morning .
the announcement comes as a surprise , not because no one has accepted t@@ wit@@ ch , but because it is widely believed that the yo@@ da program will be the company .
three months ago , it looked as if the sale of t@@ wit@@ ch to the video service of google was for a cool billion .
t@@ wit@@ ch , which was launched three years ago as ju@@ st@@ in@@ .@@ tv , was a general stre@@ aming service .
instead , it quickly became a platform for players who want to see their bra@@ v@@ ura items released in games , a &quot; you@@ tube for live games &quot; , so an in@@ sid@@ er .
the t@@ wit@@ ch interface .
and &apos; let &apos;s play &apos; , a video gen@@ re , in which better known is the ( usually older ) play a role .
it is just that you@@ tube is often called , but when you use t@@ wit@@ ch , you can see that the message you want you@@ tube to use is that you want to buy something .
it is a myster@@ y why the deal with yo@@ out@@ pu@@ t@@ su@@ be did not come about , because the company re@@ porte@@ dly was willing to pay as much as amaz@@ on .
all we are talking about at the moment is this statement by em@@ met sh@@ ar , president of t@@ wit@@ ch : &apos; we have been committed to amaz@@ on .
another secret is , frank@@ ly , the incredible success of t@@ wit@@ ch .
for s@@ no@@ bs like me who explain that they prefer to practice sports than watch , it is difficult to find the attr@@ action .
it is one thing to tell a friend at 3 o &apos;@@ clock in the morning , while they walk through resid@@ ent evil , and they are something quite different , a sp@@ in@@ ning .
all these games could be viewed right now .
another problem is that many of the most popular games today are e@@ go games , so you can only watch without your own control over the perspective .
i admit that the quick@@ est possible procedures for the european union &apos;s ro@@ ger ban@@ ni@@ sters are not being followed up by the rest of the games in record time .
but until a game or hum@@ or@@ ous game is present , it is not possible to use its t@@ wit@@ ch channel .
but what do s@@ cep@@ tics like me know ?
t@@ wit@@ ch is supported by 55 million different visitors per month and is the fourth largest source of internet traffic tips .
and how exactly does amaz@@ on want to make money out of it ?
it is difficult to imagine that t@@ wit@@ ch is as elegant as am@@ az@@ on inst@@ ant video .
but t@@ wit@@ ch has something that every company would like : thousands of young men who are advertising customers .
as the president of t@@ wit@@ ch , sh@@ ar , said , amaz@@ on and t@@ wit@@ ch &quot; both believe in the future of gaming , &quot; and this medi@@ um shows no signs of a weak economy .
on the h@@ ü@@ p@@ f@@ burg at the castle garden festival , things were going on saturday .
the concept of the organiz@@ er was right .
despite the strong ra@@ inf@@ all on saturday evening , some 10@@ ,000 people came to the town to the open air festival .
at times , the entrance had to be stopped .
&quot; that was an@@ no@@ ying , &quot; ron se@@ m , one of the organiz@@ ers said .
sal@@ we@@ del@@ l light and fun .
two spanish words have made ma@@ xi@@ m s@@ ach@@ ra@@ j and ron se@@ m the name am@@ ula .
the open air in the sal@@ we@@ del@@ er bur@@ g@@ gar@@ ten is supposed to show bri@@ ght@@ ness in the day and in the evening through various shows .
well , and the fun comes anyway from alone .
this was evident at the early saturday when the first visitors came to the open air .
a festival for all generations had the organiz@@ ers promised .
and they have succeeded .
around the supply levels on the bur@@ g@@ gar@@ ten me@@ ado@@ w , sal@@ we@@ del@@ er and also guests from the near and further surroundings had a pleasant time .
they followed the first live performances in the world , they ro@@ c@@ ked with the foot in the clock , enjoyed cool drinks - in short : pure relaxation and enjoy@@ ment were the order of the day .
and the whole of the generations .
while some people are on blan@@ kets on the extra car@@ ro@@ ted white sand on the beach bar , others are on the beach in a quarter of wine in the lab@@ ten vin@@ o@@ the@@ que , the young man was r@@ aging on the hi@@ p .
but even when children ’ s ma@@ ke@@ -up was made , the volunte@@ ers had , in the tru@@ est sense of the word , every hand to help the crow@@ d get the chance to get the best out of their imag@@ ination .
the larger used the k@@ ick@@ er@@ tables or took part in a sk@@ ate@@ board workshop , which the good@@ fo@@ o@@ d-@@ crew had taken out of sal@@ z@@ we@@ del .
until the great rain came .
just before 5.@@ 30 p.m. , he pr@@ ou@@ dly pr@@ ou@@ dly pr@@ ou@@ ded to visitors , especially families looking for the wide and dry .
but the attr@@ acti@@ veness of the festival did not break it off .
&quot; more people came than expected , &quot; said ron se@@ m , who was accompanied by a &quot; success on the whole line &quot; .
that is why i am not in favour of a repeat of the great party next year .
although the content and size of the event are still to be worked on , se@@ m made a first record on sunday in comparison with the popular vote .
it is a bit an@@ no@@ ying that in the meantime the entrance has been stopped .
obviously , the security firm was not booked with enough force .
the result : some who had already paid did not get back to the ter@@ rain .
the response is very good .
in a first cau@@ tious es@@ timate , the sal@@ tw@@ ater co-@@ organiz@@ er spoke of about 1@@ 200 visitors who were in the castle garden .
there were problems with the sound technology .
the sal@@ ty we@@ t@@ ter hi@@ p-@@ hop band bloc@@ k@@ s@@ `@@ n@@ `@@ ro@@ x bro@@ ke their appearance therefore un@@ ner@@ v@@ t .
the techn@@ ici@@ ans were unable to produce a reason@@ ably sensible sound .
the planned sh@@ ish@@ a loun@@ ges could not be built because the t@@ ents were not opened due to a ty@@ re cr@@ ash .
&quot; next year , however , you will be there , &quot; says the organiz@@ er .
the premi@@ ere of the am@@ u@@ la@@ -@@ open-@@ air was attended by the number of visitors more than succeeded .
and this in bad weather .
however , the organiz@@ ers made some mistakes which were not correc@@ ted for the first time , but at the second edition the organiz@@ ers have to be removed .
the social network fac@@ e@@ book also has to critic@@ ise the organiz@@ ers .
&quot; sorry , but for twelve euros you simply expected more , &quot; says the author mel@@ ani@@ e me@@ i@@ er .
&quot; you &apos;ve got a little bit of it , &quot; says e@@ le zim@@ mer@@ mann at the same place .
others see the initial problems not as closely as they are .
i think it is very good that some people are not only st@@ up@@ id , but also really are trying to get something on their feet .
h@@ ats off ! &quot; , ste@@ ph@@ ani@@ e wri@@ tes that to am@@ ula .
now the organiz@@ ers have one year to make these critic@@ isms .
new rad@@ om in ber@@ k@@ um : wat@@ ch@@ berg &apos;s land@@ mark is shr@@ in@@ king .
this is not as expected .
instead , the ready part is waiting for the distinc@@ tive construction to be used .
the action is in the context of a larger measure : almost 50 years after the establishment of the space observation rad@@ ar ti@@ ra , the case called rad@@ om is completely renewed .
the new rad@@ om is equipped with a di@@ ameter of 4@@ 7.@@ 5 meters a little smaller than the old one .
the size is still world record , however .
the last step to complete the new en@@ velo@@ pe is the cap@@ p@@ ella exchange .
the upper area of the old shell is separated and covered with a cr@@ ane .
after that , the last quarter of the new shell is set up .
if the weather is a part of the action , the action will be taken on stage at the beginning of this week .
participants at the ice bus stop in the city center will be able to take advantage of the opportunity to get to know the city and its surroundings .

the bur@@ g@@ vere@@ in will soon be pul@@ ling together again ?
most recently there were repeated disputes between the two wol@@ fr@@ at@@ sha@@ user bur@@ g@@ vere@@ ine .
now the boards think about possible cooperation .
as a model for the reconstruction of the wol@@ fr@@ at@@ sha@@ user castle , the late richard dic@@ h@@ at@@ h , former president of the church of wol@@ fr@@ at@@ sha@@ user bur@@ g@@ fre@@ un@@ de , led the project in french gu@@ é@@ del@@ on .
a year ago , there was no good climate between the bur@@ g@@ vere@@ in and the bur@@ g@@ fre@@ i@@ en wol@@ fr@@ at@@ sha@@ us@@ en friends .
the two countries of the european union had to be very different from each other .
now the two camps are moving up : we are about to have talks on a common approach .
this is confirmed by the club &apos;s board tor@@ ste@@ n s@@ j@@ ö@@ berg ( bur@@ g@@ vere@@ in ) and her@@ bert pi@@ ff@@ l ( friends of the bur@@ g@@ fre@@ un@@ de ) on request of our newspaper .
&quot; i have written to mr pi@@ ff@@ l and suggested that we should sit down together , &quot; says s@@ j@@ ö@@ berg .
he believes that all members of both clubs could in future be in the same position .
this allows for rapid visible success .
while the friends of the castle were fighting for the suddenly dec@@ eas@@ ed richard di@@ mb@@ ath until the last time , the castle at the mountain forest was being re@@ built , the bur@@ g@@ vere@@ in um s@@ j@@ ö@@ berg is the &quot; experience and experience &quot; .
her@@ bert pi@@ ff@@ l , the second chairman of the bur@@ g@@ fre@@ un@@ de group , has been very pleased to receive the call , according to his own information .
since di@@ mb@@ ath@@ i &apos;s death he has been standing before the bur@@ g@@ friends .
a new chairman is due to be elected in a general meeting in mid-@@ september .
at the moment , the association counts about 40 members according to the 7@@ 4-@@ year-@@ old .
&quot; after the death of my friend richard dic@@ h@@ at@@ h , we have the association activities in the form of respect .
according to pi@@ ff@@ l , the new chairman should then enter into the discussion with the bur@@ g@@ vere@@ in .

the different positions on reconstruction will be difficult to understand in the eyes of pi@@ ff@@ ls .
he is a tribute to di@@ mb@@ ath as a mis@@ sion@@ ary , who has always believed in the reconstruction of the castle .
two similar , already well advanced projects in austria and france would show that the latter is not a bu@@ zz@@ word .
the high tur@@ n@@ out of the population and the voluntary help from all over the world make them a tourist attr@@ action .
pi@@ ff@@ l : &quot; i too was at the beginning s@@ cep@@ tical .
but over time i am more and more convinced that the european union is making sense of the project .
there are nothing else .
moreover , the project would be supported by eu grants , visitor tickets and potential spon@@ sors .
&quot; the idea of reconstruction is something i personally do not want to throw out , &quot; he hopes that the bur@@ gh@@ ers will be able to do something about this .
their aim , first docum@@ enting history , &quot; is important and good &quot; .

cle@@ ver ways to save money at uni@@ -@@ tex@@ t@@ books .
since the costs of uni@@ -@@ tex@@ t@@ books for many students exceed $ 1@@ ,000 a year , the university ’ s fa@@ st-@@ second sem@@ ester considered the costs of the university .
he inven@@ ted a lo@@ an system for books of students of higher sem@@ est@@ ers and offered a nom@@ inal compensation to help them find their way back .
&quot; my mathem@@ a@@ tics book normally costs $ 18@@ 0 , but i got it for $ 10 for a sem@@ ester and a chi@@ p movie .
the time allocated for the last sem@@ ester should have given him $ 4@@ 30 , he said .
he gave $ 120 .
the college management shared the responsibility of the student in average of more than 1.@@ 200 $ per year for tex@@ t@@ books and study materials , that there is no need for different cost increases for the students .
online stores and creative approaches are the key to success .
ren@@ ting tex@@ t@@ books is becoming more popular , and students can book a book sem@@ ester long .
ne@@ e@@ bo inc , which has more than 250 university books , is one of the leading companies in the world for the rental of tex@@ t@@ books since 2011 .
po@@ lls in the industry show that around a quarter of the books in the college books are in circulation last spring .
less than half of all tex@@ t@@ books are published by the national association of col@@ leg@@ es and col@@ leg@@ es in camp@@ us book@@ shops .
here is the one-@@ time bet for the best deals .
online shopping
some new books cost just one third of the price online , for which they are available in camp@@ us book@@ shop .
the n@@ in@@ th edition of &quot; calcul@@ us &quot; v@@ no ron lar@@ w@@ on , bru@@ ce ed@@ war@@ ds and robert ho@@ the@@ t@@ ler cost almost 2@@ 90 $ , but can be found at the specialized book@@ sel@@ lers che@@ gg@@ .com .
used buy used buy
if you don &apos;t like the notes of other or normal usage tracks , you can use them for the first time .
&quot; cal@@ cul@@ us &quot; is used on che@@ gg@@ .com for 9@@ 3.@@ 49 $ to have .
mat@@ t cas@@ day , 25 , gradu@@ ate student at the bri@@ g@@ ham young university , uk , says that he is on amaz@@ on@@ .com 42 c@@ ents .
the book has been sold for $ 48 .
aca@@ dem@@ ics like ing@@ rid br@@ ac@@ ey , head of the university of mass@@ ach@@ us@@ et@@ ts at the am@@ her@@ st college vienna , have been working on the new york times since the beginning of the 20th century .
sometimes the updates are not available for the seminar work .
in such cases , older spending can often be spent for a fr@@ action of the cost of the latest issue .
except che@@ g@@ g and amaz@@ on , hal@@ f@@ .com is also available from e@@ bay inc . , a popular alternative for used books .

ren@@ ting tex@@ t@@ books is a consideration worth considering if you want to make it reason@@ ably good , remember to use them back and you want to search the books after the course has been completed .
you can earn more than 80 percent of the cost of a new book .
a student could , for example , use &quot; calcul@@ us &quot; for a sem@@ ester for about $ 20 .
find out more about the terms of business where you rent , even about the penalty fees , which may be applicable to writing tickets .
ren@@ ters pay attention : if you don &apos;t want to return the book , the penalty fees may include the price of a new book .
e-@@ books
e-@@ books instead of conventional teaching books are also an option .
sometimes these books are de fac@@ to ren@@ ted by electronic licen@@ ses for a certain period of time by whol@@ es@@ al@@ ers such as amaz@@ on@@ .com , che@@ g@@ g and bar@@ nes &amp; no@@ ble inc@@ . . .
at che@@ g@@ g you can choose &quot; calcul@@ us &quot; for 6 months for about $ 61 .
br@@ ac@@ ey says that students in literature courses often have the best offers , as many classical literature students are downloaded for free today , while scientific and engineering students are free to use the most expensive tex@@ t@@ books .
in any case , look around .
jo@@ e ga@@ ult , 29 , who will soon be the pe@@ p@@ per@@ d@@ ine law school , will recommend that you take a look at the is@@ b@@ n number for the price determination of books , because you can be so sure of the right book .
and before or@@ dering online , check how ga@@ ult can be used to make sure the book is in stock .
this lesson was learned from the hard tour .

an article of the te@@ leg@@ raph film cri@@ tic rob@@ bi@@ e col@@ lin suggests that the film is not the same as the lack of quality in the films .
col@@ lin called 20@@ 14 &quot; the worst year &quot; so far for children &apos;s films , and described &quot; dr@@ ach@@ en@@ z@@ ä@@ h@@ men made easy 2 &quot; as purely &quot; functional &quot; fant@@ as@@ y sequ@@ el .
in films for a slightly older target group , however , it seems that the quality of the films is not necessarily the problem .
in july , entertainment weekly compared the same number of people who had previously lived in cinem@@ as@@ co@@ res and me@@ tac@@ ri@@ tic for each summer movie start , which was fil@@ med between the american mem@@ orial day and july 20 , 2013 .
the results are based on the opinion of the cinema visitors and film cri@@ tics and indicate that the film is not going to be shown to the film h@@ its of last year .
some comm@@ ent@@ ators believe that developments are changing in the way we see and the growing popul@@ arity of web stre@@ aming services .
director j@@ on fav@@ re@@ au , who is currently working on dis@@ ney ’ s upcoming jun@@ g@@ le book film , is saying to the site hun@@ gel@@ bu@@ ch .
we have to accept this and not try to follow the past .
unlike the current weak c@@ s@@ f results , the ho@@ ll@@ y@@ wood produc@@ tions have yi@@ el@@ ded a significant increase in revenue recently .
last summer , the director cri@@ tici@@ zed ste@@ ven spi@@ el@@ berg for not having been able to make a huge impact on film produc@@ tions by com@@ ics .
in the light of the current down@@ turn , some comm@@ ent@@ ators argue that its glo@@ om@@ y pro@@ ph@@ ec@@ y is a true core .
due to the global financial crisis that we expect in the summer of 20@@ 15 , including aven@@ gers : age of ul@@ tr@@ on , mini@@ ons and jur@@ as@@ sic world , other representatives of the film industry are more optim@@ istic :
the producer of x-@@ men , sim@@ on kin@@ berg , described the decline in the cash out@@ comes recently as simple &quot; cy@@ clic@@ al &quot; and said to ho@@ ll@@ y@@ wood records .
when the second table tennis tournament was held in the district of munich some years ago , for the ti@@ ghten@@ ing of the lig@@ a division , this is a step in the right direction .
now the german table tennis federation has an additional 3rd bun@@ des@@ lig@@ a .
the consequence : those who did not rise have dro@@ pped .
g@@ ö@@ tt@@ ingen has , for example , set the highest class team tor@@ pe@@ do in the ob@@ er@@ lig@@ a release , but it is still playing a major role in the coming season .

s@@ g leng@@ ler@@ n and the tor@@ pe@@ do reserve are in the new ver@@ ban@@ ds@@ li@@ ga .
the ladies play the tt@@ v ge@@ is@@ mar in the association league .
what is different from the composition is a better district class , now the new district class .

it is striking that none of the six 2nd classes should be reached , but the first step is to develop the innovative and ex@@ hil@@ ar@@ ating circle board .
nato summit : first pro@@ tests in new@@ port and car@@ di@@ ff
at the weekend there were pro@@ tests from oppon@@ ents of the nato summit in new@@ port .
on saturday , hundreds of people gathered in the centre of new@@ port to celebrate an anti-@@ nato march .
on sunday , around 150 people arrived in car@@ di@@ ff in front of the town hall to find a so-called counter@@ -@@ summit .
ste@@ ph@@ en fair@@ cl@@ ough has the most recent developments for us and has worked with demonstr@@ ators who have come from brid@@ ge@@ -@@ belgium .

a search force from local police and rescue teams is being forced to return to the country and the couple were killed at about 11 p.m. near the bri@@ dal ve@@ il water@@ falls .
the girl had to in@@ ju@@ red on the k@@ ne@@ e and the man was top@@ ped and had be@@ aten his head .
rescue forces remained above the ground over@@ night , and they were arrested on monday morning .
they were built in a stable condition with a am@@ bul@@ ance in the blue mountains hospital .

the approximately 1000 demonstr@@ ators were killed by soldiers from the p@@ tv building .

dead or in@@ ju@@ red have not been reported .
the demonstr@@ ators are calling for the re@@ sign@@ ation of the prime minister , to whom they are acc@@ using electoral fraud .
the police said that about one kil@@ ome@@ tre from the residence of the prime minister , na@@ wa@@ z shar@@ if , it was on monday to be cl@@ ash@@ ed again by around 3@@ 000 demonstr@@ ators with security forces .
according to hospital data , a polic@@ em@@ an was in@@ ju@@ red .
at the weekend , at least three people were killed and more than 500 in@@ ju@@ red than demonstr@@ ators tried to sh@@ ari@@ f &apos;s residence .
they are calling for the prime minister to resi@@ gn .
the powerful military had a strong mandate on sunday evening after a meeting in the army headquarters .
the other point was that the communication said : &apos; the army remains committed to guaranteeing the security of the state &apos; .
the es@@ cal@@ ating violence has created concern about military intervention .
the opposition leader , im@@ ran k@@ hur@@ an , and the pre@@ ach@@ er ta@@ h@@ ir@@ u@@ l q@@ ad@@ ri , have continued to pro@@ long since independence day on 14 august .
shar@@ if re@@ jects a re@@ sign@@ ation .

q@@ ad@@ ri expressed a similar view .
kh@@ an acc@@ uses shar@@ if of not supporting the parliamentary election last may by che@@ ating .
q@@ ad@@ ri calls for the re@@ sign@@ ation of central and provin@@ cial governments .
then a transitional government is to reform the electoral system and call for new elections .
more than 40 000 security forces are in operation to protect the government quarter .
the demonstr@@ ators had initially peace@@ fully in front of parliament , but they were still not able to get kh@@ an and q@@ ad@@ ri to do so at the weekend .
h@@ ü@@ t@@ tel@@ dor@@ fer after second season victory in place three of the table .
2 : 0 on gr@@ ö@@ di@@ g has been a bi@@ zar@@ re week on sunday for rapi@@ de .
&quot; the victory is very liber@@ ating , &quot; said tra@@ iner z@@ or@@ an bar@@ ic , whose team with the out in europe leader , on thursday a meeting in the middle of the race .
&quot; the success experience was un@@ he@@ eded , &quot; he confirmed .
sch@@ ram@@ mel@@ -@@ dre@@ am@@ tor brings rapid to sie@@ ger@@ stra@@ ß@@ e rapid has started the second season victory the right response to the dis@@ appointment against hel@@ sin@@ ki and goes with a success goal .
&quot; we wanted to show a positive response , &quot; said out@@ sid@@ er thomas sch@@ ram@@ me@@ l , who with his splendid leadership vol@@ ley of the six@@ teenth century was able to win the way to victory .
&quot; i thought i had a look at the fru@@ stration of thursday and i was getting a little bit of a bit of a r@@ ough ch@@ ase &quot; , said the 2@@ 6-@@ year-@@ old sm@@ ile .
as a sm@@ ash on the 13@@ th nov@@ member 2010 , for the last time in a bun@@ des@@ lig@@ a game , the result was still very good for ried .
the first championship meeting in the rapi@@ d-@@ d@@ ress will be held in special memory .
&quot; for me , this is something very special , i am from the rapid new@@ com@@ er &quot; , said sch@@ ram@@ me@@ l .
due to the short term bec@@ k-@@ b@@ lower of mari@@ o pa@@ ve@@ lic , sch@@ ra@@ m@@ me@@ l moved from the left to the right def@@ ensive side and made the right side of the co@@ in very good .
he has enough experience to take this position on a mir@@ r@@ or-@@ in@@ ver@@ ted basis .
the gate has earned it , he has already won several assi@@ sts this year , &quot; p@@ raised bar@@ i@@ sic .
team shows character sch@@ ram@@ me@@ l also provided the f@@ lan@@ k to 2 : 0 through court man@@ sion after good one hour , which finally took the decision .
because we could have been writing to the guests before that .
&quot; thank god , we have been lu@@ cky today , &quot; he also noticed .
b@@ ari@@ sic even found that it was &quot; in many games before , better than it is today &quot; - against &quot; the strong@@ est team , which is in the season at this sta@@ dium &quot; .
the first three-@@ point limit since july 26 has therefore proved that the team &apos;s structure is the set@@ back for the fight .
for him , it is no less pleas@@ ing : &apos; that we finally played again to zero &apos; .
a lot of work during the country break also the fact that with bri@@ an beh@@ ren@@ dt , mari@@ o pa@@ ve@@ li@@ c , christian ros@@ ner and others , we are able to offer our services .
&quot; we must not forget this , &quot; bar@@ it@@ as war@@ ned , who was in the last three days with beh@@ ren@@ dt and pa@@ ve@@ lic players .
the country break must be made sufficient to allow the country to &quot; w@@ ound &quot; and to stay in the physical area a little bit &quot; , explained bar@@ it@@ as .
one of the reasons why the break is so important is that captain ho@@ f@@ mann .
it is te@@ aring up for the team , going beyond pain and pain .
it is precisely at this difficult stage that he has shown that he is a very important player for us , &quot; said bar@@ i@@ sic .
ho@@ f@@ mann gave the game rapid before it was replaced in the 6@@ 8@@ th minute not only the structure but achieved a good result .
for the 3@@ 3-@@ year-@@ old who has been to the 3@@ 50 league , the team was able to win the first match from the game since 2 november 2013 ( 4 : 2 on the ad@@ mi@@ ra ) .
ho@@ f@@ mann : &quot; may not believe that now everything is good &quot; &quot; we certainly also have a bit of lu@@ ck , but eventually must be lu@@ ck also to us .
it is now high time , &quot; said ho@@ f@@ mann .
he war@@ ned , however , that we should continue to work in a concentrated way : &apos; we must not always see this in black and white &apos; .
we have seen no progress in recent weeks as badly as has been made .
however , we must not believe that everything is now good .
the importance of his role for the team was not dispu@@ ted .
it is a very young team that i have been very helpful to me at the moment .
they are in some stages , but i think they are not .
gr@@ ö@@ di@@ g co@@ ach michael bau@@ r and his team had little to blame .
he regre@@ t@@ ted the rapid &quot; opposite &quot; from the category mag@@ ici@@ an &quot; , as well as the regular gate of n@@ ut@@ z at the 40@@ th minute , which was taken over by re@@ fe@@ re@@ es colle@@ gi@@ ate un@@ fairly .
the only acc@@ us@@ ation i have heard from the team is that we are heading towards the goal in some ph@@ ases not concrete enough .
we have not achieved enough .
interior def@@ en@@ der maxim@@ ili@@ an kar@@ ner saw it similarly : &quot; it started badly , then we started to find in and even made a ga@@ te@@ way .
by and large , it would have been more .
under this wh@@ ir@@ l@@ pool , the rest re@@ ign@@ s .
a powerful tri@@ be we showed in our pu@@ zz@@ le task of the summer series &quot; my play of the rh@@ ö@@ n@@ ner lu@@ ck &quot; last friday .

vital is the natural mon@@ ument , it is a place of peace and quiet over the other trees of the surrounding area .
a small bud@@ d@@ ha on a tre@@ e-@@ st@@ um@@ p indicates that there are two different kinds of spiritual or my@@ s@@ tical places .

dr. wol@@ f@@ gan@@ g sch@@ nei@@ der has additionally visited the bis@@ ho@@ ps ’ archive and has invited older people from un@@ ter@@ wei@@ ß@@ en@@ brun@@ n to learn what their family is doing with the s@@ cour@@ ge .
the result of his research was the rather so@@ ber explanation for the name .

at the foot of the tree , the v@@ ines covered by the rise should be used to rest .

the area is also the core of the bio@@ sphere reserve of the bio@@ sphere reserve , sch@@ nei@@ der has further found out .
when entering the stone collections , you should be careful , however , to avoid the damage caused by the sun .

after weeks of tu@@ g-@@ of-@@ war , italy ’ s premier and president-in-office of the eu , mat@@ te@@ o ren@@ zi , has pro@@ tested against strong conservative opposition at last week ’ s eu special summit .
ren@@ zi sees the government as a daily newspaper la reputation , and the government is also looking at the voc@@ ation of his own people , who are also fav@@ ored in the government team .
it also exp@@ ects this to be a boost for its &apos; reform package &apos; in italy .
last but not least , ren@@ zi hopes that the rec@@ ur@@ rent opposition to him will also be able to remain calm .
the conservative representatives of president je@@ an-@@ cla@@ ude jun@@ ck@@ er and the council president , who is elected as president of the council , will be called don@@ ald tus@@ k , according to the prevail@@ ing opinion in rome , so that political balance can be achieved .
the chief diplom@@ at of the eu will be depu@@ ty of the president of the commission , mr jun@@ ck@@ er .
the outstanding agreement of the european parliament is considered to be safe .
otherwise , president gi@@ or@@ gio na@@ polit@@ ano would have rejected the nom@@ ination of the 4@@ 1@@ th anniversary of the leader of the democratic party ( p@@ d ) .
la re@@ pub@@ b@@ lic@@ a spre@@ ads optim@@ ism that the reforms that have been taking place in leading party offices for almost two decades will be a mu@@ gh@@ al success for the &quot; enormous challenges &quot; that are known for their ambition .
the native roman@@ s are married and have two children .
her party career began with the doc@@ tor@@ ate of political scienti@@ st in 1996 at the youth organization of the then democr@@ ati@@ ci di s@@ ini@@ stra ( lef@@ t-@@ democrats ) , which was established in 2008 with the catho@@ lic center party .
in 1999 , mo@@ gh@@ er@@ ini was vice-president of the european community for three years of soci@@ alism and social development ( european youth socialist organisation ) .
with the 2001 election to the lin@@ k@@ s@@ democrats ’ party council , it moved to the high party politics , worked in the foreign policy department , whose head it was soon appointed .
she occupied traditional fo@@ cal points of italian foreign policy , such as the middle east , was replaced by studies on nato operations in afghanistan , where italy was sta@@ tioned with a cont@@ ingent of troops , and maintained contacts with social democrats in europe and elsewhere .
since 2008 she has been a member of the chamber of depu@@ ties , in which she is an expert on defence and european and international affairs .
when ren@@ zi was elected prime minister in february 20@@ 14 , he appointed mo@@ gh@@ er@@ ini as his foreign minister .
if the p@@ d is to have a better relationship with the strong peace movement in the country today , which is one of the party &apos;s more than 40 % votes in may &apos;s eu elections , then , as in p@@ d cir@@ cles , it has re@@ marked .
the commission is not aware of the acc@@ us@@ ations in brussels that the new eu foreign affairs agency has too little diplomatic experience , so there is no substance in the p@@ d .
in brussels , the most important of these is the po@@ les and the baltic members , who are susp@@ ici@@ ously putting forward realistic priorities for mo@@ gh@@ er@@ in@@ is about the crisis in ukraine and are described as a &apos; pro-@@ russia course &apos; .
it supports the efforts made by the russian company ga@@ z@@ pro@@ m so@@ wing stream , which is being discussed by the russian gas company in by@@ passing ukraine .
after ren@@ zi left office in july as eu president , he was ready to travel to the united states .
photos you can share with putin at sha@@ ke@@ -@@ hands are now being taken in brussels with ou@@ tr@@ age , as are the fact that they have not yet been able to convince the kre@@ m@@ lin chief to hold a milan economic summit .
a total of nine young people completed their training at em@@ z-@@ han@@ au@@ er in n@@ ab@@ burg on monday .
below is an az@@ u@@ bi that has already completed a different training in the company .
in four training occup@@ ations , the new employees are working in the future : electronics professionals ( three ap@@ pre@@ n@@ tic@@ es ) , mec@@ hat@@ ron@@ ics ( two ) , machine tools mechan@@ ics ( two ) and process mechan@@ ics ( two ) .
all az@@ u@@ b@@ is come from the district of sch@@ w@@ and@@ dorf : to@@ bi@@ as bra@@ un and thomas b@@ ü@@ cher@@ l from sch@@ war@@ z@@ ach , ste@@ fan br@@ ick@@ l and fl@@ ori@@ an re@@ wit@@ zer from sch@@ mid@@ ga@@ den , joh@@ ann@@ es be@@ vor@@ nes be@@ e@@ he .
the new tra@@ ine@@ es previously visited the main or medium-sized schools and real@@ sch@@ u@@ len .
from wednesday to friday , the tra@@ ine@@ es from all ages and the tra@@ in@@ ers will be able to attend a team training event in ob@@ er@@ am@@ mer@@ ga@@ u , where a full day hi@@ ke and ra@@ fting on the inn are on the program .
the company is a german company with 4@@ 35 employees and 9@@ 50 employees worldwide .

the socialists in france should &apos; stop the mouth and let france get it right &apos; , said the main ally of fran@@ co@@ is hol@@ lan@@ de .
mr v@@ alls called for the deeply divided left to vote against the report .
the president deserves everyone &apos;s respect , he deserves our loy@@ alty , he deserves our support .
&quot; it is our duty to stand shoul@@ der to shoul@@ der , &quot; he said with great applause .
as a appe@@ as@@ ement , the prime minister insi@@ sted that his government should not allow the controversial 3@@ 5-@@ hour week in france , despite strong calls for a relaxation of the rules by em@@ manu@@ el ma@@ dele@@ ine .
on saturday , mr hol@@ lan@@ de had ur@@ ged his fellow socialists to &apos; un@@ ite &apos; with the government .
but christi@@ ane tau@@ bir@@ a , the minister for justice , is stre@@ aming sand into the ge@@ ar@@ box , in which she is playing at a meeting of dis@@ gu@@ ised socialist members .
marine le pen , which is far right in the national front , is mo@@ c@@ ked by the constant tren@@ ch fighting of the socialists and said that she was un@@ sure about the future of the new v@@ alls government .

putin is demanding ki@@ e@@ v to include &quot; state and government talks &quot; with the east ukraine .
russian president v@@ la@@ di@@ mir putin demanded that russian media reports show that on sunday , the ukra@@ inian government was going to stop fighting the separ@@ ati@@ sts in the east of the country and immediately start negotiations on the &apos; state@@ hood &apos; of the arm@@ ament .
his spo@@ kes@@ man di@@ mit@@ ri pes@@ ko@@ v later made it clear that putin was not referring to the fact that the country was under the control of the separ@@ ati@@ st region of eastern ukraine .
putin ’ s call to the ki@@ e@@ v government to negotiate on an equal foot@@ ing with pro-@@ russian insur@@ g@@ ents , however , f@@ its in with the view he has taken five months since the start of the ri@@ ots five months ago : help for the iraq@@ is .
in an interview with the state television channel e@@ ins , putin condemned the ukra@@ inian government &apos;s military campaign to re@@ con@@ qu@@ er the region &apos;s occupied territories .
the kre@@ m@@ lin and the separ@@ ati@@ sts have recently adopted the land they have taken as &apos; no@@ vor@@ o@@ si@@ ja &apos; or &apos; ne@@ us@@ sia &apos; , a term that is remin@@ is@@ cent of pre-@@ revolutionary spl@@ end@@ our of the russian empire .
putin pointed out that the whole of those who were arrested in the course of the ukra@@ inian politicians ’ campaigns for the elections on 26 october , and while government groups were supporting civil communities in the separ@@ ati@@ sts ’ areas , the government was not .
&quot; we need to start detailed discussions immediately , not only on technical issues , but also on the political organisation of society and the state status of south-@@ east ukraine in order to protect the interests of the people living there , &quot; he said .
pes@@ ko@@ v said that putin ’ s reference to the state of the country in the context of greater autonomy would have to be seen , which has been ignored for months by ki@@ e@@ v ’ s leadership to dis@@ pel fears in rus@@ si@@ an-@@ speaking areas .
only the ukra@@ inian government can help the eastern regions to achieve the necessary autonomy , pes@@ ko@@ v said .
this is not a question of negotiations between ukraine and russia , said pes@@ ko@@ v , &apos; because it is not a conflict between russia and ukraine , but a conflict between russia and ukraine &apos; .
the clari@@ fication of the kre@@ m@@ lin &apos;s speaker to correct the &apos; mis@@ interpretation &apos; of putin &apos;s regime of remarks under@@ lined the leadership claim of russia in dealing with the separ@@ ati@@ st re@@ bel@@ lion in the east , unlike the direct opposition .
moscow could have experienced far greater difficulties in getting the don@@ et@@ sk and lu@@ han@@ sk regions in eastern ukraine .
the autonomy that russian diplom@@ ats claim at international for@@ a is not going to give regional governments in ukraine full power .
the agreement that was anne@@ xed five months ago in the black sea is the home port of the european union for most of the russian na@@ vy and an important trading port and historic coastal region .
the regions between the ro@@ sto@@ v region in russia and the cri@@ me@@ a are also rich in mines , fac@@ tories and foun@@ dri@@ es , which are important components for the russian military .
the ukra@@ inian president pe@@ tr@@ o por@@ o@@ sh@@ en@@ ko proposed in his speech on january 7 , that the government should be able to apply ukra@@ inian legislation - after new elections - on the constitution .
but his notion of autonomy seems to be in sharp contrast to that of the kre@@ m@@ lin and the separ@@ ati@@ st re@@ be@@ ls , whose arm@@ ament and out@@ bur@@ st are motivated by moscow .
putin ’ s last call to ki@@ e@@ v to start separ@@ ati@@ st leaders on an equal foot@@ ing is a response to the recent visit by the us to the re@@ be@@ ls .
russia &apos;s separ@@ ati@@ sts are now taking over the country in a hand@@ sha@@ ke , which , according to the fears of ukra@@ inian security officials , is the first step in a campaign to take over the strategic coastal region to cri@@ me@@ a .
that is why massive civilian and military preparations are needed .

thousands of foreign troops and hundreds of foreign tan@@ ks are now on the territory of ukraine .
the eu summit did not take any concrete action to demand leadership from the eu and the eu member states to impose further sanctions on russia , which would lead to an un@@ specified es@@ cal@@ ation of the ukra@@ inian crisis .
ukra@@ inian soldiers had to move away from their positions in il@@ o@@ wa@@ j@@ sk after two russian tan@@ k colon@@ ies and 1,@@ 00@@ 0-@@ soldiers were killed in the don@@ et@@ sk region last week .

the ha@@ w@@ k responsible for this is probably having 60 nu@@ de photos of law@@ rence , star from &quot; the tri@@ bes of pan@@ em &quot; and of super@@ stars .
the austr@@ ali@@ an ac@@ t@@ res@@ a pal@@ mer , em@@ ily brow@@ ning , y@@ v@@ on@@ ne stra@@ ho@@ v@@ ski , and g@@ rec@@ ko from mel@@ bour@@ ne were also supposed to have taken private photos as a result of an ic@@ l@@ oud .

all private letters and images should remain private .
it is a sh@@ ame that private information has been sto@@ len and passed on to others .
gre@@ ck@@ o , currently in new york , re@@ porte@@ dly said that a news website that the h@@ ack &quot; sh@@ ame@@ ful &quot; and that the people affected &quot; in@@ ju@@ red &quot; .
the h@@ ack@@ er probably has 30 images of pal@@ mer with her ex@@ -@@ friend scot@@ t spe@@ ed@@ man , including two sho@@ ts in which she has been up without a pool .
the film works of pal@@ mers include &quot; love is inv@@ inci@@ ble &quot; with li@@ am hem@@ s@@ worth .
pal@@ mer , ch@@ uc@@ k-@@ star stra@@ ho@@ v@@ ski and the ac@@ tress brow@@ ning from suc@@ ker pun@@ ch were yesterday for comments on the h@@ acked images not available .
a representative law@@ rence said to t@@ m@@ z : &quot; there is a waste of time and money in the private sphere . &quot;
actors se@@ th ro@@ gen condemned the h@@ ack@@ er in his t@@ we@@ et : &quot; h@@ acked and un@@ cap@@ tured images from a mobile phone is nothing different from the sale of h@@ he@@ h@@ ler@@ ware . &quot;
from a purely legal point of view , the re@@ distribution of sto@@ len images should not be toler@@ ated .
cy@@ cli@@ sts , jo@@ gg@@ ers and hi@@ kers were present at the 8@@ th bike race on the big fel@@ d@@ berg yesterday and thus won the &quot; help for cancer children &quot; association .
the tour , which is a tor@@ tu@@ r for some , was a light@@ weight training for others .
in one , however , everyone agreed that it was fun .
thomas stu@@ dan@@ ski was probably well sle@@ pt last night .
for the first time in his life , the head of the ob@@ er@@ ur@@ sel bre@@ w@@ ery was in the middle of yesterday with his bike on the fel@@ d@@ berg .
for the good cause .
the small mus@@ cle co@@ at@@ ings can be easily st@@ uck away , especially as he is not allowed to participate in the 8@@ th bike on the big fel@@ d@@ berg in favour of the association &quot; help for cancer children &quot; ( frankfurt ) .
a great thing .
&quot; i now know that i can do this - great ! &quot;
small brus@@ h on the way in the ap@@ ple@@ -@@ cur@@ ve ?
ne@@ e , once i had stopped , would have been from .
as thomas stu@@ dan@@ ski , who is responsible for the c@@ du in the upper ur@@ sel@@ -@@ urban parliament , is ag@@ on@@ ising many of the 7@@ 18 participants yesterday in spring and came to the exhaus@@ tion close , but happy .
others , by contrast , found it easier to reach the 1@@ 1-@@ kil@@ ome@@ tre route between ho@@ he@@ mark and fel@@ d@@ berg .
nor@@ man di@@ e@@ ß@@ ner , for example .
the red , white , green and red green politici@@ an is the first to be elected in the european parliament .
he is also the route in a sli@@ de , as is n@@ ina ku@@ hn , pres@@ s@@ es@@ pre@@ cher of the city of ob@@ er@@ ur@@ sel , who together with frank gr@@ ü@@ e@@ is@@ en started to do .
for the two tri@@ athle@@ tes the &quot; fel@@ d@@ berg cycling &quot; was not necessarily a sporting challenge : &quot; here &apos;s the question of char@@ ity , because we are happy to be there - a way out would be already possible today .
on the way they had paul w@@ en@@ z@@ el from ob@@ er@@ re@@ i@@ f@@ en@@ berg .
the young ( 12 ) was in the morning to ob@@ er@@ ur@@ sel to get back to the height immediately after that .
the frankfurt fl@@ ori@@ an or@@ nam@@ ental had a meeting at 9 a.m. at home in the morning .
i also had fun &quot; fr@@ it@@ ten@@ ton@@ i &quot; .
for the head of the ob@@ er@@ ur@@ sel k@@ ul@@ t@@ ki@@ os@@ k , cycling tours across the fel@@ d@@ berg are just one of them .
he had a very good record with his 6@@ ,@@ 5 kil@@ o racing bike .
a cra@@ zy event .
for this purpose - i am happy to be there &quot; , andre@@ as bal@@ z@@ ke said .
the dur@@ able main@@ zer says of itself that the main@@ zer is an &quot; ambitious racing bike &quot; .
he must be , because he was not satisfied with the &quot; fix@@ ie wheel &quot; , which is not the same as racing bi@@ kes , but without a circuit ...
the fact that it is easy to go up without a wheel , not only the 20 hi@@ kers who clim@@ b the white wall and the fo@@ o@@ th@@ ills of the mountain clim@@ b up , but also a jo@@ gger who takes part in a cor@@ d .
mountain guard doctor professor vol@@ ker li@@ sch@@ ke , the chief medical officer of the university of vienna , who is equipped with his team , with all-@@ wheel bul@@ ly and qu@@ ad , said : &quot; the ken@@ n &quot; i from frankfurt , trained .
the 7@@ 18 participants - and with them as many as never before - were in groups on the track in the morning .
the hi@@ kers first arrive at 9.@@ 30 a.m.
the first cy@@ cli@@ sts and run@@ ners followed at 10 am .
five minutes later , the first mountain bi@@ kers started to go .
b@@ ent han@@ sen , chairman of the association &quot; cycling on the big fel@@ d@@ berg &quot; , gave the start comm@@ ands and w@@ ished the participants a nice trip .
for next year , he hopes that it will succeed in turning the line up to fel@@ d@@ berg to the safety of the participants .
