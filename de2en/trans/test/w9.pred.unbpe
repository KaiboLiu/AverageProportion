a retrospective of the very american ideal of labour rights as human rights
congress mps keith ellison and john lewis have tabled a legislative proposal to promote trade union organization as a civil right .
&quot; just as unions die , so do middle-class jobs , &quot; ellison , a minnesota democrat , and deputy chairman of the progressive caucus in congress .
i am therefore proud to be part of the staff council , together with the civil rights icon john lewis .
this groundbreaking law gives workers the same legal opportunities in discrimination against the organization of trade unions as in other forms of discrimination - thus stopping anti-union forces .
the addition of the national labour law act to provide a possibility for workers who are exposed to discrimination to organise trade union representation to be tried in a civil court for justice - and to demand compensation or penalty money - is also necessary .
but it is certainly not a radical initiative - at least not according to american standards .
indeed , the best way to understand what ellison , lewis , and the other sponsors of their legislative proposal suggest is to link back to a very american idea .
despite the setbacks that trade unions have suffered in recent years - in wisconsin , michigan and other states throughout the country - americans once welcomed countries around the world to exercise labor rights that are not .
there was a time when millions of americans remembered when that country was building democracy , freedom of speech , freedom of the press and the right of association in one breath .
when the united states occupied japan after world war ii , general douglas mac arthur and his staff encouraged the country to adopt a constitution that would ensure that the militiated autocracy heedkrae hedged .
aware that workers and their unions have a role to play in creating a new japan , they used a language that explicitly favors the “ new japan ” .
when the united states occupied germany after world war ii , general dwight urged david eisenhower and his staff to write a constitution that would ensure that fascism was adolf hitler ’ s strong democracy .
recognizing the fact that workers need to organize themselves , and raise their voices in the new nation , the germans added a clause that explicitly states that : &quot; the right to unite .
agreements that restrict or aim to restrict this right are zero .
when the former first lady eleanor roosevelt presided over the international commission on human rights , which issued the universal declaration of human rights , as it was adopted by the united nations in 1948 as a global agreement .
for generations , americans have accepted the basic premise that labor rights are human rights .
when that country told other countries how to shape civil and democratic societies , americans declared that the right to establish a trade union - and to do so , that union would then be handed over to collective negotiations as an equal partner .
after these rights were under attack in america , it is indeed wise to reconsider the american ideal , which is that the working population has the right to choose and to live .
as pastor martin luther king jr. said 50 years ago :
history is a great teacher .
now everyone knows that the labor movement did not limit the strength of the nation , but increased it .
raising the standard of living of millions of people miraculously created a market for industry and inadvertently shifted the entire nation to unimaginable levels of production .
those who attack the work forget these simple truths , but history preserves them .
history remembers , and we should do so .
formal recognition of labour rights as human rights - and the extension of the protection of civil rights as a protection against discrimination in the creation of employee representatives - is long overdue .
keith ellison and john lewis renew the ideals that have made america big in the past and delivered on the promise of democracy .
judge temporarily stops the law that all abortion clinics in louisiana could force to close down .
a us federal judge stopped the implementation of a law in louisiana on sunday , from which lawyers say that it would probably lead to the closure of all five abortion clinics in the state .
this measure , which was supported by bobby jindal , governor of louisiana , was adopted by the law in june and is due to enter into force on 1 september , would allow doctors who carry out abortions to be banned .
the judge &apos;s decision , however , means that for the time being doctors can continue to carry out legal abortions while requesting such a right .
&quot; the plaintiffs can continue to work in accordance with the law , while they are striving to obtain these rights , &quot; federal judge john degravelles wrote in his judgment .
within a month , a hearing will be arranged for the judge to ensure that the law is made more permanent .
advocates of abortion welcomed the decision to reject the latest in a series of judgments against similar measures , saying that doctors would have needed more time to obtain hospital permission .
&quot; today &apos;s decision means that women in louisiana are escaping a disgusting law that wants to take their health and their rights , &quot; said nancy northup , president and chair of the centre for reproductive rights ,
it was not immediately clear whether the judgment would also apply to doctors from the two clinics who had been unable to join the complaint and also have applications for authorisation .
louisiana is one of 11 states that have adopted similar laws , with courts recently taking such measures in alabama and mississippi for non-constitutional purposes .
key points of a law in texas that covers most of the remaining clinics to close were covered by a federal judge on friday .
advocates of abortion and the american college of ostretricians and gynecologists , as well as the american medical association , agree that authorising rights of doctors are unnecessary .
opponents of abortion are opposed to the measures being used to protect women &apos;s health , although some also consider the effects of closing down clinics .
only a doctor who has been carrying out abortions in louisiana has the right to introduce patients , shared the centre for reproductive rights .
if all other doctors in the state are forced to stop carrying out abortions , this doctor would , for fear of his safety , no longer carry out the operation , the group said .
in its arguments against the judgment , representatives of the state of louisiana said that they had not arrested doctors for carrying out abortions , while their applications for patient applications were not yet accepted .
delayed diagnosis and lack of access to the best treatment methods lead to higher death rates from egg cancers in rural areas .
angelina jolie and her brother james have a video homage for their mother online , which was sold to egg stockpiles in 2007 .
for women in australia ’ s rural areas , there is a greater risk of dying of egg cancers than for women in cities .
researchers analyzed the medical data of more than 1100 australians who had detected egg stockpiles in 2005 , and found that only 25 % had been diagnosed five years ago .
the research director susan jordan of the qimr berghofer medical research institute said that for those who live in rural and remote regions of the state , the mortality risk during the study was 20 % higher .
small study : new medicines could be lung and egg throat cancer , and could slow down lung and egg stockpiles .
researchers investigated women &apos;s medical care for seven years .
dr jordan said that the age of a woman in diagnosis , the type of egg throat cancer , previous diseases and social and economic status also increase the chances of survival .
for older women and those whose cancer has continued to be advanced at the time of diagnosis , the survival rate was lowest .
for those who live in rural and remote areas of the state , mortality risk was higher during the study by 20 % than for those in urban areas .
although the study did not investigate why women living outside the city are more likely to suffer from egg cancers , dr. jordan suspects a late diagnosis and lack of access to the best treatment centers .
&quot; this disease is best treated by gynaecological oncologists , and these are mostly found in larger cities , &quot; she said .
despite the improvement in telemedical services to counter distances , it proposed as a possible remedy to strengthen the service of intercepted doctors to provide specialists with the opportunity to diet women more closely in their homes .
dr jordan said that the study , regardless of geographical status , had a poor long-term survival rate for women in egg cancers , and underlined the need for better treatment and prevention strategies .
the results of rio tinto ride to conquer cancer are now published in the medical journal of australia .
in march 2013 , elisha neave , a young mother of 33 years from the gold coast , learned that she had developed an aggressive form of egg-stockpile cancer .
garden centres regret declining house ownership
the decline , together with an increase in the number of homeowners under 35 , could lead to garden centres losing tens of thousands of pounds a year when today ’ s young consumers , as in the financial sector , are reported to have done .
the report states that tenants spend an average of 55 percent of the amount that people have to spend on their gardens with their own homes .
the rise in people living in highly urbanised areas without gardens , the popular procedure of park-using subterranean gardens , and the declining garden size are further factors that make the industry vulnerable .
in the greater london area , where over a period of 6 years the share of homeowners has fallen from 61 % to 43 % , the lowest expenditure on garden products per household is reported .
the hta and the royal horticultural society point out that housing is not available for rent or small gardens means that people do not have to draw plants .
guy barter , chief garden adviser for the ras said : &quot; container gardeners are very popular among tenants , for example , because they can take their plants with them when they move . &quot;
the hta report identified the period between 1997 and 2005 as the &quot; golden age &quot; of the retail garden market due to rising homeowners and economic prosperity from the late 1980s to the mid-1990s .
he also predicted improved market conditions for this year , due to the better weather conditions following unfriendly weather conditions in march and april last year .
the political and economic reforms initiated by opposition politician imran khan and the spiritual tahirul qadri in pakistan are continuing .
around 1000 demonstrators have taken over the state television channel ptv in the capital islamabad .
information minister pervaiz rashid said that soldiers had taken the protesters back out of ptv .
the station set up its operation for about 40 minutes , but is now sending back .
at the same time , around 3000 demonstrators tried to become prime minister nawaz sharif ’ s residence .
about a kilometre away , they were equipped with sticks and stones to clash with security forces .
the police used tear gas .
the protesters demanded sharif ’ s resignation , but he refused .
the country &apos;s army is meanwhile urging a political solution to the conflict , &apos; without wasting time and using force &apos; .
after a meeting in the headquarters on sunday evening , the military said : &apos; the army remains committed to its role in ensuring the security of the state &apos; .
the military plays an important role in pakistan and has already done so more frequently .
opposition politician imran khan raises premier sharif , who has won the may parliamentary election last year , and who has been shocked by the government ’ s actions .
the protests escalated over the weekend after khan and qadri had called their supporters to return to sharif ’ s residence .
three people had been killed .
turkey orders us diplomat for spying report
the turkish foreign ministry has sent a message to the country ’ s longest-serving us diplomat about a report on american and british espionage in turkey .
vice-president bülent said that the us embassy and turkish official ’ s executive discussed the report on monday .
the german magazine der spiegel and the online magazine the intercept reported that the data collected by the former us analyst of the national security agency , edward snowden , show that turkey is a major activity for the us .
according to turkish news agencies , turkish president recep tayyip erdogan played the role of herdogan in the report and said that all the major countries should play mutually .
an earlier report that germany ’ s main intelligence service also targeted ankara made it clear that it was reacting more sharply .
warning strike : train drivers are threatening to have consequences for commuters .
the national alert strike of train drivers on monday evening could also make the movement of people in nrw less likely .
the announcement of a booth at 6 to 9 o &apos;clock will affect all transport companies throughout germany , including long-distance , regional and s-bahn transport ,
the main thrust of the warning strike is freight transport .

said the district leader of the trade union of german locomotives ( gdl ) , sven schmitte , in düsseldorf .
we expect significant losses .
regional priorities do not exist .
the main thrust of the warning strike is freight transport .
the deutsche bahn in nrw announced that it would do everything possible to minimise the impact .
the gdl did not say where it wanted to strike , so it is difficult to predict the consequences in concrete terms .
magaluf police chief accused of corruption
on friday , the prosecutors submitted a report to the office of the mallorca public prosecutor to prove that police and officials were blackmail .
the head of the calvià police on the mallorca holiday island was arrested for corruption by businessmen and barketeers in the infamous binge-drinking-hotspot magaluf .
chief commissioner josé antonio navarro was arrested after accusations of corruption against him by several businessmen from punta ballena , the street where most of magaluf &apos;s bars and nightclubs are located .
according to the online daily mallorca diario , the prosecutors submitted a report to the prosecutor &apos;s office for the fight against corruption in mallorca on friday to prove police blackmail and city officials .
two other local police officers were arrested by the spanish guardia civil in connection with the corruption charges .
the spanish national daily abc reported that the angry nightclub owners were saying that the vetternity of the authorities had serious implications for their business .
&quot; it is no longer a matter of money-making , it is a matter of survival , &quot; said one of the businessmen to the court .
let our livelihood be lost .
we have nothing to lose .
this summer , magaluf made a huge effort to make international headlines , owing to a viral youtube video , in which an 18-year-old british tourist was shown who died on 24 men during a flood fellatio .
the island authorities have since tried to stop the improper behaviour of alcoholic holidaymakers in magaluf by reducing the number of participants in the notorious alcoholic beverages .
the playhouse club , where the fellatio incident took place , was forced to close for one year , while playhouse and the kneipentour-organizer carnage jointly accepted a penalty of 55,000 € .
magaluf is a tourist resort that is popular with young british holidaymakers and is also known for numerous accidents involving alcohol , including those involving trapping .
the first spring day with wet and stormy weather conditions affects flights from adelaide airport .
the spring has left southern australia a winter surprise , with fierce showers and strong winds that have been flying from adelaide airport .
in the evening until 9 pm , another 5mm of rain fell on the city , after 6.6mm , which had already fallen to sunday at night .
the last rainfall was the result of a series of short , stormy showers , including a cast that began just before 8 p.m. and was ready for almost 4mm rainfall in about 10 minutes .
after the winter was ready for early spring last week , the average temperature fell by about 10 degrees celsius on monday .
the bad weather has probably caused the delayed landing of a flight from virgin airlines from melbourne to adelaide .
the plane would have landed shortly after 7.30 p.m. , but was hit by a wind of outbursts - a sudden change in wind speed or direction over a short distance - and had to start .
at that time , wind blows reached about 50 km / h on the ground at adelaide airport .
the flight data showed that the aircraft could also be started on a second flight and eventually extended to around 20.40 .
the flight delay subsequently resulted in some other flights being delayed , including an emirates flight from dubai and a quantas flight from sydney .
for adelaide , a maximum temperature of 16 ° c is predicted on tuesday , with possible showers .
matthies says : it is high time to become a great networking point for the future .
given the galloping technical progress that has been made in high-tech areas by our cozy home , the company is now in a state of comfort .
as i write this here , my view of the spiral cable that connects the listener to the phone , and i think : boah , how retro is that ?
but there is a thought behind this : if the cable was not , all listeners would be able to fly around in the house in the shortest possible time , and that would be much more retro .
in any case , the echeltronic ( eckeltronic ?
no , typos : electronic ) sector the rule that today &apos;s world novelty is the electroscrap of tomorrow , bought - outdated .
and if you still have a tube tv in the living room today , for example , you simply say that you are opposed to television in principle .
why these considerations ?
because the ifa &apos;s outing at the radio tower this week again gives us our absolute incompetence in electronics matters .
the laie , who used to be a washing machine and cd player blindly dominated , does not even understand the purpose of the devices that were used with unbelievably loud and unbelievable experts in front of him : &quot; connect home &quot; .
yes , is it still possible ?
what are we to talk about with people who seem to be voluntarily spreading such quark ?
in fact , for some 20 years now , the main issue has been the fact that we should be networking our house with the utmost satisfaction .
to help the yoghurt to get the fire detector to us during the holiday in the maldives , we have to tell that it is burning in the working room .
and would it not be wonderful if we were to have air conditioning from the office on our early arrival ... ?
yes , however , it requires air conditioning .
but a dream will certainly come true soon : we lift our watch , say you &apos;re &quot; sucking ! &quot; - and at home , the vacuum grower drives away .
wrong .
everything amounts to nothing less than a revolution : &apos; the borders between white and brown goods blurred &apos; , raunt an industry expert , you can see the washing machine with a headphone .
we also know from everyday practice that if a new and modern device is really needed urgently , the battery is guaranteed to be empty .
another reason is that the spiral cable on the phone also survives the next radio exhibitions .
israeli children are returning to their schools after the war in gaza .
thousands of israeli children from the territories near gaza , who returned to israel on monday , were killed by the israeli army in air traffic control rooms .
the start of school brought the war , marked by rocket infusions in southern israel , a sense of joy and expectation , but the signs of fighting are still fresh .
in the southern city of ashdod , the assistant of the &quot; pashosh &quot; nursery , who was hit by a rocket , before the pupil arrived at shatsplitters of granate from the walls and admire .
&quot; we are a little afraid , but are excited , &quot; said ronit bart , resident in kibbutz saad and english teacher there .
many children from our area urgently need a return to routine .
her 11-year-old daughter shani bart said it feels &quot; a bit funny &quot; , suddenly back in the school .
&quot; these were difficult times , and we did not leave the house at all , &quot; she said .
president reuven rivlin visited kibbutz near the gaza border to offer his support .
until a ceasefire broke out last week , thousands of inhabitants of border communities like saad stayed in their homes or left their homes to live in safer areas further away from gaza and join the missile .
many nahal oz residents , a municipality near the gaza border , who have a four-year-old boy killed by a palestinian bomb , have been forced to hesitate to contact the government .
the ministry of education announced that about a dozen families have not yet returned .
their children have been placed in other schools for the time being .
prime minister binyamin netanyahu visited a school in sderot , a border town with gaza that is badly hit by the palestinian fire .
he called on the children to learn a lot and said &quot; we will ensure that their knowledge is acquired and provide you with security &quot; .
israel and hamas agreed on an open-ended peace agreement last tuesday .
the ceasefire brought about an immediate end to fighting ; however , important problems remain unresolved , as hamas ’ s demand for the lifting of the israeli-egyptian blockade of gaza and the reopening of air and sea ports .
israel is calling for hamas to be disarmed and for the bodies to be handed over from two israeli soldiers killed in the fighting .
a new round of indirect talks is expected to begin in egypt this month .
in the war , more than 2,100 palestinians were killed , three quarters of them civilians , and at least 494 children were estimated to have been killed by palestinians and the un .
israel denies these claims and estimates that at least half of the killed are fighters , but never submitted any concrete evidence of these information .
on the israeli side , 66 soldiers and six civilians , including a thai worker , have been killed .
hamas and other gaza fighters fired 4,591 rockets and mortar shells during the fighting on israeli cities , most of which were in the south of the country .
meanwhile , israel ’ s military has carried more than 5,000 air and other attacks .
israel ’ s attacks damaged or destroyed thousands of gaza ’ s homes , and about 250,000 people sought refuge in more than 100 un schools that had been built in temporary shelters .
while tens of thousands of people continue to live in the shelter and continue the fighting , last week the educational authorities postponed the start of the school year .
&quot; i hope the school is soon reopened so that we can continue learning , as the children in the world and the jewish children , &quot; said mohammad amara , a 13-year-old boy who is currently in gamara school .
at saxony &apos;s option , npd-verbally provides npd prohibition procedures .
given the loss of votes by the npd in saxony , cdu bundesvize thomas strobl has argued for an end to the ongoing npd prohibition proceedings before the federal constitutional court .
berlin - according to cdu bundesvize thomas strobl , the current prohibition proceedings against the npd should end in the federal constitutional court .
&quot; the npd is doing worse than last time , &quot; said strobl , who also served as the cdu country leader in baden-württemberg , the &quot; leipzig people &apos;s newspaper .
this is a welcome development in the right direction and a development that will allow me to conclude more that the npd is being fought politically and not in the constitutional court .
the npd was very close to the five-percent hurdle in the vote on sunday .
a first attempt to ban the extreme right party was a failure in 2003 , because constitutional protection was also a priority at the npd ’ s top .
in december 2013 , the federal council submitted a new application in karlsruhe after long preparation .
the federal government and the bundestag did not join .
harburg : tents for new refugees
refugees are now being placed in tents in the new area .
the initial central reception for refugees in harburg is bursting .
now the internal authority has three red cross tents in addition .
the district politicians were informed only shortly before - they are not very enthusiastic .
&quot; these hauruck actions continue to raise citizens &apos; reservations and do not give district politicians the opportunity to participate constructively in the humane accommodations of refugees , &quot; says britta herrmann , the group leader of the greens , for example .
your party demands that the district administration of harburg should now provide unused accommodation facilities .
96 refugees can be accommodated in the three tents .
the reasons for the overcrowding in the first shot are the rush of people seeking help - and the fact that the authorities have not provided sufficient places in follow-up facilities .
many refugees therefore remain longer than the regular three months .
house prices have increased by seven years , showing a widely observed increase in the winter .
the rp data corelogic hedonic home value index for home in australia ’ s capital increased by 1.1 percent in august , so rp data from monday .
this increase represents the overall increase in june , july and august at 4.2 percent , the biggest increase in the winter months since 2007 .
the annual price rise was 10.9 percent , more than twice the rise in the 12 months up to august 2013 , but the increases were not the same as the country .
the research director of rp data , tim lawless , announced that sydney and melbourne had a two-tier market .
rp data shows that house prices in sydney last year were down by 16.1 % , with melbourne rising by 11.7 % .
the following markets are adelaide , brisbane and darwin , where prices are reduced by an average of five and six percent .
at the other end of the scale is canberra , which has been hit hard by cuts in government spending , and where prices have risen by just 1.4 % over the year .
mr lawless also said that the beginning of spring is now expected to increase in the number of properties on sale over the coming months , which would &apos; put the market under a real test &apos; .
&quot; if we consider the continuing high price of the auction , a generally fast sales rate and the continuing low prices , we are not sure that the prices will be the same .
in an opinion to the new press , it contradicts statements by the executive director peer medau and acknowledges him that &quot; like a feldherr &quot; to position .
the university style is not that , it says in the communication .
the medal family had already been informed orally about the request from the university in mid-june .
the statement that the plans were only announced in july is definitely wrong , &quot; says pötzl .
at the same time , it points out that the plans are not &apos; predetermined or even decisions &apos; , but &apos; preferences &apos; .
the expansion of the narrow road to the castle which is necessary for the access to the castle is also less dramatic than the meda fears .
from a nine metre long road , there was no mention of it .
as things stand at present , it is 5.50 metres wider than before , &apos; explains pötzl .
the argument of the medaul operators that their free and educational parking areas will only be used in future by students of the university wants pötzl not to apply .
the hotel is not allowed at all because , like other public parking areas , it is now possible to solve this intelligently .
the people living near the border are thinking in terms of the people living in the countryside .
the children ’ s crib bergwichtel , located on the site , is open on the doorstep of the park deck , according to the president of the higher education , &apos; should not be affected &apos; .
rather , he gives to consider &quot; that this is not just a children &apos;s nativity , but also a local population at the entrance to the friedrich-streib-straße and the 800 students of the neighbouring realschule .
so it is much more than just a question of individual interests of mr medau , &quot; says pötzl .
whether the parents ’ criticism of the children ’ s crib , with the extension of the road , would be a “ one of the few natural spots in coburg ’ s lost ” is justified , “ the reader can decide for himself ” .
in early october , pötzl , together with the state building authority bamberg , intends to inform the city councils about the construction development of the university by 2020 &quot; and in this context address the importance of the new development &quot; .
peer medau last week had the parents of the crèche informed about the university &apos;s plans .
the new parking deck is not to be accessed via the campus and the friedrich-streib-straße , but via the medaul .
this would mean that the narrow road would have to be extended on a two-lane stretch of about one kilometre .
according to meda &apos;s accounts , traffic in the park of hohenfels castle would increase ten-fold .
about 2000 vehicles are mentioned daily .
the city has not yet wanted to comment on the project .
glandorf steers from handball national team .
holger glandorf will no longer play for the dhb team .
the 31-year-old from the bundesligist sg flensburg-handewitt was responsible for this decision , mainly for health problems .
i did not find it easy to make a decision , it has matured for several months .
it is time for me to listen to the signals of my body and to start my career in the national team , &quot; said the 2007 world champion at his facebook page .
it therefore has a record of 167 country games and 576 goals for germany in international retirement .
because the rock-and-roll backroom player for the champions league winner from flensburg will be on a torejagd for a few years to come , he is now on the new dagur signage .
with the icelanders who will be on tuesday his kader for the country games against switzerland , glandorf introduced a &quot; long and good conversation .
his ideas and approaches have enthralled me just as much as they have enthralled my long-time fellow players and my successors .
but for my club i want to be healthy for the next years , and for that reason longer regeneration periods are necessary , which do not allow the current double load .
in 2012 , the left handed had to leave after a heel infection with his career .
due to achilles spell problems , he had been hired by team doctors of the german handball federation ( dhb ) with a cortisone injection , which later eliminated a strong inflammation .
an emergency operation and two other interventions followed .
then glandorf had announced a complaint against the team doctor , the dispute ended with a comparison .
twelve years of professional and eleven years of national team career pass by no body without trace .
i have some health building sites that i can no longer ignore .
after the three infection-related foot operations , which took place in 2012 at short intervals , i never really got my blood pressure under control .
this includes some other wear and tear related complaints .
i noticed at the beginning of the year that i am steering my head , but i can &apos;t deceive my body , &quot; , glandorf explained in the interview the magazine &quot; handball time &quot; .
for a comeback , it would only be available in absolute emergency .
&quot; when all the rigs are tearing , i am always ready to talk , &quot; explained the double father to the magazine .
however , i can &apos;t wait for years when i can still play handball in one hand .
i must also say that after my long stay in hospital in 2012 , i also became quite humiliating in terms of my health .
after my career i want to at least go some way straight .
in addition to the 2007 world championship title and the winning of the champions league 2014 , he won the 2008 ( hsg nordhorn ) and 2010 ( tbv lemgo ) ehf cup .
in 2012 he also secured the european cup of the cup winner with flensburg .
german economy contracted by 0.2 % in spring .
the crises around the world have hit the german economy in the second quarter .
gross domestic product fell from april to the end of june 2014 , compared to the prior quarter , by 0.2 % .
this was shared by the federal statistical office and confirmed preliminary calculations .
consumption alone stimulated the economy in the spring , while investment declined .
foreign trade also slowed the economy .
thanks to the strong beginning of the year , a total gdp increase of 0.8 % over the second half of 2013 will be achieved for the first six months .
horstmar was the starting point and destination of the &quot; münsterland mooiste &quot; , which was first introduced on sunday through the city of burgmannsdorf .
the burgmannstadt horstmar experienced an invasion of dutch &quot; fietzenfahrter &quot; on sunday .
the largest cycling association in the netherlands , ntfu , organized the so-called &quot; münsterlande mooiste &quot; .
this is the largest cycling tour across the münsterland , the cycling paradise near the netherlands .
over 1000 participants thanked jos ter huerne for organizing this tour through the münsterland .
this tour was published in various trade magazines and was offered to interested people .
we are coming from the heroes and we went overnight to participate in this tour .
we would like to know the münsterland in this way too , &quot; , cyclists were delighted to take the route through the districts of steinfurt , borken and coesfeld .
after registering at the club of the protective brotherhood sta .
katharina went on a small &quot; peace ride &quot; through the city over the wall , where the start was also made .
the route , which has been advertised for three different categories , led towards herrenholz over the schöppinger berg in the direction of coesfeld and across havixbeck and billerbeck back to horstmar .
on routes of 95 kilometres with 1175 metres of altitude , 120 kilometres of 1475 metres of altitude and 145 kilometres of 1775 metres of altitude , cyclists have proved their good condition .
they were cared for on the way in havixbeck and billerbeck .
main organizer jos ter huerne and mayor deputy heinz lölfing showed themselves at the success of this cycling event .
we are satisfied and it was a great experience for all involved .
the organization was without problems and there were no negative incidents , &quot; heinz lölfing draws a positive conclusion to this event .
unfortunately , not as many participants as the organizer had hoped , which is probably due to the bad weather forecasts and the morning rain .
&quot; we will be back in 2015 in hopefully nice weather on august 30 or during another weekend , &quot; the cyclists promised to return to münsterland and the organizers plan to renew their tour .
konstantin weckers ruthlessly wills honest memoirs
it is actually more philosophical testimony than biography , which makes konstantin alarm , songwriter , pacifist , politico-safe activist , ex-prisoner , in &quot; monk and warrior 87 .
it is not chronological but rather more spiritual scraps for thought scraps that the author , born on 1 june 1947 , has defeated his memoirs , each chapter initiated by a suitable song text .
and he is ruthlessly honest : from the onanie as a gymnasist to the shoplifting and drug use he does not leave any human weakness .
also , to show how he himself tolerates in dealing with his fellow human beings .
the broad spectrum of abstract terms , but all the more important , is that love , soul , ego , being in the now spirituality - all of which he tries to get to the bottom , in a very personal , but also philosophical way .
and he also explains his pacifism , his social criticism , his political commitment - and also how he has not only shaped music ( the opera lover was named soul- and rock musician ) , but also his political commitment .
the latter has named the lebemann konstantin wecker as close to the ascetic monk , who &quot; emerges through subtraction &quot; as he says , &quot; leaving everything unnecessary &quot; .
there is also a short anecdote between all the highly spiritual views on earth : about beatings in a region frequented by gis or a mad cop ride , where the person is frontline .
he is also ruthless in his honesty .
lenny henry : my father never put me in the arm .
never said &quot; i love you !
henry was one of seven children of a family of jamaican immigrants in dudley in the midlands in 1958 .
his father , who died when henry 19 was working in a factory and her relationship was limited .
henry proves for a comedy , rudy &apos;s rare records , which are partly based on an imaginary conversation with his father and is released on radio 4 .
the soundtrack is a mixture of reggae and rap , with lively melodies .
but henry had to work through some difficult childhood moments .
he attended &quot; many &quot; therapies after the death of his mother , and henry is thinking about his relationship with his father .
it was difficult to know him .
you never saw his face , only heard his voice : &quot; listen to the crash .
let your sister be in peace .
get away !
i want to look at cricket .
my older brothers seymour and hilton - who were already grown when i was a child - went with him to the pub and talked about things like the shape of beer glass or the beauty of a cricket .
i never had such a conversation with him .
for a large part of my life he was this serious guy in the corner of the newspaper .
recently henry opened a foundry in dudley , and although conditions are better than those of his father , he won an insight into how the life for him was .
it is now a bit brighter , but they are dark , smoky , deep stylistic labyrinth with flame shocks and smoke and lots of soot .
my father used to sit in the tub and then one could hear him slowly , how he began to sing , because he was the foundry of himself .
when i went around there , i realized that he had done so for years to prepare the meal on the table , and i respect him .
however , henry grew up as a child without the testimony of his parents &apos; love .
my father never hugged me , he never said &quot; i love you &quot; .
only when my mother was ill at the end of her life did we begin to &quot; i love you , i love you , i love you &quot; to say .
through his own daughter billige , with dawn french , he could share the love he lacks as a child .
could you have a look at the &quot; i love you &quot; ?
stop hugging me !
dad , i am 22 !
with dawn french .
why should we not be friends ?
she is a great mother .
it is still a friend of french , with whom he married for 25 years .
dawn is a good man .
why should we not be friends ?
she is a great mother .
henry &apos;s own mother was a diabetic .
this contributed to their death .
so when i got very , very overweight and had symptoms of diabetes , my doctor said &quot; you must be radical .
so i pulled through this fitness and had to make a drastic diet to reverse the symptoms .
it is very difficult .
and it is exhausting .
no one likes eating carrots .
henry &apos;s career change may be reflected in his elegant , short-cut beard .
since he was nominated by critics for his othello , he has been captured by the theatre .
the comedy of the mistakes followed , and then fences of august wilson .
this is a different experience than the sitcoms and comedias who have completed their busy working life .
he began with only 16 years when he worked in a factory .
a dj discovered him on stage when he imitated and wrote to new faces about him .
his television career began in the mid-1970s . &quot; i was the only black icons for a fairly long time in television . &quot;
he learned at work .
i had to be large not only in the eyes of the public , but also from 1975 to 1985 learn how to become an efficient joke narrative machine , while i was a star through television , and that was really difficult .
lenny 1975 at new faces
as his manager had the right to stage at the black and white minstrel show , a light entertainment program , where he was able to &quot; black &quot; .
the hotel is very clean and the staff are very friendly .
i somehow wish it had never happened , but i do not regret that i did .
the hotel is very clean and the staff are very friendly .
but this &quot; year long award-winning light pillar of british television &quot; was also a &quot; grotesque parody of black people . &quot;
the introduction of figures representing british black culture both mocked and celebrated worked for henry in the eighties .
the first series of the lenny henry show was broadcast in 1984 , and in the 1990s he was among other things as the chef gareth blacklock in the comedy series chef !
advertising , documentary films , tv series and film roles have been a feature of his next decade , but after his bbc series lennyhenry.tv 2008 he thought : &quot; what are you doing next , because you are doing ?
after that came a documentary series for radio 4 entitled what &apos;s so great about ... ?
the first episode was about shakespeare .
i was quite allergic to shakespeare .
i never really learned anything about him at school and thought him to be a domain of the middle class , white in tights , and a comb .
so i was very afraid of it .
all of us who interviewed for the show , peter hall , trevor nunn , adrian lester , judi dench said &quot; you should try it .
do not do it bad if you don &apos;t know what you are talking about .
take a few words in your mouth , and then you will understand why we all use shakespeare so love .
henry introduced 20 lines from othellos last speech for the documentary and he was thrilled .
i felt that i could achieve this .
it was almost as if someone had put my head on to me .
&quot; that is what it is about , it is a serious matter , take it seriously , learn your text , search a bit .
the samples were brutal , and i read this piece for months before we did it .
and it was a success .
they seemed to expect a car accident , and that simply did not happen .
and soon he appeared in the comedy of the fallacies .
suddenly i was in the national theatre and i could hardly believe it .
there was a moment when i thought , &quot; oh , you changed you . &quot;
there was a technical error and henry felt instinctive that he had to entertain the audience .
&quot; a little voice told me &quot; you have to bridge 10 minutes now while you repair the computer . &quot;
instead , the stage leader announced that the idea would continue as soon as the problem was resolved .
i went from stage and anything in me said &quot; oh , thank god , &quot; .
i am not responsible for that .
i can leave that to someone else .
&quot; you play in a play , so stay in your role . &quot;
henry in fences at the duchess theatre
learning the text for fences was challenging .
panic is very good , it strengthens longing .
that was also a good thing , so it is like a great shield of the gods who tell me &quot; this is your destiny &quot; .
he says so , of course , with a thundering voice .
so i will stick to that .
i really love that .
i love to be in a sample room .
henry still has the head of a comedian - our conversation has been accompanied by humorous outbreaks , while he imitates people time and again .
i have decided not to make a stand-up comedy because i think this type of immediate satisfaction of one room full of strangers is somehow dangerous .
if you always look for it , you drive to a wall .
i sometimes appear live in apollo , if i feel like it , but overall i don &apos;t have as much as i used to .
i ask him whether he will ever again be on a stand-up comedy tour .
the fun i had in a room with a director that helps to make a start , a middle part and the end of a journey - i do not think i ever need to give up .
is this his new incarnation ?
i think so .
i am a very fond of acting .
it is fun .
you always tell a story , and that is great .
i love stories .
people love stories .
huthi rebels are blocking streets in yemen ’ s capital city
in the conflict between shiite huthi rebels and the yemeni government , huthis have led to civil disobedience in the capital , sanaa .
huthi supporters would have been occupying central roads in sanaa on monday , said a speaker of the huthi party , &quot; ansar allah &quot; .
access to parliament has also been blocked .
yemeni media report a traffic chaos in the capital .
according to the online edition of the newspaper &quot; yemen post &quot; , huthi leader abdulmalik al-huthi had called on the measures on sunday evening .
according to the magazine huthi threatened to escalate the conflict further if his demands were not met .
shia huthis are fighting for greater independence from sunni ruled yemen , and are demanding the resignation of the government .
the huthi people &apos;s tribe has been besieging the yemeni capital for almost two weeks .
around 30,000 rebels have protest camps on the large access routes of sanaa .
the surrounding area is constantly struggling with the yemeni army .
kenya registers officials to recruit &quot; ghost &quot; staff .
kenya has begun to biometrically register all state officials to become &quot; ghost &quot; employees from the payroll of the government .
staff who are not registered in the next two weeks would not pay any more was a government communication .
the government suspects that thousands of people will be able to remain paid salaries even after they leave the public service .
president uhuru kenyatta promised , when he took office in 2013 , to fight corruption in the public service .
at a review earlier this year , it was found that at least $ 1 million ( £ 700,000 ) per month in payments for &quot; ghost &quot; employees and other abusive financial practices were lost .
the government suspects that salaries will continue to be paid on accounts after a person has died or has left the public service , reports wanyama chebusiri for the bbc in nairobi , the capital .
all officials will now have to appear at identification centres in the next two weeks to ensure that their data on biometric registration is included , was notified in a government message .
all those who did not do so without a credible apology would be removed from the salary list , continued to be the communication .
&quot; this approach will make a significant contribution to rationalising public service by identifying the actual number of officials and also by improving the salary list at both levels of government - the ghost workers will be eliminated .
the scandal surrounding the art adviser helge achenbach will be discussed in court for the first time on 11 november .
five heirs of berthold albrecht , son of the aldi founder theo albrecht , claim in a civil trial at the düsseldorf district court 19.4 million euros compensation from achendie and two companies .
a court spokesperson said this on monday .
the complaint states that achenbach did not have any rights when buying works of art and vintage cars and that berthold albrecht paid higher than the actual purchase prices .
this would also mean that the commission agreed was higher .
achenbach has valued valuables for albrecht for eur 121 million .
children need roots and wings
he was in school service for 44 years , 23 of them as head of school .
manfred richter knows many of the petershausener and kollbacher who had been in the past as pupils .
his methods were sometimes unconventional , but always inspired by his desire to see the human being in the pupil .
the snowkoppe is the most famous mountain of the giant mountains .
manfred richter loves the painting with the motif from his home .
judge was born in 1930 in trautenau / north bohemia , today trutnov .
after four years of secondary school he was already interested in the profession of teachers with 14 .
one year later , the sudeten germans were expropriated .
within half an hour the family had to leave .
after a few months in one camp , in 1946 , he went to bavaria - the freight car .
thus , judges fell into the upper franconian senkendorf .
the teacher training took place in bamberg .
manfred richter had to travel ten kilometres to the nearest train station six times a week , travel by train to bamberg , and go through school three kilometres across the city and return to school in the evening .
after two months , manfred richter got a red cross home in bamberg with a sleeping opportunity : together with up to 15 students in a dormitory .
in 1951 he made the first and in 1954 after three years of teaching candidate the second state examen .
he was a member of the german society for the study of the german language and the german language institute ( bmbf ) .
the &quot; miss room &quot; was his first &quot; service apartment &quot; in the school .
in 1958 , he joined the school in a newly built teacher &apos;s house next to the school .
this house bought manfred richter in 1980 , after the school had been dissolved in kollbach in 1968 .
until then , there were no more than 100 students in kollbach at the petershausen-kollbach school association and five in petershausen .
from the school year 1968 / 69 , these were published in petershausen in the town hall today .
when the school association indersdorf was founded , only primary school remained in the town .
in order to avoid a downgrading in the now smaller school , the then rector georg sigl moved to karlsfeld - and manfred richter became his successor .
but petershausen grew , and so the children and their teachers could obtain the present building from september 1982 , which was extended in 1997 after judge &apos;s retirement .
manfred richter praises the uncomplicated generosity of the then mayor ludwig götz , who also had a workshop at community cost and built cellar spaces during the 1997 enlargement , although this was not permitted by guidelines .
&quot; mayor götz was very school-friendly , &quot; judges remembered .
manfred richter never gave a government representative &apos;s speech in his career , which was based on a lecture from a school council on justice and justice : &apos; you can never forget love &apos; .
&quot; we have to give children two things : roots and wings , &quot; says the 84-year-old .
and he had to learn : &quot; this is not always successful &quot; .
in any case , judges do sometimes was unconventional .
when students beaten , they did not receive criminal proceedings and were not allowed to sit down .
at the expense of the community judge had created two pair of boxing gloves and let the two counterparties compete against each other , even though there should be a veil .
for the good of the school , judges as rector had a good relationship with the then mayor ludwig götz ( csu ) .
he moved the partisan judge after his retirement to be at least the last on the csu list for the local council in 1996 .
but judges were chosen in sixth place and joined the csu .
180 km , three days ’ 180 km
hr4-radtour 700 bikers set out in the bad salzhausen spa park and scots stopovers a good start to the day .
if cyclists are on their tour in bad salzhausen or scotland , that is nothing special in itself .
on friday , however , the number of resting impressions made : the 700 participants of the hr4 cycling tour and the accompanying trot enjoyed a break in the lower spa park of bad salzhausen and later a party under the sky in scotland .
the motto &quot; cycling and celebrating on newly discovered paths between nidda and kinzig &quot; was that the participants met in bad vilbel on thursday and had a concert by van baker &amp; band there .
on friday it was serious : the cyclists took the first stage , 60 kilometres over florstadt to bad salzhausen and further to scots .
in bad salzhausen , the sportsmen were invited by mayor hans-peter seum , who was also involved in bad vilbel by bicycle , and the manager of the own factory bad salzhausen , petra schwingen .
to refresh body and mind , all kinds of good things had been prepared : the rural women from ranstadt and nieder-mockstadt had 85 sheets of apple , twigs , scatter cheese and cheese .
&quot; such cakes can only bake rural women , &quot; praised an aullendiebach participant while ordering another piece .
at the sport club &apos;s beverage stand , the scour-nidda was able to get cold refreshments .
the &quot; duo bravo &quot; entertained the visitors with famous melodies from operettas and musicals and harvested enthusiastic applause .
the park &apos;s beautiful surroundings were relaxing .
a lord also enjoyed a head massage from his partner : &quot; he deserves that , after all , he has already skipped bicycle chains today reinforced &quot; .
meanwhile , the mayor and the manager of the company had to work : they were at the fountain in front of reporter rainer janke &apos;s drinking cureboard and took the opportunity to listen on the radio for bad salzhausen .
also , the head of the promotion tobias hagen , since the first hr4 bike tour in 2004 , could only be short , but he had plenty of experience with the local technology .
his pickup truck , in which he was able to capture the sound of the music with three telephones and a radio unit with his staff and the 15-person motorcycle relay of the police hessen , was able .
&quot; the majority of participants are from the rhine-main region , &quot; he said , &quot; but also from gießen or fulda , from lauterbach or the taunus and even from numerous cities in westphalia .
the number of participants is a little determined by the available accommodation capacity .
in category i , participants are accommodated in hotels , in category ii in collective accommodation .
the cyclists had a good impression of the spa when they left after a hour and a half : &quot; tschüss ! &quot;
&quot; it was nice in bad salzhausen ! &quot; they waved to farewell .
after arriving in scotland , the group was allowed to take a short break .
but in the evening the cyclists were asked to ride in the idyllic alteburgpark .
under the direction of the schottener gesellschaft für tourismus und stadtmarketing ( gts ) , the park had received a beautiful celebration and of course had been served delicacies , such as flame-cakes with a well cooled , with a well as a well-cooled feather white feather springs .
mayor susanne schaab , gts managing director markus hoßfeld and msc-chairman wolfgang wagner-sachs in his role as a member of the board of directors of adac hessen-thuringia .
the three showed themselves to be pleased with the &quot; many operations in scotland &quot; .
dj tobias hagen then released the dance stage .
the opportunity to move in the open air was not missed despite the athletic activities on the bike .
the guests were increasingly compassionate with citizens who were as impressed by the good mood as the great number of cyclists .
on the second day , the cyclists were able to use the birstein , wachersbach and bad orb stations - including a concert with the trendy forests - on the programme .
yesterday , after 180 kilometres of cycling , the athletes met again in bad vilbel .
dozens of turkish police for &quot; conspiracy &quot; against the government arrested and detained .
a total of 33 police officers were arrested in turkey for suspicion of &quot; conspiracy against the government &quot; , reporting local media agencies .
the police authorities did not make an immediate comment .
among the arrests are 14 senior policemen , reported hurriyet daily news .
some of them were involved in the corruption investigations against government officials , including four government ministers last december .
in july , a number of turkish police officers were arrested for supposedly setting up an organised criminal association and tapping phone numbers .
turkish president recep tayyip erdogan ( who was then prime minister ) described her actions as part of the activities that the islamist spiritual fethulla güllen had against him and other people in power against him .
not all children in ukraine are returning to school
schools almost everywhere in ukraine opened on monday ( september 1 ) after the summer holidays .
this day is traditionally an important day for families , and , like thousands of other ukrainian parents , prime minister arsenij jazenjuk brought his daughter to school .
there he told waiting journalists that not all schools had reopened , but he was determined to open the country for future generations :
the september celebrations were not held in every school .
heaven is not peaceful across ukraine .
we must fight for a peaceful sky .
the whole of ukraine , a huge common ukrainian people &apos;s front , must fight for a peaceful sky .
aleksan pastukhow , head of school in slawjansk , the jazenjuk daughter visited , spoke in russian .
we hope that peace will finally reign here and that children will be given education that will be useful to them in their lives .
the first day of the new school year is traditionally celebrated , with children embroidered shirts , balloons in their hands and giving their teachers flowers .
with rona fairhead , the bbc may have found the great director it needs .
she meets with a proud glory from the banking world , media management and the inner circle of the tory party .
and it has its own frontal experience .
her career began with bain and co , a global management consulting firm , which she was looking for at morgan stanley , bombadier , ici and pearsons ’ media world .
she was the executive director of the financial times for seven years and resigned when the parent company pearson was transferred to a younger male member .
their compensation was supposed to be nearly £ 1 million .
your political rankings are also solid .
she was murdered by lord browne , former bp chairman david cameron , when he was seeking more private economic knowledge in whitehall : she was sent to the cabin council .
her husband is a former tory council member .
as early as may , i described the chair &apos;s task with a poisoned cup .
not only is the bbc a vast and complex entity at the heart of public life , but there is also an internal paradox in its structure .
trust works in two directions : inward to the first guard of its own management hierarchy in the bbc , but also externally as a voice of public concern and disquiet when things go wrong .
this provides for an almost unsustainable duopoly , which demands a complete comprehensive reform .
but which new incoming chair would risk taking on , going on and setting up an institution that is so complex as a chinese dynasty , while he is not self-sufficient ?
it is a difficult task .
and as if that were not enough , many people are also interested in reducing the bbc - power , money , and status .
as competition moves closer and new technologies allow old , comfortable collateral to be threatened , the forthcoming negotiation of licence fees for the bbc is entailed with particular risks .
for the modest sum of £ 145.50 per year , the british public is buying into what is probably the world &apos;s largest media company .
the bbc tells a good story : it says that it reaches 96 % of all households , and each of them costs only 40 pence a day .
and the bbc seems to be rising on the popularity scale again : 53 % support them today , compared to 31 % before 10 years ago .
the visual and usage habits of the bbc have changed : i get news headlines today on my mobile phone and see packed news .
but it remains a very dear and notable institution .
it needs a considerable chairman - i hope she has found him .
perry from texas says that lowering tweet was not authorized .
a tweet from the official account of the republican governor of texas , rick perry , on sunday included a downfall comment about the democratic district state prosecutor , who was at the center of a criminal prosecution .
the tweet was later deleted and replaced by another perry account that revoked the previous step .
just is a tweet sent from my account , which is not authorized by me .
&quot; i don &apos;t approve the tweet and have deleted it , &quot; it was said in the later news .
perry staff did not respond immediately to requests for comments .
although perry &apos;s official user account was created , the tweets were not clear who was actually running the feed .
in the former tweet , an unfavourable image of the district prosecutor of travis county , rosemary lehmberg , was drawn , which was declared a &quot; national treasure &quot; in april 2013 .
perry vetoed financial support for her office when she refused to go back , which led to an accusation against perry - who may have been president in 2016 .
the tweets text reads : &quot; i am not always drunk with the triple alcohol level ... but if i do , i can complain good-natured .
i am the drunk democrat in texas .
lehmberg &apos;s office was not responsible for the investigation of the grand jury against perry .
this was done by michael mccrum , a special prosecutor from san antonio , who was chosen by a republican judge .
perry pleads for not guilty and called the charge a political trick .
his highly-class team of legal advisors applied for a legal remedy for the judge charged with the case , arguing that the law that violates the service provider is not valid .
perry stopped $ 7.5 million of government funds from the public integrity unit of the state - which was set up in travis county .
this veto has caused a public complaint from a left-wing watchdog group .
perry &apos;s official account is updated frequently - and sometimes famous .
after having been elected to the iowa electoral assembly during his presidential candidacy in 2012 , perry went on to speculate that the country would stop .
berkeley once again declares the housing market &quot; normal &quot; .
one of the most prominent construction contractors in london pointed out that the housing market in the south-east of england has returned to normal levels .
home in the capital was hotly sought and the subject of huge price rises , which the bank of england has been unable to accept because of widespread fear of a credit bubble .
tony pidgley , founder and ceo of the high-class construction company berkeley said on monday : &quot; since the beginning of the current financial year , the market has returned to normal transaction levels since the peak of 2013 .
the london housing market was well positioned during the downturn , as foreign buyers pushed to the capital .
according to the register office , prices in the city area alone have jumped by 18.5 % last year , far more than the average increase in england and wales in general .
the average sales prices at berkeley &apos;s private , cheap and student offers rose by about one-fifth last year , reaching a year-end of 423,000 pounds .
a stronger pound , however , has in recent months made property in london less attractive to foreign buyers - some of them are also affected by the introduction of new property taxes and political rhetoric about a possible &quot; villentax &quot; in may .
london ’ s real estate agent foxtons warned last week that the mortgage market report for april , in which sharper mortgage credit markets were subject to a review , was not adopted in the second half of the year .
new data from the bank of england on monday show a decline in mortgage authorization in july , which also indicates that the housing market is cooling .
hamptions international , another real estate agency , corrected his forecast for the rise in london property prices for 2015 down to 3 % , based on an already weakening housing price .
the volume of transactions in london ’ s most expensive areas , such as chelsea , mayfair , and kensington , has now fallen by a quarter each year , according to the broker wa ellis .
yet the desire for a home in the capital is a blessing for berkeley , because the amounts due are not enough for futures sales to exceed £ 2.2 billion .
mr pidgley added : &apos; the demand for the right , well-planned product at the best sites remained stable and as a result the shortages of futures have remained stable . &apos;
in june , the company reported that there were 3,742 new homes in the year until the end of april - almost a third more than the pre-crisis peak in 2007 .
the annual pre-tax result rose by 40 percent to £ 280 million , and sales increased by 18 percent to £ 1.6 billion .
in a communication on monday before the annual general meeting of the company , mr pidgley said that revenue for berkeley is expected to be in line with current market expectations this year .
analysts agree that the annual pre-tax result is 450 million £ .
berkeley stocks were in the afternoon at 23.96 £ in london trading .
nude photos from jennifer lawrence published by hackers on the internet by hackers .
jennifer lawrence performance at the 85th oscar-award .
nude photos of the oscar prize winner jennifer lawrence were shot online by a hacker who claimed to have a &quot; master list &quot; of images of another 100 starlets .
a representative of the star from &quot; the tribute of panem &quot; confirmed that the photos of lawrence really are real and complained to the hacker for &quot; blatant violation of privacy &quot; .
the authorities have been notified and will follow all those who have taken the stolen photos of jennifer lawrence .
the photos originally published on the photo sharing page 4chan were allegedly replaced by a gap in the online storage system icloud by apple procurement .
it is not sure how many of the images are real , although winstead , star from &quot; scott pilgrim against the rest of the world &quot; on twitter also condemned the hack .
&quot; to those of you who look at photos that my husband and i took in the private environment of our house years ago - i hope you are really satisfied with you , &quot; winstead wrote on twitter .
victoria justice from the nickodeon series &quot; icarly &quot; and &quot; victorious &quot; , however , stopped by saying that the photos were pictures of her .
let us not go for the beginning . * wortspiel intended * .
buzzfeed reported on late sunday that a spokesman of pop star ariana grande had confirmed the authenticity of the alleged photos of her .
exclusive extract from howard jacobson &apos;s highly praised new novel about love and the letter &quot; j &quot; .
they were crushed , so the best way to describe them was to slowly dissolve like a carton that was in the rain .
occasionally , a woman told him that he was too serious , exhausting , intense , distanced , and perhaps rather scratchbrushing .
and then shaken his hand .
he knew scratch brush .
he was stacked , as in igel , yes .
the last victim of this stupidity was a recent affair that was more promising for alleviating the lonely boredom of his life than usual , and perhaps even a certain satisfaction for him .
ailin solomon was a trembling tender beauty with untamed hair and a flattering heart from a village on the north island , which was even more remote and rough than port report .
it had come with an older companion to the south , which kevern held for her aunt , and which had a plot in a wet but paradise valley with the appropriate name paradise valley .
for several years , no one had lived in the house .
the tubes were leak , in the bathrooms were still spiders , nude cups had their traces left on all windows and believed they belonged to all of this , and the garden was with weeds .
it was like the house from a children &apos;s fairy tale , both threatening and attractive , a garden full of secrets .
portrait of the author : howard jacobson , whose novel &quot; j &quot; on the longlist for the man booker prize 2014 .
the shortlist will be published next week .
kessen had been in charge of the broken song stalls in the high grass with ailin and had an unusually warm spring afternoon .
your feet are too big .
because of their own aggressiveness , songs of this kind were no longer played on the console .
not forbidden - nothing was really forbidden - just not played .
it has been successfully obsolete , as has the word obsolete .
the general taste created what decree and regulation would never have achieved , and how people in books could have used the vom tellrecitory-zum millionaires , cookbooks and love novels .
in the euphoria of the day , kevern began playing an imaginary piano and playing in a grob-comic serenade of ailinns great feet .
ailin did not understand that .
&quot; this was a well-known song by a jazz pianist called fats waller , &quot; he explained her and placed two fingers on his lips automatically .
his father had always done this to stop letter j before he left his mouth .
it had started as a game between him and his father when he was still small .
his father had played it with his own father , so he had told .
if you start a word with an j without having to put two fingers over your lips , it costs you a penny .
it was not a very funny game back then , and it was not very funny now either .
he knew that he was expected to do so , that was all .
it had to explain what jazz was .
ailin had never heard of anyone .
jazz , even though it was not directly prohibited , was not played .
the improvisation was not modern anymore .
the room was very small and the bed was very comfortable .
at the beginning of a melody , people wanted to be quite sure where they would end .
the same applies to the mind .
his unpredictability made people nervous .
and jazz was musically expressed mind .
although he was 10 years old , without being heard by sammy davis junior , kevern knew something about jazz from the half-secret collection of old cds of his father .
but at least he did not have to explain to ailin that fats waller was black .
at her age she could probably not remember a time when pop singers were not black .
again , no laws or constraints were applied .
a conformist society meant that each element of this society thankfully endorsed the principle of group talent - thankfully as that of destiny spared .
people of afro-caribbean origin were affected by temperament and body construction for entertainment and sports , so sang and ran them .
people who were originally from the indian subcontinent were treated with electronic talent , as if by nature , and were faced with the task of ensuring that no family can be left without a working service telephone .
what was left of the polish community was concerned about sewage treatment ; what was said by the greeks was broken down plates .
those from the gulf states and the levante , whose grandparents had not quickly left the country than what had happened when it had happened - out of fear , because of fire , to be accused of being accused , feared .
each according to his abilities .
since she only heard ballads , ailin found it hard to understand how the offensive words that kvers put her just now are .
music was an expression of love .
&quot; they are not really offensive , &quot; said kevern .
except perhaps for people whose feet are too large .
my father never insulted anyone , but he loved this song .
he talked too much , but the neglected garden gave him the deceptive sense of security .
nothing could have been the sound insulation of the huge coal-like leaves .
ailin still did not understand .
why should your father have loved this ?
he wanted to say that it was a jux , but hesitated to bring two fingers back to the lips in their present .
she thought that he was something strange anyway .
&quot; it seemed funny to him , &quot; he said instead .
she shaken disbelief and closed biscuit ’ s sight .
there was nothing else to see around the world than to see her uncombed rabenblack hair .
there was nothing he would have liked to see .
&quot; if you say it , &quot; do you mean without conviction .
but that doesn &apos;t explain why you are telling me .
it seemed to be genuinely concerned .
are my feet too big ?
he looked back .
your feet so directly not .
maybe your ankles , a little bit of a ...
and thou sayest hate me because my ankles are too thick ?
hate you ?
of course i hate you not .
that is just the silly song .
he could have said &quot; i love you &quot; , but for that it was too early .
&quot; your thick ankles are the reason why you like me , &quot; he tried instead .
i am a bit perverse .
that did not sound right .
it was funny .
if he tried to be funny , he often got into trouble because he , like his father , did not have the soothing charm that was needed to get the money into jokes .
perhaps his father also wanted to be cruel .
perhaps he wanted to be that , kveren .
despite his kind eyes .
ailin solomons was red and raised from her deck chair , threw the console and disposed of the rope , the wine she had drunk .
holunderblüttewein , so drunkenheit was no excuse for him .
in her excitement she seemed to tremble as palmwedel in storm .
&quot; and your thicket head is precisely the reason why i felt perverted towards you , &quot; she said ...
except that i am not .
she was sorry , both for the unnecessary useless nature of his words and the fear that she showed when she spoke to him .
did she think that he would beat them ?
she had not told him of life on the cold northern archipelago , where she had grown up , but he had no doubt that it was essentially the same as here .
the same huge and icy ocean broke out here as there on the shore .
the same confused men , with even thicker skin and more vulnerable after what happened than it had their ancestors as smugglers and beach robbers , attracted from kneipe to kneipe to kneipe .
thickhead ?
they would have shown her a big fist if she didn &apos;t care !
you just crunch - knutschen was the most used word for an erotic attraction between men and women , a counterpoison to the nonsense love sons .
kevern ’ s view was that this was unnecessary refinement , as crutching itself was an act of violence .
ailin solomons gave him a sign to walk through her body .
he was raised from the deck-chair like an old man .
she also felt bleeding , but the balance of his sorrow surprised her .
that was not the end of the world .
they knew little .
she saw him as he departed - as if from a room on the top floor her companion watched him - a man complained about something he himself had been summoned .
adam leaves the garden , thought it .
she felt a sudden pain for him and men in general , although some had raised their hands against them .
one man turned away from her , worried his back , ashamed , defeated , without a spirit of struggle - why was this a sight that you seemed to know well when you were not at a single time .
when she was alone again , ailin looked at solomon &apos;s feet .
several years before the events that have just been told , esme nussbaum , an intelligent and enthusiastic 32-year-old researcher , worked on behalf of ofnow , the non-legislative supervisory body for the public sector .
&quot; a lot has been done and a lot still needs to be done , &quot; she wrote , &quot; to understand the innate aggressiveness of a people who have waged a thousand wars and won most of them , especially in the remote valleys .
but some characteristics turn out to be unextincable .
the higher the church tower , it seems , the less the passion it continues to awaken .
the people are crying in the hearing of sentimental ballads , amazed by stories of overcome difficulties , and claim to be firmly attached to the virtues of marriage and family life , but not only does the former remain the same .
&quot; they have an unfortunate tendency to exaggerate , &quot; she meant when he read the whole report .
i suggest that you read less novels .
esme walnut tree dropped her head .
i must also ask : are you atheist ?
&quot; i do not think i need to say , &quot; esme answered nussbaum .
are you lesbian ?
esme again invoked her right to privacy and refusal of the statement .
feminist ?
silence again .
&quot; i don &apos;t ask that , &quot; luther rabinowitz said , &quot; because i am against atheism , lesbianism or feminism .
this is a job without prejudice .
we are serving a society free of prejudice .
but certain types of hypersensitivity that are in themselves absolutely acceptable and commendable can occasionally produce results such as those you have presented .
they themselves seem to have prejudices against the church , and these things , which they call &apos; disgusting &apos; and &apos; raw &apos; , could be interpreted by others as an expression of natural strength and vitality .
if you continue to ride around what happened when it happened , as if it were , if it had happened , yesterday , then you would have given the country its essential vitality .
esme walked around , while rabinowitz spoke .
behind his head , a led lettering in flamingorosa repeated the advice ofnow gave to the country in the last quarter of a century or longer .
smile at your neighbors , value your partner , listen to ballads , visit musicals , use your phone , talk , explain , listen to , agree , agree , excuse yourself .
speaking is better than silence , the sound word is better than the written word , but nothing is better than love .
&quot; i understand absolutely what you want to go to , &quot; esme nussbaum answered with a calm voice when she was sure that her superior had spoken at the end , &quot; and i say nothing more than that we were healed .
my concern is that we may be able to find ourselves , without warning , in the way we repeat the mistakes that have actually occurred in the first place , as to what happened when it happened .
this time , however , it is not the others that we are going to let out our anger and mistrust .
luther rabinowitz formed a pyramid with his hands .
to be able to show an engelspatience .
&quot; they go too far , &quot; he said , &quot; if they call actions &quot; mistakes &quot; that our grandparents may or may not have committed .
they are also going too far when they say that they have their &apos; anger &apos; and their &apos; mistrust &apos; of &apos; others &apos; .
it should not be necessary to remind someone in their position that we have been very careful in understanding the past and protecting the present , not of &apos; us &apos; and &apos; others &apos; .
there was no &quot; we &quot; and there was no &quot; other &quot; .
it was a time of disorder , that is all we know .
&quot; from that , if we are honest to ourselves , &quot; dared to throw esme , &quot; no part of society can claim to have behaved well .
i am not complaining to anyone .
whether it has been done badly or well , what has happened has happened .
that was then .
there is nothing more to say on this - we agree .
and just as no blame must be assigned , no guilt must be repaid if such repayment is appropriate and if there is a way to repay it .
but what is the past for if we do not learn from it -
the past serves to forget them .
if i may say something about this , i would like to say something about it .
luther rabinowitz had his pyramid collapsed .
&quot; i will consider your report , &quot; he said and dismissed it .
the next day , when she went to work as usual , she was crossed by a motorcyclist who , as passers-by described , was in a kind of &quot; brutal rage &quot; on the foot .
there are some coincidence .
lesotho military member says that no coup is planned ; prime minister remains in south africa ; prime minister remains in south africa ; prime minister remains in south africa
military officials in lesotho argued that a coup d &apos;état would overthrow the government , and said that it was going against policemen who had been denied the arming of political fanatics .
prime minister thomas thabane fled the country and announced that the country ’ s army had rallied his domicile and built government buildings in the capital , maseru .
the premier brought his family to the adjacent south africa after being told of threats of attack .
military spokesman major ntele ntoi said that there was , in fact , no coup d &apos;état , but that the military was responding to the threat of &quot; political fanatics &quot; , whose armed presence .
&quot; what happened this morning was that the staff of lesotho &apos;s defense forces acted after he received several intelligence reports that within the police some elements could act that were actually some of the political , party political young fanatics .
south african spokesman clayson monyela said that military action had the impression of a reversal .
&quot; although no one has claimed that violence has torn the government itself , all reports are agreed that the activities of the lesotto defence forces have so far been indicative of a coup d &apos;état , &quot; he said .
spokesman for the lesotho military announced on sunday that the soldiers had returned to their barracks and had to leave the capital in peace .
in the meantime , vice premier mothetjoya metsing has taken over the governance of thabane ’ s absence .
thabane told him that he believed he was injured because of his attempt to combat corruption in the country .
in lesotho , there have been major tensions since june , after thabane had suspended parliamentary meetings due to the dispute in his unified government .
he said that his actions had not undermined the government , and that he had not done so .
production in the eurozone at a 13 month low
the rise in eurozone production slowed to € 1.2 billion in august , with the eurozone ’ s lowest point in the last 13 months .
the final markit purchasing mana index of the manufacturing industry ( pmi ) fell to 50.7 in august , after a booth of 51.8 in july .
a 50 number indicates an expansion .
new orders have been declining and factories have been falling at a time of rising tensions between the eu and russia over ukraine .
the figures are coming up before the european central bank ( ecb ) meeting on thursday .
markets expect the bank to draw up a clear plan for dealing with a reluctant eurozone recovery and the threat of deflation at a rate of only 0.3 % .
there is speculation that the head of the ecb , mario draghi , will be able to provide further information later this week as to whether he can provide quantitative easing for the eurozone , in line with that of the us and the united kingdom .
&quot; although small growth is better than no growth , the slowing effects of increasing economic and geopolitical uncertainties are more obvious to manufacturers , &quot; rob dobson , senior economic scientist , said .
the factory pmi for germany , russia &apos;s largest trading partner in the eu , has fallen to its lowest level in 11 months with 51.4 .
meanwhile , in the second largest economy of the bloc , france , the pmi fell to 46.9 .
france remains a troubled child , as is italy ’ s decline from solid expansion to stagnation .
indications that growth stimulus is the key to germany and spain and the netherlands are no longer effective are also unreassuring , &quot; said mr dobson .
the decline in industry is likely to fuel the fire of analysts who seek further monetary or fiscal stimulus .
a positive news came from the republic of ireland , where the pmi increased to 57.3 , the highest level since the end of 1999 .
howard archer , chief economist at ihs global insight , said : &quot; the best thing you can do for the department store manager index is to get the most out of august .
he added : &apos; eurozone producers are obviously finding life quite difficult at the moment , as the current heightened geopolitical tensions - particularly in relation to russia and ukraine - are causing uncertainty in the still difficult conditions in many countries .
these increased uncertainties have clearly affected the economy - particularly , and consumer confidence , and probably will lead to some orders being delayed or even cancelled , particularly large orders .
he said that it would be &apos; ever more likely &apos; that the ecb would eventually have to launch a kind of qe &apos; although we suspect that this will be limited &apos; .
the hellenic decade of beslan survivors : ten years have passed since the terrible siege of the school , as the children who were involved are still suffering .
ten years ago , over 1 000 people were killed by chechen militias in a school in beslan in southern russia .
more than 330 people , more than half of them children , were killed in the three-day martyrdom that shocked the world .
we have returned to beslan to find some of the victims who died at the abomination in class .
exactly a decade after the appalling siege of the beslan school , which killed 334 people , including 186 children , the heroic survivors warned of a new apocalysis last night in ukraine .
as fanatical islamist terrorists , children and parents on 1 september 2004 , the start of a new school year , were captured and killed , it seemed like the worst of evil .
the tragedy uniting west and east in abhorrence , and then turned surprisingly into action and hope for the future in the midst of the worst misery .
ten years later , we returned to beslan to find some of the victims who died at the abomination in class .
we found surprising young people who have overcome resistance , although the memory of this terrorist hell has been watching them forever .
your greatest hope ?
the fact that the war that is now affecting ukraine - and in which children like them die - is now coming to an end .
the girl who was photographed in an attempt to go into the shattered school gym was not allowed to climb back into the shattered school gym .
it was created by russian star photographer dimitri beliakov and famous when she was only active in underwear to get into the torn school sport hall .
aida was looking for her mother larissa , now 40 years old .
both were considered dead , but they survived .
&quot; a woman told me i should run for my life , but i could not , &quot; said aida then .
my legs were bloodshed .
i stood up and climbed back into to look for my mother .
a soldier brought them into security .
after a series of operations , she thought she was completely healed , but said yesterday : &quot; three months ago , the pain returned .
i fear that i have to be operated again .
some pomegranate shards are still in my knees .
your goal is to become a dentist to help people as your doctor has helped you .
&quot; this tragedy changed my life , but it did not break me , &quot; she says campaurustig .
&quot; that happened to me , and that is something that cannot be changed .
once a year i always go to the sports hall to remember those who stayed there .
my friends and i try not to talk about it on other days .
the pain is too great .
my best friend and future classmate dzera gapoeva was killed there .
we played together when we were small , dreaming of going to school together .
&quot; i don &apos;t want to marry until i finish my studies and start my career .
i am thinking of a family later .
she says that the siege will always remain a part of it , even though the memory becomes a little weaker every year .
i am glad that many people around the world still remember our horrors and we are so grateful for the help we receive from people in the uk and everywhere .
when i see the photo of me online how to go back to school , i think that many people will see it for the first time , understand our disaster and help to prevent this happening again .
the boy who fled through the ball hail , in the opinion that his mother was dead , was killed .
it was his first day of school ( russians go to school at the age of 7 ) and survived the three-day siege in the arms of his mother tamara .
as a seven-year old , he said : &apos; mama told me i should lie down if there were an explosion and hold your hand &apos; .
after an explosion he thought she would die .
she said to him : &apos; run . &apos;
fear that it could be dead , he fled and saw a crying infant on the way , seized it by hand , and fled through a ball hail .
his father vladimir , who had his son in the arms outside , said : &apos; damir told me that his mother had died .
he said : &apos; i could not save them &apos; .
in reality , tamara was stumbling outside and injuries in the hospital , for its part , assuming that its son had died .
after reunification , she said : &apos; i wept with joy .
i could not believe it .
he ran in and hugged me .
damir was later flown to london ( news of the world ) , which was dissolved in the meantime , to receive a response from former premier tony blair and his wife cherie to a barnardo &apos;s children .
&quot; this horror follows you every day , but i wish i could stop remembering , &quot; he said yesterday .
but i can say that it is getting paler in my memory .
i know that i will be able to remove all my toy gun immediately afterwards .
but now i can play computer games with shot scenes and that is no problem for me .
&quot; i am not afraid to go back to the sports hall , but i don &apos;t think about myself .
i remember those children with whom i played in the court and who did not manage to go outside .
we never say that they have been killed or are dead .
we say that they have stayed in the sports hall .
i remember very well my trip to london , especially to the toy store where i made a choice of everything i wanted to do and made the trip in an open car .
but now he is afraid of places like ukraine , where wars cause the kind of misfortune he and his friends suffered .
this horror follows you every day , but i wish i could stop reminding me .
&quot; i am so sorry for all those who suffer from the abominations , &quot; said damir , who was volunteer in a monastery last week .
i am so happy to help .
one day i want to go to the police and hope that you will be able to take me to the school academy next year .
his mother tamara , 48 , said : &quot; 37 children from our neighbourhood were killed , you can imagine ?
i remember the terrible silence that followed the siege , there were simply no children who shouted and could walk around , and this silence lasted many months .
she vividly reminds her trip to london with damir .
the people of london wept when i told our story .
i understood then how people on the other side of the world could understand our feelings and show their support .
she was grateful to cherie blair and her foundation for the prize and the opportunity to travel to london in the autumn of 2004 .
i wish i could call cherie and simply tell her that 10 years have passed , but i still remember the meeting with her and her husband in london , and how that damir and me helped .
i remember that damir would like to eat borschch and that she would call on all local russian restaurants .
i remember he was working with waiter in a restaurant , and damir was shooting his water gun on her and running the way and playing with him .
and that was just one month after the horror .
i was surprised that the british were so willing to share our pain and support us .
she said : &quot; i always think that this world has not improved in these 10 years .
in ukraine , the war is now continuing , and people are dying every day , and i believe that many children have been killed and are still being killed .
these are just as children as ours .
i think that for many , war is part of the news they hear when they are bored or preoccupied with something else .
i simply know what these people feel , all the horror .
and i can not stop feeling that .
nothing has changed , people still want to kill each other , and that is so sad .
damir became big and is a very gentle and quiet boy , he is not at all aggressive or angry .
for example , he is not seeking revenge , he is not overwhelmed by the past abominations .
i know that he does not like to remember it , but he has six close friends from the class and they occasionally go to the sports hall and ignite there candles .
when he was smaller , he suffered - i remember how he sometimes referred to the sofa , the face was turned away from us , for hours .
not sleeping , his eyes were open .
i also remember how he used all his weapons and other military toys , and damir is now 17 , larger than i am , in good looking , intelligent and healthy ways .
i can hardly believe that i was so sure for a few hours that he was dead and i would never see him again .
when i recovered after the explosion and came to my feet , i looked around and saw the hell around me , with all around the body parts .
i was absolutely sure that my little boy was unable to survive in this hell .
&quot; i remember that i told him , &quot; damir , run , run away &quot; , but i was also so sure that he did not hear me .
but he heard it and he went away .
and thus life , unlike that of many others , goes on for us .
georgij ilyin 17
the boy whose terrible image has become the symbol of the abominations of beslan after the siege , the abomination of beslan was made symbol of the abominations .
consolation : the beslan survivor georgij lyin with his mother fatima after the siege in 2004 , right a picture of georgij today is a picture of georgij today .
his bloodshed was characterized by fear when he ran for his life , while chechen terrorists had his class cameramen shook .
his image was one of the most shocking symbols of beslan &apos;s barbarity .
his mother fatima , 54 , a doctor , had deposed him for his first day of school before rushing to protect her older son vladimir .
&quot; i left the court about two minutes before the terrorists stormed him , and so my little boy remained there for three terrible days alone , &quot; she remembers .
not quite alone , there was a whole family of relatives of us , but they were all killed .
only my georgij managed to survive .
the closer this date is , the harder it is to think about it and talk about it .
there is not a single day when we do not remember this tragedy .
we do not think it is a long time ago , i think it would have happened yesterday , some scenes from these days are watching me forever .
no one will ever forget that , i promise you .
insistently : the image of georgij ( left ) was one of the most shocking of the attack and was perpetuated as a statue ( right ) .
i remember that georgij was so keen to go to school on that day , saying he wanted to hug his teacher .
i knew he was alive when i was watching him on television .
and now there is even this statue of the weeping georgij in san marino .
georgij does not like the picture , and it is at home in our bookshelf .
i understand that , but i also think that , thanks to this image , people around the world feel our pain .
georgij says today : &quot; it is important that this never happens again .
&quot; i doubt that we will ever know the truth .
people are constantly investigating such tragedies and never knowing the truth .
and now you investigate the crash of this boeing in ukraine .
will we ever know what caused it ?
this world is becoming a terrible thing .
&quot; i cannot understand how this is possible , because if you ask people , no one wants a war , so how is it happening ?
ten years is nothing at all with such pain .
we need dozens of years to forget it a little .
it has attacked my health and i still feel it .
for about three or four years i had some nightmares for the siege , but then it became better .
i went back to school later in 2004 and was afraid every day .
i thought of my friends and classmates who had been killed .
that is why i always go to the sports hall when the 1st of september approaches .
i want to pay tribute to my old childhood friends .
it is difficult for me to go to the sports hall , but i have to do it .
i do not feel a victim , this story is now part of my past .
i will not forget it , but i do not regret it .
my life is continuing .
i finished school this year and i am visiting a medical college in vladikawkaz .
i will become a cardiac surgeon .
my first choice was an education in the army .
i wanted to become a soldier , but my health did not allow it .
i wanted to fight for my country , but that will not happen .
georgij faniyev 20
the boy who survived , although he was at the feet of a murderous terrorist , was not a man of war .
a miracle : georgij faniyev was on the siege to the feet of a murderous terrorist , but he managed to survive .
during the siege , he was captured in the sports hall and sat beside the bomb that was at the foot of a murderous terrorist .
it is a real miracle that he was not killed .
&quot; we feel it was yesterday , &quot; says georgij , who was a secret service officer to the fsb , but this is because of his health damage due to the siege .
it is still with me , it is not something i left behind .
i am now older and people say that children can easily cope with bad experiences - i must say that is not true .
&quot; in 2006 i worked with psychologists and felt a little better after that , but i can not forget .
and i would like to forget .
2005 - in the year after - was the first and only time that i went back to the sports hall .
i lost consciousness .
i will never return to that place again and please do not ask me to show you where i sat in this famous picture .
survivors : georgij faniyev today , with a photo of himself in hospital after the siege on the laptop .
my pain is monstrous and i carry it with me every day .
my friends know that i do not like thinking about it or talking about it and they never asked me for school .
physically , i am doing well .
i should be careful with my injured knee , but i can now run well .
but because of my health i could not attend the fsb ’ s intelligence academy in st. petersburg as i wanted .
i have sent my documents , including the medical ones , and you have replied that it is not possible .
my second passion was the animals , so i went to the vet institute .
i have been there for two years .
he learns the treatment of all animals &quot; from cats to cows &quot; .
he said : &apos; i knew i never told my children about my experiences .
children should not be aware of this and they should not suffer it , of course .
his mother marina , 42 , said : &quot; this pain never leaves me .
it is in my soul , worse when the anniversary approaches .
i will go to the celebrations to commemorate .
i know that georgiy will not go .
it must be even more violent for him , because he was there and i was not .
i waited at home for him and could not help .
i am so grateful to god that he has been returned to me , and here in beslan all of them are drawn .
it remains in us .
georgij is now an adult , but this horror is still in him .
it is difficult to accept that if something so unfair is encountered .
he is a boy , he likes sport , but he cannot participate because of his knees .
it has been operated several times , it can run but it can not do sport .
i would say that he has overcome 50 % of horror , but you can never completely overcome it and forget it .
this terrible experience will always follow us .
many friends and neighbours were killed during the siege , and that only reinforces my pain .
i lost many people i knew well and who were expensive .
my son is with me , and this is the biggest gift that god could make me , but my heart cry for the killed .
i know of families where new children were born , but also of widows who were never married again .
it is difficult to accept that life continues , even if you do not want it .
i will never forget how my heart jumped in me when i saw him in hospital .
and now i see what is happening in the world - wars in other regions .
what are these people fighting for ?
why are they killing each other ?
the war is now very close to our country and i almost cannot believe it .
we used to be a friendly country , how can we fight now ?
people and children suffer , i am sure that many children have already been killed in ukraine and many are still being killed .
if we only take all these rebels and throw them out - as far as possible .
aljona tskajewa 10
the baby , so seamlessly being taken by a special mission command in safety , is a baby that has been worn in safety by a special mission force .
save : aljona tskajewa is being safely taken by a russian special mission command ( left ) .
it is now ten ( right ) and has no recollection whatsoever of the cruelties that have occurred in the past .
the world breathe in 2004 when baby aljona was in the arms of a russian policeman from the beslan siege .
the terrorists left them , but kept their 30-year-old mother , the 10-year-old sister of kristina and their brother makhar in the school hall in their cruelty .
makhar , who was three years old at that time , escaped , but aljonas &apos;s mother and sister died in the murderous assassination .
her father ruslan has since married again and has worked with his new wife swetlana a a little girl that he has been cristina after his lost daughter .
aljona , ten years old today , does not remember the siege and has become an intelligent and happy girl , say neighbors .
&quot; you are now a great happy family and aljona and makhar are both great children , &quot; says a close friend .
ruslan was a fantastic father and wants to remind you of all the memories that had been brought up with the tenth anniversary .
you will understand why .

4 tips for better underwater photos and videos
if you would like to make photos or videos under water , there is a selection of devices available .
the cheapest option is a waterproof point and shoot , like the nikon coolpix aw120 or an action shoot .
i took these photos at a family party with several cameras , all at a price of under $ 350 .
regardless of the equipment , there are some rules for the best results .
check your equipment twice .
even if you have a waterproof camera , make sure that the battery compartment and other compartments are closed tightly .
also put your camera on the photos or videos you want to record .
some cameras and camcorder have scene and recording modes that allow for the exposure time for the insulation of the underwater conditions .
and before you jump in , check to what depth your equipment is working .
some cameras are only allowed for up to 5 feet , others up to 50 or 60 feet .
search our shopping guide and review for digital cameras for conventional and waterproof models .
do multiple recordings - because many will not fall .
point-and-shoot cameras have an lcd to compile images with , action-cam usually not .
even if you have an lcd , it is difficult to see this under water , and the correct image setting is a fortune .
so you take a lot of pictures .
if your camera has a row mode that allows you to capture a series of pictures with slightly changed exposure settings , use it .
stay close to the surface .
the worse the light , the further you move away from the surface .
if possible , they stay close to the surface when shooting in a pool , a lake or the sea .
this will also allow you to add more color to your photos ; the deeper you go , the less color you will see .
go close to the objects .
this is also a good advice on land , but it is all the more important in the light of the poor light conditions .
it is particularly important to have an action cam : these devices often have a fixed wide-angle lens , which means that they can be tighter to your objects .
andrew lawson was a man of the sort whose character changed things , even in such a gigantic organization as the nhs .
as a consultant anaesthetist , he devoted his career to the task of providing the sick with both agony of the disease and pain of treatment .
among his patients , his wife remembers , was a mi6 employee who was familiar with the devastating effects of torture .
lawson knew that doctors had to be given the diagnosis and disease , while the treated were mostly treated with something quite different : pain .
one day in 2007 , however , he was the one whose path of suffering began .
&quot; i didn &apos;t feel , &quot; he wrote in may this year .
i had difficulty getting up .
while he is fighting with the symptoms of flu , he remarked that he was impatient in accusing his wife juliet .
&quot; i want to do everything immediately rather than later , &quot; he noted .
when juliet was on a business trip for a week , lawson felt unusually and unreasonably worried .
something was in the air .
he asked a colleague to carry out an x-ray examination of his breast .
only two weeks ago he was a ski runner in the french alps .
the result of the x-ray inspection was available .
he suffered from mesotheliom , an incurable cancer that could destroy the chest coat , that is , the skin that overdraws the lungs .
as with most cancers , the exact trigger is usually difficult to determine .
for example , while some smokers suffer from lung cancer , not all lung cancer sufferers used to smoke .
but mesotheliom is different .
in almost all cases , the trigger is an asbestos load - contact with the fibre which was once considered a &quot; miracle &quot; but has now been recognized as lethal .
for most of us mesotheliom is a disease that can easily ignore .
asbestos is , after all , a product of the past .
the most dangerous type of asbestos has not been used in britain since the 1960s , when industry voluntarily committed itself to no longer using it .
even where it was still used , only people in certain sectors worked directly with the fabric - plumbers , construction workers , carpenters and shipyard workers , for example .
as an industrial hazardous material from another era , it seems hardly worrying today .
but this complacency is inappropriate .
britain , it seems , is today experiencing the culmination of a mesotheliom epidemic .
there are more deaths from mesotheliom here than in any other country in the world .
with a total of 2,500 deaths per year , twice as many people die of this disease as road accidents .
annual figures for mesothelium deaths since 1980 and likely future deaths in the uk are expected to be in the uk .
the reason we are now experiencing the lethal effects , even though asbestos has been illegal for years ( in 1999 all types of asbestos were banned ) is that a mesotheliom only develops after decades .
and the scourge of mesotheliom is not confined to former construction workers .
asbestos was , and is still often , present in the houses where we live , the offices in which we work , the schools where we learn and the shops in which we shop .
and therefore mesotheliom knows no class barriers , financial limits , professions or age .
the privileged bastions , surrounded by the elegant department stores in london and private schools , are not a shelter .
parliament &apos;s buildings are contaminated by asbestos .
in the hospitals where we are supposed to be healthy , we are already starting from this deadly carcinogens .
andrew lawson was not old .
he was not a plumber either .
he was in fact hard to imagine where he could possibly be in contact with asbestos .
then he found it out .
&quot; it looks as though the tunnels at guy &apos;s hospital , where i have spent six years in my training , are a lot of asbestos . &quot;
all - students , nurses , doctors and patrons - use the tunnels .
one wonders how many of my fellow citizens will suffer from the same disease ?
unfortunately , he was able to answer at least part of that question .
&quot; of the four doctors who attended guy &apos;s hospital , and the four doctors who have been working in mesotheliom for the last five years , &quot; he wrote in a letter in 2010 , &quot; am i the one ?
how many of us will suffer ?
in the case of andrew lawson , mesotheliom was diagnosed at the age of 48 .
when he died on 17 february this year , he was 55 .
this was an unusually long period of survival .
fifty percent of mesothelium diseases die within 8 months of diagnosis .
the disease always ends in death .
we can therefore only repeat lawson &apos;s question : &apos; how many of us will be affected ? &apos;
britain ’ s leading expert on mesotheliom , professor julian peto , assumes that between 1870 and 2050 , when asbestos infection is expected to stall in britain , a total of 90,000 will .
most of them have no idea that they will die in this way .

a quick look at the files of the courts , to which the persons concerned often turn for claims for damages , shows how far the scourge of the mesotheliom is already prevalent .
in june of this year , marks &amp; spencer , for example , admitted that janice had been negligently exposed to asbestos .
she worked for nine years for the chain , from 1978 to 1987 and was responsible for the clothing department at two locations - one of them the flagship store in oxford street .
mrs. allen was only 18 years when she started her activity at m &amp; s .
now she has two children in the twenties .
&quot; before this thing , &quot; she says , &quot; i had never heard of mesotheliom , i did not even know anything about asbestos .
i never thought that would affect me .
there are few people who know a lot about asbestos .
the fact is that the term asbestos is not a substance but a group of six minerals .
the name derives from the word &quot; asbestotiform &quot; , a description of the fibre structure that makes the fabric resistant and flexible .
three of the six were used in the construction industry .
chrysotile , also known as white asbestos , is by far the most common asbestos found in buildings .
it was designed for roof panels , floor panels , pipe insulation , boilers insulation , even for braking coverings in cars .
it is less lethal than other forms of asbestos , but is still described by the eu and the who as a &apos; major health risk &apos; with possible death .
however , the brown asbestos ( amosite ) and the blue asbestos ( krokydolith ) are more dangerous .
britain was once the world ’ s largest importer of brown asbestos , and experts suspect that &apos; there are clear but indirect indications that this is a major reason for the uniquely high mesothelium rates &apos; .
a mark &amp; spencer employee was born in the flagship store on oxford street , london , asbestos exposed alamy to alamy .
janice allen may not have proven to be a typical mesotheliomopper , but the work of julian peto suggests that her story is not unusual .
he has presented a study of the people concerned , which states that &apos; a significant proportion of mesotheliomas can be found in asbestos in the environment without any known suspension from work or in the house &apos; .
he says that a large proportion of these contacts are based on the &apos; normal use and ageing &apos; of our buildings .
it looks as if no one can assume that they are safe .
a report by goddard consulting , which describes the palace of westminster , shows how people can live in the heart of the government , unknowingly , as a result of the substance .
in 2009 , goddard reported that service shafts and pipes were being built behind parliament &apos;s committee rooms with asbestos , whose deadly fibres were replaced by something as harmless as &quot; strong air movements &quot; .
members of parliament are often accused of looking after their own interests , but it seems that there is no such thing as the opposite .
while the parliamentary labour directorate insisted that the westminster palace should be a &apos; clean health certificate &apos; , it is now undisputed that eur 1 billion of work has gone into the works over several years .
the goddard report also pointed out that &apos; the presence of asbestos cannot be managed in accordance with the relevant provisions &apos; .
no one can know whether this mismanagement will cost lives .
all that can be done is wait .
a person who never had the ability to determine contact with asbestos is graham abbott , a general practitioner .
as andrew lawson suggests , 50 year old abbott suspects that he would be exposed to asbestos while working in hospitals .
&quot; i worked in a hospital where asbestos complaints were decided positively , &quot; he says , &quot; but i can not prove it in my case .
it is so difficult to remember all the places where people have worked and the data .
what he still remembers is the day in early december 2009 , when he was given a kind of fever .
he was 45 , and just late in the evening he carried out an operation .
suddenly i had chills .
it came all of a sudden .
i felt terrible .
i thought that the journey home was no longer possible .
as a doctor , abbott knew that the pain from the chest fur , the skin around his lungs had stirred .
but , like janice all , he had no reason to suspect a mesotheliom .
he did not go to work for a month .
the doctors were astonished by taking x-ray pictures of his breast and using pleurakathther to remove fluid from the lungs and test it in the laboratory .
his complaints , however , remained without diagnosis .
his health improved slowly , and he returned to his job .
from time to time , however , symptoms have returned , often after exercise and intense breathing .
in 2011 , a patient came to abbott with similar symptoms in his practice and was diagnosed later with mesotheliom .
but abbott did not associate this with his own case .
after all , his patient was a few decades older and had worked directly with asbestos .
the link in that case was clear .
in september 2011 , abbott ’ s condition deteriorated , and his family doctor introduced his ct scans and x-ray recordings to a group of experts .
in december 2011 , exactly two years after abbott felt ill for the first time , a camera equipped sonde was inserted into the cave between the rib and chest coat .
i am an optimist .
i usually just continue , &quot; he says .
frankly , i had not been so concerned about so many things .
but rachel , my wife , was concerned .
the result of biopsy was a year between christmas and new year &apos;s eve : &quot; i was told that it was mesotheliom . &quot;
graham abbott : diagnostic mesotheliom
suddenly , abbott had appointments with macmillan nurses , one of whom advised him to seek a lawyer .
only now did he see the extent of the epidemic .
&quot; it turned out that asbestos was very widespread , especially in large public buildings where tubes are often isolated with asbestos , &quot; he says .
the people who were exposed to asbestos in these buildings are now suffering .
and thus , mesotheliom now hits younger people who have not worked in the typical professions .
the most dangerous tubes with asbestos solidification in hospitals were below ground , so patients were probably not exposed to the substance .
but many employees who have been killed in pedestrian tunnels from one building to another ( like andrew lawson ) or in underground canteens ( as it was graham abbott often did ) have to be killed .
it is evident that , over several decades after the war , hospitals may have saved patients life , but they are life-threatening for the treating doctors .
it is still being removed today .
students put their buns on asbestos mats .
and it does not just concern hospitals .
asbestos has been awarded the &quot; best &quot; quality award for its fabulous insulating and flame-retardant properties .
schools , too , are involved .
indeed , many people may have had the first asbestos contact in the classroom .
everywhere in the country , in thousands of chemistry lessons , students have their buns placed on asbestos mats .
the topic of asbestos in schools is now frequently addressed on websites .
meanwhile , innocent objects in our houses , such as floor panels or scalp cups , have asbestos by default .
&quot; it is an industrial poison that is contained in large parts of our real estate , &quot; notes andrew morgan , the lawyer , the andrew lawson in his trial against guy &apos;s hospital .
in one case , the only contact that struck an affected woman was the demolition of a shed in the 1970s .
so watch out for the tear of your shed .
the effects of diagnosis , and the knowledge that the disease is incurable , is immense .
&quot; it takes a while to process this , &quot; says graham abbott .
i went back to work and tried to continue , but i realized that i did not concentrate on what i did .
i was in practice for two weeks .
then i knew i would go and take care of myself .
well , i will not be going to see another christmas .
the biggest difficulty was the change in perspective from a doctor &apos;s position to that of a patient .
like countless patients before him , he remembers how overwhelmed he was with all the information he was having to cope with .
&quot; it was very difficult to include all of this , &quot; he says .
&quot; i asked my doctor &quot; how long have i left ? &quot;
and they gave me about 12 months .
i remember that i thought &quot; well , i will not have another christmas .
that was &apos; s it . &apos;
mesotheliom is particularly insidious because it is our life-keeping mechanism - breathing itself - that causes the deadly cancer .
most cases of mesotheliom are caused by asbestos contact .
asbestos is made up of smallest fibres .
if asbestos is rotated and fibres are inhaled , they can be wound up in the chest coat , the skin around the lungs .
asbestos fibres irritate the chest coat and can cause cell mutations .
&quot; the problem arises with the inhaled coniferous asbestos fibres , &quot; says professor tom treasure , a heart thorax doctor who passed to the guy &apos;s hospital in 2001 .
the hospital of andrew lawson &apos;s suspicion that he had been exposed to asbestos is now ironically a leading centre in the treatment of mesotheliom .
treasure knew lawson and treated some others who probably also had to be in hospital during their training .
once the asbestos needles reach the lung tissue , treasure says , &quot; they will be marginalized by the breathing process where the skin is .
from the very beginning it is invasive .
the usual options for other cancers do not work well in mesotheliom .
the effectiveness of an operation is , for example , highly controversial .
some people think it is worth trying .
treasure denies this .
&quot; you cannot cut the chest fur out , &quot; he says .
they do not get around with knife .
meanwhile , cancer speaks &quot; on chemotherapy not very well , &quot; the &quot; effect shows &quot; but does not cure .
&quot; sometimes there are long-time survivors , &quot; says treasure .
but in the end they all die .
fortunately , some patients are actually living long , much longer than expected .
the author stephen jay gould died 20 years after the diagnosis .
two and a half years after his own diagnosis , graham abbott is still fighting .
after contacting mesotheliom , abbott came into contact with andrew lawson , who , four years after his diagnosis , had developed a one-man support and consulting office for people who had been affected .
&quot; hello , cancer center , &quot; he stood cheerfully on calls .
&quot; he was very positive , &quot; says abbott .
he had received his diagnosis four years earlier and was still very active .
originally , abbott was offered six chemotherapy cycles that lasted four months and are expected to last for only one month .
&quot; i was desperate , &quot; he says .
i wanted to give up .
lawson , however , &quot; managed to do things in a more positive light &quot; .
after consulting several doctors , abbott decided to continue his treatment with prof. loic lang-lazdunski , cardiac specialist at guy &apos;s .
&quot; we had an advantage because i had to be not redirected , i just called and got a date , &quot; graham admits .
a normal patient would have to be given a referral and wait for the treatment to be approved .
money is crucial to the patients with mesotheliom in order to be able to take the best available therapies .
but if these treatments inevitably fail , many people will be affected by a different financial concern - about the future of families they have left behind .
and so they turn to the courts in the hope of compensation .
andrew lawson contacted andrew morgan of field fisher waterhouse llp .
&quot; it has been known since 1898 that asbestos is extremely dangerous to health , &quot; says morgan .
but what changed in the 1960s is that it was recognized that very small burdens were also a health risk .
and here , corporate negligence began to play a role .
andrew lawson and guy &apos;s hospital finally brought their case to light , but it was not what morgan called a &quot; full compensation . &quot;
after his death , a guy &apos;s spokesman confirmed that &quot; asbestos fibres in the cellar affected are not present in the 1990s . &quot;
this was too late for andrew lawson .
how to remove asbestos
indeed , it is a very difficult time for mesotheliom sufferers who seek compensation to solve an enormous problem , the deadly contact between asbestos and a workplace - usually decades after the incident .
many of their former employers have been sold or closed .
insurance documents may be lost .
and those who oppose claims know that the time is for them , but certainly not with the plaintiffs .
in response , there have been clear new legislation this year that will make it easier for people affected by mesotheliom to claim compensation , even though their former employers are no longer found .
the law has a fund sponsored by the insurance industry of £ 350 million for all those diagnosed after july 2012 , detecting contact with the insurance industry , but not being able to sue anyone .
in such cases , the plaintiffs receive 80 % of what a court would have been able to grant them in a normal compensation process - about £ 120,000 .
about 300 successful applications are expected per year .
andrew morgan thinks like so many mesotheliom sufferers that £ 350 million is a &quot; very good job &quot; of the insurance industry .
&quot; this is a deal of insurers for insurers , &quot; he says , and suggests that this sum is a quarter of what the insurers would have to pay if the time was not running out .
mike penning , then minister of labour and pension , also admitted that the law was &apos; not perfect &apos; .
but both penning and morgan admitted that , with seven deaths a day , rapid action is needed .
&quot; people are suffering so much and need help today , &quot; said penning during the second hearing of the mesotheliom law in december last year .
at that time , graham abbott has been in the hands of prof. loic lang-lazdunski for 19 months .
after their first deliberations , lang-lazdunski recommended an operation , which , unlike tom treasure , was expected to have a positive effect .
this was accompanied by radiation therapy and chemotherapy - a three-fold therapy that enables long-lamination of the skin .
abbott felt stronger .
&quot; that &apos;s the most important thing , &quot; says abbott .
this is something that is seen time and again in patients .
there is something that allows you to continue .
if you give up , you will get worse .
graham abbott underwent operation in march 2012 .
at the end of august he had the last of the six chemotherapy cycles behind him .
after-care scanning showed no signs of the disease .
then i had a scan in march 2014 .
there were several cancer spots around my chest .
i have just been 50 .
this is not life-threatening .
that is a life-long process .
abbott again underwent six chemotherapy cycles .
now there is no trace of tumors .
but the process is physically and psychologically very demanding .
they must think about practical things - about money if i am no longer , for example , or my wife , show how the boiler &apos;s time setting works .
if they receive bad news , they will be negative .
they must look forward .
as father of ellie , 16 , and tamsin , 14 , this is not always easy .
&quot; for parents , this is difficult , &quot; he says .
it is difficult to know what to say and how much .
when i received my first diagnosis , i told my girl that i had a disease that i would not be old with .
they responded very differently .
tamsin is very sociable and inconvenient .
she told her to her friends and we got a lot of calls soon .
ellie was more reluctant .
she did not say much .
such talks are something that all cancer patients must go through .
but for mesotheliologic agents , such talks are not conducted with hope , not with a trace of hope for survival .
the disease ( as in the end also for stephen jay gould ) provides grim security .
as andrew morgan says , &quot; mesotheliom is not life-threatening .

china refuses hong kong to have the right to vote in government , demonstrators swear in retaliation , and protesters swear in retaliation .
on sunday , despite the increasing calls for democratic reforms , the chinese parliament decided against nominating candidates for the 2017 elections by the hong kong electorate .
this is probably the reason for the long-announced protests in hong kong ’ s business district , while activists are making planning and mobilizing for it within hours of the announcement .
the decision of the chinese people ’ s congress basically allows communist leaders to dismiss all non-peking-loyal candidates .
&quot; this is not unexpected , but it makes us angry , &quot; said legal expert emily lau , chairman of the democratic party .
that is not what beijing had promised .
the people of hong kong have been blamed .
and it is clear that we are dealing with an authoritarian regime .
in defending china ’ s decision , li fei , deputy secretary-general of the standing committee of the national people ’ s congress , said that allowing public nominations in hong kong ’ s election would be a “ chaotic ” government .
since 1997 , when britain had regained control of hong kong , beijing has promised to protect its inhabitants from 2017 .
china ’ s leaders presented sunday ’ s decision as a democratic breakthrough , because they offered hong kong citizens a direct right to vote , but the decision also shows that china ’ s leaders need to keep a close watch on the process through a beijing ministerial hand .
under a new clause , only candidates are to be nominated &quot; with love for the country and love for hong kong &quot; .
the decision follows a summer in which some of the largest and most effective protests in hong kong have been held for several years .
behind the pro-democratic campaign in hong kong is the occupy central movement with love and peace , whose organizers have been threatened with losing the financial district .
on sunday evening , within a few hours of the announcement , hundreds of occupy-central-appendices in the rain had been thrown out in front of the hong kong government headquarters .
at the demonstration , the organizers said that their movement would create a new level of civil disobedience , and that they would plan protest waves in the coming weeks .
they did not provide any further details , apparently in order to avoid problems with the authorities .
in an online communication the organizers announced that the movement &quot; the occupation of the central district is only considered as a last means to be an action that can only take place if all dialogue opportunities are exhausted .
we are sorry to say that today all the opportunities for dialogue have been exhausted and that the occupation of the central district will definitely take place .
the hong kong authorities have agreed days ago on beijing &apos;s announcement and there were no more than four days before the government building .
the unrest is caused by the feeling of many in hong kong that they are slowly losing control of their city .
the influx of people from mainland increases competition for products and services .
there is also growing fear that hong kong &apos;s values of democracy and freedom of speech will be reduced to crumbling under growing pressure from beijing .
some criticized the occupy-centre movement ’ s demonstrations , because they had made business – the lifeline of hong kong – dangerous .
&quot; the protests that you talk about could cause great economic damage , depending on how many are involved and how long they last , &quot; said legal expert regine ip , who has been the movement for a long time .
we do not want to raise fears that hong kong will get out of control .
this impression is bad for investment .
china ’ s state-controlled media recently reported about democracy activists in hong kong as being “ hostile to democracy ” by western powers .
this summer , activists organised an unofficial referendum on the electoral rights , involving 780,000 people - more than a fifth of the hong kong electorate .
in july , tens of thousands of people took part in one of the largest democratic demonstrations in the region ’ s history .
the tradition of school leaving balls in the us is now being transferred to universities where freshmen perform on private aircraft .
we are pleased to respond to this demand and to offer the first luxury travel service in the uk for students of today .
to achieve a particularly impressive appearance at the university , the company also offers transport options such as private aircraft , rolls-royce phantom , aston marten or mclaren p1 .
mr stewart also stated that the service has a security section .
this service is an ideal alternative for students who would otherwise have their habitats in a dangerously overloaded car to take the country .
together with our new vif-options , we look forward to ensuring that students reach the university with a minimum of effort and maximum of knowledge of luxury this year .
one company spokesman said that no new bookings have been made , as the service has just been introduced , but added that &quot; students can use the service in the coming weeks &quot; .
the company also announced that despite the tuition fees it has a market for this offer of £ 9,000 per year .
students today differ greatly in their expectations and demands from students 10 , 20 , 30 or 40 years ago - it is more important than ever to make a great first impression , and with vif you can do exactly that .
the national student union , however , criticized the service as being removed .
megan dunn , vice president of the nus for higher education said : &quot; this offer seems to be completely separate from the life of the majority of students .
many students who begin studying this month face a crisis in living costs , as the available financial assistance is available in the form of loans and grants not compatible with the sharply rising bills for the simplest livelihoods .
feminists criticize racial and police behavior after ferguson
the unarmed teenager was killed by a police officer in ferguson , mo , earlier this month .
the participants raised their hands in the air and sang , &quot; hands up , not shoot , &quot; while they waited before the funeral .
after two weeks of protests in ferguson , mo , because of the shooting of the unarmed teenager michael brown , the blogger miriam zoila perez noticed a change in the way .
according to their experience , white feminist commentators put gender before race when it comes to reproductive law and income inequality .
but , while tensions in the middle west increased and received attention throughout the country , perez saw that the responses of white women turned 100 % around the race .
compared to the responses black women shortly after the shots of 9 august , the personal essays with titles such as &quot; thoughts to ferguson of a white woman &quot; and &quot; feminism is not just about the female proportional question .
but for perez , this meant an important change .
&quot; i do not think that feminism can find many people who are above the knowledge and who have privileges in such a high-class way , &quot; she said .
people felt compelled to comment on the incidents .
it is characteristic of the crisis we are in and because the situation in ferguson is so ethnically that you have to express that .
for english professor koritha mitchell of the ohio state university , ferguson highlighted problems that black americans had to face every day , but that are not considered &apos; women &apos;s issues &apos; .
&quot; i can do something funny on facebook about me and my partner and get 150 likes from everywhere , &quot; said mitchell .
if i post something about how coloured people are under siege in their own country , the silence is anathema .
&quot; how can it be safe for women to talk publicly about a relationship , but not about security in public space ? &quot; she asked .
for black women like mitchell , race , sex and sexuality in us history , there are no dialects .
for them , black women did not have the luxury of clearing up the issues ; they live in combined reality every day .
while white women now discuss race and gender in feminist mainstream circles , angela hattery says , professor of gender and gender , &quot; women are the women &apos;s and women &apos;s science at george mason university .
&quot; between 1865 and 1890 , at least 10,000 black men were killed and the rape of a white woman , &quot; said hattery .
white women had to be involved in history to justify the lynch murder .
for hattery , the division between white and black women came at the point where white fighters fought for women ’ s voting rights like susan b. anthony in the late 19th-century , analyzed , and reviewed the country .
&quot; they decided to opt for women &apos;s voting rights and to use the right to vote for black people later , &quot; said hattery .
when you remember such things , you are aware with power why colourful women do not trust white women .
we did not do our job well .
we have never helped black women to protect their husbands and sons .
even after women were given the right to vote in 1920 , it took another decade for white women to resist the lynch in the association of southern woman for the prestige .
the group was created almost 40 years after the original request for help from black women , says mitchell .
for mitchell , the flood of white feminist reactions to the issues raised by ferguson - police behaviour , racial discrimination - is a mirror of the time when white feminists are catching &quot; .
&quot; would it not be great if the activists who have been using such traditional feminist platforms had the right to educate a child as seriously as they did with the right to be receptive ? &quot;
second-generation feminists who have lost their careers in the fight for reproductive rights and access to contraceptive means are now trying to understand what that means .
the famous white feminist activist gloria steiner went to the united states two weeks after the shooting of michael brown on facebook and published a pointed article by rebecca carroll , a magazine published .
&quot; i hope that women who have another but parallel reason to use one inherent in the body can understand - and opinions on the race , which are expressed in public opinion polls - will not see the changes .
although steiner is considered to be a rather intersectional feminism , where racial and gender issues are addressed , some of her comments on racial issues in america are astonishing .
christina sommers , researcher at the american enterprise institute and author of &quot; who stole feminism ? &quot; said she the people , that young men in the united states , especially young farmers , are men , especially young injured .
there are now hundreds of special programmes for girls and young women , but almost nothing for boys .
but when the white house recently launched a small program , my brother &apos;s keeper , to protect vulnerable young black and hispanic men , there were angry reactions from many feminists who were in the middle of the night .
the police relations with the black community are not the only problem that has come to the fore of mainstream feminism .
after nearly 63,000 unaccompanied minors were on the country ’ s southwest border this year , the us border police also raised the issue of immigration reform – this time as a women ’ s issue .
andrea mercado , co-chairman of we belong together , an organization that provides women with the means to reform immigration , said that a reconsideration of the issue would be an essential women &apos;s issue .
&quot; they speak for themselves , &quot; said mercado .
if the vast majority of working visas go to male immigrants , the women who accompany them are in a position where they are responsible for domestic violence and exploitation .
&quot; these stories are found in women &apos;s organisations in a sustainable way , &quot; she said .
&quot; piggy house &quot; in ipswich is for sale in the uk .
the image of a house for sale was removed by property brokers when it became clear that it showed a big pig that made it comfortable in the living room .
the detached house has one bedroom , is located on a private road in ipswich and is offered for 120,000 £ .
details included a picture of the living room - which also includes a pig , that had his head on a sofa bed .
real estate agents connells said that the pig on the photo was the owner &apos;s pet .
&quot; the photo was published in error and has now been removed &quot; said a spokeswoman of the company .
in the exposure of the house , connells described the former assembly house as a &quot; unique one-family house with one bedroom &quot; .
although the broker has removed the image from the website , it still appears on advertising material .
the house sale has attracted interest in the social media when some asked whether the pig was included in the purchase price .
the town of sw harvey has a new millionaire after lottery win .
a harvey lottery player is on the move this month .
the search for a new millionaire in the southwest of perth continues , with a happy winner who has been drawn from the lottery on saturday almost $ 1.1 million .
a newspaper kiosk in harvey attracted the jackpot in the drawing for the second time in five years , after 1 million $ in november 2009 .
the lucky winner will have to report .
the shopkeeper steve forward said that the profit provides for the talk in the small town in the southwest of perth .
the city talks about nothing else , and all are quite excited .
we thought that such a gain could come .
eight wa winners made prizes in the first division last month , a qualifying deal for a few happy weeks for the players in the state .
last week , a player from canning vale was one of the five millionaires in august , after a couple from belmont just a few weeks earlier had achieved the mega gain of $ 7.5 million .
the winning couple had been playing for twenty years and said that the profit allows them the possibility of a world trip and the purchase of a new house .
the millionaire from harvey is the 59th winner of the first division in the wa this year , with a total of almost $ 85 million .
leonidas asked the gladiatore arena for a visit to the city of gladesh .
not only the gladiators were standing ankle deep in the matsch at the first rhinebacher römertag in the amusement park .
but the attraction of the event was strong enough to attract more than 1000 visitors yesterday who were able to see the rainshowers and the autumn cold and to feel the historical spectacle .
there was a colorful series of representations , performances , games , exhibits and information about the times of the romans and their importance to the rhineland .
the main attraction of the day was undoubtedly the martialistic fighter force from the gladiator school &quot; amor mortis &quot; , which had every rainbreak to play in the soft sand .
gladiator owner &quot; leonidas &quot; proved to be a humorous and expert presenter and sent one after another his men to the ring of heroic double fight in various gladiator ensembles .
first , the &quot; provocateurs &quot; were on the row with rectangular shield and short sword as well as leg rail on the left leg and armrail on the right arm .
the essedarii followed with a breast shield , short sword and a litter lance and iron gladiator helmet , leg and arm protection .
the appearance of the &quot; retiarius &quot; , which was made with a network of throats , trizack and dolch against the &quot; secutor &quot; , was particularly impressive and after a short fight the boys came to the ground .
the swords are metallic , the shields of shepherds and the litter lances flew through the arena that a fear and bang would be able to be around the health of glaatorial people .
but on them had the imposing &quot; summa rudis &quot; , the muscular referee , a constantly attentive eye .
&quot; we wanted to revive the everyday life of rome and experience the culture of the roman era , &quot; explains lorenz euskirchen , chairman of the organizer &quot; freundeskreis rötention rötenchannel &quot; , the channel .
after two years of preparation , the theme park was turned into a &quot; oppidum romanum &quot; , a roman city , as vice mayor claus wehage in his greeting .
after all , the romans have not only brought war and conquest in our region , but also the roman culture and numerous buildings that we admire today .
the remains of these were also to be admired at the roman day , such as &quot; aqueduct marble &quot; from the eleven meter high and 1400 meter long roman canal bridge , which was used by luftelberg .
the frontinus society once and now confronted the water and energy supply , and ceo petra fricke knew : &quot; we are still taking advantage of the knowledge of those days &quot; .
this is confirmed by diplom-surveying engineer ralph heiliger from the &quot; team team two engineers &quot; from rheinbach , the tools of surveying the romans such as chorobat , groma or dioptra .
the roman villa in blankenheim presented sketches and models from the excavations of anno 1894 and brick stones from the original hypocautious , the hot air heizer , which once used to heat the mröte .
the footprints that were taken by wolf and fox two millennia ago in the footsteps of clay were impressive , before they were burned .
in 2011 , the landesverband rheinland office for the conservation of the landesverband rhineland had issued the remains of a roman villa in the north industrial park in rheinbach .
the walls of an economic building with a darre were used to dry grain and to mill .
the building probably had to be a villa rustica , an agricultural estate , explained the archaeologist dr. jennifer morschiser .
a number of finds from these excavations depicted them in a glass cabinet , including a large plate , several fine glass vessels and parts of a small necklace .
the villa was probably built from the first to the fourth century ad , until the arrival of germans in the then roman rhineland , morschiser suspects .
it also involved the children with the roman windmill game , similar to today &apos;s mill game , or they wrote the same as the roman students used to write their names with wax metal handles .
at the stand of the römerthermen zülpich , the children were allowed to lay mosaics themselves , at the stand of the glass museum rheinbach glass mosaics and to build a new building at the eifel weizhle weizmühle weizenheim .
the chill of the original , drawn by two cold-blütters , was reproduced in the same way , and visitors were able to travel through the amusement park and also pass the impressive booth of the city gymnasium &quot; .
the romans ’ week , which will take place from 13th to 21st september , will also take place in the rhineland-wide rhineland-palatinate in 2014 , which is to remind of the death of emperor augustus 2000 .
together with the local and historical associations and the wachtberg hiking association , the association of partners and the entertainment society of the amateur oberbachem , thematic hikes , lectures , cooking evenings and other activities are offered .
for example , a roman legionnaire is exempted from his work on the nearby wachtberg , treating plants as living monuments from the roman era and teaching a witty lesson in international understanding .
the adendorf primary school is dedicated to the roman theme as part of a project week .
the romans &apos; week is intended to bring together the numerous , but often no longer visible , traces of the romans in wachtberg .
the wachtberg town hall offers a small presentation to the finds of the berkumer matronenheiligum in 1879 .
ebola : the epidemic is burdening west africa ’ s economy
the ebola epidemic in west africa is also a serious blow to the economy .
markets are orphaned - and international companies are distancing themselves .
the devastating ebola epidemic is causing a serious blow to the economy of west africa .
the harvest is rotting in the fields that are abandoned and the markets are orphaned - the virus has seriously inflicted on the region .
some international companies are already moving away .
&quot; the ebola epidemic is not only a medical crisis , but also an economic one , &quot; the head of the african development bank , donald kaberuka , judges .
liberia is hardest hit
&quot; it is a total disaster , we are losing a great deal of money , &quot; says alhaji bamogo , who is on the second largest market in liberia &apos;s capital , monrovia clothing .
only those who produce food or disinfection with ebola will come onto the market .
liberia has been hit hardest by the virus , alone here has fallen the fever more than 600 people .
recently , health authorities declared that the disease had penetrated every corner of the country .
in guinea , sierra leone and nigeria , the virus has spread .
in total , more than 1500 people died , thousands more died .
foreign companies are recruiting employees from abroad
throughout resource-rich countries , firms are running out .
foreign companies such as the steel group arcelor mittal are withdrawing their employees , several international airlines are no longer flying to the affected regions .
local dealers and farmers also respond : few merchants still leave their homes to buy supplies .
in some areas of sierra leone and liberia , which are undergoing quarantine , the costs of export of cacao and coffee are becoming extinct on the fields , among other things .
farmers dare not dare to leave their homes for harvesting .
food is scarce ;
&quot; people will travel less and less &quot; , says phillipe de vreyer , paris expert for west africa &apos;s economy .
for example , the man who normally goes to the market and sells his vegetables remains at home .
the population therefore receives the consequences of the epidemic directly and urgently : food is becoming scarce .
in the markets , stocks of basic foodstuffs such as rice are dwindling .
at the same time , the region heavily dependent on international firms is threatening to damage its image , with far-reaching consequences .
the greatest danger is that international companies will , in principle , avoid the area for a long time , says philippe hugon of the french think tank iris .
the decisive factor is how far and how long the virus will spread .
investors might get the impression that &apos; it is dangerous to have a market in guinea , sierra leone and liberia and thus to invest &apos; , hugon warns .
the disease also burdens the hard-pressed state budgets of states
the disease also burdens the already hard-pressed state budgets of the states concerned .
the rating agency moody &apos;s fears that its budgets will be heavily dependent on the high spending on the health system and , in addition , on the worsening economy .
the african development bank has already promised to provide eur 60 million ( 45 million ) to the health systems of the countries concerned .
the effects are also being felt in nigeria , where so far few ebola cases have been diagnosed .
although the oil-rich region in the southern niger delta has not yet been affected .
but elsewhere , many people are already left at home for fear of contagion .
reservations in hotels are also falling sharply .
protect your 50th anniversary celebration
the swiss federation of the &quot; tannenwald &quot; berngau celebrates its 50th anniversary from 12 to 14 september .
the schüttenverein tannenwald is on top of the list of the preparations for the 50-year anniversary of the founding of the festival from 12 to 14 september .
the plan is to hold a big evening of entertainment with the group &quot; dorfrocker &quot; on friday , september 12 .
on saturday at 6 p.m. the big böllershooting is taking place .
the large party is followed by the &quot; stoapfalzer spitzbuam &quot; .
braskapelle provides music and the music
highlights on sunday are the festival service and 9.30 am in the parish church and the large feast at 2 pm .
in the afternoon , the distribution of the prize for the federal and gause-shooting is also possible .
a particularly beautiful sight will be the 25 ladies with their dirndln .
the chapel is the brascapelle berngau .
the patronage has been given to mayor wolfgang wild and secretary of state albert füracker .
the original term &quot; schützengesellschaft tannenwald berngau &quot; dates from 1907 , when the association was invited to &quot; social entertainment by means of exercise in carpentry and small caliber shooting &quot; on march 21 .
the nazi regime had led the dissolution of the association in 1937 .
only in 1964 did 19 young men find themselves again , who on april 30 in the guesthouse lukas found the &quot; new &quot; shooting-club &quot; tannenwald &quot; berngau from baptism .
karl march and adolf ried lead the association as a protector through a difficult early period in which it was primarily a matter of establishing a club and of supporting the shooting operation .
the schützenverein started its activities in the &quot; leininger &quot; inn in autumn 1965 with two teams in the runde competitions .
in the following years , the snipers , who were now organized in seven teams , established themselves in all classes , right up to the 1st gauliga .
the club records are held every year and the magical border of 380 rings was first documented by rudi meier in 1980 .
just as the performance of active shooters has increased , the number of members has also improved .
after the club &apos;s &quot; leininger &quot; no longer meets the demands of a modern shooters club , the former board of directors has decided to renew their efforts under the leadership of johann rinn .
after a work of 2700 hours , gary granted a grant of € 5,000,000 for the new protective rooms on 8 may 1988 .
one of the great highlights in the history of the club was certainly the 44th gaustießen , combined with the solemn consecration of the new shooters &apos; flag in july 1991 .
on 23 and 24 april 1994 , the shooter association celebrated its 30th anniversary .
in 1995 a group of böllers was founded .
josef schmalzl was böllerreber ’ s referee .
a big challenge for the &quot; more böllere &quot; and for the association as a whole was the orientation of the bavarian böllertreffen 2005 .
in many hours of volunteering , the club members last year set up the rooms and the shooting facility at the berngau hof , thus updating the latest state of the art .
eleven teams in roundmatches
the sport performance of the schützenverein can also be seen .
altogether , eleven teams are currently competing in the round competitions : six rifle teams , one air gun team , one sports gun kk1 , one youth and two ah-h teams .
the 1st team with lars ellrich , katharina ellrich , steffi grad and kerstin kellermann was defeated by the gauoberliga in round 2013 / 14 ( highest league ) in the schützengau .
the second team with verena moosburger alexandra meier , eva schuhmann and tobias graml was transferred from the gauliga nord to the gauoberliga .
besides shooting , events such as bock-balls , carnival and royal ball , club outing and christmas party have a long tradition .
the shooters are also present at the festivals in parish and parish .
tony stewart suffers accident when returning to the race track .
tony stewart &apos;s return to the race track ended about half way through his race on the atlanta motor speedway .
stewart was going against the wall for the second time after his right front tire burst into round 172 and finished his evening .
stewart drove his damaged car into the garage and left it without talking to journalists .
his team leader chad johnston said his 14-member team was disappointed , concentrated on the new team and the team will be in richmond , virginia next weekend .
&quot; i wish we had a better commitment and a better result for him , &quot; johnston said .
we are going to richmond and hope we can do better there .
stewart already drove earlier in the race on sunday evening after a collision with kyle busch into a wall and had to repair the right side of his car .
&quot; i have good hopes for a good result today , &quot; johnston and added , &quot; i am not afraid .
not long after the second accident , stewart &apos;s car was loaded into the trailer and the team had packed and ready to leave .
stewart had three nascar sprint cup races to finish after his car had taken another driver in an ashtray race in the north of the state of new york and killed .
he decided to return this week and to return either to atlanta or at the next race in richmond to find a place in the persecution .
he returned to his job , while an investigation into the tragic incident that led to the death of kevin ward jr. was investigated , which had been on the road during a race to be stewart .
on friday , the authorities announced that the investigation into the cause of the accident would continue for at least two weeks .
no decision has yet been taken as to whether stewart should face charges .
the triple champion was received with great applause when he was presented before the race .
after starting at 12th position , stewart had been in the first 10 shortly afterwards and was temporarily placed in fourth place .
after a restart in round 122 , busch and his team moved to the top of the league in round 122 , busch and busch hit the ball .
take no . 18 out of control after the exit from curve 2 and collided with stewart , both cars drove against the wall .
stewart continued , but fell to number 21 .

after serious battles , which supposedly involve russian tank battalions , the ukrainian army today , monday , opened the rebel stronghold of luhansk .
the army also announced that seven soldiers have been killed in the past 24 hours .
ukrainian president petro poroshenko had previously had personal consequences from the severe defeat of his army in the fight against separatists and had announced changes in the supreme army leadership without details .
prorussian separatists shot aeroplane off

nato does not want to break agreements with russia
nato is being undermined by the planned stationing in eastern europe following the ukrainian crisis .
nato secretary general anders fogh rasmussen said in brussels on monday that nato is following the nato &apos;s founding agreement of the 1997 nato russia council .
nato ’ s chief , however , accused russia of &quot; a gross breach &quot; of the agreement .
&quot; today we have to face up to reality that russia does not regard nato as a partner , &quot; rasmussen said .
documents and statements from the russian side suggest that &apos; you see us as opponents &apos; .
stronger nato presence
rasmussen also announced that nato &apos;s presence in eastern europe would be strengthened .
one decision to be taken at the nato summit in wales on readiness action plan will ensure that &apos; we have more visible nato presence in the east , as long as that is necessary &apos; , rasmussen said on monday .
kiev and moscow are agreed on new gas talks
russia and ukraine have officially agreed to new talks to settle their gas dispute .
the negotiations are scheduled for next saturday , said russian energy minister alexander nowak on monday .
there is still a wait for a decision by the european union to be taken by a representative to the talks .

last but not least , eu energy commissioner günther oettinger had mediated between both sides .
ukraine had warned that russia could also cut off gas supplies for europe .
europe is responsible for about one third of its gas coming from russian sources , much of which flows through ukraine .
merkel speaks of power : toll will come &quot; clearly &quot;
now the chancellor is once again clearly committed to this .
a licence for all the complicated details is not .
persistent cdu misgivings about car tolls have been on the csu ’ s side .
chancellor angela merkel has asked the council to withdraw from its cdu , following persistent resistance , a word of power , for the introduction of a toll on cars .
&quot; to put it quite clearly , it is in the coalition agreement and it will come , &quot; said the party leader on monday after meetings of the cdu top bodies in berlin .
merkel , however , did not commit to a detailed model for the time being .
the black-red government programme calls for &apos; specific parameters &apos; .
federal minister of transport alexander dobrindt ( csu ) has made a proposal and is now working on it &apos; .
the nrw-cdu , however , insists on its &apos; no &apos; to a toll equal to all roads .
merkel emphasized that finance minister wolfgang schäuble ( cdu ) also contributed constructively to the deliberations on a bill .
beyond the issue , he has also talked with dobrindt about other ways of enabling more private capital for infrastructure investment , for example in broadband expansion .
&quot; there &apos;s nothing special about it &quot; .
csu chef horst seehofer warned against being in the cabinet of toll concepts against the minister responsible .
cdu bundesvize armin laschet reaffirmed his objections .
&quot; the coalition treaty never assumed that all county and federal roads would be chartered , &quot; said the north rhine-westphalian cdu country leader .
in this respect , it would be an important signal that sea hofer has now announced that it will be discussing the issue again .
resistance to the plans is also being expressed by the german federal government associations baden-württemberg and rhineland-palatinate .
the background is fears that a toll would affect small border traffic to neighbouring countries .
the sea hofer had been forced to leave the cdu coalition fidelity because of toll criticism .
the left sees the plans as weakened in the light of the dispute in the union .
&quot; the murks-toll is dead , &quot; said party leader bernd riexinger of the &quot; new osnabrücker zeitung &quot; ( monday ) .
&quot; the minister &apos;s toll fails &quot; . dobrindt wants to impose a vignette duty on all german roads , which is due to start in 2016 .
domestic car owners , however , are not to be charged any additional charges under the coalition agreement .
therefore , they should be able to make full compensation for tolls through the car tax .
the model , however , must not discriminate against foreign drivers on account of their nationality , in accordance with eu law .
genetic disorder often misdiagnosed
a british says she thought she had been diagnosed for many years as dying .
karin rodgers lived almost all her youth in the belief that she only had a few years to live after diagnosing another disease .
it was in fact suffering from the charcot marie tooth disease ( cmt ) - a group of inherited disorders that caused nerves outside the brain and spinal cord .
charity cmt uk announced that misdiagnoses are a common problem for people with cmt because so little is known about this disease .
some 23,000 people in britain are likely to suffer from cmt , which can cause motor disorders such as muscle weakness , an uncertain course , and crumbled toes .
sufferers also suffer from taubseness or pain .
when rodgers was 13 , she believed that she had been involved in friedrich ataxie ( fa ) - a disease with very poor survival chances .
rodgers thought she would be in a wheelchair before she would be 18 , and die before her 30th birthday .
the mother of two children , who is 51 today , said : &quot; as a child i knew i could not do the same as the other .
i was constantly falling and everything took longer .
i could never have scored with other children roller skateboard or roller skateboard and was often in school because of my way to go and walk .
rodgers said that at the age of 13 , after several operations to relieve their achilles and stretch their feet , they took on a medical mission when their doctor left the room and read that they had gone to the hospital .
&quot; i felt guilty because i was curious , so i did not blame anyone .
when i received an answer , i was shocked and terribly panicked .
i thought i was going to be in a wheelchair with 18 and die at 25 , and in between all my abilities would slowly lose .
i did all this with me alone and planned my own funeral .
she said when she became 17 , she realized that her skills had not decreased as much as she had imagined and asked her doctor .
he stood up and hugged me and said , &quot; my love , i do not think you have that , otherwise you are already in a wheelchair . &quot;
i think you have something far less life-threatening .
after some genetic tests , cmt was detected .
&quot; when he explained to me what cmt was , i felt as if i were a winner , &quot; she said .
charity cmt uk has a cmt-awareness month to work on this disease .
stabsfeldwebel a. d. berni diether has been working since the closure of the former troop training place as a firefighter since the closure of the former training place as a firefighter .

government taxes increased more than local taxes , by 4.3 % , according to the study published by the service agency .
more than half of the district ’ s tax revenues , 56 percent , are corporate taxes , while 36 percent of maryland ’ s revenues come from businesses .
virginia generates the lowest tax revenue from companies at 28 percent .
much of the increase in tax revenues is due to a recovery in corporate real estate values , say the researchers , which leads to an increase in property taxes of 3.7 % this year after the three successive years of growth rates of 1 % with growth .
while much of these gains come from large states , such as california , new york , and texas , the process also appears to be true for the washington area .
companies in the district , maryland and virginia jointly paid more than $ 10 billion in government and local property taxes last year , compared to $ 9.6 billion in 2012 – an increase of 4.2 % over the course of a year .
but the apparent recovery in property values is not so effective in maryland in raising government and local tax revenues , as housing taxes are close to more than a fifth of the tax revenues of companies .
companies in virginia and d.c. pay almost half of their state and local taxes in the form of property taxes .
&quot; in maryland , the following happens : a large proportion of the real estate , especially in the tax area around the d.c. , is owned either by the government or non-profit organizations that do not pay property taxes , &quot; said douglas lindm lindholm .
maryland is therefore forced to focus much more on income taxes , for example , in order to be able to provide the same services that other states offer .
the recent recovery in corporate tax revenues cannot be attributed solely to the recovery of the housing market .
corporate revenues also seem to be recovering , according to data .
companies in the region reported income taxes to state organizations of $ 2.3 billion , compared to $ 2.1 billion in 2012 .
maryland took $ 1 billion in corporate income taxes , the highest amount in the region .
while the trend is moving in the same direction , the local tax burden on companies is not increasing evenly in all three places .
the district ’ s growth rate was 4.3 % , up from the national average , while maryland ’ s rise was significantly higher , reaching 4.9 % .
only virginia reported an under-average tax revenue of 4.1 percent .
virginia has a significantly lower corporate income , accounting for 6 % in all three areas of government ( all three have firm corporate tax rates ) .
maryland &apos;s corporate tax rate is 8.25 percent and the district is relatively high at 9.975 percent .
a comparable study by the us chamber of commerce at the beginning of this year showed that lower government and local corporate taxes are required in virginia , and overall there is a better tax climate than in maryland .
the study did not examine the district .
despite the advantages virginia is under pressure from its southern neighbour .
north carolina has laws to reduce its corporate tax rates this year from 6.9 % to 6 % , the same rate as virginia , and the rate will rise to 5 % next year .
if the state continues to achieve its income targets in the coming year , this law could raise the state ’ s corporate income tax rate to 3 % by 2017 .
meanwhile , small businesses in the washington area seem to be doing better , and they therefore pay more state and local taxes , according to the recent study .
corporate taxes , which are paid as personal income taxes by small businessmen - a transitional structure that organizes most small enterprises - in the district , maryland , and virginia increased by 20 % last year by $ 2.4 billion , down .
researchers say that the trend and rise in corporate taxes is likely to be higher throughout the country this year , with an increase in the general revenue from the national and national multi-defense taxes increasing by 6.2 % .
yet the washington area could lag behind if the federal government ’ s spending cut had had an impact on the region ’ s labor market .
partner city : german beer for guangzhou
hops and malt - also a popular combination in china .
german beer has an excellent reputation in china .
frankfurt ’ s partner city in china now wants a brewery and also hopes for direct flight connections between the two cities .
german beer , brewed in frankfurt ’ s partner city of guangzhou - that is the urgent wish of the officials in china .
&quot; we would be delighted if a german brewery would settle in our city , &quot; said the vice-party secretary of the south china metropolis , li yiwei , this week , when visiting a spd delegation .
time and again , the chinese communist party ’ s official came to this concern of the 12-million metre metropolis during the conversation .
guangzhou , also known as canton in germany , is one of china &apos;s richest cities , warned li .
that is why people also had the purchasing power to afford german beer .
the german socialist party , thorsten schäfer-gümbel , who led the german political delegation , has told the host that he will look for a possible partner for the project in germany .
&quot; for beer , it doesn &apos;t take much : good water , grain and joy of life , &quot; he added at lunch with the party top in guangzhou .
mr li is already excited about this joy of life , and he flatters the host .
the functionalist from guangzhou then came up with schäfer gümbel - albeit with red wine , which was served to the food .
the chinese brand tsingtao is based on german brewing art .
tsingtao beer is produced according to the german purity law .
more business
a second wish of china ’ s hosts would be a direct flight connection between frankfurt and guangzhou , said vice party leader li .
lufthansa had offered the flight earlier , but in 2012 , for economic reasons , it was cancelled .
&quot; it would be worth it again , &quot; the local politician showed himself convinced .
&quot; business traffic between our two cities is growing . &quot;
currently , travellers would have to travel the way across changsha in hunan province , li complained .
the guangdong province &apos;s administration , the capital of which is guangzhou , also hopes for the flight connection .
the vice-governor of the province , chen yunxian , expressed this wish in his conversation with the social democrats .
&quot; this is a very good idea , &quot; said schäfer-gumbel - chinese vice minister li jinjun , an intimate german expert , nodded in agreement .
well-maintained partnership
the likened vice-leader of guangzhou hopes that he will be able to make frankfurt a partnership meeting next year .
li yiwei was already in the main , but not yet in this function .
he came into office only this year after his predecessor was expelled from office for charges of corruption .
the local leader wan qinglian had to go .
the action against guangzhou officials is part of a nationwide campaign against corruption in the party and administration , led by the leader of xi jinping .
the new leader li yiwei had argued for an american company before his party career , which is highly unusual in the chinese communist party .
before taking office in guangzhou , he was a leading official in fujian , where the car manufacturer vw had built a large factory .
frankfurt is officially more than a dozen town-twinning partnerships .
the connection to the 9000 km distance of guangzhou is one of those who are maintained by both sides , for example with a student exchange .
last year , the 25-year anniversary of the german-chinese connection was celebrated .
the south china metropolis on the perl river is almost as strong as the whole of hessen with its economic power .
next year , it intends to generate a gross domestic product of eur 250 billion , li reported .
the family of joan rivers &quot; pushes the thumbs &quot;
joan rivers has been in hospital in new york city three days ago , and her daughter showed herself to be hopeless , that the 81-year-old comic woman had been able to recover from her illness .
&quot; thanks for your continued love and support , &quot; melissa rivers said today in a message .
we are all keeping our fingers crossed .
her mother was reportedly released on thursday after an emergency for heart failure at a clinic on upper east side , yorkville endoscopy , to mount side .
doctors deliberately seded them and under close observation until they satisfied with their condition , which continues to be considered &quot; serious &quot; .
the reactions came from many sides , including in the form of an overwhelming online support from donald trump , montel williams and kelly ripa .
environmentally friendly vacuum cleaners and rising wages
for cars and vacuum cleaners , which are entering the market from today , stricter environmental standards will apply in the future .
similar to refrigerators and washing machines , new vacuum cleaners are delivered from september 1 to a label where the buyer can see at a glance key data such as the energy efficiency of the appliance .
new cars are in the pollutant class &quot; euro 6 &quot; stricter nitrogen oxide values .
there is also more money for scaffolders : they receive a nationwide minimum wage of eur 10.25 .
amazon buys twitch for $ 1.04 billion
amazon just confirmed what information had reported on monday morning : the online retailer - and video producer , and a lot of other things - buys the video streaming service twitch for $ 1.04 billion ( $ 970 billion ) .
the announcement comes as a surprise , not because no one expected to take twitch , but because it was widely believed that youtube would acquire the company .
three months ago , it seemed that selling twitch to the google video service for a cool billion was decided .
twitch , who only three years ago was founded as justin.tv , was launched as a general streaming service - a live version of youtube .
instead , it quickly became a platform for players who released their bravura pieces in games , a &quot; youtube for live games &quot; , so an insider .
the twitch interface .
and &quot; let &apos;s play &quot; , a video genre in which better knowledge can be used to play a paint of mystery theory theatre .
it is the case that youtube is often called when you describe twitch , so the message that youtube is using twitch was written in the language .
it is a mystery why the deal with youtube did not come about , because the company was reportedly ready to pay as much as amazon .
all we know about this at the moment is that statement by emmet shear , president of twitch : &quot; we have chosen amazon because you believe in our community , you share our values and long-term vision .
another mystery , to be honest , is the incredible success of twitch .
for snobs like me who explain that they prefer to do sports than watch it , it is difficult to understand the attraction that assumes to be watching others while playing , rather than even watching the console .
it is one thing to tell a friend about his shoulder at 3 a.m. while resident evil schleicht , and something quite different , a spinner .
all these games you could watch right now .
another problem is that many of the most popular games are ego games today , so watching can be done without having control of the perspective , a really good recipe for headache .
i admit that the rapid transit routes in which roger bannister of our electronic age plays whole games in record time are not going to be entertaining .
but until a game or humor virtuosis is included , its twitch channel is probably not so interesting .
but what do skeptics like me know about it ?
twitch is called by 55 million different visitors per month and is the fourth largest source of internet traffic peaks .
and how exactly does amazon want to make money out of it ?
it is hard to imagine that twitch is so elegant in amazon instant video , as youtube twitch simply would have swallowed .
but twitch has something every company would like : thousands of young men who advertise as advertising customers .
as the chairman of twitch , shear , said , amazon and twitch &quot; both believe in the future of gaming , &quot; and the medium shows no signs of shrinking , not even even - even if not .
at the hüpfburg at the burggartenfest , there was a lot of fun on saturday .
the organiser ’ s concept was right .
despite the heavy rain casting on saturday evening , an estimated 1200 music fans came to the open-air festival in the burggarten .
at times , the entrance had to be stopped .
&quot; that was annoying , &quot; said ron sem , one of the organizers .
salwedel l light and fun .
maxim saxraj and ron sem have taken the name amula from two spanish words .
the open air in the saltwedeler burggarten is intended to provide a bright day and evening through various shows .
well , and the fun comes from your own .
this was evident early on saturday when the first visitors to the open air .
the organizers promised a party for all generations .
and they have succeeded .
around the supply stands on the burggartenwiese it had become saltwater , but also guests from the nearby and other surroundings .
they followed the first live performances , wiped with the foot in the clock , enjoyed cool drinks - in short : pure relaxation and enjoyment were the order of the day .
and the way through the generations .
while some people are sitting on the blankets on the extra carved white sand at the beach bar , others are enjoying a quarter of wine in the vinotheque , the young were raging on the hüpfburg .
but even when it comes to children &apos;s makeup , volunteers have had to do their best to meet the needs of the children and to get creative creations into the small faces .
the larger ones used the kicker tables or participated in a skateboard workshop that the goodfoot crew of salzufledel arranged .
until the big rain came .
just before 5.30 p.m. he cracked down on the visitors , mainly families looking for the wide and dry .
but the attractiveness of the festival did not break away .
&quot; more people came than expected , &quot; ron sem said , who talks of a &quot; success all along the line &quot; .
that is why we are not in any way opposed to a repeat of the great party next year .
although the content and size of the event still have to be worked out , sem made a first record of sunday in front of the popular vote .
he was annoying to say that in the meantime the admission had to be stopped .
obviously , the security company had been booked with too little power .
the consequence : some who had already paid did not get on the ground .
the resonance was very good .
in a first cautious estimate , the salzufledeler co-organizer spoke of about 1200 visitors who had their time in the castle garden .
there were problems with sound technology .
the saltwater hip hop band blocks`n`rox broke their performance with nerve .
the technicians were unable to produce a reasonably reasonable sound .
the planned shisha lounges could not be built because the tents were not ready to go to salvedel due to a tire pan .
&quot; next year you will be there &quot; , says the organizer .
the premiere of the amula-open-air was more than successful from the number of visitors .
and that in bad weather .
however , the organisers made some mistakes which will be delayed the first time , but in the second edition they will have to be eliminated .
also in the social network facebook the organizers must include criticism .
&quot; sorry , but for twelve euros you just expected more , &quot; says melanie meier on the event page .
&quot; you &apos;ve taken over a bit , &quot; says ele zimmermann in the same place .
others do not see the initial problems as closely as they were .
i think it is very good that some people are not just stupid , but are actually trying to put something on their feet .
hut off ! &quot; , stephanie jenß writes to amula .
now the organisers have one year to clear up these criticisms .
new radom in berkum : wachtberg ’ s landmark is shrinking .
that is not what we expect .
instead , the part is waiting to be put into the distinctive structure .
the action is in the context of a larger measure : almost 50 years after the establishment of the tira space observation radar , the cover , the so-called radom , is completely renewed .
the new radom is equipped with a diameter of 47.5 meters a little smaller than the old one .
the size remains a world record , however .
the last step to complete the new cover is capping sharing .
the upper quarter of the old hull is separated and taken with a crane .
the last quarter of the new cover will be added .
if the weather is included , the action will take place at the beginning of this week .
participants in the ice bucket-challenge will be able to break the jaw and the jaw .
isabelle roberts from the uk shouted so much when her cold water was cast over her head that she had to change the bone structure of her face .
this ice-bucket-challenge went painfully beyond that .
a woman was brought to the hospital after she had been taken to the ice bucket challenge so much that she had to face the jaw .
isabelle roberts from the uk made a comeback when her cold water was poured over her head , that she had to change her face structure .
&quot; the water was so cold that i shouted , and while i did , my jaw remained simply standing , &quot; she said to the mirror .
ice water is being shaken over the 20-year-old .
isabelle roberts a few seconds before the accident .
i wanted to close my mouth , but that did not go , the jaw was hated , and then i understood that something was wrong .
my mother and sister saw this as well and made laughing almost into their pants , but i had to go into the emergency .
the 20-year-old from britain was brought to the hospital to get the jaw back after taking part in the viral trend on tuesday .
the clip has become a web slot and a thousand times over on facebook and twitter .
the castle clubs will soon be pulling together again ?
finally , there was a constant dispute between the two wolfratshausen burgvereines .
now the boards are thinking about possible cooperation .
as a model for the reconstruction of the wolfratshauser castle , the late richard dimbath , former chairman of the wolfratshauser burgfreunde , led the project in the french guédelon .
a year ago , the burgverein and the friends of burgundy had no good climate .
the positions on how history of the wolfratshauser castle and a possible reconstruction have seemed to be very different .
now the two camps are moving towards one another : talks are to be held soon on a common approach .
the association ’ s board of directors torsten sjöberg ( burgverein ) and herbert piffl ( friends of burgundy ) confirm this on the request of our newspaper .
&quot; i called mr piffl and suggested that we could sit down together once , &quot; says sjöberg .
he said that all members of both clubs could now be in the same vein again .
this is a quick and visible achievement .
while the friends of the castle are concerned about richard dimbath , who died suddenly , until the very last reconstruction of the castle at the mountain forest , the castle club around sjöberg stands for &quot; the discovery and experience of the barge &quot; .
herbert piffl , second chairman of burgfreunde , has been delighted with the call according to his own information .
since dimbad &apos;s death , he has been a front for his friends in the castle .
a new chairman is to be found in a members &apos; meeting in mid-september .
at the moment , according to the 74-year-old , the association counts about 40 members .
&quot; after the death of my friend richard dimbath , we have taken over the association &apos;s activities out of respect first &quot; , which &quot; period of reflection &quot; was necessary to &quot; consider &quot; how to proceed .
according to piffl , the new chairman is to enter into talks with the burgverein .
until then , friends of the castle could also have a picture of the mood within their group .
there is not yet a candidate for the presidency , says piffl .
&quot; but i &apos;m confident that someone will find themselves &quot; , he does not want to stand for himself because he is resident in bad tölz .
the new leader should be a wolfratshauser .
the tölzer want to participate in the project &quot; but very happy to continue working &quot; .
the different positions on reconstruction are likely to be seen in piffls in the near future .
he recognises dimbath as a missionary who has always believed in the reconstruction of the castle .
two similar projects , already well advanced in austria and france , would show that this idea is not a pipe dream .
through a high level of participation by the population and volunteers from all over the world , they are a tourist magnet .
piffl : &quot; i too was sceptical at the beginning .
but over time i have become more and more convinced that it is useful to move the project forward &quot; , which could be a &quot; stand-alone &quot; feature for the fluffy city .
there is nothing else .
moreover , the project would be supported by eu grants , visitor tickets and potential sponsors , piffl believes .
&quot; i personally do not want to throw away the idea of reconstruction , &quot; he hopes that the burgverein will perhaps move in this respect .
their goal of documenting history is important and good .
we could then look further .
clever ways to save with university textbooks
since the cost of university textbooks for many students is more than $ 1,000 per year , the second semester student has considered matt schroeder a clever sparide idea .
he invented a loan system for books of higher semester students and offered nominal compensation to help the resale .
&quot; my mathematics book usually costs $ 180 , but i got it for $ 10 for a semester and a chick-fil-a-keks , &quot; said schroeder , 19 , who put the covenant .
the books needed for the last semester would have cost him $ 430 , he said .
he gave $ 120 .
the college was informed that the students had more than 1,200 $ per year for textbooks and study material , and that they had no choice but to pay various costs for the students .
online shops and creative approaches such as the schroeders are increasingly the solution for students .
the rental of textbooks is becoming more popular , and students can use a book for a semester , often at a much cheaper price than buying .
neebo inc , which has more than 250 university bookshops , announced that the rental of text books is not a matter of doubt since 2011 .
polls in the industry show that about a quarter of books are published in college bookshops in the last spring semester , said neebos vice president tevor meyer .
less than half of all textbooks are published according to the trade association national association of college stores in campus bookshops .
here is the one-time deal for the best deals .
buy online
some new books cost online only one-third of the price you have at the campus bookshop .
the ninth issue of &quot; calculus &quot; vno ron larwon , bruce edwards and robert hostetler costs nearly $ 290 , but can be ordered from the specialized textbook retailer , chegg.com .
used buy
if you need to read the notes of other or normal usage tracks , you can find used books as a good option .
&quot; calculus &quot; is used on chegg.com for $ 93.49 .
matt casagay , 25 , graduate student at brigham young university , says that he is 42 centimeters on amazon.com for a used issue of &quot; strategic media decis &quot; .
the book was sold for $ 48 .
academics such as ingrid bracey , head of the university of massachusetts at amherst college without walls recommended students to study at their professors who are not familiar with past editions .
sometimes the updates for the seminar work are not relevant .
in such cases , older expenses can often be spent for a fraction of the cost of the latest issue .
apart from chegg and amazon , half.com is a popular alternative for used books .
rent a car , rent a car , rent a car , rent a car , rent a car , rent a car , rent a car , rent a car , rent a car , rent a car , rent a car , rent a car , ...
the rental of textbooks is worth considering if you can treat them fairly well , remember to return them and you can read the books after completing the course .
you can pay more than 80 percent of the costs of a newly purchased book .
a student could , for example , &quot; calculus &quot; for a semester of about $ 20 .
find out about the terms and conditions of the business you rent , including the penalty fees that may apply to writing notes , submissions , etc .
beware of tenants : if you do not return the book , the penalty fees may even exceed the price of a new book .
e-books
e-books , rather than conventional textbooks , are also an option .
sometimes these books are rented de facto by providing an electronic licence for a certain period of time by wholesalers such as amazon.com , chegg and barnes &amp; noble inc.
at chegg you can buy &quot; calculus &quot; for 6 months for about $ 61 .
bracey says that students in literary courses often find the best offers , since many classics can be downloaded for free nowadays , while scientific and engineering textbooks can be very expensive .
take a look around .
joe gault , 29 , who will soon be the pepper law school , recommends the isbn number for the price determination of bills that are not so safe .
and before ordering online , gault would like to check whether the book is actually in stock .
he learned this lesson on the hard tour .
he bought a book that had four weeks delivery time and finally paid the full price in the college bookshop .
why &quot; guardians of the galaxy &quot; no one has been called a poll .
&quot; the extenables 3 &quot; by sylvester stallone played less than 30 million dollars of his 90 million us budget , while &quot; sin city : a daad to kill for &quot; was only $ 12 million .
the camera diaz movie &quot; sex tape &quot; played the opening night at the opening weekend only 14.6 million dollars , while children &apos;s films like &quot; dragonfähmen made easy 2 &quot; also on revenue .
an article by robinson , a telegraph film critic , suggests that children &apos;s films are not sufficiently well suited to the lack of quality in the films themselves .
collin called 2014 &quot; the worst year &quot; for children &apos;s films and described &quot; dragon beds made easy 2 &quot; as a purely &quot; functional &quot; fantasy sequel .
in films for a somewhat older target group , however , it seems that the quality of the films is not necessarily the problem .
in july , entertainment weekly compared the average cinemascores and metacritic rating for each summer movie start , the one between the american memorial .
the results are based on the opinion of cinema visitors and film critics and indicate that this year &apos;s film hits are similar to those of the previous year .
some commentators say that the evolution is due to changing visual habits and the growing popularity of web streaming services such as netflix .
director jon favreau , who is currently working on disney &apos;s upcoming jungle book film , said to the hollywood report about the website : &quot; i think the times are changing . &quot;
we must accept this and not try to follow the past .
unlike today ’ s weak cash results of hollywood productions , netflix has recently generated sales of streamlined products .
last summer , the director steven spielberg criticized film studios for focusing too much on film screens by comics and prophesied a &quot; core melt &quot; .
in the light of the current slowdown , some commentators argue that his gloomy prophecy could well contain a true core .
the potential for causal losses in the summer of 2015 , including avengers : age of ultron , minions and jurassic world , will mean that other representatives of the film industry are more optimistic :
the producer of x-men , simon kinberg , described the decline in cash outcomes recently as simply &quot; cyclical &quot; and said to hollywood reporter : &quot; next summer will be the biggest summer in the world .
when the second table tennis district class was closed for streamlining the ligen division a few years ago , this was a step in the right direction .
now the german table tennis federation has added an additional 3rd bundesliga to the program .
the consequence : those who have not risen have gone up .
for example , göttingen &apos;s highest class team torpedo has won the abscess in the oberliga release , but will play only fifth in the coming season .
the fourth classic of torpedo &apos;s ladies , despite their grandiose margin in the regional league .
the boys and girls of torpedo start in the lower saxony league , as do the boys of the sc weende .
the sg lenglers and the torpedo reserve are taking place in the new league of associations , in the national league there are no göttingen clubs .
the ttv geismar plays at the ladies in the association league , the torpedo second in the national league .
what is the composition of the district is a better district class , now the new district soberliga south .
here tsv seulingen , vfb lödingsen , torpedo iii , geismar , eingeck , hamenstedt , bovender sv , langenholtensen , the fc .
the regional representatives dransfeld and sc weende are playing in the district league , in the district class of the ttc ii , rot-weiß , the bovender sv ii and the teams of the ttv .
güntersen , the ttc and the ttv geismar ii are here with from the game .
torpedo iii and saitenhausen / wöllmarshausen start in the district sliga .
with nine teams each ,
the sweeping sc sends its girls to the small district sliga .
the district sliga relay of the scw boys - there still starts torpedo ii - is not complete .
in a district class , geismar , tuspo weende and bovender sv go into the season .
in the first season of the newly founded regional association the two göttinger districts start with nine teams each .
in the west season , the red and white ii , bovender sv iii , laubach ii , torpedo iv and v , mtv grone , dransfelder sc ii , mielenhausen are .
in the east season , among others , satttenhausen / wöllmarshausen , nikolausberg and landolfshausen are playing .
the ladies kreissliga consists of sattenhausen / wöllmarshausen ii , bilshausen , hemeln , siulingen ii , tuspo weende and sg rhume .
that is still better than in the osterode county , where there are no more women teams at all at circles .
it is striking that none of the six 2.circular classes reaches target thickness , here the innovative and revolving district board will have to think about it .
nato summit : first protests in newport and cardiff
at the weekend , there were protests from opponents of the nato summit in newport .
on saturday , hundreds of people gathered in the centre of newport to an anti-nato march .
on sunday , about 150 people arrived in cardiff in front of the town hall to hold a so-called counter-summit .

the police told us about one kilometre from the residence of prime minister nawaz sharif , it was possible to meet again on monday about 3000 demonstrators with security forces .
according to hospital information , a policeman was injured .
at least three people were killed and more than 500 injured at the weekend when protesters tried to come to sharif ’ s residence .
you are calling for the resignation of the prime minister .
the powerful military had to leave the army on sunday evening after a meeting in the army headquarters to find a political solution to the conflict , &apos; without wasting time and using force &apos; .
the communication also said that &apos; the army remains committed to its role in ensuring the security of the state &apos; .
escalating violence is worried about military intervention that could be used in the past more often than not .
the political and economic reforms initiated by opposition politician imran khan and the preacher tahirul qadri have been going on since independence day on 14 august .
sharif refuses to revoke the agreement .
khan and qadri had called their supporters on sunday to stay .
&quot; we will not go back without forcing sharif to resign , &quot; khan said .
qadri expressed a similar view .
khan accuses sharif of holding the may last year parliamentary election through fraud .
qadri calls for the resignation of central and provincial governments .
then a transitional government will reform the electoral system and call new elections .
more than 40 000 security forces are in operation to protect the government quarter .
the protesters had initially been able to walk out peacefully in front of parliament until khan and qadri called on them to return to sharif ’ s residence at the weekend .

schrammel-dreamtor will quickly take you to siegerstraße rapid , the second season &apos;s victory , and has shown the right response to the disappointment at helsinki and will go to the country with a success .
&quot; we wanted to show a positive reaction , &quot; said foreign defender thomas schrammel , who , with his splendid leadership volley of the sixteenth corner , set the course for victory in the 14th minute .
&quot; i thought i had to have all the frustration of thursday and i was able to snap it under the bar , &quot; said the 26-year-old smiling .
when schrammel was on the 13th november 2010 for the last time in a bundesliga match , that was still for ried .
the first championship match in the rapid dress will be remembered .
&quot; for me this is something very special , i am from the rapid growth of the new generation , &quot; said schrammel .
due to the short term beck-bled course by mario pavelic , the cramble from the left turned to the right defensive side and made his thing very good there too .
he has had enough experience of being able to exercise this position in a miraculous way .
he has earned the goal , he has already done some assists this year , &quot; praised barisic .
team shows character schrammel also delivered the flank at 2 : 0 by hofmann after a little over an hour that finally brought the decision .
the fact is that the guests could have been contacted before that .
&quot; thank god we have had some luck today , &quot; also said schrammel , who was pointing out the gap between performance and results in recent weeks : &quot; the results did not vote , but the game was always good .
barisic even found that &quot; in many games before you had been better than today &quot; - against &quot; the strongest team that will be in this stadium this season &quot; .
the first triangle since 26 july has therefore proved that the team structure is capable of withdrawing the setbacks in spite of : &quot; today my team has shown that it is a character &quot; .
no less pleasing to him : &apos; we have finally played back to zero &apos; .
a lot of work during the national break also the fact that brian behrendt , mario pavelic , christopher dibon , deni alar and michael schimpelsberger have made several failures .
&apos;we must not forget that &apos; , barisic warned , who has been working with great enthusiasm and pavelic for the past three days , &apos; which has been very stable recently &apos; .
the national break must therefore be used to &quot; clear the wounds and to avoid a bit of physical damage &quot; , explained bari &apos;s statement that the country had five u21 choices .
one of those who are probably particularly interested in the break is captain hofmann .
he is tearing up for the team , going beyond pain .
it is precisely at this difficult stage that he has shown that he is a very important player for us , &quot; stated barisic .
hofmann gave the game rapids before its replacement in the 68th minute not only the structure , but also achieved the second goal .
for the 33-year-old who has completed his 350th bundesliga game , it was the first hit from the game since november 2 , 2013 ( 4 : 2 on the admira ) .
hofmann : &quot; must not believe that now everything is good &quot; &quot; we certainly also had a bit of luck , but at some point the luck must come back to us .
now it was high time , &quot; said hofmann .
he admitted that he would continue to work in a focused manner : &apos; you cannot always see this in black and white .
we have not played as badly in recent weeks as we have heard .
we must not , however , believe that everything is good now .
he could not deny the importance of his role for the team .
it is a very young team , and i can help them very much at the moment .
they are keeping to me at certain stages , &quot; said hofmann .
grödig-coach michael baur had little to blame himself and his team .
he regretted the quick match &quot; from the sorcerer &apos;s gate &quot; and the regular goal of nutz in the 40th minute , which was chosen by referee collegium unfairly .
the only criticism i can make of the team is that we are heading for tor in some stages not being concrete enough .
we have had too few qualifications .
internal defender maximilian karner saw it as similar : &quot; it started badly , but then we found it in and even made a goal .
by and large , it would have been more in the pipeline .
under this whistle there is ruh
we showed a powerful tribe in our puzzling task of the summer series &quot; my piece of rhöner luck &quot; last friday .
several of these tree giants are still in the county , the illustrated copy is the &quot; scourge &quot; above the under-weltbrunn .
a woody footpath leads up to the approximately 600 years old oak .
it passes by couples , basalt clusters and basalt stone seas .
a piece below the quarry of the bauersberg , one kilometre north of the straße to weisbach , it stands .
vital looks like a natural monument , it rises over the other trees in the area and reminds with a volume of more than eight meters of an american mammoth tree .
a small buddha on a tree swamp indicates that it is a spiritual or mystical place .
but , despite intensive research , there were only indications of the origin of the name .
dr. wolfgang schneider has consulted the bischofsheim archive and visited older people from unterweißenbrunn to find out what the evidence of the scourge is .
the result of his research remained a fairly sober explanation of the name .
so , up to about 80 years ago , goat shepherds were supposed to transport their animals from the fountain of underbelly to the arduous meadows liberated from stones .
at the foot of the tree , the pets exhausted by the ascent should have rested .
the area has now regained its importance , because in the meadows , pastures are actually used to produce goat herds .
the area is also the core zone of the biosphere reserve , has further been discovered schneider .
when entering the stone collection , be careful , because the stone built by the sun is heated .
a hiking trail leads from unterweißenbrunn to the tree , which is somewhat hidden .
other routes are indicated , the direction hochrhön up and the route leads to an extensive hike .
where is the waterburg ?
a watercastle that is being sought at our next task , however , is rarely found at high altitude .
the reflection in the ditch gives a good impression of the building , but we have some historic buildings in the district , including the building counter-fei , which may fit .
where is our &quot; piece of rhöner luck &quot; ?

after weeks of tug of tug , italy &apos;s premier and eu current president , matteo renzi , has voted against strong conservative resistance at last week &apos;s eu special summit to nominate his foreign minister , federica moghugu .
renzi looks at how the government-close daily la repubblica restates the vocation of his also in the government team as a favoritist as strengthening the position of the social democrats and his own .
he also expects a boost to his &quot; reform package &quot; in italy .
last but not least , renzi hopes that the ever-increasing left party base will be put in a position of calm , because mogherini will not be able to support this - albeit in a more moderate way .
i have a great deal to say to the conservative representatives of the commission , mr juncker , and to the poland nominated as president of the council , donald tusk , so the prevailing opinion in rome , so that political balance can be achieved .
the eu &apos;s chief diplomat will be the deputy prime minister of the commission , mr juncker .
the remaining agreement of the european parliament is considered certain .
otherwise , president giorgio napolitano would have preferred the nomination of the 41th year politician of the ruling democratic party ( pd ) to have little &apos; important recognition &apos; of italy &apos;s role in the eu .
la repubblica is spreading optimism that the political parties , which have been tried and trusted for almost two decades in leading party offices and which are known for their ambition , will be able to rise to the &apos; enormous challenges &apos; .
the native roman is married and has two daughters .
her party career began with a political scientist in 1996 in the youth organization of the then democratic di sinistra ( linksdemocrats ) , who was in 2008 engaged with the catholic center party marc .
in 1999 , mogherini was elected vice-president of the european community organization of youth ( european youth ) for three years .
the election of 2001 to the left-wing democrats led to the high party politics , worked in the foreign affairs department , whose leader she soon became .
it occupied traditional focal points of italian foreign policy , such as the middle east , was supplemented by studies of nato ’ s operation in afghanistan , in which italy is involved with a troop contingent , maintained contacts with the social democrats in europe and europe .
since 2008 she has been a member of the chamber of deputies , in which she is an expert in defence and european and international affairs .
when renzi became premier in february 2014 , he told mogherini to become his foreign minister .
if the pd is to get better relations with the country ’ s strong peace movement , which is one of the party ’ s more than 40 % votes in the may eu elections , then , as pd circles have noted , i have .
i do not agree with the reproaches in brussels that the new eu foreign affairs representative has too little diplomatic experience , and therefore lacks substance .
in brussels , particularly by poland and the baltic members , realistic accents are being mogherinis , mistrustfully , on the crisis in ukraine and described as &apos; pro-russian course &apos; .
it supports the russian company gazprom pipeline south stream , which is being discussed by russian gas in bypassing ukraine , directly to southern europe .
after renzi resigned in july as eu president , mogherini traveled to her first state visit to moscow .
photos you took with putin at shake-hands were taken in brussels with outrage , and also that you had to leave the kremlin head for october to a milan economic summit .
a total of nine young people completed their training at emz-hanauer in nabburg on monday .
this includes an azubi who had previously completed another training in the company .
in four training occupations , the new employees will be active : elektroniker ( three trainees ) , mechatronics ( two ) , tool mechanics ( two ) and process mechanics ( two ) .
all the azubis are from schwandorf : tobias braun and thomas bücherl from schwarzach , stefan brickl and florian rewitzer from schmidgaden , johannes bereich .
the new apprentices previously attended primary or secondary schools and realschools .
from wednesday to friday , the trainees of all the vintages and the instructors go to oberammergau to a team-building event where , among other things , a day hike and rafting are included .
the company has 435 employees throughout germany and 950 worldwide .
the number of trainees spread over all the years is 27 .
the french socialists should &apos; keep their mouths open and put france in order &apos; , said francois hollande &apos;s main ally .
mr valls called on the deeply divided left to &apos; love &apos; for the controversial issue of the socialist president .
the president deserves respect for everyone , deserves our loyalty , he deserves our support .
&quot; it is our duty to remain at his side , &quot; he said with great applause .
the prime minister made a reassuring gesture that his government would not accept the controversial 35-hour week in france despite strong calls for easing the regime by emmanuel macron , the new prime minister of economics .
on saturday , mr hollande urged his fellow socialists to &apos; unite &apos; with the government .
but christiane taubira , the minister for justice , has been putting sand into the wheels of meeting with the devil at a meeting of the socialist member and the socialist party in favour of the idea of a european parliament .
marine le pen , the far right leader of the national front , mocked the socialist funeral strikes and said that they could not imagine that the new valls government would last longer than a few months .
francois hollande is the emperor without clothes , but prince manuel valls has no clothes , they are forced to form a new government if the old one does not even survive a summer .
&quot; and the new will also not survive the autumn or winter , &quot; said miss le pen to support .
she repeated her party &apos;s call for parliament to be dissolved and said that she was confident that she would win in early elections and that she was ready to govern .
the french ruling party suffered a defeat in the local elections in march and the right-wing national front was at the eu elections in may .
a survey published in the sunday newspaper journal du dimanche showed that 76 % of french people believe that the socialists and the french are at risk of being threatened with death before the end of holland &apos;s term in 2017 .
pascal perrineau , a political scientist at sciences po university , warned that the french would quickly lose patience , if the new socialist regime had no improvement in the economy and rekords .
&quot; there is a small window of opportunity , but public opinion must feel fast that things change , &quot; he warned .
otherwise , the situation could deteriorate further .
norwegian cruise just before a deal with prestige cruises of $ 3 billion , will be in the grid for a $ 3 billion deal .
norwegian cruise line holdings ltd nchl.o , the third largest cruise operator in the world , is leading , according to industry experts , advanced negotiations to acquire the prestige cruises international competitor .
a deal would be norwegian cruise , a company with a market value of $ 6.8 billion , access to the luxury cruise ships of prestige cruises and access to their wealthier customers .
an agreement could be announced this week , said the sources on sunday and warned that the talks will also end without results .
the owner of prestige cruises , the private-equity company apollo global management llc ( apo.n ) also owns a 20 percent stake in norwegian cruise .
the sources asked for anonymity , because the negotiations were not public .
norwegian cruise and prestige cruises representatives did not respond at request for comments , while a spokesman for apollo refused a comment .
the company , based in miami , norway cruise operates 13 cruise ships on routes between north america and south america .
its revenues in 2013 were $ 2.57 billion , an increase of 13 % compared to 2012 .
prestige cruises , also located in miami , operates under the brand names oceania and regent , which together includes eight cruise ships on routes to scandinavia , russia , the mediterranean sea .
it reported revenue for 2013 of $ 1.2 billion , an increase of 6 % compared to the previous year .
the cruise industry is totaly about $ 29 billion , and in the coming years , with the strengthening of the middle class in emerging countries like china and india , they are expected to do so .
companies are trying to be the best choice for these new customers in the cruise operators .
prestige cruises has applied for a new standard of trading to be issued to us regulators in january 2014 .
apollo is the majority shareholder of the company for a $ 850 million deal in 2007 .
norwegian cruise was established in its current form in 2000 by a merger with a cruise operator owned by genting bhd ( gent kl ) , a leisure and casino company .
apollo invested $ 1 billion in norwegian cruise in 2008 .
norwegian cruise was listed on the stock exchange in january 2013 .
genting held 28 percent of the shares , apollo 20 percent of shares , and the private-equity capital company tpg capital , in late june , according to licensing authorities .
carnival , royal caribbean cruises and norwegian cruise have a total of 140 passengers per week , according to the original application documents for the prestige cruises stock market .
pro-hong kong activists condemn china the day after the election .
a peking-loyal group was close to the chinese flag .
the standing committee of the national people ’ s congress adopted a framework law on sunday , which only nominated two or three candidates for the hong kong leadership in 2017 .
all candidates must first have the majority support of a nomination committee , which is expected to work with peking-loyal members .
this decision will almost make it impossible for opposition democrats to be allowed to vote and prompted pro-democracy activists to vote in favour of their threat .
political reform has long been a controversial issue in hong kong , and china ’ s party leaders fear that calls for democracy will spread to other cities .
after the publication of a beijing white paper in june , which confirmed china &apos;s dominance over hong kong , democratic activists held an unofficial referendum .
lis survey is conducted by the hong kong government and the hong kong china liaison office .
the vice-chairman of the legal affairs committee of the standing committee , zhang rongshun and the vice-director of the hong kong and macau state council office , feng wei , should be consulted during the day .
student activists announced that they would appear in front of the head office in hong kong in the afternoon .
britain saw the end of the 150-year-old colonial government in hong kong without any democratic elements .
putin demands kiev to open &quot; statehood talks &quot; with eastern ukraine .
russian president vladimir putin demanded russian media reports that on sunday ukrainian government should not be allowed to continue fighting the separatists in the east of the country and start negotiations immediately on the &quot; statehood &quot; of the russian government .
his spokesman , dimitri peskov , later made it clear that putin did not mean that this would be the region of east russia under the control of the separatists , but that his status vis-à-vis ukraine should be redefined .
putin ’ s appeal to the kiev government to negotiate on an equal footing with pro-russian insurgents , however , fits in with the policy that he has apparently pursued since the riots began five months ago : help for separatist regions
in an interview with the state television channel one , putin condemned the ukrainian military campaign for the reconquest of the land held by separatists in the eastern regions of donetsk and luhansk , which took place in march .
the kremlin and the separatists have recently described the area taken as a &apos; novvorossiya &apos; or &apos; neusrussia &apos; , a term that is reminiscent of the pre-revolutionary period of russian empire .
putin pointed out that all those who have been in ukraine ’ s campaign for the elections on 26 october , and those who have been in power in government groups , have been using civilian communities in the areas held by separatists , are attacking their peace .
&quot; we need to start detailed discussions immediately , not only on technical issues , but also on the political organisation of society and the state status of south-east ukraine , in order to safeguard the interests of the people who live there , &quot; he said .
peskov said that putin ’ s reference to statehood in the context of greater autonomy must be seen , which has been supported for months by kiev ’ s leadership , to address concerns in russian-speaking areas .
only the ukrainian government can give the eastern territories the necessary autonomy , said peskov .
this is not about negotiations between ukraine and russia , peskov said , &apos; because there is no conflict between russia and ukraine , but about an internal conflict in ukraine &apos; .
the kremlin speaker &apos;s clarification of the &apos; misinterpretation &apos; of putin &apos;s remarks underlined the leadership claim of russia in dealing with the separatist rebellion in the east , unlike the way russia handled it directly .
moscow would have far greater difficulty in getting the regions of donetsk and luhansk to annexed to eastern ukraine , as most of the 6.5 million inhabitants are not russians and polls from the pre-conflict era are still a major source .
the autonomy enjoyed by russian diplomats in international fora would be a great help to regional governments in ukraine to negotiate their own trade agreements and external relations , and thus to the kremlin de facto control an area .
the peninsula annexed five months ago in the black sea is the home port for most of russia &apos;s navy and an important trading port and historical coastal region .
the regions between the rostov region in russia and crimea are also rich in mines , factories and foundries , which are important components for the russian military .
ukrainian president petro poroshenko proposed , in his inauguration speech on 7 june , that ukrainian legislation - after new elections - should consider constitutional additions that would allow the territories greater control over their finances .
but his idea of autonomy seems to be in sharp contrast to that of the kremlin and the separatist rebels , whose armament and incitement to moscow is accused .
putin ’ s last call to kiev to negotiate with separatist leaders at an equal level followed another pre-eminence in the rebels last week , after russian troops and panthers broke the rules .
the separatists , supported by russia , took over in the hand , which , according to fears of ukrainian security officials , was the first step in a campaign to take over the strategic coastal region to crimea , control of novoosov .
that is why massive civilian and military preparations have begun to bring mariupol , a steel industry port , with 500,000 inhabitants .
poroshenko spoke to the european union at a meeting of eu leaders in brussels on saturday and urged action to prevent another russian aggression against ukraine , a former soviet republic that has been independent for 23 years .
&quot; we are on the brink of a point where there is no return , &quot; warned poroshenko .
thousands of foreign troops and hundreds of foreign tanks are now on the territory of ukraine .
the eu summit did not decide on concrete actions , the leadership demanded further sanctions against russia , which would be put in place in the event of an unspecified escalation of the ukrainian crisis .
ukrainian soldiers had to move away from their positions in ilowajsk after two russian tank columns and 1,000 soldiers entered the donetsk region last week to secure the siege of separatists .
the first probably 63 ukrainian soldiers who were killed by the russian invasion in ilowajsk were killed on sunday against 10 russian parachutists , who were killed a week ago in ukrainian territory .
nude photo scandal around australian celebrities and gabi grecko
geoffrey noble made no secret of his anger about hackers , who presumably had naked images of his fired gabi grecko and a who is who of the a-celebrities from hollywood .
the film city is in excitement after a series of unique photos of a naked jennifer lawrence in a hackings scandal around celebrities on the internet .
the hacker responsible for this probably has 60 nude photos of lawrence , star from &quot; the tribute of panem &quot; and superstars , including the model .
the australian actresa palmer , emily browning , yvonne strahovski , and greco from melbourne are supposedly also taking private photos because of an icloud gap .
there are 101 celebrities on the list .
noble , who got praised with greco last month , said to confidential : &quot; it &apos;s disgusting . &quot;
all private letters and pictures should remain private .
it is a shame that private information has been stolen and passed on to others .
grecko , currently in new york , said reportedly a news site that the hack is &quot; disgraceful &quot; and that the people affected felt &quot; hurt .
the hacker probably has 30 images of palmer with her ex-friend scott speedman , including two pictures in which she is above without a pool .
palmer &apos;s film works include &quot; love is unbeatable &quot; with liam hemsworth .
palmer , chuck-star strahovski and the actress browning from sucker punch were yesterday in favour of comments on the chopped pictures .
one lawrence &apos; said to tmz : &apos; it is a horrendous violation of privacy &apos; .
actors seth rogen condemned the hacker in his tweet : &quot; hacked images from a mobile phone is nothing but the sale of hackers goods . &quot;
from a purely legal point of view , the spread of stolen images should not be tolerated .
cyclists , joggers and hikers were on the big feldberg yesterday on the 8th bike and have thus joined the association &quot; help for cancer children &quot; .
the tour , which was a tortuous one , was a light training for the others .
however , there was one thing on which everyone agreed : it was fun .
thomas studanski will have slept well last night .
for the first time in his life , the head of the oberurseler brewery was riding a bike on the feldberg yesterday .
for the good purpose .
he can easily get away from the little muscle cake , especially as he is not allowed to take part in the 8th cycle on the great feldberg in favour of the association &quot; help for cancer children &quot; ( frankfurt ) .
a great thing .
&quot; i know now that i can do that - great ! &quot;
small picking up in the appllauskurve ?
nye , if i had ever stopped , it was about to be ...
as thomas studanski , who is responsible for the cdu in the oberurseler stadtmrücken , yesterday , many of the 718 participants were tortured in the spring and came close to exhaustion plateau , but happy .
others , by contrast , had a easier ride on the 11 km long stretch between the hohemark and feldberg .
norman diessner , for example .
the green politician from the kremlin , who appears in red , has a red dress , a red bike , made a little more on understatement ( &quot; lots of professionals , there is arrive the destination ! &quot; ) !
he too is driving the course in a slide , as did nina kuhn , press spokesperson for the city of oberursel , who , together with frank grüneisen , had set out on the way .
for the two triathletes , the &quot; feldberg bike &quot; was not necessarily a sporting challenge : &quot; this is about charity , we are happy to be there - we would have had an exit anyway today &quot; , &quot; he said .
on the way , they met paul wenzel from oberreifenberg .
the boy ( 12 ) was descended in the morning to oberursel to get straight on to the top .
the frankfurt florian orderz had settled in the sattel at 9 a.m. , &quot; made &quot; the field mountain two times , to then go with fun home .
the fun was also &quot; fritten-toni &quot; .
for the head of the oberurseler kultkiosk , bike tours over the feldberg are just part of the package .
he had a hard time driving his 6.5 kilo racing bike 40 minutes .
a crazy event .
for this purpose - i am happy to be there &quot; , andreas balzke said .
the thirty trained mainzer says that he is an &quot; ambitious racecyclist &quot; .
he must be , because he was not very happy with the &quot; fixed wheel &quot; , but he was also on the road , although racebikes are not ...
the room was very clean and comfortable .
bergwacht doctor professor volker lischke , who with his team , equipped with allrad-bully and quad , provided for safety , said : &quot; the kenn &quot; i from frankfurt , the train station .
the 718 participants - and with them as many as ever - were sent to groups in the morning .
the hikers first at 9.30 a.m.
the first cyclists and runners followed at 10 am .
five minutes later the first mountain bikers set off .
bent hansen , chairman of the association &quot; radinen auf den großen feldberg &quot; , gave the start commands and wished the participants a nice trip .
for next year , he hope that he will be able to make the route to feldberg to the safety of the participants .
