remembering the very american ideal of labour rights as human rights as a human rights human rights , which is a very american ideal , human rights , as human rights , as a human rights human rights , as a human rights human rights ,
congress mps keith ellison and john lewis have tabled a legislative proposal to strengthen the organization of trade unions as civil rights .
&quot; just as unions die , so do the middle-class jobs , &quot; ellison said , a democrat from minnesota and deputy chairman of the progressive labour party .
i am therefore proud to be able to express my support for the staff register together with the civil rights icon john lewis .
this groundbreaking law gives workers the same legal opportunities to discriminate against because of the organization of trade unions as in other forms of discrimination - and thus stops anti-union forces .
the addition of the national labour law to provide an opportunity for discrimination against employed workers to organise a trade union representation is an important step in bringing an appeal to a civil court - and to prevent damages or criminal penalties .
but it is certainly not a radical initiative - at least not in accordance with american standards .
indeed , the best way to understand what ellison , lewis , and other sponsors of their legislative proposal are to link back to a very american idea .
despite the setbacks that unions have been subjected to in recent years - in wisconsin , michigan and other countries throughout the country - americans once had a duty to encourage countries around the world to recognise labour rights , especially in china .
there was a time when millions of americans remember that when this country was democracy , freedom of speech , freedom of the press and the right to association , it was still in the same breath .
when the united states occupied japan after world war ii , general douglas mac arthur and his staff encouraged the country to create a constitution that would ensure that the country would not be militarised autocracy .
in full awareness of the need for workers and their unions to help create a new japan , they used a language that was explicitly called “ the world ’ s first ” .
when the united states occupied germany after world war ii , general dwight david eisenhower and his staff urged the germans to write a constitution that would ensure that fascism was adolf hitler ’ s democracy .
recognising that workers would organize , the commission would not be able to speak out in the new nation , the germans added a clause that explicitly states that the workers would be free to speak .
agreements that restrict or limit this right to make it more difficult to achieve are null and void ; to achieve these measures are illegal and unlawful .
when the former first lady eleanor roosevelt was in charge of the international human rights commission , the commission that signed the universal declaration of human rights , as it was signed by the united nations in 1948 as a global agreement .
for generations , americans have accepted the basic premise that labour rights are human rights .
when this country told other countries how to protect civil and democratic societies , they said that they would not respect the right to establish a trade union - and that they would not be able to participate in collective negotiations as equals .
after these rights were under attack in america , it is indeed very wise to re-establish the american ideal , which is that the working population should have the right to move .
as pastor martin luther king jr. said 50 years ago ,
history is a great teacher .
now everyone knows that the workers &apos; movement does not limit the strength of the nation , but has increased it .
by raising the living standards of millions of people , work miraculously created a market for industry , bringing the entire nation into unimaginable levels of production .
those who attack the work forget this simple truths , but history preserves them .
history recalls , and we should do so .
formal recognition of labour rights as human rights - and the extension of the protection of citizens &apos; rights as a protection against discrimination in the creation of employee representatives - is long overdue .
keith ellison and john lewis are renewing the ideals that have made america great in the past and honoring the promise of democracy .
judge temporarily stops law that all abortion clinics in louisiana are forced to close .
a us federal judge stopped the bidding for the time being in louisiana on sunday , and lawyers said that it would probably lead to the closure of all five abortion clinics in the state .
this measure , which was proposed by bobby jindal , governor of louisiana , in june , and which was adopted on 1 september , is likely to bring doctors who have abortions into force .
the judge &apos;s decision means , however , that doctors will continue to have legal abortions for the time being , while they are requesting such a right .
&quot; the plaintiffs can continue to work in accordance with the law while they strive to obtain these rights , &quot; wrote federal judge john degravelles in his judgment .
within a month , a hearing will be organised for the judge to establish a permanent legal decision .
pro-abortion welcomed the decision to include the youngest in a series of judgments against similar measures and said that doctors had more time to take care of hospital care .
&quot; today &apos;s decision means that women in louisiana are subjected to a devious law that deprives them of their health and rights , &quot; said nancy northup , president and chairman of the centre for reproductive rights .
it was not immediately clear whether the judgment would affect doctors from the two clinics as well , who were in charge of the complaint and were also in favour of the right of referral .
louisiana is one of 11 countries that have enacted similar laws , with courts recently taking such measures in alabama and mississippi for non-constitutional purposes .
key points of a law in texas that covers most of the clinics remaining in the state to close were taken up by a federal judge on friday .
pro-abortion and the american college of ostretricians and gynecologists , as well as the american medical association , are all in agreement with the view that the right of referral by doctors is unnecessary restrictions .
anti-abortion is opposed to the idea that the measures should be aimed at protecting women &apos;s health , although some people also consider the effects of closing clinics to be a positive thing .
only one doctor who has been aborted in louisiana has patients &apos; rights to enter the hospital , divided the centre for reproductive rights with them .
if all other doctors in the state are forced to stop aborting , this doctor would not be able to take the operation for fear of his safety , the group said .
in its arguments against the judgment , representatives of louisiana said that they did not want doctors to be prosecuted for abortion .
delayed diagnoses and lack of access to the best treatment methods lead to higher death rates by eggs cancer in rural areas .
angelina jolie and her brother james have a video homage to their mother online .
for women in rural australia , there is a greater risk of losing eggs cancer .
researchers analyzed the medical data of more than 1100 australians , who in 2005 had detected ovaries , and found that only 25 % of the patients were diagnosed five years after diagnosis .
the research director susan jordan of the qimr berghofer medical research institute said that for those who work in rural and remote regions of the state , the sterbalized system is the risk of death by 20 % .
small study : new drugs could be lung and ovarian cancer .
the researchers studied the medical care of women over seven years .
dr. jordan said that the age of a woman in diagnosis , the type of ovarian cancer , existing predisorders , and the social and economic status also affect the chances of survival .
for older women and those whose cancer is not yet known at diagnosis time , the number of patients in the age of 16 was the lowest .
for those who live in rural and remote regions of the state , the mortality rate was at around 10 % lower than in the case of those in urban areas .
although the study did not investigate why non-urban women with higher probability of ovaries were not able to die , it suspects that jordan would have been able to diagnose the disease belated and lack of access to the best treatment centres .
&quot; this disease is best described by gynaecological oncologists , and these are usually found in larger cities , &quot; she said .
despite the improvement in telemedical services to counter distances , the commission proposed that the situation be reversed as a possible remedy .
dr. jordan said that the study is a bad long-term study , irrespective of geographical status , of women in ovarian cancer and underlined the need for better treatment .
the rio tinto ride to conquer cancer financed study is now being published in the medical journal of australia .
in march 2013 , elisha neave , a young mother of 33 years from the gold coast , learned that she had an aggressive form of ovary cancer .
garden centers regret falling house owners , and the number of households declining in the garden declines .
the decline , together with a sharp fall in the number of homeowners under the age of 35 , could result in garden centres losing tens of thousands of pounds a year if today &apos;s young consumers were to suffer from a study by hta , as reported in the financial core times .
the report states that tenants account for an average of 55 % of the amount spent on home purchases .
the increase in people living in highly urbanised areas without gardens , the popular procedure of revolving around the park for asphalt and the sinking of garden size are further factors that will affect the industry .
in the london area , where 6 years of the share of homeowners in the united kingdom rose from 61 to 43 % , the lowest number of household expenses for garden products is reported .
the hta and the royal horticultural society point out that the housing is used for rent or for small gardens , not that people do not want to pull plants .
guy barter , chief garden consultant for the rrs said : &quot; container gardeners are very popular with tenants , for example , because they can feed their plants with them when moving . &quot;
the hta report identified the period between 1997 and 2005 as the &apos; golden age &apos; of horticultural retail trade due to increasing homeowners &apos; numbers and economic prosperity from the late 1980 ’ s to the mid-1990s .
he predicted that the number of jobs in the market would increase this year , owing to better weather conditions .
the opposition politician imran khan and the clergyman
in the capital islamabad , around 1000 demonstrators have broadcast ptv to the state television station .
information minister pervaiz rashid said that soldiers had taken the protesters back out of ptv buildings .
the station opened its operation for about 40 minutes , but is now sending again .
at the same time , around 3000 demonstrators attempted to return to prime minister nawaz sharif ’ s residence .
about a kilometre away , they supplied themselves with sticks and stones equipped clashes with security forces .
the police used tear gas .
the demonstrators called for sharif ’ s resignation , but he refused .
the country &apos;s army is meanwhile urging a political solution to the conflict , &apos; without wasting time and using force &apos; .
after a meeting at the headquarters on sunday evening , the military announced that &quot; the army remains its role .
the military plays an important role in pakistan and has already been pushing more often .
opposition politicians imran khan raises prime minister sharia kharif to ask for a vote in the parliamentary election last may .
the protests were escalated at the weekend , after khan and qadri called on their followers to return to sharif ’ s residence .
three people were killed .
turkey is occupying us diplomat for spying on the us diplomat ’ s report .
the turkish foreign ministry has sent the most serving us diplomat in the country to report on american and british espionage in turkey .
vice-president bülent said that the us embassy and turkish officials read the report on monday .
the german magazine der spiegel as well as the online magazine the intercept reported that the data collected by the former us analyst of the national security agency , edward snowden , show that turkey is a major area of activity .
according to turkish news agencies , the turkish president rebecp tayyyip erdogan played the importance of the report down and said that all the major countries must each other spy out .
an earlier report that also included germany ’ s main intelligence service , ankara , provided a significant anger for the reactions of the turkish government .
warning strike : train drivers threaten to kill commuters .
the nationwide warnings campaign by the train drivers on monday evening could also boost passenger traffic in nrw .
the new year &apos;s eve , which is scheduled for 18 to 21 p.m. , will cover all the transport companies , including the long-distance , regional and s-bahn transport , throughout germany .
the main thrust of the warning strike is freight transport .
photo : a. burgi / a.s. : a. burgi / .p.a.
did the district chairman of the german locomotive leaders union ( gdl ) , sven schmitte , düsseldorf , say .
we expect significant failures .
regional priorities are not there .
the main thrust of the warning strike is freight transport .
deutsche bahn in nrw announced that it would do everything to minimise the impact .
however , the gdl did not say where it wanted to strike , so it was difficult to predict the consequences in concrete terms .
chief of the police of magaluf accused of corruption
the prosecutors put a stop to the office of the public prosecutor of mallorca on friday to evidence of blackmail by the city &apos;s policemen and employees .
the head of the police of calvià on the holiday island of mallorca was arrested after corruption charges by businessmen and bar-owners in the notorious binge-drinking hotspot magaluf .
chief commissioner josé antonio navarro was arrested following charges of corruption against him by several businessmen from punta ballena , the road in which most bars and night clubs of magaluf are located .
according to the online daily newspaper mallorca diario , the prosecutors put a charge on the office of the prosecutor for combating corruption in mallorca on friday .
two other local police officers were arrested by spanish guardia civil in connection with the corrupt practices of the spanish government .
the national spanish daily abc reported that the angry night clubs in spain were looking for a way to curtail the nepotism of the authorities .
&quot; it is no longer a question of money making , it is about survival , &quot; said one of the businessmen to the court .
let our livelihood be taken out of the game .
we have nothing to lose .
magaluf made a huge leap in the world this summer due to a viral youtube video , which was home to an 18-year-old british tourist who attended 24 men during a tour of the river fellatio .
since then , the island authorities have tried to prevent the illegal behaviour of alcoholic holidaymakers in magaluf , by preventing the number of participants in the infamous alcohol trade .
the playhouse club , where the fellatio incident took place , was closed for a year , while playhouse and the kneipp school were closed .
magaluf , the tourist resort that is popular with young british holidaymakers , is also suitable for a number of accidents involving alcohol .
the first spring day with wet and stormy weather conditions affects flights from adelaide airport .
spring has brought southern stralia a winter surprise .
in the evening until 9 p.m. another 5mm rain fell on the city , after 6.6mm , which was already on sunday night .
the last rainfall was the result of a series of short , stormy showers , including a cast that began just before 8 p.m. and was used for almost 4mm rainfall in about 10 minutes .
after the winter last week for an early dose of spring had provided , the temperature of the region fell by about 20 degrees celsius on monday .
the bad weather conditions probably led to the late landing of a flight of virgin airlines from melbourne to adelaide .
the aircraft would have landed shortly after 7.30 p.m. , but was caught by a torrent - a sudden change in wind speed or direction over a short distance - and had to go through .
windfalls reached about 50 km / h at this time on the ground at adelaide airport .
flight data showed that the aircraft was also in operation on a second landing flight and eventually dropped by around 8.40 p.m.
the flight delay resulted in delays in some other flights , including a flight from emirates from dubai and a quantum flight from the sydney .
for adelaide , a maximum temperature of 16 ° c is predicted on tuesday , with possible scales .
matthies says : it is high time to connect to a large network .
given the galloping technological advances that have made our comfortable home in high-tech , high-tech switchgear , the new technology is likely to be consoling .
while i write this here , my view of the spiral cable that connects the listener to the phone is striking , and i think : boah , how retro is that ?
but there is one thought behind it : if the cable were not , in the shortest possible time , all the listeners would fly around in the house , and that would be even more retro .
in any case , the eccletronic ( disguised ) is the one that applies to the ekeltronic ?
no , typos : electronic ) sector the rule that the world novelty of today is the electric scrap of tomorrow , bought - outdated .
and anyone who still wants a tube tv in the living room today , for example , simply says that he is fundamentally opposed to television .
why are these considerations ?
because we are not convinced by the pressure from ifa on the radio tower this week , our absolute incompetence in matters of electronics .
the layman , who used to be blind as a washing machine and cd player , does not even understand today the purpose of devices that are equipped with incomprehensible expert sprech in front of him : &quot; connect &quot; .
yes , can we ?
what should we talk about with people who apparently voluntarily spread such quark ?
in fact , for some 20 years now , the main issue has been that we like to link our house .
in order for the yoghurt to renew itself so that the fire alarm can come to our attention during the holiday in the maldives , it is reported that it is burning in the working room .
and would it not be wonderful if we were to have the air conditioning on our arrival ... ?
yes , but that requires air conditioning .
but a dream will certainly come true soon : we lift our armband watch , say ye &quot; saugen ! &quot; - and to the home the dust is running from the dust extractor .
wrong .
everything is in no way anything other than a revolution : &apos; the borders between white and brown goods are blurred &apos; , raunt has a sector expert , you can use the washing machine with a headphone , the steam engine is connected .
we also know from everyday practice that if a new device really is needed urgently , it is guaranteed that the battery will be empty .
what is another reason why the spiral cable on the phone is also the next radio exhibitions .
israeli children are returning to gaza after the war .
thousands of israeli children from the areas near gaza are being persecuted , and they returned to the schools on monday after they had left the summer in airspace .
the start of the school brought the peace process fueled by rocket holes in southern israel .
in the southern town of ashdod , employees of the &quot; pashosh &quot; kindergarten , which was hit by a rocket , were deported before the pupils arrived from the walls and showered .
&quot; we are a little afraid , but are excited , &quot; said ronit bart , resident in kibbutz saad and there english teacher .
many children from our area urgently need a return to routine .
her 11-year-old daughter shani bart said that it feels &quot; a bit of a comic &quot; , suddenly reappearing in school .
&quot; these were difficult times , and we were not out of the house at all , &quot; she said .
president reuven rivlin visited the kibbutz near the border with gaza to offer his support .
until a ceasefire interrupted last week , thousands of border communities such as saad remained in their homes or left their homes to live in saad in safer areas further away from gaza and to escape the missile .
many nahal oz residents , a municipality near the gaza border , are still living in a four-year-old boy , torn by a palestinian murderous shells .
the ministry of education announced that it had received about a dozen families .
their children were temporarily accommodated in other schools .
prime minister binyamin netanyahu visited a school in sderot , a border town with gaza that was badly affected by palestinian shooting .
he called on the children to learn a lot and said &apos; we will make sure that their knowledge is acquired and offer you security &apos; .
israel and hamas agreed last tuesday on a volatile peace process .
the ceasefire provided an immediate end to the fighting , but important issues remain unresolved , as hamas ’ s demand for the israeli-egyptian blockade of gaza and the reopening of the air and sea ehs .
israel is calling for hamas to be disarmed and for the bodies of two to be handed over to the fighting israeli soldiers .
a new round of indirect talks is expected to be held in egypt this month .
in the war , more than 2,100 palestinians were killed , three quarters of them civilians , and at least 494 children were killed according to estimates by the palestinians and the un .
israel is denying these claims and estimates that at least half of the deaths are deaths from militants who were killed , but did not provide any concrete evidence of this information .
on the israeli side , 66 soldiers and six civilians , including a thai worker , were killed .
hamas and other fighters in gaza fired 4,591 missiles and killers during the fighting in gaza .
meanwhile , the israeli military conducted more than 5,000 air and other attacks .
israel ’ s attacks damaged or destroyed thousands of houses in gaza , and about 250,000 people sought refuge in more than 100 un schools , which were in temporary detention areas .
while tens of thousands of people continue to live in the shelters and continue fighting , education authorities have postponed the start of the school year last week .
&quot; i hope the school is soon open again , so we can continue learning , just as the children in the world and the jewish children , &quot; said mohammad amara , a 13-year-old boy who is currently in prison .
at its choice in saxony : cdu-vize strobl provides npd prohibition procedures in question .
in view of the npd ’ s losses in saxony , cdu federal vize thomas strobl has argued for an end to the ongoing npd prohibition procedure before the federal constitutional court .
berlin – according to cdu-bundesvize thomas strobl , the ongoing prohibition proceedings against the npd should end before the federal constitutional court .
&quot; the npd performs worse than last time , &quot; said strobl , who also has cdu landing chief in baden-württemberg , who is the &quot; leipziger volkszeitung &quot; .
this is a welcome development in the right direction and a development that leads me to believe rather than to believe that the npd should be combated politically and not before the constitutional court .
the npd was quite close to the fifth round of voting on sunday .
a first attempt to ban the extreme right was made in 2003 , when the treaty of lisbon was also enshrined in the npd &apos;s top .
in december 2013 , the federal council , after long preparation , submitted a new application in karlsruhe .
the federal government and the bundestag did not join .
harburg : tents for new refugees
refugees are now being placed in tents in new countries .
the first reception for refugees in harburg bursts out of all seams .
now the interior authority has three red cross tents next to it .
district politicians were only informed a short time before – they were not very enthusiastic .
&quot; these slippery actions continue to fuel popular reservations and give district politicians no opportunity to play a constructive role in the humane provision of refugees .
your party demands that the district administration of harburg be unused houses at present to provide accommodation .
96 refugees can be accommodated in the three tents .
reasons for overcrowding in the first shot are the rush of aid seekers - and the fact that the people in the authorities do not have sufficient places in follow-up facilities .
many refugees therefore remain longer than the regular three months .
house prices have reached the highest winter rate in seven years , showing a widely observed trend in the world .
rp data corelogic hedonic home value index for own homes , homes , and other properties in australia &apos;s capital increased by 1.1 % in august , according to the rp data of monday .
this increase has reduced the overall increase in june , july and august to 4.2 % , the largest increase in the winter months since 2007 .
the annual price rise was 10.9 % , more than twice the annual price increase of the us $ 1.9 billion .
the research leader of rp data , tim lawless , said that sydney and melbourne had a two-tier market .
rp data figures show that the house prices in sydney are down by a 16.1 % last year , with melbourne in the region at 11.7 % .
the following markets are adelaide , brisbane and darwin , where prices are on average five and six percent higher .
at the other end of the scale is canberra , which is affected by cuts in government spending and where prices have risen by only 1.4 % over the year .
mr lawless also said that the spring beginning is now the beginning of a rise in the number of jobs for sale .
&quot; if you look at the continuing high rate of auction prices , a generally rapid sales rate and the continuing high prices of the auction market , you can probably see that the real estate prices are in the next three months .
in an opinion to the new press , he contradicts statements by the managing director peer medau and attaches an &apos; like a field master &apos; to the press .
the style of the university is not this , it says in the communication .
the medau family was in munich as early as mid-june to discuss the request of the university .
the statement that the plans were only announced in july is definitely wrong , &quot; poetzl said .
at the same time , he points out that the plans are not &apos; predetermined &apos; or even decisions &apos; , but &apos; preferential &apos; .
the parking lot needed for access to the narrow road up to the castle is also less dramatic than the meda fears .
from a nine metre road was not and is not mentioned .
at present , the figure is 5.50 metres , which is a metre wider than it is now , &quot; explains pötzl .
the argument put forward by the medat operators that their free and school-operated parking areas will only be used in future by students of the university is not to be allowed to apply .
the hotel is not in the centre of the city , but in the center of the city .
people living near the river
the bergwichtel children &apos;s crib , located on the site and on its doorstep the access to the parking deck is to be opened according to the president of the university .
it gives us to remember , &quot; that this is not just about the crèche , but also about the residents of the mouth of the friedrich streib-straße and the 800 students of the neighbouring realschule .
so it is much more than a question of the individual interests of mr medau , &quot; says pötzl .
whether the parents &apos; committee &apos;s criticism of the crèche , the extension of the road , would be equivalent to &quot; the few natural spots of coburgs lost &quot; , can the reader say himself .
in early october , pötzl , together with the state building office of bamberg , intends to publish the councils on the building development of the university until 2020 &quot; and in this context to address the importance of the new development &quot; .
peer medau had the parents of the crèche last week to talk about the plans of the university .
therefore , the access for the new parking deck should not be via the campus and the friedrich-streib-straße as before , but via the medal-mountain .
this would mean that the narrow road would have to be extended in two lanes , which is about a kilometre long .
according to the meda estimates , transport in the park of hohenfels would increase tenfold .
of about 2000 vehicles every day , we are talking about them .
the city has not yet decided to express its opinion on the project .
glandorf is a handball national team that is back .
holger glandorf will no longer be playing for the dhb team .
the 31-year-old german football team , headed by the bundesligist sg flensburg-handewitt , was particularly concerned about health problems .
i did not like the decision easy , it has gone on for several months .
it is time for me to listen to the signals of my body and to begin my career in the national team , &quot; said the world champion of 2007 at his facebook page .
it therefore goes hand in hand with a balance sheet of 167 country games and 576 goals for germany in international retirement .
because the throw-rolled spacer for the champions league winner is from flensburg yet another few years on torehunt .
the icelandic , who was elected for the national games against switzerland on tuesday , is the first time that glandorf has had a &quot; long and good conversation .
his ideas and approaches have inspired me as much as they have been to my many years of fellow players and successors .
but for my club i would like to be healthy in the next few years , for which longer regeneration periods are necessary , which will reduce the current double burden .
the left handler had a long way to go in 2012 after a heel infection .
because of achilles hash problems , he had been caught by team doctors from the german handball league ( dhb ) with a cortisone injection that later had a strong inflammation .
an emergency operation and two other operations followed .
then glandorf had filed a complaint against the team doctor , the dispute ended with a comparison .
twelve years of professional and eleven years of national team career do not go unnoticed by any body .
i have some health care sites that i can no longer ignore .
after the three infection-related foot operations that started in 2012 in a short space of time , i have never really put my blood pressure under control .
there are also a number of other wear-related complaints .
as early as the beginning of the year , i noticed that i am taxes my head , but i cannot deceive my body , &quot; explained glandorf in the interview to the magazine &quot; handball time &quot; .
for a comeback , he would only be available in absolute emergency .
&quot; when all the knits tear , i am always ready to talk , &quot; said the double family father to the magazine .
however , i cannot understand the years in which i can still play handball in one hand .
i must also say that after my long stay in hospital in 2012 , i also became quite humble about my health .
after my career i would like to be able to go at least a little .
in addition to the 2007 world cup title and the winning of the champions league 2014 , he won the 2008 ( hsg nordhorn ) and 2010 ( tbv lemgo ) the ehf cup .
in 2012 , he also secured the european cup in the cup in flensburg .
german economy in the spring fell by 0.2 % .
the crises around the world have hit the german economy in the second quarter .
gross domestic product declined from april to the end of june 2014 compared to the prior quarter by 0.2 % .
this was reported by the federal statistical office and confirmed that the data was provisional .
consumption alone enlivened the economy in the spring , while investment declined .
foreign trade , too , is slowing economic activity .
thanks to the strong start of the year , a total of eur 1 billion is expected for the first half of the year compared to the second half of 2013 .
horstmar was the starting point and goal of the &quot; münsterland-mooiste &quot; , which was first introduced on sunday through the burgmannsstadt .
the burgmannstadt horstmar experienced an invasion of dutch &quot; fietzenrieren &quot; on sunday .
the largest cycling association in the netherlands , ntfu , held the so-called &quot; münsterlande mooiste &quot; .
it is the biggest bicycle tour across the country .
over 1000 participants thanked me with their registration at jos ter huerne for organising this tour through the münsterland .
posted in various trade magazines this tour was offered to interested visitors .
we come from the heroes and went overnight to take part in this tour .
we would also like to take a closer look at the münsterland in this way , &quot; said cyclists who were delighted by the route through the steinfurt , borken and coesfeld districts .
after registration at the schützenbruderschaft sta .
katharina was on a small &quot; peace trip &quot; through the city over the wall , where the start was also made .
the route that was designed for three different categories also led to herrenholz over the schöppinger mountain in the direction of coesfeld and about havixbeck and billerbeck back to horstmar .
on 95 kilometres with 1175 metres of altitude , 120 kilometres with 1475 metres of altitude and 145 kilometres of 1775 metres of altitude , cyclists proved their good condition .
they were fed on the way in havixbeck and billerbeck .
the main organizer jos ter huerne and mayor heinz lölfing was pleased to announce the success of this cycling event .
we are satisfied and it was a nice experience for all concerned .
the organization was without problems and there were no negative incidents , &quot; notes heinz lölfing to a positive conclusion of this event .
unfortunately , not as many participants as the organizer had hoped , which probably happened to the bad weather forecast .
&quot; in 2015 , we will be back in hopefully nice weather on august 30 or during another weekend , &quot; the cyclists promised to return to münsterland and the organisers are planning a new edition .
konstantin wecker &apos;s ruthless honest memoirs
it is actually more philosophical than biography , which is constantine alarm , song maker , pacific artist , and poet .
not chronologically , but more thought sparks for thought scraps , the new world war ii , born on june 1 , 1947 , has lost its memoirs , each chapter is opened by a suitable song text .
and he is faithfully honest : from onanie as a gymnasiast to shoplifting and drug use , he leaves no human weakness out .
also , to show how he himself can show tolerance in dealing with his fellow human beings .
abstract but also more important concepts are taking up a broad scope : love , soul , ego , that being in now , spirituality - all of which he tries to get to the bottom , in very philosophical , but also .
and he also explains his pacifism , his social critique , his political commitment - and also how he sees not only music ( which is opera lovers ) , but also his social and cultural life .
the latter has consistently supported the libeman konstantin alarm also the ascetic monk , who &quot; by subtraction &quot; arises , as he says , &quot; by making everything unnecessary . &quot;
there is a clear distinction between all the highly spiritual views , but there are also short anecdotes to the earth : about sleeping in a local or a watchful world , for example , in a gis frequented car .
he is ruthless in his approach .
lenny henry : my father never got me into the arms .
never said &quot; i love you &quot; , i love you !
henry was one of seven children of a jamaican family in dudley in the midlands in 1958 .
his father , who died when henry was 19 , worked in a factory and their relationship was limited .
henry is trying for a comedy , rudy &apos;s rare records , and the most recent comedy series .
the soundtrack is a mixture of reggae and rap , with lively melodies .
but henry had to be replaced by some difficult childhood moments .
he visited &quot; many &quot; therapies after the death of his mother , and henry is thinking about his relationship with his father .
it was difficult to know him .
you never saw his face , heard only his voice : &quot; listen with the crash .
let your sister rest .
get down to it !
i want to look at cricket .
my older brothers seymour and hilton - who had grown up when i was a child - went with him to the pub and talked about things like form of beer .
i have never had such a conversation with him .
he spent much of my life in this serious type in the corner that the newspaper read .
recently , henry opened a foundry in dudley , and although the conditions are better than they were at the time of his father , he gained an insight into how life was for him .
it is now a little brighter , but they are dark , smoked , deep stylish labyrinths with flame busts and smoke and much soot .
my father used to sit in the bath and then he could be heard slowly as he sing .
when i was around , i realized that he was going to do so for years in order to prepare the food .
however , henry grew up as a child without his parents ’ love testimony .
my father never hugged me , he never said &quot; i love you &quot; .
only when my mother was ill towards the end of her life did we begin to &quot; i love you , i love you , i love you &quot; to say .
with his own daughter , billy , with dawn french , he could share the love he had lost as a child .
could you possibly be with the &quot; i love you &quot; stop ?
stop asking me to hug me !
papa , i am 22 !
with dawn french .
why should we not be friends ?
she is a great mother .
it is still covered with french friends , with the one he spent 25 years in paris .
dawn is a good man .
why should we not be friends ?
she is a great mother .
henry &apos;s own mother was diabetic .
this contributed to their death .
so when i was very , very overweight and symptoms of diabetes showed , my doctor said &apos; you must be radical .
so i went through this fitness and had to wear a drastic diet to get rid of the symptoms .
it is very difficult .
and it is a tiring task .
nobody likes to eat carrots .
henry &apos;s career changes may be reflected in his elegant , short cut beard .
since he was criticized by the critics for his othello , he has been captured by the theatre .
the comedy of the irritation followed , and then fences of august wilson .
this is a different experience than the sitcoms and comedy that has made his busy working life complete .
he began with only 16 years when he worked in a factory .
a dj discovered him on stage when he imitated people and wrote to new faces about him .
his television career began in the mid-1970s . &quot; i was for a fairly long time the only black imitator / comedian on television . &quot;
he learned at work .
i had to be very clear not only from the public &apos;s eyes , but also from 1975 to 1985 how to create an efficient joke narrative machine , while i was watching television as a star , and that was really difficult .
lenny was born in 1975 in new faces , new faces , new faces , new faces , new york , in 1975 .
since his manager is the stage law at black and white minstrel show , he was a light man , and he was a great fan of the show .
the hotel is very close to the airport and the airport .
i would like to see it never happened , but i regret not that the commission has done so .
it was a strange , unpleasant position for me , but i worked on giant projects and learned how to make a living with a large audience .
but this &quot; prize-winning , lightweight pillar of british television &quot; was also a &quot; grotesque parody of black people . &quot;
the introduction of figures that the british black culture has both mocked and celebrated has made henry work in the eighties .
the first series of lenny henry show was broadcast in 1984 and in the 1990s he was among others known as the chef gareth blacklock .
advertising , documentary films , tv series and film rolls were the hallmarks of his next decade , but after his bbc series lennyhenry.tv 2008 he thought : &quot; what do you do next , what do you do ?
after that came a documentary series for radio 4 entitled what &apos;s so great about ... ?
the first episode was about shakespeare .
on shakespeare , i was really allergic .
i never really had anything learned about him in school and thought he was mostly a domain of middle class , but white in stump hoses and a comb head .
so i was very afraid of it .
all of us interviewed for the show , peter hall , trevor nunn , adrian lester , judi dench said &quot; you should try it .
do not make it bad if you don &apos;t know what you are talking about .
take some of the words in your mouth , and then you will understand why we all shakespeare so love .
henry ran 20 lines from othlelos last speech for the documentary film and he was enthusiastic .
i had the feeling that i could do that .
it was almost as if someone had finally put my head right .
&quot; that &apos;s what it is about , it &apos;s a serious thing , take it seriously , learn your text , search a bit .
the samples were brutal , and i read this piece of work for months before we did it .
and it was a success .
they seemed to expect an accident , and that simply did not happen .
and soon he joined the comedy of the irritation .
suddenly i was in the national theatre and i could not believe it .
there was a moment when i thought &quot; oh , you &apos;ve changed you &quot; .
there was a technical error and henry felt instinctively that he had to entertain the audience .
&quot; a small voice told me &quot; you must now bridge 10 minutes while you are repairing the computer &quot; .
instead , the stage manager announced that the idea of moving forward as soon as the problem has been solved .
i went from stage and something in me said &quot; oh , god be , &quot; .
i am not responsible for this .
i can leave it to someone else .
&quot; you play in a play , so stay in your role . &quot;
henry in fences at the duchess theatre
to learn the text for fences was challenging .
panic is very good , it strengthens the sins .
that too was good , so it is like a big shield of the gods , who tell me &quot; that is your destiny &quot; .
he says so , of course , with a thundering voice .
so i stand by that .
i really love that .
i love to be in a sample room .
but henry still has the head of a comedian - our conversation is full of humorous outbursts , while he imitates people again and again .
i have decided not to make a stand-up comedy because i think that this kind of immediate satisfaction is of a chamber full of strangers somehow dangerous .
if we are looking for this , we are going to be facing a wall .
i sometimes meet live in apollo when i am interested in seeing it , but there is not so much i can do in general .
i ask him whether he ever had a stand-up comedy tour again .
the fun i have in a room with a director who is helping to create a beginning , a middle part and the end of a journey - i think not , that i can ever repeat it .
so is this his new incarnation ?
i think so .
i am a great actor .
it is fun .
we always tell a story , and that is great .
i love stories .
people love stories .
huthi rebels are blocking streets in yemen ’ s capital , yemen ’ s capital , yemen ’ s capital , yemen ’ s capital , capital , capital , capital , and capital .
in the conflict between shiite huthi rebels and yemeni government , the huthis have led to civil disobedience in the capital , sanaa .
huthi supporters would have found central streets in sanaa on monday , a speaker from huthi party said &quot; ansar allah &quot; .
access to parliament was also blocked .
yemeni media report a chaos in the capital .
according to the online edition of the newspaper &quot; yemen post &quot; , huthi leader abdulmalik al-huthi had a chance to speak on sunday evening about the measures .
huthi , according to the leaf , threatened to escalate further the conflict if his demands were not met .
the shiite huthis are fighting for greater independence from sunni-ruled yemen , and are calling for the government to resign .
the huthi people ’ s tribe has been besieging the yemeni capital for almost two weeks .
around 30,000 rebels have killed protest camps at the big access routes of sanaa .
the surrounding area is often the scene of bloody battles with the yemeni army .
kenya is registering officials to &quot; ghost employees &quot; to curb &quot; ghost employees .
kenya has begun to provide all state officials with biometric registration to &quot; ghost employees &quot; from the salary lists of the government .
staff who will be unable to register in the next two weeks would not pay any more , was a government communication .
the government suspects that thousands of people will be forced to leave the public service even after they have left .
president uhuru kenyatta promised to do so when he took office in 2013 .
when we examined it at the beginning of this year , it was found that at least $ 1 million ( £ 700,000 ) per month was paid for ghost employees and other abusive financial practices .
the government suspects that salaries will continue to be paid on accounts after a person has died or has received the public service , reports wanyama chemosiri for the bb .
all officials will now have to be present at identification centres in the next two weeks to ensure that their data on biometric registrations are recorded , was reported in a government message .
all those who do not do so without a credible apology would be removed from the pay list , was the communication .
&quot; this approach makes a significant contribution to rationalising public services by reducing the actual number of officials and also reducing salary lists on both government levels .
the scandal surrounding the art advisor helge achenbach will be debated in court for the first time on 11 november .
five heirs of berthold albrecht , son of aldi founder theo albrecht , demand a new state of affairs in a civil trial at düsseldorf regional court , amounting to eur 19.4 million .
this was shared by a court spokesman on monday .
in the complaint , it is said that achenbach has made a significant contribution to the purchase of works of art and vintage cars and that berthold albrecht paid higher than the actual purchase prices .
this would also increase the commission agreed .
achenbach has paid for 121 million euro valuables for albrecht .
children need roots and wings
he was in school for 44 years , 23 of whom were in charge of the school .
from that time manfred richter knows many petershausener and kollbacher from their time as a student .
his methods were sometimes unconventional , but always driven by his desire to help people in the pupil .
the snowboard is the most famous mountain in the giant mountains .
manfred richter loves the painting with the motif from his home .
judge was born in 1930 in trautenau / northern bohemia , today trutnov .
he was already interested in the first two years of his life after four years of secondary school .
one year later , the sudeten germans were expropriated .
within half an hour , the family had to leave their homes .
after a few months in a camp , the company moved to bavaria in 1946 - the freight wagon .
judges were thus in the upper franconian valley .
the teacher training took place in bamberg .
manfred richter had to travel ten kilometres to the nearest railway station six times a week , travel by train to bamberg , and travel three kilometres across the city to school and return in the evening .
after two months , manfred richter got a red cross home in bamberg : together with up to 15 co-students , he was able to sleep in a dormitory .
in 1951 he made the first and in 1954 after three years of teaching assistant , he was the second state exam .
since oberfranken is not a free-for-all teacher , he applied to upper bavaria and joined the university of munich on november 1 , 1954 .
the &quot; mäulein room &quot; was his first &quot; service flat &quot; in the school building .
in 1958 , he moved to the new teacher &apos;s house next to the school , where he was working on a three-room apartment .
this house bought manfred richter in 1980 , after the school in kollbach had been dissolved in 1968 .
until then , there were no official meetings in kollbach at the petershausen-kollbach school association and in petershausen five .
from the school year 1968 / 69 , these were realised in petershausen in the town hall today .
when the school association indersdorf was founded , only primary school remained in the village .
to give a backward position to the now smaller school , the dawn rechtor georg sigl moved to karlsfeld - and manfred richter was his successor .
but petershausen grew , and so the children and their teachers were able to build today from september 1982 , which was built in 1997 after judge retirement .
manfred richter praised the uncomplicated generosity of the then mayor ludwig götz , who also built a workshop at local costs and extended cellar rooms in 1997 , although this was according to the guidelines .
&quot; mayor götz was very schoolfriendly &quot; , judges remembered grateful .
in all his career , manfred richter never heard a speech from a government representative who was waiting for a department of justice and justice .
&quot; children must be given two things : roots and wings , &quot; says the 84-year-old .
and he had to learn : &quot; this is not always possible &quot; , whether he is only his pupils or his own six children , is not entirely clear .
in any case , judges were sometimes unconventional .
when students are tested , they did not get a penalty , and were not sentenced to a night &apos;s sleep .
at the expense of the municipality , judges had created two pair of boxing gloves and had the two counterparties compete , even though there was a veil .
for the good of the school , judges had a good relationship with the then mayor ludwig götz ( csu ) .
he moved the partisan judge to take over at least as the last judge at the csu list in 1996 .
but judges were chosen in place six , and joined the csu .
180 kilometres per day , 180 kilometres
hr4 bike tour 700 cyclists put their own bike in the bad salzhausen and schott spa park .
if cyclists are travelling to bad salzhausen or schotten , this is not something special in itself .
on friday , however , the number of restless impressions alone : the 700 participants of the hr4 bike tour and accompanying tross enjoyed a break in the lower spa park of bad salzhausen and later a party under the sky .
under the motto &quot; cycling and celebrating new paths between nidda and kinzig &quot; , the participants had decided to take part in the event on thursday in bad vilbel and had a concert from van baker &amp; band .
on friday it became serious : the cyclists took the first stage , which was 60 km across florstadt to bad salzhausen and further to schotten .
in bad salzhausen , the sportsmen of mayor hans-peter seum , who was riding a bicycle in bad vilbel , and the director of the company bad salzhausen , petra schwinkel , were invited .
for refreshment of body and mind , all sorts of good things were prepared : the rural women from rantown and nieder-mockstadt had 85 plates of apple , wet , scattered cheese and cheese .
&quot; such cakes can only bake women on land , &quot; praised a participant from aulendiebach , while he ordered another piece .
at the beverage stand of the gynastic club scour-nidda cold refreshments were possible .
the duo bravo kept visitors entertained with well-known melodies from operettas and musicals and harvested enthusiasts .
the beautiful ambience of the park was relaxing .
a gentleman also enjoyed a head-massage from his partner : &quot; he deserves it , after all he has already dropped off bike chains today .
meanwhile , the mayor and the managing director had to work : they were at the well in front of the reporter ramon ’ s drinking house .
also head of promotion tobias hagen , since the first hr4 bike tour in 2004 , has been able to only skirt short , since he had plenty of experience with on-site technology .
his pickup truck , where he was shot by three phones and a radio unit with his staff and the 15 member of the motorcycle team , was a very good example of this .
&quot; the majority of participants come from the rhine-main region , &quot; he said , &quot; but also from gießen or fulda , from lauterbach or the taunus , and even from numerous cities in westphalia .
the number of participants is a bit dependent on the available overnight capacities .
in category i , the participants are accommodated in hotels , in category ii in collective accommodation .
from the spa town the cyclists had a good impression when they were reopened after a year and a half : &quot; shoot ! &quot;
&quot; it was nice in bad salzhausen ! &quot; waved you to farewell .
after arriving in scotland , the group was allowed to take a short break .
but in the evening the cyclists were in the idyllic alteburgpark .
under the direction of the schottener gesellschaft für tourismus und stadtmarketing ( gts ) , the park had a beautiful festambiente and of course had to be tasted , for example flame cake with well-cooled feather with well-cooled white feather .
mayor susanne schaab , gts managing director markus hoßfeld and msc chairman wolfgang wagner-sachs in his role as member of the board of adac hessen-thuringia .
the three were obviously pleased with the &quot; many operations in scotland &quot; .
dj tobias hagen then released the dance stage .
the opportunity to move freely in the open air was not lost despite the sporting activity on the bicycle .
among the guests were increasingly citizens who were impressed by the good mood as well as the great crowd of cyclists .
on the second day , the birstein , guardian bach and bad orb stations were opened for cyclists , including a concert with the trenkwalder .
yesterday , after 180 kilometres cycling , the sports people met again in bad vilbel .
dozens of turkish police officers for &quot; conspiracy &quot; against the government have been arrested and sentenced to death for &quot; conspiracy &quot; .
a total of 33 police officers were arrested in turkey on suspicion of &apos; conspiracy against the government &apos; , report local media agencies .
the police authorities did not make an immediate comment .
among those arrested , 14 senior police officers , meldet hurricane and the police officers were arrested .
some of them were involved in the corruption investigations against government officials , including four government ministers last december .
a number of turkish police officers were arrested in july for allegedly having committed organised criminal organisations and for using telephone numbers to get to the bottom of the matter .
the turkish president recep tayyip erdogan ( who was then prime minister ) described her actions as part of the activities that were carried out by the islamist clergyman fethulla against him and others .
not all children in ukraine return to school .
schools almost everywhere in ukraine opened on monday ( 1 september ) after the summer holidays .
this day is traditionally an important day for families , and like thousands of other ukrainian parents , prime minister arsenij jazenjuk brought his daughter to school .
there he told waiting journalists that not all schools were reopened , that he was determined to keep the country open for future generations : he was the first to do so .
the september celebrations were not held in every school .
the sky is not peaceful across ukraine .
we must fight for a peaceful sky .
the whole of ukraine , a huge common ukrainian people &apos;s front , must fight for a peaceful sky .
aleksan pastukhow , school director of the school in slavjansk , the jazenjuk &apos;s daughter visited , spoke in russian .
we hope that peace will finally reign here and that children will be given an education that will be useful to them in the future .
the first school day of the new school year is traditionally celebrated , with children embroidered shirts , balloons in their hands and their teachers being flower .
with rona fairhead , the bbc may have found the great director it needs .
it is proud to have a proud tow from the banking world , media management and the inner circle of tory party .
and she has her own front-end experience .
her career began with the global management consulting firm bain and co . , on which she was awarded to morgan stanley , bombadier , ici and the media world of pearsons .
it was the chairman of the board of directors of the financial times for seven years and resigned when the top post of pearsons ’ parent company was sent to a younger male colleague .
their compensation was supposed to be nearly £ 1 million .
your political ranking is also solid .
she was born by lord brown , the former chairman of bp , to david cameron , when he was asked for more private economic knowledge in whitehall : she was appointed advisor to the cabinet .
her husband is an earlier tory councillor .
as long ago as may , i described the task of the chairman with a poisoned kelch .
not only is the bbc a huge and complex entity in the heart of public life , but there is also an internal paradox in its structure .
confidence works in two directions : internal to the first guard of its own management hierarchy in the bbc , but also externally as the voice of public concern and unrest when things go wrong .
this is creating an almost unsustainable duopoly , which , after a complete comprehensive reform , demands .
but which new coming chairman would risk being attacked , and not being able to take an institution apart , which is so complex as a chinese dynasty , while being in a position to care for its own job ?
it is a difficult task .
and as if that were not enough , many people are still interested in seeing the bbc reduced - power , money , and status obsolete .
while the competition is approaching and new technologies are making old , convenient collateral threatening , the forthcoming negotiation of licence fees for bbc with special risks is bound to be a reality .
for the modest sum of £ 145.50 per year , the british public is buying itself into what is certainly the largest media company in the world .
the bbc tells a good story : it says that it is worth 96 % of households , and that each of them costs only 40 pence a day .
and the bbc seems to be rising on the popularity scale again .
the visual and usage habits of the bbc have changed : i am now getting news reports about the future of my mobile and i see packaged programmes later on on my iplayer .
but she remains a very beloved and noble institution .
it needs a considerable chairman - i hope she has found it .
perry from texas says that lowering tweet is not authorized to use the internet .
a tweet from the official account of the republican governor of texas , rick perry , was included on sunday in a downright remark about the democratic district state prosecutor , who was at the heart of a newspaper .
the tweet was later deleted and replaced by another perry user account that was previously running the abstract .
a tweet is currently sent from my account , which is not authorized by me .
&quot; i approve of the tweet and have deleted it , &quot; it was called in the later news .
perry staff did not respond promptly to comments .
although the tweets from perry &apos;s official account were out , it was not clear who actually used the feed .
in the previous tweet was an unfavourable picture of the district prosecutor of travis county .
perry put a veto on financial support for her office when she refused to allow her to resign , leading to an accusation against perry - possibly in 2016 presidential candidate .
the text of the tweets is : &apos; i don &apos;t always go drunk with the triple permitted alcohol level ... but if i do , kick me gooverneur .
i am the most drunk democrat in texas .
lehmberg ’ s office was not responsible for the investigation of the grand jury against perry .
this was written by michael mccrum , a special prosecutor from san antonio , who was chosen by a republican judge .
perry argues in no guilty and called the charge a political trick .
his high-class team of legal advisers requested that the court of justice appointed with the case be able to reject the charge and argue that the law would be incompatible with the law against the most servant governor .
perry stopped $ 7.5 million of government money to the public integrity agency .
this veto provided a public complaint from a left-wing watchdog party .
perry &apos;s official account is often updated - and sometimes famous .
after being elected at the iowa election meetings during his presidential term in 2012 , he was the fifth to have left the country on speculation .
berkeley explains the housing market again for &quot; normal &quot; .
one of the most prominent builders in london pointed out that the construction of the housing market in the south-east of england is back to normal levels .
homes in the capital were hotly sought-after and were the subject of huge price increases , which the bank of england has been unable to do because of the widespread fear of a credit bubble .
tony pidgley , founder and ceo of the high class construction company berkeley said on monday : &quot; since the beginning of the current financial year , the market has returned to normal transaction levels since the peak of the year .
the london real estate market was a good place to start during the downturn , as foreign buyers pushed the capital .
according to the register of the registrations , prices in the city area alone rose by 18.5 % in the past year alone , far more than the average increase in england and wales overall .
the average sales prices for berkeley ’ s private , inexpensive and student offers rose by about one-fifth in the past year , and at the end of april were around £ 423,000 .
a stronger pound has , however , in recent months , brought real estate ownership in london less attractive to foreign buyers - some of them have also been affected by the introduction of new real estate taxes and political rhetoric about a possible &quot; ville tax &quot; in the coming elections . &quot; .
the london real estate agent foxton warned in the past week that the mortgage market in the us was in the offing for april , when more severe credit allocation schemes were presented .
new data from the bank of england on monday show a decline in mortgage allocation in july , which also suggests that the us is recovering from the recession .
hamptions international , another real estate agency , corrected its forecast for the rise in property prices in london for 2015 to 3 % , based on an already weaker growth rate .
the transaction volume in the most expensive areas of london , such as chelsea , mayfair and kensington , has now increased by a quarter year , according to the broker wa ellis .
nevertheless , the desire for a home in the capital for berkeley is a blessing , as the sums due for futures sales amount to more than eur 2.2 billion .
mr pidgley added : &apos; demand for the right , well-planned product to the best locations is still stable .
in june , the company reported that it had acquired 3,742 new homes in the year until the end of april - almost a third more than at the peak of 2007 before the crisis .
the annual pre-tax result rose by 40 % annually to £ 280 million , with sales of 18 percent to £ 1.6 billion .
in a communication on monday before the company &apos;s annual meeting , mr pidgley said that the revenue for berkeley is expected to reach the current market expectations this year .
analysts all agree that the annual pre-tax result is estimated at 450 million pounds .
berkeley shares were in london in the afternoon , at 23.96 £ .
naked photos from jennifer lawrence by hacker published on the internet by hackers published on the internet .
jennifer lawrence appeared at the 85th oscar award .
naked photos of the oscar winner jennifer lawrence were posted online by a hacker who claimed that she had &quot; made a master list &quot; of other 100 starlets .
a representative of the star from &quot; the tribute of panem &quot; confirmed that the photos of lavrence echt are real and complained the hacker because of &quot; blatant violation of privacy &quot; .
the authorities have been notified and will follow all those who have taken the stolen photos of jennifer lawrence .
the photos originally taken on the photo sharing page 4chan are now available in english .
it is not certain how many of the images are genuine , although winstead , star from &quot; scott pilgrim against the rest of the world &quot; on twitter also condemned the hack .
&quot; to those of you who look at photos that my husband and i took years ago in the private environment of our house - i hope you are really satisfied with you &quot; , wrote winstead on twitter .
victoria justice from the nickolodeon series &quot; icarly &quot; and &quot; victoria &quot; are the best of the two series .
let us just fight back . * word game is intended * .
buzzfeed reported on late sunday that a speaker had been using popstar &apos;s ariana grande to call the authenticity of the alleged photos of her departure .
exclusive excerpt from howard jacobsons highly praised new novel about love and the letter &quot; j &quot; .
they were broken , so they could best describe it , they dissolved slowly , like a cardboard , which could be burned in the rain .
occasionally a woman said that he was too serious , strenuous , intensive , distanced and perhaps somewhat scratch-brushed .
and then shake his hand .
scratch-brushed he knew .
he was stuck , as in igel , yes .
the last victim of this stagelance was a recent affair , which was more promising for a relief of the lonely landing of his life .
ailin solomons was a trembling and delicate beauty with untamed hair and a flattering heart from a village on the north island , which even more had remote parts and smoother .
she was with an older companion coming south , which kevern held for her aunt , and which was a plot in a damp but paradisiacal valley with the appropriate name paradise valley .
for several years , no one had lived in the house .
the pipes were leaky , in the bathrooms were still spiders , nude chunks had their traces left on all windows and believed they belonged to all of them , and the garden was filled with weeds .
it was like the house from a children &apos;s fairy , both threatening and tempting , a garden full of mysteries .
portrait of the author : howard jacobson , whose novel &quot; j &quot; was published on the longlist for which man booker prize 2014 is available .
the shortlist will be announced next week .
kevern had dealers with ailin on the broken songs of the german high grade .
your feet are too big .
their own aggression led to songs of this kind no longer being played on the console .
not prohibited - nothing was really banned - simply did not play .
obsolete , as the word obsolescent was successfully used .
the general taste was good , which enacted and enacted rules would never have been possible , and how people could have used vom tellrecord-in-millionaire memoirs , cookbooks and romantic books .
in the euphoria of the day , kevern began to play an imaginary piano and to play in a grob funny serenade ailinn ’ s big feet .
ailin did not understand that .
&quot; this was a well-known song of a jazz pianist called fats waller , &quot; he explained it and automatically put two fingers on his lips .
his father had always done this to write j . , before he was released from his mouth .
it had been seen as a game between him and his father when he was still small .
his father had played it with his own father , so he had told .
if you start a word with a j , without two fingers over your lips , it costs you a penny .
it was not a very funny game even then , and it was not very funny even now .
he knew that he would expect it to do so .
it had to explain what jazz was .
ailin had never heard of any .
jazz , though not directly banned , was not played .
improvisation was no longer modern .
it was only room for a single &quot; if &quot; in life .
people wanted to start a melody quite sure where it would end .
likewise , the mind .
its unpredictability made people nervous .
and jazz was musically expressive mind .
although he had been 10 years old without being taken by sammy davis junior , he knew he was a little bit annoyed about jazz from the half-secret collection of old cds of his father .
but at least he did not have to explain that fats waller was black .
at her age she probably could not remember a time when pop-singers were not black .
again , no laws or constraints were applied .
a conformist society meant that every element of this society would be grateful to the principle of group talent - grateful as the people spared from fate .
people with afro-caribbean origin were affected by temperament and body building for entertainment and sports , meaning that sanges and ran them .
people originally from the indian subcontinent were like people from nature with electronic equipment .
what remains of the polish community is the fact that the canalisation was concerned ; what the greeks left was shattered by plates .
those from the gulf states and the levante , whose grandparents did not leave the country quickly than what had happened , were not able to do so , out of fear of being attacked for fire-fighting .
everyone according to his or her abilities .
since she only heard ballads , ailinn was hard to understand how the offensive words , which are kevern her just voiced , could be more vermonished .
music was an expression of love .
&quot; they are not really offensive , &quot; kevern said .
except perhaps for people whose feet are too large .
my father never insulted anyone , but he loved this song .
he talked too much , but the neglected garden gave him the deceptive sense of security .
nothing could prevent the sound insulation of the huge carbon dioxide leaves .
ailin still did not understand .
why would your father have loved this ?
he wanted to say that it was a jux , but hesitated to resume two fingers in their presence .
she thought she was already doing something strange anyway .
&quot; it seemed funny to him , &quot; he said instead .
she shaved disbelievers and blocked keverns ’ vision .
there was nothing else in the world to see than the uncombed rabbinic hair .
there was nothing he would have liked to see otherwise .
&quot; if you say it , &quot; they mean it without conviction .
but that doesn &apos;t explain why you prefer to tell me .
they seemed to be honest .
are my feet too big ?
he looked again .
your feet are not so direct .
maybe your ankles , a little bit ...
and thou saith thou hast hated me , because my ankles are too thick ?
hate yourself ?
of course i hate you not .
that is just the silly song .
he could have said &quot; i love you &quot; , but it was too early for that .
&quot; your thick ankles are exactly why you like me .
i am a bit perverse .
that was not right .
it was funny to say .
if he tried to be funny , he often got into trouble because he was like his father , not talking about the reassuring charm that he had to buy .
perhaps his father wanted to be cruel .
perhaps he , kevern , wanted to be that .
despite his friendly eyes .
ailin solomons was red and raised from her song &quot; the sun &quot; , throwing the console around and disappearing .
the wine of the hollow flowers , so drunkenness was no excuse for him .
in their excitement , they seemed to tremble as palmwedel was in storm .
and your thick head is exactly why i am perverted to you .
apart from that i am not at all .
she was sorry , both because of the unnecessary useless nature of his words and because of the fear that she had shown when she stood up against him .
did she think he would beat them ?
she had not told him about life on the cold northern archipelago , where she grew up , but he had no doubt that she was in essence so .
the same huge and ice-cold ocean broke out here as there on the shore .
the same confused men , with even thicker skin and addictive after what happened , were not their predecessors smugglers and beach robbers , moved from crackers to kneipe .
thick ?
they would have shown her a big fist if she didn &apos;t fit up !
you first knutschen - knutschen was the most commonly used word for an erotic attraction between men and women , a counter-poison to the nowhere love ballasts from the world .
kevern ’ s view was that this was an unnecessary refinement , as the crutching itself was already an act of violence .
ailin solomons gave him a sign through her body to go .
he was raised from the deck chair like an old man .
she also felt bleak , but the power of his sorrow surprised her .
this was not the end of the world .
they hardly knew each other .
she was watching him as he distanced himself - as from a room on the upper floor her companion was watching him - a man complaining with something he himself had to deal with .
adam leaves the garden , she thought .
she felt a sudden pain for him and men in general , although some had raised their hands against them .
a man turned away from her , his back bent , ashamed , defeated , without fighting spirit - why was that a sign of a man that she had good to know , if she was not so familiar with ?
when she was alone again , ailinn looked at her feet .
several years before the stories of the past , esme nussbaum , an intelligent and enthusiastic 3d animation team , worked on behalf of ofnov , the non-legislative director of the supervisory body for the research and development .
&quot; much has been done and much still needs to be done , &quot; she wrote , &quot; to the innate aggressiveness of a people who has suffered a thousand wars and who have won most of them , especially in the last few years .
but some features are inexorable .
the higher the church tower , it seems , the lower the passion that he continues to arouse .
the people cry when hearing sentimental ballasts , are abstracted by stories of overtaken difficulties , claiming to be firmly bound by the virtues of marriage and family life , but still not only the former raw material .
&quot; they have an unfortunate tendency to exaggerate , &quot; said their mentor when he read the whole report .
i suggest that you write less novels .
esme nussbaum lowered her head .
i must also ask : are you atheist ?
&quot; i do not think i have to say , &quot; esme nussbaum replied .
are you lesbian ?
again esme recalled her right to privacy and refusing to say .
feminist ?
again , silence .
&quot; i don &apos;t ask , &quot; said luther rabinowitz , &quot; because i am against atheism , lesbianism or feminism .
this is a prejudiced job .
we are serving a society without prejudice .
but certain types of hypersensitivity , which are in themselves absolutely acceptable and commendable , can result occasionally as you have presented .
you yourself have obviously taken prejudices against the church , and these things you call &apos; disgusting &apos; and &apos; raw &apos; could be used by others as well as an expression of natural strength and vitality .
if you continue on the path of what has happened when it happened , as if it were , you will be able to do it yesterday , and that means giving the country its essential vitality .
esme nussbaum looked around while rabinowitz spoke .
behind his head , an led lettering in flamingorosa repeated the advice that ofnow gave to the country in the last quarter of a century or more .
smile on your neighbour , value your partner , listen to ballads , visit musicals , use your phone , talk , explain your message , listen to , vote , and more .
speaking is better than silence , the healthy word is better than the written , but nothing is better than love .
&quot; i understand absolutely what you want to go out , &quot; esme nussbaum replied with a calm voice when she was sure that her superior had spoken to the end , &quot; and i say nothing other than that we are still secret .
my concern is that we are not being able to help us , without warning , to see how we are repeating the mistakes that have been made at all on what happened when it happened .
this time it is not the others that we are angry and distrust .
luther rabinowitz formed a pyramid with his hands .
to make an angel &apos;s patience possible .
&quot; they go too far , &quot; he said , &quot; if they are calling acts &quot; mistakes &quot; that our grandparents may or may not have committed .
they also go too far when they say that they are going to share their &quot; anger &quot; and their &quot; suspicion &quot; of &quot; others &quot; .
it should not be necessary to give someone in their position the reminder that we are not the same thing as in the case of the past as in the protection of the present .
there was no &apos; we &apos; and there were no &apos; others &apos; .
it was a time of disorder , that is all we know .
&quot; from the , if we are honest to ourselves , &quot; esme dared to inject &quot; no part of society can claim to have behave well .
i am not complaining to anyone .
whether it was done badly or well , what happened has happened .
that was then .
nothing more needs to be said about this - we agree on that .
and just as no blame must be assigned , so no blame must be repaid if a debt of this kind is appropriate and if it is a way to prevent it .
but what is the use of the past if we do not learn from it - and i am sure we will learn from it - if we do not learn from it - and we do not learn from it - and i am sure that this is not the case ?
the past serves to make us forget them .
if i may say something about this , i would like to say something about it .
luther rabinowitz let his pyramid collapse .
&quot; i will consider your report , &quot; he said and dismissed it .
the next day , when you went to work as usual , she was taken over by a motorcyclist who , as passers have described , was in a kind of &quot; brutal rage &quot; .
coincidences exist .
lesotho ’ s military member says that no coup is planned ; prime minister remains in south africa , while prime minister remains in south africa .
military officials in lesotho argue that a state coup to overthrow the government was planned .
prime minister thomas thabane fled the country and said that the country ’ s army had relocated to its seat and that government buildings in the capital , maseru , had been occupied .
the premier brought his family to the adjacent south africa after being attacked by threats of attack .
military spokesman major ntlele ntoi said that there is de facto no coup , but that the military is responding to the threat of &apos; political fanatics &apos; , whose reign of armament is under control .
&quot; what happened this morning was that the staff of defense forces of lesotho acted after having discovered several intelligence reports .
the south african government spokesman clayson monyela said that the military action was a relapse .
&quot; although no one has claimed that the government has been torn by violence , all the reports are agreed that the activities of the defense forces of lesotho have yet to show signs of a coup d &apos;état .
spokesmen for the military of lesotho announced on sunday that the soldiers had entered their barracks and the situation in the capital was calm .
meanwhile , vice premier mothetjoya metering takes over the leadership during thabanes ’ absence .
thabane announced that he believes he is unwilling to accept the government ’ s pledge to combat corruption .
in lesotho , there has been great tension since june , after thabane parliamentary meetings had been held because of the conflicts in his unity government .
he said that his actions should not have undermined the government , which is not the case .
production in the eurozone on a 13-month low
the increase in production in the eurozone slowed in august to the lowest point in the last 13 months , such a closely observed increase in the number of countries .
the final tag shopping index of the producer trade is marked by a &quot; buy &quot; index .
a value of 50 indicates an expansion .
new orders were withdrawn and factories suffered a drop in the face of rising tensions between the eu and russia over ukraine .
the figures are very clear before the european central bank ( ecb ) meeting on thursday .
markets expect the bank to provide a clear plan for dealing with a slow recovery in the eurozone , as well as for the imminent deflation of only 0.3 % inflation .
there is speculation that the ecb head , mario draghi , will be in a position to make further information later this week as to whether he will be able to provide quantitative easing for the eurozone , according to the united kingdom and the united kingdom .
&quot; although small growth is better than no growth , the braking effects of increasing economic and geopolitical uncertainties are not easy for producers to understand , &quot; said rob dobson , senior economist at mark .
factory pmi for germany , the largest trading partner of russia in the eu , fell to the bottom in 11 months with 51.4 .
meanwhile , the second world war fell by more than half , france , the plc , to 46.9 .
france remains a concern child , as does italy ’ s decline from a solid expansion to stagnant growth .
indications that growth stimulus in the key industry mechanism is germany , as well as spain and the netherlands , are also not reassuring , &quot; said mr dobson .
the decline in industry is likely to fuel the fire of analysts who are seeking further monetary or fiscal stimulus .
one positive news came from the republic of ireland , where the pmi rose to 57.3 , the highest level since the end of 1999 .
howard archer , chief economist at ihs global insight , said : &quot; the best thing you can do for the shopping mana index of the producer &apos;s business in the eurozone is august .
he added : &apos; eurozone producers find life at present quite difficult , as the current increases in geopolitical tensions - especially in terms of russia and ukraine - are uncertain in the continued difficult circumstances in many countries .
these increased uncertainties have clearly affected the economy - particularly , and the confidence of consumers , and presumably leads to some orders being delayed or even cancelled , particularly large orders .
he said that it is becoming &apos; increasingly likely &apos; that the ecb will eventually become a kind of qe , &apos; although we suspect that this is limited , it will be . &apos;
the hellfire of the survivors of beslan : ten years have passed since the terrible siege of school , as the people who were trapped in it are still suffering .
ten years ago , more than 1,000 people were killed by chechen militias in a school in beslan in southern russia .
more than 330 people , more than half of them children , were killed in the three-day martyrdom that shocked the world .
we returned to beslan to take some of the victims , who were killed by the grey army and the people who were killed in the classroom .
exactly a decade after the appalling siege of the beslan school , which claimed 334 lives , including 186 children , warned the heldenic survivors of the night before a new apocalypse .
as a fanatical islamist terrorist , children and parents were arrested on 1 september 2004 , the beginning of a new school year , and imprisoned , it seemed like the most evil of evil .
the tragedy united west and east in revulsion , and transformed the world into a more uncertain storm of pity and hope in the worst of misery .
ten years later we returned to beslan to take some of the victims , who were killed by the grey army .
we found surprising young people who had overcome resistance , although the memory of these terrorist caverns made them persecute for ever .
their greatest hope ?
that the war that is now raging ukraine - and in which children like them are dying - is now ending .
the girl who was photographed in an attempt to enter the torn school hall of fame was not able to see the light of day .
it was taken by the russian star photographer dimitri beliakov and famous when she was only in her underwear trying to get into the shattered school sports hall .
the first time aida was looking for her mother larissa , now 40 years old .
both were considered dead , but they survived .
&quot; a woman told me i should run for my life , but i could not , &quot; said aida back then .
my legs were flooded .
i stood up and climbed back to my mother to find .
a soldier brought them to safety .
after a series of operations , it was considered completely healed , but said yesterday : &apos; three months ago , the pain returned .
i am afraid i have to be operated again .
some shards of shells are still in my knee .
its goal is now to become a dentist to help people , as their health is helped by doctors .
&quot; this tragedy changed my life , but it did not break me , &quot; she says combat flux .
&quot; that happened to me and you cannot change that .
once a year i always go to the sports hall to remember those who have been there .
my friends and i try not to talk about it on other days .
the pain is too great .
my best friend and future classmate dzera gapoeva was there !
we played together when we were small , dreaming of being together at school .
&quot; i don &apos;t want to marry until i finish my studies and start my career .
i am thinking of a family later on .
it says that the siege is always part of it , although the memory is a little weaker every year .
i am glad that many people in the world still remember our horrors and we are so grateful for the help we have received from people in britain and everywhere .
when i see the photo of me online , how to go back to school , i think that many people it is the first time that we understand our catastrophe and help to prevent this happening again .
the boy who was thrown through the bullet hail , in the opinion that his mother was dead , was a child .
it was his first school day ( russians go to school at 7 years ) and survived the three-day siege in the arms of his mother tamara .
when he was seven , he said : &apos; mama told me i should go to the ground when there was an explosion , and their hands should be held &apos; .
after an explosion he thought she would die .
she said to him : &apos; run &apos; .
they are afraid that they may be dead , he fled and saw a crying infant on the way , took it by hand and fled through a bullet hail .
his father vladimir , who had his son out in the poor castle , said : &quot; damir told me that his mother had died .
he said : &apos; i could not save her &apos; .
in reality , tamara was stumbled out and injured with leg injuries in the hospital , in turn , assuming that her son had died .
after reunification , she said : &apos; i cry with joy .
i could not believe it .
he ran in and embraced me .
damir was later flown to london ( from the now unreleased newspaper news of the world ) to the premiere tony blair and his wife cherie .
&quot; this horror is following you every day , but i wish i could go on remembering , &quot; he said yesterday .
but i can say that in my memory it was getting worse .
i still know that i will be able to use all my toy pistols immediately afterwards .
but now i can play computer games with shooting scenes and this is no problem for me .
&quot; i am not afraid to enter the sports hall , but i do not think about myself .
i remember these children who i met in the courtyard and who did not go outside .
we never say that they were killed or dead .
we say that you will stay in the sports hall .
i remember very well my trip to london , especially the toy store , where i had to choose everything .
but now he is afraid of location like ukraine , where wars are the kind of misfortune that he and his friends have suffered .
this horror is following you every day , but i wish i could stop reminding me of this .
&quot; i am so sorry for all those who have suffered the abominations , &quot; damir said , who was working as a volunteer in a monastery last week .
i would like to help .
one day i want to go to the police and i hope that they will be able to take me to the school academy next year .
his mother tamara , 48 , said : &quot; 37 children from our neighbourhood were killed , they can imagine what it would be like ?
i remember the terrible silence after the siege that took place , there were simply no children calling and crying .
she vividly recalls her trip to london with damir .
the people of london crying when i told our story .
i understood then how people on the other side of the world could understand our feelings , and their support showed .
she was cherie blair and her foundation grateful for the prize and the opportunity to travel to london in autumn 2004 .
i wish i could call cherie and just tell her herself that 10 years have passed , but i am still going to meet her and her husband in london to remember how that happened .
i remember how damir likes to call borschtsch and she met all the local russian restaurants .
i remember how he worked with cellars in a restaurant , but damir was shocked by his water gun and they ran away .
and that was only one month after the horror .
i was surprised that the british were so willing to share our pain and support us .
she said , &apos; i always think that this world has not improved over these 10 years .
in ukraine , the war is now continuing , and people are dying every day , and i believe that many children have been killed and are still being killed .
these are just as children as ours .
i think that for many of the war is part of the news they hear when they are bored or with something else .
i simply know what these people feel , the whole horror .
and i cannot stop saying that .
nothing has changed , people still want to kill each other and that is so sad .
damir was large and is a very gentle and calm boy , he is not aggressive at all or angry .
for example , he is not looking for revenge , he is not overwhelmed by the past abominations .
i know he does not like to remember that , but he has six close friends from the class and they occasionally go to the sports hall and inflate there candles .
when he was smaller , he suffered - i remember how he was sometimes on the sound of a sofa , the face of us , hours of work .
not sleeping , his eyes were open .
i also remember how he all used his weapons and other military toys .
i can hardly believe that i have been so sure for a few hours that he was dead and i would never see him again .
when i recovered and was ready for the explosion , i saw for myself , and saw the hell around me , with everywhere .
i was absolutely sure that my little boy was unable to survive in this hell .
&quot; i remember having listened to him , &quot; daemir , lauf , lauf away &quot; , but i was also so sure that he did not hear me .
but he heard it and he has gone away .
and so life , unlike many others , goes on for us .
georgij ilyin , 17
the boy , whose terrible image after the siege became the symbol of the beslan atrocities , was born in the city of beslan .
consolation : the beslan survivor georgij lyin with his mother fatima after the siege of 2004 , right a picture of georgij today , right of georgij a picture of georgij today .
its blood-flooded face was characterized by fear when he was ranked for his life , while chechen terrorists lost his class cameramen .
his image was one of the most shocking symbols of the barbarism of beslan .
his mother fatima , 54 , a doctor , had invited him for his first day of school before she rushed to get her older son wladimir to university .
&quot; i left the farm about two minutes before the terrorists stormed it , and so the mine little boy remained there for three terrible days alone , &quot; recalls the man .
not entirely alone , there was a whole family of relatives of us , but they were all killed .
only my georgij managed to survive .
the closer this date is , the harder it is to think about it and talk about it .
there is not a single day on which we cannot remember this tragedy .
we do not think it is a long time ago , i think it had happened yesterday , some scenes from these days are following me forever .
no one will ever forget that , i promise you .
penetrating : the image of georgij ( left ) was one of the most shocking of the attack and was called statue ( right ) .
i remember georgij taking part in the meeting at school on that day , saying he wanted to give his teacher a hug .
i knew that he was alive , when i saw him on television .
and now there is even this statue of the weeping georgij in san marino .
georgij does not like the picture , and it is in our home bookshelf .
i understand that , but i also believe that people around the world , thanks to this picture , feel our pain .
georgij says today : &apos; it is important never to repeat this .
&quot; i doubt that we have ever learned the truth .
people are increasingly looking at such tragedies and never knowing the truth .
and now they are investigating the crash of this boeing in ukraine .
will we ever know what caused him ?
this world is becoming something terrible .
&quot; i cannot understand how this is possible , because if you ask people , nobody wants a war , so how is it done ?
ten years is not at all the same with such pain .
we need dozens of years to forget it a little .
it has attacked my health and i still feel it .
for about three or four years , i had some nightmares because of the siege , but then it became better .
i went back to school later in 2004 and was afraid every day .
i thought of my friends and classmates who were killed .
that is why i always go to the sports hall when 1 september approaches .
i want to thank my old childhood friends .
it is difficult for me to enter the sports hall , but i must do it .
i do not feel like a victim , this story is now part of my past .
i will not forget it , but i am not sorry .
my life goes on .
i finished school this year and i have visited a medical college in vladikawkaz .
i will be a cardiac surgeon .
my first choice was an education in the army .
i wanted to become a soldier , but my health did not allow it .
i wanted to fight for my country , but that will not happen .
georgij faniyev , 20 years old , 20 years old , has been a member of the european parliament .
the boy who survived , although he was at the foot of a murderous terrorist , was a man who was a prisoner .
a miracle : georgij faniyev was to be found at the foot of a murderous terrorist , but he did not manage to survive .
during the siege he was held in the sports hall and sat next to the bomb that was at the foot of a murderous terrorist .
it is a real miracle that he was not killed .
&quot; we feel it was yesterday that we said , &quot; georgij says , who was appointed intelligence officer of the fsb , but this was because of his health damage due to the siege .
it is still with me , it is nothing i have left behind .
i am now older and people say that children can easily cope with bad experiences - i must say that is not true .
&quot; in 2006 i worked with psychologists and felt a bit better after that , but i can not forget it .
i would like to forget that .
2005 - in the year after - was the first and only time i went back to the sports hall .
i lost consciousness .
i will never go back there again and please do not ask me to show you where i stand in this famous picture .
survivors : georgij faniyev today , with a photo of himself in hospital after the siege on the laptop .
my pain is immense and i wear it every day with me .
my friends know that i do not like to think about it or talk about it , and they never asked me about school .
physically , i am doing well .
i should be careful with my injured knee , but i can now run well .
but because of my health i could not attend the fsb secret service academy in st. petersburg , as i wanted .
i have received my documents , including medical documents , and you have replied that it is not possible .
my second passion was the animals , so i went to the veterinary institute .
i have been behind me for two years .
he learns the treatment of all animals &quot; from cats to cows &quot; .
he said : &apos; i knew i had never told my children of my experiences .
children should not know about this and they should not suffer from it , of course .
his mother marina , 42 , said : &quot; this pain never leaves me .
he is in my soul , worse when the anniversary approaches .
i will be invited to commemorate the commemoration ceremony .
i know that georgij will not go .
he still has to be much more violent because he was there and i was not .
i waited at home for him and could not help .
i am so grateful to god that he was returned to me , and here in beslan all of them are drawn .
it remains in us .
georgij is now an adult , but this horror is still in him .
it is difficult to accept this when something so unfair is being proposed .
he is a young , he likes sport , but he cannot participate because of his knees .
he has been operated several times , he can run , but he cannot do sport .
i would say that he has been 50 % horror , but one cannot say that entirely .
this terrible experience will always be with us .
many friends and neighbours were killed in the siege and this only reinforces my pain .
i have lost many people i knew well and who i was expensive .
my son is with me , and that is the greatest gift that god could make me , but my heart cries for the dead .
i know of families where new children were born , but also of widows who never again married .
it is difficult to accept that life should continue , even if we do not want it .
i will never forget how my heart jumped in me when i saw him in hospital .
and now i see what is happening in the world - wars in other regions .
what are these people fighting for ?
why are they killing each other ?
the war is now very close to our country and i almost cannot believe that .
we used to be a friendly country , how can it be that we are fighting now ?
people and children are suffering , i am sure that many children have already been killed in ukraine and many more are still being killed .
if we only attack all these rebels and throw them out - as far as possible .
aljona tskayeva , 10
the baby that is so attacking from a special mission command in safety is a very important part of the baby &apos;s life .
saved : aljona tskayeva is run by a russian special mission command ( left ) .
it is now ten ( right ) and does not remember the cruelty of the people of the united states at all .
the world held its breath in 2004 , when the baby aljona died in the arms of a russian policeman from the siege of beslan .
the terrorists let them go , but kept their 30-year-old mother , who was 10-year-old sister kristina and her brother makhar in school sports hall , in their cruelty .
makhar , then three years old , escaped , but aljonas mother and sister died in the murderous slaughter .
her father ruslan has since married again and has been with his new wife swetlana a a little girl who , after his lost daughter , cristina , has called him .
aljona , now ten years old , does not remember the siege and has become an intelligent and happy girl .
&quot; you are now a great happy family and aljona and makhar are both great children , &quot; says a close friend .
ruslan is a fantastic father and wants to give you all the memories that come with the tenth anniversary .
you will understand why .
we are accused of treating girls on pedestrian passage to fife .
a 78-year-old man is standing in the streets of the city because of the passing of a three-year-old girl .
gordon steward is accused of being a girl on the transition in pittenween in east neuk .
the charge , mr steward , stated that he had left his audi q3 without the necessary care and attention , and that the girl was injured .
stewart , 78 , from anstruther , stepped up the accusation against the dundee sheriff court .

i took these photos at a family party with several cameras , all at a price of less than $ 350 .
regardless of the equipment , there are some rules for the best results .
check your equipment twice .
even if you have a waterproof camera , make sure that the battery is not damaged or damaged .
set your camera to the photos or videos you want to record .
some cameras and camcorders have scene and recording modes , with which the occupants can adjust the exposure time for the twilight underwater conditions .
and before jumping in , check to which depth your equipment is functional .
some cameras are only allowed for 5 feet , others up to 50 or 60 feet .
search our shopping guide and the reviews for digital cameras for conventional and waterproof models .
take multiple shots - because many will not work .
point and shoot cameras have a lcd , which allows you to compile images .
even if you have an lcd , it is difficult to see it under water and the right image is a lucky case .
so you take a lot of pictures .
if your camera has a sequence mode with which a series of images can be taken with slightly changed exposure settings , use it .
stay close to the surface .
the light is dramatically worse the further it is away from the surface .
so , if possible , they will stay close to the surface when they take pictures in a pool , a lake or the sea .
this allows you to add more color to your photos ; the deeper you go , the less color you will see .
go close to the objects .
this is also good advice on land , but it is all the more important under water because of poor lighting conditions .
it is particularly important that you are connected to an action cam : these devices often have a fixed wide angle line. they are therefore suitable for all types of applications .
andrew lawson was a man of the variety whose character changes things , even in such a gigantic organization as the nhs .
as an advising anaesthesia doctor , he devoted his career to helping the sick both the agony of the disease and the agony of the treatment .
among his patients , his wife recalls , was a mi6 employee who was involved in the devastating effects of torture .
lawson knew that doctors would not be able to diagnose and diagnose diseases , while the overdose was largely accompanied by something else : pain .
one day in 2007 , however , he was the one whose path began .
&quot; i did not feel &quot; wrote the book in may of this year .
i had difficulty getting up .
while he was on the subject of flu similar symptoms , he noted that he was telling his wife juliet impatiently .
&quot; i want everything to be done now , &quot; he noted .
as juliet for a week on a business trip , lawson felt very unusual in feeling uncomfortable and uncomfortable .
something was in the air .
he asked a colleague to send an x-ray investigation of his breast .
only two weeks ago he was in the french alps for skiing .
the result of the x-ray inspection was available .
he suffered from mesotheliom , an incurable cancer that caused the breast skin , that is , the lungs overdrawing skin .
as with most cancers , the exact cause is usually difficult to determine .
for example , while some smokers are suffering from lung cancer , not all lung cancer sufferers have been smokers in the past .
but mesotheliom is different .
in almost all cases , the trigger is an asbestos load - contact with the fibre construction material , which was once known as &quot; miracle &quot; but has now been recognized as fatal .
for most of us , mesotheliom is a disease that can easily be ignored .
asbestos is , after all , a product of the past .
the most dangerous type of asbestos has not been used in britain since the 1960s when the industry voluntarily committed to ceasing to use it .
even where it has been used , only people in certain sectors have worked directly with the fabric - plumbers , builders , carpentry and shipyard workers , for example .
as an industrial hazardous material from another time , it seems to be hardly even more worrying today .
but this complacency is inappropriate .
britain , it seems , is now at the height of a mesoltheliom epidemic .
there are more fatalities from mesotheliom here than in any other country in the world .
with 2,500 deaths per year , twice as many people die from this disease as in road accidents .
annual figures of the fatalities of the mesothelioma since 1980 and anticipated future deaths in the uk
the reason we have now seen the lethal effects , although asbestos has been illegal for years ( in 1999 all types of asbestos were banned ) , is that a mesotheliom is only developing after decades .
and the scourge of mesotheliom is not due to former construction workers .
asbestos was , and is often still present , in the houses in which we live , the offices in which we work , the schools where we learn and the shops in which we shop .
and therefore mesotheliom knows no class barriers , financial limits , professions or age .
the privileged bastions , from the elegant department stores in london to private schools , are not a shelter .
the parliament buildings are contaminated with asbestos .
in hospitals , where we are healthy , too , there are already many people who are starting to use this deadly carcinogenic gene .
andrew lawson was not old .
nor was he a plumber .
he did indeed find it difficult to imagine where he might be dealing with asbestos .
then he found out .
&quot; it looks like the tunneling on the guy &apos;s hospital , where i have been for six years , is a very interesting experience .
all - students , nurses , doctors and pastors - use the tunnel .
one wonders how many of my contemporaries will suffer from the same disease ?
unfortunately , he was able to answer that question at least in part .
&quot; of the four doctors who were on guy &apos;s hospital , the number of patients in the last five years was about 5 % .
how many of us will still be ill ?
andrew lawson was born in the age of 48 .
when he was killed on 17 february of this year , he was 55 .
this was an unusually long survival time .
fifty per cent of all mesothelioid diseases die within 8 months of diagnosis .
the disease always ends fatally .
we can therefore only repeat lawson &apos;s question : &apos; how many of us will still be ill ? &apos;
the uk &apos;s leading expert on mesotheliom , professor julian peto , assumes that between 1870 and 2050 , when asbestos ideals were in the uk , it would probably be a halt .
most of them have no idea at the moment that they will die like this .
an asbestos mine in quebec , canada alamy , canada alamy , canada , alamy , canada , alamy , canada , alamy , canada , alamy , and the usa
a quick look at the files of the courts to which the persons concerned often referred for damages claims shows how far the intellectual property scourge of the mesotheliom is already widespread .
in june this year marks &amp; spencer , for example , admitted that janice was negligently exposed to asbestos .
she worked for nine years for the chain , from 1978 to 1987 , and was responsible for the garment department at two locations - one of which is the flagship store in oxford street .
mrs. allen was only 18 years old when she started her activity at m &amp; s .
now she has two children in the twenties .
&quot; before this thing , &quot; she says , &quot; i had never heard of mesotheliom , i did not even know anything about asbestos .
i never thought that this would affect me .
there are few people who know a lot about asbestos .
the fact is that the term asbestos does not confine itself to a substance , but to a group of six minerals .
the name derives from the word &quot; asbestiform &quot; , a description of the fibre structure that makes the fabric resistant and flexible .
three of the six were used in the construction industry .
chrysotile , also known as white asbestos , is by far the most common form of asbestos found in buildings today .
it is designed for roofing , floor tiles , pipe solations , boilerisations , even for brake coverings in cars .
it is less fatal than other forms of asbestos , but it is still regarded by the eu and the who as &apos; great health risk &apos; with possible death .
but the brown asbestos ( amosit ) and the blue asbestos ( crokydolith ) are more dangerous .
britain was once the world ’ s largest importer of brown asbestos , and experts suspect that &quot; it has clear but indirect evidence that this is a major reason for the uniquely high mesotheliomation rates . &quot;
a mark &amp; spencer employee was registered in the flagship store in oxford street , london , asbestos exposed alamy to alamy .
janice allen may not have proven to be a typical mesotheliomoper , but the work of julian peto suggests that the truth is not its story .
he has presented a study by the stakeholders , which shows that &apos; a significant proportion of the mesotheliomes are affected without known interruption by work or in the house probably by asbestos contact in the environment &apos; .
much of these contacts , he says , are based on &quot; normal use and aging &quot; of our buildings .
it looks as if no one can assume that they are safe .
a report by goddard consulting , which describes the palace of westminster , shows how people can also live in the heart of the government , unknowingly exposed to the substance .
in 2009 , goddard reported that service packs and pipelines were behind the committee rooms of parliament with asbestos , whose deaths were fatal due to something as harmless as the &apos; strong air movements &apos; .
members of parliament are often accused of taking care of their own interests , but here it seems that they are not doing the opposite .
while the directorate of the parliamentary labour service insisted that the westminster palace should be a &apos; clean health certificate &apos; , it is now undeniable that 1 billion £ of work is spent over several years .
the goddard report also pointed out that &apos; the existence of asbestos cannot be regulated in accordance with the relevant provisions &apos; .
no one can know whether this mismanagement will cost lives .
all you can do now is wait .
a person who has never exactly determined contact with asbestos is graham abbott , a general practitioner .
as andrew lawson suspects , the 50-year-old abbott , that he would be exposed to asbestos during his work in hospitals .
&quot; i worked in a hospital where asbestos complaints were positively decided , &quot; he says , &quot; but i can not do it in my case .
it is so difficult to remember all the places where you worked , and to the data .
what he remember very well is the day in early december 2009 , when he had such a fever .
he was 45 and led an operation just late in the evening .
suddenly i had shaken .
it happened suddenly .
i felt horrible .
i thought that the journey home was no longer a job .
as a doctor , abbott knew that the pain of the chest coat , the skin around his lungs , was stirring .
but , like janice allen , he had no reason to suspect a mesotheliom .
he did not go to work for a month .
amazingly , doctors made x-ray pictures of his breast and put pleurakathether on to extract liquid from the lungs and to work in the laboratory .
his complaints , however , remained undiagnosed .
his health improved slowly , and he returned to his job .
from time to time , however , the symptoms returned , often after sporting activity and stiff attitudes .
in 2011 , a patient abbott with similar symptoms came to his practice and was later diagnosed with mesotheliom .
but also now , abbott did not combine this with his own case .
after all , his patient was a few decades older and had worked directly with asbestos .
the connection in that case was clear .
in september 2011 , abbott ’ s condition deteriorated again , and his general practitioner brought his ct scans and x-ray images to a group of experts .
in december 2011 , exactly two years after abbott first became ill , he was able to make a decision on the sony ericsson s720 , equipped with a camera .
i am an optimist .
i usually go on , &quot; he says .
to be honest , i had not been so concerned about it .
but rachel , my wife , was worried .
the result of biopsy was in the week between christmas and new year : &quot; i was told that there was mesotheliom . &quot;
graham abbott : diagnosis of mesotheliom
suddenly , abbott had appointments with macmillan nurses , one of whom recommended that he take a lawyer , and that he should not be allowed to do so .
only now did he understand the extent of the epidemic .
&quot; it turned out that asbestos was very common , especially in large public buildings where pipes were often filled with asbestos , &quot; he says .
the people who are exposed to asbestos in these buildings are now suffering .
and so mesotheliom now meets younger people who are not working in the typical professions .
the most dangerous pipes with asbestos insulation in hospitals were below the earth , so patients were probably not exposed to the substance .
but many employees who work in pedestrian tunnels from one building to another ( such as andrew lawson ) or in underground areas of canteen adian ( such as graham abbott often did ) , are not able to do so .
it is clear that , over several decades after the war , hospitals may have been life-saving for patients , but they have been life-threatening for the doctors who treat them .
it is still being removed today .
students presented their bunsenbrenner on asbestos mats .
it does not just concern hospitals .
asbestos was developed because of its fabulous insulating properties and flame retardants in offices , shops , libraries and city halls .
schools are also involved .
indeed , many people probably have the first asbestos contact in the classroom .
throughout the country , in thousands of hours of chemistry , students have their bunsenbrenner disks placed on asbestos mats .
on websites asbestos is now frequently addressed in schools .
and so innocent objects have been found in our homes , such as flooring or shingle blankets , by default .
&quot; it is an industrial poison that is contained in much of our property , &quot; says andrew morgan , lawyer , who is andrew lawson in his trial against guy &apos;s-hospital .
in one case , the only contact that was made to a woman concerned was to demolish a shed in the 1970s .
so watch out for your shells .
the effects of diagnosis , and knowing that the disease is incurable , is immense .
&quot; it takes a while to process it , &quot; says graham abbott .
i went back to work and tried to continue , but i realized that i was not on the focus .
i was in practice for two weeks .
then i knew that i would go and take care of myself .
well , i will not be able to experience another christmas .
the most difficult aspect was the change of perspective from the position of a doctor to that of a patient .
how countless patients before him he remembers how overwhelmed he is by all the information he has been able to get .
&quot; it was very difficult to include all of this , &quot; he says .
&quot; i asked my doctor &quot; how long do i have ? &quot;
and i was given about 12 months .
i remember having thought that &quot; well , i &apos;m going to not have another christmas party , i &apos;ll be watching .
that was then . &apos;
mesotheliom is particularly insidious because it is our life preservation mechanism - the breathing itself - that is causing fatal cancer .
most cases of mesothelioma are caused by asbestos contact .
asbestos is made up of smallest fibres .
when asbestos is unleashed and the fibres are inhaled , they can be found in the chest skin , the skin around the lungs .
asbestos fibres irritate the breast skin and can trigger cell mutations .
&quot; the problem arises with the inhaled coniferous fibres , &quot; says professor tom treasure , a heart-throat specialist .
it is precisely the hospital that andrew lawson suspects will be able to exposed to asbestos that is now ironically a leading centre for the treatment of mesothelioma .
treasure knew lawson and treated the people of the island , who probably also had to be in hospital during their training .
once the asbestos needles reach the lung tissue , says treasure , &quot; they will be taken from the respiratory process to the edge , where the skin is .
by its very nature , it is invasive from the outset .
the usual options for other cancers work in mesotheliom not so well .
the effectiveness of an operation is , for example , highly controversial .
some say that it is worth trying .
treasure denies this .
&quot; you can &apos;t remove the chest coat , &quot; he says .
they do not get around with the knife .
meanwhile , cancer speaks &quot; on chemotherapy &quot; not very well , &quot; the &quot; effect &quot; but does not heal .
&quot; sometimes there are long-term survivors , &quot; says treasure .
but in the end they all die .
fortunately , some patients actually live long , much longer than expected .
the author stephen jay gould died 20 years after the diagnosis .
two and a half years after his own diagnosis , graham abbott is still fighting .
after contacting mesotheliom , abbott came into contact with andrew lawson , who was diagnosed with a one-man surgeon and counseling office four years after his diagnosis .
&quot; hello , cancer centre , &quot; he stood up for calls while he was happy .
&quot; he was very positive , &quot; says abbott .
he had made his diagnosis 4 years earlier and was still very active .
the first group of companies to be established was the abbott group , which had been offering six chemotherapy cycles , which would probably only last four months and would probably only extend its life by one month .
&quot; i was desperate , &quot; he says .
i wanted to give up .
lawson managed to &quot; make things in a slightly more positive light &quot; , however .
after consulting several doctors , abbott decided to continue his treatment with prof. loic lang-lazdunski , herz-thorax specialist at the guy &apos;s .
&quot; we had an advantage by not being able to be further redirected , i just called and got an appointment , &quot; says graham .
a normal patient would receive a referral and would be waiting for the treatment to be approved .
money is crucial for mesotheliom-sufferers to obtain the best available therapies .
but when these treatments eventually fail , they are likely to be a source of another financial concern - about the future of families , about the future of families they leave behind .
and so they turn to the courts in the hope of compensation .
andrew lawson contacted andrew morgan of field fisher watch .
&quot; it has been known since 1898 that asbestos is extremely dangerous for health , &quot; says morgan .
but what happened in the 1960s was that we realized that the world was also very low .
and here the negligence of companies began to play a role .
andrew lawson and guy &apos;s hospital put their case to the end , but it was not what morgan had called a &quot; full compensation &quot; .
after the investigation into his death , a guy &apos;s spokesman confirmed that &quot; the asbestos fibres in the affected cellar area were not removed in the 1990s . &quot;
this was a very late event for andrew lawson .
how to remove asbestos
indeed , it is not easy for people with a mesotheliom to seek compensation to be confronted with a huge problem , namely the deadly asbestos contact between a company or a workplace - usually decades after the events .
many of their former employers have been sold or closed .
insurance documents may be lost .
and those who oppose claims know that the us is not the time to do so , but certainly not the plaintiffs .
in response to this , there have been significant new legislation this year that has allowed people affected by mesotheliom to receive compensation .
the law has a patent system promoted by the insurance industry of £ 350 million for all who are to be diagnosed after july 2012 , a contact that is not yet available to anyone .
in these cases , plaintiffs receive 80 % of what a court can do in a normal compensation process - say , 120,000 £ .
about 300 successful applications for the programme are expected to be submitted annually .
andrew morgan , like so many people affected by the mesotheliom , thinks that £ 350 million is a &quot; very good job &quot; for the insurance industry .
&quot; this is a deal for insurers , &quot; he says , and suggests that the insurance industry is a global deal .
mike penning , who was then working and pension ministers , also admitted that the law &quot; not perfect &quot; was .
but both penning and morgan admitted that , with seven deaths on a daily basis , rapid action is needed .
&quot; people suffer so much and need help today , &quot; said penning during the second hearing of the mesotheliom law in december last year .
at that time , graham abbott had been in the hands of prof. loic lang-lazdunski for 19 months .
after their initial discussions , lang-lazdunski recommended an operation that , unlike tomsk treachure , would have a positive effect .
this was done by radiation therapy and chemotherapy - a triple therapy .
abbott felt stronger .
&quot; this is of course the most important , &quot; says abbott .
this is evident time and again in patients .
there is something that will keep you going .
if you give up , you will get worse very quickly .
graham abbott underwent the operation in march 2012 .
at the end of august , he had the last of the six chemotherapy cycles behind him .
the following year , the company was awarded the &quot; best of the year &quot; award .
then in march 2014 i had a scan .
there were several cancer spots around my breast .
i have just been 50 .
this is not life-threatening .
this is a life-ending exercise .
again , abbott underwent six chemotherapy cycles .
now there is no longer a trace of tumours .
but the process is physically and mentally very exhausting .
they must think of practical things - about money , if i am no longer , for example , or my wife , show how to set the boiling time works .
if you receive bad news , you will be negative .
they must look to the future .
as the father of ellie , 16 , and tamsin , 14 , this is not always easy .
&quot; this is difficult for parents , &quot; he says .
it is hard to know what to say and how much .
when i received my first diagnosis , i told my girls that i had a disease with which i would not grow old .
they reacted in very different ways .
tamsin is very sociable and impatient .
she told her to her friends and we soon got a lot of calls .
ellie was more cautious .
she did not say much .
such talks are something that affects all cancer patients .
but for mesotheliologian diseases such talks have not been driven by hope , not by a trace of hope for survival .
the disease ( as well as eventually also for stephen jay gould ) brings a grim security .
as andrew morgan says , &quot; mesotheliom is not life-threatening .

china is refusing hong kong to be entitled to government elections , demonstrators swear retaliation , and retaliation .
on sunday , despite the increasing number of calls for democratic reforms , the chinese parliament decided against nominating candidates for the 2017 elections by the hong kong electorate .
this is probably the most likely way of fuelling the long-announced protests in hong kong ’ s business district , while activists are blocking planning and mobilisation within hours of the announcement .
the decision of the people ’ s congress in china basically allows communist leaders to ignore all non-peking-loyal candidates .
&quot; this is not unexpected , but it makes us angry , &quot; said right-wing expert emily lau , chairman of the democratic party .
that is not what beijing had promised .
the people of hong kong have been lied to .
and it is clear that we are dealing with an authoritarian regime .
in defending china ’ s decision , li fei , deputy secretary general of the standing committee of the national people ’ s congress , said that the approval of public nominations in the hong kong government was too &quot; chaotic &quot; .
since 1997 , when britain lost control of hong kong , the chinese have been forgiven for promising to leave the inhabitants of hong kong to take over the government from 2017 .
china ’ s leaders presented sunday ’ s decision as a democratic breakthrough , because it gave hong kong citizens direct voting rights , but the decision also makes it clear that china ’ s leaders are not going to change the process through a tightly controlled beijing mini-.
a new clause also states that candidates should only be &apos; with love for the country and love for hong kong &apos; .
the decision follows a summer in which some of the largest and most public-spirited protests in hong kong have been taking place for a number of years .
behind the prodemocratic campaign in hong kong is the occupy central movement with love and peace , whose organizers have been threatened with a further increase in the financial district .
on sunday evening , in a few hours &apos; time , hundreds of people from occupations had been arrested and sentenced to death by the police and the police in front of the hong kong headquarters .
the organizers said at the demonstration that their movement needed a new stage of civil disobedience and that they would be protesting in the coming weeks .
they did not give any details on this , however , apparently to avoid problems with the authorities .
in an online communication , the organizers said that the movement &quot; the occupation of the central district only as a last resort to consider , a campaign that was only possible if the central district is fully integrated into the system .
sorry , we have to say that all the opportunities for dialogue have been exhausted today and the occupation of the central district has definitely taken place .
the hong kong authorities have been focusing for days on the beijing announcement that they will be meeting the beijing conference on sunday .
the unrest is caused by the feeling of many in hong kong that they are slowly losing control of their city .
the influx of people from mainland increases competition for products and services .
moreover , there is growing fear that hong kong ’ s values of democracy and freedom of speech will be undermined by growing pressure from beijing .
some criticized the demonstrations of the occupy central movement , as they were threatening the business - the lifeline of hong kong .
&quot; the protests they talk about could have major economic damage , depending on how many people are involved and how long they are going to last , &quot; said right-wing expert regine ip , who was driving the movement for a long time .
we do not want to raise any fears that hong kong will get out of hand .
this impression is bad for investment .
the state-controlled media in china also recently reported about the democratic activists in hong kong as being viewed by western powers .
this summer , activists organised an unofficial referendum on the right to vote , involving 780,000 people - more than one fifth of the electorate in hong kong .
in july , tens of thousands took part in one of the largest democracy demonstrations in the region ’ s history .
the tradition of school leaving balls in the us is now being transferred to universities where freshmen perform with the private aircraft .
we are looking forward to being able to respond to this demand and to the first luxury uk travel service for students of today .
to make a particularly impressive performance at the university , the company also offers transport options such as private aircraft , rolls-royce phantom , aston marten or mclaren p1 .
mr stewart also stated that the service is a security area .
this service is an ideal alternative for students who would otherwise have to leave their habitats in a dangerously overloaded car through the country .
together with our new vif options , we look forward to making sure that the students get to know the university with a minimum of effort and maximum efficiency .
a company spokesman said that no new bookings have been made , as the service has only just been introduced , but added that the &quot; students will not be able to use the service in the next few weeks &quot; .
the company also announced that , despite tuition fees , it had increased from £ 9,000 per year to a market for this offer .
students today differ in their expectations and requirements from students 10 years ago , 20 , 30 or 40 years ago - it is more important than ever to get a great first impression and to be able to do exactly that with vif .
the national student union criticised service as being out of the question .
megan dunn , vice president of the nus for higher education said : &quot; this offer seems to be completely separate from the life of most students .
many students who started their studies this month face a crisis in the cost of living , as the available financial assistance in the form of loans and grants is insufficient .
feminists criticize race issues and police behavior after ferguson
the unarmed teenager was arrested earlier this month by a police officer in ferguson , mo .
the participants raised their hands and sang , &quot; hands high , not shoot , &quot; while they were waiting for the funeral .
after two weeks of protests in ferguson , mo , because of the shooting of the unarmed teenager michael brown , the blogger noticed milosevic &apos;s death .
according to their experience , white feminist commentators are putting sex before the race when it comes to reproductive rights and income inequalities .
while tension in the middle west has increased and has been heeded throughout the country , perez has seen that the answers from white women are 100 % racial .
compared to the answers given by black women shortly after the shots of 9 august , personal essays with titles such as &quot; thoughts to ferguson by a white woman &quot; and &quot; feminism is not only about oppression .
but for perez , this was an important change .
&quot; i do not believe that feminism can find many people who know and enjoy privileges on such high-class forms .
people felt urged to do something about the incidents .
it is characteristic of the crisis we are experiencing and because the situation in ferguson is so ethnicized that it does not need to express it .
for english professor koritha mitchell of ohio state university , he brought ferguson ’ s problems to light that black americans face every day , which are not considered &quot; women &apos;s theories &quot; .
&quot; i can do something funny on facebook about me and my partner and get 150 likes from anywhere , &quot; said mitchell .
if i post something about how colored in your own country are under siege , the silence of ears is not the only thing i can hear .
&quot; how can it be safe for women to talk publicly about a relationship , but not about public security ? &quot; she asked .
for black women like mitchell , the race , sex and sexuality in the history of the us , there is no dichotomy between race and sexual orientation .
for them , black women have not had the luxury of keeping the issues clean ; they live every day in the combined reality .
while white women are now discussing race and gender issues in feminist mainstream circles , the angela hattery says , professor of racial and gender research , at george mason university .
&quot; between 1865 and 1890 , at least 10,000 black men were gelyncht and the justification was almost always the rape of a white woman , &quot; said hatry .
white women have had to be involved in history in order to justify lynchkillings .
for hattory , the white and black women split at the point where white fighters were fighting for women ’ s electoral law , such as susan b. anthony , in the late 1900s analyzed the country and analyzed it .
&quot; they decided to opt for women &apos;s electoral rights , and the right to vote for black should come later , &quot; said hattory .
if you remember such things , you are powerfully aware of why women in colour do not trust white women .
we did not do our job well .
we have never helped black women to protect their husbands and sons .
even after women had the right to vote in 1920 , it took another decade for white women to resist lynch in the association .
the group was established almost 40 years after the original request for assistance from black women , says mitchell .
for mitchell , the flood of white feminist reactions to the issues raised by ferguson - police behaviour , racial discrimination - is a mirror of the time when white feminists were caught &quot; capturing &quot; .
&quot; would it not be great if the activists who have such traditional feminist platforms had the right to education a child ?
feminists of the second generation , who have been reproducing their careers in the struggle for reproductive rights and access to contraceptive means , are now trying to understand what that means .
the famous white feminist activist gloria steiner went to the streets two weeks after the shooting of michael brown .
&quot; i hope that women who have a different but parallel reason to be a member of the body are not exposed to this risk - and opinions on rapid reaction , which is not the case in public surveys - will understand the changes .
although steiner is in favour of more intersectional feminism , in which race as well as gender issues are addressed , some of her comments on racial issues are not yet hidden in america .
christina sommer , researcher at the american enterprise institute and author of &quot; who stole feminism ? &quot; said to her the peopole that young men in the united states , especially young farmers .
there are now hundreds of special programmes for girls and young women , but almost nothing for boys .
but when the white house recently launched a small program , my brother &apos;s keeper , it put in order to protect vulnerable young black and hispanic men , there were annoying reactions from many feminists , including women .
the relationship between the police and the black community is not the only problem that has come to the fore in mainstream feminism .
after the us border police have killed almost 63,000 unaccompanied minors on the country ’ s southwest border this year , the issue of immigration reform is also returning to the surface - this time as a women ’ s issue .
andrea mercado , co-chairman of we belong together , an organization that provides women with a job in immigration reform , said that for a new look at the subject , it is essential to have women as an essential issue .
&quot; they speak for themselves , &quot; mercado said .
if the vast majority of working visas are sent to male immigrants , women , who are accompanying them , are in a position where they are responsible for domestic violence and exploitation .
&quot; these stories find a sustainable contribution to women &apos;s organisations , &quot; she said .
&quot; schweine-haus &quot; in ipswich is for sale in ipswich .
the image of a house for sale was removed by real estate agents when it became clear that there was a large pig that it could easily be made in the living room .
the detached house has one bedroom , is located on a private street in ipswich and is offered for 120,000 £ .
the details included a picture of the living room of the house - including a pig .
real estate agents connells said that the pig on the photo is the pet of the owner .
&quot; the photo was erroneously published and was removed &quot; said a spokesman of the company .
the hotel ’ s exposure described connells as the former meeting house as a “ unique ” simple family house .
although the broker has removed the image from the website , it still appears on advertising material .
the sale of homes caused interest in the social media when some asked whether the pig was in the purchase price .
the sw city of harvey is home to a new million dollar after lottery win .
a harvey lottery player is scheduled to be released this month .
the search for a new millionaire in the southwest of perth is on , with a happy winner who has left the lottery on saturday almost $ 1.1 million .
a newspaper kiosk in harvey moved for the second time in five years to the jackpot in drawing the first division , after 1 million $ in november 2009 .
the lucky winner must still report .
the shopkeeper steve forward said that the profit is a source of conversation in the small town in the southwest of perth .
the city talks about nothing else , and all are quite excited .
we thought that such a profit could come into being .
eight wa winners have won prizes in the first division last month , a chargeable deal for a few happy weeks for the players in the state .
last week , a canning vale player was one of the five millionaires in august , after a couple from belmont had just received the mega win of $ 7.5 million a few weeks earlier .
the winning couple had been playing for twenty years and said that the profit allows you to travel around the world and buy a new house .
the millionaire from harvey is the 59th winner of the first division in the wa this year , with a total of almost $ 85 million .
leonidas asked for the gladiatorium arena in the city .
not only the gladiators were on the ankle low in the matsch at the first rhineland roman day in the amusement park .
but the attraction of the event was strong enough to be able to attract more than 1000 visitors yesterday who were watching the rain showers and the autumn cold .
there was a colorful set of representations , performances , games , exhibits and information about the time of the romans and their importance to the rhineland .
the main attraction of the day was undoubtedly the martialistic fighter force of the gladiator school &quot; amor mortis &quot; , which was able to make use of every rainy break to live with soft sand .
gladiatorist &quot; leonidas &quot; proved to be a humorous and knowledgeable presenter and sent his men to the ring to the heroic two-way battle in various gladiator engators .
first , the &quot; provocateurs &quot; were in turn with a rectangle shield and short sword as well as leg rail on the left leg and arm rail on the right arm .
the &quot; essedarii &quot; followed with breast shield , short sword and throwing lanze , and iron gladiator helmet , leg- and arm helmet .
the performance of the &quot; retirement age &quot; was particularly impressive , with a roll of throws , triple and dolch against the &quot; secutor &quot; and followed a short fight with the burscher .
the swords of the swords clash metallic , the shields shemales and the throwing lances flown surreptiously through the arena that is going to be afraid for the health of the gladians .
but on that one had to wait the imposing &quot; summa rudis &quot; , the muscular referee , an always attentive eye .
&quot; we wanted to rediscover the everyday life of rome and to rediscover the culture of roman times &quot; , said lorenz euskirchen , chairman of the &quot; friends of the roman society &quot; .
after two years of preparation , the theme park became a &quot; opportunistic &quot; for a day , a roman city .
after all , the romans not only fought war and conquest in our region , but also the roman culture and numerous monuments that we still admire today .
the remains of this were also to be seen at the roman day , such as &quot; aqueduct marble &quot; from the eleven metre high and 1,400 meters long roman canal bridge , which was once built in vütelberg .
the frontinus company presented the water and energy supply once and now , and managing director petra fricke knew : &quot; we are still using the internet today to gain advantage from the knowledge of then &quot; .
this also confirms diplom-surveyor ralph saints of the &quot; engineerteamztwo &quot; from rheinbach , the measurement instruments of the romans such as chorobat , groma or dioptra .
the romanesque villa in blankenheim presented sketches and models of excavations anno 1894 and bricks from the original hypocaste , the hot lubrication , the old one .
the footprints , which are taken by wolf and fuchs two millennia ago in the footsteps of clay , were also impressive before they burned .
in 2011 , the landmark management office had a number of outstanding remains of a roman villa in the industrial park of nord in rhinbach .
they have built fencing walls of an economic building with a darrage for drying cereals and for mowing .
the building probably belonged to a villa rustica , an agricultural estate , explained the archaeologist dr. jennifer morschiser .
a number of finds from these excavations were found in a glass tray , including a large glass plate , several finds of fine glass , and parts of a delicate brick chain .
the villa was probably built from the first to the fourth century after christ , until the first germans arrived in the then roman rhineland , presumably morschiser .
the children also worked with the roman windmill game , similar to the current mill game , or they did not write as the roman windmills once did .
at the stand of the roman thermal baths zülpich the children were allowed to lay mosaics themselves , at the stand of the glass museum rheinbach glasmosaics and at the stand of the nature centre eifel nettersheifel nettersheiheim serve a .
the two cold blossoms of the original , faithfully reconstructed roman vans , have brought visitors to the park and came to the impressive castle stand .
with a week of rome from 13 to 21 september , the municipality of wachtberg will also be able to enter the rhineland roman year 2014 , which is due to the death of emperor augustus 2000 years ago .
together with the country ’ s national and historical associations and the wachtberger wander-association , the partnership association and the laienspielkreis oberbachem , thematic hikes , lectures , cooking evenings and lectures are offered .
for example , a roman legionnaire is being held back by his work on the zugenen wachtberg , and plants are being presented as living monuments from roman times and a funny lesson in international understanding .
the adendorfer primary school is dedicated to the development of the roman topic within the framework of a project week .
the roman week is intended to bring to an end the numerous , but often no longer visible , traces of the romans in wachtberg .
the wachtberger rathaus presents a small presentation to the fund of the berkum matron sanctuary in 1879 .
ebola : the epidemic is burdening west africa ’ s economy with its economy , and the economy is bursting west africa ’ s economy with the epidemic .
the ebola epidemic in west africa is also a serious blow to the economy .
markets are orphaned - and international companies are distancing themselves .
the devastating ebola epidemic is putting a heavy blow to the west african economy .
the harvest is rotting in the fields that are deserted and the markets orphaned - the virus has caused a great deal of damage to the region .
some international companies are also already distancing themselves from this .
&quot; the ebola epidemic is not only a medical crisis , but also an economic one , &quot; judged by the head of the african development bank , donald kaberuka .
liberia is the hardest hit
&quot; it is a total disaster , we lose a lot of money , &quot; says alhaji bamogo , who is on the second largest market in liberia &apos;s capital , monrovia , selling clothes .
the only way to get on the market is to use food or something to disinfect ebola .
liberia is the hardest hit by the virus , alone here fell fiber more than 600 people to be killed .
recently , the health authorities stated that the disease is spread across every corner of the country .
in guinea , sierra leone and nigeria , the virus has spread .
in total , more than 1500 people have died , thousands more have died .
foreign companies prefer employees to be members of staff .
throughout resource-rich countries , companies are running their business .
foreign companies such as the steel group arcelor mittal are withdrawing their employees , several international airlines are no longer flying to the affected regions .
local traders and farmers are also responding : few merchants are left to leave their homes to buy supplies .
in some areas of sierra leone and liberia , which are quarantine , the number of people responsible for exporting is declining .
farmers dare not pay their own home for the harvest .
food is scarce
&quot; people are going to travel less and less &quot; , says phillipe de vreyer , paris expert for the economy of west africa .
the man , for example , who normally goes to the market and sells his vegetables , would rather stay at home .
the population is therefore feeling the direct and urgent consequences of the epidemic : food is scarce .
markets are being shut down by stocks of basic foodstuffs such as rice .
at the same time , the region , which is heavily dependent on international companies , is threatening to damage its image - with far-reaching consequences .
the biggest danger is that international companies will be able to avoid the area for a long time , says philippe hugon of the french think tank iris .
the crucial factor is how far and how long the virus will spread .
investors might get the impression that &quot; it is dangerous to invest in guinea , sierra leone , and liberia , and thus to invest , &quot; says hugon .
the disease also affects the hard-pressed national budgets of the states , which are the ones that are the ones that are suffering from the disease , in the states of the member states , and the states that are hard hit by it .
the disease also affects the already harsh national budgets of the countries concerned .
the rating agency moody &apos;s fears that the latter &apos;s budget will be heavily dependent on the high spending on the health system and , in addition , on the deteriorating economy .
the african development bank has already promised to provide health care systems in the countries concerned with usd 60 million ( eur 45 million ) .
the effects are also visible in nigeria , where only a few ebola cases have been diagnosed so far .
while the oil-rich region in the southern niger delta has not been affected so far .
but elsewhere , many people are already left out of fear of contagion .
reservations in hotels are also falling sharply .
protect your 50th anniversary from the start of the year !
the schützenverein &quot; tannenwald &quot; berngau celebrates its 50th anniversary from 12 to 14 september .
on high tours , the schüttenverein tannenwald is preparing for the 50th anniversary of the foundation of the festival from 12th to 14th september .
the plan is to be signed on friday , september 12 , a great evening of entertainment with the group &quot; dorfrocker &quot; .
on saturday at 6 p.m. the big böllerschußen is open .
then the tent is placed in the big fence with the &quot; stoapfalzer spitzbuam &quot; .
blaskapelle is a brass band that provides music and music for the music .
highlights on sunday are the festival service and 9.30 a.m. in the parish church and the great feast at 2 p.m.
in the afternoon , the federal and gauge price is also distributed .
a particularly beautiful view will be provided by the 25 ladies with their dirndln .
festkapelle is the ballaskapelle berngau .
the patron was mayor wolfgang wild and secretary of state albert füracker .
the original name &quot; schützengesellschaft tannenwald berngau &quot; dates from 1907 , when the society for social entertainment was founded on 21 march in the room and small cabin shooting &quot; .
the nazi regime had announced the dissolution of the association in 1937 .
only in 1964 did 19 young men find themselves again , who were born on april 30 at the inn lukas the &quot; new &quot; schützenverein &quot; tannenwald &quot; berngau from baptism .
karl march and adolf ried lead the association as a shootmaster through a difficult initial period in which it mainly focused on the creation of a club .
in the autumn of 1965 the schützenverein started its activities in the inn &quot; leininger &quot; with two teams .
in the years that followed , the sportsmen who have now been organized into seven teams established themselves in all classes up to the 1st gauliga .
the association records are the first to be published every year and the magic limit of 380 rings was first established in 1980 by rudi meier .
just as the efficiency of active shooters has increased , members have also improved .
after the &quot; leininger &quot; club no longer meets the demands of a modern shooter club , the team has changed its name to the &quot; leininger &quot; .
after a working performance of 2700 hours , on 8 may 1988 , parish strasser awarded the prize for the new protective rooms .
one of the great highlights of the club ’ s history was certainly the 44th edition of the art of gathering , coupled with the festive conflagration of the new sagittarius flag in july 1991 .
on 23 and 24 april 1994 , the schützenverein celebrated its 30th anniversary .
1995 a böllergroup was founded .
josef schmalzl was böllerreferenced .
a big challenge for the &quot; böller &quot; and for the association as a whole was the orientation of the bavarian böllertreffen 2005 .
in many hours of volunteer work , the club members last year opened the rooms and the shooting facility in the berngau hof , thus updating to the latest technology .
eleven teams in round matches
the sporty performance of the shooter club can also be seen .
altogether , 11 teams are currently participating in the round matches : six air rifle teams , an air gun team , a sports pilot and a team kk1 , a youth and two ah-teams .
the first team with lars ellrich , katharina ellrich , steffi grad and kerstin kelermann is in round 2013 / 14 of the gauoberliga ( highest league in the schützengu district ) .
the second team with verena moosburger alexandra meier , eva schuhmann and tobias graml is nominated by the gauliga nord to the gauoberliga .
besides shooting , events such as bockstechen , carnival and königsball , club excursion and christmas party have tradition .
the shooters are also present at the festivals in parish and municipality .
tony stewart is suffering an accident on return to the track .
tony stewart &apos;s return to the race track ended about half way through his race on the atlanta motor speedway .
stewart drove against the wall for the second time , after his right front tyre burst in round 172 and finished his evening .
stewart drove his damaged car into the garage and left without going to the press .
his team leader chad johnston said that his 14 head was a good one .
&quot; i wish we had a better commitment and a better result for him , &quot; said johnston , &quot; he said .
we drive to richmond and hope that we can do better there .
stewart already used to drive to the race on sunday evening after a collision with kyle busch and had to repair the right side of his car .
&quot; i am quite hopeful today for a good result , &quot; johnston said and put it to me : &quot; it was simply not a success . &quot;
not long after the second accident , steward &apos;s car was loaded into the trailer and the team had packed and was ready to leave .
stewart left three nascar sprint cup races after his car had taken another driver at an ash-train race in the north of new york state and killed .
he decided to return this week and either to go to atlanta or to the next race in richmond to win a place in persecution .
he returned to his job , while studying the tragic incident that occurred at the death of the 20-year-old kevin ward jr. , who was at the time of a race on the track to stewart .
the authorities announced on friday that the investigation into the cause of the accident would be ongoing for at least two weeks .
no decision has yet been taken on whether stewart should be charged with an accusation .
the three champion was received with great applause when he was presented before the race .
after a start at 12th position , stewart was already on the stage for the first 10 and was temporarily in fourth position .
after a restart in round 122 , bush ’ s opponent came to power .
car no . 18 out of control after exit from curve 2 and collided with stewart , with both cars walking against the wall .
stewart continued , but fell back to position 21 .

ukrainian president petro poroshenko has already had personal consequences from the severe defeat of his army in the fight against separatists and has already led changes in the supreme army leadership without giving details .
prorussian separatists shot off from the airport .
in the fight against ukrainian government troops , prorussian separatists , according to their own account , have once again launched a combat aircraft and two military helicopters .

nato does not want to break agreements with russia
nato will be strengthened by the planned stationing in eastern europe as a result of the ukrainian crisis .
nato secretary-general anders fogh rasmussen said in brussels on monday that nato is following the founding agreement of the nato russia council of 1997 .
nato ’ s chief , however , accused russia of &quot; a crackdown &quot; on the agreement .
&quot; today we must face up to reality that russia does not regard nato as a partner , &quot; rasmussen said .
documents and statements from the russian side indicate that &apos; you will not consider us to be opponents &apos; .
stronger nato presence
rasmussen has also announced that nato will strengthen its presence in eastern europe .
a report on the issue of the &apos; reach agreement &apos; to be adopted at the nato summit in wales will ensure that &apos; we have more visible nato presence in the east as long as this is necessary &apos; , said rasmussen on monday .

the negotiations were scheduled for next saturday , the russian energy minister , alexander nowak , said on monday .

merkel speaks of power : toll is &quot; quite clear &quot; coming , toll will come &quot; quite clearly &quot; .
now the chancellor is once again clearly committed to this .
a license for all the complicated details , however , it is not .
persistent concerns from the cdu against the passenger car toll have made the csu increasingly aware that the european union is not doing anything to help them .
chancellor angela merkel has , after sustained resistance , left her cdu a power word for the introduction of a passenger toll .
&quot; to be perfectly clear , it is in the coalition treaty , and it will come , &quot; said the party leader on monday after meetings of the cdu leaders .
the project was based on a detailed model but not on it .
in the black-red governance programme , &apos; certain parameters &apos; are mentioned .
federal minister of transport alexander dobrindt ( csu ) has made a proposal , and that is what is now being further worked on .
the nrw-cdu , however , insists on its ‘ no ’ to tolls on all roads .
merkel stressed that finance minister wolfgang schäuble ( cdu ) also makes a constructive contribution to the deliberations on a draft law .
beyond the subject , he also talked about other possibilities with dobrindt to invest more private capital in infrastructure , including in broadband .
&quot; there is nothing special about it &quot; , schäuble had a &quot; mirror &quot; report on sunday , which he did not comment on , his house examined a separate concept to provide car investors with toll revenues .
csu chef horst seehofer warned that the world would be in a position to impose toll concepts on the lead minister in the cabinet .
cdu bundesvize armin laschet reaffirmed his objections .
&quot; the coalition treaty never assumed that all kreis- and bundesstraße streets would be tolled , &quot; said the north rhine-westphalian cdu head of state .
in this respect , it is an important signal that seehofer has now announced that he will be talking about this issue again .
resistance to the plans also comes from the cdu national associations of baden-württemberg and rhineland-palatinate .
the background is that there is a fear that a toll would affect small border traffic with neighbouring countries .
the seafaring shock was due to the toll criticism from the cdu coalition .
the left sees the plans as being very difficult in the face of the dispute in the union .
&quot; the murk toll is dead , &quot; said party leader bernd riexinger of the &quot; new osnabrücker zeitung &quot; ( monday ) .
&quot; with the toll the minister fails &quot; . dobrindt wants to impose a vignette duty on all german roads that are to start in 2016 .
domestic car owners are allowed to use the coalition agreement but not to be additional burdens .
therefore , they should have a full compensation for the tolls through the motor vehicle tax .
the model must not , however , be used to discriminate against foreign drivers because of their nationality under eu law .
genetic disorder often misdiagnoses it .
a british woman says that she thought she was going to die in the united states as a result of a misdiagnosis for many years .
karin rodgers lived almost all of her youth in the belief that she was only a few years away after she had been diagnosed with another disease .
she was indeed suffering from the charcot-marie-tooth disease ( cmt ) - a group of inherited disorders that spread nerves outside the brain and spinal cord .
charity cmt uk announced that missing diagnoses are a frequent problem with people with cancer cmt , because this is not the case .
about 23,000 people in britain are likely to suffer from cmt , which may cause engine disorders such as muscle weakness , an uncertain gear and curved toes .
sufferers also suffer from deafness or pain , and the disease is incurable and progressively , which means that the symptoms are linked with time .
when rodger was 13 , she believed that she was interested in friedreich-ataxie ( fa ) - a disease with very poor chances of survival .
rodger thought she would be in a wheelchair before she was 18 , and before her 30th birthday .
the mother of two children , who is 51 years old today , said : &apos; as a child , i knew that i could not do the same as the others .
i was constantly falling and everything lasted longer with me .
i never could play rollers or skateboards with the other children and was often criticised in school for my way of going and running .
rodgers said that she was born at the age of 13 after several operations to relieve her achilles and stretching her feet .
&quot; i felt guilty because i was curious .
when i was told i was shocked and horrified .
i thought that i was in wheelchair with 18 and died with 25 , and in between , slowly lose all my skills .
i did all this with me alone and planned my own funeral .
she said when she was 17 she became aware that her skills were not so much reduced as she had hoped .
he was standing up , and hugged me and said , &quot; my love , i do not think you have that , otherwise you are already in the wheelchair . &quot;
i think you have a far less life-threatening thing .
after some genetic tests , her cmt was detected .
&quot; when he told me what cmt was , i felt as if i were a winner , &quot; said she .
charity cmt uk has a cmt-awareness month , which is to be followed by a cmt awareness month .
stable field webel a. d. berni diether has been working since the closure of the former training place as a firefighter pilot .
for almost ten years , the former training camp in münsingen has been closed .
nevertheless , every month , fatal ammunition appears at the heart of the biosphere region of swabian alb .
the grenades are sometimes so dangerous that they are blown up on the ground .
a stuffed toe hits the eyes of the explosions over the heart of the biosphere reserve .
in december 2004 , the last sharp shot was on the exercise of the troops in munich , which was taken to the end of 2005 after 110 years of military operation .
since that time , the 6500 hectares of the area have been the core of the biosphere area swabian alb , which is situated on 13 designated paths for hikers and cyclists .
tax burden on businessmen in the washington area increases with economic recovery
economic recovery means more customers , more sales and new jobs .
it also means higher taxes .
government and local tax decisions for domestic companies increased by a slight increase last year , while economic recovery accelerated , such as a newly published study in the past week , and firms in the washington area formed no exception .
companies in the district , maryland and virginia area jointly paid $ 27.6 billion to state and local authorities in the 2013 financial year , an increase of 3.8 % over 2012 ’ s 2012 revenues of $ 26.6 billion .
the state and local tax burden on companies increased by 4.3 % last year to eur 671 billion , compared to 3.9 % in 2006 .
government taxes increased more than local taxes to $ 4.3 % , so the study suggests , from the service industry to the private sector .
more than half of district tax revenue , 56 percent , comes from corporate taxes , while 36 percent of revenues are maryland ’ s .
virginia achieves the lowest tax revenue from companies , at 28 % .
much of the rise in tax revenues is due to a recovery in corporate property values , say the foresters , which leads to an increase in real estate taxes by 3.7 % this year after the three successive years with a rise in the number .
while much of these profits are from large states such as california , new york , and texas , the process also seems to be moving in the washington area .
companies in the district , maryland and virginia have jointly paid over $ 10 billion in government and local real estate taxes last year , compared to $ 9.6 billion in 2012 - an increase over the course of a year by 4.2 % .
but the apparent recovery in real estate values is not as effective in maryland in increasing government and local tax revenues , as this is where real estate taxes are amounting to just over a fifth of the corporate tax burden .
companies in virginia and d.c. pay almost half of their government and local taxes in the form of property taxes .
&quot; in maryland , the following is happening : a large proportion of real estate , especially in the tax area around d.c. , is owned either by the government or by non-profit organizations that do not pay real estate taxes , &quot; said douglas lindholm center .
maryland is therefore forced to focus much more on income taxes , for example , to provide the same services that other countries offer .
the recent fiscal recovery by businesses cannot be attributed solely to the recovery of the housing market .
corporate revenues also seem to recover , so the data .
companies in the region reported income taxes on state organizations , from 2.3 billion dollars in comparison with 2.1 billion in 2006 .
maryland took $ 1 billion in corporate income taxes that were the highest in the region .
while the trend is in the same direction , local tax burden on companies is not increasing in all three places equally .
the district governor ’ s rate of increase was 4.3 % of the national average , while the maryland rise was significantly higher , 4.9 % .
only virginia reported a lower average tax of 4.1 % .
virginia has a record record of a very low turnover of 6 % in all three areas of office ( in all three , there are firm corporate tax rates ) .
the maryland corporate tax rate is 8.25 % and the district is relatively low .
a similar study by the us chamber of commerce earlier this year showed that in virginia , lower government and local corporate taxes are required , and overall , there is a better fiscal climate than in maryland .
the study did not investigate the district .
in spite of the advantages virginia is under pressure from its southern neighbour .
north carolina has laws to reduce its corporate tax rates this year from 6.9 % to 6 % , which is the same as virginia , and the rate will be increased to 5 % next year .
if the state continues to raise its income targets in the coming year , this law could reduce the state ’ s corporate income tax rate to 3 % by 2017 .
meanwhile , it seems that small businesses in the washington area are doing better , and they are paying more government and local taxes , according to the latest study .
corporate taxes , which are paid as personal income taxes by small businessmen - a transitional structure whereby most small businesses are organized - are paid in the district , maryland , and virginia by 20 % last year , to $ 2.7 billion .
researchers say that the trend and increase in the number of corporate taxes across the country is likely to continue this year , with an increase in the general vat revenue for the state and the local authorities .
yet washington may be lagging behind if the spending cuts are not implemented by the federal government .
partner city : german beer for guangzhou
hops and malt - a popular combination in china as well .
german beer enjoys a very good reputation in china .
frankfurt ’ s partner city in china now wants a brewery and also hopes for a direct flight connection between the two cities .
german beer , used in frankfurt &apos;s partner city guangzhou - that is the urgent wish of the officials in china .
&quot; we would be very pleased if a german brewery could establish itself in our city , &quot; said the vice party secretary of the south china metropolis , li yiwei , in the german brewery visiting a delegation this week .
time and again , the functionalist of the ruling chinese communist party came to this issue during the conversation of the twelve-million metropolis .
guangzhou , which is also called canton in germany , is one of the richest cities in china , warned li .
so people also possess the purchasing power to buy german beer .
the chairman of the german social democratic party ( spd ) , thorsten schäfer-gümbel , who led the german political delegation , said to the host that he would look for a possible partner for the project in germany .
&quot; for beer it does not take much : good water , grain and joie de vivre &quot; , he added at lunch with the party leader in guangzhou .
this joie de vivre is already beaming up with mr. li , he flattered the host .
the functional committee then came up with a proposal from guangzhou to replace schäfer gümbel with red wine , which was served for the meal .
the chinese brand tsingtao is based on german brewing art .
tsingtao beer is produced according to the german purity order .
more business
a second wish of chinese hosts would be to have a direct flight connection between frankfurt and guangzhou , said vice party leader li .
lufthansa had offered the flight earlier , but in 2012 , it was cancelled for economic reasons .
&quot; it would be worth it again , &quot; the local politician expressed his conviction .
&quot; the business between our two cities is growing all the time &quot; .
currently , travellers would have to travel by detour via changsha in hunan province , li complained .
the administration of guangdong province , the capital of guangzhou , also hopes for the flight connection .
the vice governor of the province , chen yunxian , expressed this wish during his conversation with the social democrats .
&quot; this is a very good idea , &quot; schäfer-gümbel replied - the chinese vice minister li jinjun , an intimate german connoisseur , said nokked .
well-kept partnership
the lifeless vice leader of guangzhou hou hopes that he will be able to persuade frankfurt to join a partnership meeting next year .
li yiwei was already on the main but not yet in this function .
he only came into office this year after his predecessor had been arrested for corruption charges .
the local party leader , wan qinglian , also had to go .
the action taken against guangzhou officials is part of a nationwide campaign against corruption in the party and administration , led by head of state xi jinping .
the new leader , li yiwei , had been campaigning for an american company before his party career , which was most unusual in the chinese communist party .
before he took office in guangzhou , he was a senior official in fujian , where the car manufacturer vw was a great plant .
frankfurt is officially more than a dozen twinning partnerships between cities .
the connection to the guangler lake , which is 9,000 kilometres away , is one of those that are maintained by both sides , for example with an exchange of pupils .
last year , the 25-year anniversary of the german-chinese association was celebrated .
the southern chinese metropolis on the pearl river is almost as strong as the whole of hessen with its economic power .
next year , it intends to increase gross domestic product of eur 250 billion , according to li .
family of joan rivers &quot; expresses the thumbs &quot; .
joan rivers has been a medical hospital since she was born in new york city three days ago ; her daughter was not aware of any hope today that she would not have been able to find her way from sickness .
&quot; thank you for your continued love and support , &quot; said melissa rivers today in a communication .
we are all raising our fingers .
according to her mother , on thursday after an emergency , she was found in a clinic at upper east side , yorkville endosscopy , in london .
the doctors deliberately keep them seded and under close observation , until they are satisfied with their condition , which continues to be described as &quot; serious &quot; .
the reactions have come from many quarters , including the overwhelming online support of donald reagan .
environmentally friendly vacuum cleaners and rising wages
for cars and vacuum cleaners that are now coming into the market , stricter environmental standards will apply in future .
similar to refrigerators and washing machines , new vacuum cleaners are being delivered to a label from 1 september , where the buyer can at a glance identify central data such as the energy efficiency of the device .
new cars are subject to a &quot; euro 6 &quot; level of emissions of nitrogen oxide .
there is also more money for scaffolding builders : they receive a nationwide uniform minimum wage of 10.25 euros .
amazon buys twitch for $ 1.04 billion in $ 1.04 billion in twitch , $ 1.04 billion in $ 1.04 billion in $ 1.4 billion in $ 1.4 billion .
amazon has just confirmed what information was reported on monday morning : the online retailer - and video producer , and a host of other things - buys the video streaming service twitch for 1.04 billion $ ( $ 1.04 billion ) .
the announcement comes surprising , not because no one wants to take on twitch , but because it was widely suspected that youtube was the company that would buy .
three months ago , it seemed that the sale of twitch to the video service of google for a cool billion was decided on .
twitch , which was only founded three years ago as justin.tv , was a general streaming service - a live version of yostout-tv .
instead , it quickly became a platform for players who wanted to play their bravura games , a &quot; youtube for live games &quot; that was a great insider .
the twitch interface .
and &quot; let &apos;s play &quot; , a video genre in which better guys can see the ( mostly older ) playing a painting of secret science theaters , are on youtube .
it is just that youtube is often called when you use twitch to describe what you are doing , so the message that youtube twitch was trying to buy was somewhat bored .
it is a mystery why the deal with youtube is not made , as the company reports that it was willing to pay as much as amazon did .
all we know at the moment is that emmet smith said that he was president of twitch : &apos; we have chosen amazon to be because they are bound by our community , they share our values and long-term values .
another secret , frankly , is the incredible success of twitch .
for snobs like me , who explain that they prefer to do sport rather than watch it , it is difficult to understand the attraction that is supposed to help others play than to take control consoles into the hands of themselves .
it is one thing to tell a friend about the shoulder at 3 o &apos;clock in the morning , while resident evil sneaks , and something quite different , a spinner watching as he gets 20 times in succession .
all these games you could watch right now .
another problem is that many of the most popular games today are ego games , so the watching can be done without own control over the perspective a really good recipe for headache .
i admit that the rapid procedures in which the roger bannisters of our electronic age are based are not very easy to use .
but until a game or humorvirtuosity is present , its twitch channel is probably not so interesting .
but what do skeptics know about this , like me ?
twitch is used by 55 million different visitors per month and is the fourth largest source of internet traffic peaks .
and how exactly does amazon want to make money from it ?
it is difficult to imagine that twitch is so elegant in amazon instant video that it is like youtube .
but twitch has something that every company would like : thousands of young men who are turned into advertisers .
as the chairman of twitch , shear , said , amazon and twitch &quot; both believe in the future of gaming , &quot; and the medium shows no signs of a shrinking , nor yet .
on the hüpfburg near the burggarten festival , a lot of things were going on on on saturday .
the concept of the organizers agreed .
despite the strong rain-casting on saturday evening , an estimated 1200 music fans came to the open-air festival in burgundy garden .
at times the entry had to be stopped .
&quot; that was annoying , &quot; said ron sem , one of the organizers .
salzwedel l licht und freuen .
we have heard from two spanish words maxim sachraj and ron sem the name amula .
the open air in the salzwedeler burggarten is supposed to show brightness during the day and in the evening through various shows .
well , and the fun comes from alone anyway .
this was already evident early on saturday when the first visitors to the open air .
a feast for all generations had promised the organizers .
and they have succeeded .
around the supply stands on the burggartenwiese were salt water producers , but also guests from the nearer and wider surroundings .
they followed the first live performances , wiped with the foot in the beat , enjoyed the kisses - short : relaxation pure and enjoyment were desired .
and the way through generations .
while some people are focusing on blankets on the extra carry-on white sand on the beach bar , others are bustling with a quarter of wine in the vinothek , the young on the hipfburg raged .
but also when it comes to children &apos;s minks , the volunteers had literally all their hands full to help the android .
the larger ones used the kickertables or took part in a skateboard workshop that the goodfoot crews from salzwedel had built .
until the great rain came .
just before 5.30 p.m. he was prone to the visitors , especially families who were looking for the wide and dry .
but the attractiveness of the festival did not detract from this .
&quot; more people came than expected , &quot; said ron sem , who spoke of a &quot; success all over the line &quot; .
i am therefore very critical of the great party being repeated next year .
although the content and size of the event still need to be worked on , sem made a first assessment of the popular vote on sunday .
the first time he was a member of the group , he was a member of the group , and he was a member of the group .
obviously , the security company was booked with too little force .
the result is that some who had already paid out no longer came to the area .
the response was very good .
in a first cautious estimate , the salzwedeler co-organizer spoke of about 1200 visitors who were in the garden of the castle .
there were problems with sound technology .
the hip-hop salzwedeler band blocks`n`rox broke their performance out of nervousness .
the technicians were unable to find a reasonably reasonable sound .
the planned shisha lounges could not be built because the tents were closed due to a tyre breakdown .
&quot; next year , you will be there , &quot; says the organizer .
the premiere of the amula-open air was marked by the number of visitors more than ever .
and that in bad weather .
however , the organizers have made some mistakes which were delayed the first time , but at the second edition they must be removed .
facebook also needs to be critical in the social network .
&quot; sorry , but for 12 euros you just expected more , &quot; says melanie meier at the event page .
&quot; you &apos;ve taken a bit of it on , &quot; says ele zimmermann at the same place .
others do not see the initial problems as close as they are .
i think it is very good that some people are not only stupid , but are actually trying to put something on their feet .
hut off ! &quot; writes stephanie jensß to amula .
now the organizers have a year to answer these criticisms .
new radom in berkum : wachtberg ’ s landmark shrines
this is not as expected .
instead , the ready component is waiting to be integrated into the distinctive building .
the action is in the context of a larger measure : almost 50 years after the space observation radar tira was established , the shell , the so-called radom , is being completely renewed .
the new radom is equipped with a diameter of 47.5 meters slightly smaller than the old one .
however , the size remains world record .
the last step towards completing the new cover is the change of the cap .
the upper part of the old shell is separated and covered with a crane .
after that , the last quarter of the new shell is set up .
if the weather is present , the action will be taken at the beginning of this week .
participants at the ice bucket challenge are invited to participate in the ice buckets challenge .
isabelle roberts from the uk cried so much as her icy water was thrown over her head that she had cut the bone structure of her face .
this ice bucket challenge went down painfully dangling .
a woman was brought to the hospital after she had been taken to the ice buckets challenge so much that she could not afford to go to the jaw .
isabelle roberts from the uk wrote so much as her ice-cold water was over her head .
&quot; the water was so cold that i shouted , and while i did , my kiefer remained simple , &quot; she said to the mirror .
ice water is protected over the 20-year-old .
isabelle roberts a few seconds before the accident
i wanted to close my mouth , but that did not go , the jaw was chopped , and then i understood that something was not true .
my mother and sister saw this and made a laugh almost to the pants , but i had to go into the emergency .
the 20-year-old from the uk was sent to the hospital to get rid of the jaw after taking part in the viral trend on tuesday .
the clip has been turned into a website and a thousand times on facebook and twitter .
do the burgvereins soon pull back together ?
finally , there was a constant conflict between the two wolfratshausers burgundy clubs .
now , the boards of directors are considering possible cooperation .
as a model for the reconstruction of the wolfratshauser castle , the late richard dimbath , former chairman of the wolfratshauser burgfreunde , carried out the project in french guédelon .
just a year ago , there was no good climate between the burgverein and the friends of the burgundy wolfratshausen .
the positions of the commission and the council on the history of wolfratshauser burg have seemed to be very different .
now the two camps are moving together : there are to be talks soon about a common approach .
this is confirmed by the board of directors of torsten sjöberg ( burgverein ) and herbert piffl ( burgfreunde ) at the request of our newspaper .
&quot; i listened to mr piffl and suggested that we should sit down together , &quot; says sjöberg .
he believes that all members of both clubs could in future pull together again .
this is how visible successes can be achieved more quickly .
while the burgundy friends are still trying to get rid of richard dimbath until the last time , the castle on the bergwald was rebuilt , the burgverein around sjöberg stands for &quot; exploration and adventure &quot; .
herbert piffl , second chairman of the burgfreunde , has made a great pleasure by his own information about the call .
since dimbat ’ s death , he has been standing before the burgundy ’ s friends .
a new chairman is due to be found in a member &apos;s meeting in mid-september .
currently , the association counts about 40 members according to the 74-year-old .
&quot; after the death of my friend richard dimbath , we have the club activities from respect first ruined . &quot;
according to piffl , the new chairman will then be in contact with the burgverein .
until then , burgundy ’ s friends could also get a current picture of their grouping .
there is currently no candidate for the presidency , says piffl .
&quot; but i am confident that someone will find himself &quot; he himself does not want to stand because he is resident in bad tölz .
the new chairman should be a wolfratshauser .
the tölzer wants to participate in the project &quot; but very much like to continue working &quot; .
the different points of view on reconstruction are not likely to be discussed in piffl ’ s eyes in the near future .
he appreciates dimbath as a &quot; missionary &quot; , who always believed in the reconstruction of the castle .
two similar , already well advanced projects in austria and france would show that this idea is not a dead letter .
the high level of participation of the population and the volunteers from around the world make them a tourist magnet .
piffl : &quot; i too was sceptical at the beginning .
but over time i am more and more convinced that the european union is making sense in moving the project forward , &quot; it could be a &apos; one-stop-shop &apos; for the flute city .
there is nothing else here .
moreover , the project would be financed by eu grants , visitor tickets and potential sponsors .
&quot; the idea of reconstruction is not something i personally want to throw out , &quot; he hopes that the burgverein will perhaps take a step forward on this point .
its goal of first documenting history is &quot; important and good &quot; .
then we could look further .
clever ways to save money on university textbooks
since the cost of university textbooks is more than $ 1,000 per year for many students , the fast-second half of the student has considered matt schroeder a clever spary-idea .
he invented a loan system for books of students of higher semester and offered a nominal remuneration to facilitate resale .
&quot; my mathematics book costs $ 180 normally , but i got it for $ 10 for a semester and a chick-fil-a-keks , &quot; said schroeder , 19 who had the covenant .
the financial resources required for the last semester would have cost $ 430 , he said .
he gave out $ 120 .
the college administration announced that the student would be on average over 1,200 $ a year for textbooks and study material , and that it would be more than $ 200 for students to use various cost cushions .
online shops and creative approaches such as the schroeder are increasingly the solution of choice for students .
renting textbooks is becoming more popular , and so students can book a semester long , often at a much cheaper price than when buying .
neebo inc , which has more than 250 university bookstores , announced with the release of the new version of textbooks .
surveys in the industry show that about a quarter of books in the college bookshops were published last spring .
less than half of all textbooks are published according to the national association of college stores in campus-bookstores .
here is the one-off for the best deals .
online buying
some new books cost only one third of the price for which they are sold in the campus bookshop online .
the ninth edition of &quot; calculus &quot; vno ron larwon , bruce edwards and robert horetler costs almost $ 290 , but can be ordered at the specialized bookseller chegg.com for 23rd books .
buy used
if you like to receive the notes of other or normal usage tracks , you need to buy a good option .
&quot; calculus &quot; is used on chegg.com for $ 93.49 .
matt casday , 25 , graduate student at brigham young university , says that he is on amazon.com 42 cents .
the book was sold for $ 48 .
academics such as ingrid bracey , head of the university of massachusetts at the amherst college without walls empathic students to make their professors ask whether they had read earlier issues .
sometimes the updates for the seminar work are not relevant .
in such cases , older editions can often be used for a fraction of the cost of the latest edition .
besides chegg and amazon , half.com is also a popular online store for second-hand books .
rents
renting textbooks is worth considering when you want to use them reasonably well , remember that they are returned and they are going to leave the books after the course has been completed .
you can pay more than 80 % of the cost of a newly purchased book .
a student could , for example , use &quot; calculus &quot; for a semester for about $ 20 .
find out about the terms of the business you rent with , including the penalty fees , which may apply to writing a note or a letter of notice .
tenants pay attention : if you do not return the book , the penalty fees may exceed the price of a new book .
e-books
e-books , rather than conventional textbooks , are also an option .
sometimes these books are rented de facto by using an electronic license for a certain period of time by wholesalers such as amazon.com , chegg and barnes &amp; noble inc .
at chegg you can find &quot; calculus &quot; for 6 months for about 61 $ .
bracey says that students in literature courses often receive the best offers , since many classics are downloaded free nowadays , while scientific and engineering students often find the best offers .
look around at each other .
joe gault , 29 , who will soon be the pepperdine law school , recommends the isbn number for the price determination for bücher , because you can be so sure that you have the right teaching .
and before ordering online you should check , so gault says , whether the book is in fact in stock .
he learned this lesson from the hard tour .
he bought a book that had four weeks delivery time and finally paid the full price in the college bookshop .
why &quot; guardians of the galaxy &quot; no cash battle has been won ?
&quot; the expandables 3 &quot; by sylvester stallone played less than 30 million dollars of his 90 million dollars budget in the us , while &quot; sin city : a lady to kill for &quot; only 12 million dollars .
the new camera control system , designed to meet the needs of the camera diaz , played only 14.6 million dollars at the opening weekend , while children &apos;s films such as &quot; dragon trees made easily 2 &quot; also disappoint revenue .
an article of the telegraph movie critic robbie collin suggests that the first children ’ s films were the lack of quality in the films themselves .
collin called 2014 &quot; the worst year &quot; so far for children &apos;s films and described &quot; dragon &apos;s counting made easy 2 &quot; as purely &quot; functional &quot; fantasy continuation .
for films for a slightly older target group , however , it seems that the quality of the films does not necessarily pose a problem .
in july , entertainment weekly recompared the average cinemascores and meta-critic rating for each summer movie start , which is between the american memorial and the american film day on july 20 , 2013 and the current year .
the results are based on the opinion of the cinema visitors and film critics , and suggest that this year &apos;s film hits are similar to those of the past year .
some commentators believe that the trend is due to changing visual habits and growing popularity of web streaming services such as netflix .
director jon favreau , who is currently working on disney &apos;s upcoming jungle book movie , said to the website hollywood .
we must accept this and not try to follow the past .
unlike the currently weak cash outcomes of the hollywood productions , netflix has recently achieved sales of € 39.2 billion ( $ 1.2 billion ) .
last summer , the director steven spielberg criticised film studios for not being too bold in their focus on film films by comics and prophesied a &quot; core meltdown &quot; of hollywood .
in the light of the current downturn , some commentators argue that his grim prophecy may well be a true core .
the new economy will be in a much worse state because of the potential cash spillers that await in the summer of 2015 , including avengers : age of ultron , minions , and jurassic world .
the producer of x-men , simon kinberg , described the decline in cash outcomes recently as simply &quot; cyclical &quot; and said to hollywood reporter : &quot; the next summer will be the largest summer on the internet .
when the second table tennis district was opened a few years ago in order to streamline the league division , the second table tennis district was taken a step in the right direction .
now the german table tennis league has an additional 3rd bundesliga .
the result : those who have not climbed have gone down .
for example , göttingen ’ s highest class team torpedo has won the prestigious “ best of the year ” in the upper league release but will play only fifth ranking in the coming season .
fourth class of the series , torpedo ’ s ladies , despite their grandiose passage into the regional league .
the boys and girls of torpedo start in the lower saxony league , as well as the boys of the sc weende .
the sg handlers and the torpedo reserve are entering the new association list .
the ttv geismar plays in the association liga , which is the torpedo second in the national league .
what the composition looks like a better district class is now the new district class .
tsv sillingen , vfb lödingsen , torpedo iii , geismar , einbeck , hammenstedt , bovender sv , langenholtensen , the fc .
in the district sliga play as regional representative dransfeld and the sc weende , in the district class of ttc ii , rot-weiß , the bovender sv ii and the teams of the team of the ttv .
güntersen , the ttc and the ttv geismar ii are here with from the game .
in the district sliga run torpedo iii and sattenhausen / wöllmarshausen .
with nine teams each , each with nine teams ,
the sc weende sends his girls to the small district sliga .
the district sliga season of the scw boys - there is still torpedo ii starting - is not complete .
in a district class geismar , tuspo weende and the bovender sv go into the season .
in the first season of the newly established regional association , the two göttinger circular leagues start with nine teams each .
in the west season , the red and white ii , bovender sv iii , laubach ii , torpedo iv and v , mtv grone , dransfeld sc ii , mielhausen and mielen.
in the east season , satie &apos;s / wöllmarshausen , nikolausberg and landolfshausen , among others , play .
the women &apos;s kreissliga consists of sattenhausen / wöllmarshausen ii , bilshausen , hemeln , sillingen ii , tuspo weende and the sg rhume .
that is still better than in osterode county , where there is no female breeding team at all .
it is striking that none of the six 2.circle classes should be harder to achieve , and this is where the innovative and excited circle board of directors will have to worry .
nato summit : first protests in newport and cardiff
at the weekend there were protests from opponents of the nato summit in newport .

anti-government protests in pakistan escalate
the approximately 1000 demonstrators were killed by soldiers from the ptv building , said information minister pervaiz rashid .
the station has a good half hour to resume the broadcast .
ptv director athar faroq said that the equipped with sticks demonstrators could have used equipment in the editorial department .
dead or injured have not been reported .
the demonstrators are calling for the resignation of the heads of government , to whom they accuse electoral fraud .
the police told us that about a kilometre from the residence of prime minister nawaz sharif , it would be possible to clash again on monday with around 3000 demonstrators with security forces .
according to hospital data , a policeman was injured .
at the weekend , at least three people were killed and more than 500 injured when demonstrators tried to return to sharif ’ s residence .
they are calling for the resignation of the prime minister .
the powerful military had a very strong military presence on sunday evening after a meeting in the headquarters of the army .
it was also stated in the communication : &apos; the army remains committed to its role of guaranteeing the security of the state &apos; .
the escalating violence has caused concern about military intervention .
the opposition politician imran khan and the preacher tahirul qadri ’ s protests have lasted since independence day on 14 august .
sharif rejects resignation .
khan and qadri had their supporters called on sunday to stay .
&quot; we will not go back without sharif forced to resign , &quot; said khan .
qadri was similarly sentient .
khan accuses sharif of holding the parliamentary election last may by cheating .
qadri calls for the resignation of central and provincial governments .
then a transitional government should reform the electoral system and call new elections .
more than 40 000 security forces are in operation to attack the government quarter .
the demonstrators had initially peacefully demonstrated before parliament that they had been arrested until khan and qadri invited them to do so at the weekend .

&quot; i thought i had to say all the fruits of thursday and i was snoring him .
when the smile was on 13 novmember 2010 for the last time in a bundesliga match , the game was still very popular .
the first rapid-dredge championship will therefore be held in special memories .
&quot; for me this is something very special , i am from the rapid youth &quot; , said schrapmann , a member of the german society for the protection of human rights .
due to the short-term basket blissage of mario pavelic , schrammel moved from the left to the right defensive side and made his cause very good there too .
he has enough experience that he has also misled this position .
he deserves the goal , he has already won some assists this year , &quot; praised barisic .
team shows character schrammel also delivered the flank to the 2 : 0 through hofmann after well an hour , which finally brought the decision .
because before that , guests could have written .
&quot; thank god we have had some luck today , &quot; schrammel also noted , who was thus waiting for the gap between performance and results in the past few weeks : &quot; the results have not been correct , but that is the game .
barisic even found that &quot; in many games you were better than today &quot; - against &quot; the strongest manpower , the most powerful in this season at this stadium &quot; .
the first three-point since 26 july has therefore proved that the team structure is the backlash despite the setbacks .
for him , it is no less gratifying : &apos; we have finally played back to zero &apos; .
a lot of work during the country break is also done by the fact that brian behrendt , mario pavelic , christopher dibon , deni alar and michael schimmelsberger have recorded several cases .
&quot; we must not forget this , &quot; he warned , &quot; he said , that he had been working with behrendt and pavelic players in the last three days , &quot; he has recently been very stable .
the national pause must therefore be used to &apos; wound wounds and to &apos; break &apos; a little more in the physical sphere &apos; , barisic said , who had five u21 auswahlateurs in his home country .
one who probably feels particularly comfortable with the break is captain hofmann .
he is tearing himself up for the team , going over pain .
it is precisely at this difficult stage that he has shown that he is a very important player for us , &quot; said barisic .
hofmann gave the game rapids before his replacement in the 68th minute not only the structure but also achieved the second goal .
for the 33-year-old who has won his 350th bundesliga game , it was the first match hit since 2 november 2013 ( 4 : 2 on the admira ) .
hofmann : &quot; must not believe that now everything is good &quot; , &quot; we certainly have also had a bit of luck , but luck must come back to us at some point .
now it was high time , &quot; said hofmann .
but he was too focused to continue working : &quot; you cannot let this always be black and white .
in recent weeks , we have not played as badly as has been suggested .
nor must we believe that everything is good now .
the importance of his role for the team he could not deny .
it is a very young team , which i am currently very able to help .
they are still in my hands in certain phases , &quot; said hofmann .
val gardena michael baur and his team had little to reproach themselves .
he regretted the quick &apos; magic gate &apos; hit , as well as the regular gateway to nutz in the 40th minute , which was collected by referee collegger unjustly .
the only criticism i have made of the team is that we are heading towards tor in some phases not enough .
we have too little qualifications in this area .
maximilian karner , the internal defender , saw it similar : &quot; it started badly , but then we found a door and we did it .
by and large , it would have been more in .
there is a fuss under this mess , a fuss of ruh .
a powerful tribe was shown in our enigmatic task of the summer series &quot; my piece of the rheiner luck &quot; last friday .
several of these trees are still in the county , the illustrated copy is the &quot; geißruheiche &quot; above below the lower welshenbrunn .
a bumpy footpath leads up to the approximately 600 year old oak .
it passes by couples , basalt pits and basalt stone meadows .
a little bit below the quarry of the bauersberg , one kilometre north of the road to weisbach , it stands .
vital sees the natural monument , it rises above the other trees in the area and reminds with a range of over eight meters of an american mammoth tree .
a small buddha on a tree plumb indicates that it is a spiritual hero or mystical place .
but , despite intensive research , there was only evidence of the origin of the name .
dr. wolfgang schneider has created a special consultation with the bischofsheimer archiv and consulted older people from underwelshellbrunn to find out what the relationship is with scourge .
the result of his research remained the rather sober explanation for the name .
so , until about 80 years ago , the shepherds of the goats were supposed to have their animals fed up with the much-vaunted and rocked meadows from stones .
at the foot of the tree , the mountains covered by the ascent are said to have been relaxed .
meanwhile , the sector has regained its importance , because grazing is actually reappearing on the meadows .
the area is also part of the core area of the biosphere reserve , has further been found out by schneider .
when entering the stone collections , however , be careful not to let the stone you are looking for , because the basalt warmed up by the sun is a popular place of stay for cross users .
a trail leads from underweißbrunn to the tree , which is hidden .
other routes are indicated , the direction high rhoen up and down to a wider view of the valley .
where is the waterburg ?
a watercastle that will be sought at our next task , however , is rarely found at altitude .
the mirror in the digging gives a good impression of the building , but we have some historical buildings in the district , including the building counter-fei .
where is our &quot; piece of rheiner luck &quot; ?

after weeks of tug-of-war , italy &apos;s prime minister and president-in-office of the eu , matteo renzi , has fought against strong conservative resistance at the eu special summit last week to nominate his foreign minister federica mohamed .
renzi considers how the government-oriented newspaper la repubblica reproduces , the vocation of his also in the government team as favorites , mogherini as strengthening the position of social democrats and his own .
it also expects a boost for its &apos; reform package &apos; in italy .
last but not least , renzi hopes that the constantly appealing anti-semitism party base will be able to calm down , because mogherini will not be able to support it , albeit in a moderate way .
the conservative representatives with president jean-claude juncker and the president of the council , mr donald tusk , will be represented , as the prevailing opinion in rome , so that political balance can be achieved .
the chief diplomat of the eu will be deputy for president juncker at the same time .
the eu parliament &apos;s outstanding approval is considered to be safe .
otherwise , president giorgio napolitano would have rejected the nomination of the 41year-old politician of the ruling democratic party ( pd ) hardly any &apos; important recognition &apos; of italy &apos;s role in the eu .
la repubblica spreads optimism that the economic reforms that have been tried and tested for almost two decades in leading party offices , known for their ambitions , have turned to the &quot; enormous challenges &quot; .
the native romans are married and have a couple of daughters .
her party career began with the doctoral political logist in 1996 in the youth organization of the then democratici di sinistra ( left sdemocrats ) , who was in 2008 dealing with catholic center .
in 1999 , mogherini was appointed vice-president of the european community organisation of socialism young people ( european youth welfare organizations ) for three years .
with the 2001 election to the party council of the left democrats , it entered high party politics , worked in the foreign policy department , whose head it was soon to become .
she occupied traditional italian foreign policy priorities such as the middle east , was replaced by studies of nato operations in afghanistan , where italy was attacked with a contingent of troops .
since 2008 she has been a member of the chamber of deputies , where she is an expert on defence and european and international affairs .
when renzi won the premier in february 2014 , he called mogherini to his foreign minister .
if the pd today wants to restore a better relationship to the strong peace movement in the country , which is one of the party &apos;s 40 % votes in the eu elections in may , then , as in pd circles , it will have .
i am very pleased to hear the accusations made in brussels , the new eu foreign representative has too little diplomatic experience , so there is no substance in the pd .
in brussels , the european union is represented , particularly by poland and the baltic members , with a suspicious emphasis on mogherinis on the crisis in ukraine and is described as a &apos; pro-russia &apos; course .
it advocates the development of the pipeline , which is run by the russian company gazprom , which uses russian gas to bypass ukraine directly to southern europe .
after renzi &apos;s term as eu president in july , he travelled to the united states to visit the country &apos;s first visit to moscow .
photos that you took with putin at shake hands were taken in brussels with empathy .

the socialists in france should &apos; keep their mouths and put france in order &apos; said the main ally of francois hollande .
mr valls called for the deeply divided left to reconsider their love .
the president deserves everyone &apos;s respect , he deserves our loyalty , he deserves our support .
&quot; it is our duty to stand by him , &quot; he said with great applause .
as a sobering gesture , the prime minister insisted that his government should not have allowed the 35-hour week in france to continue , despite strong demands for easing the regime by emmanuel macron , the new economic minister .
on saturday , mr hollande urged his fellow socialists to &apos; unite &apos; with the government and to show that they were in agreement with the government .
but christiane taubira , the minister of justice , stretched sand into the gear , where she was caught in a meeting .
marine le pen , the far right leader of the national front , mocked the constant rift of the socialists and said that they had not imagined that the french government would be able to continue the new valls government for more than a few months .
francois hollande is the emperor without clothes , but prince manuel valls has no one , they are forced to form a new government when the old one does not even survive a summer .
&quot; and the new will not survive autumn or winter either , &quot; said miss le pen , supporter .
she reiterated her party ’ s call for parliament to be dissolved and said that she was confident that she would win in early elections and that she was prepared to stand up to the government .
the ruling french party suffered a defeat in the local government elections in march and the right-wing party of france was in the hands of the eu elections in may .
a survey in the sunday newspaper journal du dimanche revealed that 76 % of french people were in favour of the idea of the socialist party of the danger .
pascal perrineau , a political scientist at sciences po university , warned that the french would not be able to take the patience to do so quickly if the new socialist government did not improve the economy and the record .
&quot; there is a small window for possibilities , but public opinion must feel quickly that things are changing , &quot; he warned .
otherwise , the situation could deteriorate further .

pro-hongkong-activists condemn china the day after the election .
a peking-loyal group rolled the chinese flag nearby .
the standing committee of the national people &apos;s congress adopted a framework law on sunday which only allowed two or three candidates to take the lead in hong kong in 2017 .
all candidates must first receive the majority support of a nominating committee , which is expected to work with peking-loyal members .
this decision makes it more difficult for opposition democrats to vote .
political reforms have long been a controversial issue in hong kong ; and party leadership in china fears that china will not be able to respond to other cities .
after the publication of a beijing white paper , which presented the country ’ s dominance of hong kong in june , democratic parties held a referendum on the new constitution .
lis survey is conducted by the hong kong government and the chinese liaison office in hong kong .

putin demands kiev to accept the inclusion of &apos; statehood talks &apos; with eastern ukraine .
russian president vladimir putin demanded russian media reports on sunday that the russian government should not allow the fighting to be won against the separatists in the east of the country and start negotiations directly on &apos; statehood &apos; .
his spokesman , dimitri peskov , later made it clear that putin did not mean that this was under the control of the separatists in eastern ukraine as part of russia , but that his status with ukraine was new .
putin ’ s appeal to the kiev government to negotiate on an equal footing with pro-russian insurgents , however , fits with the policy that he has been seemingly pursuing since the riots began five months ago : help for the palestinians .
in an interview with the state television station channel one , putin condemned ukrainian military campaign to reconquer the country ’ s separatist territories .
the kremlin and the separatists have recently closed the area that was taken as &apos; novorossiya &apos; or &apos; neurus &apos; , a concept that is reminiscent of pre-revolutionary russian imperium .
putin pointed out that all those who are in a position to support ukrainian politicians in their election campaign on 26 october were not prepared to do so , and while government groups were supporting civil communities in the areas held by separatists .
&quot; we need to start extensive talks immediately , not only on technical issues , but also on the political organisation of society and the state status of south-east ukraine , in order to protect the interests of the people living there , &quot; he said .
peskov said that putin ’ s reference to statehood in the context of greater autonomy was to be seen , which has been supported by the kiev leadership for months to fear .
only the ukrainian government can offer the necessary autonomy to the eastern territories , peskov said .
this is not a question of negotiations between ukraine and russia , as peskov said , &apos; because it is not a conflict between russia and ukraine , but an internal conflict in ukraine &apos; .
the kremlin ’ s spokesman for correcting the misinterpretation of putin ’ s remarks underlined the need for leadership by russia in dealing with the separatist rebellion in the east , unlike the direct repression of the direct attacks .
moscow would have far greater difficulty in getting the regions of donetsk and luhansk into eastern ukraine .
the autonomy enjoyed by russian diplomats in international fora would give regional governments in the ukraine full power to take their own trade agreements and external relations .
the eu &apos;s half-blood island , which was annexed five months ago , is the home port for most of russia &apos;s navy and an important commercial port and historic coastal region .
the regions between the rostov region in russia and crimea are also rich in mines , factories and foundries that contain important components for russian military operations .
ukrainian president petro poroshenko suggested , when he opened his office on 7 june , that ukrainian legislation - after new-elections - should be supplemented with constitutional additions that would allow the respective territories to be subject to greater control of their finances .
but his notion of autonomy seems to be in sharp contrast to those of the kremlin and separatist rebels whose armed and revolting forces are motivated by moscow .
putin ’ s last request to kiev to negotiate with separatist leaders on an equal footing followed a similar request from the us .
the separatists supported by russia took over in the hand-over , which , according to ukrainian security officials , was the first step in a campaign to take over the strategic coastal region to crimea , to strengthen control of novoask .
that is why massive civilian and military preparations have started to prevent mariupol , a stahlin industrial producer , from being forced to close down to the port of mary , which is located between novoazovsky and the lake .
poroshenko spoke at a meeting of eu leaders in brussels on saturday and urged action to prevent another russian aggression against ukraine .
&quot; we are on the verge of getting no return , &quot; warned poroshenko .
thousands of foreign troops and hundreds of foreign tanks are now on the territory of ukraine .
the eu summit did not decide on concrete actions , the leadership demanded the drafting of further sanctions against russia , which would be impossible to achieve in the event of an unspecified escalation of the ukrainian crisis .
ukrainian soldiers had to move away from their positions in ilowajsk after two russian tanks and 1,000-soldiers were killed last week in the danube region .
the first presumably 63 ukrainian soldiers killed by the russian invasion of ilowajsk were killed on sunday at 10 russian parachutes .
nude photo scandal around australian celebrities and gabi grecko grecko
geoffrey noblest did not make a hint about his anger about hackers , who probably had naked pictures of his promised gabi grecko and who is who of the a celebrities from hollywood .
the film city is in excitement after a series of unique photos of a naked jennifer lawrence in a hackling scandal to obtain celebrities on the internet .
the hacker responsible for this is probably equipped with 60 naked photos of lawrence , star from &quot; the tribute of panem &quot; and superstars , including the models-kate upton and cara deluxe .
the australian actresses teresa palmer , emily browning , yvonne strahovski , and grecko from melbourne were also supposed to have taken private photos due to an icloud gap .
there are 101 celebrities on the list .
the most precious ones who met with grecko last month said to confession to confidentic : &quot; it is disgusting . &quot;
all private letters and pictures should remain private .
it is a shame that private information is stolen and passed on to others .
grecko , currently in new york , reportedly said that a news website said that the hack was &quot; disgraceful &quot; and that the people affected felt &quot; injured &quot; .
the hacker probably has 30 pictures of palmer with her ex-friend scott speedman , including two pictures where she was up without in a pool .
the film works of palmers include &quot; love is invincible &quot; with liam hemsworth .
palmer , chuck-star strahovski and the actress browning from sucker punch were yesterday available for comments on the chopped images .
a representative lawrence said to tmz : &quot; it is a heinous violation of privacy . &quot;
actors seth rogen condemned the hacker in his tweet : &quot; hacked images from a mobile phone to post is nothing other than the sale of hählerware . &quot;
in purely legal terms , the spread of stolen images should not be tolerated .
cyclists , joggers and hikers were on the big feldberg yesterday at the 8th cycling event and have thus joined the &quot; help for cancer children &quot; association .
the tour , which for one was a tortur , was a very easy training for the other .
in one , however , everyone agreed that it was fun .
thomas studanski will be sleeping well last night .
for the first time in his life , the head of the oberursel brewery yesterday went on a bike to the feldberg .
for the good purpose .
the small muscle cat can be easily cured , especially as it is not allowed to participate in the 8th cycling race on the big feldberg in favour of the association &quot; help for cancer children &quot; ( frankfurt ) .
a great thing .
&quot; i know now that i can - fine ! &quot;
small pets on the way to the applause curve ?
nee , if i had stopped , why not ?
as thomas studanski , who was responsible for the cdu in the oberursel city parliament , many of the 718 participants yesterday in the early stages were agonizing and came close to exhaustion , but happy .
others , on the other hand , have been easier to cross the 11-kilometre long distance between hohemark and feldberg .
norman diessner , for example ,
the red light bulb of the green politician - red , red dress , red bitch - made a big difference at the start .
he is also the track in a slide , as nina kuhn , pressesprecher of the city of oberursel , who worked with frank grüneisen to get on the road .
the triathletes were awarded the &quot; feldberg cycling &quot; not necessarily a sporting challenge : &quot; here it is about charity , because there we are happy to be part of it - we would have a exit today anyway &quot; .
on the way , they had been a member of paul wenzel from oberreifenberg .
the boy ( 12 ) was in the morning down to oberursel to get back to the height immediately .
the frankfurt florian ornament had to leave at 9 a.m. in the morning in the saddle , &quot; made &quot; the feldberg twice to go with fun .
the first part of the album was &quot; fritten-toni &quot; .
for the chief of the oberursel kultkiosk , cycling through the feldberg is simply part of the process .
he had a very good experience with his 6.5-kilo bike .
a crazy event .
for this purpose - and i am happy to be part of this , &quot; andreas balzke said .
the highly trained mainzer says that the user is a &quot; ambitious &quot; racing bike .
it must be , because it was the &apos; fixing wheel &apos; that was used to drive the car , but that is not the case .
the fact that it was going up without a wheel , too , proved not only the 20 hikers who crossed the white wall and the fuchstanz up to the summit , but also a jogger who was on a cord .
bergwacht-doctor professor volker lischke , who with his team , equipped with allwheel bully and quad , for safety .
the 718 participants - and so many as never before - were in groups in the morning .
the hikers first at 9.30 a.m.
the first cyclists and runners followed at 10 a.m.
five minutes later , the first mountain bikers started .
bent hansen , chairman of the association &quot; cycling on the great feldberg &quot; , gave the start commands and wanted the participants a nice trip .
for next year , he hopes that the route will be able to be extended to the feldberg to ensure the safety of the participants .
