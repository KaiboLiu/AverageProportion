re@@ vers@@ al to the very american ideal of labour rights as human rights
the congress members ke@@ ith el@@ lis@@ on and john le@@ w@@ is have tabled a legislative proposal to limit the organisation of trade unions as civil rights .
&quot; just as trade unions die , so are the middle class jobs .
i am therefore proud to present , together with the citizens &apos; right si@@ ster john le@@ w@@ is , the employee authorisation act .
this gr@@ ound@@ breaking law gives workers the same legal opportunities in the event of discrimination on grounds of the organisation of trade unions as in other forms of discrimination - and stops anti-@@ trade union forces .
the addition of the national labour law to a way of ensuring discrimination is being proposed for workers who have been exposed to discrimination to organise trade union representation in order to obtain justice in a civil court - and to claim damages or pun@@ ish@@ ments - is needed .
but it is certainly not a radical initiative - certainly not in accordance with american standards .
indeed , the best way to understand what is happening in el@@ lis@@ on , le@@ w@@ is , and other spon@@ sors of their legislative proposal is to link back to a very american idea .
despite the set@@ backs that the trade unions have suffered in recent years - in vienna and in the netherlands , italy , and the rest of the world - the european union has once been able to force countries around the world to respect labour rights .
there was a time when the millions of americans were still re@@ member@@ ing when that country was building democracy , freedom of speech , freedom of the press and the right of association in one bre@@ ath .
when the united states inv@@ aded japan after world war ii , the general dou@@ gl@@ as mac ar@@ th@@ ur and his staff encouraged the country to adopt a constitution that would allow the country to become a full member of the milit@@ ar@@ ised auto@@ cr@@ acy .
we are fully aware that the workers and their unions are playing a key role in creating a new japan , and they used a language that is explicitly recognised as a japanese language .
when the united states inv@@ aded germany after world war ii , general d@@ wi@@ ght david e@@ is@@ en@@ ho@@ wer and his staff pressed german@@ s to write a constitution that would ensure that the german fas@@ c@@ ism was ad@@ ol@@ f hit@@ ler &apos;s .
recogn@@ ising that the eu ’ s workers would have to organise themselves , and their voice in the new nation , the us and germany added a clause that explicitly called for the creation of a new nation .
agreements that respect this right or that aim to limit it are not acceptable .
when the former first lady eleg@@ ance was founded , the first lady was in charge of the international human rights commission .
for generations , americans have accepted the basic pre@@ mise that labour rights are human rights .
when this country helped other countries to find a way to build civil and democratic societies , the us and the us declared that the right to establish a union - and this is a right that this union should then be involved in collective negotiations as an equal partner - would be .
after these rights have been vio@@ lated in america , it is indeed very wise to ask the american ideal again .
like pa@@ st@@ or martin lu@@ ther king j@@ r. fif@@ ty years ago , “ the world is not the world ’ s largest economy . ”
history is a great teaching master .
now everyone knows that the working movement has the strength of the nation not restricted , but has increased it .
the increase in the standard of living of millions of people has created work in a mir@@ ac@@ ulous way for industry and has brought the entire nation into an un@@ imag@@ in@@ able level of production .
those who have started working are for@@ getting these simple tru@@ ths , but the story preser@@ ves them .
history re@@ members , and we should remember , that .
the formal recognition of labour rights as human rights - and the extension of the protection of civil rights as protection against discrimination in the creation of employee representatives - is long over@@ due .
ke@@ ith el@@ lis@@ on and john le@@ w@@ is re@@ new the ide@@ als that america has been making great in the past , and that re@@ ne@@ ge on the promise of democracy .
judge stops tempor@@ arily the law that all the abor@@ tion clin@@ ics in loc@@ anda are not allowed to close .
a us federal judge stopped the operation on sunday for the time being , implementing a law in lou@@ i@@ si@@ ana , which lawyers say that it is pre@@ sum@@ ably necessary to close all five abor@@ tion clin@@ ics in the state .
this measure , which was proposed by bo@@ b@@ by j@@ in@@ dal , govern@@ or of lou@@ i@@ si@@ ana , in june , was brought to the statute and was adopted on 1 september , would allow doctors who have been abor@@ ted to do so .
the decision of the judge , however , means that doctors must be allowed to continue to carry out legal abor@@ tions for the time being , while they are requ@@ est@@ ing such a right .
&quot; the pla@@ in@@ ti@@ ffs may forward further work in accordance with the law while they are concerned about obtaining these rights , &quot; federal jud@@ ges john de@@ gra@@ v@@ el@@ les wrote in his judgment .
within a month , a hearing will be held for the judge to ensure that the law is made more permanent .
abor@@ tion ad@@ voca@@ tes welcomed the decision to ban the latest in a number of jud@@ gments against similar measures and said that doctors should be given more time to develop their own health insurance .
&quot; today &apos;s decision means that women in l@@ ous@@ i@@ si@@ ana are subjec@@ ted to a dec@@ e@@ it@@ ful law that will depri@@ ve them of their health and their rights , &quot; said n@@ ancy nor@@ th@@ up , president and chairman of the centre for re@@ productive rights , five .
it was not immediately clear whether the judgment would also affect doctors .
lou@@ i@@ si@@ ana is one of 11 states which has adopted similar laws , with courts recently having to take such measures in al@@ ab@@ ama and missi@@ ssi@@ pp@@ i for non-@@ constitutional .
key points of a law in tex@@ as , which covers most of the remaining clin@@ ics in the state to close , were taken by a federal judge on friday .
abor@@ tion ad@@ voca@@ tes and the american college of o@@ stre@@ tr@@ ici@@ ans and gy@@ nec@@ ology are now calling for a ban on abor@@ tion .
abor@@ tion oppon@@ ents do not think that the measures are designed to protect women &apos;s health , although some are also concerned about the effects of closing hospit@@ als .
only a doctor who has been in lou@@ i@@ si@@ ana for abor@@ tions has the patient &apos;s right to in@@ take .
if all other doctors in the state are forced to leave abor@@ tions , the government would be forced to do so out of fear of its safety .
the commission &apos;s argument against the judgment was that the authorities of lou@@ i@@ si@@ ana said that they were not doctors because of the conduct of abor@@ tions .
dela@@ yed diagno@@ ses and lack of access to the best treatments are the result of higher deaths and the death rate from eg@@ g cancer in rural areas .
angel@@ ina jo@@ lie and her brother , james , have a video ho@@ m@@ age for their mother online .
for women in rural australia , the risk of a higher risk of dying of eg@@ g cancer is higher than for women in the rural areas .
researchers analy@@ sed the medical data of more than 1@@ 100 austr@@ ali@@ ans , where in 2005 e@@ gg@@ -@@ stoc@@ king cancer was detec@@ ted , and found that only 25 % were diagno@@ sed five years after the diagno@@ sis .
the research director sus@@ an j@@ ord@@ an of the q@@ im@@ r ber@@ g@@ ho@@ fer medical research institute said that for those who have been living in rural and remote regions of the state , the problem is mort@@ ality .
small study : new drugs could cause l@@ ung and e@@ gg@@ s cancer .
researchers analy@@ sed the medical care of women about seven years .
dr. j@@ ord@@ an said that the age of a woman is very important in diagno@@ sis , the type of eg@@ g cancer , existing pre-@@ conditions and social and economic status .
for older women and those who have cancer to diagno@@ se at the time of diagno@@ sis , the disease was in excess of one in four .
for those who live in rural and remote regions of the state , the average income of the population was around eur 1 billion .
although the study did not examine why outside the city living women with higher education prob@@ ability are more likely to suffer from o@@ vari@@ an cancer , dr. jor@@ dan susp@@ ects a late diagno@@ sis and the lack of access to the best treatments .
&quot; this disease is best treated by gy@@ nec@@ ological on@@ co@@ logi@@ sts , and these are mostly found in larger cities .
despite the improvement in telecommunications services to meet the di@@ stances , the european union proposed a new system of services , as a possible re@@ me@@ dy .
dr. j@@ ord@@ an said that the study was independent of geographical status and that it was a poor long-term survival rate for women in the eg@@ g stock cancer .
the agreement reached by rio t@@ into ride to con@@ qu@@ er cancer is being discussed today in the medical journal of australia .
in march 2013 , el@@ ish@@ a ne@@ a@@ ve , a young mother of 33 years old , was struck by the gold coast by an aggres@@ sive form of o@@ vari@@ an cancer .
garden centres regret falling house ownership and the loss of the property .
the decline , together with an increase in the number of home@@ owners under 35 years of age , could lead to garden centres receiving tens of thousands of p@@ ounds a year if today &apos;s young consumers are still unable to obtain a study by h@@ ta , as reported in the financial services .
the report states that ten@@ ants are on average 55 % of the amount paid , the people with own homes for their garden , and that the amount is 55 % of the total cost of the rental .
the rise in people living in high urban areas is a major problem for the european union .
in the greater london area , where over a period of 6 years the share of home@@ owners of 6@@ 1@@ ,000 homes has fallen from 61 % to 43 % , the lowest expenditure on garden products per household is reported .
h@@ ta and the royal hor@@ tic@@ ul@@ tural society are also close to the point that the housing sector is a source of income for rent or for small gardens .
gu@@ y bar@@ ter , head of the department of the rh@@ s said : &quot; contain@@ er gar@@ den@@ ers are the most popular among ten@@ ants , for example , because they can grow their plants when they move . &quot;
the h@@ ta report identified the period between 1997 and 2005 as the &quot; golden age &quot; of the garden sector retail trade due to rising house owners .
he predic@@ ts that the country will be in better shape this year because of the better weather .
the opposition ’ s political leadership , im@@ ran kh@@ an , and the cl@@ er@@ ical ta@@ h@@ ir@@ u@@ l q@@ ad@@ ri , in pakistan is continuing .

the army of the country is , meanwhile , calling for a political solution to the conflict , &apos; without wa@@ sting time and using force without violence &apos; .
after a meeting in the headquarters on sunday evening , the commission announced that it would withdraw from the agreement .
the military plays a major role in pakistan and has already done so more frequently .

turkey is occup@@ ying us diplom@@ at for sp@@ ying reports .
the turkish ministry of foreign affairs has appointed the world ’ s most senior us diplom@@ at to provide information on a report on american and british es@@ pi@@ on@@ age in turkey .
vice-president b@@ ü@@ l@@ ent said that the business body of the us emb@@ ass@@ y and turkish officials had read the report on monday .

deutsche bahn in n@@ r@@ w announced that it will do everything possible to ensure that the effects are as low as possible .
the g@@ d@@ l , however , did not say where they wanted to strike , so it was difficult to predic@@ t the consequences in concrete terms .

in the evening until 9 p.m. , another 5@@ mm rain fell on the city , after 6.@@ 6@@ mm , which was already visible at night to sunday .

after the winter was over for an early do@@ se of spring last week , the european union &apos;s temperatures fell to a low level on monday .
the bo@@ wed weather conditions probably led to the late arrival of the ship .
the plane should have been flying shortly after 7.@@ 30 p.m. , but was taken off by a wind of j@@ ail@@ s - a su@@ dden change in wind speed or direction over a short distance - and had to be taken off .
wind stor@@ ms reached this point about 50 km / h on the ground on the a@@ el@@ la@@ ide airport .
the flight data showed that the aircraft was also available at a second lan@@ ding flight .
the flight delay caused a significant increase in the number of other flights , including a flight to the united states , including an em@@ i@@ rates flight from du@@ ba@@ i and a qu@@ an@@ ta flight from sy@@ d@@ ney .
for ade@@ la@@ ide , on tuesday a maximum temperature of 16 ° c is predic@@ ted , with possible actors .

while i write this here , my ga@@ ze on the spir@@ al cable , which is the list@@ en@@ er with the phone , and i think : bo@@ ah , as saved as re@@ tr@@ o ?

and if you are still looking for a tube tv in the living room , for example , you simply say that you reject television in principle .
why are these considerations ?
because we are not happy with the i@@ fa &apos;s att@@ aching to the radio tower this week , we are left with an absolute in@@ competence in electronics matters .
the lay@@ man who used to be washing machine and cd player blin@@ dly rul@@ ed the world of war@@ craft .

what should we talk to people who seem to be volun@@ tar@@ ily using quar@@ k ?
in fact , we have been talking about the question of the fact that we are happy to leave our house in the network for some 20 years .
in order to make the yo@@ gh@@ ur@@ t fit itself , so that we can be sure that the fire alarm is on holiday in the mal@@ di@@ ves that it is burning at a level in the working room .
and would it not be wonderful if we were to get air conditioning on our early arrival from the office ... ?
yes , this does require air conditioning .
but a dream will most certainly come true soon : we raise our arms and arms watch , say your l@@ oud &quot; suc@@ king ! &quot; - and at home the d@@ ust vacu@@ um gro@@ wer goes off .
is it wrong ?
everything is in no way less important than a revolution : &apos; the borders between white and brown hair are not being swe@@ pt &apos; , and ra@@ un@@ t is a sec@@ tor@@ -@@ expert , you can use the washing machine with a head@@ phones , you can hear .
from everyday practice we also know that if a new and modern device is really needed , it is necessary to have the battery in place .
another reason for this is that the n@@ ir@@ v@@ ana is not available on the phone for the next radio exhibitions .
israeli children are returning to the country after the war in gaza .
thousands of israeli children from the areas in the vicinity of gaza are being killed .
the school launch brought the missi@@ le attack that was launched in the united states and the united states in the south of israel a sense of joy and expec@@ tation , but the signs of fighting are still fresh .
in the southern town of ash@@ do@@ d , staff of the &quot; pas@@ ho@@ sh &quot; kin@@ der@@ gar@@ ten , who was att@@ acked by a ro@@ cket before entering the town , gran@@ ate spl@@ it@@ ter from the walls .
&quot; we have a bit of fear , but are ex@@ ci@@ ted , &quot; said ron@@ it b@@ art , resid@@ ent in the ki@@ b@@ but@@ z sa@@ ad and there english teachers .
many children from our area urgently need to return to a rout@@ ine .
their 1@@ 1-@@ year-@@ old daughter sh@@ ani b@@ art said that it feels like &quot; a bit more co@@ smo@@ politan &quot; .
&quot; these were difficult times , and we are not out of the house at all , &quot; she said .
president re@@ u@@ ven ri@@ v@@ lin visited the ki@@ b@@ but@@ z near the border with gaza , to express his support .
until a ce@@ as@@ e-@@ fire ended last week , the us government and the united states had thousands of residents in border communities such as sa@@ ad , or left their homes to live in sa@@ fer areas further away from gaza .
many na@@ ha@@ l o@@ z residents , a community in the vicinity of the border with gaza , have been arrested for a young boy of 4 from a palestinian mur@@ der@@ ous gran@@ ate .
the ministry of education announced that about a do@@ zen families were still not returned .
their children were tempor@@ arily arrested in other schools .
prime minister ben@@ jam@@ in net@@ any@@ ah@@ u visited a school in s@@ der@@ ot , a border town with gaza , which was se@@ ve@@ rely tor@@ n by the palestinian sh@@ ell@@ s .
it called on the children to do a lot of learning and said &apos; we will make sure that their knowledge is acquired and offer you security &apos; .
israel and hamas agreed to the peace process last tuesday .
the ce@@ as@@ e@@ fire provided an immediate end to the fighting ; important problems remain un@@ resolved , as the request from hamas to end the occupation of gaza has been made clear .
israel is calling for the dis@@ arm@@ ament of hamas and the han@@ do@@ ver of the bodies of two people killed in the fighting .
a new round of indirect talks is expected to take place this month in egypt .
in the war , more than 2,@@ 100 palestinians were killed , three quarters of them civili@@ ans , and at least 4@@ 94 children are estimated to have been killed by the palestinians and the un .
israel is den@@ ying this information and estimates that it is a very small country with at least half the victims of the violence , but it has not provided any concrete evidence of this information .
on the israeli side , 66 soldiers and six civili@@ ans , including a th@@ ai soldi@@ er , were killed .
hamas and others who are fighting in gaza fi@@ red 4@@ ,@@ 5@@ 91 missi@@ les and mur@@ de@@ rers .
meanwhile , the israeli parliament ’ s military has carried out more than 5@@ ,000 air and other attacks .
the israeli attacks damaged the palestinian authority and destroyed thousands of homes in gaza .
for tens of thousands of people to continue to live in the protec@@ tions and continue fighting , the education authorities have shi@@ fted the start of school last week .
&quot; i hope the school is soon open again so that we can continue learning so as to have children in the world and the jewish children , &quot; said mo@@ ham@@ ma@@ d ash@@ ton .
the hotel is located in the city centre of sa@@ x@@ ony , close to the main railway station and the city centre .
given the vo@@ te-@@ losses of the n@@ p@@ d in sa@@ x@@ ony , c@@ du bun@@ des@@ vi@@ ze thomas stro@@ b@@ l has decided to end the current n@@ p@@ d ban procedure before the federal constitutional court .
berlin - according to the c@@ du bun@@ des@@ vi@@ ze thomas stro@@ b@@ l , the current prohibi@@ tion proceedings against the n@@ p@@ d should be brought to an end before the federal constitutional court .
&quot; the n@@ p@@ d is worse off than the last time &quot; , said stro@@ b@@ l , the n@@ p@@ d manager , who also has the c@@ du head of state in bad@@ en-@@ w@@ ür@@ t@@ tem@@ berg .
this is a welcome development in the right direction and a development that will not surprise me more with the result that the commission has not been given political control .
the n@@ p@@ d was not present at the vote on sunday at the fi@@ ve-@@ percent hur@@ dle .
a first attempt for a ban on the far-@@ right party was in 2003 .
in december 2013 , the federal council , after long preparation , submitted a new application in kar@@ ls@@ ru@@ he .
the federal government and the bun@@ de@@ sta@@ g did not join .
har@@ burg : t@@ ents for new refugees
the new place is where refugees are now being accommo@@ dated in t@@ ents .
the central initial reception for refugees in har@@ burg pla@@ in@@ ly bur@@ sts from all se@@ ams .
now the home affairs authority has three t@@ ents of the red cross next to it .
the district politicians were only briefly informed of the situation - they are not enthusi@@ astic .
&quot; this ha@@ ur@@ uck actions further fuel reservations on the part of the citizens and give the district politicians no opportunity to participate construc@@ tively in the human@@ e housing of refugees .
your party is calling for the district administration to be called upon to take un@@ used houses to sign up for them .
96 refugees can be found in the three t@@ ents .
the reasons for the over@@ crow@@ ding in the first picture are the on@@ slau@@ ght of people seeking help - and the fact that the situation in the country is not satisfactory for the authorities .
many refugees are therefore staying longer than the regular three months .
the house prices have hit the strong@@ est winter increase in seven years , showing a widely observed growth in the price of homes .
the r@@ p data co@@ re@@ log head@@ set is a new , innovative and eas@@ y-@@ to-@@ use tool for home use in the austr@@ ali@@ an capital .
this increase is the total height of the increase in june , july and august at 4.@@ 2 % , the largest increase in winter months since 2007 .
the annual price increase was around 10.@@ 2 % , and more than double the average annual price of the previous year .
the research director of r@@ p data , ti@@ m law@@ less , took the opportunity to say that sy@@ d@@ ney and mel@@ bour@@ ne had created a two-@@ ti@@ er market .
the figures from r@@ p data show that the skin care prices in sy@@ d@@ ney in the past year have fallen by 16@@ .@@ 1 % , in mel@@ bour@@ ne by 1@@ 1.@@ 7 % .
the following markets are ade@@ la@@ ide , br@@ is@@ ban@@ e and dar@@ win , in which the prices are average by five and six percent .
at the other end of the scale is can@@ ber@@ ra , which is characterized by cuts in government spending hard and where the prices are higher than in the year by just 1.@@ 4 % .
mr law@@ less said that the commission &apos;s proposal for a directive was beginning in spring and that it would now increase the prices for the property on sale in the next few months , which would make the market a &quot; real test &quot; .
&quot; if you want to see the constantly high rate of au@@ ction prices , a generally fast sales price , and the increasing demand for items , you have to be careful .
in an opinion to the new press , he contradic@@ ts statements by the managing director pe@@ er med@@ au and at@@ tests to this , &quot; as a fel@@ d@@ her@@ r &quot; .
the style of the college is not this , it is stated in the communication .
the family me@@ d@@ au was already &quot; in the middle of june &quot; about the request of the university .
the statement that the plans will not be announced until july is definitely wrong &apos; , so p@@ ö@@ tz@@ l .
at the same time , he points out that the plans are not a &apos; preliminary draft &apos; or even a &apos; decision &apos; , but &apos; pre@@ feren@@ tial &apos; .
the commissioner responsible for the access is also the need to expand the narrow road up to the castle to a less@@ er degree than the med@@ ina .
of a nine meter wide road , it was and is not mentioned .
it is not , at present , a matter of 5.@@ 50 metres , a metr@@ e wider than before , &apos; explains p@@ ö@@ tz@@ l .
the me@@ d@@ al-@@ operators &apos; argument that their free and shoes are not safe is not true in the future .
the parking is not allowed at all because it is like other public parking places now intelligent .
the local people think of the people who live near the area , but they think of the people living near the area .
the children ’ s cri@@ b ber@@ g@@ w@@ ich@@ tel , located on the site and located on its do@@ or@@ step , provides access to the park dec@@ k , is said to have been “ not affected ” according to the university president .
rather , it points out that &apos; there is not only a child &apos;s cri@@ b , but also a child &apos;s care centre , as well as the residents of the entrance to the fried@@ rich@@ -@@ stre@@ ib@@ -@@ stra@@ ß@@ e and the 800 students of the school .
so it is a lot more than a question of the ves@@ ted interests of mr med@@ au , &apos; p@@ ö@@ tz@@ l said .
whether the criticism of the parent ’ s council of children ’ s na@@ tivity scenes , the extension of the road would be one of the few places that are un@@ spo@@ il@@ t , is justified , &quot; the reader can decide for himself &quot; .
at the beginning of october p@@ ö@@ tz@@ l will be working together with the state construction office b@@ am@@ berg to inform the town counc@@ ils about the construction development of the university by 2020 &quot; and in this connection to address the importance of the new development &quot; .
pe@@ er med@@ au had a meeting last week with the parents of the children &apos;s cri@@ b about the plans of the university .
so the allocation of access to the new par@@ k@@ dec@@ k should not be via the camp@@ us and the fried@@ rich@@ -@@ stre@@ ib@@ -@@ stra@@ ß@@ e as before , but via the me@@ d@@ al-@@ berg .
this would have to put the narrow road to about one kil@@ ome@@ tre long two-@@ lan@@ e .
according to the me@@ ij@@ i ’ s estimates , transport in the park of ho@@ hen@@ f@@ els would increase ten@@ fold .
from about 2000 vehicles daily , there is talk .
the city has been trying to avoid making a statement on the project .
g@@ land@@ or@@ f is made of hand@@ ball national team .
hol@@ ger g@@ land@@ or@@ f will no longer be used for the dh@@ b team .
the 3@@ 1-@@ year-@@ old from the bun@@ des@@ lig@@ a s@@ g fl@@ ens@@ bur@@ g-@@ han@@ de@@ wit@@ t led to a higher level of health problems for this decision .
the decision was not easy for me , it has been ri@@ pe for several months .
it is time for me to respond to the signals of my body and to start my career in the national team .
it therefore goes hand in hand with a balance sheet of 16@@ 7 country mat@@ ches and 5@@ 76 goals for germany in international reti@@ rement .
because the ro@@ cking back@@ room player is not able to play the champi@@ ons league winner , he is not only a few years old on to@@ reg@@ ag@@ d .
the ic@@ el@@ an@@ dic people who will be leaving their country for the country games on tuesday , will be able to lead the world cup in g@@ land@@ or@@ f .
his ideas and approaches have just as enthusi@@ astic as they have been my long-@@ time fellow players and my success@@ ors .
but for my club i would also like to be healthy in the next years , and for this we need longer reg@@ ener@@ ation periods , which will be the current double load .
the left hand han@@ der had a strong majority in the house in 2012 after a he@@ el inf@@ ection .
because of ach@@ ill@@ es &apos; problems , he had moved from team doctors to the german hand@@ b@@ all@@ b@@ all@@ und ( dh@@ b ) with a cor@@ tis@@ on injec@@ tion , which was later a strong infl@@ am@@ mation .
an emergency operation and two other interven@@ tions followed .
then , g@@ land@@ or@@ f had fil@@ ed a compla@@ int against the team doctor , the dispute ended with a comparison .
twelve years of professional and ele@@ ven years of national team career go by no means without a tr@@ ace .
i have some health works , which i do not ignore any more .
after the three inf@@ ec@@ tious foot operations in the united states in 2012 , the european union has been able to make a significant contribution to reducing blood pressure .
in this regard , there are a number of other complaints relating to wear and te@@ ar .
the first of the year i noticed that the commission is not going to control my head , but my body is not able to dec@@ ei@@ ve , &quot; said g@@ land@@ or@@ f in the interview .
for a com@@ e@@ back , he would only be able to provide an absolute emergency .
&quot; if all the k@@ nit@@ ts te@@ ar , i am always willing to talk , &quot; said the double family father of the magazine .
however , i cannot see the years i have had to play hand@@ ball in one hand .
i must also say that i think , after a long stay in hospital , that i was also quite hum@@ ble in terms of my health .
after my career , i would like to be at least somewhat straight .
in addition to the 2007 world championship title and the winning of the champi@@ ons league 20@@ 14 , he won the 2008 ( h@@ s@@ g n@@ ord@@ hor@@ n ) and 2010 ( t@@ b@@ v le@@ m@@ go ) the e@@ h@@ f-@@ cup .
in 2012 , he also secured a contract with fl@@ ens@@ burg to win the european cup of the cup winners .
german economy in the spring of this year sh@@ run@@ k by 0.@@ 2 % , and the economy fell by 0.@@ 2 % .
the crises surrounding the world have highlighted the german economy in the second quarter .
gross domestic product is a s@@ lu@@ mp from april to the end of june 20@@ 14 compared to the previous quarter by 0.@@ 2 % .
the european parliament &apos;s statistical office informed the latter and confirmed that the data were available for preliminary calcu@@ lations .
consumption alone accounts for about half of the world ’ s economy in the spring , while investment dec@@ lined .
the eu ’ s external trade slow@@ ed down .
thanks to the strong annual start , the company ’ s first half of the year has a total gdp plus of 0.@@ 8 % compared to the second half of 2013 .
hor@@ st@@ mar was the starting point and the goal of the &quot; m@@ ün@@ ster@@ land@@ -@@ mo@@ o@@ i@@ ste &quot; , which was first introduced by the bur@@ g@@ man@@ n@@ s@@ stadt on sunday .
the bur@@ g@@ man@@ n@@ stadt hor@@ st@@ mar experienced a bur@@ g@@ man@@ n-@@ like inv@@ asion of dutch &quot; fe@@ ver ri@@ der &quot; on sunday .
the biggest cycling association in the netherlands , n@@ t@@ f@@ u , organized the so-called &quot; m@@ ün@@ ster@@ lan@@ de mo@@ o@@ i@@ ste &quot; .
the camera has a very high speed and a very high speed internet connection .
more than 1000 participants than@@ ked their registration with j@@ os ter hu@@ er@@ ne for the organization of this tour through the munich re region .
the german federal ministry of education and research ( b@@ mb@@ f ) has published a list of the most important german and international publications on this tour .
we come from the her@@ oes and are driven over@@ night to take part in this tour .
we would like to welcome the m@@ ün@@ ster@@ land in this way , too , &quot; said the cy@@ cli@@ sts were delighted by the route through the ste@@ in@@ furt , bor@@ ken and co@@ es@@ fel@@ d districts .
after registration in the association ’ s home of sch@@ ü@@ tz@@ en@@ bru@@ der@@ schaft sta .
k@@ ath@@ ar@@ ina was on a small &quot; peace journey &quot; through the city over the wall , where the start was also made .
the ro@@ tation that followed for three different categories led to the first of the three routes towards her@@ ren@@ hol@@ z over the sch@@ ö@@ pp@@ inger berg in the direction of co@@ es@@ fel@@ d and via ha@@ vi@@ x@@ bec@@ k and b@@ ill@@ er@@ bec@@ k back to hor@@ st@@ mar .
on routes of 95 kilometres with 1@@ 17@@ 5 levels , the 120 kilometres with 14@@ 75 metres of al@@ titude and 14@@ 5 kilometres with 17@@ 75 metres of al@@ titude , the cy@@ cli@@ sts have proved their good condition .
the hotel was built in 18@@ 90 and it is located in the heart of the city of ha@@ vi@@ x@@ bec@@ k .
the main organiz@@ er jo@@ s ter hu@@ er@@ ne and may@@ or he@@ in@@ z l@@ ö@@ l@@ fing showed up on the success of this cycling event .
we are satisfied and it was a wonderful experience for all parties .
the organization was running without problems and there was no negative inci@@ dents , &quot; he pre@@ fers to attract l@@ ö@@ l@@ fing a positive conclusion .
unfortunately , not so many participants came to the event as the organiz@@ er had hoped , which probably was due to the bad weather forec@@ asts and the morning sun@@ set .
&quot; we are facing a new era in 20@@ 15 , hopefully in good weather on 30 august or during another weekend , &quot; said the cy@@ cli@@ sts , but they promised to return to the m@@ ün@@ ster@@ land and the organis@@ ers are planning a new edition .
kon@@ stan@@ tin w@@ ec@@ ker &apos;s g@@ ently honest mem@@ o@@ irs are a real treas@@ ure of the world .
it is actually more philosoph@@ ical testi@@ mony than bio@@ graphy .
non-@@ chron@@ o@@ log@@ ically , but more ideas , and more ideas , are needed .
and he is gent@@ le , honest : from the on@@ an@@ ie as a gy@@ m@@ na@@ si@@ ast to the la@@ den thi@@ ev@@ es and drug use .
also , to show how he himself is toler@@ ant of the handling of his fellow human beings .
the hotel is also located in the centre of the city , in the heart of the old town , in the heart of the old town , in the old town , in the old town .
and he also explains his pacific spirit , his social and political criticism , his political commitment - and also how he did not only listen to music ( the opera house ) .
the latter has the li@@ be@@ man kon@@ stan@@ tin alarm also to the as@@ ce@@ tic mon@@ k .
between all the ho@@ stages , there is also a short an@@ ec@@ d@@ ote to the earth : about the be@@ at@@ ings in a country dominated by g@@ is .
here , too , he is ru@@ th@@ lessly honest .
len@@ ny hen@@ ry : my father never took me into the arm .
never said &quot; i love you &quot; , i love you &quot; and i never said &quot; you &quot; .
hen@@ ry was one of seven children of a jam@@ a@@ ic@@ an immi@@ grant family in du@@ d@@ ley in the mid@@ lands in 195@@ 8 .
his father , who died when hen@@ ry was 19 , worked in a factory in which her relationship was limited .
hen@@ ry is re@@ hear@@ sing for a com@@ edy , ru@@ dy &apos;s rare records , and the new york times , some of which were based on an imag@@ inary con@@ vers@@ ation with his father .
the sound@@ track is a mix@@ ture of reg@@ ga@@ e and ra@@ p , with lively me@@ lo@@ dies .
but hen@@ ry had to be replaced by some difficult child@@ hood moments .
he attended &quot; many &quot; therap@@ ies after the death of his mother , and hen@@ ry is th@@ ough@@ t@@ ful about his relationship with his father .
it was difficult to know him .
you never saw his face , heard only his voice : &quot; listen with the cr@@ ack on .
let your si@@ ster rest .
get away from it !
i want cr@@ ick@@ et .
my older bro@@ thers se@@ y@@ m@@ our and hil@@ ton - who have already grown up when i was a child - went with him to the pu@@ b and talked about things that i could do with the form of beer glass or the beauty of a beer .
i never had such a con@@ vers@@ ation with him .
much of my life was devoted to this serious type in the corner that the newspaper read .
recently opened hen@@ ry a foun@@ dry in du@@ d@@ ley , and although the conditions are better than too late in his father &apos;s day , he won a one-@@ of-@@ a-@@ kind insight into how life was for him .
it is now a little bri@@ ghter , but they are dark , smo@@ ked , deep sty@@ g@@ ical lab@@ y@@ r@@ in@@ th with fl@@ ame sho@@ cks and smo@@ ke and much so@@ ot .
my father used to be simply in the tu@@ b and then he could be heard slowly as he was sing@@ ing .
when i came here , i was told that the european union was not going to do that for years .
nevertheless , hen@@ ry grew up as a child without love testi@@ mon@@ ies from his parents .
my father embr@@ ac@@ ed me never , he never said &quot; i love you &quot; .
only when my mother died at the end of her life , we began to &quot; i love you , i love you , i love you &quot; .
with its own subsidiary cheap , with d@@ wn fly , the company has been able to share the love that he has earned as a child .
could you please talk to the &quot; i love you &quot; ?
listen to the story of me !
dad , i am 22 !
da@@ wn fren@@ ch .
why should we not be friends ?
it is a great mother .
it is still with fren@@ ch , but i think it is a good idea to have 25 years old .
da@@ wn is a good person .
why should we not be friends ?
it is a great mother .
hen@@ ry &apos;s own mother was di@@ abe@@ tic .
this contributed to her death .
so when i was very , very over@@ weight and symp@@ t@@ oms of di@@ abe@@ tes showed , my doctor said &quot; you have to be radical .
so i pul@@ led this fitness through and also had to carry a dr@@ astic di@@ et to reduce the symp@@ t@@ oms .
it is very difficult .
and it is ti@@ ring .
no one li@@ kes to eat car@@ ro@@ ts .
hen@@ ry &apos;s career change is perhaps reflected in his elegant , short cut book , which is now available in the print media .
since he was elected by the cri@@ tics for his o@@ th@@ ell@@ o , he has been the most uni@@ fied of the theatre .
the first was the com@@ edy of the mistakes that were made , and then f@@ ences of august wil@@ son .
this is another experience than the sit@@ com@@ s and ko@@ m@@ ö@@ di@@ en , who have been doing their business in full .
he began with only 16 years when he was in a factory .
a d@@ j discovered him on stage , when he was im@@ it@@ ating people and writing to new fam@@ ed d@@ j .
his television career began in the mid-@@ 197@@ 0s . &quot; i was responsible for a rather long period of the only black im@@ it@@ ator / com@@ edi@@ an on television . &quot;
he learned to work .
i had to fle@@ e not only from the public eye , but also from 197@@ 5 to 198@@ 5 , as i was able to develop an efficient jo@@ ke nar@@ ra@@ tive machine while i was watching a star through television , and that was really difficult .
len@@ ny 197@@ 5 at new faces
since his manager has been the stage law at the black and white mines , he has been a member of the le@@ ip@@ zi@@ g music society for many years .
my family was very un@@ comfortable .
i wish some@@ how that it would never have happened , but i regret that i am not able to do so .
it was a strange , un@@ pleasant position for me , but i worked on giant things like the one i learned to do .
but this &quot; years of awar@@ d-@@ winning work of art &quot; is not the only way to get the british television into the picture .
by introducing fi@@ gur@@ ines , which will be the british black culture both deri@@ ded and fi@@ red , the hen@@ ry worked in the 198@@ 0s to create an alternative com@@ edy circle .
the first series of len@@ ny hen@@ ry show went on broad@@ cast in 198@@ 4 , and in the 199@@ 0s he was among others the ch@@ ef of the kitchen gare@@ th black@@ lo@@ ck in the com@@ edy bar series ch@@ ef !
advertising , docum@@ entary films , tv series and film roles are the main factors of his next decade , but after his bb@@ c series len@@ ny@@ hen@@ ry@@ .@@ tv 2008 d@@ ared to be a &quot; what is it ?
then came a docum@@ entary series for radio 4 entitled w@@ hat &apos; s so great about ... ?
the first episode was about sha@@ k@@ es@@ pe@@ are .
sha@@ kes@@ pe@@ are was a regular guest at the hotel .
i had a lot of fun at school and i never thought i could do anything about him .
so i was very afraid of it .
all of us who have been inter@@ viewed for the show , peter hall , tre@@ v@@ or n@@ un@@ n , adri@@ an les@@ ter , jud@@ i den@@ ch said &quot; you should try it .
make it not bad if you do not know what you are talking about .
take a few of the words in your mouth , and then you &apos;ll understand that you are all sh@@ ack@@ es@@ pe@@ are so dear .
hen@@ ry led 20 lines from o@@ th@@ without &apos;s last speech for the docum@@ entary and he was enthusi@@ astic .
i felt that the first thing i could do was to do that .
it was almost as if someone had taken my head at last .
&quot; that &apos;s what it is all about , it &apos;s a serious matter , take them seriously , listen to your text , search a bit .
the sam@@ ples were brut@@ al and i read this piece for months , before we had done it .
and it was a success .
they seemed to be a car accident , and that happened .
and soon he joined the com@@ edy of the error of the book .
suddenly i was in the national theatre and i could hardly believe it .
there was a moment when i thought that the &quot; o@@ h , you &apos;ve been changing . &quot;
there was a technical error and hen@@ ry felt inst@@ inc@@ tive that he had to inter@@ act with the audience .
&quot; a small voice told me &quot; you have to spend 10 minutes now to get out of the computer .
instead , the book ’ s director , who said that the idea was going forward once the problem was resolved , said that the problem was not solved .
i went from the stage and anything was a bit of a &quot; o@@ h , god was there &quot; .
i am not responsible for this .
i can tell someone else .
&quot; you play in a play that is , stay in your role . &quot;
hen@@ ry in f@@ en@@ ces am du@@ ch@@ ess theatre , new york : the new york times .
you can find the text for f@@ ences in a very demanding way .
pan@@ ic is very good , it strength@@ ens the long@@ ings .
that too was good , it is just like a big sign of the go@@ ds , which tell me &quot; that is your determination here &quot; .
he says so , of course , with a th@@ under@@ ing voice .
so i stand by it .
i really love that .
i love to live in a sample room , but i don &apos;t know what to do .
hen@@ ry , however , still has the head of a com@@ edi@@ an - our con@@ vers@@ ation is of hum@@ or@@ ous er@@ up@@ tions while he always im@@ it@@ ates people .
i decided not to use stand@@ -up copy as a means of creating a new image .
if we are constantly looking for this , we are going to a wall .
i sometimes meet live in apo@@ llo , but when i come to see the video , i have a lot of fun .
i ask him whether he ever has ever held a stand@@ -up com@@ edy tour .
the fun i had in a room with a director , and the fact that i was able to make a start , a middle and an end to a journey - i do not think i was ever able to give up that .
is this really his new inc@@ ar@@ nation ?
i think so .
i am happy to be an actor .
it is fun .
it is always said that history is a great story .
i love stories .
people love stories .

in the conflict between shi@@ a hu@@ th@@ i re@@ be@@ ls and the y@@ em@@ en@@ i government , the hu@@ tu ’ s leaders have led to civil dis@@ o@@ be@@ di@@ ence in the capital , san@@ a@@ a .

the hotel is also very close to the train station .
y@@ em@@ en@@ i media report a traffic cha@@ os in the capital .
according to the online edition of the newspaper &quot; ye@@ men post &quot; , hu@@ thi@@ -@@ fü@@ r@@ m@@ ali@@ k al-@@ hu@@ th@@ i had a meeting on sunday evening on the measures .
hu@@ th@@ i threatened to leave the country , according to the sheet , with another es@@ cal@@ ation of the conflict , if his demands were not met .
the shi@@ a hu@@ th@@ is are fighting for greater independence from the sun@@ ni rul@@ ed y@@ em@@ en , demanding the re@@ sign@@ ation of the government .
the tri@@ be of the hu@@ th@@ i has been be@@ sie@@ ging the y@@ em@@ en@@ i capital for almost two weeks .
around 30@@ ,000 re@@ be@@ ls have been arrested in protest camps at the major access routes to san@@ a@@ a .

ken@@ ya regi@@ sters officials to &quot; viol@@ ate the spirit workers &quot; .
ken@@ ya has begun to take all bio@@ e@@ try officials bi@@ ome@@ tr@@ ically to &apos; s@@ g@@ ho@@ d@@ ge@@ -@@ employed &apos; from the pay lists of the government .
employees who are in the next two weeks not registered will be not registered any@@ more , they were a government announcement .
the government susp@@ ects that thousands of people will be killed even after they have left the public service .
president u@@ hur@@ u ken@@ y@@ att@@ a promised at his term of office in 2013 to end corruption in the public service .
when exam@@ ining the report at the beginning of this year it was found that at least 1 million $ ( 7@@ 00@@ ,000 £ ) per month of g@@ host workers payments and other ab@@ uses were caused by other financial practices .
the government susp@@ ects that sal@@ aries will continue to be paid on accounts that have been assigned to a person .
all officials must now be able to take part in the identification centres in the next two weeks to ensure that their data is available via bi@@ ome@@ tric regi@@ stra@@ tions , was reported in a government message .
all those who did not do this without a credible exc@@ use would be disappointed by the sal@@ ary list .
&quot; this approach will make a significant contribution to the ra@@ tion@@ alisation of public service by reducing the actual number of officials and also by reducing the sal@@ ary list on both levels of government - as is the case with the g@@ host employees .

in the case of the case , it is stated that ach@@ en@@ bach has made a significant contribution to the purchase of works of art and v@@ int@@ age cars and that ber@@ th@@ old al@@ bre@@ cht has calculated higher than actual purchase prices .
this also means that the commission agreed to be higher .
ach@@ en@@ bach has won 12@@ 1 million euros in valu@@ ables for al@@ bre@@ cht .

44 years he was in school , 23 of which were in charge of school .
from this time man@@ f@@ red rich@@ ter knows many ro@@ d pe@@ ter@@ sha@@ us@@ en and k@@ ol@@ l@@ b@@ ach@@ er from their time as a student .
his methods were sometimes un@@ conventional , but always wor@@ n by his desire to live in the student .
the snow@@ -@@ cap@@ ped mountains of the alps are the most famous mountain in the giant mountains .
man@@ f@@ red rich@@ ter lo@@ ves the painting with the mo@@ ti@@ f of his home .
jud@@ ges were born in tr@@ au@@ ten@@ au / north bo@@ hem@@ ia in 19@@ 30 , today tr@@ ut@@ no@@ v .
the first of his 14 years was in the age of 14 , and he was already interested in his teacher &apos;s profes@@ sion .
one year on , the su@@ de@@ ten german@@ s were ex@@ propri@@ ated .
within half a hour , the family had to leave their home .
after a few months in one camp , the first flight was in 194@@ 6 to bav@@ aria - in the freight wag@@ on .
so he for@@ ged jud@@ ges into the upper fran@@ con@@ ian sen@@ k@@ endor@@ f .
the teachers ’ education took place in b@@ am@@ berg .
to this end , man@@ f@@ red rich@@ ter had to go to the next station six times a week , by train to b@@ am@@ berg , three kilometres across the whole city to school .
after two months , man@@ f@@ red rich@@ ter got a red cross home in ba@@ den , germany .
in 195@@ 1 he made the first and in 195@@ 4 after three years of le@@ h@@ ram@@ t@@ an@@ war@@ ter the second state exam@@ . in 195@@ 1 he was appointed to the state academy .
since ob@@ er@@ fran@@ z is not a free teacher for him , he applied for a job in upper bav@@ aria and came to the bav@@ arian state school on november 1 , 195@@ 4 .
the &quot; m@@ illing machine room &quot; was its first &quot; service apartment &quot; in the school house .
in 195@@ 8 , he again made teaching material at the newly built teachers ’ house next to the school .
this house bought man@@ f@@ red rich@@ ter in 1980 , after the school in k@@ ol@@ bach dis@@ solved in 196@@ 8 .
until then , there were no such cases in k@@ ol@@ bach in the school association pe@@ ter@@ sha@@ us@@ en-@@ k@@ ol@@ l@@ bach and in pe@@ ter@@ sha@@ us@@ en five .
from the school year 196@@ 8 / 69 these were published in pe@@ ter@@ sha@@ us@@ en in the town hall today .
when the school association in@@ der@@ s@@ dorf was founded , only the school &apos;s primary school remained in the village .
to avoid a down@@ grade in the now smaller school , the us government changed its position to the college of economics , geor@@ g si@@ g@@ l .
but pe@@ ter@@ sha@@ us@@ en grew , and so the children and their teachers could learn from september 198@@ 2 the current construction , which was completed in 1997 after the reti@@ rement of jud@@ ges .
man@@ f@@ red rich@@ ter p@@ raised the un@@ complicated gener@@ os@@ ity of the then may@@ or lu@@ d@@ wi@@ g g@@ ö@@ tz , who was also responsible for a community cost and for the extension of 1997 cel@@ lar rooms , although this was after the directives .
&quot; may@@ or g@@ ö@@ tz was very kind to school &quot; , re@@ mem@@ bered jud@@ ges .
throughout his career , man@@ f@@ red rich@@ ter has never heard a government representative &apos;s speech , which was directed at a department of a school council on law and justice .
&quot; you have to make the children two things : roots and w@@ ings , &quot; says the current 8@@ 4-@@ year-@@ old .
and he had to know : &quot; this does not always succeed &quot; .
in any case , jud@@ ges do sometimes un@@ conventional , .
if students are re@@ viewed , they get it not because of him a p@@ uni@@ tive work and were not arrested for being se@@ ated afterwards .
at the expense of the community jud@@ ges had two pa@@ irs of bo@@ x@@ ing glo@@ ves and left the two counter@@ parts to compete , even if they were a v@@ w .
for the good of the school , jud@@ ges used a good relationship with the then may@@ or lu@@ d@@ wi@@ g g@@ ö@@ tz ( c@@ su ) .
this moved the par@@ tis@@ an judge to reti@@ re to the court of justice in 1996 at least as the last on the c@@ su list for the municip@@ al council .
but jud@@ ges were de@@ ferred to number six and joined the c@@ su .

hr@@ 4 bike tour 700 cy@@ cli@@ sts will be staying in the spa park of bad salz@@ haus@@ en and sch@@ ot@@ ten sto@@ po@@ vers .
if cy@@ cli@@ sts are on their tour in bad salz@@ haus@@ en or sch@@ ot@@ t , this is not in itself a special experience .
on friday , however , the number of r@@ aging impres@@ sions alone made it clear that the 700 participants of the hr@@ 4 cycling tour and accompan@@ ying tro@@ ss enjoyed a break in the lower spa park in bad salz@@ haus@@ en and later a party under free .
under the mo@@ tto &quot; cycling and celebr@@ ating on newly discovered paths between ni@@ d@@ da and kin@@ zi@@ g &quot; , participants had to meet in bad vil@@ bel on thursday and make a concert by van ba@@ ker &amp; band mit@@ ter@@ li@@ e@@ ben .
on friday , it was taken seriously : cy@@ cli@@ sts took the first stage , which is 60 km across fl@@ ora town to bad salz@@ haus@@ en and further to sch@@ ot@@ ten .
in bad salz@@ haus@@ en , the athle@@ tes were trained by may@@ or han@@ s-@@ peter s@@ eu@@ m , who was in bad vil@@ bel with the bicycle in order to make a start on the company ’ s own business in bad salz@@ haus@@ en , pe@@ tra sch@@ wer@@ ther .
for refres@@ h@@ ment of body and mind , all kinds of good things were prepared : the rural women from ran@@ stadt and ni@@ e@@ der@@ -@@ mo@@ ck@@ stadt had 85 br@@ ass apple , to use their own , stre@@ tch and weight .
&quot; such ca@@ kes can only ba@@ ke agricultural women , &quot; p@@ raised a particip@@ ant from a@@ ul@@ en@@ di@@ e@@ bach , while he was or@@ dering another piece .
the bar at the tur@@ n@@ club ge@@ is@@ s-@@ nic@@ h@@ t-@@ ni@@ d@@ da was used to cool cold refres@@ h@@ ments .
the du@@ o bra@@ vo is a very popular meeting place for the visitors .
the beautiful ambi@@ ence of the park has been relaxing .
a mr. gen@@ os@@ s also enjoyed a head massage from his partner : &quot; he earned it , after all he has already dro@@ pped off today bicycle cha@@ ins .
meanwhile , the may@@ or and the business manager had to work : they were bur@@ ied at the foun@@ tain before the drinking cure house of re@@ porter ra@@ iner jan@@ ke .
promo@@ tional ch@@ ef tom@@ is@@ la@@ v h@@ agen , since the first hr@@ 4 cycling tour 2004 , has also been able to perform only short .
his pic@@ k@@ up tr@@ uck , where he was shot by three tele@@ phones and a radio unit with his employees and the 15@@ -@@ member staff , was a great success .
&quot; the majority of participants come from the rhe@@ in-@@ main@@ -@@ region , &quot; he told the german federal ministry of economics and technology , &quot; but also from foun@@ dry or ful@@ da , lau@@ ter@@ bach or ta@@ un@@ us and even from numerous cities in western fl@@ ori@@ da .
the number of participants is a bit different from the number of nights available .
in category i , participants will be accommo@@ dated in hotels , in category ii in collective accommodation .
from the spa , the cy@@ cli@@ sts had a good impression when they arrived after one and a half hours : &quot; b@@ ust ! &quot;
&quot; it was nice to be in bad salz@@ haus@@ en ! &quot; they w@@ av@@ ed to leave .
after arriving in scotland , i was allowed to take a short snow@@ -@@ break .
but in the evening the cy@@ cli@@ sts were in the id@@ yl@@ lic al@@ te@@ bur@@ g@@ park .
under the direction of the scot@@ tish society for tourism and city marketing ( g@@ ts ) , the park had a nice fe@@ st@@ ambi@@ ente and of course it had been prepared to ta@@ p ta@@ sty , some fl@@ am@@ m@@ ca@@ kes with well-@@ cool@@ ed white fea@@ ther .

the three showed themselves to be delighted with the &quot; many operations in scotland &quot; .
d@@ j to@@ bi@@ as h@@ agen then gave the d@@ ancing stage free .
the opportunity to enjoy the fl@@ our@@ ishing movement under the sky was not missed despite the sporting activities on the bike .
among the guests were increasingly citizens who were elected by the good mo@@ od as well as the great s@@ cour@@ ge of cy@@ cli@@ sts .
on the second day , cy@@ cli@@ sts were able to visit the stations of bir@@ stein , w@@ ä@@ ch@@ ter@@ s@@ bach and bad or@@ b - including a concert with the tren@@ k@@ wal@@ d@@ ers .
yesterday , after 18@@ 0 kilometres of cycling , i met the sports enthusi@@ asts again in bad vil@@ bel .
do@@ z@@ ens of turkish police officers are still in prison for &quot; con@@ spir@@ acy &quot; against the government .
33 police officers were killed in turkey due to the susp@@ ici@@ on of &quot; con@@ spir@@ acy against the government &quot; .
the police authorities did not give any immediate comment .
among the arrested were 14 high-@@ ran@@ king polic@@ em@@ en , mel@@ d hu@@ gh@@ es , and the police .
some of them were involved in the corruption investigation of government officials , including four government ministers last december .
in july , a number of turkish police officers were arrested for having sup@@ pos@@ ed@@ ly committed an organised criminal association and calling numbers for them to be used .
the turkish president rec@@ ep ta@@ y@@ y@@ ip er@@ do@@ ğ@@ an ( who was then prime minister ) described her actions as part of the activities that were carried out by the islamic cl@@ er@@ gy fe@@ th@@ ul@@ la g@@ ü@@ l@@ len against him and others .
not all children in ukraine are returning to school .
schools almost everywhere in ukraine opened a new office on monday ( september 1 ) after the summer holidays .
this day is tradi@@ tionally an important day for families , and like thousands of other ukra@@ inian parents , prime minister ar@@ sen@@ i@@ j j@@ az@@ en@@ ju@@ k brought his daughter to school .
the council then informed waiting journalists that the new government had not re@@ opened all schools , but that it was determined to leave the country for future generations : the european union , the united states , the united states , and the united states .
the september celebra@@ tions were not held in every school .
the sky is not everywhere above ukraine peaceful .
we must ensure that the sky is peaceful .
the whole of ukraine , a huge common ukra@@ inian national front , must be ready for a peaceful sky .
ale@@ k@@ san pa@@ stu@@ k@@ how , school director of the school in sla@@ v@@ jan@@ sk , the j@@ az@@ en@@ ju@@ k daughter visited , spoke to russian .
we hope that the new peace will finally be restored here and that the children will be given an education that will be useful to them in the future .
the first day of the school year is tradi@@ tionally celebrated .
with ron@@ a fair@@ head , the bb@@ c has perhaps made the great director , the man she needs .
it is a proud ru@@ m of the european union .
and it has its own fron@@ t-@@ end experience .
her career began with the global management consulting company bas@@ in and co . , which was the focus of her work on mor@@ gan stan@@ ley , bom@@ ba@@ di@@ er , ic@@ i and the media world of pe@@ ar@@ s@@ ons .
she was a member of the board of directors of the financial times for seven years , and re@@ signed when the chief position of the parent company pe@@ ar@@ s@@ ons was transferred to a younger male colleague .
your payment was alle@@ ge@@ dly almost 1 million £ .
their political ran@@ k@@ ings are also sound .
she was david camer@@ on of lord brown , the chief of the former chairman of b@@ p , when he was asked for more private knowledge in wh@@ it@@ en@@ ess .
her hus@@ band is a former tor@@ y council member .
as early as may , i described the role of chairman with a po@@ is@@ oned cup .
not only is the bb@@ c a huge and complex entity in the heart of public life , but there are also an internal par@@ ado@@ x in its structure .
confidence is in two directions : in@@ war@@ dly on the first guard of its own management hier@@ arch@@ y in the bb@@ c , but also ou@@ tw@@ ar@@ dly as a voice of public concern and dis@@ quiet when things are going wrong .
this ensures an almost un@@ ten@@ able du@@ o@@ pol , which is re@@ sumed after a complete comprehensive reform .
but what new coming chairman would it be ris@@ ky to say ?
it is a difficult task .
and as if that were not enough , the many are still interested in making the bb@@ c smaller .
while the competition is getting closer and new technologies are bringing back old , comfortable col@@ lateral , the threat of negotiation is still very important for the b@@ bb@@ c .
for the modest sum of eur 14@@ 5.@@ 50 per year , the european commission &apos;s public purch@@ ases itself in the largest media company in the world .
the bb@@ c tells a good story : it says that the world was 96 % of all house@@ holds and that only 40 p@@ ence per day is paid .
and apparently , the bse crisis is rising on the popul@@ arity page .
the vision and usage hab@@ its for the bb@@ c have changed .
but it remains a very be@@ loved and significant figure .
it needs a considerable chairman - i hope that you have supported it .
per@@ ry from tex@@ as says that down@@ gr@@ ading t@@ we@@ et is not authorized .
a t@@ we@@ et from the official account of the republic@@ an govern@@ or of the tex@@ as region , ric@@ k per@@ ry , on sunday included a her@@ ald of di@@ min@@ ishing news about the democratic district government prosecu@@ tor , who was at the heart .
t@@ we@@ et was subsequently deleted and replaced by another one by per@@ ry &apos;s user account , which allows the previous withdrawal from the site .
a tv tun@@ er is just from my account sent out .
&quot; i approve of the t@@ we@@ et and i have deleted it , &quot; he said .
employees of per@@ ry did not respond immediately to requests for comments .
although t@@ wee@@ ts from per@@ ry &apos;s official blog user account are exp@@ ired , it was not clear who actually created the feed .
in the former t@@ we@@ et , an un@@ favourable outcome was found in the district ’ s public prosecu@@ tor , tra@@ vis county , ros@@ em@@ ary le@@ h@@ m@@ berg , who was the first to be sent@@ enced to death in april 2013 .
per@@ ry put a ve@@ to on financial support for her office , when she was ref@@ using to accept the withdrawal , which led to a charge of the per@@ ry - the possibly 20@@ 16 presidential candidate - that was being made .
the text of the t@@ wee@@ ts reads : &apos; i am not always dr@@ un@@ k with the tri@@ ple per@@ mis@@ sible alcohol level ... but if i do , i am we@@ aring a go@@ o@@ d-@@ b@@ red pe@@ ar@@ ry , if i do .
i am the dr@@ un@@ k democr@@ at in tex@@ as .
le@@ h@@ m@@ berg ’ s office was not responsible for the investigation of the grand jury against per@@ ry .
this was done by michael mc@@ cr@@ um , a special public prosecu@@ tor from san ant@@ oni@@ o , who was arrested by a republic@@ an judge .
per@@ ry argu@@ es in favour of not guil@@ ty and called the prosecu@@ tion a political tr@@ ick .
his high-@@ class team of legal coun@@ sel requested a report from the court of justice on the case , which was charged with ref@@ using the charge and argu@@ ing that the law we are dealing with was a criminal off@@ ence against the most senior govern@@ or .
per@@ ry stopped 7@@ ,@@ 5 million $ state money from the public pur@@ se .
this ve@@ to has created a public compla@@ int from a lef@@ t-@@ wing party , wat@@ ch@@ dog , which is a very important issue .
per@@ ry &apos;s official user account is often updated - and sometimes famous .
after having won the po@@ ll@@ ing in i@@ ow@@ a during his presidential election campaign , he was elected as fif@@ th-@@ president in 2012 .
ber@@ ke@@ ley explains housing market policy for &quot; normal &quot; .
one of the most prominent building contrac@@ tors in london , he pointed out that the construction of the housing market in the south-@@ east of england was back to normal levels .
home homes in the capital were hot , but the city was the subject of enormous price increases , which made the bank of england un@@ easy to do due to widespread fear of a credit bu@@ b@@ ble .
ton@@ y pi@@ d@@ g@@ ley , founder and ceo of the university of applied sciences in ber@@ k@@ ele@@ y said on monday : &quot; since the beginning of the current financial year , the market has been back on a normal level of transaction since the highest level since the 1st of 2013 .
the real estate market in london was very strong during the down@@ turn , as foreign bu@@ yers were moving to the capital .
according to the kat@@ aster@@ ic office , prices are in the urban area alone last year jum@@ ped by 18@@ .@@ 5 % .
the average selling prices for ber@@ k@@ ele@@ ys private , price and quality students are around $ 1.@@ 50 per month .
a stronger p@@ ound , however , has made real estate property in london more attractive to foreign bu@@ yers in recent months - some of them have also been affected by the introduction of new property taxes and political rhe@@ tor@@ ic to a possible &quot; villas tax &quot; .
the london real estate agent , fo@@ x@@ ton , war@@ ned in the past week that the price of mort@@ gage bonds was too low for the mort@@ gage market to be more str@@ ingent .
new data from the bank of england on monday show a decline in mort@@ gage l@@ ending in july , which is also indic@@ ative of a decline in the housing market .
h@@ amp@@ tions international , another real estate agency , correc@@ ted its predic@@ tion for the rise in real estate prices in london for 20@@ 15 down@@ wards to 3 % , based on an already weak@@ ening market .
the volume of transactions in the most expensive areas of london , such as ch@@ el@@ sea , may@@ fair and ken@@ sing@@ ton , has grown by more than a quarter each year , according to the bro@@ ker wa el@@ l@@ is .
nevertheless , the desire for a home in the capital for ber@@ ke@@ ley is a bl@@ essing , as the due amounts of money for appoin@@ t@@ ments are limited to more than 2.@@ 2 billion euros .
mr pi@@ d@@ g@@ ley said that &apos; the demand for the right , well-@@ planned and effective product to the best locations has not been stable and has been reduced as a result .
in june , the company reported that it had 3@@ 7@@ 42 new homes , which were built in the year until the end of april - almost a third more than the 2007 peak before the crisis .
the annual pre-@@ tax result rose by 40 % ann@@ ually to eur 2@@ 80 million , the tur@@ nover by 18 % to eur 1.@@ 6 billion .
in a communication on monday before the annual meeting of the company , mr pi@@ d@@ g@@ ley said that the revenue for ber@@ ke@@ ley was expected to reach the current market share this year .
analy@@ sts es@@ timate that the annual growth rate of the pre-@@ tax was 4@@ 50 million .
ber@@ ke@@ ley shares were on the table in the london trade in the afternoon at 2@@ 3.@@ 96 c@@ ents .
nu@@ de photos of j@@ enni@@ fer law@@ rence , by h@@ ack@@ er on the internet published on the internet .
j@@ enni@@ fer law@@ rence appeared at the 8@@ 5th o@@ sc@@ ar rental in london .
nu@@ de photos of the o@@ sc@@ ar prize winner jen@@ ni@@ fer la@@ v@@ ren@@ ce were taken online by a h@@ ack@@ er who claimed to have a &quot; mas@@ tered list &quot; of images of another 100 star@@ lets .
a representative of the star from &quot; the tri@@ bu@@ ts of pan@@ em &quot; confirmed that the show photos of la@@ v@@ ren@@ ce e@@ cht were genuine and accused the h@@ ack@@ er of &quot; flag@@ rant violation of human rights . &quot;
the authorities have been notified and will follow all those who have stopped the sto@@ len photos of j@@ enni@@ fer law@@ rence .
the photos originally taken on the photo sharing site were taken on the 4@@ ch@@ an photo site .
it is not certain how many of the images are genuine , although win@@ ste@@ ad , star from &quot; scot@@ t pil@@ gri@@ m against the rest of the world &quot; on t@@ wit@@ ter also h@@ ack condemned the h@@ ack .
&quot; to those of you who have seen photos , which my hus@@ band and i have taken in the private environment of our house years ago - i hope you are so satisfied with you &quot; , wrote win@@ ste@@ ad on t@@ wit@@ ter .
victori@@ a justice from the ni@@ gh@@ t-@@ lo@@ de@@ on@@ series &quot; i@@ car@@ ly &quot; and &quot; victori@@ a &quot; .
let us not be fo@@ ol@@ ed by the beginning .
bu@@ zz@@ feed reported that the debian project &apos;s new release is scheduled to be released on sunday .
exclusive ex@@ cer@@ pt from ho@@ ward jac@@ ob@@ s@@ ons high@@ ly-@@ p@@ raised new novel about love and the letter of &quot; j &quot; .
they were broken up , so they could best be described , they tri@@ g@@ ge@@ red slowly like a car@@ ton , the one that was left in the rain .
occa@@ sion@@ ally , a woman told him that he was too serious , ex@@ hau@@ sting , intensive , di@@ stan@@ ced , and perhaps somewhat scr@@ at@@ ch-@@ pr@@ one .
and sha@@ ke his hands with the hand .
scr@@ at@@ ch-@@ brus@@ hed he knew .
he was st@@ uck , as in i@@ gel , yes .
the last victim of this st@@ ack@@ ness was a just beginning aff@@ air , which was promising .
a@@ il@@ in@@ n sol@@ om@@ on was a hor@@ ri@@ ble and delicate beauty with un@@ t@@ amed hair and a bot@@ tle of heart from a village on the nor@@ th@@ island , which even more had its own remote and r@@ ough appearance than port report .
it was equipped with an older compan@@ ion to the south , ke@@ ver@@ n for her a@@ un@@ t , and which was a p@@ lot in a we@@ t but par@@ adi@@ si@@ ac@@ al valley with the ap@@ t name parad@@ ise valley .
for several years , no one in the house had lived .
the pi@@ pes were le@@ ak , in the bathrooms were still sp@@ id@@ ers , nu@@ t t@@ ones had their sp@@ ines on all windows .
it was like the house from a children &apos;s fair@@ y tal@@ e , both threat@@ ening and temp@@ ting , a garden full of secre@@ ts .
por@@ tra@@ it of the author : ho@@ ward jac@@ ob@@ son , whose novel &quot; j &quot; is based on the long@@ list for which man boo@@ ker price 20@@ 14 .
the short@@ list is displayed in the next week .
ke@@ ver@@ n had a very good experience with ai@@ lin@@ n in the bro@@ ke song &quot; the be@@ ats &quot; on the high gr@@ ass and had an un@@ usually warm spring afternoon .
your feet are too large .
because of their own aggres@@ sion , songs of this kind were no longer on the con@@ sole .
not prohibited - nothing was really for@@ bi@@ dden - simply not played .
it was successfully ob@@ sole@@ te , as the word ob@@ sol@@ es@@ cent .
the general taste was the result of which i could never have been able to en@@ act and regulate , and how people could have used the vo@@ m tell@@ er z@@ um@@ -@@ mil@@ li@@ on@@ air@@ e mem@@ o@@ irs , cooking books and love books in books .
in the eu@@ ph@@ oria of the day , ke@@ ver@@ n began an imag@@ inary piano to play and to play in a gro@@ b com@@ ic se@@ ren@@ ade a@@ il@@ in@@ n &apos;s great feet .
a@@ il@@ in@@ n did not understand this .
&quot; this was a well-known song by a jazz pi@@ an@@ ist called f@@ ats w@@ all@@ er , &quot; he explained to her and automatically put two fing@@ ers on his li@@ ps .
that was his father &apos;s job at all times to write j .
it had been seen as a game between him and his father when he was still small .
his father had to do it with his own father , so he had told .
if you want to add a word to a j without having two fing@@ ers about your li@@ ps , it costs you a pen@@ ny .
it was not a very fun@@ ny game even then , and it was still not very fun@@ ny to play .
he knew that the problem was not that of him , but that was all .
it had to explain what jazz was .
a@@ il@@ in@@ n has never heard of anyone .
jazz was played by the famous jazz sing@@ er , although not directly banned .
the impro@@ vis@@ ation was no longer modern .
it was only space for a single &quot; if &quot; in life .
people wanted to be able to hear a me@@ lo@@ dy at the beginning of a me@@ lo@@ dy quite sure where it would end .
the mind is also the mind .
his un@@ predic@@ tability made people ner@@ vous .
and jazz was musical , and the music was more than a simple mind .
although he was 10 years old without being taken over by sam@@ my dav@@ is junior , he knew that he was a good friend of jac@@ ques gar@@ cia .
but at least he had to leave a@@ il@@ inn without expla@@ ining that f@@ ats w@@ all@@ er was black .
at that time she was not able to remember a time when she was a pop sing@@ er , but when she was a pop sing@@ er .
again , no laws or constra@@ ints were applied .
con@@ for@@ man@@ ce society meant that every element of this society was grateful to the principle of group gi@@ fts .
people with a@@ fro@@ -@@ caribbean origin were threatened by temper@@ ament and physical construction for under@@ water and sports .
people who were originally from the indian sub@@ continent were not like the indian nature , with electronic talent .
what is still being left of the polish community is not concerned with the can@@ al@@ isation ; what is being done by the gre@@ e@@ ks is being broken up plates .
those from the gulf states and the lev@@ ante , whose grand@@ parents left the country not quickly as what happened , were not able to do so .
each of his abilities .
as they are only b@@ all@@ ads , it fell to a@@ el@@ in to understand that he was the insul@@ t of the words that ke@@ ver@@ n used just now .
music was an expression of love .
&quot; they are not really insul@@ ting , &quot; said ke@@ ver@@ n .
apart from perhaps people whose feet are too large .
my father never heard anyone insul@@ ting , but he loved the game .
he spoke too much , but the negl@@ ected garden gave him the expensive money .
nothing could replace the sound@@ proof@@ ing of the huge coal fi@@ red leaves .
a@@ il@@ in@@ n still did not understand .
why would your father love this ?
he wanted to say that it was a ju@@ x , he hesit@@ ated to be in their presence again two fing@@ ers at the li@@ ps .
she thought anyway , that she was a bit special .
&quot; it seemed to him fun@@ ny , &quot; he said instead .
they sha@@ ke hands with the lord , and be@@ tr@@ ay@@ ed ke@@ common .
there was a worldwide lack of anything else to see than their un@@ ri@@ v@@ alled cr@@ ab@@ s black hair .
there was nothing he could have seen otherwise .
&quot; if you say it , &quot; do you not believe that .
but that does not explain why you did it to me .
it seemed to be genuinely concerned .
are my feet too big ?
he saw again .
your feet are not so direct .
maybe your an@@ k@@ les , a little bit ...
and you say you h@@ ate me , because my serv@@ ants are not too th@@ ick , ?
h@@ ate you ?
of course i h@@ ate you not .
that is just the fo@@ ol@@ ish song .
he could have said &quot; i love you &quot; , but it was still too early for that .
&quot; your th@@ ick an@@ k@@ les are exactly the reason why you are happy with me , &quot; try to find it instead .
i am a bit per@@ verse here .
the sound was not right .
it had a strange feeling .
if he tried to be fun@@ ny , he brought him to the scene often , because he was like his father not to talk about the cal@@ ming charm .
perhaps his father wanted to be cru@@ el .
perhaps he wanted to be ke@@ ver@@ n .
despite his friendly eyes .
a@@ il@@ in@@ n sol@@ om@@ on was red and raised in the air .
the fl@@ our@@ ishing wine , therefore , was a drink no exc@@ use for him .
in their ex@@ ci@@ tement , she seemed to trem@@ ble , as pal@@ m we@@ del in the stor@@ m .
&quot; and your th@@ ick head is exactly the reason why i am per@@ verse to you .
except that i do not even am .
she did not do it , both because of the unnecessary un@@ kin@@ dness of his words and the fear that has been expressed in her eyes when she spoke out against him .
did she think that he would beat them ?
she had not told him of life on the cold northern archi@@ pel@@ ago .
the same huge and ic@@ e-@@ cold ocean , the sea , was bur@@ ned here as there on the shore .
the same confusion ar@@ ose between the two men , with even th@@ ick@@ er skin and more w@@ ound after what had happened than their pre@@ dec@@ ess@@ ors .
th@@ ick head ?
they would have given her a big f@@ ist if she did not fit !
they cr@@ un@@ ch - cr@@ um@@ ble , they were the most common used .
after k@@ ev@@ ins , this was an unnecessary confusion .
a@@ il@@ in@@ n sol@@ om@@ on gave him a feeling of well-being through her body .
he raised the question of the lo@@ dge and the one of old man .
she felt the same way as a lead , but the impact of his gri@@ ef surprised her .
that was not the end of the world .
they knew each other very well .
she saw him as a be@@ tr@@ ay@@ er - as he was from a room on the upper floor her compan@@ ion told him - a man who was compla@@ ining about something that he himself had grown up .
ad@@ am leaves the garden , thought she .
she felt a su@@ dden pain for him and men in general , although some of her hands were raised against them .
a man turned away from her , his back pra@@ yed , and he was ash@@ amed , be@@ aten without a fight spirit - why was that a decent sight , the sight she had to know well , when she was in a hur@@ ry ?
when she was alone , she looked at the world ’ s most beautiful and beautiful feet .
for several years before the recent reports of the death of the child , es@@ me n@@ us@@ s@@ bau@@ m , an intelligent and enthusi@@ astic 3@@ 2-@@ year-@@ old resear@@ cher on behalf of of@@ now , the non-@@ legislative monitoring committee , worked .
&quot; it has been done a lot and much still needs to be done , &quot; she wrote , &quot; to the in@@ n@@ ate aggres@@ si@@ veness of a people , which is a thousand wars and which has destroyed most of them , especially in the remote areas .
but some features are not always enough to be able to be ext@@ ingu@@ ished .
the higher the church tower , the more it seems , the less passion it has for the church .
the population is cr@@ ying out for s@@ enti@@ mental b@@ all@@ ads , rob@@ bing of stories about super@@ natural phenomen@@ a and claim@@ ing to be firmly attached to the virtu@@ es of marriage and family life , but still keeps on being the only one .
&quot; you have an unfortunate tend@@ ency to over@@ ride the fact , &quot; said your ment@@ or , as he said the whole report .
i propose that we should have less nov@@ els .
es@@ me n@@ us@@ s@@ bau@@ m lo@@ wered her head .
i must also ask : are you a@@ the@@ ist ?
&quot; i think that i do not have to say , &quot; answered es@@ me n@@ us@@ s@@ bau@@ m .
are you les@@ bian ?
again , the team of es@@ me called for their right to privacy and refused to say .
fem@@ in@@ ist ?
yet again , silence .
&quot; i don &apos;t ask , &quot; said lu@@ ther r@@ ab@@ in@@ o@@ wit@@ z , &quot; because i am against a@@ the@@ ism , les@@ bian or fem@@ in@@ ism .
this is a pre@@ ju@@ dic@@ ed job .
we are serving a pre@@ jud@@ ice free society .
but certain types of hyper@@ sensi@@ tivity that are not necessarily acceptable and logical in itself are not acceptable .
you yourself have obviously taken pre@@ jud@@ ices against the church , and these things that you call &apos; dis@@ gu@@ ised &apos; and &apos; raw &apos; are not the same as those that you have described as an expression of naturally strength and vit@@ ality .
if you continue on the path , you will see the sign of the event .
es@@ me n@@ us@@ s@@ bau@@ m looked around while r@@ ab@@ in@@ o@@ wit@@ z spoke .
behind his head , a led fon@@ t in fl@@ am@@ ing@@ or@@ os@@ a repeated the advice that o@@ f@@ no@@ w gave to the country in the last quarter of a century or more .
s@@ mil@@ ing your neighb@@ ors , you value your partner , listen to bal@@ la@@ d , visit musicians , play music , play games , play games , play games , play games , play games , etc .
speaking is better than silence , the common sense of words is better than what is written , but nothing is better than love .
&quot; i understand perfectly what you are looking for , &quot; he rep@@ lied , es@@ me n@@ us@@ s@@ bau@@ m , with a calm voice , when she was sure that her superi@@ ors had spoken at the end , &quot; and i say nothing other than that we are effective than that we are doing that .
my concern is that we will not be able to agree on the future of the european union without warning .
this time , however , it is not the others that we have to te@@ ach our an@@ ger and mi@@ str@@ ust .
lu@@ ther r@@ ab@@ in@@ ov@@ it@@ z formed with his hands a py@@ ram@@ id .
in order to avoid an an@@ gel &apos;s pati@@ ence .
&quot; they go too far , &quot; he said , &quot; if they act as &quot; error &quot; , the ones our grand@@ parents may or may not have committed .
they also go too far when they talk about the fact that they have their &quot; an@@ ger &quot; and their &quot; mi@@ str@@ ust &quot; of &quot; other &quot; .
it should not be necessary to tell someone in their position that they are not the only ones who understand the past , as they are protecting the present , but rather the future .
there was no &apos; we &apos; and there was no &apos; other &apos; .
it was a time of dis@@ order , it is all we know .
&quot; from which , if we are honest with ourselves , &quot; he d@@ ared to throw down es@@ me , &quot; no part of society can claim to be good .
i do not compla@@ in to anyone .
whether it is bad or good , what happened is not .
that was then .
there is nothing more to say about this - we agree on that .
and , just as no blame must be assigned , so no blame must be paid .
but what is the past for when we do not learn from it - and we do not learn from it - and what is the future ?
the past serves to make them forget them .
if i may say something on this - and i am not saying anything about it - i am not going to say anything about it - i am not going to say anything about it - i am not going to say anything about it - i am talking about the commission .
lu@@ ther r@@ ab@@ in@@ ov@@ it@@ z left his py@@ ram@@ id .
&quot; i will have to consider your report , &quot; he said and dis@@ missed it .
the next day , when you were ready to work , the first one was taken by a motor@@ cy@@ c@@ list who , as pas@@ ser@@ s-@@ by described , was in a kind of &quot; brut@@ al r@@ age &quot; on foot .

les@@ o@@ th@@ o military member says that no cou@@ p was planned ; prime minister remains in south africa .
officials of the military in les@@ o@@ th@@ o argu@@ ed that a cou@@ p would be a cou@@ p d &apos;@@ é@@ t@@ at , and said that they would fight polic@@ em@@ en who were denied the armed services of political fan@@ a@@ tics .
prime minister thomas th@@ ab@@ ane f@@ led the country and told that he would not be able to take over his residence .
the premier brought his family to the ad@@ jac@@ ent south africa after he was att@@ acked by ass@@ ass@@ inations .
military spo@@ kes@@ man major n@@ t@@ le@@ le n@@ to@@ i said that there is de fac@@ to no cou@@ p .
&quot; what happened this morning was that the staff of defense forces were led by les@@ o@@ th@@ o , after he had discovered several intelligence reports .
south african prime minister mar@@ gare@@ t th@@ at@@ cher has been saying that the military action in the region seems to be a par@@ aly@@ sis .
&quot; even if nobody claimed that the government was att@@ acked by violence , the government is not aware of the fact that the government &apos;s activities are not being supported by les@@ o@@ th@@ o &apos;s defence forces .
spo@@ kes@@ men of the les@@ o@@ th@@ o military told us on sunday that the soldiers had been inter@@ ro@@ g@@ ated into their bar@@ r@@ acks and that the situation in the capital was quiet .
meanwhile , the council vice-president , mr mo@@ th@@ é@@ n , takes over the government of the th@@ ab@@ an@@ es ab@@ sent from the country .
th@@ ab@@ ane told us that he believed that he was not a member of the european union because of his attempt to combat corruption in the country .
in les@@ o@@ th@@ o , there have been great ten@@ sions since june , after th@@ ab@@ ane parliamentary sit@@ t@@ ings were cancelled due to the disputes within his unity government .
he said that his actions had not prevented the government from acting in a different way , which is what he is acc@@ using of .
production in the eurozone at a 13 month low level , with a low interest rate of 13 months , is a major factor in the economy .
the increase in production in the euro area slow@@ ed down in august to the lowest level in the last 13 months , so a precisely observed increase in the number of workers .
the final mark@@ er purchasing management index of the producing business is now available .
a figure of over 50 indicates an expansion .
new orders have been back@@ dated and fac@@ tories have experienced break@@ down@@ s at a time of rising tension between the eu and russia over ukraine .
the figures are very clear before the european central bank ( ecb ) meeting on thursday .
the markets expect the bank to draw up a clear plan for dealing with a slow recovery in the eurozone , as well as for the im@@ pending de@@ fl@@ ation at an inflation rate of only 0.@@ 3 % .
there are spec@@ ulation that the euro ’ s head , mari@@ o drag@@ hi , will be in office this week .
&quot; although a small growth is better than no growth at all , the bra@@ kes on the growing economic and geo@@ political uncertainty are not good for manufacturers .
the factory p@@ mi for germany , the largest trading partner of russia in the eu , fell to the lowest level in 11 months with 5@@ 1.@@ 4 .
meanwhile , the us has seen a decline in the world ’ s second largest economy , france , the p@@ mi , to 4@@ 6.@@ 9 .
france remains a trou@@ b@@ led child , as is italy ’ s des@@ cent from a solid expansion to stag@@ nation .
references to growth initiatives being taken in the key instrument of the lisbon strategy to germany and spain and the netherlands are no longer valid .
the fall in industry is probably causing the fire of analy@@ sts , who are demanding further monetary or fiscal incentives .
a positive news came from the republic of ireland , where the p@@ mi was reduced to 5@@ 7.@@ 3 , the highest level since the end of 1999 .
ho@@ ward ar@@ cher , chief econom@@ ist at the i@@ h@@ s global insi@@ ghts , said : &quot; the best thing we can do for the purchasing manager is to reduce the manufacturing cost of the manufacturing industry in the euro area from august .
he added : &quot; producers in the eurozone find the lives of today apparently quite difficult , as the current increased geo@@ political ten@@ sions - especially in relation to russia and ukraine - are un@@ certain@@ ties in the continuing difficult conditions in many countries .
these increased un@@ certain@@ ties have clearly highlighted the economy and the economy , particularly , and the confidence of consumers , and pre@@ sum@@ ably leads to some orders being dela@@ yed or even cancelled , particularly large orders .
he said that it &apos; becoming more and more likely &apos; that the ecb will eventually become a kind of q@@ e .
the hel@@ l@@ fire of the survi@@ v@@ ors of bes@@ lan : ten years have passed since the terrible sie@@ ge of the school , as the evidence suggests .
ten years ago , more than 1@@ ,000 people were killed by chec@@ hen mil@@ i@@ ti@@ as in a school in bes@@ lan in southern russia as ho@@ stages .
more than 3@@ 30 people , more than half of them children , were killed in the three-@@ day mar@@ ty@@ r@@ dom that the world was sho@@ c@@ ked , killed and w@@ oun@@ ded .
we are certified according to bes@@ lan , to provide some of the victims , who are exposed to death at the ab@@ om@@ ination in the class@@ room .
exactly a decade after the hor@@ ri@@ fic sie@@ ge of the school of bes@@ lan , in which 3@@ 34 people were killed , including 18@@ 6 children , the authorities war@@ ned her@@ o@@ ic survi@@ v@@ ors of last night of a new apo@@ c@@ aly@@ p@@ tic .
as a fan@@ a@@ tical islam@@ ist terrorist , i am very pleased to see children and parents on 1 september 2004 , the beginning of a new school year , taking place and killing .
the tragedy united west and east , in ab@@ hor@@ rent , and the tragedy turned into a surprise .
ten years later , we moved to bes@@ lan , where we were able to see some of the victims who died at the at@@ ro@@ cities in the class@@ room .
we found surprising young people who resi@@ sted resistance , who were not able to re@@ mem@@ br@@ ate this terrorist hel@@ l fore@@ ver .
their greatest hope is that they will be able to do so .
the fact that the war that has now struck ukraine - and in which children like them die - is now ending .
the girl who was trying to sho@@ ot was in the frag@@ r@@ ance of the school sports hall .
it was founded by the russian star photograph@@ er di@@ mit@@ ri beli@@ ak@@ ov .
what is completely conf@@ used is that a@@ id@@ a sought her mother , l@@ ar@@ is@@ sa , now 40 years old .
both were sent@@ enced to death , but they survi@@ ved .
&quot; a woman told me i should be asked for my life , but i could not , &quot; said a@@ id@@ a then .
my leg@@ s were blood floo@@ ded .
i stood up and clim@@ bed back into the ground to find my mother .
a soldi@@ er brought them to safety .
after a number of operations , she considered her@@ self to be completely heal@@ ed , but said yesterday : &quot; three months ago , the pain returned .
i fear that i am going to be operating again .
some p@@ ome@@ gran@@ ate sh@@ ards are still in my k@@ ne@@ e .
its aim is now to provide dental care .
&quot; this tragedy changed my life , but it has made me not bro@@ ke , &quot; says she k@@ amp@@ f@@ us@@ ti@@ g .
&quot; that happened to me , and that is not something that can be changed .
once a year i always go to the sports hall to meet the people to be able to play .
my friends and i try to be not informed on other days .
the pain is too great .
my best friend and future piano teacher , i am very happy to have a look at the video .
we played together as we were small , and dre@@ amed of being a little bit more than a school .
&quot; i don &apos;t want to mar@@ ry until i finish my studies and finish my career .
to think of a family later .
she says that the sie@@ ge is always part of it .
i am glad that many people have been able to remember our hor@@ r@@ ors and that we are so grateful for the help we have received from people in britain and everywhere .
when i take the photo online from me , how i go back to school , i think i can do many people .
the boy who was born by the ball ho@@ ok , in which he thought his mother was dead , was a boy who was not able to get his son to die .
it was his first day of school ( rus@@ sians go to school at 7 years ) and survi@@ ved the three-@@ day sie@@ ge in the poor of his mother tam@@ ara .
as a seven year old , he said : &apos; m@@ ama told me i should not go out , if it is an explo@@ sion &apos; .
after an explo@@ sion he thought she would die .
she said to him : &quot; run . &quot;
full of fear , she could be dead , he f@@ led and looked on the way a we@@ eping inf@@ ant , took it at hand and fle@@ w through a co@@ il of a ball .
his father v@@ la@@ di@@ mir , who had his son out in the arms of the castle , said : &quot; dam@@ ir told me that his mother died .
he said : &apos; i could not save you . &apos;
in reality , tam@@ ara was out there , and the government was be@@ aten with le@@ g in@@ jur@@ ies , in turn assum@@ ing that her son had died .
after their re@@ unification , she said : &apos; i we@@ pt with joy .
i could not believe it .
he ran into and surrounded by the army , and he was a little bit w@@ ary of me .
dam@@ ir was later moved to london ( from the now un@@ resolved line of news of the world ) , to be taken over by the then premier ton@@ y bla@@ ir and his wife ch@@ eri@@ e .
&quot; this hor@@ ror is following you every day , but i wish i could be with the re@@ member@@ ing , &quot; he said yesterday .
but i can say that there is no such thing in my memory .
i still know that i will be able to see all my to@@ y gun immediately afterwards .
but now i can play computer games with sho@@ oting scenes and that is for me no problem .
&quot; i am not afraid to go into the sports hall , but i am thinking not about me , even after .
i remember the debate on these children , with whom i was playing in the cour@@ ty@@ ard , and who did not manage to go out .
we never say that they have been killed or killed .
we say that they are not able to stay in the sports hall .
i remember very well the work i had to do in london , especially the to@@ y store , where i looked at everything .
but now he is afraid of place like ukraine , where wars are the kind of disaster that has caused him and his friends .
this hor@@ ror is following you every day , but i wish i could stop .
&quot; i am so sorry to see all those who are among the ab@@ om@@ inations , &quot; said dam@@ ir , the past week as a volunte@@ er in a monaster@@ y .
i would like to help .
i will one day go to the police and i hope that you will bring me to the training academy next year .
his mother tam@@ ara , 48 , said : &quot; 37 children from our neighbor@@ hood were killed .
i remember the time of the terrible silence after the sie@@ ge , there were simply no children , who were calling and be@@ ating .
it is a very lively remin@@ der of her trip to london with dam@@ ir .
the people of london were cr@@ ying when i learned our story .
i understood then how people were looking at the other side of the world .
she was ch@@ eri@@ e bla@@ ir and her foundation grateful for the prize and the opportunity to return to london in autumn 2004 .
i wish i could ch@@ eri@@ e call and her just go to the door to say that 10 years have passed , but i still remember the meeting i had with her and her hus@@ band in london , and how the dam@@ ir and me helped .
i remember the time when the commission was happy to play bor@@ sch@@ ts@@ ch and you all had to eat all the local russian restaurants .
i remember that the president of k@@ ell@@ er was in a restaurant , and i was sho@@ c@@ ked by his water gun on them and they were running away and playing with him .
and that was just a month after the hor@@ ror .
i was surprised that the british were so willing to accept our pain .
she said : &apos; i always think that this world is in these 10 years not better .
in ukraine , the war is now continuing , and every day people die , and i believe that many children have been killed and still have been killed .
these are exactly the children we have .
i think that for many the war is part of the news that they hear , when they have bo@@ red .
i simply know what these people feel , the whole hor@@ ror .
and i cannot stop saying that .
nothing has changed , people want to be able to trust each other and the situation is so sad that they have to face up to the same fate .
dam@@ ir became great and is very gent@@ le and quiet .
he is not looking for reven@@ ge , for example , he is not overwhel@@ med by the past ab@@ om@@ inations .
i know that he is not keen to remember , but he has six close friends from the class and they go on occa@@ sion@@ ally to the sports hall and infl@@ am@@ mation there c@@ and@@ les .
when he was smaller , he suffered - i remember the first time he was in the house - and i was not able to see the face .
not sle@@ eping , his eyes were open .
i remember also the fact that he all his weapons and other weapons were used to protect the children of the world .
i can hardly believe that i have been so safe for a few hours that he was dead and i never heard him again .
when i asked about the explo@@ sion and asked for the leg@@ s , i saw myself around , and saw the ca@@ ve around me .
i was absolutely sure that my young boy was in this hel@@ l impossible to survive .
&quot; i remember that the first time i had asked him , &quot; dam@@ ir , run , run away &quot; , but i was also so sure that he would not hear me .
but he has heard it and he has gone away .
and so life goes , unlike the life of many others , for us .
geor@@ gi@@ j il@@ y@@ in , 17 years old , 17 years old , born in the netherlands .
the boy whose terrible image was created after the sie@@ ge as a symbol of the ab@@ om@@ inations of bes@@ lan , was a man of des@@ ol@@ ation .
con@@ sol@@ ation : the bes@@ lan survi@@ v@@ or geor@@ gi@@ j ly@@ in , with his mother fa@@ tim@@ a after the sie@@ ge in 2004 , a picture of geor@@ gi@@ j on the right today on georgia .
his bloo@@ d@@ sh@@ ed face was characterized by fear , when he asked for his life .
his image was one of the most sho@@ cking symb@@ ols of the bar@@ bar@@ ity of bes@@ lan .
his mother fa@@ tim@@ a , 54 , a doctor , had to leave him for his first day of school before she was out of ha@@ ste to leave her el@@ der son v@@ la@@ di@@ mir to the university .
&quot; i left the farm about two minutes before the terrorists had to cr@@ um@@ ble him , and so he remained my little boy there for three terrible days alone , &quot; rec@@ alls her .
not quite alone , there was a whole family of rela@@ tives of us , but they were all killed .
only my geor@@ gi@@ j managed to get survi@@ ved .
the closer this date comes , the more difficult it is to remember that and how the european union is to speak about it .
there is not a single day on which we cannot ab@@ ide by this tragedy .
we do not think that it is a long time ago , i think it would have happened yesterday , to see some scenes from these days , at least , follow me .
no one will ever forget that , i promise you .
i urge that the image of geor@@ gi@@ j ( left ) was one of the most sho@@ cking of the attack and was seen as a stat@@ ue ( right ) .
i remember that the geor@@ gi@@ j was not able to attend the school on that day , but he said he wanted to let his teacher down .
i knew only when the council had been alive that he had been in the television .
and now there are even this stat@@ ue of the we@@ eping geor@@ gi@@ j in san mar@@ ino .
geor@@ gi@@ j sees the image not like , and it is with us at home in the book@@ shel@@ f .
i understand that , but i also think that people in all the world should be able to express our pain thanks to this image .
geor@@ gi@@ j says today : &apos; it is important to do something like this never again .
&quot; i doubt that the best way to do this is to know the truth .
people are investig@@ ating such trag@@ e@@ dies and never experience the truth .
and now they are investig@@ ating the cr@@ ash of these bo@@ eing in ukraine .
will we ever know what he is causing ?
this world will become something terrible .
&quot; i cannot understand how the system is possible , because if you want to ask people , nobody wants a war , so how is it done ?
ten years is nothing at all about such pain .
we need do@@ z@@ ens of years to make it a little forgotten .
it has taken my health away and i feel it still .
about three or four years i had a couple of night@@ ma@@ res about the sie@@ ge , but then it became better .
i went to the european parliament in 2004 and had a daily fear .
i thought of my friends and class mates , but the ge@@ st@@ ures were killed .
i am therefore always involved in the sports hall when the 1st of september approaches .
i will not repeat my old child@@ hood friends .
it is difficult for me to go to the sports hall , but i must say it .
i feel not as a victim of this story , this is now part of my past .
i will not forget it , but i am sorry that i do not .
my life goes on .
i have the school completed this year and i visit a medical college in v@@ la@@ di@@ ka@@ w@@ ka@@ z .
i will be a heart sur@@ ge@@ on .
my first choice was a training in the army .
i wanted to become a soldi@@ er , but my health did not let that happen .
i wanted to fight for my country , but that will not happen .
geor@@ gi@@ j fan@@ i@@ ye@@ v , 20 years old , 20 years old , 20 years old , 20 years old , 20 years old , 20 years old , 20 years old , 20 years old , 20 years old , 20 years old , ...
the boy who survi@@ ved , although he was at the foot of a mur@@ der@@ ous terrorist , was not able to find a way to stop the bom@@ bing .
a mir@@ acle : geor@@ gi@@ j fan@@ i@@ je@@ v was a member of the army during the sie@@ ge .
during the sie@@ ge , he was in the sports hall and s@@ acked beside the bom@@ b , the fire was at the foot of a mur@@ der@@ ous terrorist .
it is a mir@@ acle that he is not killed .
&quot; we feel it is as if it were yesterday , &quot; says geor@@ gi@@ j , who was a secret service officer for the f@@ s@@ b , but this is because of his health damage due to the sie@@ ge .
it is still with me , it is nothing that i can hide behind me .
i am now older and the people say that children are easily conf@@ used with bad experiences - i have to say that is not true .
&quot; in 2006 i worked with psycho@@ logi@@ sts and felt really a bit better after that , but i can not forget it .
and i would like to forget .
2005 - in the year after - was the first and only time that i was back in the sports hall .
i lost the awareness .
i will never go back there and ask you what you think of the situation .
survi@@ v@@ ors : geor@@ gi@@ j fan@@ i@@ ye@@ v today , with a photo of himself in the hospital after the sie@@ ge on the lap@@ top .
my pain is immen@@ se and i am we@@ aring it every day with me .
my friends know that i do not like to think about it or talk about it , and they never asked me about school .
the physical and mental aspect of my work is good .
i should be careful with my in@@ ju@@ red k@@ ne@@ e , but i can now run well .
but because of my health i could not participate in the secret service academy of the f@@ s@@ b in saint pe@@ ter@@ sburg , as i wanted .
i have read my documents , including the medical ones , and you have rep@@ lied that it is not possible .
my second passion was the animals , so i went to the ve@@ t institute .
i have already spent two years there .
he lear@@ ns to treat all animals &quot; from c@@ ats to co@@ ws &quot; .
he said : &apos; i knew that the european parliament would never be able to tell my children about my experiences .
this is something that children should not know about , and they should not , of course , suffer .
his mother marina , 42 , said : &quot; this pain leaves me never .
he is in my soul , worse if the anniversary of the fall of the earth .
i will return to the celebra@@ tions to comm@@ em@@ or@@ ate .
i know that georgia has not been allowed to go .
it must be given much more force .
i wa@@ ited home to him and could not help .
i am so grateful to god that he gave me back , and here in bes@@ lan all of them are drawn .
it remains for us .
geor@@ gi@@ j is now an adult , but this hor@@ ror is still a reality in him .
it is difficult to accept that if a little is so unfair .
it is a young man who li@@ kes sport , but he can not be able to participate because of his k@@ ne@@ e .
he has been operating on several occasions , he can run but not drive a sport .
i would say that he has been the hor@@ ror of 50 % .
this terrible experience will always be with us .
many friends and neighbours were arrested when the sie@@ ge was taking place , and this only rein@@ forces my pain .
i have lost many people i have been well aware of and who are expensive to me .
my son is in my room , and that is the greatest gift that god can make me , but my heart cr@@ um@@ bs around the killed .
i know of families where new children are born , but also of wi@@ do@@ ws who are not always born .
it is difficult to accept that life should continue , even if you do not want it .
i will never forget how my heart is sp@@ run@@ g in me when i saw him in the hospital .
and now i see what is happening in the world - wars in other regions .
what are these people fighting for ?
why do you kill each other ?
the war has now been very close to our country and i almost cannot believe it .
we used to be a friendly country , how can it be that we are fighting now ?
people and children suffer , i am sure that in ukraine already many children have been killed .
if we only want to support all these re@@ be@@ ls and throw them out - as far as possible .

4 tips for better under@@ water photos and videos .
if you would like to see photos or videos under water , there is a selection of devices .
the che@@ apest option is a water@@ proof po@@ ol@@ -@@ and-@@ bur@@ n .
i have taken these photos at a family party with several cameras , all of which are available at a price of less than $ 3@@ 50 .
regardless of the equipment , there are some rules for the best results .
check your equipment twice .
even if you are a water@@ proof camera , make sure that the camera is not in the same position as the other com@@ part@@ ments .
put your camera on the photos or videos .
some cameras and cam@@ c@@ order have scene and sound rec@@ ord@@ ings , but with this the camera can be adjusted to the sho@@ ck .
and before they jum@@ p in , check that the whole world is in the dep@@ ths of your equipment .
some cameras are only available for up to 5 feet , others up to 50 or 60 feet .
search our shopping guide and the reviews for digital cameras for her@@ bal medicines .
make multiple rec@@ ord@@ ings - because many do not fall .
point char@@ t - the world &apos;s largest online casino , the best online casino and the best online casino .
even if you are an l@@ cd , it is difficult to do this under water , and the right setting is a lu@@ cky one .
so make many sho@@ ts .
if your camera is connected to the camera in order to capture a number of sho@@ ts with slightly changed exposure settings , you can use the camera .
stay close to the surface .
the light is getting worse , the further you move away from the surface .
if possible , they will remain close to the surface if they are able to take pictures in a pool , a lake or the sea .
this allows you to add more color to your photos ; the de@@ eper you go , the less color you will see .
go close to the objects and then go to the objects .
this is also a good advice on land , but it is all the more important under water because of poor light conditions .
it is particularly important that you are familiar with an action c@@ am .
andre@@ w law@@ son was a man of the sor@@ t. his character was changed , even in a world as gi@@ gan@@ tic as the n@@ h@@ s .
as a consulting an@@ aes@@ the@@ ti@@ st , he devoted his career to the task of helping the si@@ ck to both ag@@ ony of the disease and the pain of treatment .
among his patients , the doctor re@@ members , was a mi@@ 6 employee who had to deal with the dev@@ ast@@ ating effects of torture .
law@@ son knew that he was the physi@@ ci@@ an of the diagno@@ ses and diseases that were most important , while the treated were mostly treated with something quite different : pain .
one day in 2007 he was the one who was the pas@@ sion@@ ate way of doing so .
&quot; i have not felt myself to be &quot; wrote him in may this year .
i had difficulty getting up and up .
while he was dealing with fl@@ u symp@@ t@@ oms , he noticed that the symp@@ t@@ oms of the disease were not as pleasant as his wife ju@@ li@@ et .
&quot; i want to do everything immediately rather than later , &quot; he noted .
when ju@@ li@@ et was on a business trip for a week , he felt like a man .
something is wrong with the fact that the commission has not yet done anything .
he asked a colleague to send an x-@@ ray inspection of his ch@@ est .
only two weeks ago , he was in the french alps for skiing .
the result of the x-@@ ray inspection was before .
he suffered from mes@@ o@@ the@@ li@@ om , a sin@@ ister cancer , which had the bre@@ ast co@@ at , the skin of the lun@@ gs , and which was then att@@ acked .
as with most cancer cases , the risk of the disease is not always very clear .
while some smo@@ kers , for example , suffer from l@@ ung cancer , not all l@@ ung cancer is diagno@@ sed .
but mes@@ o@@ the@@ li@@ om is different .
in almost all cases , the shut@@ ter release is a exposure to as@@ be@@ sto@@ s - contact with the fi@@ bre material that was once called a &quot; mir@@ acle &quot; but has now been recognized as fat@@ al .
for most of us , mes@@ o@@ the@@ li@@ om is a disease that can be ignored like easily .
as@@ be@@ sto@@ s is , after all , a product of the past .
the most dangerous as@@ be@@ sto@@ s type has been used in britain since the 196@@ 0s , when the industry fre@@ el@@ ess@@ ly committed to using it not more .
even where he still used it , he only worked in certain industries .
as an industrial risk material from a different time , it seems to be hardly more worrying today .
but this com@@ plac@@ ency is mis@@ placed .
britain , it seems , is now experiencing the cul@@ min@@ ation of a mes@@ ol@@ the@@ li@@ um ep@@ ide@@ mic .
there are more deaths from mes@@ o@@ the@@ li@@ om here than in any other country in the world .
with a total of 2,@@ 500 deaths per year , twice as many people die of this disease as in road accidents .
annual figures of the mes@@ o@@ the@@ li@@ um deaths since 1980 and expected effects of the disease in britain are expected to be more than 50 % in the future .
the reason we are not able to control the dead@@ ly effects now , although as@@ be@@ sto@@ s has been illegal for years ( 1999 , all types of as@@ be@@ sto@@ s were banned ) is that a measuring o@@ xide only develops after decades .
and the s@@ cour@@ ge of the mes@@ o@@ the@@ li@@ om is not con@@ fined to former construction workers .
as@@ be@@ sto@@ s was , and is often still , present in the houses we live in , the offices where we work , the schools , in which we learn and the shops we live in .
and so mes@@ o@@ the@@ li@@ om does not know class limits , financial limits , profes@@ sions or age .
the privileged ba@@ š@@ ti@@ ans , which are elegant department stores in london and private schools , are not a sanc@@ tu@@ ary .
the parliament buildings are contam@@ inated with as@@ be@@ sto@@ s .
in hospit@@ als , too , where we are healthy , we have to be seen as starting points .
andre@@ w law@@ son was not old .
he was not a pl@@ um@@ ber either .
it was not possible for him to be prepared to imagine where he might be able to deal with as@@ be@@ sto@@ s .
then he found out .
&quot; it looks like the world is becoming more and more crow@@ ded in the tun@@ nels at gu@@ y &apos;s hospital , where i spent six years in my training .
all students , nur@@ ses , doctors , and nur@@ ses are welcome to use the tunnel to get to the city .
one won@@ ders how many of my fellow members of the same family will suffer from the same disease ?
this question was unfortunately at least partly answered .
&quot; of the four doctors who are working at the gu@@ y &apos;s hospital , the first of these is the patient &apos;s health .
as many of us will become ill ?
andre@@ w law@@ son was born in new york city , new york , where he was 48 years old .
when he was elected president of the european parliament on 17 february of this year , he was 55 .
this was an un@@ usually long period of survival .
fif@@ ty per cent of all mes@@ o@@ the@@ li@@ o@@ the@@ li@@ o@@ the@@ li@@ o@@ the@@ li@@ um diseases die within 8 months of diagno@@ sis .
the disease always ends up le@@ th@@ al .
we can therefore only call law@@ son &apos;s question : &apos; how many of us will be still ill ? &apos;
the leading expert in britain on mes@@ o@@ the@@ li@@ om , professor ju@@ li@@ an pe@@ to , is taking on the as@@ sumption that between 18@@ 70 and 20@@ 50 , when as@@ be@@ sto@@ s ep@@ ide@@ mic is expected to er@@ ase in britain in total , there will be 9@@ 0,000 victims .
most of them are not yet ready to be used .

a quick look at the files of the courts , to which the people concerned often refer for claims for compensation , shows how far the intellectual property s@@ cour@@ ge of the mes@@ o@@ the@@ li@@ um is already spre@@ ading .
in june of this year marks &amp; sp@@ enc@@ er , for example , ad@@ mitted that jan@@ ice had taken all neglig@@ ent as@@ be@@ sto@@ s off .
she worked for nine years for the chain , from 197@@ 8 to 198@@ 7 , and was responsible for the gar@@ ments department at two locations - one of them the flag@@ ship store in the o@@ x@@ ford street .
m@@ r@@ s. all was only 18 years when they started their activities at m &amp; s .
now it has two children in the 19@@ 20@@ s .
&quot; this is the thing she says , &quot; had i never heard of mes@@ o@@ the@@ li@@ om , i knew that it was not really a matter of as@@ be@@ sto@@ s .
i never thought that i would have been concerned .
there are few people who are very concerned about as@@ be@@ sto@@ s .
the fact is that the term as@@ be@@ sto@@ s does not have a substance but a group of six min@@ er@@ als .
the name deri@@ ves from the word &quot; as@@ be@@ sto@@ s &quot; , a description of the fi@@ bre structure that makes the fab@@ ric resistant and flexible .
three of the six were sold in the construction industry .
ch@@ ry@@ so@@ til , also known as a white as@@ be@@ sto@@ s , is now by far the most commonly found in as@@ be@@ sto@@ s in buildings .
it was designed for roof panels , floor tiles , ro@@ h@@ ri@@ -@@ insul@@ ations , bo@@ il@@ ers , even for bra@@ ke lin@@ ings in cars .
it is less le@@ th@@ al than other forms of as@@ be@@ sto@@ s , but it is still considered by the eu and the who as &apos; major health risk &apos; with possible deaths .
more dangerous , however , is the brown as@@ be@@ sto@@ s ( am@@ os@@ ite ) and the blue as@@ be@@ sto@@ s ( k@@ ro@@ ky@@ do@@ lit@@ h ) .
britain was once the world ’ s largest im@@ porter of brown as@@ be@@ sto@@ s , and experts susp@@ ect that &quot; there are clear but indirect indic@@ ations that the matter is a major cause of the uni@@ qu@@ ely high levels of mes@@ o@@ the@@ li@@ om@@ ia .
an employee of marks &amp; sp@@ enc@@ er was born in the flag@@ ship store in o@@ x@@ ford street , london , as@@ be@@ sto@@ s al@@ am@@ y .
jan@@ ice allen has perhaps not been a typical mes@@ o@@ the@@ li@@ om@@ op@@ fer .
he has carried out a study by those concerned , which shows that &apos; a significant proportion of the mes@@ o@@ the@@ li@@ omas are present without known suspension by work or in the house pre@@ sum@@ ably through as@@ be@@ sto@@ s contact in the environment &apos; .
much of these contacts are based on the &quot; normal use and aging of energy &quot; of our buildings .
it looks as if the european union is not sure that the money will be spent .
a report by go@@ d@@ d@@ ard consulting , which has given the palace of west@@ min@@ ster a look at how the people of the heart of the government , un@@ kno@@ w@@ ingly , are exposed to the substance .
in 2009 , go@@ d@@ d@@ ard reported that the service sha@@ fts and pi@@ pes were behind the committee rooms of parliament with as@@ be@@ sto@@ s contam@@ inated , whose fat@@ al facts were destroyed by something as harm@@ less .
members of parliament are often accused of trying to get their own interests into the hands of , but here it seems that the european union is doing the opposite .
while the management of the parliamentary labour service insi@@ sted that the west@@ min@@ ster palace be a &quot; clean health witness &quot; , the council was not allowed to take a decision on this .
the go@@ d@@ d@@ ard report also pointed out that the &apos; european union &apos;s existence is not a guarantee of safety in accordance with the relevant provisions . &apos;
no one can know whether this mis@@ management will cost lives .
everything you can do now is to wait .
a person who has contact with as@@ be@@ sto@@ s could never exactly determine gra@@ ham ab@@ bot@@ t , a general practi@@ tion@@ er .
as andre@@ w law@@ son susp@@ ects , the 50@@ -@@ year-@@ old ab@@ bot@@ t will be able to work in hospit@@ als to stop as@@ be@@ sto@@ s .
&quot; i have been in a hospital where i have been able to receive complaints about as@@ be@@ sto@@ s , &quot; he says , &quot; but i can &apos;t prove it in my case .
it is so difficult to remember all places where the world was once working .
what he still has to remember is the day at the beginning of december 2009 when he was a kind of fe@@ ver .
he was 45 , and led just late evening an operation .
suddenly i had a sha@@ ken fro@@ st .
it suddenly came .
i felt terrible , however .
i thought the trip to home was not more to create .
as a doctor , ab@@ bot@@ t knew that the pain was caused by the ch@@ est co@@ at , the skin around his lun@@ gs .
but , as jan@@ ice all@@ es had no reason to be a mes@@ o@@ the@@ li@@ om .
he went one month not to work .
i was surprised by doctors who made x-@@ ra@@ ys of their bre@@ ast and put ple@@ ur@@ a@@ ka@@ the@@ ther on to produce liquid from the lun@@ gs .
his complaints , however , remained un@@ diagno@@ sed .
his health improved slowly , and he returned to his father &apos;s job .
from time to time , the symp@@ t@@ oms returned , often after sports activity .
in 2011 , a patient ab@@ bot@@ t with similar symp@@ t@@ oms came to his practice and was later treated with mes@@ o@@ the@@ li@@ om .
but now , ab@@ bot@@ t again did not con@@ form to his own case .
after all , his patient was several decades older and had directly contact as@@ be@@ sto@@ s .
the connection in this case was clear .
in september 2011 , ab@@ bot@@ t ’ s condition deterior@@ ated again , and his doctor brought his c@@ t sc@@ ans and x-@@ ray rec@@ ord@@ ings to a group of experts .
in december 2011 , exactly two years after ab@@ bot@@ t committed to the first time to being si@@ ck , the first time that he had had had had been sent to the ca@@ ve of the ri@@ b and ch@@ est co@@ at .
i am an optim@@ ist .
i usually do simple things , &quot; says he .
frank@@ ly , i had not really expected so many .
but rac@@ hel , my wife , was wor@@ ried .
the result of the bi@@ op@@ sy was between christmas and new year .
gra@@ ham ab@@ bot@@ t : diagno@@ sis of mes@@ o@@ the@@ li@@ om
suddenly , ab@@ bot@@ t had to set dates with mac@@ mill@@ an nur@@ ses , from whom a woman received him , and had a job .
only now did he see the extent of the ep@@ ide@@ mic .
&quot; it turned out that as@@ be@@ sto@@ s is very widespread , especially in large public buildings , where red and white pi@@ pes often are isolated with as@@ be@@ sto@@ s .
the people who are exposed to as@@ be@@ sto@@ s in these buildings are now si@@ ck .
and so mes@@ o@@ the@@ li@@ om hit younger people who are not in the typical profes@@ sions .
the most dangerous pi@@ pes with as@@ be@@ sto@@ s insul@@ ation in hospit@@ als were located under the ground , so patients probably were not exposed to the substance .
but many employees who work in pede@@ strian tun@@ nels from one building to another are not aware of the fact that they are not working in the underground areas .
it is clear that , over several decades after the war , hospit@@ als have been providing patients with life@@ -@@ saving , but life@@ -@@ threat@@ ening care .
it is still being removed today .
students put their bun@@ sen@@ bren@@ ner on as@@ be@@ sto@@ s mat@@ s .
and it does not only concern hospit@@ als .
as@@ be@@ sto@@ s was born in the united states on the basis of its fab@@ ulous insul@@ ating and fl@@ am@@ e-@@ re@@ tar@@ dant properties .
schools too .
indeed , many people may have seen the first as@@ be@@ sto@@ s contact in the class@@ room .
everywhere in the country , in thousands of chemical lessons , students have their bun@@ sen@@ bren@@ ner bur@@ ners on as@@ be@@ sto@@ s mat@@ s .
on websites , the subject of as@@ be@@ sto@@ s is frequently mentioned in schools .
and meanwhile , so inno@@ cent objects have lost their lives in our houses , such as floor tiles or sc@@ al@@ p shel@@ ters .
&quot; it is an industrial po@@ ison that is used in large parts of our properties , &quot; and@@ andre@@ w mor@@ gan , the law@@ yer , says that andre@@ w law@@ yer .
in one case , the only contact that could be made to a woman affected was the demo@@ lition of a sh@@ ed in the 197@@ 0s .
so be careful how you can make your garden sh@@ ed out .
the effects of the diagno@@ sis , as we know that the disease is incur@@ able , are immen@@ se .
&quot; it takes a while to hide the data , &quot; says gra@@ ham ab@@ bot@@ t .
i went back to work and tried to continue .
i was in the practice for two weeks .
then i knew that i was going and going to be around myself .
well , i will not be another christmas party .
with the greatest difficulty , the prospects for the change from a doctor to a doctor in a patient &apos;s position were very difficult .
how many patients before him remin@@ ds him that the excess of the body is overwhel@@ ming .
&quot; it was very difficult to take up all of this , &quot; he says .
&quot; i asked my doctor &quot; how long did i have ? &quot;
and they gave me about 12 months .
i remember that the first time i thought i had been there , &quot; well , i don &apos;t want to see any more christmas .
that &apos;s it then . &quot;
mes@@ o@@ the@@ li@@ om is particularly insi@@ di@@ ous because it is our life@@ -@@ saving mechanism - bre@@ a@@ thing itself - that is , the le@@ th@@ al cancer .
most cases of mes@@ o@@ the@@ li@@ om are caused by as@@ be@@ sto@@ s contact .
as@@ be@@ sto@@ s is made up of small@@ est fi@@ b@@ res .
if the as@@ be@@ sto@@ s is checked and the fi@@ b@@ res are in@@ hal@@ ed , you can feel comfortable in the ch@@ est co@@ at , the skin around the lun@@ gs .
as@@ be@@ sto@@ s fi@@ b@@ res ir@@ rit@@ ate the ch@@ est co@@ at and can cause cell mu@@ tations .
&quot; the problem ar@@ ises with the in@@ hal@@ ed nee@@ d@@ le-@@ shaped as@@ be@@ sto@@ s fi@@ b@@ res , &quot; according to professor tom treas@@ ure , a heart thre@@ ad fi@@ ber , who was born in 2001 to the gu@@ y &apos;s hospital .
the hospital , which i know andre@@ w law@@ son susp@@ ects , is a hospital in as@@ be@@ sto@@ s , which is now ir@@ onic .
treas@@ ure can@@ a@@ dian knew that he was dealing with some other , the pre@@ sum@@ ably also during her training in the hospital , as@@ be@@ sto@@ s .
once the as@@ be@@ sto@@ s nee@@ d@@ les have reached l@@ ung tissu@@ e , treas@@ ure says , &quot; they will be taken away from the resp@@ ir@@ atory process , where the skin is .
by nature , it is always in@@ dispens@@ able to the future .
the usual options for other can@@ c@@ ers work in mes@@ o@@ the@@ li@@ om not as well .
the effectiveness of an operation is , for example , highly controversial .
some say that they have tried to do so .
treas@@ ure ver@@ n@@ ingen the thing .
&quot; you can use the ch@@ est co@@ at without having to cut it out , &quot; he says .
they come with the k@@ ni@@ fe not around .
meanwhile , the cancer spe@@ aks &quot; on chem@@ other@@ ap@@ y not very good , &quot; the &quot; effect &quot; shows , but not he@@ als .
&quot; sometimes there are long-term survi@@ v@@ ors , &quot; says tre@@ as@@ ure .
but in the end they all die .
fortunately , some patients actually live long , much longer than expected .
the author ste@@ ph@@ en j@@ ay g@@ ould died 20 years after the diagno@@ sis .
two and a half years after his own diagno@@ sis , gra@@ ham ab@@ bot@@ t is still fighting .
after being a mes@@ o@@ the@@ li@@ om , he came to the contact with andre@@ w la@@ v@@ son , who had been in charge of the treatment four years after his diagno@@ sis .
&quot; hel@@ lo , cancer headquarters , &quot; he won@@ dered about the way to go on call .
&quot; he was very positive , &quot; says ab@@ bot@@ t .
he had his diagno@@ sis 4 years earlier and was still very active .
originally , ab@@ bot@@ t had six chem@@ other@@ ap@@ y cy@@ cles .
&quot; i was desper@@ ate , &quot; he says .
i wanted to give up .
law@@ son was able to &quot; re@@ me@@ dy things in a more positive way &quot; .
after consulting several doctors , the doctor decided to take the treatment .
&quot; we had an advantage by being not able to be forwar@@ ded , i called simply to and ordered the item to be delivered &quot; gives gra@@ ham .
a normal patient would have a bank transfer , and on the authori@@ zation of treatment would have to wait .
money is crucial for the mes@@ o@@ the@@ li@@ om suff@@ e@@ rers to find the best available therap@@ ies .
but if these treatments are inevitably to be ab@@ sent , we will face many affected by a different financial concern - about the future of families , the future of their families .
and so you contact the courts in the hope of compensation .
andre@@ w law@@ son cont@@ acted andre@@ w mor@@ gan of fi@@ el@@ d@@ field fish@@ er wag@@ ner about the new project .
&quot; it has been known since 18@@ 98 that as@@ be@@ sto@@ s is extremely dangerous for health , &quot; says mor@@ gan .
but what has happened in the 19@@ 60 ’ s is that it was recognized that the same was also a very low burden on health .
and here began the neglig@@ ence of companies to play a role .
andre@@ w law@@ son and gu@@ y &apos;s ho@@ sp@@ ital put their case to the court , but it was not what he was doing to create a &quot; full compensation &quot; .
after the investigation to his death , a spo@@ kes@@ man of the gu@@ y &apos;s confirmed that &quot; the as@@ be@@ sto@@ s fi@@ b@@ res in the cel@@ lar concerned were not allowed to be removed in the 199@@ 0s . &quot;
this was a very important point for andre@@ w law@@ son .
as as@@ be@@ sto@@ s can be removed , the way in which as@@ be@@ sto@@ s can be removed is also clear .
indeed , it is difficult for mes@@ o@@ the@@ li@@ om suff@@ e@@ rers to seek compensation because they have a huge problem , the dead@@ ly as@@ be@@ sto@@ s contact of a company or a job - usually decades after the previous inci@@ dents .
many of their previous employers have been sold or closed .
insurance documents can be lost .
and those who oppose claims are not the ones who are the ones who will be able to do so , but certainly not the ones who are .
in response , there was a clear new legislative initiative this year , which would allow mes@@ o@@ the@@ li@@ om stakeholders to make their own compensation .
the law has created a legal framework for the protection of the insurance industry of £ 3@@ 50 million for all who have been made diagno@@ sed after july 2012 , and who have been able to prove contact , but cannot bring a compla@@ int to anyone .
in these cases , the pla@@ in@@ ti@@ ffs receive 80 % of what a court can do in a normal process of compensation to them - about 1@@ 20@@ ,000 c@@ ents .
about 300 successful applications from the program are submitted each year .
andre@@ w mor@@ gan thin@@ ks like so many mes@@ o@@ the@@ li@@ om@@ -@@ affected that 3@@ 50 million £ is a &quot; very good job &quot; of the insurance industry .
&quot; this is a deal of insu@@ rers for insu@@ rers , &quot; he says , and suggests to be the first to be a &quot; deal &quot; .
mi@@ ke pen@@ ning , dam@@ alist working and working life advis@@ er , also gave the go@@ -@@ ahead to the law .
but both pen@@ n@@ y-@@ mor@@ gan ad@@ mitted that , with seven deaths and a total of around 500 people dying every day , rapid action is needed .
&quot; people suffer so much and need help today , &quot; said pen@@ ning during the second hearing of the mes@@ o@@ the@@ li@@ om law in december last year .
at that time , gra@@ ham ab@@ bot@@ t had been in the hands of prof@@ . lo@@ ic lan@@ g-@@ la@@ z@@ dun@@ ski for 19 months .
after your first consul@@ tations , lan@@ g@@ -@@ la@@ z@@ dun@@ ski recommended an operation that he had not been able to prevent , unlike tom treas@@ ure .
this was done by a radiation therapy and a chem@@ other@@ ap@@ y - a three-@@ fold treatment .
ab@@ bot@@ t felt stronger .
&quot; this is of course with the most important , &quot; ab@@ bot@@ t says .
this is something that we see again and again in patients .
there is something that is going to make you go on .
if you give up , it goes very fast .
gra@@ ham ab@@ bot@@ t under@@ went a major renov@@ ation in march 2012 .
at the end of august , he had the last of the six chem@@ other@@ ap@@ y cy@@ cles behind him .
the scan@@ ning of after@@ -@@ care products did not indicate any signs of the disease .
then i had the opportunity to make a s@@ can in march 20@@ 14 .
there were several cancer fle@@ ets around my bre@@ ast .
i was just 50 years old and i was just 50 years old .
that is not life@@ -@@ threat@@ ening .
this is life@@ -@@ ending .
again , ab@@ bot@@ t under@@ took six chem@@ other@@ ap@@ y cy@@ cles .
now , there is no tr@@ ace of t@@ um@@ or any@@ more visible .
but the process is physi@@ cally and psycho@@ log@@ ically very ex@@ hau@@ sting .
they must be thinking of practical things - about money , if i am not more , for example , or show my wife how the bo@@ il@@ er time setting works .
if you have received bad news , you will be negative .
you must look forward .
as the father of el@@ lie , 16 , and tam@@ s@@ in , 14 , the same is not always easy .
&quot; for parents , this is difficult , &quot; he says .
it is difficult to know what to say and how much .
when i first started my diagno@@ sis , i told my girl that i had a disease that i could not live with .
it was very different .
tam@@ s@@ in is very soci@@ able and un@@ st@@ up@@ id .
they told us to tell their friends and we soon got a lot of calls .
el@@ lie was cau@@ tious .
she did not say much .
such talks are something that all cancer patients should be able to make .
but for mes@@ o@@ the@@ li@@ o@@ gram ran@@ gers such discussions are not ho@@ p@@ eless , not from a tr@@ ace of hope for survival .
the disease causes ( as it eventually does for ste@@ p@@ ens jack@@ y go@@ ould ) a fl@@ ur@@ ry of security .

china is ref@@ using to grant hong kong the right to government , demonstr@@ ators are re@@ tali@@ ating , and the chinese are re@@ tali@@ ating .
on sunday , the chinese parliament decided , despite the increasing calls for democratic reforms , to vote against the nom@@ ination of candidates for the 20@@ 17 elections by the hong kong elec@@ tor@@ ate .
this procedure is probably the best way to convince the long-@@ announced pro@@ tests in hong kong &apos;s business district , while activi@@ sts are planning and mobil@@ ising within a few hours of the announcement .
the chinese people ’ s congress ’ s decision allows communist leaders to “ take all the pe@@ king@@ -@@ fi@@ ghts from candidates away . ”
&quot; this is not un@@ expected , but it makes us an@@ gr@@ y , &quot; said legal expert em@@ ily la@@ u , chairman of the democratic party .
that is not what pe@@ king promised .
the inhabitants of hon@@ dur@@ as were being lied to .
and it is clear that we are dealing with an author@@ itarian regime that is not .
in his defense of china ’ s decision , li fe@@ i , vice secretary general of the permanent committee of the national people ’ s congress , said that the admission of public nom@@ inations in the hong kong government ’ s elections to “ cha@@ otic ” .
since 1997 , when britain lost control of hong kong to the chinese , the chinese have been for@@ ging ahead with the idea of leaving the people in government from 20@@ 17 .
china ’ s leaders presented the sunday decision as a democratic break@@ through , because it gave the hong kong people a direct election right to vote , but the decision also made it clear that the chinese leadership was going to change the process through a closely controlled beijing .
after a new clause , it is also proposed that only candidates who are &apos; with love for the country and love for hong kong &apos; should be allowed to do so .
the decision follows a summer in which some of the largest and most popular film festi@@ vals in the world are taking place in hong kong for several years .
behind the pro-@@ democratic campaign in hong kong is the oc@@ cu@@ p@@ y central movement with love and peace .
on sunday evening , the european parliament and the council had agreed to a new convention within a few hours of the announcement .
the demonstration was attended by the organiz@@ ers saying that their movement was going to take a new stage of civil dis@@ o@@ be@@ di@@ ence and that they will be able to plan protest waves in the coming weeks .
they did not , however , specify any more , apparently , about problems with the authorities .
in an online communication , the organiz@@ ers informed that the movement &quot; the be@@ sie@@ ged the central district only as the last means in consideration &quot; .
we are sorry to say that the commission is now in full agreement with all the options for dialogue and that the occupation of the central district has definitely taken place .
the authorities in hong kong have been working on the announcement of beijing &apos;s intention to close the negotiations with the chinese authorities on sunday .
the ri@@ ots are being sti@@ r@@ red by the feeling of many in hong kong that they are slowly losing control of their city .
the addition of people from the main@@ land increases competition for products and services .
moreover , fear of the us and china ’ s values being vio@@ lated is growing .
some cri@@ tici@@ zed the oc@@ curren@@ ces of occup@@ y centre movement , because it did not stop business - the life cycle of hong kong &apos;s - from being put at risk .
&quot; pro@@ tests , which you talk about , could have major economic damage , the more you have to suffer , the more you will suffer .
we do not want to raise any fears that hong kong will be over@@ turned .
this impression is bad for investment .
the state@@ -@@ controlled media of china reported that the chinese government has recently reported on the democratic activi@@ sts in hong kong as being threatened by western powers .
this summer , activi@@ sts organised an un@@ official referendum in which the election rights of the people of the country were shared by 7@@ 8@@ 0,000 people - more than one fifth of the hong kong elec@@ tor@@ ate .
in july , tens of thousands took part in one of the largest democratic demonstra@@ tions in the region ’ s history .
the tradition of school leaving b@@ alls in the us is now being extended to universities , where fres@@ h@@ men appear .
we are looking forward to respon@@ ding to this demand and to be able to offer the first luxurious uk travel service to students today .
to make an impressive performance at the university , we have developed a new platform for transportation experts .
mr ste@@ w@@ art also stated that the service is a security part .
this service is an ideal alternative for students who would otherwise have their own hab@@ its in a danger@@ ously over@@ loaded car .
together with our new vi@@ f options we look forward to working with you to make sure that the students have the opportunity to study the university with a minimum of effort and luxury .
a business search engine said that the number of new book@@ ings has not yet been made , as the service has only just been introduced , but added that the &quot; students have not yet fully completed the service in the coming weeks &quot; .
the company also announced that it had not received any applications for the study , despite the tu@@ ition fees of £ 9@@ ,000 per year .
students today are different in their expectations and demands from the students on 10 , 20 , 30 or 40 years ago - it is more important than ever to have a great first impression , and with visa , you can get exactly that .
the national student union critic@@ ised the service as a separate issue .
me@@ gan dun@@ n , vice president of the n@@ us for higher education said : &quot; this offer seems to be completely separate from the lives of the majority of students .
many students who have been working this month will see themselves facing a crisis of living costs .
fem@@ ini@@ sts cri@@ tici@@ ze race and police behavior after far beyond fer@@ g@@ us@@ on
the un@@ armed te@@ en@@ ager was born in the early hours of this month by a police officer in fer@@ g@@ us@@ on , mo .
the participants raised their hands in the air and san@@ g , &quot; hands high , not sho@@ ot , &quot; while they were standing before fun@@ eral .
after two weeks of pro@@ tests in fer@@ g@@ us@@ on , mo , due to the sho@@ oting of the un@@ armed te@@ en@@ ager michael brown , i noticed the blo@@ gg@@ ers of mi@@ ri@@ am zo@@ il@@ a per@@ e@@ z a change in online .
after your experience , white fem@@ in@@ ist comm@@ ent@@ ators are putting gender before the race , when it comes to fighting real re@@ productive rights and income inequality .
while ten@@ sions in the middle west have ris@@ en , and attention has been paid to the whole country , pe@@ re@@ z saw that white women ’ s responses to the bre@@ ed were 100 % r@@ aci@@ al .
compared to the answers black women briefly after the students , the 9@@ th of august , personal es@@ says with tips and tr@@ ic@@ ks like &quot; thoughts on fer@@ g@@ us@@ on by a white woman &quot; and &quot; fem@@ in@@ ism is not only about op@@ pression .
but for pe@@ re@@ z , this meant an important change .
&quot; i do not think that you can be a lot of people in fem@@ in@@ ism who are able to be knowledge and enjoy privile@@ ges in such a high class way , &quot; she said .
people felt the need to be able to do something about the events that took place .
it is characteristic of the crisis in which we are in and because the situation in far east is so ethnic and so different from that in the west .
for english prof@@ ess@@ ors k@@ ori@@ th@@ a mit@@ ch@@ ell of the o@@ hi@@ o state university , she brought fer@@ g@@ us@@ on problems that the black economy has not been able to face every day , but which are not considered as &apos; women &apos;s issues &apos; .
&quot; i can find something fun@@ ny on fac@@ e@@ book about me and my partner and get 150 lit@@ res of everywhere .
if i can post something about how col@@ oured in your own country can be used under sie@@ ge , the silence is e@@ ars be@@ wil@@ dering .
&quot; how can it be safe for women to talk publicly about a relationship , but not about security in public space ? &quot; he asked .
for black women and mit@@ ch@@ ell , who are r@@ aci@@ al , sex and sex@@ u@@ ality in the history of the us , there is no den@@ se culture between race and religion .
for them , black women do not have the luxury of being able to clean up the subjects ; they live every day in the combined reality .
while white women are now raising the issues of race and sex in fem@@ in@@ ist main@@ stream cir@@ cles , they say that they are not the ones who are the ones who are the subject of gender research .
&quot; between 18@@ 65 and 18@@ 90 , at least 10@@ ,000 black men were gel@@ y@@ n@@ cht and the justi@@ fication was almost always the ra@@ pe of a white woman , &quot; said hat@@ tery .
white women had to be involved in the story to get the ly@@ n@@ ch murder .
for h@@ at@@ tery came the division between white and black women on the point where they were white figh@@ ters .
&quot; they met the decision to op@@ t for the right to vote for women , and the right to vote for black people should come later , &quot; said h@@ at@@ tery .
if you remember such things , you will be power@@ fully aware of why col@@ oured women are white women not d@@ are .
we have done our job not well .
we have never been able to help black women to get their hus@@ bands and s@@ ons to protect .
even after women had been granted the right to vote in 19@@ 20 , it took a decade for women to become independent of the ly@@ n@@ x in the association .
the group was founded almost 40 years after the original request for help from black women , says mit@@ ch@@ ell .
for mit@@ ch@@ ell , the flo@@ od of white fem@@ in@@ ist re@@ actions to the violence that fer@@ g@@ us@@ on raised - police behavior , r@@ aci@@ al discrimination - is a mirror of the time when female white fem@@ in@@ ist men &quot; catch &quot; .
&quot; would it not be great if the activi@@ sts who are talking about such traditional fem@@ in@@ ist platforms were to have the right to education of a child so seriously se@@ wn as they do with the right to receive it ?
fem@@ ini@@ sts of the second generation , who have completed their care@@ ers in the struggle for re@@ productive rights and access to contrac@@ ep@@ tion , are now in a position to understand that what the means is .
the famous white fem@@ in@@ ist acti@@ vis@@ t gl@@ oria str@@ inger went to the city two weeks after the sho@@ oting of michael brown .
&quot; i hope that women who have a different but parallel relationship will be able to find a new one in@@ he@@ rent to the body .
although ste@@ ep is a more inter@@ sec@@ tional fem@@ in@@ ism , in which ra@@ pe and religion are not included , it is not the case that some of your comments on r@@ aci@@ al issues are very much in evidence in america .
christ@@ ina som@@ mer , resear@@ cher at the american enterprise institute and author of the university of applied sciences , usa .
there are now hundreds of specific programmes for girls and young women , but almost nothing for bo@@ ys .
but when the white house recently opened a small program , my brother &apos;s key , i was able to see the vulnerable people in black and heat .
the relationship between the police and the black community is not the only problem that has developed into the fore@@ ground of the main@@ stream fem@@ in@@ ism .
after the us border police had collected nearly 6@@ 3@@ ,000 un@@ accompanied min@@ ors at the sou@@ th@@ west border of the country this year , the country &apos;s issue of immigration reform is also appe@@ aring again - this time as a women &apos;s issue .
andre@@ a mer@@ c@@ ado , co-@@ chair of we bel@@ ong to@@ ge@@ ther , an organization that supports women in immi@@ grant reform .
&quot; they speak for themselves , &quot; said mer@@ c@@ ado .
if the vast majority of the work vis@@ as are sent to male immigrants , they will be women who they ac@@ company .
&quot; these stories find a sustainable in the women &apos;s organisations , &quot; she said .
&quot; por@@ k house &quot; in ip@@ sw@@ ich stands for sale .
the image of a house for sale was taken by real estate agents when it became clear that it was a large por@@ k that had to be sold in the living room .
the de@@ t@@ ached house has one bedroom , located on a private road in ip@@ sw@@ ich and is used for 1@@ 20@@ ,000 £ .
for the details , a picture of the living room of the house , including a large sw@@ an , was included in the room .
real estate consult@@ ants con@@ n@@ ell@@ s said that pi@@ g on the photo was the pet .
&quot; the photo was incorrec@@ tly taken out and was now removed &quot; , said a spo@@ kes@@ woman of the company .
the ex@@ pos@@ é of the house described con@@ nel@@ les ’ former for@@ ti@@ fication house as a “ unique building ” .
although the bro@@ ker has the image of the website removed , it seems still on advertising material .
the house sale in the social media provided an interest , when some asked whether the house &apos;s pi@@ g was in the purchase price .
s@@ w city har@@ ve@@ y is home to the lo@@ t@@ to@@ ff@@ e@@ is@@ en , a new mil@@ li@@ on@@ air@@ e in the netherlands , after lo@@ t@@ to@@ w@@ ering a new mil@@ li@@ on@@ air@@ e after lo@@ t@@ tery win .

sear@@ ched for a new mil@@ li@@ on@@ air@@ e in the sou@@ th@@ west of per@@ th , with a happy winner who is out of the lo@@ t@@ tery on saturday almost 1.@@ 1 million $ .
a newspaper ki@@ os@@ k in har@@ ve@@ y moved to the new york city for the second time in five years .
the lu@@ cky winner must , however , register .
the shop owner ste@@ ve for@@ ward said that the profit is for con@@ vers@@ ation in the small town in the sou@@ th@@ west of per@@ th .
the city is not talking about anything else , and everyone is quite ex@@ ci@@ ted .
we thought that a proposal of this kind could come about .
eight wa@@ -@@ winners won last month win@@ s in the first division .
last week , a player from can@@ ning v@@ ale was arrested for one of the five mil@@ li@@ on@@ ai@@ res in august , after a couple of be@@ ll@@ mon@@ t &apos;s wife had won the me@@ ga@@ -@@ win of $ 7.@@ 5 million .
the winning couple had been in the game for twenty years and said that the gain allows them to travel around the world and buy a new house .
the mil@@ li@@ on@@ air@@ e from har@@ ve@@ y is the 5@@ 9@@ th winner of the first division in the wa this year , with a total of almost $ 85 million .
leon@@ id@@ as asked the gl@@ ad@@ y-@@ di@@ at@@ o@@ ren@@ arena to take part in the gla@@ di@@ ator arena .
not only the gla@@ di@@ ators were standing on the an@@ k@@ le in the mat@@ sch at the first rhe@@ in@@ b@@ ach@@ er r@@ ö@@ mer@@ tag in the park .
but the attr@@ action of the event was strong enough to be able to attract more than 1000 visitors yesterday , who will visit the ra@@ in@@ sho@@ wers and the autumn cold tro@@ t@@ ted and will be able to escape from the historic spectac@@ le .
there was a colour@@ ful ri@@ p@@ ening of representa@@ tions , performances , games , exhibition pieces and information about the time of the roman@@ s and their importance for the rh@@ ine land .
the main attr@@ action of the day was undoubtedly the mar@@ ti@@ alistic force of the army of the gla@@ di@@ ator school &quot; a@@ om@@ or mor@@ tis &quot; , which had to fight every ra@@ iny break to stay in the city with soft sand .
gla@@ di@@ ator owners &quot; le@@ oni@@ das &quot; are able to prove themselves hum@@ or@@ ous and competent .
first , the &quot; pro@@ voca@@ te@@ urs &quot; were in the row with rec@@ tan@@ gu@@ lar shi@@ eld and short s@@ word , as well as leg@@ s on the left le@@ g and arm@@ rail on the right arm .
the first two were the &quot; es@@ se@@ d@@ ari@@ i &quot; with a bre@@ ast shi@@ eld , short s@@ word and a lit@@ ter and iron gla@@ di@@ ator ring .
the hotel was very clean and the staff were very helpful .
we are not sure whether the s@@ words are me@@ tal@@ lic , the shi@@ el@@ ds are sh@@ ep@@ per@@ ts and the lit@@ ter lan@@ es are going through the arena , so that a fear and a b@@ ite could be created for the health of gla@@ di@@ at@@ ers .
but i was not able to respond to the imposing &quot; sum@@ ma ru@@ d@@ is &quot; , the mus@@ cu@@ lar re@@ fe@@ ree , an always atten@@ tive eye .
&quot; we wanted to make the daily life of rome revi@@ ve and to preserve the culture of the roman era &quot; , explains the lord of the r@@ ings e@@ us@@ kir@@ chen , chairman of the organiz@@ er &quot; gir@@ o r@@ ö@@ mer@@ kan@@ al &quot; .
after two years of preparation , the leisure park for a day became a &quot; opport@@ un@@ istic &quot; romantic &quot; .
after all , the roman@@ s have not only fought war and con@@ quest in our region , but also the roman culture and numerous buildings that we still adm@@ ire today .
remains of these were also found at the roman day .
the fron@@ tin@@ us company provided the water and energy supply once and now , and business leaders were pe@@ tra fr@@ ic@@ ke , who knew : &quot; we are still making use of the knowledge of the past &quot; .
this also confir@@ ms the diplom@@ a of surve@@ ying engineers r@@ alp@@ h he@@ ili@@ ger of the &quot; engineering team two &quot; from rhe@@ in@@ bach , the surve@@ ying instruments of the roman@@ s as ch@@ or@@ ob@@ at , gro@@ ma or di@@ op@@ tra .
the roman villa in blan@@ ken@@ heim presented ski equipment for the first time in the history of the city .
the impressive pede@@ strian prec@@ inc@@ t , which was created by wol@@ f and fu@@ ch@@ s two mill@@ en@@ nia ago in the foot@@ steps of cla@@ y , before the first fire was bur@@ ned .
in 2011 , the office of land@@ mark maintenance had a meeting with the rhe@@ in@@ land regional office to examine the remains of a roman villa in the nor@@ d industrial park in rhe@@ in@@ bach .
they have f@@ encing walls of an economic building with a dar@@ re to dry from gra@@ in .
the building probably led to a villa rus@@ tic@@ a , a farm , which explains the history of the archae@@ ological site dr. jen@@ ni@@ fer mor@@ sch@@ ei@@ ser .
a number of finds were found in these exc@@ av@@ ations , which were in a glass display .
the villa was probably built from the first to the fourth century ad to christ , until the collapse of the german@@ s in the roman empire .
the company was founded in 198@@ 5 by the founder of the company , the founder of the company , and the owner of the company was the founder of the company .
at the roman thermal sp@@ as in z@@ ü@@ l@@ p@@ ich , children were allowed to put mo@@ sa@@ ics themselves , at the stand of the glass museum rhe@@ in@@ bach gl@@ as@@ mo@@ sa@@ ics and to participate at the ei@@ fe@@ l net@@ ter@@ sh@@ ei@@ m nature centre .
the two-@@ ti@@ er , two-@@ col@@ d-@@ bloo@@ ded original , is a perfect example of roman travel wag@@ on .
with a roman week of 13@@ th to 21st september , the town of w@@ ach@@ t@@ berg will also be able to become part of the r@@ hin@@ eland tri@@ um@@ ph@@ ed year 20@@ 14 , which is due to the death of emper@@ or au@@ gu@@ st@@ us 2000 years ago .
together with the home and history tra@@ in@@ ers and the w@@ ach@@ t@@ ber@@ ger wan@@ der@@ -@@ vere@@ in , the partnership association and the la@@ i@@ en@@ spi@@ el@@ ba@@ ke@@ m , them@@ atic hi@@ kes , a lec@@ ture , cooking evening and much more .
for example , a roman calendar is used to describe the position of a legi@@ on@@ na@@ ire on the by@@ gone w@@ ach@@ t@@ berg , to describe plants as living monuments from the roman era and to create a fun@@ ny teaching lesson in international re@@ hab@@ ilitation .
the ad@@ endor@@ fer ele@@ mentary school is devoted to the development of the roman catho@@ lic church in the course of a project week .
the roman week is intended to bring together the numerous but often no longer at first sight trac@@ es of the roman@@ s in w@@ ach@@ t@@ berg .

e@@ bol@@ a : the ep@@ ide@@ mic is bur@@ den@@ ing west africa ’ s economy
the e@@ bol@@ a ep@@ ide@@ mic in west africa is also a serious b@@ low to the economy .
markets are or@@ ph@@ an@@ ed - and international companies are distance .
the dev@@ ast@@ ating e@@ bol@@ a ep@@ ide@@ mic has given western africa &apos;s economy a heavy b@@ low .
the har@@ v@@ est is ro@@ ta@@ ted in fields that are min@@ eral depos@@ its and markets are wa@@ tered down - the virus has left the region hard to cope with .
some international companies are already taking a distance .
&quot; the e@@ bol@@ a ep@@ ide@@ mic is not only a medical crisis , but also an economic one , &quot; the chief of the african development bank , don@@ ald k@@ ab@@ er@@ u@@ ka , has said .
liber@@ ia is hard@@ est hit , and the situation is worse .
&quot; it is a total disaster , we lose a lot of money , &quot; says al@@ ha@@ ji b@@ am@@ o@@ go , who is on the second largest market in liber@@ ia &apos;s capital , mon@@ ro@@ via .
the market is only the one who can produce food or something to dis@@ inf@@ ect e@@ bol@@ a .
liber@@ ia is hard@@ est hit by the virus , gradually losing its live@@ li@@ hood .
recently , the health authorities , the disease was in every corner of the country , said .
in gu@@ ine@@ a , sier@@ ra le@@ one and ni@@ geria , too , the virus has spread .
overall , more than 15@@ 00 people have died , thousands more were put in .
foreign companies are attrac@@ ting employees from abroad .
throughout the resource rich countries , companies are continuing to operate .
foreign companies such as the steel group ar@@ cel@@ or mit@@ tal are re@@ loc@@ ating their employees , several international airlines are flying the affected regions .
the local deal@@ ers and farmers are also re@@ acting : few merchan@@ ts are still leaving their home markets to buy supplies .
in some areas in sier@@ ra le@@ one and liber@@ ia , which are suffering quar@@ ant@@ ine , the situation is ro@@ tting , among other things , the cas@@ pi@@ an and p@@ oul@@ try crops that are important for export .
farmers d@@ are not vote for the har@@ v@@ est , but they do .
food is scar@@ ce , and food is scar@@ ce .
&quot; people are becoming less and less travelling , &quot; says phil@@ li@@ pe de v@@ re@@ yer , paris expert for the economy of west africa .
the man , for example , who normally goes to the market and sel@@ ls his vegetables , would rather stay at home .
the population therefore receives the consequences of the ep@@ ide@@ mic directly and urgently : food is being scar@@ ce .
in the markets , the pre@@ val@@ ence of basic food such as rice is di@@ min@@ ishing .
at the same time , the highly dependent region of international firms is threat@@ ening to create an image – with far-@@ reaching consequences .
the greatest danger is that international companies will basically leave the area for a long time , says phili@@ ppe hu@@ g@@ on of the french think tan@@ k ir@@ is .
it is crucial to know how far and how long the virus will spread .
investors may think that the &quot; real &quot; is a dangerous situation in gu@@ ine@@ a , sier@@ ra le@@ one and liber@@ ia .
the disease also places a stra@@ ined burden on the state budgets of the states of the states of the european union , which are in a difficult state .
the disease also places a heavy burden on the already str@@ ingent national budgets of the states concerned .
the credit rating agency mo@@ o@@ dy &apos;s is afraid that the european union &apos;s budget will be heavily influenced by the high expenditure on health care and , in addition , by the wor@@ sen@@ ing economy .
the african development bank promised to provide the health systems of the countries concerned with eur 60 million ( $ 45 million ) .
the effects of this are also notic@@ eable in ni@@ geria , where so far few e@@ bol@@ a cases have been diagno@@ sed .
while oil rich region in the southern ni@@ ger del@@ ta has not been affected so far .
but elsewhere , there are many people who are already being left out of fear of inf@@ ection .
reservations in hotels are also clearly lower .

the for@@ tress cha@@ pel is the br@@ ass band bern@@ ga@@ u .
the pat@@ ron@@ age has been given to may@@ or wol@@ f@@ gan@@ g wild and secretary of state al@@ bert fü@@ r@@ ack@@ er .
the original name &quot; protec@@ tive society t@@ ann@@ en@@ wal@@ d bern@@ ga@@ u &quot; dates from 19@@ 07 when the first german forest protection association was founded on march 21 .
the na@@ zi regime had the dis@@ solution of the association in 19@@ 37 .
it was only in 196@@ 4 that 19 young men were found , who were born on 30 april in the gu@@ es@@ thouse lu@@ k@@ as , the &quot; ne@@ ue sch@@ ü@@ tz@@ en@@ vere@@ in &quot; t@@ ann@@ en@@ wal@@ d &quot; bern@@ ga@@ u .
kar@@ l march and ad@@ ol@@ f ried conducted the association as a protec@@ tor through a difficult initial stage .
as early as the fall of 196@@ 5 , the sch@@ ü@@ tz@@ en@@ vere@@ in started its activities in the inn &quot; le@@ in@@ inger &quot; with two teams .
in the following years , the us sports sho@@ ot@@ ers , who have now been organized in seven teams , established themselves in all classes until the 1st ga@@ ul@@ lig@@ a .
the association record was reached in the first half of the year and the mag@@ ical limit of 3@@ 80 r@@ ings was first reached in 1980 by ru@@ di me@@ i@@ er .
as the performance of the active protection increases , the protection of the environment has also increased .
after the club &quot; l@@ one in@@ inger &quot; was no longer able to meet the demands of a modern protec@@ tor association , the association has decided to extend its activities to the former management , led by jo@@ han@@ n r@@ inn .
after working at 2@@ 700 hours , the company issued a contract on 8 may 198@@ 8 with the par@@ ish str@@ ass@@ er for the new protec@@ tive rooms .
one of the great highlights of the association &apos;s history was certainly the 4@@ 4th ga@@ ult , combined with the celebr@@ ation of the f@@ es@@ tive wei@@ ghts of the new flag in july 1991 .
on 23 and 24 april 1994 , the sch@@ ü@@ tz@@ en@@ vere@@ in founded its 30@@ -@@ year anniversary .
1995 is a b@@ ö@@ ll@@ er@@ gr@@ up@@ pe .
jo@@ se@@ f sch@@ mal@@ z@@ l was born in berlin .
a major challenge for the &quot; b@@ ö@@ ll@@ ere &quot; and for the club as a whole was the orientation of the bav@@ arian b@@ ö@@ ll@@ er@@ tre@@ ff@@ en 2005 .
in many hours of volunte@@ er work , the club members last year took the premises and the sho@@ oting facility in the bern@@ ga@@ u hof to moder@@ ni@@ ze and thus updated the state of the art .
ele@@ ven teams in la@@ p competi@@ tions are fighting for the last 15 years .
you can also see the sporting achievements of the sch@@ ü@@ tz@@ en@@ vere@@ in .
overall , 11 teams are currently participating in the round competi@@ tions : six air teams , six air gun@@ s , one air gun team and two team .
the first team with lars ell@@ rich , k@@ ath@@ ar@@ ina ell@@ rich , ste@@ ff@@ i gra@@ d and ker@@ sti@@ n kel@@ ler@@ mann is in the round 2013 / 14 of the gau@@ ob@@ er@@ lig@@ a ( highest league in the eng@@ ad@@ ine ) .

mer@@ kel spe@@ aks of power@@ -@@ word : &apos; tol@@ l becomes &apos; quite clear &apos; .
now the commission &apos;s chancell@@ or is once again making a clear commitment to this .
a licence for all the complicated details is to make it impossible .
persi@@ stent opposition to the eu &apos;s c@@ du to the p@@ k@@ w tol@@ l has led the c@@ su to increasingly demand that the car be replaced .
chancell@@ or ang@@ ela mer@@ kel has , after sustained opposition from the government , with@@ drawn from her c@@ du a power word for introducing a car tol@@ l .
&quot; to be quite clear , you are in the coalition agreement with the european parliament , and you will come , &quot; said the party leader on monday after meetings of the c@@ du top bodies in berlin .
you can access a detailed model by mer@@ kel , however , for the time being .
in the black and red governance programme , &apos; certain parameters &apos; are mentioned .
the federal minister of state alexander do@@ br@@ in@@ dt ( c@@ su ) made a proposal and the council is now working on it .
the n@@ r@@ w-@@ c@@ du insi@@ sts , however , on its rejection of a tol@@ l on all roads .
mer@@ kel stressed that financial ministers , wol@@ f@@ gan@@ g sch@@ ä@@ u@@ ble ( c@@ du ) , too , are constructive in the discussions on a draft law .
we have also discussed this with do@@ br@@ in@@ dt and other possibilities , more privacy and more transparency in the investment process .
&quot; there is nothing special about it &quot; , sch@@ ä@@ u@@ ble had a &quot; mirror &quot; on sunday .

&quot; the coalition agreement was never based on the as@@ sumption that all cir@@ cles and federal roads were built , &quot; said the north rh@@ ine west@@ ph@@ ali@@ an cl@@ us@@ ter of the c@@ du .
in this respect , it is an important signal that sea ha@@ ul@@ age has now announced that it will be able to speak again about the issue .
opposition to the plans is also expressed by the c@@ du national associations ba@@ den w@@ ür@@ t@@ tem@@ berg and rhe@@ in@@ land@@ -@@ p@@ fal@@ z .
the background to this is fear that a tol@@ l will make small border traffic to neighbouring countries more difficult .
see@@ ho@@ fer had a very long time to go to the city because of tol@@ l criticism from the c@@ du coalition .
the left sees the plans as being un@@ realistic in the face of the dispute in the union .
&quot; the mur@@ ks tol@@ l is dead &quot; , said party leader mar@@ gare@@ t ri@@ e@@ x@@ inger of the &quot; new os@@ n@@ ab@@ r@@ ü@@ ck newspaper &quot; ( monday ) .
&quot; with the tol@@ l , the minister fails &quot; do@@ br@@ in@@ dt wants to make a vig@@ net@@ te duty on all german roads , which will start in 20@@ 16 .
domestic car owners may , according to coalition agreement , not add bur@@ dens .
therefore , they should be informed of a full impact on the environment through the motor vehicle tax .
the model may not be used by foreign drivers , however , under eu law , for reasons of nation@@ ality .
genetic dis@@ order is often mis@@ diagno@@ sed , but it is not diagno@@ sed properly .
a british man says she thought that as a result of a mis@@ diagno@@ sis for many years she would die .
kar@@ in ro@@ d@@ ger lived almost all her youth in the belief that they were only a few years away from being a child .
she was actually suffering from the char@@ cot@@ -@@ mari@@ e-@@ to@@ oth disease ( c@@ mt ) - a group of in@@ h@@ eri@@ ted dis@@ orders that could cause ner@@ ves outside the brain and sp@@ inal cor@@ d .
char@@ ity c@@ mt uk parti@@ ci@@ pa@@ tes in the report that mis@@ diagno@@ ses are a common problem for people with c@@ mt because there is so little known about this disease .
about 23@@ ,000 people in britain are likely to suffer from c@@ mt , which leads to motor dis@@ orders such as mus@@ cle weak@@ ness , un@@ safe gear , and cr@@ um@@ b@@ led to@@ es .
patients suffer from the same type of di@@ ar@@ rhe@@ al or pain , and the disease is incur@@ able and progres@@ sively spre@@ ading , which means that symp@@ t@@ oms are linked to time worse .
when ro@@ d@@ gers 13 was , she believed that she was interested in peaceful at@@ a@@ xi@@ al ( fa ) bodies .
ro@@ d@@ ger thought she would be in the whe@@ el@@ chair before she was 18 , and before her 30 birth@@ day , she would die .
the mother of two children who today lived 51 years old said : &quot; when i was a child i knew that i was not the same thing as the other children .
i constantly fell in love with the camera and everything las@@ ted longer .
i could never agree with the other children roll@@ er sho@@ e or sk@@ ate@@ board and was often critic@@ ised in school for my way of walking and walking .
ro@@ d@@ ger said that they were born at the age of 13 after several operations to reli@@ eve their ach@@ ill@@ es .
&quot; i felt guil@@ ty , because i was cur@@ ious and i was not able to see the problem .
when i received a reply , i was sho@@ c@@ ked and d@@ read@@ fully pan@@ ic .
i thought that i was playing with 18 in the whe@@ el@@ chair and with 25 dying , and in between i slowly became losing all my skills .
i made all this with me alone and planned to make my own fun@@ eral .
she said when she was 17 , her mind became clear that her skills were not as much di@@ min@@ ished as she would have imag@@ ined and asked her hus@@ band .
he was simply up and embr@@ ac@@ ed me and said that &apos; my love , i believe not that i am you .
i think you have a lot less life threat@@ ening feeling .
after some genetic tests , she was diagno@@ sed with c@@ mt .
&quot; when he told me what c@@ mt was , he felt like he was a real person who won the contest , &quot; she said .

tax burden on business people in washington is rising with the economic recovery .
a recovery in the economy means more customers , more sales and new jobs .
it also means higher taxes .
state and local tax information for companies in the country increased by more than eur 1 billion last year , while economic recovery acceler@@ ated , so a newly published study in the past week , and firms in the washington area bill .
companies in the district , mar@@ y@@ land and vir@@ g@@ ini@@ a have paid 27@@ ,@@ 6 billion $ to government and local authorities .
the state and local tax burden of companies increased by more than 4@@ ,@@ 3 % last year to 6@@ 71 billion dollars , compared with 3.@@ 9 % in 2008 .
state taxes increased more than local taxes .
more than half of the country ’ s tax revenues , 56 percent , comes from corporate taxes , while 36 percent of revenues go to mar@@ y@@ land .
vir@@ g@@ ini@@ a achiev@@ es a lowest tax revenue from companies with 28 % .
much of the increase in the tax revenue is due to a recovery in real estate values of companies , say , researchers .
while much of these profits are made from large states such as california , new york , and tex@@ as , the process also seems to be very different for the washington area .
companies in the district , mar@@ y@@ land and vir@@ g@@ ini@@ a paid more than $ 10 billion in government and local property taxes last year , compared with $ 9@@ ,@@ 6 billion in 20@@ 12 - a rise in the course of a year of 4.@@ 2 % .
but the seem@@ ing recovery in real estate values is not the same in mar@@ y@@ land as in increasing government and local tax revenues , because the real economy is in a state of decline , with almost one-@@ fifth of the tax advice from companies .
companies in vir@@ g@@ ini@@ a and d.@@ c. pay almost half of their state and local taxes in the form of property taxes .
&quot; in mar@@ y@@ land is done the following : a large part of the real estate , especially in the tax area around d.@@ c. , is either owned by the government or by non-@@ profit organizations that do not pay property taxes , &quot; said dou@@ gl@@ as lin@@ d@@ gl@@ as lin@@ d@@ tax@@ holm lin@@ d@@ holm .
mar@@ y@@ land is therefore forced to spend , for example , much more on income taxes to reduce the same services .
the recent recovery in tax revenues from companies cannot be the only reason for the recovery of the housing market .
company revenues seem to be reco@@ vering as well , according to the data .
companies in the region reported about income increases in the government agencies , and about $ 2.@@ 3 billion in tax revenue in the region .
mar@@ y@@ land took 1 billion $ in company income , and the government ’ s highest amount was $ 1.@@ 7 billion .
while the trend towards the same direction is continuing , local development of tax is increasing not only in all three places but also in all three places .
the rise in the district grants rate was equivalent to 4@@ ,@@ 3 percent of the national average , while the increase in mar@@ y@@ land was significantly higher than 4@@ ,@@ 9 percent .
only vir@@ g@@ ini@@ a reported a lower average tax revenue of 4@@ ,@@ 1 percent .
vir@@ g@@ ini@@ a has a 6 % stake in all three areas of office , which is significantly the lowest in corporate income taxes ( in all three there are fixed corporate tax rates ) .
the corporate tax rate in mar@@ y@@ land is 8.@@ 25 percent and in the district is relatively low .
a similar study by the us chamber of commerce at the beginning of this year showed that in vir@@ g@@ ini@@ a , lower government and local corporate taxes are required and , overall , a better fiscal climate than in mar@@ y@@ land .
the study has shown the district not to be investig@@ ated .
despite the advantages , vir@@ g@@ ini@@ a is under pressure from its southern neighb@@ our .
north car@@ ol@@ ina has laws on reducing its corporate tax rates in this year from 6@@ ,@@ 9 % to 6 % .
if the state continues to pursue its income targets next year , this law could serve as a barri@@ er to the state ’ s corporate income tax rate of up to 3 % by 20@@ 17 .
meanwhile , the us seems to be allowing small businesses in the washington area to do better , and they are therefore paying more government and local taxes , according to the latest study .
corporate taxes , which are regarded as personal income taxes by small business@@ men - a transitional structure that allows the economy to be managed by most small businesses - are paid in district , mar@@ y@@ land and vir@@ g@@ ini@@ a last year by 20 % .
researchers say that the price trend is not as high as the trend and the rise in corporate taxes throughout the country this year , with a rise in overall majority voting .
nevertheless , washington could leave behind the space that it had been possible to achieve , if the federal government cut its spending on the region ’ s labour market .
partner city : german beer for gu@@ ang@@ d@@ ong beer .
ho@@ ps and mal@@ ts - also in china a popular combination .
german beer is a very popular place in china .
frankfurt ’ s partner city in china now wants a bre@@ w@@ ery and also hopes for an air direct connection between the two cities .
german beer , used in the frank@@ fur@@ ts partner town of gu@@ ang@@ z@@ ho@@ u - that is the urgent desire of the official beer in china .
&quot; we would be delighted if a german bre@@ w@@ ery could join our city .
time and again , the func@@ tion@@ alist of the ruling communist party of china came to the house during the course of the discussion on this issue of the twel@@ ve-@@ mil@@ li@@ on-@@ metro@@ polis .
gu@@ ang@@ z@@ ho@@ u , which is also a can@@ ton in germany , is one of the rich@@ est cities in china , called li .
therefore , the people would also have the purchasing power to buy german beer .
the hes@@ sian sp@@ d chairman thor@@ ste@@ n sch@@ ä@@ fer g@@ ü@@ m@@ bel , who has been leading the german political delegation , said to the host that he would be in germany after a possible partner for the project .
&quot; for beer it does not take much : good water , gra@@ in and jo@@ ie de vi@@ vre , &quot; he added during lunch with the party leader , in gu@@ an@@ gl@@ o .
this joy of life has already been b@@ low@@ ing out mr li , fl@@ at@@ tering the host .
the commission then came up with a proposal from gu@@ ang@@ z@@ ho@@ u , which was to be welcomed by sch@@ ä@@ fer g@@ ü@@ m@@ bel , but with red wine , which was served to the meal .
the chinese brand t@@ sing@@ ta@@ o is based on german bre@@ wing art .
t@@ sing@@ ta@@ o-@@ beer is produced after the german pur@@ ity law .
more business
a second wish of the chinese hosts would be a direct flight connection between frankfurt and gu@@ ang@@ z@@ ho@@ u , said vice party chief , li .
lu@@ f@@ than@@ sa had previously offered the flight , but in 2012 it was not possible to cancel it for economic reasons .
&quot; it would be worth it again , &quot; the municip@@ al politici@@ an was convinced .
&quot; business transactions between our two cities are increasing .
at the moment , travellers would have to pay a de@@ tour through chan@@ g@@ sh@@ a in the hun@@ an province , li lam@@ ented .
the administration of gu@@ ang@@ d@@ ong province , whose capital is gu@@ ang@@ z@@ ho@@ u , is also ho@@ ping for the air connection .
the vice-@@ govern@@ or of the central government , chen y@@ un@@ xi@@ an , was responsible for this request during his con@@ vers@@ ation with the social democrats .
&quot; this is a very good idea , &quot; he rep@@ lied , sch@@ ä@@ fer@@ -@@ g@@ ü@@ m@@ bel , chinese vice minister li j@@ in@@ ju@@ n , an in@@ timate con@@ no@@ iss@@ eur of germany , no@@ d@@ ded .
a well-@@ maintained partnership
the li@@ eu@@ ten@@ ant vice-president of the party leader of gu@@ ang@@ z@@ ho@@ u hopes that the country will be able to make frankfurt a partner meeting next year .
li yi@@ we@@ i was already a member of the main team , but not yet in this position .
he came to the european parliament only this year after his pre@@ dec@@ essor had been charged with corruption from office .
the local party leader , wan q@@ ing@@ li@@ an , had to go as well .
the action against the officials from gu@@ ang@@ z@@ ho@@ u is part of a nation@@ wide campaign against corruption in party and administration , which has been launched by leader x@@ i j@@ in@@ ping with har@@ sh ri@@ g@@ our .
the new leader li yi@@ we@@ i had a very strong political position before his party career for an american company , which was highly unusual in the communist party of china .
before his in@@ aug@@ ur@@ ation in gu@@ ang@@ z@@ ho@@ u , he was a top official in fu@@ ji@@ an , where the car manufacturer was called v@@ w a big plant .
frankfurt is officially more than a do@@ zen cities partner companies .
the connection to the 9@@ 000 km dist@@ ant gu@@ ang@@ z@@ ho@@ u is one of those that is being maintained by both sides , for example with a student exchange .
last year , the 2@@ 5-@@ year-@@ old german football association was founded .
the southern chinese metro@@ polis on the pe@@ ar@@ l river is connected with its economic strength almost as much as it is with h@@ ess@@ en .
next year , she wanted to set up a gross domestic product of eur 250 billion , reported a significant increase in li .

jo@@ an ri@@ vers has been a member of the team since she was born in new york city , new york city , three days ago , but her daughter is now hope@@ ful that the 8@@ 1-@@ year-@@ old com@@ ic of her ill@@ ness is reco@@ vering .
&quot; thank you for your continued love and support , &quot; said me@@ lis@@ sa ric@@ ardo .
we are all pus@@ hing the thum@@ bs .

the re@@ actions were expressed from many quarters , including in the form of an overwhel@@ ming online support from don@@ ald t@@ um@@ p , mon@@ tel wil@@ liam@@ s and k@@ ell@@ y ri@@ pa .
environmentally friendly vacu@@ um clean@@ ers and rising wages will help to reduce the cost of waste and to reduce the number of jobs that are lost .

amaz@@ on bu@@ ys t@@ wit@@ ch for 1.@@ 04 billion $ .
amaz@@ on confirmed that the new version of the game was released on monday morning : the online re@@ tail@@ er - and video producer , and a lot of other things - bought the video stre@@ aming service t@@ wit@@ ch for 1.@@ 04 billion $ ( !
the announcement comes as a surprise , not because nobody wants t@@ wit@@ ch to be taken over , but because it is widely believed that you@@ tube is a good company to acquire .
three months ago , it looked as if the sale of t@@ wit@@ ch to the video service of google for a co@@ smo@@ politan bil@@ li@@ on@@ air@@ e decided , and the cooperation seemed to be natural .
t@@ wit@@ ch , which was only published three years ago as ju@@ st@@ in@@ .@@ tv , was known as a general stre@@ aming service - a live stre@@ aming version of you@@ tube .
instead , it quickly became a platform for players to share their flying pieces in games .
the t@@ wit@@ ch interface .
and &quot; let &apos;s play &quot; , a video game that is used to create better play .
it is just that you@@ tube is a very often called , if you want to watch t@@ wit@@ ch , so it was not the message that you@@ tube is t@@ wit@@ ch to buy , something was bo@@ red .
it is a myster@@ y why the de@@ al with you@@ tube is so un@@ successful .
everything we do at the moment about this is a statement by em@@ met s@@ lec@@ h@@ ner , president of t@@ wit@@ ch : &quot; we have chosen am@@ ate@@ ur radio to be amaz@@ on because it is our community .
another secret is that , frank@@ ly , the incredible success of t@@ wit@@ ch .
for s@@ no@@ bs like me who explain that they prefer to do sports than watch , it is hard to see the attr@@ action .
it is one thing to ask a friend at 3 in the morning to take a look at his shoul@@ der while he is walking through resid@@ ent evil , and something quite different , a sp@@ in@@ ner watching the way he is 20 times in succ@@ ession .
all these games could be seen right now .
another problem is that the many of the most popular games today are e@@ go games , so you can &apos;t see them without your own control of the perspective .
i admit that the commission &apos;s rapid progress , in the areas of transport , is not always satisfactory .
but until a game or hum@@ our virtual reality is created , the world ’ s t@@ wit@@ ch channel is probably not as interesting .
but what do ske@@ p@@ tics like me know about it ?
t@@ wit@@ ch is supported by 55 million different visitors per month and is the fourth largest source of internet traffic games in the world .
and how exactly will amaz@@ on get money from it ?
it is difficult to imagine that the t@@ wit@@ ch is as elegant in amaz@@ on as it is in the way it is .
but t@@ wit@@ ch has something that every company would like : thousands of young men who are working as advertis@@ ers , and they are not .
as the chairman of t@@ wit@@ ch , she@@ ar , said , amaz@@ on and t@@ wit@@ ch &quot; believe both of the future of the gaming , &quot; and that medium of the show no signs of a shr@@ in@@ king , nor even a change .
on the h@@ ü@@ p@@ f@@ burg near the bur@@ g@@ gar@@ ten festival , there was a lot going on saturday .
the concept of the organiz@@ ers agreed .
despite the strong rain cast on the saturday evening , the rain was estimated to reach 1@@ 200 fans .
at times , the admission had to be stopped .
&quot; that was an@@ no@@ ying , &quot; said ron se@@ m , one of the organiz@@ ers .
sal@@ z@@ we@@ del l lic@@ ht und fun .
two spanish words have become max@@ im s@@ ach@@ ra@@ j and ron s@@ em .
the open air in the sal@@ z@@ we@@ de@@ ler bur@@ g@@ gar@@ ten is intended to increase bri@@ ght@@ ness in the day and in the evening through various shows .
well , and the fun comes anyway from all@@ . i am not sure if i can get it .
this has already been demonstrated in the early evening when the first visitors were able to take part in the open air .
a festival for all generations had the organiz@@ ers promised .
and that is what you have succeeded in doing .
around the utili@@ ties on the bur@@ g@@ gar@@ ten@@ me@@ i@@ ese , sal@@ z@@ we@@ de@@ ler , but also guests from the immediate and further surroundings , were made comfortable .
they pursued the first live performances of the band , wi@@ ped with the foot in the cycle , enjoyed the k@@ ü@@ h@@ le drinks - in short : relaxation pure and enjoy@@ ment were desired .
and that is right across the generations .
while some are looking for blan@@ kets on the extra car@@ ved white sand on the beach bar , some are looking for a place to relax on a quarter of wine in the vin@@ o@@ the@@ que .
but also with children &apos;s ta@@ sting , the volunte@@ ers had a real chance to get their hands on the ball .
the larger ones used the k@@ ick@@ er tables or took part in a sk@@ ate@@ board workshop , which the good@@ fo@@ o@@ d-@@ cre@@ ws from sal@@ z@@ we@@ del put out .
until the great rain came .
shortly before 5.@@ 30 p.m. , the council pr@@ un@@ ed to the visitors , especially families su@@ ed the wide and dry land .
but the attr@@ acti@@ veness of the festival did not break this off .
&quot; more people than expected &quot; , said r@@ on s@@ em , the president of the &quot; success on the whole line &quot; .
i therefore oppose a repeat of the great party next year .
although the content and size of the event are still to be worked on , se@@ m made a first record on sunday in relation to the popular vote .
as an an@@ no@@ ying , he said that in the meantime the admission was stopped .
obviously , the security company was not sufficiently busy .
the result : some who have already paid have not been able to access the premises .
the response was very good , and the response was very positive .
in a first careful es@@ timate , the sal@@ sa bro@@ ker co-@@ organiz@@ er spoke of about 1@@ 200 visitors , who were in bur@@ g@@ gar@@ ten and were in the city .
there were problems with the sound technology .
the sal@@ z@@ we@@ de@@ ler hi@@ p-@@ hop band bloc@@ k@@ s@@ `@@ n@@ `@@ ro@@ x bro@@ ke their appearance therefore .
the techn@@ ici@@ ans were unable to find a reason@@ ably reasonable sound , and the sound was not able to be heard .
the planned sh@@ ish@@ a loun@@ ges could not be built , because the t@@ ents were not opened due to a ti@@ re break@@ down .
&quot; next year you will be there &quot; , says the organiz@@ er .
the premi@@ ere of the am@@ ula open air festival was held by the visitors of the event more than successful .
and this in bad weather .
however , the organiz@@ ers have made some mistakes which were not possible the first time , but in the second time the event was elimin@@ ated .
in the social network fac@@ e@@ book , the organiz@@ ers must also make a criticism .
&quot; sorry , but for 12 euros you just have more to expect &quot; , says mel@@ ani@@ e me@@ i@@ er on the event page .
&quot; you have a bit of re@@ tention , &quot; says e@@ le zim@@ mer@@ mann at the same place .
others see the initial problems not as closely as they were .
i think it is very good that some people are not just st@@ up@@ id talking , but are actually trying to do something .
h@@ ats off ! &apos; , ste@@ ph@@ ani@@ e jen@@ ß wri@@ tes to the am@@ ula .
now the organiz@@ ers have a year to review these critic@@ isms .
new rad@@ om in ber@@ k@@ um : w@@ ach@@ t@@ berg &apos;s land@@ mark shr@@ ink .
i am sure that is not the case .
rather , the ready component is waiting to be integrated into the distinc@@ tive building .
the action is in the context of a larger measure : almost 50 years after the creation of the space observation rad@@ ar , ti@@ ra , the shell , called rad@@ om , is completely renewed .
the new rad@@ om is equipped with a di@@ ameter of 4@@ 7.@@ 5 metres .
the size of the camera remains world record .
the last step towards comple@@ ting the new case is to add the cap@@ s to the new en@@ velo@@ pe .
the upper part of the old h@@ ul@@ l is separated and covered with a cr@@ ane .
after that , the last quarter of the new case will be set up .
if the weather is good , the action should start at the beginning of this week .
participants in the i@@ ce bug conference will be able to see the new ic@@ e-@@ bu@@ c@@ ke@@ t-@@ challenge .
is@@ ab@@ elle ro@@ ber@@ ts from the uk sh@@ ou@@ ted so much as her ic@@ e-@@ cold water was over her head .
this ic@@ e-@@ bu@@ c@@ ke@@ t-@@ challenge went pain@@ fully well , and i was very pleased with the result .
a woman was sent to the hospital after she had been taken to the ic@@ e-@@ bu@@ c@@ ke@@ t-@@ challenge so much to cr@@ y that she had to take up the ja@@ w .
is@@ ab@@ elle ro@@ ber@@ ts from the uk wrote such a large article as her ic@@ e-@@ cold water was over her head .
&quot; the water was so cold that i wrote a letter , and while i did , i stayed in a p@@ ine just like i was , &quot; she said to the mir@@ r@@ ors .
ice water is being used over the 20@@ -@@ year-@@ old .
is@@ ab@@ elle ro@@ ber@@ ts a few seconds before the accident , he was arrested for his death .
i wanted to close my mouth , but that was not possible , the ja@@ w was ha@@ ted and then he understood that i was not able to vote .
my mother and my si@@ ster saw this as well and made themselves lau@@ gh@@ ed almost in the p@@ ants , but i had to take the emergency .
the 20 year-@@ old from britain was sent to the hospital to meet the ki@@ ef@@ er after atten@@ ding the vir@@ al trend .
the cli@@ p was created to be an internet site and a thousand times on fac@@ e@@ book and t@@ wit@@ ter .
do the bur@@ g@@ vere@@ ines soon re@@ join the same line ?
the last time was when there was a constant cl@@ ash between the two wol@@ fr@@ at@@ sha@@ us@@ en bur@@ gh@@ ers .
now the management board is thinking about possible cooperation .
as a model for the reconstruction of the wol@@ fr@@ at@@ sha@@ us@@ en castle , the late richard di@@ mb@@ at , who was a former chairman of the wol@@ fr@@ at@@ sha@@ us@@ en bur@@ g@@ fre@@ un@@ de , led the project in the french gu@@ é@@ del@@ on .
just a year ago , there was no good climate between the bur@@ gun@@ dy club and wol@@ fra@@ t@@ sha@@ us@@ en bur@@ g@@ friends .
the situation seemed to be very different so far , as to how the history of wol@@ fr@@ at@@ sha@@ us@@ en castle and possible reconstruction should be handled .
now the two camps are moving closer together : they are to start talking about a common approach soon .
this is confirmed by the club board of tor@@ ste@@ n s@@ j@@ ö@@ berg ( bur@@ g@@ vere@@ in ) and her@@ bert pi@@ ff@@ l ( bur@@ g@@ fre@@ un@@ de ) on request of our newspaper .
&quot; i have listened to mr pi@@ ff@@ l and suggested that we should sit down once , &quot; he says .
in his view , all members of both clubs could in future be in the same position .
this way , visible results can be seen quickly .
while the bur@@ g@@ friends were fighting for the su@@ dden death of richard di@@ mb@@ ath until the end for the re@@ building of the castle on the mountain forest , the bur@@ g@@ vere@@ in is now in charge of the &quot; opening up and experience &quot; .
her@@ bert pi@@ ff@@ l , second chairman of the bur@@ g@@ fre@@ un@@ de , has , according to his own information , been very pleased with the call .
since di@@ mb@@ ad ’ s death , he has been standing in front of his friends in the castle .
a new chairman is due to be appointed in a general meeting in mid-@@ september .
at the moment , the association is ran@@ ked as some 40 members according to the 7@@ 4-@@ year-@@ old .
&quot; after the death of my friend richard i had to leave the city , we had the activities of the association out of respect .
according to pi@@ ff@@ l , the new chairman is then to be invited to talk to the bur@@ g@@ vere@@ in .
until then , the bur@@ g@@ friends could also take a current mo@@ od within their group .
a candidate for the presidency is not yet available , says pi@@ ff@@ l .
&quot; but i am confident that the next step will be found &quot; , he will not want to stand for himself because he has his residence in bad t@@ ö@@ l@@ z .
the new president should be a wol@@ fr@@ at@@ sha@@ user .

the different positions on reconstruction will be taken into account in pi@@ ff@@ l &apos;s eyes in the near future .
he pra@@ ises di@@ mb@@ ath as a &quot; mis@@ sion@@ ary &quot; who always believes in re@@ building the castle .
two similar , already advanced , and more advanced projects in austria and france would show that this idea is not a ch@@ im@@ ney .
the high level of public participation and voluntary help will make it possible to make a tourist offer .
pi@@ ff@@ l : &quot; i too was ske@@ p@@ tical at the beginning .
but over time i have been more and more convinced that the european union is making sense to do away with the project . &apos; it could be a &apos; one-@@ stop shop &apos; for the f@@ led industry .
there are no other things to do here .
moreover , the project would be supported by eu subsidies , visitor tickets and potential spon@@ sors .
&quot; the idea of re@@ building is something i personally do not want to throw away just because of this , &quot; he hopes that the bur@@ g@@ vere@@ in may be moving somewhat on this point .
the aim of this , initially docum@@ enting history , is &quot; important and good &quot; .
then we could look on .
cle@@ ver ways to save on uni@@ -@@ tex@@ t@@ books are now available .
as the cost of university tex@@ t@@ books is higher for many students than $ 1@@ ,000 a year , the university of applied sciences considered the issue of the fa@@ st-@@ second sem@@ ester mat@@ t sch@@ ro@@ e@@ der to be a cle@@ ver sp@@ ari@@ de .
he inven@@ ted a rental system for books of students of higher sem@@ ester and bo@@ red a no@@ table opportunity to receive a re@@ ward for the res@@ ale .
&quot; my mathem@@ a@@ tics book usually costs 18@@ 0 $ , but i got it for 10 $ for a second .
the time allo@@ t@@ ted for the last sem@@ ester would have been $ 4@@ 30 , he said .
he gave $ 120 .
the col@@ leg@@ es were told that the law of the federal republic of germany had , on average , more than $ 1,@@ 200 per year for tex@@ t@@ books and study material , but that there were different cost reduction options for students .
online stores and creative approaches are the key to success , such as the sch@@ ro@@ e@@ ders .
ren@@ ting teachers is a matter of course , and so we can offer students a book for a sem@@ ester long , often at a much cheaper price than the purchase .
ne@@ e@@ bo inc , which has more than 250 university book@@ shops , is the leading provider of online banking services in the united states .
surve@@ ys in the industry show that about a quarter of the books in the college book@@ shops are in the public domain last spring .
less than half of all tex@@ t@@ books are published by the national association of teachers , according to the commercial association of college stores in camp@@ us book@@ shops .
here is the one-@@ off for the best deals .
online purchase online , buy online , buy online , buy online , buy online , buy online , buy online , buy online , buy online .
some new books cost only one-@@ third of the price online , for which you can buy in the camp@@ us book@@ shop .
the n@@ in@@ th edition of &quot; calcul@@ us &quot; v@@ no r@@ on lar@@ w@@ on , bru@@ ce ed@@ war@@ ds and robert ho@@ te@@ t@@ ler costs almost 2@@ 90 $ , but can be ordered from the specialized tex@@ t@@ book re@@ tail@@ er che@@ gg@@ .com .

aca@@ dem@@ ics like ing@@ rid br@@ ac@@ ey , head of the university of mass@@ ach@@ us@@ et@@ ts , at the am@@ her@@ st college of wi@@ th@@ out walls , recommended that students be supported by their prof@@ ess@@ ors .
sometimes the updates are not available for the seminar .
in such cases , older issues can often be re@@ funded for a fr@@ action of the cost of the new@@ est edition .

ren@@ ting teachers is a very difficult task .
you can order more than 80 percent of the costs of a newly purchased book .
a student could , for example , use &quot; calcul@@ us &quot; for a sem@@ ester to write about $ 20 .
find out about the terms of business at the company you are ren@@ ting , also about the penalty fees that may apply to writing business notes .
ten@@ ants be careful : if you do not return the book , the penalty fees may be the price of a new book even exce@@ eded .
e-@@ books
e-@@ books instead of traditional books of tex@@ t@@ books are also an option .
sometimes these books are actually printed , but the book is also used for a specific period of time by whol@@ es@@ al@@ ers such as amaz@@ on@@ .com , che@@ g@@ g and bar@@ nes &amp; no@@ ble inc@@ . . .
at che@@ g@@ g you can buy &quot; calcul@@ us &quot; for 6 months for about 61 $ .
br@@ ac@@ ey says that students in liter@@ ary courses often have the best offers , as many classi@@ cs are free to download nowadays .
to be sure ,
jo@@ e ga@@ ult , 29 , who will soon be the pe@@ pper ’ s law school , will be the first to recommend the is@@ b@@ n number for the awar@@ ding of books .
and before you place an online order , you should check , so ga@@ ult , if the book is actually in stock .

the camera &apos;s sli@@ de show is a true highlight for the photograph@@ er .
an article by the te@@ leg@@ ra@@ ph@@ -@@ fil@@ m@@ cri@@ tic rob@@ bi@@ e col@@ lin suggests that in the children &apos;s films the lack of quality in the films is itself the reason .
col@@ lin described 20@@ 14 as &quot; the worst year &quot; so far for children &apos;s films , and described &quot; drag@@ on@@ flight hu@@ bs made easy 2 &quot; as purely &quot; functional &quot; fant@@ as@@ y continuation .
in films for a slightly older target group , it seems that the film is not always of a high quality .
in july , entertainment compared we@@ e &apos;s &quot; the average &quot; cinem@@ atic &quot; to &quot; the me@@ ta@@ -@@ cri@@ tic &quot; rating for each summer movie start , which was between the american mem@@ orial day and the 20th of july 2013 and the current year .
the results are based on the opinion of the cinema visitors and film cri@@ tics and indicate that the film is not yet available in the first place .
some comm@@ ent@@ ators believe that the development is moving towards changing visual hab@@ its and the growing popul@@ arity of web stre@@ aming media .
director j@@ on fa@@ v@@ re@@ au , who is currently working on dis@@ ney &apos;s soon released jun@@ g@@ le book film , is saying to the website h@@ ol@@ ly@@ wood .
we must accept that and not try to follow the past .
unlike the current weak economies of the cash markets of the ho@@ ll@@ y@@ wood produc@@ tions , net f@@ li@@ x recently achieved a significant increase in sales with the stre@@ aming media .
last summer , the director cri@@ tici@@ zed ste@@ ven spi@@ el@@ berg for his film studios that they were too much focused on film produc@@ tions of com@@ ics .
in the light of the current down@@ turn , the commission has been argu@@ ing that its di@@ re economic pro@@ ph@@ eci@@ es are a real core .
the summer of 20@@ 15 saw the potential for a possible cash battle , including az@@ er@@ ba@@ ij@@ an ’ s av@@ eng@@ er age of ul@@ tr@@ on , mini@@ ons , and jur@@ as@@ sic world , but other film industry representatives are more optim@@ istic :
the producer of x-@@ men , sim@@ on k@@ in@@ berg , described the decline in cas@@ hi@@ er results recently as simply &quot; cy@@ clic@@ al &quot; and said to ho@@ ll@@ y@@ wood recycling that the market is not going to be the biggest summer .
when the european union &apos;s 2nd table tennis district was opened a few years ago , the commission was able to introduce a more stre@@ am@@ lined version of the league .
now the german table tennis league has a further 3rd bun@@ des@@ lig@@ a in the program .
the result : if you have not clim@@ bed , you have gone down .
for example , g@@ ö@@ tt@@ ingen &apos;s highest class team tor@@ pe@@ do has won the top ran@@ king in the ob@@ er@@ lig@@ a release , but plays in the coming season only a fifth place .
fourth classi@@ fication : tor@@ pe@@ dos ladies , despite their gran@@ di@@ ose sc@@ ener@@ ies in the regional league .
the bo@@ ys and girls of tor@@ pe@@ do start in the lower sa@@ x@@ ony league , as well as the bo@@ ys of the s@@ c we@@ en@@ de .
the s@@ g leng@@ lers and the tor@@ pe@@ do reserves are not in the new ver@@ ban@@ ds@@ li@@ ga .
the women &apos;s figure is the t@@ v ge@@ is@@ mar in the association league , the tor@@ pe@@ do league second in the national league .
what is different from the composition is a better district class , is now the new district ’ s district elite .
t@@ sv s@@ eu@@ lin@@ en , v@@ f@@ b le@@ u@@ d@@ ing@@ sen , tor@@ pe@@ do iii , ge@@ is@@ mar , ein@@ bec@@ k , ham@@ en@@ ste@@ dt , bo@@ ven@@ der sv , lan@@ gen@@ hol@@ ten@@ sen , der f@@ c .
the district court of berlin has a number of important roles as regional representatives of the dr@@ ans@@ fel@@ d and the s@@ c we@@ en@@ de , in the district class of the tt@@ c ii , ro@@ t-@@ we@@ iss , bo@@ ven@@ der sv ii and the teams of the t@@ t ii .
g@@ ün@@ ter@@ sen , the tt@@ c and the tt@@ v ge@@ is@@ mar ii are here with the d@@ j .
the district court of berlin is home to a number of events , such as tor@@ pe@@ do iii and sat@@ ten@@ haus@@ en / w@@ ö@@ ll@@ mar@@ sha@@ us@@ en .
the team is divided into nine teams , each with nine teams .
the s@@ c we@@ en@@ de sen@@ ds its girls to the small district sli@@ ga .
the district court of berlin is also the largest city in germany .
in a district class , ho@@ stages go to ge@@ is@@ mar , tus@@ po we@@ en@@ de and the bo@@ ven@@ der sv .
in the first season of the newly established regional association , the first international competi@@ tions start in the two g@@ ö@@ tt@@ ingen with nine teams each .
in the west season , the team &apos;s red and white ii , bo@@ ven@@ der sv iii , lau@@ bach ii , tor@@ pe@@ do iv and the v , m@@ tv gr@@ one , d@@ ran@@ s@@ fel@@ der s@@ c ii , mi@@ el@@ en@@ ia .
in the east season , the team also played sat@@ ten@@ haus@@ en / w@@ ö@@ ll@@ mar@@ sha@@ us@@ en , ni@@ ko@@ la@@ us@@ berg and land@@ ol@@ f@@ sha@@ us@@ en .
the women &apos;s kre@@ is@@ lig@@ a consists of a sadd@@ en@@ haus@@ en / w@@ ö@@ ll@@ mar@@ sha@@ us@@ en ii , bil@@ sha@@ us@@ en , hem@@ el@@ n , si@@ ling@@ en ii , tus@@ po we@@ en@@ de and s@@ g r@@ hu@@ me .
that is still better than in the o@@ ster@@ o@@ de district where it is on k@@ re@@ is@@ en@@ ben@@ e no more ladies teams .
what is striking is that none of the six 2 circle classes should be reached , here the innovative and re@@ vol@@ ving power cycle will be changed .
nato summit : first pro@@ tests in new@@ port and car@@ di@@ ff
at the weekend there were pro@@ tests from the members of the nato summit in new@@ port .
on saturday , the hundreds of people gathered in the centre of new@@ port for an anti-@@ nato march .
on sunday , about 150 people arrived in car@@ di@@ ff before the town hall there , to celebrate a so-called counter@@ -@@ summit .
ste@@ ph@@ en fair@@ cl@@ ough has written for us the events at the weekend and has spoken with demonstr@@ ators from british air@@ ways .
te@@ en@@ ag@@ ers from the blue moun@@ ta@@ ins f@@ led out of the blue mountains .
two young bus@@ h@@ wan@@ de@@ rers were taken to the ro@@ pe win@@ ds after they had taken the night over to the blue moun@@ ta@@ ins in n@@ s@@ w .
the 16@@ -@@ year-@@ old girl and the 19@@ -@@ year-@@ old man bro@@ ke out shortly after sunday lunch in go@@ ve@@ ts lea@@ p in black@@ he@@ ath for her tour .
concerned susp@@ ects are not always happy with the news , but they are not happy with the news .
a search team from local communities , and re@@ bel groups , bro@@ ke out and the couple was asked to leave at about 11 p.m. near the brid@@ al ve@@ il water@@ falls .
the girl had been on her k@@ ne@@ e and the man was cr@@ ash@@ ed and had turned his head .
rescue forces are still in power over@@ night , and the government has been forced to leave on monday morning .
they were built in a stable state with a am@@ bul@@ ance in the blue mountains hospital .
anti-@@ government pro@@ tests in pakistan es@@ cal@@ ate and the political and economic crisis is es@@ cal@@ ating .
the approximately 1000 demonstr@@ ators were killed by soldiers from the p@@ tv building .
the station has after a half hour the output of the radio .
p@@ t@@ v-@@ director ath@@ ar far@@ o@@ q said that the bu@@ gs caused by stic@@ ks are not enough equipment in the re@@ dat@@ or .
dead or in@@ ju@@ red were not reported .
the demonstr@@ ators are calling for the re@@ sign@@ ation of the government , to which they are acc@@ using them of electoral fraud .
the police told us that there was a police station about one kil@@ ome@@ tre away from the residence of prime minister na@@ wa@@ z shar@@ if , be it on monday again to cl@@ ash@@ es of around 3@@ 000 demonstr@@ ators with security forces .
after hospital data , a police officer was in@@ ju@@ red .
at the weekend at least three people were killed and more than 500 were in@@ ju@@ red when demonstr@@ ators tried to sh@@ aria &apos;s residence .
they are calling for the re@@ sign@@ ation of the prime minister .
the powerful military had a very strong military presence on sunday evening after a meeting in the army headquarters .
it was also said in the communication : &apos; the army remains committed to its role of ensuring the security of the state &apos; .
the es@@ cal@@ ating violence is causing concern about the military ’ s intervention .
the opposition ’ s political leadership , im@@ ran kh@@ an , and the pre@@ ach@@ er ta@@ h@@ ir@@ u@@ l q@@ ad@@ ri , is continuing to run for years since independence day 14 august .
shar@@ if is opposed to withdrawal , and the government is not prepared to accept the withdrawal .
kh@@ an and q@@ ad@@ ri had their follow@@ ers on sunday to return to the country .
&quot; we will not go back without sh@@ ar@@ if to resi@@ gn .
q@@ ad@@ ri expressed similar views .
kh@@ an acc@@ uses shar@@ if of using the parliamentary election in may last year as a result of fraud .
q@@ ad@@ ri calls for the re@@ sign@@ ation of the central and provin@@ cial governments .
then a transitional government should review the electoral system and introduce new elections .
more than 40 000 security forces are in operation to protect the state district and to protect the area .
the demonstr@@ ators initially had been peaceful before parliament , and they were not able to convince kh@@ an and q@@ ad@@ ri of this at the weekend .
hu@@ t@@ tel@@ dor@@ fer after second season victory on place three of the table .
the 2 : 0 above gr@@ ö@@ di@@ g has a new bit@@ ter taste for rapi@@ d on sunday .
&quot; victory is very liber@@ ating , &quot; said co@@ ach z@@ or@@ an bar@@ i@@ sic , whose team with the from in the europe leader league on thursday a mid@@ night .
&quot; the success experience of the company was incredible .
sch@@ ram@@ m@@ el dre@@ am@@ tor brings rapid to the sie@@ ger@@ stra@@ ß@@ e rapid with the second season victory the right response to the dis@@ appointment against hel@@ sin@@ ki .
&quot; we wanted a positive response , &quot; said foreign def@@ en@@ der thomas sch@@ ram@@ me@@ l , who was very successful with his splendid lead vol@@ ley of the six@@ teenth century at the 14@@ th minute .
&quot; i thought i could do a lot of fru@@ stration with the thursday and i was very pleased with the result .
as a ch@@ im@@ ney on the 13@@ th nov@@ member 2010 for the last time in a bun@@ des@@ lig@@ a match , the team was still in the race .
the first meeting point in the rapi@@ d-@@ dre@@ ss will be presented to him in special memory .
&quot; for me this is something very special , i am from the rapi@@ d-@@ after@@ -@@ school &quot; , said sch@@ ram@@ ming .
due to the short-term bec@@ k sheet metal production of mari@@ o pav@@ el@@ ic back to the market .
he has enough experience to make this position mirror mode too .
the gate was worth it , it has been a popular meeting point for many assi@@ sts this year , &quot; p@@ raised bar@@ i@@ sic .
team shows character sch@@ ram@@ me@@ l delivered also the flying blue flag f@@ lan@@ k .
for before that , guests would have been able to write .
&quot; thank god we have done something good today &quot; , he noted .
bar@@ i@@ sic was even in the position that &quot; in many games before , you are better than today &quot; - against &quot; the strong@@ est team , which is this season in this sta@@ dium .
the first three-@@ point operator since 26 july has therefore shown that the team team &apos;s structure is consistent with the set@@ backs , despite int@@ act : &quot; today the commission team has shown that it is in nature &quot; .
for him , the commission is also pleased that we have finally reached zero .
much work during the country break also the conversion of the game to the bri@@ an beh@@ ren@@ dt , mari@@ o pa@@ ve@@ lier and the christian ros@@ ner .
&quot; we must not forget this , &quot; he war@@ ned bar@@ i@@ sic , who in recent three days has been working with great care and pav@@ ili@@ on players .
the country games are scheduled to take place in the near future .
one to which the break is probably particularly close is cap@@ tains , who is the owner .
he is breaking the rules for the team , going beyond pain and then going to the ground .
it is precisely at this difficult stage that he has shown that he is a very important player for us , &quot; said con@@ sta@@ ted bar@@ i@@ sic .
ho@@ f@@ mann gave the game rapi@@ ds before his ex@@ change@@ over in the 6@@ 8@@ th minute not only the structure but also achieved the second goal .
for the 3@@ 3-@@ year-@@ old who had his 3@@ 50@@ th bun@@ des@@ lig@@ a game , he was the first sta@@ ff@@ er from the game since 2 november 2013 ( 4 : 2 about the ad@@ mi@@ ra ) .
ho@@ f@@ mann : &quot; may not believe that now everything is good &quot; &quot; we have certainly also a bit of lu@@ ck , but some@@ time the game must also be lu@@ cky to come back to us .
now it is high time &quot; , said ho@@ f@@ mann .
he war@@ ned , however , that concentrated progress would be made : &apos; we must not always be black and white .
we have seen in recent weeks not as bad as the one presented was .
we must not , however , believe that everything is now good .
the importance of its role for the team was not dispu@@ ted .
it is a very young team , who i have been following very closely at the moment .
they are in some stages , however , as i have said , &quot; said ho@@ f@@ mann .
val gar@@ den@@ a co@@ ach michael bau@@ r had joined the team and had little to re@@ pro@@ ach for .
he regre@@ t@@ ted the rapid opposite response &apos; from the sor@@ ce@@ rer &apos; category , as well as the regular gate from n@@ ut@@ z in the 40@@ th minute which was taken by re@@ fe@@ ree k@@ ol@@ leg@@ ger to wr@@ ong@@ ly be .
the only criticism i have of the team is that it is not the only way to get the goal right in some ph@@ ases .
we have too little qualifications for this .
internal def@@ enders maxim@@ ili@@ an kar@@ ner saw it similar : &quot; it has started badly , then we have purely found and even a gate made .
by and large , more would have been in it .
under this s@@ in , there is ru@@ in , and there is ru@@ in .
a powerful tri@@ be showed us in our whe@@ els of myster@@ y , the summer series &quot; my piece of the rh@@ ö@@ ner lu@@ ck &quot; last friday .

a small bud@@ d@@ ha on a tree st@@ um@@ p indicates that the bud@@ d@@ ha is a spiritual bud@@ d@@ ha .
but , despite intensive research , there were only indic@@ ations of the name of the person .
dr. wol@@ f@@ gan@@ g sch@@ nei@@ der has specifically written the bis@@ hop ’ s he@@ im@@ er ’ s archive and has invited older people from the underground foun@@ tain to learn what the relationship with the spiritual community is .
the result of his research was the right us@@ eless dis@@ position for the name .

meanwhile , the sector has reg@@ a@@ ined its importance , because the pa@@ st@@ ures are actually once again being plan@@ ted on the me@@ ado@@ ws .
the area is also the core zone of the bio@@ sphere reserve .
when entering the stone collection , the first thing to do is to be careful , because the stone that is war@@ med up by the sun is also suitable for cru@@ is@@ ers .

after weeks of tu@@ g-@@ of-@@ war , italy ’ s premier and president-in-office of the eu president , mat@@ te@@ o ren@@ zi , has resi@@ sted strong conservative resistance at the eu ’ s special summit last week to nom@@ in@@ ate his foreign minister , feder@@ ica mo@@ g@@ ó@@ g@@ á@@ n .
ren@@ zi considers how the government relations of the newspaper la re@@ pub@@ b@@ lic@@ a re@@ produces the cal@@ m@@ ness of his also in the government team as fav@@ ori@@ tes .
he also exp@@ ects a boost for his &quot; re@@ forming parliament &quot; .
last but not least , ren@@ zi hopes that the rec@@ ur@@ ring anti-@@ him forces will also be able to win the battle .
the conserv@@ atives with president je@@ an-@@ cla@@ ude tr@@ ich@@ et and the president of the council , who was nom@@ inated as president of the council , will , it is said , be the dominant opinion in rome to achieve political balance .
the ch@@ efs of the united states are also going to be depu@@ ty for the commission president , mr jun@@ ck@@ er .
the outstanding agreement of the european parliament is considered to be certain .
otherwise , president gi@@ or@@ gio na@@ polit@@ ano would have been appointed president of the 4@@ 1@@ th anniversary of the ruling party ’ s appointment as a politici@@ an .

in 1999 , mo@@ gh@@ er@@ ini was vice-president of the european commission for three years .
with the election in 2001 in the lin@@ k@@ s@@ democrats ’ party council , it entered the high party politics , worked in the foreign policy department , whose leader it soon became .
she occupied traditional fo@@ cal points of italian foreign policy , such as the middle east , was rein@@ forced by studies on the nato operation in afghanistan , in which italy participated with a cont@@ ingent of troops , cultiv@@ ated contacts with the social democrats in europe .
since 2008 she has been a member of the chamber of depu@@ ties in which she has been an expert in defence and european and international affairs .
as ren@@ zi in february 20@@ 14 premier was elected , he ordered the government to withdraw the government from the constitution .
if the p@@ d is to have a better relationship with the strong peace movement in the country today , which is one of the party ’ s 40 % votes in the may eu elections , then i believe that , as in p@@ d cir@@ cles , there is a lot to be .
i agree with the acc@@ us@@ ations in brussels , which have led to too little diplomatic experience in the new eu external deleg@@ ates , and which are not being given substance in the p@@ d .

putin requires ki@@ e@@ v to accept democracy and human rights as a means of building a new relationship with the east ukraine .
russian president v@@ la@@ di@@ mir putin promised to re@@ sume the press release on sunday , when russia ’ s government was demanding the fi@@ ghts against the separ@@ ati@@ sts in eastern russia .
his spo@@ kes@@ man di@@ mit@@ ri pes@@ ko@@ v later made it clear that putin was not meant to be a “ bo@@ om ” under the control of the separ@@ ati@@ st region of eastern ukraine .
putin ’ s appeal to the ki@@ e@@ v government to negotiate on an equal foot@@ ing with pro-@@ russian insur@@ g@@ ents , however , f@@ its in with the policy he has pursued since the ri@@ ots began five months ago : help for the people .
in an interview with the state television channel channel channel e@@ ins , putin condemned the ukra@@ inian military campaign for the re@@ con@@ quest of the separ@@ ati@@ sts &apos; territories in the eastern partnership .
the kre@@ m@@ lin and the separ@@ ati@@ sts have recently seen the loss of the area they have taken as &quot; nov@@ or@@ os@@ si@@ ja &quot; or &quot; neu@@ russia &quot; , a term that is remin@@ is@@ cent of the pre-@@ revolutionary period of russian imperi@@ alism .
putin has pointed out that the country ’ s leaders are all those who , in the course of ukra@@ inian politicians ’ campaigns for the elections on 26 october , and , while government groups are supporting civil communities in the camps held by separ@@ ati@@ sts , they are ho@@ ping .
&quot; we must immediately hold extensive talks , not only on technical issues , but also on political organisation of society and the state status of the south-@@ eastern ukraine , in order to safeguard the interests of the people living there , &quot; he said .
pes@@ ko@@ v said that putin ’ s failed reference to the state of iraq in the context of greater autonomy is not a good idea .
only the ukra@@ inian government can help the eastern areas with the necessary autonomy , he said pes@@ k@@ ov .
this is not about negotiations between ukraine and russia , but about pes@@ k@@ ov , &quot; because it is not about a conflict between russia and ukraine .
clari@@ fication of the kre@@ m@@ lin spo@@ kes@@ man on correc@@ ting the &quot; mis@@ interpretation &quot; of putin &apos;s regime &apos;s remarks under@@ lined the leadership of russia in dealing with the separ@@ ati@@ st repres@@ sion .
moscow should have had far greater difficulties in getting the regions of don@@ et@@ sk and lu@@ han@@ sk to join the eastern partnership .
the autonomy that the russian diplom@@ ats have at international forums is a matter of urgency to regional governments in ukraine .
the european union &apos;s strategy , which was anne@@ xed five months ago in the black sea , is the home port for the majority of russian na@@ vy and an important trading port and historic coastal region .
the regions between ro@@ sto@@ v and russia are also very important for the region .
the ukra@@ inian president , pe@@ tr@@ o por@@ o@@ sh@@ en@@ ko , suggested in his speech on the in@@ aug@@ ur@@ ation of 7 june that ukra@@ inian legislation - after new elections - should contain amendments to the constitution that would make the relevant areas more transparent .
but his idea of autonomy seems to be in sharp contrast to that of the kre@@ m@@ lin and the separ@@ ati@@ st re@@ be@@ ls whose occupation is still under way .
putin ’ s last call to ki@@ e@@ v to negotiate with the separ@@ ati@@ st leaders on an equal foot@@ ing is followed by a visit by the us president after another incur@@ sion into the country last week .
the rus@@ si@@ an-@@ backed separ@@ ati@@ sts took over the hand@@ -@@ held , which , fe@@ aring ukra@@ inian security officials , was the first step in a campaign to take over the strategic coastal region to cri@@ me@@ a , to control no@@ vo@@ as@@ ov .
for this reason , massive civilian and military preparations are under way , with the aim of helping mari@@ u@@ pol , a steel industry industry and a 5@@ 00@@ ,000 inhabitants to survive .

thousands of foreign troops and hundreds of foreign tan@@ ks are now on the territory of the ukraine .
the eu summit decided not to take concrete action to make the leadership demand the drafting of further sanctions against russia , which would be necessary if an es@@ cal@@ ation of ukra@@ inian crisis was un@@ specified .

the h@@ ack@@ er probably has 30 images of pal@@ mer with her ex@@ -@@ friend scot@@ t spe@@ ed@@ man , including two rec@@ ord@@ ings where you can see up without in a pool .

actor se@@ th ro@@ gen condemned the attack on the h@@ ack@@ er in his t@@ we@@ et : &quot; h@@ acked images from a mobile phone to post is nothing different than the sale of h@@ ack@@ er goods . &quot;
from a purely legal point of view , the proliferation of sto@@ len images should not be toler@@ ated .
cy@@ cli@@ sts , jo@@ gg@@ ers and hi@@ kers were present at the 8@@ th bicycle race on the gro@@ ß@@ en fel@@ d@@ berg yesterday and have thus established the association &quot; help for cancer patients &quot; .
the tour , which is for one tor@@ tu@@ r , was a great experience for the other .
in one , however , everyone agreed that it was fun .
thomas stu@@ dan@@ ski is expected to have been well be@@ aten last night .
for the first time in his life , the head of the upper house of the bre@@ w@@ ery was taken by a bike to the fel@@ d@@ berg yesterday .
for the good purpose .
the little mus@@ cle but@@ ter he can easily be st@@ uck away , especially as he is not allowed to participate in the 8@@ th cycling tour on the great fel@@ d@@ berg in favour of the association &quot; help for cancer children &quot; ( frankfurt ) .
a great thing .
&quot; i now know that i can do this - fine ! &quot;
the hotel is very clean and the staff is very friendly .
ne@@ e , if i had stopped to think about it , i would have ...
as thomas stu@@ dan@@ ski , who is responsible for the c@@ du in the upper urban parliament , qu@@ el@@ les in the city ’ s 7@@ 18 participants , who were in the spring , tor@@ n up yesterday , and came close to exhaus@@ tion , but happ@@ ily .
others , by contrast , found it easier to cross the well-@@ ele@@ ven kilometres long stre@@ tch between ho@@ he@@ mark and fel@@ d@@ berg .
nor@@ man di@@ e@@ ß@@ ner , for example .
the nearby red square is a great place for green politicians to be elected by the european parliament .
he , too , is the track in a sli@@ de , as well as n@@ ina ku@@ hn , press spo@@ kes@@ person of the city of ob@@ er@@ ur@@ sel , who was working with frank gr@@ ün@@ e@@ is@@ en to get on the way .
for the two tri@@ athle@@ tes , the &quot; fel@@ d@@ berg bike &quot; was not necessarily a sporting challenge : &quot; here &apos;s the way to char@@ ity , because there we are happy to be with you - an exit we already have in our hands &quot; .
on the way , they had been appointed paul w@@ en@@ z@@ el from ob@@ er@@ re@@ i@@ f@@ en@@ berg .
the boy ( 12 ) was in the morning after ob@@ er@@ ur@@ sel to get to it again .
the frankfurt fl@@ ori@@ an zi@@ er@@ z had a great time at 9 a.m. at home in the sadd@@ le .
the &quot; f@@ red &quot; team was also fun .
for the head of the upper ur@@ se@@ -@@ k@@ ul@@ t@@ ki@@ os@@ ks , cycling tours through the fel@@ d@@ berg are simply part of the story .
he had a good time with his 6.@@ 5-@@ kil@@ o race bike for 40 minutes .
a cra@@ zy event .
for this purpose - and i am happy to be there - andre@@ as bal@@ z@@ ke said .
the dur@@ ch@@ trained main@@ zer says of itself that the new version of the new version of the track is an &quot; ambitious racing cy@@ c@@ list &quot; .
he must do so , because he was not satisfied with the &apos; fi@@ xi@@ e-@@ wheel &apos; he was on , but these are also racing bi@@ kes , but without a circuit ...
the fact that it is easy to move up the top without a wheel is proven not only by the 20 hi@@ kers who cross the white wall and the fu@@ ch@@ stan@@ z to the summit , but also by a jo@@ gger who is on a cor@@ d .
mountain guard doctor professor of vol@@ ker li@@ sch@@ ke , who has been working with his team , equipped with all@@ whe@@ ad bu@@ ll@@ y and qu@@ ad , for safety .
the 7@@ 18 participants - and so many as never before - were in the morning in groups on the track .
the first of these hi@@ kers is at 9.@@ 30 a.m.
the first steps of the cy@@ cli@@ sts and run@@ ners followed at 10 a.m.
five minutes later , the first mountain bi@@ kers set off .
b@@ ent han@@ sen , chairman of the association &quot; cycling on the big fel@@ d@@ berg &quot; , gave the start comm@@ ands and wanted the participants a nice day out .
for next year , he hopes that it will be possible to complete the route to the fel@@ d@@ berg to the safety of the participants .
