ke@@ ith el@@ li@@ son and john le@@ w@@ is cong@@ res@@ sm@@ en have tabled a legislative proposal to make it easier for trade unions to be established as a civil right .
&quot; just as unions die , the mid@@ d@@ le-@@ class jobs die , &quot; said el@@ lis@@ on , a democr@@ at from min@@ n@@ es@@ ot@@ a and depu@@ ty prime minister of the pro@@ gres@@ sive c@@ aud@@ is .
i am therefore proud to present , together with the civil rights icon john le@@ w@@ is , the law on the authorisation of staff .
this gr@@ ound@@ breaking law gives workers the same legal opportunities in discrimination on the grounds of the organisation of trade unions as in other forms of discrimination - and thus stops anti-@@ union forces .
the addition of the national labour law law to provide an opportunity for discrimination against out@@ -of-@@ work workers to organise a trade union representation in order to be able to appeal for justice in a civil court - and to seek compensation or pen@@ al fees - is essential .
but it is certainly not a radical initiative - certainly not according to american standards .
indeed , the best way to understand what el@@ li@@ son , lec@@ h , and the rest of spon@@ sors of their legislative proposal is to link back to a very american idea .
despite the set@@ backs that trade unions have suffered in recent years - in wis@@ con@@ s@@ in , mic@@ hi@@ gan and other states in general - the situation has been that americans have once forced countries around the world to take advantage of labour rights .
there was a time when millions of americans could still remember when this country was a democracy , freedom of speech , freedom of the press and the right of association in one bre@@ ath .
when the united states joined japan after world war ii , general dou@@ gl@@ as mac ar@@ th@@ ur and his staff encouraged the country to adopt a constitution that would allow it to ensure that the united states ’ milit@@ ari@@ zed auto@@ cr@@ acy was he@@ d@@ ged .
fully aware that workers and their trade unions are at the fore@@ front of the creation of a new japan , they used a language that explicitly stated that the japanese are not the rights of workers in unification and common understanding .
when the united states joined germany after world war ii , general d@@ wi@@ ght david e@@ is@@ en@@ ho@@ wer and his staff ur@@ ged the german@@ s to write a constitution that would ensure that fas@@ c@@ ism was ad@@ ol@@ f hit@@ ler ’ s .
recogn@@ ising that workers are wor@@ ried
agreements that restrict or restrict this right are not acceptable .
when the former first lady ele@@ an@@ or roo@@ se@@ vel@@ t was in the chair of the international commission on human rights , which was the subject of the universal declaration of human rights , as it was adopted by the united nations in 194@@ 8 as a worldwide agreement .
for generations , americans have accepted the basic pre@@ mise that labour rights are human rights .
when this country gave other countries a chance to make civil and democratic societies , it declared that it would not be possible to establish a union .
after these rights were crus@@ hed in america , it is indeed very wise to imagine the american ideal again .
as pa@@ st@@ or martin lu@@ ther king j@@ r. said fif@@ ty years ago , “ we are not alone in the world , but in europe . ”
history is a great teacher .
now everyone knows that the workers &apos; movement is not restric@@ ting the strength of the nation , but increasing it .
by raising living standards of millions of people , work has mir@@ ac@@ ul@@ ously created a market for industry and has put the whole nation on an un@@ imag@@ in@@ able level of production .
those who attack the work forget these simple tru@@ ths , but the story preser@@ ves them .
history re@@ members , and we should do so .
formal recognition of labour rights as human rights - and the extension of the protection of civil rights as a protection against discrimination in the creation of employee representatives - is long over@@ due .
ke@@ ith el@@ lis@@ on and john le@@ w@@ is are re@@ inv@@ enting the ide@@ als that america has made in the past , and that have delivered on the promise of democracy .
jud@@ ges tempor@@ arily stop law that all abor@@ tion clin@@ ics in lou@@ i@@ si@@ ana for closure will force them to close .
a us federal judge stopped the case on sunday for the time being in lou@@ i@@ si@@ ana , which was the case for lawyers saying that it would probably lead to the closure of all five abor@@ tion clin@@ ics in the state .
this measure , which was proposed by bo@@ b@@ by j@@ in@@ dal , govern@@ or of lou@@ i@@ si@@ ana , in june , and which was adopted on 1 september , is a measure that would benefit doctors who have abor@@ tions .
the judge &apos;s decision , however , means that doctors will continue to work legally for the time being , while they are exerc@@ ising such a right .
&quot; the pla@@ in@@ ti@@ ffs can continue to work in accordance with the law while they are trying to obtain these rights , &quot; wrote federal judge john de@@ gra@@ vel@@ les in his judgment .
within a month , a hearing will be held for the judge to decide on a lasting solution to the law .
those in favour of abor@@ tion welcomed the decision to take into account the latest in a series of jud@@ gments against similar measures , saying that doctors had wa@@ ited more time to get hospital ad@@ missions rights .
&quot; today &apos;s decision means that women in lou@@ i@@ si@@ ana are subjec@@ ted to a la@@ x law that depri@@ ves them of their health and rights , &quot; said n@@ ancy nor@@ th@@ up , president and chairman of the centre for re@@ productive rights ,
it was not immediately clear whether the judgment would affect doctors from the two clin@@ ics .
lou@@ i@@ si@@ ana is one of 11 countries that have adopted similar laws , with courts recently taking such measures in al@@ ab@@ ama and missi@@ ssi@@ pp@@ i for un@@ constitutional purposes .
key points of a law in tex@@ as that covers most of the remaining clin@@ ics in the state would have been closed by a federal judge on friday .
those who support abor@@ tion and the american college of o@@ stre@@ tr@@ ici@@ ans and gy@@ nec@@ o@@ logi@@ sts , as well as the american medical association , are saying , in common , that con@@ scri@@ ption rights for doctors are unnecessary .
oppon@@ ents of abor@@ tion say that the measures are not in line with the protection of women &apos;s health , although some also consider the effects of closing clin@@ ics .
only a doctor who has been de@@ tained in lou@@ i@@ si@@ ana has patients &apos; records .
if all other doctors in the state are forced to do no more abor@@ tion , this doctor would , out of fear for his safety , no longer carry out the operation , the group said .
in their argument against the judgment , representatives of the state of lou@@ i@@ si@@ ana said that they were not doctors for the conduct of abor@@ tions .
dela@@ yed diagno@@ sis and lack of access to the best treatment means that higher deaths occur as a result of e@@ gg@@ -@@ related cancer in rural areas .
angel@@ ina jo@@ lie and her brother james have a video ho@@ o@@ k-@@ face for her mother online , which was released in 2007 on e@@ gg@@ s .
for women in rural areas of australia , there is a greater risk of losing o@@ vari@@ an cancer , than for women in cities .
researchers analy@@ zed the medical data of more than 1@@ 100 austr@@ ali@@ ans , in which , in 2005 , o@@ vari@@ an cancer was detec@@ ted , and found that only 25 % of patients were diagno@@ sed .
the research director sus@@ an j@@ ord@@ an of the q@@ im@@ r ber@@ g@@ ho@@ fer medical research institute said that for those who live in rural and remote regions of the state , the problem of mort@@ ality is much higher during the study .
small study : new drugs could contain l@@ ung and eg@@ g ri@@ g cancer .
researchers studied the medical care of women over seven years .
dr j@@ ord@@ an said that the age of a woman in diagno@@ sis , the type of o@@ vari@@ an cancer , is the same as previous ill@@ nesses , as well as social and economic status , influenced the chan@@ ces of survival .
for older women and those whose cancer is the cause of further progress at diagno@@ sis time , the number of women who have died has been the lowest .
for those who live in rural and remote regions of the state , the mort@@ ality rate was around $ 3@@ 50 per year during the study .
although the study did not investigate why living people outside the city with a greater prob@@ ability of ov@@ aries cancer died , the study suggests that j@@ ord@@ an is a be@@ lated diagno@@ sis and lack of access to the best treatments .
&quot; this disease is best diagno@@ sed by gy@@ na@@ ecological on@@ co@@ log@@ ist , and they are usually found in larger cities , &quot; she said .
despite the improvement in tele@@ medicine services in order to counter di@@ stances , it proposed as a possible re@@ me@@ dy a strengthening of the service of inter@@ connected doctors , in order to enable specialists to work for women more closely with their place of residence .
dr j@@ ord@@ an said that the study would be a bad long-term study , regardless of geographical status , for women in the o@@ vari@@ an cancer , and under@@ lined the need for better treatment and prevention .
the “ global climate change ” strategy developed by rio t@@ into ride to con@@ qu@@ er can@@ cer is now published in the medical journal of australia .

garden centres regret falling house owners , which are not expected to pay enough attention to dec@@ lining house owners .
the decline , along with an increased fall in the number of home@@ owners under 35 years , could lead to garden centres losing tens of thousands of p@@ ounds per year if today ’ s young consumers are looking for a study by h@@ ta , as stated in the financial times .
the report states that ten@@ ants are expected to pay an average of 55 % of the amount paid to people with homes for their garden .
the rise in people living in highly ur@@ ban@@ ized areas without gardens is a popular problem .
in the greater london area , where over a period of six years , the share of home@@ owners has ris@@ en from 61 % to 43 % , the lowest expenditure on garden products per household is reported .
the h@@ ta and the royal hor@@ tic@@ ul@@ tural society have pointed out that the living is for rent or for small gardens not mean that the people do not want to pul@@ l plants .
gu@@ y bar@@ ter , head gar@@ d@@ ening consult@@ ant for the rh@@ s said : &quot; contain@@ er gar@@ den@@ ers are very popular with ten@@ ants , for example , because they bring their plants with them when they move . &quot;
the h@@ ta report identified the period from 1997 to 2005 as the &quot; golden age &quot; of the retail garden market due to rising house owners and economic prosperity .
he predic@@ ted that the next round of negotiations will be improved as a result of the better weather conditions following un@@ favourable weather conditions in march and april last year .

turkey orders us diplom@@ at for sp@@ ying reports .
the turkish foreign ministry has sent the most senior us diplom@@ ats to the country to provide information on a report on american and british sp@@ ying in turkey .
vice-president b@@ ü@@ l@@ ent said that the us emb@@ ass@@ y and turkish officials were not going to sign the report on monday .
the german magazine der spi@@ e@@ gel and the online magazine the inter@@ cep@@ t reported that the information provided by the former us analy@@ st of the national security agency , ed@@ ward snow@@ den , shows that the turkey is a major activity .
according to turkish news agencies , the turkish cy@@ pri@@ ot president rec@@ ep ta@@ y@@ y@@ ip er@@ do@@ gan played the role of the report and said that he would have to look at each other from all the major countries .

the first spring day with we@@ t and stor@@ my weather conditions affects flights from ade@@ la@@ ide airport to the airport .
spring has brought southern australia a winter surprise .
in the evening until 9 p.m. another 5@@ mm of rain fell on the city , after 6.@@ 6@@ mm , which was already visible on sunday in the night .
the last pre@@ cip@@ itation was the result of a series of short , stor@@ my sho@@ wers , including a cast that began just before 8 p.m. and was used for nearly 4@@ mm pre@@ cip@@ itation in about 10 minutes .
after the winter last week for an early do@@ se of spring had been provided , the temperature dro@@ pped in the city on monday .
the bad weather conditions are probably causing the be@@ lated lan@@ ding of a flight of vir@@ gin airlines from mel@@ bour@@ ne to ade@@ la@@ ide .
the plane should have been lan@@ ded shortly after 7.@@ 30 p.m. , but was driven by a win@@ ds - a su@@ dden change in wind speed or direction over a short distance - and had to start .
wind@@ sur@@ ges reached about 50 km / h at the ground at the airport ade@@ la@@ ide .
the flight data showed that the aircraft was still in service during a second lan@@ ding and was finally ready to fly at around 8.@@ 40 p.m.
the flight delay caused the delay in the execution of some other flights , including an em@@ i@@ rates flight from du@@ ba@@ i and a qu@@ an@@ ta flight .
for ade@@ la@@ ide , a maximum temperature of 16 ° c is predic@@ ted on tuesday , with possible sho@@ wers .
mat@@ th@@ ies says : it is high time for a big network of people to be net@@ worked together .
given the r@@ amp@@ ant technological progress that our concern about the future of our co@@ zy home in high-@@ tech power stations , we must not forget that the european union is a great help .
while i am writing this here , my view of the spir@@ al cable that connec@@ ts the list@@ en@@ er to the phone , and i think : bo@@ ah , how re@@ tr@@ o is that ?
but that is the reason@@ ing : if the cable is not , the cable will be available to all list@@ en@@ ers in the shor@@ test time , and that would be even more rescue than that .
in any case , the most important thing is the ec@@ kel@@ tr@@ onic ( ec@@ kel@@ tr@@ onic ?
no , ty@@ ping errors : electronic ) sector the rule that the world &apos;s nov@@ el@@ ty today is the electrical waste of tomorrow , bought - out@@ dated .
and anyone who still uses a tube tv in the living room today , for example , simply says that he is fundament@@ ally opposed to television .
why these considerations ?
because we are very concerned about the im@@ position of the i@@ fa at the radio tower this week of our absolute in@@ competence in matters of electronics .
the lay@@ man , who used to be a washing machine and cd player blin@@ dly , does not even understand the purpose of the equipment that is equipped with in@@ con@@ cei@@ vable le@@ th@@ al expert spre@@ ad@@ sheet before him : &quot; connected &quot; .
yes , is it still possible ?
what are we to talk about with people who seem to want to spread such quar@@ k volun@@ tar@@ ily ?
the fact is that for some 20 years now , the main thing has been that we have been able to network our house most pleas@@ antly .
to make the yo@@ gh@@ ur@@ t re@@ order itself so that the fire alarm can be sent to us on holiday in the mal@@ di@@ ves , that it is burning in the working room grade .
and would it not be wonderful if we could have air conditioning in our room soon ... ?
yes , however , this requires air conditioning .
but a dream will most certainly come true in the near future : we raise our watch , say her according to &quot; suc@@ king ! &quot; - and at home the vacu@@ um robo@@ t drives off .
wrong .
everything is going on nothing less than a revolution : &apos; the borders between white and brown bears are bl@@ ur@@ ring &apos; , r@@ ough@@ sho@@ d a branch of industry , you can see the washing machine with a head@@ phone .
we know from our daily practice that if a new fashi@@ on@@ able machine is really needed , then the ac@@ tu@@ ator is guaranteed to be empty .
another reason why this is not so good is that the spir@@ al cable on the phone will survive the next radio exhibitions .
israeli children are returning to gaza after the war .
thousands of israeli children from the areas near the gaza strip have been returning to israel on monday .
the school started with the ro@@ cket laun@@ ches in the united states , and the first two of them were the german and french communities .
in the southern city of ash@@ do@@ d , staff of the &quot; pas@@ ho@@ sh &quot; kin@@ der@@ gar@@ ten , who was hit by a missi@@ le , removed the child from the hospital before the pu@@ pil@@ s arrived .
&quot; we are a little afraid , but are ex@@ ci@@ ted , &quot; said ron@@ it b@@ art , a resid@@ ent of ki@@ b@@ but@@ z sa@@ ad and there an english teacher .
many children in our area are in need of a return to rout@@ ine .
her 1@@ 1-@@ year-@@ old daughter sh@@ ani b@@ art said that she felt &quot; a bit of com@@ ical &quot; about to suddenly find a way back to school .
&quot; these were difficult times , and we are not out of the house at all , &quot; she said .
president re@@ u@@ ven ri@@ v@@ lin visited the ki@@ b@@ but@@ z near the border with gaza to demonstrate his support .
until a ce@@ as@@ e-@@ fire bro@@ ke out last week , thousands of people in border communities such as sa@@ ad remained in their homes , or left their homes to live in sa@@ fer areas further away from gaza .
many na@@ h@@ al o@@ z residents , a municip@@ ality near the border with gaza , are in a 4-@@ year old boy who is being tor@@ tured by a palestinian mur@@ de@@ rer g@@ ren@@ ade .
the ministry of education announced that a do@@ zen or so families have not yet returned .
their children have been tempor@@ arily hou@@ sed in other schools .
prime minister ben@@ jam@@ in net@@ any@@ ah@@ u visited a school in s@@ der@@ ot , a border town with gaza that was se@@ ve@@ rely affected by palestinian fire .
he called on the children to learn a lot and said &apos; we will make sure that their knowledge is acquired and offer you security &apos; .
israel and hamas agreed last tuesday to negotiate a non-@@ free@@ ze peace treaty with israel .
the ce@@ as@@ e@@ fire brought an immediate end to the fighting ; important problems remain un@@ resolved , as the hamas demand for a lif@@ ting of the isra@@ eli@@ -@@ egyp@@ tian bloc@@ k@@ ade of gaza and the re@@ opening of air and sea ports .
israel is calling for hamas to be dis@@ armed and for the bodies of two to be handed over to the israeli soldiers who were killed during the fighting .
a new round of indirect talks is expected to take place in egypt this month .
in the war , more than 2,@@ 100 palestinians were killed , three quarters of them civili@@ ans , and at least 4@@ 94 children were killed , according to estimates by the palestinians and the un .
israel den@@ ies these claims and estimates that they are at least half of the killed .
on the israeli side , 66 soldiers and six civili@@ ans , including a th@@ ai work@@ er , were killed .
hamas and other figh@@ ters in gaza fi@@ red 4@@ ,@@ 5@@ 91 missi@@ les and mur@@ de@@ rers .
meanwhile , the israeli military led more than 5@@ ,000 air and other attacks by the country .
the israeli attacks damaged or destroyed thousands of homes in gaza , including the israeli army , and some 2@@ 50@@ ,000 people in more than 100 un schools , who were in temporary camps .
while tens of thousands of people still live in the protected areas and the fighting continues , the educational authorities are postpon@@ ing the beginning of the school year last week .
&quot; i hope the school is soon re@@ opened so that we can continue learning , as the children in the world and the jewish children , &quot; said mo@@ ham@@ ma@@ d am@@ ara , a 13@@ -@@ year-@@ old boy who was currently in school .
the hotel is situated in the centre of sa@@ x@@ ony , close to the main railway station and the main railway station .
given the n@@ p@@ d ’ s loss of votes in sa@@ x@@ ony , c@@ du federal vi@@ ze thomas stro@@ b@@ l has decided to end the current n@@ p@@ d prohibi@@ tion procedure before the federal constitutional court .
berlin - according to the c@@ du federal vi@@ ze thomas stro@@ b@@ l , the current prohibi@@ tion proceedings against the n@@ p@@ d should be brought to an end before the federal constitutional court .
&quot; the n@@ p@@ d is doing worse than last time , &quot; said stro@@ b@@ l , who also used c@@ du lan@@ ding gear in bad@@ en-@@ w@@ ür@@ t@@ tem@@ berg , who said &quot; le@@ ip@@ zi@@ g vol@@ k@@ s@@ ze@@ it@@ ung &quot; .
this is a welcome development in the right direction and a development that makes me more convinced that the commission is not going to be able to combat the n@@ p@@ d politically , nor is it going to go to the constitutional court .
the n@@ p@@ d was not in the middle of the fi@@ ve-@@ percent vote on sunday .
a first attempt to ban the extreme right party was in 2003 .
in december 2013 , the federal council , after long preparation , submitted a new application in kar@@ ls@@ ru@@ he .

har@@ burg : t@@ ents for new refugees
the new country is now being placed in t@@ ents .
the central initial reception for refugees in harb@@ burg is bur@@ sting out of all se@@ ams .
now the home office has three red cross t@@ ents next to it .
the local politicians were not informed until very recently - they are not very enthusi@@ astic .
&quot; these ha@@ ur@@ uck actions further fuel citizens ’ reservations and give the district politicians no opportunity to make constructive contributions to human rights in the region .
your party is calling for the district administration of harb@@ ur@@ g to provide un@@ used houses for accommodation at the moment .
96 refugees can be accommo@@ dated in the three t@@ ents .
reasons for over@@ filling in the initial picture are the rus@@ h of aid sur@@ pl@@ uses - and the re@@ alization that the aid authorities are not providing enough places in follow-up facilities .
many refugees therefore remain longer than the regular three months .
house prices have reached the highest winter rise in seven years , showing a widely observed record of a high level of growth .
the r@@ p data co@@ re@@ logic he@@ don@@ ic home value index for own home and office in the austr@@ ali@@ an capital increased by 1.@@ 1 percent in august , so the r@@ p data from monday .
this increase will mean that the overall increase will be in june , july and august at 4.@@ 2 % , the largest increase in the winter months since 2007 .
the annual increase in prices was 10.@@ 9 % , more than twice the increase in the number of new jobs in the 12 months until august 2013 , but the increases were not even@@ ly distributed across the country .
the research director of r@@ p data , ti@@ m law@@ less , announced that the sy@@ d@@ ney and mel@@ bour@@ ne had a two-@@ ti@@ er market .
the figures of r@@ p data show that house prices in syria are down by around 30 % last year .
the following markets are ade@@ la@@ ide , br@@ is@@ ban@@ e and dar@@ win , where prices are average around five and six percent .
at the other end of the scale lies can@@ ber@@ ra , which is affected by cuts in government spending , where prices are higher than the annual average , by only 1.@@ 4 % .
mr law@@ less said that the treaty of spring was about to be launched for the next few months , with an increase in sales of real estate , which would &quot; open up the market to a real test &quot; .
&quot; if you look at the constant high rate of au@@ ction prices , a generally fast selling rate and the increase in the price of the item , you will see that the price is likely to rise .
in an opinion to the new press , it contradic@@ ts statements made by the managing director pe@@ er med@@ au and att@@ aches &apos; as a fel@@ d@@ her@@ r &apos; to it .
the style of the university is not this , it is stated in the communication .
so the family med@@ au already &quot; mid-@@ june or@@ ally on the request of the university of applied sciences &quot; was informed .
the statement that the plans will not be announced until july is definitely wrong , &quot; he argu@@ es .
at the same time , it points out that the plans are not &apos; pre@@ defined or not decisions &apos; .
the car park , which is necessary for access , is also suitable for the development of the narrow road up to the castle , which is less dramatic than the med@@ ina fe@@ ared .
from a nine metr@@ e wide road has not been and is not being discussed .
as things stand at present , this is 5.@@ 50 metres wide , a metr@@ e wider than before , &quot; explains p@@ ö@@ tz@@ l .
the me@@ d@@ u operators &apos; argument that their free and scho@@ ol@@ ing parking spaces will only be used by students from the university in future is a good one .
there is no parking at all because , as with other public parking lots , this can be solved intellig@@ ently .
we are thinking of the residents of the area , and we are thinking of the residents of the area ,
the &quot; n@@ ann@@ y &quot; nur@@ ser@@ y , located on the premises and located on the front door , is the access to the parking dec@@ k , according to the university president , should not be affected .
rather , it points out that &apos; this is not just about the cr@@ è@@ che , but also about the people living near the mouth to the fried@@ rich@@ -@@ stre@@ ib@@ -@@ stra@@ ß@@ e and the 800 students of the ad@@ jac@@ ent real@@ sch@@ u@@ le .
so we are talking about much more than the ves@@ ted interests of mr med@@ au , &quot; says p@@ ö@@ tz@@ l .
whether paren@@ tal cri@@ ti@@ ques ’ advisory board of children ’ s cri@@ tics , with the expansion of the road would be one of the few places left behind co@@ burg , would be justified , &quot; the reader can decide for himself &quot; .
in early october p@@ ö@@ tz@@ l wants to build a new building in the city , together with the state building authority b@@ am@@ berg , &quot; and in this context to highlight the importance of the new development &quot; .
pe@@ er med@@ au had the parents of the children ’ s cri@@ b last week about the plans of the university .
the aim is therefore to facilitate access to the new parking dec@@ k via the camp@@ us and fried@@ rich@@ -@@ stre@@ ib@@ -@@ stra@@ ß@@ e , rather than via the me@@ d@@ us@@ -@@ berg .
this would have to close the narrow road to about one kil@@ ome@@ tre of two-@@ lan@@ e length .
according to the med@@ a estimates , traffic in the park of ho@@ hen@@ f@@ els would double by ten times .
from about 2000 vehicles a day is being discussed .
the city wanted to avoid being asked to comment on the project .
gl@@ and@@ or@@ f comes from hand@@ ball national team back .
hol@@ ger gl@@ and@@ or@@ f will no longer be available for the dh@@ b team .
the 3@@ 1-@@ year-@@ old s@@ g fl@@ ens@@ bur@@ g-@@ han@@ de@@ wi@@ t@@ t , a bun@@ des@@ lig@@ a , was the first to cause health problems for this decision .
i am not easy to make the decision , it has mat@@ ured for several months .
it is time for me to listen to the signals of my body and to start my career in the national team &quot; , said the president of the world cup from 2007 on his fac@@ e@@ book page .
it therefore takes stock of 16@@ 7 country games and 5@@ 76 goals for germany in the international ru@@ hr .
because the ro@@ ot@@ -@@ massive sp@@ ine player for the champi@@ ons league winner is from fl@@ ens@@ burg yet another few years on to@@ re@@ hun@@ ting .
the ic@@ el@@ and@@ ers , who had their cad@@ re for the national games against switzerland on tuesday , led g@@ land@@ or@@ f to a &quot; long and good con@@ vers@@ ation .
his ideas and approaches inspired me just as much as my long-@@ time co-@@ workers and my success@@ ors were .
but for my club i would like to be healthy in the coming years , for longer re@@ hab@@ ilitation plans are necessary .
the left hand@@ ler had to leave the country after a he@@ el inf@@ ection in 2012 .
due to ach@@ ill@@ ess problems he had moved from team doctors of the german hand@@ ball association ( d@@ h@@ b ) to a cor@@ ti@@ s@@ on-@@ injec@@ tion .
an emergency operation and two other interven@@ tions followed .
then g@@ land@@ or@@ f had fil@@ ed a compla@@ int against the team doctor , the dispute ended with a comparison .
twelve years of professional and ele@@ ven years of national team career are not tr@@ acked by any body .
i have some health sites that i can no longer ignore .
after the three inf@@ ec@@ tious foot operations that took place in 2012 in short inter@@ vals , i have my blood pressure never really been properly under control .
there are some other we@@ ar@@ -@@ related complaints .
already at the beginning of the year i noticed that i had to control my head , but i didn &apos;t dec@@ ei@@ ve my body , &quot; explained gl@@ and@@ or@@ f in the interview to the magazine &quot; hand@@ ball time &quot; .
for a com@@ e@@ back , it would only be available in absolute emergency .
&quot; if all the k@@ nit@@ ting is done , i am always ready to talk , &quot; said the two father of the family , to the magazine .
however , i cannot go back to the years in which i can still play hand@@ ball .
i must also say that after my long stay in hospital in 2012 i was also quite hum@@ ble , which affects my health .
after my career i would like to go at least some straight .
in addition to the world cup title 2007 and the champi@@ ons league 20@@ 14 prize , he won the 2008 h@@ s@@ g n@@ ord@@ hor@@ n and 2010 ( t@@ b@@ v le@@ m@@ go ) title at the e@@ h@@ f cup .
in 2012 , he also secured a new european position with fl@@ ens@@ burg .
german economy in spring by 0.@@ 2 % sh@@ run@@ k by 0.@@ 2 % .
the crises around the globe have hit the german economy in the second quarter .
gross domestic product fell by more than 50 % from april to june 20@@ 14 compared to the previous quarter .
this was shared by the federal statistical office and confirmed the results of the study .
consumption alone has sti@@ mu@@ lated the economy in the spring , while investment has fallen .
foreign trade also slow@@ ed the economy .
thanks to the strong start of the year , a total of eur 3@@ 50 million is ear@@ marked for the first six months compared with the second half of 2013 .
hor@@ st@@ mar was the starting point and the goal of the &quot; m@@ ün@@ ster@@ land@@ -@@ mo@@ o@@ i@@ ste &quot; , which was first mentioned by the bur@@ g@@ man@@ n@@ s@@ stadt on sunday .
the bur@@ g@@ man@@ n@@ stadt hor@@ st@@ mar experienced an inv@@ asion of dutch &quot; fic@@ tion &quot; ri@@ ders on sunday .
the biggest cycling association in the netherlands , n@@ t@@ f@@ u , organised the so-called &quot; m@@ ün@@ ster@@ lan@@ de mo@@ o@@ i@@ ste &quot; .
it is a matter of the largest cycle tour across the m@@ ün@@ ster@@ land , the cycling paradise of the region near the netherlands .
more than 1000 participants than@@ ked them with their registration at jo@@ s ter hu@@ er@@ ne for organiz@@ ing this tour through the m@@ ün@@ ster@@ land .
published in various trade journ@@ als this tour was offered to interested persons .
we are from the her@@ oes and we went over@@ night to take part in this tour .
we would also like to make m@@ ün@@ ster@@ land a closer acqu@@ a@@ int@@ ance with this kind of thing , &quot; the cy@@ cli@@ sts were delighted by the route through the cir@@ cles of ste@@ in@@ furt , bor@@ ken and co@@ es@@ fel@@ d .
after registration at the sch@@ ü@@ tz@@ en@@ bro@@ der@@ schaft sta .
k@@ ath@@ ar@@ ina went to a small &quot; peace trip &quot; through the city across the wall , where the start took place .
the route continued , which is suitable for three different categories , towards her@@ ren@@ hol@@ z , over the sch@@ ö@@ pp@@ inger mountain towards co@@ es@@ fel@@ d and via ha@@ vi@@ x@@ bec@@ k and b@@ ill@@ er@@ bec@@ k back to hor@@ st@@ mar .
on routes of 95 kilometres with 1@@ 17@@ 5 metres of al@@ titude , 120 kilometres with 14@@ 75 metres of al@@ titude and 14@@ 5 kilometres with 17@@ 75 metres of al@@ titude , cy@@ cli@@ sts proved their good condition .
they were taken away on the way in ha@@ vi@@ x@@ bec@@ k and b@@ ill@@ er@@ bec@@ k .
the main organiz@@ er jo@@ s ter hu@@ er@@ ne and may@@ or depu@@ ty he@@ in@@ z l@@ ö@@ l@@ fing were delighted with the success of this cycling event .
we are satisfied and it was a nice experience for all concerned .
the organization went without problems and there were no negative inci@@ dents &quot; , he dra@@ ws he@@ in@@ z l@@ ö@@ l@@ fing a positive conclusion of this event .
unfortunately , not as many participants as the organiz@@ er hoped , but this probably was due to the bad weather forec@@ asts .
&quot; we are facing a new challenge in 20@@ 15 , hopefully with nice weather on 30 august or during another weekend , &quot; said the cy@@ cli@@ sts still promising to return to m@@ ün@@ ster@@ land and the organis@@ ers are planning a new edition .
kon@@ stan@@ tin w@@ ec@@ ker ’ s un@@ rel@@ enting honest mem@@ o@@ irs of the mem@@ o@@ irs of the war in iraq are a sh@@ ame@@ ful and honest mem@@ o@@ irs of the people of the former yugoslavia .
it is actually more philosoph@@ ical testi@@ mony than bio@@ graphy , which con@@ stan@@ t@@ ine w@@ ec@@ ker , li@@ e@@ der@@ mach@@ er , paci@@ f@@ ist , politically secure acti@@ vis@@ t , ex@@ -@@ prison@@ er , in &quot; mon@@ k and war .
not chron@@ ological , but more thought fe@@ eds for mind and body .
and he is ru@@ th@@ less honest : from the on@@ ani@@ e as a gy@@ m@@ na@@ si@@ ast to the sho@@ p@@ lif@@ ting and drug use , he does not allow human weak@@ ness .
also , to show how he himself toler@@ ates tolerance in dealing with his fellow human beings .
the ab@@ str@@ act , but even more important terms are also taking on a wide scope : love , soul , e@@ go , being in the now , spirit@@ u@@ ality - all of which he tries to get to the bottom , in very personal , but also very philosoph@@ ical .
and he also explains his paci@@ f@@ ism , his social critique , his political commitment - and also , as he has shown not only the music ( opera lovers ) , but also the soul and rock music .
the latter has the li@@ be@@ man kon@@ stan@@ tin w@@ ec@@ ker also added to the as@@ ce@@ tic mon@@ k who was &quot; driven by sub@@ tr@@ action &quot; , as he says , &quot; by doing everything unnecessary . &quot;
between all the high-@@ min@@ ded views , there are also short an@@ ec@@ do@@ tes for the earth : about sle@@ eping cars in a g@@ is frequ@@ ented loo@@ p or a wa@@ hn@@ wi@@ z@@ ard car ride , where you can ride .
here too , he is bl@@ un@@ tly honest .
len@@ ny hen@@ ry : my father never let me down .
never said &quot; i love you &quot; , i love you , i love you , i love you , i love you , i love you , i love you , i love you !
hen@@ ry was one of seven children of a jam@@ a@@ ic@@ an family in du@@ d@@ ley in the mid@@ lands in 195@@ 8 .
his father , who died when hen@@ ry 19 , worked in a factory and her relationship was limited .
hen@@ ry is re@@ hear@@ sing for a com@@ edy , ru@@ dy &apos;s rare records , which is partly based on an imag@@ inary con@@ vers@@ ation with his father and is released from the series on radio 4 .
the sound@@ track is a mix@@ ture of reg@@ ga@@ e and ra@@ p , with lively me@@ lo@@ dies .
but hen@@ ry had to be replaced by some difficult child@@ hood moments .
he visited &quot; many &quot; therap@@ ies after the death of his mother , and hen@@ ry is thinking about his relationship with his father .
it was hard to know him .
you never saw your face , heard only his voice : &quot; listen to the cr@@ ash .
let your si@@ ster be calm .
o@@ be@@ y you !
i want to see cr@@ ick@@ et .
my older bro@@ thers se@@ y@@ m@@ our and hil@@ ton - who were already of age when i was a child - went to the k@@ nei@@ p@@ p with him and talked about things like the form of beer glass or the beauty of a cr@@ ick@@ et .
i have never had such a con@@ vers@@ ation with him .
for most of my life he was this serious type in the corner that read the newspaper .
recently , hen@@ ry opened a foun@@ dry in du@@ d@@ ley , and although the conditions are better than at the time of his father , he won an insight into how the life for him was .
it is now a little bri@@ ghter , but they are dark , smo@@ ked , deep stylish lab@@ y@@ r@@ in@@ ths with fl@@ ame bu@@ sts and smo@@ ke and much so@@ ot .
my father used to simply put himself in the bath and then he could hear him slowly sing , sing@@ ing .
when i ran around , i realized that i was going to have to do that for years to make food on the table .
nevertheless , hen@@ ry grew up as a child without love testi@@ mon@@ ies of his parents .
my father hu@@ gged me never , he never said &quot; i love you &quot; .
only when my mother was badly off towards the end of her life did we start to &quot; i love you , i love you , i love you &quot; to say .
through his own daughter , bil@@ lie , with da@@ wn french , he could share the love he had as a child .
could you ever be satisfied with the &quot; i love you &quot; ?
stop me and think about it !
dad , i am 22 !
with da@@ wn fren@@ ch .
why not be friends ?
it is a great mother .
it is still using french .
da@@ wn is a good person .
why not be friends ?
it is a great mother .
hen@@ ry &apos;s own mother was a di@@ abe@@ tic .
this contributed to their death .
so when i was very , very over@@ weight and had symp@@ t@@ oms of di@@ abe@@ tes , my doctor said , &quot; you must be radical .
so i pul@@ led this fitness through and also had to make a dr@@ astic di@@ et to re@@ vers@@ al the symp@@ t@@ oms .
it is very difficult .
and it is ex@@ hau@@ sting .
nobody li@@ kes to eat car@@ ro@@ ts .
hen@@ ry &apos;s career change may be reflected in his elegant , short cut b@@ art .
since he was cri@@ tici@@ zed for his o@@ th@@ ell@@ o , the government has been dis@@ ban@@ ded from the theatre .
the com@@ edy of the mis@@ concep@@ tions followed , and then f@@ ences of august wil@@ son .
that is a different experience from the sit@@ com@@ s and com@@ edy that his business life has been through .
he started with only 16 years when he was working in a factory .
a d@@ j discovered him on stage when he was im@@ it@@ ating and writing people to new faces about him .
his television career began in the mid-@@ 197@@ 0s . &quot; i was in the middle of the only black irish television station for a long time .
he learned at work .
i had to face up to the public , but also to the public from 197@@ 5 to 198@@ 5 , how i could create an efficient wit@@ z-@@ nar@@ ra@@ tive machine while i was watching television a star that was not .
len@@ ny 197@@ 5 at new faces
since his manager has passed the stage law at the black and white min@@ stre@@ l show , he has been a light entertainment program that has been the focus of the people &quot; black an@@ al@@ ge@@ sic &quot; , hen@@ ry led his com@@ edy .
the hotel is very clean and the staff are very friendly .
i some@@ how wish it never happened , but i am sorry that i did not see it .
it was a strange , un@@ pleasant position for me , but i worked on giant projects with and learned to work on the way to communicate with a large audience .
but this &apos; years of awar@@ d-@@ winning light pillar of british television has been a source of &apos; gross in@@ justice &apos; .
the introduction of figures that make up the british black culture both mo@@ cking and fe@@ ar@@ ful has led hen@@ ry to work in the 198@@ 0s on an alternative com@@ edy circle .
the first series of len@@ ny hen@@ ry show was broad@@ cast in 198@@ 4 , and in the 199@@ 0s he was among other things known as the ch@@ ef gare@@ th black@@ lock in the co@@ smo@@ politan series ch@@ ef !
advertising , docum@@ ent@@ aries , tv series and film roles have shaped his next decade , but after his br@@ on@@ ze series len@@ ny@@ hen@@ ry@@ .@@ tv 2008 dav@@ is thought to be : &quot; what is you doing next ?
after that , a docum@@ entary series for radio 4 was released entitled what &apos;s so great about ... ?
the first episode was about sha@@ kes@@ pe@@ are .
on sha@@ kes@@ pe@@ are i was really aller@@ gic .
i never had a real idea at school and i never learned anything about him , and i thought it was a medium class domain , a white one in ti@@ ghts and a coal head .
so i was very afraid of it .
all of us who inter@@ viewed for the show , peter hall , tre@@ v@@ or n@@ un@@ n , adri@@ an les@@ ter , jud@@ i den@@ ch said &quot; you should pro@@ long it .
do not make it bad if you do not know what you are talking about .
take a few words into your mouth , and then you &apos;ll understand what you &apos;re doing , why we all sha@@ kes@@ pe@@ are so .
hen@@ ry led 20 lines out of o@@ th@@ ell@@ o ’ s last speech for the docum@@ entary film and he was thr@@ illed .
i had the feeling that i was able to do that .
it was almost as if someone had finally got my head up properly .
&quot; that is what it is about , it is a serious thing , take them seriously , learn your text , search a bit .
the sam@@ ples were brut@@ al , and i read this piece for months before we did it .
and it was a success .
they seemed to have expected a car accident , and that simply did not happen .
and soon he appeared in the com@@ edy of errors .
suddenly i was in the national theatre and i could hardly believe it .
there was a moment when i thought , &quot; o@@ h , you have changed . &quot;
there was a technical error and hen@@ ry felt inst@@ inc@@ tively that he had to enter@@ tain the audience .
&quot; a small voice told me &quot; you have to bridge 10 minutes while you are on the computer . &quot;
instead , the stage director announced that the idea was moving forward , as soon as the problem was resolved .
i went from the stage and something in me said &quot; o@@ h , god be than@@ k@@ ful &quot; .
i am not responsible for that .
i can leave that to someone else .
&quot; you play in a play , so stay in your role . &quot;
hen@@ ry in f@@ ences on du@@ ch@@ ess theatre
the text for f@@ ences was challenging .
pan@@ ic is very good , it strength@@ ens the year@@ nings .
that , too , was good , so it is like a great shi@@ eld of the go@@ ds who tell me &quot; this is your purpose . &quot;
he says so , of course , with a th@@ under@@ ing voice .
so i will stick to that .
i really love that .
i love to be in a sample room .
but hen@@ ry still has the head of a com@@ edi@@ an - our con@@ vers@@ ation is full of hum@@ or@@ ous er@@ up@@ tions while he im@@ it@@ ates people time and again .
i have decided not to create stand@@ -up com@@ edy , because i think that the commission &apos;s proposal for an immediate satisfaction of this kind is a place full of str@@ ang@@ ers .
if we are looking for it , we are going to face a wall .
i sometimes get into the apo@@ llo live when i want to do it , but overall there is not so much i can do .
i ask him whether he has ever seen a stand@@ -up com@@ edy tour again .
the fun i had in a room with a director was a great help to create a beginning , a middle part and the end of a journey - i think not that i am the one i have ever wanted to give up .
is this , then , his new inc@@ ar@@ nation ?
i think so .
i am a actor .
it is fun .
you always tell a story , and that is great .
i love stories .
people love stories .

according to the online edition of the newspaper &quot; y@@ em@@ en post &quot; , hu@@ th leader ab@@ dul@@ m@@ ali@@ k al-@@ hu@@ th@@ i had a meeting on sunday evening to take the measures .

ken@@ ya regi@@ sters officials to &quot; fight g@@ host workers &quot; , and the government has been able to prevent the use of &apos; g@@ host workers &apos; .
ken@@ ya has begun to send all state officials bi@@ ome@@ tric , in order to prevent &apos; g@@ host employees &apos; from paying sal@@ aries for the government .
employees who are in the process of not regi@@ stering in the next two weeks would no longer be paid for a government communication .
the government susp@@ ects that thousands of people will be de@@ ported from the public service even after they leave .
president u@@ hur@@ u ken@@ y@@ att@@ a promised to make a commitment to eradic@@ ate public service corruption when he took office in 2013 .
in an examination earlier this year it was found that at least $ 1 million ( £ 7@@ 00@@ ,000 ) per month in payments for &quot; g@@ host employees &quot; and other ab@@ uses of the financial practices were lost .
the government susp@@ ects that sal@@ aries will continue to be paid on accounts after a person has died .
all officials must now be able to work in identification centres for the next two weeks to ensure that their data on bi@@ ome@@ tric regi@@ stra@@ tions is included in a government message .
all those who do not want to do this without a credible apo@@ logy would be removed from the pay list , read the communication further .
&quot; this approach makes a significant contribution to ra@@ tion@@ alising public services by reducing the actual number of officials and also by reducing sal@@ ary lists on both government levels .
the scand@@ al surrounding art advis@@ er hel@@ ge ach@@ en@@ bach will be brought to court for the first time on 11 november .
five he@@ irs of ber@@ th@@ old al@@ bre@@ cht , son of al@@ di founder the@@ o al@@ bre@@ cht , are demanding a new trial in a civil trial at the d@@ üs@@ sel@@ dorf district court of germany , with eur 19@@ .@@ 4 million in compensation .
that was what a court spo@@ kes@@ man said on monday .
in the action , it says that ach@@ en@@ bach had a right to a fair deal with the purchase of works of art and v@@ int@@ age cars and that ber@@ th@@ old al@@ bre@@ cht calculated the purchase prices paid .
this also meant that the agreed commission was higher .
ach@@ en@@ bach has spent eur 12@@ 1 million valu@@ ables on al@@ bre@@ cht .

he was a scho@@ ol@@ -@@ teacher , 23 of whom were school leaders .
from this time , man@@ f@@ red rich@@ ter knows many pe@@ ter@@ sha@@ us@@ en@@ er and k@@ ol@@ l@@ b@@ ach@@ er from their time as a student .
his methods were sometimes un@@ conventional , but always supported by his desire to find a way to see people in the pu@@ p@@ il .
the snow@@ k@@ op@@ pe is the most famous mountain of the giant mountains .
man@@ f@@ red rich@@ ter lo@@ ves the painting with the mo@@ ti@@ f from his home .
judge was born in tr@@ aut@@ en@@ au / northern bo@@ hem@@ ia in 19@@ 30 , today tr@@ ut@@ no@@ v .
already with 14 he was interested after four years of secondary school for the profes@@ sion of teachers .
one year later , the su@@ de@@ ten german@@ s were ex@@ propri@@ ated .
within half an hour , the family had to leave their homes .
after a few months in one camp , the situation went back to bav@@ aria in 194@@ 6 - in the freight wag@@ on .
so jud@@ ges went to the upper fran@@ con@@ ian valley village .
teacher training took place in b@@ am@@ berg .
man@@ f@@ red rich@@ ter had to pay six times a week to go to the ne@@ arest railway station , drive by train to b@@ am@@ berg , walk three kilometres across the city and go back to school in the evening .
after two months man@@ f@@ red rich@@ ter got in a red cross home in b@@ am@@ berg a sle@@ eping opportunity : together with up to 15 students in a dor@@ mit@@ ory .
in 195@@ 1 , he made the first and in 195@@ 4 , after three years of le@@ h@@ ram@@ t@@ s-@@ asp@@ ir@@ ant , he became the second state ex@@ am .
since ob@@ er@@ fran@@ ken is not a free teacher , he applied for a place in upper bav@@ aria and joined the university of ber@@ lin@@ . he joined the school in k@@ ol@@ l@@ bach on november 1 , 195@@ 4 .
the &quot; m@@ ä@@ u@@ le@@ in room &quot; was his first &quot; service flat &quot; in the school .
in 195@@ 8 , he moved to the new teacher &apos;s house next to the school and moved to a three-@@ room servic@@ e-@@ flat .
this house bought man@@ f@@ red rich@@ ter in 1980 , after the school in k@@ ol@@ l@@ bach had been dis@@ solved in 196@@ 8 .
until then , there were no such cases in k@@ ol@@ l@@ bach at the school association pe@@ ter@@ sha@@ us@@ en-@@ k@@ ol@@ l@@ bach and in pe@@ ter@@ sha@@ us@@ en five .
from the school year 196@@ 8 / 69 , these were acquired in pe@@ ter@@ sha@@ us@@ en in the present town hall .
when the school association was founded , the school was left with only the primary school in the town .
to avoid a down@@ grade in the now smaller school , the school changed its name to the former rec@@ tor geor@@ g si@@ g@@ l .
but pe@@ ter@@ sha@@ us@@ en grew , and so the children and their teachers were able to follow the building today , which was moved to jud@@ ges ’ reti@@ rement in 1997 .
man@@ f@@ red rich@@ ter comm@@ ends the un@@ complicated gener@@ os@@ ity of the then may@@ or lu@@ d@@ wi@@ g g@@ ö@@ tz , who has also created a workshop at community costs and a cel@@ lar room for expansion in 1997 , although this is still the case according to the court .
&quot; may@@ or g@@ ö@@ tz was very scho@@ ol@@ -@@ friendly , &quot; jud@@ ges re@@ mem@@ bered .
throughout his career , man@@ f@@ red rich@@ ter has never heard a speech from a government representative who was waiting for a department of a school council on justice and law : &quot; you cannot never forget the love &quot; .
&quot; you have to give your children two things : roots and w@@ ings , &quot; says the 8@@ 4-@@ year-@@ old .
and he had to know : &quot; that &apos;s not always possible &quot; , whether he only has his students or his own six children , is not quite clear .
in any case , jud@@ ges were sometimes un@@ conventional .
if students check , they were given no information about the criminal proceedings and were not sent@@ enced to sit down .
at the expense of the municip@@ ality , judge had created two pair of box glo@@ ves and left the two con@@ tra@@ sts against each other , even if there was a ve@@ il .
for the good of the school , jud@@ ges as rec@@ tor maintained a good relationship with the then may@@ or lu@@ d@@ wi@@ g g@@ ö@@ tz ( c@@ su ) .
he moved the par@@ tis@@ an judge after his reti@@ rement to at least be the last on the c@@ su list for the municip@@ al council in 1996 .
but jud@@ ges were chosen for place six and joined the c@@ su .

hr@@ 4-@@ cycle tour 700 bi@@ kers will take part in the spa park in bad salz@@ haus@@ en and sch@@ ot@@ ten sto@@ po@@ vers .
if cy@@ cli@@ sts want to experience the best of the world on their tour in bad salz@@ haus@@ en or sch@@ ot@@ t , that is nothing special in itself .
on friday , however , the number of re@@ sting people alone made the impression that the 700 participants of the hr@@ 4 cycle tour and accompan@@ ying tro@@ ss enjoyed a break in the lower spa park of bad salz@@ haus@@ en and later a party in the open sky .
under the mo@@ tto &quot; cycling and celebr@@ ating on newly discovered paths between ni@@ d@@ da and kin@@ zi@@ g &quot; , participants in bad vil@@ bel had met on thursday and had a concert of van ba@@ ker &amp; band .
on friday it became serious : the cy@@ cli@@ sts took the first stage , which cros@@ sed 60 kilometres over fl@@ or@@ stadt to bad salz@@ haus@@ en and further to scotland .

for body and mind refres@@ h@@ ment , there was a lot of good things prepared : the rural women of ran@@ stadt and ni@@ e@@ der@@ -@@ mo@@ ck@@ stadt had 85 sheets of apple , pe@@ ar , stre@@ tch and pe@@ ar .
&quot; such ca@@ kes can only ba@@ ke women in rural areas , &quot; p@@ raised a particip@@ ant from a@@ ul@@ en@@ di@@ e@@ bach while or@@ dering another piece .
the tur@@ n@@ vere@@ in ge@@ i@@ ß@@ -@@ ni@@ d@@ da be@@ verage was used to bring cold refres@@ h@@ ments .
the du@@ o bra@@ vo was a great place to meet the audience with famous o@@ pe@@ re@@ tt@@ as and musi@@ c@@ als and enjoyed the enthusi@@ astic applause .
the beautiful ambi@@ ence of the park was relaxing .
a gentle@@ man also enjoyed a head massage from his partner : &quot; he deserves that , after all he has already dro@@ pped off today bicycle cha@@ ins again .
meanwhile , the may@@ or and the manager of the company had to work : they were put on the well in front of the drinking cu@@ be of re@@ porter ra@@ iner jan@@ ke and used the opportunity to work on the radio for bad salz@@ kam@@ mer@@ gu@@ t .
also the head of promotion to@@ bi@@ as h@@ agen , since the first hr@@ 4 cycle tour 2004 as tour manager , could only briefly snow@@ ed , he had a lot of fun with the technology on site .
his pic@@ k@@ up tr@@ uck , in which he was brought to the scene by three tele@@ phones and a radio device with his employees and the 15 member of the group of the police , h@@ ess@@ en , was fac@@ e@@ book entries .
&quot; the majority of participants come from the r@@ hin@@ e-@@ main region , &quot; he told , &quot; but also from gi@@ e@@ ß@@ en or ful@@ da , from lau@@ ter@@ bach or the ta@@ un@@ us and even from numerous cities in western fl@@ es@@ h .
the number of participants is a bit according to the available accommodation capacities .
in category i , participants are accommo@@ dated in hotels , in category ii in class accommodation .
the town was the ideal place for cy@@ cli@@ sts to get to know the area again after a day and a half : &quot; bu@@ ll ! &quot;
&quot; it was beautiful in bad salz@@ haus@@ en ! &quot; they w@@ av@@ ed for a f@@ are@@ well .
after arriving in scotland , the group was allowed to make a short break .
but in the evening the cy@@ cli@@ sts were in the id@@ yl@@ lic al@@ te@@ bur@@ g@@ park .
the scot@@ tish national team of tourism and urban marketing ( g@@ ts ) has been working on a nice fe@@ st@@ am@@ bi@@ ente and , of course , you have had some delicious dishes , such as fl@@ ame ca@@ kes with well cool@@ ed white spring water .

the three were obviously delighted with the &quot; many factory in scotland &quot; .
d@@ j to@@ bi@@ as h@@ agen then gave the dance stage free .
the opportunity to move freely and swi@@ m in the open air has been created despite the sport@@ y activity on the bicycle .
among the guests , there were increasingly citizens who were impres@@ sed by the good mo@@ od as well as the large number of cy@@ cli@@ sts .
on the second day , the cy@@ cli@@ sts were able to visit bir@@ stein , w@@ ach@@ ter@@ s@@ bach and bad or@@ b stations , including a concert with the tren@@ k@@ wal@@ der@@ n .
yesterday , after 18@@ 0 kilometres of cycling , the athle@@ tes met again in bad vil@@ bel .
do@@ z@@ ens of turkish polic@@ em@@ en for &apos; con@@ spir@@ acy &apos; against the government have been arrested and sent@@ enced to death .
a total of 33 police officers were arrested in turkey because of the susp@@ ici@@ on of &apos; con@@ spir@@ acy against the government &apos; , and local media agencies report .
the police authorities did not make any direct comments .
among those arrested , 14 senior police officers were senior members , and hur@@ ric@@ ane mit@@ ch reported that the number of prisoners was increasing .
some of them were involved in the corruption investigations against government officials , including four government ministers last december .
in july , a number of turkish polic@@ em@@ en were arrested for sup@@ pos@@ ed@@ ly commit@@ ting an organised criminal association and calling numbers to pick up .
turkish president rec@@ ep ta@@ y@@ y@@ ip has said that he is not a member of the european parliament .
not all children in ukraine return to school .
schools in almost every part of ukraine opened their doors on monday ( september 1st ) after the summer holidays .
this day is tradi@@ tionally an important day for families , and like thousands of other ukra@@ inian parents , prime minister ar@@ sen@@ i@@ j jaz@@ en@@ ju@@ k brought his daughter to school .
there he informed waiting journalists that not all schools are re@@ opened , that he had decided to go ahead with the country for future generations :
the september celebra@@ tions were not held in every school .
the sky is not always peaceful over ukraine .
we must work for a peaceful sky .
the whole of ukraine , a huge common ukra@@ inian people &apos;s front , must fight for a peaceful sky .
ale@@ k@@ san pa@@ stu@@ k@@ how , school director at the sla@@ v@@ jan@@ sk school , who was ja@@ z@@ en@@ ju@@ k &apos;s daughter , spoke in russian .
we hope that peace will finally re@@ ign here and that the children will receive an education that will be useful to them in their lives .
the first day of school of the new school year is tradi@@ tionally celebrated , with children em@@ bro@@ ide@@ red shir@@ ts , bal@@ lo@@ ons in their hands and their teachers being given flowers .
with ron@@ a fair@@ head , the bb@@ c has perhaps made the great director you need .
it is hit@@ ting the world with a proud li@@ fel@@ ine from the banking world , media management and the inner circle of the tory party .
and it has its own fron@@ tal experience .
her career began with the worldwide management consult@@ ancy ba@@ in and co . , which she was proud of when she was appointed to mor@@ gan stan@@ ley , bom@@ ba@@ di@@ er , ic@@ i and the media world of pe@@ ar@@ s@@ ons .
it has been the chairman of the board of directors of the financial times for seven years and re@@ signed when the parent company pe@@ ar@@ s@@ ons was transferred to a younger male colleague .
their compensation was sup@@ pos@@ ed@@ ly nearly £ 1 million .
their political ran@@ king is also sound .
she was born david camer@@ on by lord brown , former chairman of b@@ p , when he was asked for more priv@@ ate@@ -@@ sector knowledge in wh@@ ite@@ hall .
her hus@@ band is a former tory council member .
in may , i described the role of the chairman with a po@@ is@@ oned kel@@ ch .
not only is the bb@@ c a huge and complex entity in the heart of public life , but there is also an internal par@@ ado@@ x in its structure .
confidence works in two directions : in@@ ward on the first guard of its own management hier@@ arch@@ y in the bb@@ c , but also ou@@ tw@@ ar@@ dly as a voice of public concern and dis@@ quiet when things go wrong .
this provides an almost un@@ ten@@ able du@@ o@@ po@@ ly that , after a complete comprehensive reform , requires .
but which new in@@ coming president would risk being att@@ acked if he were to resort to everything and to pick up an institution that is as complex as a chinese dy@@ na@@ sty while he is doing himself perhaps to be his job .
it is a difficult task .
and as if that were not enough , many are also interested in making the bb@@ c smaller .
while the competition is getting closer and new technologies are opening up new , comfortable col@@ lateral threats , the forthcoming negotiations on the licen@@ sing fees for the bb@@ c are facing particular risks .
the modest sum of eur 14@@ 5.@@ 50 per year will be paid by the british public for what is certainly the largest media company in the world .
the bb@@ c tells a good story : it says that it is 96 % of house@@ holds and that each of them has only 40 p@@ ence per day .
and it seems that the bb@@ c is rising on the popul@@ arity scale again .
the visual and usage hab@@ its for the bb@@ c have changed : i get a lot of news head@@ lines today on my mobile phone and see how it works .
but it remains a very be@@ loved and no@@ ble institution .
it needs a considerable chairman - i hope she has found it .
per@@ ry from tex@@ as says that down@@ gr@@ ading t@@ we@@ et is not authorized .
a t@@ we@@ t from the official account of the republic@@ an govern@@ or of tex@@ as , ric@@ k per@@ ry , on sunday included a her@@ al@@ ding s@@ cor@@ n re@@ mark about the democratic district prosecu@@ tor , who was central to the district prosecu@@ tor .
the t@@ we@@ et was later deleted and replaced by another of per@@ ry &apos;s user account , which over@@ ri@@ des the previous termin@@ ation .
a t@@ we@@ et has just been sent from my account , which is not authorized by me .
&quot; i approve the t@@ we@@ et not and i have deleted it , &quot; said it in the later news .
employees of per@@ ry did not respond immediately to requests for comments .
although the t@@ wee@@ ts of per@@ ry &apos;s official user account were running , it was not clear who actually would have served the feed .
in the former t@@ we@@ et an un@@ advant@@ ageous image of the district citizen prosecu@@ tor was created by trav@@ is county , ro@@ sem@@ ary le@@ h@@ m@@ berg .
per@@ ry put a ve@@ to on financial support for her office when she refused to give her re@@ sign@@ ation , which led to an indic@@ tment of per@@ ry - who may have presidential election in 20@@ 16 .
the text of the t@@ wee@@ ts reads : &quot; i don &apos;t always dr@@ un@@ k with the tri@@ ple permitted alcohol level ... but if i do it , i am not compla@@ ining g@@ ou@@ ver@@ ne@@ ur per@@ ry , if he is .
i am the most dr@@ un@@ k democr@@ at in tex@@ as .
le@@ h@@ berg ’ s office was not in charge of the investigation of the grand jury against per@@ ry .
this was done by michael mc@@ cr@@ um , a special prosecu@@ tor from san ant@@ oni@@ o , who was arrested by a republic@@ an judge .
per@@ ry argu@@ es in un@@ guil@@ ty and called the charge a political tri@@ gger .
his first-@@ class team of legal advis@@ ors applied for a patent in the case of the judge responsible for the case .
per@@ ry stopped 7.@@ 5 million $ government money to the public integrity bank .
this ve@@ to provided public sanc@@ tion on the part of a lef@@ t-@@ wing wat@@ ch@@ dog group .
per@@ ry &apos;s official user account is frequently updated - and sometimes famous .
after winning the election meetings in i@@ ow@@ a during his presidential term , he was elected president of the republic in 2012 , per@@ ry went to spec@@ ulation .
ber@@ ke@@ ley explains housing market again for &quot; normal &quot; , but it is not the same as the real home market .
one of the most prominent buil@@ ders in london pointed out that the construction sector in the united kingdom was in the south-@@ east of england again at normal levels .
homes in the capital were hot sou@@ gh@@ t-@@ after and subject to enormous price increases , which made the bank of england much more vulnerable to the widespread fear of l@@ ending bu@@ b@@ ble .
ton@@ y pi@@ d@@ g@@ ley , founder and ceo of the top-@@ class construction company ber@@ ke@@ ley said on monday : &quot; since the beginning of the current financial year , the market has returned to normal transaction levels .
the housing market in london was the biggest in the down@@ turn , as foreign bu@@ yers entered the capital .
according to the information of the cat@@ a@@ sters , the prices in the city area alone last year have jum@@ ped by 18@@ .@@ 5 % , far more than the average rise in england and wal@@ es as a whole .
the average selling prices at ber@@ ke@@ ley ’ s private , cheap , and student offers rose by about one-@@ fifth in the past year , and reached around the 4@@ 23@@ ,000 £ end of april .
a stronger p@@ ound , however , has lost property in london for foreign bu@@ yers in recent months - some of them are also affected by the introduction of new housing taxes and political rhe@@ tor@@ ic about a possible “ vill@@ ag@@ e-@@ tax ” .
london ’ s real estate agent fo@@ x@@ ton war@@ ned in the past week that the hy@@ ster@@ ia market report for april , in which sch@@ ä@@ fer ’ s credit l@@ ending rules were introduced , would be in the second half of the year .
new data from the bank of england of monday show a decline in mort@@ gage approval in july , which also indicates that the euro is in decline .
h@@ amp@@ tions international , another real estate agency , correc@@ ted his predic@@ tion of the rise in housing prices in london for 20@@ 15 to 3 % , on the basis of a already weak@@ er market .
the volume of transactions in the most expensive areas of london , such as ch@@ el@@ sea , may@@ fair and ken@@ sing@@ ton , has increased year after year by a quarter , according to the bro@@ ker wa ell@@ is .
however , the desire for home in the capital is not a good idea for ber@@ ke@@ ley , as the su@@ ms due for sales on dates are limited to more than $ 2.@@ 2 billion .
mr pi@@ d@@ g@@ ley added : &apos; the demand for the right well-@@ planned product to the best sites in b@@ j@@ ör@@ n remained stable and as a result , the sales of the dates have also remained stable . &apos;
in june , the company reported that it had created 3,@@ 7@@ 42 new homes in the year until the end of april - nearly a third more than the 2007 peak before the crisis .
the annual pre-@@ tax income rose by 40 % ann@@ ually to € 2@@ 80 million , while sales rose by 18 % to £ 1.@@ 6 billion .
in a communication on monday before the company &apos;s annual general meeting , mr pi@@ d@@ g@@ ley said that the income for ber@@ ke@@ ley is expected to exceed the current market expectations this year .
analy@@ sts agree that annual growth in the value of pre-@@ tax assets is 4@@ 50 million £ .
ber@@ ke@@ ley shares were in the london stock exchange in the afternoon , at £ 2@@ 3.@@ 96 .
nu@@ de photos from j@@ enni@@ fer law@@ rence by h@@ ack@@ ers published on the internet on h@@ ack@@ er on the internet .

nu@@ de photos of the o@@ sc@@ ar prize winner j@@ enni@@ fer law@@ rence were online by a h@@ ack@@ er who was alleg@@ ed to have &quot; mas@@ tered a list &quot; of images of another 100 star@@ lets .
a representative of the star from &quot; the tribute of pan@@ em &quot; confirmed that the first photos of la@@ v@@ ren@@ ce e@@ rec@@ ted were real and compla@@ ined to the h@@ ack@@ er for &quot; bl@@ at@@ ant violation of privacy &quot; .
the authorities have been notified and will follow all those who have not read the sto@@ len photos of j@@ enni@@ fer law@@ rence .
the photos originally published on the photo@@ -@@ sharing page 4@@ ch@@ an are now available in the public domain .
it is not certain how many of the images are real , although win@@ ste@@ ad , star from &quot; scot@@ t pil@@ gri@@ m against the rest of the world &quot; on t@@ wit@@ ter also condemned the h@@ ack .

occa@@ sion@@ ally a woman told him that he was too serious , too ti@@ ring , intensive , di@@ stan@@ ced and perhaps a little scr@@ at@@ ch brus@@ hed .
and sha@@ ke him the hand .
scr@@ at@@ ch brus@@ h he knew .
he was st@@ ic@@ ked , as in i@@ gel , yes .
the last victim of this sec@@ ul@@ ar@@ ism was a recent aff@@ air , which gave more hope for a relief to the lon@@ ely lan@@ g@@ eling of his life than it was otherwise , and perhaps even a certain satisfaction to him .
a@@ il@@ in sol@@ om@@ on was a trem@@ bling ten@@ der beauty with un@@ t@@ amed hair and a fla@@ vor@@ ful heart from a village on the nor@@ th@@ island , which was even covered .
she was accompanied by an older compan@@ ion to the south , who had to hold ke@@ ver@@ n for her a@@ un@@ t , and which had a p@@ lot in a dam@@ p but paradise valley with the ap@@ t name paradise valley .
for several years , no one had lived in the house .
the pi@@ pes were le@@ ak , in the bathrooms were still sp@@ id@@ ers , nu@@ de t@@ wi@@ gs had their trac@@ es on all windows left behind and believed they belong@@ ed to them all , and the garden was filled with we@@ t cr@@ um@@ bs .
it was like the house from a children &apos;s fair@@ y tal@@ e , both threat@@ ening and temp@@ ting , a garden full of secre@@ ts .

ke@@ ver@@ n had deal@@ ings with ail@@ in on the broken pi@@ pe with the deal@@ er in the high gr@@ ass and had a very un@@ usually warm spring afternoon .
your feet are too big .
due to their own aggres@@ si@@ veness , songs of this kind were no longer played on the con@@ sole .
not for@@ bi@@ dden - nothing was really for@@ bi@@ dden - simply not played .
it has been successfully ob@@ sole@@ te , as the word ob@@ sole@@ te .
the general taste created what en@@ ligh@@ ten@@ ed and prescri@@ p@@ tive regulations would never have done , and how people could use the v@@ om tell@@ rec@@ h@@ er-@@ z@@ um@@ -@@ mil@@ li@@ on@@ air@@ e mem@@ o@@ irs , cook@@ books and love nov@@ els .
in the eu@@ ph@@ oria of the day , ke@@ ver@@ n began to create an imag@@ inary piano and to play in a gro@@ b-@@ com@@ ic se@@ ren@@ ade ail@@ in &apos;s big feet .
in the end , the two were the ones who were the first to be able to make a living .
&quot; this was a well-known song of a jazz pi@@ an@@ ist called f@@ ats w@@ all@@ er , &quot; he explained to her and automatically put two fing@@ ers on his li@@ ps .
his father had always done that to write the letter j , before he had left his mouth .
it had been a game between him and his father when he was still small .
his father had it played with his own father , so he had told .
if you want to start a word with an j without two fing@@ ers over your li@@ ps , it costs you a pen@@ ny .
there was no very fun@@ ny game at that time , and it was not very fun@@ ny even now .
he knew that this was what he was expected to do .
it had to explain what jazz was .
al@@ in@@ n had never heard of any .
jazz was also used , even if it was not directly prohibited .
impro@@ vis@@ ation was no longer modern .
the room was very small and the bathroom was very small .
people wanted to be in the beginning of a me@@ lo@@ dy quite sure where it would end .
the mind is the same .
its un@@ predic@@ tability made people ner@@ vous .
and jazz was musi@@ cally expressed ver@@ bal .
although he was 10 years old without being taken over by sam@@ my dav@@ is junior , he knew that he was a little bit of jazz from the half secret jazz collection of old c@@ ds of his father .
but at least he had to explain ail@@ in that f@@ ats w@@ all@@ er was black .
she was probably unable to remember a time when she was old , when pop sing@@ ers were not black .
again , no laws or constra@@ ints were applied .
a con@@ form society meant that every element of this society was than@@ k@@ fully subject to the principle of group gi@@ fts - than@@ k@@ fully as the ones spa@@ red by fate .
people with a@@ fro@@ -@@ caribbean origin@@ s were dis@@ advant@@ aged by temper@@ ament and body building for entertainment and sport , so san@@ g and ran@@ ged them .
people who were originally excluded from the indian sub-@@ continent were treated like nature with electronic tal@@ ents .
what is left of the polish community is not the only concern for the se@@ wer system ; what has been left of the gre@@ e@@ ks has been sm@@ ash@@ ed .
those from the gulf states and the lev@@ ante , whose grand@@ parents did not leave the country quickly than what had happened , were the ones who were forced to leave for fear of hum@@ id@@ ity .
everyone according to their skills .
since it only heard b@@ all@@ ads , it fell hard for a@@ il@@ inn to understand how the insul@@ ting words that were ke@@ ver@@ n &apos;s just reading her .
music was an expression of love .
&quot; they are not really off@@ ensive , &quot; said ke@@ ver@@ n .
except perhaps for people whose feet are too big .
my father never off@@ ended anyone , but he loved this song .
he talked too much , but the negl@@ ected garden gave him the dec@@ ep@@ tive feeling of security .
nothing could have prevented the sound insul@@ ation of the huge co@@ al-@@ like leaves .
in the early 19@@ 20@@ s , the company was the only company to have been able to offer its services to the public .
why would your father have loved such a thing ?
he wanted to say that it was a ju@@ x , but hesit@@ ated to live in their presence again two fing@@ ers on the li@@ ps .
she thought she had already been doing something strange , anyway .
&quot; it seemed fun@@ ny to him , &quot; he said instead .
she sha@@ ke dis@@ belief and was dis@@ ban@@ ding her head .
there were no other options to see around the world than to see their un@@ comb@@ ated r@@ ab@@ en@@ sch@@ war@@ z hair .
there was nothing else he would have wanted to see .
&quot; if you say it , &quot; do you mean it without convic@@ tion .
but that does not explain why you want to read it .
she seemed hon@@ est@@ ly concerned .
are my feet too big ?
he looked again .
your feet so directly not .
maybe your an@@ k@@ le , a little bit ...
and tho@@ u sa@@ y@@ est tho@@ u h@@ ate me because my an@@ k@@ les are too th@@ ick ?
h@@ ate the@@ e ?
of course i do not h@@ ate you .
that is just the st@@ up@@ id song .
he could have said &quot; i love you &quot; , but it was too early for that .
&quot; your th@@ ick an@@ k@@ les are the reason why you like me .
i am a bit per@@ verse .
it did not sound right .
it had to be fun@@ ny .
if he tried to be fun@@ ny , he brought himself often in trouble because he was like his father not to be reas@@ su@@ red by the so@@ o@@ thing charm that one needed to keep the voice of the jo@@ kes in@@ he@@ rent .
perhaps his father also wanted to be cru@@ el .
perhaps he wanted to make his own .
despite his kind eyes .
a@@ il@@ in sol@@ om@@ on was red and raised in the mouth of her rec@@ um@@ b@@ ent chair , thre@@ w the con@@ sole and dis@@ gu@@ ised the wine , the wine she had dr@@ un@@ k .
hol@@ low wine , so dr@@ un@@ ken@@ ness was no exc@@ use for him .
in their ex@@ ci@@ tement , they seemed to trem@@ ble , as pal@@ m@@ we@@ del in stor@@ m .
&quot; and your th@@ ick head is precisely why i am per@@ verse to the@@ e .
besides that i am not at all .
she did him suffering , both because of the unnecessary us@@ e@@ ful@@ ness of his words and the fear that was mani@@ fest in her eyes when she re@@ bel@@ led against him .
did she think he would beat her ?
she had not told him about the life on the cold northern archi@@ pel@@ ago where she was grown up , but he had no doubt that she was born in the middle of the cold .
the same giant and ic@@ e-@@ cold ocean bro@@ ke here as there on the shore .
the same conf@@ used men , with even th@@ ick@@ er skin and dis@@ gu@@ ised after the things that had happened than their pre@@ dec@@ ess@@ ors were s@@ mu@@ gg@@ lers and beach rob@@ bers , moved from pub@@ s to pub@@ s .
th@@ ick head ?
they would have given her a big f@@ ist if she had not prepared !
she first cr@@ un@@ ches - cr@@ un@@ ch was the most commonly used word for a ero@@ tic an@@ ch@@ or .
ke@@ ver@@ n said that this was an unnecessary re@@ fin@@ ement , because the cr@@ un@@ ch itself had already been an act of violence .
a@@ il@@ in sol@@ om@@ on gave him a sign through her body .
he ar@@ ose from the dec@@ k-@@ chair like an old man .
she also felt ble@@ aching , but the strength of his m@@ our@@ ning surprised her .
that was not the end of the world .
they hardly knew each other .
she wat@@ ched him as he di@@ stan@@ ced himself - as from a room on the upper floor her compan@@ ion looked at him - a man who compla@@ ins about something he himself has done .
ad@@ am leaves the garden , she thought .
she felt a su@@ dden pain for him and men in general , although some had their hands raised against them .
a man turned away from her , his back pra@@ yed , ash@@ amed , se@@ aled , without fighting , and he was not a man of sight , but a man of good knowledge .
when she was alone again , a@@ il@@ in looked at the world of sol@@ om@@ on .
several years before the stories of the past , es@@ me nu@@ ß@@ bau@@ m worked , an intelligent and enthusi@@ astic way of working for 32 years in the name of of@@ no@@ w , the non-@@ legislative director of the european parliament .
&quot; a lot has already been done and much remains to be done , &quot; she wrote , &quot; to the in@@ n@@ ate aggres@@ si@@ veness of a people that has won a thousand wars and most of them won , especially in the remote regions .
but some properties are pro@@ vo@@ ked by the in@@ ability to eradic@@ ate them .
the higher the church tower , it seems , the lower the passion for the church to continue to awa@@ ken .
the people cr@@ y when they hear s@@ enti@@ mental b@@ all@@ ads , they hear stories of over@@ w@@ ound difficulties and claim that they are firmly committed to the virtu@@ es of marriage and family life , but still does not keep only the former .
&quot; they have an unfortunate tend@@ ency to ex@@ ag@@ ger@@ ate , &quot; said their ment@@ or when he was reading the whole report .
i propose that they should have fewer nov@@ els .
es@@ me nu@@ ß@@ bau@@ m low@@ ers her head .
i must also ask whether they are a@@ the@@ ist ?
&quot; i think i don &apos;t have to say that , &quot; answered es@@ me nu@@ t tree .
are you les@@ bian ?
again es@@ me reported on her right to privacy and refused to grant the statement .
fem@@ in@@ ist ?
silence again .
&quot; i don &apos;t ask this , &quot; said lu@@ ther r@@ ab@@ in@@ o@@ wit@@ z , &quot; because i am against a@@ the@@ ism , les@@ b@@ ent@@ um or fem@@ in@@ ism .
this is an pre@@ jud@@ ice free job .
we are pre@@ ju@@ dic@@ ed by a society .
but certain types of hyper@@ sensi@@ tivity , which in itself are absolutely acceptable and comm@@ end@@ able , can sometimes produce results , as they have been presented , which are not acceptable .
you yourself have obviously expressed pre@@ jud@@ ices against the church , and these things that you call &apos; dis@@ cour@@ aging &apos; and &apos; ro@@ h &apos; could be used by others as an expression of naturally strength and vit@@ ality .
if you continue on the road , what has happened , if it happened , as if it were the case , it would have happened yesterday , it means that the country has lost its essential vit@@ ality .
es@@ me wal@@ nu@@ t looked around while r@@ ab@@ in@@ o@@ wit@@ z spoke .
behind his head , a le@@ d-@@ fon@@ t repeated in fl@@ am@@ ing@@ or@@ os@@ a the advice that of@@ now gave the country in the last quarter of a century or longer .
sm@@ ile your neighb@@ or , value your partner , listen to bal@@ la@@ d , visit music shops , do not use your phone , talk to you , explain what you hear .
speaking is better than silence , the sing@@ ing word is better than the written , but nothing is better than love .
&quot; i understand perfectly what you want to go down , &quot; es@@ me rep@@ lied n@@ us@@ s@@ bau@@ m with a quiet voice than she was sure that her superior would finish speaking , &quot; and i say nothing else , but that we are going to .
my concern is that we are going to have to help out with the situation without warning , as we are repe@@ ating the mistakes that led to what happened when it happened .
this time , however , it is not the others that we should share our an@@ ger and di@@ str@@ ust .
lu@@ ther r@@ ab@@ in@@ o@@ wit@@ z shaped a py@@ ram@@ id with his hands .
to avoid an an@@ gel pati@@ ence , i would like to ask you to take a look at the following .
&quot; they go too far , &quot; he said , &quot; if they see actions as &quot; mistakes &quot; that our grand@@ parents may or may not have committed .
they also go too far when they say that they have their &quot; an@@ ger &quot; and their &quot; mi@@ str@@ ust &quot; on &quot; other &quot; .
it should not be necessary to give someone in their position the idea that we are not too far behind in understanding the past and protecting the present , not from &apos; us &apos; and &apos; others &apos; .
there was no &quot; we &quot; and there was no &quot; other &quot; .
it was a time of dis@@ order , that is all we know .
&quot; of which , if we are honest with ourselves , &quot; es@@ me d@@ ared to throw in , &quot; no part of society can claim to have beha@@ ved well .
i do not compla@@ in to anyone .
whether it is bad or well done , what has happened has happened .
that was then .
there is nothing more to say about this - we are agreed on that .
and just as no blame must be assigned , no blame must be paid .
but what is the past for if we do not learn from it - and i am not saying this - from the past , and i am not learning from it - from it - from the past , and i am not the same as the present , but the future , i am not the present , the future , the future , the future , the present , the present , the future , the european parliament , the european union , the european parliament , the european parliament , the european parliament , the european
the past serves to forget them .
if i may say something about this , i would like to make a few comments .
lu@@ ther r@@ ab@@ in@@ o@@ wit@@ z left his py@@ ram@@ id collapse .
&quot; i will consider your report , &quot; he said and dis@@ missed it .
the next day , when they arrived at work as usual , she was taken by a motor@@ cy@@ c@@ list who , as pas@@ ser@@ s-@@ by described , was in a kind of &quot; brut@@ al r@@ age &quot; on the foot@@ path .
by chance .
les@@ o@@ th@@ o military member says that no cou@@ p is planned ; prime minister remains in south africa , and prime minister remains in south africa .
military officials in les@@ o@@ th@@ o were argu@@ ing that a cou@@ p would lead to the over@@ throw of the government , and said that they would be against polic@@ em@@ en who were denied the armed forces of political fan@@ a@@ tics .
prime minister thomas th@@ ab@@ ane f@@ led the country and announced that the army of the country had re@@ located to power and had moved government buildings in the capital mas@@ er@@ u .
the premier brought his family to the ad@@ jac@@ ent south africa after being att@@ acked by ass@@ ass@@ ination threats .
maj@@ or n@@ t@@ l@@ é@@ le n@@ to@@ i , military spo@@ kes@@ man , said that there was no de fac@@ to cou@@ p d &apos;@@ é@@ t@@ at , but that the military was prepared to respond to the threat of &quot; political fan@@ a@@ tics &quot; .
&quot; what happened this morning was that the staff of defence forces of les@@ o@@ th@@ o acted after he had several intelligence reports received .
the south african government spo@@ kes@@ man cla@@ y@@ son mon@@ ye@@ la said that military action has given the impression of a up@@ heav@@ al .
&quot; even though no one has claimed that the government has been tor@@ n by violence , all reports are agreed that the activities of the defence forces of les@@ o@@ th@@ o have so far shown signs of a cou@@ p , &quot; he said .
military spo@@ kes@@ men for les@@ o@@ th@@ o shared with him on sunday that the soldiers had been drag@@ ged back into their bar@@ r@@ acks and the situation in the capital was calm .
in the meantime , the vice premier mo@@ the@@ t@@ jo@@ ya met@@ sing takes over the leadership of th@@ ab@@ an@@ es absence .
th@@ ab@@ ane announced that he believes he was arrested for his attempt to use corruption in the country .
in les@@ o@@ th@@ o , there has been great tension since june , after th@@ ab@@ ane parliamentary meetings had been held due to the disputes in his unity government .
he said that his actions would not have under@@ min@@ ed the government , that there were different acc@@ us@@ ations .
production in the euro zone on a 13@@ -@@ month low in the euro area , at a 13@@ -@@ month low in the eurozone , is the lowest in the world , and the lowest in the eurozone .
the increase in output in the eurozone slow@@ ed down in august to the lowest point in the last 13 months , such a closely observed increase in the number of cases .
the final tag purchasing management index of the producer of the trade ( p@@ mi ) fell in august to 5@@ 0.@@ 7 in which the price of the product was 5@@ 1.@@ 8 in july .
a 50 speci@@ fies an expansion .
new orders were reduced and fac@@ tories collap@@ sed in a time of rising ten@@ sions between the eu and russia over ukraine .
the figures are very clear before the european central bank ( ecb ) meeting on thursday .
the markets expect the bank to draw up a clear plan for dealing with a re@@ luc@@ t@@ ant eurozone recovery and the im@@ pending de@@ fl@@ ation of inflation at a mere 0.@@ 3 % .
there is spec@@ ulation that the leader of the ecb , mari@@ o drag@@ hi , will be in the course of this week to provide further information as to whether he is proposing quanti@@ tative eas@@ ing for the eurozone , in line with that of the united states and the united kingdom .
&quot; although a small growth is better than no growth , the bra@@ king effects of the increasing economic and geo@@ political un@@ certain@@ ties on manufacturers are more apparent than any growth , &quot; said ro@@ b do@@ b@@ son , senior econom@@ ist at mark@@ it .
the factory p@@ mi for germany , the largest trading partner of russia in the eu , fell to the lowest level in 11 months with 5@@ 1.@@ 4 .
meanwhile , the us government has fallen by more than 50 % in the second largest economy of the blo@@ c , france , the p@@ mi .
france remains a problem child , as does italy ’ s decline from a solid expansion of the stag@@ nation of the world .
evidence that stimul@@ us for growth is key to the economy ’ s success in germany , spain and the netherlands , is not good either .
the decline in industry is likely to fuel the analy@@ sts ’ fire , which will cause further monetary or fiscal stimul@@ us .
one positive news came from the republic of ireland , where the p@@ mi rose to 5@@ 7.@@ 3 , the highest level since the end of 1999 .
ho@@ ward ar@@ cher , chief econom@@ ist at i@@ h@@ s global insi@@ ghts , said : &quot; the best thing you can do for the purchasing management index of the manufacturing company is to use the euro area from august .
he added : &quot; producers in the euro area are obviously finding life quite difficult at the moment , as the current increased geo@@ political ten@@ sions - especially with regard to russia and ukraine - have caused uncertainty in the continuing difficult conditions in many countries .
these increased un@@ certain@@ ties clearly have affected the economy - especially , and confidence among consumers , and are likely to lead to some emerging market delays .
he said that &apos; it is becoming increasingly likely &apos; that the ecb will eventually become a type of q@@ e , &apos; although we susp@@ ect that it will be limited &apos; .
the hel@@ lish decade of the bes@@ lan survi@@ v@@ ors : ten years have passed since the terrible sie@@ ge of the school , as the de@@ tain@@ e@@ es ’ children still suffer .
ten years ago , more than 1@@ ,000 people were killed by chec@@ hen mil@@ i@@ ti@@ as in a school in bes@@ lan in southern russia .
more than 3@@ 30 people , more than half of them children , were killed in the three-@@ day mar@@ ty@@ r@@ dom that the world sho@@ c@@ ked , killed .
we are back to bes@@ lan to see some of the victims , who have been subjec@@ ted to death at the hor@@ ror in the class@@ room .
exactly a decade after the app@@ alling sie@@ ge of the school of bes@@ lan , where 3@@ 34 people died , including 18@@ 6 children , war@@ ned the her@@ o@@ ic survi@@ v@@ ors of last night that a new apo@@ c@@ aly@@ pse would be found .
as a fan@@ a@@ tical islam@@ ist terrorist , children and parents on 1 september 2004 , the beginning of a new school year , were cap@@ tured and killed , as the evil one seemed .
the tragedy united west and east in ab@@ hor@@ rence , and transformed the world into a new world , surpris@@ ingly , in action and hope for the future , in the mid@@ st of the worst mis@@ ery .
ten years later , we have returned to bes@@ lan to meet some of the victims who have died in the green@@ peace ab@@ om@@ ination in the class@@ room .
we found surprising young people who resi@@ sted resistance , although the memory of these terrorists was not enough to make them fore@@ ver .
their greatest hope ?
the fact that the war that ukraine is now experiencing - and in which children like them die - is now coming to an end .
the girl who was photograph@@ ed at the attempt to get into the broken school sports hall was forced to leave the school .
it was created by the russian star photograph@@ er di@@ mit@@ ri beli@@ ak@@ ov and famous for being a little bit more like a child in her under@@ wear .
totally conf@@ used , a@@ id@@ a sought her mother lar@@ is@@ sa , now 40 years old .
both were deemed dead , but they survi@@ ved .
&quot; a woman told me i was supposed to run for my life , but i could not , &quot; said a@@ id@@ a back then .
my leg@@ s were floo@@ ded .
i stood up and clim@@ bed back to the top of my mother .
a soldi@@ er brought them safe@@ ly .
after a series of operations , she felt completely heal@@ ed , but said yesterday : &quot; three months ago , the pain returned .
i fear that i will be operated again .
some sh@@ ards of p@@ ome@@ gran@@ ate are still in my k@@ ne@@ es .
their aim is now to become a d@@ enti@@ st to help people who are suffering from the disease , as they have been helped by doctors .
&quot; this tragedy changed my life , but it did not break me , &quot; says it k@@ amp@@ flu@@ ti@@ g .
&quot; this happened to me , and that cannot be changed .
once a year i always go to the sports hall to get used to the people who stayed there .
my friends and i try not to talk about it on other days .
pain is too great .
my best friend and future class@@ m@@ ate d@@ zer@@ a g@@ apo@@ ev@@ a was there .
we played together when we were small , and dre@@ amed that we would go to school together .
&quot; i don &apos;t want to mar@@ ry until i finish my studies and start my career .
i am thinking of a family later .
it says that the sie@@ ge always forms part of it , although the memory each year is slightly weak@@ er .
i am glad that many people around the world are still remin@@ ding themselves of our hor@@ r@@ ors and we are so grateful for the help we receive from people in britain and everywhere .
when i take the photo online from me , how i go back to school , i think that many people will see it for the first time , understand our disaster and help us to get something like this out of the ordinary .
the boy who was killed by the ball h@@ ag@@ le , in the opinion that his mother was dead , was a man who was killed .
it was his first school day ( rus@@ sians go to school at the age of 7 ) and survi@@ ved the three-@@ day sie@@ ge in his mother &apos;s poor tam@@ ara .
as a se@@ ven@@ -@@ year-@@ old he said , &apos; m@@ ama told me i should lie down when there is an explo@@ sion , and her hand should hold . &apos;
after an explo@@ sion , he thought she would die .
she said to him : &apos; run . &apos;
fe@@ ar@@ ful that they could be dead , he f@@ led and saw a we@@ eping inf@@ ant on the way , took it by hand and f@@ led through a bul@@ let .
his father v@@ la@@ di@@ mir , who had sent his son outside the castle , said : &quot; dam@@ ir told me that his mother died .
he said : &apos; i could not save them &apos; .
in fact , tam@@ ara was st@@ um@@ b@@ led outside and was bur@@ ied in the hospital with le@@ g in@@ jur@@ ies , in turn assum@@ ing that her son had died .
after her re@@ unification she said : &quot; i we@@ pt with joy .
i could not believe it .
he ran in and embr@@ ac@@ ed me .
dam@@ ir was later fle@@ w to london ( from the now dis@@ solved newspaper news of the world ) to travel from the then premier ton@@ y bla@@ ir and his wife ch@@ eri@@ e to a bar@@ nar@@ do &apos;s ch@@ ile .
&quot; this hor@@ ror ha@@ un@@ ts you every day , but i wish i could stop re@@ member@@ ing , &quot; he said yesterday .
but i can say that in my memory it is pal@@ at@@ able .
i still know that i will be able to test all my to@@ y gun immediately afterwards .
but now i can play computer games with shot scenes and that is not a problem for me .
&quot; i am not afraid to go to the sports hall , but i do not think about myself .
i remember these children , with whom i had been playing in the cour@@ ty@@ ard , and who did not manage to get out .
we never say they have been killed or killed .
we say that you will be staying in the sports hall .
i remember very well my trip to london , especially the games store in which i visited the city .
but now he is afraid of place like ukraine , where wars are the kind of accident that he and his friends have suffered .
this hor@@ ror is watching you every day , but i wish i could stop being remin@@ ded .
&quot; i am so sorry for all those who suffer from the ab@@ om@@ inations , &quot; dam@@ ir said , who died last week as a volunte@@ er in a monaster@@ y .
i am happy to help .
i want to go to the police one day and i hope that you will take me to the training academy next year .
his mother , tam@@ ara , 48 , said : &quot; 37 children from our neighbor@@ hood were killed , they can imagine ?
i remember the terrible sti@@ ll@@ ness that followed the sie@@ ge , there was simply no children who gave cr@@ y and run around , and these silence took us many months to get .
it is vi@@ vi@@ dly remin@@ is@@ cent of her trip to london with dam@@ ir .
the people of london we@@ pt when i told our history .
i understood then how people on the other side of the world understand our feel@@ ings , and their support shows .
she was ch@@ eri@@ e bla@@ ir and her foundation grateful for the prize and the opportunity to travel to london in autumn 2004 .
i wish i could give ch@@ eri@@ e a call and tell her that 10 years have passed since , but i always remember her .
i remember the time when i was so f@@ ond of eating bor@@ sch@@ ch and i wanted to visit all the local russian restaurants .
i remember how he was with wa@@ it@@ ers in a restaurant , dam@@ ir shot with his water pi@@ st@@ ol on her and she ran a way and played a game with him .
and that was only a month after the hor@@ ror .
i was surprised that the british were so willing to share our pain and to support us .
she said : &apos; i always think that this world has not been better in these 10 years .
in ukraine , the war is now continuing , and people are dying every day , and i believe that many children have been killed and still have to be killed .
these are just children like ours .
i think that for many of the war is part of the news they hear when they get bo@@ red or with something else .
i simply know what these people feel , the whole hor@@ ror .
and i cannot stop saying that .
nothing has changed , people still want to mu@@ zz@@ le each other , and that is so sad .
dam@@ ir became big and is a very gent@@ le and quiet boy , he is not aggres@@ sive or deser@@ ted at all .
for example , he is not looking for reven@@ ge , he is not overwhel@@ med by the past hor@@ r@@ ors .
i know he does not like to remember that , but he has six close friends from the class and they occa@@ sion@@ ally go to the sports hall and ign@@ ite there cer@@ ts .
when he was smaller , he suffered - i remember , as he was sometimes on the so@@ fa@@ -@@ bed , the face of us turned away , hours of work .
not sle@@ eping , his eyes were open .
i remember , too , how he used all his weapons and other military to@@ ys to go on , and dam@@ ir is now 17 , greater than i am , go@@ o@@ d-@@ looking , intelligent and healthy .
i can hardly believe that i have been so sure for a few hours that he was dead and i never would see him again .
when i was reco@@ vering after the explo@@ sion and getting on my feet , i looked around and saw the hel@@ l around me , with all sor@@ ts of bodies around me .
i was absolutely sure that my little boy was impossible to survive in this hel@@ l .
&quot; i remember that i listened to him , &quot; d@@ am@@ ir , lau@@ f , run away &quot; , but i was also so sure that he did not hear me .
but he has heard it and he has gone away .
and so life goes , unlike that of many others , for us .
geor@@ gi@@ j il@@ y@@ in , 17
the boy , whose terrible image was revealed after the sie@@ ge to be the symbol of the ab@@ om@@ ination of bes@@ lan , was the symbol of the hor@@ ror of bes@@ lan .
con@@ sol@@ ation : the bes@@ lan survi@@ v@@ or geor@@ gi@@ j ly@@ in with his mother fa@@ tim@@ a after the sie@@ ge of 2004 , to the right a picture of geor@@ gi@@ j today on the right a picture of geor@@ gi@@ j a picture of geor@@ gi@@ j today .
his bloo@@ d-@@ blo@@ wn face was drawn by fear when he was fighting for his life , while chec@@ hn@@ ya terrorists were killing his class com@@ r@@ ades .
his image was one of the most sho@@ cking symb@@ ols of the bar@@ bar@@ ism of bes@@ lan .
his mother fa@@ tim@@ a , 54 , a doctor , had named him for his first day of school before she left los rus@@ hed to leave her older son v@@ la@@ di@@ mir to university .
&quot; i left the farm about two minutes before the terrorists over@@ thre@@ w him , and so the rest of my little boy was there for three terrible days , &quot; she re@@ members .
not quite alone , there was a whole family of rela@@ tives of us , but they were all killed .
only my geor@@ gi@@ j managed to survive .
the closer this date approaches , the more difficult it is to remember and to talk about it .
there is not a single day when we cannot remember this tragedy .
we do not think it was long ago , i think it would have happened yesterday , some scenes from these days are still watching me .
no one will ever forget that , i promise you .
the picture of geor@@ gian president george ( left ) was one of the most sho@@ cking of the attack and was seen as a stat@@ ue ( right ) e@@ ter@@ nal .
i remember that geor@@ gi@@ j was there on that day so happy to go to school , he said he wanted to re@@ arm his teacher .
i knew that he was alive and that he was not here on television .
and now there is even this stat@@ ue of the we@@ eping geor@@ gi@@ j in san mar@@ ino .
geor@@ gi@@ j doesn &apos;t like the picture and it is at home in our book shel@@ f .
i understand that , but i also think that people around the world , thanks to this image , feel our pain .
geor@@ gi@@ j says today : &quot; it is important not to repeat this .
&quot; i doubt that we will ever know the truth .
people are investig@@ ating such trag@@ e@@ dies over and over again and never know the truth .
and now you are investig@@ ating the cr@@ ash of this bo@@ eing in ukraine .
will we ever know what caused it ?
this world will become something terrible .
&quot; i cannot understand how this is possible , because if you ask people , nobody wants to win a war , so how is that happening ?
ten years is not the end of such pain .
we need do@@ z@@ ens of years to make it a little forgotten .
it has affected my health and i always feel it .
about three or four years ago i had a few night@@ ma@@ res because of the sie@@ ge , but then it became better .
i went back to school later in 2004 and was afraid every day .
i thought about my friends and class@@ mates who were killed and who were killed .
that is why i always go to the sports hall when the 1st of september is appro@@ aching .
i want to use my old friends to pay tribute .
it is difficult for me to go to the sports hall , but i must do it .
i do not feel a victim , this story is now part of my past .
i will not forget it , but i am not sorry .
my life goes on .
i have finished school this year and i have visited a medical college in v@@ la@@ di@@ ka@@ w@@ ka@@ z .
i will be heart sur@@ ge@@ on .
my first choice was to train in the army .
i wanted to become a soldi@@ er , but my health didn &apos;t allow it .
i wanted to fight for my country , but that will not happen .
geor@@ gi@@ j f@@ ani@@ ye@@ v , 20 years ago , 20 years ago , the first of 20 years of the world &apos;s leading manufacturers of the f@@ ani@@ ye@@ v , 20 years ago , 20 years ago , the company was founded in the usa .
the boy who survi@@ ved , although he was at the foot of a mur@@ der@@ ous terrorist , was a man who was a victim of a mur@@ der@@ ous terrorist attack .
a mir@@ acle : geor@@ gi@@ j f@@ ani@@ ye@@ v was too f@@ ond of a mur@@ de@@ rer during the sie@@ ge , but he did not manage to make his survival .
during the sie@@ ge , he was held in the sports hall and sat next to the bom@@ b that was at the foot of a mur@@ der@@ ous terrorist .
it is a real mir@@ acle that he has not been killed .
&quot; we feel it was yesterday that the first thing we heard was &quot; geor@@ gi@@ j , who was the secret service officer of the f@@ s@@ b , but he was not doing so because of his health damage caused by the sie@@ ge .
it is still with me , it is not something i left behind .
i am now older and people say that children can easily be brought to gri@@ ef by bad experiences - i have to say that is not true .
&quot; in 2006 i worked with psycho@@ logi@@ sts and after that i really felt a little better , but i can not forget .
and i would like to forget .
2005 - the year after - was the first and only time i had returned to the sports hall .
i lost consci@@ ousness .
i will never go back there again and ask me not to tell you what is going on in this famous image .
survi@@ v@@ ors : geor@@ gi@@ j f@@ ani@@ ye@@ v today , with a photo of himself in the hospital after the sie@@ ge on the lap@@ top on the lap@@ top .
my pain is immen@@ se and i wear it every day with me .
my friends know that i do not like to think about it or talk about it , and they never asked me about it .
physi@@ cally i am doing well .
i should be careful with my in@@ ju@@ red k@@ ne@@ e , but i can run well now .
but because of my health i could not attend the secret service academy of the f@@ s@@ b in saint pe@@ ter@@ sburg , as i wanted .
i have my documents , including the medical papers and you have rep@@ lied that it is not possible .
my second passion was the animals , so i went to the veter@@ inary institute .
i have been there for two years .
he lear@@ ns the treatment of all animals &quot; from c@@ ats to co@@ ws &quot; .
he said : &apos; i knew i had to never tell my children about my experiences .
children should not know about this and they should not suffer from it , of course .
his mother marina , 42 , said : &quot; this pain never leaves me .
he is in my soul , worse if the anniversary is appro@@ aching .
i will be present at the comm@@ em@@ or@@ ation cere@@ mon@@ ies .
i know that geor@@ gi@@ j will not go .
it is still a lot more violent for him , because he was there and i was not .
i wa@@ ited at home for him and could not help .
i am so grateful to god that he has been returned to me , and here in bes@@ lan , everyone is drawn .
it remains in us .
geor@@ gi@@ j is now an adult , but this hor@@ ror is still in him .
it is difficult to accept that if something is as unfair as it is , then it is not .
he is a boy , he li@@ kes sport , but he cannot participate because of his k@@ ne@@ es .
he has been operated several times , he can run but he can &apos;t do any sport .
i would say that he has to put the hor@@ ror over 50 % , but it is never entirely possible to overcome it and forget it .
this terrible experience will always be with us .
many friends and neighbours were killed in the sie@@ ge and this only rein@@ forces my pain .
i have lost many people i knew well and who are dear to me .
my son is with me , and that is the greatest gift that god could make me , but my heart cr@@ ying for the killed .
i know of families where new children were born , but also of wi@@ do@@ ws who never had to be married again .
it is difficult to accept that life will continue , even if you do not want it .
i will never forget how my heart jum@@ ped in me when i saw him in hospital .
and now i see what is going on in the world - wars in other regions .
what are these people fighting for ?
why are they killing each other ?
war has now become very close to our country and i can hardly believe that .
we used to be a friendly country , how can it be that we are now strugg@@ ling ?
people and children suffer , i am sure that in ukraine many children have already been killed and many have still been killed .
if we only want to attack and throw out all these re@@ be@@ ls - as far as possible away .

4 tips for better under@@ water photos and videos .
if you like to take photos or videos under water , there is a selection of equipment .
the che@@ apest option is a water@@ proof point an@@ ten@@ na sho@@ ot , like the ni@@ kon cool@@ pi@@ x a@@ wn@@ 120 or a flash action sho@@ ot .
i took these photos at a family party with several cameras , all at a price of less than $ 3@@ 50 .
regardless of the equipment , there are some rules for the best results .
check your equipment twice .
even if you have a water@@ proof camera , make sure that the camera is not in the battery com@@ part@@ ment and other subjects .
adjust your camera to the photos or videos you want to record .
some cameras and cam@@ c@@ order have scene and recording modes .
and before you jum@@ p in , check to which depth your equipment is functional .
some cameras are only available for up to 5 feet , others up to 50 or 60 feet .
search our shopping guide and reviews for digital cameras for conventional cameras and water sli@@ des .
take multiple sho@@ ts - because many will not fold .
poin@@ t-@@ and-@@ sho@@ ot cameras feature a l@@ cd , which allows you to comp@@ ile images .
even if you have an l@@ cd , it is difficult to see this under water , and the right image setting is a fortun@@ e .
so take a lot of pictures .
if your camera is in order , you can use a series of images with slightly modified exposure settings .
stay close to the surface .
the light is dram@@ atically worse as it moves away from the surface .
so , if possible , they remain close to the surface when they take pictures in a pool , a lake or the sea .
this allows you to add more color to your photos ; the de@@ eper you go , the less color you will see .
go close to the objects .
this is also a good advice on land , but it is all the more important under water because of the poor lighting conditions .
it is particularly important when you are working with an action c@@ am : these devices often have a fixed wide@@ -@@ angle lens .
andre@@ w law@@ son was a man of the variety whose character changed things , even in such a gi@@ gan@@ tic organization as the n@@ h@@ s .
as an advisory an@@ aes@@ the@@ sia doctor , he devoted his career to the task of helping the si@@ ck both to the ag@@ ony of the disease and to the pain of treatment .
among his patients , his wife re@@ members , was a mi@@ 6 employee who was dealing with the dev@@ ast@@ ating effects of torture .
law@@ son knew that the doctors were given the diagno@@ sis and disease .
one day in 2007 , however , he was the one whose path of suffering began .
&quot; i did not feel , &quot; wrote he in may this year .
i had difficulty getting up .
while he was dealing with influ@@ en@@ za like symp@@ t@@ oms , he noticed that he was not giving his wife ju@@ li@@ et im@@ pati@@ ently .
&quot; i want to do everything better immediately than later , &quot; he noted .
as ju@@ li@@ et for a week on a business trip , la@@ v@@ son felt quite unusual in his attitude and without reason .
something was wrong with the air .
he asked a colleague to have an x-@@ ray examination of his bre@@ ast .
only two weeks ago , he was in the french alps for skiing .
the result of the x-@@ ray test was available .
he suffered from mes@@ o@@ the@@ li@@ um , an incur@@ able cancer that has destroyed the bre@@ ast co@@ at , that is , the skin that over@@ la@@ ps the lun@@ gs .
as with most can@@ c@@ ers , the exact tri@@ gger is usually difficult to determine .
while some smo@@ kers , for example , are suffering from l@@ ung cancer , not all l@@ ung cancer are diagno@@ sed earlier by smo@@ kers .
but mes@@ o@@ the@@ li@@ om is different .
in almost all cases , the tri@@ gger is an as@@ be@@ sto@@ s stra@@ in - contact with the fi@@ bre building material once known as &quot; mir@@ acle material &quot; but has now been recognized as le@@ th@@ al .
for most of us , mes@@ the@@ li@@ om is a disease that can easily ignore .
as@@ be@@ sto@@ s is , after all , a product of the past .
the most dangerous type of as@@ be@@ sto@@ s has been banned in britain since the 196@@ 0s , when the industry volun@@ tar@@ ily committed itself to with@@ drawing its use .
even where it was still used , people only work in certain sectors directly with the substance - pl@@ um@@ ber , construction workers , car@@ pen@@ ter and shi@@ py@@ ard workers , for example .
as an industrial hazar@@ dous substance from another time , it seems today hardly worrying .
but this com@@ plac@@ ency is in@@ appropriate .
britain , it seems , is now experiencing the peak of a mes@@ ol@@ the@@ li@@ om ep@@ ide@@ mic .
there are more deaths from mes@@ o@@ the@@ li@@ um here than in any other country in the world .
with a total of 2,@@ 500 deaths per year , twice the number of people dying from this disease than road accidents .
annual figures of the mes@@ o@@ the@@ li@@ um deaths since 1980 and prospec@@ tive future deaths in the uk
the reason we have not yet seen the fat@@ al effects , although as@@ be@@ sto@@ s has been illegal for years ( 1999 all types of as@@ be@@ sto@@ s were banned ) is that a mes@@ the@@ li@@ um only develops after decades .
and the s@@ cour@@ ge of the mes@@ o@@ the@@ li@@ om is not attribu@@ ted to former workers in the construction industry .
as@@ be@@ sto@@ s was , and is often still present , in the homes in which we live , the offices in which we work , the schools in which we learn and the shops in which we shop .
and thus , mes@@ the@@ li@@ om knows no class barriers , financial limits , profes@@ sions , or age .
the privileged bas@@ tions , surrounded by the elegant department stores in london and private schools , are not a shel@@ ter .
the parliament buildings are as@@ be@@ sto@@ s contam@@ inated .
in hospit@@ als where we have heal@@ thi@@ er health , too , we have already started to look at this dead@@ ly car@@ cin@@ o@@ gen .
andre@@ w law@@ son was not old .
he was also not a pl@@ um@@ ber .
he was actually hard hit to imagine that the world was perhaps the most dangerous place to contact as@@ be@@ sto@@ s .
then he found out .
&quot; it looks as if in the tun@@ nels at gu@@ y &apos;s park , the road is still in the middle of the hospital where i was trained for six years .
all - students , nur@@ ses , doctors and nur@@ ses - benefit from the tunnel .
one won@@ ders how many of my colleagues in the same ill@@ ness will suffer from it ?
unfortunately , he was able to answer at least part of the question .
&quot; of the four doctors who were at gu@@ y &apos;s hospital , the most recent and most recent have been in hospital .
how many of us will still be si@@ ck ?
andre@@ w law@@ son was appointed mes@@ the@@ li@@ om at the age of 48 .
when he was born on 17 february this year , he was 55 .
this was an un@@ usually long life@@ time .
fif@@ ty per cent of all mes@@ o@@ the@@ li@@ o trans@@ mit@@ ters die within 8 months of diagno@@ sis .
the disease always ends up fat@@ al .
we can therefore only ask law@@ son &apos;s question : &quot; how many of us will still be si@@ ck ? &quot;
the uk &apos;s leading expert on mes@@ o@@ the@@ li@@ om , professor ju@@ lian pe@@ to , parti@@ ci@@ pa@@ tes in the study of the human condition between 18@@ 70 and 20@@ 50 .
most of them do not yet know that they are dying in this way .
an as@@ be@@ sto@@ s mine in que@@ be@@ c , canada al@@ am@@ y , canada al@@ am@@ y , canada , canada al@@ am@@ y , canada , canada al@@ am@@ y , canada , canada , and the united states .
a short look at the files of the courts , to which the persons concerned are often referred for claims for damages , shows how far the s@@ cour@@ ge of the mes@@ the@@ li@@ um is already spre@@ ading .
in june this year marks &amp; sp@@ enc@@ er ad@@ mitted , for example , that he was giving all neglig@@ ent as@@ be@@ sto@@ s to jan@@ ice .
she worked for nine years for the chain , from 197@@ 8 to 198@@ 7 , and was responsible for the clothing department at two locations - one of which is the flag@@ ship store in ox@@ ford street .
mr. allen was only 18 years old when she started her business at m &amp; s .
now she has two children in the tw@@ en@@ ties .
&quot; before this matter , &quot; she says , &quot; i had never heard of mes@@ o@@ the@@ li@@ om , i had not even really heard anything about as@@ be@@ sto@@ s .
i never thought that i would be affected .
there are few people who know a lot about as@@ be@@ sto@@ s .
the fact is that the term as@@ be@@ sto@@ s does not refer to a substance , but to a group of six min@@ er@@ als .
the name deri@@ ves from the word &quot; as@@ be@@ sto@@ s &quot; , a description of the fi@@ bre structure that makes the fab@@ ric resistant and flexible .
three of the six were used in the construction industry .
ch@@ ry@@ so@@ tile , also known as white as@@ be@@ sto@@ s , is the most common as@@ be@@ sto@@ s today .
it was designed for roof@@ ing plates , floor boards , ro@@ h@@ insul@@ ation , floor insul@@ ation , even for bra@@ ke p@@ ads in cars .
it is less fat@@ al than other forms of as@@ be@@ sto@@ s , but it is still regarded by the eu and the who as &apos; major health risk &apos; with possible death .
more dangerous , however , is the brown as@@ be@@ sto@@ s ( am@@ os@@ it ) and the blue as@@ be@@ sto@@ s ( k@@ ro@@ ky@@ do@@ lit@@ h ) .
britain was once the world ’ s largest im@@ porter of brown as@@ be@@ sto@@ s , and experts susp@@ ect that “ there are clear , but indirect , indic@@ ations that this is a major reason for the uni@@ qu@@ ely high mes@@ o@@ the@@ li@@ um rates . ”
a member of marks &amp; sp@@ enc@@ er was arrested in the flag@@ ship store in ox@@ ford street , london , as@@ be@@ sto@@ s exposed al@@ am@@ y .
jan@@ ice allen may not have proven to be a typical mes@@ o@@ the@@ li@@ op@@ fer , but the work of ju@@ lian pe@@ to suggests that he is a true mes@@ o@@ po@@ pper .
he has presented a study of the people affected , which shows that &apos; a substantial proportion of mes@@ the@@ li@@ omas without known suspension through work or in this house probably caused by as@@ be@@ sto@@ s contact in the environment &apos; .
much of these contacts are based on the &quot; normal use and ag@@ eing &quot; of our buildings .
it looks as if nobody can assume that they are safe .
a report by go@@ d@@ d@@ ard consulting , which has taken over the palace of west@@ min@@ ster , shows how people can also live in the heart of the government , un@@ kno@@ w@@ ingly exposed to the substance .
in 2009 , go@@ d@@ d@@ ard reported that the service levels and pipel@@ ines behind the com@@ it@@ ology rooms of parliament were contam@@ inated with as@@ be@@ sto@@ s , the fat@@ al fi@@ b@@ res of which were caused by something as harm@@ less as &quot; strong air flows &quot; .
members of parliament are often accused of taking care of their own interests , but this is where it appears that there is the opposite .
while the director@@ ate of the parliamentary labour service insi@@ sted that the west@@ min@@ ster palace should be a &apos; clean health certificate &apos; , it has become clear that the commission has made eur 1 billion of work over several years .
the go@@ d@@ d@@ ard report also pointed out that &apos; the existence of nuclear weapons is not sufficiently recognised in accordance with the relevant provisions . &apos;
no one can know whether this mis@@ management will cost lives .
all you can do now is wait .
a person who has lost contact with as@@ be@@ sto@@ s is gra@@ ham ab@@ bot@@ t , a general practi@@ tion@@ er .
as andre@@ w law@@ son suggests , the 50@@ -@@ year-@@ old ab@@ bot@@ t that he was in hospital during his work , was exposed to as@@ be@@ sto@@ s .
&quot; i have worked in a hospital where as@@ be@@ sto@@ s actions have been posi@@ tively decided , &quot; he says , &quot; but i can &apos;t prove it in my case .
it is so difficult to get to all the places where you have worked and to which data you have been working .
what he is still very much aware of is the day at the beginning of december 2009 when he was getting a kind of fe@@ ver .
he was 45 , and just late in the evening carried out an operation .
suddenly i had sha@@ king fro@@ st .
it came very suddenly .
i felt hor@@ ri@@ ble .
i thought the trip home was not to create any more .
as a doctor , ab@@ bot@@ t knew that the pain was caused by the ch@@ est co@@ at , the skin around his lun@@ gs .
but as jan@@ ice allen had no reason to build a mes@@ o@@ the@@ li@@ om .
he did not go to work for a month .
if doctors were surprised , x-@@ ra@@ ys of his bre@@ ast and put ple@@ ur@@ ac@@ ath@@ e@@ ther on to keep flu@@ id out of the lun@@ gs and to be in the laboratory .
his complaints , however , remained un@@ diagno@@ sed .
his health was slowly improving , and he returned to his job .
from time to time , the symp@@ t@@ oms returned , often after physical activity .
in 2011 , a patient came to the hospital with similar symp@@ t@@ oms in his practice and was later diagno@@ sed with mes@@ o@@ the@@ li@@ om .
but even now , ab@@ bot@@ t did not associ@@ ate this with his own case .
after all , his patient was several decades older and had to work directly with as@@ be@@ sto@@ s .
the connection in this case was clear .
in september 2011 , ab@@ bot@@ t ’ s condition deterior@@ ated again , and his doctor brought his c@@ t sc@@ ans and x-@@ ray rec@@ ord@@ ings to a group of experts .
in december 2011 , exactly two years after ab@@ bot@@ t first became ill , he was forced to leave the country with a camera equipped with a pro@@ be .
i am an optim@@ ist .
i usually just continue to say , &quot; he says .
to be honest , i didn &apos;t have so many concerns .
but rac@@ hel , my wife , was concerned .
the result of bi@@ op@@ sy was between christmas and new year &apos;s week@@ s. it was said to me that mes@@ o@@ the@@ li@@ om was .
gra@@ ham ab@@ bot@@ t : diagno@@ sis mes@@ o@@ the@@ li@@ om diagno@@ sis
suddenly ab@@ bot@@ t had appoin@@ t@@ ments with mac@@ mill@@ an-@@ nur@@ ses , of whom one would recommend to him to take a law@@ yer .
only now did he understand the extent of the ep@@ ide@@ mic .
&quot; it turned out that as@@ be@@ sto@@ s was very widespread , especially in large public buildings where pi@@ pes are often mixed with as@@ be@@ sto@@ s , &quot; he says .
the people who are exposed to as@@ be@@ sto@@ s in these buildings are now suffering .
and so mes@@ the@@ li@@ om now meets younger people who are not in the typical profes@@ sions .
the most dangerous as@@ be@@ sto@@ s tu@@ bes in hospit@@ als were located below the ground , so patients were probably not exposed to the substance .
but many employees who work in pede@@ strian tun@@ nels from one building to another ( like andre@@ w lam@@ bert , ) or in underground tun@@ nels under the roof of the building ( as gra@@ ham ab@@ bot@@ t often did ) , did .
it is evident that , for several decades after the war , hospit@@ als may have saved patients &apos; lives , but life@@ -@@ threat@@ ening patients &apos; treatment of their own health .
it will still be removed today .
students presented their bun@@ sen@@ bren@@ ner on as@@ be@@ sto@@ s mat@@ s .
and it does not just concern hospit@@ als .
as@@ be@@ sto@@ s has been used as a chemical agent for its fab@@ ulous insul@@ ating and fl@@ ame re@@ tar@@ ding properties , often in offices , shops , libraries and town h@@ alls .
schools too .
indeed , many people probably have the first as@@ be@@ sto@@ s contact in the class@@ room .
throughout the country , thousands of chemical hours , students have learned to use bun@@ sen@@ bur@@ ner on as@@ be@@ sto@@ s mat@@ s .
on websites the subject of as@@ be@@ sto@@ s is now frequently raised in schools .
and meanwhile , inno@@ cent objects have been found in our houses such as flo@@ oring or sc@@ al@@ p po@@ c@@ kets by default .
&quot; it is an industrial po@@ ison that is in large parts of our properties , &quot; says andre@@ w mor@@ gan , the law@@ yer , who andre@@ w la@@ w@@ son in his process against gu@@ y &apos;s .
in one case , the only contact that was made to a woman concerned , the demo@@ lition of a garden sc@@ rap@@ p in the 197@@ 0s .
so make sure you have your gar@@ d@@ ening sc@@ ales cut off .
the effects of diagno@@ sis , and knowing that the disease is incur@@ able , is immen@@ se .
&quot; it takes a while to process it , &quot; says gra@@ ham ab@@ bot@@ t .
i went back to work and tried to continue , but i noticed that i was not really on the focus .
i was two weeks in practice .
then i knew that i would go and take care of myself .
well , i won &apos;t be going to see another christmas .
the most difficult thing was the change of perspective from a doctor &apos;s position to a patient &apos;s position .
how countless patients before him he re@@ members how overwhel@@ med he is by all the information he has been given .
&quot; it was very difficult to record all this , &quot; he says .
&quot; i asked my doctor &quot; how long do i have ? &quot;
and i was told about 12 months .
i remember having been thinking that &quot; well , i am going to do no more christmas !
that was then . &apos;
mes@@ o@@ the@@ li@@ om is particularly insi@@ di@@ ous because it is our life preser@@ vation mechanism - bre@@ a@@ thing itself - that does not allow fat@@ al cancer .
most cases of mes@@ o@@ the@@ li@@ om are caused by as@@ be@@ sto@@ s contact .
as@@ be@@ sto@@ s is made up of the small@@ est fi@@ bers .
if as@@ be@@ sto@@ s is ir@@ oned and the fi@@ b@@ res are in@@ hal@@ ed , they can be removed in the ch@@ est co@@ at , the skin around the lun@@ gs .
as@@ be@@ sto@@ s fi@@ b@@ res ir@@ rit@@ ate the ch@@ est co@@ at and can tri@@ gger cell mu@@ tations .
&quot; the problem ar@@ ises with the in@@ hal@@ ed nee@@ dle shaped as@@ be@@ sto@@ s fi@@ b@@ res , &quot; according to professor tom treas@@ ure , a heart / thor@@ a@@ x doctor who died in 2001 at the gu@@ y &apos;s hospital .
it is precisely the hospital that andre@@ w law@@ son susp@@ ects will be the as@@ be@@ sto@@ s that has now been exposed to it that is now ir@@ on@@ ically a leading centre for the treatment of mes@@ the@@ li@@ om .
treas@@ ure knew law@@ son and be@@ tr@@ ay@@ ed some others who probably also had to be in hospital during their training .
once as@@ be@@ sto@@ s nee@@ d@@ les reach the l@@ ung tissu@@ e , treas@@ ure says , &quot; will you be taken away from the bre@@ a@@ thing process to the edge where the skin is .
it is in@@ he@@ ren@@ tly inv@@ a@@ sive from the outset .
the usual options for other can@@ c@@ ers are not working with mes@@ o@@ the@@ li@@ um .
the effectiveness of an operation is highly controversial , for example .
some say that they are worth trying .
treas@@ ure does not .
&quot; you can use the ch@@ est co@@ at , &quot; he says .
you will not come around the k@@ ni@@ fe with it .
meanwhile , cancer spe@@ aks &quot; on chem@@ other@@ ap@@ y is not very good , &quot; the &quot; effect shows &quot; , but does not he@@ al .
&quot; sometimes there are long-term survi@@ v@@ ors , &quot; says treas@@ ure .
but in the end they all die .
fortunately , some patients actually live long , much longer than expected .
the author ste@@ ph@@ en j@@ ay g@@ ould died 20 years after diagno@@ sis .
two and a half years after his own diagno@@ sis , gra@@ ham ab@@ bot@@ t is still strugg@@ ling .
after he cont@@ acted mes@@ o@@ the@@ li@@ om , ab@@ bot@@ t came into contact with andre@@ w law@@ son , who was diagno@@ sed with a one-@@ man s@@ cl@@ er@@ os@@ is and coun@@ selling office four years after his diagno@@ sis .
&quot; hel@@ lo , cancer center , &quot; he asked for a happy answer on calls .
&quot; he was very positive , &quot; says ab@@ bot@@ t .
he had his diagno@@ sis 4 years earlier and was still very active .
ab@@ bot@@ t originally used six chem@@ other@@ ap@@ y cy@@ cles , which were used for four months and pre@@ sum@@ ably only for one month .
&quot; i was desper@@ ate , &quot; he says .
i wanted to give up .
law@@ son managed to &quot; change things in a somewhat more positive way &quot; , but he was unable to do so .
after consulting several doctors , the company decided to offer its treatment with prof@@ . lo@@ ic lan@@ g-@@ la@@ z@@ dun@@ ski , heart therap@@ ist and physi@@ ci@@ an at the gu@@ y &apos;s advanced .
&quot; we had an advantage by not referring to the fact that i didn &apos;t call any@@ more , i just called and got an appointment , &quot; says gra@@ ham .
a normal patient would require a transfer and would be required to obtain the treatment .
money is crucial for mes@@ the@@ li@@ om@@ -@@ suff@@ e@@ rers to obtain the best available therap@@ ies .
but if these treatments are inev@@ itable , they are often at risk of being under@@ min@@ ed by another financial concern - the future of families that leave them .
and so they turn to the courts in the hope of compensation .
andre@@ w law@@ son cont@@ acted andre@@ w mor@@ gan of field field fish@@ er wag@@ er@@ house ll@@ p .
&quot; it has been known since 18@@ 98 that as@@ be@@ sto@@ s is extremely dangerous for health , &quot; says mor@@ gan .
but what happened in the 196@@ 0s is that one realized that the us was also a very small burden .
and here the neglig@@ ence of companies began to play a role .
andre@@ w law@@ son and gu@@ y &apos;s hospital set up their case at last , but it was not that which mor@@ gan had a &quot; full &quot; compensation .
after his death , the court of auditors ’ spo@@ kes@@ man confirmed that the gu@@ y &apos;s as@@ be@@ sto@@ s fi@@ b@@ res were not used in the cel@@ lar area in the 199@@ 0s .
that was a very important step for andre@@ w law@@ son .
how to remove as@@ be@@ sto@@ s
in fact , it is very difficult for mes@@ o@@ the@@ li@@ om suff@@ e@@ rers who seek compensation to have an enormous problem , the dead@@ ly as@@ be@@ sto@@ s contact of a company or work@@ place - usually decades after the inci@@ dents .
many of their former employers have been sold or closed .
insurance documents can be lost .
and those who defend themselves against claims know that the time for them is when they are , but certainly not with the pla@@ in@@ ti@@ ffs .
in response , there have been clear new legislation this year that makes it easier for mes@@ the@@ li@@ om@@ -@@ affected individuals to obtain compensation .
the law has a ban on the use of credit cards in a fund funded by the insurance industry of £ 3@@ 50 million .
in these cases , the pla@@ in@@ ti@@ ffs receive 80 % of what a court claims in a normal compensation process .
some 300 successful applications will be submitted to the programme every year .
andre@@ w mor@@ gan , like so many mes@@ o@@ the@@ li@@ om@@ -@@ suff@@ e@@ rers , thin@@ ks that 3@@ 50 million £ is a &quot; very good job &quot; of the insurance industry .
&quot; this is a deal of insu@@ rers for insu@@ rers , &quot; he says , and suggests that it is a deal of money .
mi@@ ke pen@@ ning , the then working and pension minister , also said that the european parliament &apos;s &apos; not perfect &apos; law was not perfect .
but both pen@@ ning and mor@@ gan ad@@ mitted that , with seven deaths on a daily basis , rapid action is needed .
&quot; people suffer so much and need help today , &quot; said pen@@ ning during the second hearing of the mes@@ the@@ li@@ om law in december last year .
at that time , gra@@ ham ab@@ bot@@ t had been in the hands of prof@@ . lo@@ ic lan@@ g-@@ la@@ z@@ dun@@ ski for 19 months .
after your first deliber@@ ations , lan@@ g-@@ la@@ z@@ dun@@ ski recommended an operation which , unlike tom , he had never expected to have a positive effect .
this was done by radiation therapy and chem@@ other@@ ap@@ y - a three-@@ fold therapy .
ab@@ bot@@ t felt strengthened .
&quot; this is of course the most important , &quot; says ab@@ bot@@ t .
we see this again and again in patients .
there is something that can keep you going .
if you give up , it is very fast worse .
gra@@ ham ab@@ bot@@ t under@@ went a major sur@@ gery in march 2012 .
at the end of august , he had the last of the six chem@@ other@@ ap@@ y cy@@ cles behind him .
n@@ ach@@ sor@@ ges@@ can@@ s showed no signs of the disease .
then i had a sc@@ am in march 20@@ 14 .
there were several cancer spots around my bre@@ ast .
i have just been born 50 .
this is not life@@ -@@ threat@@ ening .
this is a life@@ -@@ end .
again , ab@@ bot@@ t under@@ went six chem@@ other@@ ap@@ y cy@@ cles .
now there is no tr@@ ace of t@@ um@@ ors .
but the process is physical and mental very stren@@ u@@ ous .
they must think about practical things - about the money , if i am no longer , for example , or my wife show how the bo@@ iler time setting works .
if you get bad news , you will be negative .
they must look to the future .
as the father of el@@ lie , 16 , and tam@@ s@@ in , 14 , this is not always easy .
&quot; for parents , this is difficult , &quot; he says .
it is hard to know what to say and how much .
when i first got my diagno@@ sis , i told my girl that i had a disease i could not get old with .
they respon@@ ded in very different ways .
tam@@ s@@ in is very soci@@ able and dis@@ g@@ usted .
she told her to her friends and we soon got a lot of calls .
el@@ lie was more cau@@ tious .
she did not say much .
such talks are something that all cancer patients can go through .
but for mes@@ o@@ the@@ li@@ o@@ feature sectors , such talks have not been carried out with hope , not a tr@@ ace of hope for survival .
the disease brings ( as eventually also ste@@ p@@ hen j@@ ay go@@ d@@ d@@ ould ) a gri@@ m security .

china is ref@@ using hong kong to vote for government , demonstr@@ ators swe@@ ar by re@@ tali@@ ation , and the chinese are re@@ tali@@ ating .
on sunday , despite the failure of the chinese government to make more democratic reforms , the chinese parliament decided against the nom@@ ination of candidates for the 20@@ 17 elections by hong kong ’ s elec@@ tor@@ ate .
this approach probably fi@@ ghts the long-@@ announced pro@@ tests in hong kong , hong kong ’ s commercial district , while activi@@ sts are bloc@@ king planning and mobil@@ isation to do so within hours of the announcement .
the decision of the chinese people ’ s congress allows communist leaders to change all non-@@ pe@@ king chinese candidates , and to do so .
&quot; that is not un@@ expected , but it makes us an@@ gr@@ y , &quot; said legal expert em@@ ily la@@ u , chairman of the democratic party .
that is not what beijing promised .
the people of hong kong were lied to .
and it is clear that we are dealing with an author@@ itarian regime .
in its defence of the chinese decision , li fe@@ i , vice secretary general of the standing committee of the national people &apos;s congress , said that the approval of public nom@@ inations for the hong kong government to &apos; cha@@ otic &apos; would be .
since 1997 , when britain lost control of hong kong to the chinese , pe@@ king has promised to keep the people from 20@@ 17 to hold the presidency .
china ’ s leaders presented sunday ’ s decision as a democratic break@@ through , because it made it possible for hong kong ’ s citizens to vote directly , but the decision also makes it clear that china ’ s leaders are following the process closely by a beijing nom@@ ination .
a new clause also requires candidates to be &quot; lo@@ v@@ ingly and lo@@ v@@ ingly &quot; accepted for hong kong .
the decision follows a summer in which some of the largest and most effective prote@@ sters in hong kong are being held in j@@ ail for several years .
behind the pro-@@ democratic campaign in hong kong is the occup@@ y central movement with love and peace , which is the organiz@@ ers of which is threat@@ ening to dis@@ ru@@ pt the financial district .
on sunday evening , in a few hours after the announcement , hundreds of people from oc@@ cu@@ p@@ y-@@ centr@@ al-@@ sup@@ porters had met in the rain before the government headquarters in hong kong .
at the demonstration , the organiz@@ ers said that their movement would take a new stage of civil dis@@ o@@ be@@ di@@ ence and that it would protest in the coming weeks .
however , they did not provide any further information on this , apparently to avoid problems with the authorities .
in an online communication , the organiz@@ ers announced that the movement &quot; the occupation of the central district is only considered as a last resort .
we are sorry to have to say that all the opportunities for dialogue have been exhaus@@ ted today and the appointment of the central district has definitely taken place .
the hong kong authorities have been preparing for the announcement of beijing ’ s decision for days , and it was on sunday before the government building that security measures were ti@@ ghten@@ ed , including police forces and bar@@ ric@@ ades .
the un@@ rest is caused by the feeling of many in hong kong that they are slowly losing control of their city .
the movement of people from the main@@ land is increasing competition for products and services .
moreover , there is growing fear that hong kong ’ s values of democracy and freedom of speech will be ero@@ ded under growing pressure from beijing .
some cri@@ tici@@ zed the oc@@ cu@@ p@@ y-@@ centr@@ al-@@ movement demonstra@@ tions , because they did not allow business operations - the li@@ fel@@ ine of hong kong .
&quot; the pro@@ tests they speak of could be of great economic damage , depending on how many people are involved and how long they are going to last , &quot; said legal experts re@@ gin@@ e i@@ p , who is the movement for long cri@@ tici@@ zing .
we do not want to raise fears that hong kong will get out of control .
this impression is bad for investment .
state@@ -@@ controlled media have reported that china has recently reported the democratic acti@@ vis@@ t in hong kong as being run by western powers .
this summer , activi@@ sts organised an un@@ official referendum on the electoral rights to which 7@@ 8@@ 0,000 people were participating - more than a fifth of the voters in hong kong .
in july , tens of thousands took part in one of the greatest democratic demonstra@@ tions in the region ’ s history .
the tradition of school gradu@@ ation b@@ alls in the us is now being transferred to universities where fres@@ h@@ men perform performances with the private aircraft .
we are looking forward to respon@@ ding to this demand and to offering the first luxurious travel service in britain for students of today .
to make a particularly impressive appearance at the university , the company also offers transportation options for the entire city , such as private aircraft , roll@@ s-@@ roy@@ ce ph@@ an@@ tom , ast@@ on mar@@ ten or m@@ cla@@ ren p@@ 1 .
mr ste@@ w@@ art also stated that the service is a security division .
this service is an ideal alternative for students who would otherwise have to change their hab@@ its in a danger@@ ously over@@ loaded car through the country .
together with our new vi@@ f options , we look forward to making sure that the new vi@@ f students will have a minimum of effort and a maximum of knowledge of the university .
a corporate spo@@ kes@@ man said that no new book@@ ings have been made yet , as the service has only just been introduced , but added that the &quot; students have to pay for the service in the next few weeks &quot; .
the company also announced that despite the study fees of 9@@ ,000 £ per year , it had created a market for this offer .
students today differ in their expectations and requirements very much from the students 10 , 20 , 30 or 40 years ago - it is more important than ever to have a great first impression , and with vi@@ f you can do just that .
the national student union cri@@ tici@@ zed the service as being out@@ -of-@@ date .
me@@ gan dun@@ n , vice president of n@@ us for higher education said : &quot; this offer seems to be completely separate from the lives of the majority of students .
many students who have completed their studies this month face a crisis of living costs .
fem@@ ini@@ sts cri@@ tici@@ ze race and police behavior after fer@@ g@@ us@@ on
the un@@ armed te@@ en@@ ager was arrested earlier this month by a police officer in fer@@ g@@ us@@ on , mon .
the participants raised their hands in the air and san@@ g , &quot; hands up , not sho@@ ot , &quot; while they were war@@ ned of bur@@ ial .
after two weeks of pro@@ tests in fer@@ g@@ us@@ on , mo , on account of the sho@@ oting of the un@@ armed te@@ en@@ ager michael brown , the blo@@ gg@@ ers mi@@ ri@@ am zo@@ il@@ a per@@ re@@ z noticed a change in the way .
according to their experience , white fem@@ in@@ ist comm@@ ent@@ ators put gender before race when it comes to the promotion of re@@ productive rights and income inequality .
while ten@@ sions in the middle west have increased and attention has been paid to the country as a whole , pe@@ re@@ z saw that white women ’ s responses were 100 % r@@ aci@@ al .
compared to the answers black women have just after the sho@@ ts of 9 august , the personal es@@ says have been given with tit@@ les such as &quot; thoughts to fer@@ g@@ us@@ on of a white woman &quot; and &quot; fem@@ in@@ ism is not only about op@@ pression .
but for pe@@ re@@ z , this meant an important change .
&quot; i do not think that fem@@ in@@ ism can find many people who know what it means and who have privile@@ ges on such a high class level , &quot; she said .
people felt they were being pus@@ hed to do something about the inci@@ dents .
it is characteristic of the crisis we are in and because the situation in remote gu@@ ine@@ a is so eth@@ n@@ ically so that it expres@@ ses what it means .
for english professor k@@ ori@@ th@@ a mit@@ ch@@ ell of the o@@ hi@@ o state university , he has taught at the university of california problems that black americans have been facing every day .
&quot; i can do something fun@@ ny on fac@@ e@@ book about me and my partner and get 150 li@@ kes from anywhere , &quot; said mit@@ ch@@ ell .
if i post something about how col@@ oured in your own country are being under sie@@ ge , the silence is ear@@ thy .
&quot; how can it be safe for women to publicly talk about a relationship , but not about public security ? &quot; he asked .
for black women such as mit@@ ch@@ ell , race , gender and sex@@ u@@ ality in the history of the us , there is no den@@ sity in the relationship between race and sexual orientation .
for them , black women do not have the luxury of clean@@ sing up the issues ; they live every day in the combined reality .
while white women now discuss race and gender in the fe@@ tish and fem@@ in@@ ist main@@ stream cir@@ cles , ang@@ ela hat@@ ter@@ y says , professor of gender equality and gender equality , that they are not .
&quot; between 18@@ 65 and 18@@ 90 , at least 10@@ ,000 black men were yellow and the explan@@ atory statement was almost always the ra@@ pe of a white woman , &quot; said hat@@ tery .
white women had to be involved in history to make ly@@ n@@ ch murder a reality .
for h@@ at@@ tery , the division between white and black women came at the point where white figh@@ ters were responsible for the right to vote in women , such as sus@@ an b@@ . an@@ th@@ ony , in the late n@@ ine@@ teenth century ’ s , analy@@ zed the country and analy@@ zed it for the late years .
&quot; they decided to op@@ t for the right to vote for women , and the right to vote for black people should come later , &quot; said hat@@ tery .
if we remember such things , we are aware of the power of the colour women who do not trust white women .
we have not done our job well .
we have never helped black women to get their hus@@ bands and s@@ ons protected .
even after women had acquired the right to vote in 19@@ 20 , it took a decade for white women to defend themselves against ly@@ n@@ ching in the association of so@@ vie@@ t-@@ style women .
the group was established almost 40 years after the initial request for help from black women , says mit@@ ch@@ ell .
for mit@@ ch@@ ell , the flo@@ od of white fem@@ in@@ ist re@@ actions to the problems raised by fer@@ g@@ us@@ on - police behaviour , r@@ aci@@ al discrimination - is a reflection of the time when white fem@@ ini@@ sts &quot; catch up with &quot; .
&quot; would it not be great if the activi@@ sts who have such traditional fem@@ in@@ ist platforms were to have the right to education of a child as serious as they are ?
fem@@ ini@@ sts of the second generation who have continued their care@@ ers in the struggle for reproduction rights and access to contrac@@ ep@@ tive means , have been trying to find out what is the meaning .
the famous white fem@@ in@@ ist acti@@ vis@@ t gl@@ oria ste@@ iner went to the united states two weeks after the sho@@ oting of michael brown on fac@@ e@@ book and published a poin@@ ted article by re@@ bec@@ ca car@@ ro@@ ll , who was released .
&quot; i hope that women who have a different but parallel reason to do so will have a more in@@ he@@ rent danger to the body - and opinions on re@@ aring race , which is in public po@@ lls are clearly different - can cause changes .
although stones are a very inter@@ sec@@ tional fem@@ in@@ ism , in which r@@ aci@@ al and gender differences are raised , the issues of some of their comments on r@@ aci@@ al sem@@ an@@ tics in america are ast@@ on@@ ishing .
christ@@ ina som@@ mer@@ s. resear@@ cher at the american enterprise institute and author of &quot; who st@@ ü@@ le fem@@ in@@ ism ? &quot; said to s@@ he the pe@@ op@@ le , that young men in the united states , especially young farmers .
there are now hundreds of special programmes for girls and young women , but almost nothing for bo@@ ys .
but when the white house recently launched a small program , my brother &apos;s ke@@ eper , i was trying to find vulnerable young black and h@@ is@@ pan@@ ic men , there were an@@ no@@ ying re@@ actions from many fem@@ ini@@ sts who were among them .
the relationship between the police and the black community is not the only problem that has come to the fore of main@@ stream fem@@ in@@ ism .
after the us border police have been able to release nearly 6@@ 3@@ ,000 un@@ accompanied min@@ ors on the country ’ s sou@@ th@@ west border this year , the issue of immigration reform is back on the surface , this time as a women ’ s issue .
andre@@ a mer@@ c@@ ado , co-@@ chairman of we bel@@ ong together , an organization that has made women responsible for immigration reform , has said that the eu needs a new perspective on the issue .
&quot; they speak for themselves , &quot; said mer@@ c@@ ado .
if the vast majority of working vis@@ as are sent to male immigrants , the women who are in need of them are in a position where they are responsible for domestic work .
&quot; these stories find a lasting impact on women &apos;s organisations , &quot; she said .
&quot; sch@@ we@@ in@@ e-@@ haus &quot; in ip@@ sw@@ ich stands for sale in the pi@@ g sw@@ ich .
the image of a house for sale was taken away by real estate agents when it became clear that there was a big pi@@ g that it had been comfor@@ tably in the living room .
the de@@ t@@ ached house has one bedroom , located on a private street in ip@@ sw@@ ich and is used for £ 1@@ 20@@ ,000 .
the details included an image of the living room of the house - including a pi@@ g .
real estate bro@@ kers conn@@ ell@@ s said that the pi@@ g in the photo was the pet of the owner .
&quot; the photo was incorrec@@ tly published and has been removed &quot; said a speaker of the company .
the hotel ’ s exposure described con@@ n@@ ell@@ s ’ earlier meeting meeting house as a “ unique event ” , a house with a bedroom .
although the bro@@ ker has the image removed from the website , it still appears on advertising material .
the sale of the house provided interest in the social media , as some asked whether the pi@@ g was included in the purchase price .
the city of har@@ ve@@ y is home to lo@@ t@@ to@@ ff@@ e@@ it a new mil@@ li@@ on@@ air@@ e after lo@@ t@@ to@@ ff@@ e@@ it a mil@@ li@@ on@@ air@@ e .
a lo@@ t@@ tery player from har@@ ve@@ y is on the way this month .
the search for a new mil@@ li@@ on@@ air@@ e in the sou@@ th@@ west of per@@ th is ongoing , with a lu@@ cky winner who has been taken out of the lo@@ t@@ tery on saturday almost $ 1.@@ 1 million .
a newspaper ki@@ os@@ k in har@@ ve@@ y attrac@@ ted visitors for the second time in five years to the draw of the first division , after 1 million euros .
the lu@@ cky winner , however , has yet to report .
the shop owner ste@@ ve forward said that profit care for talking material in the small town of south west of per@@ th .
the city is talking about nothing else , and everyone is pretty ex@@ ci@@ ted .
we thought that such a gain could occur .
eight wa winners last month won pri@@ zes in the first division .
last week , a player from can@@ ning val@@ e was one of the five mil@@ li@@ on@@ ai@@ res in august , after a couple from bel@@ mon@@ t had left the me@@ ga win of $ 7.@@ 5 million just a few weeks earlier .
the winning couple had played and said that the profit allows me to give you the opportunity to travel around the world and buy a new house .
the mil@@ li@@ on@@ air@@ e from har@@ ve@@ y is the 5@@ 9@@ th winner of the first division in the wa this year , with a total of almost $ 85 million .
leon@@ id@@ as asked the gla@@ di@@ ator to be invited to the gla@@ di@@ ator arena .
not only the gla@@ di@@ ators were standing an@@ k@@ le deep in the mat@@ ch at the first r@@ ö@@ mer@@ tag in the fre@@ iz@@ e@@ it@@ park .
but the attr@@ action of the event was strong enough to go beyond 1000 visitors yesterday .
there was a colour@@ ful series of representa@@ tions , performances , games , exhibition pieces and information about the time of the roman@@ s and their importance for the rh@@ ine .
the main attr@@ action of the day was undoubtedly the mar@@ ti@@ al@@ ic war@@ ri@@ or force of the gla@@ di@@ ator school &quot; am@@ or mor@@ tis &quot; , which was responsible for every ra@@ iny break in which the force was equipped with soft sand .
gla@@ di@@ ator owner &quot; leon@@ id@@ as &quot; proved to be a hum@@ or@@ ous and kno@@ wled@@ ge@@ able pres@@ enter and sent his own works to the united states in a row .
first , the &quot; pro@@ voca@@ te@@ urs &quot; were on the series with rec@@ tan@@ gu@@ lar shi@@ eld and short s@@ word , as well as le@@ g track on the left le@@ g and arm rail on the right arm .
the &quot; es@@ se@@ d@@ ari@@ i &quot; followed with bre@@ ast sign , short s@@ word and lit@@ ter lan@@ ze , as well as iron gla@@ di@@ ator hel@@ met , leg@@ s and arms .
the first time the &quot; re@@ tic@@ ari@@ us &quot; was played with w@@ ur@@ f@@ net@@ z , tri@@ angle and d@@ ag@@ ger against the &quot; sec@@ u@@ tor &quot; .
the s@@ words me@@ tal@@ lic cl@@ ash , the shi@@ el@@ ds of sh@@ ep@@ per@@ ts and the thro@@ wing p@@ ins flo@@ wn sur@@ ren@@ dering through the arena that gives fear and ban@@ g to one .
but the impressive “ green ” of the “ green ” of the “ mu@@ c@@ us ” sho@@ oting re@@ fe@@ ree had always been a close eye .
&quot; we wanted to re@@ discover the everyday life of rome and to preserve the culture of the roman era &quot; , explained lor@@ en@@ z e@@ us@@ kir@@ chen , chairman of the organiz@@ er &quot; friends of the r@@ ö@@ mer channel &quot; , who visited the city .
after two years of preparation , the theme park was turned into a &quot; opport@@ id@@ um roman@@ um &quot; for a day , a roman city , such as vice may@@ or cla@@ us wh@@ age in his gre@@ e@@ ting .
after all , the roman@@ s have not only won war and con@@ quest in our region , but also the roman culture and numerous structures that we still adm@@ ire today .
the remains of this were also visible at the roman day , such as &quot; aqu@@ educ@@ t mar@@ ble &quot; , from the el@@ f meter high and 14@@ 00 meters long roman bridge .
the fron@@ tin@@ i company provided the water and energy supply to the people , and the managing director pe@@ tra fr@@ ic@@ ke knew : &quot; we are still taking advantage of the knowledge of that time &quot; .
this also confir@@ ms diplom@@ a surve@@ ying engine@@ er r@@ alp@@ h he@@ ili@@ ger of the &quot; engineering team two &quot; from rhe@@ in@@ bach , the survey instruments of the roman@@ s such as ch@@ or@@ ob@@ at , gro@@ ma or di@@ op@@ tra .
the roman@@ s villa in blan@@ ken@@ heim presented ske@@ tch and models of the exc@@ av@@ ations an@@ no 18@@ 94 and br@@ ic@@ ks from the original hy@@ po ca@@ ste , the war@@ m@@ l@@ wing he@@ ater , the once the roman wall .
the foot@@ prin@@ ts , which were taken by wol@@ f and fox two years ago , in the foot@@ steps of the sound , are impressive .
in 2011 , the state of the land conservation office had awarded the r@@ hin@@ eland regional association the remains of a roman villa in the nor@@ d industrial park in rhe@@ in@@ bach .
they have built walls of an economic building with a dar@@ re for dr@@ ying cere@@ als and for mo@@ wing .
the building probably led to a villa rus@@ tic@@ a , a farm , explained the history of the archae@@ o@@ log@@ ist dr. j@@ enni@@ fer mor@@ sh@@ is@@ er .
a number of finds from these exc@@ av@@ ations have been found in a glass cab@@ in@@ et , including a large plate , several finds of glass vessels and a part of a delicate half-@@ sc@@ at@@ tered nec@@ kl@@ ace .
the villa was probably built between the first and fourth centuries ad , until the beginning of the 20th century , when the german@@ s inv@@ aded the r@@ hin@@ eland of the roman empire .
it was also the subject of the roman wind@@ m@@ ill game , similar to today &apos;s m@@ ill game , or it was written as if the roman wind@@ m@@ ill had given their names to the wa@@ x tab@@ lets .
at the stand of the r@@ ö@@ mer@@ ther@@ men z@@ ü@@ l@@ p@@ ich , the children were allowed to put mo@@ sa@@ ics themselves , to take part in the stand of the rh@@ ine bach glass mo@@ sa@@ ics and to stand at the ei@@ fe@@ l .
the new , with the “ green ” approach drawn by two col@@ d-@@ blo@@ wn original roman v@@ ans , was a great opportunity to explore the theme park and to enjoy the impressive status of the city gy@@ m@@ na@@ si@@ um , which is now available .
with a roman week from september 13 to 21 , the town of w@@ ach@@ t@@ berg will also be extended into the r@@ ö@@ mer@@ ja@@ hr 20@@ 14 , which will be remin@@ ded of the death of emper@@ or au@@ gu@@ st@@ us 2000 years ago .
together with the home and history associations and the wat@@ ch@@ ber@@ ger wan@@ der@@ -@@ vere@@ in , the partnership association and the am@@ ate@@ ur play@@ group ob@@ er@@ bac@@ he@@ m , them@@ atic hi@@ kes , a lec@@ ture , cooking even@@ ings and other .
for example , a roman legi@@ on@@ na@@ ire is being att@@ acked by his work on the zu@@ g@@ ge@@ gen@@ en w@@ ach@@ t@@ berg , plants as living monuments from the roman era and a fun@@ ny lesson in geno@@ cide .
the ad@@ endor@@ fer primary school is dedicated to the development of the r@@ ö@@ mer@@ them@@ a in the context of a project week .
the roman week is intended to highlight the numerous , but often not visible , sp@@ ines of the roman@@ s in wat@@ ch@@ berg .

e@@ bol@@ a – the ep@@ ide@@ mic is weigh@@ ing on west africa ’ s economy and its economy , and is affecting the economy of west africa .
the e@@ bol@@ a ep@@ ide@@ mic in west africa is also a serious b@@ low to the economy .
markets are or@@ ph@@ an@@ ed - and international companies are at a distance .
the dev@@ ast@@ ating e@@ bol@@ a ep@@ ide@@ mic is giving west africa ’ s economy a heavy b@@ low .
the har@@ v@@ est ro@@ ts on the fields , mines are leaving and the markets are wa@@ tered down - the virus has left the region hard .
some international companies are already taking a distance .
&quot; the e@@ bol@@ a ep@@ ide@@ mic is not only a medical crisis , but also an economic one , &quot; jud@@ ges the head of the african development bank , don@@ ald k@@ ab@@ er@@ u@@ ka .
liber@@ ia is the hard@@ est hit .
&quot; it is a total disaster , we lose a lot of money , &quot; says al@@ ha@@ ji b@@ am@@ o@@ go , who is on the second largest market in liber@@ ia &apos;s capital , mon@@ ro@@ via .
the only thing that comes on the market is who has food or something to buy against e@@ bol@@ a .
liber@@ ia is the hard@@ est hit by the virus , but here alone the fe@@ ver fell more than 600 people .
recently , health authorities declared that the disease was present at every corner of the country .
in gu@@ ine@@ a , sier@@ ra le@@ one and ni@@ geria , the virus has spread , too .
in total , more than 15@@ 00 people have died , thousands more have died .
foreign companies are re@@ loc@@ ating workers
everywhere in res@@ our@@ ce-@@ rich countries , companies are starting their business .
foreign companies such as the ar@@ cel@@ or mit@@ tal steel group are with@@ drawing their employees , several international airlines are not flying to the affected regions .
local trad@@ ers and farmers are also re@@ acting : few merchan@@ ts are still leaving their homes to buy supplies .
in some areas of sier@@ ra le@@ one and liber@@ ia , which are suffering from quar@@ ant@@ ine , the ru@@ ins of the former soviet union , which are important for exports , are destro@@ ying the soil .
farmers do not d@@ are to pay their homes for har@@ ve@@ sting .
food is scar@@ ce@@ ly sold
&quot; people will travel less and less , &quot; says phil@@ li@@ pe de v@@ re@@ yer , paris expert for the economy of west africa .
the man , for example , who normally goes on to the market and sel@@ ls his vegetables , would rather stay at home .
the population is therefore feeling the effects of the ep@@ ide@@ mic directly and urgently : food is scar@@ ce .
the market is under@@ going a decline in stocks of basic food@@ stuffs such as rice .
at the same time , the region , which is heavily dependent on international companies , is threatened with damage to the image , with far-@@ reaching consequences .
the greatest danger is that international companies will , in principle , avoid the area for a long time , says phili@@ ppe hu@@ g@@ on of the french think tan@@ k ir@@ is .
the crucial point is how far and how long the virus will spread .
the impression that investors have been given is that it is dangerous to invest in gu@@ ine@@ a , sier@@ ra le@@ one and liber@@ ia , and thus to invest , &quot; hu@@ gg@@ on war@@ ns .
the disease also bur@@ dens the har@@ d-@@ pressed state budgets of the states that have adopted the euro zone and have suffered a serious b@@ low to the state budgets of the member states .
the disease also bur@@ dens the already stra@@ ined state budgets of the affected states .
the credit rating agency mo@@ o@@ dy &apos;s fears that the financial impact of their budgets will be heavily influenced by the high expenditure on the health system and , in addition , by the wor@@ sen@@ ing economy .
the african development bank has already promised to pay special attention to the health systems of the countries concerned , with usd 60 million ( eur 45 million ) .
the impact is already notic@@ eable in ni@@ geria , where few ec@@ ol@@ ab@@ el cases have been diagno@@ sed .
while the o@@ il@@ -@@ rich region in the southern ni@@ ger del@@ ta has not been affected to date .
but elsewhere , many people are already left out of fear of cont@@ ag@@ ion .
reservations of hotels are also significantly reduced .
protect your 50@@ th anniversary !
the &quot; t@@ ann@@ en@@ wal@@ d &quot; bern@@ ga@@ u s@@ ag@@ it@@ tari@@ us celebra@@ tes its 50@@ th anniversary from 12 to 14 september .
on high tours , the sho@@ ot@@ ers &apos; club of t@@ ann@@ en@@ wal@@ d run the preparations for the 50@@ th anniversary of its foundation from 12 to 14 september .
the plan is to open a large entertainment evening with the group &quot; dor@@ fro@@ ck@@ er &quot; on friday , september 12 .
on saturday , at 6 pm the big sho@@ oting of the b@@ ö@@ ll@@ er@@ schi@@ ff@@ e .
afterwards , the large t@@ ent is the evening of the mo@@ od with the &quot; sto@@ ap@@ fal@@ zer sp@@ it@@ z@@ bu@@ am &quot; .
b@@ low@@ ing tape makes music and the music in the room very easy .
highlights on sunday are the festival service and 9@@ ,@@ 30 am in the par@@ ish church and the large festival in the church at 14@@ .00 .
in the afternoon the price distribution of the german and gau@@ ge sho@@ oting is also possible .
a particularly beautiful sight will be the 25 festival women with their dir@@ n@@ d@@ l@@ n .
the festival cha@@ pel is the br@@ ass band bern@@ ga@@ u .
the pat@@ ron@@ age has been carried out by may@@ or wol@@ f@@ gan@@ g wild and secretary of state al@@ bert fü@@ r@@ ack@@ er .
the original term &quot; sho@@ ot@@ ers company t@@ ann@@ en@@ wal@@ d bern@@ ga@@ u &quot; was born in 19@@ 07 , when the association became a &quot; social entertainment through exercise in the room stu@@ d@@ ent-@@ room and small cab@@ in sho@@ oting &quot; on 21 march .
the na@@ zi regime had rul@@ ed in 19@@ 37 the dis@@ solution of the association .
only in 196@@ 4 did 19 young men find themselves , who were arrested on 30 april in gu@@ es@@ thouse lu@@ k@@ as and who had signed the &quot; new &quot; s@@ ü@@ tz@@ en@@ vere@@ in &quot; t@@ ann@@ en@@ wal@@ d &quot; bern@@ ga@@ u .
kar@@ l march and ad@@ ol@@ f ried led the association as champi@@ on through a difficult initial period , in which it was mainly the aim of creating a uni@@ ver@@ sit@@ ä@@ t and to prevent the sho@@ oting .
in the autumn of 196@@ 5 the sho@@ ot@@ ers &apos; association started a project in the restaurant &quot; le@@ in@@ inger &quot; with two teams in the round competi@@ tions .
in the following years , the sports sco@@ rers , who have now been organized into seven teams , established themselves in all classes up to the 1st ga@@ ul@@ ig@@ a .
the club records pur@@ z@@ el@@ les are ann@@ ually and the mag@@ ical border of 3@@ 80 r@@ ings was first discovered by ru@@ di me@@ i@@ er in 1980 .
just as the performance of active sho@@ ot@@ ers has increased , members ’ numbers have also improved .
after the club &apos;s &quot; le@@ in@@ inger &quot; club is no longer up to the demands of a modern sho@@ oting association , the d@@ aim@@ ler ag board of directors at the time was able to make it a success .
after a work@@ load of 27@@ 00 hours , on 8 may 198@@ 8 par@@ ish pri@@ est str@@ ass@@ er granted the right to the church council of the new protec@@ tive rooms .
one of the great highlights of the association &apos;s history was certainly the 4@@ 4th ga@@ thering , connected with the f@@ es@@ tive con@@ sec@@ r@@ ation of the new flag in july 1991 .
on 23 and 24 april 1994 , the sho@@ ot@@ ers &apos; association established its 30@@ -@@ year anniversary .
1995 is a b@@ ö@@ ll@@ er@@ group founded .
jo@@ se@@ f sch@@ mal@@ z@@ l was appointed b@@ ö@@ ll@@ er@@ re@@ fe@@ rer .
a big challenge for the &quot; mal@@ te@@ rer &quot; and for the association as a whole was the orientation of the bav@@ arian b@@ ö@@ ll@@ er@@ tre@@ ff@@ en 2005 .
in many hours of volunte@@ er work , the club members have visited the premises and sho@@ oting facilities in the bern@@ ga@@ u hof .
ele@@ ven teams in round competi@@ tions
the new version of the game is available for download .
in total , ele@@ ven teams are currently compe@@ ting in the round competi@@ tions : six air ri@@ f@@ les , an air@@ gun team , a sports gun , a k@@ k@@ 1 , a youth and team of two ah@@ -@@ teams .

like many other clubs , jazz groups in the tv ja@@ hn are also offered full-@@ day classes at secondary schools .
after the summer holidays , some groups have deci@@ mated themselves .
now , young people are being increasingly sought for a sport that is healthy and has great fun .
in the two jazz and modern dance groups of li@@ sa ne@@ it@@ z@@ el , form@@ erly d@@ anc@@ er in the jazz scene , lis@@ a ne@@ it@@ z@@ el and his band &quot; spir@@ its &quot; , only nine children are still present .

bulg@@ arian prison guards are pro@@ testing against the use of drugs throughout the country .
hundreds of prison officers from all over bulgaria have been tried before the ministry of justice in the capital , so@@ fi@@ a , for a nation@@ wide protest .
in the peaceful demonstration , they repeated their demands for the restoration of their old working conditions , which have recently been changed .
higher sal@@ aries are also on a list of demands that are not compatible with the interim justice minister , mr i@@ van@@ ov , who is to be discussed .

ukra@@ inian army has airport of lu@@ han@@ sk abandoned .
in the east ukraine , the pr@@ or@@ us@@ sian figh@@ ters continue to be on the march .

nato does not want to break agreements with russia
nato is being over@@ sh@@ ad@@ ow@@ ed by the planned dep@@ loy@@ ment in eastern europe following the ukra@@ inian crisis .
nato secretary general and@@ ers fo@@ gh r@@ as@@ mus@@ sen said on monday in brussels that nato is stic@@ king to the nato treaty establishing the nato russia council of 1997 .
nato ’ s chief accused him of “ one cr@@ ass brother ” in the agreement .
&quot; today we have to face reality that russia is not using nato as a partner , &quot; says r@@ as@@ mus@@ sen .
documents and opinions from the russian side show that &apos; they are not in favour of us &apos; .
a stronger nato presence
r@@ as@@ mus@@ sen has also announced the nato presence in eastern europe to strengthen .
a security council meeting at the nato summit in wal@@ es is to be adopted .
ki@@ e@@ v and moscow agree on new gas talks with russia , but the eu is not prepared to start new gas talks .
russia and ukraine have officially agreed to new talks on sett@@ ling their gas dispute .
negotiations are scheduled for next saturday , the russian energy minister alexander no@@ wa@@ k said on monday .
i will come back to a decision by the european union whether it will also have a representative to the talks .
because of the dispute over the price of gas , ukraine has not been given fuel from russia for weeks .
finally , eu energy commissioner g@@ ün@@ ther o@@ et@@ t@@ inger medi@@ ated between both sides .
ukraine had war@@ ned that russia could also cut off gas supplies to europe .
europe imports about a third of its natural gas from russian sources , a large proportion of which goes through ukraine .
mer@@ kel spe@@ aks power word : tol@@ l will come &quot; very clear &quot; .
now the chancell@@ or is once again clearly committed to this .
a licence for all the complicated details is not , however .
the persi@@ stent concerns from the c@@ du against the car tol@@ l have made the c@@ su look increasingly un@@ happy .
chancell@@ or ang@@ ela mer@@ kel has called for continued resistance from her c@@ du to use a power word to introduce a car tol@@ l .
&quot; to be quite clear , it is in the coalition treaty , and it will come , &quot; said the party leader , on monday , after the c@@ du@@ -@@ top meetings , in berlin .
the company was able to rely on a detailed model for the time being .
in the black and red government program , &apos; certain parameters &apos; are mentioned .
federal minister of transport alexander do@@ br@@ in@@ dt ( c@@ su ) has &apos; made a proposal , and that is now being continued &apos; .
the n@@ r@@ w-@@ c@@ du , however , insi@@ sts on its &apos; no &apos; to a tol@@ l on all roads .
mer@@ kel stressed that finance minister wol@@ f@@ gan@@ g sch@@ ä@@ u@@ ble ( c@@ du ) was also construc@@ tively involved in the deliber@@ ations on a draft law .
beyond the subject , he has also worked with do@@ br@@ in@@ dt on other ways of investing more private capital for infrastructure investments , including broad@@ band , and so on .
&quot; there is nothing special about it &quot; , sch@@ ä@@ u@@ ble had a &quot; mirror &quot; report un@@ comm@@ ented on sunday , his house looks at his own concept to make motorway routes investors with foot@@ -@@ tol@@ ls .
c@@ su ch@@ ef hor@@ st see@@ ho@@ fer war@@ ned that the eu should not be allowed to charge tol@@ l concepts against the responsible minister in the cab@@ in@@ et .
c@@ du federal vi@@ ze arm@@ in las@@ ch@@ et re@@ affir@@ med its objec@@ tions .
&quot; the coalition agreement never assumed that all cir@@ cles and federal roads would be pav@@ ed , &quot; said the north rh@@ ine regional council , the president of the republic of germany .
in this respect , it is an important signal that see@@ ho@@ fer has now announced that he will be speaking again on the subject .
resistance to the plans is also coming from the c@@ du national associations of bad@@ en-@@ w@@ ür@@ t@@ tem@@ berg and r@@ hin@@ el@@ and-@@ pal@@ at@@ in@@ ate .
the background to these concerns is that a tol@@ l will make it har@@ der for small border traffic to neighbouring countries .
see@@ ho@@ fer had a long time to get to the town because of the tol@@ l criticism from ran@@ ks of the c@@ du coalition .
the left sees the plans as a priority in view of the dispute in the union .
&quot; the mur@@ ks tol@@ l is dead , &quot; said party leader ber@@ nd ri@@ ix@@ inger of the &quot; new os@@ n@@ ab@@ r@@ ü@@ ck newspaper &quot; ( monday ) .
&quot; with the tol@@ l the minister fails &quot; . do@@ br@@ in@@ dt wants to impose a vig@@ net@@ te obligation on all german roads , which is to start in 20@@ 16 .
domestic car owners , according to the coalition agreement , must not be bur@@ den@@ ed further .
therefore , they should be able to make a full compensation for the tol@@ l via the car tax .
the model may not be used by foreign drivers , however , because of their nation@@ ality , in accordance with eu law .
genetic dis@@ order often mis@@ diagno@@ sed ,
a british man says she thought that the disease was caused by a mis@@ diagno@@ sis for many years .
kar@@ in ro@@ d@@ gers lived almost all her youth in the belief that she was only a few years away from her marriage to another ill@@ ness .
she actually suffered from the char@@ cot@@ -@@ mari@@ e-@@ to@@ oth disease ( c@@ mt ) - a group of in@@ h@@ eri@@ ted dis@@ orders that have left ner@@ ves outside the brain and the sp@@ inal cor@@ d .
char@@ ity c@@ mt uk announced that the bug tracking system has been a frequent problem for people with c@@ mt who have been diagno@@ sed with this disease .
about 23@@ ,000 people in the uk are likely to suffer from c@@ mt , which causes motor dis@@ orders such as mus@@ cle weak@@ ness , an un@@ certain pass@@ age and cur@@ ved to@@ es .
patients also suffer from de@@ af@@ ness or pain .
when ro@@ d@@ gers 13 was , she believed that she was interested in fried@@ rich at@@ a@@ xi@@ e ( i@@ as ) - a disease with very bad survi@@ v@@ ors .
ro@@ d@@ gers thought she would be in a whe@@ el@@ chair before she would be 18 , and before her 30@@ th birth@@ day she would die .
the mother of two children who are 51 today said : &apos; when a child knew that he was not a child , i would do the same as the others .
i always fell and everything took me longer .
i could never travel with other children roll@@ sho@@ e or sk@@ ate@@ board and was often arrested in school for my kind of walking and running .
ro@@ d@@ gers said that she was born at the age of 13 after several operations to reli@@ eve her ach@@ ill@@ es and stret@@ ching her feet .
&quot; i felt guil@@ ty because i was cur@@ ious .
when i received a reply , i was sho@@ c@@ ked and d@@ read@@ fully pan@@ ic@@ ked .
i thought i was working with 18 whe@@ el@@ chair and i was dying with 25 , and in between all my skills would slowly lose all my skills .
i did all this alone with me and planned my own bur@@ ial .
she said when she was 17 , she became clear that her skills were not so much reduced as she would have imag@@ ined and would have been asking her doctor .
he simply stood up and embr@@ ac@@ ed me and said , &quot; my love , i do not think you have that , otherwise you would be already in a whe@@ el@@ chair . &quot;
i think you have a little less life@@ -@@ threat@@ ening .
after some genetic tests , c@@ mt was found .
&quot; when he explained to me what c@@ mt was , i felt as if i were a winner , &quot; said she .
char@@ ity c@@ mt uk has released a c@@ mt awareness report .
st@@ off@@ fel@@ d@@ we@@ bel a. d. ber@@ ni di@@ e@@ ther has been working since the closure of the former tro@@ op training place as a fire@@ figh@@ ter .

in december 2004 , the last shot of a sharp b@@ low fell on m@@ ün@@ sing@@ en ’ s tro@@ op practice square , which was closed at the end of 2005 after 1@@ 10 years of military operations .

tax bur@@ dens on business in the area of washington are rising as the economy reco@@ vers .
economic recovery means more customers , more sales and new jobs .
it also means higher taxes .
government and local tax decisions for companies in the country increased slightly last year , while the economic recovery acceler@@ ated , so a newly published survey showed in the past week that the government firms were in the washington area .
companies in the district , mar@@ y@@ land and vir@@ g@@ ini@@ a jointly paid 2@@ 7.@@ 6 billion $ to state@@ -@@ owned and local authorities in the 2013 financial year , an increase of 3.@@ 8 % compared to the 2012 revenue of 26@@ .@@ 7 billion .
the government and local tax burden on businesses increased by 4@@ ,@@ 3 % last year to 6@@ 71 billion $ , compared to 3.@@ 9 % in 2006 .
government taxes increased more than local taxes , to raise 4.@@ 3 % , so the study suggests that the government services have already started to pay more .
more than half of district ’ s tax revenues , 56 % , come from corporate taxes , while 36 % of mar@@ y@@ land ’ s revenue comes from businesses .
vir@@ g@@ ini@@ a achiev@@ es the lowest tax revenue from companies with 28 % .
much of the increase in tax revenue has been due to a recovery in the real estate values of companies , according to researchers , leading to an increase in real estate taxes of 3.@@ 7 % this year after the three succ@@ essive years of growth .
while a large proportion of these profits come from large states such as california , new york , and tex@@ as , the process also seems to be true of the washington area .
district , mar@@ y@@ land , and vir@@ g@@ ini@@ a jointly paid more than $ 10 billion to state and local real estate taxes last year , compared to $ 9.@@ 6 billion in 2012 - a rise in the course of a year of $ 4.@@ 2 .
but the apparent recovery in real estate values is not so good in mar@@ y@@ land to increase government and local tax revenues , as the country ’ s real estate taxes are estimated to be less than one-@@ fifth of the corporate tax hum@@ iliation .
companies in vir@@ g@@ ini@@ a and d.@@ c. pay almost half of their government and local taxes in the form of real estate taxes .
&quot; in mar@@ y@@ land , a large proportion of the properties , especially in the area of tax around the d.@@ c. , are either owned by the government or non-@@ profit organizations that do not pay real estate taxes , &quot; said dou@@ gl@@ as lin@@ d@@ holm .
mar@@ y@@ land is therefore forced to concentrate much more on income taxes , for example , in order to provide the same services that other states offer .
the recent recovery in tax revenue by businesses cannot be attribu@@ ted solely to the recovery of the housing market .
corporate revenue also seems to be reco@@ vering , according to the data .
companies in the region reported income taxes on government organizations , which were € 2.@@ 3 billion in comparison with $ 2.@@ 1 billion in 20@@ 12 .
mar@@ y@@ land took $ 1 billion in corporate income taxes , which was the highest amount in the region .
while the trend is in the same direction , local tax burden on businesses is not increasing at all three locations equally .
the growth rate in the district was equal to 4.@@ 3 % in the national average , while the rise in mar@@ y@@ land was significantly higher than 4@@ ,@@ 9 % .
only vir@@ g@@ ini@@ a reported an under@@ -@@ average tax revenue of 4.@@ 1 percent .
vir@@ g@@ ini@@ a has achieved a record of 6 % in all three areas of office with significantly lower corporate income taxes ( fixed corporate tax rates in all three areas ) .
the mar@@ y@@ land corporate tax rate is 8.@@ 25 % and the district is relatively close to the 9@@ ,@@ 9@@ 75 % .
a comparable study by the us chamber of commerce earlier this year showed that in vir@@ g@@ ini@@ a , lower government and local corporate taxes are required , and overall , a better tax climate prevail@@ s than in mar@@ y@@ land .
the study has not investig@@ ated the district .
despite its advantages , vir@@ g@@ ini@@ a is under pressure from its southern neighb@@ our .
north car@@ ol@@ ina has laws to reduce its corporate tax rates this year from 6.@@ 9 % to 6 % .
if the government continues to meet its income targets in the coming year , this law could significantly reduce the state ’ s corporate income tax rate by up to 3 % by 20@@ 17 .
meanwhile , it seems that small businesses in the washington area are doing better , and they are therefore paying more government and local taxes , as the recent study suggests .
corporate taxes , which are imposed as personal income taxes by small business@@ men - a transitional structure that allows most small businesses to operate - are not paid in district , mar@@ y@@ land , and vir@@ g@@ ini@@ a last year by 20 % .
researchers say that the trend and the increase in the number of corporate taxes across the country are likely to continue this year , with an increase in the overall tax revenue for the state and the local authorities .
nevertheless , the washington area may be lag@@ ging behind if spending cuts in the federal government are limited to the labor market in the region .
partner city : german beer for gu@@ ang@@ z@@ ho@@ u
ho@@ ps and mal@@ t - also a popular combination in china .
german beer enjoys a reputation in china .
frankfurt ’ s partner city in china now wants a bre@@ w@@ ery and also hopes for a direct air connection between the two cities .
german beer , used in frankfurt &apos;s partner city of gu@@ ang@@ z@@ ho@@ u - that is the urgent wish of the official in china .
&quot; we would be very pleased if a german bre@@ w@@ ery could set up in our city , &quot; said the vice party secretary of the south china metro@@ polis , li yi@@ we@@ i , in this week &apos;s visit to a sp@@ d delegation .
the officials of the regime repeatedly came to the fore in the course of the con@@ vers@@ ation to this concern of the twel@@ ve-@@ million metro@@ polis .
gu@@ ang@@ z@@ ho@@ u , which is also called can@@ ton in germany , is one of china &apos;s rich@@ est cities , war@@ b li .
therefore , people also had the purchasing power to buy german beer , and the public could afford it .
the hes@@ sian sp@@ d chairman thor@@ ste@@ n sch@@ ä@@ fer@@ -@@ g@@ ü@@ m@@ bel , who is leading the german political delegation , said to the host that he would go to germany to see what partner he could possibly have for the project .
&quot; for beer it doesn &apos;t take much : good water , gra@@ in and joy of life &quot; , he added at lunch with the party leader , in gu@@ ang@@ z@@ ho@@ u .
this jo@@ ie de vi@@ vre is already ex@@ u@@ ding mr li , fl@@ at@@ tering the host .
the council of ministers then met with a large majority of the members of the european parliament , including the president of the european parliament , mr gu@@ ang@@ z@@ ho@@ u , who was serving the food .
the chinese brand t@@ sing@@ ta@@ o is based on german bre@@ wing art .
t@@ sing@@ ta@@ o-@@ beer is produced according to german pur@@ ity law .
more business
a second wish of china ’ s hosts would be a direct flight between frankfurt and gu@@ ang@@ z@@ ho@@ u , said vice party leader li .
lu@@ f@@ than@@ sa had previously offered the flight , but in 2012 , for economic reasons , cancelled it .
&quot; it would be worth again &quot; , the municip@@ al politici@@ an showed himself convinced .
&quot; the business relations between our two cities are growing . &quot;
currently , travellers would have to travel via chan@@ g@@ sh@@ a in hun@@ an province , li compla@@ ined .
the administration of the province of gu@@ ang@@ d@@ ong , its capital gu@@ ang@@ z@@ ho@@ u , also hopes to be able to make the flight .
the vice govern@@ or of the province , chen y@@ un@@ xi@@ an , presented this wish in his con@@ vers@@ ation with the social democrats .
&quot; this is a very good idea , &quot; answered sch@@ ä@@ fer@@ -@@ g@@ ü@@ m@@ bel - the chinese vice minister li j@@ in@@ ju@@ n , an in@@ timate con@@ no@@ iss@@ eur of germany , n@@ ick@@ te appro@@ v@@ ingly .
well-@@ maintained partnership
the li@@ eu@@ ten@@ ant vice party leader of gu@@ ang@@ z@@ ho@@ u hopes that the election of his new president will make frankfurt a meeting of partners next year .
li yi@@ we@@ i was already on the main , but not yet in this function .
he only came into office this year after his pre@@ dec@@ essor had been arrested for corruption charges .
the local party leader , wan q@@ ing@@ lian , also had to go .
the action taken against gu@@ ang@@ z@@ ho@@ u officials is part of a nation@@ wide campaign against corruption in the party and administration , which was launched by leader x@@ i j@@ in@@ ping with ri@@ g@@ our .
the new leader , li yi@@ we@@ i , had a strong political will to fight for an american company before he became a party leader , which is highly unusual in the chinese communist party .
before taking office in gu@@ ang@@ z@@ ho@@ u , he was the leading func@@ tion@@ alist in fu@@ j@@ ian , where the automob@@ ile maker v@@ w had produced a great work .
frankfurt is officially more than a do@@ zen tw@@ in@@ ning tw@@ in@@ ning partnerships .
the connection to the 9@@ 000 km away gu@@ ang@@ z@@ ho@@ u is one of those that can be maintained by both sides , for example with a student exchange .
last year , 25 years of the german@@ -@@ chinese association was celebrated .
the south china metro@@ polis on the pe@@ ar@@ l river is almost as strong as anywhere else in h@@ ess@@ en , with its economic power .
next year , it wants to create a gross domestic product of eur 250 billion , reports the president of li .

amaz@@ on bu@@ ys t@@ wit@@ ch for $ 1.@@ 04 billion for $ 1.@@ 04 billion .
amaz@@ on just confirmed what information was on monday morning reported : the online single re@@ tail@@ er - and video producer , and a lot of other things - bu@@ ys the video stre@@ aming service t@@ wit@@ ch for 1.@@ 04 billion $ ( $ 1.@@ 04 billion ) .
the announcement comes as a surprise , not because no one has expected a t@@ wit@@ ch take@@ over , but because it was widely assumed that you@@ tube would acquire the company .
three months ago , it seemed that the sale of t@@ wit@@ ch to the video service of google was for a cool billion .
t@@ wit@@ ch , which was launched as a ju@@ st@@ in@@ .@@ tv just three years ago , was a popular stre@@ aming service - a live version of you@@ tube .
instead , it quickly became a platform for players who want to make their bra@@ v@@ ura pieces released in games , a &quot; you@@ tube for live games &quot; , so an in@@ sid@@ er .
the t@@ wit@@ ch interface .
and let &apos;s play , a video gen@@ re that shows how to play better .
it is just that you@@ tube is often called , when you want to watch t@@ wit@@ ch , so it has been changed to the news that you@@ tube t@@ wit@@ ch wanted to buy something .
it is a myster@@ y why the deal with you@@ tube is not coming .
all we are aware of at the moment is this statement by em@@ met she@@ ar , president of t@@ wit@@ ch : &quot; we have chosen am@@ ate@@ ur .
another secret is , frank@@ ly , the incredible success of t@@ wit@@ ch .
for snow@@ boards like me , who explain that they prefer to do sports rather than watch it , it is hard to get to understand the attr@@ action that assum@@ es to help others play instead of themselves the control panel .
it is one thing to tell a friend at 3 o &apos;@@ clock in the morning while they are being tor@@ n by resid@@ ent evil , and something quite different , a sp@@ inner .
all these games you could watch right now .
another problem is that many of the most popular games today are e@@ go games , so the ran@@ king can be done without own control over the perspective .
i admit that the rapid transit system in which the roma live is a very important part of our electronic age is not being implemented in record time .
but as long as there is no play@@ -@@ like or hum@@ or@@ virtu@@ ous game , his t@@ wit@@ ch channel is probably not so interesting .
but what do ske@@ p@@ tics like me know about it ?
t@@ wit@@ ch is visited by 55 million different visitors per month and is the fourth largest source of internet traffic pe@@ aks .
and how exactly will amaz@@ on make money of it ?
it is hard to imagine that t@@ wit@@ ch is as elegant in amaz@@ on inst@@ ant video as it is in you@@ tube .
but t@@ wit@@ ch has something that every company would like : thousands of young men who work as advertis@@ ers .
as the chairman of t@@ wit@@ ch , she@@ ar , said , amaz@@ on and t@@ wit@@ ch &quot; both believe in the future of gaming , &quot; and the medium shows no signs of a weak economy .
on the h@@ ü@@ p@@ f@@ burg at the bur@@ g@@ gar@@ ten festival there was quite a lot of fun on saturday .
the organis@@ ers &apos; concept was correct .
despite the strong rain cast on saturday evening , the estimated 3@@ ,000 people were killed .
at times , the entry had to be stopped .
&quot; that was an@@ no@@ ying , &quot; said ron se@@ m , one of the organiz@@ ers .
sal@@ z@@ we@@ del l light and fun .
two spanish words have been translated by ma@@ xi@@ m s@@ ach@@ ra@@ j and ron se@@ m .
the open air in the sal@@ z@@ we@@ del@@ er bur@@ g@@ gar@@ ten is intended to show bri@@ ght@@ ness during the day and in the evening through various shows .
well , and the fun comes from alone anyway .
this was demonstrated early on saturday when the first visitors came to the open air .
a celebr@@ ation for all generations had promised the organiz@@ ers .
and they have succeeded .
around the supply st@@ alls on the bur@@ g@@ gar@@ ten me@@ ado@@ w , sal@@ z@@ we@@ del@@ er , but also guests from the nearby and further surroundings had made themselves comfortable .
they followed the first live performances , wi@@ pp@@ y with the foot in the pul@@ se , enjoyed cool drinks and were able to relax pure and deli@@ ght .
and the whole thing across the generations .
while some people are looking for blan@@ kets on the extra car@@ ved white sand at the beach bar , others are lying on a quarter of wine in the vin@@ o@@ the@@ que , they r@@ aged around the next day .
but also in the case of child shr@@ in@@ king , the volunte@@ ers had a good hand to play .
the larger ones used the k@@ ick@@ er tables or took part in a sk@@ ate@@ board workshop that the good@@ foot@@ -@@ crew had organized from sal@@ z@@ we@@ del .
until the big rain came .
shortly before 5.@@ 30 p.m. he was pus@@ hing the visitors to the front , especially families were looking for the wide and dry .
but the attr@@ acti@@ veness of the festival did not break this .
&quot; more people than expected , &quot; said ron se@@ m , who was driven by a &quot; success all over the line &quot; .
therefore , there is no doubt that next year &apos;s great party will be repeated .
although there is a lot of work to be done on the content and size of the event , se@@ m made a clear statement on sunday in relation to the popular vote .
it was an@@ no@@ ying that in the meantime the invitation was stopped .
obviously , the security company was booked with too little effort .
the result is that some who had already paid no longer came to the site .
the response is very good .
in a first careful es@@ timate , the sal@@ z@@ we@@ de@@ ler co-@@ organiz@@ er spoke of about 1@@ 200 visitors who were in the tu@@ m garden .
there were problems with sound technology .
the sal@@ z@@ we@@ del@@ er hi@@ p-@@ hop band bloc@@ k@@ s@@ `@@ n@@ `@@ ro@@ x bro@@ ke their appearance therefore un@@ ner@@ ved .

&quot; next year , you will be there , &quot; said the organiz@@ er .
the premi@@ ere of the am@@ u@@ la@@ -@@ open-@@ air was a great success for the visitors .
and that in bad weather .
however , the organis@@ ers have made some mistakes , which were dela@@ yed the first time , but the second edition elimin@@ ates them .
in the social network fac@@ e@@ book , the organiz@@ ers must also include critique .
&quot; sorry , but for twelve euros you simply expected more &quot; , says mel@@ ani@@ e me@@ i@@ er on the event page .
&quot; you have a little taken on , &quot; says e@@ le zim@@ mer@@ mann at the same place .
others see the initial problems not quite as narrow .
i think it is very good that some people are not only st@@ up@@ id but also really trying to get something on their feet .
i am not sure if you would be interested in the new version of the game , but i am sure you will find it here .
now the organis@@ ers have one year to make these critic@@ isms .
new rad@@ om in ber@@ k@@ um : w@@ ach@@ t@@ berg &apos;s land@@ mark shr@@ in@@ ks
this is not as expected .
instead , the part is waiting to be inser@@ ted into the distinc@@ tive structure .
the action is in the context of a major measure : almost 50 years after the establishment of the space surveillance rad@@ ar ti@@ ra , the case , the so-called rad@@ om , is completely renewed .
the new rad@@ om is equipped with a di@@ ameter of 4@@ 7.@@ 5 meters , slightly smaller than the old one .
the size remains world records , however .
the last step to complete the new en@@ velo@@ pe is the cap@@ ping exchange .
the upper quarter of the old case is separated and separated with a cr@@ ane .
after that , the last quarter of the new en@@ velo@@ pe will be put on .
if the weather is good , the action will start at the beginning of this week .

i wanted to close my mouth , but that did not go , the ja@@ ws were ha@@ ted , and then i understood that something was wrong .
my mother and my si@@ ster saw this and they were lau@@ gh@@ ing at lau@@ gh@@ ing almost in their tr@@ ous@@ ers , but i had to go into emergency .
the 20 year old from britain was brought to the hospital to see the ja@@ ws after taking part in the vir@@ al trend of tuesday .

pul@@ l the clubs of bur@@ gun@@ dy back on the same foot@@ ing ?
finally , there was a constant dispute between the two wol@@ fr@@ at@@ sha@@ user bur@@ g@@ vere@@ ine .
now the boards think about possible cooperation .
as an example for the reconstruction of the wol@@ fr@@ at@@ sha@@ us@@ er castle , the late richard di@@ mb@@ ath , former chief executive of the wol@@ fr@@ at@@ sha@@ us@@ er bur@@ g@@ fre@@ un@@ de , led the project in the french gu@@ é@@ del@@ on .
a year ago , there was no good climate between the castle club and the friends of wol@@ fr@@ at@@ sha@@ us@@ en .
the most varied positions that have been taken up so far have seemed to be how to deal with the history of wol@@ fr@@ at@@ sha@@ u castle and possible reconstruction .
now the two camps are moving towards one another : talks are to be held soon on a common approach .
the association ’ s boards of directors confirm this by supporting tor@@ ste@@ n s@@ j@@ ö@@ berg ( bur@@ g@@ vere@@ in ) and her@@ bert pi@@ ff@@ l ( friends of the castle ) on request from our newspaper .
&quot; i have listened to mr pi@@ ff@@ l and i have proposed that we could sit down together once , &quot; says s@@ j@@ ö@@ berg .
he believes that all members of both clubs could be on the same w@@ av@@ el@@ eng@@ th in the future .
thus , visible succ@@ esses can be achieved faster .
while the friends of the castle were wor@@ ried about the su@@ dden dec@@ eas@@ ed richard di@@ mb@@ ath until the last reconstruction of the castle on the mountain forest , the castle club around s@@ j@@ ö@@ berg is the &quot; opening and experience &quot; .
her@@ bert pi@@ ff@@ l , the second chairman of the friends of the bur@@ gun@@ dy , has been very pleased , according to his own information about the call .
since di@@ mb@@ ad ’ s death , he has been standing up to his friends in the castle .
a new chairman is due to be found in a general meeting in mid-@@ september .
currently , the association counts around 40 members according to the 7@@ 4-@@ year-@@ old .
&quot; after the death of my friend richard di@@ mb@@ ath , we have the association &apos;s activities from respect to ru@@ in first &quot; .
according to pi@@ ff@@ l , the new chairman will then be invited to talk to the bur@@ g@@ vere@@ in .
until then , the bur@@ gun@@ dy friends could also have a current mo@@ od within their group .
to nom@@ in@@ ate a candidate for the presidency is not yet available , says pi@@ ff@@ l .
&quot; but i am confident that someone will find himself &quot; , he does not want to stand for himself because he is resid@@ ent in bad t@@ ö@@ l@@ z .
the new chair should be a wol@@ fr@@ at@@ sha@@ us@@ er .
the t@@ ö@@ l@@ zer wo@@ ol is going to be involved in the project &quot; but very happy to continue working &quot; .
the differences of opinion on reconstruction are , in pi@@ ff@@ ls ’ view , likely to remain in the near future .
he comm@@ ends di@@ mb@@ ath as a &quot; mis@@ sion@@ ary &quot; who has always believed in the reconstruction of the castle .
two similar , already advanced projects in austria and france would show that the latter is not a sh@@ ining m@@ ess .
the high participation of the population and voluntary workers from all over the world make them a tourist attr@@ action .
pi@@ ff@@ l : &quot; i too was s@@ cep@@ tical at the beginning .
but over time i am more and more convinced that the european union should be able to support the project &quot; .
there is nothing else here .
moreover , the project would be funded by eu grants , visitor tickets and potential spon@@ sors .
&quot; the idea of reconstruction is something i personally do not want to throw out &quot; , he hopes that the bur@@ g@@ vere@@ in will perhaps be a little bit moving on this point .
their goal to first document history is &quot; to be important and good &quot; .
then we could go on .
cle@@ ver ways to save money at uni@@ -@@ tex@@ t@@ books .
since the cost of university tex@@ t@@ books is more than $ 1@@ ,000 per year for many students , the fac@@ t-@@ two-@@ year fa@@ st-@@ sem@@ ester student , mat@@ t sch@@ ro@@ e@@ der , considered a cle@@ ver spread .
he inven@@ ted a lo@@ an system for books by students of higher sem@@ ester and offered a nom@@ inal compensation to help them find a way back .
&quot; my mathem@@ a@@ tics book usually costs $ 18@@ 0 , but i got it for $ 10 for a sem@@ ester and a ch@@ ick fil@@ -@@ a-@@ ke@@ k , &quot; said sch@@ ro@@ e@@ der , 19 , who had the co@@ ven@@ ant .
the time allocated to the last sem@@ ester would have saved him $ 4@@ 30 , he said .
he gave $ 120 out .
the collection management informed with that the student in average 5 hours of the course , and the students were able to get a basic education for the study books and material , but the students had to pay for various cost reduction options .
online stores and creative approaches such as the sc@@ ro@@ ed@@ ers are increasingly the solution to the choice for students .
the ren@@ ting of tex@@ t@@ books is becoming more popular , and students can use a book for a sem@@ ester , often at a much lower price than when they buy it .
ne@@ e@@ bo inc , which holds more than 250 university book@@ stores , parti@@ ci@@ pa@@ tes in the fact that ren@@ ting tex@@ t@@ books has been slow since 2011 .
surve@@ ys in the industry show that around a quarter of books in the college book@@ stores in the past spring ’ s sem@@ ester were ren@@ ted , said ne@@ e@@ bo@@ s vice-president of te@@ v@@ or me@@ yer .
less than half of all tex@@ t@@ books are published by the trade association national association of college stores in camp@@ us .
here is the one time for the best deals .
online shopping online
some new books cost online only one third of the price for which they are available in the camp@@ us book@@ shop .
the n@@ in@@ th edition of &quot; calcul@@ us &quot; v@@ no ron lar@@ won , bru@@ ce ed@@ war@@ ds and robert ho@@ ff@@ et@@ ler costs almost 2@@ 90 $ , but can be ordered at the specialized tex@@ t@@ book re@@ tail@@ er che@@ gg@@ .com for 23@@ rd .
used buy used buy

&quot; calcul@@ us &quot; is used on che@@ gg@@ .com for 9@@ 3.@@ 49 $ .
mat@@ t cas@@ ag@@ day , 25 , gradu@@ ate student at bri@@ g@@ ham young university , says that the student is on amaz@@ on@@ .com 42 c@@ ents .
the book was sold for $ 48 .
aca@@ dem@@ ics such as ing@@ rid br@@ ac@@ ey , head of the university of mass@@ ach@@ us@@ et@@ ts at am@@ her@@ st college without any wall@@ s. she recommended that students should be present with their prof@@ ess@@ ors if they have previously been eligible .
sometimes the updates for the seminar work are not relevant .
in such cases , older expenditure can often be spent for a fr@@ action of the cost of the latest issue .
besides che@@ g@@ g and amaz@@ on , hal@@ f@@ .com is also available from e@@ bay inc as a popular alternative for used books .
ren@@ ting a car
the ren@@ ting of tex@@ t@@ books is worth considering if you want to make it reason@@ ably well , remember to return it and you will have to pay the books after the course has been completed .
you can save more than 80 % of the costs of a new book .
a student could , for example , use &quot; calcul@@ us &quot; for the duration of a sem@@ ester for about $ 20 .
find out about the terms of the business when you rent , also about the penalties , the costs of the rental , if applicable , for writing notes , under@@ lining or used p@@ acking .
ren@@ ter note : if you do not return the book , the penalty fees may be the price of a new book .
e-@@ books
also , e-@@ books instead of traditional tex@@ t@@ books are an option .
sometimes these books are ren@@ ted de fac@@ to by using an electronic license for a certain period of time by whol@@ es@@ al@@ ers such as amaz@@ on@@ .com , che@@ g@@ g and bar@@ nes &amp; no@@ ble inc@@ . . .
at che@@ g@@ g you can choose &quot; calcul@@ us &quot; for 6 months for about 61 $ .
br@@ ac@@ ey says that students in liter@@ ary courses often have the best offers , as many classi@@ cs are downloaded free of charge nowadays , while scientific and engineering teachers are very expensive .
to look around , in any case .
jo@@ e ga@@ ult , 29 , who will soon be the pe@@ p@@ per@@ d@@ ine law school , recomm@@ ends that the is@@ b@@ n number for the price determination at b@@ ü@@ cher , as it is so safe to be the right tex@@ t@@ book .
and before or@@ dering online you should check , so ga@@ ult says , if the book is actually in stock .
this lesson he learned on the hard tour .
he bought a book that delivered four weeks and paid for it the full price in the college building .
why &quot; guar@@ di@@ ans of the gal@@ ax@@ y &quot; no cash raid was made ?
&quot; the exp@@ and@@ ab@@ les 3 &quot; by sy@@ l@@ ves@@ ter st@@ all@@ one played less than 30 million dollars of its 90 million dollars budget in the us , while &quot; s@@ in city : a lady to k@@ ill for &quot; was only 12 million dollars .
the c@@ cd camera , tailored to camer@@ on di@@ a@@ z , is a feature film that was released on the opening weekend , with only $ 14@@ .@@ 6 million , while children &apos;s films such as &quot; drag@@ on hei@@ ghts easily make 2 &quot; also .
an article of the te@@ leg@@ raph movie cri@@ tic rob@@ bi@@ e col@@ lin suggests that the film was not a success in children &apos;s films .
col@@ lin called 20@@ 14 the worst year , but so far it has been the worst year for children &apos;s films , and described &quot; drag@@ on hei@@ ghts easily made 2 &quot; as purely &quot; functional &quot; fant@@ as@@ y continuation .
in films for a slightly older target group , however , it seems that the quality of the films does not necessarily pose the problem .
in july , entertainment weekend compared the first half of the average cinem@@ as@@ co@@ res and me@@ tac@@ ri@@ tic evaluation for each summer movie start , which took place between the american mem@@ orial day and the 20th of july 2013 and the current year .
the results are based on the opinion of the cinema visitors and film cri@@ tics , and suggest that the film festival will be held this year &apos;s more similar to last year &apos;s .
some comm@@ ent@@ ators believe that development is due to changing visual hab@@ its and the growing popul@@ arity of web stre@@ aming services .
director j@@ on fav@@ re@@ au , who is currently working on dis@@ ney &apos;s upcoming jun@@ g@@ le book movie , is saying to the website h@@ ul@@ l of ho@@ ll@@ y@@ wood re@@ porter : &quot; i think the times are changing . &quot;
we must accept this and not try to follow the past .
unlike the current weak cash out@@ comes of the ho@@ ll@@ y@@ wood produc@@ tions , net f@@ li@@ x has recently achieved a record tur@@ nover of € 3@@ 9.@@ 9 billion with stre@@ aming content .
last summer , the director ste@@ ven spi@@ el@@ berg cri@@ tici@@ zed the film studios for not being too focused on film making by com@@ ic films .
in the light of the current down@@ turn , some comm@@ ent@@ ators argue that its glo@@ om@@ y pro@@ ph@@ ec@@ y may well be a real core .
the financial crisis that is expected in the summer of 20@@ 15 , including aven@@ gers , means that the age of ul@@ tr@@ on , mini@@ ons , and jur@@ as@@ sic world are other representatives of the film industry , however , more optim@@ istic :
the producer of x-@@ men , sim@@ on kin@@ berg , described the decline in the cash flow recently as simply &quot; cy@@ clic@@ al &quot; and said to ho@@ ll@@ y@@ wood records .
when the second table tennis tournament area was opened a few years ago in order to stre@@ am@@ line the league classi@@ fication , it was a step in the right direction .
now the german table tennis association has an additional 3rd bun@@ des@@ lig@@ a .
the result : if you have not clim@@ bed , you have gone down .
for example , g@@ ö@@ tt@@ ingen &apos;s highest team tor@@ pe@@ do has won the top team in the ob@@ er@@ lig@@ a release but plays in the upcoming season .
the fourth classi@@ fication of tor@@ pe@@ do &apos;s ladies , despite their gran@@ di@@ ose mar@@ gin into the regional league .
the bo@@ ys and girls of tor@@ pe@@ do start at the lower sa@@ x@@ ony league , as well as the bo@@ ys of the s@@ c weekend .
s@@ g leng@@ ler@@ n and tor@@ pe@@ do reserves are in the new com@@ posi@@ tional league .
the tt@@ v is playing ge@@ is@@ mar in the association list .
what is the composition of a better district class , is now the new district class .
here t@@ sv s@@ eu@@ ling@@ en , v@@ f@@ b l@@ ö@@ d@@ ing@@ sen , tor@@ pe@@ do iii , ge@@ is@@ mar , ein@@ bec@@ k , ham@@ men@@ ste@@ dt , bo@@ ven@@ der sv , lan@@ gen@@ hol@@ ten@@ sen , f@@ c .

in the district sli@@ ga start tor@@ pe@@ do iii and sat@@ ten@@ haus@@ en / w@@ ö@@ ll@@ mar@@ sha@@ us@@ en .
with nine teams each , the team will be the best in the world with nine teams of all .
the s@@ c weekend sen@@ ds his girls to the small district sli@@ ga .
the district sli@@ ga rela@@ y rela@@ y of the sc@@ w bo@@ ys - tor@@ pe@@ do ii is still starting - is not complete .
in a district class , ge@@ is@@ mar , tus@@ po weekend and the bo@@ ven@@ der s@@ v go to the season .
in the first season of the newly established regional association , the two go@@ d@@ d@@ esses of g@@ ö@@ tt@@ ingen with nine teams start .
in the west season , the red and white ii , bo@@ ven@@ der sv iii , are lau@@ bach ii , tor@@ pe@@ do iv and v , m@@ tv gr@@ one , d@@ ran@@ s@@ fel@@ der s@@ c ii , mi@@ el@@ en@@ haus@@ en .
in the eastern season , the band includes sat@@ ten@@ haus@@ en / w@@ ö@@ ll@@ mar@@ sha@@ us@@ en , ni@@ ko@@ la@@ us@@ berg and land@@ ol@@ f@@ sha@@ us@@ en .
the women ’ s circle sli@@ ga is made up of sat@@ ten@@ haus@@ en / w@@ ö@@ ll@@ mar@@ sha@@ us@@ en ii , bil@@ sha@@ us@@ en , hem@@ el@@ n , s@@ eu@@ ling@@ en ii , tus@@ po weekend and s@@ g r@@ hu@@ me .
that is still better than in the eas@@ ter circle , where it is not possible to have women teams at the k@@ v@@ p .
what is striking is that none of the six circle classes is set to be set , here the innovative and thr@@ illing circu@@ lar board will have to start thinking about .

anti-@@ government pro@@ tests in pakistan are es@@ cal@@ ating
the approximately 1000 demonstr@@ ators were killed by soldiers from the p@@ tv building , said informa@@ tion@@ s@@ minister per@@ v@@ ai@@ z r@@ as@@ hi@@ d .
the station has been closed for more than half an hour .
p@@ tv director ath@@ ar far@@ o@@ o@@ q said that with stic@@ ks equipped demonstr@@ ators who had equipment in the re@@ days of the ed@@ it@@ orial .
dead or in@@ ju@@ red have not been reported .
the demonstr@@ ators are calling for the re@@ sign@@ ation of the government , to whom they are acc@@ using of electoral fraud .
the police informed us that about a kil@@ ome@@ tre from the residence of prime minister na@@ wa@@ z shar@@ if was at the end of monday , or even in the middle of the evening , some 3@@ 000 demonstr@@ ators met with security forces .
according to hospital information , a polic@@ em@@ an was in@@ ju@@ red .
at the weekend , at least three people were killed and more than 500 in@@ ju@@ red , when demonstr@@ ators tried to return to shar@@ if ’ s residence .
they call for the re@@ sign@@ ation of the prime minister .
the powerful military had a strong presence in the united states on sunday evening after a meeting in the army headquarters .
it was also stated in the communication that the army is still committed to its role of protecting the security of the state .
the es@@ cal@@ ating violence has led to concern about military intervention .

h@@ ü@@ t@@ tel@@ dor@@ fer after second season victory at the table three .
the 2 : 0 above gr@@ ö@@ di@@ g has a bit@@ ter week for rapid on sunday a conc@@ ili@@ atory end .
&quot; the victory is very liber@@ ating , &quot; said tra@@ iner z@@ or@@ an b@@ ari@@ sic , whose team with the out in the europe league on thursday an intermedi@@ ate low .
&quot; the success experience was un@@ can@@ ny important &quot; , confirmed the first captain of the team and the goal sho@@ o@@ ter ste@@ ff@@ en ho@@ f@@ mann , who was in place with green white at the third place .
sch@@ ram@@ mel@@ -@@ dre@@ am@@ tor brings rapid progress to sie@@ ger@@ stra@@ ß@@ e rapid with the second season victory the right response to the dis@@ appointment against hel@@ sin@@ ki and goes with a successful result experience .
&quot; we wanted to show a positive response , &quot; said foreign minister thomas sch@@ ram@@ me@@ l , who , with his splendid leadership vol@@ ley of the six@@ teenth century , was the soft spot for victory .
&quot; i thought i was going to have all the fru@@ stration of thursday in my hands and i was s@@ nor@@ ing him under the bar , &quot; said the 2@@ 6-@@ year-@@ old s@@ mil@@ ing .
as a shr@@ ink on the 13@@ th nov@@ member 2010 for the last time in a bun@@ des@@ lig@@ a match , the race was still scheduled for ried .
the first championship hit in the rapid d@@ ress will therefore be given to him in special memory .
&quot; for me this is something special , i am from the rapid after@@ -@@ growth &quot; , said sch@@ ram@@ m@@ me@@ l .
due to the short term b@@ ess@@ er of mari@@ o pa@@ ve@@ lic , sch@@ ra@@ m@@ me@@ l moved from the left to the right def@@ ensive side and made even there his cause very well .
he has enough experience to maintain this position .
the gate he has earned , he has already had some assi@@ sts this year , &quot; p@@ raised b@@ ari@@ sic .
team shows character sch@@ ram@@ me@@ l also delivered the f@@ lan@@ k to 2 : 0 by ho@@ f@@ mann after just over an hour , which finally brought the decision .
for before that , the guests could have written as well .
&quot; thank god we have been lu@@ cky today , &quot; also noted sch@@ ram@@ me@@ l , who has thus respon@@ ded to the cl@@ inging of performance and result in recent weeks .
b@@ ari@@ sic was even in the mo@@ od that &quot; in many games you had been better before today &quot; - against &quot; the strong@@ est team that was in this season at this sta@@ dium &quot; .
the first three-@@ point since 26 july has therefore proved that the team fab@@ ric is the set@@ back for the long time being int@@ act : &quot; today my team has shown that it is character . &quot;
for him no less pleas@@ ing : &quot; that we finally have to play back to zero &quot; .
a lot of work during the national p@@ ause also the fact that with bri@@ an beh@@ ren@@ dt , mari@@ o pa@@ ve@@ lic , chri@@ stop@@ her di@@ bon , den@@ i al@@ ar and michael sch@@ imp@@ el@@ s@@ ber@@ ger several em@@ ail@@ s .
&quot; we must not forget that , &quot; bar@@ i@@ sic war@@ ned , who has been in contact with beh@@ ren@@ dt and pa@@ ve@@ li@@ c players for the last three days , &quot; who recently had very stable players . &quot;
the national p@@ ause must therefore be used to ensure &quot; w@@ ounds to lic@@ k and to stay healthy in the physical world &quot; .
one to which the break is probably particularly appropriate is captain ho@@ f@@ mann .
it is te@@ aring itself apart for the team , it goes beyond pain .
it is precisely at this difficult stage that he has shown that he is a very important player for us , &quot; according to bar@@ i@@ sic .
ho@@ f@@ mann gave the game rapi@@ ds before his ex@@ change@@ -@@ over in the 6@@ 8@@ th minute not only the structure but also achieved the second goal .
for the 3@@ 3-@@ year-@@ old who has his 3@@ 50@@ th bun@@ des@@ lig@@ a game , it was the first hit from the game since 2nd november 2013 ( 4 : 2 above the ad@@ mi@@ ra ) .
ho@@ f@@ mann : &quot; must not believe that everything is good now &quot; &quot; we certainly also have a bit of lu@@ ck , but eventually the lu@@ ck must also return to us .
it was high time , &quot; said ho@@ f@@ mann .
he war@@ ned that concentrated power would be needed : &quot; you cannot leave it to the black and white .
we have not seen such a bad performance in recent weeks as has been shown .
we must not , however , believe that everything is good now .
the importance of his role for the team was un@@ den@@ i@@ able .
it is a very young team , to whom i am very able to help at the moment .
they are in some stages , after all , stic@@ king to me , &quot; said ho@@ f@@ mann .
val gar@@ den@@ a co@@ ach michael bau@@ r had little to re@@ pro@@ ach himself and his team .
he regre@@ t@@ ted the rapid opposite reaction from the sp@@ ell@@ er category , as well as the regular door of nu@@ tz in the 40@@ th minute , which was collected by re@@ fe@@ ree un@@ ju@@ stly un@@ recognized .
the only acc@@ us@@ ation i can make to the team is that we are heading for tor in some stages not sufficiently concrete .
we have too few accounts .
internal def@@ enders maxim@@ ili@@ an kar@@ ner saw it in a similar way : &quot; it just started badly , but then we found it in plain and even made a gate .
by and large , it would have been more in it .
under this ar@@ row , ru@@ h re@@ ign@@ s , ru@@ h , and ru@@ h , the wind is in the air .
a powerful tri@@ be was shown at our en@@ ig@@ matic task of the summer series &quot; my piece of the rh@@ ö@@ ner lu@@ ck &quot; last friday .
several of these giant trees are still in the district , the illustra@@ ted copy is the &quot; ge@@ is@@ ru@@ he@@ ic@@ he &quot; above the lower white giant foun@@ tain .

vital sees the natural mon@@ ument , it rises above the other trees of the area and remin@@ ds with a volume of over eight meters of an american m@@ am@@ mo@@ th tree .
a small bud@@ d@@ ha on a tree st@@ um@@ p indicates that there are many different spiritual and spiritual ways to live .
but , despite intensive research , there were only references to the name origin .
dr. wol@@ f@@ gan@@ g sch@@ nei@@ der has created the bis@@ ch@@ of@@ sh@@ ei@@ m archive and has invited older people from the under@@ white brun@@ n to know what is in it with the spiritual s@@ cour@@ ge .
the result of his research remained the rather so@@ ber explanation for the name .
so , up to 80 years ago , go@@ at she@@ ph@@ er@@ ds were supposed to be able to feed their animals from under@@ white brun@@ n to the lab@@ ori@@ ously gru@@ b@@ bed and fre@@ ed of stones .
at the foot of the tree , the clim@@ b hei@@ ghten@@ ed ke@@ ep@@ ers should have re@@ st@@ led .
the area has now reg@@ a@@ ined its importance , because there are actually go@@ at her@@ ds on the me@@ ado@@ ws .
the area is also part of the core zone of the bio@@ sphere reserve , has been further developed by sch@@ nei@@ der .
when entering the stone collections , you should be careful not to use the stone as the sun &apos;s war@@ med up bas@@ alt is a very good place for crus@@ ad@@ ers .

after weeks of tu@@ g-@@ of-@@ war , italy ’ s premier and eu president , mat@@ te@@ o ren@@ zi , has resi@@ sted strong conservative opposition at the eu special summit last week .
ren@@ zi considers how to use the daily la re@@ pub@@ b@@ lic@@ a , which is close to government , to proc@@ la@@ im its name also in the governing team as a favorite .
he also exp@@ ects an impe@@ tus from this for his &apos; reform package &apos; in italy .
last but not least , ren@@ zi hopes that the anti-@@ him / her party ’ s constant opposition will be able to put a stop to this , because mo@@ gh@@ er@@ ini will not accept this , albeit more moderate , form .
i have a strong case against conservative representatives with commission president je@@ an-@@ cla@@ ude jun@@ ck@@ er and the polish president , don@@ ald tus@@ k , who was nom@@ inated as president of the council , in order to achieve political compensation .
because the chief diplom@@ at of the eu will also be depu@@ ty to president jun@@ ck@@ er .
the agreement by the european parliament , which is still pending , is considered to be safe .
otherwise , president gi@@ or@@ gio na@@ polit@@ ano would have rejected the nom@@ ination of the 4@@ 1@@ year-@@ old politici@@ an in the ruling democratic party ( p@@ d ) , &quot; no great recognition &quot; of italy &apos;s role in the eu .
la re@@ pub@@ b@@ lic@@ a spre@@ ads optim@@ ism that the reforms that have been carried out in leading party posts for almost two decades and which have been well known for their ambition are going to meet the &apos; enormous challenges &apos; .
the roman catho@@ lic church is married and has a two-@@ year-@@ old daughter .
her party career began with a doc@@ tor@@ ate in political science from 1996 .
in 1999 , mo@@ gh@@ er@@ ini was appointed vice-president of the european community organisation of society for three years .
with the election in 2001 to the party council of lef@@ t-@@ wing democrats , it became involved in party politics , worked in the foreign policy department , whose leader was soon to become .
she occupied traditional focus of italian foreign policy , such as the middle east , was replaced by studies on nato ’ s dep@@ loy@@ ment in afghanistan , in which italy is involved with a cont@@ ingent of troops , maintained contacts with the european social democrats and the european democrats .
since 2008 she has been a member of the chamber of depu@@ ties , where she is an expert on defence and european and international affairs .
when ren@@ zi was premi@@ ered in february 20@@ 14 , he called mo@@ gh@@ er@@ ini to his foreign minister , and he was a member of the government .
if the p@@ d is to have a better relationship with the strong peace movement in the country today , which is one of the more than 40 % of the party ’ s vote in the eu elections in may , then , as noted in p@@ d cir@@ cles , i have been .
i am not in favour of the acc@@ us@@ ations in brussels that the new eu external en@@ vo@@ y has too little diplomatic experience , so the p@@ d is failing .
in brussels , the european union is taking action , particularly by poland and the baltic members , in a mi@@ str@@ ust of realistic acc@@ ents by mo@@ gh@@ er@@ ini on the crisis in ukraine , and is being dis@@ missed as a &apos; pro-@@ russia course &apos; .
it supports the russian company ga@@ z@@ pro@@ m &apos;s pipel@@ ine , south stream , which is currently under discussion by russian gas , by@@ passing the ukraine .
after ren@@ zi took office as eu president in july , the eu was travelling to moscow to visit the country for her first state visit .

the president deserves everyone &apos;s respect , he deserves our loy@@ alty , he deserves our support .
&quot; it is our duty to stay with him , &quot; he said with great applause .
as a appe@@ aling ge@@ st@@ ure , the prime minister insi@@ sted that his government should not accept the controversial 3@@ 5-@@ hour week in france despite strong calls for a relaxation of the scheme by em@@ manu@@ el mac@@ ron , the new economic minister .
on saturday , mr hol@@ lan@@ de ur@@ ged his fellow socialists to &apos; un@@ ite &apos; with the government .

marine le pen , the far right leader of the national front , ri@@ dic@@ ul@@ ed the constant ri@@ gging of socialists and said that the government was not prepared to accept that the new un val@@ ves government would last longer than a few months .
fran@@ co@@ is hol@@ lan@@ de is the emper@@ or without clothes , but prin@@ ce manu@@ el v@@ alls has no , they are forced to build a new government , if the old one does not even survive a summer .
&quot; and the new will also fall or winter will not survive , &quot; said fr@@ ä@@ u@@ le@@ in le pen towards sup@@ porters .
she repeated her party &apos;s call for a dis@@ solution of parliament and said she was confident that , in early elections , it would be the winner , and that she would be ready for government .
the french ruling party has suffered a defe@@ at in the local elections .

&quot; there is a small window for possibilities , but public opinion must feel quickly that things are changing , &quot; war@@ ned .

putin demands ki@@ e@@ v to accept &quot; state@@ hood talks &quot; with the o@@ st@@ ú@@ kra@@ ine .
russian president v@@ la@@ di@@ mir putin demanded russian media reports that on sunday , the russian authorities would not allow the fighting to be won by the separ@@ ati@@ sts in the east of the country and start negotiations on the &apos; state@@ hood &apos; of the russian federation .
his spo@@ kes@@ man , di@@ mit@@ ri pes@@ ko@@ v , later made it clear that putin did not mean that the system would be under the control of the separ@@ ati@@ sts .
putin ’ s call for ki@@ e@@ v ’ s government to negotiate on an equal foot@@ ing with pro-@@ russian insur@@ g@@ ents , however , f@@ its in with the policy that he has apparently pursued since the ri@@ ots began five months ago : to help the separ@@ ati@@ st areas .
in an interview with the state television channel e@@ ins , putin condemned the ukra@@ inian military campaign to re@@ con@@ qu@@ er the separ@@ ati@@ st forces .
the kre@@ m@@ lin and separ@@ ati@@ sts have recently rejected the territory taken as a &apos; new state &apos; .
putin pointed out that all those who had been killed in the campaigns ukra@@ inian politicians are now in a state of emergency for the 26 october elections , and while government groups are building civilian communities in the areas held by separ@@ ati@@ sts .
&quot; we must start a detailed discussion immediately , not only on technical issues , but also on the political organisation of society and state status of south-@@ eastern ukraine , in order to protect the interests of the people living there , &quot; he said .
pes@@ ko@@ v said that putin ’ s reference to the state@@ hood in the context of greater autonomy was to be seen , which has been supported for months by ki@@ e@@ v ’ s leadership , to avoid fears in rus@@ si@@ an-@@ speaking areas .
only the ukra@@ inian government can provide the eastern territories with the necessary autonomy , as pes@@ ko@@ v said .
this is not about negotiations between ukraine and russia , pes@@ ko@@ v said , &apos; because it is not a conflict between russia and ukraine &apos; , but about a internal conflict in the ukraine . &apos;
clari@@ fying the kre@@ m@@ lin speaker to correct the &quot; mis@@ interpretation &quot; of the &quot; pu@@ t@@ ins &quot; of putin &apos;s remarks highlighted the russian leadership requirement in dealing with separ@@ ati@@ st re@@ bel@@ lion in the east , unlike the direct an@@ ger .
moscow could have far greater difficulties in getting the don@@ et@@ sk and lu@@ han@@ sk regions to the eastern ukraine .
the autonomy enjoyed by russian diplom@@ ats at international forums is a matter of concern to regional governments in ukraine .
the agreement , anne@@ xed five months ago in the black sea , is the home port for the majority of russian mar@@ ines and a major trading port and historic coastal region .
the regions between the ro@@ sto@@ v region in russia and the cri@@ me@@ a are also rich in mines , fac@@ tories and foun@@ dri@@ es that are important components for the russian military .
the ukra@@ inian president , pe@@ tr@@ o por@@ o@@ sh@@ en@@ ko , suggested in his speech on june 7 that the ukra@@ inian government should , after new elections , approve addi@@ tions to the constitution .
but his idea of autonomy seems to be in sharp contrast to that of the kre@@ m@@ lin and the separ@@ ati@@ st re@@ be@@ ls , whose arm@@ ament and inc@@ iting violence are moscow &apos;s pre@@ dec@@ essor .
putin ’ s last call to ki@@ e@@ v to negotiate with separ@@ ati@@ st leaders on an equal foot@@ ing followed the us military ’ s further inv@@ asion of iraq .
the separ@@ ati@@ sts supported by russia took over in the fur@@ y of the gri@@ p that , according to fears of ukra@@ inian security officials , was the first step in a campaign to take over the coastal region until cri@@ me@@ a , control of nov@@ o@@ az@@ ov .
for this reason , massive civilian and military preparations have begun to prevent mari@@ u@@ pol , a stal@@ em@@ ate industry , from being forced into the hands of the population of 500 000 .
por@@ o@@ sh@@ en@@ ko spoke on saturday at a meeting of eu leaders in brussels and ur@@ ged action to prevent another russian aggres@@ sion against the ukraine .
&quot; we are on the ver@@ ge of a point where there is no going back , &quot; war@@ ned por@@ o@@ sh@@ en@@ ko .
thousands of foreign troops and hundreds of foreign tan@@ ks are now on the territory of ukraine .
the eu summit did not take any specific action to call for the leadership to draft further sanctions against russia , which would be justified in an un@@ specified es@@ cal@@ ation of the ukra@@ inian crisis .
ukra@@ inian soldiers had to move away from their positions in il@@ o@@ wa@@ j@@ sk after two russian tan@@ k colon@@ ies and 1@@ ,000 soldiers were killed in the don@@ et@@ sk region last week .
the first probably 63 ukra@@ inian soldiers who were killed by the russian inv@@ asion of il@@ o@@ wa@@ j@@ sk were arrested on sunday against 10 russian cas@@ u@@ al@@ ties .

the film works of pal@@ mer include &quot; love is inv@@ inci@@ ble &quot; with li@@ am hem@@ s@@ worth .
pal@@ mer , ch@@ uck star stra@@ ho@@ v@@ ski and ac@@ tress brow@@ ning from suc@@ ker pun@@ ch were available yesterday for comments on the h@@ acked images .

actors se@@ th ro@@ gen condemned the h@@ ack@@ er in his t@@ we@@ et : &quot; h@@ acked images from a hand@@ y to po@@ sting is nothing different from the sale of h@@ ack@@ er goods . &quot;
from a purely legal point of view , the proliferation of sto@@ len images should not be toler@@ ated .
cy@@ cli@@ sts , jo@@ gg@@ ers and hi@@ kers were on the big field mountain yesterday and they were able to reach the &quot; hil@@ fe für kre@@ b@@ sk@@ ran@@ ke children &quot; association .
the tour , which is a tor@@ tu@@ r for some , was a light training for others .
however , everyone agreed on one thing : it was fun .
thomas stu@@ dan@@ ski will have sle@@ pt well last night .
for the first time in his life , the chief of the ob@@ er@@ ur@@ sel@@ er bre@@ w@@ ery was driven yesterday by a bike on the fel@@ d@@ berg .
for the good purpose .
the small mus@@ cle cathe@@ ter can easily be removed , especially as the participation in the 8@@ th cycling on the large fel@@ d@@ berg is a matter of concern to him for the benefit of the association &quot; help for cancer children &quot; ( frankfurt ) .
a great thing .
&quot; i know now that i can do that - great ! &quot;
small pe@@ dal on the way in the apple cur@@ ve ?
ne@@ e , if i had stopped , would be out of ...
as thomas stu@@ dan@@ ski , who was responsible for the c@@ du in the ob@@ er@@ ur@@ sel@@ er city parliament , many of the 7@@ 18 participants died yesterday in the spring and came to the rescue .
others , by contrast , found it easier to cross the 11 km long distance between ho@@ he@@ mark and fel@@ d@@ berg .
nor@@ man di@@ e@@ ß@@ ner , for example .
the red color of the green politici@@ an from the kre@@ i@@ sta@@ g - red d@@ ress , red bike - made a big difference at the start on under@@ statement ( &quot; every lot of professionals , since is an@@ na@@ yed the goal !
he is also the track in a sli@@ de , as well as n@@ ina ku@@ hn , pres@@ s@@ es@@ pre@@ cher of the city of ob@@ er@@ ur@@ sel , who joined frank gr@@ ün@@ is@@ en on the way .
for the two tri@@ athle@@ tes , the &quot; fel@@ d@@ berg cycling &quot; was not necessarily a sporting challenge : &quot; this is about char@@ ity , since there we are happy to participate - a trip would have been easier today anyway .
on the way , they had met paul w@@ en@@ z@@ el from ob@@ er@@ re@@ i@@ f@@ en@@ berg .
the boy ( 12 ) was in the morning down to ob@@ er@@ ur@@ sel to return to the height straight away .
the frankfurt fl@@ ori@@ an zi@@ er@@ z had to leave at 9 a.m. in the sat@@ tel in the morning , &quot; made &quot; the field mountain two times , to be able to look home with fun .
the fun was also &quot; fr@@ it@@ ten@@ -@@ ton@@ i &quot; .
for the head of the ob@@ er@@ ur@@ sel@@ er k@@ ul@@ t@@ ki@@ os@@ k , cycling tours through the fel@@ d@@ berg are simply part of the package .
he had a very good start with his 6.@@ 5-@@ kil@@ ome@@ tre racing bike .
a cra@@ zy event .
for this purpose - and i am happy to do so - andre@@ as bal@@ z@@ ke said .
the dur@@ ch@@ tra@@ in@@ er@@ te main@@ zer says of itself that he is an &quot; ambitious racing cy@@ c@@ list &quot; .
he must be , because he was very familiar with the &quot; fix@@ ing wheel &quot; , which is also racing whe@@ els , but without swit@@ ching ...
the fact that it can be easily moved up without a wheel proved not only the 20 hi@@ kers who cross the white wall and the fo@@ o@@ th@@ old to the summit , but also a jo@@ gging path that leads to a cor@@ k .
ber@@ g@@ wat@@ ch@@ t@@ sch@@ ut@@ z professor vol@@ ker lis@@ ch@@ ke , who is working with his team , equipped with all@@ rad@@ -@@ bul@@ ly and qu@@ ad , for safety , said : &quot; the ken@@ n &quot; i from frankfurt , who knows .
the 7@@ 18 participants - and thus as many as ever - were divided into groups in the morning .
the hi@@ kers first at 9.@@ 30 a.m.
the first cy@@ cli@@ sts and run@@ ners followed at 10 o &apos;@@ clock .
five minutes later , the first mountain bi@@ kers set off .
b@@ ent han@@ sen , chairman of the association &quot; cycling on the great fel@@ d@@ berg &quot; , gave the star@@ t-@@ up comm@@ ands and wanted to give the participants a nice trip .
i hope that next year he will succeed in getting the track down to fel@@ d@@ berg to ensure participants are safe .
