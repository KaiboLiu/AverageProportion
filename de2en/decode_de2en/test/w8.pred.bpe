re@@ member@@ ing the very american ideal of labour rights as human rights and human rights
the congress members ke@@ ith el@@ lis@@ on and john le@@ w@@ is have tabled a legislative proposal to make trade unions a civil right .
&quot; just as trade unions die , the middle class jobs die , &quot; said el@@ lis@@ on , a democr@@ at from min@@ n@@ es@@ ot@@ a and depu@@ ty chairman of the progressive alliance of liber@@ als and democrats in congress .
i am therefore proud to be associated with the civil rights icon john le@@ w@@ is , the staff authorisation act .
this gr@@ ound@@ breaking law gives workers the same legal opportunities to discrimin@@ ate against trade unions as in other forms of discrimination - thus stop@@ ping anti-@@ trade union forces .
the addition of the national labour law to provide an opportunity for discrimin@@ ated workers to organise trade union representation is a way of protecting the workers in a civil court for justice - and to compens@@ ate for damages or penalties .
but it is certainly not a radical initiative - at least not according to american standards .
indeed , the best way to understand what el@@ lis@@ on , le@@ w@@ is , and other spon@@ sors of their bill suggest is to re@@ connect back to a very american idea .
despite the set@@ backs that trade unions have suffered in recent years - in wis@@ con@@ s@@ in , mic@@ hi@@ gan and other countries throughout the country - americans once treated countries around the world as encouraging to exercise labor rights .
there was a time when millions of americans still remember when this country was demanding democracy , freedom of speech , freedom of the press and the right of association in the same bre@@ ath .
when the united states occupied japan after world war ii , general dou@@ gl@@ as mac ar@@ th@@ ur and his staff encouraged the country to adopt a constitution that would ensure that the united states ’ milit@@ ar@@ ised auto@@ cr@@ acy he@@ d@@ ged he@@ d@@ ki .
fully aware that workers and their trade unions are helping to create a new japan , they used a language that ex@@ on@@ er@@ ates explicitly recognised , that &quot; the rights of workers on unification and common re@@ negotiation and action .
when the united states occupied germany after world war ii , general d@@ wi@@ ght david e@@ is@@ en@@ ho@@ wer and his staff ur@@ ged the german@@ s to write a constitution that would ensure that fas@@ c@@ ism was ad@@ ol@@ f hit@@ ler ’ s democracy .
recogn@@ izing that workers would have to organize , and their voice in the new nation , the eu ’ s german@@ s added a clause explicitly calling for the creation of a “ national right ” .
agreements that restrict or aim to restrict this right should be seen as n@@ ul@@ l and vo@@ id , aimed at measures that are illegal and un@@ law@@ ful .
when the former first lady ele@@ an@@ or roo@@ se@@ vel@@ t presid@@ ed over the international commission on human rights , which was the general declaration of human rights , as it was drafted by the united nations in 194@@ 8 as a global agreement .
for generations , americans have accepted the basic pre@@ mise that labour rights are human rights .
when this country was discussing how to prevent civil and democratic societies , it was the americans who said that the right to create a trade union - and that it was the trade union that was then involved in collective negotiations as equal partners .
after these rights have been under attack in america , it is indeed very wise to look again at the american ideal , which means that the working population must have the right to un@@ ite and to live in a free and open society .
as pa@@ st@@ or martin lu@@ ther king j@@ r. said 50 years ago :
history is a great teacher .
now everyone knows that the workers &apos; movement did not limit the strength of the nation , but increased it .
by raising the standard of living of millions of people , work has mir@@ ac@@ ul@@ ously created a market for industry and has reduced the entire nation to un@@ imag@@ in@@ able levels of production .
those who attack the work forget these simple tru@@ ths , but history preser@@ ves them .
history is re@@ member@@ ing , and we should do so .
formal recognition of labour rights as human rights - and the extension of the protection of civil rights as a protection against discrimination in the creation of workers &apos; organisations - is long over@@ due .
ke@@ ith el@@ lis@@ on and john le@@ w@@ is re@@ new the ide@@ als that have made america big in the past and re@@ deemed the promise of democracy .
judge tempor@@ arily stops law that all abor@@ tion clin@@ ics in lou@@ i@@ si@@ ana are forced to close .
a us federal judge provi@@ sion@@ ally stopped the implementation of a law in lou@@ i@@ si@@ ana on sunday , which lawyers say would probably lead to the closure of all five abor@@ tion clin@@ ics in the state .
this measure , which was supported by bo@@ b@@ by j@@ in@@ dal , govern@@ or of lou@@ i@@ si@@ ana , in june , and was adopted on 1 september , would be welcomed by doctors who have had abor@@ tions .
the judge ’ s decision , however , means that doctors will continue to be able to carry out legal abor@@ tions for the time being , while they are applying for such a right .
&quot; the pla@@ in@@ ti@@ ffs can continue to work in compliance with the law while they strive to obtain these rights , &quot; wrote federal judge john de@@ gra@@ vel@@ les in his judgment .
a hearing will be held for the judge within a month to ensure that the law is subject to a more permanent decision .
ad@@ voca@@ tes of abor@@ tion welcomed the decision to take the latest in a series of jud@@ gments against similar measures and said that doctors would gain more time to prepare hospital in@@ junction rights .
&quot; today &apos;s decision means that women in lou@@ i@@ si@@ ana are es@@ cap@@ ing a dis@@ gr@@ ac@@ eful law that wants to depri@@ ve them of their health and their rights , &quot; said n@@ ancy nor@@ th@@ up , president and chairman of the centre for reproduction five .
it was not immediately clear whether the judgment would also apply to doctors from the two clin@@ ics who are the subject of the compla@@ int and who are also entitled to take the case .
lou@@ i@@ si@@ ana is one of 11 states that have en@@ acted similar laws , with courts recently taking such measures in al@@ ab@@ ama and missi@@ ssi@@ pp@@ i as un@@ constitutional .
key legal offices in tex@@ as , which represent most of the clin@@ ics remaining in the state , were closed by a federal judge on friday .
the american college of science ( c@@ du ) is a member of the international institute for the study of ad@@ ol@@ esc@@ ence and of the american college of o@@ stre@@ tr@@ ici@@ ans and gy@@ nec@@ o@@ logi@@ sts .
oppon@@ ents of abor@@ tion argue that the measures are designed to protect women &apos;s health , although some also have the effect of closing clin@@ ics .
only a doctor who has had abor@@ tion in lou@@ i@@ si@@ ana has patient in@@ sign@@ ia rights , has shared the centre for re@@ productive rights .
if all other doctors in the state are forced to stop carrying out abor@@ tions , this doctor would be unable to carry out the operation for fear of his safety , the group said .
in her arguments against the judgment , representatives of the state lou@@ i@@ si@@ ana said that they did not want doctors to be pun@@ ished for carrying out abor@@ tions , while their applications for patient ad@@ missions were still pending .
dela@@ yed diagno@@ sis and lack of access to the best treatment leads to higher death rates due to o@@ vari@@ an cancer in rural areas .
angel@@ ina jo@@ lie and her brother james have a video tribute for her mother .
for women in the rural areas of australia , there is a higher risk of dying of eg@@ g cancer than for women in cities .
researchers analy@@ zed the medical data of more than 1@@ 100 austr@@ ali@@ ans , who were diagno@@ sed with o@@ vari@@ an cancer in 2005 , and found that only 25 % were diagno@@ sed five years after diagno@@ sis .
the research leader sus@@ an j@@ ord@@ an of q@@ im@@ r ber@@ g@@ ho@@ fer medical research institute said that for those who live in rural and remote regions of the state , the mort@@ ality rate risk during the study was 20 % higher .
small study : new drugs could cause l@@ ung and eg@@ g cancer , but they could also be reduced .
researchers studied the medical care of women over seven years .
dr. j@@ ord@@ an said that a woman &apos;s age in diagno@@ sis , the type of o@@ vari@@ an cancer , existing pre@@ dis@@ orders and the social and economic status also affect the chan@@ ces of survival .
for older women and those whose cancer is already continuing to develop at diagno@@ stic times , the survival rate was the lowest .
for those who live in rural and remote regions of the state , the mort@@ ality risk during the study was 20 % higher than for those in urban areas .
although the study did not investigate why women living outside the city are more likely to suffer from o@@ vari@@ an cancer , dr. jor@@ dan susp@@ ects a be@@ lated diagno@@ sis and lack of access to the best treatments .
&quot; this disease is best treated by on@@ co@@ log@@ ist gy@@ nec@@ ology , and these are usually found in larger cities , &quot; she said .
despite the improvement of tele@@ medical services to counter di@@ stances , it proposed as a possible re@@ me@@ dy to increase the service of doctors flo@@ wn in order to provide specialists with the opportunity to dis@@ ti@@ ll@@ ate women more closely to their place of residence .
dr. j@@ ord@@ an said that the study , regardless of geographical status , has a poor long-term survival rate for women in o@@ vari@@ an cancer , and under@@ lined the need for better treatment and preventive strategies .
the strategy proposed by rio t@@ into ride to con@@ qu@@ er cancer is now being published in the medical journal of australia .
in march 2013 el@@ ish@@ a ne@@ a@@ ve , a young mother of 33 years , learned from the gold coast that she had an aggres@@ sive form of eg@@ g cancer .
garden centers regret falling household ownership numbers and the lack of land ownership .
the decline , together with a further decre@@ ase in the number of house@@ holders under 35 , could lead to garden centers losing tens of thousands of p@@ ounds a year if today ’ s young consumers , according to a study by h@@ ta , reported in the financial times .
the report says that ten@@ ants pay an average of 55 % of the amount , that people with homes spend for their garden .
the rise in people living in highly ur@@ ban@@ ised areas without gardens is the popular procedure , the pre@@ cur@@ sor to park for as@@ ph@@ al@@ ted animals and the dec@@ lining garden size are other factors that thre@@ aten the industry .
in the greater london area , where the proportion of home@@ owners has ris@@ en from 61 to 43 % over a period of six years , the lowest expenditure on gar@@ d@@ ening products per household is reported .
the h@@ ta and the royal hor@@ tic@@ ul@@ tural society point out that housing is necessary for rent or small gardens , not that people do not want to move plants .
gu@@ y bar@@ ter , chief garden advis@@ er for the r@@ hin@@ e-@@ based group said : &quot; contain@@ er gar@@ den@@ ers are very popular among ten@@ ants , for example , because they can take their plants with them when moving . &quot;
the h@@ ta report identified the period between 1997 and 2005 as the &quot; golden age &quot; of the garden retail trade due to rising household ownership and economic prosperity from the late 1980 ’ s to the mid-@@ 1990 ’ s .
he predic@@ ted a better performance of the market this year because of the better weather after un@@ friendly weather conditions in march and april last year .
the political and economic reforms that the opposition politici@@ an im@@ ran kh@@ an and the spiritual ta@@ h@@ ir@@ u@@ l q@@ ad@@ ri have led in pakistan are continuing .
in the capital , islam@@ ab@@ ad , around 1000 demonstr@@ ators have over@@ thro@@ wn the state television station p@@ tv .
information minister per@@ va@@ i@@ z r@@ as@@ hi@@ d said that soldiers had once again taken the prote@@ sters out of p@@ tv buildings .
the station set up its operation for about 40 minutes , but is now sending it back .
at the same time , around 3@@ 000 demonstr@@ ators tried to reach the residence of prime minister na@@ wa@@ z shar@@ if .
about one kil@@ ome@@ ter away , they provided with st@@ alls and stones equipped col@@ li@@ sions with security forces .

the demonstr@@ ators called for shar@@ if ’ s re@@ sign@@ ation , but he re@@ jects it .
the country ’ s army is , in the meantime , ur@@ ging a political solution to the conflict , &apos; waste no time and apply force &apos; .
after a meeting in the headquarters on sunday evening , the military said : &quot; the army remains committed to ful@@ filling its role of ensuring state security &quot; .

turkey is appoin@@ ting us diplom@@ at for es@@ pi@@ on@@ age reports .
the turkish foreign ministry has awarded the world ’ s lon@@ ge@@ st-@@ serving us diplom@@ at a report on american and british es@@ pi@@ on@@ age in turkey .
vice-president b@@ ü@@ l@@ ent said that the secretary of state of the us emb@@ ass@@ y and turkish officials had discussed the report on monday .
the german magazine der spi@@ e@@ gel and the online magazine the inter@@ cep@@ t reported that the results of the research carried out by the former us analy@@ st of the national security agency , ed@@ ward snow , show that turkey is a major area of activity for the uk .
according to turkish news agencies , the turkish president , rec@@ ep ta@@ y@@ y@@ ip er@@ do@@ gan , played the importance of the report down and said that all the major countries are playing each other out .
an earlier report that was also the most important intelligence service in germany , an@@ kar@@ a , caused much an@@ no@@ y@@ ance by the turkish government .

we expect to see significant fail@@ ures .
regional priorities are not there .
the main thr@@ ust of the warning strike is freight traffic .
deutsche bahn in n@@ r@@ w announced that it would do everything to minim@@ ize the impact .
the g@@ d@@ l did not say where it wanted to strike , however , so it is difficult to predic@@ t the consequences in concrete terms .
mag@@ alu@@ f police chief accused of corruption
the prosecu@@ tors sent a letter to the office of the public prosecu@@ tor of mall@@ orca on friday to prove the black@@ mail of the town of cal@@ vi@@ à &apos;s police and officials .
cal@@ vi@@ à &apos;s chief police officer on the island of mall@@ orca was sent@@ enced to death for corruption charges by business@@ men and bar@@ ke@@ ep@@ ers in the not@@ ori@@ ous b@@ ing@@ e drinking hot@@ spot mag@@ alu@@ f .
the prime commissioner , jo@@ s@@ é ant@@ oni@@ o na@@ var@@ ro , was arrested by several business@@ men from pun@@ ta b@@ all@@ ena , the street where most bars and night clubs are located in mag@@ alu@@ f .
according to the online newspaper mall@@ orca di@@ ario , the prosecu@@ tors put a case for corruption charges in the public prosecu@@ tor &apos;s office on friday , and there was evidence of black@@ mail by police and city officials from cal@@ vi@@ à .
two other local police were arrested by the spanish civil guard in connection with the corru@@ pt demonstra@@ tions of the spanish government and are being arrested together with na@@ var@@ ro by a judge .
the spanish national daily newspaper ab@@ c reported that the an@@ gr@@ y night@@ club owners said that they were not able to support the authorities &apos; cr@@ ony@@ ism .
&quot; it &apos;s no longer about making money , it &apos;s about survival , &quot; one of the business@@ men said to the court .
let our live@@ li@@ hood be taken out of the game .
we have nothing to lose .
mag@@ alu@@ f made a huge effort this summer due to a vir@@ al you@@ tube video , in which an 18@@ -@@ year-@@ old british tourist was shown , who was interested in 24 men during a sho@@ ot fel@@ la@@ ti@@ o .
since then , the island authorities have tried to control the illegal behaviour of alcoho@@ lic holi@@ day@@ makers in mag@@ alu@@ f by reducing the number of participants in the not@@ ori@@ ous alcohol drinks .
the play@@ house club , where the fel@@ la@@ ti@@ o incident took place , was closed for a year , while play@@ house and the pu@@ b were closed .
mag@@ alu@@ f , a tourist resort that is popular with young british holi@@ day@@ makers , is also known for a number of accidents involving alcohol , including the trend towards the &quot; bal@@ con@@ ing &quot; , which is affecting people from all over the world .
the first day of spring with we@@ t and stor@@ my weather conditions affects flights from ade@@ la@@ ide airport .
the spring has a winter surprise in southern australia , with intense and intense sho@@ wers and strong win@@ ds , which make flights from ade@@ la@@ ide airport from a dis@@ advant@@ aged position .
in the evening , there were another 5@@ mm rain on the city , after 6.@@ 6@@ mm , which was already pre@@ cip@@ it@@ ated on sunday night .
the final ra@@ inf@@ all was the result of a series of short , stor@@ my sho@@ wers , including a casting that began just before 8 p.m. and was suitable for almost 4@@ mm pre@@ cip@@ itation in about 10 minutes .
after the winter last week for an early do@@ se of spring , the temperature fell to around 20 ° c on monday .
the bad weather probably caused the late lan@@ ding of a flight of vir@@ gin airlines from mel@@ bour@@ ne to ade@@ la@@ ide .
the plane would have lan@@ ded shortly after 7.@@ 30 p.m. , but it was hit by a wh@@ i@@ ff - a su@@ dden change in wind speed or direction over a short distance - and had to take off .
at that time , wind@@ stor@@ ms reached about 50 km / h on the ground at the airport ade@@ la@@ ide .
the flight data showed that the aircraft was also flying for a second lan@@ ding flight and that it was finally re@@ deplo@@ yed at around 8.@@ 40 p.m.
the delay in the flight resulted in delays to some other flights , including an em@@ i@@ rates flight from du@@ ba@@ i and a qu@@ ant@@ as flight from sy@@ d@@ ney .
for ade@@ la@@ ide , a maximum temperature of 16 ° c is predic@@ ted on tuesday , with possible sho@@ wers .
mat@@ thi@@ es says : it is high time to connect to the internet .
given the technical adv@@ ances that our co@@ sin@@ ess has brought to our home in high-@@ tech swit@@ ch@@ gear , we are now in a state of comfort .
while i write this here , my ga@@ ze at the spir@@ al cable that connec@@ ts the list@@ en@@ er to the phone , and i think : bo@@ ah , how re@@ tr@@ o is that ?
but there is one consideration : if the cable were not there , all the list@@ en@@ ers would be in the house in a very short time , and that would be significantly more re@@ tr@@ o .
in any case , the e@@ kel@@ tr@@ onic ( ec@@ lec@@ tic ) system is in place .
no , ty@@ po@@ s : electronic ) sector the rule that the world &apos;s nov@@ el@@ ty today is the electric sc@@ ra@@ p of tomorrow , bought - ob@@ sole@@ te .
and if you want to watch a tv in the living room , for example , you just say that you reject television in principle .
why are these considerations ?
because the pressure from the i@@ fa on the radio tower this week again showed us our absolute in@@ competence in electronics issues .
the lay@@ man , who used to be a washing machine and cd player blind , does not even understand the purpose of the equipment that was designed with in@@ comprehen@@ sible v@@ ague expert talk in front of him : &quot; connected .
yes , is it still possible ?
what should we talk about with people who seem to be volun@@ tar@@ ily spre@@ ading such quar@@ k ?
in fact , for some 20 years now , the main issue has been that we should be very happy to network our house .
in order to be able to re@@ order the yo@@ gh@@ ur@@ t itself , so that the fire alarm tells us during your holiday in the mal@@ di@@ ves that it is burning in the working room .
and would it not be wonderful if we could have the air conditioning from the office on our early arrival ... ?
yes , however , this requires air conditioning .
but a dream will certainly come true soon : we raise our watch for arm@@ bands , say you &quot; suc@@ k ! &quot; - and at home the vacu@@ um r@@ ack is running out .
wrong .
everything is all about nothing less than a revolution : &quot; the borders between white and brown goods are bl@@ ur@@ red , &quot; a fire of industry experts , you can see the washing machine with a head@@ phones .
we also know from daily practice that when a new and modern device is really needed , the battery is guaranteed to be empty .
another reason is that the spir@@ al cable on the phone also features the next radio exhibitions .
israeli children are returning to their schools after the war in gaza and are now returning to their schools .
thousands of israeli children from the areas near the gaza strip returned to israel on monday , and they were given the summer in air protection rooms .
the school started off with the ro@@ cket ho@@ les municip@@ alities in southern israel .
in the southern city of ash@@ do@@ d , the staff of the &quot; pas@@ ho@@ sh &quot; kin@@ der@@ gar@@ ten , which was hit by a ro@@ cket , had sh@@ at@@ tered sh@@ ards from the walls and sh@@ ale before the pu@@ pil@@ s arrived .

many children from our area urgently need a return to a rout@@ ine .
her 1@@ 1-@@ year-@@ old daughter sh@@ ani b@@ art said that it felt &quot; a bit fun@@ ny &quot; , suddenly again in the school .
&quot; these were difficult times , and we did not leave the house at all , &quot; she said .
president re@@ u@@ ven ri@@ v@@ lin visited ki@@ b@@ but@@ z near the gaza border to offer his support .
until a ce@@ as@@ e@@ fire inter@@ rup@@ ted last week ’ s war , thousands of border communities like sa@@ ad remained in their homes or left their homes to live in sa@@ fer areas further away from gaza and to join the ra@@ ft .
many inhabitants of na@@ h@@ al o@@ z , a municip@@ ality near the gaza border , where a 4-@@ year-@@ old boy was killed by a palestinian mur@@ de@@ rer g@@ ren@@ ade , are still hesit@@ ating about to return .
the ministry of education announced that a do@@ zen or so families have not yet returned .
their children were tempor@@ arily hou@@ sed in other schools .
prime minister ben@@ jam@@ in net@@ any@@ ah@@ u attended a school in s@@ der@@ ot , a border town with gaza that was se@@ ve@@ rely affected by the palestinian attack .
he called on the children to learn a lot and said &apos; we will ensure that their knowledge is acquired and offer you security &apos; .
israel and hamas agreed last tuesday on an open-@@ ended ce@@ as@@ e@@ fire .
the ce@@ as@@ e@@ fire brought an immediate end to the fighting , but important problems remain un@@ resolved , as hamas ’ s call for the isra@@ eli@@ -@@ egyp@@ tian bloc@@ k@@ ade of gaza and the re@@ opening of the air and sea ports .
israel is calling for hamas to be dis@@ armed and for the cor@@ p@@ ses to be handed over to two israeli soldiers killed in the fighting .
a new round of indirect talks is expected to begin in egypt this month .
in the war , more than 2,@@ 100 palestinians were killed , three-@@ quarters of them civili@@ ans , and at least 4@@ 94 children were killed , according to estimates by the palestinians and the un .
israel den@@ ies this data and estimates that at least half of the deaths are fighting for the peace process , but it did not provide any concrete evidence .
on the israeli side , 66 soldiers and six civili@@ ans , including a th@@ ai work@@ er , were killed .
hamas and other gaza figh@@ ters fi@@ red 4@@ ,@@ 5@@ 91 ro@@ c@@ kets and mur@@ de@@ rers during the batt@@ les on israeli cities , which were mostly in the south of the country .
meanwhile , the israeli military has carried out more than 5@@ ,000 air and other attacks .
the israeli attacks damaged or destroyed thousands of gaza houses and some 25@@ 0,000 people susp@@ ected of being in more than 100 un schools .
while tens of thousands of people continue to live in the shel@@ ters and continue the fighting , the education authorities postpon@@ ed last week the start of the school year .
&quot; i hope the school is soon open again so we can continue to learn as the children in the world and the jewish children , &quot; said mo@@ ham@@ ma@@ d am@@ ara , a 13@@ -@@ year-@@ old boy who is currently in a school in gam@@ ma .

berlin - according to c@@ du bun@@ des@@ vi@@ ze thomas stro@@ b@@ l , the ongoing prohibi@@ tion proceedings against the n@@ p@@ d should be brought to an end before the federal constitutional court .
&quot; the n@@ p@@ d is doing worse than last time , &quot; said stro@@ b@@ l , who also runs c@@ du head of state in bad@@ en-@@ w@@ ür@@ t@@ tem@@ berg , the &quot; le@@ ip@@ zi@@ ger vol@@ k@@ s@@ ze@@ it@@ ung &quot; .
this is a welcome development in the right direction and a development that i would rather see as the result of the n@@ p@@ d being politically opposed and not taken to the constitutional court .
the n@@ p@@ d was very close to the fifth percentage h@@ ür@@ de in sunday &apos;s vote .
a first attempt to ban the extreme right party failed in 2003 because the constitutional protection was also in force in the n@@ p@@ d tip of inform@@ ers .

har@@ burg : t@@ ents for new refugees
refugees are now being placed in new countries &apos; square in t@@ ents .
the central initial reception for refugees in har@@ burg bur@@ sts from all se@@ ams .
now the interior authority has three red cross t@@ ents next to it .
the district politicians were informed just before - they are not very enthusi@@ astic .
&quot; these back@@ up actions continue to fuel public reservations and give the district politicians no opportunity to participate construc@@ tively in the human@@ e housing of refugees .
your party demands that the district administration of har@@ burg currently has un@@ used houses for accommodation .
96 refugees can be accommo@@ dated in the three t@@ ents .
the reasons for over@@ filling in the initial recording are the on@@ set of aid see@@ kers - and the fact that the authorities have not given enough places in follow-up facilities .
many refugees therefore remain longer than the regular three months .
house prices have increased the most severe winter rise in seven years , shows a widely observed index .
the r@@ p data co@@ re@@ logic he@@ don@@ ic home value index for home in the austr@@ ali@@ an capital increased by 1.@@ 1 percent in august , according to r@@ p data from monday .
this increase is the total increase in june , july and august , 4.@@ 2 % , the largest increase in the winter months since 2007 .
the annual price increase was 10.@@ 9 percent , more than twice the current increase in the 12 months to august 2013 , but the increases in the market were not even above the country .
the research manager of r@@ p data , ti@@ m law@@ less , announced that sy@@ d@@ ney and mel@@ bour@@ ne had a two-@@ ti@@ er market .
r@@ p data figures show that house prices in sy@@ d@@ ney were down by 16@@ .@@ 1 % last year , in mel@@ bour@@ ne , by 1@@ 1.@@ 7 % .
the following markets are ade@@ la@@ ide , br@@ is@@ ban@@ e and dar@@ win , where prices are average by 5 and 6 percent .
at the other end of the scale is can@@ ber@@ ra , which is hard hit by cuts in government spending , and where prices have fallen by only 1.@@ 4 % over the year .
mr law@@ less also said that spring is now beginning to be a rise in the number of products for sale .
&quot; if you want to keep the constantly high rate of au@@ ction prices , a generally fast sales rate and the constantly low interest rates , you can find it probably that the sel@@ f@@ house prices in the next three months will continue to rise .
in an opinion to the new press , he contradic@@ ts statements by the managing director pe@@ er med@@ au and ass@@ esses him , &quot; like a fel@@ d@@ her@@ r &quot; to position him .
the style of the university is not this , it is stated in the communication .
the med@@ au family was already or@@ ally informed about the request of the university in mid-@@ june .
the statement that the plans were only known in july is definitely wrong , &quot; says p@@ ö@@ tz@@ l .
at the same time , he points out that the plans are not &apos; pre@@ determined &apos; or even decisions &apos; , but it is &apos; preferences &apos; .
the development of narrow roads , which is necessary for access , up to the castle , is also less dramatic than that fe@@ ared by the med@@ as .
the hotel was not , and still is , about a nine metr@@ e wide road .
as things stand , it is 5.@@ 50 metres wide , a metr@@ e wider than before , &quot; explains p@@ ö@@ tz@@ l .
the argument of the me@@ d@@ ah operators that their free and school parking areas will then be used only by students of the university in future , p@@ ö@@ tz@@ l does not want to apply .
it is not possible to park because , as in other public parking spaces , this can now be solved intellig@@ ently .
remember the residents who live near the city
the mountain ran@@ ges of the children ’ s camp , which are located on the site and on the front door of which the access to the parking dec@@ k is to be maintained , are said to be &quot; not affected &quot; by the president of the university .
instead , he points out that &apos; this is not just about the cr@@ è@@ che , but also about the residents who live near the mouth of the fried@@ rich@@ -@@ stre@@ ib@@ -@@ stra@@ ß@@ e and the 800 students of the neighbouring real@@ sch@@ u@@ le .
so it is about much more than the special interests of mess@@ rs med@@ au , &quot; says p@@ ö@@ tz@@ l .
whether the criticism of the child care advisory council , the development of the road would be one of the &quot; few natural spots of co@@ burg &quot; lost would be justified , &quot; the reader can be able to decide for himself &quot; .
in early october , p@@ ö@@ tz@@ l , together with the state building office b@@ am@@ berg , will publish the city counc@@ ils on the structural development of the university until 2020 &quot; and in this context address the importance of the new development &quot; .
pe@@ er med@@ au had visited the parents of the cr@@ è@@ che last week about the plans of the university .
the new parking dec@@ k is not to be access@@ ed via the camp@@ us and the fried@@ rich@@ -@@ stre@@ ib@@ -@@ stra@@ ß@@ e as before , but via the me@@ d@@ ach mountain .
this would have to be a two-@@ lan@@ e road of about one kil@@ ome@@ tre length .
according to the med@@ as estimates , the traffic in the park of ho@@ hen@@ f@@ els castle would increase ten@@ fold .
there are about 2000 vehicles a day .
the city has not yet wanted to comment on the project .
gl@@ and@@ or@@ f is a national hand@@ ball team that re@@ signs from the hand@@ ball team .
hol@@ ger gl@@ and@@ or@@ f will no longer play for the dh@@ b team .
the 3@@ 1-@@ year-@@ old from the bun@@ des@@ lig@@ ist s@@ g fl@@ ens@@ bur@@ g-@@ han@@ de@@ wit@@ t caused a major health problem in this decision .
i did not like the decision easily , it was mat@@ ured for several months .
it is time for me to respond to the signals of my body and to pursue my career in the national team , &quot; said the world champi@@ on of 2007 at his fac@@ e@@ book page .
it therefore has a record of 16@@ 7 country games and 5@@ 76 goals for germany in international reti@@ rement .
because the thro@@ wing giant back@@ room player for the champi@@ ons league winner from fl@@ ens@@ burg still some years on to@@ re@@ hun@@ t .
with the ic@@ el@@ and@@ er , who will be taking his cad@@ re for the country mat@@ ches against switzerland on tuesday , gl@@ and@@ or@@ f conducted a &quot; long and good con@@ vers@@ ation .
his ideas and approaches have inspired me as much as they have been my long-@@ time fellow players and my success@@ ors .
but for my club i want to be available healthy in the years to come , for this is the need for longer periods of reg@@ ener@@ ation that do not allow the current double load .
the lef@@ t-@@ wing leader had , in 2012 , even lost his career after a he@@ el inf@@ ection .
because of ach@@ ill@@ es@@ h@@ än@@ ger problems he had been cont@@ acted by team doctors of the german hand@@ b@@ all@@ bun@@ des ( dh@@ b ) with a cor@@ tis@@ one injec@@ tion which later caused a strong infl@@ am@@ mation .
an emergency operation and two further interven@@ tions followed .
then gl@@ and@@ or@@ f had a compla@@ int against the team doctor , the dispute ended with a settlement .
twelve years of professional and ele@@ ven years of national team career are not passed by any body without tr@@ ace .
i have some health care facilities that i can no longer ignore .
after the three inf@@ ec@@ tion-@@ related foot@@ -@@ sur@@ gery that took place in 2012 , i have been able to keep my blood pressure under control .
this includes a number of other complaints that are caused by wear and te@@ ar .
i started the year by saying that i had to ste@@ er my head but i didn &apos;t get my body wrong , &quot; gl@@ and@@ or@@ f explained in the interview to the magazine &quot; hand@@ ball time &quot; .
for a com@@ e@@ back , it would only be available in an emergency .
&quot; when all the k@@ nit@@ ting te@@ ars break , i am always ready to talk , &quot; said the family &apos;s tw@@ o@@ fold father to the magazine .
however , i can not count the years in which i can play hand@@ ball at one hand .
i must also say that , after my long stay in hospital in 2012 , i also became quite hum@@ ili@@ ating in terms of my health .
after my career , i would like to be able to go straight at least to some extent .
in addition to the 2007 world cup title and the 20@@ 14 champi@@ ons league win , he won the 2008 h@@ s@@ g n@@ ord@@ hor@@ n and 2010 ( t@@ b@@ v le@@ m@@ go ) e@@ h@@ f cup .
in 2012 , he also secured the european cup of the po@@ dium winner with fl@@ ens@@ burg .
german economy dro@@ pped by 0.@@ 2 % in the spring by 0.@@ 2 %
the crises around the world have hit the german economy in the second quarter .
gdp fell from april to the end of june 20@@ 14 compared to the prior quarter by 0.@@ 2 % .
this was shared by the federal statistical office and confirmed provi@@ sional calcu@@ lations .
consumption alone revi@@ ved the economy in the spring , while investment dec@@ lined .
foreign trade , too , has slow@@ ed the economy .
thanks to the strong annual start , the total for the first half of the year is 0.@@ 8 percent higher than the second half of 2013 .
hor@@ st@@ mar was the starting point and the goal of the &quot; m@@ ün@@ ster@@ land@@ -@@ mo@@ o@@ i@@ ste &quot; , which was first introduced to the bur@@ g@@ man@@ n@@ s@@ stadt on sunday .
the bur@@ g@@ man@@ n@@ stadt hor@@ st@@ mar experienced an inv@@ asion of dutch &quot; fi@@ est@@ as &quot; on sunday .
the largest cycling association in the netherlands , n@@ t@@ f@@ u , organised the so-called &quot; m@@ ün@@ ster@@ lan@@ de mo@@ o@@ i@@ ste &quot; .
it is the biggest bicycle tour across the m@@ ün@@ ster@@ land , the bike paradise , close to the netherlands .
over 1000 participants than@@ ked jo@@ s ter hu@@ er@@ ne for organiz@@ ing this tour through the munich cathedral .
the competition was held in various trade magaz@@ ines .
we are from the her@@ oes and we went over@@ night to take part in this tour .
we would like to take this opportunity to get to know the m@@ ün@@ ster@@ land in a closer way , &quot; said the cy@@ cli@@ sts on the route through the cir@@ cles ste@@ in@@ furt , bor@@ ken and co@@ es@@ fel@@ d .
after regi@@ stering at the association sh@@ ei@@ m of the sta sch@@ ü@@ tz@@ en@@ bru@@ der@@ schaft .
k@@ ath@@ ar@@ ina was on a small &quot; peace trip &quot; across the city across the wall , where the start was also made .
the route , which is adver@@ ti@@ sed for three different categories , went towards man@@ or wood over the sch@@ ö@@ pp@@ inger mountain towards co@@ es@@ fel@@ d and about ha@@ vi@@ x@@ bec@@ k and b@@ ill@@ er@@ bec@@ k back to hor@@ st@@ mar .
on 95 kilometers of 1@@ 17@@ 5 meters of al@@ titude , 120 kilometers of 14@@ 75 meters of al@@ titude and 14@@ 5 kilometers of 17@@ 75 meters of al@@ titude , the cy@@ cli@@ sts proved their good condition .
they were taken care of on the way in ha@@ vi@@ x@@ bec@@ k and b@@ ill@@ er@@ bec@@ k .
main organiz@@ er jo@@ s ter hu@@ er@@ ne and may@@ or depu@@ ty he@@ in@@ z l@@ ö@@ l@@ fing showed that this cycling event was a success .
we are satisfied and it was a great experience for all concerned .
the organisation went without problems and there were no negative inci@@ dents , &quot; he@@ in@@ z l@@ ö@@ l@@ fing dra@@ ws a positive conclusion of this event .
unfortunately , not as many participants as the organiz@@ er had hoped , which probably was due to the bad weather forec@@ asts and the morning forec@@ ast .
&quot; we are back in 20@@ 15 , hopefully in good weather on august 30 or during another weekend , &quot; the cy@@ cli@@ sts promised to go back to m@@ ün@@ ster@@ land and the organiz@@ ers are planning a new edition .
kon@@ stan@@ tin w@@ ec@@ ker &apos;s honest mem@@ o@@ irs are a great mem@@ o@@ ir .
it is actually more philosoph@@ ical testi@@ mony than bio@@ graphy , which kon@@ stan@@ tin w@@ ec@@ ker , li@@ e@@ der@@ mach@@ er , paci@@ f@@ ist , polit@@ -@@ safe acti@@ vis@@ t , ex@@ -@@ prisoners , in &quot; mon@@ k and k@@ ri@@ e@@ x .
not chron@@ o@@ log@@ ically , but more thought s@@ ca@@ ff@@ ol@@ ding has been the main theme of the new co@@ smo@@ politan era born on june 1 , 194@@ 7 , each chapter initiated by a suitable song title .
and he is being brut@@ ally honest : from on@@ ani@@ e as a gy@@ m@@ na@@ si@@ ast to shop the@@ ft and drug use , he does not leave human weak@@ ness .
also to show how he himself is tolerance in dealing with his fellow human beings .
broad space also takes ab@@ str@@ act , but even more important terms : love , soul , e@@ go , which is in the now , spirit@@ u@@ ality - all this he tries to get to the bottom , on very philosoph@@ ical but also very personal .
and he also explains his paci@@ f@@ ism , his social critique , his political commitment - and also how he is not only characterised by music ( the opera lo@@ ver was elected soul and rock musici@@ an ) , but also his political commitment .
the latter has given the le@@ be@@ mann kon@@ stan@@ tin w@@ ack@@ er a closer look at the as@@ ce@@ tic mon@@ k , who is &quot; created by sub@@ tr@@ action &quot; , as he says , &quot; leaving everything unnecessary &quot; .
there is , however , a short an@@ ec@@ do@@ tes between all the high-@@ min@@ ded views : about be@@ at@@ ings in a g@@ is frequ@@ ented local or a ma@@ d wit@@ ty auto@@ journey , where the person is fron@@ t@@ line .
he is also being brut@@ ally honest about this .
len@@ ny hen@@ ry : my father never took me to the arm .
never said &quot; i love you &quot;
hen@@ ry was one of seven children of a family of jam@@ a@@ ic@@ an immigrants in du@@ d@@ ley in the mid@@ lands in 195@@ 8 .
his father , who died when hen@@ ry was 19 , worked in a factory and her relationship was limited .
hen@@ ry is trying for a com@@ edy , ru@@ dy &apos;s rare records , which is partly based on an imag@@ inary con@@ vers@@ ation with his father and which is out of the series on radio 4 .
the sound@@ track is a mix@@ ture of reg@@ ga@@ e and ra@@ p , with lively me@@ lo@@ dies .
but hen@@ ry had to be able to work through some difficult child@@ hood moments .
he attended &quot; many &quot; therap@@ ies after the death of his mother , and hen@@ ry is refl@@ ec@@ tive of his relationship with his father .
it was difficult to know him .
you never saw his face , just heard his voice : &quot; listen to the cr@@ ash .
let your si@@ ster do it in peace .
get on with it !
i will look cr@@ ick@@ et .
my older bro@@ thers se@@ y@@ m@@ our and hil@@ ton - who were already grown up when i was a child - went to the pu@@ b with him and talked about things like the shape of beer glass or the beauty of a be@@ er-@@ cr@@ ack .
i never had such a con@@ vers@@ ation with him .
for much of my life he was this serious gu@@ y in the corner who read the newspaper .
recently , hen@@ ry opened a foun@@ dry in du@@ d@@ ley , and although the conditions are better than at the time of his father , he gained a gli@@ mp@@ se of how life had been for him .
it is now a little ligh@@ ter , but they are dark , smo@@ ked , deep stylish lab@@ y@@ r@@ in@@ the with fl@@ ame sho@@ ts and smo@@ ke and much so@@ ot .
my father was simply sitting down in the bath and then i could hear him slowly as he began to sing because he had not been able to d@@ ress the foun@@ dry .
when i was there , i realized that he had been doing that for years to make food on the table .
however , hen@@ ry grew up as a child without love testi@@ mony of his parents .
my father never hu@@ gged me , he never said &quot; i love you &quot; .
only when my mother went badly towards the end of her life did we begin to &quot; i love you , i love you , i love you &quot; to say .
through its own subsidiary bil@@ li@@ g , with da@@ wn french , he could share the love he had missed as a child .
could you ever do with the &quot; i love you &quot; ?
stop hu@@ gging me !
pap@@ a , i am 22 !
with da@@ wn french .
why should we not be friends ?
she is a great mother .
it is still with french friends , with whom he spent 25 years married .
da@@ wn is a good man .
why should we not be friends ?
she is a great mother .
hen@@ ry ’ s mother was a di@@ abe@@ tic .
this contributed to their death .
so when i was very , very over@@ weight and symp@@ t@@ oms of di@@ abe@@ tes , my doctor said , &quot; you must be radical .
so i pul@@ led this fit@@ n@@ ess@@ -@@ out and also had to make a dr@@ astic di@@ et to reverse the symp@@ t@@ oms .
it is very difficult .
and it is ex@@ hau@@ sting .
no one li@@ kes eating car@@ ro@@ ts .
hen@@ ry ’ s career shift may be reflected in his elegant , short cut b@@ art .
since he was nom@@ inated by cri@@ tics for his o@@ th@@ ell@@ o , he has been cap@@ tured by the theatre .
the com@@ edy of the errors followed , and then f@@ ences of august wil@@ son .
this is a different experience from the sit@@ com@@ s and com@@ e@@ dies that have driven his busy working life .
he began with only 16 years when he worked in a factory .
a d@@ j discovered him on stage when he im@@ it@@ ated people and wrote to new faces about him .
his television career began in the mid-@@ 197@@ 0s . &quot; i was a very long time the only black im@@ it@@ ator / com@@ edi@@ an on television . &quot;
he learned in his profes@@ sion .
i had to get big not only in front of the public , but also learn from 197@@ 5 to 198@@ 5 how to create an efficient jo@@ ke nar@@ ra@@ tive machine while watching a star through television , and that was really difficult .
len@@ ny 197@@ 5 at new faces
since his manager was playing the stage right at the black and white min@@ stre@@ l show , a light entertainment programme , in which he was able to &quot; black &quot; his paintings .
i was very un@@ comfortable with my family .
i would like to see it never happen , but i do not regret that i did .
it was a strange , un@@ pleasant position for me , but i was working on giant projects and learned how to deal with a large audience .
but this &quot; long-@@ time awar@@ d-@@ winning , light pillar of british television &quot; was also a &quot; gro@@ te@@ s@@ que par@@ o@@ dy of black people . &quot;
by introducing figures that would make british black culture both mo@@ ck@@ ery and celebr@@ ation , hen@@ ry worked in the eigh@@ ties on an alternative com@@ edy circle .
the first series of the len@@ ny hen@@ ry show went on show in 198@@ 4 , and in the 199@@ 0s he was among others known as the ch@@ ef gare@@ th black@@ lock in the com@@ edy series ch@@ ef !
advertising , docum@@ entary films , tv series and film roll@@ s shaped his next decade , but after his bb@@ c series len@@ ny@@ hen@@ ry@@ .@@ tv 2008 he thought : &quot; what is doing you as next ?
after that , a series of docum@@ ent@@ aries for radio 4 , entitled what &apos;s so great about ... ?
the first episode was about sha@@ kes@@ pe@@ are .
i was really very aller@@ gic to sha@@ kes@@ pe@@ are .
i never really learned anything about him in school and thought that he was a domain of the middle class , white in str@@ um@@ p@@ f@@ ho@@ sen and a coal head in front of him .
so i was very afraid of it .
all of us who inter@@ viewed for the show , peter hall , tre@@ v@@ or n@@ un@@ n , adri@@ an les@@ ter , jud@@ i den@@ ch said &quot; you should try it .
do not be bad if you do not know what you are talking about .
add some words to your mouth , and then you will understand why we all have sha@@ kes@@ pe@@ are so dear .
hen@@ ry led 20 lines from o@@ th@@ el@@ los last speech for the docum@@ entary and he was enthusi@@ astic .
i felt i was able to do that .
it was almost as if someone had finally put my head on the right side .
&quot; that is what it is about , it is a serious matter , take them seriously , study your text , search a little .
the sam@@ ples were brut@@ al and i read this piece for months before we did it .
and it was a success .
they seemed to expect a car accident , and that was simply not the case .
and soon he appeared in the com@@ edy of the errors .
suddenly i was in the national theatre and i could not believe it .
there was a moment when i thought &quot; o@@ h , you changed you &quot; .
there was a technical error and hen@@ ry felt inst@@ inc@@ tive that he had to enter@@ tain the audience .
&quot; a little voice told me &quot; you must now bridge 10 minutes while you repair the computer . &quot;
instead , the stage manager announced that the idea would continue as soon as the problem was resolved .
i went from the stage and something in me said &quot; o@@ h , thank god &quot; .
i am not responsible for that .
i can leave that to someone else .
&quot; you play in a play , so stay in your role . &quot;
hen@@ ry in f@@ ences at the duc@@ h@@ ess theatre
the text for f@@ ences to learn was challenging .
pan@@ ic is very good , it strength@@ ens the tend@@ ons .
that was a good thing too , so it is like a big shi@@ eld of the go@@ ds who tell me &quot; this is your dest@@ iny &quot; .
he says this , of course , with a th@@ under@@ ing voice .
so i will stick to it .
i really love that .
i love to be in a sample room .
hen@@ ry still has the head of a com@@ edi@@ an - our con@@ vers@@ ation has been followed by hum@@ or@@ ous out@@ breaks while he im@@ it@@ ates people time and again .
i decided not to use a stand@@ -up com@@ edy because i think that this type of immediate satisfaction is essential from a room full of str@@ ang@@ ers .
if you search for this , you are facing a wall .
i sometimes play live at apo@@ llo when i feel like doing so , but overall i don &apos;t have as much as before .
i ask him if he ever wanted to create a stand@@ -up com@@ edy tour again .
the fun i had in a room with a director who helps to make a start , a middle section and the end of a journey - i do not think i can ever do it again .
is this his new inc@@ ar@@ nation ?
i think so .
i am a fan of this .
it is fun .
you always tell a story , and that is great .
i love stories .
people love stories .

&quot; this approach will make a significant contribution to ra@@ tion@@ alising public service by establishing the actual number of officials and also by increasing the sal@@ ary list on both levels of government - so the &quot; g@@ host &quot; eli@@ tes are elimin@@ ated .

he was in school for 44 years , 23 of them as a school leader .
from this time , man@@ f@@ red rich@@ ter knows many of the original pe@@ ter@@ sha@@ us@@ en and k@@ ol@@ l@@ b@@ ach@@ er from their time as pu@@ pil@@ s .
his methods were sometimes un@@ conventional , but always supported by his desire to see man in the student .

judge was born in tr@@ au@@ ten@@ au / north bo@@ hem@@ ia in 19@@ 30 , today tr@@ ut@@ no@@ v .
he was already interested in the new course of the year at the age of 14 .
one year later , the su@@ de@@ ten german@@ s were ex@@ propri@@ ated .
within half an hour the family had to leave their home .
after a few months in one camp , the road went to bav@@ aria in 194@@ 6 - in the freight wag@@ on .
it thus s@@ wal@@ low@@ ed jud@@ ges to the ob@@ er@@ fr@@ än@@ k@@ is@@ che s@@ end@@ dorf .
the teacher training took place in b@@ am@@ berg .
man@@ f@@ red had to judge ten kilometers a week to the next station , by train to b@@ am@@ berg , there three kilometres across the whole city to school , and then return to school in the evening .
after two months , man@@ f@@ red got jud@@ ges in a red cross home in b@@ am@@ berg a sle@@ eping opportunity : together with up to 15 students in a dor@@ mit@@ ory .
in 195@@ 1 he made the first and in 195@@ 4 , after three years of teaching candidate , he became the second state ex@@ am .
since he does not have a free teacher , he applied for a position in ob@@ er@@ bay@@ er@@ n and came to the school in k@@ ol@@ l@@ bach on november 1 , 195@@ 4 .
the &quot; fr@@ ä@@ u@@ le@@ in-@@ zim@@ mer &quot; was his first &quot; servic@@ e-@@ apartment &quot; in the school building .
in 195@@ 8 he received a degree in the new building of the teachers &apos; house next to the school .
this house bought man@@ f@@ red rich@@ ter in 1980 , after the school in k@@ ol@@ l@@ bach was dis@@ solved in 196@@ 8 .
until then , k@@ ol@@ l@@ bach had a school group in pe@@ ter@@ sha@@ us@@ en-@@ k@@ ol@@ l@@ bach , and in pe@@ ter@@ sha@@ us@@ en five classes .
from 196@@ 8 / 69 on@@ wards , these were handed over to the town hall in pe@@ ter@@ sha@@ us@@ en .
when the in@@ der@@ s@@ dorf school association was founded , only primary school remained in the village .
to avoid a down@@ grade in the now smaller school , the former re@@ actor geor@@ g si@@ g@@ l moved to kar@@ ls@@ fel@@ d and man@@ f@@ red rich@@ ter was appointed his success@@ or .
but pe@@ ter@@ sha@@ us@@ en grew , and so the children and their teachers were able to obtain the building that was built in september 198@@ 2 , and expanded in 1997 after judge &apos;s reti@@ rement .
man@@ f@@ red rich@@ ter p@@ raised the un@@ complicated gener@@ os@@ ity of the then may@@ or lu@@ d@@ wi@@ g g@@ ö@@ tz , who also built a workshop at community costs and , in 1997 , a cel@@ lar room , although this was not the guidelines .
&quot; may@@ or g@@ ö@@ tz was very scho@@ ol@@ -@@ friendly , &quot; rec@@ alled jud@@ ges grateful .
in his entire career , man@@ f@@ red rich@@ ter never for@@ got the speech of a government representative who was referring to a department of a school council on justice and justice : &quot; you must never forget love &quot; . man@@ f@@ red rich@@ ter jud@@ ges .
&quot; two things must be said to children : roots and w@@ ings , &quot; says the 8@@ 4-@@ year-@@ old .
and he had to know : &quot; this is not always possible &quot; , whether he is only talking about his students or his own six children , is not entirely clear .
in any case , jud@@ ges do sometimes was un@@ conventional .
when students checked , they were not given a penalty and were not given a seat to sit down .
at the expense of the community , jud@@ ges had let two p@@ it glo@@ ves and let the two counter@@ parties compete , even though it was a ve@@ il .
for the good of the school , jud@@ ges as rec@@ tor maintained a good relationship with the then may@@ or lu@@ d@@ wi@@ g g@@ ö@@ tz ( c@@ su ) .
he moved the par@@ tis@@ an judge after reti@@ ring to be the last judge in 1996 on the c@@ su list for the local council .

under the mo@@ tto &quot; cycling and celebr@@ ating on newly discovered paths between ni@@ d@@ da and kin@@ zi@@ g &quot; , the participants met in bad vil@@ bel on thursday and had a concert by van ba@@ ker &amp; band .
on friday , it became serious : the cy@@ cli@@ sts took the first stage , 60 kilometers over fl@@ or@@ stadt to bad salz@@ haus@@ en and further to sco@@ ts .
in bad salz@@ haus@@ en the athle@@ tes were awarded the prize for the first time by may@@ or han@@ s-@@ peter s@@ eu@@ m , who was on the bike in bad vil@@ bel and the manager of the own company bad salz@@ haus@@ en , pe@@ tra sch@@ w@@ inger .
to refres@@ h body and mind , there was a whole range of good things prepared : the women from the out@@ sk@@ ir@@ ts and the mo@@ ck@@ stadt had 85 sheets of apple , pl@@ un@@ ge , spr@@ ink@@ le and sc@@ at@@ ter cheese .
&quot; such ca@@ kes can only ba@@ ke women in rural areas , &quot; p@@ raised a particip@@ ant from au@@ len@@ di@@ e@@ bach , while he ordered another piece .
at the sports hall of the s@@ ge@@ i@@ ß@@ -@@ ni@@ d@@ da gy@@ m@@ na@@ si@@ um , cold refres@@ h@@ ments were obtained .
the du@@ o bra@@ vo enter@@ tained the visitors with well-known me@@ lo@@ dies from o@@ pe@@ re@@ tt@@ as and musi@@ c@@ als and har@@ ves@@ ted enthusi@@ astic applause .
the beautiful ambi@@ ence of the park was relaxing .
a lord also enjoyed a head massage from his partner : &quot; he deserves , he deserves , after all he has already ski@@ pped bicycle cha@@ ins now again &quot; .
meanwhile , the may@@ or and the manager of the company had to work : they were bur@@ ied at the well in front of the drinking cu@@ b house of re@@ porter ra@@ iner jan@@ ke and took the opportunity to broad@@ cast on the radio for bad salz@@ haus@@ en .
also ph@@ d to@@ bi@@ as h@@ agen , since the first hr@@ 4-@@ bike tour in 2004 , was able to quickly run , had he had plenty of experience with the technology on the spot .
his pic@@ k@@ up tr@@ uck , where he was played by three tele@@ phones and a radio station with his staff and the 15@@ -@@ person motor@@ cycle rela@@ y of the police of h@@ ess@@ en , was fac@@ e@@ book entries .
&quot; most of the participants come from the r@@ hin@@ e-@@ main region , &quot; he told , &quot; but also from gi@@ e@@ ß@@ en or ful@@ da , from lau@@ ter@@ bach or the ta@@ un@@ us and even from numerous cities in west@@ fal@@ en are .
the number of participants is a little based on the available accommodation capacities .
in category i , participants will be accommo@@ dated in hotels , in category ii in collec@@ ting accommodation .
from the spa town the cy@@ cli@@ sts had a good impression when they were re@@ sting after an hour and a half : &quot; b@@ low ! &quot;
&quot; it was beautiful in bad salz@@ haus@@ en ! &quot; they w@@ av@@ ed to f@@ are@@ well .
after arriving in sco@@ ts , the group was allowed to take a short break .
but in the evening the cy@@ cli@@ sts were in the id@@ yl@@ lic al@@ te@@ bur@@ g@@ park .
under the direction of the scot@@ tish tourism and urban marketing company ( g@@ ts ) , the park had a beautiful festival ambi@@ ence and of course it had ta@@ sty , e.g. fl@@ am@@ m@@ ku@@ chen with well cool@@ ed spr@@ ing@@ white spring water .
may@@ or sus@@ anne sch@@ a@@ ab , g@@ ts managing director mark@@ us ho@@ ß@@ fel@@ d and m@@ s@@ c chairman wol@@ f@@ gan@@ g wag@@ ner@@ -@@ s@@ ach@@ s in his capacity as ceo of the ad@@ ac h@@ ess@@ en-@@ thur@@ in@@ gia .
the three showed clearly pleased with the &apos; many businesses in scotland &apos; .
d@@ j to@@ bi@@ as h@@ agen subsequently released the dance stage .
the opportunity to move freely under the open sk@@ ies was not missed despite the sports activities on the bike .
the guests were increasingly inter@@ s@@ pers@@ ed with citizens who were as impres@@ sed by the good mo@@ od as the great sc@@ are of cy@@ cli@@ sts .
the second day the bir@@ stein , guar@@ dian bach and bad or@@ b stations - including a concert with the tren@@ k@@ wal@@ der - were on the agenda for the cy@@ cli@@ sts .
yesterday , after 18@@ 0 kilometers of cycling , the athle@@ tes met again in bad vil@@ bel .
do@@ z@@ ens of turkish police officers were arrested for &apos; con@@ spir@@ acy &apos; against the government .
a total of 33 police officers were arrested in turkey on susp@@ ici@@ on of &quot; con@@ spir@@ acy against the government &quot; , report local media agencies .
the police authorities did not make any immediate comment .
among the prisoners , 14 senior police officers , h@@ ür@@ ri@@ y@@ et dal@@ an , have reported .
some of them were involved in the corruption investigations against government officials , including four government ministers last december .
in july , a number of turkish police officers were arrested for sup@@ pos@@ ed@@ ly creating an organised criminal association and calling numbers .
turkish president rec@@ ep ta@@ y@@ y@@ ip er@@ do@@ gan ( who was then prime minister ) described their actions as part of the activities carried out by the islam@@ ist cl@@ er@@ ic fe@@ th@@ ul@@ la against him and other people in the country .
not all children in ukraine return to school .
schools almost everywhere in ukraine opened on monday ( september 1 ) after the summer holidays .
this day is tradi@@ tionally an important day for families , and as thousands of other ukra@@ inian parents have brought prime minister ar@@ sen@@ i@@ j ja@@ z@@ en@@ ju@@ k to school .
there he told waiting journalists that not all schools had re@@ opened , but that he was determined to prepare the country for future generations :
the september celebra@@ tions were not held at every school .
the sky is not peaceful across ukraine .
we must fight for a peaceful sky .
the entire ukraine , a huge common ukra@@ inian people &apos;s front , must fight for a peaceful sky .
ale@@ k@@ san pa@@ stu@@ k@@ how , school leader in sla@@ v@@ y@@ ans@@ k , the jaz@@ en@@ ju@@ k daughter visited , spoke in russian .
we hope that peace will finally be restored here and that children will be given an education that will be useful to them in their further lives .
the first school day of the new school year is tradi@@ tionally celebrated , with children em@@ bro@@ ide@@ red shir@@ ts we@@ aring bal@@ lo@@ ons in their hands and giving flowers to their teachers .
with r@@ ona fair@@ head , the bb@@ c has perhaps found the great director it needs .
it meets with a proud to@@ w@@ ering ch@@ est@@ nu@@ t from the banking world , media management and the tory party ’ s inner circle .
and she has her own front experience .
her career began with the global management consulting company ba@@ in and co . , where she joined mor@@ gan stan@@ ley , bom@@ ba@@ di@@ er , ic@@ i and the media world of pe@@ ar@@ s@@ ons .
she was the chairman of the financial times for seven years and re@@ signed when the chief position of the parent company pe@@ ar@@ s@@ ons was transferred to a younger male colleague .
their compensation was sup@@ pos@@ ed@@ ly close to £ 1 million .
their political ran@@ king is also solid .
she was named by david camer@@ on of lord bro@@ wn@@ e , former chairman of b@@ p , when he was asked to look for more private business knowledge in wh@@ ite@@ hall : she was appointed cab@@ in@@ et advis@@ er .
her hus@@ band is a former tory counc@@ ill@@ or .
as early as may , i described the role of the chairman with a po@@ is@@ oned cup .
not only is the bb@@ c a huge and complex entity at the heart of public life , but there is also an internal par@@ ado@@ x in its structure .
confidence has two directions : in@@ ward , on the first guard of its own management hier@@ arch@@ y in the bb@@ c , but also exter@@ n@@ ally as the voice of public concern and un@@ rest when things are going wrong .
this is what makes a du@@ o@@ pol almost un@@ sustainable , which demands a complete reform .
but what new chairman would risk calling for the european union to respond to everything and to dis@@ connect an institution as complex as a chinese dynamic .
it is a difficult task .
and as if that were not enough , many are still interested in reducing the bb@@ c - power that is money and status ob@@ sole@@ te .
as the competition dra@@ ws closer and new technologies thre@@ aten old , comfortable col@@ lateral , the forthcoming negotiation of licen@@ sing fees for the bb@@ c is bound to pose particular risks .
for the modest sum of £ 14@@ 5.@@ 50 per year , the british public bu@@ ys into the certainly largest media company in the world .
the bb@@ c tells a good story : it says it will reach 96 % of all house@@ holds , each of which will cost only 40 p@@ ence a day .
and it seems that the bb@@ c is rising on the popul@@ arity scale again : 53 % support today , in comparison with 31 % before 10 years .
the viewing and usage hab@@ its for the bb@@ c have changed : i get news head@@ lines today on my hand@@ set and see some missed news programmes later on my iphone .
but she remains a very be@@ loved and remarkable institution .
it needs a considerable chairman - i hope she found him .
per@@ ry from tex@@ as says that des@@ cen@@ ding t@@ we@@ et was not authorized .
a t@@ we@@ et from the republic@@ an govern@@ or ’ s official account of tex@@ as , ric@@ k per@@ ry , included a he@@ f@@ ty re@@ mark on the democratic district administration ’ s att@@ or@@ ney , which was at the heart of a political debate .
the t@@ we@@ et was later deleted and replaced by another from per@@ ry &apos;s account that removed the previous exit .
just is a t@@ we@@ et sent from my account that is not authorized by me .
&quot; i do not approve the t@@ we@@ et and have deleted it , &quot; it was said in the later message .
per@@ ry staff did not respond to requests for comments .
although the t@@ wee@@ ts are from per@@ ry &apos;s official user account , it was not clear who actually served the feed .
in the previous t@@ we@@ et was an un@@ favor@@ able image of the district prosecu@@ tor of trav@@ is county , ros@@ em@@ ary le@@ h@@ m@@ berg .
per@@ ry ve@@ to@@ ed the financial support of her office when she refused to return , but what led to an acc@@ us@@ ation against per@@ ry - possibly 20@@ 16 presidential candidate - who could be a presidential candidate .
the text of the t@@ wee@@ ts is : &quot; i am not always dr@@ un@@ k with the tri@@ ple permitted alcohol level ... but if i do , i compla@@ in to govern@@ or .
i am the most dr@@ un@@ ken democr@@ at in tex@@ as .
le@@ h@@ m@@ berg ’ s office was not in charge of the grand jury ’ s investigation of per@@ ry .
this was done by michael mc@@ cr@@ um , a special prosecu@@ tor from san ant@@ oni@@ o , who was selected by a republic@@ an judge .
per@@ ry ple@@ ads against not guil@@ ty and called the indic@@ tment a political tr@@ ick .
his highly qualified team of legal advis@@ ers requested a legal opinion from the judge responsible for the case , to den@@ oun@@ ce the charge and argu@@ ed that the law that was being used against the most senior govern@@ or in the history of the country .
per@@ ry stopped $ 7.@@ 5 million of government money to the public integrity unit of the state - which was in trav@@ is county - and was then transferred to the government .
this ve@@ to caused a public compla@@ int from a lef@@ t-@@ wing wat@@ ch@@ dog group .
per@@ ry &apos;s official user account is frequently updated - and sometimes famous .
after he was elected to the i@@ ow@@ a elections during his presidential candi@@ d@@ acy in 2012 , he went to the united states on spec@@ ulation that the election would ce@@ ase .
ber@@ ke@@ ley explains housing market as &quot; normal &quot; again .
one of london ’ s most prominent buil@@ ders pointed out that the housing market in the south-@@ east of england was once again at normal levels .
the capital &apos;s homes were very much sought after and the price increases , which made the bank of england a major contribu@@ tor to the widespread fear of a credit bu@@ b@@ ble .
ton@@ y pi@@ d@@ g@@ ley , founder and chairman of the board of directors of the high-@@ class construction company ber@@ ke@@ ley said on monday : &quot; since the beginning of the current financial year , the market has returned to normal transaction levels since 2013 &quot; .
the london real estate market was well placed during the down@@ turn , as foreign bu@@ yers pus@@ hed into the capital .
according to the cad@@ a@@ str@@ al office , the prices in the city area dro@@ pped by 18@@ .@@ 5 % last year alone , far more than the average increase in england and wal@@ es in total .
the average selling price for ber@@ ke@@ ley ’ s private , cheap and student offers rose by about a fifth in the past year , and was around 4@@ 23@@ ,000 £ at the end of april .
a stronger p@@ ound has , however , made property ownership in london less attractive to foreign bu@@ yers in recent months - some of them have also been ham@@ pe@@ red by the introduction of new property taxes and political rhe@@ tor@@ ic about a possible &quot; villa tax &quot; in may &quot; .
london ’ s real estate agent fo@@ x@@ tons war@@ ned last week that the mort@@ gage market report for april , in which the shar@@ per dollar of credit l@@ ending is expected to be published , was published in the second half of the year .
new bank data from england on monday show a decline in mort@@ gage allow@@ ance in july , which also indicates that the bank is in a better position to keep the housing market cool .
h@@ amp@@ tions international , another real estate agency , correc@@ ted his predic@@ tion of the rise in london home prices for 20@@ 15 down to 3 % , based on a already weak@@ ening domestic asset price .
the transaction volume in the most expensive areas of london , such as ch@@ el@@ sea , may@@ fair and ken@@ sing@@ ton , has now fallen by a quarter year on year , according to the bro@@ ker wa ell@@ is .
however , the desire for a home in the capital for ber@@ ke@@ ley is a bl@@ essing , as the su@@ ms due for future sales amount to more than £ 2.@@ 2 billion .
mr pi@@ d@@ g@@ ley added : &apos; the demand for the right , well-@@ planned product at the best locations has remained stable and as a result the sales of appoin@@ t@@ ments have also remained stable . &apos;
in june , the company reported that it had purchased 3,@@ 7@@ 42 new homes in the year until the end of april - almost a third more than at the peak in 2007 before the crisis .
the annual pre-@@ tax ear@@ nings rose by 40 percent to £ 2@@ 80 million , sales rose by 18 percent to £ 1.@@ 6 billion .
in a communication on monday before the company ’ s annual meeting , mr pi@@ d@@ g@@ ley said that revenue for ber@@ ke@@ ley is expected to exceed the current market expectations this year .
the analy@@ sts unanimously es@@ timate the annual pre-@@ tax result to be £ 4@@ 50 million .
ber@@ ke@@ ley shares were in london in the afternoon at 2@@ 3.@@ 96 £ .
nu@@ de photos of j@@ enni@@ fer law@@ rence by h@@ ack@@ ers published on the internet .
j@@ enni@@ fer law@@ rence gi@@ gs at the 8@@ 5th o@@ scar@@ ver@@ ze@@ ic@@ hn@@ ung .
nu@@ de photos of the o@@ sc@@ ar prize winner j@@ enni@@ fer law@@ rence were taken online by a h@@ ack@@ er who claimed to have a &quot; master list &quot; of images of another 100 star@@ lets .
a representative of the star from &quot; the tribute of pan@@ em &quot; confirmed that the photos of law@@ rence e@@ cht were real and compla@@ ined of the h@@ ack@@ er for &quot; bl@@ at@@ ant violation of privacy &quot; .
the authorities have been notified and will follow all those who have taken the sto@@ len photos of j@@ enni@@ fer law@@ rence .
the photos that were originally taken on the 4@@ ch@@ an photo sharing page were sup@@ pos@@ ed@@ ly marked by a gap in the online storage system ic@@ l@@ oud by apple .
it is not certain how many of the images are real , although win@@ ste@@ ad , star from &quot; scot@@ t pil@@ gri@@ m against the rest of the world &quot; also condemned the h@@ ack on t@@ wit@@ ter .
&quot; to those of you who look at photos that my hus@@ band and i took in the private environment of our house years ago - i hope you are really satisfied with you , &quot; win@@ ste@@ ad wrote on t@@ wit@@ ter .
victori@@ a justice from nic@@ hol@@ as series &quot; ic@@ arly &quot; and &quot; vic@@ to@@ ire &quot; series from the 195@@ 0s , however , claimed that the photos were images of her .
let us fight for the beginning of the game .
bu@@ zz@@ feed reported on late sunday that a spo@@ kes@@ man of the pop star ari@@ ana gran@@ de was ques@@ tioning the authentic@@ ity of the alleg@@ ed photos of her .
exclusive ex@@ cer@@ pt from ho@@ ward jac@@ ob@@ s@@ ons ’ highly p@@ raised new novel about love and the letter &quot; j &quot; .
they were broken , so it was best described , they slowly dis@@ solved like a car@@ ton that one could see in the rain .
occa@@ sion@@ ally a woman said to him that he was too serious , ex@@ hau@@ sting , intensive , di@@ stan@@ ced and perhaps a little scr@@ at@@ ch-@@ resistant .
and then sha@@ ken his hand .
scr@@ at@@ ch-@@ brus@@ hed he knew .
he was st@@ ing@@ y , as in i@@ gel , yes .
the last victim of this st@@ up@@ id@@ ity was a recent aff@@ air , which gave a more promising signal for alle@@ vi@@ ating the lon@@ ely bo@@ re@@ dom of his life than usual , and perhaps even brought him some satisfaction .
a@@ il@@ in@@ n sol@@ om@@ ons was a trem@@ bling ten@@ der beauty with un@@ t@@ amed hair and a fla@@ pping heart from a village on the north island that is even more remote and smo@@ other .
she was travelling south with an older compan@@ ion , ke@@ ver@@ n held for her a@@ un@@ t , and who had built a p@@ lot in a dam@@ p but paradise valley with the proper name paradise valley .
for several years no one had lived in the house .
the tu@@ bes were le@@ ak@@ y , the ba@@ ths were still sp@@ id@@ ers , nu@@ de ch@@ ests had their trac@@ es left on all windows and believed they belong@@ ed to all of them , and the garden was covered with wee@@ ds .
it was like the house from a children &apos;s fair@@ y tal@@ e , both threat@@ ening and temp@@ ting , a garden full of secre@@ ts .
por@@ tra@@ it of the author : ho@@ ward jac@@ ob@@ son , whose novel &quot; j &quot; is published on the long@@ list for the man boo@@ ker prize 20@@ 14 .
the short@@ list will be announced next week .
ke@@ ver@@ n had deal@@ ers with a@@ il@@ in@@ n on the broken dec@@ k chairs in the high gr@@ ass and had a excep@@ tionally warm spring afternoon .
your feet are too big .
because of their own aggres@@ si@@ veness , songs of this kind were no longer played on the con@@ sole .
not for@@ bi@@ dden - nothing was really for@@ bi@@ dden - just not played .
it was successfully ob@@ sole@@ te , as the word ob@@ sole@@ te .
the general taste created what dec@@ ree and regulation would never have achieved , and how people could have used vo@@ m rec@@ ord@@ ings to mil@@ li@@ on@@ ary me@@ mom@@ o@@ irs in books , cook@@ books and love books .
in the eu@@ ph@@ oria of the day , ke@@ ver@@ n began to play an imag@@ inary piano and to play in a co@@ ar@@ se com@@ ic se@@ ren@@ ade of ail@@ in@@ ns big feet .
a@@ il@@ in@@ n did not understand that .
&quot; this was a well-known song by a jazz pi@@ an@@ ist called f@@ ats w@@ all@@ er , &quot; he explained to her and automatically put two fing@@ ers on his li@@ ps .
this was what his father had always done to stop letter j before he was out of his mouth .
it had been started as a game between him and his father when he was still small .
his father had played it with his own father , so he had told .
if you start a word with a j without two fing@@ ers over your li@@ ps , it costs you a pen@@ ny .
it was not a very fun game then , and it was not very fun@@ ny either .
he knew that he was expected to do so , that was all .
it had to explain what jazz was .
a@@ il@@ in@@ n had never heard of one .
jazz , even if it was not directly for@@ bi@@ dden , was not played .
impro@@ vis@@ ation was no longer modern .
the room was very small , but the bathroom was very small .
at the beginning of a me@@ lo@@ dy , people wanted to be quite sure where they would end .
the same is true of mind .
his un@@ predic@@ tability made people ner@@ vous .
and jazz was musi@@ cally expressed mind .
although he had become 10 years old without being heard by sam@@ my dav@@ is junior , ke@@ ver@@ n knew something about jazz of the half secret band collection of old c@@ ds of his father .
but at least he did not have to explain to a@@ il@@ in@@ n that f@@ ats w@@ all@@ er was black .
she was probably unable to remember a time when pop@@ -@@ sing@@ ers were not black .
once again , no laws or constra@@ ints were applied .
a con@@ form@@ ist society meant that each element of this society was grateful to the principle of group talent - grateful as the ones spa@@ red from fate .
people of a@@ fro@@ -@@ caribbean origin were characterised by temper@@ ament and body building for entertainment and sport , meaning that san@@ ges and ran@@ ts were made .
people who originally came from the indian sub@@ continent were like nature with electronic talent .
what was left of the polish community was to look after the se@@ wer system ; what was left of the gre@@ e@@ ks was sh@@ at@@ tered plates .
those from the gulf states and the lev@@ ante , whose grand@@ parents did not leave the country quickly than what had happened when it happened - fe@@ ar@@ ful of being sho@@ c@@ ked by fire .
everyone according to their abilities .
since she had only heard bal@@ la@@ d , a@@ il@@ in@@ n found it difficult to understand how the insul@@ ting words that ke@@ ver@@ n had just brought her forward , the more likely she could be ton@@ ed down .
music was an expression of love .
&quot; they are not really off@@ ensive , &quot; said ke@@ ver@@ n .
except for people whose feet are too big .
my father never insul@@ ted anyone , but he loved this song .
he talked too much , but the negl@@ ected garden gave him the dec@@ ep@@ tive sense of security .
nothing could prevent the sound insul@@ ation of the huge car@@ b@@ on-@@ like leaves .
a@@ il@@ in@@ n still did not understand .
why would your father have liked such a thing ?
he wanted to say that it was a ju@@ x , but hesit@@ ated to put two fing@@ ers on the li@@ ps again in their presence .
she thought that he was a little strange anyway .
&quot; he seemed fun@@ ny , &quot; he said instead .
she sha@@ kes her head un@@ believ@@ ably and bloc@@ ked ke@@ ver@@ n &apos;s view .
there was nothing else in the world to see but their un@@ settled ra@@ v@@ aged black hair .
there was nothing he would have liked to see .
&quot; if you say it , &quot; do you mean it without convic@@ tion .
but that doesn &apos;t explain why you are thinking it out to me .
she seemed to be genuinely concerned .
are my feet too big ?
he looked again .
your feet so directly not .
maybe your an@@ k@@ les , a little bit ...
and tho@@ u sa@@ y@@ est me because my an@@ k@@ les are too th@@ ick ?
h@@ ate yourself ?
of course i h@@ ate you not .
that is just the st@@ up@@ id song .
he could have said &apos; i love you &apos; , but it was too early for that .
&quot; your th@@ ick an@@ k@@ les are exactly the reason why you like me , &quot; he tried it instead .
i am a little per@@ verse .
that did not sound right .
it was a fun@@ ny thing to say .
if he tried to be com@@ ical , he often found himself in trouble because he , like his father , did not have the so@@ o@@ thing charm that one needed to make the living in jo@@ kes .
perhaps his father also wanted to be cru@@ el .
perhaps he , ke@@ ver@@ n , wanted to be that .
despite his friendly eyes .
a@@ il@@ in@@ n sol@@ om@@ ons was red and raised from her dec@@ k chair , thre@@ w the con@@ sole around and sp@@ illed the be@@ ll , the wine she had dr@@ un@@ k .
wine of the f@@ lower , so dr@@ un@@ ken@@ ness was no exc@@ use for him .
in their ex@@ ci@@ tement , they seemed to trem@@ ble , as pal@@ m@@ we@@ del in the stor@@ m .
&quot; and your th@@ ick head is exactly why i &apos;m per@@ ver@@ ted to you , &quot; said she ...
besides that i am not at all .
she was sorry for him , both because of the unnecessary un@@ friend@@ liness of his words and the fear that appeared in her eyes when she stood up against him .
did she think he would beat her ?
she had not told him about life on the cold northern archi@@ pel@@ ago where she had grown up , but he had no doubt that it was essentially that way .
the same huge and ic@@ y ocean bro@@ ke here as there on the shore .
the same conf@@ used men , with even more th@@ ick@@ er skin and more sus@@ cep@@ tible to what happened than their an@@ ce@@ st@@ ors were as s@@ mu@@ gg@@ lers and beach rob@@ bers , pul@@ led from pub@@ s to pub@@ s .
th@@ ick head ?
they would have shown her a big f@@ ist if she didn &apos;t care !
you can take a look at the new website and find out what &apos;s going on in the next section .
ke@@ ver@@ n ’ s view was that this was unnecessary re@@ fin@@ ement , as the cr@@ un@@ ch itself was already an act of violence .
a@@ il@@ in@@ n sol@@ om@@ on gave him a sign to go through her body .
he rose from the dec@@ k chair as an old man .
she felt she was also staying , but the balance of his gri@@ ef surprised her .
that was not the end of the world .
they hardly knew each other .
she saw him as he di@@ stan@@ ced himself - as he was from a room on the top floor her compan@@ ion watching him - a man , compla@@ ined by something he himself invo@@ ked .
ad@@ am leaves the garden , she thought .
she felt a su@@ dden pain for him and men in general , although some had raised their hands against them .
a man turned away from her , his back pra@@ yed , ash@@ amed , defe@@ ated , without fighting spirit - why was this a sight that she had to know well ?
when she was alone again , a@@ il@@ in@@ n sol@@ om@@ ons looked at her feet .
several years before the events that have just been told , es@@ me n@@ us@@ s@@ bau@@ m worked , an intelligent and enthusi@@ astic 32 year old resear@@ cher commission@@ ed by of@@ now , the non-@@ legislative monitoring body for the european union .
&quot; a lot has been done , and much still needs to be done , &quot; she wrote , &quot; to explain the in@@ n@@ ate aggres@@ si@@ veness of a people that had w@@ aged a thousand wars and won most of them , especially in the remote cor@@ ners .
but some properties are in@@ ex@@ or@@ able .
the higher the tower , it seems , the less the passion it continues to ar@@ ou@@ se .
the people of europe are cr@@ ying in the hearing of s@@ enti@@ mental bal@@ la@@ d , ex@@ changing stories of overcome difficulties and asser@@ ting that they are firmly attached to the virtu@@ es of marriage and family life , but the former is not only the ro@@ h@@ s .
&quot; they have an unfortunate tend@@ ency to ex@@ ag@@ ger@@ ate , &quot; said their ment@@ or when he read the whole report .
i suggest that you read fewer nov@@ els .
es@@ me n@@ us@@ s@@ bau@@ m lo@@ wered her head .
i must also ask : are you a@@ the@@ ist ?
&quot; i do not think i have to say , &quot; es@@ me n@@ us@@ s@@ bau@@ m rep@@ lied .
are you les@@ bian ?
es@@ me again claimed her right to privacy and refused to make a statement .
fem@@ in@@ ist ?
silence is again being kept .
&quot; i don &apos;t ask that , &quot; lu@@ ther r@@ ab@@ in@@ o@@ wit@@ z finally said , &quot; because i am against a@@ the@@ ism , les@@ ben@@ ism or fem@@ in@@ ism .
this is a job without pre@@ jud@@ ice .
we are serving a society free of pre@@ jud@@ ice .
but certain types of hyper@@ sensi@@ tivity , which are in themselves perfectly acceptable and comm@@ end@@ able , can sometimes produce results as they have presented .
they themselves have obviously pre@@ jud@@ ice against the church , and these things , which they call &apos; dis@@ gu@@ sting &apos; and &apos; raw &apos; , could be as well seen by others as an expression of natural strength and vit@@ ality .
if you continue to ride around what happened when it happened , when it was , as if it had happened , it had happened yesterday , it means giving the country its essential vit@@ ality .
es@@ me n@@ us@@ s@@ bau@@ m looked around while r@@ ab@@ in@@ o@@ wit@@ z spoke .
behind his head , an led label in fl@@ am@@ ing@@ or@@ os@@ a repeated the advice that of@@ now gave to the country in the last quarter of a century or more .
sm@@ ile on your neighb@@ or , value your partner , listen to bal@@ la@@ d , visit musi@@ c@@ als , use your phone , talk , explain , listen to , vote .
speaking is better than being silent , the healthy word is better than the written , but nothing is better than love .
&quot; i understand absolutely what you want to say , &quot; es@@ me n@@ us@@ s@@ bau@@ m answered with calm voice when she was sure that her superi@@ or had finished speaking , &quot; and i say nothing else than that we were not able to speak effectively .
my concern is that we are not going to be able to find ourselves in the process of repe@@ ating the mistakes that have only just happened when it has happened .
this time , however , it is not the others we are suffering from , and are not , our an@@ ger and di@@ str@@ ust .
lu@@ ther r@@ ab@@ in@@ o@@ wit@@ z shaped a py@@ ram@@ id with his hands .
in order to suggest an ang@@ els pati@@ ence .
&quot; they go too far , &quot; he said , &quot; if you call acts &quot; errors &quot; that our grand@@ parents may or may not have committed .
they also go too far in saying that they will not be able to overcome their &quot; an@@ ger &quot; and their &quot; di@@ str@@ ust &quot; of &quot; other &quot; .
it should not be necessary to remind anyone in their position that we are not doing anything to help understanding the past , as we do to protect the present , but to speak of &apos; us &apos; and &apos; others &apos; .
there was no &apos; we &apos; and there was no &apos; other &apos; .
it was a time of dis@@ order , that is all we know .
&quot; from that , if we are honest to ourselves , &quot; d@@ ared to throw es@@ me , &quot; no part of society can claim to have beha@@ ved well .
i am not compla@@ ining to anyone .
whether it has been done badly or well , what has happened has happened .
that was then .
there is nothing more to say on this - we agree on that .
and , just as no blame must be assigned , no guil@@ t must be re@@ im@@ bur@@ sed if such a re@@ payment is appropriate and if there is a way to re@@ pay it .
but what is the past good for if we do not learn from it - and i am not going to learn from it - if we learn from it - and we do not learn from it - and , if we do not learn from it -
the past is to forget them .
if i may say something about this , i would like to say something about it .
lu@@ ther r@@ ab@@ in@@ o@@ wit@@ z let his py@@ ram@@ id collapse .
&quot; i will consider your report , &quot; he said and dis@@ missed it .
the next day , as usual , she went to work , she was over@@ taken by a motor@@ cy@@ c@@ list who , as described by pas@@ ser@@ s-@@ by , was in a kind of &quot; brut@@ al r@@ age &quot; on the road .
there are some coinci@@ d@@ ences .
les@@ o@@ th@@ o military member says that no cou@@ p d &apos;@@ é@@ t@@ at is planned ; prime minister remains in south africa ; in south africa , the prime minister remains in south africa .
military officials in les@@ o@@ th@@ o argu@@ ed that a cou@@ p d &apos;@@ é@@ t@@ at to over@@ throw the government would be in@@ effective in fighting polic@@ em@@ en who were denied the possibility of armed political fan@@ a@@ tics .
prime minister thomas th@@ ab@@ ane f@@ led the country and said that the country ’ s army would have re@@ located its headquarters and that government buildings in the capital , mas@@ er@@ u .
the premier brought his family to the ad@@ joining south africa after he was threatened with attack .
military spo@@ kes@@ man major n@@ te@@ le@@ le n@@ to@@ i said that there is no de fac@@ to cou@@ p , but that the military is respon@@ ding to the threat posed by &quot; political fan@@ a@@ tics &quot; whose arm@@ ament is based on the military .
&quot; what happened this morning was that the staff of the defense forces of les@@ o@@ th@@ o acted after he received several intelligence reports that were within the police some elements that were actually some of the political , party political fan@@ a@@ tics .
the south african government spo@@ kes@@ man cla@@ y@@ son mon@@ y@@ ela said that the military action was a tur@@ mo@@ il .
&quot; even if no one claimed that the government was se@@ ized by violence , all the reports agree that the activities of the defence forces of les@@ o@@ th@@ o have so far shown signs of a cou@@ p , &quot; he said .
spo@@ kes@@ man of the les@@ o@@ th@@ o military announced on sunday that the soldiers had to return to their bar@@ r@@ acks and improve the situation in the capital .
in the meantime , the vice-president mo@@ the@@ t@@ jo@@ ya me@@ tering takes over the governance during th@@ ab@@ ane ’ s absence .
th@@ ab@@ ane said that he believed he was being arrested for trying to reduce corruption in the country .
in les@@ o@@ th@@ o , there has been great tension since june , after th@@ ab@@ ane had parliamentary sit@@ t@@ ings suspended due to the disputes in his unity government .
he said that his actions did not undermine the government , that there were different acc@@ us@@ ations .
production in the euro area at a 13 month low
the increase in eurozone output slow@@ ed in august to lower levels , and the economic crisis has been a real oc@@ curren@@ ce .
the final mark purchasing management index of the manufacturing industry ( p@@ mi ) fell in august to 5@@ 0.@@ 7 in , after a bo@@ oth of 5@@ 1.@@ 8 in july .
a 50 is an expansion .
new orders were falling and fac@@ tories were falling at a time of rising ten@@ sions between the eu and russia over ukraine .
the figures are available before the european central bank ( ecb ) meeting on thursday .
markets expect a clear plan from the bank for dealing with a re@@ luc@@ t@@ ant eurozone recovery , and for the threat of de@@ fl@@ ation at a rate of only 0.@@ 3 % .
there is spec@@ ulation that the head of the ecb , mari@@ o drag@@ hi , will be able to provide further information later this week as to whether he will provide quanti@@ tative eas@@ ing for the eurozone , in line with that of the united kingdom and britain .
&quot; although small growth is better than no growth at all , the slow@@ ing effects of the growing economic and geo@@ political un@@ certain@@ ties have become clearer for manufacturers , &quot; said ro@@ b do@@ b@@ son , senior econom@@ ist at mark .
the factory p@@ mi for germany , russia &apos;s largest trading partner in the eu , fell to its lowest level in 11 months with 5@@ 1.@@ 4 .
meanwhile , the second largest economy in the blo@@ c , france , the p@@ mi , fell to 4@@ 6.@@ 9 .
france remains a problem child , as is italy ’ s des@@ cent from solid expansion to stag@@ nation .
evidence that stimul@@ us for growth is in the key indu@@ str@@ y-@@ driven mechanism of germany , as well as in spain and the netherlands , is also un@@ re@@ ass@@ uring , &quot; said mr do@@ b@@ son .
the decline in industry is likely to fuel the fire of analy@@ sts who are creating further monetary or fiscal incentives .
one positive news came from the republic of ireland , where the p@@ mi rose to 5@@ 7.@@ 3 , the highest level since the end of 1999 .
ho@@ ward ar@@ cher , chief econom@@ ist at i@@ h@@ s global insight , said : &quot; the best thing you can do for the purchasing management index of the manufacturing industry in the euro area from august .
he added : &apos; producers in the euro area seem to find life quite difficult at the moment , as the current hei@@ ghten@@ ed geo@@ political ten@@ sions - particularly with regard to russia and ukraine - have caused uncertainty in the still difficult conditions in many countries .
these increased un@@ certain@@ ties have clearly affected the economy - in particular , and consumer confidence , and probably lead to some orders being dela@@ yed or even cancelled .
he said that it would become &apos; more and more likely &apos; that the ecb would eventually have to launch a kind of q@@ e , &apos; although we susp@@ ect that this will be limited . &apos;
the hel@@ l decade of bes@@ lan survi@@ v@@ ors : ten years have passed since the terrible sie@@ ge of the school , as the en@@ mes@@ hed children have still suffered .
ten years ago , more than 1@@ ,000 people were killed by chec@@ hen mil@@ i@@ ti@@ as in a school in bes@@ lan in southern russia .
more than 3@@ 30 people , more than half of them children , were killed in the three-@@ day mar@@ ty@@ r@@ dom that sho@@ c@@ ked the world .
we returned to bes@@ lan to meet some of the victims who were killed in the ab@@ om@@ ination in the class@@ room .
exactly a decade after the app@@ alling sie@@ ge of bes@@ lan school , where 3@@ 34 people were killed , including 18@@ 6 children , the hel@@ den@@ ic survi@@ v@@ ors war@@ ned last night of a new apo@@ c@@ aly@@ pse .
as fan@@ a@@ tical islam@@ ist terrorists , children and parents were killed on 1 september 2004 , when a new school year began , and they were killed , as it seemed to be the most evil of evil .
the tragedy united west and east in ab@@ hor@@ rence , and then turned into more surprising , action and hope for the future , in the worst of mis@@ ery .
ten years later , we returned to bes@@ lan to meet some of the victims who died in the ab@@ om@@ ination in the class@@ room .
we found surprising young people who overcome resistance , although memory of these terrorist ca@@ us@@ alities made them persecu@@ te fore@@ ver .
your greatest hope ?
the fact that the war that is now pl@@ agu@@ ing ukraine - and in which children like you are dying - is now coming to an end .
the girl who was photograph@@ ed in the attempt to get into the sh@@ at@@ tered school sports hall is now in a very difficult position .
she was shot by the russian star photograph@@ er di@@ mit@@ ri beli@@ ak@@ ov and famous when she was only in her under@@ wear trying to get into the sh@@ at@@ tered school sports hall .
a@@ id@@ a was completely conf@@ used with her mother l@@ ar@@ is@@ sa , now 40 years old .
both were held dead , but they survi@@ ved .
&quot; a woman told me i should race for my life , but i could not , &quot; said a@@ id@@ a at that time .
my leg@@ s were floo@@ ded with blood .
i stood up and clim@@ bed in to go to my mother .
a soldi@@ er brought them to safety .
after a number of operations , she thought she was completely heal@@ ed , but said yesterday : &quot; three months ago the pain returned .
i am afraid that i have to be sur@@ ged again .
some sh@@ ards of gran@@ at@@ omas are still in my k@@ ne@@ es .
your goal is to become a d@@ enti@@ st to help people , as you are helped by doctors .
&quot; this tragedy changed my life , but it did not break me , &quot; she says camp@@ flu@@ ff@@ y .
&quot; that happened to me and that cannot be changed .
once a year i always go to the sports hall to remember those who stayed there .
my friends and i try not to talk about it on other days .
the pain is too great .
my best friend and future class@@ m@@ ate d@@ zer@@ a ga@@ po@@ eva was killed there .
we played together when we were small and dre@@ amed of joining the school .
&quot; i do not want to mar@@ ry until i finish my studies and start my career .
i am thinking of a family later on .
she says that the sie@@ ge will always remain part of it , although the memory gets a little weak every year .
i am glad that many people around the world remember our hor@@ r@@ ors and we are so grateful for the help we received from people in britain and everywhere .
when i see the photo of me online as i clim@@ b back to school , i think that many people think it is the first time that they see our disaster and help to ensure that this does not happen again .
the boy who fle@@ w through the ball ho@@ o@@ ks , in the opinion that his mother was dead , and that his mother was dead .
it was his first school day ( rus@@ sians go to school at the age of 7 ) and survi@@ ved the three-@@ day sie@@ ge in the arms of his mother tam@@ ara .
as a se@@ ven@@ -@@ year old , he said , &apos; m@@ ama told me that i should lie down when there was an explo@@ sion and hold her hand . &apos;
after an explo@@ sion he thought she would die .
she said to him : &quot; run . &quot;
fe@@ ar@@ ful that she could be dead , he f@@ led and saw a we@@ eping little child on the way , se@@ ized it by hand and fle@@ w through a ball ho@@ o@@ dle .
his father v@@ la@@ di@@ mir , who had his son in the arms outside , said : &quot; dam@@ ir told me that his mother had died .
he said : &apos; i could not save them &apos; .
in reality , tam@@ ara was st@@ um@@ b@@ led outside and in@@ ju@@ red in the hospital , in turn , assum@@ ing that her son had died .
after her re@@ unification she said : &apos; i we@@ pt for joy .
i could not believe it .
he ran in and hu@@ gged me .
dam@@ ir was later fle@@ eing to london ( from the meanwhile dis@@ solved news of the world newspaper ) to be replaced by the then prime minister ton@@ y bla@@ ir and his wife ch@@ eri@@ e by a bar@@ nar@@ do &apos;s children .
&quot; this hor@@ ror ha@@ un@@ ts you every day , but i wish i could stop re@@ member@@ ing , &quot; he said yesterday .
but i can say that in my memory it becomes ble@@ ak@@ er .
i still know that i can see all my to@@ y gun@@ s right after that .
but now i can play computer games with shot scenes and that is no problem for me .
&quot; i am not afraid to go back to the sports hall , but i do not think about myself .
i remember those children with whom i played in the court and who did not go out .
we never say that they were killed or dead .
we say that you have stayed in the sports hall .
i remember very well my trip to london , especially the to@@ y store , where i had to choose everything i wanted .
but now he is afraid of places like ukraine , where wars cause the kind of mis@@ fortun@@ es he and his friends have suffered .
this hor@@ ror ha@@ un@@ ts you every day , but i wish i could stop re@@ member@@ ing it .
&quot; i &apos;m so sorry for all those who suffer from the ab@@ om@@ inations , &quot; dam@@ ir said , who last week as a volunte@@ er worked in a monaster@@ y .
i would like to help you .
one day i want to go to the police and i hope that next year they will take me to the school academy of education .
his mother tam@@ ara , 48 , said : &quot; 37 children from our neighbourhood were killed , you can imagine that ?
i remember the terrible silence after the sie@@ ge , there was simply no children calling and sh@@ ou@@ ting .
she vi@@ vi@@ dly rec@@ alls her trip to london with dam@@ ir .
the people of london cr@@ y when i told our story .
i understood at that time how people on the other side of the world could understand our feel@@ ings and show their support .
she was grateful to ch@@ eri@@ e bla@@ ir and her foundation for the prize and the opportunity to travel to london in autumn 2004 .
i wish i could call ch@@ eri@@ e and just tell her that 10 years have passed , but i still remember the meeting i had with her and her hus@@ band in london and how the dam@@ ir and me helped .
i remember how dam@@ ir li@@ kes to eat bor@@ sch@@ ts@@ ch and she has ea@@ ten all local russian restaurants .
i remember him talking to wa@@ it@@ ers in a restaurant , dam@@ ir was sho@@ oting with his water gun and she ran@@ g away and playing with the boy .
and that was just a month after the hor@@ ror .
i was surprised that the british were so willing to share our pain and to support us .
she said : &apos; i always think that this world has not improved in these 10 years .
in ukraine , the war is now continuing , and every day people are dying , and i believe that many children have been killed and are still being killed .
these are just children like ours .
i think that for many of the war is part of the news that you hear when you get bo@@ red or busy with something else .
i simply know what these people feel , all the hor@@ ror .
and i cannot stop feeling that .
nothing has changed , people still want to kill each other and that is so sad .
dam@@ ir became big and is a very gent@@ le and quiet boy , he is not aggres@@ sive or an@@ gr@@ y at all .
for example , he is not looking for reven@@ ge , he is not overwhel@@ med by the past hor@@ r@@ ors .
i know he does not like to remember that , but he has six close friends from the class and they occa@@ sion@@ ally go to the sports hall and fire c@@ and@@ les there .
when he was smaller , he suffered - i remember how he sometimes looked at the sof@@ a , the face of us turned off , hours of work .
not sle@@ eping , his eyes were open .
i also remember how he used all his weapons and other military to@@ ys , and dam@@ ir is now 17 , larger than i am .
i can hardly believe that i was so sure that he was dead for a few hours and i would never see him again .
when i reco@@ vered after the explo@@ sion and came on my leg@@ s , i looked around and saw hel@@ l around me , with around me , with body parts around .
i was absolutely sure that my little boy would not have survi@@ ved in that hel@@ l .
&quot; i remember that i called him to &quot; dam@@ ir , run , run away &quot; , but i was also so sure that he would not have heard me .
but he heard it and he has gone .
and so life goes , unlike that of many others , for us .
geor@@ gi@@ j il@@ y@@ in , 17
the boy , whose terrible image after the sie@@ ge became a symbol of the ab@@ om@@ inations of bes@@ lan , became the symbol of the ab@@ om@@ ination of bes@@ lan .
comfort : the bes@@ lan survi@@ v@@ or geor@@ gi@@ j ly@@ in with his mother fa@@ tim@@ a after the sie@@ ge of 2004 , right a picture of geor@@ gi@@ j today .
his bloo@@ d@@ sh@@ ed was characterized by fear when he ran@@ ked for his life , while chec@@ hen terrorists were losing his class@@ mates .
his image was one of the most sho@@ cking symb@@ ols of bes@@ lan bar@@ bar@@ ism .
his mother fa@@ tim@@ a , 54 , a doctor , had chosen him for his first school day before she rus@@ hed to leave her older son v@@ la@@ di@@ mir to the university .
&quot; i left the court about two minutes before the terrorists stor@@ med it , and so my little boy stayed there for three terrible days alone , &quot; she re@@ members .
not quite alone , there was a whole family of rela@@ tives of us , but they were all killed .
only my geor@@ gi@@ j managed to survive .
the closer this date comes , the har@@ der it is to think about it and talk about it .
there is not a single day when we cannot remember this tragedy .
we do not think it is long ago , i think it would have happened yesterday , to follow some scenes from these days fore@@ ver .
no one will ever forget that , i promise you .
for@@ ce@@ fully : the image of geor@@ gi@@ j ( left ) was one of the most sho@@ cking of the attack and was described as stat@@ ue ( right ) .
i remember geor@@ gi@@ j being so happy to go to school this day , he said he wanted to re@@ stra@@ in his teacher .
i knew he was alive when i saw him on television .
and now there is even this stat@@ ue of we@@ eping geor@@ gi@@ j in san mar@@ ino .
geor@@ gi@@ j doesn &apos;t like the picture and it is home in our book@@ shel@@ f .
i understand that , but i also think that people around the world , thanks to this image , feel our pain .
geor@@ gi@@ j says today : &apos; it is important that this kind of thing can never happen again .
&quot; i doubt that we will ever know the truth .
people continue to investigate such trag@@ e@@ dies and never experience the truth .
and now investigate the cr@@ ash of this bo@@ eing in ukraine .
will we ever know what caused it ?
this world is becoming a terrible thing .
&quot; i cannot understand how this is possible , because if you ask people , no one wants a war , so how is it done ?
ten years is nothing at all with such pain .
we need do@@ z@@ ens of years to forget it a little .
it has att@@ acked my health and i still feel it .
for about three or four years i had a few night@@ ma@@ res because of sie@@ ge , but then it became better .
i went back to school in 2004 and was afraid every day .
i thought of my friends and class@@ mates who were killed .
that is why i always go to the sports hall when 1 september approaches .
i want to pay tribute to my old child@@ hood friends .
it is difficult for me to go to the sports hall , but i have to do it .
i do not feel a victim , this story is now part of my past .
i will not forget it , but i do not regret it .
my life continues .
i finished school this year and i am visiting a medical university in v@@ la@@ di@@ ka@@ w@@ ka@@ z .
i will be heart sur@@ ge@@ on .
my first choice was an education in the army .
i wanted to be a soldi@@ er , but my health did not allow that .
i wanted to fight for my country , but that will not happen .
geor@@ gi@@ j fan@@ i@@ ye@@ v , 20
the boy who survi@@ ved , though he was at the foot of a mur@@ der@@ ous terrorist , was cap@@ tured by a mur@@ der@@ ous terrorist .
a mir@@ acle : geor@@ gi@@ j f@@ ani@@ ye@@ v was at the foot of a mur@@ der@@ ous terrorist during the sie@@ ge , but he managed to survive .
during the sie@@ ge , he was caught in the sports hall and sat next to the bom@@ b at the foot of a mur@@ der@@ ous terrorist .
it is a real mir@@ acle that he was not killed .
&quot; we feel it was yesterday , &quot; says geor@@ gi@@ j , who is working as intelligence officer for the f@@ s@@ b , but because of his health damage due to the sie@@ ge .
it is still with me , it is not something i left behind .
i am now older and people say that children can easily deal with bad experiences - i have to say that is not true .
&quot; in 2006 i worked with psycho@@ logi@@ sts and felt a little better after that , but i can not forget it .
and i would like to forget .
2005 - in the year after - was the first and only time i went back to the sports hall .
i lost consci@@ ousness .
i will never return to it and please do not ask me to show you where i can be in this famous picture .
survi@@ v@@ ors : geor@@ gi@@ j f@@ ani@@ ye@@ v today , with a photo of himself in the hospital after the sie@@ ge on the lap@@ top after the sie@@ ge on the lap@@ top .
my pain is immen@@ se and i wear it with me every day .
my friends know that i do not like to think about it or talk about it and they never asked me about school .
i am physi@@ cally well off .
i should be careful with my w@@ oun@@ ded k@@ ne@@ e , but i can now run well .
but because of my health i could not attend the f@@ s@@ b ’ s secret service academy in saint pe@@ ter@@ sburg as i wanted .
i have submitted my documents , including the medical documents , and you have rep@@ lied that it is not possible .
my second passion was the animals , so i went to the veter@@ inary institute .
i have been behind me for two years .
he lear@@ ns the treatment of all animals from c@@ ats to co@@ ws .
he said : &apos; i knew i had never told my children about my experiences .
children should not know about this , and they should not , of course , suffer it .
his mother marina , 42 , said : &quot; this pain never leaves me .
it is in my soul , worse when the anniversary is appro@@ aching .
i will go to the celebra@@ tions to comm@@ em@@ or@@ ate .
i know that georgia will not go .
he must be much more vigor@@ ous because he was there and i do not .
i wa@@ ited at home for him and could not help .
i am so grateful to god that he has been given back to me , and here in bes@@ lan all of them are drawn .
it remains in us .
geor@@ gi@@ j is now an adult , but this hor@@ ror is still in him .
it is difficult to accept that if something so unfair is encoun@@ tered .
he is a boy , he li@@ kes sport , but he cannot participate because of his k@@ ne@@ es .
he has been operated several times , he can run but he can not do sport .
i would say that he is 50 % behind the hor@@ ror , but you can never completely forget that .
this terrible experience will always be with us .
many friends and neighbours were killed during the sie@@ ge , and this only rein@@ forces my pain .
i have lost many people , whom i knew well and who were expensive to me .
my son is with me , and that is the greatest gift that god could make me , but my heart cr@@ ying for the killed .
i know of families where new children were born , but also of wi@@ do@@ ws who have never again married .
it is difficult to accept that life will continue , even if that is not what we want .
i will never forget how my heart jum@@ ped in me when i saw him in hospital .
and now i see what is happening in the world - wars in other regions .
what are these people fighting for ?
why kill each other ?
the war is now very close to our country and i almost cannot believe it .
we were a friendly country in the past , how can it be that we are fighting now ?
people and children suffer , i am sure that many children have already been killed in ukraine and many are still being killed .
if we only gr@@ as@@ p and throw out all these re@@ be@@ ls - as far as possible .

4 tips for better under@@ water photos and videos
if you would like to take photos or videos under water , there is a selection of devices .
the che@@ apest option is a water@@ tight poin@@ t-@@ and-@@ sho@@ ot , as the ni@@ kon cool@@ pi@@ x aw@@ 120 or an ac@@ tion-@@ c@@ am like the g@@ op@@ ro her@@ o@@ 3 + sil@@ ver edition , which is both for sale .
i took these photos at a family festival with several cameras , all at a price of under $ 3@@ 50 .
regardless of the equipment , there are some rules for the best results .
check your equipment twice .
even if you have a water@@ proof camera , make sure that the battery com@@ part@@ ment and other com@@ part@@ ments are se@@ aled .
also put your camera on the photos or videos you want to record .
some cameras and cam@@ c@@ order have scene and recording modes that allow the exposure to be reduced for the insul@@ ation of the dam@@ p under@@ water conditions .
and before you jum@@ p in , check to what depth your equipment is functional .
some cameras are only allowed for up to 5 feet , others up to 50 or 60 feet .
search our shopping guide and the reviews for digital cameras for conventional and water@@ proof models .
take multiple rec@@ ord@@ ings - because many will not work .
poin@@ t-@@ and-@@ sho@@ ot cameras have an l@@ cd that lets you com@@ pose images , ac@@ tion@@ -@@ c@@ am normally not .
even if you have an l@@ cd , it is difficult to see this under water , and the right image setting is a matter of lu@@ ck .
so you do a lot of sho@@ ts .
if your camera has a row mode that allows you to capture a number of sho@@ ts with slightly changed exposure settings , use it .
stay close to the surface .
the light becomes dram@@ atically worse as it moves away from the surface .
so , if possible , they stay close to the surface when you take pictures in a pool , a lake or the sea .
this allows you to bring more color to your photos ; the de@@ eper you go , the less color you will see .
go close to the objects .
this is good advice on land , but it is all the more important under water because of the poor light conditions .
it is particularly important when you are working with an action c@@ am : these devices often have a fixed wide angle lens , which means that you can use po@@ e@@ try to approach your objects when they are in full range .
andre@@ w law@@ son was a man of the variety whose character changes things , even in such a gi@@ gan@@ tic organization as the n@@ h@@ s .
as an an@@ es@@ the@@ si@@ st , he devoted his career to helping the si@@ ck to understand both the ag@@ ony of the disease and the pain of treatment .
among his patients , his wife rec@@ alls , was a mi@@ 6 employee who was confron@@ ted with the dev@@ ast@@ ating effects of torture .
law@@ son knew that doctors were not given the diagno@@ sis and disease , while the treated sur@@ gery was mostly associated with something quite different : pain .
one day in 2007 , however , he was the one whose path of suffering began .
&quot; i did not feel , &quot; he wrote in may this year .
i had difficulty getting up .
while he was inf@@ ected with fl@@ u symp@@ t@@ oms , he noticed that he had in@@ ju@@ red his wife im@@ pati@@ ently .
&quot; i want everything to be done immediately rather than later , &quot; he noted .
when ju@@ li@@ et was on a business trip for a week , law@@ son felt quite unusual and un@@ concerned .
something lay in the air .
he asked a colleague to conduct an x-@@ ray examination of his bre@@ ast .
only two weeks ago he was in the french alps for skiing .
the results of the x-@@ ray examination were available .
he suffered from mes@@ o@@ the@@ li@@ om@@ a , a incur@@ able cancer that could cause the bre@@ ast co@@ at , that is , the skin that over@@ lo@@ ses the lun@@ gs .
as with most can@@ c@@ ers , the exact tri@@ gger is usually difficult to determine .
for example , while some smo@@ kers are suffering from l@@ ung cancer , not all l@@ ung cancer patients have been smo@@ kers in the past .
but mes@@ o@@ the@@ li@@ om@@ a is different .
in almost all cases , the tri@@ gger is an as@@ be@@ sto@@ s load - contact with the fi@@ bre material , which was once considered a &quot; wonder material &quot; but has since been identified as dead@@ ly .
for most of us , mes@@ o@@ the@@ li@@ om is a disease that can be ignored as easily .
after all , as@@ be@@ sto@@ s is a product of the past .
the most dangerous type of as@@ be@@ sto@@ s has not been used in britain since the 196@@ 0s , when the industry volun@@ tar@@ ily committed itself to no longer using it .
even where it was still used , only people in certain sectors worked directly with the fab@@ ric - pl@@ um@@ ber , construction workers , car@@ pen@@ try and shi@@ py@@ ard workers , for example .
as an industrial hazar@@ dous material from another era , it seems today to be hardly worrying .
but this com@@ plac@@ ency is in@@ appropriate .
britain , it seems , is now at the height of a mes@@ o@@ the@@ li@@ om ep@@ ide@@ mic .
there are more deaths from mes@@ o@@ the@@ li@@ om@@ a here than in any other country in the world .
with a total of 2,@@ 500 deaths per year , twice as many people die from this disease as they do in road accidents .
annual figures for mes@@ o@@ the@@ li@@ om@@ a deaths since 1980 and prospec@@ tive future deaths in the uk
the reason we are now experiencing the dead@@ ly effects , even though as@@ be@@ sto@@ s has been illegal for years ( in 1999 all types of as@@ be@@ sto@@ s were banned ) , is that a mes@@ o@@ the@@ li@@ om only develops after decades .
and the s@@ cour@@ ge of the mes@@ o@@ the@@ li@@ om is not con@@ fined to former workers in the construction industry .
as@@ be@@ sto@@ s was , and is often still , present in the houses in which we live , the offices in which we work , the schools in which we learn and the shops in which we shop .
and therefore mes@@ o@@ the@@ li@@ om knows no class barriers , financial borders , profes@@ sions or age .
the privileged bas@@ tions , from the elegant department stores in london to private schools , are not a protec@@ tive space .
parliament buildings are contam@@ inated by as@@ be@@ sto@@ s .
even in the hospit@@ als , where we are supposed to be healthy , we are already starting to use this dead@@ ly car@@ cin@@ o@@ gen@@ ic gen@@ e .
andre@@ w law@@ son was not old .
he was not a pl@@ um@@ ber either .
he was indeed finding it hard to imagine where he might be able to come into contact with as@@ be@@ sto@@ s .
then he found out .
&quot; it looks as if the tun@@ nels at the gu@@ y &apos;s hospital , where i have spent six years of my training , are a lot of as@@ be@@ sto@@ s . &quot;
all - students , nur@@ ses , doctors and guar@@ di@@ ans - use the tun@@ nels .
one won@@ ders how many of my con@@ tempor@@ aries will suffer from the same disease ?
unfortunately , he could at least partly answer that question .
&quot; of the four doctors who worked at gu@@ y &apos;s hospital , and the four in the last five years at mes@@ o@@ the@@ li@@ om@@ a , &quot; he wrote .
how many of us will be si@@ ck ?
at andre@@ w law@@ son , mes@@ o@@ the@@ li@@ om was diagno@@ sed at the age of 48 .
when he died on 17 february this year , he was 55 .
this was an un@@ usually long life@@ time .
fif@@ ty percent of all mes@@ o@@ the@@ li@@ o@@ se@@ -@@ rich diseases die within 8 months of diagno@@ sis .
the disease always ends in death .
we can only repeat law@@ son &apos;s question : &apos; how many of us will be si@@ ck ? &apos;
britain ’ s leading expert on mes@@ o@@ the@@ li@@ om@@ a , professor ju@@ lian pe@@ to , assum@@ es that between 18@@ 70 and 20@@ 50 , when as@@ be@@ sto@@ pi@@ d@@ gery is expected to st@@ all in the uk , 9@@ 0,000 will be .
most of them have no idea at the moment that they will die like that .
an as@@ be@@ sto@@ s mine in que@@ be@@ c , canada al@@ am@@ y
a brief look at the files of the courts , to which the people concerned often turn for claims for damages , shows how far the s@@ cour@@ ge of the mes@@ o@@ the@@ li@@ om is already widespread .
in june this year marks &amp; sp@@ enc@@ er , for example , ad@@ mitted that jan@@ ice was neglig@@ ently exposed to as@@ be@@ sto@@ s .
she worked for the chain for nine years , from 197@@ 8 to 198@@ 7 and was responsible for the gar@@ ment department at two locations , one of which is the flag@@ ship store at ox@@ ford street .
m@@ r@@ s. allen was only 18 years old when she began her work at m &amp; s .
now she has two children in the tw@@ en@@ ties .
&quot; before this thing , &quot; she says , &quot; i had never heard of mes@@ o@@ the@@ li@@ om , i didn &apos;t even know anything about as@@ be@@ sto@@ s .
i never thought that would concern me .
there are few people who know a lot about as@@ be@@ sto@@ s .
the fact is that the term as@@ be@@ sto@@ s is not a substance but a group of six min@@ er@@ als .
the name deri@@ ves from the word &quot; as@@ be@@ sto@@ s &quot; , a description of the fi@@ bre structure that makes the fab@@ ric resistant and flexible .
three of the six were used in the construction industry .
ch@@ ry@@ so@@ til , also known as white as@@ be@@ sto@@ s , is by far the most common as@@ be@@ sto@@ s found in buildings today .
it was designed for roof@@ ing plates , flo@@ oring , ro@@ h@@ ro@@ h@@ al sol@@ ations , bo@@ il@@ er@@ soli@@ dation , even for bra@@ ke lin@@ ings in cars .
it is less le@@ th@@ al than other forms of as@@ be@@ sto@@ s , but it is still regarded by the eu and the who as a &apos; major health risk &apos; with possible death consequences .
however , the brown as@@ be@@ sto@@ s ( am@@ o@@ sit ) and the blue as@@ be@@ sto@@ s ( k@@ ro@@ ky@@ dol@@ ith ) are more dangerous .
britain was once the world ’ s largest im@@ porter of brown as@@ be@@ sto@@ s , and experts susp@@ ect that &quot; it has clear but indirect indic@@ ations that this is a major reason for the uni@@ qu@@ ely high mes@@ o@@ the@@ li@@ om@@ a rates . &quot;
a mark@@ s-@@ sp@@ enc@@ er employee was registered at the flag@@ ship store at ox@@ ford street , london , as@@ be@@ sto@@ s , al@@ am@@ y .
jan@@ ice allen may not have been a typical mes@@ o@@ the@@ li@@ om@@ op@@ per , but the work of ju@@ lian pe@@ to suggests that the time has not changed its history .
he has presented a study by the people concerned which shows that &apos; a significant proportion of mes@@ o@@ the@@ li@@ omas can be produced without known suspension by work or in the house pre@@ sum@@ ably by as@@ be@@ sto@@ s contact in the environment &apos; .
he said that a large part of these contacts is based on the &quot; normal use and aging &quot; of our buildings .
it looks as if no one can assume that they are safe .
a report by go@@ d@@ d@@ ard consulting , which describes the palace of west@@ min@@ ster , shows how people live in the heart of the government , un@@ kno@@ w@@ ingly exposed to the substance .
in 2009 , go@@ d@@ d@@ ard reported that the service p@@ its and pipel@@ ines were behind parliament &apos;s committee rooms contam@@ inated with as@@ be@@ sto@@ s , whose dead@@ ly fi@@ b@@ res were replaced by something as harm@@ less as &quot; strong air movements &quot; .
members of parliament are often accused of car@@ ing for their own interests , but it seems that this is the opposite .
while the parliamentary labour service director@@ ate insi@@ sted that the west@@ min@@ ster palace should be a &apos; clean health certificate &apos; , it is now un@@ dispu@@ ted that 1 billion £ of work is spent over several years .
the go@@ d@@ d@@ ard report also pointed out that &apos; the presence of as@@ be@@ sto@@ s cannot be handled in accordance with the relevant provisions &apos; .
no one can know whether this mis@@ management will cost lives .
all that can be done now is wait .
a person who never knows exactly what to do with as@@ be@@ sto@@ s is gra@@ ham ab@@ bot@@ t , a general practi@@ tion@@ er .
as andre@@ w law@@ son suggests , the 50@@ -@@ year-@@ old ab@@ bot@@ t susp@@ ects that he was exposed to as@@ be@@ sto@@ s during his work in hospit@@ als .
&quot; i have worked in a hospital where as@@ be@@ sto@@ s complaints were decided posi@@ tively , &quot; he says , &quot; but i can not prove it in my case .
it is so difficult to remember where you worked .
what he re@@ members is exactly the day at the beginning of december 2009 , when he was getting a kind of fe@@ ver .
he was 45 and was just carrying out an operation late in the evening .
suddenly i had a sha@@ ke .
it happened all of a su@@ dden .
i felt hor@@ ri@@ ble .
i thought the trip home could not be created any more .
as a doctor , ab@@ bot@@ t knew that the pain was caused by the ch@@ est co@@ at , the skin around his lun@@ gs .
but , like jan@@ ice all , he had no reason to susp@@ ect a mes@@ o@@ the@@ li@@ om .
he did not go to work for a month .
surprised doctors turned x-@@ ray sho@@ ts of his bre@@ ast and put pe@@ ur@@ a@@ ka@@ the@@ ther to remove liqui@@ ds from the lun@@ gs and to use them in the laboratory .
however , his complaints remained un@@ diagno@@ sed .
his health improved slowly , and he returned to his job .
from time to time , however , the symp@@ t@@ oms returned , often after physical activity and violent bre@@ a@@ thing .
in 2011 , a patient ab@@ bot@@ t with similar symp@@ t@@ oms came into practice and was diagno@@ sed later with mes@@ o@@ the@@ li@@ om .
but even now ab@@ bot@@ t did not associ@@ ate this with his own case .
after all , his patient was a few decades older and had worked directly with as@@ be@@ sto@@ s .
the link in the case was clear .
in september 2011 , ab@@ bot@@ t ’ s state deterior@@ ated again , and his family doctor brought his c@@ t sc@@ ans and x-@@ ray rec@@ ord@@ ings to a group of experts .
in december 2011 , exactly two years after ab@@ bot@@ t felt ill for the first time , a new camera equipped with a camera was launched into the ca@@ ve between the ri@@ b and the bre@@ ast co@@ at .
i am an optim@@ ist .
i usually just continue , &quot; he says .
to be honest , i had not been so wor@@ ried .
but rac@@ hel , my wife , was concerned .
the result of the bi@@ op@@ sie was between christmas and new year : &quot; i was told that it was mes@@ o@@ the@@ li@@ om@@ a &quot; .
gra@@ ham ab@@ bot@@ t : diagno@@ sis mes@@ o@@ the@@ li@@ om@@ a
suddenly , ab@@ bot@@ t had appoin@@ t@@ ments with mac@@ mill@@ an nur@@ ses , one of whom recommended him to seek a law@@ yer .
only now did he understand the extent of the ep@@ ide@@ mic .
&quot; as@@ be@@ sto@@ s was found to be very widespread , especially in large public buildings where tu@@ bes are often insu@@ lated with as@@ be@@ sto@@ s , &quot; he says .
the people who are exposed to as@@ be@@ sto@@ s in these buildings are now suffering .
and thus mes@@ o@@ the@@ li@@ om is now hit@@ ting younger people who have not worked in typical profes@@ sions .
the most dangerous pi@@ pes with as@@ be@@ sto@@ s insul@@ ation in hospit@@ als were located below ground , so patients were probably not exposed to the substance .
but many people who work in pede@@ strian tun@@ nels from one building to another ( like andre@@ w law@@ son ) or underground car parks , have to eat and drink at the bar .
it is evident that , over several decades after the war , hospit@@ als may have been life@@ -@@ saving for patients , but they are life@@ -@@ threat@@ ening for the doctors who treat them .
it is still being removed today .
students put their bun@@ sen@@ bur@@ ners on as@@ be@@ sto@@ s mat@@ s .
it does not just concern hospit@@ als .
as@@ be@@ sto@@ s was developed for its fab@@ ulous insul@@ ating and fl@@ ame re@@ tar@@ d@@ ants in offices , shops , libraries and city h@@ alls .
schools , too , are involved .
indeed , many people may have found the first as@@ be@@ sto@@ s contact in the class@@ room .
throughout the country , in thousands of chem@@ ic@@ al-@@ class hours , students have tested their bun@@ sen@@ bur@@ ners on as@@ be@@ sto@@ s mat@@ s .
on websites , the topic of as@@ be@@ sto@@ s is now often addressed in schools .
meanwhile , inno@@ cent objects in our houses , such as flo@@ oring panels or d@@ and@@ y bags , have included as@@ be@@ sto@@ s by default .
&quot; it is an industrial po@@ ison that is present in large parts of our real estate , &quot; re@@ marked andre@@ w mor@@ gan , the law@@ yer , andre@@ w law@@ son in his trial against gu@@ y &apos;s hospital .
in one case , the only contact that fell to a woman affected was the demo@@ lition of a garden sh@@ ed in the 197@@ 0s .
so make sure you take your garden sc@@ ales off .
the effects of diagno@@ sis , and the knowledge that the disease is incur@@ able , are immen@@ se .
&quot; it takes a while to process this , &quot; says gra@@ ham ab@@ bot@@ t .
i went back to work and tried to continue , but i realized that i was not focusing on what i was doing .
i was in practice for two weeks .
then i knew that i would go and have to care for myself .
well , i will not see another christmas .
the greatest difficulty was the change of perspective from a doctor ’ s position to a patient ’ s position .
like countless patients before him , he re@@ members how overwhel@@ med he was by all the information with which he had to cope .
&quot; it was very difficult to take all this in , &quot; he says .
&quot; i asked my doctor &quot; how long do i have ? &quot;
and they gave me about 12 months .
i remember that i thought &quot; well , i will not be another christmas .
that was then . &apos;
mes@@ o@@ the@@ li@@ om@@ a is particularly insi@@ di@@ ous because it is our life@@ -@@ support mechanism - bre@@ a@@ thing itself - that causes the dead@@ ly cancer .
most cases of mes@@ o@@ the@@ li@@ om@@ a are caused by as@@ be@@ sto@@ s contact .
as@@ be@@ sto@@ s consists of small@@ est fi@@ b@@ res .
if the as@@ be@@ sto@@ s is wash@@ ed up and the fi@@ b@@ res are in@@ hal@@ ed , they can be spread in the ch@@ est co@@ at , the skin around the lun@@ gs .
as@@ be@@ sto@@ s fi@@ bers ir@@ rit@@ ate the ch@@ est and can tri@@ gger cell mu@@ tations .
&quot; the problem ar@@ ises with the in@@ hal@@ ed nee@@ d@@ le-@@ shaped as@@ be@@ sto@@ s fi@@ b@@ res , &quot; says professor tom treas@@ ure , a heart thor@@ a@@ x doctor who sent the gu@@ y &apos;s hospital in 2001 .
the hospital that andre@@ w law@@ son susp@@ ects is in charge of as@@ be@@ sto@@ s is now ir@@ onic .
treas@@ ure knew law@@ son and treated some others who probably also had to be in hospital during their training in the hospital .
once the as@@ be@@ sto@@ s nee@@ d@@ les reach the l@@ ung tissu@@ e , says treas@@ ure , &quot; they will be pus@@ hed to the edge of the resp@@ ir@@ atory process where the skin is .
it is in@@ he@@ ren@@ tly inv@@ a@@ sive from the very beginning .
the usual options for other can@@ c@@ ers in mes@@ o@@ the@@ li@@ om are not so good .
the effectiveness of an operation , for example , is highly controversial .
some say that it is worth trying .
treas@@ ure den@@ ies that .
&quot; you can &apos;t cut the ch@@ est co@@ at out , &quot; he says .
you don &apos;t get around with the k@@ ni@@ fe .
meanwhile , cancer is &quot; not very good at chem@@ other@@ ap@@ y , &quot; the &quot; effect &quot; is not heal@@ ing .
&quot; sometimes there are long-@@ time survi@@ v@@ ors , &quot; says treas@@ ure .
but in the end they all die .
fortunately , some patients actually live long , much longer than expected .
the author ste@@ ph@@ en j@@ ay g@@ ould died 20 years after diagno@@ sis .
two and a half years after his own diagno@@ sis , gra@@ ham ab@@ bot@@ t is still fighting .
after cont@@ acting mes@@ o@@ the@@ li@@ om , ab@@ bot@@ t came into contact with andre@@ w law@@ son , who was a one-@@ man of the same name four years after his diagno@@ sis .
&quot; hel@@ lo , cancer center , &quot; he was happy to answer calls .
&quot; he was very positive , &quot; says ab@@ bot@@ t .
he had received his diagno@@ sis 4 years earlier and was still very active .
originally , ab@@ bot@@ t was six chem@@ other@@ ap@@ y cy@@ cles that took four months and are likely to be around a month longer .
&quot; i was desper@@ ate , &quot; he says .
i wanted to give up .
however , law@@ son managed to &quot; do things in a more positive light . &quot;
after consulting several doctors , ab@@ bot@@ t decided to continue his treatment with prof@@ . lo@@ ic lan@@ g-@@ la@@ z@@ dun@@ ski , car@@ di@@ o-@@ thor@@ a@@ x specialist at gu@@ y &apos;s .
&quot; we had an advantage by not having to be re@@ directed , i just called and got a date , &quot; gives gra@@ ham to .
a normal patient would have to be re@@ mit@@ tan@@ ded and wait for the treatment to be approved .
money is crucial to mes@@ o@@ the@@ li@@ om suff@@ e@@ rers in order to per@@ cei@@ ve the best available therap@@ ies .
but , when these treatments inevitably fail , many people are left with another financial concern - over which the future of families is at stake .
and so you turn to the courts in the hope of compensation .
andre@@ w law@@ son cont@@ acted andre@@ w mor@@ gan of field fish@@ er water@@ house ll@@ p .
&quot; it has been known since 18@@ 98 that as@@ be@@ sto@@ s is extremely dangerous for health , &quot; says mor@@ gan .
but what changed in the 196@@ 0s was that it was recognized that a very small burden was a health risk , too .
and this is where the neglig@@ ence of companies began to play a role .
andre@@ w law@@ son and gu@@ y &apos;s hospital finally set their case , but it was not what mor@@ gan had called a &quot; ful@@ ly-@@ fle@@ d@@ ged compensation &quot; , as law@@ son was not with absolute certainty .
after the investigation into his death , a spo@@ kes@@ man of gu@@ y confirmed that &quot; the as@@ be@@ sto@@ s fi@@ b@@ res in the cel@@ lar area affected were removed in the 1990 &apos;s . &quot;
this was too late for andre@@ w law@@ son .
how to remove as@@ be@@ sto@@ s
indeed , it is not easy for mes@@ o@@ the@@ li@@ om suff@@ e@@ rers who seek compensation , a huge problem , the dead@@ ly as@@ be@@ sto@@ s contact of a company or a job - usually decades after the events .
many of their former employers have been sold or closed .
insurance documents may be lost .
and those who oppose claims know that time is for them to do so , but certainly not with the pla@@ in@@ ti@@ ffs .
in response , there have been clear new legislation this year , which could make it easier for people affected by mes@@ o@@ the@@ li@@ om to claim compensation , even though their former employers could no longer be found .
the law has approved a fund of eur 3@@ 50 million for all , supported by the insurance industry , for all diagno@@ sed after july 2012 , to be able to prove a contact , but cannot su@@ e anyone .
in these cases , the pla@@ in@@ ti@@ ffs receive 80 % of what a court would have agreed to them in a normal compensation process - about £ 1@@ 20@@ ,000 .
about 300 successful applications for the programme are expected per year .
andre@@ w mor@@ gan thin@@ ks like so many mes@@ o@@ the@@ li@@ om suff@@ e@@ rers that £ 3@@ 50 million is a &quot; very good job &quot; of the insurance industry .
&quot; this is a deal for insu@@ rers , &quot; he says , and suggests that it is a deal for insu@@ rers .
mi@@ ke pen@@ ning , then working and pension minister , ad@@ mitted that the law &quot; is not perfect &quot; .
but both pen@@ ning and mor@@ gan ad@@ mitted that , with seven deaths , a rapid response is needed every day .
&quot; people are suffering so much and need help today , &quot; said pen@@ ning during the second hearing of the mes@@ o@@ the@@ li@@ om law in december last year .
at that time , gra@@ ham ab@@ bot@@ t was in the hands of prof@@ . lo@@ ic lan@@ g-@@ la@@ z@@ dun@@ ski for 19 months .
after their first consul@@ tations lan@@ g-@@ la@@ z@@ dun@@ ski recommended an operation that , unlike tom treas@@ ury , would have a positive impact .
this was done by radiation therapy and chem@@ other@@ ap@@ y - a tri@@ ple therapy that was used to treat long-@@ la@@ z@@ dun@@ ski for survival over five years from up to 40 % .
ab@@ bot@@ t felt stronger .
&quot; this is of course with the most important , &quot; says ab@@ bot@@ t .
this is something that patients always see .
there is something that will allow you to continue .
if you give up , you will get worse very quickly .
gra@@ ham ab@@ bot@@ t under@@ went the operation in march 2012 .
at the end of august he had the last of the six chem@@ other@@ ap@@ y cy@@ cles behind him .
the after@@ -@@ care scan@@ ning showed no sign of the disease .
then in march 20@@ 14 i had a s@@ can .
there were several cancer spots around my bre@@ ast .
i have just been 50 .
that is not life@@ -@@ threat@@ ening .
that is life@@ -@@ ending .
ab@@ bot@@ t under@@ went six chem@@ other@@ ap@@ y cy@@ cles again .
now there is no tr@@ ace of t@@ um@@ ors visible .
but the process is very hard and physi@@ cally demanding .
they must think about practical things - about money , if i am no longer , for example , or my wife show how the bo@@ iler time setting works .
if you receive bad news , you will be negative .
they must look forward .
as el@@ lie &apos;s father , 16 , and tam@@ s@@ in , 14 , this is not always easy .
&quot; for parents , it is difficult , &quot; he says .
it is difficult to know what to say and how much .
when i was first diagno@@ sed , i told my girl that i had a disease that i would not be old .
they respon@@ ded in a very different way .
tam@@ s@@ in is very soci@@ able and un@@ st@@ in@@ ting .
she told her friends and we soon got a lot of calls .
el@@ lie was more cau@@ tious .
she did not say much .
such talks are something that all cancer patients must go through .
but for mes@@ o@@ the@@ li@@ o@@ se@@ -@@ rich diseases , such talks have not been ho@@ p@@ eless , not a tr@@ ace of hope of survival .
the disease ( as in the end ste@@ ph@@ en j@@ ay g@@ ould ) brings a gri@@ m security .
as andre@@ w mor@@ gan says , &quot; mes@@ o@@ the@@ li@@ om is not life@@ -@@ threat@@ ening .

china is den@@ ying hong kong the right to vote in government , demonstr@@ ators swe@@ ar re@@ tali@@ ation , and the country is re@@ tribu@@ ting .
on sunday , despite the increased calls for democratic reforms , the chinese parliament decided against nom@@ in@@ ating candidates for the 20@@ 17 elections by hong kong &apos;s elec@@ tor@@ ate .
this approach probably fi@@ ghts the long-@@ announced pro@@ tests in hong kong ’ s district , while activi@@ sts are making planning and mobil@@ isation in the space of a few hours after the announcement .
the decision of the chinese people ’ s congress allows the communist leaders to impose on all non-@@ pe@@ king@@ -@@ loy@@ al candidates in principle .
&quot; this is not un@@ expected , but it makes us an@@ gr@@ y , &quot; said legal expert em@@ ily la@@ u , chairman of the democratic party .
that is not what beijing had promised .
hong kong residents have been lied to .
and it is clear that we are dealing with an author@@ itarian regime .
in his defense of china ’ s decision , li fe@@ i , depu@@ ty secretary general of the standing committee of the national people ’ s congress , said that the approval of public nom@@ inations in the hong kong government ’ s elections would be cha@@ otic .
since 1997 , when britain took control of hong kong back to the chinese , beijing has promised to protect the residents from the government presidency from 20@@ 17 .
the chinese leadership presented sunday ’ s decision as a democratic break@@ through , because it offered hong kong ’ s citizens a direct right to vote , but the decision also demonstrates that china ’ s leaders are watching the process through a closely controlled beijing nom@@ ination .
moreover , a new clause only states that candidates should be &quot; with love for the country and love for hong kong &quot; .
the decision follows a summer in which some of the largest and most public@@ -@@ min@@ ded pro@@ tests in hong kong have taken place for a number of years .
behind the pro-@@ democracy campaign in hong kong is the occup@@ y central movement with love and peace , whose organiz@@ ers have threatened to do so .
on sunday evening , within hours of the announcement , hundreds of oc@@ cu@@ p@@ y centers were in the process of re-@@ opening the doors of the government headquarters in hong kong .
at the demonstration , the organiz@@ ers said that their movement had set up a new stage of civil dis@@ o@@ be@@ di@@ ence and that in the coming weeks they were planning waves of protest .
however , you did not give any further details , apparently to avoid problems with the authorities .
in an online communication , the organiz@@ ers announced that the movement &quot; the occupation of the central district only as a last resort , has taken action that can only take place if the entire dialogue process is fully explo@@ ited .
we are sorry to say that today all the opportunities for dialogue have been exhaus@@ ted and the occupation of the central district has definitely taken place .
the hong kong authorities have been waiting for days for the beijing announcement and it was on sunday that the government building was ti@@ ghten@@ ed up , including police forces and bar@@ ric@@ ades .
the un@@ rest is being exac@@ er@@ b@@ ated by the feeling of many in hong kong that they are slowly losing control of their city .
the influ@@ x of people from the main@@ land increases competition for products and services .
there is also a growing fear that hong kong ’ s values , such as democracy and freedom of speech , will cr@@ um@@ ble under the growing pressure from beijing .
some cri@@ tici@@ zed the demonstra@@ tions by the occup@@ y-@@ centr@@ al-@@ movement , because they were not able to control the business - the li@@ fel@@ ine of hong kong .
&quot; the pro@@ tests they speak of could cause great economic damage , depending on how many are involved and how long they last , &quot; said legal sex minister .
we do not want to fuel fears that hong kong will get out of control .
this impression is bad for investment .
china ’ s state@@ -@@ controlled media recently reported on the pro-@@ democracy activi@@ sts in hong kong as being held by western powers .
this summer , activi@@ sts organised an un@@ official referendum on electoral rights , which involved 7@@ 8@@ 0,000 people - more than a fifth of the elec@@ tor@@ ate in hong kong .
in july , tens of thousands took part in one of the greatest demonstra@@ tions of democracy in the history of the region .
the tradition of school leaving b@@ alls in the us is now being transferred to universities , where fres@@ h@@ men are offering private aircraft .
we are looking forward to being able to respond to this demand and to be able to offer the first luxury uk travel service for students of today .
to make a particularly impressive appearance at the university , the company also offers transportation options such as private aircraft , roll@@ s-@@ roy@@ ce ph@@ an@@ tom , ast@@ on mar@@ ten or m@@ cla@@ ren p@@ 1 .
mr ste@@ w@@ art also stated that the service has a security section .
this service is an ideal alternative for students who would otherwise like to spend their time in a danger@@ ously over@@ loaded car .
together with our new vi@@ f options , we look forward to ensuring this year that students will be able to study the university with a minimum of effort and a maximum of luxury .
a corporate spo@@ kes@@ man said that no new book@@ ings had yet been made , since the service was only just introduced , but added that &quot; students will be able to use the service in the next few weeks &quot; .
the company also announced that despite the study fees of £ 9@@ ,000 per year , there was a market for this offer .
students today differ very much in their expectations and expectations from students before 10 , 20 , 30 or 40 years ago - it is more important than ever to make a great first impression , and with vi@@ f you can do just that .
the national student union , however , critic@@ ised the service as being ab@@ ro@@ g@@ ated .
me@@ gan dun@@ n , vice president of n@@ us for higher education said : &quot; this offer seems completely separate from the lives of most students .
many students who begin their studies this month are facing a crisis in the cost of living , as the available financial assistance in the form of loans and schol@@ ar@@ ships is not linked to the so@@ aring invo@@ ices for the simpl@@ est basic life .
fem@@ ini@@ sts cri@@ tici@@ ze r@@ aci@@ al and police behavior in fer@@ g@@ us@@ on
the un@@ armed te@@ en@@ ager was killed by a police officer in fer@@ g@@ us@@ on , mon . earlier this month .
the participants lif@@ ted their hands in the air and san@@ g , &quot; hands up , did not sho@@ ot , &quot; while they wa@@ ited before the fun@@ eral .
after two weeks of pro@@ tests in fer@@ g@@ us@@ on , mo , because of the sho@@ oting of the un@@ armed te@@ en@@ ager michael brown , the blo@@ gger mi@@ ri@@ am zo@@ il@@ a pe@@ re@@ z noticed a change in online discussions .
in their experience , white fem@@ in@@ ist comm@@ ent@@ ators put the sex before the race to avoid re@@ productive rights and income inequality .
but , while ten@@ sions in the middle west have ris@@ en and been he@@ eded throughout the country , pe@@ re@@ z saw that the responses of white women were 100 % r@@ aci@@ al .
compared with the responses of black women shortly after the sho@@ ts of 9 august , personal es@@ says came with tit@@ les such as &quot; thoughts to fer@@ g@@ us@@ on by a white woman &quot; and &quot; fem@@ in@@ ism is not just about op@@ pression .
but for pe@@ re@@ z , this meant an important change .
&quot; i do not think that fem@@ in@@ ism can find many people who are above the knowledge and have privile@@ ges in such a high-@@ class way , &quot; she said .
people felt pus@@ hed to add to what happened .
it is characteristic of the crisis we are in and because the situation in fer@@ g@@ us@@ on is so eth@@ n@@ ically based that you have to say so .
for professor k@@ ori@@ th@@ a mit@@ ch@@ ell of the o@@ hi@@ o state university , fer@@ g@@ us@@ on brought to light problems that black americans have been exposed to every day , but which are not known as women &apos;s issues .
&quot; i can find something fun@@ ny on fac@@ e@@ book about me and my partner and get 150 li@@ kes from anywhere , &quot; said mit@@ ch@@ ell .
if i post something about how col@@ oured people in their own country are under sie@@ ge , the silence is ear@@ -@@ stun@@ ned .
&quot; how can it be safe for women to talk publicly about a relationship , but not about security in public space ? &quot; she asked .
for black women like mit@@ ch@@ ell , the race , sex and sex@@ u@@ ality in the history of the us , there is no dic@@ ho@@ tom@@ y between r@@ aci@@ al and gender problems .
for them , black women have not had the luxury of cle@@ aring the issues clean ; they live in the combined reality every day .
while white women are now discussing the issues of race and gender in the fem@@ in@@ ist main@@ stream , ang@@ ela h@@ att@@ ery , professor of women and gender , says that women are not only women but also men .
&quot; between 18@@ 65 and 18@@ 90 , at least 10@@ ,000 black men were yellow and the justi@@ fication was almost always the ra@@ pe of a white woman , &quot; said h@@ at@@ tery .
white women had to be involved in history in order to justify ly@@ n@@ ch@@ murder .
for h@@ att@@ ery , the division between white and black women came at the point where white figh@@ ters for women ’ s electoral law , such as sus@@ an b@@ . an@@ th@@ ony , were able to analy@@ ze the country in the late n@@ ine@@ teenth century , and not so .
&quot; they made the decision to stand up for women &apos;s voting rights , and the right to vote for bl@@ acks should come later , &quot; said h@@ at@@ tery .
if you remember such things , you are fully aware of why colour@@ ful women do not trust white women .
we did not do our job well .
we have never helped black women to be their hus@@ bands and s@@ ons .
even after women were given the right to vote in 19@@ 20 , it took a decade for white women to fight ly@@ n@@ ch in the association of southern india .
the group was established almost 40 years after the original request for help from black women , says mit@@ ch@@ ell .
for mit@@ ch@@ ell , the flo@@ od of white fem@@ in@@ ist re@@ actions to the issues raised by fer@@ g@@ us@@ on - police behaviour , r@@ aci@@ al discrimination - is a mirror of the time when white fem@@ ini@@ sts were caught &apos; .
&quot; would it not be great if the activi@@ sts who have such traditional fem@@ in@@ ist platforms had the right to education of a child so seriously ?
secon@@ d-@@ generation fem@@ ini@@ sts who have ste@@ pped up their care@@ ers in the struggle for re@@ productive rights and access to contrac@@ ep@@ tive aids are now trying to understand what that means .
the well-known white fem@@ in@@ ist acti@@ vis@@ t gl@@ oria ste@@ in@@ en went to the united states two weeks after michael brown shot and published a new po@@ cket for the german re@@ be@@ c .
&quot; i hope that women who have a different but parallel reason to follow a physical path in@@ he@@ rent in the body - and have opinions on race , which is in public po@@ lls much different - will understand the changes .
although stones are more of an inter@@ sec@@ tional fem@@ in@@ ism in which race as well as gender issues are addressed , some of your comments on r@@ aci@@ al issues are in america .
christ@@ ina som@@ mer , resear@@ cher at the american enterprise institute and author of &quot; who st@@ ale fem@@ in@@ ism ? &quot; said to her the people of the united states that young men are in the united states , especially young far@@ b@@ ies .
there are now hundreds of special programmes for girls and young women , but almost nothing for bo@@ ys .
but when the white house recently launched a small program , my brother &apos;s ke@@ eper , to prevent vulnerable young black and h@@ is@@ pan@@ ic men , there were an@@ no@@ ying re@@ actions from many fem@@ ini@@ sts who included him .
the police relations with the black community are not the only problem that has become the main theme of main@@ stream fem@@ in@@ ism .
after the us border police have killed nearly 6@@ 3@@ ,000 un@@ accompanied min@@ ors on the country &apos;s south-@@ west border this year , the issue of immigration reform is also coming back to the surface - this time as a women &apos;s issue .
andre@@ a mer@@ c@@ ado , co-@@ chairman of we bel@@ ong together , an organisation that supports women in the immigration reform , said that for a new approach to the issue of immigration as an essential female element , it is only a women &apos;s issue .
&quot; they speak for themselves , &quot; said mer@@ c@@ ado .
if the vast majority of working vis@@ as go to male immigrants , women who have accompanied them are in a position to be able to work for domestic residents .
&quot; these stories are a lasting feature of women &apos;s organisations , &quot; she said .
&quot; sch@@ we@@ in@@ e-@@ haus &quot; in ip@@ sw@@ ich is available for sale in the uk .
the image of a house for sale was removed by real estate agents when it became clear that it showed a big por@@ k that it made comfortable in the living room .
the de@@ t@@ ached house has one bedroom , located on a private road in ip@@ sw@@ ich and is offered for 1@@ 20@@ ,000 £ .
the details included a picture of the living room of the house - including a pi@@ g that had his head on a sof@@ a bed .
real estate bro@@ ker conn@@ ell@@ s said the pi@@ g in the photo was the pet of the owner .
&quot; the photo was mis@@ published and has since been removed &quot; said a spo@@ kes@@ woman of the company .
in the exposure of the house , con@@ n@@ ell@@ s described the former assembly house as a &quot; unique one-@@ family house with one bedroom . &quot;
although the bro@@ ker removed the image from the website , it still appears on advertising material .
the sale of the house was of interest in the social media when some asked whether the pi@@ g was included in the purchase price .
the s@@ w city of har@@ ve@@ y is home to a new mil@@ li@@ on@@ air@@ e after lo@@ t@@ tery win , a mil@@ li@@ on@@ air@@ e in the wake of a new mil@@ li@@ on@@ air@@ e .
a lo@@ t@@ tery player from har@@ ve@@ y is scheduled to play this month .
the search for a new mil@@ li@@ on@@ air@@ e in the sou@@ th@@ west of per@@ th continues , with a happy winner who has emerged from the lo@@ t@@ tery draw on saturday almost $ 1.@@ 1 million .
a newspaper ki@@ os@@ k in har@@ ve@@ y moved the j@@ ack pot for the second time in five years in the draw of the first division , after $ 1 million in november 2009 .
the lu@@ cky winner must , however , be informed .
the store owner ste@@ ve forward said that the profit care for talking in the small town in the sou@@ th@@ west of per@@ th .
the city is talking about nothing else , and all are quite ex@@ ci@@ ted .
we thought that such a gain could occur .
eight wa winners have made win@@ s in the first division last month , a due conclusion for a few happy weeks for the players in the state .
last week , a player from can@@ ning val@@ e was shot in one of the five mil@@ li@@ on@@ ai@@ res in august , after a couple from bel@@ mon@@ t had just weeks earlier achieved the me@@ ga win of 7.@@ 5 million $ .
the winning couple had been playing for twenty years and said that the profit allows them to travel the world and buy a new home .
the mil@@ li@@ on@@ air@@ e from har@@ ve@@ y is the 5@@ 9@@ th winner of the first division in the wa this year , with a total of almost $ 85 million .
leon@@ id@@ as asked for a visit to the gla@@ di@@ ator arena in the city of gl@@ ad@@ es@@ h .
not only the gla@@ di@@ ators were an@@ k@@ le deep in the mat@@ sch at the first r@@ hin@@ eland roman day in the am@@ us@@ ement park .
but the attr@@ action of the event was strong enough to attract more than 1000 visitors yesterday who were able to see the sho@@ wers and the autumn cold .
there was a color@@ ful series of representa@@ tions , performances , games , exhibitions and information about the time of the roman@@ s and their importance for the r@@ hin@@ eland .
the main attr@@ action of the day was undoubtedly the mar@@ tial figh@@ ter force of the gla@@ di@@ ator school &quot; am@@ or mor@@ tis &quot; , which was responsible for every ra@@ iny break to be found in the soft sand with soft sand .
gla@@ di@@ ator owners &quot; leon@@ id@@ as &quot; proved hum@@ or@@ ous and kno@@ wled@@ ge@@ able pres@@ enter and sent des@@ c@@ end@@ ants in the ring to the her@@ o@@ ic two-@@ fight in various gla@@ di@@ ators .
first , the &quot; pro@@ voca@@ tors &quot; were in turn equipped with a rec@@ tan@@ g@@ le shi@@ eld and short s@@ word as well as le@@ g rail on the left le@@ g and arm rail on the right arm .
the &quot; es@@ se@@ d@@ ari@@ i &quot; followed with a bre@@ ast shi@@ eld , short s@@ word and lit@@ ter l@@ ance as well as an iron gla@@ di@@ ator hel@@ met , le@@ g and arm@@ guard .
the appearance of the &quot; reti@@ ari@@ us &quot; , which was connected with the thro@@ wing net , the tri@@ angle and the d@@ ag@@ ger against the &quot; sec@@ ut@@ or &quot; and after a short fight the bo@@ ys came to the floor .
the s@@ words cl@@ am@@ med me@@ tal@@ lic , the shi@@ el@@ ds she@@ ph@@ er@@ d and the cu@@ t@@ l@@ ans fle@@ w through the arena sur@@ ren@@ dering to a fear and fear that could be around the health of the dig@@ la@@ e .
but to which the imposing &quot; sum@@ ma ru@@ d@@ is &quot; , the mus@@ cu@@ lar re@@ fe@@ ree , had always had a careful eye .
&quot; we wanted to revi@@ ve the everyday life of rome and to experience the culture of the roman era , &quot; explained lo@@ ren@@ z e@@ us@@ kir@@ chen , chairman of the &quot; fre@@ un@@ desk@@ re@@ is r@@ ö@@ mer@@ kan@@ al &quot; organiz@@ er , who .
after two years of preparation , the park became a &quot; op@@ pi@@ dum roman@@ um &quot; for one day , a roman city , as vice may@@ or cla@@ us we@@ h@@ age in his gre@@ e@@ ting word .
after all , the roman@@ s have not only brought war and con@@ quest in our region , but also the roman culture and numerous buildings that we still adm@@ ire today .
the remains of this were also to be ad@@ mi@@ red at the roman day , such as &quot; aqu@@ educ@@ t mar@@ ble &quot; from the ele@@ ven meters high and 14@@ 00 meters long roman canal bridge that was once built at lu@@ e@@ f@@ tel@@ berg .
the fron@@ tin@@ us society once provided water and energy supplies , and now , and managing director pe@@ tra fr@@ ic@@ ke knew : &quot; we are still benef@@ iting from the knowledge of then &quot; .
this is confirmed by r@@ alp@@ h he@@ ili@@ ger ’ s diplom@@ a surve@@ ying engine@@ er from the “ engineering team z@@ we@@ i ” from rhe@@ in@@ bach , the measuring instruments of the roman@@ s such as ch@@ or@@ ob@@ at , gro@@ ma or di@@ op@@ tra .
the villa of the roman@@ s in blan@@ ken@@ heim presented s@@ ket@@ ches and models of the exc@@ av@@ ations an@@ no 18@@ 94 and br@@ ic@@ ks from the original hypo@@ cau@@ ste , the hot air he@@ at@@ ers , which were once the roman@@ s .
impressive also the foot@@ prin@@ ts of wol@@ f and fu@@ ch@@ s two mill@@ en@@ nia ago in the foot@@ steps of sound .
in 2011 , the national association of the r@@ hin@@ eland region had commission@@ ed the office for soil preser@@ vation to preserve the remains of a roman villa in the north industrial park in rhe@@ in@@ bach .
they have built walls of an economic building with a dar@@ r to dry gra@@ in and m@@ ill .
the building probably led to a villa rus@@ tic@@ a , an agricultural estate , explained the archae@@ o@@ log@@ ist dr. j@@ enni@@ fer mor@@ sch@@ is@@ er .
a number of finds from these exc@@ av@@ ations were found in a glass glass glass glass glass glass glass glass glass glass glass glass glass tan@@ k , several fine glass vessels and parts of a small nec@@ kl@@ ace .
the villa was built in the 18th century and was built in the early 18th century .
it also involved the children with the roman wind@@ m@@ ill game , similar to the current m@@ ill game , or they wrote as the roman pu@@ pil@@ s used to use metal gri@@ ps on wa@@ x panels .
at the r@@ ö@@ mer@@ ther@@ men z@@ ü@@ l@@ p@@ ich the children were allowed to lay mo@@ sa@@ ics themselves , at the stand of the glass museum rhe@@ in@@ bach glass mo@@ sa@@ ics and to stand at the ei@@ fe@@ l we@@ it@@ ter@@ sh@@ ei@@ fe@@ l nature centre .
with the co@@ ated original wine drawn by two col@@ d-@@ blo@@ s@@ so@@ m fa@@ i@@ th@@ fully re@@ constructed roman tro@@ l@@ le@@ ys , visitors were able to visit the park and also the impressive stand of the municip@@ al gy@@ m@@ na@@ si@@ um &quot; , which was here .
with a week of rome from 13@@ th to 21st september , the w@@ ach@@ t@@ berg municip@@ ality will also be part of the r@@ ö@@ mer@@ ja@@ hr 20@@ 14 , which is remin@@ is@@ cent of the death of emper@@ or au@@ gu@@ st@@ us 2000 years ago .
together with the local and historical associations and the w@@ ach@@ t@@ ber@@ ger wan@@ der@@ -@@ vere@@ in , the partnership association and the am@@ us@@ ement park of ob@@ er@@ bach , among other things , them@@ atic hi@@ kes , a lec@@ ture , lec@@ tures and conferences are offered .
for example , a roman legi@@ on@@ na@@ ire is excluded from his work on the w@@ ach@@ t@@ berg , but plants are seen as living monuments from the roman era and a fun@@ ny lesson in the subject of international understanding .
the ad@@ endor@@ f primary school is dedicated to the roman@@ s theme during a project week .
the roman@@ s week is intended to bring the many , but often no longer visible , trac@@ es of the roman@@ s in w@@ ach@@ t@@ berg back to life .
the w@@ ach@@ t@@ ber@@ ger city hall will present a small presentation to the fund of the ber@@ k@@ um@@ er mat@@ ron@@ en@@ he@@ il@@ ty in 18@@ 7@@ 9 .
e@@ bol@@ a : the ep@@ ide@@ mic is bur@@ d@@ ening west africa ’ s economy
the e@@ bol@@ a ep@@ ide@@ mic in west africa is also a severe b@@ low to the economy .
markets are or@@ ph@@ an@@ ed - and international companies are di@@ stan@@ cing themselves .
the dev@@ ast@@ ating e@@ bol@@ a ep@@ ide@@ mic is giving west africa &apos;s economy a heavy b@@ low .
the har@@ v@@ est is ro@@ ta@@ ted in fields , mines have been abandoned and markets are or@@ ph@@ an@@ ed - the virus has been a major source of inf@@ ection in the region .
some international companies are also already di@@ stan@@ cing themselves .
&quot; the e@@ bol@@ a ep@@ ide@@ mic is not only a medical crisis , but also an economic one , &quot; the african development bank chief don@@ ald k@@ ab@@ er@@ u@@ ka jud@@ ges .
liber@@ ia is hard@@ est hit
&quot; it is a total disaster , we lose a lot of money , &quot; says al@@ ha@@ ji b@@ am@@ o@@ go , who is on the second largest market in liber@@ ia &apos;s capital , mon@@ ro@@ via .
only those who have food or something to dis@@ inf@@ ect e@@ bol@@ a will come onto the market .
liber@@ ia is the hard@@ est hit by the virus , alone here fell the fe@@ ver more than 600 people .
recently , health authorities said that the disease had spread to every corner of the country .
in gu@@ ine@@ a , sier@@ ra le@@ one and ni@@ geria , too , the virus has spread .
in total , more than 15@@ 00 people have died , thousands more have cont@@ acted .
foreign firms are re@@ loc@@ ating workers
throughout res@@ our@@ ce-@@ rich countries , firms are running .
foreign companies like the ar@@ cel@@ or mit@@ tal steel group are with@@ drawing their employees , several international airlines are no longer flying to the affected regions .
local trad@@ ers and farmers are also re@@ acting : few merchan@@ ts are leaving their homes to buy supplies .
in some areas of sier@@ ra le@@ one and liber@@ ia , which are quar@@ ant@@ ine , ro@@ ts , among other things , the co@@ co@@ a and coffee industries that are important for export , on the fields .
farmers d@@ are not buy their homes for the har@@ v@@ est .
food is scar@@ ce
&quot; people are going to travel less and less , &quot; says phil@@ li@@ pe de v@@ re@@ yer , an expert in the economy of west africa .
for example , the man who normally goes to the market and sel@@ ls his vegetables is better off at home .
the population is therefore directly and urgently receiving the consequences of the ep@@ ide@@ mic : food is becoming scar@@ ce .
in the markets , the supply of basic food@@ stuffs such as rice is dis@@ appe@@ aring .
at the same time , the region that is highly dependent on international companies is threat@@ ening to damage its image , with far-@@ reaching consequences .
the greatest danger is that international companies will generally avoid the area for a long time , says phili@@ ppe hu@@ g@@ on of french think tan@@ k ir@@ is .
the decisive factor is how far and how long the virus will spread .
investors may have the impression that it is dangerous to invest in gu@@ ine@@ a , sier@@ ra le@@ one and liber@@ ia and thus invest in it , ” comm@@ ented hu@@ g@@ on .
the disease also bur@@ dens the stra@@ ined national budgets of the states .
the disease also bur@@ dens the already har@@ d-@@ pressed national budgets of the states concerned .
the credit rating agency mo@@ o@@ dy &apos;s fears that its budgets will be heavily affected by the high expenditure on the health system and , in addition , by the wor@@ sen@@ ing economy .
the african development bank has already promised to provide 60 million dollars ( $ 45 million ) to the health systems of the countries concerned .
the effects are already notic@@ eable in ni@@ geria , where so far only a few e@@ bol@@ a cases have been diagno@@ sed .
while the o@@ il@@ -@@ rich region in the southern ni@@ ger del@@ ta has not been affected .
but elsewhere , many people are already left behind for fear of cont@@ ag@@ ion .
reservations in hotels are also decreas@@ ing significantly .
protect your 50@@ th anniversary celebr@@ ation
the &quot; t@@ ann@@ en@@ wal@@ d &quot; am@@ ber association celebra@@ tes its 5@@ 0-@@ year anniversary of its founding from 12 to 14 september .
the most beautiful and exciting tours are organised by the sch@@ ü@@ tz@@ en@@ vere@@ in t@@ ann@@ en@@ wal@@ d , which is celebr@@ ating its 50@@ th anniversary from 12@@ th to 14@@ th september .
the plan is to be on friday , september 12@@ th , a great evening with the group &quot; dor@@ fro@@ ck@@ er &quot; .
on saturday at 6 p.m. the big b@@ ö@@ ll@@ er@@ sch@@ ot@@ t .
the large t@@ ent is followed by the evening of the mo@@ od with the &quot; sto@@ ap@@ fal@@ zer sp@@ it@@ z@@ bu@@ am &quot; .
the br@@ ass band provides music for the music .
highlights on sunday are the fe@@ ast service and 9.@@ 30 am in the par@@ ish church and the large for@@ tress at 2.@@ 00 pm .
in the afternoon the price distribution of the sho@@ oting of the federal and ga@@ ul@@ le is also .
a particularly beautiful sight will be the 25 fe@@ ast ladies with their dir@@ n@@ d@@ l@@ n .
the cha@@ pel is the bern@@ ga@@ u bl@@ as@@ cap@@ elle .
the pat@@ ron@@ age of the town was given by may@@ or wol@@ f@@ gan@@ g wild and secretary of state al@@ bert fü@@ r@@ ack@@ er .
the original name &quot; sch@@ ü@@ tz@@ en@@ ges@@ ell@@ schaft t@@ ann@@ en@@ wal@@ d bern@@ ga@@ u &quot; dates from 19@@ 07 , when the association for &quot; social entertainment by means of exercise in room nur@@ sing and small cali@@ bre sho@@ oting &quot; was founded on 21 march .
the na@@ zi regime had led the dis@@ solution of the association in 19@@ 37 .
only in 196@@ 4 did 19 young men find themselves in the gu@@ es@@ thouse lu@@ k@@ as on 30 april , who were invited to the &quot; new &quot; sch@@ ü@@ tz@@ en@@ vere@@ in &quot; p@@ ann@@ en@@ wal@@ d &quot; bern@@ ga@@ u .
kar@@ l mar@@ z and ad@@ ol@@ f ried led the association as champi@@ on of the sport through a difficult early period , mainly in order to form a club venue and to promote the sho@@ oting operation .
the sch@@ ü@@ tz@@ en@@ vere@@ in in gas@@ th@@ aus &quot; le@@ in@@ inger &quot; started its first race in the la@@ p competi@@ tions in autumn 196@@ 5 .
in the following years , sports sho@@ ot@@ ers , who are now organized into seven teams , established themselves in all classes up to the 1st gau@@ lig@@ a .
the club records are recorded ann@@ ually and the magic border of 3@@ 80 r@@ ings was first established in 1980 by ru@@ di me@@ i@@ er .
as the performance of the active sho@@ ot@@ ers has increased , the membership numbers have also developed posi@@ tively .
after the club &quot; le@@ in@@ inger &quot; no longer meets the requirements of a modern sho@@ ot@@ ers association , the da@@ x group has become a member of the executive board under the leadership of jo@@ han@@ n r@@ inn .
after a work@@ load of 27@@ 00 hours , p@@ far@@ r@@ er stra@@ ß@@ er , the 8@@ th of may 198@@ 8 , awarded the church bl@@ essing for the new protec@@ tive rooms .
one of the great highlights in the club history was certainly the 4@@ 4th ga@@ ul@@ le , connected with the sole@@ m@@ n con@@ sec@@ r@@ ation of the new flag of sho@@ oting in july 1991 .
on 23 and 24 april 1994 the sch@@ ü@@ tz@@ en@@ vere@@ in celebrated its 30@@ th anniversary .
in 1995 , a b@@ ö@@ ll@@ er@@ group was founded .
jo@@ se@@ f sch@@ mal@@ z@@ l became b@@ ö@@ ll@@ er@@ re@@ ch@@ ner .
a great challenge for the &quot; b@@ ö@@ ll@@ er-@@ &quot; and for the association as a whole was the orientation of the bav@@ arian b@@ ö@@ ll@@ er@@ tre@@ ff@@ en 2005 .
in many hours of volunte@@ ering work , the club members have visited the premises and the sho@@ oting facility at the bern@@ gau@@ er hof and have thus updated the technology .
ele@@ ven teams in round competi@@ tions
the sports performance of the sch@@ ü@@ tz@@ en@@ vere@@ in can also be seen .
a total of ele@@ ven teams are currently participating in the round competi@@ tions : six air ri@@ f@@ le teams , a team of air gun@@ s , a sports gun k@@ 1 , a youth team and two ah teams .
the first team with lars ell@@ rich , k@@ ath@@ ar@@ ina ell@@ rich , ste@@ ff@@ i gra@@ d and ker@@ sti@@ n k@@ ell@@ er@@ mann was awarded the gau@@ ob@@ er@@ lig@@ a ( highest league in the sch@@ ü@@ tz@@ eng@@ au ) round 2013 / 14 .
the second team with ve@@ ren@@ a mo@@ os@@ bur@@ ger alex@@ and@@ ra me@@ i@@ er , eva sch@@ u@@ h@@ mann and to@@ bi@@ as gram@@ l has moved from gau@@ lig@@ a nor@@ d to gau@@ ob@@ er@@ lig@@ a .
besides the sho@@ oting sport , events such as bo@@ ck@@ ste@@ aks , car@@ ni@@ val and royal ball , club ou@@ ting and christmas celebra@@ tions have a tradition .
the sho@@ ot@@ ers are also present at the festi@@ vals in par@@ ish and community .
ton@@ y ste@@ w@@ art is suffering an accident when he returns to the race track .
ton@@ y ste@@ war@@ t ’ s return to the race track ended about half way through his race on the atlan@@ ta motor spe@@ ed@@ way .
ste@@ w@@ art was again driving against the wall for the second time after his right-@@ wing front ty@@ re bur@@ st in round 17@@ 2 and ended his evening .
ste@@ w@@ art dro@@ ve his damaged car into the garage and left it without talking to journalists .
his team leader ch@@ ad jo@@ hn@@ ston said that his 1@@ 4-@@ person team was disappointed , that he was focusing on the race on the coming weekend in rich@@ mon@@ d , vir@@ g@@ ini@@ a .
&quot; i wish we had a better effort and a better result for him , &quot; jo@@ hn@@ ston said .
we are going to rich@@ mon@@ d and hope that we can do better there .
ste@@ w@@ art already dro@@ ve earlier in the race on sunday evening after a col@@ li@@ sion with ky@@ le bus@@ ch into a wall and had to have his car repa@@ ired the right side .
&quot; i am quite hope@@ ful today that we will have a good result , &quot; jo@@ hn@@ ston said , and added : &quot; it just didn &apos;t work . &quot;
not long after the second accident , ste@@ wards &apos;s car was loaded into the tra@@ iler and the team had packed and was ready to leave .
ste@@ w@@ art left three nas@@ car spr@@ int cup rac@@ es after his car had won another driver in a race on the ash in the north of the state of new york and killed him .
he decided to return this week and go to atlan@@ ta or the next race in rich@@ mon@@ d to win a place in the persecu@@ tion .
he returned to his job , while an investigation into the tragic incident leading to the death of 20@@ -@@ year-@@ old k@@ ev@@ in ward j@@ r. was investig@@ ated , and was on the road during a race to support ste@@ w@@ art .
the authorities announced on friday that the investigations into the cause of the accident would last at least two weeks .
no decision has yet been taken as to whether ste@@ w@@ art should be expected to face charges .
the three-@@ time champi@@ on was gre@@ e@@ ted with great applause when he was presented before the race .
after starting in 12@@ th position , ste@@ w@@ art was already in the first 10 and was tempor@@ arily in fourth place .
after a re@@ start in round 12@@ 2 , bus@@ ch ’ s team got down to the top of the gri@@ d after a re@@ start in round 12@@ 2 , and bus@@ ch ’ s got down to the top of the gri@@ d .
car with no . 18 out of control after the exit from cur@@ ve 2 and cl@@ ash@@ ed with ste@@ w@@ art , both cars were running against the wall .
ste@@ w@@ art continued , but fell to place 21 .
the young dance enthusi@@ asts sought out the tal@@ ented young tal@@ ents .
just try out la@@ ura , len@@ a , lis@@ a , mari@@ e , bet@@ t@@ ina , em@@ ma and leader lis@@ a ne@@ it@@ z@@ el ( from left ) look forward to meeting with you .

ukra@@ inian army has given up lu@@ han@@ sk airport
in eastern ukraine , the pr@@ or@@ us@@ sian figh@@ ters are still on the march .

the army also announced that in the last 24 hours seven soldiers had been killed .
ukra@@ inian president pe@@ tr@@ o por@@ o@@ sh@@ en@@ ko had already drawn human conclusions from his army ’ s severe defe@@ at in the fight against the separ@@ ati@@ sts and announced changes in the supreme army ’ s leadership , without men@@ tioning details .
pr@@ or@@ us@@ sian separ@@ ati@@ sts shot aircraft from the united states , and the united states , from the united states , shot at the air .
in the fight against ukra@@ inian government troops , pr@@ or@@ us@@ sian separ@@ ati@@ sts , according to their own accounts , have once again produced a figh@@ ter aircraft and two military helicop@@ ters .
some 100 soldiers were also killed in batt@@ les in the don@@ et@@ sk region , divided the insur@@ g@@ ents in the russian agencies on monday .

nato does not want to enter into agreements with russia
nato is being strengthened by the planned dep@@ loy@@ ment in eastern europe as a result of the ukraine crisis .
nato secretary general and@@ ers fo@@ gh r@@ as@@ mus@@ sen said on monday in brussels that nato is following the founding agreement of the nato russia council in 1997 .
nato ’ s chief , however , accused russia of “ a sharp break ” of the agreement .
&quot; today we have to face reality that russia does not regard nato as a partner , &quot; says r@@ as@@ mus@@ sen .
the russian documents and opinions show that &quot; you are not against us &quot; .
stronger nato presence
r@@ as@@ mus@@ sen has also announced that it will strengthen nato &apos;s presence in eastern europe .
a compromise reached at the nato summit in wal@@ es is a good idea .
ki@@ e@@ v and moscow agree on new gas talks
russia and ukraine have officially agreed to new talks to set@@ tle their gas dispute .
the negotiations were scheduled for next saturday , as russian energy minister alexander no@@ wa@@ k said on monday .
it is still awa@@ iting a decision by the european union whether it will also send a representative to the talks .
the dispute over gas prices has been a matter of weeks since ukraine was not getting any fuel from russia .
the last time eu energy commissioner g@@ ün@@ ther o@@ et@@ t@@ inger had medi@@ ated between both sides .
ukraine had war@@ ned that russia could also cut off gas supplies for europe .
europe is ex@@ porting about one third of its natural gas from russian sources , a large proportion of which is flow@@ ing through ukraine .
mer@@ kel spe@@ aks the word of power : tol@@ l will come &quot; very clearly &quot;
now the chancell@@ or is clearly declar@@ ing her@@ self to be in favour of this .
a car@@ te blan@@ che for all the complicated details is not .
persi@@ stent concerns from the c@@ du about car tol@@ ls have pus@@ hed the c@@ su to the fore .
chancell@@ or ang@@ ela mer@@ kel has , following ongoing resistance from her c@@ du , given a powerful word for the introduction of a car tol@@ l .
&quot; to be quite clear , it is in the coalition treaty and it will come , &quot; said the party leader on monday after the c@@ du@@ -@@ top meetings of the berlin c@@ du .
mer@@ kel , however , did not agree on a detailed model for the time being .
in the black and red government programme , &apos; certain parameters &apos; are mentioned .
federal transport minister alexander do@@ br@@ in@@ dt ( c@@ su ) made a proposal and we are now working on it .
the n@@ r@@ w-@@ c@@ du , however , insi@@ sts on its &apos; no &apos; to a tol@@ l on all roads .
mer@@ kel stressed that finance minister wol@@ f@@ gan@@ g sch@@ ä@@ u@@ ble ( c@@ du ) is also construc@@ tively involved in the deliber@@ ations on a bill .
in addition to the subject , he has also talked about other ways of making more private capital available for investment in infrastructure , such as broad@@ band .
&quot; there is nothing special about it &quot; sch@@ ä@@ u@@ ble had a &quot; mirror &quot; report un@@ comm@@ ented on sunday , his house is exam@@ ining a concept to build motorway investors with tol@@ l revenues .
c@@ su@@ -@@ ch@@ ef hor@@ st see@@ ho@@ fer war@@ ned that he would not use tol@@ l concepts in the cab@@ in@@ et against the lead minister .
c@@ du bun@@ des@@ vi@@ ze arm@@ in las@@ ch@@ et re@@ affir@@ med his objec@@ tions .
&quot; the coalition agreement never assumed that all district and federal roads would be tol@@ led , &quot; said the north r@@ hin@@ e-@@ west@@ ph@@ ali@@ an c@@ du head of state .
in this respect , it is an important signal that see@@ ho@@ fer has now announced that it will be discussing the issue again .
resistance to the plans is also expressed by the c@@ du provin@@ cial feder@@ ations bad@@ en-@@ w@@ ür@@ t@@ tem@@ berg and rhe@@ in@@ land@@ -@@ pal@@ at@@ in@@ ate .
the background is fears that tol@@ ls will make it difficult for small border traffic to be cros@@ sed with neighbouring countries .
due to the tol@@ l criticism from ran@@ ks of the c@@ du coalition , see@@ ho@@ fer had demanded adhe@@ rence to coalition .
the left sees the plans as a failed state in the face of the dispute in the union .
&quot; the mur@@ ks tol@@ l is dead , &quot; said party leader ber@@ nd ri@@ e@@ x@@ inger of the &quot; new os@@ n@@ ab@@ r@@ ü@@ ck@@ er ze@@ it@@ ung &quot; ( monday ) .
&quot; the tol@@ l is the minister &apos;s failure , &quot; do@@ br@@ in@@ dt wants to introduce a vig@@ net@@ te duty on all german roads , which is to start in 20@@ 16 .
domestic car owners may , however , not be charged any additional according to the coalition agreement .
therefore , they should be able to obtain a full compensation for tol@@ ls through the vehicle tax .
the model must not , however , discrimin@@ ate against foreign drivers on the basis of eu law because of their nation@@ ality .
genetic dis@@ order is often mis@@ diagno@@ sed
a british person says that she thought that as a result of a mis@@ diagno@@ sis over many years she would die .
kar@@ in ro@@ d@@ gers lived almost all of their youth in the belief that they had only a few years to live after being diagno@@ sed with another disease .
she actually suffered from the char@@ co@@ -@@ mari@@ e-@@ to@@ oth disease ( c@@ mt ) - a group of in@@ h@@ eri@@ ted dis@@ orders that caused ner@@ ves outside the brain and sp@@ inal cor@@ d .
char@@ ity c@@ mt uk announced that mis@@ diagno@@ sis is a common problem for people with c@@ mt because so little about this disease .
some 23@@ ,000 people in britain are likely to suffer from c@@ mt , which may lead to motor dis@@ orders such as mus@@ cle weak@@ ness , in@@ secure gear and cur@@ ved to@@ es .
suff@@ e@@ rers also suffer from tau@@ b@@ he@@ it@@ s@@ ge@@ stal@@ tun@@ g or pain , the disease is incur@@ able and progressive , which means that the symp@@ t@@ oms become worse over time .
when ro@@ d@@ gers was 13 , she believed that she was interested in a peaceful at@@ a@@ xi@@ e ( fa ) - a disease with very poor survival chan@@ ces .
ro@@ d@@ gers thought she would be sitting in the whe@@ el@@ chair before she was 18 , and before her 30@@ th birth@@ day .
the mother of two children , who is 51 years old today , said : &apos; as a child i knew i could not do the same as the others .
i was constantly falling down and everything took longer .
i could never ride with the other children roll@@ er sk@@ ate@@ board or sk@@ ate@@ board and was often in school because of my kind to go and run .
ro@@ d@@ gers said that at the age of 13 , after several operations to reli@@ eve their ach@@ ill@@ es and stre@@ tch their feet , they were carrying out their medical acts when their doctor left the room and read that they had been .
&quot; i felt guil@@ ty because i was cur@@ ious , so i did not tell anyone about it , but i went to my home , looking for the disease in the library and scre@@ ened to the fac@@ -@@ society , &quot; he said .
when i received an answer , i was sho@@ c@@ ked and pan@@ ic@@ ked .
i thought i was in a whe@@ el@@ chair at 18 and dying at 25 , and in between i would slowly lose all my abilities .
i made all this with me alone and planned my own fun@@ eral .
she said when she was 17 , she realized that her abilities were not so much reduced as she would have liked and ques@@ tioned her doctor .
he stood up and hu@@ gged me and said , &quot; my love , i do not think you have that , otherwise you are already in the whe@@ el@@ chair . &quot;
i think you have something far less life@@ -@@ threat@@ ening .
after some genetic tests , it was found in c@@ mt .
&quot; when he told me what c@@ mt was , i felt as if i were a winner , &quot; she said .
char@@ ity c@@ mt uk has developed a c@@ m@@ t-@@ awareness month to help you respond to this disease .
the company is based in d@@ üs@@ sel@@ dorf , germany .
for almost ten years , the former tro@@ op training site in m@@ ün@@ sing@@ en has not been shot .

in december 2004 , the last shot of the tro@@ op training course in m@@ ün@@ sing@@ en fell , which ended in 2005 after 1@@ 10 years of military operation .

tax burden on business@@ people in the washington area is rising with economic recovery .
a recovery of the economy means more customers , more sales and new jobs .
it also means higher taxes .
state and local tax returns for companies in the country increased slightly last year , while economic recovery acceler@@ ated , so a newly published study in the past week , and firms in the area of washington made no exception .
companies in the district , mar@@ y@@ land and vir@@ g@@ ini@@ a jointly paid $ 2@@ 7.@@ 6 billion to government and local authorities in the financial year 2013 , an increase of 3.@@ 8 percent over the revenues of 2012 of 2@@ 6.@@ 6 billion .
the government and local tax burden on businesses increased by 4.@@ 3 % last year to $ 6@@ 71 billion , compared to 3.@@ 9 % in the year before , and it was the third con@@ secu@@ tive year after the several years of dec@@ lining .
government taxes rose more than local taxes to $ 4.@@ 3 % , according to the study carried out by the service agency .
more than half of district tax revenue , 56 percent , comes from corporate taxes , while 36 percent of mar@@ y@@ land ’ s income comes from businesses .
vir@@ g@@ ini@@ a gener@@ ates the lowest tax revenue from companies , accounting for 28 percent .
much of the increase in tax revenues is due to a recovery in the real estate values of companies , researchers say , which has led to an increase in real estate taxes by 3.@@ 7 % this year after the three con@@ secu@@ tive years of growth rates of 1 .
while much of these gains come from large states such as california , new york , and tex@@ as , the process seems to be similar for washington .
district , mar@@ y@@ land , and vir@@ g@@ ini@@ a jointly paid over $ 10 billion in government and local real estate taxes last year , compared to $ 9.@@ 6 billion in 2012 .
but the apparent recovery in real estate values is not as effective in increasing government and local government taxes .
companies in vir@@ g@@ ini@@ a and d.@@ c. pay almost half of their government and local taxes in the form of real estate taxes .
&quot; in mar@@ y@@ land , the following is happening : a large proportion of real estate , especially in the tax area around d.@@ c. , is owned either by the government or by non-@@ profit organizations that do not pay real estate taxes , &quot; said dou@@ gl@@ as lin@@ d@@ holm .
mar@@ y@@ land is therefore forced to focus much more on income taxes , for example , in order to provide the same services that other states offer .
the recent recovery in corporate tax revenues cannot be attribu@@ ted to the recovery of the housing market alone .
corporate income also seems to be reco@@ vering , so the data .
companies in the region reported income taxes at state organizations of 2.@@ 3 billion $ compared to 2.@@ 1 billion in the year 2012 .
mar@@ y@@ land invested $ 1 billion in corporate income taxes , the region ’ s highest amount .
while the trend is heading in the same direction , the local tax burden on businesses is not rising even@@ ly in all three places .
the increase in the district was 4.@@ 3 percent , corresponding to the national average , while the mar@@ y@@ land increase was significantly higher , 4.@@ 9 percent .
only vir@@ g@@ ini@@ a reported an under@@ -@@ average tax revenue of 4.@@ 1 percent .
vir@@ g@@ ini@@ a has achieved a significantly lower level of corporate income taxes ( in all three areas of its mandate ) , with 6 percent of all three .
the company tax rate in mar@@ y@@ land is 8.@@ 25 percent and the district is relatively high at 9.@@ 9@@ 75 percent .
a similar study by the us chamber of commerce earlier this year showed that lower government and local taxes were incur@@ red in vir@@ g@@ ini@@ a and that overall , there is a better tax climate than in mar@@ y@@ land .
the study did not examine the district .
despite the advantages , vir@@ g@@ ini@@ a is under pressure from its southern neighb@@ our .
north car@@ ol@@ ina has laws to reduce its corporate tax rates this year from 6.@@ 9 percent to 6 percent , the same rate as vir@@ g@@ ini@@ a , and the rate will be reduced to 5 percent next year .
if the government continues to meet its income targets next year , this law could reduce the state ’ s corporate income tax rate to 3 % by 20@@ 17 .
in the meantime , small businesses in the area of washington seem to be doing better , and they are therefore paying more government and local taxes , according to the latest study .
corporate taxes , which are used as personal income taxes by small business@@ men - a transitional structure that most small businesses are organized into - in the district , mar@@ y@@ land , and vir@@ g@@ ini@@ a rose by 20 % last year by 20 % to 2.@@ 4 % .
researchers say that the trend and the rise in corporate taxes across the country is likely to continue this year , with an increase in the general level of sur@@ plus tax revenue for the state and local governments by 6.@@ 2 % in the first quarter .
yet washington may be lag@@ ging behind if the spending cuts of the federal government were to affect the labor market in the region .
partner city : german beer for gu@@ ang@@ z@@ ho@@ u
ho@@ ps and mal@@ t - also in china a popular combination .
german beer enjoys an excellent reputation in china .
frankfurt ’ s partner city in china now wants a bre@@ w@@ ery and hopes to have a direct flight connection between the two cities .
german beer , used in frankfurt ’ s partner city gu@@ ang@@ z@@ ho@@ u – this is the urgent desire of the officials in china .
&quot; we would be delighted if a german bre@@ w@@ ery could set@@ tle in our city , &quot; said the vice party secretary of the south china metro@@ polis , li yi@@ we@@ i , this week on visiting a sp@@ d delegation .
time and again , the communist party of china ’ s ruling func@@ tion@@ aries respon@@ ded to this concern of the twel@@ ve-@@ million metro@@ polis .
gu@@ ang@@ z@@ ho@@ u , which is also called can@@ ton in germany , is one of the rich@@ est cities in china , war@@ ned li .
that is why people had the purchasing power to afford german beer .
the hes@@ sian sp@@ d chairman thor@@ ste@@ n sch@@ ä@@ fer g@@ ü@@ m@@ bel , who led the german political delegation , told the host that he would go to germany to look for a possible partner for the project .
&quot; for beer it doesn &apos;t take much : good water , gra@@ in and joy of life , &quot; he added at lunch with the party upper in gu@@ ang@@ z@@ ho@@ u .
mr li has already been able to shine his life , fl@@ at@@ ter him with the host .
the func@@ tion@@ er then came from gu@@ ang@@ z@@ ho@@ u with she@@ ph@@ er@@ d gu@@ m - albeit with red wine , which was added to the meal .
the chinese brand t@@ sing@@ ta@@ o is based on german bre@@ wing art .
t@@ sing@@ ta@@ o beer is produced according to the german pur@@ ity law .
more business
a second wish of the chinese hosts would be a direct flight between frankfurt and gu@@ ang@@ z@@ ho@@ u , said vice party leader li .
lu@@ f@@ than@@ sa had offered the flight earlier , but in 2012 it was cancelled for economic reasons .
&quot; it would be worth it again , &quot; the local politici@@ an showed convinc@@ ing .
&quot; business between our two cities is growing ever more &quot; .
currently , travellers would have to de@@ part via chan@@ g@@ sh@@ a in the hun@@ an province , li compla@@ ined .
the gu@@ ang@@ d@@ ong province , the capital of gu@@ ang@@ z@@ ho@@ u , also hopes to be connected to the airport .
the vice govern@@ or of the province , chen y@@ un@@ xi@@ an , made this wish in his con@@ vers@@ ation with the social democrats the main focus .
&quot; this is a very good idea &quot; , sch@@ ä@@ fer gu@@ m@@ bel , chinese depu@@ ty minister li j@@ in@@ ju@@ n , an in@@ timate con@@ no@@ iss@@ eur of germany , answered in agreement .
well-@@ maintained partnership
the be@@ wil@@ dering gu@@ an@@ gu@@ lar vice party leader hopes that the country will be able to become a partner next year .
li yi@@ we@@ i was already in the main but not yet in this function .
he came into office only this year after his pre@@ dec@@ essor had been exp@@ elled for corruption charges .
the local party leader , wan q@@ ing@@ lian , also had to go .
the action taken against gu@@ ang@@ z@@ ho@@ u officials is part of a nation@@ wide campaign against party and administration corruption , which was condemned by head of state x@@ i j@@ in@@ ping with ri@@ g@@ our .
the new leader li yi@@ we@@ i had been responsible for an american company before his party career , which was most unusual in the chinese communist party .
before taking office in gu@@ ang@@ z@@ ho@@ u , he was in fu@@ ji@@ an as a senior official , where the car buil@@ der v@@ w built a large factory .
frankfurt is officially more than a do@@ zen tw@@ in@@ ning towns .
the connection to gu@@ ang@@ z@@ ho@@ u , 9@@ 000 km away , is one of those that are maintained by both sides , such as a student exchange .
last year , the 2@@ 5-@@ year-@@ old german / chinese association was celebrated .
the southern chinese metro@@ polis on the pe@@ ar@@ l river is almost as strong as the whole of hes@@ se with its economic power .
next year , it is seeking to raise a gross domestic product of eur 250 billion , li reported .
family of jo@@ an ri@@ vers &quot; pus@@ hes the thum@@ b &quot; &quot; .
jo@@ an rivers has been a hospital since being introduced to new york city three days ago , and her daughter showed a very hope@@ ful presence in the hospital .
&quot; thank you for your constant love and support , &quot; said mel@@ is@@ sa rivers today in a communication .
we are all pus@@ hing the fing@@ ers .
her mother was re@@ porte@@ dly arrested on thursday after an emergency due to a heart failure in a clin@@ ic at the upper east side , yor@@ k@@ ville en@@ do@@ scop@@ y , in mount sin@@ ai hospital .
doctors deliber@@ ately keep them se@@ aled and under close observation until they are satisfied with their condition , which continues to be described as &quot; serious &quot; .

environmentally friendly vacu@@ um clean@@ ers and rising wages
for cars and vacu@@ um clean@@ ers that will be re@@ tail@@ ed from today , stric@@ ter environmental standards will apply in the future .
similar to re@@ fri@@ ger@@ ators and washing machines , new vacu@@ um clean@@ ers are given a label from september 1 on which the buyer can see key data such as the energy efficiency of the equipment at a gl@@ ance .
new cars are subject to the euro 6 category of pollu@@ t@@ ants , and nit@@ ro@@ gen o@@ xide values are more str@@ ingent .
there is also more money for s@@ ca@@ ff@@ ol@@ ding manufacturers : they receive a nation@@ wide uniform minimum wage of eur 10.@@ 25 .
amaz@@ on bu@@ ys t@@ wit@@ ch for $ 1.@@ 04 billion in $ 1.@@ 04 billion .
amaz@@ on has just confirmed what information reported on monday morning : the online re@@ tail@@ er - and video producer , and a lot of other things - bu@@ ys the video stre@@ aming service t@@ wit@@ ch for 1.@@ 04 billion $ ( $ 1.@@ 04 billion ) .
the announcement comes as a surprise , not because nobody expected t@@ wit@@ ch to take over , but because it was widely believed that you@@ tube would acquire the company .
three months ago , it seemed that the sale of t@@ wit@@ ch to google ’ s video service was a cool billion euros a month , and the cooperation seemed to be natural .
t@@ wit@@ ch , who was only founded three years ago as ju@@ st@@ in@@ .@@ tv , was established as a general stre@@ aming service - a live version of you@@ tube .
instead , it quickly became a platform for players who want to publish their bra@@ v@@ ours in games , a &quot; you@@ tube for live games &quot; , so an in@@ sid@@ er .
the t@@ wit@@ ch interface .
and &quot; let &apos;s play &quot; , a video gen@@ re in which better wis@@ er can describe ( mostly older ) play a paint of secret science theatre , are based on you@@ tube .
it is just that you@@ tube is often called when you want to describe t@@ wit@@ ch , so the message that you@@ tube is a t@@ wit@@ ch that you want to buy was bo@@ red .
it is a myster@@ y why the deal with you@@ tube was not made , as the company re@@ porte@@ dly was prepared to pay as much as amaz@@ on .
all we know at the moment is that statement by em@@ met she@@ ar , president of t@@ wit@@ ch : &apos; we have chosen amaz@@ on .
another secret , to be honest , is the incredible success of t@@ wit@@ ch .
for s@@ no@@ bs like me , who say that they prefer to practice sports rather than watch , it is difficult to understand the attr@@ action that assum@@ es that they can watch others while they play , rather than the control con@@ sole itself .
it is one thing to tell a friend about the shoul@@ der at 3 o ’ clock in the morning , while resid@@ ent evil is s@@ na@@ king , and something quite different to watch a sp@@ inner see him 20 times in one after another in c@@ inity .
all these games could be viewed right now .
another problem is that many of the most popular games today are e@@ go games , so watching can be done without any control of the perspective of the view , a really good reci@@ pe for head@@ ache .
i admit that the rapid procedures in which the ro@@ ger ban@@ ni@@ sters of our electronic age have played whole games in record time are very difficult to understand .
but until a game or hum@@ or@@ virtu@@ os@@ is is included , his t@@ wit@@ ch channel is probably not so interesting .
but what do ske@@ p@@ tics like me know about it ?
t@@ wit@@ ch is visited by 55 million different visitors per month and is the fourth largest source of internet traffic pe@@ aks .
and how exactly does amaz@@ on want to make money from it ?
it is difficult to imagine t@@ wit@@ ch being as elegant in amaz@@ on inst@@ ant video , as yo@@ t@@ um@@ be t@@ wit@@ ch simply would have s@@ wal@@ low@@ ed .
but t@@ wit@@ ch has something that every company would like : thousands of young men who have been adver@@ ti@@ sed as advertising customers .
as the chairman of t@@ wit@@ ch , she@@ ar , said , amaz@@ on and t@@ wit@@ ch &quot; both believe in the future of gaming , &quot; and the medium does not show any signs of shr@@ ink@@ age , not yet - even .
on the h@@ ü@@ p@@ f@@ burg at the bur@@ g@@ gar@@ ten festival on saturday there was a lot of going on .
the concept of the organiz@@ ers agreed .
despite the strong rain cast on saturday evening , an estimated 1,@@ 200 music fans came to the open-@@ air festival in bur@@ g@@ gar@@ ten .
at times , the admission had to be stopped .
&quot; that was an@@ no@@ ying , &quot; said ron se@@ m , one of the organiz@@ ers .
sal@@ we@@ del l light and fun .
max@@ im s@@ ach@@ ra@@ j and ron s@@ em have taken the name am@@ ula from two spanish words .
the open air in the salz@@ z@@ we@@ ide@@ ler bur@@ g@@ gar@@ ten is supposed to be a highlight of the day and in the evening through various shows .
well , and the fun is coming from it alone anyway .
this was evident early on saturday , when the first visitors came to the open air .
the organiz@@ ers had promised a festival for all generations .
and you have succeeded in doing so .
around the state of supply on the bur@@ g@@ gar@@ ten me@@ ado@@ w , both guests from the nearby and other surrounding were very comfortable .
they followed the first live performances , followed with the foot in the clock , enjoyed k@@ ü@@ h@@ le drinks - in short : pure relaxation and enjoy@@ ment were the order of the day .
and the way it is across generations .
while some are on ce@@ il@@ ings on the white sand on the beach bar , some are on the beach side , others are on the vin@@ o@@ the@@ k side , but the after@@ no@@ ons were on the hi@@ p castle .
but even in the case of children ’ s min@@ k@@ ies , the volunte@@ ers had a lot of work to do to help the and@@ ran@@ g and to create imag@@ in@@ ative cre@@ ations in the small faces .
the larger ones used the k@@ ick@@ er tables or participated in a sk@@ ate@@ board workshop that the good@@ foot@@ -@@ crew from sal@@ z@@ we@@ del had arranged .
until the great rain came .
just before 5.@@ 30 p.m. , he pr@@ ou@@ dly cr@@ ash@@ ed at the visitors , mainly families were looking for the wide and dry .
but the attr@@ acti@@ veness of the festival did not di@@ min@@ ish this .
&quot; there came more people than expected , &quot; said ron se@@ m , who spoke of a &quot; success all round &quot; .
that is why we are not in the way of a repeat of the big party next year .
although the content and size of the event still have to be worked on , se@@ m made a first statement on sunday in relation to the popular voice .
he described as an@@ no@@ ying that the admission has been stopped .
apparently , the security company had been booked with too little force .
as a result , some who had already paid no longer came to the site .
the response was very good .
in a first cau@@ tious es@@ timate , the sal@@ z@@ we@@ de@@ ler co-@@ organiz@@ er spoke of about 1@@ 200 visitors who were d@@ um@@ bling in the bur@@ g@@ gar@@ ten .
there were problems with sound technology .
the hi@@ p-@@ hop band &quot; n@@ `@@ ro@@ x bra@@ ke their performance , so it was un@@ ner@@ v@@ ated .
the techn@@ ici@@ ans were unable to produce a reason@@ ably sound .
the planned sh@@ ish@@ a loun@@ ges could not be built because the t@@ ents were not closed due to a ty@@ re sp@@ an .
&quot; next year , however , they will be there , &quot; says the organiz@@ er .
the premi@@ ere of the am@@ u@@ la@@ -@@ open-@@ air was more than successful from the number of visitors .
and that in bad weather .
however , the organis@@ ers have made some mistakes , which will be dela@@ yed for the first time , but which must be correc@@ ted in the second edition .
also in the social network fac@@ e@@ book the organiz@@ ers must introduce criticism .
&quot; sorry , but for 12 euros you just expected more &quot; , mel@@ ani@@ e me@@ i@@ er says at the event page .
&quot; you &apos;ve taken over a little , &quot; says e@@ le zim@@ mer@@ mann at the same place .
others do not see the initial problems as closely as they are .
i think it is very good that some people are not just st@@ up@@ id , but are really trying to put something on their feet .
hu@@ t ab ! &quot; , wri@@ tes ste@@ ph@@ ani@@ e jen@@ ß to the am@@ ula .
now , the organis@@ ers have one year to dis@@ pel these critic@@ isms .
new rad@@ om in ber@@ k@@ um : w@@ ach@@ t@@ berg ’ s land@@ mark sh@@ run@@ k
that is not the case , as we expect .
instead , the part that is ready to be installed in the striking structure is waiting for it to be inser@@ ted .
the action is in the context of a major measure : almost 50 years after the establishment of the ti@@ ra space observation rad@@ ar , the shell , the so-called rad@@ om , is completely renewed .
the new rad@@ om is equipped with a di@@ ameter of 4@@ 7.@@ 5 meters and is slightly smaller than the old one .
the size remains world record .
the last step to complete the new case is the cap@@ p@@ ella ex@@ chan@@ ger .
the upper part of the old shell is separated and covered with a cr@@ ane .
after that , the last quarter of the new en@@ velo@@ pe will be set up .
if the weather is in the air , the action should be taken at the beginning of this week .
particip@@ ant in the ic@@ e-@@ bu@@ c@@ ket@@ -@@ challenge will be able to get ki@@ ef@@ er and his / her own k@@ ne@@ es out of the competition .
is@@ ab@@ elle ro@@ ber@@ ts from the uk scre@@ amed so much as her ic@@ e-@@ cold water p@@ oured over her head that she had to change the bone structure of her face .
this ic@@ e-@@ bu@@ c@@ ket@@ -@@ challenge was pain@@ fully done .
a woman was ad@@ mitted to the hospital after she had been diagno@@ sed with the problem so much at the ic@@ e-@@ bu@@ c@@ ket@@ -@@ challenge that she had pul@@ led out the ja@@ w .
is@@ ab@@ elle ro@@ ber@@ ts from the uk was so r@@ inging when her ic@@ e-@@ cold water was p@@ oured over the head that she had to change the face structure .
&quot; the water was so cold that i scre@@ amed , and while i did , my ja@@ w simply stood , &quot; she said to the mirror .
ice water is sha@@ ken over the age of 20 .
is@@ ab@@ elle ro@@ ber@@ ts a few seconds before the accident
i wanted to close my mouth , but that did not go , the ja@@ w was ha@@ ted , and then i understood that something was not right .
my mother and si@@ ster saw it and made themselves lau@@ gh@@ ing almost into the p@@ ants , but i had to take the emergency .
the 20@@ -@@ year-@@ old from britain was ad@@ mitted to hospital to look after the ki@@ ef@@ er following the vir@@ al trend on tuesday .
the cli@@ p was developed for a web con@@ vers@@ ation and thousands of times on fac@@ e@@ book and t@@ wit@@ ter .
the bur@@ gun@@ dy clubs will soon pul@@ l together again ?
the last thing that we have seen is a cl@@ ash between the two wol@@ fr@@ at@@ sha@@ us@@ ers bur@@ g@@ vere@@ ins .
now , the boards of directors are thinking about possible cooperation .
as a model for the reconstruction of the wol@@ fr@@ at@@ sha@@ user castle , the late richard di@@ mb@@ ath , former chairman of the wol@@ fr@@ at@@ sha@@ user bur@@ g@@ fre@@ un@@ de , led the project in gu@@ é@@ del@@ on , france .
a year ago , there was no good climate between the bur@@ g@@ vere@@ in and the friends of the castle wol@@ fr@@ at@@ sha@@ us@@ en .
the positions , as they have been , so far seemed to be very different from those of the history of the wol@@ fr@@ at@@ sha@@ user burg and possible reconstruction .
now the two camps are moving towards one another : talks are to be held soon about a common approach .
the club board of directors tor@@ ste@@ n s@@ j@@ ö@@ berg ( bur@@ g@@ vere@@ in ) and her@@ bert pi@@ ff@@ l ( bur@@ g@@ fre@@ un@@ de ) confirm this on request of our newspaper .
&quot; i called mr pi@@ ff@@ l and suggested that we could sit down together once , &quot; says s@@ j@@ ö@@ berg .
he believes that in future , all members of both clubs could pul@@ l together again .
this is how we have seen more rapid results .
while the bur@@ gun@@ dy are still alive around the suddenly dec@@ eas@@ ed richard di@@ mb@@ ath , until the last time they had a reconstruction of the castle on the mountain forest , the bur@@ g@@ vere@@ in around s@@ j@@ ö@@ berg is the &quot; discovery and discovery &quot; .
her@@ bert pi@@ ff@@ l , the second chairman of the friends of the bur@@ gun@@ dy , was very pleased with the call , according to his own information .
since di@@ mb@@ ath ’ s death , he has been standing before his friends in the castle .
a new chairman is to be found in a members &apos; meeting in mid-@@ september .
currently , according to the 7@@ 4-@@ year-@@ old , the association has about 40 members .
&quot; after the death of my friend richard di@@ mb@@ ath , we have continued to support the association activities out of respect &quot; , which is a &quot; period of thought &quot; that was necessary to &quot; consider how to proceed .
according to pi@@ ff@@ l , the new chairman is to go into the con@@ vers@@ ation with the bur@@ g@@ vere@@ in .
until then , the friends of the castle could also have a current mo@@ od in their grou@@ ping .
there is not yet a candidate for the presidency , says pi@@ ff@@ l .
&quot; but i &apos;m confident that someone will find himself , &quot; he himself does not want to stand because he is resid@@ ent in bad to@@ el@@ z .
the new chairman should be a wol@@ fr@@ at@@ sha@@ us@@ er .
the to@@ el@@ zer wo@@ ol in the project &quot; but very happy to continue working &quot; .
the different views on reconstruction are pi@@ ff@@ led in the near future .
he recogn@@ iz@@ es di@@ mb@@ ath as a &quot; mis@@ sion@@ ary &quot; who always believed in the reconstruction of the castle .
two similar projects in austria and france , which are already well advanced , would show that this idea is not a ch@@ as@@ m .
the high level of participation of the population and voluntary workers from all over the world make them a tourist mag@@ net .
pi@@ ff@@ l : &quot; i was also s@@ cep@@ tical at the beginning .
but over time i have become more and more convinced that it makes sense to move the project forward &quot; , it could be a &quot; stand@@ alone &quot; for the f@@ li@@ r@@ ts city .
there is nothing else in this area .
moreover , the project would be supported by eu subsidies , visitor tickets and potential spon@@ sors , and pi@@ ff@@ l believes .
&quot; i want to make it clear that i do not want to throw the idea of reconstruction out of the window . &quot; he hopes that the bur@@ g@@ vere@@ in will perhaps move on this point .
their goal of docum@@ enting history first is &quot; important and good &quot; .
we could then look at it .
cle@@ ver ways to save on university tex@@ t@@ books
since the cost of university tex@@ t@@ books for many students is more than $ 1@@ ,000 per year , the fa@@ st-@@ second sem@@ ester student ma@@ t@@ t sch@@ ro@@ e@@ der considered a cle@@ ver sp@@ ari@@ de@@ e .
he inven@@ ted a system of lo@@ an for books by students of higher sem@@ ester and offered nom@@ inal compensation to facilitate the res@@ ale .
&quot; my mathem@@ a@@ tical book usually costs $ 18@@ 0 , but i got it for $ 10 for a sem@@ ester and a ch@@ ick@@ -@@ fil@@ -@@ a-@@ bis@@ cu@@ its , &quot; said sch@@ ro@@ e@@ der , 19 , who is the co@@ ven@@ ant .
the data required for the last sem@@ ester would have cost him $ 4@@ 30 , he said .
he gave $ 120 out .
the college leadership announced that the student would receive an average of more than $ 1,@@ 200 per year for tex@@ t@@ books and study material , that it would have different cost reductions for students .
online stores and creative approaches such as the sch@@ ro@@ e@@ der are increasingly the solution to the choice for students .
le@@ asing tex@@ t@@ books is becoming more popular , and students can create a book for a sem@@ ester , often at a much lower price than buying it .
ne@@ e@@ bo inc , which has more than 250 university book@@ shops , announced that the rental of books is not possible .
surve@@ ys in the industry show that about a quarter of the books in the college book@@ shops last spring were printed .
less than half of all tex@@ t@@ books are published according to the national association of college stores in camp@@ us book@@ stores .
here is a one-@@ off for the best deals .
buy online
some new books cost only one third of the price you pay in the camp@@ us book@@ store online .
the n@@ in@@ th edition of &quot; calcul@@ us &quot; v@@ no ron lar@@ won , bru@@ ce ed@@ wards and robert ho@@ te@@ t@@ ler costs almost $ 2@@ 90 , but can be found at the specialist tex@@ t@@ book re@@ tail@@ er che@@ gg@@ $ 23@@ 99 for $ .
used to buy
if you want to read the notes of other or normal usage tracks , you need to have used books as a good option .
&quot; calcul@@ us &quot; is used on che@@ gg@@ .com for $ 9@@ 3.@@ 49 .
mat@@ t cas@@ ad@@ ay , 25 , gradu@@ ate student at bri@@ g@@ ham young university , says that he is on amaz@@ on@@ .com spent 42 c@@ ents for a second edition of &quot; strategic study &quot; .
the book was sold for $ 48 .
aca@@ dem@@ ics such as ing@@ rid br@@ ac@@ ey , head of the university of mass@@ ach@@ us@@ et@@ ts at am@@ her@@ st college without walls , recommended students to study at their prof@@ ess@@ ors .
sometimes the updates for the seminar work are not relevant .
in such cases , older expenses can often be used for a fr@@ action of the costs for the latest edition .
besides che@@ g@@ g and amaz@@ on , hal@@ f@@ .com is a popular alternative for used computers .
ren@@ ting
le@@ asing tex@@ t@@ books is worth considering if you want to use them reason@@ ably well , remember to return them and you can book them after the course is completed .
you can pay more than 80 percent of the cost of a newly purchased book .
a student could , for example , call &quot; calcul@@ us &quot; for the duration of a sem@@ ester for about $ 20 .
find out about the terms and conditions of the business you rent , including the penalties that may apply to writing a note .
the ten@@ ant is careful : if you do not return the book , the penalty charges may even exceed the price of a new book .
e-@@ books
e-@@ books , rather than conventional tex@@ t@@ books , are also an option .
sometimes these books are de fac@@ to ren@@ ted by issu@@ ing an electronic license for a certain period of time by whol@@ es@@ al@@ ers such as amaz@@ on@@ .com , che@@ g@@ g and bar@@ nes &amp; no@@ ble inc .
at che@@ g@@ g you can buy &quot; calcul@@ us &quot; for 6 months for about $ 61 .
br@@ ac@@ ey says that students in liter@@ ary courses often find the best offers , because many classi@@ cs can be downloaded free of charge nowadays , while scientific and engineering tex@@ t@@ books can be very expensive .
look around at it in any case .
jo@@ e ga@@ ult , 29 , who will soon be the pe@@ p@@ per@@ d@@ ine law school , recomm@@ ends the is@@ b@@ n number for the price determination of books , since you can be so sure that you are the right tex@@ t@@ book .
and before placing an order online , ga@@ ult said , that the book is actually in stock .
he learned this lesson on the hard tour .
he bought a book that had four weeks delivery time and finally paid the full price in the college book@@ shop .
why &quot; guar@@ di@@ ans of the gal@@ ax@@ y &quot; no cash register hit was not made .
&quot; the exp@@ end@@ ab@@ les 3 &quot; by sy@@ l@@ ves@@ ter st@@ all@@ one played less than 30 million dollars of its 90 million dollar budget in the us , while &quot; s@@ in city : a d@@ ame to kill for &quot; was only $ .
the model tailored to camer@@ on di@@ a@@ z , &quot; sex tape &quot; , played only 14@@ .@@ 6 million dollars on the opening weekend , while children &apos;s films such as &quot; dr@@ ach@@ en@@ z@@ ä@@ h@@ men le@@ ic@@ ht 2 &quot; also hit the revenue .
an article from the te@@ leg@@ raph film cri@@ tic rob@@ bi@@ e col@@ lin suggests that children &apos;s films are not affected by the lack of quality in films themselves .
col@@ lin called 20@@ 14 the worst year for children &apos;s films , and described &quot; dr@@ ach@@ en@@ z@@ ä@@ h@@ men g@@ le@@ ich 2 &quot; as a purely &quot; functional &quot; fant@@ as@@ y continuation .
in films for a slightly older audience , however , it seems that the quality of the films is not necessarily the problem .
in july , entertainment weekly compared the average cinem@@ as@@ co@@ re@@ - and me@@ ta@@ cri@@ tic@@ -@@ rating for each summer movie start , which took place between the american mem@@ orial day and the 20th july 2013 and the current year .
the results are based on the opinion of the audience and film cri@@ tics , and indicate that this year ’ s film h@@ its are similar to those of last year .
some comm@@ ent@@ ators say that the development is due to changing vision hab@@ its and the growing popul@@ arity of web stre@@ aming services such as net@@ f@@ li@@ x .
director j@@ on fav@@ re@@ au , currently working on dis@@ ney &apos;s upcoming jun@@ g@@ le book film , said to the site h@@ all@@ y@@ wood .
we must accept this and not try to follow the past .
unlike the current weak cash out@@ comes of ho@@ ll@@ y@@ wood produc@@ tions , net@@ f@@ li@@ x has achieved sales of € 3@@ 9.@@ 4 billion with stre@@ aming content .
last summer , the director ste@@ ven spi@@ el@@ berg cri@@ tici@@ zed film studios for being too focused on film from co@@ im@@ ics .
in the light of the current down@@ turn , some comm@@ ent@@ ators argue that his glo@@ om@@ y pro@@ ph@@ ec@@ y may well contain a true core .
the expected potential for ca@@ usal set@@ backs in the summer of 20@@ 15 , including av@@ eng@@ ers : age of ul@@ tr@@ on , mini@@ ons , and jur@@ as@@ sic world , have made other representatives of the film industry more optim@@ istic :
the producer of x-@@ men , sim@@ on kin@@ berg , described the decline in cash results recently as simple &quot; cy@@ clic@@ al &quot; and said to ho@@ ll@@ y@@ wood re@@ porter : &quot; the next summer will be the biggest summer in the world .
when the second tab@@ le-@@ tennis district class was closed for ti@@ ghten@@ ing up the league division some years ago , this is a step in the right direction .
now the german table tennis federation has an additional 3rd bun@@ des@@ lig@@ a in the program .
as a result , those who have not clim@@ bed have gone down .
for example , g@@ ö@@ tt@@ ingen ’ s top class team tor@@ pe@@ do won the top prize in the ob@@ er@@ lig@@ a release , but will play only fifth in the upcoming season .
the fourth class will remain tor@@ pe@@ do ladies , despite their gran@@ di@@ ose march into the regional league .
the bo@@ ys and girls of tor@@ pe@@ do start in the lower sa@@ x@@ ony league , as well as the bo@@ ys of the s@@ c we@@ en@@ de .
the s@@ g ste@@ ering and tor@@ pe@@ do reserve are in the new association league .
the t@@ tv ge@@ is@@ mar plays a role in the association league , the tor@@ pe@@ do second in the national league .
what of the composition looks like a better district class , is now the new district so@@ ber@@ lig@@ a south .
here ts@@ v s@@ eu@@ ling@@ en , v@@ f@@ b l@@ ö@@ d@@ ing@@ sen , tor@@ pe@@ do iii , ge@@ is@@ mar , ein@@ bec@@ k , ham@@ en@@ ste@@ dt , bo@@ ven@@ der sv , lan@@ gen@@ hol@@ ten@@ sen and the f@@ c w@@ es@@ t .
in the district sli@@ ga , as regional representative d@@ ran@@ s@@ fel@@ d and the s@@ c we@@ en@@ de , in the district class of tt@@ c ii , ro@@ t-@@ wei@@ ß , the bo@@ ven@@ der sv ii and the teams of the tt@@ v ii .
g@@ ün@@ ter@@ sen , the tt@@ c and tt@@ v ge@@ is@@ mar ii are here with from the lot .
in the district sli@@ ga start tor@@ pe@@ do iii and sat@@ ten@@ haus@@ en / w@@ ö@@ ll@@ mar@@ sha@@ us@@ en .
with nine teams each , the team consists of nine teams each .
the s@@ c we@@ en@@ de sen@@ ds his girls to the small district sli@@ ga .
the hotel is also home to the sc@@ w bo@@ ys &apos; district sli@@ ga squ@@ ad - there is tor@@ pe@@ do ii still running - is not complete .
in a district class ge@@ is@@ mar , tus@@ po we@@ en@@ de and the bo@@ ven@@ der sv go into the season .
in the first season of the newly established regional association , the two g@@ ö@@ tt@@ inger circu@@ lar le@@ ag@@ ues with nine teams each start .
in the west season , the red / white ii , bo@@ ven@@ der sv iii , lau@@ bach ii , tor@@ pe@@ do iv and v , m@@ tv gr@@ one , d@@ ran@@ s@@ fel@@ der s@@ c ii , mi@@ el@@ en@@ haus@@ en .
in the eastern season , among other things , sat@@ ten@@ haus@@ en / w@@ ö@@ ll@@ mar@@ sha@@ us@@ en , ni@@ ko@@ la@@ us@@ berg and land@@ ol@@ f@@ sha@@ us@@ en are playing .
the ladies &apos; kre@@ is@@ lig@@ a consists of sat@@ ten@@ haus@@ en / w@@ ö@@ ll@@ mar@@ sha@@ us@@ en ii , bil@@ sha@@ us@@ en , hem@@ el@@ n , si@@ el@@ ingen ii , tus@@ po we@@ en@@ de and the s@@ g rh@@ hu@@ me .
this is still better than in the county of o@@ ster@@ o@@ de , where there are no women teams at all .
it is striking that none of the six secondary circle classes should reach star@@ ch , here the innovative and fu@@ zz@@ y district board will have to think about .
nato summit : first pro@@ tests in new@@ port and car@@ di@@ ff
at the weekend there were pro@@ tests from oppon@@ ents of the nato summit in new@@ port .
on saturday hundreds of people gathered in the centre of new@@ port to take part in an anti-@@ nato march .
on sunday , around 150 people came to car@@ di@@ ff in front of the town hall there to hold a so-called counter@@ -@@ summit .
ste@@ ph@@ en fair@@ cl@@ ough has followed the weekend developments for us and has spoken to demonstr@@ ators who have been travelling to belgium in brid@@ ging .
te@@ en@@ ag@@ ers from the blue mountains fle@@ w out of the blue mountains and were able to escape from the deser@@ t .
two young bus@@ h@@ wan@@ de@@ rers were put in safety with the ro@@ pe win@@ ch after they had spent the night in the blue mountains in n@@ s@@ w .
the 16@@ -@@ year-@@ old girl and the 19@@ -@@ year-@@ old man bro@@ ke shortly after sunday lunch in go@@ ve@@ ts lea@@ p in black@@ he@@ ath to their tour .
wor@@ ried rela@@ tives sh@@ ou@@ ted the police at around 8 p.m. when the two were not returning home .
a search party from local police and rescue services bro@@ ke up and the couple was killed at around 11 p.m. near the bri@@ dal ve@@ il water@@ falls .
the girl had hur@@ t her k@@ ne@@ es and the man had fallen and had put his head on .
rescue forces stayed over@@ night with the couple , and they were flo@@ wn out on monday morning .
they were placed in a stable state with a am@@ bul@@ ance in the blue mountains hospital .
anti-@@ government pro@@ tests in pakistan es@@ cal@@ ate
the approximately 1000 demonstr@@ ators were killed by soldiers from the p@@ tv building , said information minister per@@ va@@ i@@ z r@@ as@@ hi@@ d .
the station has left the broad@@ cast after half an hour .
p@@ tv director a@@ th@@ ar far@@ o@@ o@@ q said that the demonstr@@ ators equipped with stic@@ ks had equipment in the ed@@ it@@ orial staff .
dead or in@@ ju@@ red have not been reported .
the demonstr@@ ators are calling for the re@@ sign@@ ation of the head of government , to whom they acc@@ use of electoral fraud .
the police told me about one kil@@ ome@@ tre from the residence of prime minister na@@ wa@@ z shar@@ if , it was to cl@@ ash again on monday with some 3@@ 000 demonstr@@ ators with security forces .
according to hospital information , a polic@@ em@@ an was in@@ ju@@ red .
at least three people were killed at the weekend and more than 500 were in@@ ju@@ red when demonstr@@ ators tried to prepare for shar@@ if ’ s residence .
they are calling for the re@@ sign@@ ation of the prime minister .
the powerful military had to wait for the army &apos;s headquarters in the army on sunday evening after a meeting in the army headquarters for a political solution to the conflict , &apos; without wa@@ sting time and using force &apos; .
the communication also stated that the army will remain committed to ensuring the security of the state .
the es@@ cal@@ ating violence has caused concern about military intervention , which has been a frequent oc@@ curren@@ ce in the past .
the political and economic reforms that the opposition politici@@ an im@@ ran kh@@ an and the pre@@ ach@@ er ta@@ h@@ ir@@ u@@ l q@@ ad@@ ri have been holding since independence day on 14 august .
shar@@ if re@@ jects a re@@ sign@@ ation .
kh@@ an and q@@ ad@@ ri had called on their sup@@ porters on sunday to end@@ ure .
&quot; we will not go back without shar@@ if being forced to resi@@ gn , &quot; said kh@@ an .
q@@ ad@@ ri made a similar statement .
kh@@ an acc@@ uses shar@@ if of winning the parliamentary election in may last year by che@@ ating .
q@@ ad@@ ri calls for the re@@ sign@@ ation of central and provin@@ cial governments .
then a transitional government will reform the electoral system and call for new elections .
more than 40 000 security forces are in operation to protect the government district .
the prote@@ sters had initially appe@@ ased to parliament peace@@ fully until kh@@ an and q@@ ad@@ ri were able to call them to vote at the weekend to sh@@ ari@@ fs residence .
hu@@ t@@ tel@@ dorf after second season victory on place three of the table .
with the 2 : 0 over gr@@ ö@@ di@@ g has a bit@@ ter week for rapid on sunday an event@@ ful end .
&quot; the victory is very liber@@ ating , &quot; said tra@@ iner z@@ or@@ an bar@@ i@@ sic , whose team with the from in the euro@@ pa league had reached an intermedi@@ ate low on thursday .
&quot; the success experience was incredi@@ bly important , &quot; confirmed captain of the team and go@@ al@@ ke@@ eper ste@@ ff@@ en ho@@ f@@ mann , who was in third place with green white .
sch@@ ram@@ mel@@ -@@ dre@@ am@@ tor is rapidly laun@@ ching on sie@@ ger@@ stra@@ ß@@ e rapi@@ d , the second season ’ s victory has provided the right response to the dis@@ appointment against hel@@ sin@@ ki and is entering the country scene with a success experience .
&quot; we wanted to show a positive reaction , &quot; said foreign def@@ en@@ der thomas sch@@ ram@@ me@@ l , who , with his splendid leadership vol@@ ley from the six@@ teenth corner , set the course for victory in the 14@@ th minute .
&quot; i thought i had all the fru@@ stration of thursday and i quickly s@@ wal@@ low@@ ed him under the bar , &quot; said the 2@@ 6-@@ year-@@ old s@@ mil@@ ing .
when sch@@ ram@@ me@@ l was elected the last time in a bun@@ des@@ lig@@ a match on 13 november 2010 , it was still for ried .
the first championship hit in the rapi@@ d-@@ d@@ d@@ ress is therefore going to remain in his special memory .
&quot; for me this is something very special , i am from the rapi@@ d-@@ new@@ com@@ er , &quot; said sch@@ ram@@ me@@ l .
due to the short-term mu@@ d sheet by mari@@ o pa@@ ve@@ lic , sch@@ ram@@ me@@ l from the left put on the right def@@ ensive side and made the way for him there too .
he has had enough experience of mir@@ r@@ oring this position .
he deserves the goal , he has already done some assi@@ sts this year , &quot; comm@@ ended bar@@ is@@ ic .
team shows character sch@@ ram@@ me@@ l also provided the f@@ lan@@ k at 2 : 0 by ho@@ f@@ mann after about an hour which finally brought the decision .
the fact is that the guests could have written before that .
&quot; thank god we have had some lu@@ ck today , &quot; also noted sch@@ ram@@ me@@ l , who was referring to the cl@@ ash of performance and result in recent weeks : &quot; the results have not voted , but that &apos;s the game .
b@@ ari@@ sic even found that one &quot; had been better in many games than today &quot; - against &quot; the strong@@ est team that was in this season at this sta@@ dium &quot; .
the first three-@@ point since 26 july has therefore proved that the team structure is capable of respon@@ ding int@@ act despite the set@@ backs : &quot; today my team has shown that it is a character &quot; .
it is no less gra@@ ti@@ fying for him : &apos; we have finally played too little again &apos; .
a lot of work during the p@@ ause for a country is also the fact that with bri@@ an beh@@ ren@@ dt , mari@@ o pa@@ ve@@ lic , chri@@ stop@@ her di@@ bon , den@@ i al@@ ar and michael sch@@ im@@ pl@@ s@@ ber@@ ger several tri@@ als .
&apos;@@ we must not forget this &apos; , bar@@ is@@ ic war@@ ned , who has been working with beh@@ ren@@ dt and pa@@ ve@@ lic players for the last three days , &apos; which has been very stable recently &apos; .
the national break must therefore be used to &quot; w@@ ound the w@@ ounds and to play a little bit in the physical area &quot; , bar@@ i@@ sic explained , who was five u@@ 21 selec@@ tions .
one that is probably particularly convenient for the break is captain ho@@ f@@ mann .
he is te@@ aring up for the team , going over pain .
it is precisely at this difficult stage that he has shown that he is a very important player for us , &quot; noted bar@@ i@@ sic .
ho@@ f@@ mann gave the game rapi@@ ds prior to its replacement in the 6@@ 8@@ th minute not only the structure , but also achieved the second goal .
for the 3@@ 3-@@ year-@@ old who had his 3@@ 50@@ th bun@@ des@@ lig@@ a match , it was the first hit from the game since november 2 , 2013 ( 4 : 2 on the ad@@ mir@@ a ) .
ho@@ f@@ mann : &quot; must not believe that now everything is good &quot; &quot; we certainly have had a bit of lu@@ ck , but at some point lu@@ ck also has to come back to us .
now it was high time , &quot; ho@@ f@@ mann said .
he ad@@ mon@@ ished , however , to continue working in a focused manner : &apos; you must not always see this in black and white .
we have not played as badly in recent weeks as we have been told .
we must not , however , believe that everything is good now .
the importance of his role for the team was not dispu@@ ted .
it is a very young team , and i can help it very much at the moment .
they are keeping to me in certain ph@@ ases , &quot; said ho@@ f@@ mann .
gr@@ ö@@ di@@ g-@@ co@@ ach michael bau@@ r had little to re@@ pro@@ ach himself and his team .
he regre@@ t@@ ted the rapid counter &quot; from the category wi@@ z@@ ard &quot; , as well as the regular gate of nu@@ tz in the 40@@ th minute , which was declared un@@ ju@@ stly by re@@ fe@@ ree colle@@ gger .
the only acc@@ us@@ ation i can make to the team is that we are moving towards tor in some stages not concrete enough .
we have had too few conclusions in this regard .
interior def@@ en@@ der maxim@@ ili@@ an kar@@ ner saw it similarly : &quot; it started badly but then we found a way and even made a ga@@ te@@ way .
by and large , there would have been more in it .
under this m@@ ess , ru@@ h re@@ ign@@ s
we showed a powerful tri@@ be in our pu@@ zz@@ le task of the summer series &quot; my piece of the rh@@ ö@@ ner happ@@ iness &quot; last friday .

a little bit below the stone quar@@ ry from the bau@@ er@@ s@@ berg , one kil@@ ome@@ tre north of the road to we@@ is@@ bach , where it stands .
vital looks like the natural mon@@ ument , it rises above the other trees of the area and rec@@ alls with a range of more than eight meters an american m@@ am@@ mo@@ th tree .
a small bud@@ d@@ ha on a tree st@@ um@@ p indicates that it is a spiritual or my@@ s@@ tical place .
but , despite intense research , there was only evidence of the origin of the name .
dr. wol@@ f@@ gan@@ g sch@@ nei@@ der has consulted the bis@@ ch@@ of@@ sh@@ he@@ im@@ er archive and consulted older people from the un@@ ter@@ wei@@ ß@@ en@@ brun@@ n to find out what their own working relationship is with the s@@ cour@@ ge .
the result of his investigations remained the rather so@@ ber explanation for the name .
so up to 80 years ago , go@@ at she@@ ph@@ er@@ ds were supposed to have their animals put on the lab@@ ori@@ ously ro@@ as@@ ted and liber@@ ated by stones from the gr@@ ass@@ roots .
at the foot of the tree the trees are to be wor@@ n out by the clim@@ b .
meanwhile , the area has reg@@ a@@ ined its importance , because go@@ at her@@ ds are actually being found on the me@@ ado@@ ws .
the area has also become the core zone of the bio@@ sphere reserve , has further developed sch@@ nei@@ der .
when entering the stone collections , however , be careful , because the stone covered by the sun is not very strong .
a hiking trail leads from un@@ ter@@ wei@@ ß@@ en@@ brun@@ n to the tree , which is rather hidden .
other paths are indicated , the direction ho@@ ch@@ rhe@@ in up and lead to an extensive hi@@ ke .
where is the water@@ burg ?
a water@@ castle that is sought for our next task , however , is rather rare in al@@ titude .
the mir@@ r@@ oring in the mo@@ at gives a good impression of the building , but we have some historical buildings in the district , which could be covered by the building counter fe@@ i .

after weeks of tu@@ g-@@ of-@@ war , italy ’ s premier and current eu president , mat@@ te@@ o ren@@ zi , has fought strong conservative opposition at last week ’ s eu special summit to nom@@ in@@ ate his foreign minister , feder@@ ica mo@@ g@@ by .
ren@@ zi sees how the government newspaper la re@@ pub@@ b@@ lic@@ a , which has re@@ produced the voc@@ ation of his fac@@ ul@@ ty as a favorite in the government team as a strengthening of the position of the social democrats and his own .
he exp@@ ects a boost from this for his &apos; reform package &apos; in italy .
last but not least , ren@@ zi hopes that the re@@ vol@@ ving lef@@ t-@@ wing party base , which is constantly being called for , will be cal@@ med down , because mo@@ gh@@ er@@ ini will , albeit more moder@@ ately , be associated with it .
i have to say to the conservative representatives with president je@@ an-@@ cla@@ ude jun@@ ck@@ er and the polish president of the council , don@@ ald tus@@ k , that the prevail@@ ing opinion in rome is that a political balance should be struck .
the eu &apos;s chief diplom@@ at will be the vice-president of the commission , mr jun@@ ck@@ er .
the european parliament &apos;s outstanding approval is considered certain .
otherwise , president gi@@ or@@ gio na@@ polit@@ ano would have announced the appointment of the 4@@ 1@@ -@@ year-@@ old politici@@ an of the ruling democratic party ( p@@ d ) , hardly a &quot; important recognition &quot; of italy &apos;s role in the eu .
la re@@ pub@@ b@@ lic@@ a spre@@ ads optim@@ ism that the political parties that have been tried and tested in leading party offices for almost two decades and known for their ambition are facing the &quot; enormous challenges &quot; .
the native roman@@ s are married and have two dau@@ gh@@ ters .
her party career began with the ph@@ d political log@@ ist in 1996 in the youth organization of the then democratic di sin@@ i@@ stra ( left wing democrats ) , which was founded in 2008 with the catho@@ lic center party mar@@ t@@ í@@ n .
in 1999 , mo@@ gh@@ er@@ ini was elected vice-president of the european community organization of soci@@ alist youth ( european jun@@ g@@ socialists ) for three years .
with the election in 2001 to the lef@@ t-@@ wing party council , it entered the high party politics , worked in the foreign affairs department , of which she soon became head .
it occupied traditional fo@@ cal points of italian foreign policy , such as the middle east , was further strengthened by studies of nato dep@@ loy@@ ment in afghanistan , in which italy is involved with a tro@@ op cont@@ ingent .
since 2008 she has been a member of the chamber of depu@@ ties , where she is an expert on defence and european and international affairs .
when ren@@ zi was prime minister in february 20@@ 14 , he advis@@ ed mo@@ gh@@ er@@ ini to be his secretary of state .
if the p@@ d today wants to re-@@ establish a better relationship with the country ’ s strong peace movement , which is one of the party ’ s more than 40 % votes in the may eu elections , then , as p@@ d cir@@ cles have noted .
i am not happy with the acc@@ us@@ ations in brussels that the new eu foreign office has too little diplomatic experience , so there is no substance in it , in the p@@ d .
in brussels , poland and the baltic members in particular are being mis@@ led with realistic acc@@ ents being given to mo@@ gh@@ er@@ ini &apos;s crisis in ukraine and described as &apos; pro-@@ russia &apos; .
it supports the measures taken by the russian gas pipel@@ ine south stream , which is the russian gas pipel@@ ine under circum@@ vention of ukraine directly to the south of europe .
after ren@@ zi took office as eu president in july , mo@@ g@@ her@@ ini travell@@ ed to the country ’ s first state visit .
photos you took with putin at the sha@@ ke hands were taken in brussels with ou@@ tr@@ age , as were the fact that you did not want to leave the kre@@ m@@ lin chief for a milan economic summit in october .
on monday , nine young people took up their training at em@@ z-@@ han@@ au@@ er in n@@ ab@@ burg .
below it is an az@@ u@@ bi who has already completed another training in the company .
in the future , the new employees will be active in four training occup@@ ations : electronic ( three tra@@ ine@@ es ) , mec@@ hat@@ ron@@ ics ( two ) , tool mechan@@ ics ( two ) and process mechan@@ ics ( two ) .
all az@@ u@@ b@@ is come from the district sch@@ w@@ and@@ dorf : to@@ bi@@ as bra@@ un and thomas bu@@ cher@@ l from sch@@ war@@ z@@ ach , ste@@ fan br@@ ick@@ l and fl@@ ori@@ an re@@ wit@@ zer from sch@@ mid@@ ga@@ den , joh@@ ann@@ es be@@ burg be@@ be@@ be@@ ir@@ burg , joh@@ ann@@ es be@@ ob@@ er@@ li@@ e@@ ben .
the new tra@@ ine@@ es had previously visited primary and secondary schools and real schools .
from wednesday to friday , the tra@@ ine@@ es of all the years and the tra@@ in@@ ers go to ob@@ er@@ am@@ mer@@ ga@@ u to attend a team training event , where , among other things , an all-@@ day hi@@ ke and ra@@ fting on the inn .
the company has 4@@ 35 employees throughout germany and 9@@ 50 employees worldwide .
the number of tra@@ ine@@ es distributed over all years is 27 .
the socialists in france should &apos; keep their mou@@ ths and put france in order &apos; , said the main ally of fran@@ co@@ is hol@@ lan@@ de .
mr v@@ alls called the deeply divided left to &quot; protect their love &quot; for the controversial and un@@ balanced socialist president .
the president deserves everyone &apos;s respect , he deserves our loy@@ alty , he deserves our support .
&quot; it is our duty to stay at his side , &quot; he said at great applause .
as a re@@ ass@@ uring ge@@ st@@ ure , the prime minister insi@@ sted that his government should not leave france ’ s controversial 3@@ 5-@@ hour week , despite strong demands for the eas@@ ing of em@@ manu@@ el mac@@ ron ’ s regime , the new economic issues .
on saturday , mr hol@@ lan@@ de ur@@ ged his fellow socialists to &apos; un@@ ite &apos; with the government .
but christi@@ ane tau@@ bir@@ a , the minister of justice , stra@@ yed sand into the ge@@ ar@@ box , in which she was break@@ away at a meeting of break@@ away socialist members and the socialist party critic@@ ised for not having done so .
marine le pen , the far-@@ right leader of the national front , mo@@ c@@ ked the constant exc@@ av@@ ation by the socialists and said that they could not imagine that the new v@@ alls government would last longer than a few months .
fran@@ co@@ is hol@@ lan@@ de is the emper@@ or without clothes , but prin@@ ce manu@@ el v@@ alls has none , they are forced to form a new government if the old one does not even survive a summer .
&quot; and the new one will not survive the autumn or winter , &quot; said m@@ ä@@ u@@ le@@ in le pen to sup@@ porters .
she repeated her party &apos;s call for parliament to be dis@@ solved and said that she was confident that she would win in early elections , and was prepared to stand with the government .
the french ruling party suffered a defe@@ at in the local elections in march and the right-@@ wing national front was at the eu elections in may .
a survey in the sunday newspaper journal du di@@ man@@ che showed that 76 percent of french people believe that the french are not in favour of the risk of the french being forced to do so before the end of hol@@ lan@@ de ’ s 20@@ 17 term .
pas@@ cal per@@ r@@ ine@@ au , a political scienti@@ st at sciences po university , war@@ ned that the french were quick to take the pati@@ ence that they needed to get the new socialist government to do no economic and record improvements .
&quot; there is a small window of opportunity , but public opinion must feel fast that things change , &quot; he war@@ ned .
otherwise , the situation could continue to deterior@@ ate .

pro-@@ hong kong activi@@ sts condemn china the day after the election .
a pe@@ king@@ -@@ loy@@ al group near the country sw@@ ung the chinese flag .
the standing committee of the national people &apos;s congress adopted a framework law on sunday , which only two or three candidates for the hong kong leadership election in 20@@ 17 allowed .
all candidates must first receive the majority support of a nom@@ ination committee , which is expected to work with pe@@ king@@ -@@ loy@@ al members .
this decision will make it almost impossible for opposition democrats to be allowed to vote and led pro@@ -@@ democratic parties to vote for the resolution .
political reforms have long been a controversial issue in hong kong ; and china ’ s party leadership fears that calls for democracy will be extended to other cities .
after the publication of a white paper in beijing , which confirmed china ’ s domin@@ ance over hong kong in june , pro-@@ democracy activi@@ sts held an un@@ official referendum on the electoral process in the special administrative region , where the government was in power .
l@@ is survey is conducted by the hong kong government and the chinese li@@ a@@ ison office in hong kong .
the vice-@@ chairman of the legal affairs committee of the standing committee , z@@ han@@ g r@@ ong@@ sh@@ un and the vice director of the hong kong and mac@@ ao state council office , f@@ en@@ g we@@ i , should be asked during the day .
student activi@@ sts announced that they would be in front of the office of the head of the hong kong leadership in the afternoon .

putin is asking ki@@ e@@ v to open &quot; state@@ hood talks &quot; with eastern ukraine .
russian president v@@ la@@ di@@ mir putin demanded russian media reports on sunday that ukra@@ inian citizens ’ government should stop fighting the separ@@ ati@@ sts in the east of the country , and immediately begin negotiations on the &quot; state@@ hood &quot; of the break@@ away .
his spo@@ kes@@ man , di@@ mit@@ ri pes@@ ko@@ v , later made it clear that putin did not mean that this would be possible in the east asian region under the control of the separ@@ ati@@ sts , but that his status vis@@ -@@ à@@ -@@ vis ukraine should be re@@ defined .
putin ’ s call to the ki@@ e@@ v government to negotiate on an equal foot@@ ing with the pro-@@ russian insur@@ g@@ ents , however , f@@ its in with the policy of the regime that it apparently pursued five months ago : aid for the separ@@ ati@@ st .
in an interview with the state television channel one , putin condemned the ukra@@ inian military campaign to re@@ con@@ qu@@ er the political and economic areas held by separ@@ ati@@ sts in the eastern regions of don@@ et@@ sk and lu@@ han@@ sk , which was taken in march .
the kre@@ m@@ lin and the separ@@ ati@@ sts have recently described the area they have taken as &apos; no@@ vor@@ os@@ si@@ ja &apos; or &apos; ne@@ ur@@ us@@ sia &apos; , a term that remin@@ ds of the pre-@@ revolutionary shine of the russian empire .
putin pointed out that all those who , in the course of the campaigns of ukra@@ inian politicians for the elections on 26 october , were in danger of losing civilian communities in the areas occupied by separ@@ ati@@ sts .
&quot; we must start detailed discussions immediately , not only on technical issues but also on the political organisation of society and the state status of south-@@ eastern ukraine , in order to safeguard the interests of the people living there , &quot; he said .
pes@@ ko@@ v said that putin ’ s reference to state@@ hood in the context of greater autonomy must be seen , which has been rejected by the ki@@ e@@ v leadership for months , to address fears in rus@@ si@@ an-@@ speaking areas .
only the ukra@@ inian government can give the eastern territories the necessary autonomy , pes@@ ko@@ v said .
it is not a question of negotiations between ukraine and russia , pes@@ ko@@ v said , &apos; because it is not a conflict between russia and ukraine , but an internal conflict in ukraine &apos; .
the kre@@ m@@ lin ’ s clari@@ fication of the mis@@ interpretation of the putin regime is a sign of the eu ’ s leadership in dealing with the separ@@ ati@@ st re@@ bel regime .
moscow would have far greater difficulty in supporting the don@@ et@@ sk and lu@@ han@@ sk regions in eastern ukraine , as the majority of the 6.@@ 5 million inhabitants do not belong to rus@@ sians and surve@@ ys from the pre-@@ conflict period are a great deal .
the autonomy that russian diplom@@ ats have mentioned in international for@@ a would give regional governments in ukraine power to create their own trade agreements and external relations .
the half-@@ ba@@ ked peninsula in the black sea five months ago is the home of most of the russian na@@ vy and an important commercial port and historic coastal region .
the regions between the ro@@ sto@@ v region in russia and cri@@ me@@ a are also rich in mines , fac@@ tories and foun@@ dri@@ es , which are important components for the russian military .
ukra@@ inian president pe@@ tr@@ o por@@ o@@ sh@@ en@@ ko proposed a new policy for the european union in his speech on 7 june , which will be followed by new elections .
but his idea of autonomy seems to be in sharp contrast with that of the kre@@ m@@ lin and the separ@@ ati@@ st re@@ be@@ ls , whose arm@@ ament and inci@@ tement moscow is accused of .
putin ’ s last call to ki@@ e@@ v to negotiate with separ@@ ati@@ st leaders on an equal foot@@ ing followed another pre@@ em@@ in@@ ence of the re@@ be@@ ls in the last week , after russian troops and tan@@ ks had been killed over the border .
the separ@@ ati@@ sts supported by russia took over in the pal@@ try , which , according to the fears of ukra@@ inian security officials , was the first step of a campaign to take over the strategic coastal region to cri@@ me@@ a , control of no@@ wo@@ as@@ ov .
for this reason , massive civilian and military preparations have begun to prevent mari@@ u@@ pol , a steel industry , from being destroyed by the disaster .
por@@ o@@ sh@@ en@@ ko spoke at a meeting of eu leaders in brussels on saturday and ur@@ ged action to prevent another russian aggres@@ sion against ukraine , to prevent an earlier soviet republic .
&quot; we are at a point where there is no return , &quot; said por@@ o@@ sh@@ en@@ ko .
thousands of foreign troops and hundreds of foreign tan@@ ks are now on ukraine ’ s territory .
the eu summit did not decide on any concrete actions , the leadership demanded further sanctions against russia , which would be imposed on russia if the ukra@@ ine@@ an crisis es@@ cal@@ ated un@@ specified .
ukra@@ inian soldiers had to move away from their positions in il@@ o@@ wa@@ j@@ sk after two russian tan@@ ks and 1@@ ,000 soldiers were sent to the danube region last week .
the first probably 63 ukra@@ inian soldiers who were killed by the russian inv@@ asion of il@@ o@@ wa@@ j@@ sk were arrested on sunday against 10 russian par@@ at@@ ro@@ op@@ ers , who were arrested a week ago in ukra@@ inian territory .

the film city is in ex@@ ci@@ tement after a series of clear photos of a na@@ ked j@@ enni@@ fer law@@ rence in a h@@ acking scand@@ al about cele@@ bri@@ ties on the internet .
the h@@ ack@@ er responsible probably has 60 nu@@ de photos of law@@ rence , star from &quot; die tribute von pan@@ em &quot; and from super@@ star &apos;s , including the mo@@ del@@ s-@@ k@@ ate up@@ ton and car@@ a de@@ t@@ ton .
the austr@@ ali@@ an ac@@ t@@ res@@ a pal@@ mer , em@@ ily brow@@ ning , y@@ v@@ on@@ ne stra@@ ho@@ v@@ ski , and g@@ rec@@ ko from mel@@ bour@@ ne were sup@@ pos@@ ed@@ ly also taking private photos as a result of an ic@@ l@@ oud gap .
the list includes 10@@ 1 cele@@ bri@@ ties .
no@@ ble ones , who lost their love of g@@ rec@@ ko last month , said to conf@@ itable : &quot; it is dis@@ gu@@ sting . &quot;
all private letters and pictures should remain private .
it is a sh@@ ame that private information has been sto@@ len and can be shared with others .
g@@ rec@@ ko , currently in new york , said according to a news site that the h@@ ack &quot; sh@@ ame@@ ful &quot; and that the affected &quot; w@@ oun@@ ded &quot; felt .
the h@@ ack@@ er probably has 30 images of pal@@ mer with their ex@@ -@@ friend scot@@ t spe@@ ed@@ man , including two pictures in which it is up without a pool .
pal@@ mers &apos; films include &quot; love is inv@@ inci@@ ble &quot; with li@@ am hem@@ s@@ worth .
pal@@ mer , ch@@ uc@@ k-@@ star stra@@ ho@@ v@@ ski and ac@@ tress brow@@ ning from suc@@ ker pun@@ ch stood yesterday for comments on the h@@ acked images .
a representative of law@@ rence said to t@@ m@@ z : &quot; it is a he@@ in@@ ous violation of privacy . &quot;
actors se@@ th ro@@ gen condemned the h@@ ack@@ er in his t@@ we@@ et : &quot; h@@ acked images from a mobile phone is nothing else than to sell images of he@@ h@@ ler@@ ware . &quot;
from a purely legal point of view , the spread of sto@@ len images should not be toler@@ ated .
cy@@ cli@@ sts , jo@@ gg@@ ers and hi@@ kers were present at the 8@@ th cycle race on the great fel@@ d@@ berg yesterday and have thus joined the association &quot; help for cancer si@@ ck children &quot; .
the tour , which was a tor@@ tu@@ ous one , was a easy training for the others .
but there was one thing everyone agreed : it was fun .
thomas stu@@ dan@@ ski was probably sle@@ eping well last night .
for the first time in his life , the head of the ob@@ er@@ ur@@ sel bre@@ w@@ ery yesterday was riding on the fel@@ d@@ berg mountain .
for the good .
the little mus@@ cle ca@@ ke can be easily st@@ uck away , especially as it is not allowed to take part in the 8@@ th cycling on the big fel@@ d@@ berg in favour of the association &quot; help for cancer children &quot; ( frankfurt ) .
that is a great thing .
&quot; i know now that i can - great ! &quot;
small sho@@ wers on the way in the ap@@ ple@@ -@@ aus@@ p@@ au@@ ve ?
well , if i had ever stopped , it was out of ...
as thomas stu@@ dan@@ ski , who worked for the c@@ du in the ob@@ er@@ ur@@ sel city parliament , many of the 7@@ 18 participants were tor@@ tured in spring yesterday and came to the point of exhaus@@ tion , but happy to the pla@@ te@@ au .
others , on the other hand , have found it easier to cross the ele@@ ven kilometres long route between ho@@ hem@@ ar@@ k and fel@@ d@@ berg .
nor@@ man di@@ e@@ ß@@ ner , for example .
the green light that appears in red from the district - red d@@ ress , red beer , - made a big start .
he is also running the course in a sli@@ de , as did n@@ ina ku@@ hn , press spo@@ kes@@ woman of the city of ob@@ er@@ ur@@ sel , who , together with frank gr@@ ün@@ is@@ en , had set off on the road .
the first two tri@@ athle@@ tes were the &quot; fel@@ d@@ berg bike &quot; , not necessarily a sporting challenge : &quot; this is about char@@ ity , we are happy to play with it - we could have got an exit today anyway &quot; .
on the way , they had met paul w@@ en@@ z@@ el from ob@@ er@@ re@@ i@@ f@@ en@@ berg .
the boy ( 12 ) was down to ob@@ er@@ ur@@ sel in the morning to get up to the top again immediately .
the frankfurt fl@@ ori@@ an or@@ nam@@ ent had settled in the sa@@ at@@ tel at 9 a.m. in the morning , &quot; made &quot; the fel@@ d@@ berg twice , and then went home with fun .
the band also had fun &quot; fr@@ it@@ ten ton@@ i &quot; .
for the head of the ob@@ er@@ ur@@ sel@@ er k@@ ul@@ t@@ ki@@ os@@ k , cycling tours across the fel@@ d@@ berg are just a part of it .
he had a great experience with his 6.@@ 5-@@ kil@@ o racing bike for 40 minutes .
a cra@@ zy event .
for this purpose - i am happy to be involved here , &quot; said andre@@ as bal@@ z@@ ke .
the well-@@ trained main@@ zer says that he is an &quot; ambitious racing bike &quot; .
he must be , because he was not in the middle of the road with the &quot; fix wheel &quot; , which is also racing bi@@ kes , but without circuit ...
the fact that it went up loo@@ sely without a bike proved not only that the 20 hi@@ kers who cross the white wall and the fo@@ o@@ th@@ ills up to the summit , but also a jo@@ gger who was on a cor@@ d .
professor of mountain wat@@ ch@@ making , professor vol@@ ker lis@@ ch@@ ke , who is with his team , equipped with all-@@ wheel bul@@ ly and qu@@ ad , for safety , said : &quot; the k@@ ent &quot; i from frankfurt , the train .
the 7@@ 18 participants - and thus as many as ever - were on the course in groups in the morning .
the hi@@ kers at 9.@@ 30 a.m.
the first cy@@ cli@@ sts and run@@ ners followed at 10 a.m.
five minutes later , the first mountain bi@@ kers started off .
b@@ ent han@@ sen , chairman of the association &quot; cycling on the big fel@@ d@@ berg &quot; , gave the start comm@@ ands and wanted the participants a nice excur@@ sion .
for next year , he hopes that he will succeed in getting the route up to fel@@ d@@ berg to the safety of the participants .
