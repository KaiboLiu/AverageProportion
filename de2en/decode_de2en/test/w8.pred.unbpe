remembering the very american ideal of labour rights as human rights and human rights
the congress members keith ellison and john lewis have tabled a legislative proposal to make trade unions a civil right .
&quot; just as trade unions die , the middle class jobs die , &quot; said ellison , a democrat from minnesota and deputy chairman of the progressive alliance of liberals and democrats in congress .
i am therefore proud to be associated with the civil rights icon john lewis , the staff authorisation act .
this groundbreaking law gives workers the same legal opportunities to discriminate against trade unions as in other forms of discrimination - thus stopping anti-trade union forces .
the addition of the national labour law to provide an opportunity for discriminated workers to organise trade union representation is a way of protecting the workers in a civil court for justice - and to compensate for damages or penalties .
but it is certainly not a radical initiative - at least not according to american standards .
indeed , the best way to understand what ellison , lewis , and other sponsors of their bill suggest is to reconnect back to a very american idea .
despite the setbacks that trade unions have suffered in recent years - in wisconsin , michigan and other countries throughout the country - americans once treated countries around the world as encouraging to exercise labor rights .
there was a time when millions of americans still remember when this country was demanding democracy , freedom of speech , freedom of the press and the right of association in the same breath .
when the united states occupied japan after world war ii , general douglas mac arthur and his staff encouraged the country to adopt a constitution that would ensure that the united states ’ militarised autocracy hedged hedki .
fully aware that workers and their trade unions are helping to create a new japan , they used a language that exonerates explicitly recognised , that &quot; the rights of workers on unification and common renegotiation and action .
when the united states occupied germany after world war ii , general dwight david eisenhower and his staff urged the germans to write a constitution that would ensure that fascism was adolf hitler ’ s democracy .
recognizing that workers would have to organize , and their voice in the new nation , the eu ’ s germans added a clause explicitly calling for the creation of a “ national right ” .
agreements that restrict or aim to restrict this right should be seen as null and void , aimed at measures that are illegal and unlawful .
when the former first lady eleanor roosevelt presided over the international commission on human rights , which was the general declaration of human rights , as it was drafted by the united nations in 1948 as a global agreement .
for generations , americans have accepted the basic premise that labour rights are human rights .
when this country was discussing how to prevent civil and democratic societies , it was the americans who said that the right to create a trade union - and that it was the trade union that was then involved in collective negotiations as equal partners .
after these rights have been under attack in america , it is indeed very wise to look again at the american ideal , which means that the working population must have the right to unite and to live in a free and open society .
as pastor martin luther king jr. said 50 years ago :
history is a great teacher .
now everyone knows that the workers &apos; movement did not limit the strength of the nation , but increased it .
by raising the standard of living of millions of people , work has miraculously created a market for industry and has reduced the entire nation to unimaginable levels of production .
those who attack the work forget these simple truths , but history preserves them .
history is remembering , and we should do so .
formal recognition of labour rights as human rights - and the extension of the protection of civil rights as a protection against discrimination in the creation of workers &apos; organisations - is long overdue .
keith ellison and john lewis renew the ideals that have made america big in the past and redeemed the promise of democracy .
judge temporarily stops law that all abortion clinics in louisiana are forced to close .
a us federal judge provisionally stopped the implementation of a law in louisiana on sunday , which lawyers say would probably lead to the closure of all five abortion clinics in the state .
this measure , which was supported by bobby jindal , governor of louisiana , in june , and was adopted on 1 september , would be welcomed by doctors who have had abortions .
the judge ’ s decision , however , means that doctors will continue to be able to carry out legal abortions for the time being , while they are applying for such a right .
&quot; the plaintiffs can continue to work in compliance with the law while they strive to obtain these rights , &quot; wrote federal judge john degravelles in his judgment .
a hearing will be held for the judge within a month to ensure that the law is subject to a more permanent decision .
advocates of abortion welcomed the decision to take the latest in a series of judgments against similar measures and said that doctors would gain more time to prepare hospital injunction rights .
&quot; today &apos;s decision means that women in louisiana are escaping a disgraceful law that wants to deprive them of their health and their rights , &quot; said nancy northup , president and chairman of the centre for reproduction five .
it was not immediately clear whether the judgment would also apply to doctors from the two clinics who are the subject of the complaint and who are also entitled to take the case .
louisiana is one of 11 states that have enacted similar laws , with courts recently taking such measures in alabama and mississippi as unconstitutional .
key legal offices in texas , which represent most of the clinics remaining in the state , were closed by a federal judge on friday .
the american college of science ( cdu ) is a member of the international institute for the study of adolescence and of the american college of ostretricians and gynecologists .
opponents of abortion argue that the measures are designed to protect women &apos;s health , although some also have the effect of closing clinics .
only a doctor who has had abortion in louisiana has patient insignia rights , has shared the centre for reproductive rights .
if all other doctors in the state are forced to stop carrying out abortions , this doctor would be unable to carry out the operation for fear of his safety , the group said .
in her arguments against the judgment , representatives of the state louisiana said that they did not want doctors to be punished for carrying out abortions , while their applications for patient admissions were still pending .
delayed diagnosis and lack of access to the best treatment leads to higher death rates due to ovarian cancer in rural areas .
angelina jolie and her brother james have a video tribute for her mother .
for women in the rural areas of australia , there is a higher risk of dying of egg cancer than for women in cities .
researchers analyzed the medical data of more than 1100 australians , who were diagnosed with ovarian cancer in 2005 , and found that only 25 % were diagnosed five years after diagnosis .
the research leader susan jordan of qimr berghofer medical research institute said that for those who live in rural and remote regions of the state , the mortality rate risk during the study was 20 % higher .
small study : new drugs could cause lung and egg cancer , but they could also be reduced .
researchers studied the medical care of women over seven years .
dr. jordan said that a woman &apos;s age in diagnosis , the type of ovarian cancer , existing predisorders and the social and economic status also affect the chances of survival .
for older women and those whose cancer is already continuing to develop at diagnostic times , the survival rate was the lowest .
for those who live in rural and remote regions of the state , the mortality risk during the study was 20 % higher than for those in urban areas .
although the study did not investigate why women living outside the city are more likely to suffer from ovarian cancer , dr. jordan suspects a belated diagnosis and lack of access to the best treatments .
&quot; this disease is best treated by oncologist gynecology , and these are usually found in larger cities , &quot; she said .
despite the improvement of telemedical services to counter distances , it proposed as a possible remedy to increase the service of doctors flown in order to provide specialists with the opportunity to distillate women more closely to their place of residence .
dr. jordan said that the study , regardless of geographical status , has a poor long-term survival rate for women in ovarian cancer , and underlined the need for better treatment and preventive strategies .
the strategy proposed by rio tinto ride to conquer cancer is now being published in the medical journal of australia .
in march 2013 elisha neave , a young mother of 33 years , learned from the gold coast that she had an aggressive form of egg cancer .
garden centers regret falling household ownership numbers and the lack of land ownership .
the decline , together with a further decrease in the number of householders under 35 , could lead to garden centers losing tens of thousands of pounds a year if today ’ s young consumers , according to a study by hta , reported in the financial times .
the report says that tenants pay an average of 55 % of the amount , that people with homes spend for their garden .
the rise in people living in highly urbanised areas without gardens is the popular procedure , the precursor to park for asphalted animals and the declining garden size are other factors that threaten the industry .
in the greater london area , where the proportion of homeowners has risen from 61 to 43 % over a period of six years , the lowest expenditure on gardening products per household is reported .
the hta and the royal horticultural society point out that housing is necessary for rent or small gardens , not that people do not want to move plants .
guy barter , chief garden adviser for the rhine-based group said : &quot; container gardeners are very popular among tenants , for example , because they can take their plants with them when moving . &quot;
the hta report identified the period between 1997 and 2005 as the &quot; golden age &quot; of the garden retail trade due to rising household ownership and economic prosperity from the late 1980 ’ s to the mid-1990 ’ s .
he predicted a better performance of the market this year because of the better weather after unfriendly weather conditions in march and april last year .
the political and economic reforms that the opposition politician imran khan and the spiritual tahirul qadri have led in pakistan are continuing .
in the capital , islamabad , around 1000 demonstrators have overthrown the state television station ptv .
information minister pervaiz rashid said that soldiers had once again taken the protesters out of ptv buildings .
the station set up its operation for about 40 minutes , but is now sending it back .
at the same time , around 3000 demonstrators tried to reach the residence of prime minister nawaz sharif .
about one kilometer away , they provided with stalls and stones equipped collisions with security forces .
the police used tear gas .
the demonstrators called for sharif ’ s resignation , but he rejects it .
the country ’ s army is , in the meantime , urging a political solution to the conflict , &apos; waste no time and apply force &apos; .
after a meeting in the headquarters on sunday evening , the military said : &quot; the army remains committed to fulfilling its role of ensuring state security &quot; .
the military plays an important role in pakistan and has already been a frequent coup .
the opposition politician imran khan throws prime minister sharif out of office in the parliamentary election last may .
the protests escalated at the weekend after khan and qadri called their followers to sharifs residence .
three people were killed .
turkey is appointing us diplomat for espionage reports .
the turkish foreign ministry has awarded the world ’ s longest-serving us diplomat a report on american and british espionage in turkey .
vice-president bülent said that the secretary of state of the us embassy and turkish officials had discussed the report on monday .
the german magazine der spiegel and the online magazine the intercept reported that the results of the research carried out by the former us analyst of the national security agency , edward snow , show that turkey is a major area of activity for the uk .
according to turkish news agencies , the turkish president , recep tayyip erdogan , played the importance of the report down and said that all the major countries are playing each other out .
an earlier report that was also the most important intelligence service in germany , ankara , caused much annoyance by the turkish government .
warning strikes : train drivers are threatening to have consequences for commuters .
the local government ’ s nationwide warning strike on monday evening could also include passenger traffic in nrw .
the programme of the european council , which is announced at 6 p.m. , covers all the transport companies , including the long-distance , regional and s-bahn , and s-bahn transport , and also the rail services , and the transport of goods by rail .
the main thrust of the warning strike is freight traffic .

said the district chairman of the german locomotive federation ( gdl ) , sven schmitte , in düsseldorf .
we expect to see significant failures .
regional priorities are not there .
the main thrust of the warning strike is freight traffic .
deutsche bahn in nrw announced that it would do everything to minimize the impact .
the gdl did not say where it wanted to strike , however , so it is difficult to predict the consequences in concrete terms .
magaluf police chief accused of corruption
the prosecutors sent a letter to the office of the public prosecutor of mallorca on friday to prove the blackmail of the town of calvià &apos;s police and officials .
calvià &apos;s chief police officer on the island of mallorca was sentenced to death for corruption charges by businessmen and barkeepers in the notorious binge drinking hotspot magaluf .
the prime commissioner , josé antonio navarro , was arrested by several businessmen from punta ballena , the street where most bars and night clubs are located in magaluf .
according to the online newspaper mallorca diario , the prosecutors put a case for corruption charges in the public prosecutor &apos;s office on friday , and there was evidence of blackmail by police and city officials from calvià .
two other local police were arrested by the spanish civil guard in connection with the corrupt demonstrations of the spanish government and are being arrested together with navarro by a judge .
the spanish national daily newspaper abc reported that the angry nightclub owners said that they were not able to support the authorities &apos; cronyism .
&quot; it &apos;s no longer about making money , it &apos;s about survival , &quot; one of the businessmen said to the court .
let our livelihood be taken out of the game .
we have nothing to lose .
magaluf made a huge effort this summer due to a viral youtube video , in which an 18-year-old british tourist was shown , who was interested in 24 men during a shoot fellatio .
since then , the island authorities have tried to control the illegal behaviour of alcoholic holidaymakers in magaluf by reducing the number of participants in the notorious alcohol drinks .
the playhouse club , where the fellatio incident took place , was closed for a year , while playhouse and the pub were closed .
magaluf , a tourist resort that is popular with young british holidaymakers , is also known for a number of accidents involving alcohol , including the trend towards the &quot; balconing &quot; , which is affecting people from all over the world .
the first day of spring with wet and stormy weather conditions affects flights from adelaide airport .
the spring has a winter surprise in southern australia , with intense and intense showers and strong winds , which make flights from adelaide airport from a disadvantaged position .
in the evening , there were another 5mm rain on the city , after 6.6mm , which was already precipitated on sunday night .
the final rainfall was the result of a series of short , stormy showers , including a casting that began just before 8 p.m. and was suitable for almost 4mm precipitation in about 10 minutes .
after the winter last week for an early dose of spring , the temperature fell to around 20 ° c on monday .
the bad weather probably caused the late landing of a flight of virgin airlines from melbourne to adelaide .
the plane would have landed shortly after 7.30 p.m. , but it was hit by a whiff - a sudden change in wind speed or direction over a short distance - and had to take off .
at that time , windstorms reached about 50 km / h on the ground at the airport adelaide .
the flight data showed that the aircraft was also flying for a second landing flight and that it was finally redeployed at around 8.40 p.m.
the delay in the flight resulted in delays to some other flights , including an emirates flight from dubai and a quantas flight from sydney .
for adelaide , a maximum temperature of 16 ° c is predicted on tuesday , with possible showers .
matthies says : it is high time to connect to the internet .
given the technical advances that our cosiness has brought to our home in high-tech switchgear , we are now in a state of comfort .
while i write this here , my gaze at the spiral cable that connects the listener to the phone , and i think : boah , how retro is that ?
but there is one consideration : if the cable were not there , all the listeners would be in the house in a very short time , and that would be significantly more retro .
in any case , the ekeltronic ( eclectic ) system is in place .
no , typos : electronic ) sector the rule that the world &apos;s novelty today is the electric scrap of tomorrow , bought - obsolete .
and if you want to watch a tv in the living room , for example , you just say that you reject television in principle .
why are these considerations ?
because the pressure from the ifa on the radio tower this week again showed us our absolute incompetence in electronics issues .
the layman , who used to be a washing machine and cd player blind , does not even understand the purpose of the equipment that was designed with incomprehensible vague expert talk in front of him : &quot; connected .
yes , is it still possible ?
what should we talk about with people who seem to be voluntarily spreading such quark ?
in fact , for some 20 years now , the main issue has been that we should be very happy to network our house .
in order to be able to reorder the yoghurt itself , so that the fire alarm tells us during your holiday in the maldives that it is burning in the working room .
and would it not be wonderful if we could have the air conditioning from the office on our early arrival ... ?
yes , however , this requires air conditioning .
but a dream will certainly come true soon : we raise our watch for armbands , say you &quot; suck ! &quot; - and at home the vacuum rack is running out .
wrong .
everything is all about nothing less than a revolution : &quot; the borders between white and brown goods are blurred , &quot; a fire of industry experts , you can see the washing machine with a headphones .
we also know from daily practice that when a new and modern device is really needed , the battery is guaranteed to be empty .
another reason is that the spiral cable on the phone also features the next radio exhibitions .
israeli children are returning to their schools after the war in gaza and are now returning to their schools .
thousands of israeli children from the areas near the gaza strip returned to israel on monday , and they were given the summer in air protection rooms .
the school started off with the rocket holes municipalities in southern israel .
in the southern city of ashdod , the staff of the &quot; pashosh &quot; kindergarten , which was hit by a rocket , had shattered shards from the walls and shale before the pupils arrived .
&quot; we are a little afraid , but are excited , &quot; said ronit bart , resident in kibbutz saad and there english teacher .
many children from our area urgently need a return to a routine .
her 11-year-old daughter shani bart said that it felt &quot; a bit funny &quot; , suddenly again in the school .
&quot; these were difficult times , and we did not leave the house at all , &quot; she said .
president reuven rivlin visited kibbutz near the gaza border to offer his support .
until a ceasefire interrupted last week ’ s war , thousands of border communities like saad remained in their homes or left their homes to live in safer areas further away from gaza and to join the raft .
many inhabitants of nahal oz , a municipality near the gaza border , where a 4-year-old boy was killed by a palestinian murderer grenade , are still hesitating about to return .
the ministry of education announced that a dozen or so families have not yet returned .
their children were temporarily housed in other schools .
prime minister benjamin netanyahu attended a school in sderot , a border town with gaza that was severely affected by the palestinian attack .
he called on the children to learn a lot and said &apos; we will ensure that their knowledge is acquired and offer you security &apos; .
israel and hamas agreed last tuesday on an open-ended ceasefire .
the ceasefire brought an immediate end to the fighting , but important problems remain unresolved , as hamas ’ s call for the israeli-egyptian blockade of gaza and the reopening of the air and sea ports .
israel is calling for hamas to be disarmed and for the corpses to be handed over to two israeli soldiers killed in the fighting .
a new round of indirect talks is expected to begin in egypt this month .
in the war , more than 2,100 palestinians were killed , three-quarters of them civilians , and at least 494 children were killed , according to estimates by the palestinians and the un .
israel denies this data and estimates that at least half of the deaths are fighting for the peace process , but it did not provide any concrete evidence .
on the israeli side , 66 soldiers and six civilians , including a thai worker , were killed .
hamas and other gaza fighters fired 4,591 rockets and murderers during the battles on israeli cities , which were mostly in the south of the country .
meanwhile , the israeli military has carried out more than 5,000 air and other attacks .
the israeli attacks damaged or destroyed thousands of gaza houses and some 250,000 people suspected of being in more than 100 un schools .
while tens of thousands of people continue to live in the shelters and continue the fighting , the education authorities postponed last week the start of the school year .
&quot; i hope the school is soon open again so we can continue to learn as the children in the world and the jewish children , &quot; said mohammad amara , a 13-year-old boy who is currently in a school in gamma .
at the choice of saxony : cdu-vize strobl calls into question npd prohibition procedures .
given the npd ’ s losses in saxony ’ s votes , cdu bundesvize thomas strobl has opted for an end to the current npd prohibition trial in the federal constitutional court .
berlin - according to cdu bundesvize thomas strobl , the ongoing prohibition proceedings against the npd should be brought to an end before the federal constitutional court .
&quot; the npd is doing worse than last time , &quot; said strobl , who also runs cdu head of state in baden-württemberg , the &quot; leipziger volkszeitung &quot; .
this is a welcome development in the right direction and a development that i would rather see as the result of the npd being politically opposed and not taken to the constitutional court .
the npd was very close to the fifth percentage hürde in sunday &apos;s vote .
a first attempt to ban the extreme right party failed in 2003 because the constitutional protection was also in force in the npd tip of informers .
in december 2013 , after a long time of preparation , the federal council submitted a new application in karlsruhe .
the federal government and the bundestag did not join .
harburg : tents for new refugees
refugees are now being placed in new countries &apos; square in tents .
the central initial reception for refugees in harburg bursts from all seams .
now the interior authority has three red cross tents next to it .
the district politicians were informed just before - they are not very enthusiastic .
&quot; these backup actions continue to fuel public reservations and give the district politicians no opportunity to participate constructively in the humane housing of refugees .
your party demands that the district administration of harburg currently has unused houses for accommodation .
96 refugees can be accommodated in the three tents .
the reasons for overfilling in the initial recording are the onset of aid seekers - and the fact that the authorities have not given enough places in follow-up facilities .
many refugees therefore remain longer than the regular three months .
house prices have increased the most severe winter rise in seven years , shows a widely observed index .
the rp data corelogic hedonic home value index for home in the australian capital increased by 1.1 percent in august , according to rp data from monday .
this increase is the total increase in june , july and august , 4.2 % , the largest increase in the winter months since 2007 .
the annual price increase was 10.9 percent , more than twice the current increase in the 12 months to august 2013 , but the increases in the market were not even above the country .
the research manager of rp data , tim lawless , announced that sydney and melbourne had a two-tier market .
rp data figures show that house prices in sydney were down by 16.1 % last year , in melbourne , by 11.7 % .
the following markets are adelaide , brisbane and darwin , where prices are average by 5 and 6 percent .
at the other end of the scale is canberra , which is hard hit by cuts in government spending , and where prices have fallen by only 1.4 % over the year .
mr lawless also said that spring is now beginning to be a rise in the number of products for sale .
&quot; if you want to keep the constantly high rate of auction prices , a generally fast sales rate and the constantly low interest rates , you can find it probably that the selfhouse prices in the next three months will continue to rise .
in an opinion to the new press , he contradicts statements by the managing director peer medau and assesses him , &quot; like a feldherr &quot; to position him .
the style of the university is not this , it is stated in the communication .
the medau family was already orally informed about the request of the university in mid-june .
the statement that the plans were only known in july is definitely wrong , &quot; says pötzl .
at the same time , he points out that the plans are not &apos; predetermined &apos; or even decisions &apos; , but it is &apos; preferences &apos; .
the development of narrow roads , which is necessary for access , up to the castle , is also less dramatic than that feared by the medas .
the hotel was not , and still is , about a nine metre wide road .
as things stand , it is 5.50 metres wide , a metre wider than before , &quot; explains pötzl .
the argument of the medah operators that their free and school parking areas will then be used only by students of the university in future , pötzl does not want to apply .
it is not possible to park because , as in other public parking spaces , this can now be solved intelligently .
remember the residents who live near the city
the mountain ranges of the children ’ s camp , which are located on the site and on the front door of which the access to the parking deck is to be maintained , are said to be &quot; not affected &quot; by the president of the university .
instead , he points out that &apos; this is not just about the crèche , but also about the residents who live near the mouth of the friedrich-streib-straße and the 800 students of the neighbouring realschule .
so it is about much more than the special interests of messrs medau , &quot; says pötzl .
whether the criticism of the child care advisory council , the development of the road would be one of the &quot; few natural spots of coburg &quot; lost would be justified , &quot; the reader can be able to decide for himself &quot; .
in early october , pötzl , together with the state building office bamberg , will publish the city councils on the structural development of the university until 2020 &quot; and in this context address the importance of the new development &quot; .
peer medau had visited the parents of the crèche last week about the plans of the university .
the new parking deck is not to be accessed via the campus and the friedrich-streib-straße as before , but via the medach mountain .
this would have to be a two-lane road of about one kilometre length .
according to the medas estimates , the traffic in the park of hohenfels castle would increase tenfold .
there are about 2000 vehicles a day .
the city has not yet wanted to comment on the project .
glandorf is a national handball team that resigns from the handball team .
holger glandorf will no longer play for the dhb team .
the 31-year-old from the bundesligist sg flensburg-handewitt caused a major health problem in this decision .
i did not like the decision easily , it was matured for several months .
it is time for me to respond to the signals of my body and to pursue my career in the national team , &quot; said the world champion of 2007 at his facebook page .
it therefore has a record of 167 country games and 576 goals for germany in international retirement .
because the throwing giant backroom player for the champions league winner from flensburg still some years on torehunt .
with the icelander , who will be taking his cadre for the country matches against switzerland on tuesday , glandorf conducted a &quot; long and good conversation .
his ideas and approaches have inspired me as much as they have been my long-time fellow players and my successors .
but for my club i want to be available healthy in the years to come , for this is the need for longer periods of regeneration that do not allow the current double load .
the left-wing leader had , in 2012 , even lost his career after a heel infection .
because of achilleshänger problems he had been contacted by team doctors of the german handballbundes ( dhb ) with a cortisone injection which later caused a strong inflammation .
an emergency operation and two further interventions followed .
then glandorf had a complaint against the team doctor , the dispute ended with a settlement .
twelve years of professional and eleven years of national team career are not passed by any body without trace .
i have some health care facilities that i can no longer ignore .
after the three infection-related foot-surgery that took place in 2012 , i have been able to keep my blood pressure under control .
this includes a number of other complaints that are caused by wear and tear .
i started the year by saying that i had to steer my head but i didn &apos;t get my body wrong , &quot; glandorf explained in the interview to the magazine &quot; handball time &quot; .
for a comeback , it would only be available in an emergency .
&quot; when all the knitting tears break , i am always ready to talk , &quot; said the family &apos;s twofold father to the magazine .
however , i can not count the years in which i can play handball at one hand .
i must also say that , after my long stay in hospital in 2012 , i also became quite humiliating in terms of my health .
after my career , i would like to be able to go straight at least to some extent .
in addition to the 2007 world cup title and the 2014 champions league win , he won the 2008 hsg nordhorn and 2010 ( tbv lemgo ) ehf cup .
in 2012 , he also secured the european cup of the podium winner with flensburg .
german economy dropped by 0.2 % in the spring by 0.2 %
the crises around the world have hit the german economy in the second quarter .
gdp fell from april to the end of june 2014 compared to the prior quarter by 0.2 % .
this was shared by the federal statistical office and confirmed provisional calculations .
consumption alone revived the economy in the spring , while investment declined .
foreign trade , too , has slowed the economy .
thanks to the strong annual start , the total for the first half of the year is 0.8 percent higher than the second half of 2013 .
horstmar was the starting point and the goal of the &quot; münsterland-mooiste &quot; , which was first introduced to the burgmannsstadt on sunday .
the burgmannstadt horstmar experienced an invasion of dutch &quot; fiestas &quot; on sunday .
the largest cycling association in the netherlands , ntfu , organised the so-called &quot; münsterlande mooiste &quot; .
it is the biggest bicycle tour across the münsterland , the bike paradise , close to the netherlands .
over 1000 participants thanked jos ter huerne for organizing this tour through the munich cathedral .
the competition was held in various trade magazines .
we are from the heroes and we went overnight to take part in this tour .
we would like to take this opportunity to get to know the münsterland in a closer way , &quot; said the cyclists on the route through the circles steinfurt , borken and coesfeld .
after registering at the association sheim of the sta schützenbruderschaft .
katharina was on a small &quot; peace trip &quot; across the city across the wall , where the start was also made .
the route , which is advertised for three different categories , went towards manor wood over the schöppinger mountain towards coesfeld and about havixbeck and billerbeck back to horstmar .
on 95 kilometers of 1175 meters of altitude , 120 kilometers of 1475 meters of altitude and 145 kilometers of 1775 meters of altitude , the cyclists proved their good condition .
they were taken care of on the way in havixbeck and billerbeck .
main organizer jos ter huerne and mayor deputy heinz lölfing showed that this cycling event was a success .
we are satisfied and it was a great experience for all concerned .
the organisation went without problems and there were no negative incidents , &quot; heinz lölfing draws a positive conclusion of this event .
unfortunately , not as many participants as the organizer had hoped , which probably was due to the bad weather forecasts and the morning forecast .
&quot; we are back in 2015 , hopefully in good weather on august 30 or during another weekend , &quot; the cyclists promised to go back to münsterland and the organizers are planning a new edition .
konstantin wecker &apos;s honest memoirs are a great memoir .
it is actually more philosophical testimony than biography , which konstantin wecker , liedermacher , pacifist , polit-safe activist , ex-prisoners , in &quot; monk and kriex .
not chronologically , but more thought scaffolding has been the main theme of the new cosmopolitan era born on june 1 , 1947 , each chapter initiated by a suitable song title .
and he is being brutally honest : from onanie as a gymnasiast to shop theft and drug use , he does not leave human weakness .
also to show how he himself is tolerance in dealing with his fellow human beings .
broad space also takes abstract , but even more important terms : love , soul , ego , which is in the now , spirituality - all this he tries to get to the bottom , on very philosophical but also very personal .
and he also explains his pacifism , his social critique , his political commitment - and also how he is not only characterised by music ( the opera lover was elected soul and rock musician ) , but also his political commitment .
the latter has given the lebemann konstantin wacker a closer look at the ascetic monk , who is &quot; created by subtraction &quot; , as he says , &quot; leaving everything unnecessary &quot; .
there is , however , a short anecdotes between all the high-minded views : about beatings in a gis frequented local or a mad witty autojourney , where the person is frontline .
he is also being brutally honest about this .
lenny henry : my father never took me to the arm .
never said &quot; i love you &quot;
henry was one of seven children of a family of jamaican immigrants in dudley in the midlands in 1958 .
his father , who died when henry was 19 , worked in a factory and her relationship was limited .
henry is trying for a comedy , rudy &apos;s rare records , which is partly based on an imaginary conversation with his father and which is out of the series on radio 4 .
the soundtrack is a mixture of reggae and rap , with lively melodies .
but henry had to be able to work through some difficult childhood moments .
he attended &quot; many &quot; therapies after the death of his mother , and henry is reflective of his relationship with his father .
it was difficult to know him .
you never saw his face , just heard his voice : &quot; listen to the crash .
let your sister do it in peace .
get on with it !
i will look cricket .
my older brothers seymour and hilton - who were already grown up when i was a child - went to the pub with him and talked about things like the shape of beer glass or the beauty of a beer-crack .
i never had such a conversation with him .
for much of my life he was this serious guy in the corner who read the newspaper .
recently , henry opened a foundry in dudley , and although the conditions are better than at the time of his father , he gained a glimpse of how life had been for him .
it is now a little lighter , but they are dark , smoked , deep stylish labyrinthe with flame shots and smoke and much soot .
my father was simply sitting down in the bath and then i could hear him slowly as he began to sing because he had not been able to dress the foundry .
when i was there , i realized that he had been doing that for years to make food on the table .
however , henry grew up as a child without love testimony of his parents .
my father never hugged me , he never said &quot; i love you &quot; .
only when my mother went badly towards the end of her life did we begin to &quot; i love you , i love you , i love you &quot; to say .
through its own subsidiary billig , with dawn french , he could share the love he had missed as a child .
could you ever do with the &quot; i love you &quot; ?
stop hugging me !
papa , i am 22 !
with dawn french .
why should we not be friends ?
she is a great mother .
it is still with french friends , with whom he spent 25 years married .
dawn is a good man .
why should we not be friends ?
she is a great mother .
henry ’ s mother was a diabetic .
this contributed to their death .
so when i was very , very overweight and symptoms of diabetes , my doctor said , &quot; you must be radical .
so i pulled this fitness-out and also had to make a drastic diet to reverse the symptoms .
it is very difficult .
and it is exhausting .
no one likes eating carrots .
henry ’ s career shift may be reflected in his elegant , short cut bart .
since he was nominated by critics for his othello , he has been captured by the theatre .
the comedy of the errors followed , and then fences of august wilson .
this is a different experience from the sitcoms and comedies that have driven his busy working life .
he began with only 16 years when he worked in a factory .
a dj discovered him on stage when he imitated people and wrote to new faces about him .
his television career began in the mid-1970s . &quot; i was a very long time the only black imitator / comedian on television . &quot;
he learned in his profession .
i had to get big not only in front of the public , but also learn from 1975 to 1985 how to create an efficient joke narrative machine while watching a star through television , and that was really difficult .
lenny 1975 at new faces
since his manager was playing the stage right at the black and white minstrel show , a light entertainment programme , in which he was able to &quot; black &quot; his paintings .
i was very uncomfortable with my family .
i would like to see it never happen , but i do not regret that i did .
it was a strange , unpleasant position for me , but i was working on giant projects and learned how to deal with a large audience .
but this &quot; long-time award-winning , light pillar of british television &quot; was also a &quot; grotesque parody of black people . &quot;
by introducing figures that would make british black culture both mockery and celebration , henry worked in the eighties on an alternative comedy circle .
the first series of the lenny henry show went on show in 1984 , and in the 1990s he was among others known as the chef gareth blacklock in the comedy series chef !
advertising , documentary films , tv series and film rolls shaped his next decade , but after his bbc series lennyhenry.tv 2008 he thought : &quot; what is doing you as next ?
after that , a series of documentaries for radio 4 , entitled what &apos;s so great about ... ?
the first episode was about shakespeare .
i was really very allergic to shakespeare .
i never really learned anything about him in school and thought that he was a domain of the middle class , white in strumpfhosen and a coal head in front of him .
so i was very afraid of it .
all of us who interviewed for the show , peter hall , trevor nunn , adrian lester , judi dench said &quot; you should try it .
do not be bad if you do not know what you are talking about .
add some words to your mouth , and then you will understand why we all have shakespeare so dear .
henry led 20 lines from othellos last speech for the documentary and he was enthusiastic .
i felt i was able to do that .
it was almost as if someone had finally put my head on the right side .
&quot; that is what it is about , it is a serious matter , take them seriously , study your text , search a little .
the samples were brutal and i read this piece for months before we did it .
and it was a success .
they seemed to expect a car accident , and that was simply not the case .
and soon he appeared in the comedy of the errors .
suddenly i was in the national theatre and i could not believe it .
there was a moment when i thought &quot; oh , you changed you &quot; .
there was a technical error and henry felt instinctive that he had to entertain the audience .
&quot; a little voice told me &quot; you must now bridge 10 minutes while you repair the computer . &quot;
instead , the stage manager announced that the idea would continue as soon as the problem was resolved .
i went from the stage and something in me said &quot; oh , thank god &quot; .
i am not responsible for that .
i can leave that to someone else .
&quot; you play in a play , so stay in your role . &quot;
henry in fences at the duchess theatre
the text for fences to learn was challenging .
panic is very good , it strengthens the tendons .
that was a good thing too , so it is like a big shield of the gods who tell me &quot; this is your destiny &quot; .
he says this , of course , with a thundering voice .
so i will stick to it .
i really love that .
i love to be in a sample room .
henry still has the head of a comedian - our conversation has been followed by humorous outbreaks while he imitates people time and again .
i decided not to use a stand-up comedy because i think that this type of immediate satisfaction is essential from a room full of strangers .
if you search for this , you are facing a wall .
i sometimes play live at apollo when i feel like doing so , but overall i don &apos;t have as much as before .
i ask him if he ever wanted to create a stand-up comedy tour again .
the fun i had in a room with a director who helps to make a start , a middle section and the end of a journey - i do not think i can ever do it again .
is this his new incarnation ?
i think so .
i am a fan of this .
it is fun .
you always tell a story , and that is great .
i love stories .
people love stories .
huthi rebels are blocking roads in yemen ’ s capital city , yemen ’ s capital , the huthi rebels , roads in yemen ’ s capital city , and
in the conflict between shiite huthi rebels and yemeni ’ s government , the huthis have led to civil disobedience in the capital , sanaa .
huthi supporters could have been killed on monday in central roads in sanaa , said a spokesman of the huthi party &quot; ansar allah &quot; .
the access to parliament was also blocked .
yemeni media report a traffic jam in the capital .
according to the online edition of the newspaper &quot; yemen post &quot; , huthi leader abdulmalik al-huthi had called for the measures on sunday evening .
huthi , according to the sheet , threatened to escalate further , if his demands were not met .
the shiite huthis are fighting for greater independence from sunni-ruled yemen and demanding the resignation of the government .
the huthi tribe has been besieging yemeni capital for almost two weeks .
some 30,000 rebels have protests in the large access routes of sanaa .
there are frequent bloody battles in the surrounding area with the yemeni army .
kenya registers officials to recruit &apos; ghost &apos; workers , and to try to curb &apos; ghost &apos; workers .
kenya has begun to bimetric all state officials to &quot; ghost &quot; workers from the pay lines .
employees who cannot register in the next two weeks would no longer be paid , was a government communication .
the government suspects that thousands of people will still be able to be paid salaries after their departure from the public service .
president uhuru kenyatta promised a new deal on corruption in the public sector when he took office in 2013 .
at the beginning of this year , it was found that at least $ 1 million ( £ 700,000 ) per month of payments for &apos; ghost &apos; workers and other abusive financial practices were lost .
the government suspects that salaries will continue to be paid on accounts after a person has died or the public service is leaving , wanyama chebusiri reports for bbc from the capital , nairobi .
all officials must now be able to appear at identification centres in the next two weeks to ensure that their data on biometric registrations is recorded , was communicated in a government message .
all those who cannot do so without a credible excuse would be removed from the payroll , the communication continued .
&quot; this approach will make a significant contribution to rationalising public service by establishing the actual number of officials and also by increasing the salary list on both levels of government - so the &quot; ghost &quot; elites are eliminated .
the scandal surrounding the art consultant helge achenbach will be dealt with in court for the first time on 11 november .
five heirs of berthold albrecht , son of aldi ’ s founder theo albrecht , claim in a civil trial at düsseldorf ’ s district court 19.4 million euros compensation from achenbach and two of his companies .
this was shared by a court spokesman on monday .
the complaint states that achenbach had made a mistake in buying works of art and vintage cars and that berthold albrecht had paid higher than actual purchase prices .
this also makes the agreed commission higher .
achenbach has invested eur 121 million in valuables for albrecht .
children need roots and wings
he was in school for 44 years , 23 of them as a school leader .
from this time , manfred richter knows many of the original petershausen and kollbacher from their time as pupils .
his methods were sometimes unconventional , but always supported by his desire to see man in the student .
the snowkoppe is the most famous mountain in the giant mountains .
manfred richter loves the painting with the motif from his home .
judge was born in trautenau / north bohemia in 1930 , today trutnov .
he was already interested in the new course of the year at the age of 14 .
one year later , the sudeten germans were expropriated .
within half an hour the family had to leave their home .
after a few months in one camp , the road went to bavaria in 1946 - in the freight wagon .
it thus swallowed judges to the oberfränkische senddorf .
the teacher training took place in bamberg .
manfred had to judge ten kilometers a week to the next station , by train to bamberg , there three kilometres across the whole city to school , and then return to school in the evening .
after two months , manfred got judges in a red cross home in bamberg a sleeping opportunity : together with up to 15 students in a dormitory .
in 1951 he made the first and in 1954 , after three years of teaching candidate , he became the second state exam .
since he does not have a free teacher , he applied for a position in oberbayern and came to the school in kollbach on november 1 , 1954 .
the &quot; fräulein-zimmer &quot; was his first &quot; service-apartment &quot; in the school building .
in 1958 he received a degree in the new building of the teachers &apos; house next to the school .
this house bought manfred richter in 1980 , after the school in kollbach was dissolved in 1968 .
until then , kollbach had a school group in petershausen-kollbach , and in petershausen five classes .
from 1968 / 69 onwards , these were handed over to the town hall in petershausen .
when the indersdorf school association was founded , only primary school remained in the village .
to avoid a downgrade in the now smaller school , the former reactor georg sigl moved to karlsfeld and manfred richter was appointed his successor .
but petershausen grew , and so the children and their teachers were able to obtain the building that was built in september 1982 , and expanded in 1997 after judge &apos;s retirement .
manfred richter praised the uncomplicated generosity of the then mayor ludwig götz , who also built a workshop at community costs and , in 1997 , a cellar room , although this was not the guidelines .
&quot; mayor götz was very school-friendly , &quot; recalled judges grateful .
in his entire career , manfred richter never forgot the speech of a government representative who was referring to a department of a school council on justice and justice : &quot; you must never forget love &quot; . manfred richter judges .
&quot; two things must be said to children : roots and wings , &quot; says the 84-year-old .
and he had to know : &quot; this is not always possible &quot; , whether he is only talking about his students or his own six children , is not entirely clear .
in any case , judges do sometimes was unconventional .
when students checked , they were not given a penalty and were not given a seat to sit down .
at the expense of the community , judges had let two pit gloves and let the two counterparties compete , even though it was a veil .
for the good of the school , judges as rector maintained a good relationship with the then mayor ludwig götz ( csu ) .
he moved the partisan judge after retiring to be the last judge in 1996 on the csu list for the local council .
but judge was chosen in six and joined the csu .
180 km in three days
hr4-radtour 700 bikers are laying down in the spa park of bad salzhausen and schott stopovers in bad salzhausen and schott stopover .
if cyclists are interested in cycling in bad salzhausen or schotten , this is not in itself a special experience .
on friday , however , only the number of resting impressions made : the 700 participants of the hr4 bike tour and accompanying troops enjoyed a break in the lower spa park of bad salzhausen and later a party under open skies .
under the motto &quot; cycling and celebrating on newly discovered paths between nidda and kinzig &quot; , the participants met in bad vilbel on thursday and had a concert by van baker &amp; band .
on friday , it became serious : the cyclists took the first stage , 60 kilometers over florstadt to bad salzhausen and further to scots .
in bad salzhausen the athletes were awarded the prize for the first time by mayor hans-peter seum , who was on the bike in bad vilbel and the manager of the own company bad salzhausen , petra schwinger .
to refresh body and mind , there was a whole range of good things prepared : the women from the outskirts and the mockstadt had 85 sheets of apple , plunge , sprinkle and scatter cheese .
&quot; such cakes can only bake women in rural areas , &quot; praised a participant from aulendiebach , while he ordered another piece .
at the sports hall of the sgeiß-nidda gymnasium , cold refreshments were obtained .
the duo bravo entertained the visitors with well-known melodies from operettas and musicals and harvested enthusiastic applause .
the beautiful ambience of the park was relaxing .
a lord also enjoyed a head massage from his partner : &quot; he deserves , he deserves , after all he has already skipped bicycle chains now again &quot; .
meanwhile , the mayor and the manager of the company had to work : they were buried at the well in front of the drinking cub house of reporter rainer janke and took the opportunity to broadcast on the radio for bad salzhausen .
also phd tobias hagen , since the first hr4-bike tour in 2004 , was able to quickly run , had he had plenty of experience with the technology on the spot .
his pickup truck , where he was played by three telephones and a radio station with his staff and the 15-person motorcycle relay of the police of hessen , was facebook entries .
&quot; most of the participants come from the rhine-main region , &quot; he told , &quot; but also from gießen or fulda , from lauterbach or the taunus and even from numerous cities in westfalen are .
the number of participants is a little based on the available accommodation capacities .
in category i , participants will be accommodated in hotels , in category ii in collecting accommodation .
from the spa town the cyclists had a good impression when they were resting after an hour and a half : &quot; blow ! &quot;
&quot; it was beautiful in bad salzhausen ! &quot; they waved to farewell .
after arriving in scots , the group was allowed to take a short break .
but in the evening the cyclists were in the idyllic alteburgpark .
under the direction of the scottish tourism and urban marketing company ( gts ) , the park had a beautiful festival ambience and of course it had tasty , e.g. flammkuchen with well cooled springwhite spring water .
mayor susanne schaab , gts managing director markus hoßfeld and msc chairman wolfgang wagner-sachs in his capacity as ceo of the adac hessen-thuringia .
the three showed clearly pleased with the &apos; many businesses in scotland &apos; .
dj tobias hagen subsequently released the dance stage .
the opportunity to move freely under the open skies was not missed despite the sports activities on the bike .
the guests were increasingly interspersed with citizens who were as impressed by the good mood as the great scare of cyclists .
the second day the birstein , guardian bach and bad orb stations - including a concert with the trenkwalder - were on the agenda for the cyclists .
yesterday , after 180 kilometers of cycling , the athletes met again in bad vilbel .
dozens of turkish police officers were arrested for &apos; conspiracy &apos; against the government .
a total of 33 police officers were arrested in turkey on suspicion of &quot; conspiracy against the government &quot; , report local media agencies .
the police authorities did not make any immediate comment .
among the prisoners , 14 senior police officers , hürriyet dalan , have reported .
some of them were involved in the corruption investigations against government officials , including four government ministers last december .
in july , a number of turkish police officers were arrested for supposedly creating an organised criminal association and calling numbers .
turkish president recep tayyip erdogan ( who was then prime minister ) described their actions as part of the activities carried out by the islamist cleric fethulla against him and other people in the country .
not all children in ukraine return to school .
schools almost everywhere in ukraine opened on monday ( september 1 ) after the summer holidays .
this day is traditionally an important day for families , and as thousands of other ukrainian parents have brought prime minister arsenij jazenjuk to school .
there he told waiting journalists that not all schools had reopened , but that he was determined to prepare the country for future generations :
the september celebrations were not held at every school .
the sky is not peaceful across ukraine .
we must fight for a peaceful sky .
the entire ukraine , a huge common ukrainian people &apos;s front , must fight for a peaceful sky .
aleksan pastukhow , school leader in slavyansk , the jazenjuk daughter visited , spoke in russian .
we hope that peace will finally be restored here and that children will be given an education that will be useful to them in their further lives .
the first school day of the new school year is traditionally celebrated , with children embroidered shirts wearing balloons in their hands and giving flowers to their teachers .
with rona fairhead , the bbc has perhaps found the great director it needs .
it meets with a proud towering chestnut from the banking world , media management and the tory party ’ s inner circle .
and she has her own front experience .
her career began with the global management consulting company bain and co . , where she joined morgan stanley , bombadier , ici and the media world of pearsons .
she was the chairman of the financial times for seven years and resigned when the chief position of the parent company pearsons was transferred to a younger male colleague .
their compensation was supposedly close to £ 1 million .
their political ranking is also solid .
she was named by david cameron of lord browne , former chairman of bp , when he was asked to look for more private business knowledge in whitehall : she was appointed cabinet adviser .
her husband is a former tory councillor .
as early as may , i described the role of the chairman with a poisoned cup .
not only is the bbc a huge and complex entity at the heart of public life , but there is also an internal paradox in its structure .
confidence has two directions : inward , on the first guard of its own management hierarchy in the bbc , but also externally as the voice of public concern and unrest when things are going wrong .
this is what makes a duopol almost unsustainable , which demands a complete reform .
but what new chairman would risk calling for the european union to respond to everything and to disconnect an institution as complex as a chinese dynamic .
it is a difficult task .
and as if that were not enough , many are still interested in reducing the bbc - power that is money and status obsolete .
as the competition draws closer and new technologies threaten old , comfortable collateral , the forthcoming negotiation of licensing fees for the bbc is bound to pose particular risks .
for the modest sum of £ 145.50 per year , the british public buys into the certainly largest media company in the world .
the bbc tells a good story : it says it will reach 96 % of all households , each of which will cost only 40 pence a day .
and it seems that the bbc is rising on the popularity scale again : 53 % support today , in comparison with 31 % before 10 years .
the viewing and usage habits for the bbc have changed : i get news headlines today on my handset and see some missed news programmes later on my iphone .
but she remains a very beloved and remarkable institution .
it needs a considerable chairman - i hope she found him .
perry from texas says that descending tweet was not authorized .
a tweet from the republican governor ’ s official account of texas , rick perry , included a hefty remark on the democratic district administration ’ s attorney , which was at the heart of a political debate .
the tweet was later deleted and replaced by another from perry &apos;s account that removed the previous exit .
just is a tweet sent from my account that is not authorized by me .
&quot; i do not approve the tweet and have deleted it , &quot; it was said in the later message .
perry staff did not respond to requests for comments .
although the tweets are from perry &apos;s official user account , it was not clear who actually served the feed .
in the previous tweet was an unfavorable image of the district prosecutor of travis county , rosemary lehmberg .
perry vetoed the financial support of her office when she refused to return , but what led to an accusation against perry - possibly 2016 presidential candidate - who could be a presidential candidate .
the text of the tweets is : &quot; i am not always drunk with the triple permitted alcohol level ... but if i do , i complain to governor .
i am the most drunken democrat in texas .
lehmberg ’ s office was not in charge of the grand jury ’ s investigation of perry .
this was done by michael mccrum , a special prosecutor from san antonio , who was selected by a republican judge .
perry pleads against not guilty and called the indictment a political trick .
his highly qualified team of legal advisers requested a legal opinion from the judge responsible for the case , to denounce the charge and argued that the law that was being used against the most senior governor in the history of the country .
perry stopped $ 7.5 million of government money to the public integrity unit of the state - which was in travis county - and was then transferred to the government .
this veto caused a public complaint from a left-wing watchdog group .
perry &apos;s official user account is frequently updated - and sometimes famous .
after he was elected to the iowa elections during his presidential candidacy in 2012 , he went to the united states on speculation that the election would cease .
berkeley explains housing market as &quot; normal &quot; again .
one of london ’ s most prominent builders pointed out that the housing market in the south-east of england was once again at normal levels .
the capital &apos;s homes were very much sought after and the price increases , which made the bank of england a major contributor to the widespread fear of a credit bubble .
tony pidgley , founder and chairman of the board of directors of the high-class construction company berkeley said on monday : &quot; since the beginning of the current financial year , the market has returned to normal transaction levels since 2013 &quot; .
the london real estate market was well placed during the downturn , as foreign buyers pushed into the capital .
according to the cadastral office , the prices in the city area dropped by 18.5 % last year alone , far more than the average increase in england and wales in total .
the average selling price for berkeley ’ s private , cheap and student offers rose by about a fifth in the past year , and was around 423,000 £ at the end of april .
a stronger pound has , however , made property ownership in london less attractive to foreign buyers in recent months - some of them have also been hampered by the introduction of new property taxes and political rhetoric about a possible &quot; villa tax &quot; in may &quot; .
london ’ s real estate agent foxtons warned last week that the mortgage market report for april , in which the sharper dollar of credit lending is expected to be published , was published in the second half of the year .
new bank data from england on monday show a decline in mortgage allowance in july , which also indicates that the bank is in a better position to keep the housing market cool .
hamptions international , another real estate agency , corrected his prediction of the rise in london home prices for 2015 down to 3 % , based on a already weakening domestic asset price .
the transaction volume in the most expensive areas of london , such as chelsea , mayfair and kensington , has now fallen by a quarter year on year , according to the broker wa ellis .
however , the desire for a home in the capital for berkeley is a blessing , as the sums due for future sales amount to more than £ 2.2 billion .
mr pidgley added : &apos; the demand for the right , well-planned product at the best locations has remained stable and as a result the sales of appointments have also remained stable . &apos;
in june , the company reported that it had purchased 3,742 new homes in the year until the end of april - almost a third more than at the peak in 2007 before the crisis .
the annual pre-tax earnings rose by 40 percent to £ 280 million , sales rose by 18 percent to £ 1.6 billion .
in a communication on monday before the company ’ s annual meeting , mr pidgley said that revenue for berkeley is expected to exceed the current market expectations this year .
the analysts unanimously estimate the annual pre-tax result to be £ 450 million .
berkeley shares were in london in the afternoon at 23.96 £ .
nude photos of jennifer lawrence by hackers published on the internet .
jennifer lawrence gigs at the 85th oscarverzeichnung .
nude photos of the oscar prize winner jennifer lawrence were taken online by a hacker who claimed to have a &quot; master list &quot; of images of another 100 starlets .
a representative of the star from &quot; the tribute of panem &quot; confirmed that the photos of lawrence echt were real and complained of the hacker for &quot; blatant violation of privacy &quot; .
the authorities have been notified and will follow all those who have taken the stolen photos of jennifer lawrence .
the photos that were originally taken on the 4chan photo sharing page were supposedly marked by a gap in the online storage system icloud by apple .
it is not certain how many of the images are real , although winstead , star from &quot; scott pilgrim against the rest of the world &quot; also condemned the hack on twitter .
&quot; to those of you who look at photos that my husband and i took in the private environment of our house years ago - i hope you are really satisfied with you , &quot; winstead wrote on twitter .
victoria justice from nicholas series &quot; icarly &quot; and &quot; victoire &quot; series from the 1950s , however , claimed that the photos were images of her .
let us fight for the beginning of the game .
buzzfeed reported on late sunday that a spokesman of the pop star ariana grande was questioning the authenticity of the alleged photos of her .
exclusive excerpt from howard jacobsons ’ highly praised new novel about love and the letter &quot; j &quot; .
they were broken , so it was best described , they slowly dissolved like a carton that one could see in the rain .
occasionally a woman said to him that he was too serious , exhausting , intensive , distanced and perhaps a little scratch-resistant .
and then shaken his hand .
scratch-brushed he knew .
he was stingy , as in igel , yes .
the last victim of this stupidity was a recent affair , which gave a more promising signal for alleviating the lonely boredom of his life than usual , and perhaps even brought him some satisfaction .
ailinn solomons was a trembling tender beauty with untamed hair and a flapping heart from a village on the north island that is even more remote and smoother .
she was travelling south with an older companion , kevern held for her aunt , and who had built a plot in a damp but paradise valley with the proper name paradise valley .
for several years no one had lived in the house .
the tubes were leaky , the baths were still spiders , nude chests had their traces left on all windows and believed they belonged to all of them , and the garden was covered with weeds .
it was like the house from a children &apos;s fairy tale , both threatening and tempting , a garden full of secrets .
portrait of the author : howard jacobson , whose novel &quot; j &quot; is published on the longlist for the man booker prize 2014 .
the shortlist will be announced next week .
kevern had dealers with ailinn on the broken deck chairs in the high grass and had a exceptionally warm spring afternoon .
your feet are too big .
because of their own aggressiveness , songs of this kind were no longer played on the console .
not forbidden - nothing was really forbidden - just not played .
it was successfully obsolete , as the word obsolete .
the general taste created what decree and regulation would never have achieved , and how people could have used vom recordings to millionary memomoirs in books , cookbooks and love books .
in the euphoria of the day , kevern began to play an imaginary piano and to play in a coarse comic serenade of ailinns big feet .
ailinn did not understand that .
&quot; this was a well-known song by a jazz pianist called fats waller , &quot; he explained to her and automatically put two fingers on his lips .
this was what his father had always done to stop letter j before he was out of his mouth .
it had been started as a game between him and his father when he was still small .
his father had played it with his own father , so he had told .
if you start a word with a j without two fingers over your lips , it costs you a penny .
it was not a very fun game then , and it was not very funny either .
he knew that he was expected to do so , that was all .
it had to explain what jazz was .
ailinn had never heard of one .
jazz , even if it was not directly forbidden , was not played .
improvisation was no longer modern .
the room was very small , but the bathroom was very small .
at the beginning of a melody , people wanted to be quite sure where they would end .
the same is true of mind .
his unpredictability made people nervous .
and jazz was musically expressed mind .
although he had become 10 years old without being heard by sammy davis junior , kevern knew something about jazz of the half secret band collection of old cds of his father .
but at least he did not have to explain to ailinn that fats waller was black .
she was probably unable to remember a time when pop-singers were not black .
once again , no laws or constraints were applied .
a conformist society meant that each element of this society was grateful to the principle of group talent - grateful as the ones spared from fate .
people of afro-caribbean origin were characterised by temperament and body building for entertainment and sport , meaning that sanges and rants were made .
people who originally came from the indian subcontinent were like nature with electronic talent .
what was left of the polish community was to look after the sewer system ; what was left of the greeks was shattered plates .
those from the gulf states and the levante , whose grandparents did not leave the country quickly than what had happened when it happened - fearful of being shocked by fire .
everyone according to their abilities .
since she had only heard ballad , ailinn found it difficult to understand how the insulting words that kevern had just brought her forward , the more likely she could be toned down .
music was an expression of love .
&quot; they are not really offensive , &quot; said kevern .
except for people whose feet are too big .
my father never insulted anyone , but he loved this song .
he talked too much , but the neglected garden gave him the deceptive sense of security .
nothing could prevent the sound insulation of the huge carbon-like leaves .
ailinn still did not understand .
why would your father have liked such a thing ?
he wanted to say that it was a jux , but hesitated to put two fingers on the lips again in their presence .
she thought that he was a little strange anyway .
&quot; he seemed funny , &quot; he said instead .
she shakes her head unbelievably and blocked kevern &apos;s view .
there was nothing else in the world to see but their unsettled ravaged black hair .
there was nothing he would have liked to see .
&quot; if you say it , &quot; do you mean it without conviction .
but that doesn &apos;t explain why you are thinking it out to me .
she seemed to be genuinely concerned .
are my feet too big ?
he looked again .
your feet so directly not .
maybe your ankles , a little bit ...
and thou sayest me because my ankles are too thick ?
hate yourself ?
of course i hate you not .
that is just the stupid song .
he could have said &apos; i love you &apos; , but it was too early for that .
&quot; your thick ankles are exactly the reason why you like me , &quot; he tried it instead .
i am a little perverse .
that did not sound right .
it was a funny thing to say .
if he tried to be comical , he often found himself in trouble because he , like his father , did not have the soothing charm that one needed to make the living in jokes .
perhaps his father also wanted to be cruel .
perhaps he , kevern , wanted to be that .
despite his friendly eyes .
ailinn solomons was red and raised from her deck chair , threw the console around and spilled the bell , the wine she had drunk .
wine of the flower , so drunkenness was no excuse for him .
in their excitement , they seemed to tremble , as palmwedel in the storm .
&quot; and your thick head is exactly why i &apos;m perverted to you , &quot; said she ...
besides that i am not at all .
she was sorry for him , both because of the unnecessary unfriendliness of his words and the fear that appeared in her eyes when she stood up against him .
did she think he would beat her ?
she had not told him about life on the cold northern archipelago where she had grown up , but he had no doubt that it was essentially that way .
the same huge and icy ocean broke here as there on the shore .
the same confused men , with even more thicker skin and more susceptible to what happened than their ancestors were as smugglers and beach robbers , pulled from pubs to pubs .
thick head ?
they would have shown her a big fist if she didn &apos;t care !
you can take a look at the new website and find out what &apos;s going on in the next section .
kevern ’ s view was that this was unnecessary refinement , as the crunch itself was already an act of violence .
ailinn solomon gave him a sign to go through her body .
he rose from the deck chair as an old man .
she felt she was also staying , but the balance of his grief surprised her .
that was not the end of the world .
they hardly knew each other .
she saw him as he distanced himself - as he was from a room on the top floor her companion watching him - a man , complained by something he himself invoked .
adam leaves the garden , she thought .
she felt a sudden pain for him and men in general , although some had raised their hands against them .
a man turned away from her , his back prayed , ashamed , defeated , without fighting spirit - why was this a sight that she had to know well ?
when she was alone again , ailinn solomons looked at her feet .
several years before the events that have just been told , esme nussbaum worked , an intelligent and enthusiastic 32 year old researcher commissioned by ofnow , the non-legislative monitoring body for the european union .
&quot; a lot has been done , and much still needs to be done , &quot; she wrote , &quot; to explain the innate aggressiveness of a people that had waged a thousand wars and won most of them , especially in the remote corners .
but some properties are inexorable .
the higher the tower , it seems , the less the passion it continues to arouse .
the people of europe are crying in the hearing of sentimental ballad , exchanging stories of overcome difficulties and asserting that they are firmly attached to the virtues of marriage and family life , but the former is not only the rohs .
&quot; they have an unfortunate tendency to exaggerate , &quot; said their mentor when he read the whole report .
i suggest that you read fewer novels .
esme nussbaum lowered her head .
i must also ask : are you atheist ?
&quot; i do not think i have to say , &quot; esme nussbaum replied .
are you lesbian ?
esme again claimed her right to privacy and refused to make a statement .
feminist ?
silence is again being kept .
&quot; i don &apos;t ask that , &quot; luther rabinowitz finally said , &quot; because i am against atheism , lesbenism or feminism .
this is a job without prejudice .
we are serving a society free of prejudice .
but certain types of hypersensitivity , which are in themselves perfectly acceptable and commendable , can sometimes produce results as they have presented .
they themselves have obviously prejudice against the church , and these things , which they call &apos; disgusting &apos; and &apos; raw &apos; , could be as well seen by others as an expression of natural strength and vitality .
if you continue to ride around what happened when it happened , when it was , as if it had happened , it had happened yesterday , it means giving the country its essential vitality .
esme nussbaum looked around while rabinowitz spoke .
behind his head , an led label in flamingorosa repeated the advice that ofnow gave to the country in the last quarter of a century or more .
smile on your neighbor , value your partner , listen to ballad , visit musicals , use your phone , talk , explain , listen to , vote .
speaking is better than being silent , the healthy word is better than the written , but nothing is better than love .
&quot; i understand absolutely what you want to say , &quot; esme nussbaum answered with calm voice when she was sure that her superior had finished speaking , &quot; and i say nothing else than that we were not able to speak effectively .
my concern is that we are not going to be able to find ourselves in the process of repeating the mistakes that have only just happened when it has happened .
this time , however , it is not the others we are suffering from , and are not , our anger and distrust .
luther rabinowitz shaped a pyramid with his hands .
in order to suggest an angels patience .
&quot; they go too far , &quot; he said , &quot; if you call acts &quot; errors &quot; that our grandparents may or may not have committed .
they also go too far in saying that they will not be able to overcome their &quot; anger &quot; and their &quot; distrust &quot; of &quot; other &quot; .
it should not be necessary to remind anyone in their position that we are not doing anything to help understanding the past , as we do to protect the present , but to speak of &apos; us &apos; and &apos; others &apos; .
there was no &apos; we &apos; and there was no &apos; other &apos; .
it was a time of disorder , that is all we know .
&quot; from that , if we are honest to ourselves , &quot; dared to throw esme , &quot; no part of society can claim to have behaved well .
i am not complaining to anyone .
whether it has been done badly or well , what has happened has happened .
that was then .
there is nothing more to say on this - we agree on that .
and , just as no blame must be assigned , no guilt must be reimbursed if such a repayment is appropriate and if there is a way to repay it .
but what is the past good for if we do not learn from it - and i am not going to learn from it - if we learn from it - and we do not learn from it - and , if we do not learn from it -
the past is to forget them .
if i may say something about this , i would like to say something about it .
luther rabinowitz let his pyramid collapse .
&quot; i will consider your report , &quot; he said and dismissed it .
the next day , as usual , she went to work , she was overtaken by a motorcyclist who , as described by passers-by , was in a kind of &quot; brutal rage &quot; on the road .
there are some coincidences .
lesotho military member says that no coup d &apos;état is planned ; prime minister remains in south africa ; in south africa , the prime minister remains in south africa .
military officials in lesotho argued that a coup d &apos;état to overthrow the government would be ineffective in fighting policemen who were denied the possibility of armed political fanatics .
prime minister thomas thabane fled the country and said that the country ’ s army would have relocated its headquarters and that government buildings in the capital , maseru .
the premier brought his family to the adjoining south africa after he was threatened with attack .
military spokesman major ntelele ntoi said that there is no de facto coup , but that the military is responding to the threat posed by &quot; political fanatics &quot; whose armament is based on the military .
&quot; what happened this morning was that the staff of the defense forces of lesotho acted after he received several intelligence reports that were within the police some elements that were actually some of the political , party political fanatics .
the south african government spokesman clayson monyela said that the military action was a turmoil .
&quot; even if no one claimed that the government was seized by violence , all the reports agree that the activities of the defence forces of lesotho have so far shown signs of a coup , &quot; he said .
spokesman of the lesotho military announced on sunday that the soldiers had to return to their barracks and improve the situation in the capital .
in the meantime , the vice-president mothetjoya metering takes over the governance during thabane ’ s absence .
thabane said that he believed he was being arrested for trying to reduce corruption in the country .
in lesotho , there has been great tension since june , after thabane had parliamentary sittings suspended due to the disputes in his unity government .
he said that his actions did not undermine the government , that there were different accusations .
production in the euro area at a 13 month low
the increase in eurozone output slowed in august to lower levels , and the economic crisis has been a real occurrence .
the final mark purchasing management index of the manufacturing industry ( pmi ) fell in august to 50.7 in , after a booth of 51.8 in july .
a 50 is an expansion .
new orders were falling and factories were falling at a time of rising tensions between the eu and russia over ukraine .
the figures are available before the european central bank ( ecb ) meeting on thursday .
markets expect a clear plan from the bank for dealing with a reluctant eurozone recovery , and for the threat of deflation at a rate of only 0.3 % .
there is speculation that the head of the ecb , mario draghi , will be able to provide further information later this week as to whether he will provide quantitative easing for the eurozone , in line with that of the united kingdom and britain .
&quot; although small growth is better than no growth at all , the slowing effects of the growing economic and geopolitical uncertainties have become clearer for manufacturers , &quot; said rob dobson , senior economist at mark .
the factory pmi for germany , russia &apos;s largest trading partner in the eu , fell to its lowest level in 11 months with 51.4 .
meanwhile , the second largest economy in the bloc , france , the pmi , fell to 46.9 .
france remains a problem child , as is italy ’ s descent from solid expansion to stagnation .
evidence that stimulus for growth is in the key industry-driven mechanism of germany , as well as in spain and the netherlands , is also unreassuring , &quot; said mr dobson .
the decline in industry is likely to fuel the fire of analysts who are creating further monetary or fiscal incentives .
one positive news came from the republic of ireland , where the pmi rose to 57.3 , the highest level since the end of 1999 .
howard archer , chief economist at ihs global insight , said : &quot; the best thing you can do for the purchasing management index of the manufacturing industry in the euro area from august .
he added : &apos; producers in the euro area seem to find life quite difficult at the moment , as the current heightened geopolitical tensions - particularly with regard to russia and ukraine - have caused uncertainty in the still difficult conditions in many countries .
these increased uncertainties have clearly affected the economy - in particular , and consumer confidence , and probably lead to some orders being delayed or even cancelled .
he said that it would become &apos; more and more likely &apos; that the ecb would eventually have to launch a kind of qe , &apos; although we suspect that this will be limited . &apos;
the hell decade of beslan survivors : ten years have passed since the terrible siege of the school , as the enmeshed children have still suffered .
ten years ago , more than 1,000 people were killed by chechen militias in a school in beslan in southern russia .
more than 330 people , more than half of them children , were killed in the three-day martyrdom that shocked the world .
we returned to beslan to meet some of the victims who were killed in the abomination in the classroom .
exactly a decade after the appalling siege of beslan school , where 334 people were killed , including 186 children , the heldenic survivors warned last night of a new apocalypse .
as fanatical islamist terrorists , children and parents were killed on 1 september 2004 , when a new school year began , and they were killed , as it seemed to be the most evil of evil .
the tragedy united west and east in abhorrence , and then turned into more surprising , action and hope for the future , in the worst of misery .
ten years later , we returned to beslan to meet some of the victims who died in the abomination in the classroom .
we found surprising young people who overcome resistance , although memory of these terrorist causalities made them persecute forever .
your greatest hope ?
the fact that the war that is now plaguing ukraine - and in which children like you are dying - is now coming to an end .
the girl who was photographed in the attempt to get into the shattered school sports hall is now in a very difficult position .
she was shot by the russian star photographer dimitri beliakov and famous when she was only in her underwear trying to get into the shattered school sports hall .
aida was completely confused with her mother larissa , now 40 years old .
both were held dead , but they survived .
&quot; a woman told me i should race for my life , but i could not , &quot; said aida at that time .
my legs were flooded with blood .
i stood up and climbed in to go to my mother .
a soldier brought them to safety .
after a number of operations , she thought she was completely healed , but said yesterday : &quot; three months ago the pain returned .
i am afraid that i have to be surged again .
some shards of granatomas are still in my knees .
your goal is to become a dentist to help people , as you are helped by doctors .
&quot; this tragedy changed my life , but it did not break me , &quot; she says campfluffy .
&quot; that happened to me and that cannot be changed .
once a year i always go to the sports hall to remember those who stayed there .
my friends and i try not to talk about it on other days .
the pain is too great .
my best friend and future classmate dzera gapoeva was killed there .
we played together when we were small and dreamed of joining the school .
&quot; i do not want to marry until i finish my studies and start my career .
i am thinking of a family later on .
she says that the siege will always remain part of it , although the memory gets a little weak every year .
i am glad that many people around the world remember our horrors and we are so grateful for the help we received from people in britain and everywhere .
when i see the photo of me online as i climb back to school , i think that many people think it is the first time that they see our disaster and help to ensure that this does not happen again .
the boy who flew through the ball hooks , in the opinion that his mother was dead , and that his mother was dead .
it was his first school day ( russians go to school at the age of 7 ) and survived the three-day siege in the arms of his mother tamara .
as a seven-year old , he said , &apos; mama told me that i should lie down when there was an explosion and hold her hand . &apos;
after an explosion he thought she would die .
she said to him : &quot; run . &quot;
fearful that she could be dead , he fled and saw a weeping little child on the way , seized it by hand and flew through a ball hoodle .
his father vladimir , who had his son in the arms outside , said : &quot; damir told me that his mother had died .
he said : &apos; i could not save them &apos; .
in reality , tamara was stumbled outside and injured in the hospital , in turn , assuming that her son had died .
after her reunification she said : &apos; i wept for joy .
i could not believe it .
he ran in and hugged me .
damir was later fleeing to london ( from the meanwhile dissolved news of the world newspaper ) to be replaced by the then prime minister tony blair and his wife cherie by a barnardo &apos;s children .
&quot; this horror haunts you every day , but i wish i could stop remembering , &quot; he said yesterday .
but i can say that in my memory it becomes bleaker .
i still know that i can see all my toy guns right after that .
but now i can play computer games with shot scenes and that is no problem for me .
&quot; i am not afraid to go back to the sports hall , but i do not think about myself .
i remember those children with whom i played in the court and who did not go out .
we never say that they were killed or dead .
we say that you have stayed in the sports hall .
i remember very well my trip to london , especially the toy store , where i had to choose everything i wanted .
but now he is afraid of places like ukraine , where wars cause the kind of misfortunes he and his friends have suffered .
this horror haunts you every day , but i wish i could stop remembering it .
&quot; i &apos;m so sorry for all those who suffer from the abominations , &quot; damir said , who last week as a volunteer worked in a monastery .
i would like to help you .
one day i want to go to the police and i hope that next year they will take me to the school academy of education .
his mother tamara , 48 , said : &quot; 37 children from our neighbourhood were killed , you can imagine that ?
i remember the terrible silence after the siege , there was simply no children calling and shouting .
she vividly recalls her trip to london with damir .
the people of london cry when i told our story .
i understood at that time how people on the other side of the world could understand our feelings and show their support .
she was grateful to cherie blair and her foundation for the prize and the opportunity to travel to london in autumn 2004 .
i wish i could call cherie and just tell her that 10 years have passed , but i still remember the meeting i had with her and her husband in london and how the damir and me helped .
i remember how damir likes to eat borschtsch and she has eaten all local russian restaurants .
i remember him talking to waiters in a restaurant , damir was shooting with his water gun and she rang away and playing with the boy .
and that was just a month after the horror .
i was surprised that the british were so willing to share our pain and to support us .
she said : &apos; i always think that this world has not improved in these 10 years .
in ukraine , the war is now continuing , and every day people are dying , and i believe that many children have been killed and are still being killed .
these are just children like ours .
i think that for many of the war is part of the news that you hear when you get bored or busy with something else .
i simply know what these people feel , all the horror .
and i cannot stop feeling that .
nothing has changed , people still want to kill each other and that is so sad .
damir became big and is a very gentle and quiet boy , he is not aggressive or angry at all .
for example , he is not looking for revenge , he is not overwhelmed by the past horrors .
i know he does not like to remember that , but he has six close friends from the class and they occasionally go to the sports hall and fire candles there .
when he was smaller , he suffered - i remember how he sometimes looked at the sofa , the face of us turned off , hours of work .
not sleeping , his eyes were open .
i also remember how he used all his weapons and other military toys , and damir is now 17 , larger than i am .
i can hardly believe that i was so sure that he was dead for a few hours and i would never see him again .
when i recovered after the explosion and came on my legs , i looked around and saw hell around me , with around me , with body parts around .
i was absolutely sure that my little boy would not have survived in that hell .
&quot; i remember that i called him to &quot; damir , run , run away &quot; , but i was also so sure that he would not have heard me .
but he heard it and he has gone .
and so life goes , unlike that of many others , for us .
georgij ilyin , 17
the boy , whose terrible image after the siege became a symbol of the abominations of beslan , became the symbol of the abomination of beslan .
comfort : the beslan survivor georgij lyin with his mother fatima after the siege of 2004 , right a picture of georgij today .
his bloodshed was characterized by fear when he ranked for his life , while chechen terrorists were losing his classmates .
his image was one of the most shocking symbols of beslan barbarism .
his mother fatima , 54 , a doctor , had chosen him for his first school day before she rushed to leave her older son vladimir to the university .
&quot; i left the court about two minutes before the terrorists stormed it , and so my little boy stayed there for three terrible days alone , &quot; she remembers .
not quite alone , there was a whole family of relatives of us , but they were all killed .
only my georgij managed to survive .
the closer this date comes , the harder it is to think about it and talk about it .
there is not a single day when we cannot remember this tragedy .
we do not think it is long ago , i think it would have happened yesterday , to follow some scenes from these days forever .
no one will ever forget that , i promise you .
forcefully : the image of georgij ( left ) was one of the most shocking of the attack and was described as statue ( right ) .
i remember georgij being so happy to go to school this day , he said he wanted to restrain his teacher .
i knew he was alive when i saw him on television .
and now there is even this statue of weeping georgij in san marino .
georgij doesn &apos;t like the picture and it is home in our bookshelf .
i understand that , but i also think that people around the world , thanks to this image , feel our pain .
georgij says today : &apos; it is important that this kind of thing can never happen again .
&quot; i doubt that we will ever know the truth .
people continue to investigate such tragedies and never experience the truth .
and now investigate the crash of this boeing in ukraine .
will we ever know what caused it ?
this world is becoming a terrible thing .
&quot; i cannot understand how this is possible , because if you ask people , no one wants a war , so how is it done ?
ten years is nothing at all with such pain .
we need dozens of years to forget it a little .
it has attacked my health and i still feel it .
for about three or four years i had a few nightmares because of siege , but then it became better .
i went back to school in 2004 and was afraid every day .
i thought of my friends and classmates who were killed .
that is why i always go to the sports hall when 1 september approaches .
i want to pay tribute to my old childhood friends .
it is difficult for me to go to the sports hall , but i have to do it .
i do not feel a victim , this story is now part of my past .
i will not forget it , but i do not regret it .
my life continues .
i finished school this year and i am visiting a medical university in vladikawkaz .
i will be heart surgeon .
my first choice was an education in the army .
i wanted to be a soldier , but my health did not allow that .
i wanted to fight for my country , but that will not happen .
georgij faniyev , 20
the boy who survived , though he was at the foot of a murderous terrorist , was captured by a murderous terrorist .
a miracle : georgij faniyev was at the foot of a murderous terrorist during the siege , but he managed to survive .
during the siege , he was caught in the sports hall and sat next to the bomb at the foot of a murderous terrorist .
it is a real miracle that he was not killed .
&quot; we feel it was yesterday , &quot; says georgij , who is working as intelligence officer for the fsb , but because of his health damage due to the siege .
it is still with me , it is not something i left behind .
i am now older and people say that children can easily deal with bad experiences - i have to say that is not true .
&quot; in 2006 i worked with psychologists and felt a little better after that , but i can not forget it .
and i would like to forget .
2005 - in the year after - was the first and only time i went back to the sports hall .
i lost consciousness .
i will never return to it and please do not ask me to show you where i can be in this famous picture .
survivors : georgij faniyev today , with a photo of himself in the hospital after the siege on the laptop after the siege on the laptop .
my pain is immense and i wear it with me every day .
my friends know that i do not like to think about it or talk about it and they never asked me about school .
i am physically well off .
i should be careful with my wounded knee , but i can now run well .
but because of my health i could not attend the fsb ’ s secret service academy in saint petersburg as i wanted .
i have submitted my documents , including the medical documents , and you have replied that it is not possible .
my second passion was the animals , so i went to the veterinary institute .
i have been behind me for two years .
he learns the treatment of all animals from cats to cows .
he said : &apos; i knew i had never told my children about my experiences .
children should not know about this , and they should not , of course , suffer it .
his mother marina , 42 , said : &quot; this pain never leaves me .
it is in my soul , worse when the anniversary is approaching .
i will go to the celebrations to commemorate .
i know that georgia will not go .
he must be much more vigorous because he was there and i do not .
i waited at home for him and could not help .
i am so grateful to god that he has been given back to me , and here in beslan all of them are drawn .
it remains in us .
georgij is now an adult , but this horror is still in him .
it is difficult to accept that if something so unfair is encountered .
he is a boy , he likes sport , but he cannot participate because of his knees .
he has been operated several times , he can run but he can not do sport .
i would say that he is 50 % behind the horror , but you can never completely forget that .
this terrible experience will always be with us .
many friends and neighbours were killed during the siege , and this only reinforces my pain .
i have lost many people , whom i knew well and who were expensive to me .
my son is with me , and that is the greatest gift that god could make me , but my heart crying for the killed .
i know of families where new children were born , but also of widows who have never again married .
it is difficult to accept that life will continue , even if that is not what we want .
i will never forget how my heart jumped in me when i saw him in hospital .
and now i see what is happening in the world - wars in other regions .
what are these people fighting for ?
why kill each other ?
the war is now very close to our country and i almost cannot believe it .
we were a friendly country in the past , how can it be that we are fighting now ?
people and children suffer , i am sure that many children have already been killed in ukraine and many are still being killed .
if we only grasp and throw out all these rebels - as far as possible .
aljona tskajewa , 10 km from the airport , 10 km from the airport , 10 km from the airport , 10 km from the airport .
the baby , which is so susceptible to being carried by a special command in safety , is a very important part of the operation .
saves : aljona tskajewa is led by a russian special command ( left ) .
it is now ten ( right ) and does not even remember the cruelties of the past .
the world held its breath in 2004 , when baby aljona was killed in the arms of a russian policeman from the siege of beslan .
the terrorists let them go , but kept their 30-year-old mother , the 10-year-old kristina and her brother makhar in school sports school in their cruelty .
makhar , three years old at that time , escaped , but aljona ’ s mother and sister died in the murderous slaughter .
her father ruslan has since married and has a new wife swetlana , a little girl , that after losing her life he was kristina .

4 tips for better underwater photos and videos
if you would like to take photos or videos under water , there is a selection of devices .
the cheapest option is a watertight point-and-shoot , as the nikon coolpix aw120 or an action-cam like the gopro hero3 + silver edition , which is both for sale .
i took these photos at a family festival with several cameras , all at a price of under $ 350 .
regardless of the equipment , there are some rules for the best results .
check your equipment twice .
even if you have a waterproof camera , make sure that the battery compartment and other compartments are sealed .
also put your camera on the photos or videos you want to record .
some cameras and camcorder have scene and recording modes that allow the exposure to be reduced for the insulation of the damp underwater conditions .
and before you jump in , check to what depth your equipment is functional .
some cameras are only allowed for up to 5 feet , others up to 50 or 60 feet .
search our shopping guide and the reviews for digital cameras for conventional and waterproof models .
take multiple recordings - because many will not work .
point-and-shoot cameras have an lcd that lets you compose images , action-cam normally not .
even if you have an lcd , it is difficult to see this under water , and the right image setting is a matter of luck .
so you do a lot of shots .
if your camera has a row mode that allows you to capture a number of shots with slightly changed exposure settings , use it .
stay close to the surface .
the light becomes dramatically worse as it moves away from the surface .
so , if possible , they stay close to the surface when you take pictures in a pool , a lake or the sea .
this allows you to bring more color to your photos ; the deeper you go , the less color you will see .
go close to the objects .
this is good advice on land , but it is all the more important under water because of the poor light conditions .
it is particularly important when you are working with an action cam : these devices often have a fixed wide angle lens , which means that you can use poetry to approach your objects when they are in full range .
andrew lawson was a man of the variety whose character changes things , even in such a gigantic organization as the nhs .
as an anesthesist , he devoted his career to helping the sick to understand both the agony of the disease and the pain of treatment .
among his patients , his wife recalls , was a mi6 employee who was confronted with the devastating effects of torture .
lawson knew that doctors were not given the diagnosis and disease , while the treated surgery was mostly associated with something quite different : pain .
one day in 2007 , however , he was the one whose path of suffering began .
&quot; i did not feel , &quot; he wrote in may this year .
i had difficulty getting up .
while he was infected with flu symptoms , he noticed that he had injured his wife impatiently .
&quot; i want everything to be done immediately rather than later , &quot; he noted .
when juliet was on a business trip for a week , lawson felt quite unusual and unconcerned .
something lay in the air .
he asked a colleague to conduct an x-ray examination of his breast .
only two weeks ago he was in the french alps for skiing .
the results of the x-ray examination were available .
he suffered from mesothelioma , a incurable cancer that could cause the breast coat , that is , the skin that overloses the lungs .
as with most cancers , the exact trigger is usually difficult to determine .
for example , while some smokers are suffering from lung cancer , not all lung cancer patients have been smokers in the past .
but mesothelioma is different .
in almost all cases , the trigger is an asbestos load - contact with the fibre material , which was once considered a &quot; wonder material &quot; but has since been identified as deadly .
for most of us , mesotheliom is a disease that can be ignored as easily .
after all , asbestos is a product of the past .
the most dangerous type of asbestos has not been used in britain since the 1960s , when the industry voluntarily committed itself to no longer using it .
even where it was still used , only people in certain sectors worked directly with the fabric - plumber , construction workers , carpentry and shipyard workers , for example .
as an industrial hazardous material from another era , it seems today to be hardly worrying .
but this complacency is inappropriate .
britain , it seems , is now at the height of a mesotheliom epidemic .
there are more deaths from mesothelioma here than in any other country in the world .
with a total of 2,500 deaths per year , twice as many people die from this disease as they do in road accidents .
annual figures for mesothelioma deaths since 1980 and prospective future deaths in the uk
the reason we are now experiencing the deadly effects , even though asbestos has been illegal for years ( in 1999 all types of asbestos were banned ) , is that a mesotheliom only develops after decades .
and the scourge of the mesotheliom is not confined to former workers in the construction industry .
asbestos was , and is often still , present in the houses in which we live , the offices in which we work , the schools in which we learn and the shops in which we shop .
and therefore mesotheliom knows no class barriers , financial borders , professions or age .
the privileged bastions , from the elegant department stores in london to private schools , are not a protective space .
parliament buildings are contaminated by asbestos .
even in the hospitals , where we are supposed to be healthy , we are already starting to use this deadly carcinogenic gene .
andrew lawson was not old .
he was not a plumber either .
he was indeed finding it hard to imagine where he might be able to come into contact with asbestos .
then he found out .
&quot; it looks as if the tunnels at the guy &apos;s hospital , where i have spent six years of my training , are a lot of asbestos . &quot;
all - students , nurses , doctors and guardians - use the tunnels .
one wonders how many of my contemporaries will suffer from the same disease ?
unfortunately , he could at least partly answer that question .
&quot; of the four doctors who worked at guy &apos;s hospital , and the four in the last five years at mesothelioma , &quot; he wrote .
how many of us will be sick ?
at andrew lawson , mesotheliom was diagnosed at the age of 48 .
when he died on 17 february this year , he was 55 .
this was an unusually long lifetime .
fifty percent of all mesotheliose-rich diseases die within 8 months of diagnosis .
the disease always ends in death .
we can only repeat lawson &apos;s question : &apos; how many of us will be sick ? &apos;
britain ’ s leading expert on mesothelioma , professor julian peto , assumes that between 1870 and 2050 , when asbestopidgery is expected to stall in the uk , 90,000 will be .
most of them have no idea at the moment that they will die like that .

a brief look at the files of the courts , to which the people concerned often turn for claims for damages , shows how far the scourge of the mesotheliom is already widespread .
in june this year marks &amp; spencer , for example , admitted that janice was negligently exposed to asbestos .
she worked for the chain for nine years , from 1978 to 1987 and was responsible for the garment department at two locations , one of which is the flagship store at oxford street .
mrs. allen was only 18 years old when she began her work at m &amp; s .
now she has two children in the twenties .
&quot; before this thing , &quot; she says , &quot; i had never heard of mesotheliom , i didn &apos;t even know anything about asbestos .
i never thought that would concern me .
there are few people who know a lot about asbestos .
the fact is that the term asbestos is not a substance but a group of six minerals .
the name derives from the word &quot; asbestos &quot; , a description of the fibre structure that makes the fabric resistant and flexible .
three of the six were used in the construction industry .
chrysotil , also known as white asbestos , is by far the most common asbestos found in buildings today .
it was designed for roofing plates , flooring , rohrohal solations , boilersolidation , even for brake linings in cars .
it is less lethal than other forms of asbestos , but it is still regarded by the eu and the who as a &apos; major health risk &apos; with possible death consequences .
however , the brown asbestos ( amosit ) and the blue asbestos ( krokydolith ) are more dangerous .
britain was once the world ’ s largest importer of brown asbestos , and experts suspect that &quot; it has clear but indirect indications that this is a major reason for the uniquely high mesothelioma rates . &quot;
a marks-spencer employee was registered at the flagship store at oxford street , london , asbestos , alamy .
janice allen may not have been a typical mesotheliomopper , but the work of julian peto suggests that the time has not changed its history .
he has presented a study by the people concerned which shows that &apos; a significant proportion of mesotheliomas can be produced without known suspension by work or in the house presumably by asbestos contact in the environment &apos; .
he said that a large part of these contacts is based on the &quot; normal use and aging &quot; of our buildings .
it looks as if no one can assume that they are safe .
a report by goddard consulting , which describes the palace of westminster , shows how people live in the heart of the government , unknowingly exposed to the substance .
in 2009 , goddard reported that the service pits and pipelines were behind parliament &apos;s committee rooms contaminated with asbestos , whose deadly fibres were replaced by something as harmless as &quot; strong air movements &quot; .
members of parliament are often accused of caring for their own interests , but it seems that this is the opposite .
while the parliamentary labour service directorate insisted that the westminster palace should be a &apos; clean health certificate &apos; , it is now undisputed that 1 billion £ of work is spent over several years .
the goddard report also pointed out that &apos; the presence of asbestos cannot be handled in accordance with the relevant provisions &apos; .
no one can know whether this mismanagement will cost lives .
all that can be done now is wait .
a person who never knows exactly what to do with asbestos is graham abbott , a general practitioner .
as andrew lawson suggests , the 50-year-old abbott suspects that he was exposed to asbestos during his work in hospitals .
&quot; i have worked in a hospital where asbestos complaints were decided positively , &quot; he says , &quot; but i can not prove it in my case .
it is so difficult to remember where you worked .
what he remembers is exactly the day at the beginning of december 2009 , when he was getting a kind of fever .
he was 45 and was just carrying out an operation late in the evening .
suddenly i had a shake .
it happened all of a sudden .
i felt horrible .
i thought the trip home could not be created any more .
as a doctor , abbott knew that the pain was caused by the chest coat , the skin around his lungs .
but , like janice all , he had no reason to suspect a mesotheliom .
he did not go to work for a month .
surprised doctors turned x-ray shots of his breast and put peurakathether to remove liquids from the lungs and to use them in the laboratory .
however , his complaints remained undiagnosed .
his health improved slowly , and he returned to his job .
from time to time , however , the symptoms returned , often after physical activity and violent breathing .
in 2011 , a patient abbott with similar symptoms came into practice and was diagnosed later with mesotheliom .
but even now abbott did not associate this with his own case .
after all , his patient was a few decades older and had worked directly with asbestos .
the link in the case was clear .
in september 2011 , abbott ’ s state deteriorated again , and his family doctor brought his ct scans and x-ray recordings to a group of experts .
in december 2011 , exactly two years after abbott felt ill for the first time , a new camera equipped with a camera was launched into the cave between the rib and the breast coat .
i am an optimist .
i usually just continue , &quot; he says .
to be honest , i had not been so worried .
but rachel , my wife , was concerned .
the result of the biopsie was between christmas and new year : &quot; i was told that it was mesothelioma &quot; .
graham abbott : diagnosis mesothelioma
suddenly , abbott had appointments with macmillan nurses , one of whom recommended him to seek a lawyer .
only now did he understand the extent of the epidemic .
&quot; asbestos was found to be very widespread , especially in large public buildings where tubes are often insulated with asbestos , &quot; he says .
the people who are exposed to asbestos in these buildings are now suffering .
and thus mesotheliom is now hitting younger people who have not worked in typical professions .
the most dangerous pipes with asbestos insulation in hospitals were located below ground , so patients were probably not exposed to the substance .
but many people who work in pedestrian tunnels from one building to another ( like andrew lawson ) or underground car parks , have to eat and drink at the bar .
it is evident that , over several decades after the war , hospitals may have been life-saving for patients , but they are life-threatening for the doctors who treat them .
it is still being removed today .
students put their bunsenburners on asbestos mats .
it does not just concern hospitals .
asbestos was developed for its fabulous insulating and flame retardants in offices , shops , libraries and city halls .
schools , too , are involved .
indeed , many people may have found the first asbestos contact in the classroom .
throughout the country , in thousands of chemical-class hours , students have tested their bunsenburners on asbestos mats .
on websites , the topic of asbestos is now often addressed in schools .
meanwhile , innocent objects in our houses , such as flooring panels or dandy bags , have included asbestos by default .
&quot; it is an industrial poison that is present in large parts of our real estate , &quot; remarked andrew morgan , the lawyer , andrew lawson in his trial against guy &apos;s hospital .
in one case , the only contact that fell to a woman affected was the demolition of a garden shed in the 1970s .
so make sure you take your garden scales off .
the effects of diagnosis , and the knowledge that the disease is incurable , are immense .
&quot; it takes a while to process this , &quot; says graham abbott .
i went back to work and tried to continue , but i realized that i was not focusing on what i was doing .
i was in practice for two weeks .
then i knew that i would go and have to care for myself .
well , i will not see another christmas .
the greatest difficulty was the change of perspective from a doctor ’ s position to a patient ’ s position .
like countless patients before him , he remembers how overwhelmed he was by all the information with which he had to cope .
&quot; it was very difficult to take all this in , &quot; he says .
&quot; i asked my doctor &quot; how long do i have ? &quot;
and they gave me about 12 months .
i remember that i thought &quot; well , i will not be another christmas .
that was then . &apos;
mesothelioma is particularly insidious because it is our life-support mechanism - breathing itself - that causes the deadly cancer .
most cases of mesothelioma are caused by asbestos contact .
asbestos consists of smallest fibres .
if the asbestos is washed up and the fibres are inhaled , they can be spread in the chest coat , the skin around the lungs .
asbestos fibers irritate the chest and can trigger cell mutations .
&quot; the problem arises with the inhaled needle-shaped asbestos fibres , &quot; says professor tom treasure , a heart thorax doctor who sent the guy &apos;s hospital in 2001 .
the hospital that andrew lawson suspects is in charge of asbestos is now ironic .
treasure knew lawson and treated some others who probably also had to be in hospital during their training in the hospital .
once the asbestos needles reach the lung tissue , says treasure , &quot; they will be pushed to the edge of the respiratory process where the skin is .
it is inherently invasive from the very beginning .
the usual options for other cancers in mesotheliom are not so good .
the effectiveness of an operation , for example , is highly controversial .
some say that it is worth trying .
treasure denies that .
&quot; you can &apos;t cut the chest coat out , &quot; he says .
you don &apos;t get around with the knife .
meanwhile , cancer is &quot; not very good at chemotherapy , &quot; the &quot; effect &quot; is not healing .
&quot; sometimes there are long-time survivors , &quot; says treasure .
but in the end they all die .
fortunately , some patients actually live long , much longer than expected .
the author stephen jay gould died 20 years after diagnosis .
two and a half years after his own diagnosis , graham abbott is still fighting .
after contacting mesotheliom , abbott came into contact with andrew lawson , who was a one-man of the same name four years after his diagnosis .
&quot; hello , cancer center , &quot; he was happy to answer calls .
&quot; he was very positive , &quot; says abbott .
he had received his diagnosis 4 years earlier and was still very active .
originally , abbott was six chemotherapy cycles that took four months and are likely to be around a month longer .
&quot; i was desperate , &quot; he says .
i wanted to give up .
however , lawson managed to &quot; do things in a more positive light . &quot;
after consulting several doctors , abbott decided to continue his treatment with prof. loic lang-lazdunski , cardio-thorax specialist at guy &apos;s .
&quot; we had an advantage by not having to be redirected , i just called and got a date , &quot; gives graham to .
a normal patient would have to be remittanded and wait for the treatment to be approved .
money is crucial to mesotheliom sufferers in order to perceive the best available therapies .
but , when these treatments inevitably fail , many people are left with another financial concern - over which the future of families is at stake .
and so you turn to the courts in the hope of compensation .
andrew lawson contacted andrew morgan of field fisher waterhouse llp .
&quot; it has been known since 1898 that asbestos is extremely dangerous for health , &quot; says morgan .
but what changed in the 1960s was that it was recognized that a very small burden was a health risk , too .
and this is where the negligence of companies began to play a role .
andrew lawson and guy &apos;s hospital finally set their case , but it was not what morgan had called a &quot; fully-fledged compensation &quot; , as lawson was not with absolute certainty .
after the investigation into his death , a spokesman of guy confirmed that &quot; the asbestos fibres in the cellar area affected were removed in the 1990 &apos;s . &quot;
this was too late for andrew lawson .
how to remove asbestos
indeed , it is not easy for mesotheliom sufferers who seek compensation , a huge problem , the deadly asbestos contact of a company or a job - usually decades after the events .
many of their former employers have been sold or closed .
insurance documents may be lost .
and those who oppose claims know that time is for them to do so , but certainly not with the plaintiffs .
in response , there have been clear new legislation this year , which could make it easier for people affected by mesotheliom to claim compensation , even though their former employers could no longer be found .
the law has approved a fund of eur 350 million for all , supported by the insurance industry , for all diagnosed after july 2012 , to be able to prove a contact , but cannot sue anyone .
in these cases , the plaintiffs receive 80 % of what a court would have agreed to them in a normal compensation process - about £ 120,000 .
about 300 successful applications for the programme are expected per year .
andrew morgan thinks like so many mesotheliom sufferers that £ 350 million is a &quot; very good job &quot; of the insurance industry .
&quot; this is a deal for insurers , &quot; he says , and suggests that it is a deal for insurers .
mike penning , then working and pension minister , admitted that the law &quot; is not perfect &quot; .
but both penning and morgan admitted that , with seven deaths , a rapid response is needed every day .
&quot; people are suffering so much and need help today , &quot; said penning during the second hearing of the mesotheliom law in december last year .
at that time , graham abbott was in the hands of prof. loic lang-lazdunski for 19 months .
after their first consultations lang-lazdunski recommended an operation that , unlike tom treasury , would have a positive impact .
this was done by radiation therapy and chemotherapy - a triple therapy that was used to treat long-lazdunski for survival over five years from up to 40 % .
abbott felt stronger .
&quot; this is of course with the most important , &quot; says abbott .
this is something that patients always see .
there is something that will allow you to continue .
if you give up , you will get worse very quickly .
graham abbott underwent the operation in march 2012 .
at the end of august he had the last of the six chemotherapy cycles behind him .
the after-care scanning showed no sign of the disease .
then in march 2014 i had a scan .
there were several cancer spots around my breast .
i have just been 50 .
that is not life-threatening .
that is life-ending .
abbott underwent six chemotherapy cycles again .
now there is no trace of tumors visible .
but the process is very hard and physically demanding .
they must think about practical things - about money , if i am no longer , for example , or my wife show how the boiler time setting works .
if you receive bad news , you will be negative .
they must look forward .
as ellie &apos;s father , 16 , and tamsin , 14 , this is not always easy .
&quot; for parents , it is difficult , &quot; he says .
it is difficult to know what to say and how much .
when i was first diagnosed , i told my girl that i had a disease that i would not be old .
they responded in a very different way .
tamsin is very sociable and unstinting .
she told her friends and we soon got a lot of calls .
ellie was more cautious .
she did not say much .
such talks are something that all cancer patients must go through .
but for mesotheliose-rich diseases , such talks have not been hopeless , not a trace of hope of survival .
the disease ( as in the end stephen jay gould ) brings a grim security .
as andrew morgan says , &quot; mesotheliom is not life-threatening .

china is denying hong kong the right to vote in government , demonstrators swear retaliation , and the country is retributing .
on sunday , despite the increased calls for democratic reforms , the chinese parliament decided against nominating candidates for the 2017 elections by hong kong &apos;s electorate .
this approach probably fights the long-announced protests in hong kong ’ s district , while activists are making planning and mobilisation in the space of a few hours after the announcement .
the decision of the chinese people ’ s congress allows the communist leaders to impose on all non-peking-loyal candidates in principle .
&quot; this is not unexpected , but it makes us angry , &quot; said legal expert emily lau , chairman of the democratic party .
that is not what beijing had promised .
hong kong residents have been lied to .
and it is clear that we are dealing with an authoritarian regime .
in his defense of china ’ s decision , li fei , deputy secretary general of the standing committee of the national people ’ s congress , said that the approval of public nominations in the hong kong government ’ s elections would be chaotic .
since 1997 , when britain took control of hong kong back to the chinese , beijing has promised to protect the residents from the government presidency from 2017 .
the chinese leadership presented sunday ’ s decision as a democratic breakthrough , because it offered hong kong ’ s citizens a direct right to vote , but the decision also demonstrates that china ’ s leaders are watching the process through a closely controlled beijing nomination .
moreover , a new clause only states that candidates should be &quot; with love for the country and love for hong kong &quot; .
the decision follows a summer in which some of the largest and most public-minded protests in hong kong have taken place for a number of years .
behind the pro-democracy campaign in hong kong is the occupy central movement with love and peace , whose organizers have threatened to do so .
on sunday evening , within hours of the announcement , hundreds of occupy centers were in the process of re-opening the doors of the government headquarters in hong kong .
at the demonstration , the organizers said that their movement had set up a new stage of civil disobedience and that in the coming weeks they were planning waves of protest .
however , you did not give any further details , apparently to avoid problems with the authorities .
in an online communication , the organizers announced that the movement &quot; the occupation of the central district only as a last resort , has taken action that can only take place if the entire dialogue process is fully exploited .
we are sorry to say that today all the opportunities for dialogue have been exhausted and the occupation of the central district has definitely taken place .
the hong kong authorities have been waiting for days for the beijing announcement and it was on sunday that the government building was tightened up , including police forces and barricades .
the unrest is being exacerbated by the feeling of many in hong kong that they are slowly losing control of their city .
the influx of people from the mainland increases competition for products and services .
there is also a growing fear that hong kong ’ s values , such as democracy and freedom of speech , will crumble under the growing pressure from beijing .
some criticized the demonstrations by the occupy-central-movement , because they were not able to control the business - the lifeline of hong kong .
&quot; the protests they speak of could cause great economic damage , depending on how many are involved and how long they last , &quot; said legal sex minister .
we do not want to fuel fears that hong kong will get out of control .
this impression is bad for investment .
china ’ s state-controlled media recently reported on the pro-democracy activists in hong kong as being held by western powers .
this summer , activists organised an unofficial referendum on electoral rights , which involved 780,000 people - more than a fifth of the electorate in hong kong .
in july , tens of thousands took part in one of the greatest demonstrations of democracy in the history of the region .
the tradition of school leaving balls in the us is now being transferred to universities , where freshmen are offering private aircraft .
we are looking forward to being able to respond to this demand and to be able to offer the first luxury uk travel service for students of today .
to make a particularly impressive appearance at the university , the company also offers transportation options such as private aircraft , rolls-royce phantom , aston marten or mclaren p1 .
mr stewart also stated that the service has a security section .
this service is an ideal alternative for students who would otherwise like to spend their time in a dangerously overloaded car .
together with our new vif options , we look forward to ensuring this year that students will be able to study the university with a minimum of effort and a maximum of luxury .
a corporate spokesman said that no new bookings had yet been made , since the service was only just introduced , but added that &quot; students will be able to use the service in the next few weeks &quot; .
the company also announced that despite the study fees of £ 9,000 per year , there was a market for this offer .
students today differ very much in their expectations and expectations from students before 10 , 20 , 30 or 40 years ago - it is more important than ever to make a great first impression , and with vif you can do just that .
the national student union , however , criticised the service as being abrogated .
megan dunn , vice president of nus for higher education said : &quot; this offer seems completely separate from the lives of most students .
many students who begin their studies this month are facing a crisis in the cost of living , as the available financial assistance in the form of loans and scholarships is not linked to the soaring invoices for the simplest basic life .
feminists criticize racial and police behavior in ferguson
the unarmed teenager was killed by a police officer in ferguson , mon . earlier this month .
the participants lifted their hands in the air and sang , &quot; hands up , did not shoot , &quot; while they waited before the funeral .
after two weeks of protests in ferguson , mo , because of the shooting of the unarmed teenager michael brown , the blogger miriam zoila perez noticed a change in online discussions .
in their experience , white feminist commentators put the sex before the race to avoid reproductive rights and income inequality .
but , while tensions in the middle west have risen and been heeded throughout the country , perez saw that the responses of white women were 100 % racial .
compared with the responses of black women shortly after the shots of 9 august , personal essays came with titles such as &quot; thoughts to ferguson by a white woman &quot; and &quot; feminism is not just about oppression .
but for perez , this meant an important change .
&quot; i do not think that feminism can find many people who are above the knowledge and have privileges in such a high-class way , &quot; she said .
people felt pushed to add to what happened .
it is characteristic of the crisis we are in and because the situation in ferguson is so ethnically based that you have to say so .
for professor koritha mitchell of the ohio state university , ferguson brought to light problems that black americans have been exposed to every day , but which are not known as women &apos;s issues .
&quot; i can find something funny on facebook about me and my partner and get 150 likes from anywhere , &quot; said mitchell .
if i post something about how coloured people in their own country are under siege , the silence is ear-stunned .
&quot; how can it be safe for women to talk publicly about a relationship , but not about security in public space ? &quot; she asked .
for black women like mitchell , the race , sex and sexuality in the history of the us , there is no dichotomy between racial and gender problems .
for them , black women have not had the luxury of clearing the issues clean ; they live in the combined reality every day .
while white women are now discussing the issues of race and gender in the feminist mainstream , angela hattery , professor of women and gender , says that women are not only women but also men .
&quot; between 1865 and 1890 , at least 10,000 black men were yellow and the justification was almost always the rape of a white woman , &quot; said hattery .
white women had to be involved in history in order to justify lynchmurder .
for hattery , the division between white and black women came at the point where white fighters for women ’ s electoral law , such as susan b. anthony , were able to analyze the country in the late nineteenth century , and not so .
&quot; they made the decision to stand up for women &apos;s voting rights , and the right to vote for blacks should come later , &quot; said hattery .
if you remember such things , you are fully aware of why colourful women do not trust white women .
we did not do our job well .
we have never helped black women to be their husbands and sons .
even after women were given the right to vote in 1920 , it took a decade for white women to fight lynch in the association of southern india .
the group was established almost 40 years after the original request for help from black women , says mitchell .
for mitchell , the flood of white feminist reactions to the issues raised by ferguson - police behaviour , racial discrimination - is a mirror of the time when white feminists were caught &apos; .
&quot; would it not be great if the activists who have such traditional feminist platforms had the right to education of a child so seriously ?
second-generation feminists who have stepped up their careers in the struggle for reproductive rights and access to contraceptive aids are now trying to understand what that means .
the well-known white feminist activist gloria steinen went to the united states two weeks after michael brown shot and published a new pocket for the german rebec .
&quot; i hope that women who have a different but parallel reason to follow a physical path inherent in the body - and have opinions on race , which is in public polls much different - will understand the changes .
although stones are more of an intersectional feminism in which race as well as gender issues are addressed , some of your comments on racial issues are in america .
christina sommer , researcher at the american enterprise institute and author of &quot; who stale feminism ? &quot; said to her the people of the united states that young men are in the united states , especially young farbies .
there are now hundreds of special programmes for girls and young women , but almost nothing for boys .
but when the white house recently launched a small program , my brother &apos;s keeper , to prevent vulnerable young black and hispanic men , there were annoying reactions from many feminists who included him .
the police relations with the black community are not the only problem that has become the main theme of mainstream feminism .
after the us border police have killed nearly 63,000 unaccompanied minors on the country &apos;s south-west border this year , the issue of immigration reform is also coming back to the surface - this time as a women &apos;s issue .
andrea mercado , co-chairman of we belong together , an organisation that supports women in the immigration reform , said that for a new approach to the issue of immigration as an essential female element , it is only a women &apos;s issue .
&quot; they speak for themselves , &quot; said mercado .
if the vast majority of working visas go to male immigrants , women who have accompanied them are in a position to be able to work for domestic residents .
&quot; these stories are a lasting feature of women &apos;s organisations , &quot; she said .
&quot; schweine-haus &quot; in ipswich is available for sale in the uk .
the image of a house for sale was removed by real estate agents when it became clear that it showed a big pork that it made comfortable in the living room .
the detached house has one bedroom , located on a private road in ipswich and is offered for 120,000 £ .

in the exposure of the house , connells described the former assembly house as a &quot; unique one-family house with one bedroom . &quot;
although the broker removed the image from the website , it still appears on advertising material .
the sale of the house was of interest in the social media when some asked whether the pig was included in the purchase price .

leonidas asked for a visit to the gladiator arena in the city of gladesh .
not only the gladiators were ankle deep in the matsch at the first rhineland roman day in the amusement park .
but the attraction of the event was strong enough to attract more than 1000 visitors yesterday who were able to see the showers and the autumn cold .
there was a colorful series of representations , performances , games , exhibitions and information about the time of the romans and their importance for the rhineland .
the main attraction of the day was undoubtedly the martial fighter force of the gladiator school &quot; amor mortis &quot; , which was responsible for every rainy break to be found in the soft sand with soft sand .
gladiator owners &quot; leonidas &quot; proved humorous and knowledgeable presenter and sent descendants in the ring to the heroic two-fight in various gladiators .
first , the &quot; provocators &quot; were in turn equipped with a rectangle shield and short sword as well as leg rail on the left leg and arm rail on the right arm .
the &quot; essedarii &quot; followed with a breast shield , short sword and litter lance as well as an iron gladiator helmet , leg and armguard .
the appearance of the &quot; retiarius &quot; , which was connected with the throwing net , the triangle and the dagger against the &quot; secutor &quot; and after a short fight the boys came to the floor .
the swords clammed metallic , the shields shepherd and the cutlans flew through the arena surrendering to a fear and fear that could be around the health of the diglae .
but to which the imposing &quot; summa rudis &quot; , the muscular referee , had always had a careful eye .
&quot; we wanted to revive the everyday life of rome and to experience the culture of the roman era , &quot; explained lorenz euskirchen , chairman of the &quot; freundeskreis römerkanal &quot; organizer , who .
after two years of preparation , the park became a &quot; oppidum romanum &quot; for one day , a roman city , as vice mayor claus wehage in his greeting word .
after all , the romans have not only brought war and conquest in our region , but also the roman culture and numerous buildings that we still admire today .
the remains of this were also to be admired at the roman day , such as &quot; aqueduct marble &quot; from the eleven meters high and 1400 meters long roman canal bridge that was once built at lueftelberg .
the frontinus society once provided water and energy supplies , and now , and managing director petra fricke knew : &quot; we are still benefiting from the knowledge of then &quot; .
this is confirmed by ralph heiliger ’ s diploma surveying engineer from the “ engineering team zwei ” from rheinbach , the measuring instruments of the romans such as chorobat , groma or dioptra .
the villa of the romans in blankenheim presented sketches and models of the excavations anno 1894 and bricks from the original hypocauste , the hot air heaters , which were once the romans .
impressive also the footprints of wolf and fuchs two millennia ago in the footsteps of sound .
in 2011 , the national association of the rhineland region had commissioned the office for soil preservation to preserve the remains of a roman villa in the north industrial park in rheinbach .
they have built walls of an economic building with a darr to dry grain and mill .
the building probably led to a villa rustica , an agricultural estate , explained the archaeologist dr. jennifer morschiser .
a number of finds from these excavations were found in a glass glass glass glass glass glass glass glass glass glass glass glass glass tank , several fine glass vessels and parts of a small necklace .
the villa was built in the 18th century and was built in the early 18th century .
it also involved the children with the roman windmill game , similar to the current mill game , or they wrote as the roman pupils used to use metal grips on wax panels .
at the römerthermen zülpich the children were allowed to lay mosaics themselves , at the stand of the glass museum rheinbach glass mosaics and to stand at the eifel weittersheifel nature centre .
with the coated original wine drawn by two cold-blossom faithfully reconstructed roman trolleys , visitors were able to visit the park and also the impressive stand of the municipal gymnasium &quot; , which was here .
with a week of rome from 13th to 21st september , the wachtberg municipality will also be part of the römerjahr 2014 , which is reminiscent of the death of emperor augustus 2000 years ago .
together with the local and historical associations and the wachtberger wander-verein , the partnership association and the amusement park of oberbach , among other things , thematic hikes , a lecture , lectures and conferences are offered .
for example , a roman legionnaire is excluded from his work on the wachtberg , but plants are seen as living monuments from the roman era and a funny lesson in the subject of international understanding .
the adendorf primary school is dedicated to the romans theme during a project week .
the romans week is intended to bring the many , but often no longer visible , traces of the romans in wachtberg back to life .
the wachtberger city hall will present a small presentation to the fund of the berkumer matronenheilty in 1879 .
ebola : the epidemic is burdening west africa ’ s economy
the ebola epidemic in west africa is also a severe blow to the economy .
markets are orphaned - and international companies are distancing themselves .
the devastating ebola epidemic is giving west africa &apos;s economy a heavy blow .
the harvest is rotated in fields , mines have been abandoned and markets are orphaned - the virus has been a major source of infection in the region .
some international companies are also already distancing themselves .
&quot; the ebola epidemic is not only a medical crisis , but also an economic one , &quot; the african development bank chief donald kaberuka judges .
liberia is hardest hit
&quot; it is a total disaster , we lose a lot of money , &quot; says alhaji bamogo , who is on the second largest market in liberia &apos;s capital , monrovia .
only those who have food or something to disinfect ebola will come onto the market .
liberia is the hardest hit by the virus , alone here fell the fever more than 600 people .
recently , health authorities said that the disease had spread to every corner of the country .
in guinea , sierra leone and nigeria , too , the virus has spread .
in total , more than 1500 people have died , thousands more have contacted .
foreign firms are relocating workers
throughout resource-rich countries , firms are running .
foreign companies like the arcelor mittal steel group are withdrawing their employees , several international airlines are no longer flying to the affected regions .
local traders and farmers are also reacting : few merchants are leaving their homes to buy supplies .
in some areas of sierra leone and liberia , which are quarantine , rots , among other things , the cocoa and coffee industries that are important for export , on the fields .
farmers dare not buy their homes for the harvest .
food is scarce
&quot; people are going to travel less and less , &quot; says phillipe de vreyer , an expert in the economy of west africa .
for example , the man who normally goes to the market and sells his vegetables is better off at home .
the population is therefore directly and urgently receiving the consequences of the epidemic : food is becoming scarce .
in the markets , the supply of basic foodstuffs such as rice is disappearing .
at the same time , the region that is highly dependent on international companies is threatening to damage its image , with far-reaching consequences .
the greatest danger is that international companies will generally avoid the area for a long time , says philippe hugon of french think tank iris .
the decisive factor is how far and how long the virus will spread .
investors may have the impression that it is dangerous to invest in guinea , sierra leone and liberia and thus invest in it , ” commented hugon .
the disease also burdens the strained national budgets of the states .
the disease also burdens the already hard-pressed national budgets of the states concerned .
the credit rating agency moody &apos;s fears that its budgets will be heavily affected by the high expenditure on the health system and , in addition , by the worsening economy .
the african development bank has already promised to provide 60 million dollars ( $ 45 million ) to the health systems of the countries concerned .
the effects are already noticeable in nigeria , where so far only a few ebola cases have been diagnosed .
while the oil-rich region in the southern niger delta has not been affected .
but elsewhere , many people are already left behind for fear of contagion .
reservations in hotels are also decreasing significantly .

the &quot; tannenwald &quot; amber association celebrates its 50-year anniversary of its founding from 12 to 14 september .

the chapel is the berngau blascapelle .
the patronage of the town was given by mayor wolfgang wild and secretary of state albert füracker .
the original name &quot; schützengesellschaft tannenwald berngau &quot; dates from 1907 , when the association for &quot; social entertainment by means of exercise in room nursing and small calibre shooting &quot; was founded on 21 march .
the nazi regime had led the dissolution of the association in 1937 .
only in 1964 did 19 young men find themselves in the guesthouse lukas on 30 april , who were invited to the &quot; new &quot; schützenverein &quot; pannenwald &quot; berngau .
karl marz and adolf ried led the association as champion of the sport through a difficult early period , mainly in order to form a club venue and to promote the shooting operation .
the schützenverein in gasthaus &quot; leininger &quot; started its first race in the lap competitions in autumn 1965 .
in the following years , sports shooters , who are now organized into seven teams , established themselves in all classes up to the 1st gauliga .
the club records are recorded annually and the magic border of 380 rings was first established in 1980 by rudi meier .
as the performance of the active shooters has increased , the membership numbers have also developed positively .
after the club &quot; leininger &quot; no longer meets the requirements of a modern shooters association , the dax group has become a member of the executive board under the leadership of johann rinn .
after a workload of 2700 hours , pfarrer straßer , the 8th of may 1988 , awarded the church blessing for the new protective rooms .
one of the great highlights in the club history was certainly the 44th gaulle , connected with the solemn consecration of the new flag of shooting in july 1991 .
on 23 and 24 april 1994 the schützenverein celebrated its 30th anniversary .
in 1995 , a böllergroup was founded .
josef schmalzl became böllerrechner .
a great challenge for the &quot; böller-&quot; and for the association as a whole was the orientation of the bavarian böllertreffen 2005 .
in many hours of volunteering work , the club members have visited the premises and the shooting facility at the berngauer hof and have thus updated the technology .
eleven teams in round competitions
the sports performance of the schützenverein can also be seen .
a total of eleven teams are currently participating in the round competitions : six air rifle teams , a team of air guns , a sports gun k1 , a youth team and two ah teams .

the second team with verena moosburger alexandra meier , eva schuhmann and tobias graml has moved from gauliga nord to gauoberliga .
besides the shooting sport , events such as bocksteaks , carnival and royal ball , club outing and christmas celebrations have a tradition .
the shooters are also present at the festivals in parish and community .

nato does not want to enter into agreements with russia
nato is being strengthened by the planned deployment in eastern europe as a result of the ukraine crisis .
nato secretary general anders fogh rasmussen said on monday in brussels that nato is following the founding agreement of the nato russia council in 1997 .
nato ’ s chief , however , accused russia of “ a sharp break ” of the agreement .

the russian documents and opinions show that &quot; you are not against us &quot; .
stronger nato presence

merkel speaks the word of power : toll will come &quot; very clearly &quot;
now the chancellor is clearly declaring herself to be in favour of this .
a carte blanche for all the complicated details is not .
persistent concerns from the cdu about car tolls have pushed the csu to the fore .
chancellor angela merkel has , following ongoing resistance from her cdu , given a powerful word for the introduction of a car toll .
&quot; to be quite clear , it is in the coalition treaty and it will come , &quot; said the party leader on monday after the cdu-top meetings of the berlin cdu .
merkel , however , did not agree on a detailed model for the time being .
in the black and red government programme , &apos; certain parameters &apos; are mentioned .
federal transport minister alexander dobrindt ( csu ) made a proposal and we are now working on it .
the nrw-cdu , however , insists on its &apos; no &apos; to a toll on all roads .
merkel stressed that finance minister wolfgang schäuble ( cdu ) is also constructively involved in the deliberations on a bill .
in addition to the subject , he has also talked about other ways of making more private capital available for investment in infrastructure , such as broadband .
&quot; there is nothing special about it &quot; schäuble had a &quot; mirror &quot; report uncommented on sunday , his house is examining a concept to build motorway investors with toll revenues .
csu-chef horst seehofer warned that he would not use toll concepts in the cabinet against the lead minister .
cdu bundesvize armin laschet reaffirmed his objections .
&quot; the coalition agreement never assumed that all district and federal roads would be tolled , &quot; said the north rhine-westphalian cdu head of state .
in this respect , it is an important signal that seehofer has now announced that it will be discussing the issue again .
resistance to the plans is also expressed by the cdu provincial federations baden-württemberg and rheinland-palatinate .
the background is fears that tolls will make it difficult for small border traffic to be crossed with neighbouring countries .
due to the toll criticism from ranks of the cdu coalition , seehofer had demanded adherence to coalition .
the left sees the plans as a failed state in the face of the dispute in the union .
&quot; the murks toll is dead , &quot; said party leader bernd riexinger of the &quot; new osnabrücker zeitung &quot; ( monday ) .
&quot; the toll is the minister &apos;s failure , &quot; dobrindt wants to introduce a vignette duty on all german roads , which is to start in 2016 .
domestic car owners may , however , not be charged any additional according to the coalition agreement .
therefore , they should be able to obtain a full compensation for tolls through the vehicle tax .
the model must not , however , discriminate against foreign drivers on the basis of eu law because of their nationality .
genetic disorder is often misdiagnosed
a british person says that she thought that as a result of a misdiagnosis over many years she would die .
karin rodgers lived almost all of their youth in the belief that they had only a few years to live after being diagnosed with another disease .
she actually suffered from the charco-marie-tooth disease ( cmt ) - a group of inherited disorders that caused nerves outside the brain and spinal cord .
charity cmt uk announced that misdiagnosis is a common problem for people with cmt because so little about this disease .
some 23,000 people in britain are likely to suffer from cmt , which may lead to motor disorders such as muscle weakness , insecure gear and curved toes .
sufferers also suffer from taubheitsgestaltung or pain , the disease is incurable and progressive , which means that the symptoms become worse over time .
when rodgers was 13 , she believed that she was interested in a peaceful ataxie ( fa ) - a disease with very poor survival chances .
rodgers thought she would be sitting in the wheelchair before she was 18 , and before her 30th birthday .
the mother of two children , who is 51 years old today , said : &apos; as a child i knew i could not do the same as the others .
i was constantly falling down and everything took longer .
i could never ride with the other children roller skateboard or skateboard and was often in school because of my kind to go and run .
rodgers said that at the age of 13 , after several operations to relieve their achilles and stretch their feet , they were carrying out their medical acts when their doctor left the room and read that they had been .
&quot; i felt guilty because i was curious , so i did not tell anyone about it , but i went to my home , looking for the disease in the library and screened to the fac-society , &quot; he said .
when i received an answer , i was shocked and panicked .
i thought i was in a wheelchair at 18 and dying at 25 , and in between i would slowly lose all my abilities .
i made all this with me alone and planned my own funeral .
she said when she was 17 , she realized that her abilities were not so much reduced as she would have liked and questioned her doctor .
he stood up and hugged me and said , &quot; my love , i do not think you have that , otherwise you are already in the wheelchair . &quot;
i think you have something far less life-threatening .
after some genetic tests , it was found in cmt .
&quot; when he told me what cmt was , i felt as if i were a winner , &quot; she said .
charity cmt uk has developed a cmt-awareness month to help you respond to this disease .
the company is based in düsseldorf , germany .

tax burden on businesspeople in the washington area is rising with economic recovery .

state and local tax returns for companies in the country increased slightly last year , while economic recovery accelerated , so a newly published study in the past week , and firms in the area of washington made no exception .
companies in the district , maryland and virginia jointly paid $ 27.6 billion to government and local authorities in the financial year 2013 , an increase of 3.8 percent over the revenues of 2012 of 26.6 billion .
the government and local tax burden on businesses increased by 4.3 % last year to $ 671 billion , compared to 3.9 % in the year before , and it was the third consecutive year after the several years of declining .
government taxes rose more than local taxes to $ 4.3 % , according to the study carried out by the service agency .
more than half of district tax revenue , 56 percent , comes from corporate taxes , while 36 percent of maryland ’ s income comes from businesses .
virginia generates the lowest tax revenue from companies , accounting for 28 percent .
much of the increase in tax revenues is due to a recovery in the real estate values of companies , researchers say , which has led to an increase in real estate taxes by 3.7 % this year after the three consecutive years of growth rates of 1 .
while much of these gains come from large states such as california , new york , and texas , the process seems to be similar for washington .
district , maryland , and virginia jointly paid over $ 10 billion in government and local real estate taxes last year , compared to $ 9.6 billion in 2012 .
but the apparent recovery in real estate values is not as effective in increasing government and local government taxes .
companies in virginia and d.c. pay almost half of their government and local taxes in the form of real estate taxes .
&quot; in maryland , the following is happening : a large proportion of real estate , especially in the tax area around d.c. , is owned either by the government or by non-profit organizations that do not pay real estate taxes , &quot; said douglas lindholm .
maryland is therefore forced to focus much more on income taxes , for example , in order to provide the same services that other states offer .
the recent recovery in corporate tax revenues cannot be attributed to the recovery of the housing market alone .
corporate income also seems to be recovering , so the data .
companies in the region reported income taxes at state organizations of 2.3 billion $ compared to 2.1 billion in the year 2012 .
maryland invested $ 1 billion in corporate income taxes , the region ’ s highest amount .
while the trend is heading in the same direction , the local tax burden on businesses is not rising evenly in all three places .
the increase in the district was 4.3 percent , corresponding to the national average , while the maryland increase was significantly higher , 4.9 percent .
only virginia reported an under-average tax revenue of 4.1 percent .
virginia has achieved a significantly lower level of corporate income taxes ( in all three areas of its mandate ) , with 6 percent of all three .
the company tax rate in maryland is 8.25 percent and the district is relatively high at 9.975 percent .
a similar study by the us chamber of commerce earlier this year showed that lower government and local taxes were incurred in virginia and that overall , there is a better tax climate than in maryland .
the study did not examine the district .
despite the advantages , virginia is under pressure from its southern neighbour .
north carolina has laws to reduce its corporate tax rates this year from 6.9 percent to 6 percent , the same rate as virginia , and the rate will be reduced to 5 percent next year .
if the government continues to meet its income targets next year , this law could reduce the state ’ s corporate income tax rate to 3 % by 2017 .
in the meantime , small businesses in the area of washington seem to be doing better , and they are therefore paying more government and local taxes , according to the latest study .
corporate taxes , which are used as personal income taxes by small businessmen - a transitional structure that most small businesses are organized into - in the district , maryland , and virginia rose by 20 % last year by 20 % to 2.4 % .
researchers say that the trend and the rise in corporate taxes across the country is likely to continue this year , with an increase in the general level of surplus tax revenue for the state and local governments by 6.2 % in the first quarter .
yet washington may be lagging behind if the spending cuts of the federal government were to affect the labor market in the region .
partner city : german beer for guangzhou
hops and malt - also in china a popular combination .
german beer enjoys an excellent reputation in china .
frankfurt ’ s partner city in china now wants a brewery and hopes to have a direct flight connection between the two cities .
german beer , used in frankfurt ’ s partner city guangzhou – this is the urgent desire of the officials in china .
&quot; we would be delighted if a german brewery could settle in our city , &quot; said the vice party secretary of the south china metropolis , li yiwei , this week on visiting a spd delegation .
time and again , the communist party of china ’ s ruling functionaries responded to this concern of the twelve-million metropolis .
guangzhou , which is also called canton in germany , is one of the richest cities in china , warned li .
that is why people had the purchasing power to afford german beer .
the hessian spd chairman thorsten schäfer gümbel , who led the german political delegation , told the host that he would go to germany to look for a possible partner for the project .
&quot; for beer it doesn &apos;t take much : good water , grain and joy of life , &quot; he added at lunch with the party upper in guangzhou .
mr li has already been able to shine his life , flatter him with the host .
the functioner then came from guangzhou with shepherd gum - albeit with red wine , which was added to the meal .
the chinese brand tsingtao is based on german brewing art .
tsingtao beer is produced according to the german purity law .
more business
a second wish of the chinese hosts would be a direct flight between frankfurt and guangzhou , said vice party leader li .
lufthansa had offered the flight earlier , but in 2012 it was cancelled for economic reasons .
&quot; it would be worth it again , &quot; the local politician showed convincing .
&quot; business between our two cities is growing ever more &quot; .
currently , travellers would have to depart via changsha in the hunan province , li complained .
the guangdong province , the capital of guangzhou , also hopes to be connected to the airport .
the vice governor of the province , chen yunxian , made this wish in his conversation with the social democrats the main focus .
&quot; this is a very good idea &quot; , schäfer gumbel , chinese deputy minister li jinjun , an intimate connoisseur of germany , answered in agreement .
well-maintained partnership
the bewildering guangular vice party leader hopes that the country will be able to become a partner next year .
li yiwei was already in the main but not yet in this function .
he came into office only this year after his predecessor had been expelled for corruption charges .
the local party leader , wan qinglian , also had to go .
the action taken against guangzhou officials is part of a nationwide campaign against party and administration corruption , which was condemned by head of state xi jinping with rigour .
the new leader li yiwei had been responsible for an american company before his party career , which was most unusual in the chinese communist party .
before taking office in guangzhou , he was in fujian as a senior official , where the car builder vw built a large factory .
frankfurt is officially more than a dozen twinning towns .
the connection to guangzhou , 9000 km away , is one of those that are maintained by both sides , such as a student exchange .
last year , the 25-year-old german / chinese association was celebrated .
the southern chinese metropolis on the pearl river is almost as strong as the whole of hesse with its economic power .
next year , it is seeking to raise a gross domestic product of eur 250 billion , li reported .
family of joan rivers &quot; pushes the thumb &quot; &quot; .
joan rivers has been a hospital since being introduced to new york city three days ago , and her daughter showed a very hopeful presence in the hospital .
&quot; thank you for your constant love and support , &quot; said melissa rivers today in a communication .
we are all pushing the fingers .
her mother was reportedly arrested on thursday after an emergency due to a heart failure in a clinic at the upper east side , yorkville endoscopy , in mount sinai hospital .
doctors deliberately keep them sealed and under close observation until they are satisfied with their condition , which continues to be described as &quot; serious &quot; .
the reactions have been expressed by many , including an overwhelming online support from donald trump , montel williams and kelly ripa .
environmentally friendly vacuum cleaners and rising wages
for cars and vacuum cleaners that will be retailed from today , stricter environmental standards will apply in the future .
similar to refrigerators and washing machines , new vacuum cleaners are given a label from september 1 on which the buyer can see key data such as the energy efficiency of the equipment at a glance .
new cars are subject to the euro 6 category of pollutants , and nitrogen oxide values are more stringent .
there is also more money for scaffolding manufacturers : they receive a nationwide uniform minimum wage of eur 10.25 .
amazon buys twitch for $ 1.04 billion in $ 1.04 billion .
amazon has just confirmed what information reported on monday morning : the online retailer - and video producer , and a lot of other things - buys the video streaming service twitch for 1.04 billion $ ( $ 1.04 billion ) .
the announcement comes as a surprise , not because nobody expected twitch to take over , but because it was widely believed that youtube would acquire the company .
three months ago , it seemed that the sale of twitch to google ’ s video service was a cool billion euros a month , and the cooperation seemed to be natural .
twitch , who was only founded three years ago as justin.tv , was established as a general streaming service - a live version of youtube .
instead , it quickly became a platform for players who want to publish their bravours in games , a &quot; youtube for live games &quot; , so an insider .
the twitch interface .
and &quot; let &apos;s play &quot; , a video genre in which better wiser can describe ( mostly older ) play a paint of secret science theatre , are based on youtube .
it is just that youtube is often called when you want to describe twitch , so the message that youtube is a twitch that you want to buy was bored .
it is a mystery why the deal with youtube was not made , as the company reportedly was prepared to pay as much as amazon .
all we know at the moment is that statement by emmet shear , president of twitch : &apos; we have chosen amazon .
another secret , to be honest , is the incredible success of twitch .
for snobs like me , who say that they prefer to practice sports rather than watch , it is difficult to understand the attraction that assumes that they can watch others while they play , rather than the control console itself .
it is one thing to tell a friend about the shoulder at 3 o ’ clock in the morning , while resident evil is snaking , and something quite different to watch a spinner see him 20 times in one after another in cinity .
all these games could be viewed right now .
another problem is that many of the most popular games today are ego games , so watching can be done without any control of the perspective of the view , a really good recipe for headache .
i admit that the rapid procedures in which the roger bannisters of our electronic age have played whole games in record time are very difficult to understand .
but until a game or humorvirtuosis is included , his twitch channel is probably not so interesting .
but what do skeptics like me know about it ?
twitch is visited by 55 million different visitors per month and is the fourth largest source of internet traffic peaks .
and how exactly does amazon want to make money from it ?
it is difficult to imagine twitch being as elegant in amazon instant video , as yotumbe twitch simply would have swallowed .
but twitch has something that every company would like : thousands of young men who have been advertised as advertising customers .
as the chairman of twitch , shear , said , amazon and twitch &quot; both believe in the future of gaming , &quot; and the medium does not show any signs of shrinkage , not yet - even .
on the hüpfburg at the burggarten festival on saturday there was a lot of going on .
the concept of the organizers agreed .
despite the strong rain cast on saturday evening , an estimated 1,200 music fans came to the open-air festival in burggarten .
at times , the admission had to be stopped .
&quot; that was annoying , &quot; said ron sem , one of the organizers .
salwedel l light and fun .
maxim sachraj and ron sem have taken the name amula from two spanish words .
the open air in the salzzweideler burggarten is supposed to be a highlight of the day and in the evening through various shows .
well , and the fun is coming from it alone anyway .
this was evident early on saturday , when the first visitors came to the open air .
the organizers had promised a festival for all generations .
and you have succeeded in doing so .
around the state of supply on the burggarten meadow , both guests from the nearby and other surrounding were very comfortable .
they followed the first live performances , followed with the foot in the clock , enjoyed kühle drinks - in short : pure relaxation and enjoyment were the order of the day .
and the way it is across generations .
while some are on ceilings on the white sand on the beach bar , some are on the beach side , others are on the vinothek side , but the afternoons were on the hip castle .
but even in the case of children ’ s minkies , the volunteers had a lot of work to do to help the andrang and to create imaginative creations in the small faces .
the larger ones used the kicker tables or participated in a skateboard workshop that the goodfoot-crew from salzwedel had arranged .
until the great rain came .
just before 5.30 p.m. , he proudly crashed at the visitors , mainly families were looking for the wide and dry .
but the attractiveness of the festival did not diminish this .
&quot; there came more people than expected , &quot; said ron sem , who spoke of a &quot; success all round &quot; .
that is why we are not in the way of a repeat of the big party next year .
although the content and size of the event still have to be worked on , sem made a first statement on sunday in relation to the popular voice .
he described as annoying that the admission has been stopped .
apparently , the security company had been booked with too little force .
as a result , some who had already paid no longer came to the site .
the response was very good .
in a first cautious estimate , the salzwedeler co-organizer spoke of about 1200 visitors who were dumbling in the burggarten .
there were problems with sound technology .
the hip-hop band &quot; n`rox brake their performance , so it was unnervated .
the technicians were unable to produce a reasonably sound .
the planned shisha lounges could not be built because the tents were not closed due to a tyre span .
&quot; next year , however , they will be there , &quot; says the organizer .
the premiere of the amula-open-air was more than successful from the number of visitors .
and that in bad weather .
however , the organisers have made some mistakes , which will be delayed for the first time , but which must be corrected in the second edition .
also in the social network facebook the organizers must introduce criticism .
&quot; sorry , but for 12 euros you just expected more &quot; , melanie meier says at the event page .
&quot; you &apos;ve taken over a little , &quot; says ele zimmermann at the same place .
others do not see the initial problems as closely as they are .
i think it is very good that some people are not just stupid , but are really trying to put something on their feet .
hut ab ! &quot; , writes stephanie jenß to the amula .
now , the organisers have one year to dispel these criticisms .
new radom in berkum : wachtberg ’ s landmark shrunk
that is not the case , as we expect .
instead , the part that is ready to be installed in the striking structure is waiting for it to be inserted .
the action is in the context of a major measure : almost 50 years after the establishment of the tira space observation radar , the shell , the so-called radom , is completely renewed .
the new radom is equipped with a diameter of 47.5 meters and is slightly smaller than the old one .
the size remains world record .
the last step to complete the new case is the cappella exchanger .
the upper part of the old shell is separated and covered with a crane .
after that , the last quarter of the new envelope will be set up .
if the weather is in the air , the action should be taken at the beginning of this week .
participant in the ice-bucket-challenge will be able to get kiefer and his / her own knees out of the competition .
isabelle roberts from the uk screamed so much as her ice-cold water poured over her head that she had to change the bone structure of her face .
this ice-bucket-challenge was painfully done .
a woman was admitted to the hospital after she had been diagnosed with the problem so much at the ice-bucket-challenge that she had pulled out the jaw .
isabelle roberts from the uk was so ringing when her ice-cold water was poured over the head that she had to change the face structure .
&quot; the water was so cold that i screamed , and while i did , my jaw simply stood , &quot; she said to the mirror .
ice water is shaken over the age of 20 .
isabelle roberts a few seconds before the accident
i wanted to close my mouth , but that did not go , the jaw was hated , and then i understood that something was not right .
my mother and sister saw it and made themselves laughing almost into the pants , but i had to take the emergency .
the 20-year-old from britain was admitted to hospital to look after the kiefer following the viral trend on tuesday .
the clip was developed for a web conversation and thousands of times on facebook and twitter .
the burgundy clubs will soon pull together again ?
the last thing that we have seen is a clash between the two wolfratshausers burgvereins .
now , the boards of directors are thinking about possible cooperation .
as a model for the reconstruction of the wolfratshauser castle , the late richard dimbath , former chairman of the wolfratshauser burgfreunde , led the project in guédelon , france .
a year ago , there was no good climate between the burgverein and the friends of the castle wolfratshausen .
the positions , as they have been , so far seemed to be very different from those of the history of the wolfratshauser burg and possible reconstruction .
now the two camps are moving towards one another : talks are to be held soon about a common approach .
the club board of directors torsten sjöberg ( burgverein ) and herbert piffl ( burgfreunde ) confirm this on request of our newspaper .
&quot; i called mr piffl and suggested that we could sit down together once , &quot; says sjöberg .
he believes that in future , all members of both clubs could pull together again .
this is how we have seen more rapid results .
while the burgundy are still alive around the suddenly deceased richard dimbath , until the last time they had a reconstruction of the castle on the mountain forest , the burgverein around sjöberg is the &quot; discovery and discovery &quot; .
herbert piffl , the second chairman of the friends of the burgundy , was very pleased with the call , according to his own information .
since dimbath ’ s death , he has been standing before his friends in the castle .
a new chairman is to be found in a members &apos; meeting in mid-september .
currently , according to the 74-year-old , the association has about 40 members .
&quot; after the death of my friend richard dimbath , we have continued to support the association activities out of respect &quot; , which is a &quot; period of thought &quot; that was necessary to &quot; consider how to proceed .
according to piffl , the new chairman is to go into the conversation with the burgverein .
until then , the friends of the castle could also have a current mood in their grouping .
there is not yet a candidate for the presidency , says piffl .
&quot; but i &apos;m confident that someone will find himself , &quot; he himself does not want to stand because he is resident in bad toelz .
the new chairman should be a wolfratshauser .
the toelzer wool in the project &quot; but very happy to continue working &quot; .
the different views on reconstruction are piffled in the near future .
he recognizes dimbath as a &quot; missionary &quot; who always believed in the reconstruction of the castle .
two similar projects in austria and france , which are already well advanced , would show that this idea is not a chasm .
the high level of participation of the population and voluntary workers from all over the world make them a tourist magnet .
piffl : &quot; i was also sceptical at the beginning .
but over time i have become more and more convinced that it makes sense to move the project forward &quot; , it could be a &quot; standalone &quot; for the flirts city .
there is nothing else in this area .
moreover , the project would be supported by eu subsidies , visitor tickets and potential sponsors , and piffl believes .
&quot; i want to make it clear that i do not want to throw the idea of reconstruction out of the window . &quot; he hopes that the burgverein will perhaps move on this point .
their goal of documenting history first is &quot; important and good &quot; .
we could then look at it .
clever ways to save on university textbooks
since the cost of university textbooks for many students is more than $ 1,000 per year , the fast-second semester student matt schroeder considered a clever sparidee .
he invented a system of loan for books by students of higher semester and offered nominal compensation to facilitate the resale .
&quot; my mathematical book usually costs $ 180 , but i got it for $ 10 for a semester and a chick-fil-a-biscuits , &quot; said schroeder , 19 , who is the covenant .
the data required for the last semester would have cost him $ 430 , he said .
he gave $ 120 out .
the college leadership announced that the student would receive an average of more than $ 1,200 per year for textbooks and study material , that it would have different cost reductions for students .
online stores and creative approaches such as the schroeder are increasingly the solution to the choice for students .
leasing textbooks is becoming more popular , and students can create a book for a semester , often at a much lower price than buying it .
neebo inc , which has more than 250 university bookshops , announced that the rental of books is not possible .
surveys in the industry show that about a quarter of the books in the college bookshops last spring were printed .
less than half of all textbooks are published according to the national association of college stores in campus bookstores .
here is a one-off for the best deals .
buy online
some new books cost only one third of the price you pay in the campus bookstore online .
the ninth edition of &quot; calculus &quot; vno ron larwon , bruce edwards and robert hotetler costs almost $ 290 , but can be found at the specialist textbook retailer chegg$ 2399 for $ .
used to buy
if you want to read the notes of other or normal usage tracks , you need to have used books as a good option .
&quot; calculus &quot; is used on chegg.com for $ 93.49 .
matt casaday , 25 , graduate student at brigham young university , says that he is on amazon.com spent 42 cents for a second edition of &quot; strategic study &quot; .
the book was sold for $ 48 .
academics such as ingrid bracey , head of the university of massachusetts at amherst college without walls , recommended students to study at their professors .
sometimes the updates for the seminar work are not relevant .
in such cases , older expenses can often be used for a fraction of the costs for the latest edition .
besides chegg and amazon , half.com is a popular alternative for used computers .
renting
leasing textbooks is worth considering if you want to use them reasonably well , remember to return them and you can book them after the course is completed .
you can pay more than 80 percent of the cost of a newly purchased book .
a student could , for example , call &quot; calculus &quot; for the duration of a semester for about $ 20 .
find out about the terms and conditions of the business you rent , including the penalties that may apply to writing a note .
the tenant is careful : if you do not return the book , the penalty charges may even exceed the price of a new book .
e-books
e-books , rather than conventional textbooks , are also an option .
sometimes these books are de facto rented by issuing an electronic license for a certain period of time by wholesalers such as amazon.com , chegg and barnes &amp; noble inc .
at chegg you can buy &quot; calculus &quot; for 6 months for about $ 61 .
bracey says that students in literary courses often find the best offers , because many classics can be downloaded free of charge nowadays , while scientific and engineering textbooks can be very expensive .
look around at it in any case .
joe gault , 29 , who will soon be the pepperdine law school , recommends the isbn number for the price determination of books , since you can be so sure that you are the right textbook .
and before placing an order online , gault said , that the book is actually in stock .
he learned this lesson on the hard tour .
he bought a book that had four weeks delivery time and finally paid the full price in the college bookshop .
why &quot; guardians of the galaxy &quot; no cash register hit was not made .
&quot; the expendables 3 &quot; by sylvester stallone played less than 30 million dollars of its 90 million dollar budget in the us , while &quot; sin city : a dame to kill for &quot; was only $ .
the model tailored to cameron diaz , &quot; sex tape &quot; , played only 14.6 million dollars on the opening weekend , while children &apos;s films such as &quot; drachenzähmen leicht 2 &quot; also hit the revenue .
an article from the telegraph film critic robbie collin suggests that children &apos;s films are not affected by the lack of quality in films themselves .
collin called 2014 the worst year for children &apos;s films , and described &quot; drachenzähmen gleich 2 &quot; as a purely &quot; functional &quot; fantasy continuation .
in films for a slightly older audience , however , it seems that the quality of the films is not necessarily the problem .
in july , entertainment weekly compared the average cinemascore- and metacritic-rating for each summer movie start , which took place between the american memorial day and the 20th july 2013 and the current year .
the results are based on the opinion of the audience and film critics , and indicate that this year ’ s film hits are similar to those of last year .
some commentators say that the development is due to changing vision habits and the growing popularity of web streaming services such as netflix .
director jon favreau , currently working on disney &apos;s upcoming jungle book film , said to the site hallywood .
we must accept this and not try to follow the past .
unlike the current weak cash outcomes of hollywood productions , netflix has achieved sales of € 39.4 billion with streaming content .
last summer , the director steven spielberg criticized film studios for being too focused on film from coimics .
in the light of the current downturn , some commentators argue that his gloomy prophecy may well contain a true core .
the expected potential for causal setbacks in the summer of 2015 , including avengers : age of ultron , minions , and jurassic world , have made other representatives of the film industry more optimistic :
the producer of x-men , simon kinberg , described the decline in cash results recently as simple &quot; cyclical &quot; and said to hollywood reporter : &quot; the next summer will be the biggest summer in the world .
when the second table-tennis district class was closed for tightening up the league division some years ago , this is a step in the right direction .
now the german table tennis federation has an additional 3rd bundesliga in the program .
as a result , those who have not climbed have gone down .
for example , göttingen ’ s top class team torpedo won the top prize in the oberliga release , but will play only fifth in the upcoming season .
the fourth class will remain torpedo ladies , despite their grandiose march into the regional league .
the boys and girls of torpedo start in the lower saxony league , as well as the boys of the sc weende .
the sg steering and torpedo reserve are in the new association league .
the ttv geismar plays a role in the association league , the torpedo second in the national league .
what of the composition looks like a better district class , is now the new district soberliga south .
here tsv seulingen , vfb lödingsen , torpedo iii , geismar , einbeck , hamenstedt , bovender sv , langenholtensen and the fc west .
in the district sliga , as regional representative dransfeld and the sc weende , in the district class of ttc ii , rot-weiß , the bovender sv ii and the teams of the ttv ii .
güntersen , the ttc and ttv geismar ii are here with from the lot .
in the district sliga start torpedo iii and sattenhausen / wöllmarshausen .
with nine teams each , the team consists of nine teams each .
the sc weende sends his girls to the small district sliga .
the hotel is also home to the scw boys &apos; district sliga squad - there is torpedo ii still running - is not complete .
in a district class geismar , tuspo weende and the bovender sv go into the season .
in the first season of the newly established regional association , the two göttinger circular leagues with nine teams each start .
in the west season , the red / white ii , bovender sv iii , laubach ii , torpedo iv and v , mtv grone , dransfelder sc ii , mielenhausen .
in the eastern season , among other things , sattenhausen / wöllmarshausen , nikolausberg and landolfshausen are playing .
the ladies &apos; kreisliga consists of sattenhausen / wöllmarshausen ii , bilshausen , hemeln , sielingen ii , tuspo weende and the sg rhhume .
this is still better than in the county of osterode , where there are no women teams at all .
it is striking that none of the six secondary circle classes should reach starch , here the innovative and fuzzy district board will have to think about .

with the 2 : 0 over grödig has a bitter week for rapid on sunday an eventful end .
&quot; the victory is very liberating , &quot; said trainer zoran barisic , whose team with the from in the europa league had reached an intermediate low on thursday .
&quot; the success experience was incredibly important , &quot; confirmed captain of the team and goalkeeper steffen hofmann , who was in third place with green white .
schrammel-dreamtor is rapidly launching on siegerstraße rapid , the second season ’ s victory has provided the right response to the disappointment against helsinki and is entering the country scene with a success experience .
&quot; we wanted to show a positive reaction , &quot; said foreign defender thomas schrammel , who , with his splendid leadership volley from the sixteenth corner , set the course for victory in the 14th minute .
&quot; i thought i had all the frustration of thursday and i quickly swallowed him under the bar , &quot; said the 26-year-old smiling .
when schrammel was elected the last time in a bundesliga match on 13 november 2010 , it was still for ried .
the first championship hit in the rapid-ddress is therefore going to remain in his special memory .
&quot; for me this is something very special , i am from the rapid-newcomer , &quot; said schrammel .
due to the short-term mud sheet by mario pavelic , schrammel from the left put on the right defensive side and made the way for him there too .
he has had enough experience of mirroring this position .
he deserves the goal , he has already done some assists this year , &quot; commended barisic .
team shows character schrammel also provided the flank at 2 : 0 by hofmann after about an hour which finally brought the decision .
the fact is that the guests could have written before that .
&quot; thank god we have had some luck today , &quot; also noted schrammel , who was referring to the clash of performance and result in recent weeks : &quot; the results have not voted , but that &apos;s the game .
barisic even found that one &quot; had been better in many games than today &quot; - against &quot; the strongest team that was in this season at this stadium &quot; .
the first three-point since 26 july has therefore proved that the team structure is capable of responding intact despite the setbacks : &quot; today my team has shown that it is a character &quot; .
it is no less gratifying for him : &apos; we have finally played too little again &apos; .
a lot of work during the pause for a country is also the fact that with brian behrendt , mario pavelic , christopher dibon , deni alar and michael schimplsberger several trials .
&apos;we must not forget this &apos; , barisic warned , who has been working with behrendt and pavelic players for the last three days , &apos; which has been very stable recently &apos; .
the national break must therefore be used to &quot; wound the wounds and to play a little bit in the physical area &quot; , barisic explained , who was five u21 selections .
one that is probably particularly convenient for the break is captain hofmann .
he is tearing up for the team , going over pain .
it is precisely at this difficult stage that he has shown that he is a very important player for us , &quot; noted barisic .
hofmann gave the game rapids prior to its replacement in the 68th minute not only the structure , but also achieved the second goal .
for the 33-year-old who had his 350th bundesliga match , it was the first hit from the game since november 2 , 2013 ( 4 : 2 on the admira ) .
hofmann : &quot; must not believe that now everything is good &quot; &quot; we certainly have had a bit of luck , but at some point luck also has to come back to us .
now it was high time , &quot; hofmann said .
he admonished , however , to continue working in a focused manner : &apos; you must not always see this in black and white .
we have not played as badly in recent weeks as we have been told .
we must not , however , believe that everything is good now .
the importance of his role for the team was not disputed .
it is a very young team , and i can help it very much at the moment .
they are keeping to me in certain phases , &quot; said hofmann .
grödig-coach michael baur had little to reproach himself and his team .
he regretted the rapid counter &quot; from the category wizard &quot; , as well as the regular gate of nutz in the 40th minute , which was declared unjustly by referee collegger .
the only accusation i can make to the team is that we are moving towards tor in some stages not concrete enough .
we have had too few conclusions in this regard .
interior defender maximilian karner saw it similarly : &quot; it started badly but then we found a way and even made a gateway .
by and large , there would have been more in it .

we showed a powerful tribe in our puzzle task of the summer series &quot; my piece of the rhöner happiness &quot; last friday .
several of these giant trees are still in the district , the illustrated copy is the &quot; scourgerehoheiche &quot; above the unterweißenbrunn .
a tricky walk leads up to the 600-year-old oak tree .
it goes past couples , basaltic clusters and basaltic seas .
a little bit below the stone quarry from the bauersberg , one kilometre north of the road to weisbach , where it stands .
vital looks like the natural monument , it rises above the other trees of the area and recalls with a range of more than eight meters an american mammoth tree .
a small buddha on a tree stump indicates that it is a spiritual or mystical place .
but , despite intense research , there was only evidence of the origin of the name .
dr. wolfgang schneider has consulted the bischofshheimer archive and consulted older people from the unterweißenbrunn to find out what their own working relationship is with the scourge .
the result of his investigations remained the rather sober explanation for the name .
so up to 80 years ago , goat shepherds were supposed to have their animals put on the laboriously roasted and liberated by stones from the grassroots .
at the foot of the tree the trees are to be worn out by the climb .
meanwhile , the area has regained its importance , because goat herds are actually being found on the meadows .
the area has also become the core zone of the biosphere reserve , has further developed schneider .
when entering the stone collections , however , be careful , because the stone covered by the sun is not very strong .
a hiking trail leads from unterweißenbrunn to the tree , which is rather hidden .
other paths are indicated , the direction hochrhein up and lead to an extensive hike .
where is the waterburg ?
a watercastle that is sought for our next task , however , is rather rare in altitude .
the mirroring in the moat gives a good impression of the building , but we have some historical buildings in the district , which could be covered by the building counter fei .
where is our &quot; piece of the rhine happiness &quot; ?

after weeks of tug-of-war , italy ’ s premier and current eu president , matteo renzi , has fought strong conservative opposition at last week ’ s eu special summit to nominate his foreign minister , federica mogby .
renzi sees how the government newspaper la repubblica , which has reproduced the vocation of his faculty as a favorite in the government team as a strengthening of the position of the social democrats and his own .
he expects a boost from this for his &apos; reform package &apos; in italy .
last but not least , renzi hopes that the revolving left-wing party base , which is constantly being called for , will be calmed down , because mogherini will , albeit more moderately , be associated with it .
i have to say to the conservative representatives with president jean-claude juncker and the polish president of the council , donald tusk , that the prevailing opinion in rome is that a political balance should be struck .
the eu &apos;s chief diplomat will be the vice-president of the commission , mr juncker .
the european parliament &apos;s outstanding approval is considered certain .
otherwise , president giorgio napolitano would have announced the appointment of the 41-year-old politician of the ruling democratic party ( pd ) , hardly a &quot; important recognition &quot; of italy &apos;s role in the eu .
la repubblica spreads optimism that the political parties that have been tried and tested in leading party offices for almost two decades and known for their ambition are facing the &quot; enormous challenges &quot; .
the native romans are married and have two daughters .
her party career began with the phd political logist in 1996 in the youth organization of the then democratic di sinistra ( left wing democrats ) , which was founded in 2008 with the catholic center party martín .
in 1999 , mogherini was elected vice-president of the european community organization of socialist youth ( european jungsocialists ) for three years .
with the election in 2001 to the left-wing party council , it entered the high party politics , worked in the foreign affairs department , of which she soon became head .
it occupied traditional focal points of italian foreign policy , such as the middle east , was further strengthened by studies of nato deployment in afghanistan , in which italy is involved with a troop contingent .
since 2008 she has been a member of the chamber of deputies , where she is an expert on defence and european and international affairs .
when renzi was prime minister in february 2014 , he advised mogherini to be his secretary of state .
if the pd today wants to re-establish a better relationship with the country ’ s strong peace movement , which is one of the party ’ s more than 40 % votes in the may eu elections , then , as pd circles have noted .
i am not happy with the accusations in brussels that the new eu foreign office has too little diplomatic experience , so there is no substance in it , in the pd .
in brussels , poland and the baltic members in particular are being misled with realistic accents being given to mogherini &apos;s crisis in ukraine and described as &apos; pro-russia &apos; .
it supports the measures taken by the russian gas pipeline south stream , which is the russian gas pipeline under circumvention of ukraine directly to the south of europe .
after renzi took office as eu president in july , mogherini travelled to the country ’ s first state visit .
photos you took with putin at the shake hands were taken in brussels with outrage , as were the fact that you did not want to leave the kremlin chief for a milan economic summit in october .
on monday , nine young people took up their training at emz-hanauer in nabburg .
below it is an azubi who has already completed another training in the company .
in the future , the new employees will be active in four training occupations : electronic ( three trainees ) , mechatronics ( two ) , tool mechanics ( two ) and process mechanics ( two ) .
all azubis come from the district schwanddorf : tobias braun and thomas bucherl from schwarzach , stefan brickl and florian rewitzer from schmidgaden , johannes beburg bebebeirburg , johannes beoberlieben .
the new trainees had previously visited primary and secondary schools and real schools .
from wednesday to friday , the trainees of all the years and the trainers go to oberammergau to attend a team training event , where , among other things , an all-day hike and rafting on the inn .
the company has 435 employees throughout germany and 950 employees worldwide .
the number of trainees distributed over all years is 27 .
the socialists in france should &apos; keep their mouths and put france in order &apos; , said the main ally of francois hollande .
mr valls called the deeply divided left to &quot; protect their love &quot; for the controversial and unbalanced socialist president .
the president deserves everyone &apos;s respect , he deserves our loyalty , he deserves our support .
&quot; it is our duty to stay at his side , &quot; he said at great applause .
as a reassuring gesture , the prime minister insisted that his government should not leave france ’ s controversial 35-hour week , despite strong demands for the easing of emmanuel macron ’ s regime , the new economic issues .
on saturday , mr hollande urged his fellow socialists to &apos; unite &apos; with the government .
but christiane taubira , the minister of justice , strayed sand into the gearbox , in which she was breakaway at a meeting of breakaway socialist members and the socialist party criticised for not having done so .
marine le pen , the far-right leader of the national front , mocked the constant excavation by the socialists and said that they could not imagine that the new valls government would last longer than a few months .
francois hollande is the emperor without clothes , but prince manuel valls has none , they are forced to form a new government if the old one does not even survive a summer .
&quot; and the new one will not survive the autumn or winter , &quot; said mäulein le pen to supporters .
she repeated her party &apos;s call for parliament to be dissolved and said that she was confident that she would win in early elections , and was prepared to stand with the government .
the french ruling party suffered a defeat in the local elections in march and the right-wing national front was at the eu elections in may .
a survey in the sunday newspaper journal du dimanche showed that 76 percent of french people believe that the french are not in favour of the risk of the french being forced to do so before the end of hollande ’ s 2017 term .
pascal perrineau , a political scientist at sciences po university , warned that the french were quick to take the patience that they needed to get the new socialist government to do no economic and record improvements .
&quot; there is a small window of opportunity , but public opinion must feel fast that things change , &quot; he warned .
otherwise , the situation could continue to deteriorate .
norwegian cruise just before a deal with prestige cruises of $ 3 billion .
norwegian cruise line holdings ltd nchl.o , the third largest cruise operator in the world , is continuing its advanced cruise control negotiations , according to industry experts .
a deal would cost norwegian cruise , a company with a market value of $ 6.8 billion , access to the luxury cruise ships of presidium prestige cruises and its wealthy customer base .
an agreement could be announced this week , the sources said sunday and warned that the talks will also be fruitless .
the owner of prestige cruises , the private equity company apollo global management llc ( apo.n ) owns a share of 20 percent of norwegian equity .
the sources asked to be able to remain anonymous , because the negotiations were not public .
representatives of norwegian cruise and prestige cruises did not reply to requests for comments , while a spokesman for apollo refused to comment .
the miami based company norwegian cruise operates a fleet of 13 cruise ships on routes between north america , the mediterranean , the east sea , central america and the caribbean .
its revenues were $ 2.57 billion in 2013 , 13 % increase in 2012 .
prestige cruises , also located in miami , operates under the brand names oceania and regent , which are together eight cruise ships on routes to scandiannasia , russia , the mediterranean , north america , and the mediterranean .
it reported revenue for 2013 of $ 1.2 billion , a 6 % increase compared to the previous year .
the cruise industry is worth some $ 29 billion in total , and in the next few years , it will be worth $ 10 billion due to the strengthening of the middle class in emerging economies such as china and india .
the companies are trying to be the best choice for these new customers with cruise operators .
prestige cruises applied for a visa to the us regulators in january 2014 .
apollo is the majority shareholder of the company since 850 million $ deal 2007 .
norwegian cruise was established in its current form in 2000 by a merger with a cruise operator owned by genting bhd ( gent.kl ) , a leisure and kazinomisch group .
apollo invested $ 1 billion in norwegian cruise in 2008 .
norwegian cruise started trading in january 2013 .
genting held a 28 percent stake in the company ’ s shares , according to the licensing authorities , apollo held 20 percent of the shares and the private equity company tpg capital lp a 8 percent share in the company at the end of june .
carnival , royal caribbean cruises and norwegian cruise have a common set of cruises , according to the original data for the stock exchange of prestige cruises , 82 % of passengers .
pro-hong kong activists condemn china the day after the election .
a peking-loyal group near the country swung the chinese flag .
the standing committee of the national people &apos;s congress adopted a framework law on sunday , which only two or three candidates for the hong kong leadership election in 2017 allowed .
all candidates must first receive the majority support of a nomination committee , which is expected to work with peking-loyal members .
this decision will make it almost impossible for opposition democrats to be allowed to vote and led pro-democratic parties to vote for the resolution .
political reforms have long been a controversial issue in hong kong ; and china ’ s party leadership fears that calls for democracy will be extended to other cities .
after the publication of a white paper in beijing , which confirmed china ’ s dominance over hong kong in june , pro-democracy activists held an unofficial referendum on the electoral process in the special administrative region , where the government was in power .
lis survey is conducted by the hong kong government and the chinese liaison office in hong kong .
the vice-chairman of the legal affairs committee of the standing committee , zhang rongshun and the vice director of the hong kong and macao state council office , feng wei , should be asked during the day .
student activists announced that they would be in front of the office of the head of the hong kong leadership in the afternoon .
britain has not seen the end of the 150-year colonial government in hong kong any democratic element .
putin is asking kiev to open &quot; statehood talks &quot; with eastern ukraine .
russian president vladimir putin demanded russian media reports on sunday that ukrainian citizens ’ government should stop fighting the separatists in the east of the country , and immediately begin negotiations on the &quot; statehood &quot; of the breakaway .
his spokesman , dimitri peskov , later made it clear that putin did not mean that this would be possible in the east asian region under the control of the separatists , but that his status vis-à-vis ukraine should be redefined .
putin ’ s call to the kiev government to negotiate on an equal footing with the pro-russian insurgents , however , fits in with the policy of the regime that it apparently pursued five months ago : aid for the separatist .
in an interview with the state television channel one , putin condemned the ukrainian military campaign to reconquer the political and economic areas held by separatists in the eastern regions of donetsk and luhansk , which was taken in march .
the kremlin and the separatists have recently described the area they have taken as &apos; novorossija &apos; or &apos; neurussia &apos; , a term that reminds of the pre-revolutionary shine of the russian empire .
putin pointed out that all those who , in the course of the campaigns of ukrainian politicians for the elections on 26 october , were in danger of losing civilian communities in the areas occupied by separatists .
&quot; we must start detailed discussions immediately , not only on technical issues but also on the political organisation of society and the state status of south-eastern ukraine , in order to safeguard the interests of the people living there , &quot; he said .
peskov said that putin ’ s reference to statehood in the context of greater autonomy must be seen , which has been rejected by the kiev leadership for months , to address fears in russian-speaking areas .
only the ukrainian government can give the eastern territories the necessary autonomy , peskov said .
it is not a question of negotiations between ukraine and russia , peskov said , &apos; because it is not a conflict between russia and ukraine , but an internal conflict in ukraine &apos; .
the kremlin ’ s clarification of the misinterpretation of the putin regime is a sign of the eu ’ s leadership in dealing with the separatist rebel regime .
moscow would have far greater difficulty in supporting the donetsk and luhansk regions in eastern ukraine , as the majority of the 6.5 million inhabitants do not belong to russians and surveys from the pre-conflict period are a great deal .
the autonomy that russian diplomats have mentioned in international fora would give regional governments in ukraine power to create their own trade agreements and external relations .
the half-baked peninsula in the black sea five months ago is the home of most of the russian navy and an important commercial port and historic coastal region .
the regions between the rostov region in russia and crimea are also rich in mines , factories and foundries , which are important components for the russian military .
ukrainian president petro poroshenko proposed a new policy for the european union in his speech on 7 june , which will be followed by new elections .
but his idea of autonomy seems to be in sharp contrast with that of the kremlin and the separatist rebels , whose armament and incitement moscow is accused of .
putin ’ s last call to kiev to negotiate with separatist leaders on an equal footing followed another preeminence of the rebels in the last week , after russian troops and tanks had been killed over the border .
the separatists supported by russia took over in the paltry , which , according to the fears of ukrainian security officials , was the first step of a campaign to take over the strategic coastal region to crimea , control of nowoasov .
for this reason , massive civilian and military preparations have begun to prevent mariupol , a steel industry , from being destroyed by the disaster .
poroshenko spoke at a meeting of eu leaders in brussels on saturday and urged action to prevent another russian aggression against ukraine , to prevent an earlier soviet republic .
&quot; we are at a point where there is no return , &quot; said poroshenko .
thousands of foreign troops and hundreds of foreign tanks are now on ukraine ’ s territory .
the eu summit did not decide on any concrete actions , the leadership demanded further sanctions against russia , which would be imposed on russia if the ukrainean crisis escalated unspecified .
ukrainian soldiers had to move away from their positions in ilowajsk after two russian tanks and 1,000 soldiers were sent to the danube region last week .
the first probably 63 ukrainian soldiers who were killed by the russian invasion of ilowajsk were arrested on sunday against 10 russian paratroopers , who were arrested a week ago in ukrainian territory .
nude photo scandal around australian celebrities and gabi grecko
geoffrey noblest made no secret of his anger over hackers , which presumably naked images of his fiancée gabi grecko and a who is who of the a-celebrities from hollywood .
the film city is in excitement after a series of clear photos of a naked jennifer lawrence in a hacking scandal about celebrities on the internet .
the hacker responsible probably has 60 nude photos of lawrence , star from &quot; die tribute von panem &quot; and from superstar &apos;s , including the models-kate upton and cara detton .
the australian actresa palmer , emily browning , yvonne strahovski , and grecko from melbourne were supposedly also taking private photos as a result of an icloud gap .
the list includes 101 celebrities .
noble ones , who lost their love of grecko last month , said to confitable : &quot; it is disgusting . &quot;
all private letters and pictures should remain private .
it is a shame that private information has been stolen and can be shared with others .
grecko , currently in new york , said according to a news site that the hack &quot; shameful &quot; and that the affected &quot; wounded &quot; felt .
the hacker probably has 30 images of palmer with their ex-friend scott speedman , including two pictures in which it is up without a pool .
palmers &apos; films include &quot; love is invincible &quot; with liam hemsworth .
palmer , chuck-star strahovski and actress browning from sucker punch stood yesterday for comments on the hacked images .
a representative of lawrence said to tmz : &quot; it is a heinous violation of privacy . &quot;
actors seth rogen condemned the hacker in his tweet : &quot; hacked images from a mobile phone is nothing else than to sell images of hehlerware . &quot;
from a purely legal point of view , the spread of stolen images should not be tolerated .
cyclists , joggers and hikers were present at the 8th cycle race on the great feldberg yesterday and have thus joined the association &quot; help for cancer sick children &quot; .
the tour , which was a tortuous one , was a easy training for the others .
but there was one thing everyone agreed : it was fun .
thomas studanski was probably sleeping well last night .
for the first time in his life , the head of the oberursel brewery yesterday was riding on the feldberg mountain .
for the good .
the little muscle cake can be easily stuck away , especially as it is not allowed to take part in the 8th cycling on the big feldberg in favour of the association &quot; help for cancer children &quot; ( frankfurt ) .
that is a great thing .
&quot; i know now that i can - great ! &quot;
small showers on the way in the apple-auspauve ?
well , if i had ever stopped , it was out of ...
as thomas studanski , who worked for the cdu in the oberursel city parliament , many of the 718 participants were tortured in spring yesterday and came to the point of exhaustion , but happy to the plateau .
others , on the other hand , have found it easier to cross the eleven kilometres long route between hohemark and feldberg .
norman dießner , for example .
the green light that appears in red from the district - red dress , red beer , - made a big start .
he is also running the course in a slide , as did nina kuhn , press spokeswoman of the city of oberursel , who , together with frank grünisen , had set off on the road .
the first two triathletes were the &quot; feldberg bike &quot; , not necessarily a sporting challenge : &quot; this is about charity , we are happy to play with it - we could have got an exit today anyway &quot; .
on the way , they had met paul wenzel from oberreifenberg .
the boy ( 12 ) was down to oberursel in the morning to get up to the top again immediately .
the frankfurt florian ornament had settled in the saattel at 9 a.m. in the morning , &quot; made &quot; the feldberg twice , and then went home with fun .
the band also had fun &quot; fritten toni &quot; .
for the head of the oberurseler kultkiosk , cycling tours across the feldberg are just a part of it .
he had a great experience with his 6.5-kilo racing bike for 40 minutes .
a crazy event .
for this purpose - i am happy to be involved here , &quot; said andreas balzke .
the well-trained mainzer says that he is an &quot; ambitious racing bike &quot; .
he must be , because he was not in the middle of the road with the &quot; fix wheel &quot; , which is also racing bikes , but without circuit ...
the fact that it went up loosely without a bike proved not only that the 20 hikers who cross the white wall and the foothills up to the summit , but also a jogger who was on a cord .
professor of mountain watchmaking , professor volker lischke , who is with his team , equipped with all-wheel bully and quad , for safety , said : &quot; the kent &quot; i from frankfurt , the train .
the 718 participants - and thus as many as ever - were on the course in groups in the morning .
the hikers at 9.30 a.m.
the first cyclists and runners followed at 10 a.m.
five minutes later , the first mountain bikers started off .
bent hansen , chairman of the association &quot; cycling on the big feldberg &quot; , gave the start commands and wanted the participants a nice excursion .
for next year , he hopes that he will succeed in getting the route up to feldberg to the safety of the participants .
