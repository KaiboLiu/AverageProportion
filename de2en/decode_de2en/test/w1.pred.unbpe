richtin lady rae put the negotiating table on the table for 17 november .
refunds are not a matter of personal responsibility , but of the very american ideal of labour rights as a human rights ideology .
the congress hall is the largest conference venue for the world trade organization , with the participation of keith ellison and john lewis as a member of the congress .
&quot; so , as trade unions die , even the middle-class jobs die , &quot; said ellison , a demokrat from minnesota and deputy prime minister of the progressive caucus in congress .
therefore , i am proud to present , together with the citizens &apos; initiative , john lewis , the staff authorisation act .
this railway breaking project is a source of inspiration for workers in the same legal way as it does for trade unions to be organised as for other forms of discrimination - and thus stops anti-trade forces .
the addition of the national labour law is a way of ensuring that the labour market is discriminated against , in order to organise a trade union representation , in order to appeal to a civil court - and to prevent damage .
but it is with certainty not a radical initiative - at least not according to american standards .
indeed , the best way to address the problem of the global financial crisis is to understand what ellison , lewis , and other sponsors of their bill propose to link back to a very american idea .
despite the setbacks that the us trade unions have been facing in recent years - in vienna , in the united kingdom , michigan and in other countries across the country - americans have once said that they are ready to work .
it was a time when the european union was turning millions of americans into a monster , when it was trying to build democracy , freedom of speech , freedom of the press and freedom of association .
as the united states reacted after world war ii , the us encouraged japan to use the term &quot; japan &quot; to promote its own interests .
in full awareness of what the european union is about , workers and their unions are very much in the process of creating a new japan , and they are using a language that explicitly recognised that &apos; the rights of workers to union and common negotiation and action &apos; .
as the united states reacted after world war ii , germany pushed general dwight david eisenhower and his staff to build a constitution that would allow the country to become a “ fascism ” adolf hitler ’ s .
in recognition of the fact that the workers are going to have to organise themselves and their voice in the new nation , i added that the germans added a clause that explicitly states that they would not be allowed to do so .
agreements that are not in line with this right or that aim to prevent it are not acceptable .
as the former soviet union &apos;s first lady eleanor roosevelt presided over the international human rights commission , the eu was not a party to the universal declaration of human rights , as it was signed by the united nations in 1948 .
since generations we have been accepting the basic premise that working rights are human rights .
as this country was deprived of its own resources , it was not allowed to take part in the elections .
after this rights have been violated in america , the us has actually been very wise to ask itself the american ideal once again , so that the working world is the right to decide on the rights of its people and to live in a free and open society .
as mr pastor martin luther king jr. fifteen years ago said , &apos; we are not a man , we are a man , we are a man , we are a man , we are a man . &apos;
the history is a great success story .
now we all know that the working class movement has the strength of the nation , but rather the strength of the nation .
by using the increase in the standard of living of millions of people , work has , in a miraculous way , created a market for industry and made the whole nation unimaginable levels of production .
those who are not in favour of the work forget these simple truths , but history preserves them .
the history reminds us , and we should remember that .
the formal recognition of the working rights as human rights - and the extension of the protection of civil rights as a defence against discrimination in the creation of employee representatives - has long been overdue .
keith ellicon and john lewis renew the ideal , which america has in the past made great and which promises to build democracy .
judges stop at temporary interference , that all detentions clinics in louisiana are to close .
a us federal judge stoppte on sunday morning , for the time being , the implementation of a law in louisiana , which lawyers say that it is likely to be necessary to close all five abortion clinics in the state .
this measure , which was adopted by bobby jindal , governor of the louisiana district , in june , was adopted and adopted on 1 september .
the decision of the judge to take a decision , however , means that doctors will remain legally aborted for the time being , while they have such a right .
&quot; the killers can be compliant with the law while they are seeking the realization of this rights .
within a month , the commission will be conducting a hearing to examine the case for the law to be more permanent .
abduction supporters welcomed the initiative to give the recent decision in a number of judgments against similar measures and said that doctors were so concerned about time-consuming treatment .
&quot; the current decision means that the commission &apos;s women will be able to give their lives to a disproportionate law that has deprived them of their health and rights , &quot; nancy northup said , president and chairman of the centre for reproductive rights .
it was not immediately clear what the outcome would be .
lou siana is one of 11 states that have similar laws .
key words of the law in texas , which covers most of the government ’ s clinical trials to close are the “ unsafe ” state .
abduction supporters and the american college of the arts are now in a position to take part in the “ american college of ostretricians and gynecologists ” , as well as the american medical association .
abduction opponents are against that , because the measures are designed to protect women &apos;s health , even though some are not aware of the impact of closing hospitals .
only a doctor who has been in louisiana to treat abortions can be given patient information .
if all other doctors are in the state forced to pay no compensation for abortion , then the latter would be forced to leave the country for fear of their safety , the group said .
in your argument , you are not in favour of the judgment , but of the state of louisiana , who said that you do not have doctors to punish for the conduct of abortions , whereas their applications for patients &apos; injunction were pending .
delays in the diagnosis and lack of information are a major problem for the european union .
the company has been operating in the field of the development of the internet for over 30 years .
for women in the rural areas of australia , there is a higher risk of losing to eggs cancer .
forums are currently under construction and are being updated .
the research group , susan jordan , from qimr berghofer medical research institute , said that the most important thing for those who work in rural and remote areas of the state is the mortality rate .
small study : new medicinal products could help to reduce lung and eggs cancer .
the formula for the study was to identify the causes of the disease and to identify the causes of it .
dr. jordan said that the project &apos;s age is at the heart of the diagnosis , the type of eggs cancer , of existing predispositions and of social and economic status .
for older versions of the software , the use of the latest technology is a very important issue .
for those who are in rural and remote areas , the situation is not as bad as it was in the united states during the study .
although the study is not investigated why outside the city living animals are treated with higher probability of ovaries , it is not clear that the disease is likely to be transmitted late .
&quot; this disease is most likely caused by gynaecologically uncologically , and these are mostly in larger cities .
despite the improvement in telecommunications , the number of people who are distancing is still very high , and the number of people who are not in the service of the doctors who have arrived has increased .
dr. jordan said that the world health organization ’ s study was a poor one , regardless of geographical status .
the information provided by rio tinto ride to conquer cancer is not published today in the medical journal .
in march 2013 , the elisha neave , a young mother of 33 years old , was told that she had a aggressive , aggressive form of ovarian cancer .
garden and garden areas are a source of regret for the declining number of households .
the decline , along with increased competition , will have a significant impact on the number of homeowners under 35 , which may lead to tens of thousands of pounds per year if today &apos;s young consumers are left to choose their own garden after a study by the hta .
the report states that the commission &apos;s tenants are expected to pay an average of 55 % of the amount that people with their own homes can spend on their own homes .
the rise in people who have been living in highly urban areas is a consequence of the fact that they are not allowed to live in gardens , the popular procedure of using asphalt for parking purposes and the declining garden size are other factors threatening the industry .
in the greater london area , where over a period of 6 years of age the share of homeowners of 61 to 43 % has fallen , the cost of the least spending on garden products per household is reported .
the hta and the royal horticultural society of the united kingdom point out that the housing sector is the property of the owner or the owner of the property , not the land .
guy barter , chief executive officer of the group for the rhs said : &quot; container-gardeners are a very important part of the industry , for example , because they are able to take their plants with them when they move . &quot;
the hta report identifies the period between 1997 and 2005 as the &apos; golden age &apos; .
he is predicting that the global economy will continue to improve this year , owing to better weather conditions .
the amendments tabled by the opposition politician imran khan and the clerical tahirul qadri are not acceptable .

around a kilometre away , they delivered with sticks and stones , and they were equipped with clashes with security forces .
the police continued to tear down tears .
the demonstrators were calling for sharia ’ s resignation , and he refused to do so .
the army of the country is urging the government to find a political solution to the conflict , &apos; without time and without violence &apos; .
after a session in the headquarters of the company on sunday evening , the board of directors informed : &quot; the army remains in control of its role , the security of the state &quot; .
the military has a role to play in pakistan and has already played a more frequent role in the conflict .
the oppositional state is behaving like a “ political party ” , imran khan , in which he was elected in may last year .
the protests were most popular at the weekend , after khan and qadri had their supporters forced to withdraw from the sharia ’ s residence .
the first three people were killed .
turkey is ordered to pay us diplomat for espionage .
the turkish parliament has been calling on the service provider to provide assistance to the country ’ s most senior us diplomats on american and british espionage in turkey .
vice-president of the commission . - mr bülent said that the business secretary of the us embassy and turkish officials discussed the report on monday .
the german magazine &quot; the spiegel &quot; and the online magazine the intercept reported that the german government &apos;s data provided by the former us analysts of the national security agency , edward snowden , show that turkey is a major activity .
after the turkish government says that the turkish government played a key role in the country ’ s development , according to the turkish news agency .
a former us secretary of state , mr president , said that the most important secret service in germany was also in touch with ankara , created a much more angry response from the turkish government .
warning : the european union is not threatening to take action with regard to the pendler .
the federal wide warning system for the use of the train drivers at the monday evening could also reduce passenger traffic in nrw .

the main thrust of the warnstrike is the attack on goods .

said the district mayor of the trade union of german locomotives ( gdl ) , sven schmitte , in düsseldorf .
we expect the commission to make significant delays .
regional focus : the focus is not on it .
the main thrust of the warnstrike is to protect the goods transport .
the german railway in nrw announced the launch of the new version of the nrw to minimize the impact .
the gdl has , however , not said where they are going to strike , so it is difficult to get the consequences into the concrete perspective .
polizeichnif von magaluf the corruption charges

the first spring day of the naked and crashing weather .
the spring of the year has been a great winter experience for the whole family , with a lot of shows and a lot of fun .
on the evening until 9 p.m. , further 5mm of rain fell on the city , after 6.6.6mm , which was already in the night of sunday .
the last decline in the last decade was the result of a series of short stormy showers , including a cast that was just before 20 o &apos;clock and was found for almost 4mm rainfall in about 10 minutes .
after the winter was over for a fruitful dose of spring last week , the first two months of the year were already over .
the evil demigods have probably caused the devastation of the landing of a virgin airliner from melbourne to adelaide .
the aircraft would have been scheduled to be in service shortly after 19.30 , but was cancelled by a whirlwind - a sudden change in wind speed or direction over a short distance - and had to be taken .
windstöge reached a point at this time about 50 km / h on the ground at adelaide airport .
the airlines &apos; data showed that the aircraft was also very successful in a second landing .

given the galoppient technical progress of which the european parliament has been a very pleasant home in high-tech areas , i would like to say that we are not alone in having a good deal of money .
during my time here , i am reminded of the problem of the spiral cable that has been used to connect the listener to the phone , and i think that boah , like retro , is that ?
but dawning behind it is a thought : if the cable is not , the very short time it will be all the listeners will be flying around the house , and that would be even more important retro .
in any case , the principle of subsidiarity applies at the eckeltronic ( eckeltronic ?
no , tippfänger : electronic sector the rule that the world &apos;s novelty of today is the electric scrap of tomorrow , bought - outdated .
and who , for example , is still a pipe television in the living room , says that the only thing he can do is to reject television .
why this consideration ?
because we are anxious to push ifa to the radio tower in the week , we are once again being completely incompetent in matters of electronics .
the laser is a very important part of the sound , which was once a washing machine and cd-player blind , today , not even the purpose of the devices that were equipped with an unfaithful expert spree in front of him : &quot; connect &quot; .
yes , is it possible to do it ?
what we are talking about with people who are apparently free to do so ?
in fact , it is a question of the european union &apos;s ability to act like a member of the european parliament for some 20 years .
this is why the yoghurt itself is suitable for the purpose of making the fire alarm on your holiday in the maldives .
and would it not be wonderful if the european parliament &apos;s office could be able to count on our early arrival ... ?
yes , the prerequisite for this is air conditioning .
but a dream will be certainly not come true soon : we will lift our arms and armour , say you loud &quot; sour ! &quot; - and at home the dust collector drives the lot .
irre .
all is on the contrary , and nothing less than a revolution : &apos; the borders between white and brown are not clear &apos; .
for the daily practice we know that the use of a new and modern device is necessary , and that it is guaranteed that the battery will be empty .
what a further reason for this is that the spirited cable is on the phone also the next radio exhibitions will survive .
israeli leaders ’ children are returning home after the gaza war .
thousands of israelis ’ children from the areas in the vicinity of gaza have been killed and injured in the schools on monday , after they had been killed in air space for the summer , while missile and missile attacks were being fired .

in the southern city of ashdod , the staff of the &quot; pashosh &quot; children &apos;s garden , who was accompanied by a rocket , were especially aware of the presence of the students granatsplit from the walls .
&quot; we have a little bit of fear , but are excited to &quot; said ronit bart , aninhabited in the kitbutte saad and there are english teacher .

president reuven rivlin visited the country &apos;s kibbutz near the border with gaza , to express his support .
until a ceasefire ends last week ’ s war , the thousands of armed rebels and the entire population of the border communities , such as saad , left their homes to live in safer areas further away from gaza and to the missile .
many people in nahal oz , one of the municipalities near the border to gaza , in the area where a 4-year-old boy was killed by a palestinian assassination attempt , are hesitant to go to gaza .

the weapons are not only a problem for the palestinians , but also for the palestinians , important problems remain unresolved , such as the hamas request for the lifting of the israeli-egyptian blockade and the reopening of air and sea operations .
israel is calling for disarmament by hamas and for the transfer of the corpses of two in the fighting .
a new round of indirect taxation talks will probably be needed in the coming months in egypt .
in the war , more than 2,100 palestinians were killed , and the three quarters of them civilians , and at least 494 children , according to palestinians and the un estimates .
israel is denying this information and is estimating that it is at least half of the killed .

&quot; the npd cut the bad , &quot; he said .
the first is a positive development .

hari-thalta : tents for new refugees
on the new place , refugees are now being held in tents .
the central initial recording for refugees in haridong plains .
now the commission has the three tents of the red cross danele .
the district church of st. john was founded only a short time in advance - they are not very enthusiastic .
&quot; this skin is a very important source of energy for the citizens and gives the district authorities the opportunity to take action in a constructive manner .
your party is calling for the district assembly to be haridhi , at present , unused houses to be provided for accommodation .
96 refugees can be repatriated in the three tents .
the reasons for the overcrowding in the first picture are the crash of relief teams and the lack of support for the second .
many refugees remain in the european union for longer than the regular three months .
the skin care products have the strongest winter growth in seven years , but they show a widely observed growth rate of more than 50 % .
the rp data coreling system is a powerful , easy-to-use , and easy-to-use , hedonic home index for home ownership in australia ’ s capital .
by this increase , the total number of the new member states in june , july and august is 4.2 % , the biggest increase in the winter months since 2007 .
the annual report on the price of the oil in the united states was 10.9 percent , more than twice the increase in the 12 months to august 2013 , but the increases were not equal .
the research leader of rp data , tim lawless , told us that the number of sydney and melbourne cases is twice as large as the market .
the figures from rp data show that the number of skin cancer cases in syria is increasing by more than 40 % last year .
the following markets are adulterated , bristbane and darwin .
on the other end of the scale , canberra is located , which is covered by cuts in government spending .
mr lamy , i have to say that the treaty of lisbon has now been adopted for the coming months by means of the spring .
&quot; if you want to keep the ongoing high rate of auction prices , you have to look at a general fast sales rate and the ongoing price reduction .
in a statement to the new press , the report contradicts statements by the managing director peer medau and atteurs this , &quot; how a field lord &quot; to positively .
the style of the university is this not because it is not in the communication .
for example , the medau family has already been named &quot; verbally over the request of the university in mid-june &quot; .
the statement that the eu &apos;s plans will be known only in july is definitely wrong &apos; , says pötzl .
at the same time , he points out that the european pnr plans are not &apos; pre-established or even decisions &apos; .
the council , which is responsible for the access to the roads , must also be able to develop the narrow road up to the castle less dramatically than the medals feared .
from a nine meter wide road , the road was not , and is not , talk .
it is still not a question of eur 5.50 meters , that is a metre wide than before , &quot; explains pötzl .
the argument of medusa is that the member states are free and competitive in their parking spaces .
admittedly , there is no mention of it because it is the same as in other public parking areas .
the commission must be aware of the people living in the vicinity , and of the people living in the vicinity .
the children ’ s crib bergwichtel , which is located on the grounds and is situated on the front door of the park deck , was to be built according to the university president .
rather , it gives consideration to &apos; that there is no just a question of crimea , but also of the ancestors living in the vicinity of the entrance to the friedrich-strib-straße and the 800 school students at the neighbouring realschule .
it is not just a question of the parties involved , but of the interests of mr medau , &quot; he says .
whether the criticism of the parental leave is justified is not clear .
in early october , pötzl , together with the state building office in bamberg , plans to inform the city authorities about the construction development of the university by 2020 &quot; and in this context to stress the importance of new development &quot; .
peer med is a game that has been played by the famous &apos; &apos; kid &apos; &apos; , a game that has been played by the &apos; &apos; &apos; star trek &apos; &apos; &apos; &apos; star trek &apos; &apos; &apos; &apos; .
consequently , the commission &apos;s access to the new parking deck is not to be restricted to the campus and the friedrich-strib-straße , but to the medau-berg as it has been .
this would have to be the narrow road to be about one kilometre long .
according to the united states &apos; high-bills , the traffic in the park of hohenfels castle would thus increase tenfold .
from about 2000 vehicles daily , the issue is .
from the commission &apos;s side , it was not intended to be a statement on the project .
glanorf is from handball legs , and is the only one who has ever been to the team of the handball team .
holger glantorf will not be responsible for the dhb team anymore .
the 31-year-old from the bundesliga sg flensburg-handewitt introduced a new version of the first two new models , the &quot; kulturplanner &quot; .
the decision is very difficult for me , but it is a matter of months .
it is important for me to refer to the signals from my body .
he goes on to work with a balance sheet of 167 country games and 576 goals for germany in the international retirement .
because the worm &apos;s root-and-branch rear player is responsible for the champion league winner from flensburg .
with the islanders , who were to be able to leave their own cat on tuesday for the country games against switzerland , glandorf introduced a &quot; long and good conversation .
his ideas and approaches are of great interest to me as much as they are my many years of fellow players and my successors .
but for my club i would also like to be able to live in a healthy way over the next few years , for longer periods of recovery are necessary , which will reduce the current duplication .
the linkshander had a total of 240 seats in the european parliament after a distance infection in 2012 .
because of achilleesshehe problems , he had been distracted by team doctors from the german handball association ( dhb ) with a cortisone injection , which later became a strong inflammation .
a notary operation and two other interventions followed .
then i was able to get a killer against the team doctor .
twelve years of professional and elf years of national team career .
i have some health concerns about the building sites i do not ignore .
after the three informal trials of infectious footprints that took place in 2012 , the number of people affected by the disease has never been properly under control .
this is due to the fact that some other complaints relating to wear are not covered .
the first step of the year i noticed that the commission was not in favour of raising my head , but that it was not possible to deceive my body , &quot; explained glandorf in the interview to the magazine &quot; handball time &quot; .
for a comeback , he would only be in absolute need .
&quot; if all stripes are ripped , i am always talking . &quot;
however , i cannot understand the years in which i still have to play handball at one hand .
i must also say that i am still convinced , after my long stay in hospital in 2012 , that i have become quite humiliating as far as my health is concerned .
after my career as a journalist , i would like to go straight to the point .
in addition to the world cup title 2007 and the win of the champions league 2014 , he won the 2008 hsg nordhorn and 2010 ( tbv lemgo ) the ehf cup .

german economy in the spring at 0.2 % weakened , and the us economy declined by 0.2 % .
the crises surrounding the euro are a cause for concern for the german economy in the second quarter .
the gross domestic product of the european union fell from april to the end of june 2014 , compared to the previous quarter by 0.2 % .
the partial result was that the federal statistical office did not publish the results of the survey .
in the past , consumption alone had a staggering impact on the economy , while investment declined .
the council of ministers has also been braking the economy .
thanks to the strong rise in the year , the company has a strong overall growth of 2.7 % for the first six months compared to the second half of 2013 .
horstmar was the starting point and the goal of the &quot; münsterland mooiste &quot; , which was first mentioned by the burgmannsstadt on sunday .
the burgundian city of horstmar experienced a great deal of invasion on sunday .
the biggest cycle sport association in the netherlands , ntfu , organised the so-called &quot; munich bike week &quot; .
the company has a strong reputation for its excellent service and its excellent service .
the first edition of the international conference on the subject of the protection of the environment and the protection of the environment was held in munich .
the competition is being held in the german federal state of baden-württemberg .
we shall come from the heroes and we shall be at night to take part in this tour .
we would like to present the münsterland to you as well &quot; , freud &apos;s cyclists were pleased with the route through the steinfurt , borken and coesfeld .
after the registration in the club home of the schützenbrotherschaft sta .
katharina went to the school of a small &quot; peace &quot; through the city over the wall , where the start was also made .
further , the rote , the most important for three different categories , led to the herrenholz via the schöppinger mountain towards coesfeld and across havixbeck and billerbeck .
on routes of 95 kilometres , with 1175 elevation metres , 120 kilometres of 1475 metres of altitude and 145 kilometres of 1775 metres of altitude , the cyclists have demonstrated their good condition .
the food is served in the restaurant , in havixbeck and in the billerbeck .
the main organizer jos ter huerne and mayor of the town of heinz lölfingen showed themselves to be able to succeed in this cycling event .
we are satisfied and it was a nice experience for all concerned .
the organisation is based in the city of hamburg , germany , and there were no negative incidents &quot; , he draws up a positive conclusion .
unfortunately , not so many participants came to the event as the organizer hoped .
&quot; we see ourselves in the year 2015 with hopefully beautiful weather on 30 august or during a different weekend . &quot; he promised to do a lot of work , but he promised to return to münsterland and plan a new edition .
constantine weckers ’ gentle , honest memoirs are not the only ones to be seen .
it is actually more philosophical than a theological testimony .
not chi , but the same , is the thought of the people who are thinking about the world .
and he is about to be careful .
the fact that the commission is not a party to the convention is also a sign of its own tolerance of its fellow human beings .
wide range of services are also available , but the more important is the fact that love , soul , eco , the word being in the now , spirituality - all of this he tries to go on the basis of very philosophical , but also very philosophical , but .
and he explained the reasons for his pacific spirit , his social identity critique , his political commitment - and also , as he did not only listen to music ( the opera ) .
the latter is not in the habit of constantine wecker , but of the ascestic monk who &quot; through subtraction &quot; arises , as he says , &quot; by doing everything unnecessary away &quot; .
between all the high-minded views , there is also short approaches to the question of the “ earth ” : about the sleeping of a man in a gis frequented locally or a crazy world .
the commission is also quite careful about this .
lenny henry : my father has asked me never to enter the arm .
has never said &apos; i love you &apos; .
henry was one of seven children of a family jamaican immigrants in dudley in the midlands .
his father , who died in the year henry 19 , was working in a factory in which her relationship was limited .
henry probbied for a comedy , rudy &apos;s rare record &apos;s , which was partly based on an imaginary conversation with his father and was released on radio 4 .
the soundtrack is a very mixture of reggae and rap , with lively melodies and a mix of rhythms .
but henry had to be replaced by some difficult childhood moments .
he attended the &quot; many &quot; therapy courses in the aftermath of the death of his mother , and henry is contemplating his relationship with his father .
it was hard to get him to know .
it was never seen his face , he heard only his voice : &quot; hell with the crack .
let us make your sister in peace .
bewegungen sie !
i do not want to see cricket .
my older brothers seymour and hilton - the old ones - have been living in the city since i was a child - went to the pub and spoke about things like the form of the beer glass .
i had never had such a conversation with him .
a large part of my life was dedicated to this serious type in the corner that the newspaper read .
recently opened the henry a foundry , in dublin , where he has been working on better conditions than at the time of his father , has gained a reputation for his work .
it is now a little brighter , but you are dark , darker and more deep stylistic labyrinths with flame retardants and smoke and much rush .
my father put his name down in the wall earlier and then i could not see him again , as he was singing .
as i was there , i was very surprised that the commission was not able to do this for years , and that it was not possible to eat it .
nevertheless , the number of henry &apos;s children grew without a loving testimony of his parents .
my father moved to the new town , where he was never &quot; i love you &quot; .
only when the european parliament was able to vote against my mother &apos;s death did i start to say &quot; i love you , i love you , i love you &quot; .
by its own subsidiary , the company has been awarded dawn frnch , and has been able to share the love that he had missing as a child .
could you please tell me what you think about the &quot; i love you &quot; ?
the room was very small and the bathroom was very small .
papa , i am 22 !
with dawn frrent , the new version of the game is available for download .
why should we not be friends ?
you are a great person , but you are not a mother .
it is always a problem with french .
dwn is a good man .
why should we not be friends ?
you are a great person , but you are not a mother .
henry &apos;s own mother was diabetic and was a diabetic .
the trumpet of her death .
as i was very , very exaggerated and sympathetic to symptoms of diabetes , my doctor said , &quot; you must be radical .
so i pulled this fitness through and had to take a drastic diet , to get the symptoms .
it is very difficult .
and it is exhausting .
no one eat a carotten .
henry &apos;s career began in 1970 when he was a member of the group of the european people &apos;s party ( christian democrats ) and european democrats .
since he was elected by critics of his ottoman victory , he has been a great advocate of theatre .
it followed a series of comedy by the eruptions , and then fences from august wilson .
the first is the fact that the sitcom software is a very different experience from the sitcoms and comedy that has filled his working life .
he began with only 16 years , when he was in a factory , and was a member of the staff of the company .
a dj discovered a buffer overflow on stage when he was imitating and writing to new fases about him .
his television career began in the mid-1970s with the first television series , &quot; i was for a quite long time the only black imitator / comedian on television . &quot;
he learnt in his profession .
i had to work not only in the eyes of the public , but also from 1975 to 1985 , to learn how to develop an efficient witz story machine .
lenny 1975 at new fashion , new fashion , new york : the art of the year .
as his manager has the stage installation right to the black and white lounge , he is not only a member of the group but also a member of the group .
i have always been a very unpleasant family .
i wish that some kind of thing would never happen .
it was a special event , unpleasant , for me to be able to work on giant mountains .
but this &quot; millennium &quot; is not a good idea , because it is a very good one .
by using the new figurines , which are the british black culture both vermolated and cowardly , henry worked in the 1980s on a alternative comedy film circle .
the first series of steering wheel lenny henry show was broadcast in 1984 and in the 1990s he was one of the most successful chefs of the group , garth blacklock .
advertising , documentary films , tv shows , and other films are the main characteristics of his next decade , but after his bronze series lennyhenry.tv 2008 , he thought he was : &quot; what do you do next ?
after that , a documentary series for radio 4 came with the title : what &apos;s so great about ... ?
the first consequence was that the first part was about shakespeare .
on shakespeare , the first time i was allergic to shakespeare was in the first place .
i had the opportunity to attend school , but i was not able to keep it up to date .
so i had great fear of it .
all who have been in favour of the show are invited to take part in the show , peter hall , trevor nunn , adrian lecter , judi dench said &quot; you should try it .
do not worry , we will be able to make a good deal of money .
nimm a few of the words in the mouth , and then you will be able to understand why we all have shakespeare so loving .
henry led 20 lines of the otto loto last speech for the documentary on and he was enthusiastic .
i had the feeling that the commission was able to do this .
it was almost as if the council had given me the head up properly .
&quot; that is what it is all about , it is a serious matter , take it seriously , learn your text , research , and make a little more searchable .
the probe was brutal , and i read this piece monthly .
and it was a success .
you seemed to have a car accident , but you were not .
and soon he joined the band .
suddenly , the first time i was in the national theatre , i could hardly believe it .
as a result , there was a moment when i thought that &apos; oh , you have changed you &apos; .
it was a technical error and henry felt that the game was not working properly .
&quot; a small voice said to me &quot; you must now be 10 minutes bridging , while you are on the computer repair &quot; .
instead , the bush administration ’ s stage leader , mr president , announced that it would continue to do so as soon as the problem was resolved .
i went from the stage and ironically from the stage .
i am not in favour of this .
i can only say that to someone else .
&quot; you play in a theatre style , you play in a theatre , so stay in your role . &quot;
henry in fences on duchess theatre , the first of the two , was a great writer and a great writer .
the text for windows is not a simple text .
panik is very good , the commission is very keen to do so .
the european parliament also came up well , so it is like a big shield of the gods who tell me &apos; that is your determination &apos; .
he says so , of course , with a donnnous voice .
so i remain convinced that this is the case .
i love the really .
i love to be in a probe room , but i don &apos;t know what to do .
henry has also always said that he is not a comedian - our conversation is of humorous eruptions , while he keeps on imitating people .
i have decided to not take stand ups , but i am sure that the commission will be able to do this type of immediate satisfaction .
if you want to do this forever , you go on to a wall .
i am in favour of the use of the internet as a means of communication , but i am not in favour of it as much as i have done in the past .
i wonder whether he would agree with me if he ever had a stand-up comedy tour .
the fun , the fun i have in a room with a director , is the same as the fun i have in the middle , the end of a journey .
is this a good thing , then , about the new incarnation ?
i think that is the case .
i am happy to be an actor .
it makes fun .
it is said that the history of the country is great .
i love stories , but i don &apos;t know what i am talking about .
the people love stories and stories .
huthi rebels are blocking roads in yemen &apos;s capital , yemen &apos;s capital , yemen &apos;s capital , yemen &apos;s capital , yemen &apos;s capital , and its capital , the city .
in the conflict between the shiite hutu and the sunni insurgents , the government of yemeni has been forced to commit civil unobedience in the capital of sanaa .
huthi supporters would have been able to find central streets in sanaa on monday , said a spokesman for the hutu party &quot; ansar allah &quot; .
the commission &apos;s access to parliament is also blocked .
jemenitian media report that a transport accident occurred in the capital .
after the commission &apos;s online edition of the yemen post , the dutch newspaper hutu had a very good chance to get a good deal of money on sunday evening .
huthi drohte was , according to the bull , threatened to escalate the conflict , if his demands were not met .
the rail system in the shia hutus is fighting for more independence from the sunni ruled yemen and demanding the resignation of the government .
the volkstamm of the huthi has been besieging yemeni capital for just under two weeks .
around 30,000 rebels have protested , and they have been killed by protests on the major roads of sanaa .
in the surrounding area , there are always bloody battles with the yemeni army .
kenya registered its civil servants to &quot; violate the ghost workers &quot; .
kenya has thus begun to use all government officials biometric to register , and it is now time to register ghost workers from the country &apos;s pay lists .
employees who are committed to the development of the company in the next two weeks would no longer be paid , but a government communication was available .
the government is suspecting that thousands of people are still being held in prison after their departure .
president ushchenko knows that he is not going to be a man of the past when he takes office in 2013 .
in the event of an examination at the beginning of this year , it was found that at least 1 million $ ( 700,000 £ ) per month in payments for ghost employees and other abusive financial practices were lost .
the government is suspecting that salaries are still paid on accounts that are not available .
all officials must now be able to work in the next two weeks at identification centres to ensure that they are able to keep their data on the biometric registrations , have been informed in a government message .
all who have done this without a credible and credible excuse would be taken by the salary list .
&quot; by this approach , much to rationalize public service , which is the real and the most effective number of officials , and also to reduce the pay list on both levels of government .
the scandal surrounding the art consultant , helge achenbach , will be the first time in court on 11 november .
five eras from berthold albrecht , son of the aldi-founder theo albrecht , demand a “ new ” approach to the civil process at the düsseldorf landgericht 19.4 million euro .
the partial result was a court ruling that was not possible on monday .
in the class of the &quot; the &quot; who is the man who is the man who is the man who is the man who is the man who is the man who is the man who is the man ?
this makes it possible to achieve the commission that has been agreed upon .
aachenbach has been working for eur 121 million in precious objects for albrecht .
children need roots and a sense of belonging .
44 years ago he was in the school service , 23 of them were classed as a school leader .
for this time , manfred richter knows many revered petershausers and collaborators from their time as students .
his methods were sometimes unconventional , but he was always worn by his quest to be the pupil of man .
the snow conditions in the mountains are the most famous in the giant mountains .
manfred richter loves the painting of the painter with the motif from his homeland .
judges were born in 1930 in trautenau / north bohemia , today trutnov .
the first time he was interested in the subject of the study of the art of the arts , he was 14 .
a year later , the sudeten germans were dismissed .
binder is able to send the data to the family within half an hour .
after a few months in a camp , the war went to bavaria in 1946 - the freight wagon .
for example , the world &apos;s judges hired the senior army &apos;s senkendorf .
the teachers &apos; training took place in bamberg .
this was due to the fact that manfred richter had to return to the nearest station six times a week , to the next train station , three kilometres across the city , to school and in the evening back .
after two months of receiving manfred richter in a red cross case , in baghdad , he got a sleeping opportunity : together with up to 15 students in a sleeping room .
in 1951 he made his first and 1954 after three years of lehramtsanwärter the second state examen .
as the first time in his life he had to work in the school , he was forced to leave for upper bavaria and came to germany on november 1 , 1954 .
the &quot; fäulinen-zimmer &quot; was his first &quot; service flat &quot; in the school house .
in 1958 , he referred to the construction of a new teacher &apos;s house next to the school as a three-room service flat .
this house bought the manfred richter 1980 , after the school in kollbach started disbanding in 1968 .
until then , there were no problems in the school association petersburg , which had been in operation for three classes in petershausen .
from the school year 1968 / 68 , the children were born in petershausen in the present town hall .
as the school association indersdorf was founded , the school was only the foundation school in the village .
to join the backgrounding in the now smaller school , the commission changed its name to the former rector georg sigl after karlsfeld - and manfred richter was his successor .
but petershausen grew up , and so we could not afford to pay off their teachers in september 1982 .
manfred richter praise the straightforward generosity of the mayor ludwig götz , who was elected to the municipal council and to be a member of the parliament in 1997 .
&quot; civil master götz was very school-friendly &quot; , remembered judges grateful .
in his entire career , he has worked with judge benjamin sisko to make the speech of a government representative who was on a school council meeting on justice and law .
&quot; you have to tell the children two things : roots and the wings &quot; , says the current 84-year-old .
and he had to learn : &quot; this is not always possible &quot; , and whether he only has his students or his own six children , he is not quite clear .
in any case , richard nixon &apos;s actions were sometimes unconventional .
if students are looking for a job , they were given not a job , but a job .
on the cost of the municipality , judges had two pairs of boots and let the two contrasting men face each other , even if they were a vile hero .
for the sake of the school , judges had been a good relationship with the then mayor ludwig götz ( csu ) .
this moving and intuitive judge after his retirement led to the idea of a european arrest warrant , at least as the last one on the csu list in 1996 .
but judges were ranked six .

the hotel is also a perfect place for promotional chef tobias hagen , who has been working as a tour manager since the first hr4 tour 2004 , to be brief , after all he had plenty of experience with the technology on site .

with rona fairhead , the bbbc may have the great director , who has been able to find .
you will be hit with a proud glorious dragon from the banking world , the media management and the inner circle of the tory party .
and they have their own front-page experience .
your career will start at the world ’ s management consulting firm bain and co . , which you can count on to morgan stanley , bombadier , ici , and the media world of pearson .
you have been seven years old as chairman of the financial times , and you have returned to your office as the chief executive officer of pearson ’ s parent company .
your absence from the commission was allegedly nearly eur 1 million .
the hotel is also well placed for its political rankings .
you have been invited to david cameron by lord brown , the former chairman of bp .

the first european council in may , i described the task of the chairman with a poisoned cellar .
not only is the bse crisis a priority , but it is also a huge and complex entity in the heart of public life .
the confidence is having a positive effect on two fronts : internal on the first guard of its own management hierarchy in the bbc , but also externally as the voice of public concern and anxiety when things are wrong .
the result is a fast and untenable duopoly , which is not possible after a complete reform .
but what new leader will be elected would be risking being a leader ?
it is a difficult task .
and as if that were not enough , we are still a lot interested in the bbbc verkleiniert zu sehen - power , money and status outdated .
during the competition , the competition is getting closer and new technologies are opening up old , comfortable collateral , the time to negotiate the licensing fees for the bbc is very risky .
for the modest amount of eur 145.7 million , the commission is buying a new car in the uk , which is certainly the largest media company in the world .
the bse crisis has shown that the european union is not a single country , but a whole host of other countries are only 40 pence per day .
and annoying that the barbaric is rising on the popular scene , the bbc is once again rising : 53 % support it today , compared to 31 % 10 years ago .
the longing and usage habits for the bbbc have changed .
but they remain a very mixed group .
you need a reference point , a reference point , i hope you have found .

this vacuum is a cause for a public complaint from a left-wing government .

the london summit of real estate agents is a unique opportunity to take a look at the recent financial crisis .
new data of the bank of england from monday show a decline in mortgage lending in the united kingdom in july , which also indicates that the bank ’ s real estate market has been cooled down .
haptions international , a different real estate agency , corrected its foresight for the rise in real estate prices in london for 2015 .
the transaction code is based on the most expensive areas of london , such as chelsea , mayfair and kensington .

the photos , which were originally on the photo sharing site , 4chan , were taken in the same way as the pictures were taken in a hole in the online storage system icloud of apple .

confront the fact that we are now beginning to fight for the right to speak .
buzzfeed reported that the debian project team had been working on the late sunday afternoon to make a pope &apos;s speech , ariana grande .
exclusive service for the first time in the world .
you are breaking up , so i could not believe it .
the commission sometimes said that it was a woman who was too serious , exhausting , intense , distanced and perhaps a little more scratchy .
and protects the water from the sun .
kratom brushes kann er .
he was a stalemate , as in igel , yes .
the last victim of this stalemate was a straight companion of the soviet union , which was promising .
ailingua solomons was a zippy zarte beauty with untamed and hairs and a flattering heart from a village on the northisland , which even had been a remote and ruthless place .
you have been with an older companion to the south , the kevern for your aunt , and which is a plot in a damp but paradisiacal valley with the apt name paradise valley .
the hotel has been under no illusion for several years .
the route is very easy to reach , and the water is very good .
it was like the house from a child &apos;s fairy tale , both threatening and tempting to build a garden full of secrets .

the shortlist is displayed in the next week .
kvern had a problem with ailinn dealer on the broken bow .
your feet are not too big .
due to their own aggressive nature , songs of this kind were no longer released on the console .
not forbidden - nothing was so correctly prohibited - simply not played .
it was successfully obsolete , but it was not the word obsolete .
the general taste of the game was what to do and what rules were never able to achieve , and how people were able to use vom tellurische zum-zum-memoirs , kochs and liebe-books .
in the euphoria of the day , kevern began to create an imaginary piano .
ailingua verwaltung did not understand this .
&quot; the first time i was in the studio , i was in the studio and i was very happy with the result .
the result was that his father had always done to keep letter j .
it had been a game between him and his father , but when he was still small .
his father had it with his own father .
if you have a word with a j , you can do it without two fingers over your lips .
it was a very difficult subject to talk about at the time , and it was also not very funny now .
he knew that the us military would do so , and he was right .
it had to explain what jazz was .
ailingua had a long tradition of teaching .
jazz was , even though he was not directly banned , not played .
the impressive performance of the dj was not a lot more modern .
it was only space for a single room &quot; if &quot; in life .
the people wanted to be involved in the early part of a melody , where they would end up .
similarly , the mind .
his unpredictable nature made the people nervous .
and jacques and his music was musically expressed in mind .
although he was ten years old , he was not a member of the team from saddy davis junior , he knew that he was a little bit more about jazz than the half-secret collection of old cds of his father .
but at least we had to fight aids , not to say that fats knew waller black .
in its age , she could probably not remember a time when she was a popsänger not black , but a little bit of black .
once again , the idea was not to legislate or impose constraints .
a conformity society meant that the people of the region were grateful to the principle of group gifts .
people with afro-caries are often the victims of temperament and physical construction for underwater and sports .
people who have originally been driven by indian sub-continent are now being treated as if they were by nature with electronic talent .
what is still required of the polish community is the fact that the polish government has taken care of the sewage system , which is left by the greeks .
those from the gulf states and the levante , whose major parents are the country not to be quickly left than was the case when it was done , are now being forced to leave because of fear of humiliation .
each one according to his abilities .
as they only balance , they were not fit for the purpose of being a ballad , and they were not able to understand the insulting words that kevern had just heard .
music was the expression of love .
&quot; the people are not really offended , but they said kevern .
in addition to perhaps people whose feet are too big , the world is not always ready .
my father has never ever seen anyone insulted , but he loved the game .
he represents the people who are the victims of the crime , and he is the only one who has the right to be treated as a human being .
nothing could be further from the sound insulation of the huge coal industry .
ailingua verwaltung still does not understand .
why would your father have such a thing to love ?
he wanted to say that it is a jux , do not hesitate to write in your presence .
you thought that the commission had already thought that it would be somewhat strange .
&quot; it appeared to him lustful to &quot; said he instead .
you are shaking the odd and the wrong people .
it was a very good day for us all to see that your unflinched race had been a success .
it was not a problem , but it was a problem .
&quot; if you don &apos;t like it , &quot; do not be convinced .
but that explains why the commission is not doing it to me .
you seemed to be honest with them .
are my feet tired ?
he saw a new way .
your feet are as direct not .
perhaps your knees are the best , a little bit ...
and you saw that the people of the world hate me because my ankles were too thick ?
you hated ?
of course i hate you not .
the first thing that i would like to say is that this is just the foolish song .
he would have been able to say &quot; i love you &quot; , but for that it was still too early .
&quot; your disks are thick and the same as the reason why you have like me .
i am not a bit disappointed .
the klang was not right .
it had komikh to be .
if he tried to get komikh , he brought the other two to trouble , because he was like his father , not over the soothing charm .
perhaps i wanted to have a cruel father too .
perhaps i wanted to say kevern , that is .
despite its friendly eyes .
ailingua solomons was born in the netherlands in the year 1945 and was born in the netherlands in 1945 .
holunderblütten , so trunkenheit was not an excuse for him .
in its pathological excitation , it seemed to tremble , as palmwedel in the storm .
&quot; and your dildo , is exactly the reason why you have chosen me perverse .
in addition to being a little unhappy with that .
you did it sorrow , both because of the unnecessary inconvenience of his words and the fear that he was in their eyes .

you had given him not the life on the cold planet to the north , but the life of the island was not so great .
the same huge amount of ice cream is found in the area of the island , as there is on the shore .
the same comparisons are being made between men , with even more thick skin and wound , after what happened .

the latter would have given her a big fist if she had not packed up !
you only knutschen - knutschen was this most frequently used word for a erotic anchor power between men and women , a counter-poison to the nest of songs .
after kverns , the word was an unnecessary and unnecessarily refining , because the crutch itself had already been an act of violence .
ailingua solomons announced to him by her body a sign to go .
he told us that he had been in the loving chair as an old man .
you felt like a woman , and you could not imagine the force of her grief .
the reason for this was not the end of the world .
you knew the idea of a new european union .
you saw him at the same time as he was distant - as was from a room in the upper floor her companion met him - a man who decided to take a shower through something he herself .
aadam leaves the garden , dared to .
you felt like a sudden pain , for him and men in general , although some of your hands are raised against them .
a man turned to the police , and the police were praying his back , and he was defeated , without fighting , without any means of reprisals , and so on .
as they were alone , they looked at the other side of the car , and they looked at the other side .
etching a number of years before the recent events in the united states , esme nussbaum worked , an intelligent and enthusiastic 32-year-old researcher on behalf of ofnow , the non-legislative surveillance officer .
&quot; it was already a lot of done , and much still needs to be done , &quot; wrote them , &quot; to make the innate aggressiveness of a people that has fought a thousand wars and destroyed most of them , especially in the wars .
but some features are not as unbalanced as the camera &apos;s image is .
the higher the cherry tower , the more it seems that the lower the passion for the church .
the population winds up when listening sentimental balladen , beats up on stories and is not surprised by the difficulties that exist .
&quot; you have a misfortune to be a superpower , &quot; he said .
i propose that we should not just talk about novels .
esme nussbaum sends its head .
i must also ask : are you atheist ?
&quot; i believe that the european union must not be a mere spectator , &quot; he replied .
are you a lesbian ?
once again , the european union has been involved in the right to privacy and refusal to say anything .
feministin ?
once again , silence .
&quot; i wonder what i am saying , &quot; luther rabinowitz , after all , &quot; because i am against atheism , lesbian or feminism .
the problem here is a prejudice , not a job .
we are a prejudice to the free society .
but certain types of hyper sensitivity , which is in itself absolutely acceptable and commendable , can be occasionally results , such as they have presented .
you yourself have clearly shown prejudice against the church , and these things that you consider to be &apos; obstructive &apos; and &apos; roh &apos; are likely to be taken as seriously by others as an expression of natural strength and vitality .
if you continue on the herring road , you will be able to see what has happened , when it happened , as if it were , yesterday .
esme nussbaum saw himself as a child , while rabinowitz spoke .
behind his head , he repeated an led writer , in flamingorosa , the advice that ofnow gave to the country in the last quarter or more .
läulen sie ihre neighbour an , werden sie ihre partner , hear balladen , visit musicals , use your phone , speak , explain , listen to them , vote , excuse me .
talk is better than silence .
&quot; i understand absolutely that the point you are looking for is &quot; answered esme nussbaum with a calm voice , as she was sure that the word she was her superior was to end , &quot; and i say nothing else , except that we should be .
my concern is that the commission is not prepared to take any action without warning .
this time , it is not the other , but the others that we are interested in .
luther rabinowitz formulated a new form of pyramid with the hands .
to make a closer look at the situation , we need to be patient .
&quot; you go to far , &quot; said he , &quot; if you do acts as &quot; errors &quot; , he said that our grandparents may or may not have committed .
you are also going too far in your assuming that the directive will have its &apos; anger &apos; and your &apos; mistrust &apos; on &apos; other &apos; .
it should be no use to have someone in a position to be reminded that the european union is a community of values in terms of understanding the past and the present .
it was not a &apos; we &apos; and there was no &apos; other &apos; .
it was a time of uncertainty and i think that is all that we know .
&quot; from the one who we honestly say to ourselves , &quot; dared esme to throw &quot; no part of society claim that the world is behaving well .
i kiss no one in .
whether it is bad or good , the commission has done what it has done .
the reason was that .
this requires nothing more to be said - we are all agreed on that .
and that is exactly how no blame is to be assigned , and no blame must be tied .
but at what point is the past served if we do not learn from it - and this is what we are learning from - and we are not learning from it - and we are not learning from it - that we are not learning from it - ?
the past serves to make the future more forgotten .
if i have something to say on this - and i am not going to say anything about it - i am not going to say anything about it - i am not going to say anything about it - i am not going to say anything about it - i am not about it .
luther rabinowitz left his pyramid in the dark .
&quot; i will be supporting your report , &quot; he said , and leaving it .
on the next day , when you were as usual to work , the woman was killed by a motorcyclist who , as passangers have described , was in a kind of &apos; brutal rage &apos; .
first of all , there are random numbers .
lesotho military member says that the country is not allowed to hold a coup ; prime minister remains in south africa , and prime minister remains in south africa .
official officials of the military in lesotho argued that the military had a coup to overthrow the government .
prime minister thomas thabane fled from the country and told us that he was in the country &apos;s army and that he was going to be building government buildings in the capital of maseru .
the premium service provided its family with the property , which is adjacent to south africa , after he had reported threats of attacks .
military spokesmen , major ntlele ntoi said that there was de facto no coup d &apos;état , but that the military was prepared to respond to the threat posed by &quot; political fanatics . &quot;
&quot; what is happening this morning is a very serious problem for the defence forces of lesotho .
the south african government spokesman , clayson monyela , said that the military action has not given the impression of a storm .
&quot; even if no one has claimed that the government is acting by force , it is still the government that is all the reports that the activities of the defence forces in lesotho have been indicative of a coup d &apos;état . &quot;
speakers from the military have been in the region of lesotho to say that the soldiers were in their cake and that they were not allowed to get into the capital .
in the meantime , the council vice-president of the european parliament , mr mothetjoya metsing , is in charge of government during thabanes ’ absence .
thabane told me that he had been convinced that he was being tortured for his attempt to combat corruption in the country .
in lesotho there were many people who have been in the process since june , after thabane &apos;s parliamentary sessions have been closed because of the disputes in his single government .
he said that his actions had the government not signed up to , otherwise the people &apos;s accusations would have been unfounded .
production in the euro area on a 13-month low
the rise in the production of the euro area is slowing down in august to the lowest level in the last 13 months , so a very observed increase in the rate of inflation .
the final marker shopping manager entry is published on the website of the company .
a specification over 50 gives an expansion .
new orders are expected to be placed and factories have been experiencing breakdowns in a time of rising tension between the eu and russia over ukraine .
the figures are particularly worrying before the european central bank meeting ( ecb ) on thursday .
the markets expect the commission to take a clear plan for dealing with a tariff cut in the eurozone , and for the impending deflation of a rate of inflation of only 0.3 % .
it is speculative that the us dollar ’ s head , mario draghi , has been in the chair of the ecb this week to provide further information as to whether he wants to facilitate quantitative easing for the eurozone , along with the united kingdom .
&quot; although a small growth is better than nothing , it is still the braking devices that have been driving the growth of the economic and geopolitical uncertainties for manufacturers that have been made clear , &quot; said rob dobson , chief economist .
the factory building was built in germany , the largest trading partner of russia in the eu , and was then rebuilt in the 11th months with 51.4 .
in the meantime , the number of cases of fraud in the second largest economy in the block , france , the pmi , fell to 46.9 .
france remains a sort of troublemaker , as does the decline of italy from a solid exchange-rate expansion to a stagnation .
references to the fact that growth stimuli in the key index are not necessarily a problem for germany and spain and the netherlands are not enough .
the decline in industry is fuelling the fire of analysts , who continue to use monetary or fiscal stimulus to stimulate .
a positive message came from the republic of ireland , where the pmi has been reduced to 57.3 , the highest level since the end of 1999 .
howard archer , chief executive officer of the united nations , said : “ we are not a party to the current crisis .
he added that the commission is not responsible for the &apos; producers in the euro area &apos; at present , as the current increased geopolitical tensions - particularly in relation to russia and ukraine - are uncertainties in the still difficult conditions in many countries .
this increased investment in uncertainty is having a clear impact on the economy - especially as regards the confidence of consumers , and leads , perhaps , to some emerging markets being delayed or even cancelled .
he said that the only thing that is more and more likely is that the ecb will eventually be a kind of qe .
the highlight of the decade of the survivors of beslan : ten years have passed since the terrible siege of the school .
before the european union was founded , more than 1,000 people were killed by chechen militias in a school in beslan in southern russia .
more than 330 people , more than half of them children , were killed in the three-day martyrdom , that the world shocked .
we are still looking for beslan , where we have some of the victims .
that is exactly a decade after the appalling siege of the school of beslan , in which 334 people were killed , including 186 children , warned the heroic transgressors of last night about a new apocalyptic .
as a fanatical islamist terrorist , children and parents on 1 september 2004 , the beginning of a new school year , the country ’ s leaders took captive and killed .
the tragedy of the tragedy unites west and east in abhorrent terms , and transformed itself into a surprisingly different world of action and hope for the future in the midst of the worst misery .
ten years later , we are still in beslan , and we are now resigning some of the victims who have died in the abomination in the classroom .
we found surprisingly young people who were reluctant to resist , even though the memory of this terrorist hell was always trumpeted .
your greatest hope ?
the fact that the war that has now struck ukraine - and in which children and young people are dying - is now coming to an end .
the girl who was killed in trying to get her hands on the ceremony was a very young girl .

it is quite confusing that aida sought to her mother larissa , now 40 years old .
both were designed for dead and the two were overlived .
&quot; a woman said to me , i should ask for my life , but i could not , &quot; said aida at the time .
my legs were bloodstream , and i was not able to get them to sleep .

a solar panel made it into safety .
after a number of operations , the group was held to be completely healed , but yesterday said : &quot; three months ago , the pain returned .
i fear that the commission is not going to be able to do anything else .
some granatsplit and other granatorial sites are still in my knee .
your goal is to make the dental practice as easy as possible .
&quot; this tragedy is changing the life of my life , but it did not broke me , &quot; she says combat flight .
&quot; the first time i was in the studio , i was told that i had to do this and i cannot change it .
once a year i go on a journey to the sport hall to get to know the people who live there .
my friends and i try to participate in other days not to talk about this .
the pain of this is too great .
my best friend , i am sure , and i will be back in the class dzera gapoeva .
we played the game together when we were small , and dreamed of being a little bit like a school .
&quot; i want to not marry until i have completed my studies and my career is complete .
the hotel is located in the heart of the city , close to the main shopping street .
you say that the commission &apos;s siege is always a part of it , although the memory of the event is somewhat weak each year .
i am glad that the commission has been able to count on many people in the world to remember our horrors and we are so grateful for the help we have received from people in britain and everywhere .
if i can order the photo of me online , how i can go back to school , i think i can do a lot of people to see it for the first time , understand our disaster and help to prevent this happening again .
the young , who was killed by the ball hook , was in the opinion that his mother was dead .
it was his first school day ( ruins go with 7 years in the school ) and took over the school thirty-three days .
as sieben-year-old he said : &quot; mama told me i should not be allowed to go if it was an explosion .
after a explosion , the ship thought it would die .
you said to him : &quot; run . &quot;
full of fear , you can be dead , flee to the city and saw the next wine-making infant , taking it with the hand and flew through a cake hammer .
his father knew that he had been a member of the family since the end of the 19th century .
he said : &apos; i could not see them save . &apos;
in reality , tamara was out there , but the people were not happy with leg injuries in the hospital .
after your reunification , she said : &apos; i wept with joy .
i could not do it .
he ranked herin and surrounded the city of the city .
damir was later transferred to london to work with the british army , which has now been dissolved .
&quot; this horror is not only a scourge , but i would like to see it remembered that &quot; said he yesterday .
but i can say that i am not talking about the same thing in my memory .
i know that the commission is directly following this , and i will be presenting all my toys .
but now i can use computer games with shooting scenes .
&quot; i have no fear of being in the sports hall .
i remember the time when i was a child of the same family .
we say never that we want them to be killed or killed .
we say that we need to be able to offer you a wide range of sports and recreational activities .
i remember the time when i was in the united kingdom , especially when i was a game shop , where i was looking for everything .
but now the council is afraid of place like ukraine , where wars are the kind of unhappiness that can be fought and his friends suffered .
this horror is a horror that is taking you every day , but i would like to stop thinking about it .
&quot; it is a pity for me to all those who suffer from the abominations , &quot; said damir , the last week as a volunteer in a monastery .
i do not want to help that .
i do not want to go to the police one day and i hope that you will be able to attend the school school next year .
his mother tamara , 48 , said : &quot; 37 children from our neighbourhood , were killed , and the children can be the ones to imagine .
i remember the time when the european union was so terribly burdened , there was simply no children who were calling and roaming .
you are reminded of the great journey you have made to london with damir .
the people of london wept , when i saw our history , and they were all very happy .
i refer to the fact that people were looking for a way to help us to understand our feelings on the other side of the world .
you have been cherie blair and your foundation grateful for the prize and the opportunity to work in london in the autumn of 2004 .
i wish that the commissioner could give a speech to cherie and simply tell her that 10 years have passed since i was in the chair .
i remember the time when i was in the middle of the day , when i was there , i was very anxious to eat borschtsch and to smell them all over the local russian restaurants .
i remember the time when i was in kellern with a restaurant , when i was in the middle of the night with his water pistol and they were playing with the pistol .
and that was just a month after the horror of the earthquake .
i was surprised to hear that the british were so willing to accept our pain .
you said : &apos; i think always that the question of this world has been unbearable in these 10 years .
in the ukraine , the war is now continuing , and every day people die , and i believe that many children have been killed .
the first is the children of our children .
i think that the european union is a war for many .
i know that the commission is aware of what these people feel , the whole horror .
and i can not agree that the european parliament is not .
nothing has changed .
damir was great and is a very gentle and quiet man .
he is looking for not only for revenge , but for a better life .
i know that the council is not keen to recall that , but it has six close friends from the class and they are occasionally going to the sports hall and inflammatory candles there .
as he was smaller , he suffered from the fact - i remember the time when he was sometimes on the sofa - that he had to face us .
not sleeping , his eyes were open .
i remember the time when i was in the chair , he was all his weapons and other military toys , and he was now 17 , bigger than i , a guinea pig , intelligent and healthy .
i can hardly believe that the commission has spent a few hours so much on the safe side that it is dead and i have never seen it again .
as i was looking for a new home after the explosion and i was on my leg , i was looking at the hell around me , with all the torches around me .
i was absolutely certain that the commissioner was a little bit too helpless to survive in this hell .
&quot; i remember the time when i was a little bit anxious to him , &quot; he said .
but he has not heard it and he is a step away .
and so it goes on , in contrast to that of many others , for us .
george w. bush ’ s “ war on terror ” , 17 years after the fall of the berlin wall , was a popular election , was a popular election in the united states .
the young , whose terrible crime is to be found after the siege , as a symbol of the abomination of beslan , is now being held in prison .
troll : the beloved of the king of the kingdom , the son of the king , was born in beslan , after the siege in 2004 , and was sent to the right by georgij today .
his blood surge was a sign of the fear that he was being attacked for his life .
his image was one of the most shocking symbols of the barbarity of the beslain people .
his mother fatima , 54 , a medical doctor , had asked him for his first day of school , before he was los rushed , to leave his older son vladimir to university .
&quot; i promise that i will leave the farm for about two minutes before the terrorists stormed him , and so i stayed my little boy there for three terrible days alone , &quot; he remembers .
not quite alone , because there was a whole family of relatives of us , but they were all killed .
only my georgian country did manage to get the peace .
the closer this date is , the more difficult it is to find a way of thinking and thinking about it .
it is not a single day that the european union is not bound by this tragedy .
we think not , that it is long ago that i think we have been talking about it yesterday , but i think that it is now time to take a few moments to watch .
no one will ever forget that , the promise i give you .
the intrusion : the image of georgij ( left ) was one of the most shocking of the attack and was seen as a statue ( right ) eternal .
i remember the time when i was georgij , the president of the russian federation , was so keen to go to school that he said he would like to retreat his teacher .
i knew that the commission was not going to live until i was in the house .
and now there is even this statue of the weinende georgij in san marino .
george w. bush sees the picture not like , and it is not with us at home in the bookshelf .
i understand that , but i think that we should not forget the people of the world , thanks to this picture .
george w. bush says today : &quot; it is important to keep this something as it has never been done again .
&quot; i doubt that the commission will be able to make the truth .
the people are investigating such tragedies time and again and never get the truth .
and now we are looking at the crash of this boeing in ukraine .
will we ever be able to know what caused it ?
this world is becoming something terrible .
&quot; i can not understand why the system is possible , because if you do not ask people , no one wants to wage a war , so how is it ?
ten years have not been enough for such pain. it is a very difficult task .
we need dozens of years to make it a little bit forgotten .
it has my health and i have been feeling the pain of being in the air .
about three or four years of the commission , i had a few nightmares about the siege , but then it became better .
i went later in 2006 to the school again and had every day worried .
i thought that the answer was &apos; yes &apos; to my friends and classmates who were killed .
that is why i always go into the sports hall when the first september comes closer .
i do not want to use my old child friends to get a chance to do so .
it is hard for me to be in the sports hall , but i am not going to do so .
i feel very much obliged to the rapporteur not to be a victim , but this story is now part of my past .
i will not repeat it , but i doubt it .
my life goes on .
i have raised this year the school and visited the school for medical education in wroclaw .
i will be very happy to give you a warm surgery .
my first choice was a training in the army .
i wanted to have a soldier , but my health let that not be .
i wanted to say for my country , but that will not happen .
george w. bush ’ s latest report on the “ new economy ” of the united states , on the eve of the world economic crisis , in september 2008 , states that the us is the world ’ s largest economy .
the young , who survived , was a little too far from the foot of a murderous terrorist .
a miracle : george clooney , the president of the russian federation , was present during the siege to the feet of a murderous terrorist , but he managed to survive .
during the siege , he was able to visit the sports hall and sailed alongside the bomb , which was on the foot of a murderous terrorist .
it is really a miracle that the council is not killed .
&quot; we feel it , as if it were yesterday , that the world was not just a place for the secret services .
it is always a matter of concern to me that the commission is not doing anything .
i am now older than my age and people say that children are easily hit with bad experiences .
&quot; in 2006 i worked with psychologists and felt very well after that .
and i would like to forget .
in 2005 , the company was the first company to introduce the new product line .
i refer to the fact that i have lost consciousness .
i will never again go there .
moreover , survivors : georgij faniyev today , with a photo of himself in hospital after the siege on the laptop .
my pain is that i am not alone in having a good time .
my friends know that the commission is not keen on this or that i am asking you whether i am not at school .
physical , the way is good .
i should like to be careful with my injured knee , but i can now run well .
but because of my health i could not participate in the secret service academy of the fsb in saint petersburg .
i have my documents , even the medical records , and you have spoken .
my second passion is to work with animals , so i went to the veterinary institute .
i have a lot of experience there for two years .
he learns the treatment of all animals &quot; from cats to kittens &quot; .
he said : &apos; i knew that the european union was not going to tell my children about my experiences .

4 tips for your better accommodation in the best possible quality .
if you like to take photos or videos under water , there are a selection of devices .
the price of the option is a water thickness point plate .
i have taken these photos at a family party with several cameras , which are all part of the price of less than $ 350 .
regardless of the equipment , there is a few rules for the best results .
check the availability of your equipment twice .
the fact that you can use a water-tight camera makes sure that you have a good battery .
imagine the world of your camera on the photos or videos you want to record .
some cameras and camcorders have a scenarios and resolutions of up to 400x480 pixels .
and before you go into the water , check the water level in which the water level is functional .
some cameras are only available for up to 5 feet .
are you looking for a suitable partner for your business in our purchasing guide and for a digital camera for conventional and waterproof models .
make your own multiple recordings - because many do not fold .
point-and-shoot-cameras have a high resolution lcd , which allows you to compose images that are action-cam &apos;s normally not .
the fact that you have an lcd is still difficult to understand .
so let us make many recordings .
if your camera has a smooth operation , you can use it to capture a number of shots with slightly modified exposure settings .
stay tuned for the best results .
the light is drastically worse , the further it moves away from the surface .
if possible , stay informed about the latest news and events on the web .
this will allow you to select more color to your photos ; the deeper you go , the less color you will see .
go to distances between the objects and you will see the light blue sky .
the first is that it is a good advice on the ground , but it is all the more important because of the poor light conditions .
it is quite important that we have a proper and effective strategy to ensure that you have the most effective and most reliable power .
andrew lawson was a man of the sorte , whose character was changed when he was even in a gigantic organization like the nhs .
as a consultant , we offer a wide range of services for the field of anaesthesia , both for the sick and for the patient .
under his patients , he recalls the first time in his life a mi6 employee was working with the devastating effects of torture .
let us not forget that lawson was the only person who was diagnosed and diagnosed with disease , while the treated were mostly associated with something quite different .
one day in 2007 , the company was the one that was not yet able to take the passions .
&quot; i have been not feeling that i am &quot; wrote the book in may this year .
i had difficulty in getting up and getting to grips with it .
during the war with the flu similar symptoms , he was aware that the disease was not only a problem for his wife juliet , but also a problem for him .
&quot; i want to do everything immediately rather than later &quot; , he noted .
as a jew for a week on a business trip , he felt that he was not alone .
ironically , the report was based on the air .
he asked for a colleague to make a x-ray of the x-ray of his breast .
only a few weeks ago he was in the french alps for skiing .
the result of the x-ray inspection is a very good one .
he suffered from a bronchial , a discursive cancer that was not able to prevent breast fur , that is , the lungs , from attacking the lungs .
as with the majority of cancer cases , the disease is the most serious cause of death .
during the course of the day , some smokers are exposed to lung cancer , but not all of the lung cancer patients have previously been smokers .
but mesotheliom is different .
in almost all cases , the outlet is a asbestos load - contact with the fibre construction material once used as &quot; a miracle &quot; but has now been deemed fatal .
for the majority of us , mesotheliom is a disease that , as easily ignored , can be treated .
asbestos is , after all , a product of the past .
the dangerous trend is to use asbestos in britain since the 1960 ’ s , when the us industry voluntarily decided to use it .
the commission is also responsible for the implementation of the programme where it has been used .
as a company with an industrial risk from a different time , it seems to be almost more worrying today .
but this self-satisfaction is untimely .
britain , it seems , is experiencing a decline today .
it is more death than the number of people killed by mesothelioma here than in any other country in the world .
with a total of 2,500 deaths per year , twice as many people die from this disease as from road accidents .
annual reports on the mesothelioma deaths since 1980 and presumably future deaths from the uk are a sign of the european union &apos;s solidarity with the united kingdom .
the reason why the european union &apos;s deadly effects are now being felt , even though asbestos has been illegal for years ( 1999 , all asbestos types were banned ) is that a mesotheliom is only developing after decades .
and the scourge of mesotheliom is not limited to former workers of the construction industry .
asbestos was and is often still , in the houses , in which we live , the offices , in which we work , the schools , in which we learn and the shops that we are in .
and so the brass otheliom does not have class barriers , financial limits , professions or old ones .
the privileged position of the bastille , surrounded by elegant department stores in london , and private schools , is not a protective area .
the parliamentary buildings are asbestos contaminated .
the commission has also made a great deal of progress in hospitals where we are supposed to be healthy .
andrew lawson was not old .
he was also not a plumber .
it was not easy to find the right solution .
then , he found it out .
&quot; it looks as if the commission is in the tunnels , &quot; he said .
all - students , hospitals , doctors , doctors and nurses are welcome to use the tunisian facilities .
it is not clear how many of my old friends are interested in the same disease .
this question was not , unfortunately , able to answer at least partially .
&quot; from the four doctors , who have been working on the guy &apos;s hospital , the four were the most successful in the last five years on mesotheliom . &quot;
as many of us will have to suffer , we have to be able to do this .
in andrew lawson , mesotheliom was born at the age of 48 .
as he was elected to the european parliament on 17 february this year , he was 555. he was a member of the committee on foreign affairs and human rights , and he was 555. he was a member of the committee .
the reason for this was a very long time of life .
fifty per cent of all brass otheliostasis is dying in 8 months after diagnosis .
the disease ends with fatal diseases .
we cannot therefore vote for the report unless we have a clear answer to the question : &apos; how many of us will still be ill ? &apos;
the leading expert in britain , the british expert on mesothelioma , professor julian peto , suggests that there was a shortage of bronze between 1870 and 2050 when asbestos was expected to come to britain .
the majority of them have no access to the information they need at the moment .
a list of asbestos mines in quebec , canada alamy , alamy , alamy , alamy , canada , and the world &apos;s leading chemical company .
a short look at the actresses of the courts , to which the people concerned often refer for claims for damages , shows how far the scourge of the mesothelium is already spreading .
in june of this year , marks &amp; spencer announced , for example , that he would be prosecuted by janice for all illicit asbestos .
you worked nine years in the field of the chain , from 1978 to 1987 , and was responsible for the clothing department at two locations - one of them the flagship store in the netherlands .
mr. rs. all was only 18 years old when she was working at m &amp; s .
now the commission has two children in the 1920s .
&quot; before this thing , &quot; says she , &quot; had i never had heard of mesotheliom , i knew that she had not even heard anything about asbestos .
i would never have thought that i would have been interested in that .
it is only a few people who have a lot to say about asbestos .
the fact is that the term asbestos does not refer to a substance but to a group of six minerals .
the name rührt comes from the word &quot; asbestoform &quot; , a description of the fibre structure that resembles the fabric resilient and flexible .
three of the six were built in the construction industry .
chalet for sale in the area of algarve , portugal .
it was designed for roof panels , floor tiles , rohrisoldings , boilerisers , even for brake linings in cars .
it is less deadly than other asbestos forms , but it is still being used by the eu and the who as &apos; great health risk &apos; with possible death .
dangerous place is the place where the brown asbestos ( amosit ) and the blue asbestos ( krokydolith ) are .
britain was once the world ’ s largest importer of brown coal .
a member of marks &amp; spencer was born in the flagship store in the oxford street , london , asbestos alamy .
janice all has been working hard to be a typical mesotheliomopfer , but the work of julian is still a bit of a bit of a bit of a history .
he has a study by the interested parties , in which he shows that &apos; a significant proportion of mesothelium without known suspensions is generated by work or probably by asbestos contact in the environment &apos; .
a large part of these contacts are based on the &quot; normal use and aging of the products we produce .
it looks as if the commission can no longer assume that the european union will be safe .
a report by goddard consulting on the implementation of the palast of westminster .
in 2009 , the governor of the united states reported that goddard &apos;s service packs and pipes were falling behind parliament &apos;s committee rooms with asbestos , whose deadly fibres were replaced by something as harmless as &quot; strong air &quot; .
parliamentary members are often accused of being a victim of their own interests .
during the fsfe &apos;s directorate for parliamentary work insisted that the westminster palace was a &apos; clean health certificate &apos; , the commission is still not aware of the need to provide 1 billion £ of work over several years .
the governor of goddard also pointed out that the &apos; european parliament &apos; has a greater presence in the world than the one that is currently being applied in the member states .
no one can know whether this mismanagement will cost lives .
all that is needed is a political commitment to ensure that the process is completed .
a person who has not yet been able to contact asbestos is graham abbott , a general practitioner .
as andrew lambert said , the council of 50 years ago , the us is likely to be a “ patient ” during his work in hospitals .
&quot; i have been working in a hospital , in which asbestos complaints have been positive , &quot; he says .
it is so difficult to imagine the full range of places where the people of europe worked , and to remember the data .
what is he really interested in ?
he was 45 , and led just late in the evening an operation .
suddenly , the first shooting i had was .
it was quite suddenly that .
i felt that i was horrible .
i thought that the commission &apos;s trip home was no longer possible .
as a doctor , i knew that abbott was the cause of the pain from the chest , the skin around his lungs .
but how janice told everyone he had no reason to use a mesotheliom .
he went a month not to work .
the commission did not surprise me with x-rays , which were a source of panic , and did not use plaurakathether to extract fluid from the lungs and test it in the laboratory .
his complaints remained unresolved , however , without diagnosis .
his health is better than that , and he returned to the place where he was .
from time to time , the us ’ s symptoms have returned , often after sporting activity .
2011 saw a patient with a bott with similar symptoms in his practice and was later treated with mesotheliom .
but the commission has also now combined this not with its own case .
finally , his patient was a few decades older than his father and had direct contact with asbestos .
the connection to the internet was clear .
in september 2011 , the situation deteriorated in abbott ’ s state and his family doctor brought his ct-scans and x-ray images to an expert group .
in december 2011 , excerpt of the first world war , exactly two years after abbott was sick , a medical treatment facility equipped with a camera was put into the cave between the rib and the chest .
i am a optimist .
i am concerned about the fact that the commission is not here .
frankly , i had not expected to be so much worried .
but rakhel , ladies and gentlemen , was worried .
the result of the biopsy was the same week between christmas and new year .
graham abbott : diagnosis of mesotheliom
suddenly , the commission had a meeting with the mazmillan government hospital in brussels , which was supposed to have met him .
only now did he conceive the extent of the epidemic .
&quot; it turned out that the first time asbestos was widespread , especially in large public buildings , where rohs were often used with asbestos , &quot; he says .
the people who have been exposed to asbestos in these buildings are suffering from it .
and so it is mesotheliom that now meets younger people who are not in the typical professions .
the most dangerous routes are the ones with asbestos solids in hospitals , which were below earth , so patients probably were not exposed to the substance .
but many employees , who are in pedestrian tunnels , from a building to the other , ( as andrew lawson ) or in underground areas , are not aware of the fact that they are working in the same way .
it shows that the european union has been a major player in the field of health care for patients for several decades after the war , but life-threatening to treat the doctors .
he will also be here today .
students were able to present their bunsenbrenner on asbestos mats .
and it concerns not only hospitals .
asbestos is a very popular choice for people who want to live in a peaceful environment .
the school is also a good place to start .
indeed , many people have probably seen the first contact with asbestos in the classroom .
everywhere in the country , in thousands of chemical companies , the authorities have their bunsenburners on asbestos mats .
on websites , the subject of asbestos is now frequently raised in schools .
and the latter has so uninnocent items in our houses as foot-base plates or scalp eggs by default .
&quot; it is a industrial giant , a man who is in large parts of our property , &quot; he says .
in a case , the only contact that was one affected woman was the one who was abrigated by a garden snap in the 1970s .
so please adjust to the way you want to protect your garden shoes .
the impact of diagnosis , and this is something that we know is incurable , is not known .
&quot; it takes a while to get it to work , &quot; says graham abbott .
i went back to work and tried to get on .
i was two weeks in the practice .
then , i knew that the commission had to go and look after myself .
well , i &apos;m going to not give any more christmas party .
with the largest difficulty , the council &apos;s perspective was changed from the position of a doctor to that of a patient .
as i have heard many patients before him , he remembers how overpowered he is by all the information he has had to deal with .
&quot; it was very hard to get all this in , &quot; he says .
&quot; i asked the man who was going to be in the hospital for a long time &quot; .
and it was given me about 12 months .
i remember the time when i was in the middle of the day , i was not going to give a new christmas party .
the reason for this was that the commission was not prepared to accept the amendments . &quot;
mesotheliom is especially insidious , because it is our life saving mechanism - the atrocity itself - that it is not possible to prevent the deadly cancer .
the majority of cases of meteotheliom are caused by asbestos contact .
asbestos consists of smallest fibres .
if the asbestos is uploaded and the fathers are inhaled , we can rely on it in the chest , the skin around the lungs .
asbestos fibers irritate the chest and can cause cell mutations .
&quot; the problem arises with the inhaled nadelf-shaped asbestos fibres , &quot; says professor tom treasure , a heart-throat scientist , who was involved in the guy &apos;s hospital in 2001 .
that is precisely the hospital that we are talking about , mr lawson , that is supposed to have left him in asbestos , now is ironically , a leading centre for the treatment of mesothelioma .
choose the right font for your photo and then follow the instructions to use the image .
once the asbestos needles have reached the lung tissue , treasure says , &quot; they are taken from the breathing process to the edge where the skin is .
from nature , it is of great importance to invasive from the very beginning .
the usual options for other creatures are : the use of brass oils , the use of a bronze , the use of a bronze , the use of a bronze oxide , the use of a bronze .
the effectiveness of an operation is , for example , highly controversial .
some say that the commission has tried to make a difference .
choose the right font for your needs .
&quot; you can &apos;t use the chest coat , but you can &apos;t cut it .
you come with the knife not around .
derweis speaks of &quot; on chemotherapy not very well &quot; , &quot; the &quot; effect shows &quot; , but not heals .
&quot; sometimes there are boring long-term survivors , &quot; says treasure .
but at the end they all die .
fortunately , the majority of patients actually live long , much longer than expected .
the author stephen jay goould starb died 20 years after diagnosis .
two and a half years after his own diagnosis , graham abbott is still struggling .
after having been a brass theliom , he came to the united states and was in contact with andrew lawson , who was diagnosed four years after his diagnosis .
&quot; hello , creativity and innovation center , &quot; he turned to annotations of merry .
&quot; he was very positive , &quot; says abbott .
he had his diagnosis 4 years earlier .
originally , abbott had six chemotherapy cycles , and the first two were in operation for four months .
&quot; i was crazy , i was &quot; he says .
i wanted to give up .
let us not forget that lavson managed to &quot; put things in a more positive light &quot; .
after the consultation of several doctors , the commission decided to extend the scope of its treatment with prof. loic lang-lazdunski , cardiovascular specialist at the guy &apos;s hospital .
&quot; we had a advantage by having a lot of work done on the project , i called for a simple and easy way to get an appointment , &quot; says graham .
a normal user can use the same file to transfer the money to the recipient .
money is crucial to bronchio ’ s sufferers to maintain the best available therapies .
but if these treatments are eventually unavoidable , they will be a source of serious health problems for many people - over and above the future of families they leave .
and so we can contact you to the courts in the hope of compensation .
andrew lawson contacted the gentoo linux kernel team about the problem .
&quot; it is since 1898 known that the asbestos is extremely dangerous for health , &quot; says morgan .
but what is happening in the 1960 ’ s is not a matter of realizing that even a very small number of people are at risk of health .
and here i started to complain that companies were not doing enough .
andrew lawson and guy &apos;s are now in the team and they are looking for a solution .
after the investigation into his death , the council confirmed that he had not been able to make any changes to the asbestos fibres in the basement area concerned in the 1990s .
the reason for this was andrew lawson &apos;s late arrival .
as asbestos can be removed , it is possible to remove asbestos without using the same method as asbestos .
indeed , it is a matter of urgency for mesothelioma patients seeking compensation to be able to obtain a huge problem , namely the fatal contact of a company or a job .
many of their previous employers are sold or closed .
insurance documents can be lost .
and those who are not opposed to claims that are not being respected by the people who are fighting against them , but certainly not with the complainants .
as a result , there was a very clear new legislative initiative this year , which will allow messothelium patients to be better informed about compensation .
the law has a value of $ 1.7 billion promoted by the insurance industry .
in these cases , the classes of the plaintiffs receive 80 % of what a court can do in a normal process of damage compensation - about 120,000 £ .
about 300 successful drive applications for the programme will be submitted each year .
andrew morgan thinks like so many mesotheliom-affected people that 350 million £ a &quot; very good job &quot; of the insurance industry .
&quot; the first time i was in the world , i was in the united states , and i was very pleased with the results .
the same year , mike penning , the then working and retirement minister , also announced that the law &quot; does not perfect &quot; .
but both penning and morgan gave too much to expect in the face of seven deaths .
&quot; the people suffer so much and need more help today , &quot; said penning during the second hearing of the mesothelium law in december last year .
the following year , graham abbott was the first woman to be appointed professor of economics at the university of applied sciences in lazdunski .
after your first deliberations , the committee on legal affairs recommended that a surgery be carried out , which , unlike tom treacure , was a positive operation .
this was confirmed by a radiation therapy that was conducted by a chemotherapy - a triple therapy .
abbott feels that he has been strengthened .
&quot; the first thing i want to say is that it is the most important thing , &quot; abbott says .
the situation is still very clear in patients .
it is a bit of a question for you to continue .
if you are interested in the music , you can get a bit worse .
graham abbott signed the agreement in march 2012 , and the united nations security council ( un ) has been elected to the european parliament .
at the end of august he had the last of the six chemotherapy cycles behind him .
below you can find the latest news about the new version of the game .
then i had the opportunity to meet a scan in march 2014 .
it was a great day for us to have a good time .
i was just 50th of a year old , and i was born in the town of kissimmee , where i was born .
the first thing that is at stake is the fact that this is not a viable option .
the first step is to make sure that the children are able to live in a decent environment .
once again , the government of abbott undertook six chemotherapy cycles .
now it is not a trace of tumours that is visible .
but the incident was not physically and mentally correct .
you must be interested in practical things - about the money , if i am no longer , for example , or my wife show how the boilerzeithalt works .
if you are having bad news , you will be negative .
you must search for the future .

it is hard to know what is to be said and how much .
as i was my first diagnosis , i said to my girls that i was a sickness that i had not been able to get old with .
you have responded very differently .
tamsin is very healthy and has a lot of fun .

such discussions are somewhat prevalent in all cancer patients .
but for mesotheliologians , such discussions are not hopelessly pervasive , not a trace of hope for survival .

china refuses to grant hong kong the right to vote , demonstrators swear to the retaliation , and the chinese are threatening to retaliate .
on sunday , the european parliament decided , despite the increased number of calls for democratic reforms , to vote against the nomination of candidates for the 2017 elections by the hong kong electoral authority .
this approach is a source of presumably humiliating protests in hong kong .
the decision of the chinese people ’ s congress allows the communist leaders to make a fundamental choice of all non-peking candidates .
&quot; the only thing that comes out of the picture is that we are angry , &quot; said a legal expert , emily lau , chairman of the democratic party .
the first thing i want to say is that it was not what beijing promised .
it has been called the inhabitants of hong kong , and it is a very good idea to have a good time .
and it is clear that the only way we can deal with an authoritarian regime is to have a government .
in his defense of china ’ s decision , li fei , vice secretary-general of the standing committee of the national people ’ s congress , said that public nominations for hong kong ’ s government elections would be &apos; chaotic &apos; .
since 1997 , when britain was under control of hong kong , china has been a country that has been losing control of hong kong .
the chinese leadership presented a new way of thinking about sunday ’ s decision , because it was a democratic breakthrough for hong kong ’ s citizens , but the decision makes no sense either .
after a new clause , the only candidates to be &quot; with love for the country and love for hong kong &quot; will be &quot; allowed &quot; .
the decision follows a summer , in which some of the largest and most popular sports events in the world are held in hong kong for several years .
behind the prodemocratic campaign in hong kong , there is a occupy central with love and peace movement .
on sunday evening , the members of the european parliament met in brussels in a few hours after the announcement .
in the demonstration , the leaders of the international monetary fund said that their movement needed a new stage of civil disobedience and that they would protests in the coming weeks .
you made it clear , however , that the commission had not requested any details , and that it was apparently trying to avoid problems with the authorities .
in a online communication , the members of the organisers stated that the &quot; the best way to fill the district was to call the district of the central district , a move that was only possible if the district was all dialogues .
it is a pity to say that the commission is now in the process of being seized by all the opportunities for dialogue and that the occupation of the central district will be definitively taking place .
the authorities in hong kong are already working hard to find a solution to beijing &apos;s announcement that it will be a good thing to have a referendum on the beijing declaration on sunday before the government building .
the unrest in the region is exacerbated by the feeling of many in hong kong that they are slowly losing control of their city .

feministeens criticize racial and policing after ferguson
the unarmed conflict in teenagers was declared a national reserve by a police officer in ferguson , mo. the killings were carried out at the beginning of this month .
the participants were able to put their hands in the air and sang , &quot; hands high , not shoot , &quot; while they were in the waiting room .
after two weeks of work on the new version of the game , ferguson , mo , has been shocked by the unarmed teenager michael brown .
after your experience , weisses feminist commentators use the gender to the race , if it is a matter of reproductive rights and income inequality .
during the tensions in the middle west , however , and throughout the country , the country saw perez as a threat to the responses of white women by 100 % to the race .
in comparison to the answers black and white women shortly after the shots of 9 august , the personal essays were filled with titles such as &quot; thoughts on ferguson of a white woman &quot; and &quot; feminism is not only concerned about the women .
but for perez , the situation was an important change .
&quot; i believe not , that you can be in feminism many people who have the knowledge of this and are privileged in such high-class places .
the people felt that they were being forced to do something about the events that took place .
it is characteristic that the european union is experiencing a crisis of which we are all aware , and because the situation in ferguson is so ethnically that it must express it .
for english speaking students , the koritha mitchell of the ohio state university. ferguson brought out problems that black americans have to face every day , which are not considered as &apos; women &apos;s issues &apos; .
&quot; i can do something funny on facebook about me and my partner .
if i have something to say about how farbic the images are in your own country , i am sure that the silence is ears anaesthetic .
&quot; how can it be for women to be assured publicly about a relationship that is not just about security in the public sphere ? &quot; he asked .
for black and white women and mitchell , who have a race , sex and sexuality in the history of the usa , there is no dense , but between racial and sexual orientation problems .
for them , black and white women have not the luxury of being able to clean up the themes ; they live every day in the combined world .
during the white women are now the subjects of race and gender in the feminist mainstream media , the issue of women is being discussed by angela hattery , a professor of women and gender research at the george mason university .
&quot; between 1865 and 1890 , at least 10,000 black men were yellow women .
white and white women had to be involved in history to make the lynchmurder a justification .
for hattery , the division between the white and black women came at the point where the white women fought .
&quot; you met the people of the world who are fighting for women &apos;s right to vote , and the right to vote for black should come later , &quot; said hattery .
if you look at such things , you will see that you are a man of the dark , why white women are not dreadful .
we have our job in the past , and we have done it well .
we have never seen black women help to make their husbands and sons pay for their lives .
the commission has also made a commitment to the principle of equal opportunities for women , even after they were given the right to vote in 1920 .
the group was founded almost 40 years after the original request for help from the black women , says mitchell .
for lunch and dinner , the river is white , and the white feminist reactions to the events that ferguson raises - policing , race discrimination - are a mirror of time , in which white women are the main characters .
&quot; would it not be great if the commission &apos;s activists , who have such traditional feminist platforms , were to have the right to education for a child so seriously ?
feministeers of the second generation who have started their career in the fight for reproductive rights and access to contraception are now being forced to leave their country .
the famous white town of feminist activist gloria stäm went to the university of vienna two weeks after the shooting of michael brown .

the relationship between the police and the black community is not the only problem , that the police have to focus on mainstream feminism .

&quot; this is a good thing for themselves , &quot; said mercado .

on the markets , the market is falling , and the food supply is falling .

sehhofer had a lot of trouble with the road traffic in the cdu coalition because of toll criticism .
the left side sees the plans as a threat to the future , given the union ’ s dispute .
&quot; the murks-mauritius toll is dead , &quot; said party leader bernd riexinger of the &quot; new osnabrücker zeitung &quot; ( monday ) .
&quot; with the toll shut the minister fails &quot; . dobrindt wants a vignette obligation on all german roads .
as a result , domestic car owners can only be allowed to sell their cars in accordance with the coalition agreement .

genetics disorder often incorrectly diagnosed , and the patient is not diagnosed correctly .
a british woman says that she thought she was going to be diagnosed as a result of a misdiagnosis for many years .
karin rodgers lived in the city for nearly all her youth in the belief that she was only a few years away after she was married to another disease .
you will find that the situation was very different from the charcott marie-tooth disease ( cmt ) , a group of inherited disorders that could cause nerves outside the brain and the spinal cord .
chalice is a small town in the province of huelva , in the province of huelva , in the province of huelva .
about 23,000 people in the uk are presumably suffering from cmt , which causes motor disorders such as muscle weakness , an uncertain course and a crumbling dwarf .
erkan &apos;s sick children also suffer from deafness feelings or pain , and the disease is ill-health and progress. that means that the symptoms are not worse over time .
as a rodgers 13 , he believed that the world was in peace .
rodgers dared to use it in the wheelchair , before he was 18 , and before her 30th birthday , he would die .
the mother of two children , who are today 51 years old , said : &quot; when a child knew that i was a child , i was not able to do the same thing as the others .
i fell in love with the game and everything took me longer .
i could never agree with the other children rolling shoes or scapeboard and was in the school often because of my way to go and run .
rodgers said that the idea of a new school was to have a school education at the age of 13 .
&quot; i felt that i was guilty because i was curious .
as i said , i was not shocked and buried .
i thought that the commission had to accept amendment no 18 , but i was not able to do so .
i made the whole thing on my own with me and planned my own transport .
you said that when you had 17 , it was clear that you had the ability to use your skills that was not so much diminished as you had imagined and asked your doctor .
he was simply on , and replied that he would not be able to &quot; my love , i do not believe that you have that , otherwise you will be already in the wheelchair &quot; .
i believe that you have something much more to do with life threatening .
after a few genetic tests , a new cmt was found .
&quot; when he told me that he had not been able to understand cmt , i felt as if i was a winner , &quot; she said .

since almost ten years , the european union has been operating on the former military training place in münsingen .
nevertheless , the problem of the death of the people of iraq is still emerging every month .
the granates are sometimes still as dangerous as they are before the fire .
a oasis of earrings , a cry of hell , halls the sprays over the heart of the biosphere reserve .
in december 2004 , the european union ’ s last sharp shot fell on the troop training place in münsingen , which was completed after 110 years of military operation at the end of 2005 .
since that time , the 6500 hectare of the park has been the core of the biosphere reserve .
tax burden on business people in the washington area is rising with the economic recovery of the us economy .
a recovery in the economy means more customers , more sales and more new jobs .
you are also making higher taxes .
state and local authorities are not required to pay tax on domestic companies last year .
companies in the district , the maryland and virginia paid together 27.7 % of the total amount to government and local authorities in the 2013 financial year , an increase of 3.8 % compared to 2012 revenues .
the state and local government tax burden on companies increased by 10 % last year .
state taxes have increased more than the local taxes , and the government has increased by 4.3 % , according to the study carried out by the service agency .
more than half of the tax revenue of the district , 56 % , comes from the corporate tax , while 36 % of revenues are from maryland .
virginia achieves a turnover of 28 percent of the lowest tax revenue from companies .
a large part of the rise in the tax revenue is due to a recovery in real estate values for companies , say the researchers .
during a large part of these profits are from large countries such as california , new york , and texas , it seems that the process is also very difficult for washington .
companies in the district , maryland and virginia paid together for over eur 10 billion in government and local real estate taxes last year , compared to the sum of eur 9.6 billion in 2012 - an increase over a year .
but the apparent weakness in the housing value is not so great in maryland as in raising interest rates and localities .
companies in virginia and d.c. pay almost half their government and local tax .
&quot; in maryland , the following happens : a large part of the real estate , especially in the tax area around d.c. , is either owned by the government or by non-profit organizations that do not pay real estate taxes , &quot; douglas douglas managing director douglas lindale lindholm said .
maryland is therefore forced to move to , for example , the income tax system , which is much more important than the tax on services other countries offer .
the recent recovery in the tax revenues from companies can no longer be attributed solely to the recovery of the real estate market .
corporate governance and corporate governance also seem to be recovering , so the data .
companies in the region reported that the number of low-income tax benefits among government organizations has risen from $ 2.3 billion in comparison to $ 2.1 billion in 2012 .
maryland took 1 billion dollars to the company ’ s inputs .
during the trend of the past years , the company has grown to become a global leader in the field of tax , not just in the three places .
the anchor rate in the district was equal to the 4,3 percent increase in the national average , while the rise in maryland was significantly higher , 4.9 percent .
only virginia reported a subaverage growth in tax revenue of 4,1 percent .
virginia has a population of 6 % in all three areas of office .
the company tax rate in maryland is about 8,25 percent and in the district at relatively low rates .
a comparative study by the us chamber of commerce at the beginning of this year showed that virginia had lower government and local corporate taxes .
in the study , the district committee was not investigated .
despite the advantages , virginia is under pressure from its southern neighbour .
north carolina is a law on reducing its corporate tax rates in this year from 6.4 % to 6.9 % .
if the state continues to increase its income targets in the coming year , this law could reduce corporate incomes by up to 20 % by 2017 .
in the meantime , the commission seems to be able to help small businesses in the washington area , and they are therefore paying more government and local taxes , as the recent study shows .
corporate taxes , which are seen as personal income taxes by small businessmen , are not a transitional structure , according to which most small businesses are organised , in the district , maryland and virginia , grew by more than 20 % last year .
the formula for the research is that the trend and the rise in the number of corporate taxes throughout the country is likely to continue this year , with an increase in general multi-defence tax revenues for the state and local authorities .
nevertheless , the space of washington could be lagging behind if the prospects for spending cuts in the federal government were to focus on the labour market in the region .
partnerships with the german and european beer industry .
hops and malt - also in china a popular breed .
german law on beer has a high reputation in china .
frankfurt ’ s partner city in china wants to be a brewery and also hopes for an air direct connection between the two cities .
german law on beer , used for the production of beer in frankfurt ’ s partner city guangzhou – this is the urgent desire of the official chinese .
&quot; we would be very pleased if you would like to have a german brewery located in our city , &quot; said the vice party secretary of the south china metropolis , li yizwei , in this week at the visit of a spd .
whenever you have a question , the functionalist of the ruling communist party of china has come to this point of view during the course of the discussion .
guangdong is a city in the west of the country , and is the capital of the united states .
therefore , the member states have the power to buy , to make a commitment to german beer .
the hessen spd leader , thorsten schäfer-gümbel , who has supported the german political delegation , said to the host that he would be in germany after a possible partner for the project .
&quot; for bier needs a lot of beer : good water , grain and food joy &quot; , added the author of the &quot; mittadee &quot; lunch .
this way of life is already beating mr li , smiling his heart and making his way to the host .
the commission then met with a great deal of criticism from guangzhou , who was not allowed to take part in the debate , but with red wine , which was served at the meal .
the chinese brand tsinghagtao expands to german brewing art .
tsinghado-bier is produced according to the german purity law .
more business transactions and more business are needed .
a second wish of the chinese hosts would be an air direct connection between frankfurt and guangzhou .
the air hansa had the flight earlier than the one in 1945 , but for economic reasons it was cancelled .
&quot; it would be worth it again &quot; , showed himself the municipal politician convinced .
&quot; the business is conducted between our two cities and the traffic is increasing &quot; .
at present , travellers would have to travel via changsha in the province of hunan , complain li .
the commission &apos;s administration of guanacaste also , whose capital is guangzhou , is hoping for the airline link .
the vice-president of the commission , mr kallas , has been appointed to the board of directors of the province .
&quot; the first time i have had a good idea , &quot; he replied , &quot; schäfer-gümbel , chinese vice minister li jinjun , a german intimate connoisseur , was nodding .
the hotel is situated in the centre of the old town , in the heart of the old town , close to the old town and the old town .
the lighthouse is a beautiful place to stay , with a friendly atmosphere and a friendly atmosphere .
li yitwei was a member of the board of directors of the board of directors , but not yet in this role .
he came only in this year &apos;s office , after his predecessor was arrested for corruption charges .
the council of ministers of local political parties wan qinglian also had to go .
the commission &apos;s approach to the civil servants from guangzhou is part of a national campaign against corruption in party and administration , supported by the head of state xi jinping with harsh sanctions .
the new top politician li yiwei recently had a very difficult job to do before his party career for an american company , which is very unusual in china ’ s communist party .
before joining the commission , he was responsible for the political and economic consequences of the war .
frankfurt is officially more than a dozen cities in europe and the rest of the world .
the connection to the 9000 km long beach of guangzhou is one of those that has been blocked by both sides , for example by a student exchange .
in the past year , the 25-year existence of the german-chinese connection was celebrated .
the south china metropolis is located on the perl river with its economic power almost as strong as the heresen .
in the next year i want to build a gross domestic product of around 250 billion euros .
the family of joan rivers &quot; expresses the thumbs &quot; .
joan rivers is a member of the board of directors of the new york city since her arrival in a hospital three days ago , and her daughter was , however , hopeful today that the 81-year-old comitee was recovered .
&quot; thank you for your continued support for the new album , &quot; said meissa ricardo .
we are all pressing for the thumbs .
your mother was sources , according to sources , on thursday after an emergency because of a heart attack in a clinic on the upper east side , yorkville endoscopy .
the doctors are keeping you abreast of the situation and under close observation until you are satisfied with your condition .
the reactions came from many sides , including in the form of an overwhelming online support package .
environmental friendly dust collectors and rising fuel prices are a major factor in the success of the company .
for cars and dust collectors , which are now in the market , the rules of the directive will be stricter in future .
similar to cooling lubricants and washing machines , new dust collectors are given a new label from september 1st , on which the purchaser can place central data such as the energy efficiency of the device at a glance .
for new cars , the same rules apply in the pollutant class euro 6 .
in addition , there is more money for scaffolding builders : they receive a uniform minimum wage of 10.25 euros across the country .
amazon is buying twitch for 1.04 billion $ .
amazon is a registered trademark of amazon .
the announcement of the release comes as a surprise , not because nobody wants to take over twitch , but because it is widely believed that youtube is a tool that will be able to buy .
before three months , it looked as if the european council had been allowed to sell twitch to the video service of google for a cool billion-dollar cause , and cooperation seemed to be a natural one .
twitter , the first internet site in the world , was launched three years ago , as a general stream of news and news .
instead , it was quickly transformed into a platform for players who want to share their bravura pieces in games , a &quot; youtube &quot; for live games .
the twitch-interface .
and &apos; let &apos;s go and see what &apos;s going on in the video game .
it is not the case that youtube is a very popular video game when you use twitch .
it is a mystery that the commission &apos;s decree on yota does not make sense .
all that is needed in the current context is a new statement by emaret shear , president of twitch : &quot; we have been working for amazon .
a further secret of the hotel is , frankly , the incredible success of twitch .
for snowboarders like me , who explain that they prefer sport , than to watch , the situation is difficult to understand .
it is a matter of giving a friend a free lunch at 3 a.m.
all these games could be played right now .
a different problem is that the commission has not yet received many of the most popular games today , so it can be seen without its own control over the perspective of the game .
i admit that the commission is not in a position to be very quick about the rapid passages through which our electronic age is entering into full play in record time .
but as long as there is no game or humorvirtuosis , it is not possible to use its twitch channel as much as it is .
but what do skeptics like me know about this ?
twitter is supported by 55 million different visitors per month .
and how exactly does amazon intend to make money from this ?
it is hard to imagine how the european union could be a great place to live in amazon .
but twitch has something that is worth every company .
as the chairman of twitch , shear , said , amazon is not a twitch .
on the hill , you can see the castle festival , the most important event of the year .
the concept of the organisers agreed .
despite the strong growth in the rain , the weather on saturday evening was estimated to have been 1200 music fans .
at times , the invitational had to be stopped .
&quot; the first time i had to wait for the next album , &quot; said ron sem , one of the organisers .
salzwölden l licht und fun .
for two spanish words , we have maxim saxraj and ron sem .
because the open air in the saltwater valley burggarten is meant to be a brightness day and evening through various shows .
well , and the fun comes sowieso from alone .
the result was already clear at the early evening when the commission &apos;s first visitors were invited to the open air .
a festival for all generations had the organizers promised to .
and that is not what you have succeeded in doing .
around the clock , the power stations on the burggarten meadow had a lot of fun , but also guests from the surrounding and the surrounding area .
you pursued a policy of the first live performances in the uk , wiped the foot in the tact , enjoyed cool air drinks - just in short : relaxation pure and pleasure were declared .
and that quer by the generations .
during the last few years , some have been looking for blankets on the extra white sand on the beach bar , while others have been on a quarter of wine in the vinotheque labten , while others have been killed on the hills .
but the same applies to the children ’ s snapping .
the larger commercial users used the kickertables or participated in a skateboard workshop .
until the great revolt came .
in the early 17th century , the city was burned down by the visitors , especially families of the town .
but the attractive nature of the festival did this not leave a breakdown .
&quot; it came more people than expected &quot; , said ron sem , who was led by a &quot; success all over the line &quot; .
that is why i am not in favour of a repeat of the great party next year .
although the commission has no intention of changing the content and size of the event , sem has made a first assessment of sunday &apos;s performance against the popular vote .
as an annoying note , he called that in the meantime the admission was stolen .
obviously , the security firm was too little in the way of staff .
the result : some who are already paid , some who were not on the ground .
the resonance is very good , but the sound is very good .
in a first preliminary cautious estimate , the saltwater employee co-organizer spoke of about 1200 visitors who had been in the burggarten .
problems occurred in the implementation of sound .
the saltwater reef hip-hop band blocks`n`rox broke up because it was unnervt .
the technical experts were not able to find the correct half-way sensible compromise .
the planned measures for shisha lounges could not be built , because the tents were not equipped for tire loading because of a tyre pane .
&quot; in the next year you will be there &quot; , says the organizer .
the premium edition of the amula-open air. the first was from the number of visitors .
and that is the case with bad weather .
however , the organisers have made some mistakes , which could be corrected for the first time , but in the second edition , the number of errors must be eliminated .
the european union is also a social network of facebook , and the organizers must be critical .
&quot; sorry , but i &apos;m not yet in the euro 12 ! &quot; , said the author of the album melanie meier at the event page .
&quot; you have a lot of fun with me , &quot; says the ele zimmermann .
other people see the initial problems not quite as closely .
i think it is very good that some people are not just stupid , but that they are really trying to do something about their legs .
hats off ! &quot; , writes stephanie jenß to the amula .
now , the organizers have a year to decide on these criticisms .
new discount for the radom in berkum : watchtberg ’ s landmark shrink shrink your life .
the commission is expected to do this .
rather , the commission &apos;s ready part is waiting for the margin of construction to be used .
the action is in the context of a major measure : almost 50 years after the launch of the space observatory , tira , the shell , the so-called radom , is completely renewed .
the new radom will be equipped with a diameter of 47.5 meters a little less than the old one .
the size remains the same , however , and the world record remains .
the last step to refine the directive is to complete the existing cap .
the top of the city ’ s old hull is separated and is covered with a crane .
after that , the last quarter of the new shell is set up .
if the weather is playing , the hotel ’ s action should be on the stage at the beginning of this week .
partial participation in the conference is the ice-bucket-challenge .
isabele roberts from the uk wrote so much that he was eager to take up the ice when his ice cube was thrown over his head .
this ip address is used to send a message to the user .
a woman was brought to hospital and was then sent to the hospital .

drag the burgundian clubs to the table again soon ?
finally , there were repeated disagreements between the two clouds ’ houses in burgundy .
now we think of the management board as a possible cooperation .
as a model for the reconstruction of the wolfratshausen castle , the late richard wagner , who had died , led the former chairman of the wolfratshausen burgundian friends , to the french guédelon project .
i was in the middle of a year ago , when the burgverein and the burgfreunde wolfratshausen were not in a good climate .
the hotel is very different from the rest of the hotel , and the views of the wolfratshausen castle and the possible reconstruction of the old town were to be approached in a very different way .
now move to the two camps , and the two are supposed to be talking about a common approach soon .
the confirmation of the association &apos;s management board is torsten sjöberg ( burgverein ) and herbert piffl ( burgfreunde ) on request of our newspaper .
&quot; i have already written to mr piffl and he has proposed that we get together once &quot; , he reports .
in his view , all members of both parties could in future return participate in the same race .
for example , faster visible successes are to be recorded .
during the burgundian people around the sudden death of the richard nixon , the burgundian people were rebuilding the castle on the mountain forest until the last time , the burgverein around sjöberg has a &quot; .
herbert piffl , the second chairman of the burgundian friends , has , according to his own information on the call .
since dimbaths death , he has been standing in front of the burgundian friends .
a new chairman is due to be appointed in a general meeting in mid-september .
at the moment , the association is one of the most important members of the 74-year-old organisation .
&quot; after the death of my friend , richard , i was able to take part in the unification of the german and european union from respect . &quot;
according to piffl , the new chairman will then be invited to discuss with the burgverein .
until then , we could have a situation where the burgundian friends could also have a current mood within their group .
a candidate for the presidency is available at the moment , but picard says .
&quot; but i am confident that the next step will be someone who will find himself &quot; .
the new chairman should be a wolfratshauser .
the tölzer wool is interested in the project &quot; but would like to continue working &quot; .
the different positions of the european union on reconstruction are being picked up in the eyes of piffls .
he acknowledges dimbath as &quot; misionary &quot; , who always works on the reconstruction of the castle .
two similar , already well advanced , models are being developed in austria and france to show that these ideas are not a pipe dream .
by means of a high level of participation by the population and by volunteer assistance from all over the world , you are a tourist magnet .
piffl : &quot; also i was at the beginning sceptical .
but in the course of time i am more and more convinced that the european union is useful to have the project moving forward &quot; .
here you can find some information about the different types of products .
moreover , the project would be financed by eu subsidies , visitor numbers , and potential donors .
&quot; the idea of rebuilding the country is something i personally do not want to take simply overboard , &quot; he hopes , &quot; he says , that the burgverein may be moving a little on this point .
their aim , the history of the first time , was to &quot; be important and good &quot; .
after that , we could continue to see .

a piece of the telegrap-film critic robinbie collin suggests that the film is a little more about the story of the lack of quality in films .
collin beamed the “ new economy ” in 2014 , but it was not a “ new year ” for children ’ s films .

the results are based on the analysis of the child &apos;s opinion and the critics of film , and indicate that the children of this year &apos;s films are similar to those of last year .

pretty apartment in the village of santiago de compostela , in the second season .
with the 2 : 0 via val gardena has a new version of the bitter week on sunday .
&quot; the victory is very liberating &quot; , said trainer zoran baritsic , whose team with the team from the europa league on thursday a midnight .
&quot; the success story of the company was unholy .
schrammmel-dreamtor brings rapid to siegerstraße rapid has started the second season of the season .
&quot; we wanted a positive response , &quot; says the secretary of state thomas schrammel , who , with his splendid leadership volley of the sixteenth century , was in the 14th minute on the road to victory .
&quot; i have looked at how to make a good job of it .
as a shrine , at the 13th novmber 2010 , the first time in a bundesliga game , the team was still there for ried .
the first championship course in the german racing team was held in the same building in the city of dresden .
&quot; for me , the thing is very special , i am from the rapid aftermarket . &quot; , said schrammel .
due to the short-term exposure of the bore , the bore of mario pavelic , schrammel , from the left , was turning to the right defensive side and made his case very well there .
he has had enough experience to work on this position in mirror .
the gate has been opened , but it has been closed this year for some assists , &quot; praised barisic .
mannheim shows character schrammel delivered the first flank to the 2 : 0 through hofmann .
because before that , the commission ’ s guests could have been informed .
&quot; god be thankful , we have had some luck today &quot; , also schrammel , who is thus responding to the break-up of performance and results over the past few weeks : &quot; the results have not been positive , but that was .
bariloche is a town in the north of the island , with a population of about 35,000 .
the first three-point plan since 26 july i therefore proved that the commission &apos;s team team fabric is the backbone of the game , despite the setbacks : &quot; today my team has shown that it is in character &quot; .
for him not minder , the fact that he has been able to return to zero once again is no good .
much work has been done during national pause , including the fact that the british team has won the first round of the world cup with brian behrendt , mario pavelic , christopher dibon , deni alar .
&quot; you can &apos;t do that &quot; , mahmoud barisc warned , who has been working with armed forces over the past three days , and pavelic player lost &quot; the people who have been very stable recently &quot; .
the longest part of the national break must therefore be sufficient to allow &quot; wounds to leak and to &quot; breathe a little bit &quot; in the physical area , &quot; explained barisic , who has waited five u21 .
one , the other , who may be particularly interested in pause is captain hofmann .
he is crying out for the mannheim team , he goes over pain .
it is precisely in this difficult phase that he has shown that he is a very important player for us &quot; , konstatised barisc .
hofmann gave the game rapid &apos;s front door to his exchange-over in the 68th minute , but also achieved the second goal .
for the 33-year old , who has lost his 350th national league game , he has been able to win the first hits of the game since november 2 , 2013 ( 4 : 2 on the admira ) .
hofmann : &quot; may not believe that the time has come to think that everything is good &quot; &quot; . we certainly have had a little luck , but at some point the happiness also has to come back to us .
now it was high time &quot; , said hofmann .
he makes a point of reminding us , however , that the work must not be allowed to be black and white .
we have seen in recent weeks not so bad played , as the honourable member has said .
we must not forget , however , that the time has come to do everything right now .
the importance of its role in the team was not disputed .
it is quite a good idea to have a very young team at the moment .
the people are in certain stages of the process .
val gardena is a town in the province of gröden , germany .
he regretted the rapid opposite effect &apos; from the category of wizard &apos; , as well as the regular gate of nutz in the 40th minute , which was organized by referees collegiate unfairly .
the only thing that we can do is to blame the team .
as you know , we have too little accounts .
interior defenders maximilian karner saw it as though &quot; it has just been badly started , then we have purely found and even a gate made .
in general , the commission would have been more involved .
under this will , the eu is in a state of ruh , and the country is in ruh .
a powerful and powerful tribe showed us in our bizarre task of summerseries &quot; my piece from the rhöner luck &quot; last friday .
several of these trees are in the area .
a holpriest footpath leads up to the &quot; schönbrunn &quot; ( the oldest , 600 years old ) oak .
it is over the copole , basaltsteinhpäisches and basalt meadows .
a little bit of the water below the stone quarry of the bauersberg , a kilometre north of the road to weisbach , it is there .
vital sees the natural monument as a natural monument , it rings over the other trees of the area and reminds with a size of over eight meters of an american mammoth tree .
a small budget hotel , located on a tree-lined hill , indicates that the hotel is a small , spiritual place .
but , despite intense research , the number of people who had been killed was only indicative of the origin of the name .
dr. wolfgang schneider has developed the bishop ’ s archive especially and has asked older people from underweisenbrunn to help out .
the result of his research was a disappointment .
consequently , the commission is expected to submit a study on the effects of the disease before about 80 years ago .
on the foot of the tree , the animals that were driven by the rise should be able to move freely .
meanwhile , the area has become less important , because at the meadows , it is actually a very good place to start again .
the area is also used as a core area of the biosphere reserve .
the hotel is located in the heart of the old town , just a few minutes from the old town square .
a hiking trail leads from unterweißenbrunn to the tree that is a little hidden .
for more ways to do this , please see the link to hochrhön and get to a vast and varied hike .

after weeks of diving , the italian government ’ s premier and president-in-office of the eu , matteo renzi , has voted against strong conservative resistance to the eu ’ s special summit last week .
renzo and his family are the main victims of the nazi regime .
he expects that he will be an upbeat force for his &quot; reform package &quot; in italy .
not least , the renault hopes that the european union &apos;s repeatedly opposed to it will also be able to continue to play a peaceful role , because mogherini is not going to be a party leader , albeit in a moderate way .
opposite the conservatives , with president jean-claude juncker and the president of the council nominated as president-in-office of the council , i will , as the prevailing opinion in rome , be able to achieve a political balance .
because the chemical industry &apos;s chief diplomacy is not being used as a representative of the commission president , mr juncker .
the outstanding commitments are due to be approved by the european parliament .
otherwise , state president giscard d &apos;estaing would have been able to take over the nomination of the 41year-old politician of the governing democratic party ( pd ) .
la repubblica spreads optimism that the long-established and successful repubblica of the world have been able to meet the expectations of the leading party offices .
the most important thing is that the mother of the romans is married and has two daughters .
your party career began in the promo career , and you have been a member of the youth organization of the democratici di sinici .
in 1999 , mogherini was awarded the &quot; golden globe &quot; prize for three years .
with the election of 2001 in the party council of the left democrats , it increased into the high party politics , worked in the department of foreign policy , whose head soon became .
you are the first to be appointed to the presidency of the council of the european union .
since 2008 , she is a member of the chamber of deputies in which she has been an expert in defence and european and international affairs .
as a renzi in february 2014 , premier was born , and he reported mogherini to his wife , the foreign minister .
if the pd is back in the business today , it will be a better relationship with the strong peace movement in the country , which is more than 40 % voting in the eu elections in may .
the board of directors in brussels , which has adopted new eu external delegates , has been given too little diplomatic experience , and there is no substance in the pd .
in brussels , as in particular , poland and the baltic states , the suspicion is based on realistic accents .
you are in favour of the measures taken by the russian company gazprom , south stream , which we are discussing today by russian natural gas , while bypassing ukraine .
after renzo was in july , he was elected as eu president , and he was then travelling to the united states .
photos , which you can use with putin at the shake-hands , are taken in brussels with embezzlement , as are the images of the kremlin &apos;s chief for october .

the socialist group in france should say &apos; the mouth is open and france is in order &apos; , said the most important ally of francois hollande .
mr valls called for the deep-seated left to be allowed to &apos; defend their love &apos; for the controversial proposal by the socialist president .
the president deserves every respect for his country &apos;s independence and for his country &apos;s independence .
&quot; it is our duty to work on his side .
as a appealing gesture , the prime minister insisted that his government should not use the controversial 35-hour week in france , despite strong calls for a relaxation of the regime on the part of emmanuel macrons , the new economic commission .
on saturday i had the opportunity to speak to mr hollande , who was co-socialists , to &apos; united &apos; with the government .
but chris and his wife , christian taurira , have been stressing the need to move the country forward .
marine le pen , the most famous french leader , has been a member of the european parliament for several years , and has been spotted by the constant grass-fighting of the socialists , and has said that it cannot imagine the new vall government going through longer than a few months .
francois hollande is the emperor without a clothes , but prince manuel valls has also no , she is forced to take a new government .
&quot; and the new will also be the autumn or winter not survive , &quot; said mäulein le pen , vis-à-vis supporters .

otherwise , the commission &apos;s position could deteriorate further .

putin is demanding that kiev respect the rule of law and human rights .
the russian president vladimir putin has promised to rebuild russian media reports on sunday that he will be able to use the fighting to fight the separatists in the east of the country and immediately to negotiate the &apos; state option &apos; .
his spokesman dimitri peskov put forward later that he was not satisfied with this .
putin ’ s rise to power
in a interview with the president of the state television channel one , he condemned putin ’ s government for its military campaign to reconquer the country ’ s secret areas , which were kept by separatists in the eastern regions of donetsk and luhansk .
the kremlin and the separatists have recently demonstrated the intrusion of the territory that has been taken .
putin is aware that the us is a country that has been a victim of the campaign of ukrainian politicians for the elections on 29 october .
&quot; we must immediately provide detailed discussions , and not just on technical issues , but also on political organisation of society and the state status of the south-east coast , in order to protect the interests of the people living there , &quot; he said .
peskov said that the putin regime is failing to make reference to statehood in the context of the greater autonomy that he has been advocating for months .
only the ukrainians government can guarantee the eastern territories the necessary autonomy and ensure that the country is not left alone .
it is not a question of negotiations between ukraine and russia , he said peskov , &apos; because it is not a conflict between russia and the ukraine .
the clarification of the kremlin spokesman on correcting the &apos; false pretation &apos; of putin &apos;s regime &apos;s remarks underlined the leadership of russia in dealing with the separatist rebellion .
moskau could have done much more to help the regions of the danube and luhansk in the eastern ukraine .
the autonomous region of the azores , which is recognised by russian diplomats at international forums , would be deprived of the regional governments in ukraine of their own trade agreements and external relations , thus giving the kremlin de facto control over a territory .
the recent decision to suspend the use of the peninsula in the black sea , which was annexed five months ago , is the home port of most russian navy and an important commercial port and historical coastal region .
the regions between the rostowski area in russia and the crimea are also rich in mines , factories and foundry plants .
the ukrainian presidency has been invited to visit the country , petro poroshenko , in his speech on the inauguration of the new government on 7 june .
but his idea of autonomy is not in sharp contrast to the reality of the kremlin and the separatist rebels .
putin ’ s last call for russia to stop kiev from using separatist leaders to keep up with the situation is now followed by a further incident in the country ’ s rebels .
the information supplied by russia is a source of concern to the separatists , who , according to ukrainian security officials , are the first step in a campaign to take over the strategic coastal region up to crimea .
for this reason , massive investment in civil and military preparations for the future is under way to prevent mariupole , a steel industry that is struggling with 500 000 inhabitants .
poroshenko spoke on saturday at a meeting of the eu leaders in brussels and asked for urgent action to help bring about another russian aggression against the ukraine .
&quot; we are on the verge of a point where there is no longer a backlog , &quot; warned poroshenko .
thousands of foreign troops and hundreds of foreign people poured into the city .
the eu summit decided to set up no specific actions to support the leadership .
ukrainian companies are forced to withdraw from their positions in ilowajsk .

the film city is in a thrilling , having a series of unambiguous photographs of a naked jennifer lawrence in a hammer .
the amount of money spent on this is probably 60 nacktphotos of lactose , which is star of &quot; the tribute of panem &quot; and superstars of the same name , including the kate upton and cara .
from the australian actresses teresa palmer , emily browning , yvonne strahovski , and grecko from melbourne , they allegedly also took private photos on the basis of an icloud .
on the list are 101 promities .
stainless steel , which was awarded the grecko prize last month , said to confidentico : &quot; it is reluctant . &quot;
all private letters are sent to the private address .

grecko , to the moment in new york , said that one of the news sites that was the hack &quot; scared &quot; was and that the people concerned &quot; were hurting &quot; .

cycling enthusiasts , joggers and hikers were at the 8th cycling event in the großer feldberg yesterday and have thus given the &quot; help for children with cancer &quot; association their support .
the tour , which is intended for one of the tortuous , represented a great relief for the others .
in a product , however , everyone agreed that there was fun .
thomas studanski is probably the first to be well beaten last night .
because for the first time in his life , the head of the supreme priest brewery was killed yesterday by bike on the feldberg .
for the good purpose .
the small muscles are not only able to give him away , but also because he has the opportunity to participate in the 8th cycling race on the großer feldberg for the benefit of the &quot; help for children of cancer &quot; ( frankfurt ) .
a great idea is to use the new version .
&quot; i know now that i am the only one - prima ! &quot;
small päärnten on the way in the apple-curve ?
nee , if i had to stop at one time , wär &apos;s out ...
as thomas studanski , the chief economist of the cdu in the oberurseler stadtgesetz , quelt many of the 718 participants yesterday in spring to mount and joined exhaustion , but happy .
other people , however , were more likely to be able to cross the elf kilometre long route between hohemark and feldberg .
norman dießner , for example .
the very close to red is a very good green politician from the district - rotes dress , rotes bike - who made a lot of effort at the start to understatement ( &quot; a lot of professionals , there is the goal !

he had to deal with his 6,5-kilometre race bike for 40 minutes .
a vulnerability has been discovered in the amulet .
for this purpose - because i am very happy to be present - andreas balzke said .
the durchtrainite mainzer says : &quot; it &apos;s a &quot; ambitious &quot; man racing bike .
the commission must also be able to do so , because it was not in agreement with the &quot; fixie wheel &quot; , which is also a racing bike , but without a circuit ...
the fact that it can be locked up even without a wheel is proven not only by the 20 hikers who cross the white wall and the fox bar , but also by the many other people who have been walking on the mountain .
mountain bike hire : you can find a lot of information about the mountain bike in the mountain bike rental section .
the 718 participants - and therefore the number of participants who have never been here - were divided into groups in the morning .
the hiking trails first around 9.30 a.m.
it followed a series of first cyclists and runners at 10 a.m.
five minutes later , the first mount etna mountain bikers left .
bent hansen , chairman of the association &quot; radeen auf den großen feldberg &quot; , gave the start commands and wanted the participants a nice trip .
for next year , i hope that the commission will succeed in stepping down the route to feldberg to the safety of the participants .
