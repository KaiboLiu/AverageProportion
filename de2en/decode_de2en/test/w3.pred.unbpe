reversal to the very american ideal of labour rights as human rights
the congress members keith ellison and john lewis have tabled a legislative proposal to limit the organisation of trade unions as civil rights .
&quot; just as trade unions die , so are the middle class jobs .
i am therefore proud to present , together with the citizens &apos; right sister john lewis , the employee authorisation act .
this groundbreaking law gives workers the same legal opportunities in the event of discrimination on grounds of the organisation of trade unions as in other forms of discrimination - and stops anti-trade union forces .
the addition of the national labour law to a way of ensuring discrimination is being proposed for workers who have been exposed to discrimination to organise trade union representation in order to obtain justice in a civil court - and to claim damages or punishments - is needed .
but it is certainly not a radical initiative - certainly not in accordance with american standards .
indeed , the best way to understand what is happening in ellison , lewis , and other sponsors of their legislative proposal is to link back to a very american idea .
despite the setbacks that the trade unions have suffered in recent years - in vienna and in the netherlands , italy , and the rest of the world - the european union has once been able to force countries around the world to respect labour rights .
there was a time when the millions of americans were still remembering when that country was building democracy , freedom of speech , freedom of the press and the right of association in one breath .
when the united states invaded japan after world war ii , the general douglas mac arthur and his staff encouraged the country to adopt a constitution that would allow the country to become a full member of the militarised autocracy .
we are fully aware that the workers and their unions are playing a key role in creating a new japan , and they used a language that is explicitly recognised as a japanese language .
when the united states invaded germany after world war ii , general dwight david eisenhower and his staff pressed germans to write a constitution that would ensure that the german fascism was adolf hitler &apos;s .
recognising that the eu ’ s workers would have to organise themselves , and their voice in the new nation , the us and germany added a clause that explicitly called for the creation of a new nation .
agreements that respect this right or that aim to limit it are not acceptable .
when the former first lady elegance was founded , the first lady was in charge of the international human rights commission .
for generations , americans have accepted the basic premise that labour rights are human rights .
when this country helped other countries to find a way to build civil and democratic societies , the us and the us declared that the right to establish a union - and this is a right that this union should then be involved in collective negotiations as an equal partner - would be .
after these rights have been violated in america , it is indeed very wise to ask the american ideal again .
like pastor martin luther king jr. fifty years ago , “ the world is not the world ’ s largest economy . ”
history is a great teaching master .
now everyone knows that the working movement has the strength of the nation not restricted , but has increased it .
the increase in the standard of living of millions of people has created work in a miraculous way for industry and has brought the entire nation into an unimaginable level of production .
those who have started working are forgetting these simple truths , but the story preserves them .
history remembers , and we should remember , that .
the formal recognition of labour rights as human rights - and the extension of the protection of civil rights as protection against discrimination in the creation of employee representatives - is long overdue .
keith ellison and john lewis renew the ideals that america has been making great in the past , and that renege on the promise of democracy .
judge stops temporarily the law that all the abortion clinics in locanda are not allowed to close .
a us federal judge stopped the operation on sunday for the time being , implementing a law in louisiana , which lawyers say that it is presumably necessary to close all five abortion clinics in the state .
this measure , which was proposed by bobby jindal , governor of louisiana , in june , was brought to the statute and was adopted on 1 september , would allow doctors who have been aborted to do so .
the decision of the judge , however , means that doctors must be allowed to continue to carry out legal abortions for the time being , while they are requesting such a right .
&quot; the plaintiffs may forward further work in accordance with the law while they are concerned about obtaining these rights , &quot; federal judges john degravelles wrote in his judgment .
within a month , a hearing will be held for the judge to ensure that the law is made more permanent .
abortion advocates welcomed the decision to ban the latest in a number of judgments against similar measures and said that doctors should be given more time to develop their own health insurance .
&quot; today &apos;s decision means that women in lousisiana are subjected to a deceitful law that will deprive them of their health and their rights , &quot; said nancy northup , president and chairman of the centre for reproductive rights , five .
it was not immediately clear whether the judgment would also affect doctors .
louisiana is one of 11 states which has adopted similar laws , with courts recently having to take such measures in alabama and mississippi for non-constitutional .
key points of a law in texas , which covers most of the remaining clinics in the state to close , were taken by a federal judge on friday .
abortion advocates and the american college of ostretricians and gynecology are now calling for a ban on abortion .
abortion opponents do not think that the measures are designed to protect women &apos;s health , although some are also concerned about the effects of closing hospitals .
only a doctor who has been in louisiana for abortions has the patient &apos;s right to intake .
if all other doctors in the state are forced to leave abortions , the government would be forced to do so out of fear of its safety .
the commission &apos;s argument against the judgment was that the authorities of louisiana said that they were not doctors because of the conduct of abortions .
delayed diagnoses and lack of access to the best treatments are the result of higher deaths and the death rate from egg cancer in rural areas .
angelina jolie and her brother , james , have a video homage for their mother online .
for women in rural australia , the risk of a higher risk of dying of egg cancer is higher than for women in the rural areas .
researchers analysed the medical data of more than 1100 australians , where in 2005 egg-stocking cancer was detected , and found that only 25 % were diagnosed five years after the diagnosis .
the research director susan jordan of the qimr berghofer medical research institute said that for those who have been living in rural and remote regions of the state , the problem is mortality .
small study : new drugs could cause lung and eggs cancer .
researchers analysed the medical care of women about seven years .
dr. jordan said that the age of a woman is very important in diagnosis , the type of egg cancer , existing pre-conditions and social and economic status .
for older women and those who have cancer to diagnose at the time of diagnosis , the disease was in excess of one in four .
for those who live in rural and remote regions of the state , the average income of the population was around eur 1 billion .
although the study did not examine why outside the city living women with higher education probability are more likely to suffer from ovarian cancer , dr. jordan suspects a late diagnosis and the lack of access to the best treatments .
&quot; this disease is best treated by gynecological oncologists , and these are mostly found in larger cities .
despite the improvement in telecommunications services to meet the distances , the european union proposed a new system of services , as a possible remedy .
dr. jordan said that the study was independent of geographical status and that it was a poor long-term survival rate for women in the egg stock cancer .
the agreement reached by rio tinto ride to conquer cancer is being discussed today in the medical journal of australia .
in march 2013 , elisha neave , a young mother of 33 years old , was struck by the gold coast by an aggressive form of ovarian cancer .
garden centres regret falling house ownership and the loss of the property .
the decline , together with an increase in the number of homeowners under 35 years of age , could lead to garden centres receiving tens of thousands of pounds a year if today &apos;s young consumers are still unable to obtain a study by hta , as reported in the financial services .
the report states that tenants are on average 55 % of the amount paid , the people with own homes for their garden , and that the amount is 55 % of the total cost of the rental .
the rise in people living in high urban areas is a major problem for the european union .
in the greater london area , where over a period of 6 years the share of homeowners of 61,000 homes has fallen from 61 % to 43 % , the lowest expenditure on garden products per household is reported .
hta and the royal horticultural society are also close to the point that the housing sector is a source of income for rent or for small gardens .
guy barter , head of the department of the rhs said : &quot; container gardeners are the most popular among tenants , for example , because they can grow their plants when they move . &quot;
the hta report identified the period between 1997 and 2005 as the &quot; golden age &quot; of the garden sector retail trade due to rising house owners .
he predicts that the country will be in better shape this year because of the better weather .
the opposition ’ s political leadership , imran khan , and the clerical tahirul qadri , in pakistan is continuing .
in the capital islamabad , about 1000 demonstrators have been watching the state television channel ptv .
information minister pervaiz rashid said that soldiers had killed the protesters out of ptv .
the station was responsible for about 40 minutes , sends a message back to the station .

the police used tears of tears .
the demonstrators demanded sharia ’ s resignation , but they refused .
the army of the country is , meanwhile , calling for a political solution to the conflict , &apos; without wasting time and using force without violence &apos; .
after a meeting in the headquarters on sunday evening , the commission announced that it would withdraw from the agreement .
the military plays a major role in pakistan and has already done so more frequently .
the opposition politician is imran khan raising the profile of premier sharif , with the parliamentary election in may last year , deceived .
the protests were escalated at the weekend , after khan and qadri had forced their followers to vote for sharifs residence .
three people were killed , and the situation is not as bad as it is now .
turkey is occupying us diplomat for spying reports .
the turkish ministry of foreign affairs has appointed the world ’ s most senior us diplomat to provide information on a report on american and british espionage in turkey .
vice-president bülent said that the business body of the us embassy and turkish officials had read the report on monday .
the german magazine der spiegel and the online magazine the intercept reported that the german magazine &quot; spiegel &quot; was not able to provide any information on the topic of the internet by the former us security agency , edward snowden .
according to turkish intelligence agencies , the number of victims of the attacks was very low .
an earlier report that also included the most important secret service in germany ankara was published in the same year .

said the district president of the union of german locomotives ( gdl ) , sven schmitte , in düsseldorf .
we expect to see significant outages .
regional priorities are there not .
the main thrust of the warning strike is the transport of goods .
deutsche bahn in nrw announced that it will do everything possible to ensure that the effects are as low as possible .
the gdl , however , did not say where they wanted to strike , so it was difficult to predict the consequences in concrete terms .
policemen of magaluf the corruption attacked .
the prosecutors laid down a letter to the office of the prosecutor of mallorca on friday to prove the blackmail of policemen and staff of the city of calvià .
the head of the police of calvià at the holiday island of mallorca was arrested after allegations of corruption by businessmen and bartender in the notorious binge-drink hotspot magaluf .
chief commissioner josé antonio navarro was arrested after corruption charges .
according to the online daily newspaper mallorca diario , the indictants put the case to the office of the prosecutor for anti-corruption in mallorca on friday , evidence of blackmail by policemen and police officers of the city of calvía .
two other localities , the romans , were arrested by the spanish guardia civil in connection with the corruption cases .
the national spanish daily abc reported that the government of the country ’ s angry night club owners said that the veto was not working .
&quot; it is no longer about making money , it is about survival , &quot; said one of the businessmen to the court .
let our livelihood be put out of the game .
we have nothing to lose .
magaluf made a huge amount of money this summer due to a viral youtube video .
the island authorities have since tried to improve the proper functioning of alcohol and other harmful substances .
playhouse club , where the rock player is playing , is a club where the players are playing for a year .
the tourist resort of magaluf , which is known for its young british tourists , is located in the heart of the city of magaluf , which is also famous for its unbeatable nightlife .
the first spring day with wet and stormy weather conditions impaired flights from adelaide airport .
spring has sweet , sweet , sweet , and sweet , sweet , sweet , and sweet flavours .
in the evening until 9 p.m. , another 5mm rain fell on the city , after 6.6mm , which was already visible at night to sunday .
the last rainfall was the result of a series of short , stormy actors , including a cast that was cast shortly before 8 p.m. and was cast for almost 4mm rainfall in about 10 minutes .
after the winter was over for an early dose of spring last week , the european union &apos;s temperatures fell to a low level on monday .
the bowed weather conditions probably led to the late arrival of the ship .
the plane should have been flying shortly after 7.30 p.m. , but was taken off by a wind of jails - a sudden change in wind speed or direction over a short distance - and had to be taken off .
wind storms reached this point about 50 km / h on the ground on the aellaide airport .
the flight data showed that the aircraft was also available at a second landing flight .
the flight delay caused a significant increase in the number of other flights , including a flight to the united states , including an emirates flight from dubai and a quanta flight from sydney .
for adelaide , on tuesday a maximum temperature of 16 ° c is predicted , with possible actors .
matthias believes : highest time to big failure !
given the galopping technical progress that has been made by our cozy home , we are now in a position to offer our customers a high level of service .
while i write this here , my gaze on the spiral cable , which is the listener with the phone , and i think : boah , as saved as retro ?
but the underlying idea is that if the cable is not in place , the first two lines would be removed in a very short time .
in any case , the eclectic nature of the ekleckle ( ekeltronic ?
no , typing errors : electronic ) sector the rule that the world novelty of today &apos;s electric scrap is tomorrow , bought - sold out .
and if you are still looking for a tube tv in the living room , for example , you simply say that you reject television in principle .
why are these considerations ?
because we are not happy with the ifa &apos;s attaching to the radio tower this week , we are left with an absolute incompetence in electronics matters .
the layman who used to be washing machine and cd player blindly ruled the world of warcraft .
yes , it &apos;s still possible ?
what should we talk to people who seem to be voluntarily using quark ?
in fact , we have been talking about the question of the fact that we are happy to leave our house in the network for some 20 years .
in order to make the yoghurt fit itself , so that we can be sure that the fire alarm is on holiday in the maldives that it is burning at a level in the working room .
and would it not be wonderful if we were to get air conditioning on our early arrival from the office ... ?
yes , this does require air conditioning .
but a dream will most certainly come true soon : we raise our arms and arms watch , say your loud &quot; sucking ! &quot; - and at home the dust vacuum grower goes off .
is it wrong ?
everything is in no way less important than a revolution : &apos; the borders between white and brown hair are not being swept &apos; , and raunt is a sector-expert , you can use the washing machine with a headphones , you can hear .
from everyday practice we also know that if a new and modern device is really needed , it is necessary to have the battery in place .
another reason for this is that the nirvana is not available on the phone for the next radio exhibitions .
israeli children are returning to the country after the war in gaza .
thousands of israeli children from the areas in the vicinity of gaza are being killed .
the school launch brought the missile attack that was launched in the united states and the united states in the south of israel a sense of joy and expectation , but the signs of fighting are still fresh .
in the southern town of ashdod , staff of the &quot; pashosh &quot; kindergarten , who was attacked by a rocket before entering the town , granate splitter from the walls .
&quot; we have a bit of fear , but are excited , &quot; said ronit bart , resident in the kibbutz saad and there english teachers .
many children from our area urgently need to return to a routine .
their 11-year-old daughter shani bart said that it feels like &quot; a bit more cosmopolitan &quot; .
&quot; these were difficult times , and we are not out of the house at all , &quot; she said .
president reuven rivlin visited the kibbutz near the border with gaza , to express his support .
until a cease-fire ended last week , the us government and the united states had thousands of residents in border communities such as saad , or left their homes to live in safer areas further away from gaza .
many nahal oz residents , a community in the vicinity of the border with gaza , have been arrested for a young boy of 4 from a palestinian murderous granate .
the ministry of education announced that about a dozen families were still not returned .
their children were temporarily arrested in other schools .
prime minister benjamin netanyahu visited a school in sderot , a border town with gaza , which was severely torn by the palestinian shells .
it called on the children to do a lot of learning and said &apos; we will make sure that their knowledge is acquired and offer you security &apos; .
israel and hamas agreed to the peace process last tuesday .
the ceasefire provided an immediate end to the fighting ; important problems remain unresolved , as the request from hamas to end the occupation of gaza has been made clear .
israel is calling for the disarmament of hamas and the handover of the bodies of two people killed in the fighting .
a new round of indirect talks is expected to take place this month in egypt .
in the war , more than 2,100 palestinians were killed , three quarters of them civilians , and at least 494 children are estimated to have been killed by the palestinians and the un .
israel is denying this information and estimates that it is a very small country with at least half the victims of the violence , but it has not provided any concrete evidence of this information .
on the israeli side , 66 soldiers and six civilians , including a thai soldier , were killed .
hamas and others who are fighting in gaza fired 4,591 missiles and murderers .
meanwhile , the israeli parliament ’ s military has carried out more than 5,000 air and other attacks .
the israeli attacks damaged the palestinian authority and destroyed thousands of homes in gaza .
for tens of thousands of people to continue to live in the protections and continue fighting , the education authorities have shifted the start of school last week .
&quot; i hope the school is soon open again so that we can continue learning so as to have children in the world and the jewish children , &quot; said mohammad ashton .
the hotel is located in the city centre of saxony , close to the main railway station and the city centre .
given the vote-losses of the npd in saxony , cdu bundesvize thomas strobl has decided to end the current npd ban procedure before the federal constitutional court .
berlin - according to the cdu bundesvize thomas strobl , the current prohibition proceedings against the npd should be brought to an end before the federal constitutional court .
&quot; the npd is worse off than the last time &quot; , said strobl , the npd manager , who also has the cdu head of state in baden-württemberg .
this is a welcome development in the right direction and a development that will not surprise me more with the result that the commission has not been given political control .
the npd was not present at the vote on sunday at the five-percent hurdle .
a first attempt for a ban on the far-right party was in 2003 .
in december 2013 , the federal council , after long preparation , submitted a new application in karlsruhe .
the federal government and the bundestag did not join .
harburg : tents for new refugees
the new place is where refugees are now being accommodated in tents .
the central initial reception for refugees in harburg plainly bursts from all seams .
now the home affairs authority has three tents of the red cross next to it .
the district politicians were only briefly informed of the situation - they are not enthusiastic .
&quot; this hauruck actions further fuel reservations on the part of the citizens and give the district politicians no opportunity to participate constructively in the humane housing of refugees .
your party is calling for the district administration to be called upon to take unused houses to sign up for them .
96 refugees can be found in the three tents .
the reasons for the overcrowding in the first picture are the onslaught of people seeking help - and the fact that the situation in the country is not satisfactory for the authorities .
many refugees are therefore staying longer than the regular three months .
the house prices have hit the strongest winter increase in seven years , showing a widely observed growth in the price of homes .
the rp data corelog headset is a new , innovative and easy-to-use tool for home use in the australian capital .
this increase is the total height of the increase in june , july and august at 4.2 % , the largest increase in winter months since 2007 .
the annual price increase was around 10.2 % , and more than double the average annual price of the previous year .
the research director of rp data , tim lawless , took the opportunity to say that sydney and melbourne had created a two-tier market .
the figures from rp data show that the skin care prices in sydney in the past year have fallen by 16.1 % , in melbourne by 11.7 % .
the following markets are adelaide , brisbane and darwin , in which the prices are average by five and six percent .
at the other end of the scale is canberra , which is characterized by cuts in government spending hard and where the prices are higher than in the year by just 1.4 % .
mr lawless said that the commission &apos;s proposal for a directive was beginning in spring and that it would now increase the prices for the property on sale in the next few months , which would make the market a &quot; real test &quot; .
&quot; if you want to see the constantly high rate of auction prices , a generally fast sales price , and the increasing demand for items , you have to be careful .
in an opinion to the new press , he contradicts statements by the managing director peer medau and attests to this , &quot; as a feldherr &quot; .
the style of the college is not this , it is stated in the communication .
the family medau was already &quot; in the middle of june &quot; about the request of the university .
the statement that the plans will not be announced until july is definitely wrong &apos; , so pötzl .
at the same time , he points out that the plans are not a &apos; preliminary draft &apos; or even a &apos; decision &apos; , but &apos; preferential &apos; .
the commissioner responsible for the access is also the need to expand the narrow road up to the castle to a lesser degree than the medina .
of a nine meter wide road , it was and is not mentioned .
it is not , at present , a matter of 5.50 metres , a metre wider than before , &apos; explains pötzl .
the medal-operators &apos; argument that their free and shoes are not safe is not true in the future .
the parking is not allowed at all because it is like other public parking places now intelligent .
the local people think of the people who live near the area , but they think of the people living near the area .
the children ’ s crib bergwichtel , located on the site and located on its doorstep , provides access to the park deck , is said to have been “ not affected ” according to the university president .
rather , it points out that &apos; there is not only a child &apos;s crib , but also a child &apos;s care centre , as well as the residents of the entrance to the friedrich-streib-straße and the 800 students of the school .
so it is a lot more than a question of the vested interests of mr medau , &apos; pötzl said .
whether the criticism of the parent ’ s council of children ’ s nativity scenes , the extension of the road would be one of the few places that are unspoilt , is justified , &quot; the reader can decide for himself &quot; .
at the beginning of october pötzl will be working together with the state construction office bamberg to inform the town councils about the construction development of the university by 2020 &quot; and in this connection to address the importance of the new development &quot; .
peer medau had a meeting last week with the parents of the children &apos;s crib about the plans of the university .
so the allocation of access to the new parkdeck should not be via the campus and the friedrich-streib-straße as before , but via the medal-berg .
this would have to put the narrow road to about one kilometre long two-lane .
according to the meiji ’ s estimates , transport in the park of hohenfels would increase tenfold .
from about 2000 vehicles daily , there is talk .
the city has been trying to avoid making a statement on the project .
glandorf is made of handball national team .
holger glandorf will no longer be used for the dhb team .
the 31-year-old from the bundesliga sg flensburg-handewitt led to a higher level of health problems for this decision .
the decision was not easy for me , it has been ripe for several months .
it is time for me to respond to the signals of my body and to start my career in the national team .
it therefore goes hand in hand with a balance sheet of 167 country matches and 576 goals for germany in international retirement .
because the rocking backroom player is not able to play the champions league winner , he is not only a few years old on toregagd .
the icelandic people who will be leaving their country for the country games on tuesday , will be able to lead the world cup in glandorf .
his ideas and approaches have just as enthusiastic as they have been my long-time fellow players and my successors .
but for my club i would also like to be healthy in the next years , and for this we need longer regeneration periods , which will be the current double load .
the left hand hander had a strong majority in the house in 2012 after a heel infection .
because of achilles &apos; problems , he had moved from team doctors to the german handballballund ( dhb ) with a cortison injection , which was later a strong inflammation .
an emergency operation and two other interventions followed .
then , glandorf had filed a complaint against the team doctor , the dispute ended with a comparison .
twelve years of professional and eleven years of national team career go by no means without a trace .
i have some health works , which i do not ignore any more .
after the three infectious foot operations in the united states in 2012 , the european union has been able to make a significant contribution to reducing blood pressure .
in this regard , there are a number of other complaints relating to wear and tear .
the first of the year i noticed that the commission is not going to control my head , but my body is not able to deceive , &quot; said glandorf in the interview .
for a comeback , he would only be able to provide an absolute emergency .
&quot; if all the knitts tear , i am always willing to talk , &quot; said the double family father of the magazine .
however , i cannot see the years i have had to play handball in one hand .
i must also say that i think , after a long stay in hospital , that i was also quite humble in terms of my health .
after my career , i would like to be at least somewhat straight .
in addition to the 2007 world championship title and the winning of the champions league 2014 , he won the 2008 ( hsg nordhorn ) and 2010 ( tbv lemgo ) the ehf-cup .
in 2012 , he also secured a contract with flensburg to win the european cup of the cup winners .
german economy in the spring of this year shrunk by 0.2 % , and the economy fell by 0.2 % .
the crises surrounding the world have highlighted the german economy in the second quarter .
gross domestic product is a slump from april to the end of june 2014 compared to the previous quarter by 0.2 % .
the european parliament &apos;s statistical office informed the latter and confirmed that the data were available for preliminary calculations .
consumption alone accounts for about half of the world ’ s economy in the spring , while investment declined .
the eu ’ s external trade slowed down .
thanks to the strong annual start , the company ’ s first half of the year has a total gdp plus of 0.8 % compared to the second half of 2013 .
horstmar was the starting point and the goal of the &quot; münsterland-mooiste &quot; , which was first introduced by the burgmannsstadt on sunday .
the burgmannstadt horstmar experienced a burgmann-like invasion of dutch &quot; fever rider &quot; on sunday .
the biggest cycling association in the netherlands , ntfu , organized the so-called &quot; münsterlande mooiste &quot; .
the camera has a very high speed and a very high speed internet connection .
more than 1000 participants thanked their registration with jos ter huerne for the organization of this tour through the munich re region .
the german federal ministry of education and research ( bmbf ) has published a list of the most important german and international publications on this tour .
we come from the heroes and are driven overnight to take part in this tour .
we would like to welcome the münsterland in this way , too , &quot; said the cyclists were delighted by the route through the steinfurt , borken and coesfeld districts .
after registration in the association ’ s home of schützenbruderschaft sta .
katharina was on a small &quot; peace journey &quot; through the city over the wall , where the start was also made .
the rotation that followed for three different categories led to the first of the three routes towards herrenholz over the schöppinger berg in the direction of coesfeld and via havixbeck and billerbeck back to horstmar .
on routes of 95 kilometres with 1175 levels , the 120 kilometres with 1475 metres of altitude and 145 kilometres with 1775 metres of altitude , the cyclists have proved their good condition .
the hotel was built in 1890 and it is located in the heart of the city of havixbeck .
the main organizer jos ter huerne and mayor heinz lölfing showed up on the success of this cycling event .
we are satisfied and it was a wonderful experience for all parties .
the organization was running without problems and there was no negative incidents , &quot; he prefers to attract lölfing a positive conclusion .
unfortunately , not so many participants came to the event as the organizer had hoped , which probably was due to the bad weather forecasts and the morning sunset .
&quot; we are facing a new era in 2015 , hopefully in good weather on 30 august or during another weekend , &quot; said the cyclists , but they promised to return to the münsterland and the organisers are planning a new edition .
konstantin wecker &apos;s gently honest memoirs are a real treasure of the world .
it is actually more philosophical testimony than biography .
non-chronologically , but more ideas , and more ideas , are needed .
and he is gentle , honest : from the onanie as a gymnasiast to the laden thieves and drug use .
also , to show how he himself is tolerant of the handling of his fellow human beings .
the hotel is also located in the centre of the city , in the heart of the old town , in the heart of the old town , in the old town , in the old town .
and he also explains his pacific spirit , his social and political criticism , his political commitment - and also how he did not only listen to music ( the opera house ) .
the latter has the libeman konstantin alarm also to the ascetic monk .
between all the hostages , there is also a short anecdote to the earth : about the beatings in a country dominated by gis .
here , too , he is ruthlessly honest .
lenny henry : my father never took me into the arm .
never said &quot; i love you &quot; , i love you &quot; and i never said &quot; you &quot; .
henry was one of seven children of a jamaican immigrant family in dudley in the midlands in 1958 .
his father , who died when henry was 19 , worked in a factory in which her relationship was limited .
henry is rehearsing for a comedy , rudy &apos;s rare records , and the new york times , some of which were based on an imaginary conversation with his father .
the soundtrack is a mixture of reggae and rap , with lively melodies .
but henry had to be replaced by some difficult childhood moments .
he attended &quot; many &quot; therapies after the death of his mother , and henry is thoughtful about his relationship with his father .
it was difficult to know him .
you never saw his face , heard only his voice : &quot; listen with the crack on .
let your sister rest .
get away from it !
i want cricket .
my older brothers seymour and hilton - who have already grown up when i was a child - went with him to the pub and talked about things that i could do with the form of beer glass or the beauty of a beer .
i never had such a conversation with him .
much of my life was devoted to this serious type in the corner that the newspaper read .
recently opened henry a foundry in dudley , and although the conditions are better than too late in his father &apos;s day , he won a one-of-a-kind insight into how life was for him .
it is now a little brighter , but they are dark , smoked , deep stygical labyrinth with flame shocks and smoke and much soot .
my father used to be simply in the tub and then he could be heard slowly as he was singing .
when i came here , i was told that the european union was not going to do that for years .
nevertheless , henry grew up as a child without love testimonies from his parents .
my father embraced me never , he never said &quot; i love you &quot; .
only when my mother died at the end of her life , we began to &quot; i love you , i love you , i love you &quot; .
with its own subsidiary cheap , with dwn fly , the company has been able to share the love that he has earned as a child .
could you please talk to the &quot; i love you &quot; ?
listen to the story of me !
dad , i am 22 !
dawn french .
why should we not be friends ?
it is a great mother .
it is still with french , but i think it is a good idea to have 25 years old .
dawn is a good person .
why should we not be friends ?
it is a great mother .
henry &apos;s own mother was diabetic .
this contributed to her death .
so when i was very , very overweight and symptoms of diabetes showed , my doctor said &quot; you have to be radical .
so i pulled this fitness through and also had to carry a drastic diet to reduce the symptoms .
it is very difficult .
and it is tiring .
no one likes to eat carrots .
henry &apos;s career change is perhaps reflected in his elegant , short cut book , which is now available in the print media .
since he was elected by the critics for his othello , he has been the most unified of the theatre .
the first was the comedy of the mistakes that were made , and then fences of august wilson .
this is another experience than the sitcoms and komödien , who have been doing their business in full .
he began with only 16 years when he was in a factory .
a dj discovered him on stage , when he was imitating people and writing to new famed dj .
his television career began in the mid-1970s . &quot; i was responsible for a rather long period of the only black imitator / comedian on television . &quot;
he learned to work .
i had to flee not only from the public eye , but also from 1975 to 1985 , as i was able to develop an efficient joke narrative machine while i was watching a star through television , and that was really difficult .
lenny 1975 at new faces
since his manager has been the stage law at the black and white mines , he has been a member of the leipzig music society for many years .
my family was very uncomfortable .
i wish somehow that it would never have happened , but i regret that i am not able to do so .
it was a strange , unpleasant position for me , but i worked on giant things like the one i learned to do .
but this &quot; years of award-winning work of art &quot; is not the only way to get the british television into the picture .
by introducing figurines , which will be the british black culture both derided and fired , the henry worked in the 1980s to create an alternative comedy circle .
the first series of lenny henry show went on broadcast in 1984 , and in the 1990s he was among others the chef of the kitchen gareth blacklock in the comedy bar series chef !
advertising , documentary films , tv series and film roles are the main factors of his next decade , but after his bbc series lennyhenry.tv 2008 dared to be a &quot; what is it ?
then came a documentary series for radio 4 entitled what &apos; s so great about ... ?
the first episode was about shakespeare .
shakespeare was a regular guest at the hotel .
i had a lot of fun at school and i never thought i could do anything about him .
so i was very afraid of it .
all of us who have been interviewed for the show , peter hall , trevor nunn , adrian lester , judi dench said &quot; you should try it .
make it not bad if you do not know what you are talking about .
take a few of the words in your mouth , and then you &apos;ll understand that you are all shackespeare so dear .
henry led 20 lines from othwithout &apos;s last speech for the documentary and he was enthusiastic .
i felt that the first thing i could do was to do that .
it was almost as if someone had taken my head at last .
&quot; that &apos;s what it is all about , it &apos;s a serious matter , take them seriously , listen to your text , search a bit .
the samples were brutal and i read this piece for months , before we had done it .
and it was a success .
they seemed to be a car accident , and that happened .
and soon he joined the comedy of the error of the book .
suddenly i was in the national theatre and i could hardly believe it .
there was a moment when i thought that the &quot; oh , you &apos;ve been changing . &quot;
there was a technical error and henry felt instinctive that he had to interact with the audience .
&quot; a small voice told me &quot; you have to spend 10 minutes now to get out of the computer .
instead , the book ’ s director , who said that the idea was going forward once the problem was resolved , said that the problem was not solved .
i went from the stage and anything was a bit of a &quot; oh , god was there &quot; .
i am not responsible for this .
i can tell someone else .
&quot; you play in a play that is , stay in your role . &quot;
henry in fences am duchess theatre , new york : the new york times .
you can find the text for fences in a very demanding way .
panic is very good , it strengthens the longings .
that too was good , it is just like a big sign of the gods , which tell me &quot; that is your determination here &quot; .
he says so , of course , with a thundering voice .
so i stand by it .
i really love that .
i love to live in a sample room , but i don &apos;t know what to do .
henry , however , still has the head of a comedian - our conversation is of humorous eruptions while he always imitates people .
i decided not to use stand-up copy as a means of creating a new image .
if we are constantly looking for this , we are going to a wall .
i sometimes meet live in apollo , but when i come to see the video , i have a lot of fun .
i ask him whether he ever has ever held a stand-up comedy tour .
the fun i had in a room with a director , and the fact that i was able to make a start , a middle and an end to a journey - i do not think i was ever able to give up that .
is this really his new incarnation ?
i think so .
i am happy to be an actor .
it is fun .
it is always said that history is a great story .
i love stories .
people love stories .
huthi-rebels are blocking roads in yemen &apos;s capital city , yemen , and the capital city of yemen , yemen , which is the capital city of yemen .
in the conflict between shia huthi rebels and the yemeni government , the hutu ’ s leaders have led to civil disobedience in the capital , sanaa .
huthier followers would have had central roads in sanaa on monday , said a spokesman of the hutu party &quot; ansar allah &quot; .
the hotel is also very close to the train station .
yemeni media report a traffic chaos in the capital .
according to the online edition of the newspaper &quot; yemen post &quot; , huthi-fürmalik al-huthi had a meeting on sunday evening on the measures .
huthi threatened to leave the country , according to the sheet , with another escalation of the conflict , if his demands were not met .
the shia huthis are fighting for greater independence from the sunni ruled yemen , demanding the resignation of the government .
the tribe of the huthi has been besieging the yemeni capital for almost two weeks .
around 30,000 rebels have been arrested in protest camps at the major access routes to sanaa .
in the surrounding area , there are always bloody battles with the yemeni army .
kenya registers officials to &quot; violate the spirit workers &quot; .
kenya has begun to take all bioetry officials biometrically to &apos; sghodge-employed &apos; from the pay lists of the government .
employees who are in the next two weeks not registered will be not registered anymore , they were a government announcement .
the government suspects that thousands of people will be killed even after they have left the public service .
president uhuru kenyatta promised at his term of office in 2013 to end corruption in the public service .
when examining the report at the beginning of this year it was found that at least 1 million $ ( 700,000 £ ) per month of ghost workers payments and other abuses were caused by other financial practices .
the government suspects that salaries will continue to be paid on accounts that have been assigned to a person .
all officials must now be able to take part in the identification centres in the next two weeks to ensure that their data is available via biometric registrations , was reported in a government message .
all those who did not do this without a credible excuse would be disappointed by the salary list .
&quot; this approach will make a significant contribution to the rationalisation of public service by reducing the actual number of officials and also by reducing the salary list on both levels of government - as is the case with the ghost employees .
the scandal of the art consultant helge achenbach will be on 11 november in court for the first time .
five heirs of berthold albrecht , son of the aldi founder , theo albrecht , demand in a civil process at the düsseldorf district court 19.4 million euros compensation from achenbach and two companies .
the commission has announced that it will submit a report on monday .
in the case of the case , it is stated that achenbach has made a significant contribution to the purchase of works of art and vintage cars and that berthold albrecht has calculated higher than actual purchase prices .
this also means that the commission agreed to be higher .
achenbach has won 121 million euros in valuables for albrecht .
children need roots and wings , and they need roots and wings .
44 years he was in school , 23 of which were in charge of school .
from this time manfred richter knows many rod petershausen and kollbacher from their time as a student .
his methods were sometimes unconventional , but always worn by his desire to live in the student .
the snow-capped mountains of the alps are the most famous mountain in the giant mountains .
manfred richter loves the painting with the motif of his home .
judges were born in trautenau / north bohemia in 1930 , today trutnov .
the first of his 14 years was in the age of 14 , and he was already interested in his teacher &apos;s profession .
one year on , the sudeten germans were expropriated .
within half a hour , the family had to leave their home .
after a few months in one camp , the first flight was in 1946 to bavaria - in the freight wagon .
so he forged judges into the upper franconian senkendorf .
the teachers ’ education took place in bamberg .
to this end , manfred richter had to go to the next station six times a week , by train to bamberg , three kilometres across the whole city to school .
after two months , manfred richter got a red cross home in baden , germany .
in 1951 he made the first and in 1954 after three years of lehramtanwarter the second state exam. in 1951 he was appointed to the state academy .
since oberfranz is not a free teacher for him , he applied for a job in upper bavaria and came to the bavarian state school on november 1 , 1954 .
the &quot; milling machine room &quot; was its first &quot; service apartment &quot; in the school house .
in 1958 , he again made teaching material at the newly built teachers ’ house next to the school .
this house bought manfred richter in 1980 , after the school in kolbach dissolved in 1968 .
until then , there were no such cases in kolbach in the school association petershausen-kollbach and in petershausen five .
from the school year 1968 / 69 these were published in petershausen in the town hall today .
when the school association indersdorf was founded , only the school &apos;s primary school remained in the village .
to avoid a downgrade in the now smaller school , the us government changed its position to the college of economics , georg sigl .
but petershausen grew , and so the children and their teachers could learn from september 1982 the current construction , which was completed in 1997 after the retirement of judges .
manfred richter praised the uncomplicated generosity of the then mayor ludwig götz , who was also responsible for a community cost and for the extension of 1997 cellar rooms , although this was after the directives .
&quot; mayor götz was very kind to school &quot; , remembered judges .
throughout his career , manfred richter has never heard a government representative &apos;s speech , which was directed at a department of a school council on law and justice .
&quot; you have to make the children two things : roots and wings , &quot; says the current 84-year-old .
and he had to know : &quot; this does not always succeed &quot; .
in any case , judges do sometimes unconventional , .
if students are reviewed , they get it not because of him a punitive work and were not arrested for being seated afterwards .
at the expense of the community judges had two pairs of boxing gloves and left the two counterparts to compete , even if they were a vw .
for the good of the school , judges used a good relationship with the then mayor ludwig götz ( csu ) .
this moved the partisan judge to retire to the court of justice in 1996 at least as the last on the csu list for the municipal council .
but judges were deferred to number six and joined the csu .
180 kilometres in three
hr4 bike tour 700 cyclists will be staying in the spa park of bad salzhausen and schotten stopovers .
if cyclists are on their tour in bad salzhausen or schott , this is not in itself a special experience .
on friday , however , the number of raging impressions alone made it clear that the 700 participants of the hr4 cycling tour and accompanying tross enjoyed a break in the lower spa park in bad salzhausen and later a party under free .
under the motto &quot; cycling and celebrating on newly discovered paths between nidda and kinzig &quot; , participants had to meet in bad vilbel on thursday and make a concert by van baker &amp; band mitterlieben .
on friday , it was taken seriously : cyclists took the first stage , which is 60 km across flora town to bad salzhausen and further to schotten .
in bad salzhausen , the athletes were trained by mayor hans-peter seum , who was in bad vilbel with the bicycle in order to make a start on the company ’ s own business in bad salzhausen , petra schwerther .
for refreshment of body and mind , all kinds of good things were prepared : the rural women from ranstadt and nieder-mockstadt had 85 brass apple , to use their own , stretch and weight .
&quot; such cakes can only bake agricultural women , &quot; praised a participant from aulendiebach , while he was ordering another piece .
the bar at the turnclub geiss-nicht-nidda was used to cool cold refreshments .
the duo bravo is a very popular meeting place for the visitors .
the beautiful ambience of the park has been relaxing .
a mr. genoss also enjoyed a head massage from his partner : &quot; he earned it , after all he has already dropped off today bicycle chains .
meanwhile , the mayor and the business manager had to work : they were buried at the fountain before the drinking cure house of reporter rainer janke .
promotional chef tomislav hagen , since the first hr4 cycling tour 2004 , has also been able to perform only short .
his pickup truck , where he was shot by three telephones and a radio unit with his employees and the 15-member staff , was a great success .
&quot; the majority of participants come from the rhein-main-region , &quot; he told the german federal ministry of economics and technology , &quot; but also from foundry or fulda , lauterbach or taunus and even from numerous cities in western florida .
the number of participants is a bit different from the number of nights available .
in category i , participants will be accommodated in hotels , in category ii in collective accommodation .
from the spa , the cyclists had a good impression when they arrived after one and a half hours : &quot; bust ! &quot;
&quot; it was nice to be in bad salzhausen ! &quot; they waved to leave .
after arriving in scotland , i was allowed to take a short snow-break .
but in the evening the cyclists were in the idyllic alteburgpark .
under the direction of the scottish society for tourism and city marketing ( gts ) , the park had a nice festambiente and of course it had been prepared to tap tasty , some flammcakes with well-cooled white feather .
mayor susanne schaab , gts managing director markus hoßfeld and msc-chairman wolfgang wagner-sachs in his role as a member of the adac hessen-thuringia .
the three showed themselves to be delighted with the &quot; many operations in scotland &quot; .
dj tobias hagen then gave the dancing stage free .
the opportunity to enjoy the flourishing movement under the sky was not missed despite the sporting activities on the bike .
among the guests were increasingly citizens who were elected by the good mood as well as the great scourge of cyclists .
on the second day , cyclists were able to visit the stations of birstein , wächtersbach and bad orb - including a concert with the trenkwalders .
yesterday , after 180 kilometres of cycling , i met the sports enthusiasts again in bad vilbel .
dozens of turkish police officers are still in prison for &quot; conspiracy &quot; against the government .
33 police officers were killed in turkey due to the suspicion of &quot; conspiracy against the government &quot; .
the police authorities did not give any immediate comment .
among the arrested were 14 high-ranking policemen , meld hughes , and the police .
some of them were involved in the corruption investigation of government officials , including four government ministers last december .
in july , a number of turkish police officers were arrested for having supposedly committed an organised criminal association and calling numbers for them to be used .
the turkish president recep tayyip erdoğan ( who was then prime minister ) described her actions as part of the activities that were carried out by the islamic clergy fethulla güllen against him and others .
not all children in ukraine are returning to school .
schools almost everywhere in ukraine opened a new office on monday ( september 1 ) after the summer holidays .
this day is traditionally an important day for families , and like thousands of other ukrainian parents , prime minister arsenij jazenjuk brought his daughter to school .
the council then informed waiting journalists that the new government had not reopened all schools , but that it was determined to leave the country for future generations : the european union , the united states , the united states , and the united states .
the september celebrations were not held in every school .
the sky is not everywhere above ukraine peaceful .
we must ensure that the sky is peaceful .
the whole of ukraine , a huge common ukrainian national front , must be ready for a peaceful sky .
aleksan pastukhow , school director of the school in slavjansk , the jazenjuk daughter visited , spoke to russian .
we hope that the new peace will finally be restored here and that the children will be given an education that will be useful to them in the future .
the first day of the school year is traditionally celebrated .
with rona fairhead , the bbc has perhaps made the great director , the man she needs .
it is a proud rum of the european union .
and it has its own front-end experience .
her career began with the global management consulting company basin and co . , which was the focus of her work on morgan stanley , bombadier , ici and the media world of pearsons .
she was a member of the board of directors of the financial times for seven years , and resigned when the chief position of the parent company pearsons was transferred to a younger male colleague .
your payment was allegedly almost 1 million £ .
their political rankings are also sound .
she was david cameron of lord brown , the chief of the former chairman of bp , when he was asked for more private knowledge in whiteness .
her husband is a former tory council member .
as early as may , i described the role of chairman with a poisoned cup .
not only is the bbc a huge and complex entity in the heart of public life , but there are also an internal paradox in its structure .
confidence is in two directions : inwardly on the first guard of its own management hierarchy in the bbc , but also outwardly as a voice of public concern and disquiet when things are going wrong .
this ensures an almost untenable duopol , which is resumed after a complete comprehensive reform .
but what new coming chairman would it be risky to say ?
it is a difficult task .
and as if that were not enough , the many are still interested in making the bbc smaller .
while the competition is getting closer and new technologies are bringing back old , comfortable collateral , the threat of negotiation is still very important for the bbbc .
for the modest sum of eur 145.50 per year , the european commission &apos;s public purchases itself in the largest media company in the world .
the bbc tells a good story : it says that the world was 96 % of all households and that only 40 pence per day is paid .
and apparently , the bse crisis is rising on the popularity page .
the vision and usage habits for the bbc have changed .
but it remains a very beloved and significant figure .
it needs a considerable chairman - i hope that you have supported it .
perry from texas says that downgrading tweet is not authorized .
a tweet from the official account of the republican governor of the texas region , rick perry , on sunday included a herald of diminishing news about the democratic district government prosecutor , who was at the heart .
tweet was subsequently deleted and replaced by another one by perry &apos;s user account , which allows the previous withdrawal from the site .
a tv tuner is just from my account sent out .
&quot; i approve of the tweet and i have deleted it , &quot; he said .
employees of perry did not respond immediately to requests for comments .
although tweets from perry &apos;s official blog user account are expired , it was not clear who actually created the feed .
in the former tweet , an unfavourable outcome was found in the district ’ s public prosecutor , travis county , rosemary lehmberg , who was the first to be sentenced to death in april 2013 .
perry put a veto on financial support for her office , when she was refusing to accept the withdrawal , which led to a charge of the perry - the possibly 2016 presidential candidate - that was being made .
the text of the tweets reads : &apos; i am not always drunk with the triple permissible alcohol level ... but if i do , i am wearing a good-bred pearry , if i do .
i am the drunk democrat in texas .
lehmberg ’ s office was not responsible for the investigation of the grand jury against perry .
this was done by michael mccrum , a special public prosecutor from san antonio , who was arrested by a republican judge .
perry argues in favour of not guilty and called the prosecution a political trick .
his high-class team of legal counsel requested a report from the court of justice on the case , which was charged with refusing the charge and arguing that the law we are dealing with was a criminal offence against the most senior governor .
perry stopped 7,5 million $ state money from the public purse .
this veto has created a public complaint from a left-wing party , watchdog , which is a very important issue .
perry &apos;s official user account is often updated - and sometimes famous .
after having won the polling in iowa during his presidential election campaign , he was elected as fifth-president in 2012 .
berkeley explains housing market policy for &quot; normal &quot; .
one of the most prominent building contractors in london , he pointed out that the construction of the housing market in the south-east of england was back to normal levels .
home homes in the capital were hot , but the city was the subject of enormous price increases , which made the bank of england uneasy to do due to widespread fear of a credit bubble .
tony pidgley , founder and ceo of the university of applied sciences in berkeley said on monday : &quot; since the beginning of the current financial year , the market has been back on a normal level of transaction since the highest level since the 1st of 2013 .
the real estate market in london was very strong during the downturn , as foreign buyers were moving to the capital .
according to the katasteric office , prices are in the urban area alone last year jumped by 18.5 % .
the average selling prices for berkeleys private , price and quality students are around $ 1.50 per month .
a stronger pound , however , has made real estate property in london more attractive to foreign buyers in recent months - some of them have also been affected by the introduction of new property taxes and political rhetoric to a possible &quot; villas tax &quot; .
the london real estate agent , foxton , warned in the past week that the price of mortgage bonds was too low for the mortgage market to be more stringent .
new data from the bank of england on monday show a decline in mortgage lending in july , which is also indicative of a decline in the housing market .
hamptions international , another real estate agency , corrected its prediction for the rise in real estate prices in london for 2015 downwards to 3 % , based on an already weakening market .
the volume of transactions in the most expensive areas of london , such as chelsea , mayfair and kensington , has grown by more than a quarter each year , according to the broker wa ellis .
nevertheless , the desire for a home in the capital for berkeley is a blessing , as the due amounts of money for appointments are limited to more than 2.2 billion euros .
mr pidgley said that &apos; the demand for the right , well-planned and effective product to the best locations has not been stable and has been reduced as a result .
in june , the company reported that it had 3742 new homes , which were built in the year until the end of april - almost a third more than the 2007 peak before the crisis .
the annual pre-tax result rose by 40 % annually to eur 280 million , the turnover by 18 % to eur 1.6 billion .
in a communication on monday before the annual meeting of the company , mr pidgley said that the revenue for berkeley was expected to reach the current market share this year .
analysts estimate that the annual growth rate of the pre-tax was 450 million .
berkeley shares were on the table in the london trade in the afternoon at 23.96 cents .
nude photos of jennifer lawrence , by hacker on the internet published on the internet .
jennifer lawrence appeared at the 85th oscar rental in london .
nude photos of the oscar prize winner jennifer lavrence were taken online by a hacker who claimed to have a &quot; mastered list &quot; of images of another 100 starlets .
a representative of the star from &quot; the tributs of panem &quot; confirmed that the show photos of lavrence echt were genuine and accused the hacker of &quot; flagrant violation of human rights . &quot;
the authorities have been notified and will follow all those who have stopped the stolen photos of jennifer lawrence .
the photos originally taken on the photo sharing site were taken on the 4chan photo site .
it is not certain how many of the images are genuine , although winstead , star from &quot; scott pilgrim against the rest of the world &quot; on twitter also hack condemned the hack .
&quot; to those of you who have seen photos , which my husband and i have taken in the private environment of our house years ago - i hope you are so satisfied with you &quot; , wrote winstead on twitter .
victoria justice from the night-lodeonseries &quot; icarly &quot; and &quot; victoria &quot; .
let us not be fooled by the beginning .
buzzfeed reported that the debian project &apos;s new release is scheduled to be released on sunday .
exclusive excerpt from howard jacobsons highly-praised new novel about love and the letter of &quot; j &quot; .
they were broken up , so they could best be described , they triggered slowly like a carton , the one that was left in the rain .
occasionally , a woman told him that he was too serious , exhausting , intensive , distanced , and perhaps somewhat scratch-prone .
and shake his hands with the hand .
scratch-brushed he knew .
he was stuck , as in igel , yes .
the last victim of this stackness was a just beginning affair , which was promising .
ailinn solomon was a horrible and delicate beauty with untamed hair and a bottle of heart from a village on the northisland , which even more had its own remote and rough appearance than port report .
it was equipped with an older companion to the south , kevern for her aunt , and which was a plot in a wet but paradisiacal valley with the apt name paradise valley .
for several years , no one in the house had lived .
the pipes were leak , in the bathrooms were still spiders , nut tones had their spines on all windows .
it was like the house from a children &apos;s fairy tale , both threatening and tempting , a garden full of secrets .
portrait of the author : howard jacobson , whose novel &quot; j &quot; is based on the longlist for which man booker price 2014 .
the shortlist is displayed in the next week .
kevern had a very good experience with ailinn in the broke song &quot; the beats &quot; on the high grass and had an unusually warm spring afternoon .
your feet are too large .
because of their own aggression , songs of this kind were no longer on the console .
not prohibited - nothing was really forbidden - simply not played .
it was successfully obsolete , as the word obsolescent .
the general taste was the result of which i could never have been able to enact and regulate , and how people could have used the vom teller zum-millionaire memoirs , cooking books and love books in books .
in the euphoria of the day , kevern began an imaginary piano to play and to play in a grob comic serenade ailinn &apos;s great feet .
ailinn did not understand this .
&quot; this was a well-known song by a jazz pianist called fats waller , &quot; he explained to her and automatically put two fingers on his lips .
that was his father &apos;s job at all times to write j .
it had been seen as a game between him and his father when he was still small .
his father had to do it with his own father , so he had told .
if you want to add a word to a j without having two fingers about your lips , it costs you a penny .
it was not a very funny game even then , and it was still not very funny to play .
he knew that the problem was not that of him , but that was all .
it had to explain what jazz was .
ailinn has never heard of anyone .
jazz was played by the famous jazz singer , although not directly banned .
the improvisation was no longer modern .
it was only space for a single &quot; if &quot; in life .
people wanted to be able to hear a melody at the beginning of a melody quite sure where it would end .
the mind is also the mind .
his unpredictability made people nervous .
and jazz was musical , and the music was more than a simple mind .
although he was 10 years old without being taken over by sammy davis junior , he knew that he was a good friend of jacques garcia .
but at least he had to leave ailinn without explaining that fats waller was black .
at that time she was not able to remember a time when she was a pop singer , but when she was a pop singer .
again , no laws or constraints were applied .
conformance society meant that every element of this society was grateful to the principle of group gifts .
people with afro-caribbean origin were threatened by temperament and physical construction for underwater and sports .
people who were originally from the indian subcontinent were not like the indian nature , with electronic talent .
what is still being left of the polish community is not concerned with the canalisation ; what is being done by the greeks is being broken up plates .
those from the gulf states and the levante , whose grandparents left the country not quickly as what happened , were not able to do so .
each of his abilities .
as they are only ballads , it fell to aelin to understand that he was the insult of the words that kevern used just now .
music was an expression of love .
&quot; they are not really insulting , &quot; said kevern .
apart from perhaps people whose feet are too large .
my father never heard anyone insulting , but he loved the game .
he spoke too much , but the neglected garden gave him the expensive money .
nothing could replace the soundproofing of the huge coal fired leaves .
ailinn still did not understand .
why would your father love this ?
he wanted to say that it was a jux , he hesitated to be in their presence again two fingers at the lips .
she thought anyway , that she was a bit special .
&quot; it seemed to him funny , &quot; he said instead .
they shake hands with the lord , and betrayed kecommon .
there was a worldwide lack of anything else to see than their unrivalled crabs black hair .
there was nothing he could have seen otherwise .
&quot; if you say it , &quot; do you not believe that .
but that does not explain why you did it to me .
it seemed to be genuinely concerned .
are my feet too big ?
he saw again .
your feet are not so direct .
maybe your ankles , a little bit ...
and you say you hate me , because my servants are not too thick , ?
hate you ?
of course i hate you not .
that is just the foolish song .
he could have said &quot; i love you &quot; , but it was still too early for that .
&quot; your thick ankles are exactly the reason why you are happy with me , &quot; try to find it instead .
i am a bit perverse here .
the sound was not right .
it had a strange feeling .
if he tried to be funny , he brought him to the scene often , because he was like his father not to talk about the calming charm .
perhaps his father wanted to be cruel .
perhaps he wanted to be kevern .
despite his friendly eyes .
ailinn solomon was red and raised in the air .
the flourishing wine , therefore , was a drink no excuse for him .
in their excitement , she seemed to tremble , as palm wedel in the storm .
&quot; and your thick head is exactly the reason why i am perverse to you .
except that i do not even am .
she did not do it , both because of the unnecessary unkindness of his words and the fear that has been expressed in her eyes when she spoke out against him .
did she think that he would beat them ?
she had not told him of life on the cold northern archipelago .
the same huge and ice-cold ocean , the sea , was burned here as there on the shore .
the same confusion arose between the two men , with even thicker skin and more wound after what had happened than their predecessors .
thick head ?
they would have given her a big fist if she did not fit !
they crunch - crumble , they were the most common used .
after kevins , this was an unnecessary confusion .
ailinn solomon gave him a feeling of well-being through her body .
he raised the question of the lodge and the one of old man .
she felt the same way as a lead , but the impact of his grief surprised her .
that was not the end of the world .
they knew each other very well .
she saw him as a betrayer - as he was from a room on the upper floor her companion told him - a man who was complaining about something that he himself had grown up .
adam leaves the garden , thought she .
she felt a sudden pain for him and men in general , although some of her hands were raised against them .
a man turned away from her , his back prayed , and he was ashamed , beaten without a fight spirit - why was that a decent sight , the sight she had to know well , when she was in a hurry ?
when she was alone , she looked at the world ’ s most beautiful and beautiful feet .
for several years before the recent reports of the death of the child , esme nussbaum , an intelligent and enthusiastic 32-year-old researcher on behalf of ofnow , the non-legislative monitoring committee , worked .
&quot; it has been done a lot and much still needs to be done , &quot; she wrote , &quot; to the innate aggressiveness of a people , which is a thousand wars and which has destroyed most of them , especially in the remote areas .
but some features are not always enough to be able to be extinguished .
the higher the church tower , the more it seems , the less passion it has for the church .
the population is crying out for sentimental ballads , robbing of stories about supernatural phenomena and claiming to be firmly attached to the virtues of marriage and family life , but still keeps on being the only one .
&quot; you have an unfortunate tendency to override the fact , &quot; said your mentor , as he said the whole report .
i propose that we should have less novels .
esme nussbaum lowered her head .
i must also ask : are you atheist ?
&quot; i think that i do not have to say , &quot; answered esme nussbaum .
are you lesbian ?
again , the team of esme called for their right to privacy and refused to say .
feminist ?
yet again , silence .
&quot; i don &apos;t ask , &quot; said luther rabinowitz , &quot; because i am against atheism , lesbian or feminism .
this is a prejudiced job .
we are serving a prejudice free society .
but certain types of hypersensitivity that are not necessarily acceptable and logical in itself are not acceptable .
you yourself have obviously taken prejudices against the church , and these things that you call &apos; disguised &apos; and &apos; raw &apos; are not the same as those that you have described as an expression of naturally strength and vitality .
if you continue on the path , you will see the sign of the event .
esme nussbaum looked around while rabinowitz spoke .
behind his head , a led font in flamingorosa repeated the advice that ofnow gave to the country in the last quarter of a century or more .
smiling your neighbors , you value your partner , listen to ballad , visit musicians , play music , play games , play games , play games , play games , play games , etc .
speaking is better than silence , the common sense of words is better than what is written , but nothing is better than love .
&quot; i understand perfectly what you are looking for , &quot; he replied , esme nussbaum , with a calm voice , when she was sure that her superiors had spoken at the end , &quot; and i say nothing other than that we are effective than that we are doing that .
my concern is that we will not be able to agree on the future of the european union without warning .
this time , however , it is not the others that we have to teach our anger and mistrust .
luther rabinovitz formed with his hands a pyramid .
in order to avoid an angel &apos;s patience .
&quot; they go too far , &quot; he said , &quot; if they act as &quot; error &quot; , the ones our grandparents may or may not have committed .
they also go too far when they talk about the fact that they have their &quot; anger &quot; and their &quot; mistrust &quot; of &quot; other &quot; .
it should not be necessary to tell someone in their position that they are not the only ones who understand the past , as they are protecting the present , but rather the future .
there was no &apos; we &apos; and there was no &apos; other &apos; .
it was a time of disorder , it is all we know .
&quot; from which , if we are honest with ourselves , &quot; he dared to throw down esme , &quot; no part of society can claim to be good .
i do not complain to anyone .
whether it is bad or good , what happened is not .
that was then .
there is nothing more to say about this - we agree on that .
and , just as no blame must be assigned , so no blame must be paid .
but what is the past for when we do not learn from it - and we do not learn from it - and what is the future ?
the past serves to make them forget them .
if i may say something on this - and i am not saying anything about it - i am not going to say anything about it - i am not going to say anything about it - i am not going to say anything about it - i am talking about the commission .
luther rabinovitz left his pyramid .
&quot; i will have to consider your report , &quot; he said and dismissed it .
the next day , when you were ready to work , the first one was taken by a motorcyclist who , as passers-by described , was in a kind of &quot; brutal rage &quot; on foot .
random numbers exist .
lesotho military member says that no coup was planned ; prime minister remains in south africa .
officials of the military in lesotho argued that a coup would be a coup d &apos;état , and said that they would fight policemen who were denied the armed services of political fanatics .
prime minister thomas thabane fled the country and told that he would not be able to take over his residence .
the premier brought his family to the adjacent south africa after he was attacked by assassinations .
military spokesman major ntlele ntoi said that there is de facto no coup .
&quot; what happened this morning was that the staff of defense forces were led by lesotho , after he had discovered several intelligence reports .
south african prime minister margaret thatcher has been saying that the military action in the region seems to be a paralysis .
&quot; even if nobody claimed that the government was attacked by violence , the government is not aware of the fact that the government &apos;s activities are not being supported by lesotho &apos;s defence forces .
spokesmen of the lesotho military told us on sunday that the soldiers had been interrogated into their barracks and that the situation in the capital was quiet .
meanwhile , the council vice-president , mr mothén , takes over the government of the thabanes absent from the country .
thabane told us that he believed that he was not a member of the european union because of his attempt to combat corruption in the country .
in lesotho , there have been great tensions since june , after thabane parliamentary sittings were cancelled due to the disputes within his unity government .
he said that his actions had not prevented the government from acting in a different way , which is what he is accusing of .
production in the eurozone at a 13 month low level , with a low interest rate of 13 months , is a major factor in the economy .
the increase in production in the euro area slowed down in august to the lowest level in the last 13 months , so a precisely observed increase in the number of workers .
the final marker purchasing management index of the producing business is now available .
a figure of over 50 indicates an expansion .
new orders have been backdated and factories have experienced breakdowns at a time of rising tension between the eu and russia over ukraine .
the figures are very clear before the european central bank ( ecb ) meeting on thursday .
the markets expect the bank to draw up a clear plan for dealing with a slow recovery in the eurozone , as well as for the impending deflation at an inflation rate of only 0.3 % .
there are speculation that the euro ’ s head , mario draghi , will be in office this week .
&quot; although a small growth is better than no growth at all , the brakes on the growing economic and geopolitical uncertainty are not good for manufacturers .
the factory pmi for germany , the largest trading partner of russia in the eu , fell to the lowest level in 11 months with 51.4 .
meanwhile , the us has seen a decline in the world ’ s second largest economy , france , the pmi , to 46.9 .
france remains a troubled child , as is italy ’ s descent from a solid expansion to stagnation .
references to growth initiatives being taken in the key instrument of the lisbon strategy to germany and spain and the netherlands are no longer valid .
the fall in industry is probably causing the fire of analysts , who are demanding further monetary or fiscal incentives .
a positive news came from the republic of ireland , where the pmi was reduced to 57.3 , the highest level since the end of 1999 .
howard archer , chief economist at the ihs global insights , said : &quot; the best thing we can do for the purchasing manager is to reduce the manufacturing cost of the manufacturing industry in the euro area from august .
he added : &quot; producers in the eurozone find the lives of today apparently quite difficult , as the current increased geopolitical tensions - especially in relation to russia and ukraine - are uncertainties in the continuing difficult conditions in many countries .
these increased uncertainties have clearly highlighted the economy and the economy , particularly , and the confidence of consumers , and presumably leads to some orders being delayed or even cancelled , particularly large orders .
he said that it &apos; becoming more and more likely &apos; that the ecb will eventually become a kind of qe .
the hellfire of the survivors of beslan : ten years have passed since the terrible siege of the school , as the evidence suggests .
ten years ago , more than 1,000 people were killed by chechen militias in a school in beslan in southern russia as hostages .
more than 330 people , more than half of them children , were killed in the three-day martyrdom that the world was shocked , killed and wounded .
we are certified according to beslan , to provide some of the victims , who are exposed to death at the abomination in the classroom .
exactly a decade after the horrific siege of the school of beslan , in which 334 people were killed , including 186 children , the authorities warned heroic survivors of last night of a new apocalyptic .
as a fanatical islamist terrorist , i am very pleased to see children and parents on 1 september 2004 , the beginning of a new school year , taking place and killing .
the tragedy united west and east , in abhorrent , and the tragedy turned into a surprise .
ten years later , we moved to beslan , where we were able to see some of the victims who died at the atrocities in the classroom .
we found surprising young people who resisted resistance , who were not able to remembrate this terrorist hell forever .
their greatest hope is that they will be able to do so .
the fact that the war that has now struck ukraine - and in which children like them die - is now ending .
the girl who was trying to shoot was in the fragrance of the school sports hall .
it was founded by the russian star photographer dimitri beliakov .
what is completely confused is that aida sought her mother , larissa , now 40 years old .
both were sentenced to death , but they survived .
&quot; a woman told me i should be asked for my life , but i could not , &quot; said aida then .
my legs were blood flooded .
i stood up and climbed back into the ground to find my mother .
a soldier brought them to safety .
after a number of operations , she considered herself to be completely healed , but said yesterday : &quot; three months ago , the pain returned .
i fear that i am going to be operating again .
some pomegranate shards are still in my knee .
its aim is now to provide dental care .
&quot; this tragedy changed my life , but it has made me not broke , &quot; says she kampfustig .
&quot; that happened to me , and that is not something that can be changed .
once a year i always go to the sports hall to meet the people to be able to play .
my friends and i try to be not informed on other days .
the pain is too great .
my best friend and future piano teacher , i am very happy to have a look at the video .
we played together as we were small , and dreamed of being a little bit more than a school .
&quot; i don &apos;t want to marry until i finish my studies and finish my career .
to think of a family later .
she says that the siege is always part of it .
i am glad that many people have been able to remember our horrors and that we are so grateful for the help we have received from people in britain and everywhere .
when i take the photo online from me , how i go back to school , i think i can do many people .
the boy who was born by the ball hook , in which he thought his mother was dead , was a boy who was not able to get his son to die .
it was his first day of school ( russians go to school at 7 years ) and survived the three-day siege in the poor of his mother tamara .
as a seven year old , he said : &apos; mama told me i should not go out , if it is an explosion &apos; .
after an explosion he thought she would die .
she said to him : &quot; run . &quot;
full of fear , she could be dead , he fled and looked on the way a weeping infant , took it at hand and flew through a coil of a ball .
his father vladimir , who had his son out in the arms of the castle , said : &quot; damir told me that his mother died .
he said : &apos; i could not save you . &apos;
in reality , tamara was out there , and the government was beaten with leg injuries , in turn assuming that her son had died .
after their reunification , she said : &apos; i wept with joy .
i could not believe it .
he ran into and surrounded by the army , and he was a little bit wary of me .
damir was later moved to london ( from the now unresolved line of news of the world ) , to be taken over by the then premier tony blair and his wife cherie .
&quot; this horror is following you every day , but i wish i could be with the remembering , &quot; he said yesterday .
but i can say that there is no such thing in my memory .
i still know that i will be able to see all my toy gun immediately afterwards .
but now i can play computer games with shooting scenes and that is for me no problem .
&quot; i am not afraid to go into the sports hall , but i am thinking not about me , even after .
i remember the debate on these children , with whom i was playing in the courtyard , and who did not manage to go out .
we never say that they have been killed or killed .
we say that they are not able to stay in the sports hall .
i remember very well the work i had to do in london , especially the toy store , where i looked at everything .
but now he is afraid of place like ukraine , where wars are the kind of disaster that has caused him and his friends .
this horror is following you every day , but i wish i could stop .
&quot; i am so sorry to see all those who are among the abominations , &quot; said damir , the past week as a volunteer in a monastery .
i would like to help .
i will one day go to the police and i hope that you will bring me to the training academy next year .
his mother tamara , 48 , said : &quot; 37 children from our neighborhood were killed .
i remember the time of the terrible silence after the siege , there were simply no children , who were calling and beating .
it is a very lively reminder of her trip to london with damir .
the people of london were crying when i learned our story .
i understood then how people were looking at the other side of the world .
she was cherie blair and her foundation grateful for the prize and the opportunity to return to london in autumn 2004 .
i wish i could cherie call and her just go to the door to say that 10 years have passed , but i still remember the meeting i had with her and her husband in london , and how the damir and me helped .
i remember the time when the commission was happy to play borschtsch and you all had to eat all the local russian restaurants .
i remember that the president of keller was in a restaurant , and i was shocked by his water gun on them and they were running away and playing with him .
and that was just a month after the horror .
i was surprised that the british were so willing to accept our pain .
she said : &apos; i always think that this world is in these 10 years not better .
in ukraine , the war is now continuing , and every day people die , and i believe that many children have been killed and still have been killed .
these are exactly the children we have .
i think that for many the war is part of the news that they hear , when they have bored .
i simply know what these people feel , the whole horror .
and i cannot stop saying that .
nothing has changed , people want to be able to trust each other and the situation is so sad that they have to face up to the same fate .
damir became great and is very gentle and quiet .
he is not looking for revenge , for example , he is not overwhelmed by the past abominations .
i know that he is not keen to remember , but he has six close friends from the class and they go on occasionally to the sports hall and inflammation there candles .
when he was smaller , he suffered - i remember the first time he was in the house - and i was not able to see the face .
not sleeping , his eyes were open .
i remember also the fact that he all his weapons and other weapons were used to protect the children of the world .
i can hardly believe that i have been so safe for a few hours that he was dead and i never heard him again .
when i asked about the explosion and asked for the legs , i saw myself around , and saw the cave around me .
i was absolutely sure that my young boy was in this hell impossible to survive .
&quot; i remember that the first time i had asked him , &quot; damir , run , run away &quot; , but i was also so sure that he would not hear me .
but he has heard it and he has gone away .
and so life goes , unlike the life of many others , for us .
georgij ilyin , 17 years old , 17 years old , born in the netherlands .
the boy whose terrible image was created after the siege as a symbol of the abominations of beslan , was a man of desolation .
consolation : the beslan survivor georgij lyin , with his mother fatima after the siege in 2004 , a picture of georgij on the right today on georgia .
his bloodshed face was characterized by fear , when he asked for his life .
his image was one of the most shocking symbols of the barbarity of beslan .
his mother fatima , 54 , a doctor , had to leave him for his first day of school before she was out of haste to leave her elder son vladimir to the university .
&quot; i left the farm about two minutes before the terrorists had to crumble him , and so he remained my little boy there for three terrible days alone , &quot; recalls her .
not quite alone , there was a whole family of relatives of us , but they were all killed .
only my georgij managed to get survived .
the closer this date comes , the more difficult it is to remember that and how the european union is to speak about it .
there is not a single day on which we cannot abide by this tragedy .
we do not think that it is a long time ago , i think it would have happened yesterday , to see some scenes from these days , at least , follow me .
no one will ever forget that , i promise you .
i urge that the image of georgij ( left ) was one of the most shocking of the attack and was seen as a statue ( right ) .
i remember that the georgij was not able to attend the school on that day , but he said he wanted to let his teacher down .
i knew only when the council had been alive that he had been in the television .
and now there are even this statue of the weeping georgij in san marino .
georgij sees the image not like , and it is with us at home in the bookshelf .
i understand that , but i also think that people in all the world should be able to express our pain thanks to this image .
georgij says today : &apos; it is important to do something like this never again .
&quot; i doubt that the best way to do this is to know the truth .
people are investigating such tragedies and never experience the truth .
and now they are investigating the crash of these boeing in ukraine .
will we ever know what he is causing ?
this world will become something terrible .
&quot; i cannot understand how the system is possible , because if you want to ask people , nobody wants a war , so how is it done ?
ten years is nothing at all about such pain .
we need dozens of years to make it a little forgotten .
it has taken my health away and i feel it still .
about three or four years i had a couple of nightmares about the siege , but then it became better .
i went to the european parliament in 2004 and had a daily fear .
i thought of my friends and class mates , but the gestures were killed .
i am therefore always involved in the sports hall when the 1st of september approaches .
i will not repeat my old childhood friends .
it is difficult for me to go to the sports hall , but i must say it .
i feel not as a victim of this story , this is now part of my past .
i will not forget it , but i am sorry that i do not .
my life goes on .
i have the school completed this year and i visit a medical college in vladikawkaz .
i will be a heart surgeon .
my first choice was a training in the army .
i wanted to become a soldier , but my health did not let that happen .
i wanted to fight for my country , but that will not happen .
georgij faniyev , 20 years old , 20 years old , 20 years old , 20 years old , 20 years old , 20 years old , 20 years old , 20 years old , 20 years old , 20 years old , ...
the boy who survived , although he was at the foot of a murderous terrorist , was not able to find a way to stop the bombing .
a miracle : georgij fanijev was a member of the army during the siege .
during the siege , he was in the sports hall and sacked beside the bomb , the fire was at the foot of a murderous terrorist .
it is a miracle that he is not killed .
&quot; we feel it is as if it were yesterday , &quot; says georgij , who was a secret service officer for the fsb , but this is because of his health damage due to the siege .
it is still with me , it is nothing that i can hide behind me .
i am now older and the people say that children are easily confused with bad experiences - i have to say that is not true .
&quot; in 2006 i worked with psychologists and felt really a bit better after that , but i can not forget it .
and i would like to forget .
2005 - in the year after - was the first and only time that i was back in the sports hall .
i lost the awareness .
i will never go back there and ask you what you think of the situation .
survivors : georgij faniyev today , with a photo of himself in the hospital after the siege on the laptop .
my pain is immense and i am wearing it every day with me .
my friends know that i do not like to think about it or talk about it , and they never asked me about school .
the physical and mental aspect of my work is good .
i should be careful with my injured knee , but i can now run well .
but because of my health i could not participate in the secret service academy of the fsb in saint petersburg , as i wanted .
i have read my documents , including the medical ones , and you have replied that it is not possible .
my second passion was the animals , so i went to the vet institute .
i have already spent two years there .
he learns to treat all animals &quot; from cats to cows &quot; .
he said : &apos; i knew that the european parliament would never be able to tell my children about my experiences .
this is something that children should not know about , and they should not , of course , suffer .
his mother marina , 42 , said : &quot; this pain leaves me never .
he is in my soul , worse if the anniversary of the fall of the earth .
i will return to the celebrations to commemorate .
i know that georgia has not been allowed to go .
it must be given much more force .
i waited home to him and could not help .
i am so grateful to god that he gave me back , and here in beslan all of them are drawn .
it remains for us .
georgij is now an adult , but this horror is still a reality in him .
it is difficult to accept that if a little is so unfair .
it is a young man who likes sport , but he can not be able to participate because of his knee .
he has been operating on several occasions , he can run but not drive a sport .
i would say that he has been the horror of 50 % .
this terrible experience will always be with us .
many friends and neighbours were arrested when the siege was taking place , and this only reinforces my pain .
i have lost many people i have been well aware of and who are expensive to me .
my son is in my room , and that is the greatest gift that god can make me , but my heart crumbs around the killed .
i know of families where new children are born , but also of widows who are not always born .
it is difficult to accept that life should continue , even if you do not want it .
i will never forget how my heart is sprung in me when i saw him in the hospital .
and now i see what is happening in the world - wars in other regions .
what are these people fighting for ?
why do you kill each other ?
the war has now been very close to our country and i almost cannot believe it .
we used to be a friendly country , how can it be that we are fighting now ?
people and children suffer , i am sure that in ukraine already many children have been killed .
if we only want to support all these rebels and throw them out - as far as possible .

the baby that is so acutely infected by a special intervention command in safety is a child that is not only a child but also a child .
the new version of the new version of the game is now available .
it is now ten ( right ) and does not remember the cruel things that have happened in the past .
the world held the breath in 2004 , when the baby aljona was born in the arms of a russian policeman from the siege of beslan .
terrorists let them go , but did not keep their cruelty to 30 years old mother , who was 10 years old sister kristina and her brother makhar in school sports hall .
makhar , then three years old , escaped , but aljonas &apos;s mother and sister died in the murderous memorial .
her father ruslan has since been married again .
aljona , today ten years old , does not remember the siege and is at an intelligent and happy destination for girls .
&quot; you are now a great happy family and aljona and makhar are both great friends .
ruslan is a fantastic place to live and to offer you all the memories you have been waiting for with the tenth anniversary .
you will understand why .

if you would like to see photos or videos under water , there is a selection of devices .
the cheapest option is a waterproof pool-and-burn .
i have taken these photos at a family party with several cameras , all of which are available at a price of less than $ 350 .
regardless of the equipment , there are some rules for the best results .
check your equipment twice .
even if you are a waterproof camera , make sure that the camera is not in the same position as the other compartments .
put your camera on the photos or videos .
some cameras and camcorder have scene and sound recordings , but with this the camera can be adjusted to the shock .
and before they jump in , check that the whole world is in the depths of your equipment .
some cameras are only available for up to 5 feet , others up to 50 or 60 feet .
search our shopping guide and the reviews for digital cameras for herbal medicines .
make multiple recordings - because many do not fall .

even if you are an lcd , it is difficult to do this under water , and the right setting is a lucky one .
so make many shots .
if your camera is connected to the camera in order to capture a number of shots with slightly changed exposure settings , you can use the camera .
stay close to the surface .
the light is getting worse , the further you move away from the surface .
if possible , they will remain close to the surface if they are able to take pictures in a pool , a lake or the sea .
this allows you to add more color to your photos ; the deeper you go , the less color you will see .
go close to the objects and then go to the objects .
this is also a good advice on land , but it is all the more important under water because of poor light conditions .
it is particularly important that you are familiar with an action cam .
andrew lawson was a man of the sort. his character was changed , even in a world as gigantic as the nhs .
as a consulting anaesthetist , he devoted his career to the task of helping the sick to both agony of the disease and the pain of treatment .
among his patients , the doctor remembers , was a mi6 employee who had to deal with the devastating effects of torture .
lawson knew that he was the physician of the diagnoses and diseases that were most important , while the treated were mostly treated with something quite different : pain .
one day in 2007 he was the one who was the passionate way of doing so .
&quot; i have not felt myself to be &quot; wrote him in may this year .
i had difficulty getting up and up .
while he was dealing with flu symptoms , he noticed that the symptoms of the disease were not as pleasant as his wife juliet .
&quot; i want to do everything immediately rather than later , &quot; he noted .
when juliet was on a business trip for a week , he felt like a man .
something is wrong with the fact that the commission has not yet done anything .
he asked a colleague to send an x-ray inspection of his chest .
only two weeks ago , he was in the french alps for skiing .
the result of the x-ray inspection was before .
he suffered from mesotheliom , a sinister cancer , which had the breast coat , the skin of the lungs , and which was then attacked .
as with most cancer cases , the risk of the disease is not always very clear .
while some smokers , for example , suffer from lung cancer , not all lung cancer is diagnosed .
but mesotheliom is different .
in almost all cases , the shutter release is a exposure to asbestos - contact with the fibre material that was once called a &quot; miracle &quot; but has now been recognized as fatal .
for most of us , mesotheliom is a disease that can be ignored like easily .
asbestos is , after all , a product of the past .
the most dangerous asbestos type has been used in britain since the 1960s , when the industry freelessly committed to using it not more .
even where he still used it , he only worked in certain industries .
as an industrial risk material from a different time , it seems to be hardly more worrying today .
but this complacency is misplaced .
britain , it seems , is now experiencing the culmination of a mesolthelium epidemic .
there are more deaths from mesotheliom here than in any other country in the world .
with a total of 2,500 deaths per year , twice as many people die of this disease as in road accidents .
annual figures of the mesothelium deaths since 1980 and expected effects of the disease in britain are expected to be more than 50 % in the future .
the reason we are not able to control the deadly effects now , although asbestos has been illegal for years ( 1999 , all types of asbestos were banned ) is that a measuring oxide only develops after decades .
and the scourge of the mesotheliom is not confined to former construction workers .
asbestos was , and is often still , present in the houses we live in , the offices where we work , the schools , in which we learn and the shops we live in .
and so mesotheliom does not know class limits , financial limits , professions or age .
the privileged baštians , which are elegant department stores in london and private schools , are not a sanctuary .
the parliament buildings are contaminated with asbestos .
in hospitals , too , where we are healthy , we have to be seen as starting points .
andrew lawson was not old .
he was not a plumber either .
it was not possible for him to be prepared to imagine where he might be able to deal with asbestos .
then he found out .
&quot; it looks like the world is becoming more and more crowded in the tunnels at guy &apos;s hospital , where i spent six years in my training .
all students , nurses , doctors , and nurses are welcome to use the tunnel to get to the city .
one wonders how many of my fellow members of the same family will suffer from the same disease ?
this question was unfortunately at least partly answered .
&quot; of the four doctors who are working at the guy &apos;s hospital , the first of these is the patient &apos;s health .
as many of us will become ill ?
andrew lawson was born in new york city , new york , where he was 48 years old .
when he was elected president of the european parliament on 17 february of this year , he was 55 .
this was an unusually long period of survival .
fifty per cent of all mesotheliotheliotheliothelium diseases die within 8 months of diagnosis .
the disease always ends up lethal .
we can therefore only call lawson &apos;s question : &apos; how many of us will be still ill ? &apos;
the leading expert in britain on mesotheliom , professor julian peto , is taking on the assumption that between 1870 and 2050 , when asbestos epidemic is expected to erase in britain in total , there will be 90,000 victims .
most of them are not yet ready to be used .

a quick look at the files of the courts , to which the people concerned often refer for claims for compensation , shows how far the intellectual property scourge of the mesothelium is already spreading .
in june of this year marks &amp; spencer , for example , admitted that janice had taken all negligent asbestos off .
she worked for nine years for the chain , from 1978 to 1987 , and was responsible for the garments department at two locations - one of them the flagship store in the oxford street .
mrs. all was only 18 years when they started their activities at m &amp; s .
now it has two children in the 1920s .
&quot; this is the thing she says , &quot; had i never heard of mesotheliom , i knew that it was not really a matter of asbestos .
i never thought that i would have been concerned .
there are few people who are very concerned about asbestos .
the fact is that the term asbestos does not have a substance but a group of six minerals .
the name derives from the word &quot; asbestos &quot; , a description of the fibre structure that makes the fabric resistant and flexible .
three of the six were sold in the construction industry .
chrysotil , also known as a white asbestos , is now by far the most commonly found in asbestos in buildings .
it was designed for roof panels , floor tiles , rohri-insulations , boilers , even for brake linings in cars .
it is less lethal than other forms of asbestos , but it is still considered by the eu and the who as &apos; major health risk &apos; with possible deaths .
more dangerous , however , is the brown asbestos ( amosite ) and the blue asbestos ( krokydolith ) .
britain was once the world ’ s largest importer of brown asbestos , and experts suspect that &quot; there are clear but indirect indications that the matter is a major cause of the uniquely high levels of mesotheliomia .
an employee of marks &amp; spencer was born in the flagship store in oxford street , london , asbestos alamy .
janice allen has perhaps not been a typical mesotheliomopfer .
he has carried out a study by those concerned , which shows that &apos; a significant proportion of the mesotheliomas are present without known suspension by work or in the house presumably through asbestos contact in the environment &apos; .
much of these contacts are based on the &quot; normal use and aging of energy &quot; of our buildings .
it looks as if the european union is not sure that the money will be spent .
a report by goddard consulting , which has given the palace of westminster a look at how the people of the heart of the government , unknowingly , are exposed to the substance .
in 2009 , goddard reported that the service shafts and pipes were behind the committee rooms of parliament with asbestos contaminated , whose fatal facts were destroyed by something as harmless .
members of parliament are often accused of trying to get their own interests into the hands of , but here it seems that the european union is doing the opposite .
while the management of the parliamentary labour service insisted that the westminster palace be a &quot; clean health witness &quot; , the council was not allowed to take a decision on this .
the goddard report also pointed out that the &apos; european union &apos;s existence is not a guarantee of safety in accordance with the relevant provisions . &apos;
no one can know whether this mismanagement will cost lives .
everything you can do now is to wait .
a person who has contact with asbestos could never exactly determine graham abbott , a general practitioner .
as andrew lawson suspects , the 50-year-old abbott will be able to work in hospitals to stop asbestos .
&quot; i have been in a hospital where i have been able to receive complaints about asbestos , &quot; he says , &quot; but i can &apos;t prove it in my case .
it is so difficult to remember all places where the world was once working .
what he still has to remember is the day at the beginning of december 2009 when he was a kind of fever .
he was 45 , and led just late evening an operation .
suddenly i had a shaken frost .
it suddenly came .
i felt terrible , however .
i thought the trip to home was not more to create .
as a doctor , abbott knew that the pain was caused by the chest coat , the skin around his lungs .
but , as janice alles had no reason to be a mesotheliom .
he went one month not to work .
i was surprised by doctors who made x-rays of their breast and put pleurakathether on to produce liquid from the lungs .
his complaints , however , remained undiagnosed .
his health improved slowly , and he returned to his father &apos;s job .
from time to time , the symptoms returned , often after sports activity .
in 2011 , a patient abbott with similar symptoms came to his practice and was later treated with mesotheliom .
but now , abbott again did not conform to his own case .
after all , his patient was several decades older and had directly contact asbestos .
the connection in this case was clear .
in september 2011 , abbott ’ s condition deteriorated again , and his doctor brought his ct scans and x-ray recordings to a group of experts .
in december 2011 , exactly two years after abbott committed to the first time to being sick , the first time that he had had had had been sent to the cave of the rib and chest coat .
i am an optimist .
i usually do simple things , &quot; says he .
frankly , i had not really expected so many .
but rachel , my wife , was worried .
the result of the biopsy was between christmas and new year .
graham abbott : diagnosis of mesotheliom
suddenly , abbott had to set dates with macmillan nurses , from whom a woman received him , and had a job .
only now did he see the extent of the epidemic .
&quot; it turned out that asbestos is very widespread , especially in large public buildings , where red and white pipes often are isolated with asbestos .
the people who are exposed to asbestos in these buildings are now sick .
and so mesotheliom hit younger people who are not in the typical professions .
the most dangerous pipes with asbestos insulation in hospitals were located under the ground , so patients probably were not exposed to the substance .
but many employees who work in pedestrian tunnels from one building to another are not aware of the fact that they are not working in the underground areas .
it is clear that , over several decades after the war , hospitals have been providing patients with life-saving , but life-threatening care .
it is still being removed today .
students put their bunsenbrenner on asbestos mats .
and it does not only concern hospitals .
asbestos was born in the united states on the basis of its fabulous insulating and flame-retardant properties .
schools too .
indeed , many people may have seen the first asbestos contact in the classroom .
everywhere in the country , in thousands of chemical lessons , students have their bunsenbrenner burners on asbestos mats .
on websites , the subject of asbestos is frequently mentioned in schools .
and meanwhile , so innocent objects have lost their lives in our houses , such as floor tiles or scalp shelters .
&quot; it is an industrial poison that is used in large parts of our properties , &quot; andandrew morgan , the lawyer , says that andrew lawyer .
in one case , the only contact that could be made to a woman affected was the demolition of a shed in the 1970s .
so be careful how you can make your garden shed out .
the effects of the diagnosis , as we know that the disease is incurable , are immense .
&quot; it takes a while to hide the data , &quot; says graham abbott .
i went back to work and tried to continue .
i was in the practice for two weeks .
then i knew that i was going and going to be around myself .
well , i will not be another christmas party .
with the greatest difficulty , the prospects for the change from a doctor to a doctor in a patient &apos;s position were very difficult .
how many patients before him reminds him that the excess of the body is overwhelming .
&quot; it was very difficult to take up all of this , &quot; he says .
&quot; i asked my doctor &quot; how long did i have ? &quot;
and they gave me about 12 months .
i remember that the first time i thought i had been there , &quot; well , i don &apos;t want to see any more christmas .
that &apos;s it then . &quot;
mesotheliom is particularly insidious because it is our life-saving mechanism - breathing itself - that is , the lethal cancer .
most cases of mesotheliom are caused by asbestos contact .
asbestos is made up of smallest fibres .
if the asbestos is checked and the fibres are inhaled , you can feel comfortable in the chest coat , the skin around the lungs .
asbestos fibres irritate the chest coat and can cause cell mutations .
&quot; the problem arises with the inhaled needle-shaped asbestos fibres , &quot; according to professor tom treasure , a heart thread fiber , who was born in 2001 to the guy &apos;s hospital .
the hospital , which i know andrew lawson suspects , is a hospital in asbestos , which is now ironic .
treasure canadian knew that he was dealing with some other , the presumably also during her training in the hospital , asbestos .
once the asbestos needles have reached lung tissue , treasure says , &quot; they will be taken away from the respiratory process , where the skin is .
by nature , it is always indispensable to the future .
the usual options for other cancers work in mesotheliom not as well .
the effectiveness of an operation is , for example , highly controversial .
some say that they have tried to do so .
treasure verningen the thing .
&quot; you can use the chest coat without having to cut it out , &quot; he says .
they come with the knife not around .
meanwhile , the cancer speaks &quot; on chemotherapy not very good , &quot; the &quot; effect &quot; shows , but not heals .
&quot; sometimes there are long-term survivors , &quot; says treasure .
but in the end they all die .
fortunately , some patients actually live long , much longer than expected .
the author stephen jay gould died 20 years after the diagnosis .
two and a half years after his own diagnosis , graham abbott is still fighting .
after being a mesotheliom , he came to the contact with andrew lavson , who had been in charge of the treatment four years after his diagnosis .
&quot; hello , cancer headquarters , &quot; he wondered about the way to go on call .
&quot; he was very positive , &quot; says abbott .
he had his diagnosis 4 years earlier and was still very active .
originally , abbott had six chemotherapy cycles .
&quot; i was desperate , &quot; he says .
i wanted to give up .
lawson was able to &quot; remedy things in a more positive way &quot; .
after consulting several doctors , the doctor decided to take the treatment .
&quot; we had an advantage by being not able to be forwarded , i called simply to and ordered the item to be delivered &quot; gives graham .
a normal patient would have a bank transfer , and on the authorization of treatment would have to wait .
money is crucial for the mesotheliom sufferers to find the best available therapies .
but if these treatments are inevitably to be absent , we will face many affected by a different financial concern - about the future of families , the future of their families .
and so you contact the courts in the hope of compensation .
andrew lawson contacted andrew morgan of fieldfield fisher wagner about the new project .
&quot; it has been known since 1898 that asbestos is extremely dangerous for health , &quot; says morgan .
but what has happened in the 1960 ’ s is that it was recognized that the same was also a very low burden on health .
and here began the negligence of companies to play a role .
andrew lawson and guy &apos;s hospital put their case to the court , but it was not what he was doing to create a &quot; full compensation &quot; .
after the investigation to his death , a spokesman of the guy &apos;s confirmed that &quot; the asbestos fibres in the cellar concerned were not allowed to be removed in the 1990s . &quot;
this was a very important point for andrew lawson .
as asbestos can be removed , the way in which asbestos can be removed is also clear .
indeed , it is difficult for mesotheliom sufferers to seek compensation because they have a huge problem , the deadly asbestos contact of a company or a job - usually decades after the previous incidents .
many of their previous employers have been sold or closed .
insurance documents can be lost .
and those who oppose claims are not the ones who are the ones who will be able to do so , but certainly not the ones who are .
in response , there was a clear new legislative initiative this year , which would allow mesotheliom stakeholders to make their own compensation .
the law has created a legal framework for the protection of the insurance industry of £ 350 million for all who have been made diagnosed after july 2012 , and who have been able to prove contact , but cannot bring a complaint to anyone .
in these cases , the plaintiffs receive 80 % of what a court can do in a normal process of compensation to them - about 120,000 cents .
about 300 successful applications from the program are submitted each year .
andrew morgan thinks like so many mesotheliom-affected that 350 million £ is a &quot; very good job &quot; of the insurance industry .
&quot; this is a deal of insurers for insurers , &quot; he says , and suggests to be the first to be a &quot; deal &quot; .
mike penning , damalist working and working life adviser , also gave the go-ahead to the law .
but both penny-morgan admitted that , with seven deaths and a total of around 500 people dying every day , rapid action is needed .
&quot; people suffer so much and need help today , &quot; said penning during the second hearing of the mesotheliom law in december last year .
at that time , graham abbott had been in the hands of prof. loic lang-lazdunski for 19 months .
after your first consultations , lang-lazdunski recommended an operation that he had not been able to prevent , unlike tom treasure .
this was done by a radiation therapy and a chemotherapy - a three-fold treatment .
abbott felt stronger .
&quot; this is of course with the most important , &quot; abbott says .
this is something that we see again and again in patients .
there is something that is going to make you go on .
if you give up , it goes very fast .
graham abbott underwent a major renovation in march 2012 .
at the end of august , he had the last of the six chemotherapy cycles behind him .
the scanning of after-care products did not indicate any signs of the disease .
then i had the opportunity to make a scan in march 2014 .
there were several cancer fleets around my breast .
i was just 50 years old and i was just 50 years old .
that is not life-threatening .
this is life-ending .
again , abbott undertook six chemotherapy cycles .
now , there is no trace of tumor anymore visible .
but the process is physically and psychologically very exhausting .
they must be thinking of practical things - about money , if i am not more , for example , or show my wife how the boiler time setting works .
if you have received bad news , you will be negative .
you must look forward .
as the father of ellie , 16 , and tamsin , 14 , the same is not always easy .
&quot; for parents , this is difficult , &quot; he says .
it is difficult to know what to say and how much .
when i first started my diagnosis , i told my girl that i had a disease that i could not live with .
it was very different .
tamsin is very sociable and unstupid .
they told us to tell their friends and we soon got a lot of calls .
ellie was cautious .
she did not say much .
such talks are something that all cancer patients should be able to make .
but for mesotheliogram rangers such discussions are not hopeless , not from a trace of hope for survival .
the disease causes ( as it eventually does for stepens jacky goould ) a flurry of security .
as andrew morgan says , &quot; mesotheliom is not life-threatening .

china is refusing to grant hong kong the right to government , demonstrators are retaliating , and the chinese are retaliating .
on sunday , the chinese parliament decided , despite the increasing calls for democratic reforms , to vote against the nomination of candidates for the 2017 elections by the hong kong electorate .
this procedure is probably the best way to convince the long-announced protests in hong kong &apos;s business district , while activists are planning and mobilising within a few hours of the announcement .
the chinese people ’ s congress ’ s decision allows communist leaders to “ take all the peking-fights from candidates away . ”
&quot; this is not unexpected , but it makes us angry , &quot; said legal expert emily lau , chairman of the democratic party .
that is not what peking promised .
the inhabitants of honduras were being lied to .
and it is clear that we are dealing with an authoritarian regime that is not .
in his defense of china ’ s decision , li fei , vice secretary general of the permanent committee of the national people ’ s congress , said that the admission of public nominations in the hong kong government ’ s elections to “ chaotic ” .
since 1997 , when britain lost control of hong kong to the chinese , the chinese have been forging ahead with the idea of leaving the people in government from 2017 .
china ’ s leaders presented the sunday decision as a democratic breakthrough , because it gave the hong kong people a direct election right to vote , but the decision also made it clear that the chinese leadership was going to change the process through a closely controlled beijing .
after a new clause , it is also proposed that only candidates who are &apos; with love for the country and love for hong kong &apos; should be allowed to do so .
the decision follows a summer in which some of the largest and most popular film festivals in the world are taking place in hong kong for several years .
behind the pro-democratic campaign in hong kong is the occupy central movement with love and peace .
on sunday evening , the european parliament and the council had agreed to a new convention within a few hours of the announcement .
the demonstration was attended by the organizers saying that their movement was going to take a new stage of civil disobedience and that they will be able to plan protest waves in the coming weeks .
they did not , however , specify any more , apparently , about problems with the authorities .
in an online communication , the organizers informed that the movement &quot; the besieged the central district only as the last means in consideration &quot; .
we are sorry to say that the commission is now in full agreement with all the options for dialogue and that the occupation of the central district has definitely taken place .
the authorities in hong kong have been working on the announcement of beijing &apos;s intention to close the negotiations with the chinese authorities on sunday .
the riots are being stirred by the feeling of many in hong kong that they are slowly losing control of their city .
the addition of people from the mainland increases competition for products and services .
moreover , fear of the us and china ’ s values being violated is growing .
some criticized the occurrences of occupy centre movement , because it did not stop business - the life cycle of hong kong &apos;s - from being put at risk .
&quot; protests , which you talk about , could have major economic damage , the more you have to suffer , the more you will suffer .
we do not want to raise any fears that hong kong will be overturned .
this impression is bad for investment .
the state-controlled media of china reported that the chinese government has recently reported on the democratic activists in hong kong as being threatened by western powers .
this summer , activists organised an unofficial referendum in which the election rights of the people of the country were shared by 780,000 people - more than one fifth of the hong kong electorate .
in july , tens of thousands took part in one of the largest democratic demonstrations in the region ’ s history .
the tradition of school leaving balls in the us is now being extended to universities , where freshmen appear .
we are looking forward to responding to this demand and to be able to offer the first luxurious uk travel service to students today .
to make an impressive performance at the university , we have developed a new platform for transportation experts .
mr stewart also stated that the service is a security part .
this service is an ideal alternative for students who would otherwise have their own habits in a dangerously overloaded car .
together with our new vif options we look forward to working with you to make sure that the students have the opportunity to study the university with a minimum of effort and luxury .
a business search engine said that the number of new bookings has not yet been made , as the service has only just been introduced , but added that the &quot; students have not yet fully completed the service in the coming weeks &quot; .
the company also announced that it had not received any applications for the study , despite the tuition fees of £ 9,000 per year .
students today are different in their expectations and demands from the students on 10 , 20 , 30 or 40 years ago - it is more important than ever to have a great first impression , and with visa , you can get exactly that .
the national student union criticised the service as a separate issue .
megan dunn , vice president of the nus for higher education said : &quot; this offer seems to be completely separate from the lives of the majority of students .
many students who have been working this month will see themselves facing a crisis of living costs .
feminists criticize race and police behavior after far beyond ferguson
the unarmed teenager was born in the early hours of this month by a police officer in ferguson , mo .
the participants raised their hands in the air and sang , &quot; hands high , not shoot , &quot; while they were standing before funeral .
after two weeks of protests in ferguson , mo , due to the shooting of the unarmed teenager michael brown , i noticed the bloggers of miriam zoila perez a change in online .
after your experience , white feminist commentators are putting gender before the race , when it comes to fighting real reproductive rights and income inequality .
while tensions in the middle west have risen , and attention has been paid to the whole country , perez saw that white women ’ s responses to the breed were 100 % racial .
compared to the answers black women briefly after the students , the 9th of august , personal essays with tips and tricks like &quot; thoughts on ferguson by a white woman &quot; and &quot; feminism is not only about oppression .
but for perez , this meant an important change .
&quot; i do not think that you can be a lot of people in feminism who are able to be knowledge and enjoy privileges in such a high class way , &quot; she said .
people felt the need to be able to do something about the events that took place .
it is characteristic of the crisis in which we are in and because the situation in far east is so ethnic and so different from that in the west .
for english professors koritha mitchell of the ohio state university , she brought ferguson problems that the black economy has not been able to face every day , but which are not considered as &apos; women &apos;s issues &apos; .
&quot; i can find something funny on facebook about me and my partner and get 150 litres of everywhere .
if i can post something about how coloured in your own country can be used under siege , the silence is ears bewildering .
&quot; how can it be safe for women to talk publicly about a relationship , but not about security in public space ? &quot; he asked .
for black women and mitchell , who are racial , sex and sexuality in the history of the us , there is no dense culture between race and religion .
for them , black women do not have the luxury of being able to clean up the subjects ; they live every day in the combined reality .
while white women are now raising the issues of race and sex in feminist mainstream circles , they say that they are not the ones who are the ones who are the subject of gender research .
&quot; between 1865 and 1890 , at least 10,000 black men were gelyncht and the justification was almost always the rape of a white woman , &quot; said hattery .
white women had to be involved in the story to get the lynch murder .
for hattery came the division between white and black women on the point where they were white fighters .
&quot; they met the decision to opt for the right to vote for women , and the right to vote for black people should come later , &quot; said hattery .
if you remember such things , you will be powerfully aware of why coloured women are white women not dare .
we have done our job not well .
we have never been able to help black women to get their husbands and sons to protect .
even after women had been granted the right to vote in 1920 , it took a decade for women to become independent of the lynx in the association .
the group was founded almost 40 years after the original request for help from black women , says mitchell .
for mitchell , the flood of white feminist reactions to the violence that ferguson raised - police behavior , racial discrimination - is a mirror of the time when female white feminist men &quot; catch &quot; .
&quot; would it not be great if the activists who are talking about such traditional feminist platforms were to have the right to education of a child so seriously sewn as they do with the right to receive it ?
feminists of the second generation , who have completed their careers in the struggle for reproductive rights and access to contraception , are now in a position to understand that what the means is .
the famous white feminist activist gloria stringer went to the city two weeks after the shooting of michael brown .
&quot; i hope that women who have a different but parallel relationship will be able to find a new one inherent to the body .
although steep is a more intersectional feminism , in which rape and religion are not included , it is not the case that some of your comments on racial issues are very much in evidence in america .
christina sommer , researcher at the american enterprise institute and author of the university of applied sciences , usa .
there are now hundreds of specific programmes for girls and young women , but almost nothing for boys .
but when the white house recently opened a small program , my brother &apos;s key , i was able to see the vulnerable people in black and heat .
the relationship between the police and the black community is not the only problem that has developed into the foreground of the mainstream feminism .
after the us border police had collected nearly 63,000 unaccompanied minors at the southwest border of the country this year , the country &apos;s issue of immigration reform is also appearing again - this time as a women &apos;s issue .
andrea mercado , co-chair of we belong together , an organization that supports women in immigrant reform .
&quot; they speak for themselves , &quot; said mercado .
if the vast majority of the work visas are sent to male immigrants , they will be women who they accompany .
&quot; these stories find a sustainable in the women &apos;s organisations , &quot; she said .

leonidas asked the glady-diatorenarena to take part in the gladiator arena .
not only the gladiators were standing on the ankle in the matsch at the first rheinbacher römertag in the park .
but the attraction of the event was strong enough to be able to attract more than 1000 visitors yesterday , who will visit the rainshowers and the autumn cold trotted and will be able to escape from the historic spectacle .
there was a colourful ripening of representations , performances , games , exhibition pieces and information about the time of the romans and their importance for the rhine land .
the main attraction of the day was undoubtedly the martialistic force of the army of the gladiator school &quot; aomor mortis &quot; , which had to fight every rainy break to stay in the city with soft sand .
gladiator owners &quot; leonidas &quot; are able to prove themselves humorous and competent .
first , the &quot; provocateurs &quot; were in the row with rectangular shield and short sword , as well as legs on the left leg and armrail on the right arm .
the first two were the &quot; essedarii &quot; with a breast shield , short sword and a litter and iron gladiator ring .
the hotel was very clean and the staff were very helpful .
we are not sure whether the swords are metallic , the shields are shepperts and the litter lanes are going through the arena , so that a fear and a bite could be created for the health of gladiaters .
but i was not able to respond to the imposing &quot; summa rudis &quot; , the muscular referee , an always attentive eye .
&quot; we wanted to make the daily life of rome revive and to preserve the culture of the roman era &quot; , explains the lord of the rings euskirchen , chairman of the organizer &quot; giro römerkanal &quot; .
after two years of preparation , the leisure park for a day became a &quot; opportunistic &quot; romantic &quot; .
after all , the romans have not only fought war and conquest in our region , but also the roman culture and numerous buildings that we still admire today .
remains of these were also found at the roman day .
the frontinus company provided the water and energy supply once and now , and business leaders were petra fricke , who knew : &quot; we are still making use of the knowledge of the past &quot; .
this also confirms the diploma of surveying engineers ralph heiliger of the &quot; engineering team two &quot; from rheinbach , the surveying instruments of the romans as chorobat , groma or dioptra .
the roman villa in blankenheim presented ski equipment for the first time in the history of the city .

in 2011 , the office of landmark maintenance had a meeting with the rheinland regional office to examine the remains of a roman villa in the nord industrial park in rheinbach .
they have fencing walls of an economic building with a darre to dry from grain .
the building probably led to a villa rustica , a farm , which explains the history of the archaeological site dr. jennifer morscheiser .
a number of finds were found in these excavations , which were in a glass display .
the villa was probably built from the first to the fourth century ad to christ , until the collapse of the germans in the roman empire .
the company was founded in 1985 by the founder of the company , the founder of the company , and the owner of the company was the founder of the company .
at the roman thermal spas in zülpich , children were allowed to put mosaics themselves , at the stand of the glass museum rheinbach glasmosaics and to participate at the eifel nettersheim nature centre .

ebola : the epidemic is burdening west africa ’ s economy
the ebola epidemic in west africa is also a serious blow to the economy .
markets are orphaned - and international companies are distance .
the devastating ebola epidemic has given western africa &apos;s economy a heavy blow .
the harvest is rotated in fields that are mineral deposits and markets are watered down - the virus has left the region hard to cope with .
some international companies are already taking a distance .
&quot; the ebola epidemic is not only a medical crisis , but also an economic one , &quot; the chief of the african development bank , donald kaberuka , has said .
liberia is hardest hit , and the situation is worse .
&quot; it is a total disaster , we lose a lot of money , &quot; says alhaji bamogo , who is on the second largest market in liberia &apos;s capital , monrovia .
the market is only the one who can produce food or something to disinfect ebola .
liberia is hardest hit by the virus , gradually losing its livelihood .
recently , the health authorities , the disease was in every corner of the country , said .
in guinea , sierra leone and nigeria , too , the virus has spread .
overall , more than 1500 people have died , thousands more were put in .
foreign companies are attracting employees from abroad .
throughout the resource rich countries , companies are continuing to operate .
foreign companies such as the steel group arcelor mittal are relocating their employees , several international airlines are flying the affected regions .
the local dealers and farmers are also reacting : few merchants are still leaving their home markets to buy supplies .
in some areas in sierra leone and liberia , which are suffering quarantine , the situation is rotting , among other things , the caspian and poultry crops that are important for export .
farmers dare not vote for the harvest , but they do .
food is scarce , and food is scarce .
&quot; people are becoming less and less travelling , &quot; says phillipe de vreyer , paris expert for the economy of west africa .
the man , for example , who normally goes to the market and sells his vegetables , would rather stay at home .
the population therefore receives the consequences of the epidemic directly and urgently : food is being scarce .
in the markets , the prevalence of basic food such as rice is diminishing .
at the same time , the highly dependent region of international firms is threatening to create an image – with far-reaching consequences .
the greatest danger is that international companies will basically leave the area for a long time , says philippe hugon of the french think tank iris .
it is crucial to know how far and how long the virus will spread .
investors may think that the &quot; real &quot; is a dangerous situation in guinea , sierra leone and liberia .
the disease also places a strained burden on the state budgets of the states of the states of the european union , which are in a difficult state .
the disease also places a heavy burden on the already stringent national budgets of the states concerned .
the credit rating agency moody &apos;s is afraid that the european union &apos;s budget will be heavily influenced by the high expenditure on health care and , in addition , by the worsening economy .
the african development bank promised to provide the health systems of the countries concerned with eur 60 million ( $ 45 million ) .
the effects of this are also noticeable in nigeria , where so far few ebola cases have been diagnosed .
while oil rich region in the southern niger delta has not been affected so far .
but elsewhere , there are many people who are already being left out of fear of infection .
reservations in hotels are also clearly lower .

the patronage has been given to mayor wolfgang wild and secretary of state albert füracker .
the original name &quot; protective society tannenwald berngau &quot; dates from 1907 when the first german forest protection association was founded on march 21 .
the nazi regime had the dissolution of the association in 1937 .
it was only in 1964 that 19 young men were found , who were born on 30 april in the guesthouse lukas , the &quot; neue schützenverein &quot; tannenwald &quot; berngau .
karl march and adolf ried conducted the association as a protector through a difficult initial stage .
as early as the fall of 1965 , the schützenverein started its activities in the inn &quot; leininger &quot; with two teams .
in the following years , the us sports shooters , who have now been organized in seven teams , established themselves in all classes until the 1st gaulliga .
the association record was reached in the first half of the year and the magical limit of 380 rings was first reached in 1980 by rudi meier .
as the performance of the active protection increases , the protection of the environment has also increased .
after the club &quot; lone ininger &quot; was no longer able to meet the demands of a modern protector association , the association has decided to extend its activities to the former management , led by johann rinn .
after working at 2700 hours , the company issued a contract on 8 may 1988 with the parish strasser for the new protective rooms .
one of the great highlights of the association &apos;s history was certainly the 44th gault , combined with the celebration of the festive weights of the new flag in july 1991 .
on 23 and 24 april 1994 , the schützenverein founded its 30-year anniversary .
1995 is a böllergruppe .
josef schmalzl was born in berlin .
a major challenge for the &quot; böllere &quot; and for the club as a whole was the orientation of the bavarian böllertreffen 2005 .
in many hours of volunteer work , the club members last year took the premises and the shooting facility in the berngau hof to modernize and thus updated the state of the art .
eleven teams in lap competitions are fighting for the last 15 years .
you can also see the sporting achievements of the schützenverein .
overall , 11 teams are currently participating in the round competitions : six air teams , six air guns , one air gun team and two team .

the 2nd team with verena moosburger alexandra meier , eva schuhmann and tobias graml is from the gauliga nord into the gauli league .

merkel speaks of power-word : &apos; toll becomes &apos; quite clear &apos; .
now the commission &apos;s chancellor is once again making a clear commitment to this .
a licence for all the complicated details is to make it impossible .
persistent opposition to the eu &apos;s cdu to the pkw toll has led the csu to increasingly demand that the car be replaced .
chancellor angela merkel has , after sustained opposition from the government , withdrawn from her cdu a power word for introducing a car toll .
&quot; to be quite clear , you are in the coalition agreement with the european parliament , and you will come , &quot; said the party leader on monday after meetings of the cdu top bodies in berlin .
you can access a detailed model by merkel , however , for the time being .
in the black and red governance programme , &apos; certain parameters &apos; are mentioned .
the federal minister of state alexander dobrindt ( csu ) made a proposal and the council is now working on it .
the nrw-cdu insists , however , on its rejection of a toll on all roads .
merkel stressed that financial ministers , wolfgang schäuble ( cdu ) , too , are constructive in the discussions on a draft law .
we have also discussed this with dobrindt and other possibilities , more privacy and more transparency in the investment process .
&quot; there is nothing special about it &quot; , schäuble had a &quot; mirror &quot; on sunday .
csu chief horst sehopfer warned darfur to use the internet in the cabinet to counter the federal ministry of finance .
cdu bundesvize armin laschet reaffirmed his objections .
&quot; the coalition agreement was never based on the assumption that all circles and federal roads were built , &quot; said the north rhine westphalian cluster of the cdu .
in this respect , it is an important signal that sea haulage has now announced that it will be able to speak again about the issue .
opposition to the plans is also expressed by the cdu national associations baden württemberg and rheinland-pfalz .
the background to this is fear that a toll will make small border traffic to neighbouring countries more difficult .
seehofer had a very long time to go to the city because of toll criticism from the cdu coalition .
the left sees the plans as being unrealistic in the face of the dispute in the union .
&quot; the murks toll is dead &quot; , said party leader margaret riexinger of the &quot; new osnabrück newspaper &quot; ( monday ) .
&quot; with the toll , the minister fails &quot; dobrindt wants to make a vignette duty on all german roads , which will start in 2016 .
domestic car owners may , according to coalition agreement , not add burdens .
therefore , they should be informed of a full impact on the environment through the motor vehicle tax .
the model may not be used by foreign drivers , however , under eu law , for reasons of nationality .
genetic disorder is often misdiagnosed , but it is not diagnosed properly .
a british man says she thought that as a result of a misdiagnosis for many years she would die .
karin rodger lived almost all her youth in the belief that they were only a few years away from being a child .
she was actually suffering from the charcot-marie-tooth disease ( cmt ) - a group of inherited disorders that could cause nerves outside the brain and spinal cord .
charity cmt uk participates in the report that misdiagnoses are a common problem for people with cmt because there is so little known about this disease .
about 23,000 people in britain are likely to suffer from cmt , which leads to motor disorders such as muscle weakness , unsafe gear , and crumbled toes .
patients suffer from the same type of diarrheal or pain , and the disease is incurable and progressively spreading , which means that symptoms are linked to time worse .
when rodgers 13 was , she believed that she was interested in peaceful ataxial ( fa ) bodies .
rodger thought she would be in the wheelchair before she was 18 , and before her 30 birthday , she would die .
the mother of two children who today lived 51 years old said : &quot; when i was a child i knew that i was not the same thing as the other children .
i constantly fell in love with the camera and everything lasted longer .
i could never agree with the other children roller shoe or skateboard and was often criticised in school for my way of walking and walking .
rodger said that they were born at the age of 13 after several operations to relieve their achilles .
&quot; i felt guilty , because i was curious and i was not able to see the problem .
when i received a reply , i was shocked and dreadfully panic .
i thought that i was playing with 18 in the wheelchair and with 25 dying , and in between i slowly became losing all my skills .
i made all this with me alone and planned to make my own funeral .
she said when she was 17 , her mind became clear that her skills were not as much diminished as she would have imagined and asked her husband .
he was simply up and embraced me and said that &apos; my love , i believe not that i am you .
i think you have a lot less life threatening feeling .
after some genetic tests , she was diagnosed with cmt .
&quot; when he told me what cmt was , he felt like he was a real person who won the contest , &quot; she said .
charity cmt uk has a cmt awareness-month started , to be able to draw attention to this disease .
rocker a . d. berni diether has been working since the former military operation was closed .
for almost ten years , the former military exercises have been held in munich , germany .
nevertheless , every month , death threats are still emerging .
the grenades are sometimes even so dangerous that they are sprayed on the ground .
a ear cover , a buckle , halts with the spinning over the heart of the biosphere reserve .
in december 2004 , the last sharp shoot fell on the troop exercise site munich , which was launched in late 2005 after 110 years of military operation .
since then , the 6500 hectare of the area has been the heart of the biosphere reserve .
tax burden on business people in washington is rising with the economic recovery .
a recovery in the economy means more customers , more sales and new jobs .
it also means higher taxes .
state and local tax information for companies in the country increased by more than eur 1 billion last year , while economic recovery accelerated , so a newly published study in the past week , and firms in the washington area bill .
companies in the district , maryland and virginia have paid 27,6 billion $ to government and local authorities .
the state and local tax burden of companies increased by more than 4,3 % last year to 671 billion dollars , compared with 3.9 % in 2008 .
state taxes increased more than local taxes .
more than half of the country ’ s tax revenues , 56 percent , comes from corporate taxes , while 36 percent of revenues go to maryland .
virginia achieves a lowest tax revenue from companies with 28 % .
much of the increase in the tax revenue is due to a recovery in real estate values of companies , say , researchers .
while much of these profits are made from large states such as california , new york , and texas , the process also seems to be very different for the washington area .
companies in the district , maryland and virginia paid more than $ 10 billion in government and local property taxes last year , compared with $ 9,6 billion in 2012 - a rise in the course of a year of 4.2 % .
but the seeming recovery in real estate values is not the same in maryland as in increasing government and local tax revenues , because the real economy is in a state of decline , with almost one-fifth of the tax advice from companies .
companies in virginia and d.c. pay almost half of their state and local taxes in the form of property taxes .
&quot; in maryland is done the following : a large part of the real estate , especially in the tax area around d.c. , is either owned by the government or by non-profit organizations that do not pay property taxes , &quot; said douglas lindglas lindtaxholm lindholm .
maryland is therefore forced to spend , for example , much more on income taxes to reduce the same services .
the recent recovery in tax revenues from companies cannot be the only reason for the recovery of the housing market .
company revenues seem to be recovering as well , according to the data .
companies in the region reported about income increases in the government agencies , and about $ 2.3 billion in tax revenue in the region .
maryland took 1 billion $ in company income , and the government ’ s highest amount was $ 1.7 billion .
while the trend towards the same direction is continuing , local development of tax is increasing not only in all three places but also in all three places .
the rise in the district grants rate was equivalent to 4,3 percent of the national average , while the increase in maryland was significantly higher than 4,9 percent .
only virginia reported a lower average tax revenue of 4,1 percent .
virginia has a 6 % stake in all three areas of office , which is significantly the lowest in corporate income taxes ( in all three there are fixed corporate tax rates ) .
the corporate tax rate in maryland is 8.25 percent and in the district is relatively low .
a similar study by the us chamber of commerce at the beginning of this year showed that in virginia , lower government and local corporate taxes are required and , overall , a better fiscal climate than in maryland .
the study has shown the district not to be investigated .
despite the advantages , virginia is under pressure from its southern neighbour .
north carolina has laws on reducing its corporate tax rates in this year from 6,9 % to 6 % .
if the state continues to pursue its income targets next year , this law could serve as a barrier to the state ’ s corporate income tax rate of up to 3 % by 2017 .
meanwhile , the us seems to be allowing small businesses in the washington area to do better , and they are therefore paying more government and local taxes , according to the latest study .
corporate taxes , which are regarded as personal income taxes by small businessmen - a transitional structure that allows the economy to be managed by most small businesses - are paid in district , maryland and virginia last year by 20 % .
researchers say that the price trend is not as high as the trend and the rise in corporate taxes throughout the country this year , with a rise in overall majority voting .
nevertheless , washington could leave behind the space that it had been possible to achieve , if the federal government cut its spending on the region ’ s labour market .
partner city : german beer for guangdong beer .
hops and malts - also in china a popular combination .
german beer is a very popular place in china .
frankfurt ’ s partner city in china now wants a brewery and also hopes for an air direct connection between the two cities .
german beer , used in the frankfurts partner town of guangzhou - that is the urgent desire of the official beer in china .
&quot; we would be delighted if a german brewery could join our city .
time and again , the functionalist of the ruling communist party of china came to the house during the course of the discussion on this issue of the twelve-million-metropolis .
guangzhou , which is also a canton in germany , is one of the richest cities in china , called li .
therefore , the people would also have the purchasing power to buy german beer .
the hessian spd chairman thorsten schäfer gümbel , who has been leading the german political delegation , said to the host that he would be in germany after a possible partner for the project .
&quot; for beer it does not take much : good water , grain and joie de vivre , &quot; he added during lunch with the party leader , in guanglo .
this joy of life has already been blowing out mr li , flattering the host .
the commission then came up with a proposal from guangzhou , which was to be welcomed by schäfer gümbel , but with red wine , which was served to the meal .
the chinese brand tsingtao is based on german brewing art .
tsingtao-beer is produced after the german purity law .
more business
a second wish of the chinese hosts would be a direct flight connection between frankfurt and guangzhou , said vice party chief , li .
lufthansa had previously offered the flight , but in 2012 it was not possible to cancel it for economic reasons .
&quot; it would be worth it again , &quot; the municipal politician was convinced .
&quot; business transactions between our two cities are increasing .
at the moment , travellers would have to pay a detour through changsha in the hunan province , li lamented .
the administration of guangdong province , whose capital is guangzhou , is also hoping for the air connection .
the vice-governor of the central government , chen yunxian , was responsible for this request during his conversation with the social democrats .
&quot; this is a very good idea , &quot; he replied , schäfer-gümbel , chinese vice minister li jinjun , an intimate connoisseur of germany , nodded .
a well-maintained partnership
the lieutenant vice-president of the party leader of guangzhou hopes that the country will be able to make frankfurt a partner meeting next year .
li yiwei was already a member of the main team , but not yet in this position .
he came to the european parliament only this year after his predecessor had been charged with corruption from office .
the local party leader , wan qinglian , had to go as well .
the action against the officials from guangzhou is part of a nationwide campaign against corruption in party and administration , which has been launched by leader xi jinping with harsh rigour .
the new leader li yiwei had a very strong political position before his party career for an american company , which was highly unusual in the communist party of china .
before his inauguration in guangzhou , he was a top official in fujian , where the car manufacturer was called vw a big plant .
frankfurt is officially more than a dozen cities partner companies .
the connection to the 9000 km distant guangzhou is one of those that is being maintained by both sides , for example with a student exchange .
last year , the 25-year-old german football association was founded .
the southern chinese metropolis on the pearl river is connected with its economic strength almost as much as it is with hessen .
next year , she wanted to set up a gross domestic product of eur 250 billion , reported a significant increase in li .
the family of joan rivers &quot; expresses the thumbs &quot; &quot; and &quot; the thumbs &quot; .
joan rivers has been a member of the team since she was born in new york city , new york city , three days ago , but her daughter is now hopeful that the 81-year-old comic of her illness is recovering .
&quot; thank you for your continued love and support , &quot; said melissa ricardo .
we are all pushing the thumbs .
her mother was born on thursday after a emergency because of heart failure in a clinic at the uppsala street , in yorkville encopy , on thursday .
the doctors will stop you deliberately and , in close observation , until you are satisfied with your condition .
the reactions were expressed from many quarters , including in the form of an overwhelming online support from donald tump , montel williams and kelly ripa .
environmentally friendly vacuum cleaners and rising wages will help to reduce the cost of waste and to reduce the number of jobs that are lost .
for cars and vacuum cleaners , which are now available in the retail trade , stricter environmental standards will apply in the future .
like cooling cabinets and washing machines , new dust collectors from 1 september are supplied with a label indicating the buyer &apos;s position at a glance , such as the energy efficiency of the unit .
for new cars , the pollutant class &apos; euro 6 &apos; has more stringent nitrogen oxide values .
there are also more money for the scaffolding builders : they receive a minimum wage of 10.25 euros throughout the country .
amazon buys twitch for 1.04 billion $ .
amazon confirmed that the new version of the game was released on monday morning : the online retailer - and video producer , and a lot of other things - bought the video streaming service twitch for 1.04 billion $ ( !
the announcement comes as a surprise , not because nobody wants twitch to be taken over , but because it is widely believed that youtube is a good company to acquire .
three months ago , it looked as if the sale of twitch to the video service of google for a cosmopolitan billionaire decided , and the cooperation seemed to be natural .
twitch , which was only published three years ago as justin.tv , was known as a general streaming service - a live streaming version of youtube .
instead , it quickly became a platform for players to share their flying pieces in games .
the twitch interface .
and &quot; let &apos;s play &quot; , a video game that is used to create better play .
it is just that youtube is a very often called , if you want to watch twitch , so it was not the message that youtube is twitch to buy , something was bored .
it is a mystery why the deal with youtube is so unsuccessful .
everything we do at the moment about this is a statement by emmet slechner , president of twitch : &quot; we have chosen amateur radio to be amazon because it is our community .
another secret is that , frankly , the incredible success of twitch .
for snobs like me who explain that they prefer to do sports than watch , it is hard to see the attraction .
it is one thing to ask a friend at 3 in the morning to take a look at his shoulder while he is walking through resident evil , and something quite different , a spinner watching the way he is 20 times in succession .
all these games could be seen right now .
another problem is that the many of the most popular games today are ego games , so you can &apos;t see them without your own control of the perspective .
i admit that the commission &apos;s rapid progress , in the areas of transport , is not always satisfactory .
but until a game or humour virtual reality is created , the world ’ s twitch channel is probably not as interesting .
but what do skeptics like me know about it ?
twitch is supported by 55 million different visitors per month and is the fourth largest source of internet traffic games in the world .
and how exactly will amazon get money from it ?
it is difficult to imagine that the twitch is as elegant in amazon as it is in the way it is .
but twitch has something that every company would like : thousands of young men who are working as advertisers , and they are not .
as the chairman of twitch , shear , said , amazon and twitch &quot; believe both of the future of the gaming , &quot; and that medium of the show no signs of a shrinking , nor even a change .
on the hüpfburg near the burggarten festival , there was a lot going on saturday .
the concept of the organizers agreed .
despite the strong rain cast on the saturday evening , the rain was estimated to reach 1200 fans .
at times , the admission had to be stopped .
&quot; that was annoying , &quot; said ron sem , one of the organizers .
salzwedel l licht und fun .
two spanish words have become maxim sachraj and ron sem .
the open air in the salzwedeler burggarten is intended to increase brightness in the day and in the evening through various shows .
well , and the fun comes anyway from all. i am not sure if i can get it .
this has already been demonstrated in the early evening when the first visitors were able to take part in the open air .
a festival for all generations had the organizers promised .
and that is what you have succeeded in doing .
around the utilities on the burggartenmeiese , salzwedeler , but also guests from the immediate and further surroundings , were made comfortable .
they pursued the first live performances of the band , wiped with the foot in the cycle , enjoyed the kühle drinks - in short : relaxation pure and enjoyment were desired .
and that is right across the generations .
while some are looking for blankets on the extra carved white sand on the beach bar , some are looking for a place to relax on a quarter of wine in the vinotheque .
but also with children &apos;s tasting , the volunteers had a real chance to get their hands on the ball .
the larger ones used the kicker tables or took part in a skateboard workshop , which the goodfood-crews from salzwedel put out .
until the great rain came .
shortly before 5.30 p.m. , the council pruned to the visitors , especially families sued the wide and dry land .
but the attractiveness of the festival did not break this off .
&quot; more people than expected &quot; , said ron sem , the president of the &quot; success on the whole line &quot; .
i therefore oppose a repeat of the great party next year .
although the content and size of the event are still to be worked on , sem made a first record on sunday in relation to the popular vote .
as an annoying , he said that in the meantime the admission was stopped .
obviously , the security company was not sufficiently busy .
the result : some who have already paid have not been able to access the premises .
the response was very good , and the response was very positive .
in a first careful estimate , the salsa broker co-organizer spoke of about 1200 visitors , who were in burggarten and were in the city .
there were problems with the sound technology .
the salzwedeler hip-hop band blocks`n`rox broke their appearance therefore .
the technicians were unable to find a reasonably reasonable sound , and the sound was not able to be heard .
the planned shisha lounges could not be built , because the tents were not opened due to a tire breakdown .
&quot; next year you will be there &quot; , says the organizer .
the premiere of the amula open air festival was held by the visitors of the event more than successful .
and this in bad weather .
however , the organizers have made some mistakes which were not possible the first time , but in the second time the event was eliminated .
in the social network facebook , the organizers must also make a criticism .
&quot; sorry , but for 12 euros you just have more to expect &quot; , says melanie meier on the event page .
&quot; you have a bit of retention , &quot; says ele zimmermann at the same place .
others see the initial problems not as closely as they were .
i think it is very good that some people are not just stupid talking , but are actually trying to do something .
hats off ! &apos; , stephanie jenß writes to the amula .
now the organizers have a year to review these criticisms .
new radom in berkum : wachtberg &apos;s landmark shrink .
i am sure that is not the case .
rather , the ready component is waiting to be integrated into the distinctive building .
the action is in the context of a larger measure : almost 50 years after the creation of the space observation radar , tira , the shell , called radom , is completely renewed .
the new radom is equipped with a diameter of 47.5 metres .
the size of the camera remains world record .
the last step towards completing the new case is to add the caps to the new envelope .
the upper part of the old hull is separated and covered with a crane .
after that , the last quarter of the new case will be set up .
if the weather is good , the action should start at the beginning of this week .
participants in the ice bug conference will be able to see the new ice-bucket-challenge .
isabelle roberts from the uk shouted so much as her ice-cold water was over her head .
this ice-bucket-challenge went painfully well , and i was very pleased with the result .
a woman was sent to the hospital after she had been taken to the ice-bucket-challenge so much to cry that she had to take up the jaw .
isabelle roberts from the uk wrote such a large article as her ice-cold water was over her head .
&quot; the water was so cold that i wrote a letter , and while i did , i stayed in a pine just like i was , &quot; she said to the mirrors .
ice water is being used over the 20-year-old .
isabelle roberts a few seconds before the accident , he was arrested for his death .
i wanted to close my mouth , but that was not possible , the jaw was hated and then he understood that i was not able to vote .
my mother and my sister saw this as well and made themselves laughed almost in the pants , but i had to take the emergency .
the 20 year-old from britain was sent to the hospital to meet the kiefer after attending the viral trend .
the clip was created to be an internet site and a thousand times on facebook and twitter .
do the burgvereines soon rejoin the same line ?
the last time was when there was a constant clash between the two wolfratshausen burghers .
now the management board is thinking about possible cooperation .
as a model for the reconstruction of the wolfratshausen castle , the late richard dimbat , who was a former chairman of the wolfratshausen burgfreunde , led the project in the french guédelon .
just a year ago , there was no good climate between the burgundy club and wolfratshausen burgfriends .
the situation seemed to be very different so far , as to how the history of wolfratshausen castle and possible reconstruction should be handled .
now the two camps are moving closer together : they are to start talking about a common approach soon .
this is confirmed by the club board of torsten sjöberg ( burgverein ) and herbert piffl ( burgfreunde ) on request of our newspaper .
&quot; i have listened to mr piffl and suggested that we should sit down once , &quot; he says .
in his view , all members of both clubs could in future be in the same position .
this way , visible results can be seen quickly .
while the burgfriends were fighting for the sudden death of richard dimbath until the end for the rebuilding of the castle on the mountain forest , the burgverein is now in charge of the &quot; opening up and experience &quot; .
herbert piffl , second chairman of the burgfreunde , has , according to his own information , been very pleased with the call .
since dimbad ’ s death , he has been standing in front of his friends in the castle .
a new chairman is due to be appointed in a general meeting in mid-september .
at the moment , the association is ranked as some 40 members according to the 74-year-old .
&quot; after the death of my friend richard i had to leave the city , we had the activities of the association out of respect .
according to piffl , the new chairman is then to be invited to talk to the burgverein .
until then , the burgfriends could also take a current mood within their group .
a candidate for the presidency is not yet available , says piffl .
&quot; but i am confident that the next step will be found &quot; , he will not want to stand for himself because he has his residence in bad tölz .
the new president should be a wolfratshauser .
the tölzer wool was produced in the project &quot; but very much like to continue working &quot; .
the different positions on reconstruction will be taken into account in piffl &apos;s eyes in the near future .
he praises dimbath as a &quot; missionary &quot; who always believes in rebuilding the castle .
two similar , already advanced , and more advanced projects in austria and france would show that this idea is not a chimney .
the high level of public participation and voluntary help will make it possible to make a tourist offer .
piffl : &quot; i too was skeptical at the beginning .
but over time i have been more and more convinced that the european union is making sense to do away with the project . &apos; it could be a &apos; one-stop shop &apos; for the fled industry .
there are no other things to do here .
moreover , the project would be supported by eu subsidies , visitor tickets and potential sponsors .
&quot; the idea of rebuilding is something i personally do not want to throw away just because of this , &quot; he hopes that the burgverein may be moving somewhat on this point .
the aim of this , initially documenting history , is &quot; important and good &quot; .
then we could look on .
clever ways to save on uni-textbooks are now available .
as the cost of university textbooks is higher for many students than $ 1,000 a year , the university of applied sciences considered the issue of the fast-second semester matt schroeder to be a clever sparide .
he invented a rental system for books of students of higher semester and bored a notable opportunity to receive a reward for the resale .
&quot; my mathematics book usually costs 180 $ , but i got it for 10 $ for a second .
the time allotted for the last semester would have been $ 430 , he said .
he gave $ 120 .
the colleges were told that the law of the federal republic of germany had , on average , more than $ 1,200 per year for textbooks and study material , but that there were different cost reduction options for students .
online stores and creative approaches are the key to success , such as the schroeders .
renting teachers is a matter of course , and so we can offer students a book for a semester long , often at a much cheaper price than the purchase .
neebo inc , which has more than 250 university bookshops , is the leading provider of online banking services in the united states .
surveys in the industry show that about a quarter of the books in the college bookshops are in the public domain last spring .
less than half of all textbooks are published by the national association of teachers , according to the commercial association of college stores in campus bookshops .
here is the one-off for the best deals .
online purchase online , buy online , buy online , buy online , buy online , buy online , buy online , buy online , buy online .
some new books cost only one-third of the price online , for which you can buy in the campus bookshop .
the ninth edition of &quot; calculus &quot; vno ron larwon , bruce edwards and robert hotetler costs almost 290 $ , but can be ordered from the specialized textbook retailer chegg.com .
used buy
if you have the notes of other or normal users , you can use them for free .
&quot; calculus &quot; is used to calculate the price of the ticket for the trip .
matt casday , 25 , final student at the university of brigham young , usa .
the book was newly published for $ 48 .
academics like ingrid bracey , head of the university of massachusetts , at the amherst college of without walls , recommended that students be supported by their professors .
sometimes the updates are not available for the seminar .
in such cases , older issues can often be refunded for a fraction of the cost of the newest edition .
apart from chegg and amazon , half.com is also available from ebay inc .
rent a car , rent a car , or rent a car in the costa de la luz .
renting teachers is a very difficult task .
you can order more than 80 percent of the costs of a newly purchased book .
a student could , for example , use &quot; calculus &quot; for a semester to write about $ 20 .
find out about the terms of business at the company you are renting , also about the penalty fees that may apply to writing business notes .
tenants be careful : if you do not return the book , the penalty fees may be the price of a new book even exceeded .
e-books
e-books instead of traditional books of textbooks are also an option .
sometimes these books are actually printed , but the book is also used for a specific period of time by wholesalers such as amazon.com , chegg and barnes &amp; noble inc. . .
at chegg you can buy &quot; calculus &quot; for 6 months for about 61 $ .
bracey says that students in literary courses often have the best offers , as many classics are free to download nowadays .
to be sure ,
joe gault , 29 , who will soon be the pepper ’ s law school , will be the first to recommend the isbn number for the awarding of books .
and before you place an online order , you should check , so gault , if the book is actually in stock .
this lesson was learned at the harsh tour .
he bought a book that was four weeks delivery time and paid for the rest of the price in the college book shop .
why &quot; guardian of the galaxy &quot; ? no kasser ?
&quot; the expandables 3 &quot; by sylvester stallone played less than 30 million dollars of his 90 million dollars budget in the us .
the camera &apos;s slide show is a true highlight for the photographer .
an article by the telegraph-filmcritic robbie collin suggests that in the children &apos;s films the lack of quality in the films is itself the reason .
collin described 2014 as &quot; the worst year &quot; so far for children &apos;s films , and described &quot; dragonflight hubs made easy 2 &quot; as purely &quot; functional &quot; fantasy continuation .
in films for a slightly older target group , it seems that the film is not always of a high quality .
in july , entertainment compared wee &apos;s &quot; the average &quot; cinematic &quot; to &quot; the meta-critic &quot; rating for each summer movie start , which was between the american memorial day and the 20th of july 2013 and the current year .
the results are based on the opinion of the cinema visitors and film critics and indicate that the film is not yet available in the first place .
some commentators believe that the development is moving towards changing visual habits and the growing popularity of web streaming media .
director jon favreau , who is currently working on disney &apos;s soon released jungle book film , is saying to the website hollywood .
we must accept that and not try to follow the past .
unlike the current weak economies of the cash markets of the hollywood productions , net flix recently achieved a significant increase in sales with the streaming media .
last summer , the director criticized steven spielberg for his film studios that they were too much focused on film productions of comics .
in the light of the current downturn , the commission has been arguing that its dire economic prophecies are a real core .
the summer of 2015 saw the potential for a possible cash battle , including azerbaijan ’ s avenger age of ultron , minions , and jurassic world , but other film industry representatives are more optimistic :
the producer of x-men , simon kinberg , described the decline in cashier results recently as simply &quot; cyclical &quot; and said to hollywood recycling that the market is not going to be the biggest summer .
when the european union &apos;s 2nd table tennis district was opened a few years ago , the commission was able to introduce a more streamlined version of the league .
now the german table tennis league has a further 3rd bundesliga in the program .
the result : if you have not climbed , you have gone down .
for example , göttingen &apos;s highest class team torpedo has won the top ranking in the oberliga release , but plays in the coming season only a fifth place .
fourth classification : torpedos ladies , despite their grandiose sceneries in the regional league .
the boys and girls of torpedo start in the lower saxony league , as well as the boys of the sc weende .
the sg lenglers and the torpedo reserves are not in the new verbandsliga .
the women &apos;s figure is the tv geismar in the association league , the torpedo league second in the national league .
what is different from the composition is a better district class , is now the new district ’ s district elite .
tsv seulinen , vfb leudingsen , torpedo iii , geismar , einbeck , hamenstedt , bovender sv , langenholtensen , der fc .
the district court of berlin has a number of important roles as regional representatives of the dransfeld and the sc weende , in the district class of the ttc ii , rot-weiss , bovender sv ii and the teams of the tt ii .
güntersen , the ttc and the ttv geismar ii are here with the dj .
the district court of berlin is home to a number of events , such as torpedo iii and sattenhausen / wöllmarshausen .
the team is divided into nine teams , each with nine teams .
the sc weende sends its girls to the small district sliga .
the district court of berlin is also the largest city in germany .
in a district class , hostages go to geismar , tuspo weende and the bovender sv .
in the first season of the newly established regional association , the first international competitions start in the two göttingen with nine teams each .
in the west season , the team &apos;s red and white ii , bovender sv iii , laubach ii , torpedo iv and the v , mtv grone , dransfelder sc ii , mielenia .
in the east season , the team also played sattenhausen / wöllmarshausen , nikolausberg and landolfshausen .
the women &apos;s kreisliga consists of a saddenhausen / wöllmarshausen ii , bilshausen , hemeln , silingen ii , tuspo weende and sg rhume .
that is still better than in the osterode district where it is on kreisenbene no more ladies teams .
what is striking is that none of the six 2 circle classes should be reached , here the innovative and revolving power cycle will be changed .

schrammel dreamtor brings rapid to the siegerstraße rapid with the second season victory the right response to the disappointment against helsinki .
&quot; we wanted a positive response , &quot; said foreign defender thomas schrammel , who was very successful with his splendid lead volley of the sixteenth century at the 14th minute .
&quot; i thought i could do a lot of frustration with the thursday and i was very pleased with the result .

barisic was even in the position that &quot; in many games before , you are better than today &quot; - against &quot; the strongest team , which is this season in this stadium .
the first three-point operator since 26 july has therefore shown that the team team &apos;s structure is consistent with the setbacks , despite intact : &quot; today the commission team has shown that it is in nature &quot; .
for him , the commission is also pleased that we have finally reached zero .

&quot; we must not forget this , &quot; he warned barisic , who in recent three days has been working with great care and pavilion players .
the country games are scheduled to take place in the near future .
one to which the break is probably particularly close is captains , who is the owner .
he is breaking the rules for the team , going beyond pain and then going to the ground .
it is precisely at this difficult stage that he has shown that he is a very important player for us , &quot; said constated barisic .
hofmann gave the game rapids before his exchangeover in the 68th minute not only the structure but also achieved the second goal .
for the 33-year-old who had his 350th bundesliga game , he was the first staffer from the game since 2 november 2013 ( 4 : 2 about the admira ) .
hofmann : &quot; may not believe that now everything is good &quot; &quot; we have certainly also a bit of luck , but sometime the game must also be lucky to come back to us .
now it is high time &quot; , said hofmann .
he warned , however , that concentrated progress would be made : &apos; we must not always be black and white .
we have seen in recent weeks not as bad as the one presented was .
we must not , however , believe that everything is now good .
the importance of its role for the team was not disputed .
it is a very young team , who i have been following very closely at the moment .
they are in some stages , however , as i have said , &quot; said hofmann .
val gardena coach michael baur had joined the team and had little to reproach for .
he regretted the rapid opposite response &apos; from the sorcerer &apos; category , as well as the regular gate from nutz in the 40th minute which was taken by referee kollegger to wrongly be .
the only criticism i have of the team is that it is not the only way to get the goal right in some phases .
we have too little qualifications for this .
internal defenders maximilian karner saw it similar : &quot; it has started badly , then we have purely found and even a gate made .
by and large , more would have been in it .
under this sin , there is ruin , and there is ruin .
a powerful tribe showed us in our wheels of mystery , the summer series &quot; my piece of the rhöner luck &quot; last friday .
several of these tree giants are still in the district , the illustrated example of the city of hosni mubarak is located above the lower belt fountain .
a hollow footpath leads up to the approximately 600 years old iron oak .
it goes past the couplings , basalt rock heaps and basalt rock meadows .
a little below the stone fraction of the building &apos;s mountain , a kilometre north of the road to weisbach , it stands .
vital is the natural monument that is ravaged over the other trees of the area and reminds us of the world ’ s largest tree with a volume of more than eight metres .
a small buddha on a tree stump indicates that the buddha is a spiritual buddha .
but , despite intensive research , there were only indications of the name of the person .
dr. wolfgang schneider has specifically written the bishop ’ s heimer ’ s archive and has invited older people from the underground fountain to learn what the relationship with the spiritual community is .
the result of his research was the right useless disposition for the name .
so , until about 80 years ago , the goat herdsmen were to leave their animals from underweißenbrunn to the laboriously rolled and freed from rocks .
at the foot of the tree , the trees that rise are to be found in the animal huts .
meanwhile , the sector has regained its importance , because the pastures are actually once again being planted on the meadows .
the area is also the core zone of the biosphere reserve .
when entering the stone collection , the first thing to do is to be careful , because the stone that is warmed up by the sun is also suitable for cruisers .
a hiking trail leads from underweißenbrunn to the tree , which is hidden but somewhat hidden .
other ways are signposted , the direction of high rhön up and the path to a vast desert hike .
where is the water castle ?
a watercastle , which will be built at our next task , is , however , rather rare in height .
the mirror in the moat already gives a good impression of the building , but we have some historical buildings in the county , including the building counter-strike .
where is our &quot; piece of the rhöner luck &quot; ?

after weeks of tug-of-war , italy ’ s premier and president-in-office of the eu president , matteo renzi , has resisted strong conservative resistance at the eu ’ s special summit last week to nominate his foreign minister , federica mogógán .
renzi considers how the government relations of the newspaper la repubblica reproduces the calmness of his also in the government team as favorites .
he also expects a boost for his &quot; reforming parliament &quot; .
last but not least , renzi hopes that the recurring anti-him forces will also be able to win the battle .
the conservatives with president jean-claude trichet and the president of the council , who was nominated as president of the council , will , it is said , be the dominant opinion in rome to achieve political balance .
the chefs of the united states are also going to be deputy for the commission president , mr juncker .
the outstanding agreement of the european parliament is considered to be certain .
otherwise , president giorgio napolitano would have been appointed president of the 41th anniversary of the ruling party ’ s appointment as a politician .
la repubblica is spreading optimism that the economic reforms that have been taking place in leading party positions for almost two decades have been proven and recognised for their ambition .

since 2008 she has been a member of the chamber of deputies in which she has been an expert in defence and european and international affairs .
as renzi in february 2014 premier was elected , he ordered the government to withdraw the government from the constitution .
if the pd is to have a better relationship with the strong peace movement in the country today , which is one of the party ’ s 40 % votes in the may eu elections , then i believe that , as in pd circles , there is a lot to be .
i agree with the accusations in brussels , which have led to too little diplomatic experience in the new eu external delegates , and which are not being given substance in the pd .
in brussels , particularly the poles and the baltic members , abuses are being carried out in a way that is realistic and which is not in keeping with the ukraine crisis .
it advocates the use of the energy technology used by the russian company gazprom , which is the russian gas pipeline , bypassing ukraine directly to south europe , and which is being transported by russia .
after renzi had finished his term as eu president in july , he was in moscow .

mr valls called for the deep-divided left to be allowed to &quot; rekindle their love &quot; for the controversial socialist president .

the standing committee of the national people &apos;s congress adopted a framework law on sunday which only covers two or three candidates for the election in hong kong .

putin requires kiev to accept democracy and human rights as a means of building a new relationship with the east ukraine .
russian president vladimir putin promised to resume the press release on sunday , when russia ’ s government was demanding the fights against the separatists in eastern russia .
his spokesman dimitri peskov later made it clear that putin was not meant to be a “ boom ” under the control of the separatist region of eastern ukraine .
putin ’ s appeal to the kiev government to negotiate on an equal footing with pro-russian insurgents , however , fits in with the policy he has pursued since the riots began five months ago : help for the people .
in an interview with the state television channel channel channel eins , putin condemned the ukrainian military campaign for the reconquest of the separatists &apos; territories in the eastern partnership .
the kremlin and the separatists have recently seen the loss of the area they have taken as &quot; novorossija &quot; or &quot; neurussia &quot; , a term that is reminiscent of the pre-revolutionary period of russian imperialism .
putin has pointed out that the country ’ s leaders are all those who , in the course of ukrainian politicians ’ campaigns for the elections on 26 october , and , while government groups are supporting civil communities in the camps held by separatists , they are hoping .
&quot; we must immediately hold extensive talks , not only on technical issues , but also on political organisation of society and the state status of the south-eastern ukraine , in order to safeguard the interests of the people living there , &quot; he said .
peskov said that putin ’ s failed reference to the state of iraq in the context of greater autonomy is not a good idea .
only the ukrainian government can help the eastern areas with the necessary autonomy , he said peskov .
this is not about negotiations between ukraine and russia , but about peskov , &quot; because it is not about a conflict between russia and ukraine .
clarification of the kremlin spokesman on correcting the &quot; misinterpretation &quot; of putin &apos;s regime &apos;s remarks underlined the leadership of russia in dealing with the separatist repression .
moscow should have had far greater difficulties in getting the regions of donetsk and luhansk to join the eastern partnership .
the autonomy that the russian diplomats have at international forums is a matter of urgency to regional governments in ukraine .
the european union &apos;s strategy , which was annexed five months ago in the black sea , is the home port for the majority of russian navy and an important trading port and historic coastal region .
the regions between rostov and russia are also very important for the region .
the ukrainian president , petro poroshenko , suggested in his speech on the inauguration of 7 june that ukrainian legislation - after new elections - should contain amendments to the constitution that would make the relevant areas more transparent .
but his idea of autonomy seems to be in sharp contrast to that of the kremlin and the separatist rebels whose occupation is still under way .
putin ’ s last call to kiev to negotiate with the separatist leaders on an equal footing is followed by a visit by the us president after another incursion into the country last week .
the russian-backed separatists took over the hand-held , which , fearing ukrainian security officials , was the first step in a campaign to take over the strategic coastal region to crimea , to control novoasov .
for this reason , massive civilian and military preparations are under way , with the aim of helping mariupol , a steel industry industry and a 500,000 inhabitants to survive .
poroshenko spoke to a meeting of eu leaders in brussels on saturday and urged action to stop a further russian aggression .
&quot; we are on the verge of a point where there is no longer any back , &quot; warned poroshenko .
thousands of foreign troops and hundreds of foreign tanks are now on the territory of the ukraine .
the eu summit decided not to take concrete action to make the leadership demand the drafting of further sanctions against russia , which would be necessary if an escalation of ukrainian crisis was unspecified .
ukrainian soldiers had to be guided by their positions in ilowajsk after two russian tanks had been attacked and 1,000 soldiers were killed in the danube delta last week .
the first probably 63 ukrainian soldiers who were killed by the russian invasion of ilowajsk were sent to the russian army on sunday against 10 russian parachute hunters .
nude photo canals around australian promis and gabi green .
geoffrey finest made no hurry .
the film city is exciting and the film is being produced after a series of unique photographs of a naked jennifer lawrence in a hackingskandal around celebris on the internet .
the person responsible for this is probably using 60 nudist photos of lawrence , star of &quot; the tricks of panem &quot; and of superstars .
the australian actresa palmer , emily brown and the yvonne strahovski actresses from melbourne were said to have also taken private photos due to an icloud gap publication .
on the list are 101 celebrities .
the finest of the noble grecko , who loves to be with grecko last month , said to confidence : &quot; it is disgusting . &quot;
all private letters and pictures should be private .
it is a shame that private information is stolen and passed on to others .
grecko , currently in new york , said that one after-news website , that the hack &quot; shameful &quot; was and that the people affected &quot; injured &quot; felt .
the hacker probably has 30 images of palmer with her ex-friend scott speedman , including two recordings where you can see up without in a pool .
the film works of palmers include &quot; love is undefeated &quot; with liam hemsworth .
palmer , chuck-star strahovski and the actress brown from sucker punch were standing for comments yesterday on the hacked images .
a representative of lawrence said to thyssenkrupp : &quot; it is a heinous violation of privacy . &quot;
actor seth rogen condemned the attack on the hacker in his tweet : &quot; hacked images from a mobile phone to post is nothing different than the sale of hacker goods . &quot;
from a purely legal point of view , the proliferation of stolen images should not be tolerated .
cyclists , joggers and hikers were present at the 8th bicycle race on the großen feldberg yesterday and have thus established the association &quot; help for cancer patients &quot; .
the tour , which is for one tortur , was a great experience for the other .
in one , however , everyone agreed that it was fun .
thomas studanski is expected to have been well beaten last night .
for the first time in his life , the head of the upper house of the brewery was taken by a bike to the feldberg yesterday .
for the good purpose .
the little muscle butter he can easily be stuck away , especially as he is not allowed to participate in the 8th cycling tour on the great feldberg in favour of the association &quot; help for cancer children &quot; ( frankfurt ) .
a great thing .
&quot; i now know that i can do this - fine ! &quot;
the hotel is very clean and the staff is very friendly .
nee , if i had stopped to think about it , i would have ...
as thomas studanski , who is responsible for the cdu in the upper urban parliament , quelles in the city ’ s 718 participants , who were in the spring , torn up yesterday , and came close to exhaustion , but happily .
others , by contrast , found it easier to cross the well-eleven kilometres long stretch between hohemark and feldberg .
norman dießner , for example .
the nearby red square is a great place for green politicians to be elected by the european parliament .
he , too , is the track in a slide , as well as nina kuhn , press spokesperson of the city of oberursel , who was working with frank grüneisen to get on the way .
for the two triathletes , the &quot; feldberg bike &quot; was not necessarily a sporting challenge : &quot; here &apos;s the way to charity , because there we are happy to be with you - an exit we already have in our hands &quot; .
on the way , they had been appointed paul wenzel from oberreifenberg .
the boy ( 12 ) was in the morning after oberursel to get to it again .
the frankfurt florian zierz had a great time at 9 a.m. at home in the saddle .
the &quot; fred &quot; team was also fun .
for the head of the upper urse-kultkiosks , cycling tours through the feldberg are simply part of the story .
he had a good time with his 6.5-kilo race bike for 40 minutes .
a crazy event .
for this purpose - and i am happy to be there - andreas balzke said .
the durchtrained mainzer says of itself that the new version of the new version of the track is an &quot; ambitious racing cyclist &quot; .
he must do so , because he was not satisfied with the &apos; fixie-wheel &apos; he was on , but these are also racing bikes , but without a circuit ...
the fact that it is easy to move up the top without a wheel is proven not only by the 20 hikers who cross the white wall and the fuchstanz to the summit , but also by a jogger who is on a cord .
mountain guard doctor professor of volker lischke , who has been working with his team , equipped with allwhead bully and quad , for safety .
the 718 participants - and so many as never before - were in the morning in groups on the track .
the first of these hikers is at 9.30 a.m.
the first steps of the cyclists and runners followed at 10 a.m.
five minutes later , the first mountain bikers set off .
bent hansen , chairman of the association &quot; cycling on the big feldberg &quot; , gave the start commands and wanted the participants a nice day out .
for next year , he hopes that it will be possible to complete the route to the feldberg to the safety of the participants .
