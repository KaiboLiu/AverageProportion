remembering the very american ideal of labour rights as human rights
congress mep keith ellison and john lewis have put forward a legislative proposal to make trade unions more civil rights .
&quot; just as unions die , so do middle class jobs , &quot; said ellison , a democrat from minnesota and steward josé martín .
i am therefore proud to present , together with the citizens &apos; rights sikone john lewis , the staff authorisation act .
this groundbreaking law gives workers the same legal opportunities in the event of discrimination on the grounds of the organisation of trade unions as in other forms of discrimination - and thus stops anti-trade union forces .
the addition of the national labour law law to provide a possibility of discrimination against workers employed to organise a trade union representation to protect themselves against discrimination in a civil court - and to seek compensation for damages or penalties .
but it is certainly not a radical initiative - at least not according to american standards .
indeed , the best way to understand what ellison , lewis , and the other sponsors of their legislative proposal , is to reconnect to a very american idea .
despite the setbacks that the unions have suffered in recent years - in wisconsin , michigan and other states throughout the country - americans once welcomed countries around the world .
there was a time when millions of americans remember when this country was building democracy , freedom of speech , freedom of the press and the right to association in one breath .
when the united states occupied japan after world war ii , general douglas mac arthur and his staff encouraged the country to adopt a constitution that would ensure that the country ’ s militarized autocracy hedki was free .
fully aware that workers and their trade unions are playing a key role in creating a new japan , they used a language that explicitly states that the world is &quot; the rights of workers on unification and common merger and action .
when the united states occupied germany after world war ii , general dwight david eisenhower and his staff urged the germans to write a constitution that would ensure that fascism was hitolf hits .
recognising that workers would have to organise themselves and their voice in the new nation , i added the german government clause to the effect that the workers should speak explicitly .
agreements that restrict or aim to restrict this right are not acceptable .
when the former first lady eleanor roosevelt was in the chair of the international commission on human rights , which adopted the universal declaration of human rights , as it was adopted by the united nations in 1948 as a global agreement .
for generations , americans have accepted the basic premise that labour rights are human rights .
when this country told other countries how to use civil and democratic societies , the americans declared that the right to freedom of establishment was not a right - and that these unions were then bound by collective bargaining as equals .
after these rights were under attack in america , it is indeed very wise to rethink the american ideal , which is that working people should have the right to move .
as pastor martin luther king jr. said fifty years ago :
history is a great teacher .
now everyone knows that the workers &apos; movement cannot restrict the strength of the nation , but increased it .
by raising the standard of living of millions of people , work has miraculously created a market for industry and has brought the entire nation to unimaginable levels of production .
those who attack the work forget these simple truths , but history preserves them .
history remembers , and we should do so .
formal recognition of labour rights as human rights - and the extension of the protection of citizens &apos; rights as a protection against discrimination in the creation of employee representatives - is long overdue .
keith ellison and john lewis renew the ideals that america has made great in the past and that have redeemed the promise of democracy .
judges temporarily stops law that all abortion clinics in louisiana are forced to close .
a us federal judge stopped the implementation of a law in louisiana on sunday , which lawyers have said is not likely to close down all five accounts .
this measure , which was taken by bobby jindal , governor of louisiana , in june , and which was launched on 1 september , would be used by doctors who are taking abortions .
the judge &apos;s decision , however , means that doctors are still legally required to carry out abortions for the time being while they are applying for such a right .
&quot; the plaintiffs may continue to work according to the law while they seek to obtain these rights , &quot; wrote bundesrichter john degravelles in his judgment .
a hearing will be held within a month for the judge to establish a lasting legal decision .
pro-abortion supporters welcomed the decision to include the most recent in a series of judgments against similar measures , saying that doctors had given more time to resume hospital admissions .
&quot; today &apos;s decision means that women in louisiana are subjected to a vile law that deprives them of their health and rights , &quot; said nancy northup , president and chair of the centre for reproductive rights ,
it was not immediately clear whether the judgment would also apply to doctors from the two clinics who had been involved in the lawsuit and were also able to give permission .
louisiana is one of 11 states that have enacted similar laws , with the courts recently adopting such measures in alabama and mississippi as unconstitutional .
key points of a law in texas that covers most of the clinics left in the state to close were taken up by a federal judge on friday .
advocates of abortion and the american college of ostretricians and gynecologists , as well as the american medical association , agree that enquiries should be granted by doctors without any unnecessary restrictions .
opponents of abortion argue that measures are contrary to the protection of women &apos;s health , although some also have the effect of closing down clinics .
only a doctor who is aborting in louisiana has patients &apos; inimitable rights , partial or complete treatment .
if all other doctors in the state are forced to stop abortion , that doctor would be forced to take surgery for fear of his safety , the group said .
in arguing against the verdict , representatives of the state of louisiana said that they would not be penalising doctors for carrying out abortions while their applications for patients &apos; induction rights were still pending .
delayed diagnosis and lack of access to the best treatment options lead to higher death rates from ovarian cancer in rural areas .
angelina jolie and her brother james have a video homage for her mother online , which was sent to eierstocking cancer in 2007 .
for women in australia &apos;s rural areas , there is a greater risk of dying of ovarian cancer than for women in cities .
researchers analyzed the medical data of more than 1100 australians , in which in 2005 egg growth cancer was detected , and found that only 25 percent were diagnosed at the time of diagnosis .
the research director susan jordan of qimr berghofer medical research institute said that for those who live in rural and remote regions of the state , the sterilization process is risky .
small study : new drugs could cause lung and egg stock cancer to slow down .
researchers investigated women ’ s health care for seven years .
dr. jordan said that the age of a woman in diagnosis , the type of egg stock cancer , existing pre-diseases as well as social and economic status also increase the chances of survival .
for older women and those whose cancer is already on the way to diagnosis , the disease was in the worst condition for survival .
for those who live in rural and remote regions of the state , mortality rates were lower than in the study .
although the study did not examine why women living outside the city are more likely to suffer from ovarian cancer , it is estimated that dr. jordan has been diagnosed late and has not been given access to the best treatment centres .
&quot; this disease is best treated by gynaecologists , and these are usually found in larger cities , &quot; she said .
despite the improvement of the medical services in order to counter distances , it proposed as a possible remedy a strengthening of the service of incoming doctors to provide specialists with the opportunity to digitize women to their place of residence .
dr. jordan said that the study , regardless of geographical status , has a poor long-term survival rate for women in ovarian cancer and underlined the need for better treatment and treatment .
the rio tinto ride to conquer cancer funding is now being published in the medical journal of australia .
in march 2013 , elisha neave , a young mother of 33 years of gold coast , learned that she had an aggressive form of ovarian cancer .
garden centers regret declining house owners , with the number of homes declining ,
the decline , together with a growing decline in the number of homeowners under 35 years of age , could result in tens of thousands of pounds being lost each year if today &apos;s young consumers are forced to pay for their services following a hta study , as reported in the financial journal .
the report states that , on average , tenants spend 55 % of the amount that people with their own homes spend on their garden .
the increase in people living in highly urbanized areas without gardens , the popular procedure , front gardens to park purposes for aspthalate and the declining garden size are further factors that are driving the industry .
in the london metropolitan area , where the share of homeowners in london rose from 61 to 43 % over a period of 6 years , the lowest spending on garden products per household is reported .
the hta and royal horticultural society point out that the living to rent is a small garden or a house that does not mean that people can not move plants .
guy barter , chief gardener for the rrus said : &quot; container gardeners are very popular with tenants , for example , because they can take their plants with them in a move &quot; .
the hta report identified the period between 1997 and 2005 as the &apos; golden age &apos; of the retail garden as a result of rising home ownership and economic prosperity from the late 1980 ’ s to the mid-1990 ’ s .
he predicted that a further increase in the market situation this year would be due to the better weather conditions in march and april last year .
the political will , which was expressed by the opposition politician imran khan and the clerical tahirul qadri , is continuing .
in the capital islamabad , about 1000 demonstrators have been watching ptv , the state television station .
information minister pervaiz rashid said that soldiers had sent the protesters back out of ptv buildings .
the transmitter set up its operation for about 40 minutes , but is now sending back .
at the same time , around 3000 demonstrators tried to return to prime minister nawaz sharif ’ s residence .
about a kilometre away , they supplied themselves with poles and stones clashes with security forces .
the police intervened in tear gas .
the demonstrators called for sharif ’ s resignation , but he refuses to do so .
the country ’ s army is urging a political solution to the conflict , &apos; without wasting time and using force &apos; .
after a meeting at the headquarters on sunday evening , the military announced : &quot; the army remains committed to its role in ensuring the security of the state &quot; .
the military plays an important role in pakistan and has already repeatedly put on the spot .
opposition politician imran khan accuses premier sharif of not having the right to vote in the parliamentary election last may .
the protests were escalated at the weekend after khan and qadri called their supporters to sharifs residence .
three people were killed .
turkey orders us diplomats for spy reports .
the turkish foreign ministry has sent the most senior us diplomat to the country to report a report on american and british espionage in turkey .
vice-president bülent said that the us embassy ’ s business and turkish officials discussed the report on monday .
the german magazine der spiegel as well as the online magazine the intercept reported that the results of the previous us analyst of the national security agency , edward snowden , show that turkey is a major activity area for turkey .
according to turkish news agencies , the turkish president , recep tayyip erdogan , played the importance of the report , saying that all the major countries must mutually play .
an earlier report that the most important intelligence service in germany also targeted ankara caused much confusion .
warning strike : train drivers are threatening to have consequences for commuters .
the national warning strike by train drivers on monday evening could also affect passenger transport in nrw .
the plan announced for 6 p.m. to 9 p.m. covers all transport companies throughout germany , including the long-distance , regional and s-bahn transport , as well as the rail and rail transport network .
the main thrust of the warning strike is freight transport .

did the district leader of the german locomotive trade union ( gdl ) , sven schmitte , say in düsseldorf .
we expect significant failures .
there are no regional priorities .
the main thrust of the warning strike is freight transport .
the deutsche bahn in nrw announced that it would do everything possible to minimize the impact .
however , the gdl did not say where it wanted to strike , so it is difficult to predict the consequences in concrete terms .
police chief of magaluf accused of corruption
the prosecutors sent a letter to the office of the public prosecutor of mallorca on friday for blackmail by police officers and employees of the city of calvià .
the head of the police of calvià on the island of mallorca was arrested after accusations of corruption by businessmen and cash owners in the notorious binge-drinking hotspot magaluf .
prime minister josé antonio navarro was arrested after accusations of corruption against him by several businessmen from punta ballena , the street where most bars and nightclubs of magaluf are located .
according to the online daily mallorca diario , the prosecutors handed over to the office of the prosecutor for the fight against corruption in mallorca on friday evidence of blackmail by police officers and employees of the city of calvià .
two other local police officers were arrested by the spanish civil guard in connection with the corrupt orders of the city .
the national spanish daily abc reported that the angry nightclub owners are saying that they had been vettering .
&quot; it is no longer about making money , it is about survival , &quot; said one of the businessmen to the court .
let our livelihood be put out of the game .
we have nothing to lose .
magaluf made a mistake this summer because of a viral youtube video , in which a 18-year-old british tourist from the uk was shown to be working on 24 men during a shooting .
since then , the island authorities have tried to prevent the illegal behaviour of alcoholic holidaymakers in magaluf by preventing the number of participants in the notorious alcohol drink .
the playhouse club , where fellatio happened , was designed for one year to close , while playhouse and the kneipp towers were forced to close for a year .
the tourist resort of magaluf , which is popular with young british tourists , is also popular for many accidents involving alcohol .
the first day of spring with wet and stormy weather conditions affects flights from adelaide airport .
spring has a winter season in southern italy .
in the evening until 9 p.m. , another 5mm rain fell on the city , after 6.6mm , which was already falling down on sunday at night .
the last precipitation was the result of a series of short , stormy showers , including a cast that began just before 8 p.m. and was buried in about 10 minutes for almost 4mm precipitation .
after winter last week for an early dose of spring had taken place , the temperatures in the city fell on monday again to a maximum of only 15.8 ° c .
the bad weather conditions have probably led to the late landing of a flight from virgin airlines from melbourne to adelaide .
the aircraft could have landed shortly after 19.30 , but was hit by a winds - a sudden change in wind speed or direction over a short distance - and had to start through .
wind shoots reached about 50 km / h on the ground at adelaide airport at this time .
the flight data showed that the aircraft could also be carried out on a second landing , and finally it was stopped at around 8.40 p.m.
the flight delay subsequently led to the delay of some other flights , including an emirates flight from dubai and a quantas flight from sydney .
for adelaide , a maximum temperature of 16 ° c is predicted on tuesday , with possible showers .
matthies says : it is high time to link up a lot of time to the network .
given the galloping technical progress that has made our cosy home in high-tech environments , we are now in a position to make the world a more consoling space for our columnist bernd matthies .
as i write this here , my view of the spiral cable that drives the listener to the phone is striking , and i think : boah , like retro is that ?
but there is a thought behind this : if the cable was not , all hearing aids would be wiped out in the house in the shortest time , and that would be significantly more retro .
in any case , the eclectic ( eclectronic ?
no , typos : electronic ) sector the rule that today &apos;s world novelty is the electric scrap of tomorrow , bought - outdated .
and if you are looking for a tv in your living room today , for example , you simply say that you are fundamentally opposed to television .
why do these considerations ?
because we are not aware of the ifa &apos;s crackdown on the radio tower this week again , our absolute incompetence in electronic matters .
the layman , who used to be blind maschine and cd player , does not even understand the purpose of the devices that are equipped with inconceivable expert spreads before him .
yes , is it still possible ?
what is it about talking to people who seem to be voluntarily spreading such quark ?
after all , for about 20 years now , the main thing is that we are pleased to connect our house .
to make the yoghurt look after itself , so that the fire detector can help us during the holiday in the maldives , that it is burning in the working room degrees .
and would it not be wonderful if we could have air conditioning from our office to arrive in the near future ... ?
yes , however , this requires air conditioning .
but a dream will certainly come true soon : we raise our watch , say your loud &quot; suck ! &quot; - and at home the dust vacuum robot goes off .
wrong .
everything is in no way a revolution : &apos; the boundaries between white and brown goods are blurring &apos; , raunt a sector-conscious , you can cut the washing machine with a headphone , which is connected to the camera .
we also know from everyday practice that if a new device is really needed urgently , it is guaranteed that the battery will be empty .
another reason is that the spiral cable is also connected to the next radio exhibitions .
israeli children return to gaza after the war .
thousands of israeli children from the areas near gaza strip are returning to israel on monday .
the school launch brought the country affected by rocket launching holes in southern israel a sense of joy and expectation , but the signs of fighting are still fresh .
in the southern city of ashdod , staff of the &quot; pashosh &quot; kindergarten , who was hit by a missile , were removed before the students met granate shards from the walls and sliding showers .
&quot; we are a little afraid , but are excited , &quot; said ronit bart , resident in the kibbutz saad and there english teacher .
many children from our area urgently need a return to routine .
her 11-year-old daughter shani bart said it feels &quot; a bit comical &quot; to be suddenly reborn in the school .
&quot; these were difficult times , and we did not go out of the house at all , &quot; she said .
president reuven rivlin visited the kibbutz near the gaza border to offer his support .
until a ceasefire ended last week , thousands of people living in border communities such as saad remained in their homes or left their homes to live in safer areas further away from gaza .
many nahal oz inhabitants , a municipality near the border with gaza , where a 4-year-old boy was killed by a palestinian killer .
the ministry of education announced that about a dozen families have not returned .
their children have been temporarily housed in other schools .
prime minister benjamin netanyahu attended a school in sderot , a border town on gaza , which was severely affected by the palestinian shock .
he called on the children to learn a lot and said &apos; we will make sure that their knowledge is acquired and offer you security &apos; .
israel and hamas agreed last tuesday to an open-ended peace treaty .
the ceasefire has brought an immediate end to the fighting , but important problems remain unresolved , as hamas ’ s call for the israeli-egyptian blockade of gaza and the reopening of the aegean and sea ports .
israel is calling for the disarmament of hamas and the transfer of the bodies of two israeli soldiers killed in the fighting .
a new round of indirect talks is expected to take place in egypt this month .
in the war , more than 2,100 palestinians were killed , three quarters of them civilians , and at least 494 children , according to estimates by the palestinians and the un .
israel denies this information and estimates that at least half of the deaths are from violence .
on the israeli side , 66 soldiers and six civilians , including a thai worker , have been killed .
hamas and other gaza fighters fired 4,591 missiles and murdered shells during the fighting on israeli cities .
meanwhile , the israeli military carried out more than 5,000 air and other attacks .
the israeli attacks damaged or destroyed thousands of homes in the gaza area and about 250,000 people were searching for peace in more than 100 un schools that were provisionally located .
while tens of thousands of people continue to live in the shelter and continue fighting , educational authorities last week postponed the start of the school year .
&quot; i hope the school is soon reopened so that we can continue learning , just as the children in the world and the jewish children , &quot; said mohammad amara , a 13-year-old boy who is currently in prison .
choose from saxony : cdu-vize strobl makes npd prohibition proceedings questioned .
given the npd ’ s loss of votes in saxony , cdu federal vize thomas strobl has argued for an end to the current npd prohibition procedure in the federal constitutional court .
berlin - according to the cdu federal vize thomas strobl , the current prohibition proceedings against the npd should be brought to an end in the federal constitutional court .
&quot; the npd cuts worse than last time , &quot; strobl said , who also uses cdu as head of state in baden-württemberg , the &quot; leipzig folk newspaper &quot; .
this is a welcome development in the right direction and a development that should lead me to the conclusion that we should not forget the npd politically and not before the constitutional court .
the npd was very close to the five-percent hull during sunday ’ s vote .
a first attempt to ban the extreme right party was failed in 2003 , because the constitutional protection was also enshrined in the npd top .
in december 2013 , the federal council submitted a new application in karlsruhe after long preparation .
the federal government and the bundestag did not join .
harburg : tents for new refugees
refugees are now being placed in new countries in tents .
the central initial reception for refugees in harburg is bursting out of all seams .
now the internal authority has put three tents of the red cross on the spot .
the district politicians were informed just a moment before - they are not very enthusiastic .
&quot; these hauruck actions further fuel reservations among citizens and give the district politicians no opportunity to engage constructively in the human accommodation of refugees .
your party calls for the district administration of harburg to be able to use unused houses for accommodation at the moment .
96 refugees can be accommodated in the three tents .
the reasons for the overcrowding in the initial photo are the storm of people looking for help - and the fact that the authorities do not have enough places in follow-up facilities .
many refugees therefore remain longer than the regular three months .
house prices have increased the strongest increase in winter in seven years , showing a widely observed index .
rp data corelogic hedonic home value index for home and office owners in australia .
this increase puts the total increase in june , july and august at 4.2 % , the biggest increase in the winter months since 2007 .
the annual price increase was 10.9 percent , more than twice the price of the us dollar ’ s rise in the 12 months to august 2013 , but the increases were not evenly distributed across the country .
the research director of rp data , tim lawless , announced that sydney and melbourne had a two-tier market .
rp data ’ s figures show that house prices in sydney were up by 16.1 % last year , and that in melbourne by 11.7 % .
the following markets are adelaide , brisbane and darwin , where prices are on average five and six percent higher .
at the other end of the scale is canberra , which is hard hit by the cuts in government spending , where prices are down by only 1.4 % over the year .
mr lawless also said that the beginning of spring is now about to see an increase in the prices for sale in the next few months , which will &apos; make the market a real test &apos; .
&quot; if you want to keep the constantly high rate of auction prices , a generally fast sales rate and the ongoing low prices , you can expect a very high price .
in an opinion to the new press , he contradicts statements by ceo peer medau and accuses this , &quot; like a feldherr &quot; .
the style of the university is not that , it says in the communication .
the medau family was already &quot; informed orally by mid-june about the idea of the university .
the statement that the plans were not announced until july is definitely wrong , &quot; says pötzl .
at the same time , it points out that the plans are not &apos; preconditions or even decisions &apos; , but that they are &apos; preferences &apos; .
the development of the narrow road , which is necessary for access to the castle , is less dramatic than the meda fear .
from a nine metre wide road , there was and is not mentioned .
as things stand , we are talking about 5.50 metres , which is a metre wider than we have seen , &quot; explains pötzl .
the argument of medu operators that their free and educational parking spaces will be limited in future only by students of the university is not intended to make pötzl valid .
there is no parking at all because , as with other public parking areas , it is now possible to solve this intelligently .
the local people think of the people living near them
the children ’ s crib bergwichtel , located on the site and on its doorstep the access to the parking deck is said to be &quot; not affected &quot; by the president of the university of applied sciences .
instead , he points out that this is not just about the crèche , but also about the people living near the mouth to the friedrich streib-straße and the 800 students of the neighbouring real school .
so it is a question of much more than of the specific interests of mr medau &apos; , says pötzl .
whether parental advisory board criticism of the crèche , the expansion of the road would be &quot; one of the few natural spots of coburg lost &quot; is justified , &quot; the reader can read himself &quot; .
in early october pötzl will be working with the state building office bamberg to publish the city maps on the construction development of the university until 2020 &quot; and in this context to address the importance of new development &quot; .
peer medau had invited the parents of the children &apos;s crib to the university &apos;s plans last week .
the entrance to the new parking deck should not be via the campus and friedrich-streib-straße as it has been until now , but via the medau-berg .
this would mean that the narrow road would have to be extended to about one kilometre in two lanes .
according to the high accounts of meda , traffic in the park of hohenfels castle would increase tenfold .
of around 2000 vehicles per day .
the city has not yet been asked to comment on the project .
glandorf is a team of handball players who are in the hands of the national team .
holger glandorf will no longer play for the dhb team .
the 31-year-old from the bundesligist sg flensburg-handewitt made this decision mainly with health problems .
i did not find it easy to make the decision , it has matured for several months .
it is time for me to respond to the signals of my body and to continue my career in the national team , &quot; said the world champion from 2007 on his facebook page .
it thus takes stock of 167 country games and 576 goals for germany into the international retirement age .
because the rear wing player is a powerful rear compartment for the champions league winner from flensburg for a few years to go on torehunting , he is now on the new dagur bundestrainer .
the icelanders , who took the leadership role in the country matches against switzerland on tuesday , led glandorf to lead a long and good conversation .
his ideas and approaches have inspired me just as much as they have inspired my longtime fellow players and my successors .
but for my club i would like to be healthy in the next few years , and that is why longer periods of regeneration are needed , which do not permit the current double burden .
the left-wing hander had a new leg after a heel infection in 2012 .
the most common problem was that he had to be trained by german handball team doctors ( dhb ) with a cortison injection .
an emergency operation and two other interventions followed .
then glandorf had filed a complaint against the team doctor , the dispute ended with a comparison .
twelve years of professional and eleven years of national team career are not passed by any body without trace .
i have some health building sites that i can no longer ignore .
after the three infection-related foot operations carried out in short intervals in 2012 , i started to use my blood pressure .
this includes a number of other wear-related complaints .
at the beginning of the year i noticed that i am steering my head , but i cannot deceive my body , &quot; explained glandorf in the interview to the magazine &quot; handball time &quot; .
for a comeback , it would only be available in absolute emergency .
&quot; when all the knits tear , i am always ready to talk , &quot; the double family father explained to the magazine .
however , i cannot understand the years in which i can still play handball at one hand .
i must also say that after my long hospital stay in 2012 , i also became quite humble about my health .
after my career , i would like to be able to go at least to some extent .
in addition to the world cup title 2007 and the champions league 2014 , he won the 2008 ( hsg nordhorn ) and 2010 ( tbv lemgo ) the ehf-cup .
in 2012 , he also secured the european cup of the pokalsieger with flensburg .
german economy in the spring shrunk by 0.2 %
the crises around the world have hit the german economy in the second quarter .
gross domestic product fell from april to the end of june 2014 compared to the previous quarter by 0.2 percent .
this was reported by the federal statistical office and confirmed by the preliminary calculation .
consumption alone revived the economy in the spring , while investment declined .
foreign trade , too , slowed the economy .
thanks to the strong year start , the first half of the year will see a total gdp increase of 0.8 % compared to the second half of 2013 .
horstmar was the starting point and the destination of the &quot; münsterland-mooiste &quot; , which was first introduced on sunday to the town of burgmannsstadt .
the burgmannstadt horstmar was invaded by dutch &quot; fetzenrider &quot; on sunday .
the largest cycling association in the netherlands , ntfu , organised the so-called &quot; münsterlande mooiste &quot; .
this is the biggest cycling tour through the münsterland , the cycle trail paradise of the alps near the netherlands .
more than 1000 participants thanked jos ter huerne for the organisation of this tour through the münsterland .

we come from the heroes and went overnight to participate in this tour .
we would also like to bring the münsterland closer to us in this way , &quot; cyclists were delighted with the route through the steinfurt , borken and coesfeld districts .
after registration at the club house of the südzützbräderschaft sta .
katharina was on a small &quot; peace trip &quot; through the city across the wall , where the start was also made .
the route , which is designed to be advertised for three different categories , led to the herrenholz over the schöppinger mountain in the direction of coesfeld and via havixbeck and billerbeck .
on routes of 95 kilometres with 1175 metres of altitude , 120 kilometres with 1475 metres of altitude and 145 kilometres of altitude , the cyclists have proved their good condition .
they were cared for on the way to havixbeck and billerbeck .
the main organizer jos ter huerne and mayor heinz lölfing showed the success of this cycling event very pleased .
we are satisfied and it was a nice experience for all those involved .
the organization went without a problem and there were no negative incidents , &quot; attracts heinz lölfing a positive conclusion of this event .
unfortunately , not as many participants as the organizer had hoped , which was probably due to the bad weather forecasts and the morning weather .
&quot; we are back in 2015 , hopefully in good weather on august 30 or during another weekend , &quot; the cyclists promised to return to münsterland and the organisers plan to reissue the new edition .
konstantin wecker &apos;s unscrupulous honest memoirs
it is actually more philosophical testimony than biography , which konstantin wecker , liedermacher , pacifist , politically safe activist , ex-detainee , in &quot; monen krieg and ...
not chronologically , but more thoughts fetches for fouls of thought have been given to the cosmopolitan artist , born on june 1 , 1947 , each chapter commenced by a suitable song text .
and he is ruthlessly honest : from the onanie as a gymnasium to shoplifting and drug use , he leaves no human weakness .
also , to show how he himself can show tolerance in dealing with his fellow human beings .
there is also a broad range of abstract , but even more important terms : love , soul , ego , being in the now , spirituality - all this he tries to get to the bottom of , in very philosophical but also very philosophical terms .
and he also explains his pacifism , his social criticism , his political commitment - and also how he is influenced not only by music ( the opera lover was named soul and rock music ) .
the latter has named the lebemann konstantin wecker also closer to the asketic monk , who is &quot; created by subtraction &quot; , as he says , &quot; leaving everything unnecessary &quot; .
there is a difference between all the high spiritual views , however , and also short anecdotes for earth : for example , on beatings in a local or an insane car trip , where he is in front .
here too , he is ruthlessly honest .
lenny henry : my father never put me in the arm .
never said &quot; i love you &quot;
henry was one of seven children of a family of jamaican immigrants in dudley in the midlands in 1958 .
his father , who died when henry 19 was , worked in a factory and their relationship was limited .
henry is trying for a comedy , rudy &apos;s rare records , which is partly based on an imaginary conversation with his father and is from the series on radio 4 .
the soundtrack is a mixture of reggae and rap , with lively melodies .
but henry had to be inspired by some difficult childhood moments .
he visited &quot; many &quot; therapies after the death of his mother , and henry is thoughtful about his relationship with his father .
it was difficult to know him .
you never saw his face , only heard his voice : &quot; listen to the crash .
let your sister rest in peace .
get yourself !
i want to look at cricket .
my elder brothers seymour and hilton - who had grown up when i was a child - went to the pub with him and talked about things like the form of beer glass or the beauty of a cricket .
i have never had such a conversation with him .
he was a serious guy in the corner of my life , reading the newspaper .
recently , henry opened a foundry in dudley , and although the conditions are better than in the days of his father , he won an insight into how life is for him .
it is now somewhat brighter , but they are dark , smoked , deep stylish labyrinths with flame shocks and smoke and much soot .
my father simply put his pan in the past and then he was slowly heard how to sing .
when i ran around , i realized that he had been doing this for years to get the food on the table .
yet henry grew up as a child without his parents ’ love testimonies .
my father never embraced me , he never said &quot; i love you &quot; .
only when my mother was ill at the end of her life did we start to love you , i love you , i love you , i love you .
by his own daughter bill , with dawn french , he could share the love he had as a child .
could you ever be with the &quot; i love you &quot; ?
stop me embracing !
dad , i am 22 !
with dawn french .
why should we not be friends ?
she is a great mother .
it is still with french friends , with whom he has 25 years of marriage .
dawn is a good man .
why should we not be friends ?
she is a great mother .
henry &apos;s own mother was a diabetic .
this contributed to their death .
so when i was very , very overweight and had symptoms of diabetes , my doctor said &apos; you must be radical .
so i moved this fitnessing. i had to make a drastic diet to reverse the symptoms .
it is very difficult .
and it is exhausting .
nobody likes to eat carrots .
henry ’ s career changes may be reflected in his elegant , short cut beard .
since he was nominated by the critics for his othello , he has been captured by the theatre .
the comedy of the mistakes followed , and then fences of august wilson .
this is a different experience from the sitcoms and comedy that his busy working life has filled .
he began with only 16 years when he worked in a factory .
a dj discovered him on stage when he imitated and wrote to new faces about him .
his television career began in the mid-1970s . &quot; i was for a fairly long time the only black imitator / comedian on television . &quot;
he learned at work .
i had to be big not only in the eyes of the public , but also from 1975 to 1985 to learn how to create an efficient joke narrative machine , while watching television as a star , and that was really difficult .
lenny 1975 at new faces
his manager has set the stage right at black and white minstrel show , so he was a slight entertainment program where he could find out what he was looking for .
the room was very small and the bathroom was very small .
i would somehow wish it never happened , but i do not regret that i did it .
it was a strange , unpleasant position for me , but i worked on giant projects and learned how to work with a large audience .
but this &quot; year &apos;s award-winning light pillar of british television &quot; was also a &quot; grotesque parody of black people . &quot;
by introducing figures that the british black culture both diluted and cowardly , henry worked in the 1980 ’ s at an alternative comedycircle .
the first series of lenny henry show was broadcast in 1984 , and in the 1990s he was known as the chef gareth blacklock in the comedy club series .
advertising , documentaries , tv series and film roles have shaped his next decade , but after his bbc series lennyhenry.tv 2008 thought that he would be &quot; what is you doing next ?
then came a documentary series for radio 4 , entitled what &apos;s so great about ... ?
the first episode was about shakespeare .
shakespeare was a real allergic person .
i never really had learned something about him in school and thought it was mostly a domain of the middle class , white in tights , and a little bit of a coal head in front of it .
so i was very afraid of it .
all of us who interviewed for the show , peter hall , trevor nunn , adrian lester , judi dench said , &quot; you should try it .
do not do it badly if you don &apos;t know what you are talking about .
put a few words in your mouth , and then you will understand why we all shakespeare so dear .
henry introduced 20 lines from othless last speech for the documentary film and he was enthusiastic .
i felt i could do that .
it was as if someone had finally put my head right .
&quot; that is what it is about , it is a serious thing , take them seriously , read your text , research a little .
the samples were brutal , and i read this piece for months before we made it .
and it was a success .
they seemed to expect a car accident , and that simply did not happen .
and soon he joined the comedy of the mistakes .
suddenly i was in the national theatre and i could hardly believe it .
there was a moment when i thought &quot; oh , you changed you &quot; .
there was a technical error and henry felt instinctively that he had to entertain the audience .
&quot; a little voice told me &quot; you must now bridge 10 minutes while you repair the computer . &quot;
instead , the stage leader announced that the idea would continue as soon as the problem was resolved .
i went from the stage and something in me said &quot; oh , thank god &quot; .
i am not responsible for that .
i can leave that to someone else .
&quot; you play in a play , so stay in your role . &quot;
henry in fences at the duchess theatre
learning the text for fences was challenging .
panic is very good , that strengthens the desires .
that too was a good thing , so it is like a great shield of the gods who tell me &quot; this is your destiny &quot; .
he says this , of course , with a thundering voice .
so i will stick to that .
i really love that .
i love to be in a sample room .
henry still has the head of a comedian - our conversation is full of humorous outbreaks while he is imitating people .
i decided not to use a stand-up comedy because i think that this type of immediate release is not the right place for a chamber full of strangers .
if you are looking for something , you are driving in front of a wall .
i sometimes go live in apollo when i want to see it , but overall i don &apos;t have as much time as i did before .
i ask him if he ever has a stand-up comedy tour again .
the fun i have in a room with a director who helps to create a beginning , a middle part and the end of a journey - i think not , that i have ever seen it again .
so is this his new incarnation ?
i think so .
i am a actor .
it is fun .
you always tell a story , and that is great .
i love stories .
people love stories .
huthi rebels are blocking streets in yemen ’ s capital city , yemen ’ s capital , capital , capital , and capital , yemen ’ s streets .
in the conflict between shiite huthi rebels and yemeni government , the huthis have led to civil disobedience in the capital , sanaa .
huthi supporters could have seen central streets in sanaa on monday , said huthi party spokesman , ansar allah .
the access to parliament has also been blocked .
yemeni media report a traffic chaos in the capital .
according to the online edition of the newspaper &quot; yemen post &quot; , huthi leader abdulmalik al-huthi had declared on sunday evening the measures .
huthi threatened to be killed by another escalation of the conflict , according to the leaf , if his demands were not met .
the shiite huthis are fighting for more independence from the sunni-ruled yemen and are calling for the government to retreat .
the people &apos;s tribe of huthi has been besieging the yemeni capital for just two weeks .
about 30,000 rebels have protest camps at the large access routes of sanaa .
the surrounding area is a source of bloody fighting with the yemeni army .
kenya registers officials to &quot; ghost employees &quot; to contain the burden of &quot; ghost employees &quot; .
kenya has begun to bind all state officials biometric to &quot; confront ghost workers &quot; from the pay lists of the government .
employees who are not registered in the next two weeks would no longer be paid , and there was a government communication .
the government suspects that thousands of people will still be able to escape from the public service with pay .
president uhuru kenyatta promised to build a new government corruption in 2013 .
at the beginning of this year , it was discovered that at least $ 1 million ( £ 700,000 ) per month of payments for &quot; ghost workers &quot; and other abusive financial practices were lost .
the government suspects that salaries will continue to be paid on accounts after a person has died or has been dismissed from the public service , reports wanyama chebusiri for the bbc from the capital nairobi .
all officials must now be present at identification centres in the next two weeks to ensure that their data on biometric registrations are included , was reported in a government message .
all those who cannot do this without a credible apology would be removed from the pay list , which was the communication .
&quot; this approach will make a significant contribution to the rationalization of public services by identifying the actual number of officials and by also reducing the pay list on both levels of government - thus the &quot; ghost employees &quot; will be eliminated .
the scandal surrounding the art adviser helge achenbach will be dealt with in court for the first time on 11 november .
five heirs of berthold albrecht , son of aldi founder theo albrecht , are calling for the death of his son in a civil trial at the düsseldorf regional court 19.4 million euros .
that was announced by a spokesperson on monday .
in the case of the case , it is stated that achenbach has already made a significant contribution to the purchase of works of art and oldtimers and has paid berthold albrecht higher than actual paid purchase prices .
this also means that the commission agreed to be higher .
achenbach has invested eur 121 million in value items for albrecht .
children need roots and wings
he was in school for 44 years , 23 of them as head of the school .
from this time , manfred richter knows many senior petershausener and kollbacher from their time as a student .
his methods were sometimes unconventional , but always supported by his desire to teach the people .
the snowkoppe is the most famous mountain in the giant mountains .
manfred richter loves the painting with the motif from his home country .
judges were born in trautenau , north bohemia , now trutnov .
he was already interested in the german language after four years of secondary school .
one year on , the sudeten germans were expropriated .
within half an hour , the family had to leave their house .
after a few months in a warehouse went to bavaria in 1946 - in the freight wagon .
judges went into the upper franconian sencillant village .
the teacher training took place in bamberg .
to this end , manfred richter had to walk six times a week to the nearest train station , travel by train to bamberg , there three kilometres across the city to school and return in the evening .
after two months , manfred got judges in a red cross home in bamberg : together with up to 15 students in a sleeping room .
in 1951 , he made the first and in 1954 , after three years of school graduate , the second state exam .
since oberfranken had no free teacher &apos;s office for him , he applied for upper bavaria and came to the university on november 1 , 1954 .
the &quot; fräulein room &quot; was his first &quot; business apartment &quot; in the school building .
in 1958 he moved to the new building teacher &apos;s house next to the school a three-room apartment .
this house bought manfred richter in 1980 , after the school dissolved in kollbach in 1968 .
until then , there were no such events in kollbach in the petershausen-kollbach school association and in petershausen five classes .
from the school year 1968 / 69 , these were published in petershausen in today &apos;s town hall .
when the school association indiersdorf was founded , only primary school remained in the village .
in order to avoid a downgrade in the now smaller school , the then rector georg sigl moved to karlsfeld - and manfred richter was his successor .
but petershausen grew , and so the children and their teachers were able to move to the present building , which was built in 1997 according to judge retirement .
manfred richter commends the uncomplicated generosity of the then mayor ludwig götz , who added a work room and a kellerrooms to the communal costs in 1997 , although this was guidelines according to the extension .
&quot; mayor götz was very school-friendly &quot; , remembered judge .
in all his career , manfred richter never heard the speech of a government representative who was waiting for a school council unit on justice and law : &apos; you cannot ever be the lover &apos; .
&quot; we must give the children two things : roots and wings , &quot; says the 84-year-old today .
and he had to learn : &quot; that is not always successful &quot; , whether he is only talking about his students or his own six children , is not quite clear .
in any case , judges were sometimes unconventional .
when students check , they did not get a penal job and were not allowed to sit down .
judges had two pairs of boxing gloves at the expense of the community and had the two opposing men compete against each other , even though there was a veil .
for the good of the school , judges used to have a good relationship as rector with the then mayor ludwig götz ( csu ) .
he moved the partisan judge after his retirement to be the last to appear on the csu list for the local council in 1996 .
but judges were chosen to rank six and joined the csu .
180 km , three days
hr4-cycling tour 700 cyclists take part in the spa park of bad salzhausen and schotten stopovers .
if radler is on tour in bad salzhausen or schotten , that is not something special in itself .
on friday , however , the number of resting impressions were only as follows : the 700 participants of the hr4 cycling tour and the accompanying tross enjoyed a break in the lower spa park of bad salzhausen and later a party outside .
under the motto &quot; cycling and celebrating on newly discovered paths between nidda and kinzig &quot; , participants had a meeting in bad vilbel on thursday and had a concert by van baker &amp; band .
friday was a serious day : the cyclists took the first stage , which took 60 kilometres across florstadt to bad salzhausen and further to scotland .
in bad salzhausen , the athletes of mayor hans-peter seum , who was biking in bad vilbel , and the leader of the self-catering bad salzhausen , petra schwinn , were invited .
for a refreshing break in body and mind , everything was prepared : the women of the rantown and the nieder-mockstadt had 85 sheets of apple , goat , streaming , and other cheese .
&quot; such cakes can only bake women in rural areas , &quot; praised a participant from aulendiebach , while ordering another piece of cake .
at the beverage stand of the turnverein geiß-nidda cold refreshments were obtained .
the &quot; duo bravo &quot; entertained the visitors with famous melodies from operetta and musicals and harvested enthusiastic applause .
the park &apos;s beautiful ambience was relaxing .
a gentleman also enjoyed a head massage from his partner : &quot; he deserves , after all , he has already jumped off bicycle chains today .
meanwhile , the mayor and the managing director had to work : they were laid at the well in front of reporter rainer janke interviewed by reporter &apos;s drinking cure house and took the opportunity to listen to the radio for bad salthaus .
tomias hagen , the head of the promotion , has been working as tour leader since the first hr4 cycle tour 2004 , and he had plenty of time to do so with the technology on the spot .
his pickup truck , which is connected to the network via three phones and a radio unit with his staff and the 15-person motorcycle relay of the police hessen , communicated facebook entries .
&quot; most of the participants come from the rhine-main-region , &quot; he said , &quot; but also from gießen or fulda , from lauterbach or the taunus , and even from many cities in westphalia .
the number of participants is a little dependent on the available accommodation capacities .
in category i , participants are accommodated in hotels , in category ii in group accommodation .
the cyclists had a good impression of the spa when they were back in the afternoon after a hour and a half : &quot; chess ! &quot;
&quot; it was nice in bad salzhausen ! &quot; wink to farewell .
after arriving in scotland , the group was allowed to take a short break .
but in the evening the cyclists were in the idyllic alteburgpark .
under the direction of the schottener gesellschaft für tourism and city marketing ( gts ) , the park had received a beautiful festambiente and of course had tasty delicacies , such as flame cakes with well cooled federite whites .
mayor susanne schaab , gts managing director markus hoßfeld and msc-chairman wolfgang wagner-sachs in his capacity as a member of the executive board of adac hessen-thüringen .
the three were clearly pleased with the &quot; many operations in scotland &quot; .
dj tobias hagen then released the dance stage .
the opportunity to move under the sky was not lost despite the sporting activity on the bike eifrig .
the guests were increasingly mixed with citizens who were attracted by the good atmosphere as well as the great number of cyclists .
on the second day the bikers were offered the birstein , wächtersbach and bad orb stations , including a concert with the trenkwaldern .
yesterday , after 180 kilometers of radels , the athletes met again in bad vilbel .
dozens of turkish police officers were arrested for &quot; conspiracy &quot; against the government .
a total of 33 police officers were arrested in turkey on the suspicion of the &apos; conspiracy against the government &apos; , reported to local media agencies .
the police authorities gave no immediate comment .
among the detainees , 14 senior police officers , hürriyet daily reports , are arrested .
some of them were involved in the corruption investigation against government officials , including four government ministers last december .
in july , a number of turkish police officers were arrested for supposedly having established an organised criminal association and for tapping telephone numbers .
turkish president recep tayyip erdogan ( who was prime minister at the time ) described her actions as part of the activities carried out by the islamist spiritual fethulla gülen against him and other people in turkey .
not all ukraine ’ s children return to school
schools opened in almost all ukraine on monday ( september 1 ) after the summer holidays .
this day is traditionally an important day for families , and , like thousands of other ukrainian parents , prime minister arseni jazenjuk brought his daughter to school .
there he told waiting journalists that not all schools had reopened , but that he was determined to open the country for future generations :
september celebrations were not held in every school .
the sky is not peaceful across ukraine .
we must fight for a peaceful heaven .
the whole of ukraine , a huge common ukrainian people &apos;s front , must fight for a peaceful heaven .
aleksan pastukhow , head of school in slavjansk , the jazenjuk daughter visited , spoke in russian .
we hope that peace will finally reign here and that children will receive an education that will be useful to them in their further life .
the first day of the new school year is traditionally celebrated , with children embroidered shirts , balloons in their hands and their teachers being flowers .
with rona fairhead , the bbc may have found the great director it needs .
it meets with a proud glory from the banking world , media management and the inner circle of tory party .
and she has her own frontal experience .
her career began with the global management consulting company bain and co . , to which she has been awarded morgan stanley , bombadier , ici and the media world of pearsons .
she was the ceo of the financial times for seven years and resigned when the chief post of parent company pearson was transferred to a younger male .
their severance was supposed to be nearly £ 1 million .
their political ranking is also solid .
she was played by lord brown , the former chairman of bp , david cameron , when he was looking for more private knowledge in whitehall : she was appointed berate .
her husband is a former tory council member .
in may , i described the task of the chairman with a poisoned cup .
not only is the bbc a huge and complex entity in the heart of public life , but there is also an internal paradox in its structure .
confidence is twofold : inward to the first guard of the own management hierarchy in the bbc , but also to the outside as a voice of public concern and disquiet when things go wrong .
this creates an almost unsustainable duopoly , which , in turn , requires a complete comprehensive reform .
but what new incoming chairman would risk joining the european parliament to do everything and set up an institution that is so complex as a chinese dynasty that , while standing in the process of raising its own jobs , he might be doing .
it is a difficult task .
and as if this were not enough , many are still interested in seeing the bbc reduced - power , money and status overtaken .
while competition is approaching and new technologies are creating a threat to old , convenient collateral , the forthcoming negotiation of licence fees for the bbc will entail particular dangers .
for the modest sum of £ 145.50 per year , the british public is buying up to what is certainly the largest media company in the world .
the bbc tells a good story : it says that it has reached 96 % of all households and each of them costs only 40 pence a day .
and it seems that the bbc is rising on the popularity scale again : 53 % support the us today , compared to 31 % before 10 years .
the visual and usage habits for the bbc have changed : i get news reports today .
but she remains a very beloved and notable institution .
it needs a considerable chairman - i hope she has found him .
perry from texas says that descending tweet was not authorized .
a tweet from the republican governor ’ s official account , rick perry , on sunday debuted a downward trend .
the tweet was later deleted and replaced by another perry user account that changed the previous last time .
a tweet is sent out from my account that is not authorized by me .
&quot; i don &apos;t approve the tweet and have deleted it , &quot; said it in the later news .
perry staff did not respond promptly to requests for comments .
although the tweets of perry &apos;s official account were out , it was not clear who actually received the feed .
in the former tweet , an unfavorable picture of the district prosecutor of travis county , rosemary lehmberg , was drawn , which was published in april 2013 for drunkenness .
perry vetoed financial support for her office when she refused to grant it .
the tweets text reads : &apos; i do not always drink drunk with the triple permitted alcohol level ... but if i do it , i am complaining .
i am the most drunk democrat in texas .
lehmberg ’ s office was not in charge of the examination of the grand jury against perry .
this was created by michael mccrum , a special prosecutor from san antonio , who was chosen by a republican judge .
perry is pleading for not guilty and calling the charge a political trick .
his high-class team of legal advisers applied for the case to be referred to as the prosecutor .
perry stopped $ 7.5 million of government funds to the public integrity union .
this veto caused a public complaint from a left-wing watchdog group .
perry &apos;s official account is frequently updated - and sometimes famous .
after having been elected to the iowa election meetings during his presidential candidacy in 2012 as the fifth , perry went on to speculate that he would stop .
berkeley explains the housing market to be &quot; normal &quot; again .
one of the most prominent builders in london pointed out that the housing sector is in the south-east of england again becoming a normal &apos; back door &apos; .
homes in the capital were hotly sought and the subject of huge price increases , which the bank of england did not want to see , owing to widespread fear of a credit bubble .
tony pidgley , founder and ceo of the high-class construction company berkeley said on monday : &quot; since the start of the current financial year , the market has returned to normal transaction levels since the highest level in 2013 .
the property market in london was well established during the downturn , as foreign buyers pushed into the capital .
according to the registry office , prices in the city area have dropped by 18.5 % in the last year alone , far more than the average increase in england and wales as a whole .
the average sales price at berkeley ’ s private , cheap , and student offers rose by about a fifth last year , reaching a level of 423,000 £ at the end of april .
however , a stronger pound has brought real estate property in london to foreign buyers less attractive in recent months - some of them have also been weakened by the introduction of new property taxes and political rhetoric about a possible &quot; villa tax &quot; .
london real estate agent foxton warned that the last week , the mortgage market price report for april , in which the sharper interest rate on lending was expected to be in the first reading .
new data from the bank of england on monday show a decline in mortgage allowance in july , which also indicates that the uk &apos;s housing market is slowing .
hamptions international , another real estate agency , corrected its forecast for the rise in london ’ s property prices for 2015 to 3 % , based on a weaker growth rate already in place .
the volume of transactions in the most expensive areas of london , such as chelsea , mayfair and kensington , has now fallen by a quarter year on year , according to the broker wa ellis .
however , the desire for a home in the capital of berkeley is a blessing , as the amounts due for forward sales are more than 2.2 billion £ .
mr pidgley added : &apos; the demand for the right , well-planned product at the best locations remained stable and as a result are the deadlines sales .
in june , the company reported that there were 3,742 new homes in the year until the end of april - almost a third more than at the 2007 peak before the crisis .
annual preliminary tax earnings rose by 40 percent to € 280 million , sales rose by 18 percent to € 1.6 billion .
in a communication on monday before the company &apos;s annual meeting , mr pidgley said that the revenue for berkeley is expected to be in line with current market expectations in the current year .
the analysts estimate , in agreement , the annual preliminary tax result to £ 450 million .
berkeley shares were held in london in the afternoon at 23.96 £ .
nude photos of jennifer lawrence by hackers published on the internet .
jennifer lawrence gig at the 85th oscar award .
nude photos of the oscar winner jennifer lawrence were taken online by a hacker who claimed that a &quot; mastered list &quot; of images of another 100 starlets .
a representative of the star &quot; the tribute of panem &quot; confirmed that the photos of lavrence echt are genuine and complained of the hacker for &quot; blatant violation of privacy &quot; .
the authorities have been notified and will follow up all those who have taken the stolen photos of jennifer lawrence .
the photos originally taken on the photo sharing page 4chan are now available in the photo gallery .
it is not certain how many images are genuine , although winstead , star from &quot; scott pilgrim against the rest of the world &quot; on twitter also condemned the hack .
&quot; to those of you who look at photos that my husband and i took years ago in the private environment of our house - i hope you are so satisfied with you , &quot; winstead wrote on twitter .
victoria justice from the niclode series &quot; icarly &quot; and &quot; victoria justice &quot; are now on the way to a new series of photographs .
let us stand up for the beginning . * word play intended * .
buzzfeed reported on late sunday that a speaker of the popstar has been ariana grande , who has been trying to explain the authenticity of the alleged photos of her .
exclusive excerpt from howard jacobson ’ s highly acclaimed new novel about love and the letters &quot; j &quot; .
they were disrupted , so it was best to describe it , they slowly dissolved like a cardboard that could be put up in the rain .
occasionally , a woman told him that he was too serious , strenuous , intensive , distanced and perhaps a little scratch-brushing .
and then shaken his hand .
scratzbrustig he knew .
he was stacheconous , as in igel , yes .
the last victim of this stasis was a recent affair that was promising .
ailin solomons was a trembling beauty with untamed hair and a flair .
she was married to an older companion , who had been known to kevern for her aunt , and who had built a plot in a damp but paradise valley with the name paradise valley .
for several years , no one had lived in the house .
the tubes were leak , in the baths were still spinning , nude necks had their tracks on all windows and believed that they were in the same thing , and the garden was filled with unruly cows .
it was like the house of a child fairy , both threatening and tempting , a garden full of secrets .
portrait of the author : howard jacobson , whose novel &quot; j &quot; on the longlist for which man booker prize 2014 is written .
the shortlist will be announced next week .
kevern had a trade holding with ailin on the broken deck chairs in the high grass and had an unusually warm spring afternoon .
your feet are too big .
because of their own aggressiveness , songs of this kind were no longer played on the console .
not banned - nothing was really forbidden - simply not played .
it has been successfully obsolescent , just as the word obsolete .
the general taste created what decrees and regulations could never have done , and how people used vom tones in books .
in the euphoria of the day , kevern began to play an imaginary piano and to perform in a grob-comic serenade of ailin ’ s great feet .
ailinn did not understand that .
&quot; this was a well-known song of a jazz pianist called fats waller , &quot; he explained it and automatically put two fingers on his lips .
his father had always done this to stop the letter j before he left his mouth .
it had been a game between him and his father when he was still small .
his father had played it with his own father , so he had told .
if you start a word with a j without putting two fingers over your lips , it costs you a penny .
it was not a very funny game at that time , and it was not very funny even now .
he knew that he was expecting him , that was all .
it had to explain what jazz was .
ailinn had never heard of any .
jazz , although not directly banned , was not played .
improvisation was no longer modern .
there was only room for a single &quot; if &quot; in life .
people wanted to be at the beginning of a melody quite sure where it would end .
so is the mind .
his unpredictability made people nervous .
and jazz was musically expressive mind .
although he was 10 years old without being taught by sammy davis junior , he knew that he was a little bit about jazz from the semi-secret collection of old cds by his father .
but at least he did not have to explain to ailin that fats waller was black .
at her age , she probably could not remember a time when pop singers were not black .
once again , no laws or constraints were in place .
a conform society meant that every element of this society thankfully adhered to the principle of group talents - thankfully , like those spared from fate .
people with afro-caribbean origins were affected by temperament and body building for entertainment and sport , so sang and run them .
people who were originally from the indian subcontinent were like nature with electronic talent , but they were not very happy with the task of getting them to work .
what remains of the polish community was not concerned with the sewer system ; what was proposed by the greeks was swallowed down .
those from the gulf states and the levante , whose grandparents had not quickly left the country than what had happened when it had happened , were fearful of being torn down by fire .
everyone according to their abilities .
she was a member of the &quot; kulturstiftung &quot; ( the &quot; kulturstiftung &quot; ) , and she was a member of the &quot; klingon empire &quot; .
music was an expression of love .
&quot; they are not really offensive , &quot; kevern said .
except perhaps for people whose feet are too big .
my father never insulted anyone , but he loved this song .
he talked too much , but the neglected garden gave him the deceptive feeling of security .
the room was very small and the bathroom was very small .
ailinn still did not understand .
why should your father have loved this ?
he wanted to say that it was a jux , but hesitated to return to two fingers in their presence .
she already thought that he had something strange .
&quot; it seemed funny to him , &quot; he said instead .
she shattered disbelief and blocked bogeons ’ view .
there was nothing else to see the world over than to see your uncombated rabbit black hair .
there was nothing he would have liked to see otherwise .
&quot; if you say it , &quot; you mean without conviction .
but that doesn &apos;t explain why you want to do it to me .
they seemed to be genuinely concerned .
are my feet too big ?
he looked back again .
your feet so directly not .
maybe your ankles , a little bit ...
and you say , you hate me because my ankles are too thick ?
hate you ?
of course i do not hate you .
that is just the stupid song .
he could have said &quot; i love you &quot; , but it was too early for that .
&quot; your big ankles are exactly the reason why you like me , &quot; tried to make it instead .
i am a little perverse .
that sounds wrong .
it was funny .
when he tried to be funny , he often got into trouble because he was like his father , not having the calming charm .
perhaps his father also wanted to be cruel .
perhaps he wanted to be that , kevern .
despite his kind eyes .
ailin solomons was red and rose from her mooring .
the wine of the floral , so drunkenness was no excuse for him .
in their excitement , they seemed to tremble as palm wedel did in the storm .
and your thick head is exactly the reason why i feel perverse unto you .
except that i am not .
she was suffering from both the unnecessary infriendliness of his words and the fear that has spread in her eyes when she turned against him .
did you think he would beat them ?
she had not told him of life on the cold northern archipelago , where she had grown up , but he had no doubt that there was essentially such a thing as here .
the same huge and ice-cold ocean broke here as there on the shore .
the same confused men , with even thicker skin and verily after what happened , as it was their ancestors smugglers and beach robbers , moved from kneipe to kneipe .
a big head ?
they would have shown her a big fist if she didn &apos;t fit up !
you can knut first - it was the most commonly used word for erotic anxiety .
kevern ’ s view was that this was an unnecessary refinement , as the knut itself was already an act of violence .
ailin solomons gave him a sign through her body .
he was born from the recumbent like an old man .
she also felt stuck , but the power of his grief surprised her .
that was not the end of the world .
they hardly knew about it .
she looked at him as he distanced himself - as he did from a room on the top floor , her companion watched him - a man , complaining about something he himself had summoned .
adam leaves the garden , she thought .
she felt a sudden pain for him and men in general , although some rose up their hands against them .
a man turned away from her , his back bowed , ashamed , defeated , without any fighting spirit - why was this a sight that she had good to know ?
when she was alone again , ailin looked at her feet .
several years before the events that have just been told , esme nussbaum , an intelligent and enthusiastic 32 year old researcher on behalf of ofnow , the non-legislative surveillance office of the european union .
&quot; a lot has been done and a lot still needs to be done , &quot; she wrote , &quot; to defend the innate aggressiveness of a people that led a thousand wars and won most of them , especially in the remote regions .
but some features are unextinctible .
the higher the church tower , it seems , the lower the passion it continues to arouse .
the people are crying when listening to sentimental balladen , they are bewitching stories of overcame difficulties and claiming to remember the virtues of marriage and family life , but yet not only does rohthness hold the rural communities .
&quot; they have an unfortunate tendency to exaggeration , &quot; said their mentor when he read the whole report .
i propose that you read less novels .
esme nussbaum lowered her head .
i must also ask : are you atheist ?
&quot; i think i don &apos;t have to say that &quot; replied esme nussbaum .
are they lesbian ?
again esme spoke about her right to privacy and refusal of statement .
feminist ?
silence again .
&quot; i don &apos;t ask this , &quot; said luther rabinowitz , &quot; because i am against atheism , lesbian or feminism .
this is a job without prejudice .
we are serving a society that is free from prejudice .
but certain types of hypersensitivity , which are in itself absolutely acceptable and commendable , may occasionally produce results , as you have presented .
you yourself have obviously been prejudiced against the church , and these things that you describe as &apos; disgusting &apos; and &apos; raw &apos; could be as well expressed by others as an expression of a natural strength and vitality .
if you continue on the road that has happened , you will be able to see that if there were any problems yesterday , then you will be able to give the country its essential vitality .
esme walnut saw the way around , while rabinowitz spoke .
behind his head , a led letter in flamingorosa repeated the advice that ofnow gave to the country in the last quarter-century or more .
smile to your neighbour , value your partner , listen to ballads , visit musicals , use your phone , talk , explain how you listen to your voice , agree to be apologized .
speaking is better than silence , the common word is better than the written , but nothing is better than love .
&quot; i understand absolutely what they want to do , &quot; esme nussbaum replied with calm voice when she was sure that her superior would have spoken to the end , &quot; and i say nothing but that we are still doing .
my concern is that without warning we may be able to find ways of improving the mistakes we have made in the first place in relation to what has happened , when it has happened .
this time , however , it is not the others that we have to take away our anger and mistrust .
luther rabinowitz shaped a pyramid with his hands .
to achieve an engel-patience .
&quot; they go too far , &quot; he said , &quot; if they call acts &quot; error &quot; that our grandparents may or may not have committed .
they also go too far in saying that they have their &apos; anger &apos; and their &apos; mistrust &apos; to &apos; others &apos; .
it should not be necessary to give someone in their position to remind you that we have a lot to do in understanding the past , as in protecting the present , not &quot; us &quot; and &quot; others &quot; .
there was no &quot; we &quot; and there were no &quot; others &quot; .
it was a time of disorder , that is all we know .
&quot; of the if we are honest with ourselves , &quot; dared to throw in esme , &quot; no part of society can claim to have behaving well .
i am not complaining to anyone .
whether it was done badly or well , what happened has happened .
that was then .
nothing more needs to be said about this - we are in agreement on that .
and , just as no fault has to be attributed , no guilt must be repaid if such repayment is appropriate and if there is a way to repay it .
but what is the point of the past if we do not learn from it - and i am not learning from it - and what is the point of the past ?
the past serves to make us forget them .
if i may say something about this , i would like to say something about it .
luther rabinowitz put his pyramid together .
&quot; i will consider your report , &quot; he said and dismissed it .
the next day , when she went to work as usual , she was overrun by a motorcyclist who , as passers-by described , was living in a kind of &quot; brutal rage &quot; on the footpath .
there are coincidences .
lesotho military member says that no coup d &apos;état is planned ; prime minister remains in south africa ; prime minister remains in south africa ; prime minister remains in south africa
military officials in lesotho contend that a coup d &apos;état was planned to overthrow the government , and said that they were against policemen who had been denied the arming of political fanatics .
prime minister thomas thabane fled the country and said that the country ’ s army would relocate and rebuild government buildings in the capital , maseru .
the premier brought his family to the neighbouring south africa after being tortured by the threats of assassination .
military spokesman major ntlele ntoi said that there is , in fact , no coup d &apos;état , but that the military is responding to the threat of &apos; political fanatics &apos; , whose weapons were put in the police .
&quot; what happened this morning was that the defence forces of lesotho acted after he had met several intelligence reports .
the south african spokesman clayson monyela said that the military action has the impression of a turmoil .
&quot; even if no one has claimed that the government had been torn by violence , all the reports are agreed that the activities of lesotto &apos;s defence forces have so far been indicative of a coup , &quot; he said .
spokesman of the lesotho military said on sunday that the soldiers had entered their barracks and had to leave the situation in the capital calm .
meanwhile , the vice premier mothetjoya metsing takes over the leadership of thabane ’ s absence .
thabane said that he believed he was a man who was absent from the country because of his attempt to combat corruption .
in lesotho , there have been major tensions since june , after thabane &apos;s parliamentary meetings have been suspended because of the disputes in his unity government .
he said that his actions would not have undermined the government , despite otherwise loud accusations .
production in the eurozone at a 13-month low
the growth in eurozone output slowed in august to the lowest level in the last 13 months , so one could see a very closely observed study .
the final markit purchasing management index of the manufacturing industry ( pmi ) fell in august to 50.7 , after a booth of 51.8 in july .
a figure of 50 indicates an expansion .
new orders went down and factories suffered breakdowns at a time of rising tensions between the eu and russia over ukraine .
the figures are available before the european central bank ( ecb ) meeting on thursday .
markets expect the bank to provide a clear plan for dealing with a eurozone reluctant recovery , as well as for the imminent deflation of only 0.3 % inflation rate .
there is speculation that the head of the ecb , mario draghi , will be able to provide further information later this week as to whether he is going to propose quantitative easing for the euro area , according to those from the united kingdom .
&quot; although a small growth is better than no growth at all , the braking effects of the increasing economic and geopolitical uncertainties have become clearer for manufacturers , &quot; said rob dobson , chief economist markit .
the factory pmi for germany , russia ’ s largest trading partner in the eu , fell to the lowest level in 11 months with 51.4 .
meanwhile , in the second largest economy in the block , france , the pmi fell to 46.9 .
france remains a troubled child , as is italy ’ s decline from solid expansion to stagnation .
evidence that stimulus growth is in the key industry mechanism in germany and spain and the netherlands is no longer effective is also unreassuring , &quot; said mr. dobson .
the decline in industry is likely to fuel the fire of analysts who want to avoid further monetary or fiscal stimulus .
positive news came from the republic of ireland , where the pmi rose to 57.3 , the highest level since the end of 1999 .
howard archer , chief economist at ihs global insight , said : &quot; the best thing you can do for the purchasing management index of the manufacturing business is in the euro zone from august .
he added : &apos; eurozone producers find life now quite difficult , as the current increase in geopolitical tensions - especially in terms of russia and ukraine - is uncertain about the remaining difficult conditions in many countries .
these increased uncertainties have clearly affected the economy - especially , and consumer confidence , and probably will result in some emerging orders being delayed or even cancelled .
he said that it would become &quot; increasingly likely &quot; that the ecb would eventually introduce a kind of qe , &quot; although we suspect that this would be limited . &quot;
the helldecade of beslan survivors : ten years have passed since the terrible siege of the school , as the people who drank it still suffer today .
ten years ago , more than 1,000 people were killed by chechen militias in a school in beslan in southern russia .
more than 330 people , more than half of them children , were killed in the three-day martyrdom that shocked the world .
we returned to beslan to visit some of the victims who were victims of the death of the atrocity in the classroom .
exactly a decade after the appalling siege of beslan &apos;s school , at which 334 people died , including 186 children , the heroic slaves warned the last night before a new apocalypse .
as fanatical islamist terrorists , children and parents were killed on 1 september 2004 , the beginning of a new school year , and they seemed like the evil guy of evil .
the tragedy united west and east in abhorrence , and turned into surprise .
ten years later , we returned to beslan to visit some of the victims who died in the greuel detention camp .
we found surprising young people who have overcome resistance , although the memory of this terrorist hell makes them persecuted forever .
their best hope ?
the fact that the war that is now waging ukraine - and in which children like them die - is now coming to an end .
the girl who was photographed in the attempt to enter the shoved school sports hall was forced to climb back into the school sports hall .
she was played by the russian star photographer dimitri beliakov and famous when she was only in her underwear to get into the shotted school sports hall .
aida was completely confused to search for her mother larissa , now 40 years old .
both were considered dead , but they survived .
&quot; a woman told me i should race for my life , but i could not , &quot; said aida then .
my legs were bloodshed .
i stood up and climbed back to my mother .
a soldier brought them to safety .
after a series of operations , she decided to be completely cured , but said yesterday : &quot; three months ago , the pain returned .
i fear that i will have to be reoperated .
some shards of granate are still in my knees .
their goal is to become a dentist to help people , as they have been helped by doctors .
&quot; this tragedy changed my life , but it did not break me , &quot; she says martial .
&quot; that happened to me , and that cannot be changed .
once a year i always go to the sports hall to remember those who were staying there .
my friends and i are trying not to talk about it on other days .
the pain is too great .
my best friend and future classmate dzera gapoeva was killed there .
we played together when we were small , dreaming of being together at school .
&quot; i don &apos;t want to marry until i finish my studies and start my career .
i am thinking of a family later .
it says that the siege must always remain part of it , although the memory is getting weaker every year .
i am glad that many people in the world remember our horrors and we are so grateful for the help we received from people in britain and everywhere .
when i see the photo online of me , how i climb back to school , i think that many people do see it for the first time , understand our disaster and contribute to that thing not happening again .
the boy who is fled by the ball hook , in the opinion that his mother was dead , was killed .
it was his first day of school ( russians go to school at 7 years ) and survived the three-day siege in the arms of his mother tamara .
as a seven-year-old , he said , &apos; mama told me that i should put myself in the lurch if there were an explosion and keep your hand &apos; .
after an explosion he thought she would die .
she said to him : &apos; run &apos; .
full of fear that she could be dead , he fled and saw a weeping little child on the way , took it at hand and fled through a ball hook .
his father vladimir , who had put his son outside into his arms , said : &apos; damir told me that his mother died .
he said : &apos; i could not save them &apos; .
in fact , tamara was stumbled outside and injured with leg injuries in the hospital , in turn assuming that her son had died .
after reunification , she said : &apos; i wept before joy .
i could not believe it .
he ran in and embraced me .
damir was later flown to london ( from the now dissolved news of the world ) to be replaced by the then premier tony blair and his wife cherie .
&quot; this horror is persecuting you every day , but i wish i could stop reminding , &quot; he said yesterday .
but i can say that it is blatant in my memory .
i know that i will be able to use all my toy guns immediately after that .
but now i can play computer games with shot scenes and that is no problem for me .
&quot; i am not afraid to go back to the sports hall , but i do not think about myself .
i remember these children with whom i played in the court , and who did not go out to see them .
we never say that they were killed or dead .
we say that they have stayed in the sports hall .
i remember very well my trip to london , especially the toy store , where i could choose everything .
but now he is afraid of the place like ukraine , where wars cause the kind of misfortune he and his friends suffered .
this horror is following you every day , but i wish i could stop thinking that .
&quot; i am so sorry for all those who suffer from the abominations , &quot; damir said , who was volunteer last week in a monastery .
i am happy to help .
i want to go to the police one day and hope that you will be able to take me to the school academy next year .
his mother tamara , 48 said : &quot; 37 children from our neighbourhood were killed , they can imagine that ?
i remember the terrible silence after the siege , there were simply no children who were calling and cheering .
she is vividly reminded of her trip to london with damir .
the people of london wept when i told our story .
i understood then how people on the other side of the world can understand our feelings and their support .
she was cherie blair and her foundation grateful for the prize and the opportunity to travel to london in the autumn of 2004 .
i wish i could call cherie and just tell her that 10 years have passed , but i always wonder what i was going to do for her and her husband in london , and how that damir and me helped .
i remember damir lovingly calling for borschtsch to eat and have all the local russian restaurants called .
i remember him talking to waiters in a restaurant , and damir was shooting with his water gun on them and they ran away and played with him .
and that was only a month after the horror .
i was surprised that the british were so willing to share our pain and supported us .
she said : &apos; i always think that this world has not improved in these 10 years .
in ukraine , the war is continuing and people are dying every day , and i believe that many children have been killed and still are being killed .
these are just such children as ours .
i think that for many of the war is part of the news you hear when you are bored or with something else .
i simply know what these people feel , the whole horror .
and i cannot stop feeling that .
nothing has changed , people still want to kill each other and that is so sad .
damir became big and is a very gentle and calm boy , he is not aggressive or angry at all .
for example , he is not looking for revenge , he is not overwhelmed by past abominations .
i know that he does not like to recall that , but he has six close friends from the class and they occasionally go to the sports hall and ignite candles there .
when he was smaller , he suffered - i remember he was sometimes on the sofa-bed that was the face of us , hours of sunshine .
not sleeping , his eyes were open .
i also remember him all his weapons and other military games .
i can hardly believe that i was so sure for a few hours that he was dead and i would never see him again .
when i recovered after the explosion and got on my feet , i looked around and saw the hell around me , with all around me , with body parts .
i was absolutely sure that my little boy in this hell could have survived .
&quot; i remember listening to him , &quot; i said , &quot; damir , run away , &quot; but i was also so sure that he could not hear me .
but he has heard it and he has gone away .
and thus life , unlike many others , continues for us .
georgij ilyin , 17
the boy whose terrible image after the siege to the symbol of the abominations of beslan was killed .
comfort : the beslan survivor georgij lyin with his mother fatima after the siege of 2004 , right a picture of georgij today , right a picture of georgij on the right .
his blood-exuberant face was frightened when he ran around his life , while chechen terrorists were destroying his classmates .
his image was one of the most shocking symbols of the barbarism of beslan .
his mother fatima , 54 , a doctor , had taken him to school for his first day before she rushed to give her elder son vladimir to university .
&quot; i left the court about two minutes before the terrorists stormed it , and so my little boy remained there for three terrible days alone , &quot; reminds me .
not quite alone , there was a whole family of relatives of us , but they were all killed .
only my georgij managed to survive .
the closer this date approaches , the more difficult it is to think about and talk about it .
there is not a single day on which we cannot remember this tragedy .
we do not think it has been a long time ago , i think it would have happened yesterday , some scenes from these days are watching me forever .
nobody will ever forget that , i promise you .
the picture of georgij ( left ) was one of the most shocking of the attack and was used as a statue ( right ) .
i remember that georgij was so happy to go to school on that day , he said he wanted to hug his teacher .
i knew that he was alive when i first saw him on television .
and now there is even this statue of the weeping georgij in san marino .
georgij does not like the picture , and it is in our home on the bookshelf .
i understand that , but i also think that people all over the world can feel our pain thanks to this image .
georgij says today : &apos; it is important that this never happens again .
&quot; i doubt that we will ever know the truth .
people are constantly investigating such tragedies and never learn the truth .
and now they are investigating the crash of this boeing in ukraine .
will we ever know what caused it ?
this world is becoming a bit terrible .
&quot; i can not understand how this is possible , because if you ask people , no one wants a war , so how is that done ?
ten years is nothing of such pain .
we need dozens of years to forget it a little .
it has attacked my health and i still feel it .
for about three or four years i had a few nightmares because of the siege , but then it became better .
i went to school later in 2004 and was afraid every day .
i thought to my friends and classmates who were killed .
that is why i always go to the sports hall when 1 september approaches .
i want to pay tribute to my old childhood friends .
it is difficult for me to go to the sports hall , but i must do it .
i do not feel like a victim , this story is now part of my past .
i will not forget it , but i am not sorry .
my life goes on .
i finished school this year and i visit a medical college in vladikawkaz .
i will become a heart surgeon .
my first choice was an army training .
i wanted to become a soldier , but my health didn &apos;t allow it .
i wanted to fight for my country , but that will not happen .
georgij faniyev , 20
the boy who survived , although he was at the foot of a murderous terrorist , was a man of peace and security .
a miracle : georgij faniyev was at the foot of a murderous terrorist while siege , but he managed to find a way to survive .
during the siege he was caught in the sports hall and sat next to the bomb which was at the foot of a murderous terrorist .
it is a real miracle that he was not killed .
&quot; we feel it was yesterday , &quot; says georgij , who was a secret service officer of the fsb , but this because of his health damage due to the siege , could not do so .
it is still with me , it is not something i have left behind .
i am now older and people say that children can easily handle bad experiences - i have to say that is not true .
&quot; in 2006 i worked with psychologists and then felt a little better , but i can not forget it .
and i would like to forget .
2005 - in the year after - was the first and only time that i went back to the sports hall .
i lost consciousness .
i will never return to that country again and please do not ask me to show you where i have sat in this famous picture .
survivors : georgij faniyev today , with a photo of himself in hospital after the siege on the laptop .
my pain is monstrous and i wear it every day .
my friends know that i do not like to think about it or talk about it , and they never asked me about school .
i am physically well off .
i should be careful with my wounded knee , but i can now run well .
but because of my health , i could not attend the fsb secret service academy in saint petersburg , as i wanted .
i have my documents , including the medical ones , and you have replied that it is not possible .
my second passion was the animals , so i went to the veterinary institute .
i have been there for two years .
he learns the treatment of all animals &quot; from cats to cows &quot; .
he said : &apos; i knew that i would never tell my children of my experiences .
children should not know about this and they should not , of course , suffer it .
his mother marina , 42 , said : &quot; this pain never leaves me .
he is worse in my soul when the anniversary approaches .
i will be commemorating the celebrations .
i know that georgij will not go there .
he still needs to be much more violent because he was there and i did not .
i waited at home and could not help .
i am so grateful to god that he has been returned to me , and here in beslan , all of them are drawn .
it remains in us .
georgij is now an adult , but this horror is still in him .
it is difficult to accept this when something so unfair is being met .
he is a boy , he likes sport , but he cannot participate because of his knees .
he has been operated on several occasions , but he can not do any sport .
i would say that he has reduced the horror to 50 % , but it is never entirely possible to overcome it and forget it .
this terrible experience will always follow us .
many friends and neighbours were killed during the siege and this only aggravated my pain .
i have lost many people i knew well and which were expensive to me .
my son is with me , and this is the greatest gift that god could make me , but my heart wears to the slain .
i know of families where new children were born , but also widows who have never been married again .
it is hard to accept that life goes on , even if you do not want it .
i will never forget how my heart jumped in me when i saw him in the hospital .
and now i see what is happening in the world - wars in other regions .
what are these people fighting for ?
why are they killing each other ?
the war is now very close to our country and i almost cannot believe it .
we used to be a friendly country , how can it be that we are now fighting ?
people and children are suffering , i am sure that many children have already been killed in ukraine and many are still killed .
if we only use and throw out all these rebels - as far as possible .
aljona tskajewa , 10 minutes from the beach .
the baby that is so touching by a special command in safety is not only a baby , but also a baby , which is worn in safety by a special operation command .
saved : aljona tskajewa is killed by a russian special intervention command ( left ) .
it is now ten ( right ) and does not remember the atrocities of the past .
the world was breathing in 2004 when the baby aljona was born in the arms of a russian policeman from the beslan siege .
the terrorists left them , but kept their 30-year-old mother , the 10-year-old sister kristina and her brother makhar in school sports hall in their cruelty .
makhar , at that time three years old , escaped , but aljonas ’ mother and sister died in the murderous slaughter .
her father ruslan has since married again and has with his new wife swetlana a a little girl that he had to leave after his lost daughter kristina .
aljona , now ten years old , does not remember the siege and has become an intelligent and happy girl , say neighbors .
&quot; you are now a great happy family and aljona and makhar are both great children , &quot; says a close friend .
ruslan is a fantastic father and wants to give you all the memories that come with the tenth anniversary .
you will understand why .

4 tips for better underwater photos and videos .
if you like to take photos or videos under water , there is a selection of devices .
the most affordable option is a waterproof point-and-shoot , like the nikon coolpix aw120 or a active-card .
i took these photos at a family festival with several cameras , all at a price of less than $ 350 .
regardless of the equipment , there are some rules for the best results .
check your equipment twice .
even if you have a waterproof camera , make sure that the battery is not too hot and does not burn .
put your camera on the photos or videos you want to record .
some cameras and camcorders have scene and recording modes that allow the camera to be exposed to the dusk and dampened submerged conditions .
and before you jump in , check to what depth your equipment is functional .
some cameras are only allowed for up to 5 feet , others up to 50 or 60 feet .
search our shopping guide and the reviews for digital cameras for conventional and waterproof models .
do multiple recordings - because many will not work .
point-and-shoot cameras have an lcd that lets you compress images .
even if you have an lcd , it is difficult to see this under water and the right image setting is a lucky matter .
so you make many pictures .
if your camera has a row mode that allows you to capture a series of images with slightly changed exposure settings , use it .
stay close to the surface .
the light is dramatically worse as it moves away from the surface .
so if possible they stay close to the surface when you take pictures in a pool , a lake or the sea .
this allows you to bring more color to your photos ; the deeper you go , the less color you will see .
go close to the objects .
this is also good advice on land , but it is all the more important under water because of poor lighting conditions .
it is particularly important that you are connected to an action cam : these devices often have a fixed wide angle lens , which means that the camera can be poetically aligned to your objects when they are connected to the entire frame .
andrew lawson was a man of the variety whose character changed things even in such a gigantic organization as the nhs .
as an advisory anaesthesia doctor , he devoted his career to helping patients both face agony and to the disease .
among his patients , his wife remembers , was a mi6 employee who was confronted with the devastating effects of torture .
lawson knew that doctors would be better served by diagnosis and disease , while treatment was more often associated with something completely different .
one day in 2007 , however , he was the person whose path began .
&quot; i did not feel like it , &quot; he wrote in may of this year .
i had difficulty getting up .
while he was dealing with influenza symptoms , he noticed that he was giving his wife juliet impatiently reproach .
&quot; i want everything to be done immediately rather than later &quot; , he noted .
as juliet spent a week on a business trip , lawson felt very unusually and without reason worried .
something was in the air .
he asked a colleague to carry out an x-ray inspection of his breast .
only two weeks ago he was in the french alps for skiing .
the results of the x-ray inspection were available .
he suffered from mesotheliom , an incurable cancer that caused the breast fur , that is , the skin overflowing with the lungs .
as with most cancers , the exact cause is usually difficult to determine .
for example , while some smokers are suffering from lung cancer , not all lung cancer patients have been smokers earlier .
but mesotheliom is different .
in almost all cases , the trigger is an asbestos load - contact with the fibre which was once considered a &quot; miracle &quot; but has since been recognized as lethal .
for most of us mesotheliom is a disease that can easily be ignored .
asbestos is , after all , a product of the past .
the most dangerous asbestos type has not been used in britain since the 1960s , when the industry voluntarily committed to stop using it .
even where it was still in use , only people in certain sectors worked directly with the fabric - plumber , construction workers , carpenters and shipyard workers , for example .
as an industrial hazardous material from another era , it seems that it is hardly worrying today .
but this complacency is inappropriate .
britain , it seems , is experiencing the culmination of a mesotheliom epidemic today .
there are more mesothelioma deaths here than anywhere else in the world .
with a total of 2,500 deaths per year , twice as many people die of this disease as in road accidents .
annual figures of mesothelium deaths since 1980 and expected future deaths in the uk are estimated to be around 10 % of the year in the uk .
the reason why we are now seeing the deadly effects , when asbestos has been illegal for years ( in 1999 all asbestos types were banned ) is that a mesothelium only develops after decades .
and the scourge of the mesothelium is not limited to former workers in the construction industry .
asbestos was , and is still often present , in the houses we live in , the offices in which we work , the schools where we learn and the shops in which we shop .
and therefore mesotheliom does not know any class barriers , financial limits , professions or age .
the privileged bastions , from the elegant department stores in london to private schools , are not a protective area .
parliament &apos;s buildings are contaminated with asbestos .
in hospitals too , where we are supposed to be healthy , we are already starting out from this deadly carcinogens .
andrew lawson was not old .
he was not a plumber either .
he was indeed hard to imagine that he would be able to deal with asbestos .
then he found it out .
&quot; it looks as if the tunnels on the guy &apos;s hospital. where i have spent six years training , there are many more .
all - students , nurses , doctors and parish - use the tunnels .
one wonders how many of my contemporaries will suffer from the same illness ?
unfortunately , he was able to answer this question at least in part .
&quot; of the four doctors who participated in the guy &apos;s hospital , and who were in the last five years to mesotheliom , &quot; he wrote .
how many of us will still be sick ?
andrew lawson was born in mesotheliom at the age of 48 .
when he died on 17 february this year , he was 55 .
this was an unusually long survival time .
fifty percent of all mesotheliosiacal diseases die within 8 months of diagnosis .
the disease always ends up fatal .
we can therefore only repeat the question of lawson : &apos; how many of us will still be sick ? &apos;
britain &apos;s leading expert on mesotheliom , professor julian peto , assumes that between 1870 and 2050 , when asbestopids were in the uk , it is expected that they will come to a halt .
most of them have no idea at the moment that they will die .

a quick look at the files of the courts , to which the parties concerned often apply for compensation , shows how far the scourge of the mesotheliom is already spread .
in june of this year , for example , marks &amp; spencer admitted that janice was negligently exposed to asbestos .
she worked for nine years for the chain , from 1978 to 1987 , and was responsible for the clothing department at two locations - one of them the flagship store in oxford street .
mrs. allen was only 18 years when she started her business at m &amp; s .
now she has two children in the twenties .
&quot; before this thing , &quot; she says , &quot; i had never heard of mesotheliom , i didn &apos;t even know anything about asbestos .
i never thought that would affect me .
there are few people who know a lot about asbestos .
the fact is that the term asbestos is not a substance , but a group of six minerals .
the name derives from the word &quot; asbesto-style &quot; , a description of the fibre structure that makes the fabric resistant and flexible .
three of the six were used in the construction industry .
chrysotile , also known as white asbestos , is by far the most common asbestos in buildings today .
it has been designed for roof tiles , floor tiles , rohs insulation , boiler insulation , even for brake pads in cars .
it is less fatal than other forms of asbestos , but it is nevertheless described by the eu and the who as a &apos; great health risk &apos; with possible death .
but the brown asbestos ( amosite ) and blue asbestos ( krokydolith ) are more dangerous .
britain was once the world ’ s largest importer of brown asbestos , and experts suspect that &apos; there are clear but indirect indications that this is a major reason for the uniquely high mesothelium rates &apos; .
a staff member at marks &amp; spencer was trained in the flagship store in oxford street , london , asbestos exposed alamy alamy .
janice allen may not have been a typical mesotheliomopper , but julian peto debuted in his work to suggest that her story is not uncommon .
he has presented a study of the stakeholders , which shows that &apos; a significant proportion of mesotheliomas are produced without a known suspension by work or in the house probably due to asbestos contact in the environment &apos; .
much of these contacts , according to him , are based on the &quot; normal use and aging &quot; of our buildings .
it looks as if no one can be sure .
a report by goddard consulting , which describes the palace of westminster , shows how people can live in the heart of the government , unknowingly exposed to the substance .
in 2009 , goddard reported that service packs and pipes behind the compartments of parliament were contaminated with asbestos , whose deadly fibres were destroyed by something as harmless as &apos; strong air movements &apos; .
members of parliament are often accused of striving for their own interests , but it seems that dreaming of the opposite is the case .
while the management of the parliamentary labour force insisted that the westminster palace be a &apos; clean health certificate &apos; , it is now indisputable that 1 billion people spend on work on several years .
the goddard report also pointed out that &apos; the existence of asbestos is not regulated in accordance with the relevant provisions &apos; .
no one can know whether this mismanagement will cost lives .
all that can be done now is waiting .
a person who has never exactly determined contact with asbestos is graham abbott , a general medical practitioner .
as andrew lawson suspects , the 50-year-old abbott is suspected of having been exposed to asbestos during his work in hospitals .
&quot; i worked in a hospital where asbestos complaints were positively decided , &quot; he says , &quot; but i can &apos;t prove it in my case .
it is so difficult to remember all the places where work has been done and the data .
what he remembers is the day at the beginning of december 2009 , when he was holding such a fever .
he was 45 , and was carrying out an operation just late in the evening .
suddenly i had a shaking frost .
it all suddenly happened .
i felt terrible .
i thought that the journey home was no longer possible .
as a doctor , abbott knew that the pain from the chest coat , the skin around his lungs , was stirring up .
but , like janice allen , he had no reason to suspect a mesotheliom .
he did not go to work for a month .
curious doctors made x-ray recordings of his breast and put pleurakathether in order to remove fluid from the lungs and test it in the laboratory .
his complaints , however , remained without diagnosis .
his health was slowly improving and he returned to work .
from time to time , however , the symptoms returned , often after sporting activity and intense attack .
in 2011 , a patient abbott with similar symptoms came to his practice and was later diagnosed with mesotheliom .
but even now , abbott did not associate this with his own case .
after all , his patient was several decades older and had worked directly with asbestos .
the connection in the case was clear .
in september 2011 , abbott ’ s condition deteriorated again , and his family doctor brought his ct scans and x-ray shots to a group of experts .
in december 2011 , exactly two years after abbott first became ill , he was resigned to a camera equipped sonde in the cave between the rib and the sea .
i am an optimist .
i usually continue , &quot; he says .
to be honest , i did not have so many concerns .
but rachel , my wife , was worried .
the result of the biopsy was a week between christmas and new year : &quot; i was told that there was mesotheliom . &quot;
graham abbott : diagnosis mesotheliom
suddenly , abbott had appointments with macmillan nurses , of whom one recommended that he should seek a lawyer .
only now did he understand the scale of the epidemic .
&quot; it turned out that asbestos was very common , especially in large public buildings where pipes are often insulated with asbestos , &quot; he says .
the people who have been exposed to asbestos in these buildings are now sick .
and so mesotheliom is now meeting younger people who have not worked in the typical professions .
the most dangerous pipes with asbestos insulation in hospitals were located below the earth , so patients were probably not exposed to the substance .
but many employees who work in pedestrian tunnels from one building to another ( like andrew lawson ) or in underground tunnels , are not allowed to work .
it is evident that , over several decades after the war , hospitals may have been life-saving for patients , but life-threatening for the doctors involved .
it is still being removed today .
students put their bunscape burners on asbestos mats .
it does not just concern hospitals .
asbestos was developed for the production of the most modern , highly isolated and flame retardant materials in offices , shops , libraries and town halls .
schools too .
indeed , many people probably have the first contact with asbestos in the classroom .
throughout the country , thousands of chemical lessons , students have their bunch burners on asbestos mats .
on websites , the theme asbestos is often raised in schools .
meanwhile , innocent objects in our homes , such as floor tiles or dandruff sacks , have asbestos by default .
&quot; it is an industrial poison that is contained in large parts of our properties , &quot; says andrew morgan , the lawyer who is andrew lawson in his trial against guy &apos;s hospital .
in one case , the only contact that occurred to a woman concerned was the demolition of a gardening scalp in the 1970s .
so make sure you have your gardening shed cut off .
the impact of diagnosis , and the knowledge that the disease is incurable , is immense .
&quot; it takes a while to process it , &quot; says graham abbott .
i went back to work and tried to continue , but i realized that i could not concentrate on what i was doing .
i was in practice for two weeks .
then i knew that i would go and take care of myself .
well , i will not see another christmas .
the most difficult thing was the change of perspective from the position of a doctor to that of a patient .
like countless patients before him , he remembers how overwhelmed he is by all the information he has rightly received .
&quot; it was very difficult to record all this , &quot; he says .
&quot; i asked my doctor &quot; how long do i still have ? &quot;
and i was given about 12 months .
i remember thinking that &quot; na ja , i &apos;ll not have another christmas day , but i &apos;ll be there again .
that was then &apos; .
mesotheliom is particularly insidious because it is our life-saving mechanism - breathing itself - that is caused by fatal cancer .
most mesothelioma cases are caused by asbestos contact .
asbestos consists of smallest fibres .
if asbestos is burnt and fibres are inhaled , they can be absorbed in the chest coat , the skin around the lungs .
asbestos fibers irritate the chest coat and may cause cell mutations .
&quot; the problem arises from the inhaled needle-shaped asbestos fibers , &quot; says professor tom treasure , a heart / thorax doctor who passed to the guy &apos;s hospital in 2001 .
the hospital andrew lawson suspected of having been in prison for asbestos is now mistaken .
treasure knew lawson and treated some other , who probably also had to be in hospital during their training in hospital .
once the asbestos needles reach the lung tissue , says treasure , &quot; will they be sent from the breathing process to the edge where the skin is .
it is inherently invasive from the beginning .
the usual options for other cancers work in mesotheliom not so good .
the effectiveness of an operation , for example , is highly controversial .
some say that it is worth trying .
treasure denies that .
&quot; you can &apos;t cut the chest coat , &quot; he says .
you don &apos;t get around with the knife .
meanwhile , cancer speaks &quot; on chemotherapy not very good , &quot; the &quot; effect &quot; , but not heals .
&quot; sometimes there are long-term survivors , &quot; says treasure .
but in the end they all die .
fortunately , some patients actually live long , much longer than expected .
the author stephen jay gould died 20 years after the diagnosis .
two and a half years after his own diagnosis , graham abbott is still struggling .
after contacting mesotheliom , abbott came into contact with andrew lawson , who was diagnosed with a one-man support and remedial consulting office for co-affected persons four years after his diagnosis .
&quot; hello , cancer center , &quot; he asked himself about calls happily .
&quot; he was very positive , &quot; says abbott .
he had received his diagnosis 4 years earlier and was still very active .
originally , abbott had six chemotherapy cycles , which lasted four months and would probably only last for one month .
&quot; i was desperate , &quot; he says .
i wanted to give up .
however , lawson managed to &apos; do things in a somewhat more positive light . &apos;
after consulting several doctors , abbott decided to continue his treatment with prof. loic lang-lazdunski , heart / thorax specialist at guy &apos;s .
&quot; we had an advantage by not having to be forwarded , i just called on and got a date , &quot; says graham .
a normal patient would have to be refunded and wait for the treatment to be approved .
money is crucial to mesotheliom sufferers to obtain the best available therapies .
but when these treatments inevitably fail , they are often the cause of a different financial concern - over and above the future of families they are leaving .
and so they turn to the courts in the hope of compensation .
andrew lawson contacted andrew morgan of field fisher waterhouse llp .
&quot; it is known since 1898 that asbestos is extremely dangerous for health , &quot; says morgan .
but what changed in the 1960 ’ s is that it was recognized that a very small burden would also present a health risk .
and here , the negligence of companies began to play a role .
andrew lawson and guy &apos;s hospital put their case in the end , but it was not what morgan called a &quot; full compensation . &quot;
after the investigation into his death , a guy &apos;s spokesman confirmed that &quot; asbestos fibres in the cellar area affected in the 1990s were removed &quot; .
this was a late occasion for andrew lawson .
how asbestos can be removed
indeed , mesotheliom sufferers who seek compensation are a huge problem .
many of their former employers have been sold or closed .
insurance documents can be lost .
and those who oppose claims know that the time for them is to do so , but certainly not with the plaintiffs .
in response to this , there have been clear new legislation this year , which allows for the easier access to a compensation for mesotheliom sufferers , even if their former employers are no longer found .
the law has created a market fund of 350 million £ for all supported by the insurance industry , which is diagnosed after july 2012 , a contact which is not a guarantee to anyone .
in these cases , the plaintiffs receive 80 % of what a court can do in a normal compensation process - about 120,000 £ .
about 300 successful applications for the programme are expected each year .
andrew morgan thinks like so many mesotheliom sufferers that £ 350 million is a &quot; very good work &quot; of the insurance industry .
&quot; this is a deal of insurers for insurers , &quot; he says , and suggests that the insurance is a sum of one quarter of what insurers would have to pay if the time had not been overtaken .
mike penning , the former labour and pension minister , also admitted that the law &quot; is not perfect &quot; .
but both penning and morgan admitted that , with seven deaths a fast and rapid response was needed every day .
&quot; people are suffering so much and need help today , &quot; said penning during the second hearing of the mesotheliom law in december of last year .
at that time , graham abbott had been in the hands of professor loic lang-lazdunski for 19 months .
after their initial consultation , lang-lazdunski recommended an operation which , unlike tom treadurie , had a positive effect .
this was done by a radiation therapy and chemotherapy - a triple therapy , which has been used to treat long lazdunski a survival rate of up to 40 % over five years .
abbott felt strengthened .
&quot; this is of course the most important thing , &quot; says abbott .
this is seen time and again in patients .
there is something that lets you continue .
when you give up , you will get worse very quickly .
graham abbott was the president of the operation in march 2012 .
at the end of august , he had the last of the six chemotherapy cycles .
after-care scanners showed no signs of disease .
then i had a scan in march 2014 .
there were several cancer spots around my chest .
i was just 50 .
this is not life-threatening .
that is a life-ending exercise .
again , abbott underwent six chemotherapy cycles .
there is no trace of the tumours left .
but the process is physical and psychological very strenuous .
they must think about practical things - about the money , if i am no longer , for example , or my wife , how the boiler time setting works .
if you receive bad news , you will be negative .
they must look forward .
as ellie &apos;s father , 16 , and tamsin , 14 , this is not always easy .
&quot; for parents , that is difficult , &quot; he says .
it is hard to know what to say and how much .
when i was diagnosed first , i told my girls that i had a disease i didn &apos;t want to get old .
they reacted in very different ways .
tamsin is very sociable and imbued .
she told her friends and soon we got a lot of calls .
ellie was more restrained .
she did not say much .
such talks are something that all cancer patients must perceive .
but for mesotheliocarbons , such talks are not driven by hope , not by a trace of hope for survival .
the disease ( as well as stephen jay gould ) brings a grim security .
as andrew morgan says , &quot; mesotheliom is not life-threatening .

china is refusing hong kong to be elected in government , demonstrators swear retaliation , and the chinese are reluctant to retaliate .
on sunday , despite the increased calls for democratic reform , the chinese parliament decided against nominating candidates for the 2017 elections by the hong kong electorate .
this is probably the reason why protests in hong kong have been announced for so long , while activists have been delaying planning and mobilization within a few hours of the announcement .
the decision of the chinese people ’ s congress allows communist leaders to ban all non-beijing candidates in principle .
&quot; this is not unexpected , but it makes us angry , &quot; said legal expert emily lau , chairman of the democratic party .
that is not what beijing promised .
the people of hong kong have been lied to .
and it is clear that we are dealing with an authoritarian regime .
in his defense of china ’ s decision , li fei , vice secretary-general of the standing committee of the national people ’ s congress , said that the approval of public nominations in the elections to the hong kong government would be too &apos; chaotic &apos; .
since 1997 , when britain lost control of hong kong to the chinese , beijing has promised to repatriate the chinese from 2017 .
china ’ s leaders presented sunday ’ s decision as a democratic breakthrough , because it offered hong kong ’ s citizens direct voting rights , but the decision also makes it clear that china ’ s leaders are changing the process through a narrowly controlled beijing tea .
a new clause also states that candidates should only be &apos; with love for the country and love for hong kong &apos; .
the decision follows a summer in which some of the largest and most public-sphere protests in hong kong have been taking place for several years .
behind hong kong &apos;s pro-democracy campaign , the occupy central movement with love and peace is standing , whose organizers have threatened to dismiss the financial district .
on sunday evening , within a few hours of the announcement , hundreds of occupants had been forced to flee the revolt in the rain outside the government headquarters in hong kong .
the demonstration was attended by the organizers saying that their movement would lead to a new level of civil disobedience and that they would have planned protest waves in the coming weeks .
they did not provide any further information , however , apparently to avoid problems with the authorities .
in an online communication , the organizers announced that the movement &quot; the occupation of the central district was only a last resort .
we are sorry to have to say that all the opportunities for dialogue have been exhausted today and that the occupation of the central district will definitely take place .
the hong kong authorities have been preparing for the beijing announcement for days , and g8 was scheduled to take place on sunday .
the disturbances are caused by the feeling of many in hong kong that they are slowly losing control of their city .
the migration of people from the mainland is increasing competition for products and services .
there is also growing fear that hong kong &apos;s values , such as democracy and freedom of speech , will become brooked under growing pressure from beijing .
some criticized the demonstrations of the occupy central movement , as they were destroying business operations - hong kong &apos;s lifeline .
&quot; the protests they are talking about could cause great economic damage , depending on how many are involved and how long they last , &quot; said law-experts .
we do not want to raise fears that hong kong will get out of control .
this impression is bad for investment .
china ’ s state-controlled media recently reported about the democratically elected activists in hong kong as being led by western powers .
this summer , activists organised an unofficial referendum on electoral rights , involving 780,000 people .
in july , tens of thousands participated in one of the largest democratic demonstrations in the region ’ s history .
the tradition of the school graduate balls in the us is now transferred to universities , where freshmen perform on private aircraft .
we are pleased to respond to this demand and to offer the first luxury travel service in britain for students of today .
to make a particularly impressive appearance at the university , the company also offers transport options such as private aircraft , rolls-royce phantom , aston marten or mclaren p1 .
mr stewart also said that the service has a security section .
this service is an ideal alternative for students who otherwise want to improve their habits in a dangerously overloaded car .
together with our new vif options , we look forward to this year ensuring that students can start the university with a minimum of effort and maximum level of luxury .
a company spokesman said that no new bookings are available , as the service has just been introduced , added a new bookings to the list of &quot; students who will book the service in the next few weeks &quot; .
the company also announced that , despite the tuition fees of £ 9,000 per year , there was a market for this offer .
students today differ in their expectations and expectations from those of 10 , 20 , 30 or 40 years ago - it is more important than ever to make a great first impression , and with vif you can do just that .
the national student union , however , criticised the service as being absent .
megan dunn , vice president of the nus for higher education said : &quot; this offer seems to be completely separate from the lives of the majority of students .
many students who start studying this month are facing a crisis of living costs , as the available financial assistance in the form of loans and grants is not available with the very rising levels of bills for the simplest living conditions .
feminists criticize racial issues and police behavior in ferguson
the unarmed teenager was killed by a police officer in ferguson , mo at the beginning of this month .
the participants lifted their hands into the air and sang , &quot; hands high , not shoot , &quot; while waiting before the funeral .
after two weeks of protests in ferguson , mo , due to the shooting of the unarmed teenager michael brown , the blogger miriam zoila perez noticed a change in the game .
in their experience , white feminist commentators put the gender before the race when it comes to reproductive law and income inequality .
but , as tensions in the middle west rose and received attention throughout the country , perez saw that white women ’ s answers were 100 % racial .
compared to the answers given by black women shortly after the shots of 9 august , personal essays with titles such as &quot; thoughts to ferguson by a white woman &quot; and &quot; feminism is not only about the women .
but for perez , that meant an important change .
&quot; i do not think that feminism can find many people who know what and have privileges in such a high class way , &quot; she said .
people felt urged to do something about the events .
it is characteristic of the crisis we are experiencing and because the situation in ferguson is so ethnicized that it must be expressed .
for the lecturer , koritha mitchell , from ohio state university , ferguson brought to light problems to which black american women are exposed every day but are not considered women &apos;s issues .
&quot; i can do something fun on facebook about me and my partner and get 150 likes from anywhere , &quot; said mitchell .
if i post something about how colored in your own country are under siege , silence is ear-looking .
&quot; how can women be sure to talk publicly about a relationship , but not about public security ? &quot; asked her .
for black women like mitchell , the race , sex and sexuality in the history of the us , there is no dichotomy between race and sex .
for them , black women have not had the luxury of dividing the topics neatly ; they live every day in the combined reality .
while white women are now discussing race and gender issues in the feminist mainstream , the german chancellor angela hattery says that women and gender issues should be addressed .
&quot; between 1865 and 1890 at least 10,000 black men were gelyncht and the rape of a white woman , &quot; said hattery .
white women had to be involved in history to prevent lynchmurders .
for hattery , the division between white and black women came at the point where white fighters were fighting for women ’ s electoral law , such as susan b. anthony , and the country in the late nineteenth century .
&quot; they decided to opt for women &apos;s electoral law , and the right to vote for black should come later , &quot; said hattery .
when you remember such things , you are powerfully aware of why colored women do not trust white women .
we did not do our job well .
we have never helped black women to find their husbands and sons .
even after women were given the right to vote in 1920 , it took another decade for white women to fight the lynch in the association of southern women .
the group was created almost 40 years after the original request for help from black women , says mitchell .
for mitchell , the flood of white feminist responses to the concerns raised by ferguson - police behaviour , racial discrimination - is a reflection of the time when white feminists &apos; catch &apos; .
&quot; would it not be great if the activists who have such traditional feminist platforms had the right to raise a child as seriously as they would be ?
second generation feminists who want to continue their career in the struggle for reproduction rights and access to contraceptive means are now looking for a new way of understanding what that means .
the well-known white feminist activist gloria steiner went to the united states two weeks after michael brown ’ s shooting and released a poinert article from rebec .
&quot; i hope that women who have a different but parallel reason to take a position inherent to the body will understand - and opinions on the race , the body is in public opinion polls , are significantly different - the changes will lead to .
although steiner is in favour of a rather intersectional feminism , in which racial as well as gender issues are addressed , some of her comments on racial issues in america are astounding .
christina sommer , researcher at the american enterprise institute and author of who stole feminism ? , said to her that she is the best young men in the united states , especially young farbis .
there are now hundreds of special programmes for girls and young women , but almost nothing for boys .
but when the white house recently launched a small program , my brother &apos;s keeper , to protect vulnerable young black and heat spanish men .
the police relationship with the black community is not the only problem that has come to the fore in mainstream feminism .
after the us border police have carried out nearly 63,000 unaccompanied minors on the southwest border of the country this year , the issue of immigration reform is also returning to the surface - this time as a women &apos;s issue .
andrea mercado , co-chairman of we belong together , an organization that provides women with a role in immigration reform , said that a new dimension is needed to reconsider the issue as a major women ’ s issue .
&quot; they speak for themselves , &quot; said mercado .
if the vast majority of work visas to male immigrants go , women , who are accompanied by them , are in a position where they are considered to be responsible for domestic violence and exploitation .
&quot; these stories find a lasting presence in women &apos;s organisations , &quot; she said .
&quot; piggy house &quot; in ipswich is for sale in the netherlands .
the image of a house for sale has been removed by real estate agents when it became clear that it was a big pig that it could easily be made in the living room .
the detached house has one bedroom , located on a private road in ipswich and is offered for £ 120,000 .
details included an image of the living room of the house - including a pig , a pork that had his head on a sofa - and the details of the room .
real estate broker connells said that the pig in the photo is the pet of the owner .
&quot; the photo was , however , wrongly published and has since been removed &quot; said a spokesperson of the company .
the expoé of the house described the former meeting room of the former congregation as a &quot; unique one-family house with one bedroom &quot; .
although the broker may have removed the image from the website , it still appears on advertising material .
the sale of homes has been of interest to the social media when some asked whether the pig was included in the purchase price .
the sw city harvey is home to a new million dollar lottery after lottery win .
a harvey lottery will be released this month .
the search for a new millionaire in the southwest of perth continues , with a happy winner who has left the lottery drawing on saturday almost $ 1.1 million .
a newspaper kiosk in harvey moved to the jack bar for the second time in five years .
the lucky winner must still report .
the store owner steve forward said that winning is a concern for talking in the small town in the southwest of perth .
the city is talking about nothing else , and everyone is pretty excited .
we thought that such a profit could occur .
eight wa winners won prizes last month in the first division , a prize winner of the first few lucky weeks for the players in the state .
last week , a canning vale player was killed in the first two months of august after a couple of belmont couples left the mega-winning of 7.5 million dollars .
the winning pair had played for twenty years and said that the profit allowed them to travel the world and buy a new home .
the millionaire from harvey is the 59th winner of the first division in the wa this year , with a total of almost $ 85 million .
leonidas asked for the gladiatorial arena to be opened .
not only the gladiators were ankle deep in the matsch at the first römertag in the leisure park .
but the attraction of the event was strong enough to attract more than 1000 visitors yesterday , who were watching the rain showers and the autumn cold defy and were able to enjoy the historic spectacle .
there was a colorful range of representations , performances , games , exhibits and information about the time of the romans and their importance for the rhineland .
the main attraction of the day was undoubtedly the martialist fighter force from the gladiatorial school &quot; amor mortis &quot; , which took every rainy break to the stage in which with soft sand preparation was applied .
gladiator owner &quot; leonidas &quot; proved to be a humorous and expert presentation .
first , the provocateurs were on the line with rectangular shield and short sword , and legs on the left leg and arm rail on the right arm .
the &quot; essedarii &quot; followed with breast shield , short sword and throwing lance , and iron gladiator helmet , leg and arm protection .
the performance of the &quot; retiarius &quot; , which was accompanied by a throwing net , a triple and a dolch against the &quot; secutor &quot; , was particularly impressive and the bursese came to the ground after a short fight .
as swords are scratching to each other , the schapperten shields and the turf lances flown surrender through the arena that gives a fear and blow to the health of the gladians .
but the imposing &quot; summa rudius &quot; , which had a muscular referee , had always been a attentive eye .
&quot; we wanted to revive everyday roman life and to revive the culture of the roman era , &quot; lorenz euskirchen , chairman of the organizer &quot; freundeskreis römer kanal &quot; , explained .
after two years of preparation , the theme park became an oppidum romanum for one day , a roman town , as vice mayor claus wrehage said in his greeting .
after all , the romans have not only brought war and conquest to our region , but also the roman culture and numerous buildings that we still admire today .
the remains of these were also to be seen at the roman day , such as &quot; aqueduct marble &quot; by the eleven meter high and 1400 meter long roman canal bridge , which was once built by lüftelberg .
the frontinus society provided the water and energy supply once and now , and managing director petra fricke knew : &quot; we are still using the knowledge of those days &quot; .
this is confirmed by the diploma surveyor ralph heiliger of the &quot; engineer team two &quot; from rheinbach , the measuring instruments of the romans such as chorobat , groma or dioppe .
the romanesque villa in blankenheim presented sketches and models of excavations anno 1894 and bricks from the original hypocaucasian , the warm air heater , which once served as the home of the world .
the foot imprint , which is used by wolf and fuchs two millennia ago in the footsteps of sound , before the foot prints burned .
in 2011 , the office for landmark conservation had the overtones of a roman villa in the industrial park nord in rhinbach .
you have seen the walls of an economic building with a darre to dry grain and to mill .
the building probably had to be converted to a villa rustica , an agricultural property , explained the archaeologist dr. jennifer morscheiser .
a number of finds from these excavations were made in a glass display , including a large tent , several flower glass vessels and a part of a delicate neck .
the villa was probably built from the first to the fourth century ad to christ , until the germans arrived in the then roman rhineland .
the children also engaged in the roman windmill game , similar to the mill game of today , or they wrote as the roman times did their names with metal grips on wax boards .
at the booth of the roman thermal baths zülpich the children were allowed to put their own mosaics , at the stand of the glass museum rheinbach glass mosaics and at the stand of the nature centre eifel nettersheim .
with the “ chill-out ” of two cold flowers , the original roman trolleybus trucks were used to transport visitors through the leisure park and also came to the impressive stadium of the city gymnasium .
the first one was a week of roman studies from 13 to 21 september , and the town of wachtberg will also be entering the rhineland roman year 2014 , which was reminiscent of the death of emperor augustus 2000 years ago .
together with the national and historical associations and the wachtberger wander-verein , the partnership association and the amanienspielkreis oberbachem will be presenting thematic hikes , lectures and cooking evenings .
for example , a roman legionnaire is being deviated from his work on the zug wachtberg , plants are being cultivated as living monuments from the roman era and a funny lesson in international understanding .
the adendorfer elementary school is dedicated to the romans in a project week .
the roman week is intended to bring together the many , but often no longer visible , traces of the romans in wachtberg .
the wachtberger rathaus offers a small presentation to the find of the berkumer matron sanctuary in 1879 .
ebola : the epidemic is burdening west africa ’ s economy
the ebola epidemic in west africa is also a serious blow to the economy .
markets are orphaned - and international companies are distancing themselves .
the devastating ebola epidemic is giving western africa &apos;s economy a heavy blow .
the harvest rotates in the fields , the mines are abandoned and the markets orphaned - the virus has inflicted severe damage on the region .
some international companies are also already distancing themselves .
&quot; the ebola epidemic is not only a medical crisis , but also an economic one , &quot; the head of the african development bank , donald kaberuka , judged .
liberia is the hardest hit .
&quot; it is a total disaster , we lose a lot of money , &quot; says alhaji bamogo , who is the second largest market in liberia &apos;s capital , monrovia &apos;s clothing .
the only thing that comes onto the market is who can supply food or something for disinfection against ebola .
liberia is hardest hit by the virus , but here alone the fever fell more than 600 people .
recently , health agencies said that the disease was spread to every corner of the country .
in guinea , sierra leone and nigeria , too , the virus has spread .
in total , more than 1500 people died , thousands more were infected .
foreign companies attract employees
across resource-rich countries , companies are setting up their operations .
foreign companies such as the steel company arcelor mittal are attracting their employees , several international airlines are no longer flying to the affected regions .
local traders and farmers are also reacting : few merchants are still leaving their homes to buy back .
in some areas of sierra leone and liberia , which are quarantine , there are the most dangerous areas for exports , such as cocoa and coffee beans .
farmers dare not pay for the harvest .
food is scarce
&quot; people will travel less and less &quot; , says phillipe de vreyer , paris expert for west africa &apos;s economy .
for example , the man who normally goes to the market and sells his vegetables is better at home .
the population is therefore directly and urgently affected by the epidemic : food is being scarce .
markets are falling in stocks of basic foodstuffs such as rice .
at the same time , the region heavily dependent on international companies is threatening to damage its image , with far-reaching consequences .
the greatest danger is that international companies will generally avoid the area for a long time , says philippe hugon of the french think tank iris .
the key is how far and how long the virus will spread .
investors may have the impression that &apos; it is dangerous to invest in guinea , sierra leone and liberia , and thus to invest too &apos; , hugon warns .
the disease also affects the eu &apos;s member states &apos; hard national budgets .
the disease also affects the already strained national budgets of the states concerned .
the moody &apos;s credit rating agency fears that its budget will be heavily influenced by the high expenditure on the health system and , in addition , by the worsening economy .
the african development bank has already promised to provide the health systems of the countries concerned with $ 60 million ( eur 45 million ) .
the effects are also felt in nigeria , where few ebola cases have been diagnosed so far .
although the oil-rich region of the southern niger delta has not been affected .
but elsewhere , many people are already left in the country for fear of contagion .
reservations in hotels also go down significantly .
protect your celebration of the 50th anniversary
the schützenverein &quot; tannenwald &quot; berngau celebrates its 50th anniversary from september 12th to 14th .
the schutzverein tannenwald is preparing for the 50th anniversary of the founding of the festival in the high reaches of september 12th to 14th .
the plan is on friday , september 12th , a big evening with the group &quot; dorfrocker &quot; .
on saturday , the great böllerschnitt is at 6 p.m.
then the large tent of the mood evening with the &quot; stoapfalzer spitzbuam &quot; is in the big festive tent .
brass band provides the music and the music of the music .
highlights on sunday are the celebration service and 9.30 am in the parish church and the great detention at 2 p.m.
in the afternoon , the federal and gauge shooting prize will be distributed .
a particularly beautiful sight will be the 25 women who will be celebrating their dirndln .
festkapelle is the brass band berngau .
the patronage has been given by mayors wolfgang wild and secretary of state albert füracker .
the original term &quot; schützengesellschaft tannenwald berngau &quot; dates from 1907 when the association for &quot; social entertainment by means of exercise in the room studies and small calligraphy shooting &quot; was founded on 21 march .
the nazi regime had abolished the association in 1937 .
only in 1964 did 19 young men find themselves again , who were in the guesthouse lukas on 30 april the &quot; new &quot; schützenverein &quot; pannenwald &quot; berngau .
karl march and adolf ried led the club as a protector through a difficult early period , when it was mainly about getting a united europe .
as early as the autumn of 1965 , the schützenverein im gasthaus &quot; leininger &quot; started with two teams in the lap competitions .
in the following years , sports shooters , who have now been organized in seven teams , established themselves in all classes , right up to the 1st gaulliga .
the club records are all about the year and the magic boundary of 380 rings was first mentioned by rudi meier in 1980 .
just as the performance of the active shooters has increased , the number of members has also improved .
after the club &quot; leininger &quot; no longer meets the requirements of a modern shooters &apos; association , the daimler board of the time , led by johann rinn , decided to join the basement rooms .
after a work performance of 2700 hours , on 8 may 1988 , priest strasser gave a lecture for the new shootings .
one of the great highlights in the history of the association was certainly the 44th gaulsschausen , coupled with the solemn consecration of the new shooters flag in july 1991 .
on 23 and 24 april 1994 , the schützenverein celebrated its 30th anniversary .
in 1995 a böller group was established .
josef schmalzl was böllerreher speaker .
a big challenge for the böllerer and for the association as a whole was the orientation of the bavarian böllertreffen 2005 .
in many hours of volunteer work , the members of the association last year opened the premises and the shooting facility in the berngau court and thus updated the technology .
eleven teams in lap competitions
the sporting performances of the shooters &apos; association can also be seen .
a total of eleven teams are currently participating in the lap competitions : six airrifle teams , an air gun team , a sports gun kk1 , a youth and two ah-teams .
the first team with lars ellrich , katharina ellrich , steffi grad and kerstin kellermann was in the round of 2013 / 14 by the gauoberliga ( highest league in schützengu ) .
the second team with verena moosburger alexandra meier , eva schuhmann and tobias graml was elected by the gauliga nord to the gauoberliga .
besides the shooting , events such as bockstechen , carnival and royal ball , club excursion and christmas party have tradition .
the shooters are also involved in this at the festivals in parish and parish .
tony stewart is suffering an accident on his return to the race track .
tony stewarts return to the race track , for example , halfway through his race on the atlanta motor speedway .
stewart went against the wall for the second time after his right front tire burst in round 172 and ended his evening .
stewart drove his damaged car into the garage and left without talking to journalists .
his team leader chad johnston said that his 14-member team was disappointed that he was concentrating on the project .
&quot; i wish we had a better use and a better result for him , &quot; said johnston .
we drive to richmond and hope that we can do better there .
stewart raced earlier on sunday evening after a collision with kyle busch and had to leave the right side of his car repaired .
&quot; i am quite hopeful today that a good result will be achieved , &quot; said johnston and added : &quot; it simply did not work . &quot;
not long after the second accident , stewarts wagons were loaded into the trailer and the team had packed and was ready to leave .
stewart left three nascar sprint cup races after his car had won another driver at an ash course in the north of new york state and killed him .
he decided to return this week and either to visit atlanta or the next race in richmond to win a place in the persecution .
he returned to work , while studying the tragic incident that occurred at the end of the 20-year-old kevin ward jr. , who was in a race at the roadside .
the authorities informed us on friday that the investigation into the cause of the accident would last at least two weeks .
no decision has yet been taken on whether stewart will be charged with an accusation .
the champion of the three times received a great applause when he was presented before the race .
after a start at 12th position , stewart was soon hit into the first 10 and was temporarily in fourth place .
after a restart in round 122 , bush ’ s resignation was a little bit of a mess .

ukrainian army has stopped airport of luhansk .
in eastern ukraine , the prorussian fighters are still on the march .
after a hard fight , which supposedly also involved russian tank battalions , the ukrainian army has today , monday , opened the rebel stronghold airport luhansk .
the army also announced that in the last 24 hours seven soldiers have been killed .
ukrainian president petro poroshenko has previously drawn human conclusions from his army ’ s severe defeat in the fight against the separatists , and has announced changes in the supreme army leadership without specifying details .
prorussian separatists shot aircraft from the airfield
in the fight against ukrainian government forces , prorussian separatists have , on their own account , once again produced a fighter and two military helicopters .
about 100 soldiers were also involved in battles in the donetsk region , or were killed , the insurgents shared the russian agencies on monday .
ships of the coastguard
the insurgents also claimed that , for the first time in the azov sea , two boats from the ukrainian coastguard were sunk .

nato does not want to break agreements with russia
nato is being strengthened by the planned deployment in eastern europe as a result of the ukrainian crisis .
nato secretary-general anders fogh rasmussen said on monday in brussels that nato is abiding by the founding agreement of the nato russia council of 1997 .
the nato boss , however , accused russia of a &apos; glaring break &apos; of the agreement .
&quot; today we have to face the reality that russia does not regard nato as a partner , &quot; rasmussen says .
documents and statements from the russian side indicate that they are &apos; looking at us as opponents &apos; .
stronger nato presence
rasmussen has also announced that nato &apos;s presence in eastern europe will be strengthened .
a report on the peace process to be adopted at the nato summit in wales will ensure that &apos; we have more visible nato presence in the east &apos; , as long as this is necessary , said rasmussen on monday .
kiev and moscow are agreeing on new gas talks .
russia and ukraine have officially agreed to new talks to resolve their gas dispute .
the negotiations are scheduled for next saturday , as the russian energy minister alexander nowak said on monday .
there is still a wait for a decision by the european union as to whether it will also send a representative to the talks .
the dispute over the price of gas has left ukraine with no fuel from russia for weeks .
last time , eu energy commissioner günther oettinger mediated between both sides .
ukraine had warned that russia could also cut off gas supplies to europe .
europe is borrowing about a third of its natural gas from russian sources , a large proportion of which is flowing through ukraine .
merkel speaks power : toll will come &quot; quite clearly &quot; .
now the chancellor once again clearly recognises this .
a licence for all complicated details is not .
persistent concerns from the cdu against car tolls have prompted the csu to make a significant impact .
chancellor angela merkel has called for a new eu law after continuing resistance from her cdu .
&quot; to put it quite clearly , it is in the coalition treaty and it will come , &quot; said the party leader on monday after the cdu-top governing meetings in berlin .
a detailed model , however , merkel did not set out for the time being .
in the black and red government programme , &apos; certain parameters &apos; are mentioned .
federal transport minister alexander dobrindt ( csu ) has made a proposal , and this is what is now being done .
the nrw-cdu , however , insists on its &apos; no &apos; to tolls on all roads .
merkel stressed that finance minister wolfgang schäuble ( cdu ) , too , is making constructive contributions to the deliberations on a draft law .
beyond the topic , he has worked with dobrindt to find more private capital for infrastructure investment , such as the broadband internet .
&quot; there is nothing special about this , &quot; schäuble had a &quot; mirror &quot; report uncommented on sunday , his house is examining its own concept to help motorway investors with toll revenue .
csu head horst seehofer warned that the us would not be able to introduce toll concepts in the cabinet against the lead minister .
cdu bundesvize armin laschet reaffirmed his objections .
&quot; the coalition treaty never assumed that all circles and federal roads would be walled , &quot; said the north rhine-westphalian cdu president .
in this respect , it is an important signal that seehofer has now announced that he will be speaking again on the subject .
opposition to the plans also comes from the cdu regional federations baden-württemberg and rhineland-palatinate .
there are concerns that a toll would reduce the traffic to neighbouring countries .
seehofer had to leave the city because of the toll criticism from rows of the cdu coalition loyalty .
the left sees plans as a serious obstacle to the union &apos;s dispute .
&quot; the murks toll is dead , &quot; said party leader bernd riexinger of the &quot; new osnabrücker zeitung &quot; ( monday ) .
&quot; with the toll , the minister fails &quot; dobrindt wants to introduce a vignette duty on all german roads to start in 2016 .
according to the coalition agreement , domestic car owners must not be charged extra .
therefore , they should be able to achieve full compensation for tolls through the motor vehicle tax .
the model may not , however , be penalised by foreign drivers on account of their nationality in accordance with eu law .
genetic disorder often misdiagnosed with genetic disorder
a british person says that she thought that , as a result of a misdiagnosis , she would die for many years .
karin rodgers lived almost all her youth in the belief that she would live only a few years after she had been diagnosed with another disease .
she actually suffered from the charcot marie-tooth disease ( cmt ) - a group of inherited disorders that caused nerves outside the brain and spinal cord .
charity cmt uk stated that misdiagnosis is a common problem for people with cmt who have been diagnosed with it because so little is known about it .
some 23,000 people in britain are likely to suffer from cmt , which may lead to motor disorders such as muscle weakness , unsafe gear and curved toes .
sufferers also suffer from deafness or pain .
when rodgers 13 was , she believed that she had died in a peace-loving ataxie ( fa ) , a disease with very poor chances of survival .
rodger thought she would sit in the wheelchair before she would 18 , and before her 30th birthday die .
the mother of two children , who are 51 today , said : &apos; as a child , i knew i could not do the same as the others .
i fell down constantly and everything took longer for me .
i could never go roll-skating or skating with the other children and was often in school because of my way of going and running .
rodgers said that they had been working at the age of 13 after several operations to relieve their achilles and stretch their feet their medical records , as their doctor had left the room and read that they had .
&quot; i felt guilty because i was curious , so i have not seen anyone .
when i received a reply , i was shocked and panicked .
i thought i was going to be in the wheelchair with 18 and die with 25 , and in between i would slowly lose all my abilities .
i made all this with me alone and planned my own funeral .
she said when she was 17 , she realized that her skills were not so much reduced as she could imagine .
it simply stood up and embraced me and said , &quot; my love , i do not think you have that , otherwise you are already in the wheelchair &quot; .
i think you have a little less life-threatening .
after some genetic tests , she found a cmt .
&quot; when he explained to me what cmt was , i felt like i was a winner , &quot; she said .
charity cmt uk has a cmt-awareness month started , to access this disease .
the company is based in the netherlands and operates in the netherlands since the closure of the former training place .
for almost ten years , the former training center in münsingen has been closed .
however , every month , murderous ammunition still appears at the heart of the schwäbische alb biosphere reserve .
the grenades are sometimes so dangerous that they are exploited locally .
a deafening chill hits the spinning of the hearts of the biosphere reserve .
in december 2004 , the last sharp shot of the troop training center munich , which was completed in late 2005 after 110 years of military operation , fell .
since then , the 6500 hectares of the area has been the core of the biosphere reserve schwäbische alb , which is situated on 13 designated trails for hikers and cyclists .
tax burdens on business people in the washington area are rising with the economic recovery .
economic recovery means more customers , more sales and new jobs .
it also means higher taxes .
government and local tax reports for domestic companies increased slightly last year , while the economic recovery accelerated , so a new publicized study in the past week suggested that the firms in the washington area should be closed .
companies in the district , maryland and virginia jointly paid $ 27.6 billion to government and local authorities in the 2013 financial year , a 3.8 percent increase in revenue from 2012 amounting to 26.6 billion .
the government and local tax burden on businesses increased by 4.3 % last year to $ 671 billion , compared to 3.9 % in the year before , and it was the third year of growth in succession after several years of modest decline .
government taxes have risen more than local taxes to reach 4.3 % , according to the study carried out by the services agency seriously &amp; young with the center for state taxation .
more than half of the district ’ s tax revenue is from corporate taxes , while 36 % of its revenues go to maryland .
virginia achieves the lowest tax revenue from companies with 28 percent .
much of the tax revenue increase is due to a recovery in business real estate values , according to researchers , which led to an increase in property taxes by 3.7 % in the year following the three consecutive years of growth with growth .
while much of these profits come from large states like california , new york , and texas , the process seems to be well in the region of washington .
businesses in the district , maryland and virginia jointly paid over $ 10 billion in government and local real estate taxes last year , compared to $ 9.6 billion in 2012 - an increase over a year of 4.2 % .
but the apparent recovery in real estate values in maryland is not so effective in increasing government and local tax revenues , as the real estate taxes are close to more than one-fifth of the tax returns of businesses .
companies in virginia and d.c. pay almost half of their public and local taxes in the form of real estate taxes .
&quot; in maryland , a large proportion of the properties are sold , especially in tax areas around the d.c. , either by government or by non-profit organizations that do not pay real estate taxes , &quot; said douglas lindholm .
maryland is therefore forced to concentrate much more on income taxes , for example , to provide the same services that other states offer .
the recent recovery in tax revenues by companies cannot be attributed to the recovery of the housing market alone .
company revenues also seem to recover , according to data .
companies in the region reported income taxes at state organizations of 2.3 billion $ in comparison to 2.1 billion in the year 2012 .
maryland captured $ 1 billion in corporate income taxes , the highest amount in the region .
while the trend is in the same direction , local tax burdens on companies are not increasing evenly in all three places .
the growth rate in the district was 4.3 percent , equivalent to the national average , while the maryland rise was significantly higher , 4.9 percent .
only virginia reported an under-average tax revenue of 4.1 percent .
virginia has achieved a significant lower level of corporate income in all three areas of office ( in all three there are firm corporate tax rates ) .
the maryland corporate tax rate is 8.25 percent and in the district is relatively high 9.9.975 percent .
a comparable study by the us chamber of commerce at the beginning of this year showed that less state and local corporate taxes are required in virginia , and that there is a better overall tax climate than in maryland .
the study did not examine the district .
despite the advantages , virginia is under pressure from its southern neighbour .
north carolina has laws to reduce its corporate tax rates from 6.9 % this year to 6 % , the same rate as virginia , and the rate will be raised to 5 % next year .
if the state continues to achieve its income targets in the coming year , this law could reduce the state ’ s corporate income tax rate to 3 % by 2017 .
meanwhile , small businesses in the washington area seem to be doing better , and they are paying more government and local taxes , according to the latest study .
corporate taxes , which are imposed as personal income taxes by small businessmen - a transitional structure that most small businesses are organized under - are in the district , maryland and virginia increased by 20 percent to 2.4 percent last year .
researchers say that the trend and increase in corporate taxes in the whole country is likely to increase this year , with a rise in the overall multi-defense revenue for the state and the local economy .
nevertheless , the space of washington may be lagging behind if federal government spending cuts are concentrated on the region ’ s labor market .
partner city : german beer for guangzhou
hops and malt - a popular combination in china as well .
german beer enjoys an excellent reputation in china .
frankfurt ’ s partner city in china now wants a brewery and also hopes for a direct flight connection between the two cities .
german beer , used in frankfurt ’ s partner city of guangzhou – that is the urgent wish of the officials in china .
&quot; we would be very pleased if a german brewery would settle in our city , &quot; said the vice-party secretary of the southern chinese metropolis , li yiwei , this week when visiting a spd delegation in his city .
the official of the ruling communist party of china repeatedly came to power during the discussion on this issue of the 12 million metropolis .
guangzhou , which is also called canton in germany , is one of china &apos;s richest cities , and li warned .
that is why people also possessed the purchasing power to buy german beer .
the hessian spd chairman thorsten schäfer-gümbel , who led the german political delegation , said to the host that he would be looking for a possible partner for the project in germany .
&quot; beer does not need much : good water , grain and joie de vivre , &quot; he added to the party leader &apos;s lunch in guangzhou .
this joie de vivre is already being excited by mr li , he flattered the host .
the officials then came up with a new proposal from guangzhou , with schäfer gumbel , with red wine , which was served for the meal .
the chinese brand tsingtao is based on german brewing art .
tsingtao beer is produced according to the german purity rule .
more business
a second wish from china ’ s hosts would be to have a direct flight connection between frankfurt and guangzhou , vice party leader li said .
lufthansa had offered the flight earlier , but in 2012 it was cancelled for economic reasons .
&quot; it would be worth it again &quot; , the local politician convinced .
&quot; business traffic between our two cities is growing ever more &quot; .
at present , travellers would have to take the detour via changsha in hunan province , li complained .
the guangdong province , the capital of guangzhou , also hopes for the flight .
the vice governor of the province , chen yunxian , expressed this wish in his conversation with the social democrats .
&quot; this is a very good idea &quot; , said schäfer-gümbel - chinese vice minister li jinjun , an intimate german expert , nicknamed assent .
a well-maintained partnership
the beleaguered guanangzhou party leader hopes that he will be able to lead frankfurt next year to a partnership meeting .
li yiwei was already on the main , but not yet in this position .
it was only this year that he came into office after his predecessor had been removed from office for accusations of corruption .
the local party leader wan qinglian had to go as well .
the action taken against guangzhou officials is part of a nationwide campaign against corruption in the party and administration led by head of state xi jinping with rigour .
li yiwei , the new leader , had argued for a us company before his party career , which was highly unusual in china ’ s communist party .
before taking office in guangzhou , he was a top official in fujian , where the car manufacturer vw was a major work .
frankfurt is officially more than a dozen town-twinning partnerships .
the connection to the 9000 km away guangzhou is one of those that is nurtured by both sides , for example with a student exchange .
last year , the 25-year anniversary of the german-chinese association was celebrated .
the southern chinese metropolis on the perl river is almost as strong as the whole of hessen with its economic power .
next year , it is going to increase its gross domestic product of eur 250 billion , reported li .
the family of joan rivers &quot; pushes the thumbs &quot; down the thumb &quot; .
joan rivers has been in hospital in new york city since she was delivered three days ago ; her daughter showed herself hopelessly that she was in the midst of a miserable illness .
&quot; thank you for your constant love and support , &quot; melissa river said today in a communication .
we are all keeping our fingers crossed .
her mother was named after her sources on thursday after an emergency for heart stillness in a clinic at the upper east side , yorkville endoscopy , in the mount sinai hospital .
doctors deliberately keep them sealed and , under close observation , until they are more satisfied with their condition , which continues to be described as &quot; serious &quot; .
the reactions came from many quarters , including in the form of an overwhelming online support from donald trump , montel williams and kelly ripa .
environmentally friendly vacuum cleaners and rising wages
for cars and vacuum cleaners that will be on sale from today , stricter environmental standards will apply in future .
similar to refrigerators and washing machines , new vacuum cleaners will be sent from 1 september to a label on which the buyer can at a glance identify central data such as the energy efficiency of the device .
new cars are subject to euro 6 in the pollutant class .
there is also more money for scaffolding farmers : they receive a nationwide uniform minimum wage of eur 10.25 .
amazon buys twitch for $ 1.04 billion for $ 1.04 billion .
amazon has just confirmed what information reported on monday morning : the online retailer - and video producer , and a lot of other things - buys the video streaming service twitch for 1.04 billion $ ( $ 94 billion ) .
the announcement comes as a surprise , not because no one expected twitch to be adopted , but because it was widely believed that youtube would buy the company .
three months ago , the sale of twitch to the video service of google seemed to be a cool billion .
twitch , which was only three years ago founded as justin.tv , was known as a general stream service - a live version of youtube .
instead , it quickly became a platform for players who want to publish their bravura plays , a &quot; youtube for live games &quot; , according to an insider .
the twitch interface .
and &quot; let &apos;s play &quot; , a video genre where better knowledge is the ( mostly older ) play a painting .
it is just that youtube is often called if you are using twitch to describe , so the message that youtube is using twitch was not mentioned .
it is a mystery why the deal with youtube did not come about , as the company reportedly was willing to pay as much as amazon .
all we know at the moment is this statement by emmet shear , president of twitch : &apos; we have chosen amazon.com to make it a part of our community .
another secret , frankly , is the incredible success of twitch .
for snows like me who say that they prefer to do sports than watch it , it is hard to beat the attraction that is assumed to be helping others play .
it is one thing to tell a friend about the shoulder at 3 a.m. while they are walking through resident evil , and something quite different , a spinning .
all these games you could watch right now .
another problem is that many of the most popular games are ego games today , so that you can watch without your own control over the perspective can be a really good recipe for headaches .
i admit that the rapid procedures in which the roger bannisters of our electronic age are entering entire games in record time are not really going to be very entertaining .
but until a virtual player or humor is present , his twitch channel is probably not so interesting .
but what do sceptics know about this ?
twitch is visited by 55 million different visitors per month and is the fourth largest source of internet traffic peaks .
and how exactly does amazon want to make money from it ?
it is hard to imagine that twitch is so elegant in amazon instant video , as yolan , and the like .
but twitch has something that every company would like : thousands of young men who are advertised as advertising clients .
as the chairman of twitch , shear , said , amazon and twitch &quot; both believe in the future of gaming , &quot; and the medium does not indicate any signs of shrinking , not even yet .
the hüpfburg near the burggartenfest was a lot of fun on saturday .
the concept of the organisers was right .
despite the strong rainfall on saturday evening , an estimated 1200 music fans came to the open-air festival in the burggarten .
at times , the entrance had to be stopped .
&quot; that was annoying , &quot; said ron sem , one of the organizers .
salwedel l light and fun .
matching two spanish words , maxim sachraj and ron sem have formed the name amula .
the open air in the castle garden of salwedeler burggarten is supposed to show brightness during the day and in the evening through various shows .
well , and the fun is coming on its own anyway .
this was apparent in the early saturday , when the first visitors came to the open air .
a festival for all generations had promised the organizers .
and you have succeeded .
around the stands of the burggartenwiese , salwederer , as well as guests from the nearby and further surroundings , had made it comfortable .
they followed the first live performances , wiped out with the foot in the beat , enjoyed cool drinks - short : relaxation pure and enjoyable were awaited .
and that all over the generations .
while some are on the bench of the extra white sand on the beach bar , some are lying on a quarter of the wine in the vinotheque , and others are raging in the sand .
but even for child smoke making , the volunteers had literally all their hands full .
the larger ones used the kickertables or participated in a skateboard workshop that the goodfoot-crew from salwedel developed .
until the great rain came .
just before 5.30 p.m. , he proudly cried to the visitors , especially families were looking for the wide and dry .
but the attractiveness of the festival did not disrupt this .
&quot; more people came than expected , &quot; said ron sem , who spoke of a &quot; success all along the line &quot; .
i therefore think it is very important to repeat the big party next year .
although the content and size of the event still need to be worked on , sem made a first record against the popular vote on sunday .
he was annoyed that the invitation to visit was halted in the meantime .
obviously , the security company had been booked with too little power .
the result is that some who had already paid no longer came to the grounds .
the response was very good .
in a first careful estimate , the salwedeler co-organizer spoke of about 1200 visitors who were in the castle garden .
there were problems with sound technology .
the hip-hop band blocks`n`rox broke its performance , therefore , and it was not until the end of the show .
the technicians were unable to produce a reasonably reasonable sound .
the planned shisha lounges could not be built because the tents were closed because of a tire breakdown .
&quot; next year , however , you will be there , &quot; says the organizer .
the premiere of the amula-open air was more than successful by the number of visitors .
and this in bad weather .
however , the organisers have made some mistakes , which are still to be made the first time , but which must be corrected in the second edition .
also in the social network facebook the organizers must include criticism .
&quot; sorry , but for 12 euros you just expected more , &quot; says melanie meier at the event page .
&quot; you have taken over a little , &quot; says ele zimmermann in the same place .
others do not see the initial problems as closely as they were .
i think it is very good that some people are not only stupid , but are also really trying to put something on their feet .
hats off ! &quot; , says stephanie jennie to the amula .
now the organisers have a year to overcome these criticisms .
new radom in berkum : wachtberg ’ s landmark is shrinking .
as expected , this is not the case .
rather , the ready installed part is waiting to be inserted into the distinctive building .
the action is in the context of a major measure : almost 50 years after the establishment of the tira space observation radar , the cover , called the radom , is completely renewed .
the new radome is equipped with a diameter of 47.5 meters a little smaller than the old one .
but the size remains world record .
the final step to complete the new case is the capping exchange .
the upper quarter of the old case is separated and covered with a crane .
then the last quarter of the new case will be set up .
if the weather is involved , the action is scheduled to start this week .
participants in the ice bucket-challenge will be able to get to know the pine forest and the surrounding area .
isabelle roberts from the uk cry so much as their ice-cold water poured over their head that they could not change the bone structure of their face .
this ice bucket challenge was painfully thankful .
a woman was sent to hospital after having been taken to the ice bucket challenge as much as she could have been .
isabelle roberts from the uk was so skilful that their ice-cold water was poured over their head that they could not change their facial structure .
&quot; the water was so cold that i shouted , and while i did , my jaw remained simple , &quot; she said to the mirrors .
ice water is being shaken over the 20-year-old .
isabelle roberts a few seconds before the accident occurred .
i wanted to close my mouth , but that did not go , the jaw was hasty , and then i understood that something was wrong .
my mother and sister saw this and made themselves laugh almost into their pants , but i had to go to the emergency .
the 20 year-old from the uk was sent to hospital to take the jaw after participating in the viral trend on tuesday .
the clip has been developed to a web-based and thousands of times on facebook and twitter .
soon , the castle clubs will pull together again ?
finally , there has been a constant clash between the two wolfratshausen burgverunien .
now , the board of directors is thinking about possible cooperation .
as a model for the reconstruction of the wolfratshauser burg , the late richard dimbath , former chairman of the wolfratshauser burgfreunde , led the project in the french guédelon .
a year ago , there was no good climate between the burgverein and the friends of wolfratshausen .
the positions of the council and the commission have so far been very different , as has been the case with the history of wolfratshauser burg and possible reconstruction .
now the two camps are moving towards one another : talks are about a common approach soon .
the association ’ s board members torsten sjöberg ( burgverein ) and herbert piffl ( friends of the castle ) confirm this on request of our newspaper .
&quot; i have called mr piffl and suggested that we could sit down together once , &quot; says sjöberg .
he said that all members of both clubs could in future move in the same direction .
this will allow visible successes to be achieved more quickly .
while the castle friends were waiting for the suddenly late richard dimbath to last see the reconstruction of the castle at the mountain forest , the castle is still under construction .
herbert piffl , second chairman of the friends of the castle , has been very pleased to hear his own information about the call .
since dimbad &apos;s death , he has been standing before the burgfreunde .
a new chairman is due to be found in a members ’ meeting in mid-september .
currently , according to the 74-year-old , the association has about 40 members .
&quot; after the death of my friend richard dimbath , we have reorganized the club activities out of respect &quot; .
according to piffl , the new chairman will then go into the conversation with the burgverein .
in the meantime , the castle friends could also get a current mood within their group .
there is still no candidate for the presidency , piffl says .
&quot; but i am confident that someone will find himself &quot; , he himself does not want to stand because he is residing in bad tölz .
the new chairman should be a wolfratshauser .
the tölzer wool was involved in the project &quot; but very much like to continue working &quot; .
the different positions on reconstruction are being ignored in piffl ’ s eyes in the near future .
he honors dimbath as a &quot; missionary &quot; who has always believed in the reconstruction of the castle .
two similar , well advanced projects in austria and france would show that this idea is not a castle of the air .
the high participation of the population and voluntary assistance from around the world make them a tourist magnet .
piffl : &quot; i too was sceptical at the beginning .
but over time i am more and more convinced that it is useful to have the project moving forward &apos; , but it could be a &apos; one-stop feature &apos; for the flutes &apos; city .
there is nothing else here .
moreover , the project would be supported by eu grants , visitor tickets and potential sponsors , believes piffl .
&quot; the idea of reconstruction does not , personally , mean that i do not want to throw it off the board &quot; , and he hopes that the burgverein may be moving a little on this point .
their goal to document history first is &quot; important and good &quot; .
then we could go further .
clever ways to save on university textbooks
since the cost of university textbooks to many students is more than $ 1,000 per year , the fast second semester has considered the most important topic of study in matt schroeder .
he invented a borrowing system for books of students of higher semester and offered nominal compensation to the retailer to delay the resale .
&quot; my mathematical book usually costs $ 180 , but i got it for $ 10 for a semester and a chick fil-a-keks , &quot; said schroeder , 19 who used the covenant .
the data required for the last semester would have cost him $ 430 , he said .
he gave $ 120 .
the college administration announced that students in the college have more than 1,200 $ a year for textbooks and study material that it is not available to students , but that there are different cost reduction options .
online stores and creative approaches such as the schroeder are increasingly the solution for students .
the renting of textbooks is becoming more popular , so students can read a book for a semester , often at a much cheaper price than buying it .
neebo inc , which has more than 250 university bookshops , announced that it has been retained for the rental of textbooks since 2011 .
industry surveys show that about a quarter of books are in the college bookstores last spring .
less than half of all textbooks are produced , according to the national association of college stores , in campus bookstores .
here is the one time for the best deals .
buy online online
some new books cost only one third of the price online , for which you are available in the campus bookshop .
the ninth edition of &quot; calculus &quot; vno ron larwon , bruce edwards and robert horetler costs almost $ 290 , but can be found at the specialized textbook retailer , $ 92399 .
used to buy used
if you want to read the notes of other or normal usage tracks , you can use a good option .
&quot; calculus &quot; is used on chegg.com for $ 93.49 .
matt casaday , 25 , graduate student at brigham young university , says that he is on amazon.com 42 cents spent on a used edition of &quot; strategy game &quot; .
the book has been sold for $ 48 .
academics such as ingrid bracey , head of the university of massachusetts at amherst college without walls empathy recommended students to study at their professors if they had previously been allowed to do so .
sometimes the updates for the seminar work are not relevant .
in such cases , older editions can often be used for a fraction of the cost of the latest edition .
besides chegg and amazon , half.com is also a popular alternative for used and used books from ebay inc .
renting a house in the costa del sol in spain is a great option for your holidays in the costa del sol .
the rental of textbooks is worth considering if you want to rent them reasonably well , remember to give them back and to look at the books after the course is completed .
you can pay more than 80 percent of the costs of a newly bought book .
a student could , for example , use &quot; calculus &quot; for the duration of a semester for about $ 20 .
find out about the terms of the business you are renting , including the penalty fees that may apply to writing notebooks , signatures , etc .
the renter pays attention : if you do not return the book , the penalty fees may even exceed the price of a new book .
e-books
e-books , instead of conventional textbooks , are also an option .
sometimes these books are de facto rented by buying an electronic license for a certain period of time from wholesalers such as amazon.com , chegg and barnes &amp; noble inc. .
at chegg you can use &quot; calculus &quot; for 6 months for about $ 61 .
bracey says that students in literature courses often find the best offers , as many classics are downloaded free nowadays , while scientific and engineering scholars are very expensive .
look around .
joe gault , 29 , who will soon be the pepper law school , will recommend that you take a look at the isbn number for price determination in books , as you can be so sure to find the right teaching material .
and before ordering online , you should check , so gault says , if the book is actually in stock .
he learned this lesson from the hard tour .
he bought a book that had four weeks delivery time and finally paid the full price in the college bookshop .
why &quot; guardians of the galaxy &quot; is not a cash shooter ?
&quot; the expandables 3 &quot; by sylvester stallone played less than 30 million dollars of his 90 million dollar budget in the us , while &quot; sin city : a dame to kill for &quot; .
the image of the camera diaz &quot; sex tape &quot; , which was tailored to the audience , played only $ 14.6 million at the opening weekend , while children &apos;s films such as &quot; dragon saws easy to earn 2 &quot; also disappoint .
an article of the telegraph film critic robbie collin suggests that the children &apos;s films of the lack of quality in the films themselves are the reason why .
collin called 2014 &quot; the worst year &quot; for children &apos;s films and described &quot; dragonflight counting easily made 2 &quot; as pure &quot; functional &quot; fantasy continuation .
for films for a slightly older target group , however , it seems that the quality of the films is not necessarily the problem .
in july , entertainment weekly compared the average cameo score- and metacritic rating for each summer movie start , which is between the american memorial and the world &apos;s 20th july 2013 .
the results are based on the opinion of the cinema visitors and film critics and indicate that this year &apos;s film hits are similar to those of last year .
some commentators say that the development is due to changing visual habits and the growing popularity of web streaming services like netflix .
director jon favreau , currently working on disney &apos;s upcoming jungle book film , is said to have been a friend of the hollywood reporter website : &quot; i think the times are changing . &quot;
we must accept that and not try to follow the past .
unlike the weak cash outcomes of the hollywood productions , netflix has recently achieved a turnover of € 59.4 billion with streaming content .
last summer , the director steven spielberg criticized the film studios for being too focused on film production in comics .
in the light of the current downturn , some commentators argue that his grim prophecy is a true core .
the expected increase in the potential cash savings in the summer of 2015 , including avengers : age of ultron , minions and jurassic world , has made other representatives of the film industry more optimistic :
the producer of x-men , simon kinberg , described the decline in cash outcomes recently as simply &quot; cyclical &quot; and said to hollywood reporter : &quot; the next summer will be the biggest summer of the year .
when the 2nd table tennis district tennis class was founded a few years ago to streamline the division of the league , this is a step in the right direction .
now the german table tennis federation has an additional 3rd bundesliga .
the result : if you did not rise , you went off .
for example , göttingen ’ s class highest team torpedo has won the most prestigious title in the oberliga release , but will play only five classics in the coming season .
the fourth class is the women of torpedo , despite their grandiose marching into the regional league .
the boys and girls of torpedo start in the lower saxony league , as well as the boys of the sc weende .
sg lenglers and the torpedo reserve are now in the new association league .
at the ladies , the ttv geismar plays in the association league , the torpedo second in the league of the country .
what looks like a better district class , is now the new district class .
this is where tsv seulingen , vfb lödingsen , torpedo iii , geismar , einbeck , hamenstedt , bovender sv , langenholtensen , the fc .
in the district sliga as regional representative , dransfeld and sc weende , play in the district class of ttc ii , red and white , the bovender sv ii and the ttv teams .
güntersen , the ttc and the ttv geismar ii are also included here .
in the district sliga run torpedo iii and sattenhausen / wöllmarshausen .
with nine teams each ,
the sc weende sends his girls to the small district sliga .
the district sliga season of the scw boys - there is another torpedo ii to start - is not complete .
in a district class , geismar , tuspo weende and bovender sv are going into the season .
in the first season of the newly established regional association , the two goddess circles start with each nine teams .
in the west season , the red and white ii , bovender sv iii , laubach ii , torpedo iv and v , mtv grone , dransfelder sc ii , mielhausen .
in the east season , among other things , sattenhausen / wöllmarshausen , nikolausberg and landolfshausen play .
the ladies kreisliga consists of sattenhausen / wöllmarshausen ii , bilshausen , hemeln , seulingen ii , tuspo weende and sg rhume .
this is still better than in the osterode district , where there is no women teams at all at kreis-level .
it is striking that none of the six 2nd circle classes is to be achieved , here the innovative and out-dated board of directors will have to think about .
nato summit : first protests in newport and cardiff
at the weekend there were protests from opponents of the nato summit in newport .
on saturday , hundreds of people gathered in the centre of newport to fight an anti-nato march .
on sunday , about 150 people arrived in cardiff in front of the town hall to meet a so-called counter-summit .
stephen fairclough has described the developments at the weekend and talked to demonstrators from bridging to belgium .
teenagers from the blue mountains have been flown out of the blue mountains .
two young bushhikers were shot in safety with the rope winch after they had spent the night in the blue mountains in nsw .

they were built in a stable condition with a ambulance in the blue mountains hospital .
anti-government protests in pakistan are escalating
the 1000 or so demonstrators were stationed by soldiers from the ptv building , said information minister pervaiz rashid .
the station was closed after more than half an hour .
ptv director athar faroooq said that the poles equipped with poles had devices in the editorial .
dead or injured have not been reported .
the demonstrators are calling for the resignation of the prime minister , whom they accuse of electoral fraud .
the police told us about one kilometre from the residence of prime minister nawaz sharif , whether it was to clash again on monday with around 3000 demonstrators with security forces .
according to hospital information , a policeman was injured .
at least three people were killed at the weekend and more than 500 were injured when demonstrators tried to return to sharif ’ s residence .
you are calling for the prime minister to resign .
the powerful military had a military squabbling on sunday evening after a meeting in the army headquarters to find a political solution to the conflict , &quot; without wasting time and using force &quot; .
the communication also said : &apos; the army remains committed to its role in ensuring the security of the state &apos; .
the escalating violence has caused concern about military intervention , which is taking place in the past more often than not .
the political will , which was expressed by the opposition politician imran khan and the preacher tahirul qadri , has been in force since the day of independence on 14 august .
sharif rejects resignation .
khan and qadri had urged their supporters to stay on sunday .
&quot; we will not go back without calling sharif to resign , &quot; said khan .
qadri expressed a similar view .
khan accuses sharif of holding the parliamentary election last may by fraud .
qadri calls for the resignation of central and provincial governments .
then a transitional government is to reform the electoral system and call for new elections .
more than 40 000 security forces are in operation to protect the government district .
the demonstrators had initially been peacefully hijacked before parliament , until khan and qadri forced them to stop the bombing of sharif ’ s residence at the weekend .
hütteldorfer after second win in the season on place three of the table .
the 2 : 0 over grödig has a bitter week on sunday for rapid has a reconciliation end .
&quot; the victory is very liberating , &quot; said trainer zoran barisic , whose team is in the lead with the team from the europa league on thursday .
&quot; the success was undeniably important , &quot; said captain jack and goalkeeper steffen hofmann , who was working with green white on the third place .
schrammel dreamtor brings rapid to the winner &apos;s road rapid has won the second season victory and the right reaction to the disappointment with helsinki and is starting with a success experience .
&quot; we wanted to show a positive response , &quot; said foreign defender thomas schrammel , who , with his magnificent leadership volley of the sixteenth corner , set the course for victory in the 14th minute .
&quot; i thought i had all the frustration of thursday and i was going to smell it under the latte , &quot; said the 26 year-old smiling .
when schrammel was invited to the last session in a bundesliga for the 13th novmember 2010 , it was still for ried .
the first championship hit in the rapid-dress will therefore be a special memory for him .
&quot; for me this is something very special , i am from the rapid newcomers , &quot; schrammel said .
due to the short basin blasting of mario pavelic schrammel moved from the left to the right defensive side and made the right side of his business very good .
he has enough experience in that he is also able to use this position in a misguided manner .
he deserves the gate , he has already assisted some of the others this year , &quot; praised barisic .
the team shows character schrammel also supplied the flank at 2 : 0 by hofmann after just over an hour that finally brought the decision .
the fact is that the guests could have been contacted before that .
&quot; thank god we have been a little lucky today , &quot; schrammel , who pointed out the gaps in performance and result in recent weeks .
barisic even found that &quot; in many games before , you were better than today &quot; - against &quot; the strongest team that has been in this season at this stadium &quot; .
the first triple point since 26 july has therefore proved that the team structure has not been able to cope with the setbacks , &quot; today my team has shown that it is of character &quot; .
it is no less pleasing to him that we have finally played too zero again .
a lot of work during the country break also the fact that with brian behrendt , mario pavelic , christopher dibon , deni alar and michael schimpelsberger have several outbreaks .
&quot; we must not forget this &quot; , barisic , who has been in charge of the european union for the last three days , warned that he was &quot; the last time very stable .
the country ’ s pause must therefore be used to “ lick wounds and to create a little more physical space ” , baritone said , the five u21-auswasser knife players in his team .
one who is probably particularly interested in the break is captain hofmann .
it tears up for the team , goes over pain .
it is precisely at this difficult stage that he has shown that he is a very important player for us , &quot; noted barisic .
hofmann gave the game rapids before it was replaced in the 68th minute not only the structure but also achieved the second goal .
for the 33-year-old who has been playing his 350th bundesliga game , it was the first hit out of the game since november 2 , 2013 ( 4 : 2 on the admira ) .
hofmann : &apos; must not believe that everything is good now &apos; &apos; we certainly have also had a bit of luck , but at some point happiness must come back to us too .
now it was high time , &quot; hofmann said .
but he warned that more concentrated work would be needed : &quot; you cannot always do it in black and white .
we have not played so badly in recent weeks as has been pointed out .
nor must we believe that everything is good now .
the importance of his role for the team he could not deny .
it is a very young team , and i am very happy to help .
they are still in my possession at certain stages , &quot; hofmann said .
grödig-coach michael baur had little to criticise for himself and his team .
he regretted the quick hit &quot; from the magic gate &quot; category , as well as the regular gate of nutz in the 40th minute , which was replaced by referee collegiate wrongly .
the only accusation i can make to the team is that we are heading towards tor in some stages not being concrete enough .
we have not had enough concluding conclusions on this .
internal defender maximilian karner saw it similarly : &quot; it just started badly , but then we have found a pure and even made a gate .
by and large , more would have been in it .
under this whirlpool , there is a rug of ruin .
a powerful tribe was shown in our puzzle task of the summer series &quot; my piece of rhöner luck &quot; last friday .
several of these tree giants still exist in the county , the illustrated copy is the &quot; scourge resting heake &quot; above the welding fountain .
a bumpy walk leads up to the 600-year-old oak .
it passes by couplings , basalt piles and basalt stone seas .
a piece below the stone bridge from the bauersberg , one kilometre north of the road to weisbach , stands it .
vital looks at the natural monument , it sits over the other trees in the surrounding area and reminds with a size of more than eight meters an american mammoth tree .
a little buddha on a tree stump suggests that it is a spiritual buddhist or mystical place .
but , despite intensive research , there was only evidence of the name origins .
dr. wolfgang schneider has specifically consulted the bischofsheim archive and has visited older people from the weltenbrunn to find out what is the equivalent of the scourge heal .
the results of his research were quite sober in explaining the name .
thus , up to about 80 years ago , goat shepherds were supposed to take their animals from underweissenbrunn to the laboriously rolled and freed meadows .
at the foot of the tree , the ruins of the ascent should have been rested .
meanwhile , the sector has regained its importance , as pastures are in fact again used for goats .
the area has also become the core zone of the biosphere reserve , has further highlighted schneider .
when entering the stone collections , however , you should be careful , because the sun &apos;s warmed up basalt is also suitable for cross-otters .
a hiking trail leads from unterweißbrunn to the tree , which is hidden a little .
other routes are signposted , the direction horhön ascends and leads to an extensive hike .
where is the watercastle ?
a watercastle that we will be looking for next to our task , however , is rather rare in height .
the reflection in the moat gives a good impression of the building , but we have some historical buildings in the district , including the konterfei building .
where is our &quot; piece of rhöner luck &quot; ?

after weeks of tug-of-war , italy ’ s prime minister and eu president , matteo renzi , has protested against strong conservative opposition at the special eu summit last week to the nomination of his foreign minister , federica mohamed .
renzi considers how the newspaper la repulblica reproduces the calamity of his work , also called the favorites in government , which he also favors in government , as a strengthening of the position of the social democrats and his own .
he also expects to be a driving force for his &apos; reform package &apos; in italy .
last but not least , renzi hopes that the invasion of iraq , which is always coveted against him , can be calmed down , because mogherini will be able to support it , albeit in a moderate way .
i would like to say to the conservative representatives , with president jean-claude juncker and the pole , who is the president of the council , that the prevailing opinion in rome is that a political balance should be struck .
because the eu &apos;s chief diplomat will be the vice-president of the commission , mr juncker .
the pending approval of the european parliament is considered to be safe .
otherwise , president giorgio napolitano would have rejected the nomination of the 41th year-old politician of the ruling democratic party ( pd ) hardly any &quot; important recognition &quot; of italy &apos;s role in the eu .
la repubblica is a widespread optimism that the political will to rebuild the european union , which has been proven in leading party offices for almost two decades and has been well known for its ambition .
the romans are married to the family and have two daughters .
her party career began with the phd politologist in 1996 in the youth organization of the then democratic di sinistra ( left-wing democrats ) , which was engaged in the catholic center movement in 2008 .
in 1999 , mogherini was appointed vice-president of the european community organisation of socialist youth ( european young socialist ) for three years .
the 2001 election to the left wing party council led them to the high party politics , worked in the foreign affairs department , whose leader they soon became .
she occupied traditional foreign policy priorities such as the middle east , was replaced by studies on nato ’ s deployment in afghanistan , where italy was involved with a contingent of troops .
since 2008 , she has been a member of the chamber of deputies , where she is an expert on defence and european and international affairs .
when renzi became premier in february 2014 , he appointed mogherini to his foreign minister .
if the pd is to rebuild a better relationship with the strong peace movement in the country , which is one of the party ’ s more than 40 % votes in the eu elections in may , then , as pd has noted .
the allegations in brussels that the new eu external representative has had too little diplomatic experience , so there is a lack of substance , and the pd is running into trouble .
in brussels , particularly in poland and the baltic members , mistrust realistic accents are being put on the crisis in the ukraine .
it supports the work carried out by the russian company gazprom , south stream , which is to be used to transport russian gas directly to southern europe , bypassing ukraine .
after renzi was elected president of the eu in july , mogtherini travelled to the country for her first visit to moscow .
photos taken with putin at shake hands were not taken in brussels with embroidery , as were the fact that they were not allowed to visit the kremlin chief for october to hold an economic summit in milan .
a total of nine young people completed their training at emz-hanauer in nabburg on monday .
among them is an azubi who has previously completed another training in the company .
in four training occupations , the new employees will be active in the future : electronics ( three trainees ) , mechatronics ( two ) , tool mechanics ( two ) and process mechanics ( two ) .
all azubis come from the district of schwanddorf : tobias braun and thomas bücherl from schwarzach , stefan brickl and florian rewitzer from schmidgaden , johannes .
the new trainees previously visited main and middle schools and real schools .
from wednesday to friday , apprentices from all ages and instructors drive to a team training event in oberammergau , where a day tour and rafting are included in the inn programme .
the company counts 435 germany-wide and 950 employees worldwide .
the number of trainees distributed throughout all years is 27 .
the french socialists should &apos; keep their mouths and put france right &apos; , said the main ally of francois hollande .
mr valls called for the deeply divided left to &apos; renew its love &apos; for the controversial socialist regime president .
the president deserves everyone &apos;s respect , and deserves our loyalty , and he deserves our support .
&quot; it is our duty to remain on his side , &quot; he said with great applause .
as a sobering gesture , the prime minister insisted that his government should not continue the controversy 35-hour week in france , despite strong calls for the regulation to be relaxed by emmanuel macron , the new economy .
on saturday , mr hollande urged his fellow socialists to &apos; unite &apos; with the government .
but christiane taubira , the minister for justice , has put the sand into the gear in which she has been detonated at a meeting of dissenters in the socialist party and the socialist party criticised her for not being here .
marine le pen , the far right leader of the national front , mocked the constant rift of the socialists and said that she was unimaginable that the new vall ’ s government would last longer than a few months .
francois hollande is the emperor without clothes , but prince manuel valls has none , they are forced to form a new government if the old one does not even survive a summer .
&quot; and the new one will not survive the autumn or winter , &quot; said miss le pen to supporters .
it repeated its party ’ s call for a dissolution of parliament , saying that it was confident that it would win early elections and that it would be ready to rule .
the ruling french party suffered a defeat in the local elections in march and the right-wing party in france was the last in the eu elections in may .
a poll in the sunday journal du dimanche found that 76 % of french people were of the opinion that the socialist group in the european parliament is in danger of losing their jobs before the end of holland ’ s 2017 term .
pascal perrineau , a political scientist at sciences po university , warned that the french would quickly find the patience to be the most discerning person of the new socialist government .
&quot; there is a small window of opportunity , but public opinion must feel quickly that things change , &quot; he warned .
otherwise , the situation could continue to deteriorate .
norwegian cruise just before a prestige cruises deal of $ 3 billion .
norwegian cruise line holdings ltd nchl.o , the third largest cruise operator in the world , is leading the industry in advanced negotiations on the acquisition of the competitor prestige cruises international .
a deal would be made by norwegian cruise , a company with a market value of $ 6.8 billion , to gain access to the luxury cruise ships of prestige cruises and to their wealthy customers .
an agreement could be announced this week , the sources said on sunday and warned that talks would also come about without results .
the owner of prestige cruises , the private equity company apollo global management llc ( apost.n ) owns a share of 20 percent of norwegian capital cruises .
sources asked for anonymity , because the negotiations were not open .
representatives of norwegian cruise and prestige cruises did not reply to requests for comments , while a spokesman for apollo refused to comment .
located in miami , norwegian cruise ltd operates a total of 13 cruise ships on routes between north america , the mediterranean , the east sea , central america and the caribbean .
its revenues in 2013 were $ 2.57 billion , a 13 % increase compared to 2012 .
prestige cruises , also located in miami , operates among the brand names oceania .
it reported revenue for 2013 of $ 1.2 billion , a 6 % increase compared to the previous year .
the cruise industry is worth about $ 29 billion and will be the most important source of income for them in the coming years , owing to the strengthening of the middle class in emerging economies such as china and india .
companies are trying to be the best choice for these new customers at cruise operators .
prestige cruises requested that the us regulators provide the publicly traded exchange rate in january 2014 .
apollo is the majority shareholder of the company for a company since a $ 850 million deal 2007 .
norwegian cruise was created in its current form in 2000 by a merger with a cruise operator owned by geneva bhd ( gen.kl ) , a recreational and casinos club .
apollo invested $ 1 billion in norwegian cruise in 2008 .
norwegian cruise started its business in january 2013 .
genting held a meeting of 28 percent of the shares , apollo 20 percent of the shares and the privatization of the company tpg capital in late june , according to the admission authorities .
carnival , royal caribbean cruises and norwegian cruises are available in the united states according to the original application documents for the exchange of preferential cruises .
pro-hong kong activists condemn china the day after the election .
a peking-loyalty group rocked the chinese flag nearby .
the standing committee of the national people &apos;s congress passed a framework law on sunday , which only allowed two or three candidates for the hong kong leadership in 2017 .
all candidates must first have the majority support of a nomination committee that is expected to be formed with beijing loyal members .
this decision makes it difficult for opposition democrats to vote .
political reforms have long been a controversial issue in hong kong ; party leaders have been concerned that the chinese will not be able to rely on other cities to make democracy .
after the publication of a beijing white paper in june , which called for china to dominate hong kong , the democratic institutions considered that the country was an unofficial referendum on the electoral process .
lis survey is conducted by the government in hong kong and the chinese liaison office in hong kong .
the vice-chair of the standing committee on legal affairs , zhang rongshun , and the vice director of hong kong and macao &apos;s council of state , feng wei , should be in charge of the day .
student activists announced that they would be in front of the office of the leaders in hong kong in the afternoon .
britain saw a major economic crisis until the end of hong kong ’ s 150-year-old colonial government .
putin is demanding kiev to include &quot; statehood talks &quot; with the eastern ukraine .
russian president vladimir putin demanded russian media reports that russia ’ s government should stop the government fighting for independence on sunday .
his spokesman , dimitri peskov , later made it clear that putin did not mean that it was under the control of the separatists that the eastern ukraine was going to become part of russia , but that its status was being defined vis-à-vis the russian .
putin ’ s call to the kiev government to negotiate equitably with the pro-russian insurgents , however , fits in with the one he has been calling since the outcry began five months ago : help for the people .
in an interview with the state television channel one , putin condemned the ukrainian military campaign to reconquer the separatist interests .
the kremlin and the separatists have recently taken the area taken as &apos; novorossija &apos; or &apos; new russia &apos; , a term that is reminiscent of the pre-revolutionary glory of the russian empire .
putin pointed out that all those who were killed during the ukrainian campaign were in danger of losing their lives in the elections on 26 october , and while government groups were destroying civilian communities in the areas held by separatists .
&quot; we must start detailed discussions immediately , not only on technical issues , but also on the political organisation of society and the state status of south-east asia , in order to protect the interests of the people living there , &quot; he said .
peskov said that putin ’ s reference to statehood in the context of greater autonomy must be seen , which has been supported for months by the kiev leadership to avoid fears in russian society .
only the ukrainian government can provide the eastern territories with the necessary autonomy , peskov said .
this is not a question of negotiations between ukraine and russia , peskov said , &apos; because it is not a conflict between russia and ukraine , but an internal conflict in ukraine &apos; .
clarification of the kremlin spotter to correct the &quot; misinterpretation &quot; of putin &apos;s remarks underlined the leadership claim of russia in dealing with the separatist rebellion in the east , in contrast to the direct opposition of the united states .
moscow would have far greater difficulty in getting the regions of donetsk and luhansk to annex the eastern ukraine , as most of the 6.5 million inhabitants do not belong to russians and surveys from the pre-conflict period are a broad majority .
the autonomy that russian diplomats have mentioned in international fora would give regional governments in ukraine the power to create their own trade agreements and external relations .
the anti-terrorist movement , which was annexed five months ago in the black sea , is the port of the home for most of the russian navy , as well as an important commercial port and historic coastal region .
the regions between the rostov area in russia and crimea are also rich in mines , factories and foundries , which are important components for the russian military .
ukrainian president petro poroshenko proposed , when he spoke on 7 june , that ukrainian authorities should be required to comply with ukrainian legislation - after new elections - with constitutional amendments that would allow the territories to be controlled .
but his notion of autonomy seems to be in sharp contrast with that of the kremlin and the separatist rebels , whose armament and incitement moscow has been accused of .
putin ’ s last call to kiev to cooperate with the separatist leaders on an equal footing followed another preoccupation with the rebels in the past week , after russian troops and tanks had been killed over the region .
the separatists , supported by russia , took over in a handcuff that , according to ukrainian security officials ’ fears , was the first step in a campaign to take over the strategic coastal region to crimea .
this is why massive civilian and military preparations have been made to prevent mariupol , a steel industry , from being able to compete with 500 000 people .
poroshenko spoke at a meeting of eu leaders in brussels on saturday and urged action to prevent another russian aggression against ukraine .
&quot; we are on the verge of a point where there is no going back , &quot; poroshenko warned .
thousands of foreign troops and hundreds of foreign tanks are now on the territory of ukraine .
the eu summit did not decide on any specific actions , the leadership demanded a draft further sanctions against russia , which would be lifted if ukraine ’ s crisis escalated unspecified .
ukrainian soldiers had to move away from their positions in ilowajsk after two russian tank colonies and 1,000 soldiers were sent to the danube region last week .
the first probably 63 ukrainian soldiers who were killed by the russian invasion of ilowajsk were killed on sunday at 10 russian parachutists .
nude photo scandal around australian celebrities and gabi grecko
geoffrey noble made no secret of his anger over hackers , who are probably nude images of his fiancé gabi grecko and a who is who of the a-celebrities from hollywood .
the film city is in excitement after a series of clear photos of a naked jennifer lawrence in a hacking scandal around celebrity in the internet .
the hacker responsible for this probably has 60 naked photos of lawrence , star from &quot; the tribute of panem &quot; and from superstars , including the models kate upton and cara .
the australian actress teresa palmer , emily browning , yvonne strahovski , and grecko of melbourne , allegedly also took private photos due to an icloud gap .
101 celebrities are listed on the list .
noblest who had been lost with grecko last month said to confidence .
all private letters and pictures should remain private .
it is a shame that private information has been stolen and passed on to others .
grecko , currently in new york , has reported that a news web site has said that the hack is &quot; shameful &quot; and that the people affected felt &quot; injured &quot; .
the hacker probably has 30 images of palmer with her ex-friend scott speedman , including two shots where you can see them without being in a pool .
the palmers film works include &quot; love is unbeatable &quot; with liam hemsworth .
palmer , chuck-star strahovski and actress browning from sucker punch were available yesterday for comments on the hacked images .
a lawrence &apos; said to tmz : &apos; it is a despicable violation of privacy &apos; .
actors seth rogen condemned the hacker in his tweet : &quot; hacked images from a mobile to post is nothing other than the sale of hacker goods . &quot;
from a purely legal point of view , the spread of stolen images should not be tolerated .
cyclists , joggers and hikers were on the big feldberg yesterday at the 8th bike-bike run and thus won the support of the association &quot; help for cancer children &quot; .
the tour , which was a torture for some , was a light training for others .
but there was one thing that everyone agreed on : it was fun .
thomas studanski will have slept well last night .
for the first time in his life , the head of the oberurseler brewery went to feldberg by bike yesterday .
for the good purpose .
the small muscular cat can easily be hidden away , especially since he was not allowed to participate in the 8th biking on the great feldberg in favour of the association &quot; help for cancer children &quot; ( frankfurt ) .
it is a great thing .
&quot; i now know that i can - fine ! &quot;
small peeing on the way in the applause curve ?
nee , if i had stopped , then you &apos;d been out ...
as thomas studanski , who was responsible for the cdu in the oberurseler city parliament , many of the 718 participants yesterday swallow in the spring and came close to exhaustion , but happy to see it .
others , however , have been easier to cross the 11 km long route between hohemark and feldberg .
norman dießner , for example .
the red green light politician from the district day - red red dress , red biking - made a big mistake at the start .
he is also the route in a slide , as nina kuhn , press spokesperson of oberursel , who , together with frank grüneisen , set off on the way .
for the two triathletes the &quot; feldberg bikes &quot; was not necessarily a sporting challenge : &quot; this is about charity , we are happy to participate - a trip would have been possible today .
on the way , they had invited paul wenzel from oberreifenberg .
the boy ( 12 ) was in the morning to oberursel to get back to the height of the hill .
the florian zierz frankfurt had set out to work in the saddle at 9 a.m. at home in the morning , &quot; made &quot; the feldberg twice , and then roll home with fun .
the &quot; fritten-toni &quot; was also fun .
for the head of the oberurseler kultkiosk , cycling tours over the feldberg are simply included .
he had a race track of 40 minutes with his 6.5 kilo .
a crazy event .
for this purpose - i am happy to be there &quot; , said andreas balzke .
the thirsty mainzer says that he is a &quot; ambitious and ambitious racing cyclist &quot; .
it must be , because it was associated with the &apos; fixing wheel &apos; , but it is also a racing bike , but without circuit ...
the fact that it was loosely up without a wheel , not only proved the 20 hikers who walked across the white wall and the foothills to the summit , but also a jogger who was standing on a cord .
mountain watchdoctor professor volker lischke , who with his team , equipped with allwheel bully and quad , for safety .
the 718 participants - and thus many as never before - were in groups on the track in the morning .
hikers first at 9.30 a.m.
the first cyclists and runners followed at 10 am .
five minutes later , the first mountain bikers set off .
bent hansen , chairman of the association &quot; biking on the great feldberg &quot; , gave the start commands and wanted the participants a nice trip .
next year , he hopes that he will succeed in getting up to feldberg to ensure the safety of the participants .
