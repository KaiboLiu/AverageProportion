retrospective thinking of the very american ideal of labour rights as human rights
the congress members keith ellison and john lewis have tabled a legislative proposal that would make the organisation of trade unions more transparent as citizens &apos; rights .
&quot; just like trade unions die , the workers of the middle class die .
i therefore take pride in the work of the committee on civil liberties , justice and home affairs , together with john lewis .
this groundbreaking law gives workers the same legal means to discriminate against on the grounds of organizing trade unions as on other forms of discrimination - and thus stops anti-trade unions .
the addition of the national labour law , to ensure that workers can be discriminated against , is a good idea for the organisation of trade union representation in order to be able to appeal to a civil court for justice - and for compensation or penal money - is to be necessary .
but it is certainly not a radical initiative - at least not under american standards .
indeed , the best way to protect understanding what is happening in ellison , lewis , and other sponsors of their legislative proposal is to establish the connection back to a very american idea .
despite the setbacks that the trade unions in recent years have been subjected to - in wisconsin , michigan , and other countries around the country - americans once forced countries around the world to accept labor rights .
there was a time when the european union was becoming increasingly involved in the war in iraq .
when the united states , after world war ii , occupied japan , the general douglas mac arthur and his staff encouraged the country to adopt a constitution that would allow the japanese to live in peace .
fully aware of what i have said , the workers and their unions have been very active in creating a new japan .
when the united states , after world war ii , occupied germany , general dwight david eisenhower and his staff urged the germans to write a constitution that would ensure that fascism was adolf hitler ’ s .
in recognition of the fact that the workers would organize themselves , and their voice in the new nation , the european union added a new dimension to the clause that explicitly states that the workers are entitled to vote .
agreements that do not restrict this right or aim to prevent it are not acceptable .
when the former first lady of the united states , roosevelt , presided over the international human rights commission , she was told that the universal declaration of human rights was a good thing , as was the united nations in 1948 .
for generations , americans have been accepting the basic premise that labour rights are human rights .
when this country joined other countries , it was trying to impose civil and democratic societies , and i said that americans were not entitled to the creation of a trade union - and to be a trade union - then .
after these rights were violated in america , the us is indeed very wise to look at the american ideal .
how pastor martin luther king jr. said 50 years ago : &apos; we are not going to be a great deal like a big bang &apos; .
the story is a great teaching master .
now everyone knows that the working class movement has the strength of the nation not restricted , but increased it .
the increase in the standard of living of millions of people has made work wonderfully a market for industry .
those who have not done the job forget that simple truths , but the story preserves them .
the story is remembered , and we should do so .
the formal recognition of labour rights as human rights - and the extension of the protection of citizens &apos; rights as protection against discrimination in the creation of employee representation - is long overdue .
keith ellison and john lewis renew the ideal that america has in the past .
judge stops temporarily from law , that all the abortion clinics in louisiana are forced to close .
a us federal judge stopped the trial on sunday for the time being .
this measure , which was adopted by bobby jindal , governor of louisiana , in june to the law and adopted on 1 september in force , is a step forward for doctors who are aborting abortions .
the decision of the judge does not , however , mean that doctors are still legally leaving abortion legally .
&quot; the plaintiffs can make further work in accordance with the law while they are concerned with obtaining these rights , &quot; wrote bundesreicher john degravelles in his judgment .
within a month , a hearing will be held for the judge , to decide for the law on a more lasting decision .
abortion advocates welcomed the decision to reduce the recent decision in a number of judgments against similar measures , and said that doctors should spend so much more time in order to avoid hospital examinations .
&quot; today &apos;s decision means that the women in louisiana are subjected to a deviant law which deprives them of their health and their rights , &quot; said nancy northup , president and chairman of the centre for reproduction rights .
it was not immediately clear whether the european court of justice &apos;s judgment would also apply to doctors from the two clinics , who had been accused of not being involved and also of being granted permission to initiate proceedings .
louisiana is one of 11 states that have laws similar to those in which courts have recently introduced such measures in alabama and mississippi for non-constitutional purposes .
key points of a law in texas that most of the people banned in the state are the closure of .
abortion advocates and the american college of abortion are not allowed to use abortion as a means of promoting abortion .
abortion opponents keep up with the fact that the measures are designed to protect women &apos;s health , even though some of them also have to deal with the effects of closures .
only a doctor who has been in louisiana to carry out abortions has patient safety records .
if all other doctors are in power , the government will not be able to carry out abortions .
on their argument , the commission is not saying that the court of justice has not yet been informed of the case , as representatives of the state of louisiana said , for the conduct of abortions .
delayed diagnosis and lack of diagnosis are the best ways of treating chronic death .
angelina jolie is a member of the jamendo music group .
for women in rural areas of australia , there is a higher risk that they will be suffering from ovarian cancer than they are in cities .
researchers analyzed the medical data of more than 1100 australians , with the total number of eggs detected in 2005 , and found that only 25 % of the total population was diagnosed five years after diagnosis .
the research leader suan jordan of the qimr berghofer medical research institute said that the most important thing for those who live in rural and remote areas of the state is to have a mortality risk during the study .
a small study : new medicines could be lung and egg stockpiles .
the researchers studied the effects of the medical care provided by women for seven years .
dr. jordan said that the age of a woman in the diagnosis , the type of eggs cancer , is existing pre-conditions and the social and economic status .
for older women and those who have cancer , it is important to have a better understanding of the causes of cancer at the time of diagnosis .
for those who are in rural and remote areas , the state is a very important factor in the mortality risk during the study .
although the study was not studied why outside the city live animals were with higher quality , the results were not very positive .
&quot; this disease is best treated by gynecological oncological actionaries , and these are usually found in larger cities , &quot; said she .
despite the improvement in the provision of telecommunications services to reduce distances , the commission proposed a new system as a possible remedy .
dr. jordan said that the study is independent of geographical status .
the rio tinto ride to conquer cancer financed a study that is being published today in the medical journal of australia .
in march 2013 , elizha neave learned that a young mother of 33 years had been killed by the gold coast .
garden centres regret falling prices for households , and the loss of income for the households , as well as the loss of income for the elderly and the inability to provide a living for the elderly .
the decline , together with an increased fall in the number of households under 35 , could result in the loss of tens of thousands of pounds a year when the current boys are still eating after a study by the hta , as in financial times .
the report states that the renter is on average 55 % of the amount paid , which people with own homes pay for their garden .
the increase in people who live in highly urban areas is a major cause of death and destruction .
in the london area , where over a period of 6 years the proportion of households is growing from 6.5 % to 43 % , the number of small businesses in the garden products is estimated to be the lowest .
the hta and the royal horticulturally society are the most important figures in the life of the city .
guy barter , head of the garden-garden consultant for the rhs said : &quot; container gardeners , for example , are very popular because they can sell their plants during a move . &quot;
the hta report identified the period between 1997 and 2005 as the &apos; golden age &apos; of the european garden retailer due to rising house owners &apos; numbers and economic prosperity of the late 1920s to the mid-1980 &apos;s .
he predicts that the number of new jobs will increase by 10 % this year , and that the number of people who are in the region will rise by 10 % in march and april of last year .
the oppositional opposition politician imran khan and the intellectual leader tahirul qaddi have been accused of having protested in pakistan .
in the capital islamabad , around 1000 demonstrators have signed the state television station ptv .
information minister pervaiz rashid said that soldiers had used the protesters out of ptv buildings again .
the transmitter was responsible for about 40 minutes , sending out a message .
at the same time , around 3000 demonstrators tried to return to the residence of prime minister nawaz sharif .
about one kilometre away they delivered themselves with sticks and stones .
the police used tear gas to build terengas .
the demonstrators demanded that sharia ’ s resignation be rejected , but he refused .
the army of the country is therefore rightly urging a political solution to the conflict , &quot; without time to waste and without violence &quot; .
after a meeting in the headquarters at sunday morning , the commission announced that it would be reviewing the military as having done its duty to ensure the security of the state .
the military plays a key role in pakistan and has already frequently played a role in the military .
the opposition leader , mr imran khuan , accuses premier sharif of being a member of the parliament in the may last year &apos;s election .
the protests were not escalated at the weekend , after khan and qadri had forced their supporters to leave sharia ’ s residence .
the three people were killed .
turkey is ordering us diplomat for spying reports .

warning strikes : local guides are threatening to have consequences for commuter drivers .
the nationwide warning strike in the local guides on monday evening was a real disaster for the passenger transport of nrw .
the 18 to 21 o &apos;clock proclamation of the lack of parking facilities in all the member states throughout germany , including the long-distance , regional and s-bahn transport networks , is a matter of concern to all transport companies .
the main thrust of the warning strike is the lack of freight traffic .

did the district court say that the trade union of german locomotive drivers ( gdl ) , sven schmitte , in düsseldorf .
we expect significant amounts of money .
regional priorities are set out in the report .
the main thrust of the warning strike is that the freight traffic is the main one .
the german railway in nrw announced a new version of the &quot; nrw &quot; version to minimize the impact .
the gdl , however , did not say where they wanted to strike , so it was difficult to find out the consequences in concrete terms .
police officers , from magaluf the corruption attacked , and the police arrested , and detained .
the prosecutors are not on friday telling the office of the prosecutor of mallorca that they had blackmailed by police officers and attacked the city of calvià .
the head of the police of calvià on the holiday island of mallorca was arrested after corruption charges and was released from prison .
the main commissioner , josé antonio navarro , was arrested following allegations of corruption against him by several punta ballena businessmen , the street where most bars and nightclubs are located .
according to the daily online mallorca diario , the ankles laid the foundations for the office of the prosecutor for combating corruption in mallorca on friday .
two other places of interest are located in the municipality of guardia civil , in connection with the corruption submissions of the municipality and are being held together with navarro by a judge .
the spanish daily newspaper abc reported that the commission has been working to reduce annoying night club owners who have been forced to veto the government .
&quot; it is no longer a matter of money , it is about survival , &quot; said one of the businessmen to the court .
let our life-base come out of the game .
we have nothing to lose .
magaluf made a great deal of money this summer due to a viral youtube video .
the island authorities have since tried to make the proper functioning of the alcohol industry more transparent .
playa house club , in which the rock is played , is a very popular place for children .
the tourist village of magaluf , the most popular tourist destination in the uk , is located in the heart of the city .
the first spring day with naked and stormy weather conditions .
the spring has sweet and savoury winters .
in the evening until 9 p.m. , another 5mm of rain fell to the city , after 6.6mm , which had already been taken to sunday during the night .
the last rainfall was the result of a series of short , stormy showers , including a cast shortly before 20 o &apos;clock and for almost 4mm rainfall in about 10 minutes .
after winter has passed for a fruitful dose spring , the first time that i have been able to get a good dose of spring , the temperatures in the city fell back to 15.8 ° c on monday .
the bösch weather conditions probably have led to the late landing of a flight from virgin airlines from melbourne to adelaide .
the aircraft could have been flying shortly after 7.30 p.m. , but was taken by a sherwind - a sudden change in wind speed or wind direction over a short distance - and had to go through .
windmills reached a height of about 50 km / h at this time on the ground at adelaide airport .
the flight data showed that the aircraft was also available at a second landing .
the flight delay led to a loss of the aircraft and a further increase in the number of flights , including an emirates flight from dubai and a quantum flight from sydney .
for adelaide , the first time in a row is on tuesday , when the temperature of the water is 16 ° c .
matthias thinks : highest time to the great networking of the internet .
given the galo-ing technical progress that has been made , our cosy and friendly home in high-tech companies , we must not allow this to happen .
while i am writing here , i am looking at the spin of the cable that connects the listener to the phone , and i think : boah , how retro is that ?
but behind this lies a thought : if the cable is not , we would be able to get all the listeners to work in the house in a very short time , and that would be much more retro .
in any case , the same applies to the ekeltronic ( ekeltronic ?
no , typing errors : electronic ) sector the rule that the world &apos;s novelty is today the electro-scrap of tomorrow , bought - obsolete .
and anyone who , for example , still has a tube tv in the living room , says that the tv is basically opposed to television .
why these considerations ?
because we are not aware of the ifa &apos;s appeals to the radio tower this week , we are still not fully competent in matters of electronics .
the laie , which once operated as a washing machine and cd player , was buried in the dark today .
yes , &apos; go on &apos; ?
what is to be discussed with people who seem to be voluntarily giving up such quark ?
in fact , it has been about 20 years since the first thing we have been doing was to make our house networked .
to ensure that the yoghurt can be ordered for itself , so that the fire alarm can be brought to us during your holiday in the maldives , we inform you that it is burning in the working room .
and would it not be wonderful if we were to have the air conditioning system in our immediate arrival ... ?
yes , that does require air conditioning .
but a dream will certainly come true soon .
irritation .
everything runs completely unnoticed .
from the daily practice we also know that if a new fashionable device is really needed urgently , it is guaranteed that the battery will be empty .
what is another reason why the commission &apos;s spin of the cable is also the next radio exhibitions .
israeli children are returning to the us after the war in gaza .
thousands of israeli children from the areas of the vicinity of gaza have been killed in the most recent earthquake in the country on monday after they had been in airspace .
the school started in the early 1990s , when the rocket launchers had been drawn into the south of israel , a feeling of joy and expectation , but the signs of fighting are still fresh .
in the southern city of ashdod , employees of the &quot; pashosh &quot; children &apos;s garden , who were accompanied by a rocket , were particularly shocked before the students arrived .
&quot; we have a bit of fear , but are excited , &quot; ronit bart said , resident in the kibbutz saad and there english speaking teachers .
many children from our area urgently need to return to a routine .
your 11-year-old daughter shani bart said that it added to the &quot; a little bit of comic &quot; to make a sudden return to school .
&quot; these were difficult times , and we are not out of the house at all , &quot; she said .
president reuven rivlin visited the kibbutz near the border to gaza .
until a cease-fire is brought to an end last week , thousands of residents of the border communities , such as saad , remained in their homes or left their homes to live in safer areas further away from gaza and to escape the missile .
many inhabitants of nahal oz , a municipality near the border to gaza , in the vicinity of a 4-year-old boy from a palestinian murderer granate .
the ministry of education announced that about one dozen schools in the country have not yet returned .
your children were temporarily taken to other schools .
prime minister benjamin netanyahu visited a school in sderot , a border town on gaza , which was severely affected by the palestinian fire .
it also called on the children to be much taught and said &apos; we will be ensuring that children are aware of their knowledge and offer them security &apos; .
israel and hamas agreed to resume negotiations with israel last tuesday .
the truce provided for a immediate end to the fighting and the important issues remain unresolved .
israel is calling for the disarmament of hamas and for the handover of the bodies of two people killed in the fighting .
a new round of indirect talks will probably be even more important this month in egypt .
the war has claimed more than 2,100 palestinians and has destroyed more than three quarters of them , and at least 494 children have been killed , according to the palestinians and the un .
israel is denying this information and appreciates that it is a minimum of half of the people killed .
on the israeli side , 66 soldiers and six civilians , including one thai citizen , were killed .
hamas and other struggles in gaza have been fired for 4,591 rockets and murderers during the fighting .
meanwhile , the country ’ s military , more than 5,000 air and sea freight attacks , led to more than 5,000 attacks .
the israeli attacks are damaging or destroying thousands of homes in gaza .
for tens of thousands of people continue to be in shelters and the fighting continues , the european union &apos;s educational authorities are postponing the start of the school year last week .
&quot; i hope the school is soon back open , so we can continue to learn so as to have children in the world and the jewish children who are , &quot; said mohammad amara , a 13-year-old boy who is currently living in jail in gambia .
after being elected in saxony : cdu-vize strobl provides npd-forbidden procedures .
given the voter losses of the npd in saxony , cdu bundesvize thomas strobl has chosen to end the current npd ban procedure before the federal constitutional court .
berlin - according to cdu bundesvize thomas strobl , the current prohibition proceedings against the npd should be brought before the federal constitutional court .
&quot; the npd cuts bad , &quot; he said .
this is a welcome development .
the npd was not present at the sunday vote .
a first attempt to achieve a ban on the extreme right party was launched in 2003 .
in december 2013 , the federal council submitted a proposal for a new proposal in karlsruhe .
german government and federal parliament are joining forces not to do so .
harbour city is a city in the south of the country , and is the capital of the country .
the new country square is now home to refugees in tents .
the central initial recording for refugees in harburg plateau bursts from all seams .
now the interior authority has three tents of the red cross next to it .
the district government has been elected only shortly before - it is little enthusiastic .
&quot; this hauruck actions are further provoking reservations among citizens and giving the district politicians no opportunity to engage constructively in human resource development .
your party calls for the district authorities to be able to make use of the unused houses in the harbour area at the moment .
96 refugees can be found in the three tents .
reasons for the overcrowding in the initial recording are the rush of relief teams and the lack of a proper response to the situation .
many refugees therefore remain in the eu for longer than the regular three months .
the house prices have the strongest winter rise in seven years , but shows a widespread growth in the number of homes in the year .
the rp data corelogic headset is a powerful and easy-to-use solution for the hedonic home market .
this increase in the number of employees in the group of companies in june , july and august is 4.2 % , the biggest increase in the winter months since 2007 .
the annual price increase in the european union was 10.9 % , more than twice the price of the euro area .
the research director of rp data , tim lawler , has told us that the first two years of sydney and melbourne have been selling a two-tier market .
the figures from rp data show that the number of homes in the us is still very low in sydney last year , with a record number of new homes growing in melbourne by 11.7 % .
the following markets are adelaide , brizbane and darwin .
on the other side of the scale is canberra , which is dominated by the cuts in government spending .
mr lawyer , as i said , is that the spring of the year is now coming to an increase in the prices for the next few months .
&quot; if you want to avoid the constant high rate of auction prices , you have to consider a generally fast sales rate and the ongoing price increase .
in an opinion to the new press , he contradicts statements by the managing director peer medau and attestites this &quot; how a field lord &quot; to position .
the style of the university is not this , it says in the communication .
so the family memaliu is already &quot; mid-june orally over the request for the wedding in the city .
the statement that the plans will only be known in july is definitely not true . &apos;
at the same time , he points out that the pacts are not a &apos; pre-fixation &apos; or even a &apos; decision &apos; , but &apos; preference &apos; .
the commissioner responsible for access to the railway is also responsible for the extension of the narrow road towards the castle , which is less dramatic than those of medus .
from a nine metre wide road was and is not mentioned .
it is not a question of eur 5.50 m at this stage , which is a meter wider than before , &quot; explains pötzl .
the argument of medal operators , that their cost free and shoes are not worth the price in the future , is then only supported by students at the university of applied sciences , does not want to be allowed to apply pötzl .
the hotel is not allowed to park , because it is like other public parking spaces .
the andean people think of the people living near the houses , but they think of the people living near them .
the crib mountain wightel , which is situated on the site and is located at the front door of the park entrance , along the parking deck , is said to be &quot; not affected &quot; .
instead , it gives cause for concern that &apos; this is not just about child care , but also about the future of the residents of the town at the mouth of the friedrich-streib-straße and the 800 pupils of the neighbouring real school .
it is therefore a question of much more than individual interests of the messrs medau , &quot; says pötzl .
whether the imf ’ s criticism of the family advisory board of the child ’ s crib , with the expansion of the street , would become one of the few natural spots of coburgs , &quot; can be read for himself . &quot;
in early october , pötzl , together with the baumberg state building office , intends to inform the city councils about the construction of the university until 2020 , &quot; and in this context the importance of new development &quot; .
peer medau had a very good opportunity to visit the parents of the nursery last week about the plans of the university .
so the commission &apos;s access to the new parking deck is not to be restricted by the campus and friedrich-street. it is to be via the medaul mountain .
this would make it possible to reach the narrow road on about one kilometre long .
according to the commission &apos;s calculations , the price of traffic in the park of hohenfels would increase tenfold .
from about 2000 vehicles daily , we are talking about .
the commission has been trying to make a statement on the plan .
glanf is out of handball national team .
holger glanf will not be responsible for the dhb team any more .
the 31-year-old from the bundesliga league , sg flensburg-handewitt , was mainly responsible for this decision .
the decision is not easy for me , it is over several months mature .
it is a time for me to respond to the signals from my body and to renew my career in the national team . &quot;
it is therefore going to be a balance sheet of 167 country games and 576 goals for germany in the international retirement age .
because the throwing huge backroom player is responsible for the champion leader , the team is not able to win the championship for a few years .
with the icelandic , who will be taking his cadre for the country games against switzerland on tuesday , the icelandic national team led a &quot; long and good conversation .
his ideas and approaches have made me as enthusiastic as they have been my many years of players and my successors .
but for my club i would also like to be healthy in the coming years , to be able to have longer regeneration periods .
the left hand side of the camera had a second chance in 2012 after a heel infection .
due to achilles heal problems , he had moved from team doctors in the german handball association ( dhb ) to a cotisonsprite. he had to take a heavy inflammation .
an emergency operation and two other interventions followed .
then glantorf had a complaint against the team doctor .
twelve years of professional and eleven years of national team career go to no body .
i have some health problems with building sites that i can &apos;t ignore anymore .
after the three infectious diseases of foot operations , which took place in 2012 in short intervals , i have my blood pressure never really got into the grip .
this is accompanied by some other wear related complaints .
the first year of the year i noticed that the commission had not received my head , but my body was not fooled , &quot; explained glandorf in the interview to the magazine &quot; handball time &quot; .
for a comeback , he would only be able to be in absolute emergency .
&quot; if all knitting tear , i am always ready to talk , &quot; explained the double family father to the magazine .
however , i cannot support the years in which i still play handball , at one hand .
i must also say that i am convinced , after my long sickness in 2012 , that the european parliament has been quite humiliating .
i have been a member of the committee on the environment , public health and consumer policy since 1988 .
in addition to the 2007 world cup title and the win of the champions league 2014 , he won the 2008 ( hsg nordhorn ) and 2010 ( tbv lemgo ) the ehf-cup .
in 2012 , he secured a $ 5,000 deal with flensburg to the podium of the podium .

we are satisfied and it was a nice experience for all concerned .
the organization was conducted without problems and it was not negative .
unfortunately , not so many participants , as the organizer decided to do , were coming , which is probably due to the bad weather forecasts and the morning weather .
&quot; we are facing a new era in 2015 with hopefully nice weather on 30 august or during another weekend &quot; , says the german cyclists , but nevertheless , promised to return to münsterland and the organisers plan to rerun .
constantine wecker was careful to keep honest memoirs of the people who were born in the city without any fear of being cheated .
it is actually more philosophical testimony than bibliography , which is constantine wecker , songwriter , pacifist , politko-safe activist , ex-prisoners , in &quot; mönch und kriekrieines 87 .
not chronometric , but more thought and energy .
and he is in the process of being honest : from the onanie as a gymnasiast to the store dieting and drug use .
also , to show that the first step is to promote tolerance in dealing with his fellow human beings .
wide spaces also take abstract , but all the more important terms : love , soul , ego , the being in the now , spirituality - all tries to do this by trying to get on very philosophical .
and he explains the way his pacifism , his social criticism , his political commitment - and also , as he does not only hear music - is the way he sees the opera .
the latter has the legacy of constant , westerners , who has also been assigned to the asketic monk , who &quot; is represented by subtraction &quot; , as he says , &quot; by doing everything unnecessarily &quot; .
there is a great deal of difference between all the high-minded views .
here too , it is gentle honest .
lenny henry : my father has never seen me in the arm .
never said &quot; i love you &quot; , but i love you .
henry was one of seven children of a jamaican immigrant family in dudley in the midlands in 1958 .
his father , the died , as henry 19 was , worked in a factory in which her relationship was limited .
henry proves for a comedy , rudy &apos;s , rare replica , and the first one is a imaginary conversation with his father and from the series on radio 4 .
the soundtrack is a mixture of reggae and rap , with lively melodies and a mixture of sounds .
but henry had to be bothered by some difficult childhood moments .
he attended &quot; many &quot; therapies and was awarded the &quot; best treatment &quot; after the death of his mother .
it was difficult to convince him .
it never looked like his face , only heard his voice : &quot; listen to the kraken on .
let your sister in peace .
take your time !
i want to tell cricket .
my older brothers seymour and hilton - who have grown up , as i was a child - went to him in the cold .
i never had such a conversation with him .
much of my life he was devoted to this serious type in the corner that the newspaper read .
recently opened henry a foundry in the netherlands , dudley , and although the conditions are better than at the time of his father , he won a glimpse of how life is for him .
it is now a little brighter , but they are dark , smoked , deep stylistic labyrinths with flame troughs and smoke and much soot .
my father put up sooner simply in the tub and then he could slowly hear him how he would sing .
when i came there , i was told that the european union was not going to do that for years to achieve food on the table .
however , henry grew up as a child without love testimony to his parents .
my father hugged the land of my father , he never said &quot; i love you &quot; .
only when i was able to get to know my mother towards the end of her life , we began to &quot; i love you , i love you , i love you &quot; .
the hotel is located in the heart of the city , in the heart of the city , close to the main shopping area and the main shopping street .
could you tell me what you are doing with the &quot; i love you &quot; ?
listen to the news and listen to the music !
papa , i am 22 !
with dawn french .
why should we not be friends ?
it is a great mother .
it is still with french befriends , but the first one he has been married to is the french .
dawn is a good man .
why should we not be friends ?
it is a great mother .
henry &apos;s own mother was diabetic .
the company contributed to their death .
when i was very , very exaggerated and had symptoms of diabetes , my doctor said &quot; you must be radical .
so i pulled this fitness through and had to take a drastic diet to get the symptoms to go .
it is very difficult .
and it is strenuous .
no one likes to eat carrots .
henry &apos;s career move shows that he is perhaps in his elegant , short cut bar .
since he was elected by critics for his othello , he has been a member of the theatre .
the following year , the comedy of the irritation , and then fences of august wilson .
this is another experience than the sitemap .
he started with just 16 years , when he was in a factory .
a dj discovered him on the stage , when he was able to imitate people and wrote to new faces about him .
his television career began in the mid-1970s , when he was a member of the european parliament for a fairly long time .
he learned in a profession .
i did not have to wait for the public to see , but also from 1975 to 1985 to learn how to create an efficient witz story .
lenny 1975 at new faces , a young man , in new faces , in 1975 .
since his manager is the stage rights at the black and white bar , he is also responsible for the development of the new album .
my family was very uncomfortable .
i wish there were some more things that could never happen , but i regret that i have not been able to do so .
it was a strange , unpleasant position for me , but i worked on riesenprojects with and learned to work with the people of a large audience .
but this &quot; years of price stability &quot; is not the only way to avoid the british television .
the introduction of figurines , which are the british black culture , has both ridiculed and celebrated , and has worked in the 1980s on an alternative comedy circle .
the first series of lenny henry show went to the show in 1984 and in the 1990s , he was among others known as the chef garreth blair .
advertising , documentaries , tv series , and film rolls have shaped his next decade .
then came a documentary series for radio 4 with the title what &apos;s happening so great about ... ?
the first episode was about the shukon , the first one was about shakespeare .
on shakespeare , i was really allergic .
i had the opportunity to learn something about him at school and never thought about him , mostly for a domain of the middle class , white in string quartz .
so i had great fear .
all who we have to pay for the show are welcome to join peter hall , trevor nunn , adrian lester , judi dench said &quot; you should try it .
make it not bad , if you don &apos;t know what you are talking about .
take a few of the words in your mouth , and then you will be able to understand why we all shakespeare so dear .
henry led 20 lines from otto hellos last speech for the documentary on and he was enthusiastic .
i had the feeling that i was creating this .
it was almost as if i had been given a head at last .
&quot; that is what it is about , it is a serious thing , take it seriously , learn your text , research it a bit , &quot; he said .
the samples were brutal , and i read this piece for months , before we read it .
and it was a success .
it seemed to be an autocracy , and that happened .
and soon he entered the coalition of the two irrational and unpredictable .
suddenly , i was in the national theatre and i could hardly believe it .
there was a moment when the commission thought that it was &quot; oh , you &apos;ve changed . &quot;
there was a technical error and henry felt instintimidated that he had to entertain the audience .
&quot; a small voice told me &quot; you have to be 10 minutes bridging now , while you are repairing the computer . &quot;
instead , the council of stage artists announced that the new album will be released in the next few weeks .
i went from the stage and something was done .
i am not responsible for that .
i can understand that someone else .
&quot; you play in a theatre piece , so i stay in your role . &quot;
henry in fences on duchess theatre , london .
the text for fences is not very demanding .
panic is very good , the commission is strengthening its tendencies .
that was also good , it is good , so it is like a great shield of the gods , who tell me &quot; this is your determination &quot; .
he says so , of course , with a thunderous voice .
so i stay there .
i love that .
i love to be in a sample room , but i don &apos;t want to be too much .
henry has always been a head of a comedian - our conversation is full of humorous eruptions , while he has repeatedly imitated people .
i have decided not to use stand-up-comedy .
if you look at this all the time , you drive a wall .
i am sometimes standing in the apollo live , when i am lucky to be able to do so , but overall i don &apos;t have so much as before .
i ask him whether he has ever been a stand-up coach .
the fun we have in a room with a tab is not so great .
is this not his new inkarnation ?
i think so .
i am happy to be an actor .
it &apos;s fun .
it is always a story that is told , and that is great .
i love stories .
people love stories , but they don &apos;t want to know them .
huthi-rebels are blocking streets in yemen ’ s capital city , yemen ’ s capital , yemen , and killing hundreds of thousands of people .
in the conflict between shia huthi rebels and the yemeni government , the huti ’ s have led to civil disobedience in the capital of sanaa .
huthi-supporters could have had central streets in sanaa on monday , said a spokesman of huthi party &quot; ansar allah &quot; .
the allocation of access to parliament was also blocked .
yemeni media report a traffic accident in the region of the capital .
according to the online edition of the newspaper &quot; yemen post &quot; , huthi leaders had abdulmalik al-huthi published a report on sunday evening on the measures taken .
huthi drove to the south of the island , according to the sheet , with another escalation of the conflict , if his demands are not met .
the shia hull ’ s struggle for greater independence from the sunni ruled yemen , and demand the resignation of the government .
the popular tribe of the huthi has been sieging the jemeni capital for just over two weeks .
about 30,000 rebels have been killed in protest camps in the great access routes of sanaa .
the surrounding area is still a very hot spot for the bloody battles with the yemeni army .
kenya registers officials who are &apos; scared &apos; and who are not allowed to be punished .
kenya has begun to take all civil servants biometric , and the country has started to register &quot; ghost workers &quot; from the pay lists of the government .
employees who are in the next two weeks will not be registered .
the government suspects that thousands of people will be killed even after their expulsion from the public service .
president uhuru kenyatta has promised to make a commitment to the peace process when he takes office in 2013 .
in examining the situation earlier this year , it was established that at least 1 million $ ( 700,000 ) per month was paid to payments for &quot; ghost employees &quot; and other abusive financial practices .
the government suspects that salaries are still on the accounts , and that the government is not paying them .
all officials must now be able to work in the next two weeks at identification centres to ensure that their data is properly collected and processed via biometric registrations .
all who have not done so without a credible excuse would be taken from the salary list .
&quot; this approach will make a significant contribution to the rationalisation of public service by reducing the actual number of officials and also by increasing the pay list on both levels of government .
the scandal of the art consultant helge achenbach will be the first to go to court on 11 november .
five heirs from berthold albrecht , son of the aldi founder theo albrecht , are calling for a “ peace ” in a civil trial at the düsseldorf regional court in düsseldorf and two companies .
the shared a legal language , which was the official language on monday .
in the classroom , the word &quot; aachenbach &quot; refers to the fact that when purchasing art and classic cars , it was deceived and berthold albrecht paid higher than actually paid purchase prices .
this also makes it possible to increase the agreed commission .
achenbach has prepared for 121 million euros valuables for albrecht .
children need roots and fleets , and they need wings .
44 years he was in school , of which 23 were as school director .
from this time manfred richter knows many stacked petershausener and kollbacher from their time as students .
his methods were sometimes unconventional , but he always worn by his ambition to be a man in the pupil .
the snow-capped mountain is the most famous mountain in the giant mountains .
manfred richter loves the painting with the motif from his home country .
judge was born in trautenau / north bohemia in 1930 , today trutnov .
with 14 interested people he was interested in the subject of the first class of the teacher after four years .
one year later , the sudeten germans were taken out of the country .
within a half hour , i had to leave the family .
after a few months in a camp , the first german army was going to bavaria in 1946 .
the commission , for example , has been dragging judges into the oberfrankische senkendorf .
the teacher training took place in bamberg .
i would like to thank the president of the commission for his excellent work .
after two months , manfred richter received a red cross award in a bazaar in bamberg : together with up to 15 students in a dormitory .
in 1951 , he made the first and in 1954 after three years of study , the second head of state .
since oberfranc is not a free teacher &apos;s place , he applied for a job in oberbayern and joined the german academy of fine arts on november 1 , 1954 .
the &quot; milling machine &quot; is a very good choice for the first &quot; apartment &quot; in the school house .
in 1958 he moved to the new building of the teacher house next to the school and moved to a three-room apartment .
this house bought manfred richter 1980 , after the school in kollbach was dissolved in 1968 .
until then , there was no such thing as a “ school ” in kollbach in the petershausen-kollbach school association , and five in petershausen .
from the school year 1968 / 69 , these were translated into petershausen in today ’ s town hall .
when the school association indiersdorf was founded , the school was left with primary school in the village .
to avoid a backlash in the smaller school , the first two students changed to the university of vienna .
but petershausen grew , and so we could not keep children and their teachers from september 1982 on today &apos;s construction , which was built in 1997 by judge retirement .
manfred richter praises the uncomplicated generosity of the mayor ludwig götz , who was born at the local expense , and who also built a workshop and expanded in 1997 .
&quot; mayor götz was very school-friendly &quot; , judge thanked .
in its entire career , manfred richter has never used the speech of a government representative who was waiting for a post of a school council on justice and law .
&quot; you have to tell the children two things : roots and flourish , &quot; says the 84-year-old .
and he had to learn : &quot; this is not always successful &quot; .
in any case , judge aung san suu kyi was sometimes unconventional .
if students are tested , they were given a certificate from him not to be penalised and were not even taken to sit down .
at the expense of the community , judges had had two pairs of boxing gloves and allowed the two competing to enter the ground , even though it was a veil .
for the benefit of the school , judges as rector maintained a good relationship with the mayor ludwig götz ( csu ) at the time .
this moved the party without party judgement after its retirement to at least be the last to be elected on the csu list for the municipal council in 1996 .
but judges were placed in place six and entered the csu .
180 km in three days , the first three days of the year , the first one in three days .
hr4 cycling tour 700 bicycle riders put their brakes on the right track in the spa park of bad salzhausen and schotten .
if cyclists are on their tour in bad salzhausen or schotten rast , this is nothing special in itself .
on friday , however , the number of resting impressions made alone : the 700 participants of the hr4 cycle tour and accompanying druss enjoyed a break in the lower spa park of bad salzhausen and later a party under open water .
under the motto &quot; cycling and celebrating on newly discovered paths between nidda and kinzig &quot; , the participants at the thursday in bad vilbel met and found a concert of van bader &amp; band miterliert .
on friday , it was taken seriously : cyclists took the first stage , which took 60 kilometres over florstadt to bad salzhausen and further to schotten .
in bad salzhausen , the sportsmen of the city were invited by mayor hans-peter seum , who was in bad vilbel with his bike , and the head of the bad salzhausen own plant , petra schwangen .
to refresh you body and mind was allergic to all kinds of good things : the landscape women from ranstadt and lower austria were very happy with 85 lead plates .
&quot; such cakes can only be baked in rural women &quot; , a participant from aulendiebach praised while he was ordering another piece .
the beverage booth of the turnverein geiß-nidda was able to provide cold refreshments .
the duo bravo underwent a long and well known melodies from opera &apos;s and musical instruments .
the beautiful ambience of the park has been relaxing .
a mr. enjoyed a lot of head-massage from his partner : &quot; the woman he deserves , finally he has a very long sprung of bicycle chains .
meanwhile , the mayor and the management board had to work : they were arrested at the fountain before drinking cure .
promo is also a member of the german association of marketing professionals ( hagen ) , since the first hr4 bike tour in 2004 , and has only been able to pass a short time , he had plenty of experience with the local technology .
his pickup force is the largest in the world , and is used to transport over three phones and a radio unit with its employees and the 15 members of the motorcycle season .
&quot; most of the participants come from the rhine main-region &quot; , explains the german minister of economics .
the number of participants is determined a bit by the criteria available .
in category i , participants will be accommodated in hotels , in category ii in accommodation .
from the spa , the cyclists had a good impression when they were back in the mountains after a year and a half : &quot; chüss ! &quot;
&quot; it was nice to have a drink in bad salzhausen ! &quot; they were going to go away .
the hotel is located in the heart of the city , in the heart of the city , near the famous royal palace and the royal palace .
but in the evening the cyclists were in the idyllic alteburgpark .
under the direction of the scottish society for tourism and city marketing ( gts ) , the park had a beautiful festival experience .
mayor suzanne schaab , gts-managing director markus hoßfeld and msc-chairman wolfgang wagner-sachs in his role as a member of the adac hes-thuringen .
the three showed themselves to be pleased with the &quot; many farm in scotland &quot; .
dj tobias hagen then announced the dancing stage .
the opportunity to swing
the hotel also offered a free shuttle service to the airport .
on the second day , the cyclists were at the stations birstein , wächtersbach and bad orb - including a concert with the trenkwaldern - on the programme .
yesterday , after 180 kilometres of cycling , the road was full of people who were again in bad vilbel .
dozens of turkish policemen for &apos; wearing &apos; the words against the government .
a total of 33 police officers were arrested in turkey on the grounds of suspicion of &quot; conspiracy against the government &quot; , reports local media agencies .
police authorities have not given immediate commentary .
among the arrests are 14 high-level policemen , melted in hurricanes , and the police arrested .
some of them were involved in the corruption investigations against government officials , including four government ministers in the last december .
in july , a number of turkish police officers were arrested , because they allegedly wanted to organise an organised criminal association and had telephone numbers attached .
the turkish president recep taylor has said that he is not a member of the european parliament .
not all children in ukraine are returning to school .
schools almost everywhere in ukraine opened their doors on monday ( september 1st ) after the summer holidays .
this day is traditionally an important day for families and , like thousands of other ukrainian parents , prime minister arsenij jazenjuk brought his daughter to school .
there , he told waiting journalists that he had not been able to open all schools again , but that he was determined to open the country for future generations : he was a member of the european union for future generations :
the september celebrations were not held in every school .
the sky is not everywhere above ukraine peacefully .
we must ensure a peaceful heaven .
the whole of ukraine , a huge common ukrainian economy , must be made to stand for a peaceful heaven .
aleksan pastukhow , schuleiter of the school in slavjansk , the jazenjuk &apos;s daughter , spoke in russian .
we hope that the european parliament will finally be able to reestablish peace and that the children will receive an education that will be useful to them in the future .
the first day of school of the new school year is traditionally celebrated , with children taking their breast with their embroidery , balloons in their hands and giving their teachers flowers .
with rona fairhead , the bbc has perhaps the greatest success for the director , who needs it .
it is taking place with a proud glory .
and it has its own front-page experience .
her career began with the worldwide management consulting firm &quot; basin and co &quot; , which was the focus of her work on morgan stanley , bombadier , ici and the media world of pearson .
it was seven years old as chairman of the board of the financial times and resigned when the supreme panel of the parent company , pearson , was appointed to a younger male colleague .
your deduction was supposedly nearly 1 million £ .
your political role in the european union is also sound .
it was called david cameron by lord brown .
her husband is a former tory council member .
in may , the commission described the task of chairing the committee with a poisoned kelch .
not only is bbc still standing as a huge and complex entity in the heart of public life , but there is also an internal paradox in its structure .
the confidence in the european union is twofold : inside to the first guard of its own management hierarchy in the bbc , but also externally as a voice of public concern and unrest when things go wrong .
this ensures a fast and unsustainable scrap of the game , which is to be called for in full reform .
but what new arrival is the president who would risk being forced to stand in the way of everything and to have an institution that is so complex ?
it is a difficult task .
and as if that were not enough , are there many other people interested in keeping the bbc smaller ?
while the competition is getting closer and new technologies are bringing old , comfortable collateral to the fore , the upcoming negotiation of the license fees for the bbc is with special dangers .
for the modest sum of eur 145.50 million per year , the commission buys eur 145.50 in the surely largest media company in the world .
the bbc is telling a good story : it says that the world is 96 % of households and that each of them is just 40 pence per day .
and it seems that the bbc is increasing on the popularity scala again .
the visual and usage habits for the bbc are very different .
but it remains a very beloved and beloved idea .
it needs a considerable amount of chairman - i hope you have not found it .
perry from texas says that herabitous tweet is not authorized to use the same name .
a tweet of the official user account of the republican governor of the texas , richard wagner , is available on sunday .
the tweet was later deleted and replaced by another one by perry &apos;s account .
it is a tweet of my account that is sent out , which is not my authorized account .
&quot; i approve of the tweet and i have deleted it , &quot; he said .
employees of perry replied not immediately to requests for comments .
although the tweets of perry &apos;s official blog are available , the new version was not clear who was actually using the feed .
the former tweet has a unique and unbeatable picture of the district prosecutor .
perry put a veto on a financial promotion of her office , when she refused to pay for the work .
the text of the tweets is : &apos; i am not always drunk with the triple admissible alcohol level &apos; .
i am the drunk democrat in texas .
lehmberg &apos;s office was not connected to the management of the investigation of the grand jury against perry .
this was developed by michael mccrum , a special prosecutor from san antonio , who was arrested by a republican judge .
perry argues in unguilty and called it the anchor a political triumph .
his high class team of legal counsel applied for a position at the court of appeal in the case to be charged with the charge and argued that the case was a criminal offence .
perry stopped 7,5 million $ state money to the public-integrit ( ptr ) unit - which was invested in travis county .
this veto did not make for public complaint from a left-wing party .
perry &apos;s official useraccount is often updated - and sometimes famous - to help you make your online bookmarks .
after he was elected president of the european parliament at the iowa elections , he was elected to the european parliament in 2012 as fifth .
berkeley explains how housing markets are once again being &quot; normal &quot; .
one of the most prominent figures in the construction industry in london pointed out that the construction sector is the most important in the south-east of england .
home is a very popular destination for tourists and tourists alike .
tony pidgley , founder and ceo of the company hochklasse berkeley said on monday : &quot; since the beginning of the current financial year , the market has again fallen to normal transaction levels since the highest level in 2013 .
the real estate market in london was very fragile during the downturn , as foreign buyers entered the capital .
according to the catasteride , the number of contracts in the city area last year alone increased by a factor of 18.5 % , far more than the average increase in england and wales in general .
the average sales price is eur 25.00 per month for berkeley private , cheap and student offers .
a stronger care for the economy , however , has led to real estate ownership in london for foreign buyers – some of them are also affected by the introduction of new property taxes and political rhetoric .
the london summit of real estate agents foxton has been warning in the past week that the price of mortgage bonds in the april , in which schärfere credit spending is being cut .
new data from the bank of england on monday show a decline in mortgage lending .
hamptions international , another property agency , corrects the damage caused by the loss of property in the united kingdom in london by 2015 .
the transaction volume in the most expensive counterparts of london is like chelsea , london , and london .
however , the desire for a home in the capital is not a sufficient reason for berkeley to be able to make a boon , as the sums due for derivative sales are estimated at more than £ 2.2 billion .
mr pidgley added that the commission is not prepared to respond to the demand for the right , well-planned product at the best locations , and as a result , the sales of the term are stable .
in june , the european commission reported that it had taken 3,742 new homes in the year up to the end of april - almost a third more than the peak of 2007 before the crisis .
the annual preliminary tax income rose by eur 40 per year to eur 280 million .
in a communication on monday before the annual assembly of the company , mr pidgley said that revenue for berkeley in the current year is expected to exceed the current market expectations .
the analysts estimate that the annual growth rate of the german government is 450 million euros .
berkeley shares are in the afternoon at the london stock exchange .
naked photos of jennifer lavrence by hacker on the internet published on the internet .
jennifer lawrence , the first german actor to appear in the oscar competition , will be on stage at the 85th oscar .
naked photos of the oscarprefecture winner jennifer lawrence , were shot online by a hacker who claimed to have a &quot; mastlist &quot; of images of another 100 starlets .
a representative of the star of &quot; the tribe of panem &quot; confirmed the success of the event .
the authorities were notified and will publish all those who have not yet received the stolen photos of jennifer lawrence .
the photos that were originally on the photo share page were 4chan .
it is not certain how many of the images are real , although winstead , star from &quot; scott pilgrim against the rest of the world &quot; on twitter also has condemned the hack .
&quot; to those of you who are looking at photos that my husband and i made years ago in the private environment of our house - i hope you are so right satisfied with you &quot; , i wrote winstead on twitter .

buzzfeed reported about the release of the new version of the debian project spokesman .
exclusive selection of the howard jakobsons high quality and high quality roman on love and the letter .
it is the most important and most important of all the other parts of the world .
occasionally , a woman told him that he was too serious , too strenuous , intense , distanced , and perhaps a little scratch-brushed .
and shake the lord then the hand .
scratch brush knew he .
he was a stationary , as in igel , yes .
the last victim of this stalemate was a straight start .
ailin solomons was a zither and tender beauty with untamed eyes .
it was associated with an older escort to the south , which kevern was holding for her aunt , and which had a land in a wet but paradise valley with the apt name paradise valley .
for several years , no one in the house had lived .
the pipes were empty , the pipes were not cleaned .
it was like the house from a childrens fairy tale , both threatening and tempting , a garden full of mysteries .
portrait of the author : howard jacobson , whose novel is &quot; j &quot; on the london bridge , for the man booker prize 2014 .
the shortlist is displayed in the next week .
kevern had a good time with alilin on the crushed stone .
your feet are too big .
due to their own aggressiveness , songs of this kind were no longer recorded on the console .
not prohibited - nothing was really prohibited - just not played .
it has been successfully obsolete , as the word obsolete has been .
the general taste of the product was very good , and the rules would never have been achieved , and as people in books saw the vom plates recitals at the millionaire memoirs , cookbooks and loving books .
in the euphoria of the day , kevern began to create an imaginary piano and to live in a grob comic serenade , ailinn &apos;s great feet .
ailin understood the message .
&quot; this was a well-known song , a jazz singer , and a great song .
this was his father &apos;s constant effort to keep the letter j .
it had been a game between him and his father , when he was still small .
his father had to deal with his own father , so he had told .
if you want to add a word to a j without having to have two fingers over your lips , it costs you a penny .
it was already no very lucky day to be able to play it , and it was not very funny now either .
he knew that the problem was being solved .
it had to explain what jazz was , and what it was .
ailin had never had heard of anyone .
jazz in the first half of the 20th century was not directly prohibited .
the improvisation was no longer modern .
it was only space for a single &quot; if &quot; in life .
people wanted to be able to hear at the beginning of a melody where they would end .
the commission &apos;s mind is also .
his unpredictability made the people nervous and nervous .
and jazz is a musical event , which was expressed in a way that was very strong .
although he was 10 years old , without being taken by sammy davis junior , he was still unaware of the fact that he was a jazz musician half secret .
but at least i had to learn ailinn not to explain that fats waller was black .
in her age she could probably not remember a time when she was a popsänger not black .
again , the idea was that no laws or constraints were applied .

my father never ever met anyone .
he spoke to too much , but the neglected garden gave him the chicken of feeling of security .
nothing could stop the soundproof from the huge coal-fired leaves .
ailin understood the need for a new , more efficient and more efficient system .
why would your father have loved something like this ?
he wanted to say that it was a jux , hesitated , but in their turn , to rewrite two fingers to the lips .
they thought in any case that the commission had done something strange .
&quot; it seemed to him funny to &quot; said he instead .
it shakes the eyes of disbelievers and closes the door to the eyes .
there was a great deal of talk about the world over when you were in a hurry .
there was nothing that he would otherwise have liked to see .
&quot; if you say it , &quot; my you without conviction .
but that is not yet why you should tell me .
it seemed honest to be concerned .
are my feet too big ?
he saw once again .
your feet are so straight not .
maybe your ankle , a little bit of ...
and thou sayest hast me , because my ankles are too thick ?
you hate yourself ?
of course i hate you not .
this is only the dumb song of the day .
he should have said &apos; i love you &apos; , but for that it was too early .
&quot; your thick buttons are not exactly the reason why you are giving me a taste of &quot; tempting &quot; .
i am a little bit perverse .
the sound is not correct .
it had comical to say .

several years before the elections that have just been told , the esme nussbaum , a smart , intelligent and enthusiastic 3d animation , worked in collaboration with ofnow , the non-legislative research leader .
&quot; it has been done a lot , and much still needs to be done , &quot; she wrote , &quot; to help the innate aggressiveness of a people , which is a thousand wars and most of them have won , especially in the lands .
but some features are not as yet extendable .
the higher the church tower , the more it seems that the lower the passion for the church he continues to inspire .
the population is crying out for sentimental balloons , deprived of skill and skill .
&quot; you have an unfortunate idea , &quot; he said .
i propose that we should have less romantic and less romantic .
esme nussbaum reduced its head .
i must also ask : are you atheist ?
&quot; i believe that this must not be said , &quot; replied esme nussbaum .
are you lesbian ?
again , the council of esme agreed to their right to privacy and refusal to make a statement .
feminist ?
yet again , i am silent .
&quot; i ask this not , &quot; said luther rabinowitz finally , &quot; because i am against atheism , reading or fetish .
the problem here is a prejudice free work place .
we serve a prejudice free society .
but certain types of hypersensitive information , which are in themselves totally acceptable and praiseworthy , can sometimes be achieved by results , such as those you have presented .
you yourself have obviously prejudged against the church , and these things that you have described as &apos; obscene &apos; and &apos; rough &apos; are not acceptable to others .
if you continue on the flirting of what has happened , if it has happened , as if it were , then you will be able to do so yesterday .
esme nussbaum was looking around , while rabinowitz spoke .
behind his head , a led-writer repeated the same thing in flamingorosa , the ofnow gave the country last four months of the year or more .
smiles in your neighbour , enjoy the beauty of your partner , listen to ballads , visit musicals , use your phone , talk to us , explain what you are doing , vote and listen .
speaking is better than silence , that is healthy and the word is better than what is written , but nothing is better than love .
&quot; i fully understand what i am looking for , &quot; he replied .
my concern is that the commission will not be able to deal with this issue without warning , as we have done , and we will be able to repeat the mistakes that have been made at all .
this time it is not the other , however , that we should express our anger and mistrust .
luther rabinowitz shaped with the hands a pyramid .
to achieve closer ties between the european union and the united states , it is important to bear in mind that this is the case .
&quot; they go too far , &quot; he said , &quot; if they consider acts as &quot; error &quot; , which our grandparents may or may not understand , they have not committed .
they also go too far when they assume that the eu is not going to stop their &apos; anger &apos; and their &apos; mistrust &apos; of &apos; others &apos; .
it should not be necessary to remove someone from the list in their position who is responsible for the way in which we understand the past , as in the protection of the present , and not from &apos; us &apos; and &apos; others &apos; .
there was no &apos; we &apos; and there was no &apos; other &apos; .
it was a time of disorder that is all i wanted to know .
&quot; from the if we are honest to ourselves , we are &quot; dared esme to throw &quot; no part of society claim to be a good behaving .
i would not complain to anyone .
whether it is bad or good , what has happened is a matter of fact .
that was then .
to do this , nothing more needs to be said - we agree on that .
and , just as no blame should be assigned , the imf must not be blamed for failing to do so .
but what is the past , if we do not learn from it - and i am not learning from it - and we do not learn from it - is the past - and what is it ?
the past serves to make us understand it .
if i have something to say on this - and i am not going to say anything about it - i would like to say something about it - i think that i am not going to be a member of the commission .
luther rabinowitz left his pyramid to collapse .
&quot; i will read your report , &quot; he said , and dismissed it .
the next day , when you are in the business as usual , she was taken by a motorcycle driver , who , as passers-by described , was in a kind of &apos; brutal rage &apos; on the foot .
coincidence exists .
lesotho military member says that no state coup is planned ; prime minister remains in south africa , and the prime minister remains in south africa .
official representatives of the military in lesotho argued that a coup was to be overthrown .
prime minister thomas thabane fled the country and told us that he had been arrested by the country &apos;s army .
the premier brought his family to the andean south africa after he was killed by assassins and he was arrested .
military spokesman major ntlele ntoi said that it is de facto not a coup d &apos;état , but that the military responded to the threat posed by &quot; political fanatics &quot; whose weapon was being armed .
&quot; what was happening this morning was that the staff of defence forces were being replaced by the police at lesotho , after having received several intelligence reports that there were some elements within the police that were actually some of the political party political parties .
the south african government spokesman , clayson monyela , said that the military action has given the impression of overthrowing .
&quot; even if no one has claimed that the government is being torn down by violence , the rest of the reports agree that the activities of the defence forces are being carried out by lesotho to date as evidence of a coup . &quot;
spokesman for the military of lesotho announced on sunday that the army &apos;s troops had been in their barracks .
in the meantime , the vice-president of the mothhetjoya metsing takes over the governance of the company during thabanes ’ absence .
thabane told me that he had believed that he was guilty of trying to get rid of corruption in the country .
in lesotho there have been major tensions since june , after thabane parliamentary sessions have been cancelled due to the clashes in his single government .
he said that his actions had not prevented the government from taking action , but that other accusations were made .
production in the eurozone on a 13-month low level is not possible .
the increase in production in the eurozone is slowing the growth in august to the lowest level in the last 13 months , so a very observable increase in the number of study .
the final markt purchasing manager index of the product produced is published .
a data over 50 gives an expansion of the range .
new orders were sent back and factories experienced impressive breakdowns in a time of rising tensions between the eu and russia over ukraine .
the figures are coming up before the european central bank ( ecb ) meeting on thursday .
the markets expect the bank to provide a clear plan for dealing with a hesitant recovery in the eurozone , as well as for the impending deflation of an inflation rate of only 0.3 % .
there is speculation that the european council &apos;s head of the ecb , mario draghi , will be able to provide further information this week as to whether he will make quantitative easing for the eurozone , in accordance with those who are affected by the united kingdom .
&quot; although a small growth is better than no growth at all , the brakes are the most severe effects of the growing economic and geopolitical uncertainties for manufacturers , &quot; said rosner .
the factory pmi for germany , the largest trading partner of russia in the eu , fell to the lowest level in the 11 months with 51.4 .
in the meantime , the us economy fell by more than 50 % in the second largest economic nation of the bloc , the pmi .
france remains a worried child , as is the decline of italy from a solid base of expansion .
indications that growth opportunities are not being taken into account in the key infrastructure mechanism of germany and in spain and the netherlands are now being considered .
the decline in industry is likely to fuel the fire of analysts , who are still holding out further monetary or fiscal incentives .
a positive news came from the republic of ireland , where the pmi was raised to 57.3 , the highest level since the end of 1999 .
howard archer , the chief economist , at ihs global insights , said : &quot; this is the best thing you can do for the purchasing management indices of the manufacturing industry in the euro area in august , is to do .
he added that the commission &apos;s proposal is to find the lives of producers in the euro area quite difficult at the moment , as the current increased geopolitical tensions , particularly with regard to russia and ukraine , are still uncertain in many countries .
this increased uncertainties have clearly shown the economy to be affected - especially , and confidence in the consumer , and probably leads to the loss of some orders .
he said that it is &quot; always more likely &quot; to be that the ecb will eventually be a kind of qe .
the hell decade of the survivors of beslan : ten years have passed since the terrible siege of the school .
ten years ago , more than 1,000 people were killed by chechen militias in a school in beslan in southern russia .
more than 330 people , more than half of them children , were killed in the three-day martyrdom that the world had shocked , killed , and wounded .
we are looking for beslan , a city that has been the victim of some of the victims who have died in the atrocities of the class .
exactly a decade after the pope ’ s terrible siege in besieged poland , when 334 people were killed , including 186 children , the leaders warned that the heroic survivors were facing a new apocalypse .
as a fanatical islamist terrorists , children and parents were killed on 1 september 2004 , the beginning of a new school year , and killed hundreds , the islamic country seemed to be doing so .
the tragedy unites west and east , in abominable terms , and transformed into a surprise .
ten years later , we are still in beslan .
we found surprising young people who were resisting , who were not able to remember the memories of this terrorist hell forever .
its greatest hope ?
the fact that the war that has now struck ukraine - and in which children like them die - is now ending .
the girl who is sitting in the trial was not able to enter the shattered school sports hall .
it was created by the russian star photographer dimitri beliakov .
it is totally confused to find a way to help her mother larissa , now 40 years old .
both were released for death , but they were surviving .
&quot; a woman told me i should be asked for my life , but i could not , &quot; said aida then .
my legs were bloodstream .
i stood up and climbed again .
a soldier brought them safely .
after a series of operations , she remained in a position of total healing , but said yesterday : &quot; three months ago , the pain returned .
i fear that the only thing i can do is to operate again .
some grenade shards are still in my knee .
their aim is now to create a dentist who can help people to improve their health , as they are helped by doctors .
&quot; this tragedy changed the way i live , but it has not shattered me , &quot; she says martial fluid .
&quot; this is what happened to me , and that is something that cannot be changed .
once a year i go to the sports hall and i am sure i will get back to the people who have stayed there .
my friends and i try to be in other days not to talk about it .
the pain is too great .
my best friend , and future class mates , is the dzera gapoeva .
we played together to form a small team , and dreamed of being a little bit more than we had thought .
&quot; i do not want to marry until i finish my studies and my career .
to a family , i am thinking later .
she says that the siege is always part of her .
i am glad that the many people are on the planet still remember our horrors and we are so grateful for the help we have received from people in britain and everywhere .
if i have the photo of me online , how to get to school , i will see how to get a lot of people to see it for the first time , understand our disaster and help make it happen again .
the young , who was killed by the ball hal , in the opinion that his mother was dead , was killed .
it was his first school day ( russians go with 7 years to school ) and he survived the thirty days of siege in the poor of his mother tamara .
when the seventh year he said , &apos; mama has told me i should not be allowed to go into the future if there is an explosion , and your hand . &apos;
after an explosion , he thought she would die .
she said to him : &apos; run . &apos;
full of fear , you can be dead , fled and saw on the way a wine .
his father vladimir , who was his son out into the arms of the family , said : &quot; damir told me that his mother died .
he said : &apos; i could not retrieve them &apos; .
in fact , tamara was out there .
after reunification , she said : &apos; i wept with joy .
i could not believe it .
he ran herring and surrounded the city .
damir was later moved to london .
&quot; this horror pursues you every day , but i wish you were able to live with remembering , &quot; he said yesterday .
but i can say that it is in my memory that i have been blatant .
i do not know that i will be able to buy all my toy pistols immediately after that .
but now i can play computer games with fireplaces .
&quot; i have no fear of being in the sports hall , &quot; he said .
i remember the first time these children were in my country in the courtyard , and they were not going out .
we never say that they are killed , but we do not say that they are dead .
we say that they are capable of being used in the sports hall .
i remember the very first days of my trip to london , especially the toy shop , where i saw everything i wanted to know about the game .
but now he is afraid of place like ukraine , where wars and the way of disfortune cause the kind of disaster he and his friends suffered .
this horror is following you every day , but i wish you were able to stop being so horrified .
&quot; i am so sorry for all those who have suffered under the atrocities , &quot; said damir , the past man who was a voluntary in a monastery last week .
i will be happy to help .
i want to come to the police one day and i hope that you will visit me next year at the school academy .
his mother , tamara , 48 , said : &quot; 37 children from our neighborhood were killed , and they cannot afford the same ?
i remember the first time that the european union was so timid , it was simply not children who were calling and calling .
it remembers vividly their journey to london with damir .
people in london were wearing a snake when i told our story .
i understood at that time how people on the other side of the world felt our feelings , and their support showed .
it was cherie blair and her foundation grateful for the price and opportunity to present a report to london in autumn 2004 .
i wish that i could be cherie and her just to tell her that 10 years have passed .
i remember the first time that i was happy to meet borschtsch and she all visited the russian restaurants .
i remember the time when he was with kelleys in a restaurant , and damir shot with his water pistol on them and they ran out of water and played with him .
and that was just a month after the horror .
i was surprised that the british were so willing to accept our pain .
she said : &apos; i still think that this world is in these 10 years no better than it has been .
in ukraine , the war is now continuing , and every day people die , and i believe that many children are killed .
these are precisely the children we have .
i think that the same applies to many of the war .
i simply know what these people feel , the whole horror , and i know that they are all horror .
and i cannot agree to the fact that we are .
nothing has changed , the people want to keep changing and they want to kill each other .
damir was big and is a very gentle and quiet place .
he is looking for a rape , for example , he is not overwhelmed by the past atrocities .
i know that he is not happy to remember that , but he has six close friends from the class and they go occasionally to the sports hall and to the inflammation there candles .
when he was smaller , he suffered from it - i remember the first time he was in the room .
not sleeping , his eyes were open .
i remember the same thing when i was in the office , when he was in the office , warned of all his weapons and other military toys .
i can hardly believe that i have spent a few hours so sure that he was dead .
when i asked about the explosion , and on the brine came my head , i saw that the water was shut down and the hell was running around me , with all around me .
i was absolutely sure that my little boy was in this hell impossible to survive .
&quot; i remember the first time i had been assigned to him , &quot; damir , lauf , lauf away &quot; , but i was also so sure that he didn &apos;t hear me .
but he has heard it and he has gone away .
and so it goes life , unlike the many other , for us to go further .
georgij ilyin , 17 years old , was born in the city of london , germany .
the young , whose terrible image was taken after the siege to the symbol of the atrocities of beslan , was killed .
comfort : the beslan-overflow is now a hero of the georgij lyin with his mother fatima after the siege in 2004 , a picture of georgij on the right of georgij today .
his bloodstream life is a long time coming .
his picture was one of the most shocking symbols of the barbarity of beslam .
his mother fatima , 54 , a physician , had chosen him for his first school day , before she was left to go , to leave her older son vladimir to university .
&quot; i left the court about two minutes , before the terrorists came to cry .
not entirely alone , there was a whole family of relatives of us , but they were all killed .
only my georgij managed to get to survive .
the closer this date comes , the more serious the situation will be .
there is not a single day when we can no longer get used to this tragedy .
we do not think that it was a long time ago , i think it would have happened yesterday , some scenes from these days watch me forever .
no one will ever forget that , but i promise you that .
intriguing : the image of georgij ( left ) was one of the most shocking of the attack and was described as statue ( right ) .
i remember the time when george w. bush was in power .
i knew that the commission would be on the move until the end of the day when i saw him on television .
and now there is even this statue of the weeping georgij in san marino .
georgij sees the image not like , and it is not too much at home in the bookshelf .
i understand that , but i also think that the people of the world , thanks to this picture , will feel our pain .
georgij says today : &apos; it is important to do that never again .
&quot; i doubt that the people of europe will ever know the truth .
people are studying such tragedies again and again and never experience the truth .
and now they are examining the crash of this boeing in ukraine .
will we ever learn that the european union has caused him ?
this world will become something terrible .
&quot; i can not understand how the possible is , because if you do not ask people , no one wants a war , so how does that happen ?
ten years is not a problem at all with such pain .
we need dozens of years to get it a little forgotten .
it has affected my health and i feel that it is still .
about three or four years ago i had a couple of nightmares about the siege , but then it became better .
i went later in 2004 again to school and had every day fear .
i thought of my friends and complained about the fact that i was killed .
that is why i always go to the sports hall when the 1st september is nearer .
i will not repeat my old childhood friends .
it is difficult for me to go into the sports hall .
i feel very uncomfortable as a victim of this , this story is now part of my past .
i will not forget that , but i am also blaming for it .
my life goes on .
i have this year school closed and i visit a medical college in the wladikavkaz .
i will be a cordial surgeon .
my first choice was to train in the army .
i wanted to be a soldier , but my health didn &apos;t let that happen .
i wanted to make a fight for my country , but that will not happen .
georgij faniyev , 20 years old , 20 years old , is a member of the european parliament , 20 years old .
the young , who survived , although he was at the foot of a murderous terrorist , was killed .
a miracle : georgij faniyev was a prisoner during the siege at the foot of a murderous terrorist , but he managed to escape .
during the siege he was in the sports hall .
it is a real miracle that he is not killed .
&quot; we feel it as if it was yesterday .
it is still the case with me , it is nothing i can do behind me .
i am now older and the people say that they are easy to cope with bad experiences .
&quot; in 2006 i worked with psychologists and felt like a little better after that , but i can not forget it .
and i would like to forget .
2005 - in the year after , the first and only time that i have returned to the sports hall was in the city hall .
i lost my life and my mind .
i will never go back to where i asked you .
survivors : georgij faniyev today , with a photo of himself in the hospital after the siege on the laptop .
my pain is unfettered and i wear it every day with me .
my friends know that i am not happy to think about it or speak about it , and they never asked me about the school .
physically , i like it .
i should be careful with my versed knee , but i can now run well .
but because of my health i could not stop at the secret service academy of the fsb in saint petersburg .
i have not yet received my documents , including medical documents , and you have answered that it is not possible .
my second passion was the animals , so i went to the animal medical centre .
i have already had two years behind me .
he learns to treat all animals &quot; from cats to kittens &quot; .
he said : &apos; i knew that i was going to give my children never to report on my experiences .
we should not be surprised if children do not know about this and they should not suffer it .
his mother marina , 42 , said : &quot; this pain is leaving me never .
it is in my soul , worse , if the anniversary of the coming year is approaching .
i will be going to the celebrations to commemorate .
i know that georgij is not going to go .
it must be made much more vigorous for him , because he was there and i am not .
i waited at home for him and could not help .
i am so grateful to god that he has returned me , and here in beslan we are all convinced that this is the case .
it remains in us .
georgij is now an adult who is not a horror .
it is difficult to understand that , if a little bit more unfairness is allowed to happen .
it is a young , he likes sport , but he can be rewarded for his knee .
he has been operated several times , he can run , but he cannot do sport .
i would say that he has the horror to 50 % .
this terrible experience will not stop us .
many friends and neighbours were killed in the siege .
i have seen many people lost , who i knew well and who are expensive to me .
my son is with me and that is the greatest gift i can give to me .
i know from families , where new children are born , but also from widows , who have never been married again .
it is hard to accept that the life of the people continues , even if we do not want it .
i will never forget how my heart was in me .
and now i see what is happening in the world - wars , wars in other regions .
what are these people fighting for ?
why do they kill each other ?
the war is a matter of great concern to our country and i almost do not believe it .
we used to be a friendly country , how can it be that we now fight ?
people and children suffer , i am sure that in the ukraine , many children have already been killed and many more have been killed .
if we are to achieve all these rebels and throw away - as far away as possible .
aljona tskajewa , 10 km from the city of santiago de compostela , 10 km from the city of salamanca , 10 km from the city of salamanca .
the baby , which is so sweeping by a special intervention command , is not able to carry the baby out with it .
saved , the aljona tskajewa is surrounded by a russian special command in security .
it is now ten ( right ) and remembers not at all the cruelties of the past .
the world held the aegean in 2004 when the baby aljona was in the arms of a russian police officer from the siege of beslan .
the terrorists were allowed to go , but in their cruelty kept their 30-year-old mother , the 10-year-old sister kristina and her brother makhar in the school sports hall .
makhar , then three years old , escaped , but aljonas ’ mother and sister died in the murderous memorial .
her father ruslan has since been playing secret roles .
aljona , today ten years old , remembers not the siege and is to become a smart and happy place to be .
&quot; they are now a great happy family and aljona and makhar are both great friends .
ruslan is a fantastic place to stay and want to offer you all the memories you need to live with the tenth anniversary .
you will understand why .

4 tips for better entertainment and more .
if you like to see photos or videos under water , there is a selection of devices .
the low-cost option is a water density pool-and-water shoot , as the nikon coolpix p6000 is or a accessories for action .
i have taken these photos with a family celebration with several cameras , all of which are at a price below $ 350 .
regardless of the equipment , there are some rules for the best results .
check your equipment twice a day .
even if you are looking for a waterproof camera , make sure that you have the battery in your hands and other threads thick .
imagine your camera also on the photos or videos .
some cameras and camcorders have scenarios and recording settings .
and before they enter into , they check the way they are in the depth of their equipment .
some cameras are only available for up to 5 feet , others up to 50 or 60 feet .
are you looking for a new product in our shopping guide and the reviews about digital cameras for conventional and waterproof models .
make multiple calls to your computer - because many don &apos;t get tied .
point-and-click is a powerful tool for creating and managing digital images .
even if you are using an lcd , it is difficult to do this under water , and the right image setting is a happy solution .
so make many shots .
if your camera has a sequence mode , you can set a number of shots with slightly modified exposure settings .
stay close to the surface .
the light is dramatically worse , the further it moves away from the surface .
if possible , then stay close to the surface , if you want to take shots in a pool , lake or sea .
this allows you to select more color in your photos ; the deeper you go , the less color you will see .
go distances and you will be able to see the objects .
this is also important on land .
it is particularly important that we do not have to wait for a single action cam : these devices often have a solid wide-angle lens , which means that the camera is more densely adapted to your objects than the one you are working on .
andrew lawson was a man of the sorte , whose character has changed things , even in such a gigantic organization as the nhs .
as an advisory anaesthesist , he devoted his career to the task of providing the sick with both the agony of the disease and the agony of treatment .
among his patients , he remembers that he was a mi6 employee , who was familiar with the devastating effects of torture .
lawson wusste knew that the doctors were not allowed to carry out diagnoses and illnesses , while the patients treated mostly with something completely different .
one day in 2007 was he , however , the one whose passion for the game began .
&quot; i have not felt like a man , &quot; wrote the book in may of this year .
i had difficulties in getting up and running .
while he was playing with the flu symptoms , he noticed that he was not able to help his wife juliet impatiently .
&quot; i want everything more immediately than later &quot; , writes he .
when juliet was released for a week on a business trip , the company felt like a lover .
something is missing in the last week &apos;s air .
he asked for a colleague to be a x-ray of his brother .
only two weeks ago , he was in the french alps to ski .
the result of the x-ray inspection was a result .
he suffered from bronchitis , a discursive cancer that was caused by the breast fur , that is , the lungs , to get rid of .
as with most creams , the disease is not exactly the cause of the problem .
for example , while some smokers are dying of lung cancer , others are not aware of all lung cancer cases .
but mesotheliom is different .
in almost all cases , the shutter release is an asbestos load - contact with the fibre material , which was once known as &quot; wonder &quot; but has now been identified as fatal .
for most of us , mesotheliom is a disease that , like easily ignored , can be ignored .
asbestos is , after all , a product of the past .
the most dangerous asbestos type was found in britain since the 1960 ’ s , when the industry voluntarily decided to use asbestos .
there too , where he is still in place , only people working in certain industries are directly involved in the substance - plumbers , construction workers , carpenters and shipyard workers , for example .
as an industrial gearbox made of a different time , it seems to be now almost more worrying than ever .
but this self-satisfaction is inappropriate .
britain , it seems , is experiencing the culmination of a mesotheliom episode today .
there are more deaths from mesotheliom here than in any other country in the world .
with a total of 2,500 deaths per year , twice as many people die from this disease as from road accidents .
annual figures for mesotheliomic deaths since 1980 and forecast growth rates in the us and europe are expected to rise .
the reason why we are not able to control the deadly effects now , even though asbestos has been illegal for years ( in 1999 all types of asbestos were banned ) is that a mesotheliom is only developing after decades .
and the scourge of mesotheliom is not due to former workers of the construction industry .
asbestos was , and is often still , present in the houses where we live , the offices , in which we work , the schools , in which we learn and the shops in which we shop .
and that &apos;s why mesotheliom knows no classroom boundaries , financial boundaries , professions or age .
the privileged and well-equipped bastions , surrounded by the elegant department stores in london and private schools , are not a shelter .
the parliament buildings are asbestos contaminated .
in the hospitals , in which we are healthy , too , we are already known as the starting point of this deadly carcinogen .
andrew lawson was not old .
he was also not a plumber .
it was not easy for him to find a way to imagine where he might be dealing with asbestos .
then he found it out .
&quot; it looks like the world is in a good condition in the tunnels at guy &apos;s hospital , where i have spent six years training .
all - students , nurses , doctors , and nurses - are required to use the tunnel .
one wonders how many of my fellow members are involved in the same disease ?
this question was unfortunately not answered at least in part .
&quot; of the four doctors who have been working at the guy &apos;s hospital , the only one who has been in the last five years at mesotheliom is the one who wrote .
how many of us will be more ill ?
andrew lawnson has been appointed mesotheliom at the age of 48 .
when he was on 17 february this year , he was 55th in the category of the star trek : the next generation .
that was an unusual long overlifetime .
fifty per cent of all mesotheliography ranks die within 8 months of diagnosis .
the disease always ends deadly .
we can therefore only act as lawson ’ s question : &quot; how many of us will be ill ? &quot;
the leading expert in britain , on mesotheliom , professor julie , has been a member of the european union between 1870 and 2050 , when asbestos was first discovered in britain .
most of them have no place at the moment , but they are dying in this way .
an asbestos mine in quebec , canada alamy alamy , alamy canada , alamy alamy , alamy canada , alamy alamy alamy , alamy , canada , alamy and alamy , alamy , alamy , alamy , is now alamy , is a major .
a short view of the files of the courts , of which the interested parties are often reminded for claims for damages , shows how far the scourge of the mesotheliom is already spreading .
in june this year marks &amp; funcer , for example , announced that janice was guilty of asbestos by all negligent means .
she worked nine years for the chain , from 1978 to 1987 and was responsible for the clothes industry .
mrs. all was only 18 years when they had been in office at m &amp; s .
now it has two children in the twenties .
&quot; before this thing , &quot; she says , &quot; i had never heard of mesotheliom , i knew that i was not even able to learn anything about asbestos .
i never thought that the people of the city would be interested in that .
there is only a few people who know a lot about asbestos .
the fact is that the term asbestos does not have a substance but a group of six minerals .
the name derives from the word &quot; asbestos &quot; , a description of the fibre structure that characterizes the fabric resilient and flexible .
three of the six were built in the construction industry .
chrysotil , also known as white asbestos , is the most common method of transport today .
it was designed for roof panels , floor tiles , rohrisolations , boilers solitations , even for brake coatings in cars .
it is less fatal than other asbestos , but it is still being used by the eu and the who as &apos; major health risk &apos; with possible death .
dangerous is the fact that the brown asbestos ( amosit ) and the blue asbestos ( crokydolith ) are more dangerous .
britain was once the world ’ s largest importer of brown asbestos , and experts suspect that &quot; there are clear but indirect indications that it is doing so as a major reason for the uniquely high mesotheism .
an employee of marks &amp; spencer was arrested in the flagship store in the oxford street , london , asbestos alamy .
janice allen has been perhaps not a typical example of mesotheliomopfer , but the work of julio carlos i suggests that he is a man of history .
he has carried out a study by the people concerned showing that the &apos; one essential part of the mesotheliomes without a known suspension through work or in the house probably through asbestos contact in the environment &apos; .
a large proportion of these contacts , he says , are based on the &apos; normal use and ageing &apos; of our buildings .
it looks as if the european union is not going to be safe .
a report by goddard consulting , a member of the palace of west minster , has been published on how people can be seen in the heart of the government , unknowingly exposed to the substance .
in 2009 , goddard reported that the service packs and robot lines behind the committee chairs were not working with asbestos .
members of parliament are often accused of being concerned about their own interests .
while the management of the parliamentary labour is insisting that the west minster palace should be a &apos; clean health certificate &apos; , the council and parliament have now been unquestionably able .
the goddard report pointed out that the eu has a duty to protect the existence of asbestos in accordance with the respective provisions .
no one can know whether this mismanagement costs lives .
all you need to do now is to wait .
a person who has lost contact with asbestos could never be sure of graham abbott , a general practitioner .
as andrew lawson suggests , the 50-year-old abbott suggests that he was working in hospitals to the asbestos .
&quot; i have a hospital in which i have to pay for asbestos complaints &quot; , says he , &quot; but i can &apos;t do it in my case .
it is so difficult to get used to all places where the people of europe have worked and where the data are .
what he has not yet remembered is the day at the beginning of december 2009 , when he was able to get a kind of fever .
he was 45 , and he just went to the hospital late at night .
suddenly , i had shaken a little .
it was suddenly a matter of urgency .
i felt like a terrible person .
i thought that the trip to home was no longer possible .
as a doctor , abbott knew that the pain was from the breast fur , the skin around its lungs .
but as janice allen has done , he had no reason to be a mesotheliom .
he went to the office a month ago .
it is surprising that doctors made x-ray pictures of his brother and his family and put plaura kathether to remove fluid from the lungs .
his complaints remained unanswered , however .
its health improved , and the disease was reversed .
from time to time , the symptoms returned , however , often after sporting reactivity .
in 2011 , a patient abbotts came to abbott with similar symptoms in his practice and was later diagnosed with mesotheliom .
but even now abbott combined this with his own case .
after all , his patient was a few decades older and had to deal directly with asbestos .
the connection in this case was clear .
in september 2011 , the downturn in abbott ’ s condition was reversed and his doctor brought his ct scans and x-ray pictures to an expert group .
in december 2011 , exactly two years after the abbott declared itself to be ill for the first time , the first person to be equipped with a camera was taken to the cave between the rib and chest fur .
i am an optimist .
i am mostly concerned about the fact that &apos; he says .
frankly , i had not even thought so many of my concerns .
but rachel , ladies and gentlemen , was concerned .
the result of the biopsy was in the week between christmas and new year : &quot; you said to me that it was mesotheliom . &quot;
graham abbott : diagnosis mesotheliom
suddenly , abbott had dates with make-up and macmillan nurses , some of whom had been recommended to him to take a lawyer .
only now did he understand the extent of the epidemic .
&quot; it turned out that the asbestos was very common , especially in large public buildings , where rosé and pipes are often mixed with asbestos , &quot; he says .
people who are not accustomed to asbestos in these buildings are now suffering .
and so mesotheliom is now meeting younger people who are not in the typical professions .
the most dangerous pipes with asbestos insulation in hospitals were under the ground , so patients were likely to be more exposed to the substance .
but many employees who work in pedestrians are not able to walk from one building to another ( like andrew lawson ) or in underground buildings .
it is clear that over several decades of the war , hospitals have been closed to patients for life-saving purposes , but life-threatening for the treatment of doctors .
it will continue to be removed today .
students presented their bunker burners on asbestos mats .
and it does not just concern hospitals .
asbestos was created by his fabulous insulating and flame retardant properties in offices , shops , libraries and town halls .
schools too .
indeed , many people may have been able to get the first asbestos contact in the classroom .
throughout the country , in thousands of chemistry hours , students have shown their torch burners on asbestos mats .
on websites , the theme of asbestos is now frequently raised in schools .
and meanwhile , so unaccountable items have no place in our houses , such as flooring or scaling poles , as standard .
&quot; it is an industrial poison that is present in much of our properties , &quot; said the author .
in one case , the only contact that was open to a woman concerned was the abortion .
so please adjust to how you can make your garden scales tear out .
the effects of the diagnosis , and the knowledge that the disease is incurable , is immense .
&quot; it takes a while to do that .
i went back to work and tried to go further .
i was in the region for two weeks .
then i knew that i would be going and i would take care of myself .
well , i will not add another christmas tree to the experience .
with the greatest difficulty , the perspective effect was changed from the position of a doctor to that of a patient .
how countless patients before him reminds him that he was overweight .
&quot; it was very difficult to do all this , &quot; he says .
&quot; i asked my doctor &quot; how long i have not ? &quot;
and there was still something for me about 12 months .
i remember the time when i thought that the &apos; well yes , i will not be another christmas tree &apos; .
that was the case . &apos;
mesotheliom is particularly insidious because it is our life expectancy mechanism - breathing itself - that the fatal cancer of which is caused .
most cases of mesothelioma are caused by asbestos contact .
asbestos consists of small fibres .
if the asbestos is raised and the fibres are inhaled , they can be stored in the chest coat , the skin around the lungs .
asbestos fibers irritate the chest coat and can cause cell mutations .
&quot; the problem arises with the inhaled needle shaped and asbestos fibres , &quot; says professor tom treasure .
that is exactly the hospital that andrew lavson suspected to be in the hands of asbestos .
treasure hunt was known as lawson and treated him to some other people who were probably also trained in hospital .
once asbestos needles have the pneumonia , treasure says &quot; they will be taken from the breathing to the edge of the breathing process .
by nature , it is important from the outset to invasively .
the usual options for other cancer patients are to work with brass and bronze .
the effectiveness of an operation is , for example , highly controversial .
some say that they have made an attempt .
treasure hunt is a form of crime .
&quot; you can &apos;t see the chest coat , but you can tell it .
they come by measuring the knife .
meanwhile , the kremlin speaks of &apos; chemotherapy &apos; not very well , &apos; the effect shows &apos; , but does not cure .
&quot; sometimes there are long-term overflow problems , &quot; says treadure .
but at the end they all die .
fortunately , some patients actually live long , much longer than expected .
the author stephen jay gould died 20 years after the diagnosis .
two and a half years after his own diagnosis , graham abbott is still fighting .
after he was mesotheliom contacted , abbott came in contact with andrew lawson , who was sentenced to death four years after his diagnosis .
&quot; hello , cancer center , &quot; i put it at ankama , &quot; he said .
&quot; he was very positive , &quot; says abbott .
he had his diagnosis 4 years earlier and was still a very active one .
originally , abbott had six chemotherapy cycles available .
&quot; i was desperate , &quot; says he .
i wanted to give up .
lawson created the first version of the game , which was released in the uk in may 2008 .
the commission has already taken a decision to make a study of the situation in the united states , following consultation with several doctors .
&quot; we had an advantage by not having to go further .
a normal patient is not going to receive a bank transfer and will be asked to approve the treatment .
money is crucial to mesotheliom sufferers in order to find the best available therapies .
but if these treatments are finally inevitable , they will not be available to many people affected by another financial concern - about the future of families , the future of which they leave .
and so you turn to the courts in the hope of compensation .
andrew lawson contacted the debian project leader andrew morgan for a detailed description of the debian project .
&quot; it has been a known name since 1898 that asbestos is extremely dangerous to health , &quot; says morgan .
but what has changed in the 1960 ’ s is that one recognizes that even a very small number of people are at risk of health .
and here the carelessness of companies began to play a role .
andrew lawson and guy &apos;s are now in the process of putting their case , but it was not the case that morgan had called a &quot; full compensation &quot; .
the commission has , however , confirmed that the death penalty is not being applied to the united states .
that was a great surprise for andrew lawson .
as asbestos can be removed , it is not possible to remove asbestos .
indeed , it is important for mesotheliom sufferers who care about compensation to have an enormous problem , which is the deadly asbestos contact between a company or a job - usually decades after the incidents .
many of your former employers have been sold or closed .
insurance documents can be lost .
and those who are against claims are not the ones who know that time is too short for them , but certainly not with the plaintiffs .
in response , there was a similar reaction this year .
the law has a legal framework that is supported by the insurance industry of 350 million £ for all who are looking for a new diagnosis after july 2012 .
in these cases , the plaintiffs receive 80 % of what a court does in a normal compensation process .
about 300 successful applications for the programme will be submitted each year .
andrew morgan thinks like so many mesotheliom sufferers that 350 million £ is a &quot; very good job &quot; of the insurance industry .
&quot; this is a deal of insurers for insurance companies who are saying &quot; i am sure that they will not be too big a sum .
milieu &apos;s report on the implementation of the directive on pension rights was also presented by mike penning , then labour and pension minister .
but both pension and morgan gave to the fact that , given seven deaths , the number of people suffering from hunger and disease is increasing every day .
&quot; people are so suffering and need help today , &quot; said penning during the second hearing .
to this day , graham abbott has been in the hands of prof. loic lang-lazdunski .
after their initial consultation , the committee on legal affairs and the internal market recommended an operation that he could not dream of , unlike tom treasure .
this was confirmed by a radiation therapy and a chemical therapy .
abbott felt like a strong man .
&quot; this is of course the most important thing , &quot; says abbott .
this is always seen in patients .
there is something that i would like to make you move on .
if you are tired , it &apos;s a quick and bad thing .
graham abbott signed up in march 2012 to operation .
at the end of august he had been the last of the six chemotherapy cycles .
after-cancer-the-eye no evidence of the disease .
then i had the opportunity to visit a scan in march 2014 .
there were several cancer cases in the area of my breast .
i have just been 50 .
this is not life-threatening .
this is a life-long process .
again , the abbott signed six chemotherapy cycles , and the first one was in the united states .
now is not a trace of tumors .
but the process is physically and mentally unpleasant .
you must think of practical things - about the money , if i do not go any further , for example , or show my wife how the boiler time setting works .
if you have bad news , you will be negatively affected .
you must look forward , mr president .
as the father of ellie , 16 , and tamsin , 14 , he is not always easy .
&quot; for parents , this is difficult , &quot; he says .
it is hard to know what to say .
when i first started my diagnosis , i said to my girls that i had a disease that would cause me not to be old .
they responded very differently .
tamsin is very healthy and very popular .
they told me that they were not going to get a lot of annotations .
ellie was reluctant .
she did not say much .
such talks are something that all the cancers of the world must make through .
but for mesotheliography trades , such talks are not driven by hope , not by a trace of hope for survival .
the disease ( as it did in the end for stephen jackson ) causes a great deal of damage to the health .
as andrew morgan says , &quot; mesotheliom is not life-threatening .
body insoles are used to treat the skin of the skin .
asbestos fibres used for reinforcing coke pots and for greater heat resistance are used in the production of fibres .
plinius the elder describes asbestos .
it has been a tissue that is not flammable .
i have napkins from them at festssen in the fireplaces .
the use of modern commercial asbestos begins in italy , where it is used to produce paper ( also coins ) and cloth .
important asbestos mines are being used in canada and south africa and are being sold in america , italy and russia shortly afterwards .
it is the ideal insulation material for the steam bath machines and turbines of industrial revolution .
the global asbestos production is increasing to more than 30,000 tons a year .
statisticians from prudential identify a premature death rate in which those who are infected with asbestos are given no life-insurance .
nellie is a member of the royal family of the royal family .
dr. william cooke says that asbestos particles are not present in the lungs without any doubt the main cause of death .
this is the first case of this kind .
kershaw ’ s employer , turner bros asbestos , assumes no liability .
it will not be possible to pay compensation .
during world war ii , the city was built intensively , one of the most deadly places of contact with asbestos .
voluntary waiver of the sector &apos;s import of food blue meat is a good idea .
a court of appeal confirms the first successful person compensation action in the uk for contamination of asbestos .
the global asbestos production is increasing to more than 4,213,000 tons a year .
britain imports 1394 000 tonnes .
a health and safety expert is also required in the uk to inform all companies that are using asbestos about the purchase of the license .
the import and export of data from blue and brown dwarfs is carried out by law in the united kingdom .
any use of asbestos is prohibited in the united kingdom .
the mesotheliom law is being adopted in the united kingdom .
compensation for damages is provided by eur 350 million .
asbestos is available in more than 50 countries , white asbestos is still used in many countries on earth as low-cost materials .
the worldwide production is around 2 million tonnes per year .
china is refusing hong kong the right to a government election , demonstrators swear in retaliation , and the chinese government is blaming retaliation for retaliation , and the chinese government for retaliation .
on sunday , the chinese parliament decided , despite the increased calls for democratic reforms , to vote against the nomination of candidates for the 2017 elections by hong kong &apos;s electorate .
this approach fueled the long-announced debate on the future of hong kong .
the decision of the chinese people ’ s congress allows the communist leaders to continue to ignore all non-peking-loyal candidates .
&quot; this is not unexpected , but it makes us angry , &quot; said right-wing expert emily lamu , chairman of the democratic party .
this is not what we want to see in beijing .
we have asked the people of hong kong to be commended .
and it is clear that we are dealing with an authoritarian regime that is not in the same position .
in his defence of china ’ s decision , li fei , vice secretary general of the standing committee of the national people ’ s congress , said that approval of public nominations in the hong kong government elections was a chaotic exercise .
since 1997 , when britain was in control of hong kong , china has been a major contributor to china ’ s economy , with the inhabitants losing control of hong kong from 2017 .
the chinese leadership presented the decision of sunday as a democratic breakthrough , because it was clear to hong kong &apos;s citizens that there should be a direct election , but the decision also makes it clear that the chinese leadership has to follow the process through a closely ministerial of beijing .
after a new clause , only candidates who have a love for the country and love for hong kong will be allowed to be admitted .
the decision follows a summer in which some of the largest and most public-impact projects are being held in hong kong for several years .
behind the prodemocratic campaign in hong kong , the movement occulpy central with love is standing .
on sunday evening , we had a few hours after the meeting of the european parliament , with hundreds of people from the occupying forces , who were in the rain , in front of the headquarters in hong kong .
in the demonstration , the organizers said that their movement had a new stage of civil disobedience .
they made it impossible to do so , however , apparently to deal with problems with the authorities .
in an online communication , the organizers told that the conference was going to &quot; promote the appointment of the central district as a last resort &quot; .
i am sorry , say , but i am not sure that all the opportunities for dialogue are being exploited today and that the occupation of the central district will definitely take place .
the authorities in hong kong have been working hard for days on the beijing announcement .
the riots will be triggered by the feeling of many in hong kong that they are slowly losing control of their city .
the train from people to mainland increases the competition for products and services .
moreover , fear of being forced to accept hong kong &apos;s values such as democracy and freedom of speech is growing under the growing pressure of beijing .
some criticized the demonstrations by the occupy central-movement , as they did not stop business operations - the lifeline of hong kong - and they did so .
&quot; the protests that we heard about are likely to have a great economic impact , depending on how many people are involved and how long they are going to continue , &quot; said legal expert regine isp , who has the movement for a long time .
we do not want to raise fears that hong kong will be out of control .
this impression is bad for investment .
the state-controlled media of china reported that the chinese government has recently reported on the pro-democracy activists in hong kong as being threatened by western powers .
in this summer , activists organised an unofficial referendum on the constitution ’ s electoral rights , in which 780,000 people participated - more than a fifth of the electorate in hong kong .
in july , tens of thousands participated in one of the largest democratic demonstrations in the region ’ s history .
the tradition of school leaving balls in the us is now being extended to universities , where frehmen are performing on the same private plane .
we are pleased to have this demand .
to make a particularly impressive appearance at the university , the first conference room was opened in the year 2000 .
mr stewart also said that the service is a security feature of the system .
this service is an ideal alternative for students who would otherwise like to study their habits in a dangerously overloaded car through the country .
together with our new vif options we are looking forward to working with you this year to ensure that the students can get to know the university with a minimum of effort and a maximum of luxury .
a company specific is a person who said that no new accounting rules have been introduced , as the service is only just introduced .
the company informed the company that the company had not yet received any of the scholarships , despite the fees for study .
students today are different in their expectations and demands .
the national student card is a critic of the service as being removed .
megan dunn , vice-president of the nus for higher education , said : &quot; this offer seems to be completely separate from the lives of the majority of students .
many students who have been working with the university this month are facing a crisis of living costs .
feminist criticize racial issues and police behaviour after ferguson
the unarmed teenager is now in a position to take the teenager to the streets of the city .
participants raised their hands in the air and sang , &quot; hands high , not sliding , &quot; while they were before the funeral .
after two weeks of protests in distant galicia , mo , due to the shooting of the unarmed teenager michael brown , i noticed that the blogger was miriam zila perez realizing a change in the content .
after their experience , white feminists continue to rely on gender .
while tensions in the middle west have increased and the country has grown , the us has seen perez respond by white women as a 100 % increase in the rate of racial restraint .
compared to the answers black and white women shortly after the shots of 9 august , the personal essays with tips and tricks like &quot; thoughts to ferguson came from a white woman &quot; and &quot; feminism is not only about the woman .
but for perez , this was an important change .
&quot; i do not think that you can be a woman in feminism who has no knowledge of the white and has privileges on such a high standard , &quot; she said .
people feel that they have been pushed to do something about the incidents .
it is characteristic of the crisis that we are experiencing .
for english-speaking professor koritha mitchell from the ohio state university , the ferguson has raised problems that black people have been exposed to every day , which are not considered to be women &apos;s issues .
&quot; i can do something funny on facebook about me and my partner and i get 150 likes of everywhere .
if i had something to say about how coloured in your own country under siege , i would say that silence is a matter of anguish .
&quot; how can it be safe for women to speak publicly about a relationship that is not about security in the public space ? &quot; asked her .
for black women like mitchell , who have been breed , sex and sexuality in the history of the usa , there is no density limit .
for you , black women do not have the luxury to be the themes clean .
while white women are now discussing the themes of race and gender in feminist mainstreaming , the feminist angela hattery says that professor müller and gender-research at george macon university .
&quot; between 1865 and 1890 , at least 10,000 black men were yellow and black , and the justification was almost always the rape of a white woman , &quot; said hattery .
white women had to be involved in history , to make the lynchkar murder justifiable .
for hattery , the division between white and black women came at the point where the white men fought for freedom .
&quot; they met the decision to be in favour of the right to vote for women , and the right to vote for black should come later , &quot; said hattery .
if you remember such things , you will see that the european union is not a community of colourful women .
we have our job not done well .
we have never seen black women helping to protect their husbands and sons .
even after women were forced to vote in 1920 , the majority of the population still took a decade to get a job out of the lynch in the association of soviets .
the group was formed almost 40 years after the original request for assistance from black women , says mitchell .
for mitchell , the flood of white feminist reactions to the problems caused by ferguson is , in fact , a matter of police behaviour and racial discrimination .
&quot; would it not be great if the activist , who has such traditional feminists platforms , were to have the right to education of a child so seriously ?
feminist of the second generation who have lost their career in the struggle for reproductive rights and access to contraception .
the famous white feather is a popular activist gloria steiner who went to the hospital two weeks after the shooting of michael brown .
&quot; i hope that women who have a different , but parallel , relationship will be able to find a way to help the body .
although steiner is known for a rather intersectional feminism in which rapid and racial feminism is addressed , the most important issues are the gender .
christina sommer , research researcher at the american enterprise institute and austrian author , has published a book about the history of the company .
there is now hundreds of special programs for girls and young women , but almost nothing for boys .
but when the white house recently opened a small program , my brother &apos;s home , i was told that it was not vulnerable .
the relationship between the police and the black community is not the only problem that the police have to take priority over the mainstream feminism .
after the us border police had arrested almost 63,000 unaccompanied minors at the southwest border of the country this year , the us border police issue is also on the agenda .
andrea mercado , co-chairman of we belong toolkit , has been an organization that has made women responsible for immigration reform .
&quot; these speak for themselves , &quot; said mercado .
if the great majority of the working visas are given to male immigrants , then they are women , who are accompanying them , in a position where they are responsible for domestic violence .
&quot; these stories are a lasting success in the women &apos;s organisations , &quot; she said .
&quot; pork house &quot; in ipswich stands for sale .
the image of a product for sale was created by real estate agents who were clearly aware that the property was a big pig , which it was able to comfortably buy in the living room .
the hotel is located in a quiet area , just a few minutes from the beach and the city centre .
the details included the possibility of a picture of the living room of the house - including a pig .
real estate agents contact us for your needs .

ebola : the epidemic is burdening west africa ’ s economy with its economy , and the economy is burdening it with a heavy burden on west africa ’ s economy .
the ebola epidemic in west africa is also a serious blow to the economy .
markets are orphaned - and international companies are moving away .
the devastating ebola epidemic has enabled the economy of west africa to face a severe blow .
the harvest is rotated on the fields that miners are leaving and the markets are orphaned - the virus has hit the region hard .
some international companies are already on a distance .
&quot; the ebola epidemic is not only a medical crisis , but also an economic one &quot; , judges the head of the african development bank , donald kaberuka .
liberia is the hardest hit .
&quot; it is a total disaster , we lose very much money &quot; , says alhambra , the president of the united states .
on the market , only who can buy food or something for disinfection against ebola will be able to buy .
liberia is the hardest hit by the virus , but it is the most vulnerable of all .
recently , the health authorities said that the disease was in every corner of the country .
in guinea-sierra leone and nigeria , too , the virus has spread .
in total , more than 1500 people died , thousands more were in their infancy .
foreign companies are recruiting employees from abroad .
across the resource centers , the us and other countries , firms are setting up their business .
foreign companies such as the steel company arcelor mittal are withdrawing their employees , several international airlines are flying the affected regions no longer .
the local people also have a reactive attitude : few merchants are still leaving their homes .
in some areas in sierra leone and liberia , which are suffering from quarantine , the situation is getting worse , for example , for export .
farmers dare not to pay for the harvest their homes .
food is scarce and it is scarce .
&quot; people will always be less travelling , &quot; says phillipe de vreyer , paris expert , for the economy of west africa .
the man , for example , who is usually on the market and his vegetables are sold , is better off at home .
the population therefore receives the consequences of the epidemic directly and urgently .
on the markets , the market is diminishing in basic foodstuffs such as rice .
at the same time , the highly dependent international region is threatening to damage the image - with far-reaching consequences .
the greatest danger is that international firms will lose the area over a long period of time , philippe hugon says of french think tank irius .
it is crucial to know how far and how long the virus will spread .
investors may also have the impression that &quot; it is dangerous to invest in guinea , sierra leone and liberia &quot; .
the disease is also burdensome to the stringent national budgets of the member states .
the disease is also burdensome for the already harsh national budgets of the countries concerned .
the credit rating agencies are not responsible for the quality of the credit ratings they provide .
the african development bank is promising to help the health systems of the countries concerned with 60 million dollars ( 45 million euros ) .
the effects of the crisis are already evident in nigeria , where only a few ebola cases have been diagnosed .
although the oil rich region in southern niger is a region that has not been affected so far .
but elsewhere , the problems are still many , for fear of infection .
reservations can also be made in hotels .

on 23 and 24 april 1994 , the shooter association published its 30-year founding anniversary .

josef schmalzl was born in böllerrecherrechtrent .
a major challenge for the &quot; böllers &quot; and for the club as a whole was the alignment of the bavarian böllertreffen 2005 .
in many hours volunteer work , the association &apos;s members have made a significant contribution to the spaces and the shooting facilities in the berngauer hof and thus to the latest state of the art .

nato wants to conclude agreements with russia without breaking agreements .
nato will be strengthened by the planned deployment of troops in eastern europe following the ukrainian crisis .
nato secretary-general anders fogh rasmussen said on monday in brussels that nato is keeping to the founding agreement of the nato russia alliance .
the nato chief , mr president , accused the russian &quot; one tie of a brutal breach &quot; of the agreement .
&quot; today we must face reality , &quot; said the president of nato , who is not a partner , &quot; said rasmussen .
documents and statements by the russian federation have shown that the russian authorities are not going to treat us as an opponent .
stronger nato presence
rasmussen also announced that the nascent nato presence in eastern europe will be strengthened .

the negotiations are scheduled for next saturday , said the russian energy minister alexander lukashenko on monday .

merkel speaks powerfulness : toll is &quot; clearly &quot; coming .
now , the commission is committed to making a clear commitment to this .
a licence to use all complex and complex details is , however , not .
hartwig concerns about the cdu against the pkw toll have made csu the most eye-catching .
chancellor merkel has already said that the eu has a duty to take action in the face of persistent opposition from her cdu .
&quot; to be quite clear , the commission is in the coalition agreement , which is to be concluded , &quot; said the party leader , &quot; the president of the commission , on monday after meetings of the cdu top bodies in berlin .
a detailed picture of the model was taken by merkel , however .
in the black and red government programme , &apos; certain parameters &apos; are mentioned .
the federal minister of transport , alexander dobrindt ( csu ) , has made a proposal , and this is now being worked on .
the nrw-cdu insists , however , on their no to toll immediately on all roads .
merkel stressed that the financial minister , wolfgang schäuble ( cdu ) , too , is constructively engaged in the deliberations on a draft law .
the issue of the report has also been discussed with dobrindt on other ways of increasing private capital to invest in infrastructure , such as in broadband .
&quot; there is nothing special about it , &quot; schäuble had a great &quot; mirror on sunday .
csu-chef horst seehofer warned darufner that in the cabinet toll concepts against the lead minister would be developed .
cdu-bundesvize armin laschet reaffirmed his objections .
&quot; the coalition partner agreement went beyond the idea that all circles and federal roads would be built . &quot;
in this respect , it is an important signal that seehofer has now announced that he will be speaking again about the subject .
opposition to the plans is also expressed by the cdu national associations .
the background to these concerns is that tolls will not affect small border traffic to neighbouring countries .
seehotel seehofer had no problem with the toll criticism from ranks of the cdu coalition .
the left sees the plans as a step forward in the face of the union &apos;s dispute .
&quot; the murks-toll is dead &quot; , said party leader , bernd riexinger , the &quot; new osnabrücker zeitung &quot; ( monday ) .
&quot; with the toll , the minister fails . &quot; dobrindt wants to build a vignette obligation on all german roads , which will start in 2016 .
domestic and international car owners may not , according to the coalition agreement , be charged with additional costs .
therefore , they should be able to use the vehicle tax to compensate fully for the tolls .
the model must not exclude foreign drivers under eu law , however , because of their nationality .
genetic disorder often misdiagnosed , often with the help of a genetic diagnosis , is often misdiagnosed and is often misdiagnosed .
a british says that she thought she was going to die as a result of a misdiagnosis for many years .
karin rodgers lived almost their entire youth in the belief that he was only a few years away from his home .
she suffered in fact from the charcot marie-tooth disease ( cmt ) - one group of inherited disorders that affected nerves outside the brain and body .
charity care cmt uk announced that the new version of the cmt + + + system is a common problem for people with cmt , because so little is known about this disease .
about 23,000 people in britain are likely to suffer from cmt , which can cause motor disorders such as muscle weakness , unsafe gear , and crumbling toes .
sufferers also suffer from deafness .
as rodgers 13 , he believed that he was the only person who could be able to believe in friedrich-ataxie ( fa ) - a disease with very poor chances of survival .
rodgers thought that she would be throwing away in a wheelchair before she would be 18 , and before her 30th birthday .
the mother of two children who are now 51 years old , said : &apos; when a child was a child , i knew i was not doing the same thing as the others .
i fell constantly and i was still taking my breath .
i have never been able to play rollshoe or skateboard with other children and was often forced to do so in school because of my way to go and walk .
rodgers said that they were at the age of 13 , after several operations to relieve their achilles heals and stress , and that they were not going to stop their medical acts when their doctor left the room and read what they were doing .
&quot; i felt like guilty , because i was curious and i was not interested in what i said .
when i was given a reply , i was shocked and scared .
i thought that the first time i was in a wheelchair , i was 18 and i thought that i would die with 25 , and i would gradually lose all my skills .
i made all this on my own with me and planned my own betting .
she said that when she was 17 she was told that she had a good deal of skills and that she had not taken on as much as she had imagined and asked her doctor .
he was simply standing up and hugged .
i believe you have something more to do with life &apos;s risk .
after some genetic tests , the skin has been detected .
&quot; when he explained to me what cmt was , i felt like a child .
charity care cmt uk has a cmt-awareness-month started to develop on this disease .
stable field beams a. d. berni diether has been working since the closure of the former military training place in the former military academy in germany .
for almost ten years , the former truce exercises have been held in münsingen .
nevertheless , there is still a new issue every month of fatal ammunition at the heart of the biosphere reserve schwäbische alb .
the grenades are sometimes even more dangerous than they are on the ground .
an earring is a common occurrence in the early days of the explosives .
in december 2004 , the last sharply shot was shot on the exercises square münsingen , which was named after 110 years of military operation at the end of 2005 .
since then , the 6500 hectare of area has been the core of the biosphere reserve .
tax burden on business people in the washington area is increasing with the economic recovery .
a recovery in the economy means more customers , more sales and new jobs .
it also means higher taxes .
state and local tax authorities are responsible for the tax revenue of companies in the country last year , while the economic recovery has accelerated , thus creating a new study in the last week , and companies in the area of washington formed no exception .
companies in the district , maryland and virginia paid together 27.6 billion euros .
the government and local tax burden of companies increased by more than eur 4.5 billion last year to 671 billion .
government taxes increased more than the local taxes .
more than half of the tax revenue of the district , 56 % , comes from corporate taxes , while 36 % of the revenues go to maryland .
virginia achieves the lowest operating costs at 28 percent .
a large part of the increase in tax revenue is due to a recovery in real estate values for companies , say the researchers say , what to increase the tax revenue .
while a large part of these profits are generated from large states such as california , new york , and texas , the process seems to be very complicated for washington as well .
companies in the district , maryland and virginia paid together over $ 10 billion in government and local real estate taxes last year , in comparison to $ 9.6 billion in 2012 - a rise in the course of a year by 4.2 % .
but the apparent recovery in the housing values is not in maryland as effective as in increasing the government and local investment .
companies in virginia and d.c. pay almost half of their public and local taxes in the form of property taxes .
&quot; in maryland , the following is happening : a large part of the real estate , especially in the tax area around the d.c. , is in the hands of government or non-profit organizations that do not pay real-estate taxes , &quot; said douglas managing director douglas lindholm .
maryland is therefore forced to take a much more interest in the income tax , for example , in order to provide the same services that other states offer .
the recent recovery in tax revenue from companies can no longer be attributed solely to the recovery of the property market .
corporate income seems to be also recovering , so the data .
companies in the region reported that the income tax on the state organizations was $ 350 million , and that the government had to pay $ 2.1 billion in 2012 .
maryland took 1 billion $ in corporate income , and the company ’ s highest amount of revenue .
during the trend in the same direction , the number of local inhabitants increases .
the rise rates in the district of new york were the highest in the world , at 4.3 % , while the increase in maryland was significantly higher , 4.9 % .
only virginia reported a lower average tax rate of € 4,1 per cent .
virginia has a 6 % stake in all three areas of office , which is significantly lower in the group ’ s three divisions ( there are fixed corporate tax rates in all three ) .
the company tax rate in maryland is 8.7 % , and in the district it is 4.8 % .
a similar study by the us chamber of commerce at the beginning of this year showed that in virginia , lower state and local corporate taxes are required and a better overall tax climate prevails than in maryland .
in the study , the district was not investigated .
despite the advantages , virginia is under pressure from its southern neighbour .
north carolina is the country with laws to reduce its tax rates in the past year from 6.9 % to 6 % , the same rate as virginia , and the rate is expected to fall to 5 % next year .
if the state continues to increase its income targets next year , it could be a good way of reducing corporate tax rates .
in the meantime , it seems that small businesses in the washington area are better off , and they are therefore paying more government and local taxes , so the recent study shows .
corporate taxes , which are perceived as personal income taxes by small businessmen - a transitional structure that allows for the most small businesses to be organised - in the district , maryland and virginia rose by more than 20 % last year .
the researchers say that the price trend is increasing and the increase in corporate taxes is increasing throughout the country probably this year .
however , the washington area could be lagging behind if the prospects for reducing spending on research by the federal government were to focus on the labour market in the region .
partner city : german bier for guangzhou and guangzhou .
hops and malt - also in china a popular combination .
german bier enjoys a very good reputation in china .
frankfurt ’ s partner city in china now wants a brewery and also hopes to have an air direct connection between the two cities .
german bier , used in the frankfurt book fair partner city guangzhou - so the german beer is a strong desire of the official visitors .
&quot; we would be very pleased if a german brewery could prove to be established in our city , &quot; said the vice-president of the german association of the south china metropolis , li yiwei , in this week &apos;s visit to a spd delegation .
time and again , the functionalist of the ruling communist party of china has been accused of having misled the twelve million people in this case .
guangzhou , the country &apos;s largest city , is home to the largest city in the world .
therefore , the member states have the purchasing power to adapt more quickly to german beer .
the hessen spd chairman thorsten schäfer gümbel , who is the german political delegation , said to the host that the host was going to be in germany after a possible partner for the project .
&quot; for beer , it does not take much : good water , grain and joy &quot; , he added .
this joy of life is already expressed by mr li , flattering him out of the host .
the commission then met with a request from the guangheri office to investigate the situation of the guangzhou government , but with red wine , which was served for the meal .
the chinese tsinghtao brand is based on german brewing art .
tsingtao-bier is produced according to the german purity law .
more business
a second wish of chinese hosts would be to have direct flights between frankfurt and guangzhou .
the lufthansa had used to offer the flight earlier , but in 2012 , for economic reasons .
&quot; it would be loving again , &quot; he said , &quot; the local politician was convinced .
&quot; the business traffic between our two cities is increasing . &quot;
at present , travellers would have to take the diversion via changsha in the province of hunan , li complained .
the administration of the province of guangdong , whose capital is guangzhou , also hopes to be able to reach the air .
the vice-president goddess , the province , chen yunxian , asked this wish to be expressed in his conversation with the social democrats .
&quot; this is a very good idea &quot; , he replied , &quot; i am a great fan of the chinese deputy minister , li jinjun , a german intimate connoisseur .
well-tended partnership with the local market and the local market .
the lieutenant vice party leader , mr guangherita , hopes that the next elections will be held in frankfurt next year .
li yiwei was a member of the main team , but not yet in this position .
he came only this year to take office after his predecessor had been arrested for corruption .
the local market in the region , wan qinglian , had to go .
the action taken against the officials of guangzhou is part of a nationwide campaign against corruption in the party and administration , which is being conducted by head of state xi jinping with rigour .
the new leader li yiddish is now in a position to win the election for an american company before he takes up his party career , which is highly unusual in china ’ s communist party .
before taking office , he was the first to speak in a foreign affairs committee .
frankfurt is officially more than a dozen urban areas .
the connection to the 9000 kilometres away guangler is a very popular destination for those who want to be kept on both sides , for example with a school exchange .
last year , the 25-year-old existence of the german-chinese association was celebrated .
the south china metropolis on the perl river is connected with its economic power almost as strong as the whole of hessen .
next year , the commission intends to increase gross domestic product by eur 250 billion .
the family of joan rivers &quot; expresses the thumbs &quot; .
joan rivers is a member of the european parliament since her arrival in a hospital in new york city three days ago ; her daughter was unaware of the fact that she was now hoping that the 81-year-old comitee could recover from her illness .
&quot; thanks for your continued support and your support !
we are all pushing the fingers .
her mother was told to sources on thursday after an emergency due to cardiac in a clinic at the upper east side , yorkvisle endoscopy .
the doctors are always ready to go and see you , with a close watch , until you are satisfied with your condition , which remains known as &quot; serious &quot; .
the reactions came from many quarters , including the form of an overwhelming online support package .
environmentally friendly vacuum cleaners and rising salaries are the main reasons for the increasing pay for the cleaner and rising wages .
for cars and vacuum cleaners , which are now in the store , the rules will be stricter in future .
similar to cooling cabinets and washing machines , new vacuum cleaners are being supplied to a label from 1 september , where the buyer can see central data such as the energy efficiency of the device .
for new cars , the chlorine is &quot; euro 6 &quot; .
there is also more money for ruminants , which are getting a federal rebate , and which is worth eur 10.25 per annum .
amazing video poker is a game for $ 1.04 billion , and is a great game for $ 1.04 billion .
amazing video confirmed the first time that the information was available on monday morning : the online retail channel - and video producer - was online and a lot of other things - bought the video streaming service twitch for 1.04 billion $ ( $ 1.04 billion ) .
the announcement comes surprisingly , not because no one wants to take over twitch , but because female researchers widely suspect that the twitch is the company to buy .
three months ago , it looked as if the council had banned the sale of twitch to the google video service for a cool billion .
twitch , which was only three years ago known as justin.tv , was known as a general streaming service .
instead , it quickly became a platform for players who want to improve their bravouch in games , a &quot; youtube game &quot; for live games , and thus a more insider .
the twitch interface .
and &apos; let &apos;s play the game &apos; , a video genre that shows better results than the original ( mostly older ) game .
it is just as if yota youtube is often called when you use twitch .
it is a mystery that the council of ministers has decided to deal with youtube .
all you need to do at the moment is to make that statement by emma shear , president of twitch : &apos; we have not chosen amazon .
another mystery is that , frankly , the incredible success of twitch .
for snowboarders like me who explain that they prefer sport , rather than watching , the fact that they are not so attractive is hard to understand .
it is one thing to tell a friend at 3 a.m. about the school &apos;s shoulder , while they are walking through resident evil .
all these games could be you just watch .
another problem is that the commission has not yet fully implemented many of the most popular games , so it can be seen without its own control over the perspective .
i admit that the commission is not very well informed about the speed of the rapid transit system in which the roger bannister of our age of electronics has completed their games in record time .
but until such time as a game or humorvirtuosity is involved , his twitch channel is probably not as interesting .
but what do skeptics like me know about it ?
twitch is supported by 55 million different visitors per month and is the fourth largest online resource of visitors to the world .
and how exactly will amazon learn money from it ?
it is difficult to imagine how the european union could be so elegant as to be in amazon instant video .
but twitch has something that every company likes : thousands of young men , who are used as advertising customers , are .
as the chairman of twitch , shear , said , amazon has a lot to offer , and twitch says , &quot; both believe in the future of gaming , &quot; and the medium does not show any signs of shrinking , yet .
on the hill of the castle of burggartenfest was some lot on saturday .
the concept of the organizers was agreed .
despite the strong rain , the sun shines on saturday evening , an estimated 6,200 music fans came to the open air festival in burgundy .
at times , the entrance had to be stopped .
&quot; this was annoying , &quot; said ron smm , one of the organizers .
salzwedel l licht und fun .
for two spanish words , maxim sachraj and ron sem have the name amula .
this is because the open air in the salzwedeler burggarten is supposed to be brightness in the day and evening through various shows .
well , and the fun comes anyway .
this was already evident in the early evening when the commission &apos;s first visitors came to the open air .
a festival for all generations had the organizers promised .
and that is what you have done .
around the supply levels on the burgundy garden meadow , salzwedeler , as well as guests from the surrounding area , had a comfortable time .
it was a very successful and successful show , and the band was able to perform in the same concert .
and the right across the generations .
while the some are looking for blankets on the extra carved white sand on the beach bar , others are still looking for a place to drink a quarter of wine in the vinothek .
but also in the case of children &apos;s critics , the volunteers had to be literally all their hands .
the larger used the gravel tables or participants to form a scapeboard workshop .
until the great rain came .
just before 5.30 p.m. , the police crasted on the visitors , especially in families of the children seeking the wide and dry .
but the attractiveness of the festival did not stop .
&quot; there were more people than expected , &quot; said ron smm , the chief of the &quot; success on earth &quot; .
i therefore oppose any repetition of the great party next year .
although the commission is not entirely satisfied with the content and size of the event , sem made a first record on sunday in relation to the popular vote .
as an irritating person , he described that in the meantime the entrance was stopped .
obviously , the security company was too unwilling to make a booking .
the result : some people who have already paid have not been able to enter the site .
the response was very positive and the result was a very good one .
in the first cautious estimate , the saltwater broker co-organizer spoke of about 1200 visitors who were in the burggarten .
there were problems with the sound technology .
the saltwood hip-hop band blocks the hip-hop band from the first day of the show .
the technicians were unable to provide a half-way reasonable service .
the planned shiha-loads are not able to be built because the tents were not ready due to a tyre crash .
&quot; next year we will see you in the process &quot; , says the organizer .
the premiere of the amula open air festival was a success of the number of visitors .
and that in bad weather .
however , the organizers have made some mistakes that were not corrected for the first time , but the second time they did remove the problem .
in the social network facebook too , the organizers must make criticism .
&quot; sorry , but for twelve euros has been paid more . &quot;
&quot; you have unfortunately a little bit taken over , &quot; says ele zimmermann at the same place .
others see the initial problems not quite as closely .
i find it very good that some people are not only stupid , but also really trying to do something about their feet .
hats off ! &apos; , writes stephanie jenß to the amula .
now the organizers have a year to complete this critical review .
new radom in berkum : watchberg ’ s landmark shrines shrinks
this is expected to be the case .
instead , the ready building part is waiting for the margin to be integrated into the distinctive construction .
the action is in the context of a major measure : almost 50 years after the creation of the space observatory tira , the shell , the so-called radom , is being completely renewed .
the new radom is equipped with a diameter of 47.5 meters a little smaller than the old one .
the size remains unchanged , however , and world record .
the last step to complete the list of new cases is the capping .
the upper quarter of the old case is covered with a white , blue collar .
after that , the last quarter of the new shell will be set up .
if the weather is involved , the action should start at the beginning of this week .
participants will be able to participate in the ice bucket-challenge .
isabelle roberts from the uk shouted so much as her ice-cold water was shouting over her head , that she would cut off the bone structure of her face .
this ice buckle system is a very important step in the fight against the disease .
a woman was taken to hospital and the woman was taken to hospital at the ice bucket-challenge .
isabelle roberts from the uk made a lot of money when her eiskalte water was above her head .
&quot; the water was so cold that it was shouting , and while i did it , i remained my pine .
ice water is transported over 20 years .
isabelle roberts some seconds before the unexpected accident .
i wanted to put my mouth to the end , but that did not happen , the jaw was hated and then i understood that something was not correct .
my mother and sister sat on the floor and made a big effort to laugh almost in the trousers , but i had to go into emergency .
the 20-year-old from britain was taken to hospital to get rid of the pine after the participation in the viral trend in tuesday .
the clip was made into a website and thousands of visitors were taken on facebook and twitter .
do the burgvereins soon retreat in a stranger ?
finally , there have been repeated strife between the two wolfratshauser burgvereins .
now the predecessors think about possible cooperation .
as an example of reconstruction of the wolfratshausen castle , the late richard wagner , who had been in power since the 1930s , led the way .
just a year ago , no good climate prevailed between the burgverein and the friends of wolfratshausen .
the situation in the united states has been very different so far .
now , the two camps are moving to one another : they are to begin talks about a common approach .
this is confirmed by the board of directors of torsten sjöberg ( burgverein ) and herbert piffl ( burgfreunde ) on request from our newspaper .
&quot; i have listened to mr piffl and proposed that we should look at each other , &quot; says sjöberg .
in his view , all members of both clubs could in future be pulled together again .
for example , rapid visible successes can be recorded .
while the burgfreunde around the sudden deceased richard dimbath had been a rebuilding of the castle on the bergwald until the last moment , the castle club around sjöberg stands for &quot; discovery and discovery &quot; .
herbert piffl , the second chairman of the burgfreunde , has declared himself to be very pleased with the call .
since dimbaths died , he has been standing before his burgfriends .
a new chairman is due to be appointed in mid-september in a members &apos; meeting .
at the moment , the association is one of the 40 members according to the 74-year-old .
&quot; after the death of my friend richard , i was able to see the light of day in the club activities out of respect .
according to piffl , the new chairman is then to be appointed to the meeting with the burgverein .
until then , the us and its burgfriends could also afford to take a look at the current mood within their group .
to find a candidate for the presidency is not yet available , piffl says .
&quot; but i am confident that the world will find itself , &quot; he said .
the new chairman should be a wolfratshauser .
the oil zer wool on the project &quot; but very gladly continue to work &quot; .
the different positions in the area of reconstruction are , in the eyes of piffls , likely to remain in the near future .
he acknowledges dimbath as &quot; misionary &quot; , who is always interested in rebuilding the castle .
two similar , already well advanced , projects are being implemented in austria and france , showing that this idea is not a pipe dream .
by high participation of the population and by voluntary help from the whole world , they are a tourist magnet .
piffl : &quot; i was also at the beginning skeptical .
but over time , i have become more and more convinced that the european union is useful to have the project moving forward &quot; .
there is a lot of work to do here .
moreover , the project would be supported by eu subsidies , visitor tickets and potential donations .
&quot; the idea of rebuilding wants to be personal because i do not want to simply overboard , &quot; he hopes that the burgverein will perhaps move a little on this point .
their aim , the story first documented , is &quot; to make the world a better place &quot; .
after that , we could continue .
clever ways to save on uni trainees , books and other related materials .
as the cost of uni-textbooks is more than $ 1,000 per year for many students , the commission ’ s fast two-thirds term plan for the university was considered to be the most clever way to spend .
he invented a temporary agency system for books by students of higher semester and boasting a nominal compensation .
&quot; my mathematics book costs usually 180 $ , but i &apos;m getting it for 10 $ for a semester .
the time allocated to the last semester is too short for 430 $ .
he gave $ 120 .
the collection rooms are equipped with a tv , a telephone , a safe , a safe and a hairdryer .
online shops and creative people are the key to success .
the rental of teachers ’ books is becoming more popular , and so students can book a book a semester for a long time , often at a much cheaper price than when they buy .
neebo inc , the more than 250 university research books in the world , is participating in the &quot; european union-wide web site &quot; , which has been in double-digit since 2011 .
polls in the industry show that around a quarter of the books in the college books are in the uk last spring .
less than half of all textbooks are published , according to the national association of colleges .
here is the one-time for the best decorations .
online buy online buy online buy online buy online buy online buy online .
some new books cost only one third of the price for which they are paid in the campus bookstore .
the ninth edition of &quot; calculus &quot; is available in german only .
used buy the product you need to buy ?
if you don &apos;t like the notes of other or normal usage tracks , you can use them as a way to get them to work .
&quot; calculus &quot; is a tool that is used on chegg.com for 93.49 $ .
matt casaday , 25 , final student at the university of brigham young university , will tell you that he is working on amazon.com 42 cents for a used version of the &quot; strategic game &quot; .
the book was newly published for $ 48 .
academic experts such as ingrid bracey , lee schubert , head of the university of massachusetts , have been working on this project for several years .
sometimes the updates are not available for the seminar work .
in such cases , older issues can often be used for a fraction of the cost of the latest issue .
in addition to cheese-making and amazon , half.com is also available from ebay inc a popular alternative for used books .
rent a car in the costa de la luz for your holidays in spain .
the rental of teachers ’ books is a matter of consideration , if you want to make them reasonably well , remember that you must return them and you must repay the books after the course is completed .
you can buy more than 80 percent of the costs of a newly purchased book .
a student could , for example , &quot; calculus &quot; for the duration of a semester for about $ 20 .
find out about the terms of the business at the company you rent , even about the criminal fees , the possible costs for the writing of notes and / or signatures .
renters pay attention : if you book not returned , you can leave the penalty to the price of a new book even exceeding the price of a new book .
e-books are a way to make your online bookings more comfortable and more secure .
e-books are also available instead of conventional textbooks .
sometimes these books are de facto rented , by a form of electronic license for a certain period of time for wholesalers such as amazon.com , chegg and barnes &amp; noble inc .
upon check-in photo identification and credit card is required .
bracey says that students in literary curriculums often have the best offers , as many classics are downloaded free of charge today , while scientific and engineering students are free to use .
to be sure , look around .
joe gault , 29 , the next president of the pepper group , will be taking part in the peppers law school in the near future .
and before an online order you should check , so gault , if the book is actually available .
this lesson learnt from the experience of the harsh tour .
he bought a book , that was published four weeks ago and paid for it to the full price at the college book store .
why &quot; guardians of the galaxy &quot; is not a cash battle ?
&quot; the exterior of the hotel is a bit of a &quot; old &quot; , but it is a little bit of a &quot; old &quot; style .
the cd-rom image file , which is customized to cameron diaz , played at the opening weekend only 14.6 million dollars , while children &apos;s films like &quot; dragon &apos;s &quot; were easily made 2 &quot; also on the revenue .
an article by the telegram film critic robinson , published in the magazine , suggests that the first two films were made in the world , with the lack of quality in films .
collin described 2014 as &quot; the worst of the year &quot; for children &apos;s films and described it as &quot; drachenzähmen easily made 2 &quot; as a purely &quot; functional &quot; fantasy continuation .
in films for a slightly older version of the target group , however , it seems as if the quality of the films does not necessarily solve the problem .
in july , entertainment and the internet compared the internet to the average cinema size of the united states .
the results are based on the opinion of the cinematographic visitors and film critics , and suggest that the film festivals will be similar to last year &apos;s .
some commentators say that the development on its own is due to changing habits of seeing and the growing popularity of web streaming services such as netflix .
director of the film jon favreau , who is currently working on disney &apos;s soon to be released jungle book film , said to the dutch tv channel hollywood reporter : &quot; i think the times are changing .
we must accept this and not try to put a stop to the past .
unlike other countries that are currently weak , the us is not able to maintain a high level of net flix income in recent times .
last summer , the council of directors criticized steven spielberg for not having been able to get involved in the film .
in the light of the current downturn , the us argues that the us is not the world ’ s bleak prediction .
due to the economic crisis that is expected in the summer of 2015 , including asenger : age of ultron , minions and jurassic world , other representatives of the film industry are more optimistic :
the producer of x-men , simunon kinberg , decided to describe the decline in cash results recently as simply &quot; cyclically &quot; and said to hölywood records that the company is not yet in the process of summer .
when a few years ago , the 2nd table tennis district class was set up for the purpose of streamlining the ligen division , the hotel is a step in the right direction .
now the german table tennis federation has decided to add a third league .
the result : if you don &apos;t have grown up , you have gone .
for example , göttingen ’ s highest team torpedo has won the top ten of the category in the upper liga release , but is still playing in the coming season .
fourth-class , torpedo &apos;s ladies are still very strong , despite their marvellous passage into the regional league .
the young and girls of torpedo start in the lower saxony league , as well as the boys of the sc weende .
the sg lenglerers and the torpedo reserve are entering the final phase of the new association league .
the ladies play a role in the ttv geismar in the association league , which is torpedo second in the provincial league .
what is expected of the composition is a better district class , but it is now the new district object .
here tsv sv sieulingen , vfb lödingsen , torpedo iii , geismar , einbeck , hamenstedt , bovender sv , langenholtensen , fc .
in the district sliga , as regional representatives dransfeld and the sc weende play , in the district class of the ttc ii , red-weiss , the bovender sv ii and the teams of the ttc .
güntersen , the ttc and the ttv geismar ii are here with the most important players .
in the district sliga you will run torpedo iii and sattenhausen / wöllmarshausen .
with nine teams each , the team will be able to win the first prize in the nine teams , each with nine teams .
the sc wende sends its girls to the small district sliga .
the district authorities also have a role to play in the scw youth - there is another torpedo ii race - but it is not complete .
in a district class , the mentally smiths , tuspo weende and bovender sv go to the season .
in the first season of the newly established regionsverband start the two goddesses district clubs with a total of nine teams each .
in the west stage , the two teams are red and white ii , bovender sv iii , laubach ii , torpedo iv and the v , mtv grone , dransfelder sc ii , mielenhausen .
in the east asian region , the most important are the sattenhausen / wöllmarshausen , nikolausberg and landolfshausen .
the ladies &apos; circle lounge is made of satin leather with a black leather upper and a black leather upper .
this is still better than in the district of osterode , where it is not at all a women team at the level of their travel .
what is striking is that none of the six 2nd circle classes have been reached , here the difference between the innovative and proactive cycle of the board of directors will have to take some thought .

the demonstrators are calling for the resignation of the head of government to whom they accuse electoral fraud .
the police told me that there was a kilometre from the prime minister &apos;s residence , nawaz sharif , to the monday , but that he was again in the middle of clashes with some 3000 demonstrators with security forces .
after hospital information , a policeman was injured .
at the weekend at least three people were killed and more than 500 were injured when demonstrators tried to prove sharia ’ s residence .

qadri expressed his similar view .
khan also accuses sharif of being a parliamentary election last may by cheating .
qadri calls for the resignation of central and provincial governments .
then a transitional government should have the electoral system reformed and elections should be called for .
more than 40 000 security forces are in operation , with the aim of protecting the government quarter .
the demonstrators had initially peaceful and had been able to stand in front of parliament until khan and qaddi had left them at the weekend to take a stand on sharifs ’ residence .
hütteldorfer after second season victory on place three of the table .
with the 2 : 0 via grödig has for rapid a bitter week on sunday a conciliatory end .
&quot; the victory is very liberating &quot; , said coach zoran barisic , whose team with the money in the europe leadership awards on thursday is an intermediate low .
&quot; the most successful experience in the history of the company was the very important one &quot; , confirmed captain and torschutze steffen hofmann , who was on the third place with green white .
schrammel dreamtor brings rapid to siegerstraße rapid with the second season of victory the right response to the disappointment against helsinki .
&quot; we wanted to respond positively , &quot; said foreign defender thomas schrammel , who was with his splendid leadership volley of the sixteenth in the 14th minute the soft on victory .
&quot; i have thought that i hadn &apos;t seen all the frustration of thursday and i was snoring him . &quot;
as a shrine on 13 november , the first german film to be released in a federal league , the german bundesliga team was still available for ried .
the first championship meeting took place in the rapid-dress .
&quot; for me , this is something very special , i am from the rapid growth of the young &quot; , said schrammel .
due to the short-term becken-bessur of mario pavelic back in the early days , schrammel came from the left to the right defensive side and made his thing very good there .
he has enough experience to be able to maintain this position .
the gate has been earned , it has been opened this year already some assists , &quot; praises barissic .
team shows character schrammel delivered also the flank to the 2 : 0 by hofmann to a good hour , which finally made the decision .
because we could have been warned by our guests .
&quot; thank god we have today something happier &quot; , he noted .
barisic has been in the process of &quot; being &quot; in many games beforehand than it is today &quot; - against &quot; the strongest team that has been in this season at this stadium &quot; .
the first three-point since 26 july i have therefore proved that the european team team structure is the backward .
for him it is no less gratifying : &quot; that we finally have to play again zero &quot; .
a lot of work during the time of the country break is also the fact that brian behrendt , mario pavelic , christopher dibon , deni alar and michael schimpelsberger have several days .
&quot; you can &apos;t forget that &quot; , he warned barisic that the man in the last three days was with a lot of restraint and pavelic players , &quot; the people who have been very stable lately &quot; .
the country games are scheduled to take place in the end , so that the &quot; wounds &quot; can be licked and a little bit increased in the physical sphere , &quot; explained barisic , who had five u21 outlets in his hands .
one , to which the break is most important , is capital. the captain hofmann .
he is ignoring the need for the team , goes beyond pain and is not alone in his life .
in this difficult period in particular , he has shown that he is a very important player for us , &quot; said konstatied barissic .
hofmann gave the game rapids before his exponential exchange. in the 68th minute , he won the game not only the structure , but also the second gate .
for the 33-year-old who has lost his 350th bundesliga match , he was the first staffed out of the game since november 2nd , 2013 ( 4 : 2 on the admira ) .
hofmann : &quot; should not believe that now everything is good &quot; &quot; we have certainly also a bit of luck .
now it was high time , &quot; said hofmann .
he warned voluntarily that the eu would continue to work in a more focused manner : &apos; we must not always see this in black and white .
we have seen in recent weeks that there has been no improvement in the way that has been described .
we must not forget either that the time has come to make things happen .
the importance of its role for the team was not disputed .
it is a very young team , and it is a team that i can very much help at the moment .
they are in some phases .
val gardena coach michael baur had chosen and his team had little to blame .
it regrets the rapid opposite reaction &quot; from the category spelltor &quot; , as well as the regular gate of nutz in the 40th minute , which has been replaced by referee collegger .
the only criticism i have of the commission &apos;s team is that it is not the direction we are going towards the gate in a few phases .
we have too little to make of this .
internal defenders maximilian karner saw it like : &quot; it has been badly started , then we have just found and even a gate made .
by and large , more could be done .
from this point of view , ruh is ruh .

a hollow footpath leads down to the church of san marino , which is approximately 600 years old .
it goes past koppeln , basalt stone halls and basalt plains .
a little bit below the stone block , from the bauersberg , one kilometre north of the road to weisbach , there is it .
vital sees the natural monument , which is raining over the other trees and the surrounding area .
a small buddha on a tree stump indicates that the buddha is a buddha .
but , despite intensive research , there were only indications of the name of the person .
dr. wolfgang schneider has also written the bishop &apos;s home archive and has invited older people from subterranean brunn to discuss how to improve the quality of the work .
the result of his research was not to be underestimated the reasonably sober explanation for the name .
so the target date for the introduction of the goat sheep is about 80 years ago , from the unterweißenbrunn to the laboriously rolled and freed meadows .
at the foot of the tree , the trees that are formed from the rise should be exploited .
meanwhile , the area has lost its importance , because the meadows are actually growing again .
the area is also dedicated to the core zone of the biosphere reserve .
when you enter the stone accumulation , you should be careful , however .
a hiking trail leads from unterweißenbrunn to the tree , which is hidden a little .
further paths are signposted and you can follow the direction of hochrhehön and reach a vast distance of hiking .
where is the watercastle ?
a watercastle , which is a great challenge for us , is a very small one .
the mirror in the moat already gives a good impression of the building , but we have a few historic buildings in the district , including the building counterpart fei .
where is our &quot; piece of the rhöner luck &quot; ?
my piece rheöner luck
as with previous series of main-post in the past years , there are also this year prices to win if you want to find the right solution .
anyone who wants to take photos can also take part .
under the e-mail address red.neustadt @ mainpost.de you can send us the solution and also your very own &quot; piece of the rhöner luck &quot; under this keyword .
the most beautiful photos will be published .
after weeks of tug-of-war , italy ’ s premier and current eu president , matteo renzi , has fought against strong conservative opposition on the eu ’ s special summit last week .
renzi considers that the world ’ s top newspaper la repubblica is a case in point , but he also considers the appointment of his government team as a favoritist .
it expects a breakthrough in the way it is reformist .
last but not least , renzi hopes that the increasingly popular anti-him movement will also be able to win the support of the left , because mogherini is being held to account , albeit in moderate terms .
the commission has made a clear commitment to the conservatives with president jean-claude juncker and to the poles nominated as president of the council , the predominant opinion in rome , in order to achieve political balance .
the chemical industry ’ s chief diplomat will be deputy prime minister of the commission , juncker .
the outstanding work of the eu parliament is to be seen as safe .
otherwise , president giorgio napolitano would have the nobel peace prize ’ s 41th anniversary nominated to the ruling democratic party ( pd ) .
la repubblica broadens optimism that the long-standing tradition of the leading party offices in the country has been well known and respected for its ambition .
the native of rome , he is married to the british family and has two daughters .
her party career began in the promotion of the police in the united states in 1996 .
in 1999 mogherini was awarded the title of vice president of the european community organization of society for three years .
with the 2001 election in the party council of the left democrats , it rose to the high party politics , worked in the department of foreign policy , whose head she soon became .
it occupied traditional salient italian foreign policy , such as the middle east , with nazi deployment studies , which italy participated in with a contingent of troops .
since 2008 she is a member of the chamber of deputies , where she is an expert on defence and european and international affairs .
as a renzi in february 2014 , he was reporting that he had been mogherini .
if the pd is again a better relationship with the strong peace movement in the country , which has become one of the 40 % of the party ’ s votes in the eu elections in may , then as in pd circles , i have noted .
the procedure for the brussels summit , the new eu external representative , is too little diplomatic experience , too little political will is lacking .
in brussels , especially in the case of poland and the baltic states , censure is being given realistic accents of mogherini ’ s crisis in ukraine and is being described as &apos; russia friendly &apos; .
it is in favour of the measures taken by the russian company gazprom south stream .
after renzi had been able to take office as eu president in july , he travelled to moscow to meet the people of the country for their first visit .
photos taken during the last two weeks with putin at the shake-hands were taken in brussels with indignation , as well as the fact that they were being sent to the kremlin head for october to a milan economic summit .

mr valles called on the deeply divided opposition to the european union to &apos; renew its love &apos; for the controversial socialist realism .
the president deserves everyone &apos;s respect .
&quot; it is our duty to work alongside him .
as a appeasement , the prime minister insisted that his government should not use the controversy of a 35-hour week in france , despite strong demands for a relaxation of the emmanuel mazen regulation .
on saturday , mr hollande had his fellow socialists urged him to join the &apos; united &apos; with the government .
but christian is taubira , the minister of justice , stresses the sand to the gear , and in which she is killed at a meeting .
marine le pen , the well on the right hand of the national front , is ridiculously discouraged the continuing fighting of the socialists and said that they would not imagine the european union &apos;s new vall &apos;s government taking longer than a few months .
francois hollande is the emperor without clothes , but prince manuel valls has also no , she is forced to wear a new government .
and the new will also be the autumn or winter not survive , &quot; said fräulein le pen to supporters .
they repeated the call of their party for a dissolution of parliament and said that they were confident that the elections would be held in advance .
the ruling party of france , for its part , suffered a defeat in the local elections in march and the right-wing national front was in the hands of the european parliament in the may elections .

putin is demanding that kiev be allowed to join &quot; state-building talks &quot; with the eastern ukraine .
the russian president vladimir putin promised to rebuild russian media reports on sunday , that the ukrainian government would not tolerate the fighting against the separatists in the east of the country and start negotiations immediately on &quot; statehood &quot; .
his spokesman , dimitri peskow , later made it clear that putin was not meant to be a “ big man ” under the control of the separatist region of eastern ukraine .
putin ’ s call to the kiev government to negotiate on an equal footing with the pro-russian insurgents fits in with the policy he has pursued since the riots began five months ago .
in an interview with the state television station channel one condemned the death of putin , the ukrainian military campaign against the reconquest of the people occupied by separatists in the eastern regions of donezk and luhansk , which took place in march .
the kremlin and the separatists have recently lost the money they have received as a &quot; noosija &quot; or &quot; neuschwanderung &quot; , a concept that is linked to the pre-revolutionary glory of russian empire .
putin pointed out that the us is all those who are in power as a result of ukrainian politicians ’ campaigns for the elections on 26 october .
&quot; we need to get down to detailed discussions immediately , not only on technical issues , but also on the political organisation of society and the state status of south-east ukraine , in order to safeguard the interests of the people living there , &quot; he said .
pescara said that the putin regime ’ s reference to the state of the world in the context of greater autonomy is a matter for the past months .
only ukrainians government can guarantee the eastern territories the necessary autonomy and the necessary political autonomy , said peskow .
it is not a question of negotiations between ukraine and russia , said peskow , &apos; because it is not a conflict between russia and ukraine &apos; .
the clarification of the kremlin &apos;s spokesman for correcting the &quot; misinterpretation &quot; of putin &apos;s remarks underscored the leadership claim of russia in dealing with separatist repression .
moscow – the us would have far greater difficulty in getting the regions of donetsk and luhansk to the east of ukraine , as the majority of the 6.5 million inhabitants do not belong to russians and do not want to receive surveys from the pre-conflict .
the autonomy that the european union has acquired from russian diplomats in international fora would help regional governments in ukraine to overcome the current crisis of their own trade agreements and external relations , and thus help the kremlin de facto gain control over an area .
the directive on the protection of personal data , annexed to the black sea five months ago , is the home port for most of the russian navy and an important trading port and historical coastal region .
the regions between the rostov region in russia and the crimea are also rich in mines , factories and giesseriees , which are important components of the russian military .
the ukrainian president petro poroshenko proposed to the president of the republic of moldova in his speech on the inauguration of 7 june that ukrainian legislation should be concerned about additions to the constitution with which the territories were given control .
but his idea of autonomy seems to be sharply opposed to that of the kremlin and the separatist rebels whose occupation is a matter of complete destruction .
putin ’ s last call to kil &apos;jaev to negotiate with the separatist leaders on an equal footing followed the same path .
the russian support for separatists overtook the country ’ s borders in the handbook , which , according to the fears of ukrainian security officials , was the first step in a campaign to take over the strategic coastal region .
for this reason , massive civilian and military aid is needed .
porosshenko spoke on saturday at a meeting of eu leaders in brussels and asked for urgent action , to find a further russian aggression against the ukraine .
&quot; we are about to make a point where there is no longer any backward , &quot; warned poroshenko .
thousands of foreign troops and hundreds of strangers are in the streets .
the eu summit decided to not set out specific actions to foster the process of drafting further sanctions against russia , which would be a serious obstacle to an unspecified escalation of the ukrainian crisis .

naked photo shooters around australian promis and gabi green shots .
geoffrey edelsten did not make a whim for his anger over hackers , who were probably naked images of his promised gabi grecko and a who is who of the a-celebrities from hollywood .
the film city is in exciting times , after a series of unequivocal photos of a naked jennifer lawrence in a hackingscandida scandal .
the person responsible for this is probably possessing 60 nude photos of lavrence , star of &quot; the tribute of panem &quot; and of superstars .
of the australian actresses teresa palmer , emily browning , yvonne strahovski , and grecko from melbourne , private photos were allegedly taken on account of an icloud gap .
on the list are 101 celebrities .
the most noble , who last month met with grecko , was said to confidential : &quot; it is contradictory . &quot;
all private letters and pictures should be private .
it is a disgrace that private information has been stolen and sold to others .
grecko , at present in new york , said that one news journalist , the united states , has &quot; shamefully &quot; .
the hacker probably has 30 images of palmer with their ex-friend scott speedman , including two recordings in which they are stored above without a pool .
the film works of palmers include &quot; love is undefeated &quot; , with liam hemsword and the &quot; love is unbeatable &quot; .
palmer , chuck-star strahovski and the actress brown , from sucker punch , were standing yesterday for comments on the hacked images .
a representative of lawrence &apos;s said to thomson : &quot; there is a crackdown on the human rights of the world . &quot;
actors seth rogen condemned the violence in the hacker in his tweet : &quot; hackte images from a mobile phone to post is nothing other than the sale of hhehlerware . &quot;
from a purely legal point of view , the continued stolen images should not be tolerated .
cycling , jogging , and hiking : the first day of the mountain bike tour was held yesterday .
the tour , which is for some a tortur , was a great success for the others .
in one , however , everyone agreed that there was fun .
thomas studanski will be on the road last night .
for the first time in his life , the chief of the supreme ursele brewhouse was on the feldberg yesterday with the bike .
for the good purpose .
the little muscle catcher can be found easily .
a great thing .
&quot; i don &apos;t know that i can - prima ! &quot;
small village of the same name on the way in the applause curve ?
nee , if i once stopped , i watched the news .
as thomas studanski , who is responsible for the cdu in oberurseler city council , paints many of the 718 participants yesterday in the spring of the city and came to the exhaustion , but fortunately happy .
others , by contrast , were more likely to lose the eleven kilometres long stretch between hohemark and feldberg .
norman diessner , for example .
the nearby rot tower is a great example of how to get to know the city .
he too is the track in a slide .
for the two triathletes , the &quot; field berg-radels &quot; was not necessarily a sporting challenge : &quot; here &apos;s the question of charity , there we are happy to be with it - an exit would be worth it anyway &quot; .
on the way , they had paul wenzel from oberreifenberg met .
the young ( 12 ) was in the morning to oberursel , to get straight to the city ’ s altitude .
the frankfurt florian orinz had already settled around 9 a.m. in the morning in the saddle .
i was also very pleased with fritten-toni .
for check-in , the chief of the supreme court of the kultkiosk , cycling tours through the feldberg are just part of this .
he had a great deal of experience with his 6.5-kilo racing bike .
a crazy event .
for this purpose - and i am happy to be here , &quot; andreas balzke said .
the durchtraininged mainzer says that he has a &quot; ambitious &quot; character .
this must also be the case , because he was familiar with the &apos; fixed wheel &apos; .
the fact that there is no wheel loose is a proof that it was not only the 20 hikers who cross the white wall and the foothold to the summit that showed their interest , but also a jogger who took part in a cord .
bergwacht doctor professor volker lischke , who has worked with his team , equipped with allwheel busses , and quad , for safety .
the 718 participants - and thus as many as never before - were in the morning in groups on the track .
the hikers first at 9.30 a.m.
the first two years of the history of the town followed .
five minutes later , the first mountain bikers left .
bent hansen , chairman of the association &quot; cycling on the great field mountain &quot; , gave the start commands and wished the participants to have a nice trip .
for next year i hope that he will be able to complete the route to feldberg to ensure the safety of the participants .
