jud@@ ith lam@@ y r@@ ue continued the negotiation process and the commission &apos;s 17 november session at the supreme court in ed@@ in@@ burgh .
re@@ tro@@ spec@@ tive thinking of the very american ideal of labour rights as human rights
the congress members ke@@ ith el@@ li@@ son and john le@@ w@@ is have tabled a legislative proposal that would make the organisation of trade unions more transparent as citizens &apos; rights .
&quot; just like trade unions die , the workers of the middle class die .
i therefore take pride in the work of the committee on civil liberties , justice and home affairs , together with john le@@ w@@ is .
this gr@@ ound@@ breaking law gives workers the same legal means to discrimin@@ ate against on the grounds of organiz@@ ing trade unions as on other forms of discrimination - and thus stops anti-@@ trade unions .
the addition of the national labour law , to ensure that workers can be discrimin@@ ated against , is a good idea for the organisation of trade union representation in order to be able to appeal to a civil court for justice - and for compensation or pen@@ al money - is to be necessary .
but it is certainly not a radical initiative - at least not under american standards .
indeed , the best way to protect understanding what is happening in el@@ lis@@ on , le@@ w@@ is , and other spon@@ sors of their legislative proposal is to establish the connection back to a very american idea .
despite the set@@ backs that the trade unions in recent years have been subjec@@ ted to - in wis@@ con@@ s@@ in , mic@@ hi@@ gan , and other countries around the country - americans once forced countries around the world to accept labor rights .
there was a time when the european union was becoming increasingly involved in the war in iraq .
when the united states , after world war ii , occupied japan , the general dou@@ gl@@ as mac ar@@ th@@ ur and his staff encouraged the country to adopt a constitution that would allow the japanese to live in peace .
fully aware of what i have said , the workers and their unions have been very active in creating a new japan .
when the united states , after world war ii , occupied germany , general d@@ wi@@ ght david e@@ is@@ en@@ ho@@ wer and his staff ur@@ ged the german@@ s to write a constitution that would ensure that fas@@ c@@ ism was ad@@ ol@@ f hit@@ ler ’ s .
in recognition of the fact that the workers would organize themselves , and their voice in the new nation , the european union added a new dimension to the clause that explicitly states that the workers are entitled to vote .
agreements that do not restrict this right or aim to prevent it are not acceptable .
when the former first lady of the united states , roo@@ se@@ vel@@ t , presid@@ ed over the international human rights commission , she was told that the universal declaration of human rights was a good thing , as was the united nations in 194@@ 8 .
for generations , americans have been accepting the basic pre@@ mise that labour rights are human rights .
when this country joined other countries , it was trying to impose civil and democratic societies , and i said that americans were not entitled to the creation of a trade union - and to be a trade union - then .
after these rights were vio@@ lated in america , the us is indeed very wise to look at the american ideal .
how pa@@ st@@ or martin lu@@ ther king j@@ r. said 50 years ago : &apos; we are not going to be a great deal like a big ban@@ g &apos; .
the story is a great teaching master .
now everyone knows that the working class movement has the strength of the nation not restricted , but increased it .
the increase in the standard of living of millions of people has made work wonder@@ fully a market for industry .
those who have not done the job forget that simple tru@@ ths , but the story preser@@ ves them .
the story is re@@ mem@@ bered , and we should do so .
the formal recognition of labour rights as human rights - and the extension of the protection of citizens &apos; rights as protection against discrimination in the creation of employee representation - is long over@@ due .
ke@@ ith el@@ lis@@ on and john le@@ w@@ is re@@ new the ideal that america has in the past .
judge stops tempor@@ arily from law , that all the abor@@ tion clin@@ ics in lo@@ u@@ i@@ si@@ ana are forced to close .
a us federal judge stopped the trial on sunday for the time being .
this measure , which was adopted by bo@@ b@@ by j@@ in@@ dal , govern@@ or of l@@ ou@@ i@@ si@@ ana , in june to the law and adopted on 1 september in force , is a step forward for doctors who are abor@@ ting abor@@ tions .
the decision of the judge does not , however , mean that doctors are still legally leaving abor@@ tion legally .
&quot; the pla@@ in@@ ti@@ ffs can make further work in accordance with the law while they are concerned with obtaining these rights , &quot; wrote bun@@ des@@ re@@ ich@@ er john de@@ gra@@ vel@@ les in his judgment .
within a month , a hearing will be held for the judge , to decide for the law on a more lasting decision .
abor@@ tion ad@@ voca@@ tes welcomed the decision to reduce the recent decision in a number of jud@@ gments against similar measures , and said that doctors should spend so much more time in order to avoid hospital exam@@ inations .
&quot; today &apos;s decision means that the women in lo@@ u@@ i@@ si@@ ana are subjec@@ ted to a de@@ vi@@ ant law which depri@@ ves them of their health and their rights , &quot; said n@@ ancy nor@@ th@@ up , president and chairman of the centre for reproduction rights .
it was not immediately clear whether the european court of justice &apos;s judgment would also apply to doctors from the two clin@@ ics , who had been accused of not being involved and also of being granted permission to initi@@ ate proceedings .
lou@@ i@@ si@@ ana is one of 11 states that have laws similar to those in which courts have recently introduced such measures in al@@ ab@@ ama and missi@@ ssi@@ pp@@ i for non-@@ constitutional purposes .
key points of a law in tex@@ as that most of the people banned in the state are the closure of .
abor@@ tion ad@@ voca@@ tes and the american college of abor@@ tion are not allowed to use abor@@ tion as a means of promoting abor@@ tion .
abor@@ tion oppon@@ ents keep up with the fact that the measures are designed to protect women &apos;s health , even though some of them also have to deal with the effects of clo@@ sures .
only a doctor who has been in lou@@ i@@ si@@ ana to carry out abor@@ tions has patient safety records .
if all other doctors are in power , the government will not be able to carry out abor@@ tions .
on their argument , the commission is not saying that the court of justice has not yet been informed of the case , as representatives of the state of lou@@ i@@ si@@ ana said , for the conduct of abor@@ tions .

for women in rural areas of australia , there is a higher risk that they will be suffering from o@@ vari@@ an cancer than they are in cities .
researchers analy@@ zed the medical data of more than 1@@ 100 austr@@ ali@@ ans , with the total number of e@@ gg@@ s detec@@ ted in 2005 , and found that only 25 % of the total population was diagno@@ sed five years after diagno@@ sis .
the research leader su@@ an j@@ ord@@ an of the q@@ im@@ r ber@@ g@@ ho@@ fer medical research institute said that the most important thing for those who live in rural and remote areas of the state is to have a mort@@ ality risk during the study .
a small study : new medicines could be l@@ ung and eg@@ g stock@@ pil@@ es .
the researchers studied the effects of the medical care provided by women for seven years .
dr. j@@ ord@@ an said that the age of a woman in the diagno@@ sis , the type of e@@ gg@@ s cancer , is existing pre-@@ conditions and the social and economic status .
for older women and those who have cancer , it is important to have a better understanding of the causes of cancer at the time of diagno@@ sis .
for those who are in rural and remote areas , the state is a very important factor in the mort@@ ality risk during the study .
although the study was not studied why outside the city live animals were with higher quality , the results were not very positive .
&quot; this disease is best treated by gy@@ nec@@ ological on@@ co@@ logical ac@@ tion@@ aries , and these are usually found in larger cities , &quot; said she .
despite the improvement in the provision of telecommunications services to reduce di@@ stances , the commission proposed a new system as a possible re@@ me@@ dy .

garden centres regret falling prices for house@@ holds , and the loss of income for the house@@ holds , as well as the loss of income for the elderly and the in@@ ability to provide a living for the elderly .
the decline , together with an increased fall in the number of house@@ holds under 35 , could result in the loss of tens of thousands of p@@ ounds a year when the current bo@@ ys are still eating after a study by the h@@ ta , as in financial times .
the report states that the ren@@ ter is on average 55 % of the amount paid , which people with own homes pay for their garden .
the increase in people who live in highly urban areas is a major cause of death and destruction .
in the london area , where over a period of 6 years the proportion of house@@ holds is growing from 6.@@ 5 % to 43 % , the number of small businesses in the garden products is estimated to be the lowest .
the h@@ ta and the royal hor@@ tic@@ ul@@ tur@@ ally society are the most important figures in the life of the city .
gu@@ y bar@@ ter , head of the gar@@ den@@ -@@ garden consult@@ ant for the rh@@ s said : &quot; contain@@ er gar@@ den@@ ers , for example , are very popular because they can sell their plants during a move . &quot;
the h@@ ta report identified the period between 1997 and 2005 as the &apos; golden age &apos; of the european garden re@@ tail@@ er due to rising house owners &apos; numbers and economic prosperity of the late 19@@ 20@@ s to the mid-@@ 1980 &apos;s .
he predic@@ ts that the number of new jobs will increase by 10 % this year , and that the number of people who are in the region will rise by 10 % in march and april of last year .
the op@@ posi@@ tional opposition politici@@ an im@@ ran kh@@ an and the intellectual leader ta@@ hi@@ ru@@ l q@@ add@@ i have been accused of having pro@@ tested in pakistan .
in the capital islam@@ ab@@ ad , around 1000 demonstr@@ ators have signed the state television station p@@ tv .
information minister per@@ v@@ ai@@ z r@@ as@@ hi@@ d said that soldiers had used the prote@@ sters out of p@@ tv buildings again .
the trans@@ mit@@ ter was responsible for about 40 minutes , sending out a message .
at the same time , around 3@@ 000 demonstr@@ ators tried to return to the residence of prime minister na@@ wa@@ z shar@@ if .
about one kil@@ ome@@ tre away they delivered themselves with stic@@ ks and stones .
the police used te@@ ar gas to build te@@ ren@@ gas .
the demonstr@@ ators demanded that sh@@ aria ’ s re@@ sign@@ ation be rejected , but he refused .
the army of the country is therefore rightly ur@@ ging a political solution to the conflict , &quot; without time to waste and without violence &quot; .
after a meeting in the headquarters at sunday morning , the commission announced that it would be re@@ viewing the military as having done its duty to ensure the security of the state .
the military plays a key role in pakistan and has already frequently played a role in the military .

warning stri@@ kes : local guides are threat@@ ening to have consequences for comm@@ u@@ ter drivers .
the nation@@ wide warning strike in the local guides on monday evening was a real disaster for the passenger transport of n@@ r@@ w .
the 18 to 21 o &apos;@@ clock proc@@ lam@@ ation of the lack of parking facilities in all the member states throughout germany , including the long-@@ distance , regional and s-@@ bahn transport networks , is a matter of concern to all transport companies .
the main thr@@ ust of the warning strike is the lack of freight traffic .

the main thr@@ ust of the warning strike is that the freight traffic is the main one .
the german railway in n@@ r@@ w announced a new version of the &quot; n@@ r@@ w &quot; version to minim@@ ize the impact .
the g@@ d@@ l , however , did not say where they wanted to strike , so it was difficult to find out the consequences in concrete terms .

the prosecu@@ tors are not on friday telling the office of the prosecu@@ tor of mall@@ orca that they had black@@ ma@@ iled by police officers and att@@ acked the city of cal@@ vi@@ à .
the head of the police of cal@@ vi@@ à on the holiday island of mall@@ orca was arrested after corruption charges and was released from prison .
the main commissioner , jo@@ s@@ é ant@@ oni@@ o na@@ var@@ ro , was arrested following alleg@@ ations of corruption against him by several pun@@ ta b@@ all@@ ena business@@ men , the street where most bars and night@@ clubs are located .
according to the daily online mall@@ orca di@@ ari@@ o , the an@@ k@@ les laid the foundations for the office of the prosecu@@ tor for combating corruption in mall@@ orca on friday .
two other places of interest are located in the municip@@ ality of guar@@ dia ci@@ vi@@ l , in connection with the corruption sub@@ missions of the municip@@ ality and are being held together with na@@ var@@ ro by a judge .
the spanish daily newspaper ab@@ c reported that the commission has been working to reduce an@@ no@@ ying night club owners who have been forced to ve@@ to the government .
&quot; it is no longer a matter of money , it is about survival , &quot; said one of the business@@ men to the court .

the first spring day with na@@ ked and stor@@ my weather conditions .
the spring has sweet and sav@@ our@@ y win@@ ters .
in the evening until 9 p.m. , another 5@@ mm of rain fell to the city , after 6.@@ 6@@ mm , which had already been taken to sunday during the night .
the last ra@@ inf@@ all was the result of a series of short , stor@@ my sho@@ wers , including a cast shortly before 20 o &apos;@@ clock and for almost 4@@ mm ra@@ inf@@ all in about 10 minutes .
after winter has passed for a fru@@ it@@ ful do@@ se spring , the first time that i have been able to get a good do@@ se of spring , the temperatures in the city fell back to 15@@ .@@ 8 ° c on monday .
the b@@ ö@@ sch weather conditions probably have led to the late lan@@ ding of a flight from vir@@ gin air@@ lines from mel@@ bour@@ ne to ade@@ la@@ ide .
the aircraft could have been flying shortly after 7.@@ 30 p.m. , but was taken by a sh@@ er@@ wind - a su@@ dden change in wind speed or wind direction over a short distance - and had to go through .
wind@@ m@@ ills reached a height of about 50 km / h at this time on the ground at ade@@ la@@ ide airport .
the flight data showed that the aircraft was also available at a second lan@@ ding .
the flight delay led to a loss of the aircraft and a further increase in the number of flights , including an em@@ i@@ rates flight from du@@ ba@@ i and a qu@@ an@@ tu@@ m flight from sy@@ d@@ ney .
for ade@@ la@@ ide , the first time in a row is on tuesday , when the temperature of the water is 16 ° c .

while i am writing here , i am looking at the sp@@ in of the cable that connec@@ ts the list@@ en@@ er to the phone , and i think : bo@@ ah , how re@@ tr@@ o is that ?
but behind this lies a thought : if the cable is not , we would be able to get all the list@@ en@@ ers to work in the house in a very short time , and that would be much more re@@ tr@@ o .
in any case , the same applies to the e@@ kel@@ tr@@ on@@ ic ( e@@ kel@@ tr@@ onic ?

and anyone who , for example , still has a tube tv in the living room , says that the tv is basically opposed to television .
why these considerations ?
because we are not aware of the i@@ fa &apos;s appe@@ als to the radio tower this week , we are still not fully competent in matters of electronics .
the la@@ ie , which once operated as a washing machine and cd player , was bur@@ ied in the dark today .
yes , &apos; go on &apos; ?
what is to be discussed with people who seem to be volun@@ tar@@ ily giving up such quar@@ k ?
in fact , it has been about 20 years since the first thing we have been doing was to make our house net@@ worked .

israeli children are returning to the us after the war in gaza .
thousands of israeli children from the areas of the vicinity of gaza have been killed in the most recent earth@@ qua@@ ke in the country on monday after they had been in air@@ space .
the school started in the early 199@@ 0s , when the ro@@ cket laun@@ chers had been drawn into the south of israel , a feeling of joy and expec@@ tation , but the signs of fighting are still fresh .
in the southern city of ash@@ do@@ d , employees of the &quot; pas@@ ho@@ sh &quot; children &apos;s garden , who were accompanied by a ro@@ cket , were particularly sho@@ c@@ ked before the students arrived .
&quot; we have a bit of fear , but are ex@@ ci@@ ted , &quot; ron@@ it bar@@ t said , resid@@ ent in the ki@@ b@@ but@@ z sa@@ ad and there english speaking teachers .
many children from our area urgently need to return to a rout@@ ine .
your 1@@ 1-@@ year-@@ old daughter sh@@ ani bar@@ t said that it added to the &quot; a little bit of com@@ ic &quot; to make a su@@ dden return to school .
&quot; these were difficult times , and we are not out of the house at all , &quot; she said .
president re@@ u@@ ven ri@@ v@@ lin visited the ki@@ b@@ but@@ z near the border to gaza .
until a ce@@ as@@ e-@@ fire is brought to an end last week , thousands of residents of the border communities , such as sa@@ ad , remained in their homes or left their homes to live in sa@@ fer areas further away from gaza and to escape the missi@@ le .
many inhabitants of na@@ h@@ al o@@ z , a municip@@ ality near the border to ga@@ za , in the vicinity of a 4-@@ year-@@ old boy from a palestinian mur@@ de@@ rer gran@@ ate .
the ministry of education announced that about one do@@ zen schools in the country have not yet returned .
your children were tempor@@ arily taken to other schools .
prime minister ben@@ jam@@ in net@@ any@@ ah@@ u visited a school in s@@ der@@ ot , a border town on gaza , which was se@@ ve@@ rely affected by the palestinian fire .
it also called on the children to be much taught and said &apos; we will be ensuring that children are aware of their knowledge and offer them security &apos; .
israel and hamas agreed to re@@ sume negotiations with israel last tuesday .
the tru@@ ce provided for a immediate end to the fighting and the important issues remain un@@ resolved .
israel is calling for the dis@@ arm@@ ament of hamas and for the han@@ do@@ ver of the bodies of two people killed in the fighting .
a new round of indirect talks will probably be even more important this month in egypt .
the war has claimed more than 2,@@ 100 palestinians and has destroyed more than three quarters of them , and at least 4@@ 94 children have been killed , according to the palestinians and the un .
israel is den@@ ying this information and appreci@@ ates that it is a minimum of half of the people killed .
on the israeli side , 66 soldiers and six civili@@ ans , including one th@@ ai citizen , were killed .
hamas and other strugg@@ les in gaza have been fi@@ red for 4@@ ,@@ 5@@ 91 ro@@ c@@ kets and mur@@ de@@ rers during the fighting .
meanwhile , the country ’ s military , more than 5@@ ,000 air and sea freight attacks , led to more than 5@@ ,000 attacks .
the israeli attacks are dam@@ aging or destro@@ ying thousands of homes in gaza .
for tens of thousands of people continue to be in shel@@ ters and the fighting continues , the european union &apos;s educational authorities are postpon@@ ing the start of the school year last week .
&quot; i hope the school is soon back open , so we can continue to learn so as to have children in the world and the jewish children who are , &quot; said mo@@ ham@@ ma@@ d am@@ ara , a 13@@ -@@ year-@@ old boy who is currently living in j@@ ail in gam@@ bia .
after being elected in sa@@ x@@ ony : c@@ du@@ -@@ vi@@ ze stro@@ b@@ l provides n@@ p@@ d-@@ for@@ bi@@ dden procedures .
given the vo@@ ter losses of the n@@ p@@ d in sa@@ x@@ ony , c@@ du bun@@ des@@ vi@@ ze thomas stro@@ b@@ l has chosen to end the current n@@ p@@ d ban procedure before the federal constitutional court .
berlin - according to c@@ du bun@@ des@@ vi@@ ze thomas stro@@ b@@ l , the current prohibi@@ tion proceedings against the n@@ p@@ d should be brought before the federal constitutional court .
&quot; the n@@ p@@ d cuts bad , &quot; he said .
this is a welcome development .
the n@@ p@@ d was not present at the sunday vote .
a first attempt to achieve a ban on the extreme right party was launched in 2003 .
in december 2013 , the federal council submitted a proposal for a new proposal in kar@@ ls@@ ru@@ he .
german government and federal parliament are joining forces not to do so .
harbour city is a city in the south of the country , and is the capital of the country .
the new country square is now home to refugees in t@@ ents .
the central initial recording for refugees in harb@@ ur@@ g pla@@ te@@ au bur@@ sts from all se@@ ams .
now the interior authority has three t@@ ents of the red cross next to it .
the district government has been elected only shortly before - it is little enthusi@@ astic .
&quot; this hau@@ r@@ uck actions are further pro@@ vo@@ king reservations among citizens and giving the district politicians no opportunity to engage construc@@ tively in human resource development .
your party calls for the district authorities to be able to make use of the un@@ used houses in the harbour area at the moment .
96 refugees can be found in the three t@@ ents .
reasons for the over@@ crow@@ ding in the initial recording are the rus@@ h of relief teams and the lack of a proper response to the situation .
many refugees therefore remain in the eu for longer than the regular three months .
the house prices have the strong@@ est winter rise in seven years , but shows a widespread growth in the number of homes in the year .
the r@@ p data co@@ rel@@ o@@ gic head@@ set is a powerful and eas@@ y-@@ to-@@ use solution for the he@@ don@@ ic home market .
this increase in the number of employees in the group of companies in june , july and august is 4.@@ 2 % , the biggest increase in the winter months since 2007 .
the annual price increase in the european union was 10.@@ 9 % , more than twice the price of the euro area .
the research director of r@@ p data , ti@@ m law@@ ler , has told us that the first two years of sy@@ d@@ ney and mel@@ bour@@ ne have been selling a two-@@ ti@@ er market .
the figures from r@@ p data show that the number of homes in the us is still very low in sy@@ d@@ ney last year , with a record number of new homes growing in mel@@ bour@@ ne by 11.@@ 7 % .
the following markets are ade@@ la@@ ide , bri@@ z@@ ban@@ e and dar@@ win .
on the other side of the scale is can@@ ber@@ ra , which is dominated by the cuts in government spending .
mr law@@ yer , as i said , is that the spring of the year is now coming to an increase in the prices for the next few months .
&quot; if you want to avoid the constant high rate of au@@ ction prices , you have to consider a generally fast sales rate and the ongoing price increase .
in an opinion to the new press , he contradic@@ ts statements by the managing director pe@@ er med@@ au and at@@ te@@ sti@@ tes this &quot; how a field lord &quot; to position .
the style of the university is not this , it says in the communication .
so the family mem@@ ali@@ u is already &quot; mid-@@ june or@@ ally over the request for the wedding in the city .
the statement that the plans will only be known in july is definitely not true . &apos;
at the same time , he points out that the p@@ acts are not a &apos; pre-@@ fix@@ ation &apos; or even a &apos; decision &apos; , but &apos; pre@@ ference &apos; .
the commissioner responsible for access to the railway is also responsible for the extension of the narrow road towards the castle , which is less dramatic than those of med@@ us .
from a nine metr@@ e wide road was and is not mentioned .
it is not a question of eur 5.@@ 50 m at this stage , which is a meter wider than before , &quot; explains p@@ ö@@ tz@@ l .
the argument of med@@ al operators , that their cost free and shoes are not worth the price in the future , is then only supported by students at the university of applied sciences , does not want to be allowed to apply p@@ ö@@ tz@@ l .
the hotel is not allowed to park , because it is like other public parking spaces .
the an@@ de@@ an people think of the people living near the houses , but they think of the people living near them .
the cri@@ b mountain wi@@ gh@@ te@@ l , which is situated on the site and is located at the front door of the park entrance , along the parking dec@@ k , is said to be &quot; not affected &quot; .
instead , it gives cause for concern that &apos; this is not just about child care , but also about the future of the residents of the town at the mouth of the fried@@ rich@@ -@@ stre@@ ib@@ -@@ stra@@ ß@@ e and the 800 pu@@ pil@@ s of the neighbouring real school .
it is therefore a question of much more than individual interests of the mess@@ rs med@@ au , &quot; says p@@ ö@@ tz@@ l .
whether the imf ’ s criticism of the family advisory board of the child ’ s cri@@ b , with the expansion of the street , would become one of the few natural spots of co@@ bur@@ gs , &quot; can be read for himself . &quot;
in early october , p@@ ö@@ tz@@ l , together with the ba@@ um@@ berg state building office , intends to inform the city counc@@ ils about the construction of the university until 2020 , &quot; and in this context the importance of new development &quot; .
pe@@ er med@@ au had a very good opportunity to visit the parents of the nur@@ ser@@ y last week about the plans of the university .
so the commission &apos;s access to the new parking dec@@ k is not to be restricted by the camp@@ us and fried@@ rich@@ -@@ stre@@ et@@ . it is to be via the me@@ d@@ aul mountain .
this would make it possible to reach the narrow road on about one kil@@ ome@@ tre long .
according to the commission &apos;s calcu@@ lations , the price of traffic in the park of ho@@ hen@@ f@@ els would increase ten@@ fold .
from about 2000 vehicles daily , we are talking about .
the commission has been trying to make a statement on the plan .
g@@ lan@@ f is out of hand@@ ball national team .
hol@@ ger g@@ lan@@ f will not be responsible for the dh@@ b team any more .
the 3@@ 1-@@ year-@@ old from the bun@@ des@@ lig@@ a league , s@@ g fl@@ ens@@ bur@@ g-@@ han@@ de@@ wit@@ t , was mainly responsible for this decision .
the decision is not easy for me , it is over several months mature .
it is a time for me to respond to the signals from my body and to re@@ new my career in the national team . &quot;
it is therefore going to be a balance sheet of 16@@ 7 country games and 5@@ 76 goals for germany in the international reti@@ rement age .
because the thro@@ wing huge back@@ room player is responsible for the champi@@ on leader , the team is not able to win the championship for a few years .
with the ic@@ el@@ an@@ dic , who will be taking his cad@@ re for the country games against switzerland on tuesday , the ic@@ el@@ an@@ dic national team led a &quot; long and good con@@ vers@@ ation .
his ideas and approaches have made me as enthusi@@ astic as they have been my many years of players and my success@@ ors .
but for my club i would also like to be healthy in the coming years , to be able to have longer reg@@ ener@@ ation periods .
the left hand side of the camera had a second chance in 2012 after a he@@ el inf@@ ection .
due to ach@@ ill@@ es he@@ al problems , he had moved from team doctors in the german hand@@ ball association ( d@@ h@@ b ) to a co@@ ti@@ son@@ sp@@ ri@@ te@@ . he had to take a heavy infl@@ am@@ mation .
an emergency operation and two other interven@@ tions followed .
then g@@ lan@@ tor@@ f had a compla@@ int against the team doctor .
twelve years of professional and ele@@ ven years of national team career go to no body .
i have some health problems with building sites that i can &apos;t ignore any@@ more .
after the three inf@@ ec@@ tious diseases of foot operations , which took place in 2012 in short inter@@ vals , i have my blood pressure never really got into the gri@@ p .
this is accompanied by some other wear related complaints .
the first year of the year i noticed that the commission had not received my head , but my body was not fo@@ ol@@ ed , &quot; explained g@@ land@@ or@@ f in the interview to the magazine &quot; hand@@ ball time &quot; .
for a com@@ e@@ back , he would only be able to be in absolute emergency .
&quot; if all k@@ nit@@ ting te@@ ar , i am always ready to talk , &quot; explained the double family father to the magazine .
however , i cannot support the years in which i still play hand@@ ball , at one hand .
i must also say that i am convinced , after my long si@@ ck@@ ness in 2012 , that the european parliament has been quite hum@@ ili@@ ating .
i have been a member of the committee on the environment , public health and consumer policy since 198@@ 8 .
in addition to the 2007 world cup title and the win of the champi@@ ons league 20@@ 14 , he won the 2008 ( h@@ s@@ g n@@ ord@@ hor@@ n ) and 2010 ( t@@ b@@ v le@@ m@@ go ) the e@@ h@@ f-@@ cup .
in 2012 , he secured a $ 5@@ ,000 deal with fl@@ ens@@ burg to the po@@ dium of the po@@ dium .
german economy in the spring by 0.@@ 2 % shr@@ in@@ king , with the growth of 2.@@ 2 % in the spring .
the crises surrounding the globe have shown the german economy in the second quarter .
gross domestic product is the most important indic@@ ator of economic growth in the eu .
the shared that with the federal statistical office .
the consumption of alcohol alone has en@@ li@@ ven@@ ed the economy in the spring , while investment has fallen .
the foreign trade is also slow@@ ing economic activity .
thanks to the strong launch of the year , the first half of the year will be a total gdp plus of 0.@@ 8 % compared to the second half of 2013 .
hor@@ st@@ mar was the starting point and the goal of the &quot; m@@ ün@@ ster@@ land@@ -@@ mo@@ o@@ i@@ ste &quot; , which was first introduced by the bur@@ g@@ man@@ n@@ s@@ stadt on sunday .
the bur@@ g@@ man@@ n@@ stadt hor@@ st@@ mar experienced a great show on sunday .
the largest cycling association of the netherlands , n@@ t@@ f@@ u , organised the so-called &quot; m@@ ün@@ ster@@ lan@@ de mo@@ o@@ i@@ ste &quot; .
he is han@@ ding over the largest bicycle tour in the whole of munich .
over 1000 participants thank you for your support and for your support .
the award is given to the best of the world in the various journ@@ als .
we come from the her@@ oes and we are driven over@@ night to get to this tour .
we would like to welcome the m@@ ün@@ ster@@ land region in this way , &quot; he re@@ jo@@ ic@@ ed with the ro@@ pes through the k@@ ron@@ platz and the sch@@ los@@ s@@ berg districts .
the user can register at the club &apos;s home .
k@@ ath@@ ar@@ ina was looking forward to a little &quot; peace ride &quot; through the city over the wall , where the start was also made .
he continued to lead the route , which was designed for three different categories , towards her@@ ren@@ hol@@ z over the sch@@ ö@@ pp@@ inger mountain towards cou@@ es@@ fel@@ d and via ha@@ vi@@ x@@ bec@@ k and b@@ ill@@ er@@ bec@@ k back to hor@@ st@@ mar .
on routes of 95 kilometres with 1@@ 17@@ 5 metres of al@@ titude , 120 kilometres with 14@@ 75 metres of al@@ titude and 14@@ 5 kilometres of 17@@ 75 metres of al@@ titude , cy@@ cli@@ sts proved their good condition .
food is served in the restaurant , in the restaurant , in the garden , in the garden , in the garden , in the garden , in the garden , in the garden , in the garden , in the garden .
the main organiz@@ er jo@@ s ter hu@@ er@@ ne and may@@ or representative he@@ in@@ z l@@ ö@@ l@@ fing showed a great deal of interest in the success of this cycling event .
we are satisfied and it was a nice experience for all concerned .
the organization was conducted without problems and it was not negative .
unfortunately , not so many participants , as the organiz@@ er decided to do , were coming , which is probably due to the bad weather forec@@ asts and the morning weather .
&quot; we are facing a new era in 20@@ 15 with hopefully nice weather on 30 august or during another weekend &quot; , says the german cy@@ cli@@ sts , but nevertheless , promised to return to m@@ ün@@ ster@@ land and the organis@@ ers plan to re@@ run .
con@@ stan@@ t@@ ine w@@ ec@@ ker was careful to keep honest mem@@ o@@ irs of the people who were born in the city without any fear of being che@@ ated .
it is actually more philosoph@@ ical testi@@ mony than bi@@ bli@@ o@@ graphy , which is con@@ stan@@ t@@ ine w@@ ec@@ ker , song@@ writer , paci@@ f@@ ist , polit@@ ko@@ -@@ safe acti@@ vis@@ t , ex@@ -@@ prisoners , in &quot; m@@ ö@@ n@@ ch und k@@ ri@@ e@@ k@@ ri@@ e@@ ines 8@@ 7 .
not chr@@ onom@@ e@@ tric , but more thought and energy .
and he is in the process of being honest : from the on@@ ani@@ e as a gy@@ m@@ na@@ si@@ ast to the store di@@ e@@ ting and drug use .
also , to show that the first step is to promote tolerance in dealing with his fellow human beings .
wide spaces also take ab@@ str@@ act , but all the more important terms : love , soul , e@@ go , the being in the now , spirit@@ u@@ ality - all tries to do this by trying to get on very philosoph@@ ical .
and he explains the way his paci@@ f@@ ism , his social criticism , his political commitment - and also , as he does not only hear music - is the way he sees the opera .
the latter has the leg@@ acy of constant , we@@ ster@@ ners , who has also been assigned to the as@@ ke@@ tic mon@@ k , who &quot; is represented by sub@@ tr@@ action &quot; , as he says , &quot; by doing everything un@@ necessarily &quot; .
there is a great deal of difference between all the high-@@ min@@ ded views .
here too , it is gent@@ le honest .
len@@ ny hen@@ ry : my father has never seen me in the arm .
never said &quot; i love you &quot; , but i love you .
hen@@ ry was one of seven children of a jam@@ a@@ ic@@ an immi@@ grant family in du@@ d@@ ley in the mid@@ lands in 195@@ 8 .
his father , the died , as hen@@ ry 19 was , worked in a factory in which her relationship was limited .
hen@@ ry pro@@ ves for a com@@ edy , ru@@ dy &apos;s , r@@ are re@@ plic@@ a , and the first one is a imag@@ inary con@@ vers@@ ation with his father and from the series on radio 4 .
the sound@@ track is a mix@@ ture of reg@@ ga@@ e and ra@@ p , with lively me@@ lo@@ dies and a mix@@ ture of sounds .
but hen@@ ry had to be bo@@ thered by some difficult child@@ hood moments .
he attended &quot; many &quot; therap@@ ies and was awarded the &quot; best treatment &quot; after the death of his mother .
it was difficult to convince him .
it never looked like his face , only heard his voice : &quot; listen to the kra@@ ken on .
let your si@@ ster in peace .
take your time !
i want to tell cr@@ ick@@ et .
my older bro@@ thers se@@ y@@ m@@ our and hil@@ ton - who have grown up , as i was a child - went to him in the cold .
i never had such a con@@ vers@@ ation with him .
much of my life he was devoted to this serious type in the corner that the newspaper read .
recently opened hen@@ ry a foun@@ dry in the netherlands , du@@ d@@ ley , and although the conditions are better than at the time of his father , he won a gli@@ mp@@ se of how life is for him .
it is now a little bri@@ ghter , but they are dark , smo@@ ked , deep sty@@ lis@@ tic lab@@ y@@ r@@ in@@ ths with fl@@ ame tr@@ ough@@ s and smo@@ ke and much so@@ ot .
my father put up so@@ on@@ er simply in the tu@@ b and then he could slowly hear him how he would sing .
when i came there , i was told that the european union was not going to do that for years to achieve food on the table .
however , hen@@ ry grew up as a child without love testi@@ mony to his parents .
my father hu@@ gged the land of my father , he never said &quot; i love you &quot; .
only when i was able to get to know my mother towards the end of her life , we began to &quot; i love you , i love you , i love you &quot; .
the hotel is located in the heart of the city , in the heart of the city , close to the main shopping area and the main shopping street .
could you tell me what you are doing with the &quot; i love you &quot; ?
listen to the news and listen to the music !
pap@@ a , i am 22 !
with da@@ wn fren@@ ch .
why should we not be friends ?
it is a great mother .
it is still with f@@ ren@@ ch be@@ friends , but the first one he has been married to is the french .
da@@ wn is a good man .
why should we not be friends ?
it is a great mother .
hen@@ ry &apos;s own mother was di@@ abe@@ tic .
the company contributed to their death .
when i was very , very ex@@ ag@@ ger@@ ated and had symp@@ t@@ oms of di@@ abe@@ tes , my doctor said &quot; you must be radical .
so i pul@@ led this fitness through and had to take a dr@@ astic di@@ et to get the symp@@ t@@ oms to go .
it is very difficult .
and it is stren@@ u@@ ous .
no one li@@ kes to eat car@@ ro@@ ts .
hen@@ ry &apos;s career move shows that he is perhaps in his elegant , short cut bar .
since he was elected by cri@@ tics for his o@@ th@@ ell@@ o , he has been a member of the theatre .
the following year , the com@@ edy of the ir@@ r@@ itation , and then f@@ ences of august wil@@ son .
this is another experience than the si@@ te@@ map .
he started with just 16 years , when he was in a factory .
a d@@ j discovered him on the stage , when he was able to im@@ it@@ ate people and wrote to new faces about him .
his television career began in the mid-@@ 197@@ 0s , when he was a member of the european parliament for a fairly long time .
he learned in a profes@@ sion .
i did not have to wait for the public to see , but also from 197@@ 5 to 198@@ 5 to learn how to create an efficient wit@@ z story .
len@@ ny 197@@ 5 at new faces , a young man , in new faces , in 197@@ 5 .
since his manager is the stage rights at the bl@@ ack and white bar , he is also responsible for the development of the new album .
my family was very un@@ comfortable .
i wish there were some more things that could never happen , but i regret that i have not been able to do so .
it was a strange , un@@ pleasant position for me , but i worked on ri@@ es@@ en@@ projects with and learned to work with the people of a large audience .
but this &quot; years of price stability &quot; is not the only way to avoid the british television .
the introduction of fi@@ gur@@ ines , which are the british black culture , has both ri@@ dic@@ ul@@ ed and celebrated , and has worked in the 198@@ 0s on an alternative com@@ edy circle .
the first series of len@@ ny hen@@ ry show went to the show in 198@@ 4 and in the 199@@ 0s , he was among others known as the ch@@ ef gar@@ re@@ th bla@@ ir .
advertising , docum@@ ent@@ aries , tv series , and film roll@@ s have shaped his next decade .
then came a docum@@ entary series for radio 4 with the title what &apos;s happening so great about ... ?
the first episode was about the sh@@ uk@@ on , the first one was about sha@@ kes@@ pe@@ are .
on sha@@ kes@@ pe@@ are , i was really aller@@ gic .
i had the opportunity to learn something about him at school and never thought about him , mostly for a domain of the middle class , white in string quar@@ tz .
so i had great fear .
all who we have to pay for the show are welcome to join peter hall , tre@@ v@@ or n@@ un@@ n , adri@@ an les@@ ter , ju@@ di den@@ ch said &quot; you should try it .
make it not bad , if you don &apos;t know what you are talking about .
take a few of the words in your mouth , and then you will be able to understand why we all sha@@ kes@@ pe@@ are so dear .
hen@@ ry led 20 lines from ot@@ to hel@@ los last speech for the docum@@ entary on and he was enthusi@@ astic .
i had the feeling that i was creating this .
it was almost as if i had been given a head at last .
&quot; that is what it is about , it is a serious thing , take it seriously , learn your text , research it a bit , &quot; he said .
the sam@@ ples were brut@@ al , and i read this piece for months , before we read it .
and it was a success .
it seemed to be an auto@@ cr@@ acy , and that happened .
and soon he entered the coalition of the two ir@@ rational and un@@ predic@@ table .
suddenly , i was in the national theatre and i could hardly believe it .
there was a moment when the commission thought that it was &quot; o@@ h , you &apos;ve changed . &quot;
there was a technical error and hen@@ ry felt in@@ st@@ in@@ ti@@ mid@@ ated that he had to enter@@ tain the audience .
&quot; a small voice told me &quot; you have to be 10 minutes brid@@ ging now , while you are repa@@ iring the computer . &quot;
instead , the council of stage artists announced that the new album will be released in the next few weeks .
i went from the stage and something was done .
i am not responsible for that .
i can understand that someone else .
&quot; you play in a theatre piece , so i stay in your role . &quot;
hen@@ ry in f@@ ences on du@@ ch@@ ess theatre , london .
the text for f@@ ences is not very demanding .
pan@@ ic is very good , the commission is strengthening its tend@@ encies .
that was also good , it is good , so it is like a great shi@@ eld of the go@@ ds , who tell me &quot; this is your determination &quot; .
he says so , of course , with a th@@ under@@ ous voice .
so i stay there .
i love that .
i love to be in a sample room , but i don &apos;t want to be too much .
hen@@ ry has always been a head of a com@@ edi@@ an - our con@@ vers@@ ation is full of hum@@ or@@ ous er@@ up@@ tions , while he has repeatedly im@@ it@@ ated people .
i have decided not to use stand@@ -@@ up@@ -@@ com@@ edy .
if you look at this all the time , you drive a wall .
i am sometimes standing in the apo@@ llo live , when i am lu@@ cky to be able to do so , but overall i don &apos;t have so much as before .
i ask him whether he has ever been a stand@@ -@@ up co@@ ach .
the fun we have in a room with a tab is not so great .
is this not his new in@@ kar@@ nation ?
i think so .
i am happy to be an actor .
it &apos;s fun .
it is always a story that is told , and that is great .
i love stories .
people love stories , but they don &apos;t want to know them .
hu@@ t@@ hi@@ -@@ re@@ be@@ ls are bloc@@ king streets in y@@ em@@ en ’ s capital city , y@@ em@@ en ’ s capital , y@@ em@@ en , and killing hundreds of thousands of people .
in the conflict between shi@@ a hu@@ th@@ i re@@ be@@ ls and the y@@ em@@ en@@ i government , the h@@ ut@@ i ’ s have led to civil dis@@ o@@ be@@ di@@ ence in the capital of san@@ a@@ a .
hu@@ t@@ hi@@ -@@ sup@@ porters could have had central streets in san@@ a@@ a on monday , said a spo@@ kes@@ man of hu@@ th@@ i party &quot; ans@@ ar al@@ lah &quot; .
the allocation of access to parliament was also bloc@@ ked .
y@@ em@@ en@@ i media report a traffic accident in the region of the capital .
according to the online edition of the newspaper &quot; ye@@ men post &quot; , hu@@ th@@ i leaders had ab@@ dul@@ m@@ ali@@ k al-@@ hu@@ th@@ i published a report on sunday evening on the measures taken .
hu@@ th@@ i dro@@ ve to the south of the island , according to the sheet , with another es@@ cal@@ ation of the conflict , if his demands are not met .
the shi@@ a h@@ ul@@ l ’ s struggle for greater independence from the sun@@ ni rul@@ ed y@@ em@@ en , and demand the re@@ sign@@ ation of the government .
the popular tri@@ be of the hu@@ th@@ i has been sie@@ ging the j@@ em@@ en@@ i capital for just over two weeks .
about 30@@ ,000 re@@ be@@ ls have been killed in protest camps in the great access routes of san@@ a@@ a .
the surrounding area is still a very hot spot for the bloo@@ dy batt@@ les with the y@@ em@@ en@@ i army .
ken@@ ya regi@@ sters officials who are &apos; s@@ ca@@ red &apos; and who are not allowed to be pun@@ ished .
ken@@ ya has begun to take all civil serv@@ ants bi@@ ome@@ tric , and the country has started to register &quot; g@@ host workers &quot; from the pay lists of the government .
employees who are in the next two weeks will not be registered .
the government susp@@ ects that thousands of people will be killed even after their exp@@ ul@@ sion from the public service .
president u@@ hur@@ u ken@@ y@@ at@@ ta has promised to make a commitment to the peace process when he takes office in 2013 .
in exam@@ ining the situation earlier this year , it was established that at least 1 million $ ( 7@@ 00@@ ,000 ) per month was paid to payments for &quot; g@@ host employees &quot; and other ab@@ u@@ sive financial practices .
the government susp@@ ects that sal@@ aries are still on the accounts , and that the government is not paying them .
all officials must now be able to work in the next two weeks at identification centres to ensure that their data is properly collected and processed via bi@@ ome@@ tric regi@@ stra@@ tions .
all who have not done so without a credible exc@@ use would be taken from the sal@@ ary list .
&quot; this approach will make a significant contribution to the ra@@ tion@@ alisation of public service by reducing the actual number of officials and also by increasing the pay list on both levels of government .
the scand@@ al of the art consult@@ ant hel@@ ge ach@@ en@@ bach will be the first to go to court on 11 november .
five he@@ irs from ber@@ th@@ old al@@ bre@@ cht , son of the al@@ di founder the@@ o al@@ bre@@ cht , are calling for a “ peace ” in a civil trial at the d@@ üs@@ sel@@ dorf regional court in d@@ üs@@ sel@@ dorf and two companies .
the shared a legal language , which was the official language on monday .
in the class@@ room , the word &quot; a@@ ach@@ en@@ bach &quot; refers to the fact that when purchasing art and classic cars , it was dec@@ ei@@ ved and ber@@ th@@ old al@@ bre@@ cht paid higher than actually paid purchase prices .
this also makes it possible to increase the agreed commission .
ach@@ en@@ bach has prepared for 12@@ 1 million euros valu@@ ables for al@@ bre@@ cht .
children need roots and fle@@ ets , and they need w@@ ings .
44 years he was in school , of which 23 were as school director .
from this time man@@ f@@ red rich@@ ter knows many st@@ acked pe@@ ter@@ sha@@ us@@ en@@ er and k@@ ol@@ l@@ b@@ ach@@ er from their time as students .
his methods were sometimes un@@ conventional , but he always wor@@ n by his ambition to be a man in the pu@@ p@@ il .
the snow@@ -@@ cap@@ ped mountain is the most famous mountain in the giant mountains .
man@@ f@@ red rich@@ ter lo@@ ves the painting with the mo@@ ti@@ f from his home country .
judge was born in tr@@ au@@ ten@@ au / north bo@@ hem@@ ia in 19@@ 30 , today tr@@ ut@@ no@@ v .
with 14 interested people he was interested in the subject of the first class of the teacher after four years .
one year later , the su@@ de@@ ten german@@ s were taken out of the country .
within a half hour , i had to leave the family .
after a few months in a camp , the first german army was going to bav@@ aria in 194@@ 6 .
the commission , for example , has been drag@@ ging jud@@ ges into the ob@@ er@@ fran@@ k@@ is@@ che sen@@ k@@ endor@@ f .
the teacher training took place in b@@ am@@ berg .
i would like to thank the president of the commission for his excellent work .
after two months , man@@ f@@ red rich@@ ter received a red cross award in a ba@@ z@@ a@@ ar in b@@ am@@ berg : together with up to 15 students in a dor@@ mit@@ ory .
in 195@@ 1 , he made the first and in 195@@ 4 after three years of study , the second head of state .
since ob@@ er@@ fran@@ c is not a free teacher &apos;s place , he applied for a job in ob@@ er@@ bay@@ er@@ n and joined the german academy of fine arts on november 1 , 195@@ 4 .
the &quot; m@@ illing machine &quot; is a very good choice for the first &quot; apartment &quot; in the school house .
in 195@@ 8 he moved to the new building of the teacher house next to the school and moved to a three-@@ room apartment .
this house bought man@@ f@@ red rich@@ ter 1980 , after the school in k@@ ol@@ l@@ bach was dis@@ solved in 196@@ 8 .
until then , there was no such thing as a “ school ” in k@@ ol@@ l@@ bach in the pe@@ ter@@ sha@@ us@@ en-@@ k@@ ol@@ l@@ bach school association , and five in pe@@ ter@@ sha@@ us@@ en .
from the school year 196@@ 8 / 69 , these were translated into pe@@ ter@@ sha@@ us@@ en in today ’ s town hall .
when the school association indi@@ er@@ s@@ dorf was founded , the school was left with primary school in the village .
to avoid a back@@ l@@ ash in the smaller school , the first two students changed to the university of vienna .
but pe@@ ter@@ sha@@ us@@ en grew , and so we could not keep children and their teachers from september 198@@ 2 on today &apos;s construction , which was built in 1997 by judge reti@@ rement .
man@@ f@@ red rich@@ ter pra@@ ises the un@@ complicated gener@@ os@@ ity of the may@@ or lu@@ d@@ wi@@ g g@@ ö@@ tz , who was born at the local expense , and who also built a workshop and expanded in 1997 .
&quot; may@@ or g@@ ö@@ tz was very scho@@ ol@@ -@@ friendly &quot; , judge than@@ ked .
in its entire career , man@@ f@@ red rich@@ ter has never used the speech of a government representative who was waiting for a post of a school council on justice and law .
&quot; you have to tell the children two things : roots and fl@@ our@@ ish , &quot; says the 8@@ 4-@@ year-@@ old .
and he had to learn : &quot; this is not always successful &quot; .
in any case , judge a@@ ung san su@@ u ky@@ i was sometimes un@@ conventional .
if students are tested , they were given a certificate from him not to be pen@@ alised and were not even taken to sit down .
at the expense of the community , jud@@ ges had had two pa@@ irs of bo@@ x@@ ing glo@@ ves and allowed the two compe@@ ting to enter the ground , even though it was a ve@@ il .
for the benefit of the school , jud@@ ges as rec@@ tor maintained a good relationship with the may@@ or lu@@ d@@ wi@@ g g@@ ö@@ tz ( c@@ su ) at the time .
this moved the party without party jud@@ g@@ ement after its reti@@ rement to at least be the last to be elected on the c@@ su list for the municip@@ al council in 1996 .
but jud@@ ges were placed in place six and entered the c@@ su .
18@@ 0 km in three days , the first three days of the year , the first one in three days .
hr@@ 4 cycling tour 700 bicycle ri@@ ders put their bra@@ kes on the right track in the spa park of bad salz@@ haus@@ en and sch@@ ot@@ ten .
if cy@@ cli@@ sts are on their tour in bad salz@@ haus@@ en or sch@@ ot@@ ten r@@ ast , this is nothing special in itself .
on friday , however , the number of re@@ sting impres@@ sions made alone : the 700 participants of the hr@@ 4 cycle tour and accompan@@ ying dr@@ uss enjoyed a break in the lower spa park of bad salz@@ haus@@ en and later a party under open water .
under the mo@@ tto &quot; cycling and celebr@@ ating on newly discovered paths between ni@@ d@@ da and kin@@ zi@@ g &quot; , the participants at the thursday in bad vil@@ bel met and found a concert of van bad@@ er &amp; band mi@@ ter@@ li@@ ert .
on friday , it was taken seriously : cy@@ cli@@ sts took the first stage , which took 60 kilometres over fl@@ or@@ stadt to bad salz@@ haus@@ en and further to sch@@ ot@@ ten .
in bad salz@@ haus@@ en , the sport@@ sm@@ en of the city were invited by may@@ or han@@ s-@@ peter s@@ eu@@ m , who was in bad vil@@ bel with his bike , and the head of the bad salz@@ haus@@ en own plant , pe@@ tra sch@@ w@@ ang@@ en .
to refres@@ h you body and mind was aller@@ gic to all kinds of good things : the landscape women from ran@@ stadt and lower austria were very happy with 85 lead plates .
&quot; such ca@@ kes can only be ba@@ ked in rural women &quot; , a particip@@ ant from a@@ ul@@ en@@ di@@ e@@ bach p@@ raised while he was or@@ dering another piece .
the be@@ verage bo@@ oth of the tur@@ n@@ vere@@ in ge@@ i@@ ß@@ -@@ ni@@ d@@ da was able to provide cold refres@@ h@@ ments .
the du@@ o br@@ av@@ o under@@ went a long and well known me@@ lo@@ dies from opera &apos;s and musical instruments .
the beautiful ambi@@ ence of the park has been relaxing .
a mr. enjoyed a lot of head@@ -@@ massage from his partner : &quot; the woman he deserves , finally he has a very long sp@@ run@@ g of bicycle cha@@ ins .
meanwhile , the may@@ or and the management board had to work : they were arrested at the foun@@ tain before drinking cure .
pro@@ mo is also a member of the german association of marketing professionals ( h@@ agen ) , since the first hr@@ 4 bike tour in 2004 , and has only been able to pass a short time , he had plenty of experience with the local technology .
his pic@@ k@@ up force is the largest in the world , and is used to transport over three phones and a radio unit with its employees and the 15 members of the motor@@ cycle season .
&quot; most of the participants come from the rh@@ ine main@@ -@@ region &quot; , explains the german minister of economics .
the number of participants is determined a bit by the criteria available .
in category i , participants will be accommo@@ dated in hotels , in category ii in accommodation .
from the spa , the cy@@ cli@@ sts had a good impression when they were back in the mountains after a year and a half : &quot; ch@@ ü@@ ss ! &quot;
&quot; it was nice to have a drink in bad salz@@ haus@@ en ! &quot; they were going to go away .
the hotel is located in the heart of the city , in the heart of the city , near the famous royal palace and the royal palace .
but in the evening the cy@@ cli@@ sts were in the id@@ yl@@ lic al@@ te@@ bur@@ g@@ park .
under the direction of the scot@@ tish society for tourism and city marketing ( g@@ ts ) , the park had a beautiful festival experience .

a total of 33 police officers were arrested in turkey on the grounds of susp@@ ici@@ on of &quot; con@@ spir@@ acy against the government &quot; , reports local media agencies .
police authorities have not given immediate comm@@ entary .
among the ar@@ re@@ sts are 14 high-@@ level polic@@ em@@ en , mel@@ ted in hur@@ ric@@ an@@ es , and the police arrested .
some of them were involved in the corruption investigations against government officials , including four government ministers in the last december .

not all children in ukraine are returning to school .
schools almost everywhere in ukraine opened their doors on monday ( september 1st ) after the summer holidays .
this day is tradi@@ tionally an important day for families and , like thousands of other ukra@@ inian parents , prime minister ar@@ sen@@ i@@ j j@@ az@@ en@@ ju@@ k brought his daughter to school .
there , he told waiting journalists that he had not been able to open all schools again , but that he was determined to open the country for future generations : he was a member of the european union for future generations :
the september celebra@@ tions were not held in every school .
the sky is not everywhere above ukraine peace@@ fully .
we must ensure a peaceful heav@@ en .
the whole of ukraine , a huge common ukra@@ inian economy , must be made to stand for a peaceful heav@@ en .

the first day of school of the new school year is tradi@@ tionally celebrated , with children taking their bre@@ ast with their em@@ bro@@ i@@ der@@ y , bal@@ lo@@ ons in their hands and giving their teachers flowers .
with ron@@ a fair@@ head , the b@@ bc has perhaps the greatest success for the director , who needs it .
it is taking place with a proud gl@@ ory .
and it has its own fron@@ t-@@ page experience .

in may , the commission described the task of chair@@ ing the committee with a po@@ is@@ oned kel@@ ch .
not only is b@@ bc still standing as a huge and complex entity in the heart of public life , but there is also an internal par@@ ado@@ x in its structure .
the confidence in the european union is tw@@ o@@ fold : inside to the first guard of its own management hier@@ arch@@ y in the bb@@ c , but also exter@@ n@@ ally as a voice of public concern and un@@ rest when things go wrong .
this ensures a fast and un@@ sustainable sc@@ ra@@ p of the game , which is to be called for in full reform .
but what new arrival is the president who would risk being forced to stand in the way of everything and to have an institution that is so complex ?
it is a difficult task .
and as if that were not enough , are there many other people interested in keeping the bb@@ c smaller ?
while the competition is getting closer and new technologies are bringing old , comfortable col@@ lateral to the fore , the upcoming negotiation of the license fees for the b@@ bc is with special dangers .
for the modest sum of eur 14@@ 5.@@ 50 million per year , the commission bu@@ ys eur 14@@ 5.@@ 50 in the surely largest media company in the world .

and it seems that the b@@ bc is increasing on the popul@@ arity s@@ cal@@ a again .
the visual and usage hab@@ its for the b@@ bc are very different .

it needs a considerable amount of chairman - i hope you have not found it .

ber@@ ke@@ ley explains how housing markets are once again being &quot; normal &quot; .
one of the most prominent figures in the construction industry in london pointed out that the construction sector is the most important in the south-@@ east of england .
home is a very popular destination for tourists and tourists alike .
ton@@ y pi@@ d@@ g@@ ley , founder and ceo of the company ho@@ ch@@ k@@ las@@ se ber@@ k@@ ele@@ y said on monday : &quot; since the beginning of the current financial year , the market has again fallen to normal transaction levels since the highest level in 2013 .
the real estate market in london was very frag@@ ile during the down@@ turn , as foreign bu@@ yers entered the capital .
according to the cat@@ aster@@ ide , the number of contracts in the city area last year alone increased by a factor of 18@@ .@@ 5 % , far more than the average increase in england and wal@@ es in general .
the average sales price is eur 2@@ 5.@@ 00 per month for ber@@ ke@@ ley private , cheap and student offers .
a stronger care for the economy , however , has led to real estate ownership in london for foreign bu@@ yers – some of them are also affected by the introduction of new property taxes and political rhe@@ tor@@ ic .
the london summit of real estate agents fo@@ x@@ ton has been warning in the past week that the price of mort@@ gage bonds in the april , in which sch@@ ä@@ r@@ fer@@ e credit spending is being cut .
new data from the bank of england on monday show a decline in mort@@ gage l@@ ending .
h@@ amp@@ tions international , another property agency , correc@@ ts the damage caused by the loss of property in the united kingdom in london by 20@@ 15 .
the transaction volume in the most expensive counter@@ parts of london is like ch@@ el@@ sea , london , and london .
however , the desire for a home in the capital is not a sufficient reason for ber@@ ke@@ ley to be able to make a bo@@ on , as the su@@ ms due for deri@@ v@@ ative sales are estimated at more than £ 2.@@ 2 billion .
mr pi@@ d@@ g@@ ley added that the commission is not prepared to respond to the demand for the right , well-@@ planned product at the best locations , and as a result , the sales of the term are stable .
in june , the european commission reported that it had taken 3,@@ 7@@ 42 new homes in the year up to the end of april - almost a third more than the peak of 2007 before the crisis .
the annual preliminary tax income rose by eur 40 per year to eur 2@@ 80 million .

na@@ ked photos of the os@@ car@@ pre@@ f@@ ec@@ ture winner j@@ enni@@ fer law@@ rence , were shot online by a h@@ ack@@ er who claimed to have a &quot; ma@@ st@@ list &quot; of images of another 100 star@@ lets .

he was a sta@@ tionary , as in i@@ gel , yes .
the last victim of this stal@@ em@@ ate was a straight start .
a@@ il@@ in sol@@ om@@ ons was a zi@@ ther and ten@@ der beauty with un@@ t@@ amed eyes .
it was associated with an older es@@ cor@@ t to the south , which ke@@ ver@@ n was holding for her a@@ un@@ t , and which had a land in a we@@ t but paradise valley with the ap@@ t name paradise valley .
for several years , no one in the house had lived .

ke@@ ver@@ n had a good time with al@@ il@@ in on the crus@@ hed stone .
your feet are too big .
due to their own aggres@@ si@@ veness , songs of this kind were no longer recorded on the con@@ sole .
not prohibited - nothing was really prohibited - just not played .
it has been successfully ob@@ sole@@ te , as the word ob@@ sole@@ te has been .
the general taste of the product was very good , and the rules would never have been achieved , and as people in books saw the vo@@ m plates rec@@ it@@ als at the mil@@ li@@ on@@ air@@ e mem@@ o@@ irs , cook@@ books and lo@@ ving books .
in the eu@@ ph@@ oria of the day , ke@@ ver@@ n began to create an imag@@ inary piano and to live in a gro@@ b com@@ ic se@@ ren@@ ade , ai@@ lin@@ n &apos;s great feet .
a@@ il@@ in understood the message .
&quot; this was a well-known song , a jazz sing@@ er , and a great song .
this was his father &apos;s constant effort to keep the letter j .
it had been a game between him and his father , when he was still small .
his father had to deal with his own father , so he had told .
if you want to add a word to a j without having to have two fing@@ ers over your li@@ ps , it costs you a pen@@ ny .
it was already no very lu@@ cky day to be able to play it , and it was not very fun@@ ny now either .
he knew that the problem was being solved .
it had to explain what jazz was , and what it was .
a@@ il@@ in had never had heard of anyone .
jazz in the first half of the 20th century was not directly prohibited .
the impro@@ vis@@ ation was no longer modern .
it was only space for a single &quot; if &quot; in life .
people wanted to be able to hear at the beginning of a me@@ lo@@ dy where they would end .
the commission &apos;s mind is also .
his un@@ predic@@ tability made the people ner@@ vous and ner@@ vous .
and jazz is a musical event , which was expressed in a way that was very strong .
although he was 10 years old , without being taken by sam@@ my dav@@ is junior , he was still un@@ aware of the fact that he was a jazz musici@@ an half secret .
but at least i had to learn ail@@ inn not to explain that f@@ ats w@@ all@@ er was black .
in her age she could probably not remember a time when she was a po@@ ps@@ än@@ ger not black .
again , the idea was that no laws or constra@@ ints were applied .
a con@@ for@@ man@@ t society meant that every element of this society was grateful to the principle of group gi@@ fts .
people with a@@ fro@@ -@@ caribbean dis@@ orders were affected by temper@@ ament and physical construction for under@@ n@@ our@@ ishment and sport , i.e. , san@@ g and ran them .
people who were originally from the indian sub@@ continent were not welcome as they were from nature with electronic tal@@ ents .
what is still to be left of the polish community is not concerned about the can@@ alisation of the se@@ wer ; what the gre@@ e@@ ks left was cr@@ um@@ bling plate .
those from the gulf states and the lev@@ ante , whose grand@@ parents have left the country quickly , were not able to escape the country quickly , as if it had happened , for fear , for mo@@ ist@@ ure .
each according to his abilities .
as they are only part of bal@@ la@@ d , ai@@ lin@@ n was finding it difficult to understand how the insul@@ ting and insul@@ ting words that ke@@ ver@@ n has just sent to her were to be heard .
music was an expression of love .
&quot; they are not really insul@@ ting , but they said ke@@ ver@@ n .
except perhaps for people whose feet are too big , they are not .
my father never ever met anyone .
he spoke to too much , but the negl@@ ected garden gave him the ch@@ ick@@ en of feeling of security .
nothing could stop the sound@@ proof from the huge co@@ al-@@ fi@@ red leaves .
a@@ il@@ in understood the need for a new , more efficient and more efficient system .
why would your father have loved something like this ?
he wanted to say that it was a ju@@ x , hesit@@ ated , but in their turn , to re@@ write two fing@@ ers to the li@@ ps .
they thought in any case that the commission had done something strange .
&quot; it seemed to him fun@@ ny to &quot; said he instead .
it sha@@ kes the eyes of dis@@ beli@@ ever@@ s and clo@@ ses the door to the eyes .
there was a great deal of talk about the world over when you were in a hur@@ ry .
there was nothing that he would otherwise have liked to see .
&quot; if you say it , &quot; my you without convic@@ tion .
but that is not yet why you should tell me .
it seemed honest to be concerned .
are my feet too big ?
he saw once again .
your feet are so straight not .
maybe your an@@ k@@ le , a little bit of ...
and tho@@ u sa@@ y@@ est h@@ ast me , because my an@@ k@@ les are too th@@ ick ?
you h@@ ate yourself ?
of course i h@@ ate you not .
this is only the du@@ mb song of the day .
he should have said &apos; i love you &apos; , but for that it was too early .
&quot; your th@@ ick butt@@ ons are not exactly the reason why you are giving me a taste of &quot; temp@@ ting &quot; .
i am a little bit per@@ verse .
the sound is not correct .
it had com@@ ical to say .
if he tried to k@@ iss kom@@ is@@ ch , he brought himself often into trouble , because he was like his father not over the cal@@ ming char@@ m .
perhaps his father wanted to be cru@@ el .
perhaps he wanted to be ke@@ ver@@ n , that is .
despite its friendly eyes .
a@@ il@@ in sol@@ om@@ ons was born in red and raised in the dark .
hol@@ der@@ bl@@ ü@@ t@@ we@@ in , so dr@@ un@@ ken@@ ness was not an exc@@ use for him .
in their ex@@ ci@@ tement , they seemed to trem@@ ble , as pal@@ m@@ we@@ del was in stor@@ m .
and thy di@@ ke head is exactly the reason why i am so per@@ verse .
besides that i have not even been .
it did him sor@@ row , both because of the unnecessary in@@ convenience of his words and because of the fear that his eyes felt , as he was against him .
thought it was that he would beat them ?
she had not told him of life on the cold north sea archi@@ pel@@ ago .
the same huge and e@@ is@@ kal@@ te ocean is the same as the one there on the shore .
the same confusion ar@@ ose between men and women , with even th@@ ick@@ er skin and more vulnerable to the effects of what happened than to make their an@@ ce@@ st@@ ors s@@ mu@@ gg@@ ler and beach rob@@ bers .
th@@ ick ?
they would have given her a big f@@ ist if she had not been fit !
it is only cr@@ ying - k@@ nu@@ t@@ sch@@ en was the most common tool for the language .
after ke@@ ver@@ n &apos;s view , this was an unnecessary re@@ fin@@ ement , as the cr@@ un@@ ching itself was already an act of violence .
a@@ il@@ in sol@@ om@@ ons announced to him by their body a sign to go .
he raised the question of the love of the child .
it felt like a permanent member of the european parliament , but the mag@@ nit@@ ude of its gri@@ ef surprised her .
that was not the end of the world .
she knew each other very little .
she saw him , as he had dist@@ ant - so he had been taken away from a room on the upper floor by her compan@@ ion - a man accused of being too much of a man himself .
ad@@ am leaves the garden , da@@ w@@ ned it .
it felt a su@@ dden pain and a feeling of pain for him and men in general , although some have raised their hands against them .
a man turned to the police and said that his back was pra@@ ying , ash@@ amed , defe@@ ated , without fighting .
when she was alone again , she looked at her sol@@ o mon@@ s .
several years before the elections that have just been told , the es@@ me nu@@ ss@@ bau@@ m , a smart , intelligent and enthusi@@ astic 3d anim@@ ation , worked in collaboration with o@@ f@@ no@@ w , the non-@@ legislative research leader .
&quot; it has been done a lot , and much still needs to be done , &quot; she wrote , &quot; to help the in@@ n@@ ate aggres@@ si@@ veness of a people , which is a thousand wars and most of them have won , especially in the lands .
but some features are not as yet ext@@ end@@ able .
the higher the church tower , the more it seems that the lower the passion for the church he continues to in@@ sp@@ ire .
the population is cr@@ ying out for s@@ enti@@ mental bal@@ lo@@ ons , depri@@ ved of sk@@ ill and sk@@ ill .
&quot; you have an unfortunate idea , &quot; he said .
i propose that we should have less romantic and less romantic .
es@@ me n@@ us@@ s@@ bau@@ m reduced its head .
i must also ask : are you a@@ the@@ ist ?
&quot; i believe that this must not be said , &quot; rep@@ lied es@@ me n@@ us@@ s@@ bau@@ m .
are you les@@ bian ?
again , the council of es@@ me agreed to their right to privacy and ref@@ usal to make a statement .
fem@@ in@@ ist ?
yet again , i am silent .
&quot; i ask this not , &quot; said lu@@ ther r@@ ab@@ in@@ ow@@ it@@ z finally , &quot; because i am against a@@ the@@ ism , reading or fe@@ tish .
the problem here is a pre@@ jud@@ ice free work place .
we serve a pre@@ jud@@ ice free society .
but certain types of hyper@@ sensitive information , which are in themselves totally acceptable and pra@@ is@@ e@@ worthy , can sometimes be achieved by results , such as those you have presented .
you yourself have obviously pre@@ jud@@ ged against the church , and these things that you have described as &apos; ob@@ scene &apos; and &apos; r@@ ough &apos; are not acceptable to others .
if you continue on the f@@ li@@ r@@ ting of what has happened , if it has happened , as if it were , then you will be able to do so yesterday .
es@@ me n@@ us@@ s@@ bau@@ m was looking around , while r@@ ab@@ in@@ ow@@ it@@ z spoke .
behind his head , a le@@ d-@@ writer repeated the same thing in fl@@ am@@ ing@@ or@@ os@@ a , the of@@ no@@ w gave the country last four months of the year or more .
s@@ miles in your neighb@@ our , enjoy the beauty of your partner , listen to b@@ all@@ ads , visit musi@@ c@@ als , use your phone , talk to us , explain what you are doing , vote and listen .
speaking is better than silence , that is healthy and the word is better than what is written , but nothing is better than love .
&quot; i fully understand what i am looking for , &quot; he rep@@ lied .
my concern is that the commission will not be able to deal with this issue without warning , as we have done , and we will be able to repeat the mistakes that have been made at all .
this time it is not the other , however , that we should express our an@@ ger and mi@@ str@@ ust .
lu@@ ther r@@ ab@@ in@@ ow@@ it@@ z shaped with the hands a py@@ ram@@ id .
to achieve closer ties between the european union and the united states , it is important to bear in mind that this is the case .
&quot; they go too far , &quot; he said , &quot; if they consider acts as &quot; error &quot; , which our grand@@ parents may or may not understand , they have not committed .
they also go too far when they assume that the eu is not going to stop their &apos; an@@ ger &apos; and their &apos; mi@@ str@@ ust &apos; of &apos; others &apos; .
it should not be necessary to remove someone from the list in their position who is responsible for the way in which we understand the past , as in the protection of the present , and not from &apos; us &apos; and &apos; others &apos; .
there was no &apos; we &apos; and there was no &apos; other &apos; .
it was a time of dis@@ order that is all i wanted to know .
&quot; from the if we are honest to ourselves , we are &quot; d@@ ared es@@ me to throw &quot; no part of society claim to be a good be@@ having .
i would not compla@@ in to anyone .
whether it is bad or good , what has happened is a matter of fact .
that was then .
to do this , nothing more needs to be said - we agree on that .
and , just as no blame should be assigned , the imf must not be bl@@ amed for failing to do so .
but what is the past , if we do not learn from it - and i am not learning from it - and we do not learn from it - is the past - and what is it ?
the past serves to make us understand it .
if i have something to say on this - and i am not going to say anything about it - i would like to say something about it - i think that i am not going to be a member of the commission .
lu@@ ther r@@ ab@@ in@@ ow@@ it@@ z left his py@@ ram@@ id to collapse .
&quot; i will read your report , &quot; he said , and dis@@ missed it .
the next day , when you are in the business as usual , she was taken by a motor@@ cycle driver , who , as pas@@ ser@@ s-@@ by described , was in a kind of &apos; brut@@ al r@@ age &apos; on the foot .

les@@ o@@ th@@ o military member says that no state cou@@ p is planned ; prime minister remains in south africa , and the prime minister remains in south africa .
official representatives of the military in les@@ o@@ th@@ o argu@@ ed that a cou@@ p was to be over@@ thro@@ wn .
prime minister thomas th@@ ab@@ ane f@@ led the country and told us that he had been arrested by the country &apos;s army .
the premier brought his family to the an@@ de@@ an south africa after he was killed by ass@@ ass@@ ins and he was arrested .
military spo@@ kes@@ man major n@@ t@@ l@@ e@@ le n@@ to@@ i said that it is de fac@@ to not a cou@@ p d &apos;@@ é@@ t@@ at , but that the military respon@@ ded to the threat posed by &quot; political fan@@ a@@ tics &quot; whose weapon was being armed .
&quot; what was happening this morning was that the staff of defence forces were being replaced by the police at les@@ o@@ th@@ o , after having received several intelligence reports that there were some elements within the police that were actually some of the political party political parties .
the south african government spo@@ kes@@ man , cla@@ y@@ son mon@@ y@@ ela , said that the military action has given the impression of over@@ thro@@ wing .
&quot; even if no one has claimed that the government is being tor@@ n down by violence , the rest of the reports agree that the activities of the defence forces are being carried out by les@@ o@@ th@@ o to date as evidence of a cou@@ p . &quot;
spo@@ kes@@ man for the military of les@@ o@@ th@@ o announced on sunday that the army &apos;s troops had been in their bar@@ r@@ acks .
in the meantime , the vice-president of the mo@@ th@@ he@@ t@@ jo@@ ya met@@ sing takes over the governance of the company during th@@ ab@@ an@@ es ’ absence .
th@@ ab@@ ane told me that he had believed that he was guil@@ ty of trying to get rid of corruption in the country .
in les@@ o@@ th@@ o there have been major ten@@ sions since june , after th@@ ab@@ ane parliamentary sessions have been cancelled due to the cl@@ ash@@ es in his single government .
he said that his actions had not prevented the government from taking action , but that other acc@@ us@@ ations were made .
production in the eurozone on a 13@@ -@@ month low level is not possible .
the increase in production in the eurozone is slow@@ ing the growth in august to the lowest level in the last 13 months , so a very observ@@ able increase in the number of study .
the final mark@@ t purchasing manager index of the product produced is published .
a data over 50 gives an expansion of the range .
new orders were sent back and fac@@ tories experienced impressive break@@ down@@ s in a time of rising ten@@ sions between the eu and russia over ukraine .
the figures are coming up before the european central bank ( ecb ) meeting on thursday .
the markets expect the bank to provide a clear plan for dealing with a hesit@@ ant recovery in the eurozone , as well as for the im@@ pending de@@ fl@@ ation of an inflation rate of only 0.@@ 3 % .
there is spec@@ ulation that the european council &apos;s head of the ecb , mari@@ o drag@@ hi , will be able to provide further information this week as to whether he will make quanti@@ tative eas@@ ing for the eurozone , in accordance with those who are affected by the united kingdom .
&quot; although a small growth is better than no growth at all , the bra@@ kes are the most severe effects of the growing economic and geo@@ political un@@ certain@@ ties for manufacturers , &quot; said ros@@ ner .
the factory p@@ mi for germany , the largest trading partner of russia in the eu , fell to the lowest level in the 11 months with 5@@ 1.@@ 4 .
in the meantime , the us economy fell by more than 50 % in the second largest economic nation of the blo@@ c , the p@@ mi .
france remains a wor@@ ried child , as is the decline of italy from a solid base of expansion .
indic@@ ations that growth opportunities are not being taken into account in the key infrastructure mechanism of germany and in spain and the netherlands are now being considered .
the decline in industry is likely to fuel the fire of analy@@ sts , who are still holding out further monetary or fiscal incentives .
a positive news came from the republic of ireland , where the p@@ mi was raised to 5@@ 7.@@ 3 , the highest level since the end of 1999 .
ho@@ ward ar@@ cher , the chief econom@@ ist , at i@@ h@@ s global insi@@ ghts , said : &quot; this is the best thing you can do for the purchasing management in@@ d@@ ices of the manufacturing industry in the euro area in august , is to do .
he added that the commission &apos;s proposal is to find the lives of producers in the euro area quite difficult at the moment , as the current increased geo@@ political ten@@ sions , particularly with regard to russia and ukraine , are still un@@ certain in many countries .
this increased un@@ certain@@ ties have clearly shown the economy to be affected - especially , and confidence in the consumer , and probably leads to the loss of some orders .
he said that it is &quot; always more likely &quot; to be that the ecb will eventually be a kind of q@@ e .
the hel@@ l decade of the survi@@ v@@ ors of bes@@ lan : ten years have passed since the terrible sie@@ ge of the school .
ten years ago , more than 1@@ ,000 people were killed by chec@@ hen mil@@ i@@ ti@@ as in a school in bes@@ lan in southern russia .
more than 3@@ 30 people , more than half of them children , were killed in the three-@@ day mar@@ ty@@ r@@ dom that the world had sho@@ c@@ ked , killed , and w@@ oun@@ ded .
we are looking for bes@@ lan , a city that has been the victim of some of the victims who have died in the at@@ ro@@ cities of the class .
exactly a decade after the po@@ pe ’ s terrible sie@@ ge in be@@ sie@@ ged poland , when 3@@ 34 people were killed , including 18@@ 6 children , the leaders war@@ ned that the her@@ o@@ ic survi@@ v@@ ors were facing a new apo@@ c@@ aly@@ pse .
as a fan@@ a@@ tical islam@@ ist terrorists , children and parents were killed on 1 september 2004 , the beginning of a new school year , and killed hundreds , the islamic country seemed to be doing so .
the tragedy uni@@ tes west and east , in ab@@ om@@ in@@ able terms , and transformed into a surprise .
ten years later , we are still in bes@@ lan .
we found surprising young people who were resi@@ sting , who were not able to remember the mem@@ ories of this terrorist hel@@ l fore@@ ver .
its greatest hope ?
the fact that the war that has now struck ukraine - and in which children like them die - is now ending .
the girl who is sitting in the trial was not able to enter the sh@@ at@@ tered school sports hall .
it was created by the russian star photograph@@ er di@@ mit@@ ri beli@@ ak@@ ov .
it is totally conf@@ used to find a way to help her mother l@@ ar@@ is@@ sa , now 40 years old .
both were released for death , but they were survi@@ ving .
&quot; a woman told me i should be asked for my life , but i could not , &quot; said ai@@ da then .
my leg@@ s were bloo@@ d@@ stream .
i stood up and clim@@ bed again .
a soldi@@ er brought them safe@@ ly .
after a series of operations , she remained in a position of total heal@@ ing , but said yesterday : &quot; three months ago , the pain returned .
i fear that the only thing i can do is to operate again .
some g@@ ren@@ ade sh@@ ards are still in my k@@ ne@@ e .
their aim is now to create a d@@ enti@@ st who can help people to improve their health , as they are helped by doctors .
&quot; this tragedy changed the way i live , but it has not sh@@ at@@ tered me , &quot; she says mar@@ tial flu@@ id .
&quot; this is what happened to me , and that is something that cannot be changed .
once a year i go to the sports hall and i am sure i will get back to the people who have stayed there .
my friends and i try to be in other days not to talk about it .
the pain is too great .
my best friend , and future class mates , is the d@@ zer@@ a g@@ apo@@ ev@@ a .
we played together to form a small team , and dre@@ amed of being a little bit more than we had thought .
&quot; i do not want to mar@@ ry until i finish my studies and my career .
to a family , i am thinking later .
she says that the sie@@ ge is always part of her .
i am glad that the many people are on the planet still remember our hor@@ r@@ ors and we are so grateful for the help we have received from people in britain and everywhere .
if i have the photo of me online , how to get to school , i will see how to get a lot of people to see it for the first time , understand our disaster and help make it happen again .
the young , who was killed by the ball h@@ al , in the opinion that his mother was dead , was killed .
it was his first school day ( rus@@ sians go with 7 years to school ) and he survi@@ ved the thir@@ ty days of sie@@ ge in the poor of his mother tam@@ ara .
when the sevent@@ h year he said , &apos; m@@ ama has told me i should not be allowed to go into the future if there is an explo@@ sion , and your hand . &apos;
after an explo@@ sion , he thought she would die .
she said to him : &apos; run . &apos;
full of fear , you can be dead , f@@ led and saw on the way a wine .
his father v@@ la@@ di@@ mir , who was his son out into the arms of the family , said : &quot; dam@@ ir told me that his mother died .
he said : &apos; i could not re@@ tri@@ eve them &apos; .
in fact , tam@@ ara was out there .
after re@@ unification , she said : &apos; i we@@ pt with joy .
i could not believe it .
he ran her@@ ring and surrounded the city .
dam@@ ir was later moved to london .
&quot; this hor@@ ror pursu@@ es you every day , but i wish you were able to live with re@@ member@@ ing , &quot; he said yesterday .
but i can say that it is in my memory that i have been bl@@ at@@ ant .
i do not know that i will be able to buy all my to@@ y pi@@ st@@ ols immediately after that .
but now i can play computer games with fire@@ places .
&quot; i have no fear of being in the sports hall , &quot; he said .
i remember the first time these children were in my country in the cour@@ ty@@ ard , and they were not going out .
we never say that they are killed , but we do not say that they are dead .
we say that they are capable of being used in the sports hall .
i remember the very first days of my trip to london , especially the to@@ y shop , where i saw everything i wanted to know about the game .
but now he is afraid of place like ukraine , where wars and the way of dis@@ fortun@@ e cause the kind of disaster he and his friends suffered .
this hor@@ ror is following you every day , but i wish you were able to stop being so hor@@ ri@@ fied .
&quot; i am so sorry for all those who have suffered under the at@@ ro@@ cities , &quot; said dam@@ ir , the past man who was a voluntary in a monaster@@ y last week .
i will be happy to help .
i want to come to the police one day and i hope that you will visit me next year at the school academy .
his mother , tam@@ ara , 48 , said : &quot; 37 children from our neighbor@@ hood were killed , and they cannot afford the same ?
i remember the first time that the european union was so ti@@ mid , it was simply not children who were calling and calling .
it re@@ members vi@@ vi@@ dly their journey to london with dam@@ ir .
people in london were we@@ aring a s@@ na@@ ke when i told our story .
i understood at that time how people on the other side of the world felt our feel@@ ings , and their support showed .
it was ch@@ eri@@ e bla@@ ir and her foundation grateful for the price and opportunity to present a report to london in autumn 2004 .
i wish that i could be ch@@ eri@@ e and her just to tell her that 10 years have passed .
i remember the first time that i was happy to meet bor@@ sch@@ ts@@ ch and she all visited the russian restaurants .
i remember the time when he was with kel@@ le@@ ys in a restaurant , and dam@@ ir shot with his water pi@@ st@@ ol on them and they ran out of water and played with him .
and that was just a month after the hor@@ ror .
i was surprised that the british were so willing to accept our pain .
she said : &apos; i still think that this world is in these 10 years no better than it has been .
in ukraine , the war is now continuing , and every day people die , and i believe that many children are killed .
these are precisely the children we have .
i think that the same applies to many of the war .
i simply know what these people feel , the whole hor@@ ror , and i know that they are all hor@@ ror .
and i cannot agree to the fact that we are .
nothing has changed , the people want to keep changing and they want to kill each other .
dam@@ ir was big and is a very gent@@ le and quiet place .
he is looking for a ra@@ pe , for example , he is not overwhel@@ med by the past at@@ ro@@ cities .
i know that he is not happy to remember that , but he has six close friends from the class and they go occa@@ sion@@ ally to the sports hall and to the infl@@ am@@ mation there c@@ and@@ les .
when he was smaller , he suffered from it - i remember the first time he was in the room .
not sle@@ eping , his eyes were open .
i remember the same thing when i was in the office , when he was in the office , war@@ ned of all his weapons and other military to@@ ys .
i can hardly believe that i have spent a few hours so sure that he was dead .
when i asked about the explo@@ sion , and on the br@@ ine came my head , i saw that the water was sh@@ ut down and the hel@@ l was running around me , with all around me .
i was absolutely sure that my little boy was in this hel@@ l impossible to survive .
&quot; i remember the first time i had been assigned to him , &quot; dam@@ ir , lau@@ f , lau@@ f away &quot; , but i was also so sure that he didn &apos;t hear me .
but he has heard it and he has gone away .
and so it goes life , unlike the many other , for us to go further .
geor@@ gi@@ j il@@ y@@ in , 17 years old , was born in the city of london , germany .
the young , whose terrible image was taken after the sie@@ ge to the symbol of the at@@ ro@@ cities of bes@@ lan , was killed .
comfort : the be@@ s@@ lan@@ -@@ over@@ flow is now a her@@ o of the geor@@ gi@@ j ly@@ in with his mother fa@@ tim@@ a after the sie@@ ge in 2004 , a picture of geor@@ gi@@ j on the right of geor@@ gi@@ j today .
his bloo@@ d@@ stream life is a long time coming .
his picture was one of the most sho@@ cking symb@@ ols of the bar@@ bar@@ ity of be@@ sla@@ m .
his mother fa@@ tim@@ a , 54 , a physi@@ ci@@ an , had chosen him for his first school day , before she was left to go , to leave her older son v@@ la@@ di@@ mir to university .
&quot; i left the court about two minutes , before the terrorists came to cr@@ y .
not entirely alone , there was a whole family of rela@@ tives of us , but they were all killed .
only my geor@@ gi@@ j managed to get to survive .
the closer this date comes , the more serious the situation will be .
there is not a single day when we can no longer get used to this tragedy .
we do not think that it was a long time ago , i think it would have happened yesterday , some scenes from these days watch me fore@@ ver .
no one will ever forget that , but i promise you that .
in@@ tri@@ gu@@ ing : the image of geor@@ gi@@ j ( left ) was one of the most sho@@ cking of the attack and was described as stat@@ ue ( right ) .
i remember the time when george w. bush was in power .
i knew that the commission would be on the move until the end of the day when i saw him on television .
and now there is even this stat@@ ue of the we@@ eping geor@@ gi@@ j in san mar@@ ino .
geor@@ gi@@ j sees the image not like , and it is not too much at home in the book@@ shel@@ f .
i understand that , but i also think that the people of the world , thanks to this picture , will feel our pain .
geor@@ gi@@ j says today : &apos; it is important to do that never again .
&quot; i doubt that the people of europe will ever know the truth .
people are stu@@ dying such trag@@ e@@ dies again and again and never experience the truth .
and now they are exam@@ ining the cr@@ ash of this bo@@ eing in ukraine .
will we ever learn that the european union has caused him ?
this world will become something terrible .
&quot; i can not understand how the possible is , because if you do not ask people , no one wants a war , so how does that happen ?
ten years is not a problem at all with such pain .
we need do@@ z@@ ens of years to get it a little forgotten .
it has affected my health and i feel that it is still .
about three or four years ago i had a couple of night@@ ma@@ res about the sie@@ ge , but then it became better .
i went later in 2004 again to school and had every day fear .
i thought of my friends and compla@@ ined about the fact that i was killed .
that is why i always go to the sports hall when the 1st september is ne@@ arer .
i will not repeat my old child@@ hood friends .
it is difficult for me to go into the sports hall .
i feel very un@@ comfortable as a victim of this , this story is now part of my past .
i will not forget that , but i am also bl@@ aming for it .
my life goes on .
i have this year school closed and i visit a medical college in the w@@ la@@ di@@ k@@ av@@ k@@ a@@ z .
i will be a cor@@ dial sur@@ ge@@ on .
my first choice was to train in the army .
i wanted to be a soldi@@ er , but my health didn &apos;t let that happen .
i wanted to make a fight for my country , but that will not happen .
geor@@ gi@@ j fan@@ i@@ ye@@ v , 20 years old , 20 years old , is a member of the european parliament , 20 years old .
the young , who survi@@ ved , although he was at the foot of a mur@@ der@@ ous terrorist , was killed .
a mir@@ acle : geor@@ gi@@ j fan@@ i@@ ye@@ v was a prison@@ er during the sie@@ ge at the foot of a mur@@ der@@ ous terrorist , but he managed to escape .
during the sie@@ ge he was in the sports hall .
it is a real mir@@ acle that he is not killed .
&quot; we feel it as if it was yesterday .
it is still the case with me , it is nothing i can do behind me .
i am now older and the people say that they are easy to cope with bad experiences .
&quot; in 2006 i worked with psycho@@ logi@@ sts and felt like a little better after that , but i can not forget it .
and i would like to forget .
2005 - in the year after , the first and only time that i have returned to the sports hall was in the city hall .
i lost my life and my mind .
i will never go back to where i asked you .
survi@@ v@@ ors : geor@@ gi@@ j fan@@ i@@ ye@@ v today , with a photo of himself in the hospital after the sie@@ ge on the lap@@ top .
my pain is un@@ fe@@ t@@ tered and i wear it every day with me .
my friends know that i am not happy to think about it or speak about it , and they never asked me about the school .
physi@@ cally , i like it .
i should be careful with my ver@@ sed k@@ ne@@ e , but i can now run well .
but because of my health i could not stop at the secret service academy of the f@@ s@@ b in saint pe@@ ter@@ sburg .
i have not yet received my documents , including medical documents , and you have answered that it is not possible .
my second passion was the animals , so i went to the animal medical centre .
i have already had two years behind me .
he lear@@ ns to treat all animals &quot; from c@@ ats to kit@@ tens &quot; .
he said : &apos; i knew that i was going to give my children never to report on my experiences .
we should not be surprised if children do not know about this and they should not suffer it .
his mother marina , 42 , said : &quot; this pain is leaving me never .
it is in my soul , worse , if the anniversary of the coming year is appro@@ aching .
i will be going to the celebra@@ tions to comm@@ em@@ or@@ ate .
i know that geor@@ gi@@ j is not going to go .
it must be made much more vigor@@ ous for him , because he was there and i am not .
i wa@@ ited at home for him and could not help .
i am so grateful to god that he has returned me , and here in bes@@ lan we are all convinced that this is the case .
it remains in us .
geor@@ gi@@ j is now an adult who is not a hor@@ ror .
it is difficult to understand that , if a little bit more un@@ fair@@ ness is allowed to happen .
it is a young , he li@@ kes sport , but he can be re@@ war@@ ded for his k@@ ne@@ e .
he has been operated several times , he can run , but he cannot do sport .
i would say that he has the hor@@ ror to 50 % .
this terrible experience will not stop us .
many friends and neighbours were killed in the sie@@ ge .
i have seen many people lost , who i knew well and who are expensive to me .
my son is with me and that is the greatest gift i can give to me .
i know from families , where new children are born , but also from wi@@ do@@ ws , who have never been married again .
it is hard to accept that the life of the people continues , even if we do not want it .
i will never forget how my heart was in me .
and now i see what is happening in the world - wars , wars in other regions .
what are these people fighting for ?
why do they kill each other ?
the war is a matter of great concern to our country and i almost do not believe it .
we used to be a friendly country , how can it be that we now fight ?
people and children suffer , i am sure that in the ukraine , many children have already been killed and many more have been killed .
if we are to achieve all these re@@ be@@ ls and throw away - as far away as possible .

4 tips for better entertainment and more .
if you like to see photos or videos under water , there is a selection of devices .
the low-@@ cost option is a water den@@ sity po@@ ol@@ -@@ and-@@ water sho@@ ot , as the ni@@ kon cool@@ pi@@ x p@@ 6@@ 000 is or a accessories for action .
i have taken these photos with a family celebr@@ ation with several cameras , all of which are at a price below $ 3@@ 50 .
regardless of the equipment , there are some rules for the best results .
check your equipment twice a day .
even if you are looking for a water@@ proof camera , make sure that you have the battery in your hands and other th@@ reads th@@ ick .
imagine your camera also on the photos or videos .
some cameras and cam@@ cor@@ ders have scen@@ ari@@ os and recording settings .
and before they enter into , they check the way they are in the depth of their equipment .
some cameras are only available for up to 5 feet , others up to 50 or 60 feet .
are you looking for a new product in our shopping guide and the reviews about digital cameras for conventional and water@@ proof models .
make multiple calls to your computer - because many don &apos;t get ti@@ ed .
poin@@ t-@@ and-@@ click is a powerful tool for creating and managing digital images .
even if you are using an l@@ cd , it is difficult to do this under water , and the right image setting is a happy solution .
so make many sho@@ ts .
if your camera has a sequ@@ ence mode , you can set a number of sho@@ ts with slightly modified exposure settings .
stay close to the surface .
the light is dram@@ atically worse , the further it moves away from the surface .
if possible , then stay close to the surface , if you want to take sho@@ ts in a pool , lake or sea .
this allows you to select more color in your photos ; the de@@ eper you go , the less color you will see .
go di@@ stances and you will be able to see the objects .
this is also important on land .
it is particularly important that we do not have to wait for a single action c@@ am : these devices often have a solid wide@@ -@@ angle lens , which means that the camera is more den@@ sely adapted to your objects than the one you are working on .
andre@@ w law@@ son was a man of the sor@@ te , whose character has changed things , even in such a gi@@ gan@@ tic organization as the n@@ h@@ s .
as an advisory an@@ aes@@ the@@ si@@ st , he devoted his career to the task of providing the si@@ ck with both the ag@@ ony of the disease and the ag@@ ony of treatment .
among his patients , he re@@ members that he was a mi@@ 6 employee , who was familiar with the dev@@ ast@@ ating effects of torture .
law@@ son w@@ us@@ ste knew that the doctors were not allowed to carry out diagno@@ ses and ill@@ nesses , while the patients treated mostly with something completely different .
one day in 2007 was he , however , the one whose passion for the game began .
&quot; i have not felt like a man , &quot; wrote the book in may of this year .
i had difficulties in getting up and running .
while he was playing with the fl@@ u symp@@ t@@ oms , he noticed that he was not able to help his wife ju@@ li@@ et im@@ pati@@ ently .
&quot; i want everything more immediately than later &quot; , wri@@ tes he .
when ju@@ li@@ et was released for a week on a business trip , the company felt like a lo@@ ver .
something is missing in the last week &apos;s air .
he asked for a colleague to be a x-@@ ray of his brother .
only two weeks ago , he was in the french alps to ski .
the result of the x-@@ ray inspection was a result .
he suffered from br@@ on@@ chi@@ tis , a dis@@ cur@@ sive cancer that was caused by the bre@@ ast fur , that is , the lun@@ gs , to get rid of .
as with most cre@@ ams , the disease is not exactly the cause of the problem .
for example , while some smo@@ kers are dying of l@@ ung cancer , others are not aware of all l@@ ung cancer cases .
but mes@@ o@@ the@@ li@@ om is different .
in almost all cases , the shut@@ ter release is an as@@ be@@ sto@@ s load - contact with the fi@@ bre material , which was once known as &quot; wonder &quot; but has now been identified as fat@@ al .
for most of us , mes@@ o@@ the@@ li@@ om is a disease that , like easily ignored , can be ignored .
as@@ be@@ sto@@ s is , after all , a product of the past .
the most dangerous as@@ be@@ sto@@ s type was found in britain since the 19@@ 60 ’ s , when the industry volun@@ tar@@ ily decided to use as@@ be@@ sto@@ s .
there too , where he is still in place , only people working in certain industries are directly involved in the substance - pl@@ um@@ bers , construction workers , car@@ p@@ ent@@ ers and shi@@ py@@ ard workers , for example .
as an industrial ge@@ ar@@ box made of a different time , it seems to be now almost more worrying than ever .
but this self-@@ satisfaction is in@@ appropriate .
britain , it seems , is experiencing the cul@@ min@@ ation of a mes@@ o@@ the@@ li@@ om episode today .
there are more deaths from mes@@ o@@ the@@ li@@ om here than in any other country in the world .
with a total of 2,@@ 500 deaths per year , twice as many people die from this disease as from road accidents .
annual figures for mes@@ o@@ the@@ li@@ om@@ ic deaths since 1980 and forec@@ ast growth rates in the us and europe are expected to rise .
the reason why we are not able to control the dead@@ ly effects now , even though as@@ be@@ sto@@ s has been illegal for years ( in 1999 all types of as@@ be@@ sto@@ s were banned ) is that a mes@@ o@@ the@@ li@@ om is only developing after decades .
and the s@@ cour@@ ge of mes@@ o@@ the@@ li@@ om is not due to former workers of the construction industry .
as@@ be@@ sto@@ s was , and is often still , present in the houses where we live , the offices , in which we work , the schools , in which we learn and the shops in which we shop .
and that &apos;s why mes@@ o@@ the@@ li@@ om knows no class@@ room boundar@@ ies , financial boundar@@ ies , profes@@ sions or age .
the privileged and well-@@ equipped bas@@ tions , surrounded by the elegant department stores in london and private schools , are not a shel@@ ter .
the parliament buildings are as@@ be@@ sto@@ s contam@@ inated .
in the hospit@@ als , in which we are healthy , too , we are already known as the starting point of this dead@@ ly car@@ cin@@ o@@ gen .
andre@@ w law@@ son was not old .
he was also not a pl@@ um@@ ber .
it was not easy for him to find a way to imagine where he might be dealing with as@@ be@@ sto@@ s .
then he found it out .
&quot; it looks like the world is in a good condition in the tun@@ nels at gu@@ y &apos;s hospital , where i have spent six years training .
all - students , nur@@ ses , doctors , and nur@@ ses - are required to use the tunnel .
one won@@ ders how many of my fellow members are involved in the same disease ?
this question was unfortunately not answered at least in part .
&quot; of the four doctors who have been working at the gu@@ y &apos;s hospital , the only one who has been in the last five years at mes@@ o@@ the@@ li@@ om is the one who wrote .
how many of us will be more ill ?
andre@@ w la@@ wn@@ son has been appointed mes@@ o@@ the@@ li@@ om at the age of 48 .
when he was on 17 february this year , he was 5@@ 5th in the category of the star trek : the next generation .
that was an unusual long over@@ life@@ time .
fif@@ ty per cent of all mes@@ o@@ the@@ li@@ o@@ graphy ran@@ ks die within 8 months of diagno@@ sis .
the disease always ends dead@@ ly .
we can therefore only act as law@@ son ’ s question : &quot; how many of us will be ill ? &quot;
the leading expert in britain , on mes@@ o@@ the@@ li@@ om , professor ju@@ lie , has been a member of the european union between 18@@ 70 and 20@@ 50 , when as@@ be@@ sto@@ s was first discovered in britain .
most of them have no place at the moment , but they are dying in this way .
an as@@ be@@ sto@@ s mine in que@@ be@@ c , canada al@@ am@@ y al@@ am@@ y , al@@ am@@ y canada , al@@ am@@ y al@@ am@@ y , al@@ am@@ y canada , al@@ am@@ y al@@ am@@ y al@@ am@@ y , al@@ am@@ y , canada , al@@ am@@ y and al@@ am@@ y , al@@ am@@ y , al@@ am@@ y , al@@ am@@ y , is now al@@ am@@ y , is a major .
a short view of the files of the courts , of which the interested parties are often remin@@ ded for claims for damages , shows how far the s@@ cour@@ ge of the mes@@ o@@ the@@ li@@ om is already spre@@ ading .
in june this year mar@@ ks &amp; fun@@ cer , for example , announced that jan@@ ice was guil@@ ty of as@@ be@@ sto@@ s by all neglig@@ ent means .
she worked nine years for the chain , from 197@@ 8 to 198@@ 7 and was responsible for the clothes industry .
m@@ r@@ s. all was only 18 years when they had been in office at m &amp; s .
now it has two children in the tw@@ en@@ ties .
&quot; before this thing , &quot; she says , &quot; i had never heard of mes@@ o@@ the@@ li@@ om , i knew that i was not even able to learn anything about as@@ be@@ sto@@ s .
i never thought that the people of the city would be interested in that .
there is only a few people who know a lot about as@@ be@@ sto@@ s .
the fact is that the term as@@ be@@ sto@@ s does not have a substance but a group of six min@@ er@@ als .
the name deri@@ ves from the word &quot; as@@ be@@ sto@@ s &quot; , a description of the fi@@ bre structure that character@@ iz@@ es the fab@@ ric resi@@ li@@ ent and flexible .
three of the six were built in the construction industry .
ch@@ ry@@ so@@ til , also known as white as@@ be@@ sto@@ s , is the most common method of transport today .
it was designed for roof panels , floor tiles , ro@@ h@@ ris@@ ol@@ ations , bo@@ il@@ ers sol@@ it@@ ations , even for bra@@ ke co@@ at@@ ings in cars .
it is less fat@@ al than other as@@ be@@ sto@@ s , but it is still being used by the eu and the who as &apos; major health risk &apos; with possible death .
dangerous is the fact that the brown as@@ be@@ sto@@ s ( am@@ o@@ sit ) and the blue as@@ be@@ sto@@ s ( cro@@ ky@@ do@@ lit@@ h ) are more dangerous .
britain was once the world ’ s largest im@@ porter of brown as@@ be@@ sto@@ s , and experts susp@@ ect that &quot; there are clear but indirect indic@@ ations that it is doing so as a major reason for the uni@@ qu@@ ely high mes@@ o@@ the@@ ism .
an employee of marks &amp; sp@@ enc@@ er was arrested in the flag@@ ship store in the o@@ x@@ ford street , london , as@@ be@@ sto@@ s al@@ am@@ y .
jan@@ ice allen has been perhaps not a typical example of mes@@ o@@ the@@ li@@ om@@ op@@ fer , but the work of ju@@ lio car@@ los i suggests that he is a man of history .
he has carried out a study by the people concerned showing that the &apos; one essential part of the mes@@ o@@ the@@ li@@ om@@ es without a known suspension through work or in the house probably through as@@ be@@ sto@@ s contact in the environment &apos; .
a large proportion of these contacts , he says , are based on the &apos; normal use and ag@@ eing &apos; of our buildings .
it looks as if the european union is not going to be safe .
a report by go@@ d@@ d@@ ard consulting , a member of the palace of west min@@ ster , has been published on how people can be seen in the heart of the government , un@@ kno@@ w@@ ingly exposed to the substance .
in 2009 , go@@ d@@ d@@ ard reported that the service p@@ acks and robo@@ t lines behind the committee chairs were not working with as@@ be@@ sto@@ s .
members of parliament are often accused of being concerned about their own interests .
while the management of the parliamentary labour is insi@@ sting that the west min@@ ster palace should be a &apos; clean health certificate &apos; , the council and parliament have now been un@@ question@@ ably able .
the go@@ d@@ d@@ ard report pointed out that the eu has a duty to protect the existence of as@@ be@@ sto@@ s in accordance with the respective provisions .
no one can know whether this mis@@ management costs lives .
all you need to do now is to wait .
a person who has lost contact with as@@ be@@ sto@@ s could never be sure of gra@@ ham ab@@ bot@@ t , a general practi@@ tion@@ er .
as andre@@ w law@@ son suggests , the 5@@ 0-@@ year-@@ old ab@@ bot@@ t suggests that he was working in hospit@@ als to the as@@ be@@ sto@@ s .
&quot; i have a hospital in which i have to pay for as@@ be@@ sto@@ s complaints &quot; , says he , &quot; but i can &apos;t do it in my case .
it is so difficult to get used to all places where the people of europe have worked and where the data are .
what he has not yet re@@ mem@@ bered is the day at the beginning of december 2009 , when he was able to get a kind of fe@@ ver .
he was 45 , and he just went to the hospital late at night .
suddenly , i had sha@@ ken a little .
it was suddenly a matter of urgency .
i felt like a terrible person .
i thought that the trip to home was no longer possible .
as a doctor , ab@@ bot@@ t knew that the pain was from the bre@@ ast fur , the skin around its lun@@ gs .
but as jan@@ ice allen has done , he had no reason to be a mes@@ o@@ the@@ li@@ om .
he went to the office a month ago .
it is surprising that doctors made x-@@ ray pictures of his brother and his family and put pla@@ ur@@ a ka@@ the@@ ther to remove flu@@ id from the lun@@ gs .
his complaints remained un@@ answered , however .
its health improved , and the disease was rever@@ sed .
from time to time , the symp@@ t@@ oms returned , however , often after sporting re@@ activity .
in 2011 , a patient ab@@ bot@@ ts came to ab@@ bot@@ t with similar symp@@ t@@ oms in his practice and was later diagno@@ sed with mes@@ o@@ the@@ li@@ om .
but even now ab@@ bot@@ t combined this with his own case .
after all , his patient was a few decades older and had to deal directly with as@@ be@@ sto@@ s .
the connection in this case was clear .
in september 2011 , the down@@ turn in ab@@ bot@@ t ’ s condition was rever@@ sed and his doctor brought his c@@ t sc@@ ans and x-@@ ray pictures to an expert group .
in december 2011 , exactly two years after the ab@@ bot@@ t declared itself to be ill for the first time , the first person to be equipped with a camera was taken to the ca@@ ve between the ri@@ b and ch@@ est fur .
i am an optim@@ ist .
i am mostly concerned about the fact that &apos; he says .
frank@@ ly , i had not even thought so many of my concerns .
but rac@@ hel , ladies and gentlemen , was concerned .
the result of the bi@@ op@@ sy was in the week between christmas and new year : &quot; you said to me that it was mes@@ o@@ the@@ li@@ om . &quot;
gra@@ ham ab@@ bot@@ t : diagno@@ sis mes@@ o@@ the@@ li@@ om
suddenly , ab@@ bot@@ t had dates with ma@@ ke@@ -up and mac@@ mill@@ an nur@@ ses , some of whom had been recommended to him to take a law@@ yer .
only now did he understand the extent of the ep@@ ide@@ mic .
&quot; it turned out that the as@@ be@@ sto@@ s was very common , especially in large public buildings , where ros@@ é and pi@@ pes are often mixed with as@@ be@@ sto@@ s , &quot; he says .
people who are not ac@@ custom@@ ed to as@@ be@@ sto@@ s in these buildings are now suffering .
and so mes@@ o@@ the@@ li@@ om is now meeting younger people who are not in the typical profes@@ sions .
the most dangerous pi@@ pes with as@@ be@@ sto@@ s insul@@ ation in hospit@@ als were under the ground , so patients were likely to be more exposed to the substance .
but many employees who work in pede@@ stri@@ ans are not able to walk from one building to another ( like andre@@ w law@@ son ) or in underground buildings .
it is clear that over several decades of the war , hospit@@ als have been closed to patients for life@@ -@@ saving purposes , but life@@ -@@ threat@@ ening for the treatment of doctors .
it will continue to be removed today .
students presented their bun@@ ker bur@@ ners on as@@ be@@ sto@@ s mat@@ s .
and it does not just concern hospit@@ als .
as@@ be@@ sto@@ s was created by his fab@@ ulous insul@@ ating and fl@@ ame re@@ tar@@ dant properties in offices , shops , libraries and town h@@ alls .
schools too .
indeed , many people may have been able to get the first as@@ be@@ sto@@ s contact in the class@@ room .
throughout the country , in thousands of chem@@ i@@ stry hours , students have shown their tor@@ ch bur@@ ners on as@@ be@@ sto@@ s mat@@ s .
on websites , the theme of as@@ be@@ sto@@ s is now frequently raised in schools .
and meanwhile , so un@@ accoun@@ table items have no place in our houses , such as flo@@ oring or sc@@ aling po@@ les , as standard .
&quot; it is an industrial po@@ ison that is present in much of our properties , &quot; said the author .
in one case , the only contact that was open to a woman concerned was the abor@@ tion .
so please adjust to how you can make your garden sc@@ ales te@@ ar out .
the effects of the diagno@@ sis , and the knowledge that the disease is incur@@ able , is immen@@ se .
&quot; it takes a while to do that .
i went back to work and tried to go further .
i was in the region for two weeks .
then i knew that i would be going and i would take care of myself .
well , i will not add another christmas tree to the experience .
with the greatest difficulty , the perspective effect was changed from the position of a doctor to that of a patient .
how countless patients before him remin@@ ds him that he was over@@ weight .
&quot; it was very difficult to do all this , &quot; he says .
&quot; i asked my doctor &quot; how long i have not ? &quot;
and there was still something for me about 12 months .
i remember the time when i thought that the &apos; well yes , i will not be another christmas tree &apos; .
that was the case . &apos;
mes@@ o@@ the@@ li@@ om is particularly insi@@ di@@ ous because it is our life expec@@ t@@ ancy mechanism - bre@@ a@@ thing itself - that the fat@@ al cancer of which is caused .
most cases of mes@@ o@@ the@@ li@@ om@@ a are caused by as@@ be@@ sto@@ s contact .
as@@ be@@ sto@@ s consists of small fi@@ b@@ res .
if the as@@ be@@ sto@@ s is raised and the fi@@ b@@ res are in@@ hal@@ ed , they can be stored in the ch@@ est co@@ at , the skin around the lun@@ gs .
as@@ be@@ sto@@ s fi@@ bers ir@@ rit@@ ate the ch@@ est co@@ at and can cause cell mu@@ tations .
&quot; the problem ar@@ ises with the in@@ hal@@ ed nee@@ dle shaped and as@@ be@@ sto@@ s fi@@ b@@ res , &quot; says professor tom treas@@ ure .
that is exactly the hospital that andre@@ w la@@ v@@ son susp@@ ected to be in the hands of as@@ be@@ sto@@ s .
treas@@ ure hun@@ t was known as law@@ son and treated him to some other people who were probably also trained in hospital .
once as@@ be@@ sto@@ s nee@@ d@@ les have the p@@ ne@@ um@@ onia , tre@@ as@@ ure says &quot; they will be taken from the bre@@ a@@ thing to the edge of the bre@@ a@@ thing process .
by nature , it is important from the outset to inv@@ a@@ sively .
the usual options for other cancer patients are to work with br@@ ass and br@@ on@@ ze .
the effectiveness of an operation is , for example , highly controversial .
some say that they have made an attempt .
treas@@ ure hun@@ t is a form of crime .
&quot; you can &apos;t see the ch@@ est co@@ at , but you can tell it .
they come by measuring the k@@ ni@@ fe .
meanwhile , the kre@@ m@@ lin spe@@ aks of &apos; chem@@ other@@ ap@@ y &apos; not very well , &apos; the effect shows &apos; , but does not cure .
&quot; sometimes there are long-term over@@ flow problems , &quot; says tre@@ ad@@ ur@@ e .
but at the end they all die .
fortunately , some patients actually live long , much longer than expected .
the author ste@@ ph@@ en j@@ ay g@@ ould died 20 years after the diagno@@ sis .
two and a half years after his own diagno@@ sis , gra@@ ham ab@@ bot@@ t is still fighting .
after he was mes@@ o@@ the@@ li@@ om cont@@ acted , ab@@ bot@@ t came in contact with andre@@ w law@@ son , who was sent@@ enced to death four years after his diagno@@ sis .
&quot; hel@@ lo , cancer center , &quot; i put it at an@@ k@@ ama , &quot; he said .
&quot; he was very positive , &quot; says ab@@ bot@@ t .
he had his diagno@@ sis 4 years earlier and was still a very active one .
originally , ab@@ bot@@ t had six chem@@ other@@ ap@@ y cy@@ cles available .
&quot; i was desper@@ ate , &quot; says he .
i wanted to give up .
law@@ son created the first version of the game , which was released in the uk in may 2008 .
the commission has already taken a decision to make a study of the situation in the united states , following consultation with several doctors .
&quot; we had an advantage by not having to go further .
a normal patient is not going to receive a bank transfer and will be asked to approve the treatment .
money is crucial to mes@@ o@@ the@@ li@@ om suff@@ e@@ rers in order to find the best available therap@@ ies .
but if these treatments are finally inev@@ itable , they will not be available to many people affected by another financial concern - about the future of families , the future of which they leave .
and so you turn to the courts in the hope of compensation .
andre@@ w law@@ son cont@@ acted the debian project leader andre@@ w mor@@ gan for a detailed description of the debian project .
&quot; it has been a known name since 18@@ 98 that as@@ be@@ sto@@ s is extremely dangerous to health , &quot; says mor@@ gan .
but what has changed in the 19@@ 60 ’ s is that one recogn@@ iz@@ es that even a very small number of people are at risk of health .
and here the care@@ less@@ ness of companies began to play a role .
andre@@ w law@@ son and gu@@ y &apos;s are now in the process of putting their case , but it was not the case that mor@@ gan had called a &quot; full compensation &quot; .
the commission has , however , confirmed that the death penalty is not being applied to the united states .
that was a great surprise for andre@@ w law@@ son .
as as@@ be@@ sto@@ s can be removed , it is not possible to remove as@@ be@@ sto@@ s .
indeed , it is important for mes@@ o@@ the@@ li@@ om suff@@ e@@ rers who care about compensation to have an enormous problem , which is the dead@@ ly as@@ be@@ sto@@ s contact between a company or a job - usually decades after the inci@@ dents .
many of your former employers have been sold or closed .
insurance documents can be lost .
and those who are against claims are not the ones who know that time is too short for them , but certainly not with the pla@@ in@@ ti@@ ffs .
in response , there was a similar reaction this year .
the law has a legal framework that is supported by the insurance industry of 3@@ 50 million £ for all who are looking for a new diagno@@ sis after july 2012 .
in these cases , the pla@@ in@@ ti@@ ffs receive 80 % of what a court does in a normal compensation process .
about 300 successful applications for the programme will be submitted each year .
andre@@ w mor@@ gan thin@@ ks like so many mes@@ o@@ the@@ li@@ om suff@@ e@@ rers that 3@@ 50 million £ is a &quot; very good job &quot; of the insurance industry .
&quot; this is a deal of insu@@ rers for insurance companies who are saying &quot; i am sure that they will not be too big a sum .
mil@@ i@@ eu &apos;s report on the implementation of the directive on pension rights was also presented by mi@@ ke pen@@ ning , then labour and pension minister .
but both pension and mor@@ gan gave to the fact that , given seven deaths , the number of people suffering from hun@@ ger and disease is increasing every day .
&quot; people are so suffering and need help today , &quot; said pen@@ ning during the second hearing .
to this day , gra@@ ham ab@@ bot@@ t has been in the hands of prof@@ . lo@@ ic lan@@ g-@@ la@@ z@@ dun@@ ski .
after their initial consultation , the committee on legal affairs and the internal market recommended an operation that he could not dream of , unlike tom treas@@ ure .
this was confirmed by a radiation therapy and a chemical therapy .
ab@@ bot@@ t felt like a strong man .
&quot; this is of course the most important thing , &quot; says ab@@ bot@@ t .
this is always seen in patients .
there is something that i would like to make you move on .
if you are ti@@ red , it &apos;s a quick and bad thing .
gra@@ ham ab@@ bot@@ t signed up in march 20@@ 12 to operation .
at the end of august he had been the last of the six chem@@ other@@ ap@@ y cy@@ cles .
after@@ -@@ can@@ cer@@ -@@ the-@@ eye no evidence of the disease .
then i had the opportunity to visit a s@@ can in march 20@@ 14 .
there were several cancer cases in the area of my bre@@ ast .
i have just been 50 .
this is not life@@ -@@ threat@@ ening .
this is a life@@ -@@ long process .
again , the ab@@ bot@@ t signed six chem@@ other@@ ap@@ y cy@@ cles , and the first one was in the united states .
now is not a tr@@ ace of t@@ um@@ ors .
but the process is physi@@ cally and ment@@ ally un@@ pleasant .
you must think of practical things - about the money , if i do not go any further , for example , or show my wife how the bo@@ iler time setting works .
if you have bad news , you will be nega@@ tively affected .
you must look forward , mr president .
as the father of el@@ lie , 16 , and tam@@ si@@ n , 14 , he is not always easy .
&quot; for parents , this is difficult , &quot; he says .
it is hard to know what to say .
when i first started my diagno@@ sis , i said to my girls that i had a disease that would cause me not to be old .
they respon@@ ded very differently .
tam@@ si@@ n is very healthy and very popular .
they told me that they were not going to get a lot of an@@ no@@ tations .
el@@ lie was re@@ luc@@ t@@ ant .
she did not say much .
such talks are something that all the can@@ c@@ ers of the world must make through .
but for mes@@ o@@ the@@ li@@ o@@ graphy tr@@ ades , such talks are not driven by hope , not by a tr@@ ace of hope for survival .
the disease ( as it did in the end for ste@@ ph@@ en jack@@ son ) causes a great deal of damage to the health .
as andre@@ w mor@@ gan says , &quot; mes@@ o@@ the@@ li@@ om is not life@@ -@@ threat@@ ening .
body in@@ sol@@ es are used to treat the skin of the skin .

china is ref@@ using hong kong the right to a government election , demonstr@@ ators swe@@ ar in re@@ tali@@ ation , and the chinese government is bl@@ aming re@@ tali@@ ation for re@@ tali@@ ation , and the chinese government for re@@ tali@@ ation .
on sunday , the chinese parliament decided , despite the increased calls for democratic reforms , to vote against the nom@@ ination of candidates for the 20@@ 17 elections by hong kong &apos;s elec@@ tor@@ ate .
this approach fu@@ el@@ ed the long-@@ announced debate on the future of hong kong .
the decision of the chinese people ’ s congress allows the communist leaders to continue to ignore all non-@@ pe@@ king@@ -@@ loy@@ al candidates .
&quot; this is not un@@ expected , but it makes us an@@ gr@@ y , &quot; said right-@@ wing expert em@@ ily lam@@ u , chairman of the democratic party .
this is not what we want to see in beijing .
we have asked the people of hong kong to be comm@@ ended .
and it is clear that we are dealing with an author@@ itarian regime that is not in the same position .
in his defence of china ’ s decision , li fe@@ i , vice secretary general of the standing committee of the national people ’ s congress , said that approval of public nom@@ inations in the hong kong government elections was a cha@@ otic exercise .
since 1997 , when britain was in control of hong kong , china has been a major contribu@@ tor to china ’ s economy , with the inhabitants losing control of hong kong from 20@@ 17 .
the chinese leadership presented the decision of sunday as a democratic break@@ through , because it was clear to hong kong &apos;s citizens that there should be a direct election , but the decision also makes it clear that the chinese leadership has to follow the process through a closely mini@@ ster@@ ial of beijing .
after a new clause , only candidates who have a love for the country and love for hong kong will be allowed to be ad@@ mitted .
the decision follows a summer in which some of the largest and most public@@ -@@ impact projects are being held in hong kong for several years .
behind the pro@@ democratic campaign in hong kong , the movement oc@@ cul@@ p@@ y central with love is standing .
on sunday evening , we had a few hours after the meeting of the european parliament , with hundreds of people from the occup@@ ying forces , who were in the rain , in front of the headquarters in hong kong .
in the demonstration , the organiz@@ ers said that their movement had a new stage of civil dis@@ o@@ be@@ di@@ ence .
they made it impossible to do so , however , apparently to deal with problems with the authorities .
in an online communication , the organiz@@ ers told that the conference was going to &quot; promote the appointment of the central district as a last resort &quot; .
i am sorry , say , but i am not sure that all the opportunities for dialogue are being explo@@ ited today and that the occupation of the central district will definitely take place .
the authorities in hong kong have been working hard for days on the beijing announcement .
the ri@@ ots will be tri@@ g@@ ge@@ red by the feeling of many in hong kong that they are slowly losing control of their city .
the train from people to main@@ land increases the competition for products and services .
moreover , fear of being forced to accept hong kong &apos;s values such as democracy and freedom of speech is growing under the growing pressure of beijing .
some cri@@ tici@@ zed the demonstra@@ tions by the occup@@ y centr@@ al-@@ movement , as they did not stop business operations - the li@@ fel@@ ine of hong kong - and they did so .
&quot; the pro@@ tests that we heard about are likely to have a great economic impact , depending on how many people are involved and how long they are going to continue , &quot; said legal expert re@@ gin@@ e is@@ p , who has the movement for a long time .
we do not want to raise fears that hong kong will be out of control .
this impression is bad for investment .
the state@@ -@@ controlled media of china reported that the chinese government has recently reported on the pro-@@ democracy activi@@ sts in hong kong as being threatened by western powers .
in this summer , activi@@ sts organised an un@@ official referendum on the constitution ’ s electoral rights , in which 7@@ 8@@ 0,000 people participated - more than a fifth of the elec@@ tor@@ ate in hong kong .
in july , tens of thousands participated in one of the largest democratic demonstra@@ tions in the region ’ s history .
the tradition of school leaving b@@ alls in the us is now being extended to universities , where fre@@ h@@ men are performing on the same private plane .
we are pleased to have this demand .
to make a particularly impressive appearance at the university , the first conference room was opened in the year 2000 .
mr ste@@ w@@ art also said that the service is a security feature of the system .
this service is an ideal alternative for students who would otherwise like to study their hab@@ its in a danger@@ ously over@@ loaded car through the country .
together with our new vi@@ f options we are looking forward to working with you this year to ensure that the students can get to know the university with a minimum of effort and a maximum of luxury .
a company specific is a person who said that no new accounting rules have been introduced , as the service is only just introduced .
the company informed the company that the company had not yet received any of the schol@@ ar@@ ships , despite the fees for study .
students today are different in their expectations and demands .
the national student card is a cri@@ tic of the service as being removed .
me@@ gan dun@@ n , vice-president of the n@@ us for higher education , said : &quot; this offer seems to be completely separate from the lives of the majority of students .
many students who have been working with the university this month are facing a crisis of living costs .
fem@@ in@@ ist cri@@ tici@@ ze r@@ aci@@ al issues and police behaviour after fer@@ g@@ us@@ on
the un@@ armed te@@ en@@ ager is now in a position to take the te@@ en@@ ager to the streets of the city .
participants raised their hands in the air and san@@ g , &quot; hands high , not sli@@ ding , &quot; while they were before the fun@@ eral .
after two weeks of pro@@ tests in dist@@ ant gal@@ ici@@ a , mo , due to the sho@@ oting of the un@@ armed te@@ en@@ ager michael brown , i noticed that the blo@@ gger was mi@@ ri@@ am z@@ il@@ a per@@ e@@ z re@@ alizing a change in the content .
after their experience , white fem@@ ini@@ sts continue to rely on gender .
while ten@@ sions in the middle west have increased and the country has grown , the us has seen pe@@ re@@ z respond by white women as a 100 % increase in the rate of r@@ aci@@ al re@@ stra@@ int .
compared to the answers black and white women shortly after the sho@@ ts of 9 august , the personal es@@ says with tips and tr@@ ic@@ ks like &quot; thoughts to fer@@ g@@ us@@ on came from a white woman &quot; and &quot; fem@@ in@@ ism is not only about the woman .
but for pe@@ re@@ z , this was an important change .
&quot; i do not think that you can be a woman in fem@@ in@@ ism who has no knowledge of the white and has privile@@ ges on such a high standard , &quot; she said .
people feel that they have been pus@@ hed to do something about the inci@@ dents .
it is characteristic of the crisis that we are experiencing .
for eng@@ lish@@ -@@ speaking professor k@@ ori@@ th@@ a mit@@ ch@@ ell from the o@@ hi@@ o state university , the fer@@ g@@ us@@ on has raised problems that black people have been exposed to every day , which are not considered to be women &apos;s issues .
&quot; i can do something fun@@ ny on fac@@ e@@ book about me and my partner and i get 150 li@@ kes of everywhere .
if i had something to say about how col@@ oured in your own country under sie@@ ge , i would say that silence is a matter of an@@ gu@@ ish .
&quot; how can it be safe for women to speak publicly about a relationship that is not about security in the public space ? &quot; asked her .
for black women like mit@@ ch@@ ell , who have been bre@@ ed , sex and sex@@ u@@ ality in the history of the usa , there is no den@@ sity limit .
for you , black women do not have the luxury to be the themes clean .
while white women are now discussing the themes of race and gender in fem@@ in@@ ist main@@ stre@@ aming , the fem@@ in@@ ist ang@@ ela h@@ att@@ ery says that professor m@@ ü@@ ller and g@@ end@@ er-@@ research at geor@@ ge mac@@ on university .
&quot; between 18@@ 65 and 18@@ 90 , at least 10@@ ,000 black men were yellow and black , and the justi@@ fication was almost always the ra@@ pe of a white woman , &quot; said hat@@ ter@@ y .
white women had to be involved in history , to make the ly@@ n@@ ch@@ k@@ ar murder justi@@ fiable .
for hat@@ ter@@ y , the division between white and black women came at the point where the white men fought for freedom .
&quot; they met the decision to be in favour of the right to vote for women , and the right to vote for black should come later , &quot; said hat@@ ter@@ y .
if you remember such things , you will see that the european union is not a community of colour@@ ful women .
we have our job not done well .
we have never seen black women helping to protect their hus@@ bands and s@@ ons .
even after women were forced to vote in 19@@ 20 , the majority of the population still took a decade to get a job out of the ly@@ n@@ ch in the association of so@@ vie@@ ts .
the group was formed almost 40 years after the original request for assistance from black women , says mit@@ ch@@ ell .
for mit@@ ch@@ ell , the flo@@ od of white fem@@ in@@ ist re@@ actions to the problems caused by fer@@ g@@ us@@ on is , in fact , a matter of police behaviour and r@@ aci@@ al discrimination .
&quot; would it not be great if the acti@@ vis@@ t , who has such traditional fem@@ ini@@ sts platforms , were to have the right to education of a child so seriously ?
fem@@ in@@ ist of the second generation who have lost their career in the struggle for re@@ productive rights and access to contrac@@ ep@@ tion .
the famous white fea@@ ther is a popular acti@@ vis@@ t gl@@ oria ste@@ iner who went to the hospital two weeks after the sho@@ oting of michael brown .
&quot; i hope that women who have a different , but parallel , relationship will be able to find a way to help the body .
although ste@@ iner is known for a rather inter@@ sec@@ tional fem@@ in@@ ism in which rapid and r@@ aci@@ al fem@@ in@@ ism is addressed , the most important issues are the gender .
christ@@ ina som@@ mer , research resear@@ cher at the american enterprise institute and austrian author , has published a book about the history of the company .
there is now hundreds of special programs for girls and young women , but almost nothing for bo@@ ys .
but when the white house recently opened a small program , my brother &apos;s home , i was told that it was not vulnerable .
the relationship between the police and the black community is not the only problem that the police have to take priority over the main@@ stream fem@@ in@@ ism .
after the us border police had arrested almost 6@@ 3@@ ,000 un@@ accompanied min@@ ors at the sou@@ th@@ west border of the country this year , the us border police issue is also on the agenda .
andre@@ a mer@@ c@@ ado , co-@@ chairman of we bel@@ ong tool@@ kit , has been an organization that has made women responsible for immigration reform .
&quot; these speak for themselves , &quot; said mer@@ c@@ ado .

but the attr@@ action of the event was strong enough to make a big decision yesterday about 1000 visitors .
there was a colour@@ ful ri@@ dge of representa@@ tions , performances , games , exhi@@ bits , and other information about the time of the roman@@ s and their importance for the rhe@@ in@@ land .
the main attr@@ action of the day was undoubtedly the mar@@ ti@@ lian fighting force , which was built by the gla@@ di@@ at@@ ore school &quot; am@@ or mor@@ tis &quot; , which was the starting point for every ra@@ iny day to be filled with soft sand .
gla@@ di@@ at@@ o@@ ren@@ e owner &quot; leon@@ id@@ as &quot; proved to be a hum@@ or@@ ous and kno@@ wled@@ ge@@ able pres@@ enter and sent em@@ ail@@ s to his men in the ring one after the other to perform her@@ o@@ ic tw@@ ili@@ ght .

the most impressive was the performance of the &quot; re@@ ti@@ ari@@ us &quot; , which was played with a thro@@ wing net , tri@@ an@@ ch@@ or and dol@@ ch against the &quot; sec@@ u@@ ator &quot; and after a short fight to the ground .
as the people of the city cl@@ amp with metal , they are made of sh@@ ep@@ per@@ ts and the sa@@ usage .
but the commission had respon@@ ded to the imposing &quot; sum@@ ma ru@@ d@@ is &quot; , the mus@@ cu@@ lar sho@@ oting re@@ fe@@ ree , an always atten@@ tive eye .

finally , the roman@@ s have not only fought war and con@@ quest in our region , but also the roman culture and numerous buildings , which we still have to adm@@ ire today .
remains of this were also found in the roman days .
the fron@@ tin@@ us company presented the water and energy supply to the former and now , and managing director pe@@ tra fr@@ ic@@ ke knew that the water supply would be lost today .
this is confirmed by diplom@@ a survey engine@@ er r@@ alp@@ h he@@ ili@@ ger from the &quot; engineering team two &quot; from rhe@@ in@@ bach , who was surve@@ ying instruments for the roman catho@@ lic church .

the building probably has a villa ru@@ sty , but a farm house , which is not a hotel , explained the archae@@ o@@ log@@ ist dr. j@@ enni@@ fer mor@@ sch@@ ei@@ ser .
a number of fun@@ eral pieces from these exhi@@ bits are the main focus of the exhibition .
the villa probably had a very good location from the first to the fourth century , until the first time the ger@@ man@@ s arrived in the roman rh@@ ine .
it is a member of the european union , and it is the largest association of the world &apos;s largest wind energy network .

e@@ bol@@ a : the ep@@ ide@@ mic is bur@@ den@@ ing west africa ’ s economy with its economy , and the economy is bur@@ den@@ ing it with a heavy burden on west africa ’ s economy .
the e@@ bol@@ a ep@@ ide@@ mic in west africa is also a serious b@@ low to the economy .
markets are or@@ ph@@ an@@ ed - and international companies are moving away .
the dev@@ ast@@ ating e@@ bol@@ a ep@@ ide@@ mic has enabled the economy of west africa to face a severe b@@ low .
the har@@ v@@ est is ro@@ ta@@ ted on the fields that min@@ ers are leaving and the markets are or@@ ph@@ an@@ ed - the virus has hit the region hard .
some international companies are already on a distance .
&quot; the e@@ bol@@ a ep@@ ide@@ mic is not only a medical crisis , but also an economic one &quot; , jud@@ ges the head of the african development bank , don@@ ald k@@ ab@@ er@@ u@@ ka .
liber@@ ia is the hard@@ est hit .
&quot; it is a total disaster , we lose very much money &quot; , says al@@ ham@@ br@@ a , the president of the united states .
on the market , only who can buy food or something for dis@@ inf@@ ection against e@@ bol@@ a will be able to buy .
liber@@ ia is the hard@@ est hit by the virus , but it is the most vulnerable of all .
recently , the health authorities said that the disease was in every corner of the country .
in gu@@ in@@ ea@@ -@@ sier@@ ra le@@ one and ni@@ geria , too , the virus has spread .
in total , more than 15@@ 00 people died , thousands more were in their inf@@ ancy .
foreign companies are recru@@ iting employees from abroad .
across the resource centers , the us and other countries , firms are setting up their business .
foreign companies such as the steel company ar@@ cel@@ or mit@@ tal are with@@ drawing their employees , several international airlines are flying the affected regions no longer .
the local people also have a re@@ active attitude : few merchan@@ ts are still leaving their homes .
in some areas in sier@@ ra le@@ one and liber@@ ia , which are suffering from quar@@ ant@@ ine , the situation is getting worse , for example , for export .
farmers d@@ are not to pay for the har@@ v@@ est their homes .
food is scar@@ ce and it is scar@@ ce .
&quot; people will always be less travelling , &quot; says phil@@ li@@ pe de v@@ re@@ yer , paris expert , for the economy of west africa .
the man , for example , who is usually on the market and his vegetables are sold , is better off at home .
the population therefore receives the consequences of the ep@@ ide@@ mic directly and urgently .
on the markets , the market is di@@ min@@ ishing in basic food@@ stuffs such as rice .
at the same time , the highly dependent international region is threat@@ ening to damage the image - with far-@@ reaching consequences .
the greatest danger is that international firms will lose the area over a long period of time , phili@@ ppe hu@@ g@@ on says of french think tan@@ k i@@ ri@@ us .
it is crucial to know how far and how long the virus will spread .
investors may also have the impression that &quot; it is dangerous to invest in gu@@ ine@@ a , sier@@ ra le@@ one and liber@@ ia &quot; .
the disease is also bur@@ den@@ some to the str@@ ingent national budgets of the member states .
the disease is also bur@@ den@@ some for the already har@@ sh national budgets of the countries concerned .
the credit rating agencies are not responsible for the quality of the credit rat@@ ings they provide .
the african development bank is promising to help the health systems of the countries concerned with 60 million dollars ( 45 million euros ) .
the effects of the crisis are already evident in ni@@ geria , where only a few e@@ bol@@ a cases have been diagno@@ sed .
although the oil rich region in southern ni@@ ger is a region that has not been affected so far .
but elsewhere , the problems are still many , for fear of inf@@ ection .
reservations can also be made in hotels .

the pat@@ ron@@ age has been the may@@ or of wol@@ f@@ gan@@ g wild and secretary of state al@@ bert fü@@ r@@ ack@@ er .
the original name &quot; protec@@ tor company &quot; ( t@@ ann@@ en@@ wal@@ d bern@@ ga@@ u ) dates back to 19@@ 07 when the first german association was founded on march 21 , 19@@ 07 .
the n@@ s-@@ regime had a monopo@@ ly on the dis@@ solution of the association in 19@@ 37 .

after a work of 2@@ 700 hours , the company issued a certificate of mer@@ it on 8 may 198@@ 8 for the new students of the town hall .
one of the major highlights of the association is the fact that the 4@@ 4th ga@@ us@@ s@@ sch@@ uss , together with the sole@@ m@@ n pa@@ st@@ ure of the new sho@@ ot@@ ing-@@ flag in july 1991 .
on 23 and 24 april 1994 , the sho@@ o@@ ter association published its 30@@ -@@ year founding anniversary .
in 1995 , a b@@ ö@@ ll@@ er@@ group was established .
jo@@ se@@ f sch@@ mal@@ z@@ l was born in b@@ ö@@ ll@@ er@@ re@@ cher@@ re@@ ch@@ t@@ rent .
a major challenge for the &quot; b@@ ö@@ ll@@ ers &quot; and for the club as a whole was the align@@ ment of the bav@@ arian b@@ ö@@ ll@@ er@@ tre@@ ff@@ en 2005 .
in many hours volunte@@ er work , the association &apos;s members have made a significant contribution to the spaces and the sho@@ oting facilities in the bern@@ gau@@ er hof and thus to the latest state of the art .

nato wants to conclude agreements with russia without breaking agreements .
nato will be strengthened by the planned dep@@ loy@@ ment of troops in eastern europe following the ukra@@ inian crisis .
nato secre@@ tar@@ y-@@ general and@@ ers fo@@ gh r@@ as@@ mus@@ sen said on monday in brussels that nato is keeping to the founding agreement of the nato russia alliance .
the nato chief , mr president , accused the russian &quot; one ti@@ e of a brut@@ al breach &quot; of the agreement .
&quot; today we must face reality , &quot; said the president of nato , who is not a partner , &quot; said r@@ as@@ mus@@ sen .
documents and statements by the russian federation have shown that the russian authorities are not going to treat us as an oppon@@ ent .
stronger nato presence
r@@ as@@ mus@@ sen also announced that the nas@@ cent nato presence in eastern europe will be strengthened .
a registered member of the nato summit in wal@@ es will be able to take part in the &quot; read@@ iness action plan &quot; to ensure that &quot; we have more visible nato presence in the east as long as this is necessary &quot; , said r@@ as@@ mus@@ sen on monday .
ki@@ e@@ v and moscow are some of the world ’ s leading gas talks , but they are not .
russia and ukraine have agreed to official information on new talks on the settlement of their gas dispute .
the negotiations are scheduled for next saturday , said the russian energy minister alexander lu@@ kas@@ hen@@ ko on monday .
it will be a decision of the european union .
because of the dispute over the gas price , the ukraine has been receiving no fuel for weeks now from russia .
the most recent issue of the eu &apos;s energy commissioner , g@@ ün@@ ther o@@ et@@ t@@ inger , was that of both sides .
ukraine had hoped that the country would be able to use gas for europe as well .
europe is ear@@ ning around a third of its gas from russian sources , a large proportion of which is flow@@ ing through ukraine .
mer@@ kel spe@@ aks power@@ ful@@ ness : tol@@ l is &quot; clearly &quot; coming .
now , the commission is committed to making a clear commitment to this .
a licence to use all complex and complex details is , however , not .
har@@ t@@ wi@@ g concerns about the c@@ du against the p@@ k@@ w tol@@ l have made c@@ su the most e@@ ye@@ -@@ cat@@ ching .
chancell@@ or mer@@ kel has already said that the eu has a duty to take action in the face of persi@@ stent opposition from her c@@ du .
&quot; to be quite clear , the commission is in the coalition agreement , which is to be concluded , &quot; said the party leader , &quot; the president of the commission , on monday after meetings of the c@@ du top bodies in berlin .
a detailed picture of the model was taken by mer@@ kel , however .
in the black and red government programme , &apos; certain parameters &apos; are mentioned .
the federal minister of transport , alexander do@@ br@@ in@@ dt ( c@@ su ) , has made a proposal , and this is now being worked on .
the n@@ r@@ w-@@ c@@ du insi@@ sts , however , on their no to tol@@ l immediately on all roads .
mer@@ kel stressed that the financial minister , wol@@ f@@ gan@@ g sch@@ ä@@ u@@ ble ( c@@ du ) , too , is construc@@ tively engaged in the deliber@@ ations on a draft law .
the issue of the report has also been discussed with do@@ br@@ in@@ dt on other ways of increasing private capital to invest in infrastructure , such as in broad@@ band .
&quot; there is nothing special about it , &quot; sch@@ ä@@ u@@ ble had a great &quot; mirror on sunday .
c@@ su@@ -@@ ch@@ ef hor@@ st see@@ ho@@ fer war@@ ned dar@@ u@@ f@@ ner that in the cab@@ in@@ et tol@@ l concepts against the lead minister would be developed .
c@@ du@@ -@@ bun@@ des@@ vi@@ ze arm@@ in las@@ ch@@ et re@@ affir@@ med his objec@@ tions .
&quot; the coalition partner agreement went beyond the idea that all cir@@ cles and federal roads would be built . &quot;
in this respect , it is an important signal that see@@ ho@@ fer has now announced that he will be speaking again about the subject .
opposition to the plans is also expressed by the c@@ du national associations .
the background to these concerns is that tol@@ ls will not affect small border traffic to neighbouring countries .
see@@ hotel see@@ ho@@ fer had no problem with the tol@@ l criticism from ran@@ ks of the c@@ du coalition .
the left sees the plans as a step forward in the face of the union &apos;s dispute .
&quot; the mur@@ k@@ s-@@ tol@@ l is dead &quot; , said party leader , ber@@ nd ri@@ e@@ x@@ inger , the &quot; new os@@ n@@ ab@@ r@@ ü@@ ck@@ er ze@@ it@@ ung &quot; ( monday ) .
&quot; with the tol@@ l , the minister fails . &quot; do@@ br@@ in@@ dt wants to build a vig@@ net@@ te obligation on all german roads , which will start in 20@@ 16 .
domestic and international car owners may not , according to the coalition agreement , be charged with additional costs .
therefore , they should be able to use the vehicle tax to compens@@ ate fully for the tol@@ ls .

kar@@ in ro@@ d@@ gers lived almost their entire youth in the belief that he was only a few years away from his home .
she suffered in fact from the char@@ co@@ t mari@@ e-@@ to@@ oth disease ( c@@ mt ) - one group of in@@ h@@ eri@@ ted dis@@ orders that affected ner@@ ves outside the brain and body .
char@@ ity care c@@ mt uk announced that the new version of the c@@ mt + + + system is a common problem for people with c@@ mt , because so little is known about this disease .
about 23@@ ,000 people in britain are likely to suffer from c@@ mt , which can cause motor dis@@ orders such as mus@@ cle weak@@ ness , un@@ safe gear , and cr@@ um@@ bling to@@ es .

the mother of two children who are now 51 years old , said : &apos; when a child was a child , i knew i was not doing the same thing as the others .
i fell constantly and i was still taking my bre@@ ath .
i have never been able to play roll@@ sho@@ e or sk@@ ate@@ board with other children and was often forced to do so in school because of my way to go and walk .
ro@@ d@@ gers said that they were at the age of 13 , after several operations to reli@@ eve their ach@@ ill@@ es he@@ als and stress , and that they were not going to stop their medical acts when their doctor left the room and read what they were doing .
&quot; i felt like guil@@ ty , because i was cur@@ ious and i was not interested in what i said .

tax burden on business people in the washington area is increasing with the economic recovery .
a recovery in the economy means more customers , more sales and new jobs .
it also means higher taxes .
state and local tax authorities are responsible for the tax revenue of companies in the country last year , while the economic recovery has acceler@@ ated , thus creating a new study in the last week , and companies in the area of washington formed no exception .
companies in the district , mar@@ y@@ land and vir@@ g@@ ini@@ a paid together 2@@ 7.@@ 6 billion euros .
the government and local tax burden of companies increased by more than eur 4.@@ 5 billion last year to 6@@ 71 billion .
government taxes increased more than the local taxes .
more than half of the tax revenue of the district , 56 % , comes from corporate taxes , while 36 % of the revenues go to mar@@ y@@ land .
vir@@ g@@ ini@@ a achiev@@ es the lowest operating costs at 28 percent .
a large part of the increase in tax revenue is due to a recovery in real estate values for companies , say the researchers say , what to increase the tax revenue .
while a large part of these profits are generated from large states such as california , new york , and tex@@ as , the process seems to be very complicated for washington as well .
companies in the district , mar@@ y@@ land and vir@@ g@@ ini@@ a paid together over $ 10 billion in government and local real estate taxes last year , in comparison to $ 9.@@ 6 billion in 20@@ 12 - a rise in the course of a year by 4.@@ 2 % .
but the apparent recovery in the housing values is not in mar@@ y@@ land as effective as in increasing the government and local investment .
companies in vir@@ g@@ ini@@ a and d.@@ c. pay almost half of their public and local taxes in the form of property taxes .
&quot; in mar@@ y@@ land , the following is happening : a large part of the real estate , especially in the tax area around the d.@@ c. , is in the hands of government or non-@@ profit organizations that do not pay real-@@ estate taxes , &quot; said dou@@ gl@@ as managing director dou@@ gl@@ as lin@@ d@@ holm .
mar@@ y@@ land is therefore forced to take a much more interest in the income tax , for example , in order to provide the same services that other states offer .
the recent recovery in tax revenue from companies can no longer be attribu@@ ted solely to the recovery of the property market .
corporate income seems to be also reco@@ vering , so the data .
companies in the region reported that the income tax on the state organizations was $ 3@@ 50 million , and that the government had to pay $ 2.@@ 1 billion in 2012 .
mar@@ y@@ land took 1 billion $ in corporate income , and the company ’ s highest amount of revenue .
during the trend in the same direction , the number of local inhabitants increases .
the rise rates in the district of new york were the highest in the world , at 4.@@ 3 % , while the increase in mar@@ y@@ land was significantly higher , 4.@@ 9 % .
only vir@@ g@@ ini@@ a reported a lower average tax rate of € 4@@ ,@@ 1 per cent .
vir@@ g@@ ini@@ a has a 6 % stake in all three areas of office , which is significantly lower in the group ’ s three divi@@ sions ( there are fixed corporate tax rates in all three ) .
the company tax rate in mar@@ y@@ land is 8.@@ 7 % , and in the district it is 4.@@ 8 % .
a similar study by the us chamber of commerce at the beginning of this year showed that in vir@@ g@@ ini@@ a , lower state and local corporate taxes are required and a better overall tax climate prevail@@ s than in mar@@ y@@ land .
in the study , the district was not investig@@ ated .
despite the advantages , vir@@ g@@ ini@@ a is under pressure from its southern neighb@@ our .
north car@@ ol@@ ina is the country with laws to reduce its tax rates in the past year from 6.@@ 9 % to 6 % , the same rate as vir@@ g@@ ini@@ a , and the rate is expected to fall to 5 % next year .
if the state continues to increase its income targets next year , it could be a good way of reducing corporate tax rates .
in the meantime , it seems that small businesses in the washington area are better off , and they are therefore paying more government and local taxes , so the recent study shows .
corporate taxes , which are per@@ ceived as personal income taxes by small business@@ men - a transitional structure that allows for the most small businesses to be organised - in the district , mar@@ y@@ land and vir@@ g@@ ini@@ a rose by more than 20 % last year .
the researchers say that the price trend is increasing and the increase in corporate taxes is increasing throughout the country probably this year .
however , the washington area could be lag@@ ging behind if the prospects for reducing spending on research by the federal government were to focus on the labour market in the region .
partner city : german bi@@ er for gu@@ ang@@ z@@ ho@@ u and gu@@ ang@@ z@@ ho@@ u .
ho@@ ps and mal@@ t - also in china a popular combination .
german bi@@ er enjoys a very good reputation in china .
frankfurt ’ s partner city in china now wants a bre@@ w@@ ery and also hopes to have an air direct connection between the two cities .
german bi@@ er , used in the frankfurt book fair partner city gu@@ ang@@ z@@ ho@@ u - so the german beer is a strong desire of the official visitors .
&quot; we would be very pleased if a german bre@@ w@@ ery could prove to be established in our city , &quot; said the vice-president of the german association of the south china metro@@ polis , li yi@@ we@@ i , in this week &apos;s visit to a sp@@ d delegation .
time and again , the func@@ tion@@ alist of the ruling communist party of china has been accused of having mis@@ led the twelve million people in this case .
gu@@ ang@@ z@@ ho@@ u , the country &apos;s largest city , is home to the largest city in the world .
therefore , the member states have the purchasing power to adapt more quickly to german beer .
the h@@ ess@@ en sp@@ d chairman thor@@ ste@@ n sch@@ ä@@ fer g@@ ü@@ m@@ bel , who is the german political delegation , said to the host that the host was going to be in germany after a possible partner for the project .
&quot; for beer , it does not take much : good water , gra@@ in and joy &quot; , he added .
this joy of life is already expressed by mr li , fl@@ at@@ tering him out of the host .
the commission then met with a request from the gu@@ an@@ gh@@ er@@ i office to investigate the situation of the gu@@ ang@@ z@@ ho@@ u government , but with red wine , which was served for the meal .
the chinese t@@ sin@@ gh@@ ta@@ o brand is based on german bre@@ wing art .
t@@ sing@@ ta@@ o-@@ bi@@ er is produced according to the german pur@@ ity law .
more business
a second wish of chinese hosts would be to have direct flights between frankfurt and gu@@ ang@@ z@@ ho@@ u .
the lu@@ f@@ than@@ sa had used to offer the flight earlier , but in 2012 , for economic reasons .
&quot; it would be lo@@ ving again , &quot; he said , &quot; the local politici@@ an was convinced .
&quot; the business traffic between our two cities is increasing . &quot;
at present , travellers would have to take the di@@ version via chan@@ g@@ sh@@ a in the province of hun@@ an , li compla@@ ined .
the administration of the province of gu@@ ang@@ d@@ ong , whose capital is gu@@ ang@@ z@@ ho@@ u , also hopes to be able to reach the air .
the vice-president go@@ d@@ d@@ ess , the province , chen y@@ un@@ xi@@ an , asked this wish to be expressed in his con@@ vers@@ ation with the social democrats .
&quot; this is a very good idea &quot; , he rep@@ lied , &quot; i am a great fan of the chinese depu@@ ty minister , li j@@ in@@ ju@@ n , a german in@@ timate con@@ no@@ iss@@ eur .
well-@@ t@@ ended partnership with the local market and the local market .
the li@@ eu@@ ten@@ ant vice party leader , mr gu@@ an@@ gh@@ er@@ ita , hopes that the next elections will be held in frankfurt next year .
li yi@@ we@@ i was a member of the main team , but not yet in this position .
he came only this year to take office after his pre@@ dec@@ essor had been arrested for corruption .
the local market in the region , wan q@@ ing@@ lian , had to go .
the action taken against the officials of gu@@ ang@@ z@@ ho@@ u is part of a nation@@ wide campaign against corruption in the party and administration , which is being conducted by head of state x@@ i j@@ in@@ ping with ri@@ g@@ our .
the new leader li y@@ id@@ dish is now in a position to win the election for an american company before he takes up his party career , which is highly unusual in china ’ s communist party .
before taking office , he was the first to speak in a foreign affairs committee .
frankfurt is officially more than a do@@ zen urban areas .
the connection to the 9@@ 000 kilometres away gu@@ an@@ gl@@ er is a very popular destination for those who want to be kept on both sides , for example with a school exchange .

amazing video poker is a game for $ 1.@@ 04 billion , and is a great game for $ 1.@@ 04 billion .
amazing video confirmed the first time that the information was available on monday morning : the online retail channel - and video producer - was online and a lot of other things - bought the video stre@@ aming service t@@ wit@@ ch for 1.@@ 0@@ 4 billion $ ( $ 1.@@ 04 billion ) .
the announcement comes surpris@@ ingly , not because no one wants to take over t@@ wit@@ ch , but because female researchers widely susp@@ ect that the t@@ wit@@ ch is the company to buy .
three months ago , it looked as if the council had banned the sale of t@@ wit@@ ch to the google video service for a cool billion .
t@@ wit@@ ch , which was only three years ago known as ju@@ st@@ in@@ .@@ tv , was known as a general stre@@ aming service .
instead , it quickly became a platform for players who want to improve their bra@@ v@@ ou@@ ch in games , a &quot; you@@ tube game &quot; for live games , and thus a more in@@ sid@@ er .
the t@@ wit@@ ch interface .
and &apos; let &apos;s play the game &apos; , a video gen@@ re that shows better results than the original ( mostly older ) game .
it is just as if yo@@ ta y@@ out@@ u@@ be is often called when you use t@@ wit@@ ch .
it is a myster@@ y that the council of ministers has decided to deal with you@@ tube .
all you need to do at the moment is to make that statement by em@@ ma she@@ ar , president of t@@ wit@@ ch : &apos; we have not chosen am@@ az@@ on .
another myster@@ y is that , frank@@ ly , the incredible success of t@@ wit@@ ch .
for snow@@ boar@@ ders like me who explain that they prefer sport , rather than watching , the fact that they are not so attractive is hard to understand .
it is one thing to tell a friend at 3 a.m. about the school &apos;s shoul@@ der , while they are walking through resid@@ ent evi@@ l .
all these games could be you just watch .
another problem is that the commission has not yet fully implemented many of the most popular games , so it can be seen without its own control over the perspective .
i admit that the commission is not very well informed about the speed of the rapid transit system in which the ro@@ ger ban@@ n@@ ister of our age of electronics has completed their games in record time .
but until such time as a game or hum@@ or@@ virtu@@ os@@ ity is involved , his t@@ wit@@ ch channel is probably not as interesting .
but what do ske@@ p@@ tics like me know about it ?
t@@ wit@@ ch is supported by 55 million different visitors per month and is the fourth largest online resource of visitors to the world .
and how exactly will amaz@@ on learn money from it ?
it is difficult to imagine how the european union could be so elegant as to be in amaz@@ on inst@@ ant video .
but t@@ wit@@ ch has something that every company li@@ kes : thousands of young men , who are used as advertising customers , are .
as the chairman of t@@ wit@@ ch , she@@ ar , said , amaz@@ on has a lot to offer , and t@@ wit@@ ch says , &quot; both believe in the future of gaming , &quot; and the medium does not show any signs of shr@@ in@@ king , yet .
on the hill of the castle of bur@@ g@@ gar@@ ten@@ fest was some lot on saturday .
the concept of the organiz@@ ers was agreed .
despite the strong rain , the sun sh@@ ines on saturday evening , an estimated 6@@ ,@@ 200 music fans came to the open air festival in bur@@ gun@@ dy .
at times , the entrance had to be stopped .
&quot; this was an@@ no@@ ying , &quot; said ron sm@@ m , one of the organiz@@ ers .
sal@@ z@@ we@@ del l lic@@ ht und fun .
for two spanish words , ma@@ x@@ im s@@ ach@@ ra@@ j and ron s@@ em have the name am@@ ula .
this is because the open air in the sal@@ z@@ we@@ del@@ er bur@@ g@@ gar@@ ten is supposed to be bri@@ ght@@ ness in the day and evening through various shows .
well , and the fun comes anyway .
this was already evident in the early evening when the commission &apos;s first visitors came to the open air .
a festival for all generations had the organiz@@ ers promised .
and that is what you have done .
around the supply levels on the bur@@ gun@@ dy garden me@@ ado@@ w , sal@@ z@@ we@@ del@@ er , as well as guests from the surrounding area , had a comfortable time .
it was a very successful and successful show , and the band was able to perform in the same concert .
and the right across the generations .
while the some are looking for blan@@ kets on the extra car@@ ved white sand on the beach bar , others are still looking for a place to drink a quarter of wine in the vin@@ o@@ the@@ k .
but also in the case of children &apos;s cri@@ tics , the volunte@@ ers had to be liter@@ ally all their hands .
the larger used the gra@@ vel tables or participants to form a s@@ ca@@ pe@@ board workshop .
until the great rain came .
just before 5.@@ 30 p.m. , the police cr@@ as@@ ted on the visitors , especially in families of the children seeking the wide and dry .
but the attr@@ acti@@ veness of the festival did not stop .
&quot; there were more people than expected , &quot; said ron sm@@ m , the chief of the &quot; success on earth &quot; .
i therefore oppose any repe@@ ti@@ tion of the great party next year .
although the commission is not entirely satisfied with the content and size of the event , se@@ m made a first record on sunday in relation to the popular vote .
as an ir@@ rit@@ ating person , he described that in the meantime the entrance was stopped .
obviously , the security company was too un@@ willing to make a booking .
the result : some people who have already paid have not been able to enter the site .
the response was very positive and the result was a very good one .
in the first cau@@ tious es@@ timate , the sal@@ tw@@ ater bro@@ ker co-@@ organiz@@ er spoke of about 1@@ 200 visitors who were in the bur@@ g@@ gar@@ ten .
there were problems with the sound technology .
the sal@@ tw@@ o@@ od hi@@ p-@@ hop band blocks the hi@@ p-@@ hop band from the first day of the show .
the techn@@ ici@@ ans were unable to provide a half-@@ way reasonable service .
the planned shi@@ ha@@ -@@ lo@@ ads are not able to be built because the t@@ ents were not ready due to a ty@@ re cr@@ ash .
&quot; next year we will see you in the process &quot; , says the organiz@@ er .
the premi@@ ere of the am@@ u@@ la open air festival was a success of the number of visitors .
and that in bad weather .
however , the organiz@@ ers have made some mistakes that were not correc@@ ted for the first time , but the second time they did remove the problem .
in the social network fac@@ e@@ book too , the organiz@@ ers must make criticism .
&quot; sorry , but for twelve euros has been paid more . &quot;
&quot; you have unfortunately a little bit taken over , &quot; says e@@ le zim@@ mer@@ mann at the same place .
others see the initial problems not quite as closely .
i find it very good that some people are not only st@@ up@@ id , but also really trying to do something about their feet .
h@@ ats off ! &apos; , wri@@ tes ste@@ ph@@ ani@@ e jen@@ ß to the am@@ ula .
now the organiz@@ ers have a year to complete this critical review .
new rad@@ om in ber@@ k@@ um : wat@@ ch@@ berg ’ s land@@ mark shr@@ ines shr@@ in@@ ks
this is expected to be the case .
instead , the ready building part is waiting for the mar@@ gin to be integrated into the distinc@@ tive construction .
the action is in the context of a major measure : almost 50 years after the creation of the space observ@@ atory ti@@ ra , the shell , the so-called ra@@ dom , is being completely renewed .
the new rad@@ om is equipped with a di@@ ameter of 4@@ 7.@@ 5 meters a little smaller than the old one .
the size remains un@@ changed , however , and world record .
the last step to complete the list of new cases is the c@@ app@@ ing .
the upper quarter of the old case is covered with a white , blue col@@ lar .
after that , the last quarter of the new shell will be set up .
if the weather is involved , the action should start at the beginning of this week .

do the bur@@ g@@ vere@@ ins soon re@@ treat in a str@@ an@@ ger ?
finally , there have been repeated stri@@ fe between the two wol@@ fr@@ at@@ sha@@ us@@ er bur@@ g@@ vere@@ ins .
now the pre@@ dec@@ ess@@ ors think about possible cooperation .
as an example of reconstruction of the wol@@ fr@@ at@@ sha@@ us@@ en castle , the late richard wag@@ ner , who had been in power since the 19@@ 3@@ 0s , led the way .
just a year ago , no good climate prevail@@ ed between the bur@@ g@@ vere@@ in and the friends of wol@@ fr@@ at@@ sha@@ us@@ en .
the situation in the united states has been very different so far .
now , the two camps are moving to one another : they are to begin talks about a common approach .
this is confirmed by the board of directors of tor@@ ste@@ n s@@ j@@ ö@@ berg ( bur@@ g@@ vere@@ in ) and her@@ bert pi@@ ff@@ l ( bur@@ g@@ fre@@ un@@ de ) on request from our newspaper .
&quot; i have listened to mr pi@@ ff@@ l and proposed that we should look at each other , &quot; says s@@ j@@ ö@@ berg .
in his view , all members of both clubs could in future be pul@@ led together again .
for example , rapid visible succ@@ esses can be recorded .
while the bur@@ g@@ fre@@ un@@ de around the su@@ dden dec@@ eas@@ ed richard di@@ mb@@ ath had been a re@@ building of the castle on the ber@@ g@@ wal@@ d until the last moment , the castle club around s@@ j@@ ö@@ berg stands for &quot; discovery and discovery &quot; .
her@@ bert pi@@ ff@@ l , the second chairman of the bur@@ g@@ fre@@ un@@ de , has declared himself to be very pleased with the call .
since di@@ mb@@ ath@@ s died , he has been standing before his bur@@ g@@ friends .
a new chairman is due to be appointed in mid-@@ september in a members &apos; meeting .
at the moment , the association is one of the 40 members according to the 7@@ 4-@@ year-@@ old .
&quot; after the death of my friend richard , i was able to see the light of day in the club activities out of respect .
according to pi@@ ff@@ l , the new chairman is then to be appointed to the meeting with the bur@@ g@@ vere@@ in .
until then , the us and its bur@@ g@@ friends could also afford to take a look at the current mo@@ od within their group .
to find a candidate for the presidency is not yet available , pi@@ ff@@ l says .
&quot; but i am confident that the world will find itself , &quot; he said .
the new chairman should be a wol@@ fr@@ at@@ sha@@ us@@ er .
the oil zer wo@@ ol on the project &quot; but very gl@@ adly continue to work &quot; .
the different positions in the area of reconstruction are , in the eyes of pi@@ ff@@ ls , likely to remain in the near future .
he acknowled@@ ges di@@ mb@@ ath as &quot; mi@@ sion@@ ary &quot; , who is always interested in re@@ building the castle .
two similar , already well advanced , projects are being implemented in austria and france , showing that this idea is not a pi@@ pe dream .
by high participation of the population and by voluntary help from the whole world , they are a tourist mag@@ net .
pi@@ ff@@ l : &quot; i was also at the beginning ske@@ p@@ tical .
but over time , i have become more and more convinced that the european union is useful to have the project moving forward &quot; .
there is a lot of work to do here .
moreover , the project would be supported by eu subsidies , visitor tickets and potential don@@ ations .
&quot; the idea of re@@ building wants to be personal because i do not want to simply over@@ board , &quot; he hopes that the bur@@ g@@ vere@@ in will perhaps move a little on this point .
their aim , the story first docum@@ ented , is &quot; to make the world a better place &quot; .
after that , we could continue .
cle@@ ver ways to save on un@@ i tra@@ ine@@ es , books and other related materials .

a student could , for example , &quot; calcul@@ us &quot; for the duration of a sem@@ ester for about $ 20 .
find out about the terms of the business at the company you rent , even about the criminal fees , the possible costs for the writing of notes and / or sign@@ atures .
ren@@ ters pay attention : if you book not returned , you can leave the penalty to the price of a new book even exce@@ eding the price of a new book .
e-@@ books are a way to make your online book@@ ings more comfortable and more secure .
e-@@ books are also available instead of conventional tex@@ t@@ books .
sometimes these books are de fac@@ to ren@@ ted , by a form of electronic license for a certain period of time for whol@@ es@@ al@@ ers such as amaz@@ on@@ .com , che@@ g@@ g and bar@@ nes &amp; no@@ ble inc .
upon check-in photo identification and credit card is required .
br@@ ac@@ ey says that students in liter@@ ary cur@@ ricul@@ ums often have the best offers , as many classi@@ cs are downloaded free of charge today , while scientific and engineering students are free to use .
to be sure , look around .
jo@@ e ga@@ ult , 29 , the next president of the pe@@ pper group , will be taking part in the pe@@ pp@@ ers law school in the near future .
and before an online order you should check , so ga@@ ult , if the book is actually available .
this lesson lear@@ nt from the experience of the har@@ sh tour .
he bought a book , that was published four weeks ago and paid for it to the full price at the college book store .
why &quot; guar@@ di@@ ans of the gal@@ ax@@ y &quot; is not a cash battle ?
&quot; the exter@@ ior of the hotel is a bit of a &quot; old &quot; , but it is a little bit of a &quot; old &quot; style .
the c@@ d-@@ rom image file , which is custom@@ ized to camer@@ on di@@ a@@ z , played at the opening weekend only 14@@ .@@ 6 million dollars , while children &apos;s films like &quot; drag@@ on &apos;s &quot; were easily made 2 &quot; also on the revenue .
an article by the te@@ leg@@ ram film cri@@ tic ro@@ bin@@ son , published in the magazine , suggests that the first two films were made in the world , with the lack of quality in films .
col@@ lin described 20@@ 14 as &quot; the worst of the year &quot; for children &apos;s films and described it as &quot; dr@@ ach@@ en@@ z@@ ä@@ h@@ men easily made 2 &quot; as a purely &quot; functional &quot; fant@@ as@@ y continuation .
in films for a slightly older version of the target group , however , it seems as if the quality of the films does not necessarily solve the problem .
in july , entertainment and the internet compared the internet to the average cinema size of the united states .
the results are based on the opinion of the cinem@@ at@@ o@@ graphic visitors and film cri@@ tics , and suggest that the film festi@@ vals will be similar to last year &apos;s .
some comm@@ ent@@ ators say that the development on its own is due to changing hab@@ its of seeing and the growing popul@@ arity of web stre@@ aming services such as net@@ f@@ li@@ x .
director of the film j@@ on fav@@ re@@ au , who is currently working on dis@@ ney &apos;s soon to be released jun@@ g@@ le book film , said to the dutch tv channel ho@@ ll@@ y@@ wood re@@ porter : &quot; i think the times are changing .
we must accept this and not try to put a stop to the past .
unlike other countries that are currently weak , the us is not able to maintain a high level of net f@@ li@@ x income in recent times .
last summer , the council of directors cri@@ tici@@ zed ste@@ ven spi@@ el@@ berg for not having been able to get involved in the film .
in the light of the current down@@ turn , the us argu@@ es that the us is not the world ’ s ble@@ ak predic@@ tion .
due to the economic crisis that is expected in the summer of 20@@ 15 , including as@@ en@@ ger : age of ul@@ tr@@ on , mini@@ ons and ju@@ r@@ assi@@ c world , other representatives of the film industry are more optim@@ istic :
the producer of x-@@ men , si@@ mun@@ on kin@@ berg , decided to describe the decline in cash results recently as simply &quot; cy@@ clic@@ ally &quot; and said to h@@ ö@@ l@@ y@@ wood records that the company is not yet in the process of summer .
when a few years ago , the 2nd table tennis district class was set up for the purpose of stre@@ am@@ lining the li@@ gen division , the hotel is a step in the right direction .
now the german table tennis federation has decided to add a third league .
the result : if you don &apos;t have grown up , you have gone .
for example , g@@ ö@@ tt@@ ingen ’ s highest team tor@@ pe@@ do has won the top ten of the category in the upper lig@@ a release , but is still playing in the coming season .
four@@ th-@@ class , tor@@ pe@@ do &apos;s ladies are still very strong , despite their mar@@ v@@ ell@@ ous pass@@ age into the regional league .
the young and girls of tor@@ pe@@ do start in the lower sa@@ x@@ ony league , as well as the bo@@ ys of the s@@ c we@@ en@@ de .
the s@@ g leng@@ ler@@ ers and the tor@@ pe@@ do reserve are entering the final phase of the new association league .
the ladies play a role in the tt@@ v ge@@ is@@ mar in the association league , which is tor@@ pe@@ do second in the provin@@ cial league .
what is expected of the composition is a better district class , but it is now the new district object .
here t@@ sv sv si@@ eu@@ ling@@ en , v@@ f@@ b l@@ ö@@ d@@ ing@@ sen , tor@@ pe@@ do iii , ge@@ is@@ mar , ein@@ bec@@ k , ham@@ en@@ ste@@ dt , bo@@ ven@@ der sv , lan@@ gen@@ hol@@ ten@@ sen , f@@ c .
in the district sli@@ ga , as regional representatives d@@ ran@@ s@@ fel@@ d and the s@@ c we@@ en@@ de play , in the district class of the tt@@ c ii , re@@ d-@@ we@@ iss , the bo@@ ven@@ der sv ii and the teams of the tt@@ c .
g@@ ün@@ ter@@ sen , the tt@@ c and the tt@@ v ge@@ is@@ mar ii are here with the most important players .
in the district sli@@ ga you will run tor@@ pe@@ do iii and sat@@ ten@@ haus@@ en / w@@ ö@@ ll@@ mar@@ sha@@ us@@ en .
with nine teams each , the team will be able to win the first prize in the nine teams , each with nine teams .
the s@@ c w@@ en@@ de sen@@ ds its girls to the small district sli@@ ga .
the district authorities also have a role to play in the sc@@ w youth - there is another tor@@ pe@@ do ii race - but it is not complete .
in a district class , the ment@@ ally s@@ mi@@ ths , tus@@ po we@@ en@@ de and bo@@ ven@@ der sv go to the season .
in the first season of the newly established regi@@ on@@ s@@ ver@@ band start the two go@@ d@@ d@@ esses district clubs with a total of nine teams each .
in the west stage , the two teams are red and white ii , bo@@ ven@@ der sv iii , lau@@ bach ii , tor@@ pe@@ do iv and the v , m@@ tv gr@@ one , d@@ ran@@ s@@ fel@@ der s@@ c ii , mi@@ el@@ en@@ haus@@ en .
in the east asian region , the most important are the sat@@ ten@@ haus@@ en / w@@ ö@@ ll@@ mar@@ sha@@ us@@ en , ni@@ ko@@ la@@ us@@ berg and land@@ ol@@ f@@ sha@@ us@@ en .
the ladies &apos; circle lounge is made of sa@@ tin leather with a black leather upper and a black leather upper .
this is still better than in the district of o@@ ster@@ o@@ de , where it is not at all a women team at the level of their travel .
what is striking is that none of the six 2nd circle classes have been reached , here the difference between the innovative and pro@@ active cycle of the board of directors will have to take some thought .
nato summit : first pro@@ tests in new@@ port and car@@ di@@ ff
at the weekend there were pro@@ tests from oppon@@ ents of the nato summit in new@@ port .
on saturday , the members of the european parliament gathered in the centre of new@@ port to an anti-@@ nato march .
on sunday , some 150 people arrived in car@@ di@@ ff before the city hall in car@@ di@@ ff to create a so-called counter@@ -@@ summit .

i was concerned about the relationship , and about 20 o &apos;@@ clock the police stopped , when the two were not returning home .
a drug ad@@ dic@@ t from local police and re@@ bel groups has brought a new life to the streets and the couple have been killed at about 11 p.m. near the brid@@ al ve@@ il water@@ falls .
the girl had been at the k@@ ne@@ e and the man was cr@@ ash@@ ed and had bur@@ nt his head .
b@@ ail@@ outs remained a matter of urgency over@@ night for the couple , and they were exp@@ elled on monday morning .
they were written in stable condition with a hospital car in the blood .
government anti-@@ government pro@@ tests in pakistan es@@ cal@@ ate .
the approximately 1000 demonstr@@ ators were arrested by soldiers from the p@@ tv building .
the channel has been named after a little over half an hour .
p@@ t@@ v director ath@@ ar far@@ o@@ o@@ q said that the bu@@ gs are equipped with demonstr@@ ators .
dead or missing persons were not reported .
the demonstr@@ ators are calling for the re@@ sign@@ ation of the head of government to whom they acc@@ use electoral fraud .
the police told me that there was a kil@@ ome@@ tre from the prime minister &apos;s residence , na@@ wa@@ z shar@@ if , to the monday , but that he was again in the middle of cl@@ ash@@ es with some 3@@ 000 demonstr@@ ators with security forces .
after hospital information , a polic@@ em@@ an was in@@ ju@@ red .
at the weekend at least three people were killed and more than 500 were in@@ ju@@ red when demonstr@@ ators tried to prove sh@@ aria ’ s residence .
they are calling for the re@@ sign@@ ation of the prime minister .
the mi@@ gh@@ ty military had a very large majority on sunday evening after a meeting in the army headquarters .
it was also said in the communication that &apos; the army remains in its role to protect the security of the state &apos; .
the es@@ cal@@ ating violence has caused concern for intervention by the military , which has led to the destruction of the civilian population and the destruction of the civilian population .
the op@@ posi@@ tional opposition politici@@ an im@@ ran kh@@ an and the pre@@ dis@@ er ta@@ hi@@ ru@@ l q@@ add@@ i have been pro@@ testing for years .

kh@@ an and q@@ ad@@ ri had their follow@@ ers on sunday to make the world ’ s first war@@ ri@@ ors .
&quot; we will not go back without sh@@ aria , for the re@@ sign@@ ation of sh@@ aria , &quot; said kh@@ an .
q@@ ad@@ ri expressed his similar view .
kh@@ an also acc@@ uses sh@@ ar@@ if of being a parliamentary election last may by che@@ ating .
q@@ ad@@ ri calls for the re@@ sign@@ ation of central and provin@@ cial governments .
then a transitional government should have the electoral system re@@ formed and elections should be called for .
more than 40 000 security forces are in operation , with the aim of protecting the government quarter .
the demonstr@@ ators had initially peaceful and had been able to stand in front of parliament until kh@@ an and q@@ add@@ i had left them at the weekend to take a stand on sh@@ ari@@ fs ’ residence .
h@@ ü@@ t@@ tel@@ dor@@ fer after second season victory on place three of the table .
with the 2 : 0 via gr@@ ö@@ di@@ g has for rapi@@ d a bit@@ ter week on sunday a conc@@ ili@@ atory end .
&quot; the victory is very liber@@ ating &quot; , said co@@ ach z@@ or@@ an bar@@ i@@ sic , whose team with the money in the europe leadership awards on thursday is an intermedi@@ ate low .
&quot; the most successful experience in the history of the company was the very important one &quot; , confirmed captain and tor@@ sch@@ ut@@ ze ste@@ ff@@ en ho@@ f@@ mann , who was on the third place with green white .
sch@@ ram@@ me@@ l dre@@ am@@ tor brings rapid to sie@@ ger@@ stra@@ ß@@ e rapi@@ d with the second season of victory the right response to the dis@@ appointment against hel@@ sin@@ ki .
&quot; we wanted to respond posi@@ tively , &quot; said foreign def@@ en@@ der thomas sch@@ ram@@ me@@ l , who was with his splendid leadership vol@@ ley of the six@@ teenth in the 14@@ th minute the soft on victory .
&quot; i have thought that i h@@ ad@@ n &apos;t seen all the fru@@ stration of thursday and i was s@@ nor@@ ing him . &quot;
as a shr@@ ine on 13 november , the first german film to be released in a federal league , the german bun@@ des@@ lig@@ a team was still available for ri@@ ed .
the first championship meeting took place in the rapi@@ d-@@ d@@ ress .
&quot; for me , this is something very special , i am from the rapid growth of the young &quot; , said sch@@ r@@ am@@ me@@ l .
due to the short-term bec@@ k@@ en-@@ b@@ ess@@ ur of mari@@ o pa@@ ve@@ lic back in the early days , sch@@ ram@@ me@@ l came from the left to the right def@@ ensive side and made his thing very good there .
he has enough experience to be able to maintain this position .
the gate has been earned , it has been opened this year already some assi@@ sts , &quot; pra@@ ises bar@@ is@@ sic .
team shows character sch@@ r@@ am@@ me@@ l delivered also the f@@ lan@@ k to the 2 : 0 by ho@@ f@@ mann to a good hour , which finally made the decision .
because we could have been war@@ ned by our guests .
&quot; thank god we have today something happ@@ i@@ er &quot; , he noted .
b@@ ari@@ sic has been in the process of &quot; being &quot; in many games be@@ fore@@ hand than it is today &quot; - against &quot; the strong@@ est team that has been in this season at this sta@@ dium &quot; .
the first three-@@ point since 26 july i have therefore proved that the european team team structure is the back@@ ward .
for him it is no less gra@@ ti@@ fying : &quot; that we finally have to play again zero &quot; .
a lot of work during the time of the country break is also the fact that bri@@ an beh@@ ren@@ dt , mari@@ o pa@@ ve@@ lic , christ@@ op@@ her di@@ b@@ on , den@@ i al@@ ar and michael sch@@ imp@@ el@@ s@@ ber@@ ger have several days .
&quot; you can &apos;t forget that &quot; , he war@@ ned bar@@ i@@ sic that the man in the last three days was with a lot of re@@ stra@@ int and pav@@ eli@@ c players , &quot; the people who have been very stable la@@ tely &quot; .
the country games are scheduled to take place in the end , so that the &quot; w@@ ounds &quot; can be lic@@ ked and a little bit increased in the physical sphere , &quot; explained bar@@ is@@ ic , who had five u@@ 2@@ 1 out@@ lets in his hands .
one , to which the break is most important , is cap@@ ital@@ . the captain ho@@ f@@ mann .
he is ign@@ oring the need for the team , goes beyond pain and is not alone in his life .
in this difficult period in particular , he has shown that he is a very important player for us , &quot; said kon@@ sta@@ ti@@ ed bar@@ is@@ sic .
ho@@ f@@ mann gave the game rapi@@ ds before his exp@@ on@@ ential ex@@ change@@ . in the 6@@ 8@@ th minute , he won the game not only the structure , but also the second gate .
for the 3@@ 3-@@ year-@@ old who has lost his 3@@ 50@@ th bun@@ des@@ lig@@ a match , he was the first sta@@ ff@@ ed out of the game since november 2nd , 2013 ( 4 : 2 on the admir@@ a ) .
ho@@ f@@ mann : &quot; should not believe that now everything is good &quot; &quot; we have certainly also a bit of lu@@ ck .
now it was high time , &quot; said ho@@ f@@ mann .
he war@@ ned volun@@ tar@@ ily that the eu would continue to work in a more focused manner : &apos; we must not always see this in black and white .
we have seen in recent weeks that there has been no improvement in the way that has been described .
we must not forget either that the time has come to make things happen .
the importance of its role for the team was not dispu@@ ted .
it is a very young team , and it is a team that i can very much help at the moment .
they are in some ph@@ ases .
val gar@@ den@@ a co@@ ach michael bau@@ r had chosen and his team had little to blame .
it regre@@ ts the rapid opposite reaction &quot; from the category sp@@ ell@@ tor &quot; , as well as the regular gate of nu@@ tz in the 40@@ th minute , which has been replaced by re@@ fe@@ ree colle@@ gger .
the only criticism i have of the commission &apos;s team is that it is not the direction we are going towards the gate in a few ph@@ ases .
we have too little to make of this .
internal def@@ enders maxim@@ ili@@ an kar@@ ner saw it like : &quot; it has been badly started , then we have just found and even a gate made .
by and large , more could be done .
from this point of view , ru@@ h is ru@@ h .
a powerful st@@ om@@ ach showed us the way to our myster@@ ious task of the summer series &quot; my piece of the rh@@ ö@@ ner lu@@ ck &quot; last friday .
several of these trees are available in the agricultural area , which is illustra@@ ted by the tree .
a hol@@ low foot@@ path leads down to the church of san mar@@ ino , which is approximately 600 years old .
it goes past ko@@ pp@@ el@@ n , bas@@ alt stone h@@ alls and bas@@ alt pla@@ ins .
a little bit below the stone block , from the bau@@ er@@ s@@ berg , one kil@@ ome@@ tre north of the road to we@@ is@@ bach , there is it .
vital sees the natural mon@@ ument , which is ra@@ ining over the other trees and the surrounding area .
a small bud@@ d@@ ha on a tree st@@ um@@ p indicates that the bud@@ d@@ ha is a bud@@ d@@ ha .
but , despite intensive research , there were only indic@@ ations of the name of the person .
dr. wol@@ f@@ gan@@ g sch@@ nei@@ der has also written the bis@@ hop &apos;s home archive and has invited older people from sub@@ ter@@ ran@@ ean brun@@ n to discuss how to improve the quality of the work .
the result of his research was not to be un@@ de@@ res@@ ti@@ mated the reason@@ ably so@@ ber explanation for the name .
so the target date for the introduction of the go@@ at she@@ ep is about 80 years ago , from the un@@ ter@@ wei@@ ß@@ en@@ brun@@ n to the lab@@ ori@@ ously ro@@ lled and fre@@ ed me@@ ado@@ ws .
at the foot of the tree , the trees that are formed from the rise should be explo@@ ited .
meanwhile , the area has lost its importance , because the me@@ ado@@ ws are actually growing again .
the area is also dedicated to the core zone of the bio@@ sphere reserve .
when you enter the stone accum@@ ulation , you should be careful , however .
a hiking trail leads from un@@ ter@@ wei@@ ß@@ en@@ brun@@ n to the tree , which is hidden a little .
further paths are sign@@ posted and you can follow the direction of ho@@ ch@@ rhe@@ h@@ ö@@ n and reach a vast distance of hiking .
where is the water@@ castle ?
a water@@ castle , which is a great challenge for us , is a very small one .
the mirror in the mo@@ at already gives a good impression of the building , but we have a few historic buildings in the district , including the building counter@@ part fe@@ i .
where is our &quot; piece of the rh@@ ö@@ ner lu@@ ck &quot; ?
my piece rhe@@ ö@@ ner lu@@ ck
as with previous series of main@@ -@@ post in the past years , there are also this year prices to win if you want to find the right solution .
anyone who wants to take photos can also take part .
under the e-mail address red@@ .@@ neu@@ stadt @ main@@ post@@ .de you can send us the solution and also your very own &quot; piece of the rh@@ ö@@ ner lu@@ ck &quot; under this keyword .
the most beautiful photos will be published .
after weeks of tu@@ g-@@ of-@@ war , italy ’ s premier and current eu president , mat@@ te@@ o ren@@ zi , has fought against strong conservative opposition on the eu ’ s special summit last week .
ren@@ zi considers that the world ’ s top newspaper la re@@ pub@@ b@@ lic@@ a is a case in point , but he also considers the appointment of his government team as a fav@@ ori@@ ti@@ st .
it exp@@ ects a break@@ through in the way it is re@@ form@@ ist .
last but not least , ren@@ zi hopes that the increasingly popular anti-@@ him movement will also be able to win the support of the left , because mo@@ g@@ her@@ ini is being held to account , albeit in moderate terms .
the commission has made a clear commitment to the conserv@@ atives with president je@@ an-@@ cla@@ ude jun@@ ck@@ er and to the po@@ les nom@@ inated as president of the council , the pre@@ dominant opinion in rome , in order to achieve political balance .
the chemical industry ’ s chief diplom@@ at will be depu@@ ty prime minister of the commission , jun@@ ck@@ er .
the outstanding work of the eu parliament is to be seen as safe .
otherwise , president gi@@ or@@ gio na@@ polit@@ ano would have the no@@ bel peace prize ’ s 4@@ 1@@ th anniversary nom@@ inated to the ruling democratic party ( p@@ d ) .
la re@@ pub@@ b@@ lic@@ a broad@@ ens optim@@ ism that the long-@@ standing tradition of the leading party offices in the country has been well known and respected for its ambition .
the native of rome , he is married to the british family and has two dau@@ gh@@ ters .
her party career began in the promotion of the police in the united states in 1996 .
in 1999 mo@@ gh@@ er@@ ini was awarded the title of vice president of the european community organization of society for three years .
with the 2001 election in the party council of the left democrats , it rose to the high party politics , worked in the department of foreign policy , whose head she soon became .
it occupied traditional s@@ ali@@ ent italian foreign policy , such as the middle east , with na@@ zi dep@@ loy@@ ment studies , which italy participated in with a cont@@ ingent of troops .
since 2008 she is a member of the chamber of depu@@ ties , where she is an expert on defence and european and international affairs .
as a ren@@ zi in february 20@@ 14 , he was reporting that he had been mo@@ gh@@ er@@ ini .
if the p@@ d is again a better relationship with the strong peace movement in the country , which has become one of the 40 % of the party ’ s votes in the eu elections in may , then as in p@@ d cir@@ cles , i have noted .
the procedure for the brussels summit , the new eu external representative , is too little diplomatic experience , too little political will is lacking .
in brussels , especially in the case of poland and the baltic states , cen@@ sure is being given realistic acc@@ ents of mo@@ gh@@ er@@ ini ’ s crisis in ukraine and is being described as &apos; russia friendly &apos; .
it is in favour of the measures taken by the russian company ga@@ z@@ pro@@ m south stream .
after ren@@ zi had been able to take office as eu president in july , he travell@@ ed to moscow to meet the people of the country for their first visit .
photos taken during the last two weeks with putin at the sha@@ ke@@ -@@ hands were taken in brussels with indi@@ gn@@ ation , as well as the fact that they were being sent to the kre@@ m@@ lin head for october to a milan economic summit .
a total of nine young people took up their education at em@@ z-@@ han@@ au@@ er in n@@ ab@@ burg on monday .

mr v@@ all@@ es called on the deeply divided opposition to the european union to &apos; re@@ new its love &apos; for the controversial socialist re@@ alism .
the president deserves everyone &apos;s respect .
&quot; it is our duty to work alongside him .
as a appe@@ as@@ ement , the prime minister insi@@ sted that his government should not use the contro@@ vers@@ y of a 3@@ 5-@@ hour week in france , despite strong demands for a relaxation of the em@@ manu@@ el ma@@ zen regulation .
on saturday , mr hol@@ lan@@ de had his fellow socialists ur@@ ged him to join the &apos; united &apos; with the government .
but christian is ta@@ u@@ bi@@ ra , the minister of justice , stres@@ ses the sand to the gear , and in which she is killed at a meeting .
marine le pen , the well on the right hand of the national front , is ri@@ dic@@ ul@@ ously dis@@ cour@@ aged the continuing fighting of the socialists and said that they would not imagine the european union &apos;s new v@@ all &apos;s government taking longer than a few months .
fran@@ co@@ is hol@@ lan@@ de is the emper@@ or without clothes , but prin@@ ce manu@@ el v@@ all@@ s has also no , she is forced to wear a new government .
and the new will also be the autumn or winter not survive , &quot; said fr@@ ä@@ u@@ le@@ in le pen to sup@@ porters .
they repeated the call of their party for a dis@@ solution of parliament and said that they were confident that the elections would be held in advance .
the ruling party of france , for its part , suffered a defe@@ at in the local elections in march and the right-@@ wing national front was in the hands of the european parliament in the may elections .

putin is demanding that ki@@ e@@ v be allowed to join &quot; state@@ -@@ building talks &quot; with the eastern ukraine .
the russian president v@@ la@@ di@@ mir putin promised to re@@ build russian media reports on sunday , that the ukra@@ inian government would not toler@@ ate the fighting against the separ@@ ati@@ sts in the east of the country and start negotiations immediately on &quot; state@@ hood &quot; .
his spo@@ kes@@ man , di@@ mit@@ ri pes@@ ko@@ w , later made it clear that putin was not meant to be a “ big man ” under the control of the separ@@ ati@@ st region of eastern ukraine .
putin ’ s call to the ki@@ e@@ v government to negotiate on an equal foot@@ ing with the pro-@@ russian insur@@ g@@ ents f@@ its in with the policy he has pursued since the ri@@ ots began five months ago .
in an interview with the state television station channel one condemned the death of putin , the ukra@@ inian military campaign against the re@@ con@@ quest of the people occupied by separ@@ ati@@ sts in the eastern regions of don@@ e@@ z@@ k and lu@@ han@@ sk , which took place in march .
the kre@@ m@@ lin and the separ@@ ati@@ sts have recently lost the money they have received as a &quot; no@@ o@@ si@@ ja &quot; or &quot; ne@@ us@@ ch@@ wan@@ der@@ ung &quot; , a concept that is linked to the pre-@@ revolutionary gl@@ ory of russian empire .
putin pointed out that the us is all those who are in power as a result of ukra@@ inian politicians ’ campaigns for the elections on 26 october .
&quot; we need to get down to detailed discussions immediately , not only on technical issues , but also on the political organisation of society and the state status of south-@@ east ukraine , in order to safeguard the interests of the people living there , &quot; he said .
pes@@ car@@ a said that the putin regime ’ s reference to the state of the world in the context of greater autonomy is a matter for the past months .
only ukra@@ ini@@ ans government can guarantee the eastern territories the necessary autonomy and the necessary political autonomy , said pes@@ ko@@ w .
it is not a question of negotiations between ukraine and russia , said pes@@ ko@@ w , &apos; because it is not a conflict between russia and ukraine &apos; .
the clari@@ fication of the kre@@ m@@ lin &apos;s spo@@ kes@@ man for correc@@ ting the &quot; mis@@ interpretation &quot; of putin &apos;s remarks under@@ sco@@ red the leadership claim of russia in dealing with separ@@ ati@@ st repres@@ sion .
moscow – the us would have far greater difficulty in getting the regions of don@@ et@@ sk and lu@@ han@@ sk to the east of ukraine , as the majority of the 6.@@ 5 million inhabitants do not belong to rus@@ sians and do not want to receive surve@@ ys from the pre-@@ conflict .
the autonomy that the european union has acquired from russian diplom@@ ats in international for@@ a would help regional governments in ukraine to overcome the current crisis of their own trade agreements and external relations , and thus help the kre@@ m@@ lin de fac@@ to gain control over an area .
the directive on the protection of personal data , anne@@ xed to the black sea five months ago , is the home port for most of the russian na@@ vy and an important trading port and historical coastal region .
the regions between the ro@@ sto@@ v region in russia and the cri@@ me@@ a are also rich in mines , fac@@ tories and gi@@ es@@ ser@@ i@@ e@@ es , which are important components of the russian military .
the ukra@@ inian president pe@@ tr@@ o por@@ o@@ sh@@ en@@ ko proposed to the president of the republic of moldova in his speech on the in@@ aug@@ ur@@ ation of 7 june that ukra@@ inian legislation should be concerned about addi@@ tions to the constitution with which the territories were given control .
but his idea of autonomy seems to be shar@@ p@@ ly opposed to that of the kre@@ m@@ lin and the separ@@ ati@@ st re@@ be@@ ls whose occupation is a matter of complete destruction .
putin ’ s last call to k@@ il &apos;@@ ja@@ e@@ v to negotiate with the separ@@ ati@@ st leaders on an equal foot@@ ing followed the same path .
the russian support for separ@@ ati@@ sts over@@ took the country ’ s borders in the hand@@ book , which , according to the fears of ukra@@ inian security officials , was the first step in a campaign to take over the strategic coastal region .
for this reason , massive civilian and military aid is needed .

cycling , jo@@ gging , and hiking : the first day of the mountain bike tour was held yesterday .
the tour , which is for some a tor@@ tu@@ r , was a great success for the others .
in one , however , everyone agreed that there was fun .
thomas stu@@ dan@@ ski will be on the road last night .
for the first time in his life , the chief of the supreme ur@@ se@@ le bre@@ w@@ house was on the fel@@ d@@ berg yesterday with the bike .
for the good purpose .
the little mus@@ cle cat@@ cher can be found easily .
a great thing .
&quot; i don &apos;t know that i can - pri@@ ma ! &quot;
small village of the same name on the way in the applause cur@@ ve ?
ne@@ e , if i once stopped , i wat@@ ched the news .
as thomas stu@@ dan@@ ski , who is responsible for the c@@ du in ob@@ er@@ ur@@ sel@@ er city council , pain@@ ts many of the 7@@ 18 participants yesterday in the spring of the city and came to the exhaus@@ tion , but fortunately happy .
others , by contrast , were more likely to lose the ele@@ ven kilometres long stre@@ tch between ho@@ he@@ mark and fel@@ d@@ berg .
nor@@ man di@@ ess@@ ner , for example .
the nearby ro@@ t tower is a great example of how to get to know the city .
he too is the track in a sli@@ de .
for the two tri@@ athle@@ tes , the &quot; field ber@@ g-@@ ra@@ de@@ ls &quot; was not necessarily a sporting challenge : &quot; here &apos;s the question of char@@ ity , there we are happy to be with it - an exit would be worth it anyway &quot; .
on the way , they had paul w@@ en@@ z@@ el from ob@@ er@@ re@@ i@@ f@@ en@@ berg met .
the young ( 12 ) was in the morning to ob@@ er@@ ur@@ sel , to get straight to the city ’ s al@@ titude .
the frankfurt fl@@ ori@@ an or@@ in@@ z had already settled around 9 a.m. in the morning in the sadd@@ le .
i was also very pleased with fr@@ it@@ ten@@ -@@ ton@@ i .
for check-in , the chief of the supreme court of the k@@ ul@@ t@@ ki@@ os@@ k , cycling tours through the fel@@ d@@ berg are just part of this .
he had a great deal of experience with his 6.@@ 5-@@ kil@@ o racing bike .
a cra@@ zy event .
for this purpose - and i am happy to be here , &quot; andre@@ as bal@@ z@@ ke said .
the dur@@ ch@@ tra@@ in@@ ing@@ ed main@@ zer says that he has a &quot; ambitious &quot; character .
this must also be the case , because he was familiar with the &apos; fixed wheel &apos; .
the fact that there is no wheel lo@@ ose is a proof that it was not only the 20 hi@@ kers who cross the white wall and the fo@@ o@@ th@@ old to the summit that showed their interest , but also a jo@@ gger who took part in a cor@@ d .
ber@@ g@@ w@@ ach@@ t doctor professor vol@@ ker lis@@ ch@@ ke , who has worked with his team , equipped with all@@ wheel bus@@ ses , and qu@@ ad , for safety .
the 7@@ 18 participants - and thus as many as never before - were in the morning in groups on the track .
the hi@@ kers first at 9.@@ 30 a.m.
the first two years of the history of the town followed .
five minutes later , the first mountain bi@@ kers left .
b@@ ent han@@ sen , chairman of the association &quot; cycling on the great field mountain &quot; , gave the start comm@@ ands and w@@ ished the participants to have a nice trip .
for next year i hope that he will be able to complete the route to fel@@ d@@ berg to ensure the safety of the participants .
