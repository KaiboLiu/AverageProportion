reconsideration of the very american ideal of labour rights as human rights
congressmen keith ellison and john lewis have tabled a legislative proposal to improve the organisation of trade unions as citizens &apos; rights .
&quot; like trade unions die , so do the middle class jobs .
i am therefore proud , together with the citizens &apos; rights initiative john lewis , to have the staff authorisation act .
this groundbreaking law gives workers the same legal opportunities in the event of discrimination on the grounds of the organisation of trade unions as in other forms of discrimination - and thus stops anti-union forces .
the addition of the national employment law to provide an opportunity for discrimination against workers who have been exposed to the organisation of trade union representation , in order to appeal for justice in a civil court - and to avoid compensation or penalties .
but it is certainly not a radical initiative - certainly not in accordance with american standards .
indeed , the best way to understand what is ellison , lewis , and other sponsors is to use the legislative proposal to establish the link back to a very american idea .
despite the setbacks that trade unions have been facing in recent years - in wisconsin , milosevic and other countries across the country - americans once welcomed countries around the world .
there was a time when millions of americans , including the us , remembered when it was building democracy , freedom of speech , freedom of the press and the right of association in one breath .
when the united states , after world war ii , occupied japan , general douglas mac arthur and his staff encouraged the country to adopt a constitution that would ensure that japan would remain a militarised autocracy .
with full awareness of the fact that workers and their trade unions are working to create a new japan , they used a language that was explicitly defined as the “ national ” language .
when the united states , after world war ii , occupied germany , general dwight david eisenhower and his staff urged the germans to write a constitution that would ensure that fascism would be adolf hitler ’ s .
recognising that the workers are willing to organize , and their voice in the new nation , they are encouraged to join the new nation by a clause that explicitly states that the “ no ” side is the right to associate .
agreements that restrict this right or aim to prevent it from being implemented are not worth the money .
when the former first lady eleanor roosevelt was in the chair of the international commission on human rights , which the general declaration of human rights was drafted , as it was signed by the united nations in 1948 as a global agreement .
americans have for generations accepted the basic premise that labour rights are human rights .
when this country reported to other countries how to build civil and democratic societies , it declared that americans would not be allowed to exercise the right to establish a trade union - and that this trade union would then be involved in collective negotiations as equal partners .
after these rights were violated in america , it is indeed wise to look at the american ideal again .
like pastor martin luther king jr. 50 years ago , he said :
history is a great teacher .
now everyone knows that the workers &apos; movement is the nation &apos;s strength , not its limits .
by raising living standards for millions of people , work has been miraculously creating a market for industry and bringing the entire nation to an unimaginable level of production .
those who want to attack work forget these simple truths , but history preserves them .
history remembers , and we should do so .
formal recognition of labour rights as human rights - and the extension of protection of citizens &apos; rights as protection against discrimination in the creation of employee representation - is long overdue .
keith ellison and john lewis renew the ideals that america has made great in the past , and that have redeemed the promise of democracy .
judge temporarily stops law that all abuses of abortion in locisiana are to close .
a us federal judge stopped the trial on sunday for the time being in louisiana , which was referred to by lawyers as &apos; presumably closing all five departments of abortion &apos; .
this measure , which was adopted by bobby jindal , governor of louisiana , in june , as a law and which was adopted on 1 september , would require doctors , who are abortions .
the judge ’ s decision , however , means that doctors are still legally required to carry out abortions for the time being , while they are requesting such a right .
&quot; the plaintiffs may continue to work in accordance with the law while they are seeking to obtain these rights , &quot; bundesrichter john degravelles wrote in his judgment .
within a month , a hearing will be organised for the judge to ensure that the law is more permanent .
supporters of abortion welcomed the decision to include the latest in a series of judgments against similar measures and said that doctors would take so much time to get the hospital and hospital records .
&quot; today &apos;s decision means that women in louisiana are subjected to a devious law that threatens their health and their rights , &quot; said nancy northup , president and chair of the centre for reproductive rights .
it was not immediately clear whether the judgment would also affect doctors from the two clinics .
louisiana is one of 11 countries that have adopted similar laws , and courts have recently adopted such measures in alabama and mississippi for non-constitutional .
key points of a law in texas that covers most of the remaining clinical and medical clinics .
supporters of abortion and the american college of east asia have been calling for a ban on abortion , as well as the american medical association .
opponents of abortion argue that the measures should be aimed at protecting women &apos;s health , even though some may have the effect of closing clinics .
only a doctor who is in louisiana has abortions has a patient &apos;s involvement in the treatment .
if all other doctors in the state are forced to do not carry out abortions , this doctor would be forced to leave the operation for fear of his safety , the group said .
in your argument against the judgment , representatives of the state of louisiana said that they did not allow doctors to take abortions .
delayed diagnoses and a lack of access to the best treatment opportunities lead to higher death rates from egg cancer .
angelina jolie and her brother james have a video hosted the show for her mother .
for women in rural areas of australia , there is a higher risk of becoming tied to egg cancer than to women in cities .
researchers analyzed the medical data of more than 1100 australians , with eggs cancer in 2005 being detected , and found that only 25 % of the data were available five years after diagnosis .
the research director susan jordan of the qimr berghofer medical research institute said that for those who work in rural and remote areas , the state is not the only one .
small study : new medicines could contain lung and egg cancer .
researchers investigated the medical care of women over seven years .
dr. jordan said that a woman &apos;s age in diagnosis , type of egg cancer , is a constant concern of existing predispositions and social and economic status .
for older women and those whose cancer is used as a diagnosis , it is a good idea to have a vaccine for the lowest survival rate .
for those who live in rural and remote regions of the state , the ratio of mortality to death was only 0.5 % during the study .
although the study did not investigate why outside the city live women with higher probability of ice-popping cancer died , the study suggests that the disease was caused by a belated diagnosis and a lack of access to the best treatment centres .
&quot; this disease is best treated by gynaecological oncologists , and these are usually found in larger cities , &quot; said she .
despite the improvement of telemedicine services to meet distances , the commission proposed a new approach to the problem of distance .
dr. jordan said that the study is independent of geographical status , and that it is a poor long-term survival rate for women in egg cancer and underscored the need for better treatment and prevention .
the rio tinto ride to conquer cancer funding is a study that is being carried out today in the medical journal of australia .
in march 2013 elisha neave , a young mother of 33 years , was told by the gold coast that she had an aggressive form of ovarian cancer .
garden centres regret falling house owners , and the number of people in the garden is falling .
the decline , together with an increased reduction in the number of homeowners under the age of 35 , could result in tens of thousands of pounds losing each year if today ’ s young consumers , following a study by the hta , are treated as described in the financial study .
the report states that tenants are 55 percent of the amount on average , which is paid to people with homes for their garden .
the increase in people living in highly urbanized areas without gardens is a major cause of concern for the popular procedure to use parking areas for asphalt and the falling demand for garden size .
in london , where more than a quarter of a century of population growth has been recorded , the share of homeowners fell from 61 % to 43 % .
the hta and royal horticultural society have agreed to the need to improve housing for the elderly and to build small gardens .
guy barter , chief garden advisor for the rhs said : &quot; container gardeners are not available to tenants , for example , because they sell their plants in a move . &quot;
the hta report identified the period between 1997 and 2005 as the &apos; golden age &apos; of the garden retail trade due to rising house ownership .
it predicts a total of eur 1.2 billion in the market this year , due to the better weather conditions in the winter and the unpleasant weather in march and april last year .
the opposition leader , imran khuran , and the clerical tahirul qadri , have been protesting pakistan .
in the capital islamabad , around 1000 demonstrators have broadcast the state television channel ptv .
minister of information pervaiz rashid said that soldiers had repatriated the protesters from ptv buildings .
the station was located in the center of the station for about 40 minutes , but it is now broadcasting again .
at the same time , around 3000 demonstrators tried to be resident of prime minister nawaz sharif .
the hotel is located in the heart of the city , just a few minutes from the city centre and the train station .
the police used teargas .
the demonstrators called for sharif ’ s resignation , but he rejects it .
the army of the country is now calling for a political solution to the conflict , &apos; without wasting time and using force &apos; .
after a meeting at the headquarters on sunday evening , the european union military announced : &quot; the army remains in its role to protect the security of the state &quot; .
the military plays a major role in pakistan and has already spoken out more frequently .
the opposition politician imran khan raises premium questions about the situation of prime minister sharif in the parliamentary election last may .
the protests were escalating at the weekend after khan and qadri were forced to invite their supporters to sharifs residence .
three people were killed .
turkey orders us diplomat for spy report .
the turkish ministry of foreign affairs has given the most senior us diplomats in the country information on the american and british spies that are being carried out in turkey .
vice-president bülent said that the business owner of the us embassy and turkish officials will discuss the report on monday .
the german magazine der spiegel as well as the online magazine the intercept reported that the information provided by the former us analyst of the national security agency , edward snowden , shows that turkey is a major activity .
according to turkish intelligence , the country played a key role in the international criminal court ’ s decision to set up a new international criminal court in turkey .
a previous report that also included the main secret service of germany ankara in focus , caused a lot of anger .
warnings strike : train drivers are threatening to have consequences for commuters .
the national warning strike of local drivers on monday morning was a good idea to also encourage passenger transport in nrw .
the hotel is scheduled for 6 to 9 p.m. and is currently in service throughout germany , including the long-distance , regional and s-bahn network .
the main thrust of the warnings strike is freight transport .

said the district chairman of the trade union of german locomotives ( gdl ) , sven schmitt , in düsseldorf .
we expect significant failures .
regional priorities exist not .
the main thrust of the warnings strike is freight transport .
deutsche bahn in nrw announced that it will do everything to make the impact as low as possible .
gdl , however , did not say where they want to strike , so it is difficult to see the consequences in concrete terms .
police chief of magaluf the corruption attacked by the police .
the prosecutors issued a letter to the office of the prosecutor of mallorca on friday of extortion by police and accused of human rights violations in the city of calvià .
the head of the calvià police at the holiday island of mallorca was arrested following corruption charges by businessmen and bar-owners in the notorious binge drinking hotspot .
main commissioner josé antonio navarro was arrested following accusations of corruption by several businessmen from punta ballena , the street in which most bars and nightclubs in madagascar are located .
according to the mallorca daily online newspaper , the ankles laid the office of the public prosecutor for corrupt practices in mallorca on friday .
two other localities were occupied by the spanish guardia civil in connection with the corrupt authorities of the spanish republic .
the spanish national daily abc reported that the spanish government ’ s angry nightclub owners had said that they would not accept nepotism .
&quot; it is no longer about making money , it is about survival , &quot; said one of the businessmen to the court .
let us make our livelihoods come out of the game .
we have nothing to lose .
magaluf made a great effort this summer to make the world a better place for her work because of a viral youtube video , in which an 18-year-old british tourist was shown to work on 24 men during a shooting tour fellatio .
the island authorities have since tried to prevent the illegal behaviour of alcoholic beverages in madagascar .
the playhouse club , where the fellatio incident took place , was awarded the title of the best playhouse club in the world for one year , while playhouse and kneipenthouse organizer carnage together received a penalty of € 75,000 .
the tourist resort of magaluf , which is popular with young british tourists , is located in the heart of the city , and is also famous for many accidents involving alcohol .
the first spring day with wet and stormy weather conditions affects flights from the airport of adelaide .
spring has a southern rabbit of winter surprises .
in the evening until 9 p.m. , another 5mm rain fell on the city , after 6.6mm , which was already at night dropped to sunday .
the last rainfall was the result of a series of short , stormy showers , including a cast that was just before 8 p.m. and was rated for almost 4mm in about 10 minutes .
after last week &apos;s winter had been spent on an early dose of spring , the first few months of the winter season in the city fell to a maximum of only 15.8 ° c .
the bad weather conditions probably led to the delay in landing a river in the area of virgin airlines from melbourne to adelaide .
the aircraft should have been flying shortly after 7.30 p.m. , but was taken by a roar wind - a sudden change in wind speed or direction over a short distance - and had to start .
windsurges reached a height of about 50 km / h on the ground at adelaide airport .
the flight data showed that the aircraft was also able to fly in a second landing and finally , by about 20.40 , it was ready .
the flight delay caused the aircraft to be delayed by some other flights , including an emirates flight from dubai and a quantas flight from sydney .
for adelaide , a new maximum temperature of 16 ° c is predicted on tuesday , with possible showers .
matthias says : it is high time to build a great networking network .
given the galloping technical progress that has made our cozy and welcoming home in high-tech , the new hp photosmart c650 is a good example of how to get the best out of it .
while i am writing this , my view of the spiral cable , which is the receiver with the phone , is falling , and i think : boah , like retro is that ?
but there is a thought behind this : if the cable were not , the costs would be reduced in a very short time .
in any case , the vagueness of the ekeltronic ( disgusting ?
no , typos : electronic sector the rule that the world novelty of today is electric scrap of tomorrow , bought - sold out .
and those who still have a tube tv in the living room , for example , are simply saying that they reject television in principle .
why are these considerations ?
because we are not aware of the pressure on ifa at the radio tower this week , we are once again being totally incompetent in matters of electronics .
the layman who used to use washing machines and cd players blindly dominated , now does not even understand the purpose of the devices that are equipped with an incredibly ethereal expert spree in front of him : &quot; connecticut .
yes , it &apos;s still possible ?
what should we talk about with people who seem to be voluntarily extending such quark ?
basically , the issue has been before us for some 20 years , above all , that we are happy to link our house .
to make the yoghurt itself a perfect gift , we have a fire alarm on your vacation in the maldives to tell us that it is in the working room that it is burning .
and would it not be wonderful if we could have the air conditioning from our office on our early arrival ... ?
yes , this does require air conditioning .
but a dream will certainly come true soon : we are raising our arms dealer , say your loud &quot; suck ! &quot; and to the home the dust vacuum robot is going out .
i am wrong .
everything is in the opposite way to a revolution : &apos; the borders between white and brown are not the same as the white goods &apos; .
from daily practice , we also know that if a new fashionable device is really needed urgently , the battery pack is guaranteed to be empty .
another reason for this is that the spiral cable is not available on the phone , even the next radio shows .
israeli children return to gaza after the war .
thousands of israeli children from the areas near the gaza strip are being forced to return home on monday .
the start of the school brought the war , which was waged by rocket launchers , to southern israel ’ s attention , a feeling of joy and expectation , but the signs of fighting are still fresh .
in the southern town of ashdod , employees of the &quot; pashosh &quot; kindergarten , who was attacked by a rocket , were removed from the camp before the arrival of students &apos; splitters from the walls and ceilings .
&quot; we have a little fear , but are excited , &quot; said ronit bart , a resident in kibbutz saad and there english-teacher .
many children in our area urgently need a return to a routine .
her 11-year-old daughter shani bart said that it felt &quot; a bit like cooking &quot; .
&quot; these were difficult times , and we are not out of the house at all , &quot; she said .
president reuven rivlin visited the kibbutz near the border with gaza to see his support .
until a ceasefire ended last week ’ s war , thousands of inhabitants of border communities such as saad remained in their homes , or left their homes to live in safer areas further away from gaza .
many nahal oz residents , a community near the border with gaza , are in a state where a four-year-old boy is threatened by a palestinian mortar grenade .
the ministry of education announced , about a dozen families were not yet back .
their children were temporarily taught in other schools .
prime minister benjamin netanyahu attended a school in sderot , a border town with gaza that was heavily damaged by palestinian shocks .
he called on the children to do a lot of learning and said &apos; we will ensure that their knowledge is acquired and offer you security &apos; .
israel and hamas agreed on a joint resolution last tuesday to establish a permanent ceasefire .
the ceasefire ensured an immediate end to the fighting ; important problems remain unresolved , as the request of hamas for a suspension of the israeli-egyptian blockade of gaza and the reopening of air and sea ports .
israel is calling for hamas to be disarmed and for the bodies of two to be handed over to the israeli army killed during the fighting .
a new round of indirect talks is expected to take place this month in egypt .
in the war , more than 2,100 palestinians were killed , three-quarters of them civilians , and at least 494 children were killed , according to the estimates of the palestinians and the un .
israel denies this information and estimates that it is a minimum of half of the killed victims of the bombing , but it did not provide any concrete evidence of this information .
on the israeli side , 66 soldiers and six civilians , including a thai worker , were killed .
hamas and other fighters in gaza fired 4.591 rallies , and murderers were killed during the fighting .
meanwhile , the israeli military led more than 5,000 air and air strikes to the ground .
the israeli attacks damaged or destroyed the thousands of homes in the gaza area and about 250,000 people in search of land in more than 100 un schools .
while tens of thousands of people continue to live in the protected areas and the fighting continues , the educational authorities have postponed the start of the school year last week .
&quot; i hope the school is soon open again so we can continue learning so as to keep the children in the world and the jewish children , &quot; said mohammad amara , a 13-year-old boy , who is currently in school .
at the choice of saxony : cdu-vize strobl provides npd prohibition procedures in question .
given the loss of votes by the npd in saxony , cdu-bundesvize has called thomas strobl for an end to the current npd prohibition procedure before the federal constitutional court .
berlin - according to cdu-bundesvize thomas strobl , the current prohibition proceedings against the npd should be brought to an end in the federal constitutional court .
&quot; the npd is doing worse than the last time , &quot; said strobl , who also had cdu state secretary in baden württemberg .
this is a welcome development in the right direction and a development that will give me more of a feeling of satisfaction than a result of the political fight against the npd and not the constitutional court .
the npd was not present at the vote on sunday at the five percent hurdle .
a first attempt at banning the extreme right party was in 2003 , when the government of the republic of china also failed in the npd ’ s top .
in december 2013 , the federal council submitted a new application to karlsruhe after long preparation .
the federal government and the bundestag did not join .
harburg : tents for new refugees
the new member states are now being placed in tents .
the central initial reception for refugees in harburg is bursting with water from all seams .
now the home office has three tents of the red cross next to it .
the regional politicians were only recently informed - they are not enthusiastic .
&quot; this backup action further stimulates reservations on the part of the citizens and does not give the local politicians the opportunity to participate constructively in the humane housing of refugees , &quot; says britta herrmann , group leader of the green group .
your party is calling for the district administration of harburg to be able to build houses that are currently unused .
96 refugees can be found in the three tents .
the reason for the overcrowding in the first picture is the rush to help seekers - and the fact that the people in the public authorities are not sufficiently available in subsequent facilities .
many refugees therefore remain longer than the regular three months .
house prices have hit the most powerful winter rise in seven years , showing a widely observed growth in the index .
rp data corelogic hedonic home value is a global index of home ownership in the australian capital , which rose by 1.1 % in august , according to rp data from monday .
this increase in total increases in the number of vehicles in june , july and august is 4.2 percent , the largest increase in the winter months since 2007 .
the annual price increase was $ 10.9 per cent , more than twice as high as the increase in the 12 months to august 2013 , but the increases in the figure were not even over the country .
the research director of rp data , tim lawless , told us that the sydney and melbourne had a two-tier market .
the figures from rp data show that skin care prices in syria are rising in the past year at 16.1 % .
the following markets are adelaide , brisbane and darwin , in which prices are on average five and six percent higher than in the past .
at the other end of the scale is canberra , which is the most affected by cuts in government spending , and where prices have fallen by just 1.4 % over the year .
mr lawless also said that the treaty of spring is now a time for the coming months to bring about an increase in the number of property on sale , which will &apos; open up the market to a real test &apos; .
&quot; if you look at the continuing high rate of auction prices , a generally fast sales price is and the continuing high prices , you will see that the price of the auction is probably the same .
in a statement to the new press , he contradicts statements by managing director peer medau and attestation this , &quot; as a feldherr &quot; .
the style of the college is not this , it says in the communication .
so the medau family was already &quot; mündlich über die ansinnen der hochschule beutet wurde .
the statement that the plans will not be announced until july is definitely wrong , &quot; says poetzl .
at the same time , it points out that the plans are not &apos; preliminary &apos; decisions or even decisions .
the commissioner responsible for access to the narrow road is also responsible for the extension of the narrow road up to the castle , which is less dramatic than the medas fear .
from a nine metre road , it was not and is not mentioned .
the current situation is 5.50 metres , which is a metre wide than before &apos; , explains pötzl .
the argument of the meda operators that their free and educational resources are not available in the future is only used by university students .
the room was very small and the bed was very uncomfortable .
the people living in the vicinity are thinking about the people who live in the area .
the mountain range children ’ s crib , located on the site and in front of the house , offers access to the park deck .
it is more important to remember that &apos; it is not just about the crèche , but also about the people living in the mouth of the friedrich-streib road and the 800 students of the neighbouring realschule .
so we are talking about much more than the interests of the individual members of mr medau , &quot; said pötzl .
whether the criticism of the parental advisory board of the children &apos;s crib , with the extension of the road , would be one of the few uncontaminated spots in coburg &quot; justified , &quot; the reader can decide for himself .
in early october , pötzl and the baumberg state building agency want to introduce the city councils on the development of the construction of the university by 2020 , &quot; and in this context to address the importance of the new development &quot; .
peer medau had a chance to visit the parents of the children &apos;s crib last week about the plans of the university .
the aim is therefore to facilitate access to the new parking deck via the campus and the friedrich-streib street , rather than through the medau mountain .
this would have meant that the narrow road would have to be two-lane on about one kilometre long .
according to estimates by the meda , transport in the park of hohenfels would be ten-fold .
of about 2000 vehicles a day are mentioned .
from the city side , it has not yet been the intention to express an opinion on the project .
glandorf is a member of the handball national team .
holger glandorf will no longer be responsible for the dhb team .
the 31-year-old from the german bundesliga sg flensburg-handewitt was mainly responsible for health problems .
i did not find the decision easy , it was a matter of months .
it is time for me to listen to the signals of my body and to start my career in the national team . &quot;
it is therefore taking stock of 167 country games and 576 goals for germany in the international ruhr .
because the root-and-branch backroom player for the champions league winner is from flensburg still some years on toronto .
the icelanders , who will be taking their cutbacks for the country games against switzerland on tuesday , introduced glandorf as a &quot; long and good conversation .
his ideas and approaches have made me as enthusiastic as they have my long-time fellow players and my successors .
but for my club i would like to be healthy for the next few years , for longer periods of regeneration are needed , the time of the current double load is not allowed .
the left hand had a strong majority in 2012 after a heel infection .
because of achillesian problems , he had moved from team doctors of the german handball federation ( dhb ) to a cortisone injection .
an emergency operation and two other interventions followed .
then glandorf had a complaint against the team doctor who had been involved in the dispute with a comparison .
twelve years of professional and eleven years of national team career are not a matter of track for any body .
i have some health sites that i do not ignore any more .
after three infectious foot surgery , which took place in short periods in 2012 , the european union has been increasing blood pressure .
this is the case with some other wear-related complaints .
the first time i noticed that the commission had been involved in the process of steering my head , but i cannot deceive my body , &quot; explained glandorf in the interview to the magazine &quot; handball time &quot; .
for a comeback , he would only be available in an absolute emergency .
&quot; if all the knitting tears tear , i am always willing to talk , &quot; explained the double family father to the magazine .
however , i cannot accept the years in which i can play handball at one hand .
i must also say that i have been in the hospital for a long time in 2012 , and i have become quite humble as far as my health is concerned .
after my career i would like to at least be able to go somewhat straight .
besides the world championship title 2007 and the winner of the champions league 2014 , he won the 2008 ( hsg nordhorn ) and 2010 ( tbv lemgo ) ehf-cup .
in 2012 , he also secured a contract with flensburg for the european cup of the cup winners .
german economy in the spring by 0.2 % fell by 0.2 % , and the country ’ s economy fell by 0.2 % .
the crises surrounding the globe have made the german economy more competitive in the second quarter .
gross domestic product ( gdp ) fell by 10 % from april to the end of june 2014 compared with the prior quarter .
this was the result of the federal statistical office ’ s announcement and confirmed preliminary results .
consumption alone is a source of income for the economy in the spring , while investment fell .
foreign trade , too , has slowed the economy .
thanks to the strong start of the year , the first six months of the year have seen a total gdp plus of 0.8 % compared to the second half of 2013 .
horstmar was the starting point and goal of the &quot; münsterland-mooiste &quot; , which was first launched on sunday by the burgmannsstadt .
the city of horstmar in burgmannheim experienced an invasion of dutch &quot; feat drivers &quot; on sunday .
the largest cycling association in the netherlands , ntfu , organised the so-called &quot; münsterlande mooiste &quot; .
it is a question of the biggest cycling tour across the coinsterland , the cycling paradise of the nearby mountains .
more than 1000 participants thanked the participants with their registration at jos ter huerne for organizing this tour through the münsterland .
the competition is open to all interested parties in various specialist journals .
we come from the heroes and went overnight to participate in this tour .
we would like to welcome the münsterland in this way , too , &quot; the cyclists were delighted to see the route through the steinfurt , borken and coesfeld districts .
after registration at the club of schützenfraternschaft sta .
katharina went on a small &quot; peace drive &quot; through the city over the wall , where the start was also made .
the route continued , which was planned for three different categories , in the direction of herrenholz over the schöppinger mountain towards coesfeld and via havixbeck and billerbeck back to horstmar .
on routes of 95 kilometres with 1175 metres of altitude , 120 kilometres with 1475 metres of altitude and 145 kilometres with 1775 metres of altitude , cyclists have demonstrated their good condition .
the food was good and the food was good .
the main organizer jos ter huerne and mayor of heinz lölfing were the success of this cycling event .
we are satisfied and it was a nice experience for all concerned .
the organization went without problems and there was no negative incidents &quot; , draws heinz lölfing a positive conclusion .
unfortunately , not so many participants , as the organizer hoped , came what would probably be due to the bad weather forecasts and the mornings .
&quot; we are facing a new challenge in 2015 , hopefully in good weather on 30 august or during another weekend , &quot; the cyclists promised to go back to munich .
constantine wecker &apos;s unscrupulous honest memoirs
it is actually more philosophical testimony than biography , which is constantine wecker , liedermacher , pacifist , politico-safe activist , ex-detainee , in &quot; monk and .
not chronologically , but more thought scraps for thought feeds has the least impact on the political will of the mind-boggling movement born on 1 june 1947 .
and he is gentle honest : from the onanie as a gymnasiast to the laden digging .
also to show how he himself tolerates tolerance in dealing with his fellow human beings .
the wide range of the rooms also includes abstract concepts , but the more important ones are : love , soul , ego , being in the now , spirituality - all of this he tries to grasp , in a very philosophical but also personal way .
and he also explains his pacifism , his social criticism , his political commitment - and also , as he does not just have the music ( the opera &apos;s lover was named soul and rock singer ) .
the latter has the liver constantine wecker also added to the ascetic monk who is &quot; replaced by subtraction &quot; as he says &quot; by being all unnecessarily &quot; away &quot; .
between all the highly spiritual views , there are also short anecdotes to the earth : about sleeping , about a sleeping in a room frequented by gis , or a crazy autotrip , where you can see fronts .
here , too , he is ruthless honest .
lenny henry : my father never put me in the arm .
never said &quot; i love you &quot; , &quot; i love you &quot; , &quot; i love you &quot; .
henry was one of seven children of a family of jamaican immigrants in dudley in the midlands in 1958 .
his father , who died when henry 19 , worked in a factory in which she had a limited relationship .
henry is trying for a comedy , rudy &apos;s rare rehearsals , which are partly based on an imaginary conversation with his father and is released from the series on radio 4 .
the soundtrack is a mixture of reggae and rap , with lively melodies .
but henry had to be replaced by some difficult childhood moments .
he visited &quot; many &quot; therapies after the death of his mother , and henry is thoughtful about his relationship with his father .
it was difficult to know him .
you never saw his face , heard only his voice : &quot; listen to the crash .
let your sister rest in peace .
get away from it !
i will look at cricket .
my older brothers seymour and hilton - who have been grown up before i was a child - went to the kneipe with him and spoke about things like the form of beer glass .
i never had such a conversation with him .
a lot of my life he was this serious guy in the corner , who read the newspaper .
recently opened henry a foundry in dudley , and although the conditions are better than in the days of his father , he won a one-look at how the company &apos;s life was .
it is now slightly brighter , but they are dark , smoked , deep stygic labyrinths with flame strips and smoke and plenty of rush .
my father used to simply put himself in the bath and then he was slowly heard as he was going to sing .
when i was around there , i realized that i had the longstanding experience of doing so .
nevertheless , henry grew up as a child without love testimony from his parents .
my father hugged me never , he never said &quot; i love you &quot; .
only when my mother died at the end of her life , we began to &quot; i love you , i love you , i love you &quot; to say .
with its own daughter , bile , with dawn french , he could share the love he felt as a child .
could you ever start with the &quot; i love you &quot; ?
stop talking to me , i am not going to be a fool !
papa , i am 22 !
with dawn french .
why should we not be friends ?
it is a great mother .
it is still with french befreundet , with whom he spent 25 years in marriage .
dawn is a good person .
why should we not be friends ?
it is a great mother .
henry &apos;s own mother was a diabetic .
this contributed to their death .
so , when i was very , very overweight and had to treat symptoms of diabetes , my doctor said &quot; they must be radical .
so i pulled this fitness and had to take a drastic diet to reduce the symptoms .
it is very difficult .
and it is exhausting .
nobody likes to eat carrots .
henry &apos;s career change may be reflected in his elegant , short-cut bar , which is a popular meeting place for young and old alike .
since he was elected by critics for his othello , he has been a member of the theatre .
the comedy &quot; the irritation &quot; followed , and then fences of august wilson .
this is a different experience from the sitcoms and comedia that have been his busy working life .
he began with only 16 years when he was in a factory .
a dj discovered him on stage when he was playing people and playing music .
his television career began in the mid-1970s . &quot; i was responsible for a fairly long time the only black imitator / comedian on television . &quot;
he learned at work .
i had to face not only the public eye , but also from 1975 to 1985 , as i have seen an efficient joke narrative machine .
lenny 1975 at new faces
because his manager has not yet fully respected the stage law at the black and white minstrel show , a light entertainment law program that was used to make people &quot; black &quot; .
my family was very uncomfortable .
i somehow wish that it never happened , but i am sorry that i am not here .
it was a strange , unpleasant position for me , but i worked on giant projects with and learned how to make a difference with a large audience .
but this &apos; years of award-winning light pillar &apos; of the british television industry was also a &apos; big &apos; .
the introduction of figures , which will be the british black culture both mocked and celebrated , has enabled henry to work in the 1980s on an alternative comedy circle .
the first line of lenny henry show went on broadcast in 1984 , and in the 1990s he was among the chef of garreth blair .
advertising , documentaries , tv series and film rolls have made a name for its next decade , but after its bbc series lennyhenry.tv 2008 he thought : &quot; what can you do as you go next ?
after that , a documentary series for radio 4 , entitled what &apos;s so great about ... ?
the first episode was about shakespeare .
on shakespeare i was really allergic .
i had never really heard about him at school and i thought he was mostly a doctor &apos;s domain .
so i was very afraid of it .
all of us who interviewed for the show , peter hall , trevor nunn , adrian lester , judi dench said &quot; you should do it .
don &apos;t worry if you don &apos;t know what you &apos;re talking about .
take a few of the words in your mouth , and then you will understand why we all have shakespeare so love .
henry led 20 lines from othellen last speech for the documentary and he was enthusiastic .
i felt that i was doing what i could .
it was almost as if someone had finally turned my head up properly .
&quot; that &apos;s what it is all about , it &apos;s a serious thing to take you seriously , get your text , search a little bit .
the samples were brutal , and i read this piece for months before we did it .
and it was a success .
they seemed to have a car accident to expect , and that simply did not happen .
and soon he joined the comedy of the fallacies .
suddenly i was in the national theatre and i could hardly believe it .
there was a moment when i thought that &quot; oh , you have not changed . &quot;
there was a technical error and henry felt instinctive that he could unwind the audience .
&quot; a little voice told me &quot; you have to go over 10 minutes while you are on the computer . &quot;
instead , the stage director , the author of the idea , announced that the idea would go ahead as soon as the problem was resolved .
i went from the stage and something was in me said &quot; oh , god be thankful &quot; .
i am not responsible for this .
i can leave that to someone else .
&quot; you play in a play , so stay in your role . &quot;
henry in fences at the duchess theatre , the royal palace , the royal palace and the royal palace .
the text for fences was demanding .
panic is very good , it strengthens the longings .
that was also good , so it is like a big sign of the gods that tell me &quot; that here is your destiny . &quot;
he says this , of course , with a thundering voice .
so i stand by it .
i really love that .
i love to live in a sample room .
henry , however , still has the head of a comedian - our conversation is about humorous outbursts , while he repeatedly imitates people .
i have decided not to take stand-up comedy , because i find that it is a very important way of satisfying the situation immediately from a room full of strangers .
if you look at it all the time , you are driving in front of a wall .
i sometimes come to the apollo live , when i feel like i am , but overall there is not so much as i did before .
i ask him if he ever has a stand-up comedy tour again .
the fun i had in a room with a director is that i am not so happy with the beginning , the middle part and the end of a trip - i do not think i am ever going to give up .
is that what he is doing here ?
i think so .
i am a great actor .
it is fun .
you always tell a story , and that is great .
i love stories .
people love stories .
huthi-rebels are blocking streets in yemen ’ s capital city , yemen , the capital , and the capital of yemen .
in the conflict between shia huthi rebels and yemeni ’ s government , the huthi have become civilian disobedience in the capital , sanaa .
huthi supporters could have seen central streets in sanaa on monday , said a spokesman of the huthi party &quot; ansar allah &quot; .
the access to parliament is also blocked .
yemeni media report a traffic mess in the capital .
according to the online edition of the newspaper &quot; yemen post &quot; , huthy leader abdulmalik al-huthi had a meeting with the commission on sunday evening .
huthi threatened to be the first to be elected , according to the sheet , with the conflict escalating further if his demands were not met .
the shia huthi people are fighting for greater independence from the sunni regime in yemen and are calling for the government to resign .
the people of huthi are now besieging the yemeni capital for just under two weeks .
about 30,000 rebels have camps in the large access areas of the island of sanaa .
the area is full of flowers and the surrounding area is full of bloody battles with the yemeni army .
kenya registers officials to &quot; ghost workers &quot; and to protect the children of the roma .
kenya has begun to recruit all civil servants biometrically to be &quot; ghost workers &quot; from the salaries lists of the government .
employees who have been in the company for the next two weeks would not be paid more , was a government statement .
the government suspects that thousands of people will be killed after they leave the public service , even after they leave .
president uhuru kenyatta promised to make a commitment to the fight against public corruption when he took office in 2013 .
when examining the situation at the beginning of this year , it was found that at least 1 million $ ( 700,000 ) per month in payments for ghost workers and other abusive financial practices were lost .
the government suspects that salaries will continue to be paid on accounts after a person has died .
all officials must now be able to obtain a certificate of authenticity in the next two weeks to ensure that their data on the biometric registrations are received in a government message .
all those who do not do so without a credible apology would be hit by the pay list , but the announcement was continued .
&quot; this approach will make a significant contribution to rationalising public service by reducing the actual number of officials and also by reducing the pay list on both levels of government .
the scandal surrounding the art adviser helge achenbach will be brought to trial on 11 november .
five heirs of berthold albrecht , son of aldi founder theo albrecht , demand a new life in a civil trial at the düsseldorf district court . 19.4 million euro compensation from achenbach and two of his companies .
this was a court ruling that was issued on monday .
in the complaint , it is said that achenbach had a lot of money in buying works of art and classic cars and that berthold albrecht had paid more than the actual purchase prices .
this also meant that the agreed commission was higher .
achenbach has spent eur 121 million on precious objects for albrecht .
children need roots and wings
he was the director of the school for 44 years , 23 of which were the school director .
from this time manfred richter knows many staged petershausen and kollbacher from their time as a student .
his methods were sometimes unconventional , but always carried by his desire to be the pupil of the people .
the snow-capped mountain is the most famous mountain in the giant mountains .
manfred richter loves the painting with the motif from his home country .
judge was arrested in 1930 in trautenau / northern bohemia , today trutnov .
he was already interested in the project after four years at the school of higher education .
one year later , the sudeten germans were taken away from the country .
within half an hour , the family had to leave their homes .
after a few months in a camp , the road went to bavaria in 1946 - in the wagon .
so it was judges in the oberfranken senkendorf .
teacher training took place in bamberg .
manfred richter had to be ten kilometres in the next train station six times a week , by train to bamberg , and three kilometres in the distance of the city to school and back in the evening .
after two months , manfred richter received a red cross home in bamberg to sleep : together with up to 15 co-shakers in a sleeping room .
in 1951 he made the first and in 1954 after three years of lehramtsang graduate with the second state exam .
since oberfranken is not a free teacher &apos;s place for him , he applied for upper bavaria and came to berlin on november 1 , 1954 .
the &quot; fräulein room &quot; was his first &quot; serviced apartment &quot; in the school building .
in 1958 he moved to the new building of the teacher &apos;s house next to the school and a three-room serviced apartment .
this house bought manfred richter in 1980 , after the school in kollbach was dissolved in 1968 .
until then , there were no more than 100 children in kollbach in the petershausen-kollbach school association and five in petershausen .
from the school year 1968 / 69 these were published in petershausen in the current town hall .
when the school association indersdorf was founded , only the basic school remained in the village .
to avoid a downgrade in the now smaller school , the school moved to the new school .
petershausen grew , however , and so the children and their teachers could learn the modern construction from september 1982 , which was opened in 1997 after judge retirement .
manfred richter commends the uncomplicated generosity of the then mayor ludwig götz , who was also responsible for building a workshop and enlargement in 1997 .
&quot; mayor götz was very school-friendly &quot; , judge thanked .
in his entire career , manfred richter never heard the speech of a government representative who was waiting for a lecture from a school council on justice and justice : &quot; one cannot ever forget the love &quot; .
&quot; we must offer children two things : roots and wings &quot; , says the current 84-year-old .
and he had to learn : &quot; this doesn &apos;t always work &quot; , whether he only met his students or his own six children , is not quite clear .
in any case , judges were sometimes unconventional .
if students have checked , they were given no information from him .
at the community &apos;s expense , judges had two pairs of boxing gloves and let the two opponents compete against each other , even if there was a veil .
for the good of the school , judges used to have a good relationship with the then mayor ludwig götz ( csu ) .
this moved the partisan judge to the court of appeals in 1996 , at least as the last on the csu list .
but judges were selected for sixth place and joined the csu .
180 km in three days
hr4-cycling 700 bicycle riders will be able to enjoy the beauty of the salzhausen spa park and the schotten stopovers .
if cyclists are on their tour in bad salzhausen or schotten , that is not something special in itself .
on friday , however , the number of people who are still in the mood , alone , made the impression : the 700 participants of the hr4 cycle tour together with the accompanying tross enjoyed a break in the lower spa park of bad salzburg and later a party under the skies .
under the motto &quot; cycling and celebrating on newly discovered paths between nidda and kineg &quot; , participants had a chance to meet in bad vilbel on thursday and to hear a concert by van baker &amp; band .
on friday , it was serious : the cyclists took the first stage , which is 60 kilometres over florstadt to bad salzhausen and further to schotten .
in bad salzhausen , athletes were invited by mayor hans-peter seum , who was awarded the bicycle in bad vilbel .
for refreshment of body and mind , all the good things had been prepared : the women of the ranstadt and nieder-mockstadt had 85 sheets of apple , for the purpose of stretching , spreading and drying .
&quot; such cakes can only bake farmwomen , &quot; praised a participant from aulendiebach , while he ordered another piece of cake .
the hotel is situated in the centre of the city , in the centre of the city , near the famous &quot; süß-nidda &quot; .
the &quot; duo bravo &quot; entertained the visitors with famous melodies from operettas and musicals and harvested enthusiastic applause .
the beautiful ambience of the park was relaxing .
a lord also enjoyed a head massage from his partner : &quot; the woman has earned , after all , he has already dropped off driving bikes .
meanwhile , the mayor and the manager of the company had to work : they were placed at the well in front of the drinking cure house of reporter rainer janke and used the tools to get a good impression on the radio for bad salzhausen .
the most important thing is that you can find the right place for your project .
his pickup truck , where he was able to take over the radio via three telephones and a radio station with his staff and the 15-member motorcycle season of the police hessen , was facebook entries .
&quot; most of the participants come from the rhein-main region &quot; , he told us that &quot; but also from gießen or fulda , from lauterbach or the taunus and even from numerous cities in west fulal .
the number of participants is a bit based on the available overnight capacity .
in category i , the participants are accommodated in hotels , in category ii in group accommodation .
from the spa , the cyclists had a good impression of being able to restart after one and a half hours : &quot; büss ! &quot;
&quot; it was beautiful in bad salzhausen ! &quot; they waved to farewell .
after arriving in scotland , the group was allowed to take a short break in the snowfall .
but in the evening the cyclists were in the idyllic alteburgpark .
the film is directed by scottish society for tourism and city marketing ( gts ) .
mayor susanne schaab , gts managing director markus hoßfeld and msc-chairman wolfgang wagner-sachs , as chairman of the adac head office .
the three showed themselves to be obviously pleased with the &quot; many farm in scotland &quot; .
dj tobias hagen then announced the dance stage .
the opportunity to move around freely is not missed despite the sports activities .
among the guests were increasingly citizens who were affected by the good mood as well as the great crowd of cyclists .
the second day was the first time that the bikers had to leave the stations of birstein , wächtersbach and bad orb , including a concert with trenkwalders .
yesterday , after 180 kilometres cycling , tramway racers met again in bad vilbel .
dozens of turkish police officers have been arrested for &quot; conspiracy &quot; against the government .
33 police officers were arrested in turkey due to suspicion of &quot; conspiracy against the government &quot; .
the police authorities did not make immediate comments .
among the detainees , 14 senior police officers , reported that hurricane mitch , and the police were in charge of the prison .
some of them were involved in corruption investigations against government officials , including four government ministers last december .
in july , a number of turkish police were arrested for having allegedly carried out organised criminal activity .
the turkish president recep tayyip erdogan ( the then prime minister ) decided to change the way they did as part of the activities that the islamist clergy fethulla had directed against him and other people .
not all children in ukraine are returning to school .
schools in almost all ukraine opened on monday ( september 1 ) after the summer holidays .
this day is traditionally an important day for families , and like thousands of other ukrainian parents , prime minister arsenij jazenjuk brought his daughter to school .
he told waiting journalists that he had not been able to open all schools , that he had decided to open the country for future generations .
the september celebrations were not held in every school .
the sky is not always peaceful across ukraine .
we must ensure that the sky is peaceful .
the entire ukraine , a huge common ukrainian people &apos;s front , must be open to a peaceful sky .
aleksan pastukhow , school leader of the school in slavjansk , the jazenjuk daughter visited , spoke in russian .
we hope that this will finally be a peaceful one and that children will be given an education that will be useful in the future .
the first day of the new school year is traditionally celebrated , with children being bribed and stitched .
with rona fairhead , bbc has perhaps won the great director , who she needs .
it meets with a proud glory tow from the banking world , the media management and the inner circle of tory party .
and it has its own front-line experience .
her career began at the global management consultancy bain and co . , which she has been waiting for to become morgan stanley , bombadier , ici and the media world of pearsons .
she has been a member of the board of directors of the financial times for seven years , and has resigned as the chief post of the parent company pearson to a younger male colleague .
your compensation was supposedly nearly £ 1 million .
their political ranking is also solid .
she was appointed david cameron by lord brown , the former chairman of bp , when he was appointed to the board of directors after more private knowledge of whitehall : she was appointed advisor of the cabinet .
her husband is a former tory member of the council .
as early as may , i described the role of the chairman with a poisoned cellar .
not only is the bbc a huge and complex entity at the heart of public life , but there is also an internal paradox in its structure .
confidence has two directions : inward , towards the first guard of its own management hierarchy in bbc , but also towards the outside as a voice of public concern and unrest when things go wrong .
this provides an almost unsustainable duopoly that is being played after a complete reform .
but what new president would it be risky to start ?
it is a difficult task .
and as if that were not enough , many are still interested in keeping the bbc down .
while the competition is getting closer and new technologies are changing old , comfortable collateral , the annuity of the upcoming negotiation of the license fees for the bbc is associated with particular dangers .
for the modest sum of eur 145.50 per year , the british public is buying up what is surely the world ’ s largest media company .
the bbc tells a good story : it says that it has 96 % of all households and only 40 pence per day .
and it seems that the bbc is on the popularity scale .
the visual and usage habits for bbc have changed .
but it remains a very beloved and significant institution .
it needs a considerable chairman - i hope you have taken him .
perry from texas says that downgrading tweet is not authorized .
a tweet from the republican governor &apos;s official account is used to create a tweet .
the tweet was deleted later and replaced by another one by perry &apos;s account , which was the previous shutdown .
just a tweet from my account is sent out , which is not from me authorized .
&quot; i approve the tweet and have deleted it , &quot; hießes in der nächsten nachfolge .
perry staff did not answer questions immediately .
although the tweets of perry ’ s official account were out of date , it was not clear who actually signed up for the feed .
in the former tweet an unfavorable picture of the district council of the state of travis county , rosemary lehmberg was drawn , which was published in april 2013 due to drunkenness at the wheel .
perry put a veto on financial support for her office when she was refusing to grant resignation , leading to a charge of her own personal rights .
the text of the tweets is : &apos; i am not always drunk with the triple acceptable alcohol level &apos; . but if i do , i am not complaining .
i am the drunk democrat in texas .
lehmberg ’ s office was not connected with the management of the grand jury ’ s investigation of perry .
this was done by michael mccrum , a special prosecutor from san antonio who was elected by a republican judge .
perry argues for not guilty and called the prosecutor a political tribunal .
his highly classical team of legal assistants requested a special status in the case of the judge who was charged .
perry stopped 7.5 million $ of government money to the public integrity foundation .
this veto has provided a public complaint from a left-wing wateur to the commission .
perry &apos;s official user account is frequently updated - and sometimes famous .
after winning the election , he was elected to the iowa election campaign during his presidential candidacy in 2012 , and perry went on to speculate that he would stop .
berkeley explains housing market again for &quot; normal &quot; housing .
one of the most prominent builders in london &apos;s history pointed out that the building owner was the owner of the housing market in the south-east of england .
home in the capital were hot and the city was the subject of huge price increases .
tony pidgley , founder and ceo of the high-class bauhaus company berkeley , said on monday : &quot; since the beginning of the current financial year , the market has been reoriented to normal transaction levels since the peak of 2013 .
the real estate market in london was a key factor during the downturn , as foreign buyers pushed into the capital .
according to the cadastre , the prices in the urban area have fallen by a quarter of the same as last year alone , far more than the average increase in england and wales as a whole .
the average selling prices at berkeley ’ s private , cheap and student offers rose by about a fifth , compared to the same period last year , at the end of april , around £ 423,000 .
a stronger pound , however , has created real estate ownership in london in recent months for foreign buyers - some of them are also affected by the introduction of new property taxes and political rhetoric to create a possible &quot; villas tax &quot; before the general may .
the london immobilienbroker foxton warned in the past week that the mortgage market price report for april , in which weak interest rates were applied , was a good one .
new data from the bank of england on monday show a decline in mortgage lending in july , which also indicates that the current situation is not improving .
hamptions international , another real estate agency , corrected its prediction for the increase in real estate prices in london for 2015 to 3 % , on the basis of a already weaker market .
the volume of transactions in the most expensive areas of london , such as chelsea , mayfair and kensington , has now increased by a quarter year , so the magnet broker wa elis .
nevertheless , the desire for a home in the capital is not a good thing for berkeley , as the sums due for sales in the futures market are more than £ 2.2 billion .
mr pidgley added : &apos; the demand for the right , well-planned product to the best locations in bregenz remained stable and as a result the sales of the terminals remained stable . &apos;
in june , the company reported that it had 3742 new homes in the year up to the end of april - almost a third more than at the peak in 2007 before the crisis .
the annual deduction from the tax income rose by 40 % to £ 280 million annually , and sales rose by 18 % to £ 1.6 billion .
in a communication on monday before the company &apos;s annual meeting , mr pidgley said that revenues for berkeley will be expected to reach the current market share of the current year .
the analysts agree that the annual management of the pre-tax income is eur 450 million .
berkeley ’ s shares were in london ’ s trade in the afternoon , at £ 23.96 .
nude photos from jennifer lawrence through hacker on the internet published on the internet .
jennifer lawrence performance at the 85th oscarverläuhung .
nude photos of the oscar winner jennifer lavrence were taken online by a hacker who claimed that the flickr &apos;s &quot; master list &quot; was a collection of pictures of 100 more starlets .
a star from &quot; the tributes of panem &quot; confirmed the event , which was a great success .
the authorities were notified and will follow all those who took the stolen photos of that person .
the photos originally published on the photo sharing page 4chan are now available in the pdf format .
it is not certain how many of the images are real , although winstead , star from &quot; scott pilgrim against the rest of the world &quot; on twitter also condemned the hack .
&quot; to those of you who look at photos that my husband and i took years ago in the private environment of our house - i hope you are really satisfied with you &quot; , he wrote .
victoria justice from the nickolodeon series &quot; icarly &quot; and &quot; victoria &quot; are available in the following categories : &quot; the best &quot; and &quot; the best &quot; .
let us fight against the beginnings .
buzzfeed reported on the late sunday , that a speaker was speaking of popstars ariana grande , the real thing about the alleged photos of her abstinence .
exclusive excerpt from howard jacobson ’ s highly acclaimed new novel on love and the letter “ j ” .
they disintegrated , so it was best described .
occasionally a woman told him that he was too serious , exhausting , intensive , distanced and perhaps scratched .
and shake him the hand .
scratch brush he knew .
he was stachean , as in igel , yes .
the last victim of this state of affairs was a straight starting affair , which was promising .
ailin solomons was a trembling tender beauty with untamed hair .
it was accompanied by an older companion to the south , who was a kevern for her aunt , and who had a plot in a damp but paradisiacal valley , with the name paradise valley .
for several years , no one had lived in the house .
the pipes were leak , in the bathrooms were still spinning , naked neck necks had their traces on all windows and believed that they were owned by the same thing , and the garden was covered with uncrumbs .
it was like the house from a children &apos;s fairy tale , both threatening and tempting , a garden full of secrets .
portrait of the author : howard jacobson , whose novel &quot; j &quot; was published at the longlist for which man booker price 2014 .
the shortlist is displayed in the next week .
kevern had worked with ailin to keep the cerebral market broken .
your feet are too big .
due to their inherent aggressiveness , songs of this kind were no longer played on the console .
not forbidden - nothing was so forbidden - simply not played .
it was successfully obsolete , as the word obsolete .
the general taste of what has been done has never been achieved , and how the people have worked in books .
in the euphoria of the day , kevern began an imaginary piano to play and in a grob-funny serenade ailinns large feet to sing .
ailin did not understand that .
&quot; this was a well-known song of a jazz pianist called fats waller , &quot; he explained to her and automatically put two fingers on his lips .
his father had always done to change the letter j .
it had been a game between him and his father when he was still small .
his father had it with his own father , so he had told .
if you want to add a word to a j without having to use two fingers over your lips , it costs you a penny .
it was not a very funny game at that time , and it was not very funny now either .
he knew that this was not expected of him , that was all .
it had to explain what jazz was .
ailin had never heard of anyone .
jazz was also used , even if it was not directly prohibited .
improvisation was no longer modern .
it was only room for a single &quot; if &quot; in life .
people wanted to be heard at the beginning of a melody , where they would end .
so is the mind .
his unpredictability made people nervous .
and jazz was musically expressive , and the music was not so much a matter of time .
although he became 10 years old , without being contacted by sammy davis junior , he knew that kevern had something to say about jazz from the semi-secret collection of old cds of his father .
but at least he had to stop ailin explaining that fats whaller was black .
in her age she could probably not remember a time when she was a pop singer .
again , no laws or constraints were applied .
a conformance society meant that every element of this society was grateful to the principle of group talent - thankfully as the destiny spared .
people with afro-caribbean origin were affected by temperament and body construction for entertainment and sport .
people who were originally from the indian subcontinent were like the indian people with electronics .
what remains of the polish community is a concern of the polish government .
those from the gulf states and the levante , whose grandparents did not leave the country quickly than what had happened when it happened , were not able to do so , for fear of firefighting .
each according to his or her abilities .
as they are only heard of ballad , it was elin difficult to understand how the insults were being used in the words that kevern just sent her .
music was an expression of love .
&quot; they are not really offensive , &quot; said kevern .
except perhaps for people whose feet are too big .
my father never met anyone who was offended , but he loved this song .
he talked too much , but the neglected garden gave him the tricky feeling of security .
nothing could be better for the sound insulation of the huge coal leaves .
ailin still did not understand .
why would your father love something like this ?
he wanted to say that it was a jux , but hesitated to be in your presence again two fingers to the lips .
she thought anyway , that the only thing she could do was to be a little strange .
&quot; it seemed fun to him , &quot; he said instead .
she shaken disbelief and was not able to see the keverns view .
there were many people around the world who saw their uncheered life as a result of their own rabies .
there was nothing he would have wanted to see .
&quot; if you say it , &quot; do you mean without conviction .
but that does not explain yet why you are saying it to me .
she seemed to be honest .
are my feet too big ?
he looked again .
your feet are not so direct .
maybe your ankles , a little bit ...
and thou sayest that thou hate me , because my ankles are too thick ?
hate you ?
of course , i hate you not .
that is just the stupid song .
he could have said &quot; i love you &quot; , but it was too early for that .
&quot; your thick ankles are exactly the reason you tell me what you like , &quot; i tried to do it instead .
i am a little perverse .
this did not sound right .
it was funny .
if he tried to make comic , he brought himself to the trouble of many , because he was not familiar with the calming charm like his father , which he needed to be the one in jokes .
perhaps his father also wanted to be cruel .
perhaps he wanted to make a secret of this .
despite his kind eyes .
ailin solomons was red and raised in the form of her deck .
holunderflüder wine , so drunkenness was no excuse for him .
in their excitement , they seemed to tremble as palmwedel did in storm .
&quot; and your thick head is precisely the reason why i perverse to you .
besides that i didn &apos;t like that .
she was sorry for him , both because of the unnecessary kindness of his words and the fear that has arisen in her eyes when she turned against him .
thought she would be suggesting it ?
she did not tell him about life on the cold northern archipelago .
the same huge and ice-cold ocean broke out here as there on the shore .
the same confusion of men with even more thick skin and confused hair .
thick head ?
they would have been a big fist to her if she had not been fit !
she only crumbs - knutschen was the most used word for a erotic anxiety .
after kevern ’ s view , this was an unnecessary refinement , because the crunch itself was an act of violence .
ailin solomons gave him through her body a sign to go .
he was raised from the deck of the chair like an old man .
she also felt like staying , but the strength of his mourning surprised her .
that was not the end of the world .
they knew little about it .
she saw him as he was moving away - as was the case with a room on the upper floor her companion stood by him - a man who complained about something he himself was doing .
adam leaves the garden , thought she .
she felt a sudden pain for him and men in general , although some had their hands raised against them .
a man turned away from her , his back prayed , damaged her , beaten and killed her without fighting spirit - why was it a sign of her being in good hands ?
when she was alone again , ailin solomons looked at her feet .
several years before the stories we just told , he worked with nussbaum , a smart , and enthusiastic community of 32 years of research in the field of ofnow .
&quot; a lot has been done and much still remains to be done , &quot; she wrote , &quot; to the innate aggressiveness of a people , which is a thousand wars and which most of them won , especially in the united states .
but some features are inescapable , and the fact that they are not extinct is a sign of the fact that they are not .
the higher the church tower , it seems , the lower the passion for the church .
the population is crying sentimental balladen , robbing itself of stories about overwounded difficulties , and claiming to be firmly committed to the virtues of marriage and family life , but still not only the former .
&quot; they have an unfortunate tendency to exaggerate , &quot; said their mentor , when he was reading the whole report .
i propose that you should be less novels .
esme nussbaum lowered her head .
i must also ask : are you atheist ?
&quot; i think i don &apos;t have to say that &quot; answered esme nussbaum .
are you lesbian ?
again , esme reported on her right to privacy and refused to accept the statement .
feminist ?
silence again .
&quot; i don &apos;t ask that , &quot; said luther rabinowitz , &quot; because i am against atheism , lesbentum , or feminism .
this is an prejudice free job .
we are serving prejudice free society .
but certain types of hypersensitivity that are in itself totally acceptable and commendable can be considered occasionally results , as they have presented .
you yourself have obviously expressed prejudices against the church , and these things you call &apos; disproportionate &apos; and &apos; raw &apos; are not acceptable to others as well as to the expression of a natural strength and vitality .
if you continue to walk around , what happens is not the case .
esme nussbaum looked around while rabinowitz spoke .
behind his head , a led letter repeated in flamingorosa the advice that ofnow gave to the country in the last quarter century or longer .
smile on your neighbour , value your partner , listen to balloons , visit music clubs and enjoy the best of your time , talk , explain your ideas and listen to your friends .
speaking is better than silence , the common word is better than the word written .
&quot; i understand absolutely what you want to go out , &quot; esme nussbaum replied with a quiet voice when she was sure that her superior would end up speaking , &quot; and i say nothing else , than that we are .
my concern is that without prewarning , we may not be able to find out how we can repeat the mistakes that were made at all about what happened when it happened .
this time , however , it is not the others that we are trying to share our anger and mistrust .
luther rabinowitz formed a pyramid with his hands .
in order to achieve an engel patience .
&quot; they go too far , &quot; he said , &quot; if they act as &quot; mistake &quot; , which our grandparents might or may not have committed .
they also go too far if they say that this is their &quot; anger &quot; and their &quot; mistrust &quot; of &quot; others &quot; .
it should not be necessary to tell someone in your position that you are not in the process of understanding the past , as in the case of protecting the present , of &apos; us &apos; and &apos; others &apos; .
there was no &apos; we &apos; and there were no &apos; others &apos; .
it was a time of disorder , that is all we know .
&quot; of that if we honestly to ourselves , &quot; dared esme to throw &quot; no part of society can claim to be good .
i am not complaining to anyone .
whether it is bad or good , what has happened has happened .
that was then .
nothing more needs to be said about this - we are in agreement on that .
and just like no blame must be assigned , so no blame must be paid .
but what is the point of the past if we do not learn from it - and i am not saying this - if we do not learn from it - what is to be done - if we do not learn from it - what is to be done ?
the past serves to make us forget them .
if i may say something about this - and i am not going to repeat what i said - i would like to make a comment on it , as mr poettering has already said - i would like to make a comment on this point .
luther rabinowitz left his pyramid collapsed .
&quot; i will take your report on board , &quot; he said and dismissed it .
the next day , when you were ready to work as usual , it was taken by a motorcyclist who , like passers-by , was in a kind of &apos; brutal rage &apos; on the way .
coincidence exists .
lesotho &apos;s military member says that no coup d &apos;état is planned ; prime minister remains in south africa ; prime minister remains in south africa .
military officials in lesotho disputed the need to establish a coup d &apos;état to overturn the government , saying that they were against policemen who had been denied the armament of political fanatics .
prime minister thomas thabane fled the country and said that the army of the country had lost his office .
the premier brought his family to the adjacent south africa after being attacked by the threat of attacks .
military spokesmen major ntelele ntoi said that there is de facto no coup d &apos;état , but that the military responded to the threat of &quot; political fanatics &quot; whose occupation is still unarmed .
&quot; what happened this morning was that the staff of defence forces of lesotho acted , after he had sent several intelligence reports .
the south african government spokesman clayson monyela said that the military action has the impression of a coup .
&quot; even if no one has claimed that the government was torn down by violence , everyone &apos;s reports are agreed that the activities of the defence forces of lesotho have so far shown signs of a coup d &apos;état .
the military spokesman of lesotho announced on sunday that the soldiers would be in their barracks .
in the meantime , the vice-president mothley will take over the management of the company during thabanes ’ absence .
thabane announced that he believed that he was in prison for trying to get rid of corruption in the country .
in lesotho , there have been great tensions since june , following the fact that thabane parliamentary sittings suspended due to the disputes in his unity government .
he said that his actions had not undermined the government , that other accusations had been made .
production in the eurozone on a 13-month low
the increase in production in the eurozone slowed by a quarter of the year in august , and the growth in the eurozone was precisely the same .
the final marker purchasing manager index of the producer &apos;s trade ( pmi ) will fall to the bottom of 50.7 in august , after a booth of 51.8 in july .
a 50 or more indicates an expansion .
new orders have been received and factories have been hit by a period of rising tension between the eu and russia over ukraine .
the figures are not available before the meeting of the european central bank ( ecb ) on thursday .
the markets expect the bank to draw up a clear plan for dealing with a reluctant recovery in the eurozone , and for the impending deflation at an inflation rate of only 0.3 % .
there is speculation that the head of the ecb , mario draghi , will be in the process of providing further information this week as to whether he will be able to make a quantitative easing for the eurozone , in line with that of the united kingdom .
&quot; although small growth is better than no growth at all , the brakes on growth are the most important factor in the economic and geopolitical uncertainties facing manufacturers , &quot; said rob dobson , managing economist at markit .
the factory pmi for germany , the largest trading partner in russia in the eu , fell to the lowest level in 11 months with 51.4 .
in the meantime , the second half of the world ’ s economy fell by the time the pmi was built , france dropped to 46.9 .
france remains a troublesome child , as is italy ’ s decline from a solid expansion to stagnation .
evidence that growth rates are higher in the key index than in the us and the us .
the decline in industry probably fuels the fire of analysts who want to avoid further monetary or fiscal stimulus .
one positive news came from the republic of ireland , where the pmi was rising to 57.3 , the highest level since the end of 1999 .
howard archer , chief economist at ihs global insight , has said : &quot; the best thing that can be done for purchasing management is to buy a product .
he added : &apos; producers in the eurozone find life difficult at the moment , obviously , because the current elevated geopolitical tensions - especially with regard to russia and ukraine - are creating uncertainty in the still difficult conditions in many countries .
these increased uncertainties have clearly made the economy more vulnerable , especially in the case of consumer confidence , and presumably lead to the delay in some orders or even to the cancellation of large orders , in particular large orders .
he said that there is &apos; more and more likely &apos; that the ecb will eventually become a kind of qe that is &apos; although we suspect that this is limited &apos; .
the hell decade of the survivors of beslan : ten years have passed since the terrible siege of the school , as the people who were trapped there are still suffering .
ten years ago , more than 1 000 people were killed by chechen militias in a school in beslan in southern sudan .
more than 330 people , more than half of them children , were killed in the three-day martyrium that shocked the world .
we are in beslan and we will be back to help find some of the victims who have died in the atrocities in the classroom .
exactly a decade after the appalling siege of the school of beslan , where 334 people were killed , including 186 children , the police warned the heroic survivors last night of a new apocalypse .
as fanatical islamist terrorists , children and parents were killed on 1 september 2004 , the start of a new school year , and killed , a few months ago , like the most evil one .
the tragedy united west and east in abhorrence , and it transformed the west into a more surprising , more violent act and hope .
ten years later , we moved back to beslan to meet some of the victims who were victims of death in the atrocities in the classroom .
we found surprising young people who were resisting , who were still remembered these terrorist cessation .
their greatest hope ?
the fact that the war that has now struck ukraine - and in which children like them die - is now coming to an end .
the girl who tried to shoot , in the ceremony , was shot in the shattered school sports hall .
it was founded by the russian star photographer dimitri beliakov and famous for being a mere reference .
it is quite confusing to look for her mother larissa , now 40 years old .
both were held dead , but they survived .
&quot; a woman told me i should be concerned about my life , but i could not , &quot; said aida at the time .
my legs were bloodfilled .
i stood up and climbed back into the mountain to get to my mother .
a soldier brought them to safety .
after a series of operations she decided to stay completely healed , but said yesterday : &quot; three months ago , the pain returned .
i fear that i will be operating again .
some pit splitters are still in my knee .
its aim is to help dentists who have been diagnosed with dentistry and have been treated with care .
&quot; this tragedy changed my life , but it made me not broken .
&quot; this happened to me , and you cannot change it .
once a year i go to the sports hall to meet the people who are here .
my friends and i try to be unhappy about it on other days .
the pain is too great .
my best friend and future class mates are the dzera gapieva .
we played together when we were small , and dreamed of being together to school .
&quot; i don &apos;t want to marry until i finish my studies and start my career .
i am thinking of a family later .
she says that the siege is always a part of it , although the memory is something weak every year .
i am glad that many people around the world are still reminding themselves of our horrors and we are so grateful for the help we have received from people in britain and everywhere .
when i upload the photo online from me , how i can climb back to school , i think that many people will see it for the first time , understand our catastrophe and help not to do it again .
the boy who was shot by the ball hagel in the opinion that his mother was dead was dead .
it was his first day of school ( russians go to school at the age of 7 ) and survived the three-day siege in the poor of his mother tamara .
as a seven-year-old he said : &apos; mama told me that i should lie down when there is an explosion , and her hand should hold . &apos;
after an explosion he thought she would die .
she said to him : &quot; run . &quot;
they are afraid that they can be dead , fled and saw on the way a weeping infant , took it to their hands and fled through a ballhagel .
his father vladimir , who was able to put his son out into the arms , said : &apos; damir told me that his mother had died .
he said : &apos; i could not save them . &apos;
in reality , tamara was outside and was not able to get into the hospital with leg injuries , in turn assuming that her son had died .
after their reunification , she said : &quot; i wept for joy .
i could not believe it .
he ran in and hugged the people .
damir was later fled to london ( from the now dissolved newspaper news of the world ) to be taken from the then premier tony blair and his wife cherie to the title of a barnardo &apos;s children &apos;s .
&quot; this horror is following you every day , but i wish i could with the remembrance , &quot; he said yesterday .
but i can say that in my memory , it is more palatable .
i still know that i will be able to buy all my toys immediately after that .
but now i can play computer games with shots and that &apos;s for me no problem .
&quot; i am not afraid to go to the sports hall , but i think not about me .
i remember this children , with whom i spoke in the court , and the children who did not go out .
we never say that they have been killed or killed .
we say that they are not allowed to stay in the sports hall .
i remember very well my trip to london , especially the united states toy store , where i bought everything .
but now he is afraid of place like ukraine , where wars are the kind of disaster that is caused by him and his friends .
this horror is following you every day , but i wish i could stop , i could stop reminding you of it .
&quot; i am so sorry for all those who are suffering the horrors , &quot; said damir , who last week was volunteering in a monastery .
i am happy to help .
i will one day go to the police and hope that you will be able to attend the school next year .
his mother tamara , 48 , said : &quot; 37 children from our neighbourhood were killed .
i remember the terrible tragedy of the silence following the siege , there were simply no children who were calling and shouting , and these silent people were taking many months to get there .
it remembers vividly the journey to london with damir .
the people of london wept when i learned our history .
i understood then how people around the world would think of our feelings .
she was cherie blair and her foundation grateful for the price and the opportunity to travel to london in autumn 2004 .
i wish i could cherie call and just give her a call and say that 10 years have passed , but i still remember the meeting i had with her and her husband in london , and how the damir and myself helped .
i remember when the first woman in the street was born in borschtsch and she was a friend of all the local russian restaurants .
i remember how he was working with cellars in a restaurant , and damir shot with his water pistol on them and they ran away .
and that was just one month after the horror .
i was surprised that the british were so willing to accept our pain .
she said : &apos; i always think that this world has been unbearable in these 10 years .
in ukraine , the war is now continuing , and every day people die , and i believe that many children have been killed and are still being killed .
these are exactly the children like ours .
i think that for many of the war , part of the news you hear when you are bored .
i simply know what these people feel , the whole horror .
and i cannot stop saying that .
nothing has changed , people want to stay mutually killing and trying to do it is so sad .
damir became great and is a very gentle and quiet young , he is not aggressive at all or angry .
for example , he is not looking for revenge , he is not overwhelmed by the past horrors .
i know that he does not like to recall it , but he has six close friends from the class and they occasionally go to the sports hall and inflate there candles .
when he was smaller , he suffered - i remember the last time he was in the house of commons , which he had to leave on his face , face for hours .
not sleeping , his eyes were open .
i also remember that the council all expressed its arms and other military games .
i can hardly believe that i spent a few hours so sure that he was dead and i would never have seen him again .
when i was in the aftermath of the explosion and came on my feet , i looked around and saw the hell around me , with around me , with all parts of the body .
i was absolutely sure that my little boy was in this hell impossible to survive .
&quot; i remember that i told him that he was going to be a slave , &quot; damir , lauf , lauf weg &quot; , but i was so sure he had not heard me .
but he has heard it and he has gone away .
and so goes life , unlike that of many others , for us .
georgij ilyin , 17
the boy whose terrible image after the siege became the symbol of the abominations of beslan was beaten and beaten .
comfort : the beslan overlife is a georgij lyin with his mother fatima after the siege of 2004 , on the right a picture of georgij today .
his blood flow is a result of fear , but he was not afraid to take part in the trial .
his image was one of the most shocking symbols of the barbarism of beslan .
his mother fatima , 54 , a doctor , had appointed him for his first day at school before she could go out .
&quot; i left the court about two minutes before the terrorists took him to the court , and so the man in my small room remained there for three terrible days alone , &quot; she recalls .
not entirely alone , there was a whole family of relatives of us , but they were all killed .
only my georgij managed to survive .
the closer this date approaches , the harder it is to remember and to decide what it is .
there is not a single day when we cannot remember this tragedy .
we do not think it is long ago , i think it would have happened yesterday , some scenes from these days are still following me .
no one will ever forget that , i promise you .
i would like to make it clear that georgij ( left ) was one of the most shocking of the attack and was described as a statue ( right ) .
i remember that george w. bush was in power on that day .
i knew that the first day he was alive when i saw him on television .
and now there are even this statue of the weeping georgij in san marino .
georgij does not like the picture , and it is at home in the bookshelf .
i understand that , but i also think that the people of the world are right , thanks to this image , to feel our pain .
georgij says today : &apos; it is important to avoid this kind of thing again .
&quot; i doubt that we will ever be able to find the truth .
people are investigating such tragedies time and time again and never get to know the truth .
and now they are investigating the crash of this boeing in ukraine .
will we ever know what caused it ?
this world is becoming something terrible .
&quot; i cannot understand how that is possible , because if you want to ask people , nobody wants a war , so how is that happening ?
ten years is not a time for such pain .
we need dozens of years to make it a little forgotten .
it has attacked my health and i still feel it .
about three or four years ago i had a few nightmares because of the siege , but then it became better .
i went later in 2004 to school again and had every day fear .
i thought of my friends and classmates , who were killed , but i was not sure if i could .
i am therefore always going to the sports hall when 1 september approaches .
i want to use my old childhood friend a tribute .
it is difficult for me to go to the sports hall , but i have to do it .
i do not feel as a victim , this story is now part of my past .
i will not forget it , but i am sorry not to be so .
my life continues .
i have this year finished school and i visit a medical college in vladikavkaz .
i will be a heart surgeon .
my first choice was to train in the army .
i wanted to become a soldier , but my health did not allow that .
i wanted to fight for my country , but that will not happen .
georgij faniev , 20
the boy who survived , though he was at the foot of a murderous terrorist , was a prisoner of war .
one miracle : georgij faniev was a prisoner during the siege at the foot of a murderous terrorist , but he managed to survive .
during the siege he was in the sports hall and sits next to the bomb that was at the foot of a murderous terrorist .
it is a real wonder that he has not been killed .
&quot; we feel it is as if it were yesterday , &quot; says georgij , who is a intelligence officer on the fsb , but this is because of his health damage due to the siege .
it is still with me , it is not something i am left behind .
i am now older and people say that children are easily infected with bad experiences - i have to say that is not true .
&quot; in 2006 i worked with psychologists and felt really better after that , but i can not forget it .
i would like to forget .
2005 - in the year after - the first and only time i was back in the sports hall .
i lost the consciousness .
i will never return to that and ask me if i can tell you that i am not in this famous picture .
survivors : georgij faniyev today , with a photo of himself in hospital after the siege on the laptop .
my pain is immense and i wear it every day with me .
my friends know that i do not like to think about it or talk about it , and they never asked me about school .
physically , i am doing well .
i should be careful with my injured knee , but i can now run well .
but because of my health i could not attend the intelligence academy of the fsb in sankt petersburg , as i wanted .
i have not received my documents , including the medical ones , and you have replied that it is not possible .
my second passion was the animals , so i went to the veterinary institute .
i have been there for two years .
he learns to treat all animals &quot; from cats to cows &quot; .
he said : &apos; i knew that i would be able to help my children from my experiences .
children should not know about this and they should not , of course , suffer it .
his mother marina , 42 , said : &quot; this pain leaves me never .
he is in my soul , worse if the anniversary is approaching .
i will be taking part in the commemoration ceremonies .
i know that georgij cannot go .
it still needs to be much more violent for him because he was there and i did not .
i waited at home for him and could not help .
i am so grateful to god that he has returned to me , here in beslan , all of them are drawn .
we remain in it .
georgij is now an adult , but this horror is still in him .
it is difficult to accept this when something like this is being denied .
he is a young man who likes sport , but he cannot be here because of his knee .
he has been operating several times , he can run , but he can not exercise .
i would say that he has been too 50 % overcoming the horror , but it is never possible to completely overlook and forget that .
this terrible experience is always being brought to our attention .
many friends and neighbours were killed during the siege and this only reinforces my pain .
i have lost many people i know well and who have been expensive .
my son is with me , and this is the greatest gift that god can make me , but my heart wears around the slain .
i know from families where new children were born , but also from witwyn , who never again married .
it is difficult to accept that life continues , even if you can &apos;t .
i will never forget how my heart sprang in me when i saw him in the hospital .
and now i see what is happening in the world - wars in other regions .
what are these people fighting for ?
why are they killing each other ?
war has now become very close to our country and i almost cannot believe that .
we were a friendly country in the past , how can it be that we are now fighting ?
people and children are suffering , i am sure that ukraine has already had many children killed and still has many killed .
if we only want to take all these rebels and throw out - as far away as possible .
aljona tskajeva , 10 km from the airport , 10 km from the city of tskajeva , 10 km from the airport .
the baby , which is so captivating from a special mission in safety , is now in the safe position .
rescued : aljona tskajewa is led by a russian special forces .
it is now ten ( right ) and does not remember the cruelty of the past .
the world held its breath in 2004 , when the baby aljona was born in the arms of a russian policeman from the siege of beslan .
the terrorists left them , but kept in their cruelty their 30-year-old mother , who was 10 years old sister kristina and her brother makhar in the school sports hall .
makhar , then three years old , escaped , but aljona &apos;s mother and sister died in the murderous slaughter .
her father ruslan has since married again .
aljona , now ten years old , does not remember the siege and is becoming an intelligent and happy girl .
&quot; you are now a great happy family and aljona and makhar are both great children , &quot; says a close friend .
ruslan is a fantastic father and wants to give you all the memories you need to make your tenth anniversary a success .
you will understand why .

4 tips for better underwater photos and videos .
if you like to take photos or videos under water , there is a selection of devices .
the cheapest option is a waterproof point-anderer .
i took these photos at a family festival with several cameras , all of them at a price of less than $ 350 .
regardless of the equipment , there are some rules for the best results .
control your equipment twice .
even if you have a waterproof camera , make sure that the camera is in the right position .
set your camera to the photos or videos you want to record .
some cameras and camcorders have scene and record capturing modes , which allow the capture of the exposure time for the dusk subjects .
and before you jump into , check to see what depth your equipment is working .
some cameras are only available for up to 5 feet , others up to 50 or 60 feet .
search our purchasing guide and ratings for digital cameras for conventional cameras .
make multiple shots - because many do not go down .
point and shoot games are available with a lcd , which allows you to compress images .
even if you have an lcd , it is difficult to do this under water , and the correct image setting is a gambling affair .
so make many shots .
if your camera has a row mode , which allows a number of shots to be taken with slightly changed exposure settings , use the camera .
stay close to the surface .
the light is dramatically worse the further it moves away from the surface .
if possible , they remain close to the surface when they take recordings in a pool , a lake or the sea .
this allows you to add more color to your photos ; the deeper you go , the less color you will see .
walk closely to the objects and see how they are made .
this is also a good advice on land , but it is all the more important under water because of the poor light conditions .
it is particularly important to be familiar with an action call .
andrew lawson was a man of the variety whose character made things different , even in a gigantic organization like the nhs .
as an advisory anaesthetist he devoted his career to the task of helping the sick to both agony of the disease and quell the pain of treatment .
among his patients , his wife remembers , was a mi6 employee who worked with the devastating effects of torture .
lawson knew that the us medical doctors had been denied the diagnoses and diseases , while the treated patients were mostly treated with something quite different .
one day in 2007 , however , he was the one who was the path of suffering .
&quot; i did not feel that i &quot; wrote , &quot; in may of this year .
i had difficulty in getting up .
while he was playing with the flu similar symptoms , he noticed that he was not able to help his wife juliet impatiently .
&quot; i want to do everything better immediately than later , &quot; he noted .
when juliet was on a business trip for a week , lambert felt very unconventional in his approach to the issue .
something is wrong with the air .
he asked a colleague to write an x-ray of his breast .
only two weeks ago he was in the french alps for skiing .
the result of the x-ray inspection was available .
he suffered from mesothelioma , an incurable cancer that could cause the breast skin , that is , the lungs overtaking skin .
as with most cancer cases , the risk of cancer is precisely the most difficult to determine .
for example , while some smokers suffer from lung cancer , not all lung cancer is the same .
but mesotheliom is different .
in almost all cases , the trigger is an asbestos load - contact with the fibre building material that was once known as &quot; miracle &quot; but has now been found to be fatal .
for most of us , mesothelioma is a disease that is as easily ignored .
after all , asbestos is a product of the past .
the most dangerous asbestos type has been used in britain since the 1960 ’ s , when industry voluntarily committed itself to not using it .
even where he is still in use , only people in certain industries worked directly with the substance - plumbers , construction workers , carpentry and shipyard workers , for example .
as an industrial hazardous material from a different time , it seems that it is hardly even more worrying today .
but this complacency is inappropriate .
britain , it seems , is experiencing the culmination of a mesotheliom epidemic .
there are more deaths from mesothelioma here than in any other country in the world .
with a total of 2,500 deaths a year , twice as many people die from this disease as from road accidents .
annual figures from the mesothelioma deaths since 1980 and prospective future deaths in britain are estimated to be around eur 1 billion .
the reason we have not yet seen the fatal effects , even though asbestos has been illegal for years ( 1999 all types of asbestos were banned ) is that a mesothelioma is only developing after decades .
and the scourge of the mesotheliom is not confined to former workers in the construction sector .
asbestos was , and is often still present in the houses in which we live , the offices in which we work , the schools where we learn and the shops where we work .
mesothelioma therefore knows no class barriers , financial limits , professions or age .
the privileged bastions , of which the elegant department stores in london and private schools , are not a shelter .
the parliament buildings are asbestos contaminated .
in hospitals , where we are healthy , we also have a great deal of work to do in this deadly carcinogenic gene .
andrew lawson was not old .
he was not a plumber either .
he fell in love with the idea of what would be the best way to deal with asbestos .
then he found out .
&quot; it looks like the european union is going to be in the tunnels at guy &apos;s hospital , where i spent six years studying my training .
all - students , nurses , doctors and nurses - are using the tunnels .
one wonders how many of my colleagues at the same disease will suffer ?
he was unfortunately able to answer this question in part at least .
&quot; of the four doctors who worked at guy &apos;s hospital , the only one was the guy &apos;s hospital .
as many of us are still ill ?
andrew lawson was a mesotheliom at the age of 48 .
when he was elected on 17 february this year , he was 55 .
this was an unusually long period of survival .
fifty per cent of all mesotheliocarpsis die within 8 months of diagnosis .
the disease always ends up deadly .
we can only support lawson ’ s question : &apos; how many of us will be ill ? &apos;
the leading uk expert on mesothelioma , professor julian peto , takes part in the international trade fair for mesothelioma between 1870 and 2050 , when the asbestopidemie is expected to fall in britain .
most of these have not yet been known that they are dying like this .
an asbestos mine in quebec , canada alamy , canada , canada , alamy , canada , and the united states is a major source of information for the european union .
a brief look at the records of the courts to which the people concerned often have to turn for compensation claims shows how far the intellectual property rights scourge has gone .
in june this year marks &amp; spencer admitted , for example , that janice would be exposed to asbestos in all negligence .
she worked for nine years for the chain , from 1978 to 1987 , and was responsible for the clothing department at two locations - one of which was the flagship store in the oxford street .
mrs. allen was only 18 years after she began her business at m &amp; s .
now she has two children in the twentieth century .
&quot; before this thing , &quot; she says , &quot; i have never heard of mesotheliom , i knew not even really anything about asbestos .
i never thought that the time would concern me .
there are few people who have heard a lot about asbestos .
the fact is that the term asbestos does not refer to a substance , but to a group of six minerals .
the name comes from the word &quot; asbestos &quot; , a description of the fibre structure that characterizes the fabric and makes it flexible .
three of the six were used in the construction industry .
chrysotile , also known as white asbestos , is by far the most common form of asbestos found in buildings today .
it was designed for roof tiles , floor tiles , pipe soles , boilers , even for brake surface .
it is less fatal than other forms of asbestos , but it is still considered by the eu and the who as &apos; great health risk &apos; with possible death .
however , the brown asbestos ( amosite ) and blue asbestos ( krokydolith ) are dangerous .
britain was once the world ’ s largest importer of brown asbestos , and experts suspect that &quot; there are clear but indirect indications that this is a major reason for the uniquely high mesotheliomrates .
a mark &amp; spencer employee was arrested in the flagship store in the oxford street , london , asbestos exposed alamy .
jan allen has perhaps not been a typical mesotheliomopfer , but he has been a great success for julian peto .
he has carried out a study of the people concerned , showing that &apos; a significant proportion of the mesothelioma is produced without known suspension by work or in the house , presumably by contact with asbestos in the environment &apos; .
a large part of these contacts is based on the &quot; normal use and ageing &quot; of our buildings .
it looks as if nobody can assume that the european union will be safe .
a report by goddard consulting , which describes the palace of westminster , is a good example of how people can be found in the heart of the government , unknowingly exposed to the substance .
in 2009 , goddard reported that the service shafts and pipes are located behind the committee rooms of parliament with asbestos , whose deadly factories are replaced by something as harmless as &apos; strong air &apos; .
members of parliament are often accused of taking care of their own interests , but this is where it appears that the european parliament is doing the opposite .
while the directorate for parliamentary labour has insisted that the westminster palace be a &apos; clean health certificate &apos; , the commission is not in a position to take any action to save £ 1 billion of work over several years .
goddard &apos;s report also pointed out that &apos; the existence of a single source of asbestos does not correspond to the respective provisions &apos; .
no one can know whether this mismanagement will cost lives .
everything that can be done now is waiting .
a person who has lost contact with asbestos is graham abbott , a general practitioner .
as andrew lawson suggests , the 50-year-old abbott suspects that he was in hospital for asbestos .
&quot; i have been working in a hospital where asbestos complaints have been decided positively , &quot; he says , &quot; but i can &apos;t prove it in my case .
it is so difficult to get to any place where you can work .
what he has just remembered is the day at the beginning of december 2009 , when he was behaving like this .
he was 45 , and he led an operation just late in the evening .
suddenly i had shaken frost .
suddenly , it came .
i felt terrible .
i believed that the journey home no longer could be made .
as a doctor , abbott knew that the pain was caused by the chest , the skin around his lungs and the skin .
but as jan allen said , he had no reason to be a mesothelioma .
he did not go to work for a month .
i am surprised that the doctors made x-ray recordings of his chest and use the pluracathether to remove fluid from the lungs and to test it in the laboratory .
his complaints , however , remained undiagnosed .
his health improved slowly , and he returned to his workplace .
from time to time , the symptoms returned , often after sporting reactions .
in 2011 , a patient abbott came with similar symptoms in his practice and was later treated with mesotheliom .
but now , abbott did not confine this to his own case .
after all , his patient was a few decades older and had to work directly with asbestos .
the connection in that case was clear .
in september 2011 , abbott ’ s state deteriorated again , and his general practitioner brought his ct scans and x-ray recordings to a group of experts .
in december 2011 , exactly two years after abbott first joined the sick , the german government was forced to take a camera equipped probe into the cave between the rib and the breast fell .
i am an optimist .
i usually make further progress , &quot; he says .
frankly , i had not even had so many concerns .
but rachel , my wife , was concerned .
the result of the biopsy was between christmas and new year before : &quot; you said to me that it was mesothelioma . &quot;
graham abbott : diagnosis mesothelioma mesothelioma diagnosis
suddenly , abbott had appointments with macmillan nurses , of whom one had recommended him to take a look at a lawyer .
he was only now aware of the extent of the epidemic .
&quot; it turned out that asbestos was very common , especially in large public buildings where rohs were often exposed to asbestos , &quot; he says .
the people who are exposed to asbestos in these buildings are now ill .
and so mesotheliom is now hitting younger people who are not working in the typical professions .
the most dangerous pipes with asbestos insulation in hospitals were located beneath the earth , so patients were probably not exposed to the substance .
but many employees who work in pedestrian tunnels from one building to another are not allowed to use the car in the same way as andrew lawson , or in underground canteen ( as graham abbott often did ) .
it is clear that , for several decades after the war , hospitals may have been the life-saving for patients , but they are life-threatening for the doctors they deal with .
he is still being removed today .
students put their bunsenbrenner on asbestos mats .
and it does not just concern hospitals .
asbestos has been developed for its fabulous insulating and flame retardant properties , often in offices , shops , libraries and town halls .
schools too .
indeed , many people probably have the first asbestos contact in the classroom .
throughout the country , in thousands of chemistry lessons , students have their bunkers on asbestos mats .
on websites , the issue of asbestos is now frequently raised in schools .
and meanwhile , innocent objects have been buried in our houses like floors or scale-cupboards by default .
&quot; it is an industrial poison that is used in large parts of our real estate , &quot; says andrew morgan , the lawyer who is andrew lawson in his trial against guy &apos;s .
in one case , the only contact that could be found in a woman concerned was the demolition of a shed in the 1970s .
so be careful how you can fit your garden shed .
the effects of diagnosis , and the knowledge that the disease is incurable , is immense .
&quot; it takes a while to process that , &quot; says graham abbott .
i went back to work and tried to continue , but i noticed that i had to go to the office to work .
i was in practice for two weeks .
then i knew that i would go and take care of myself .
well , i will not give another christmas party .
the greatest difficulty was the perspective change from the position of a doctor to the position of a patient .
like countless patients before him , he remembers how overwhelming he is of all the information he has had to deal with .
&quot; it was very difficult to include all of this , &quot; he says .
&quot; i asked my doctor &quot; how long have i left ? &quot;
and they gave me another 12 months .
i remember that i thought i was &quot; well , i was going to not give another christmas party .
that &apos;s it . &quot;
mesotheliom is particularly insidious , because it is our life support mechanism - breathing itself - that the deadly cancer is caused .
most of the mesothelioma are caused by asbestos contact .
asbestos consists of the smallest fibers .
if the asbestos is wound up and the fibres are inhaled , you can feel comfortable in the chest , the skin around the lungs .
asbestos fibers irrage the chest and can trigger cell mutations .
&quot; the problem arises with the inhaled needle shaped asbestos fibres , &quot; professor tom treasure , a heart-thrown man .
it is the hospital that andrew lawson suspects that is the only one that has exposed him to asbestos that is ironically a leading centre in the treatment of mesothelioma .
treasure knew lawns and betrayed some others who probably also had to work in the hospital during their training .
once the asbestos needles reach the lung tissue , treasure says , &quot; you will be taken from the breathing process to the edge where the skin is .
by nature , it is inherently invasive from the beginning .
the usual options for other cancer diseases are not working in mesothelioma .
the effectiveness of an operation is highly controversial , for example .
some say that they value an attempt .
treasure nests on it .
&quot; you can use the breast coat not cut out , &quot; he says .
you will arrive with the knife not around it .
meanwhile , cancer is &quot; at chemotherapy not very well , &quot; the &quot; effect shows &quot; , but not healing .
&quot; sometimes there are long-term survivors , &quot; says treasure .
but in the end they all die .
fortunately , some patients actually live long , much longer than expected .
the author stephen jay gould died 20 years after diagnosis .
two and a half years after his own diagnosis , graham abbott is still fighting .
after having bought mesotheliom , abbott came into contact with andrew lawson , who spent four years in the hospital after his diagnosis .
&quot; hello , cancer center , &quot; he stood at calls föhlich before .
&quot; he was very positive , &quot; says abbott .
he had his diagnosis four years earlier and was still very active .
originally , abbott had six chemotherapy cycles , which included four months of chemotherapy and is expected to be extended by only one month .
&quot; i was desperate , &quot; he says .
i wanted to give up .
lawson managed to &quot; make things in a slightly more positive way &quot; .
after consulting several doctors , he decided to take a course in the treatment with prof. loic lang-lazdunski , herz-thorax specialist at the guy &apos;s .
&quot; we have had an advantage by not referring .
a normal patient would have a refund and would have to wait for the approval of the treatment .
money is crucial for mesotheliom-sufferers to obtain the best available therapies .
but if these treatments inevitably lead to failure , the risks are many .
and so you turn to the courts in the hope of compensation .
andrew lawson contacted andrew morgan of field college and the board of directors for a letter to the board of directors .
&quot; it has been known since 1898 that asbestos is extremely dangerous for health , &quot; says morgan .
but what has changed in the 1960 ’ s is that it was recognized that even a very small burden is a health risk .
and here began the negligence of companies to play a role .
andrew lawson and guy &apos;s hospitality company put their case to the court , but it was not that they wanted to make morgan a &quot; full compensation &quot; .
after the investigation to his death , a spokesman of the guy &apos;s confirmed that &quot; the asbestos fibers in the affected cellar area in the 1990s were removed . &quot;
that was a great achievement for andrew lawson .
like asbestos can be removed , it can be removed from the same way as asbestos can be removed .
indeed , mesotheliom-sufferers who have sought compensation are not likely to suffer from a huge problem , the deadly asbestos contact of a company or a job - usually decades after the incident .
many of their former employers are sold or closed .
insurance documents can be lost .
and those who are opposed to claims know that they are not going to have time , but certainly not with the cold people .
in response , there have been clear new legislation this year , which will make it easier for mesotheliom-affected parties to obtain compensation .
the law has a code of conduct promoted by the insurance industry of eur 350 million for all those who have been in the diagnosis after july 2012 .
in such cases , the plaintiff will receive 80 % of what a court can obtain in a normal compensation process - about 120,000 £ .
about 300 successful applications were submitted to the program each year .
andrew morgan thinks like so many mesotheliom people that 350 million £ is a &quot; very good work &quot; of the insurance industry .
&quot; this is a deal of insurers for insurers , &quot; he says , and indicates that the insurance is a real deal .
mike penning , then employed as a worker and pension minister , admitted that the law &quot; was not perfect .
but both penning and morgan admitted that , with seven deaths , the number of deaths was increasing every day .
&quot; people suffer so much and need help today , &quot; said penning during the second hearing of the mesotheliom act in december last year .
at that time , graham abbott was in the hands of prof. loic lang-lazdunski for 19 months .
after their initial deliberations , lang-lazdunski recommended an operation that he could not have expected to have been performed , unlike tom treasure .
this was caused by radiation therapy and chemical therapy .
abbott felt stronger .
&quot; this is of course the most important thing , &quot; says abbott .
this is always seen in patients .
there is something that will keep you going .
if you give up , you are going very quickly worse .
graham abbott underwent a major review of the operation in march 2012 .
at the end of august , he had the last of the six chemotherapy cycles .
follow-up scanscan did not show any signs of the disease .
then i had a meeting in march 2014 .
there have been several cancer spots around my breast .
i was just 50 .
this is not life-threatening .
this is an end to life .
again , abbott undertook six chemotherapy cycles .
now there is no trace of the tumors visible .
but the process is physically and mentally very demanding .
they must think of practical things - about money , if i am no longer , for example , or show my wife how the boiler time setting works .
if you receive bad news , you will be negative .
they must look forward .
as the father of ellie , 16 , and tamsin , 14 , this is not always easy .
&quot; for parents , this is difficult , &quot; he says .
it is difficult to know what to say and how much .
when i first received my first diagnosis , i told my girl that i had a disease with which i could not get old .
they responded very differently .
tamsin is very sociable and discouraged .
she told her friends and we were told that we would get a lot of calls soon .
ellie was more cautious .
she did not say much .
such talks are something that all cancer patients should have gone through .
but for mesotheliocarpenters such talks did not pass through hope , not a trace of hope for survival .
the disease brings ( as eventually it also means for stephen jay gould ) a grim security .
as andrew morgan says , &quot; mesotheliom is not life-threatening .

china refuses to recognise hong kong &apos;s right to government , and protesters swear retaliation and retaliation .
on sunday , the chinese parliament decided to hold a referendum on the chinese constitution , despite the more calls for democratic reforms .
this approach presumably fights the long-proclaimed protests in hong kong &apos;s business district , while activists continue to support planning and mobilisation within a few hours of the announcement .
the chinese people ’ s congress ’ s decision allows communist leaders to use all non-beijing rights to rebuild their country .
&quot; that &apos;s not unexpected , but it makes us angry , &quot; said legal expert emily lau , chairman of the democratic party .
this is not what beijing is promised .
the inhabitants of hong kong have been lied to .
it is clear that we are dealing with an authoritarian regime which is not the only one .
in defending china ’ s decision , li fei , the secretary general of the standing committee of the national people ’ s congress , said that the approval of public nominations in the hong kong government ’ s elections would lead to chaotic .
since 1997 , when britain lost control of hong kong to the chinese , the chinese have been pledging to repatriate the chinese government from 2017 .
china ’ s leaders presented sunday ’ s decision as a democratic breakthrough , because it was a clear signal to hong kong ’ s citizens that the choice was made , but the decision also shows that china ’ s leaders are not in a position of close beijing .
a new clause also states that only candidates who are &quot; loving to the land and love for hong kong &quot; shall be allowed .
the decision follows a summer in which some of the largest and most popular events in the world were held in hong kong for several years .
behind the pro-democratic campaign in hong kong is the occupy central with love and peace movement .
on sunday evening , within a few hours of the announcement , the number of people who had been occupying the premises had reached hundreds of occupy central supporters in front of the hong kong government headquarters .
during the demonstration , the organizers said that their movement had undergone a new stage of civil disobedience and that they would be protesting waves in the coming weeks .
however , they did not specify any more , apparently to avoid problems with the authorities .
in an online communication , the organizers stated that the movement &quot; the occupation of the central district only as the last means in consideration &quot; was a major step forward .
we are sorry to say that the situation is that all the opportunities for dialogue are being exhausted today and the occupation of the central district is going to take place definitively .
the hong kong authorities have been working on the announcement of beijing &apos;s intention to open negotiations with the chinese authorities on sunday before the government building .
the unrest is being caused by the feeling of many in hong kong that they are slowly losing control of their city .
the influx of people from the mainland increases competition for products and services .
moreover , there is growing fear that hong kong ’ s values , such as democracy and freedom of speech , will be eroded under the growing pressure of beijing .
some criticized the demonstrations of the occupy-center movement , because they did not prohibit business - the life bar of hong kong - .
&quot; the protests they are talking about could have major economic damage , the depending on how many people are involved and how long they last .
we do not want to fuel any fear that hong kong will get out of control .
this impression is bad for investment .
state-controlled media in china reported a similar situation recently , as the pro-democracy activists in hong kong reported .
this summer , activists organized an unofficial referendum on the election rights that the eu had 780,000 people in - more than a fifth of the electorate in hong kong .
in july , tens of thousands took part in one of the largest democratic demonstrations in the region ’ s history .
the tradition of school final balls in the us is now being transferred to universities , where freshmen perform with the private aeroplane .
we look forward to responding to this demand and to the first luxury travel service in the uk for students of today .
to enjoy a particularly impressive performance at the university , the hotel offers a range of transport options , including private aircraft , rolls-royce phantom , aston marten or mclaren p1 .
mr stewart also stated that the service is a security section .
this service is an ideal alternative for students who would otherwise have their habits in a dangerously overloaded car through the country of coach .
together with our new vif options , we look forward to this year &apos;s edition of vif to ensure that students get the university with a minimum of effort and a maximum of luxury .
a company spokesman said that there are no new bookings yet , because the service is only just launched .
the company also announced that it had not yet received any training fees of £ 9,000 per year , despite the tuition fees .
students today differ in their expectations and expectations very much from the students before 10 , 20 , 30 or 40 years ago - it is more important than ever to have a great first impression , and with vif you can do just that .
the national student union criticised the service as being cancelled .
megan dunn , vice president of the nus for higher education , said : &quot; this offer seems to be completely separate from the life of the majority of students .
many students who have been studying this month are facing a crisis of life-support costs , as the available financial assistance in the form of loans and grants is not available to the most rapidly growing invoices for the simplest living conditions .
feminists criticize racial issues and policing in ferguson
the unarmed teenager was arrested at the beginning of this month by a police officer in ferguson , mo .
participants raised their hands in the air and sang , &quot; hands high , not shoot , &quot; while they were before burial .
after two weeks of protests in ferguson , mo , due to the shooting of the unarmed teenager michael brown noticed that the bloggers had been in the news .
after their experience , white feminist commentators put gender before the race , if it is a question of reproductive rights and income inequality .
while tensions in the middle west have risen and taken heed throughout the country , perez saw that the responses of white women were 100 % concerned with the breed .
compared to the responses of black women shortly after the shots of 9 august , personal essays were printed with titles such as &quot; thoughts on ferguson of a white woman &quot; and &quot; feminism is not just about oppression .
but for perez , this was an important change .
&quot; i do not think you can be a lot of people in feminism who know about it and who have privileges in such a sophisticated way , &quot; she said .
people felt they were pressed to do something about the incidents that took place .
it is characteristic of the crisis in which we find ourselves and because the situation in ferguson is so ethnicized that it expresses this .
for english professor koritha mitchell of the ohio state university , please visit the website of ferguson .
&quot; i can find something fun on facebook about me and my partner and get 150 litres of everything from the top down , &quot; said mitchell .
if i am to talk about how coloured in your own country are under siege , then the silence is ears .
&quot; how can it be safe for women to talk publicly about a relationship , but not about security in public space ? &quot; she asked .
for black women like mitchell , the race , gender and sexual orientation in the history of the us , the new york times have no density .
for them , black women do not have the luxury of choosing the topics neatly separated ; they live in the combined world every day .
while white women are now the subjects of race and gender in the feminist mainstream circles , the angela hattory says , professor of feminist gender equality .
&quot; between 1865 and 1890 , at least 10,000 black men were yellowed and the rationale was almost always the rape of a white woman , &quot; said hattery .
white women had to be involved in the story to help the lynchess murder .
for hattery , the split between white and black women reached the point where female white fighters were fighting for the women ’ s voting right , such as susan b. anthony , in the late nineteenth century .
&quot; they decided to take a stand for the women &apos;s voting rights , and the right to vote for black should come later , &quot; said hattery .
if we remember such things , we are being powerfully aware of why colored women are not wearing white women .
we have not done our job well .
we have never helped black women to get their husbands and sons to protect themselves .
even after women won the election in 1920 , it took another decade to get the election to be made public .
the group was established almost 40 years after the original request for help from black women , says mitchell .
for mitchell , the flood of white feminist responses to the heterogeneous problems raised by ferguson - police behavior , racial discrimination - is a mirror of the time when white feminists catch .
&quot; would it not be great if the activists who have such traditional feminist platforms were to have the right to education of a child so seriously ?
feminists of the second generation who have made their career in the struggle for reproductive rights and access to contraception rights are now being forced to seek to understand what the system means .
the famous white feminist activist gloria steiner went to the hospital two weeks after the shooting of michael brown .
&quot; i hope that women who have a different but parallel mind will be able to find a solution that is inherent to the body - and opinions on the race , the way in public surveys are significantly different - the changes .
although steiner is responsible for a rather intersectional feminism , in which racial as gender issues are addressed , some of her comments are not relevant .
christina sommer , researcher at the american enterprise institute and author of the &quot; who stole feminism ? &quot; said to she the people of europe .
there are now hundreds of specific programmes for girls and young women , but almost nothing for boys .
but when the white house recently adopted a small program , my brother &apos;s keeper , it was not clear how to help vulnerable young black and hispanic men , there was annoying reactions from many feminists , including women .
the relationship between the police and the black community is not the only problem that has come to the fore of mainstream feminism .
after the us border police arrested almost 63,000 unaccompanied minors on the southwest border of the country this year , the international criminal court is also taking up the issue of immigration reform - this time as a women &apos;s issue .
andrea mercado , co-chair of we belong together , a group that is supporting women for immigration and the fight against illegal immigration , said that there is no need for a reconsideration of the issue as a fundamental women &apos;s issue .
&quot; they speak for themselves , &quot; said mercado .
if the vast majority of labour visas are to be sent to male immigrants , women who are forced to accompany them are in a position where they are responsible for domestic violence and exploitation .
&quot; these stories find a sustainable way of life in women &apos;s organisations , &quot; she said .
&quot; schweine-haus &quot; in ipswich is available for sale .
the image of a house for sale was created by real estate agents , when it became clear that there was a big pig that it could afford to be comfortable in the living room .
the detached house has one bedroom , located on a private street in ipswich and is rented for 120,000 pounds .
the details included a picture of the living room of the house - one of which was a pig , that had his head on a sofa bed .
real estate agents connells said that the pig on the photo is the pet .
&quot; the photo was taken by mistake and was published by now &quot; said a spokesperson of the company .
the excelé of the house described connells as the former meeting house as a &quot; unique &quot; house .
although the broker may have the image removed from the website , it still appears on advertising material .
the house sales in the social media were of interest when some asked whether the house would be in the purchase price .

leonidas asked the gladiator band to be released on the market .
not only the gladiators were standing ankle in the matsch at the first rheinbacher römertag in the leisure park .
but the attraction of the event was strong enough to be well over 1000 visitors yesterday .
there was a colorful series of depictions , performances , games , exhibition pieces and information about the time of the romans and their importance for the rheinland .
the main attraction of the day was undoubtedly the martialic fighter force of the gladiator school &quot; amor mortis &quot; , which was a great help to get the most out of every rainy season .
gladiator owner &quot; leonidas &quot; proved to be a humane and efficient person .
first , the &quot; provocateurs &quot; were in the series with rectangular and short-sword as well as leg on the left leg and arm rail on the right arm .
the &quot; estates &quot; followed , with breast chids , short cuts and a litter planze , and iron curtain .
the hotel was very impressive , the performance of the &quot; retiarius &quot; , which was connected with the litter net , triple and dolch against the &quot; securor &quot; and was subsequently able to ground the burn after a short fight .
the swords of metal and metal scratch together , the shields sketches and the throwing lances flew surrendering through the arena that is a fear and fear .
but the imf ’ s imposing &quot; summa rudit &quot; , the mukulous shooter , had always been an attentive eye .
&quot; we wanted to make the everyday life of rome a reality again and to preserve the culture of the roman period , &quot; said lorenz euskirchen , chairman of the organizer &quot; freundeskreis römerkanal &quot; .
after two years of preparation , the park for a day became a &quot; opportunistic &quot; .
after all , the romans not only fought and conquered our region , but also the roman culture and numerous buildings that we still have today .
remains of these were also found in the roman day .
the frontinus company placed the water and energy supply on the agenda once and now , and managing director petra fricke knew : &quot; we are still drawing benefits from the knowledge of that time &quot; .
this also confirms the degree survey engineer ralph heiliger of the &quot; ingenieurteamzwei &quot; from rheinbach , the surveying instruments of the romans such as chorobat , groma or dioptra .
the romanesque villa in blankenheim presented sketches and models of the excavations anno 1894 and brick from the original hypocaste , the warmth of the air , the once the roman baths .
the pedestrian precinct is also impressive , as wolf and fuchs discovered two millennia ago in the clay footsteps .
in 2011 , the town hall of the national association of rheinland had the remains of a roman villa in the industrial park nord in rheinbach .
the wall was erected in an economic building with a drying drying drying of cereals and milling .
the building probably had to be converted into a villa rustica , an agricultural property , explained the archaeologist dr. jennifer morschiser .
a number of finds from these expositions were found in the area of glass-display , including a large tunnel plate , several fountains of glass , and parts of a delicate necklace .
the villa was probably built from the first century to the fourth century ad until the beginning of the germans &apos; arrival in the roman rhineland , presumably morscheiser .
it was the children who also worked with the roman windmill game , similar to today &apos;s mill game , or they wrote as they once wrote the roman pupils with metal handles on existing tables .
the booth of the römerthermen zülpich was the place for the children to put mosaics themselves , at the stand of the rheinbach glass mosaics and at the stand of the natural centre eifel weittersheifel weittersheifel weittersheim .
the two cold-blooded ballroom is a true example of the original roman travel car .
with a week of rome from 13 to 21 september , the town of wachtberg will also be able to take part in the rhineland römeryear 2014 , which reminds of the death of emperor augustus 2000 years ago .
together with the local and historical associations and the wachtberger wanderverein , the partnership association and the laienspielkreis oberbachem , thematic hikes , a talk , cooking lessons and much more .
for example , a roman legionnaire is being deported from his work at the appropriate wachtberg , plants are being used as living monument from the roman era and a funny lesson is being taught in matters of international understanding .
the adendorfer elementary school is dedicated to the development of the römerthema during a project week .
the romans week is intended to bring together the many , but often not at first glance , traces of the romans in wachtberg .
the wachtberger rathaus will present a small presentation to the finds of the berkumer matronenheiligteum in 1879 .
ebola : the epidemic is a burden on west africa ’ s economy
the ebola epidemic in west africa is also a serious blow to the economy .
markets are orphaned - and international companies are distancing themselves .
the devastating ebola epidemic is putting the economy of west africa at a serious blow .
the harvest is rotting on the fields that have mines left and the markets are wasting - that virus has destroyed the region hard .
some international companies are also already at a distance .
&quot; the ebola epidemic is not only a medical crisis , but also an economic one , &quot; the chief of the african development bank , donald kaberuka , judges .
liberia is the hardest hit , and the worst affected is the country .
&quot; it is a total disaster , we lose a lot of money , &quot; says alhaji bamogo , who is on the second largest market in liberia &apos;s capital monrovia clothing .
the market is only when you buy food or something for disinfection from ebola .
liberia is the hardest hit by the virus , alone here fell the fright .
recently , the health authorities declared that the disease was spread to every corner of the country .
guinea , sierra leone and nigeria have also been affected by the virus .
in total , more than 1500 people have died , thousands more have died .
foreign companies attract employees from abroad to work in the company .
throughout the resource-rich countries , firms are setting up their business .
foreign companies such as the steel group arcelor mittal are withdrawing their employees , several international airlines are flying to the affected regions .
the local dealers and farmers are also reacting : few merchants are still leaving their homes to buy a refund .
in some areas of sierra leone and liberia , which suffered quarantine , the situation is getting worse , including the areas of land important for export of cocoa and coffee beans .
farmers do not dare to pay for the harvest .
food is scarce
&quot; people are going to travel less and less , &quot; says phillipe de vreyer , paris expert on the economy of west africa .
the man , for example , who normally goes on the market and sells his vegetables , would rather stay at home .
the people are therefore being told the consequences of the epidemic directly and urgently : food is getting scarce .
in the markets , the stock of basic foodstuffs such as rice is dwindling .
at the same time , the highly dependent region is threatening to damage its image , with far-reaching consequences .
the greatest danger is that international companies will generally have to leave the area for a long time , says philippe hugon of the french think tank iris .
the crucial thing is how far and how long the virus will spread .
investors may feel that &quot; the problem is dangerous , in good faith , to live in guinea , sierra leone and liberia , and thus to invest &quot; , hugon warns .
the disease also affects the strained public budgets of the states .
the disease also affects the already painful and unhealthy national budgets of the countries concerned .
credit rating agency moody &apos;s has been afraid that the credit rating agencies &apos; budgets will be heavily affected by the high expenditure on the health system and , in addition , by the worsening economy .
the african development bank has already promised to provide the health systems of the countries concerned with $ 60 million ( eur 45 million ) .
the effects are also already felt in nigeria , where only a few ebola cases have been diagnosed .
although the oil-rich region of the southern niger delta has not been affected so far .
but elsewhere , many people have already left for fear of infection at home .
reservations for hotels are also significantly reduced .

the original name &quot; tank forest berngau &quot; was derived from the year 1907 when the first plant was opened on march 21 .
the nazi regime had the dissolution of the association in 1937 .
only in 1964 did 19 young men find themselves again , who were born on april 30 at the guesthouse lukas the &quot; new &quot; protector &apos;s association &quot; tannenwald &quot; berngau .
karl march and adolf ried led the association as protector champions through a difficult initial period in which it predominantly sought to improve a unified and independent club .
in the autumn of 1965 , the schützenverein started the &quot; leininger &quot; inn with two teams in the rundencompetitions .
in the following years , the sports shooters , who have now been organized in seven teams , established themselves in all classes up to the 1st gauliga .
the club records purzelten every year and the magic border of 380 rings was first mentioned in 1980 by rudi meier .
just as the performance of the active defenders has increased , the members ’ numbers have also improved .
after the club &quot; leininger &quot; was no longer able to meet the demands of a modern shooting club , the association has decided to take over the management board of the former , led by johann rinn .
after a work output of 2700 hours , the company awarded the first prize on 8 may 1988 for the new shooters rooms to the church .
one of the great highlights of the club &apos;s history was certainly the 44th shooting , combined with the solemn consecration of the new shooter flag in july 1991 .
on 23 and 24 april 1994 , the schützenverein founded its 30-year founding anniversary .
1995 is a böllergroup was founded .
josef schmalzl was appointed a böllerrestant .
a major challenge for the &quot; böllerer &quot; and for the club as a whole was the orientation of the bavarian böllertreffen 2005 .
in many hours of volunteering , the members of the association have opened the rooms and the shooting facility in the berngau hof and have thus been updated .
eleven teams in rundencompetitions
the hotel is also well known for its sporting performance .
altogether , eleven teams are currently participating in the rundencompetitions : six air rifle teams , an air gun team , a sports pilot team and a team of runners .

merkel speaks the power word : tolls are &quot; clearly &quot; to come &quot; .
now the firm is committed to the need to do so again .
a licence for all the complicated details is , however , not .
persistent concerns from the cdu against the pkw tolls have made csu more and more vulnerable .
chancellor angela merkel has , after ongoing opposition from her cdu , taken a power word for the introduction of a car toll .
&quot; to be quite clear , it is in the coalition treaty , and it will come &quot; , said the party leader , the president of the party , after meetings of the cdu top bodies in berlin on monday .
we are proud to announce that merkel has now decided to introduce a detailed model .
in the black and red government programme , &apos; certain parameters &apos; are mentioned .
federal transport minister alexander dobrindt ( csu ) has &quot; made a proposal , and that is now being worked on &quot; .
the nrw-cdu , however , insists on its no to a toll on all roads .
merkel stressed that finance minister wolfgang schäuble ( cdu ) also makes constructive efforts to engage in discussions on a bill .
beyond the subject , he has worked with dobrindt on other ways of creating more private capital for investment in infrastructure , including in broadband .
&quot; there is nothing special about it , &quot; schäuble had a &quot; mirror &quot; on sunday uncomment .
csu chief horst seehofer warned darkened that the us would be in the cabinet to impose tolls against the lead minister .
cdu federal vize armin laschet reaffirmed his objections .
&quot; the coalition treaty never assumed that the entire circle and party members had the right to charge for the road , &quot; said the north rhine-westphalian cdu president .
in this respect , it is an important signal that seahofer has now announced that it will discuss the issue again .
opposition to the plans also comes from the cdu national associations baden württemberg and rheinland-pfalz .
the background to this is that there is a problem with tolls affecting small border traffic with neighbouring countries .
seehofer had a lot of trouble with toll criticism from the cdu coalition .
the left sees the plans as a step in the right direction in the face of the union ’ s dispute .
&quot; the murks-toll is dead , &quot; said the leader of the party , bernd riexinger , the &quot; new osnabrück zeitung &quot; ( monday ) .
&quot; with the toll the minister fails &quot; . dobrindt wants to build a vignette duty on all german roads that will start in 2016 .
domestic car owners may , according to the coalition agreement , not be additionally charged .
therefore , they should be taxed in full by means of motor tax , which is why they should receive a full compensation for tolls .
the model may however be used by foreign drivers , under eu law , not because of their nationality .
genetic disorder is often misdiagnosed , and often misdiagnosed .
a british person says she thought that as a result of a misdiagnosis , for many years , she would die .
karin rodgers lived almost her entire youth in the belief that she was only a few years to live after she had been married to another disease .
it was actually suffering from the charcot marie tooth disease ( cmt ) - a group of inherited disorders that spread the nerves outside the brain and spinal cord .
charity cmt uk announced that it is not possible to diagnose malnutrition in people with cmt , because it is so little known about this disease .
about 23,000 people in britain are likely to suffer from cmt , which may lead to motor disorders such as muscle weakness , unsafe gear , and curved toes .
sufferers also suffer from deafness sentiments or pain , and the disease is incurable and progressively , which means that symptoms are associated with time .
when rodgers 13 was , she believed that she was interested in cemetery ataxy ( ias ) - a disease with very poor survivability .
rodgers thought she would be in a wheelchair before she would 18 would , and before her 30th birthday .
the mother of two children who are 51 years old today said : &apos; as a child , i knew that i was not the same thing as the other .
i have been falling and everything took me longer .
i never could talk to other children roller skateboard or skateboard and was often overlooked at school for my own way of going and running .
rodgers said that they were 13 years old , after several operations to relieve their achilles .
&quot; i felt guilty because i was curious to see how the european union could be a better place to live .
when i received a reply , i was shocked and was terribly alarmed .
i thought i was 18 in the wheelchair , and with 25 i would die , and in between i would slowly lose all my skills .
i made all this on my own and planned to build my own funeral .
she said when she was 17 , she realized that her skills were not as strong as she had been .
he stood up and hugged the people and said that &apos; my love , i believe not , that you have that which is warmth now .
i think you have a little less life-threatening .
after some genetic tests , her cmt was found .
&quot; when he explained to me what cmt was , i felt as if i were a winner .
charity cmt uk has developed a cmt-awareness report month .
stabsfeldwebel a. d. berni diether has been working since the closure of the former training place as a fireworker since the fire worker was started .
for almost ten years , the former troop exercises in münsingen have not been shot .
nevertheless , the death toll is still appearing in the heart of the biosphere reserve .
the grenades are sometimes even so dangerous that they are exploited locally .
a earthly stubborn , horny guy hits the explosions of the heart of the biosphere reserve .
in december 2004 , the last sharp shot fell on the troop exercise square in münsingen , which was closed at the end of 2005 after 110 years of military operation .
since then , the 6500 hectares of land is the core of the biosphere reserve .
tax burden on businesspeople in the washington area is rising as the economy recovers .
economic recovery means more customers , more sales , and more jobs .
it also means higher taxes .
state and local tax regulations for companies in the country increased by slightly last year , while the economic recovery accelerated , so a newly published tax study in the past week , and the firms in the area of washington formed no exception .
distributor , maryland and virginia companies jointly paid 27,6 billion $ in government and local government and private finance .
the state and local tax burden of companies rose by 10 % last year , to eur 671 billion .
government taxes rose more than local taxes , which would reduce the rate of government spending by 4.3 % , according to the study carried out by the ernst &amp; young service agency , with the center for state taxation , a tax policy group .
more than half of the district ’ s tax revenues , 56 % , come from corporate taxes , while 36 % of maryland ’ s income comes from businesses .
virginia achieves the lowest tax revenue from companies with 28 % .
much of the increase in tax revenues is due to a recovery in real estate values among companies , say the researchers .
while a large part of these profits come from large states such as california , new york , and texas , the process seems to have been promising for the washington area as well .
district companies , maryland and virginia jointly paid more than $ 10 billion in government and local real estate taxes last year , compared to $ 9.6 billion in 2008 .
but the apparent recovery in housing values is not in maryland as effective in raising interest rates and local government spending .
companies in virginia and d.c. pay almost half of their government and local taxes in the form of real estate taxes .
&quot; in maryland happens the following : a large proportion of real estate , especially in the tax area around d.c. , is owned either by the government or by non-profit organizations that do not pay real estate taxes , &quot; said douglas lindaul lindstaatation center holm .
maryland is therefore forced to pay much more attention , for example , to income taxes in order to provide the same services that other states offer .
the recent fiscal recovery by companies can no longer be confined to the housing market ’ s recovery alone .
corporate income also seems to be recovering , according to data .
companies in the region reported about income taxes on government organisations , and the figure is 2.3 billion dollars compared to 2.1 billion in 2012 .
maryland took $ 1 billion in corporate income taxes , while the highest amount of the region .
while the trend towards the same direction is increasing , local tax burden on businesses is not increasing in all three places evenly .
the rate of increase in the district was comparable to 4.3 % in the national average , while the increase in maryland was significantly higher than in the previous year , 4.9 % .
only virginia reported an under-average tax revenue of 4.1 percent .
virginia has a strong record of 6 percent in all three areas of office , with significantly lower corporate income taxes ( in all three there are fixed corporate tax rates ) .
the corporate tax rate in maryland is 8.25 % and in the district is relatively low .
a similar study by the us chamber of commerce earlier this year showed that in virginia , lower government and local corporate taxes were required , and overall , better fiscal conditions prevailed than in maryland .
the study has identified the district as not investigating .
despite the advantages virginia is under pressure from its southern neighbour .
north carolina has adopted laws to reduce its corporate tax rates this year from 6.9 % to 6 % .
if the state continues to pursue its income targets next year , this law could reduce corporate income tax by the state by 2017 to a 3 % rate .
in the meantime , it seems that small businesses in the washington area are doing better and are paying more government and local taxes , so the recent study .
corporate taxes , which are seen as personal income taxes by small business people - a transitional structure according to which most small businesses are organized - are paid in the district , maryland and virginia last year by 20 % .
researchers say that the trend is not so great as to increase corporate taxes across the country .
nevertheless , the washington area could be lagging behind if spending cuts were to be made by the federal government on the labour market in the region .
partner city : german beer for guangzhou ( guangzhou )
hops and malt - also in china a popular combination .
german beer enjoys a high reputation in china .
frankfurt ’ s partner city in china now wants a brewery and hopes for a direct flight connection between the two cities .
german beer , used in frankfurt &apos;s partner city guangzhou .
&quot; we would be very pleased if a german brewery could establish itself in our city , &quot; said the vice-party secretary of the south chinese metropolis , li yidwei , in this week &apos;s visit to a spd delegation .
time and again , the director ’ s official came to the attention of the chinese government during the course of the conversation .
guangzhou , which is also canton in germany , is one of the richest cities in china , warb li .
therefore , people would also have the purchasing power to buy german beer .
the hessian spd chairman thorsten schäfer-gümbel , who is the lead of the german political delegation , said to the host that he would seek a possible partner for the project in germany .
&quot; for beer , it doesn &apos;t take much : good water , grain and joy of life , &quot; he added at lunch with the party leader .
this joy of life is already blasting out mr li , he flattered to the host .
the first group of the party of european socialists was elected in january 2001 .
the chinese brand tsingtao is based on german brewing .
tsingtao beer is produced according to the german purity law .
more business
a second wish of chinese hosts would be a direct flight connection between frankfurt and guangzhou , said vice party chief and vice president li .
lufthansa had offered the flight earlier , but in 2012 for economic reasons it was cancelled .
&quot; it would be worth it again &quot; , the municipal politician was convinced .
&quot; the business transactions between our two cities are growing ever further &quot; .
at present , travellers would have to pay the detour via changsha in hunan province , li complained .
the administration of guangdong province , whose capital is guangzhou , also hopes for the airport connection .
the vice-governor of the province , chen yunxian , put this desire to his conversation with the social democrats .
&quot; this is a very good idea &quot; , schäfer-gümbel replied - the chinese vice minister li jinjun , an intimate connoisseur of germany , nodded in agreement .
well-maintained partnership
the lifeless vice-president of the party , guangzhou hoping that the election will bring about a successful outcome in frankfurt next year .
li yiwei was already in the main but not yet in this function .
he came to the office only this year , after his predecessor was arrested for corruption charges .
the local leader of the party wan qinglian also had to go .
the action against officials from guangzhou is part of a nationwide campaign against corruption in the party and administration , which is being led by head of state xi jinping with tough force .
the new leader li yiwei had promised to leave the country before his party career .
before taking office in guangzhou , he was the top official in the fujian community , where the car manufacturer had to pay a large amount of work .
frankfurt is officially more than a dozen partner cities .
the connection to the 9000 km distant guangzhou is one of those that can be maintained from both sides , for example with a student exchange .
last year , the 25-year-old german chinese association was celebrated .
the south chinese metropolis on the river perl is connected with its economic strength almost as strong as hessen .
next year , it wants to set a gross domestic product of eur 250 billion , reported the commission &apos;s report .
the family of joan rivers &quot; expresses the thumbs &quot; of &quot; the &quot; and &quot; the &quot; the &quot; .
joan rivers has been a member of the hospital since she was delivered to a hospital in new york city three days ago ; her daughter today felt hopeless that the 81-year-old comic was coming from her sickness .
&quot; thank you for your continued love and support , &quot; said melissa rivers today in a communication .
we are all pushing our fingers .
her mother was found on thursday after an emergency due to heart failure in a clinic at the upper east coast .
doctors will keep you informed on an intentional basis and under close observation until you are satisfied with your condition , which remains known as &quot; serious &quot; .
the reactions came from many quarters , including in the form of an overwhelming online support from donald tump , montel williams and kelly ripa .
environmentally friendly vacuum cleaners and rising wages are the key to our success .
for cars and vacuum cleaners , which are now on sale , the stricter environmental standards will apply in future .
like refrigerators and washing machines , new vacuum cleaners will be supplied to a label on which the buyer can place a central data , such as the energy efficiency of the equipment at a glance .
for new cars , the pollutant class euro 6 is the most stringent nitrogen oxide .
there is also more money for scaffolding manufacturers : they receive a uniform minimum wage across germany of eur 10.25 .
amazon buys twitch for 1.04 billion $
amazon confirmed just now what information is on monday morning .
the announcement comes as a surprise , not because no one has accepted twitch , but because it is widely believed that the yoda program will be the company .
three months ago , it looked as if the sale of twitch to the video service of google was for a cool billion .
twitch , which was launched three years ago as justin.tv , was a general streaming service .
instead , it quickly became a platform for players who want to see their bravura items released in games , a &quot; youtube for live games &quot; , so an insider .
the twitch interface .
and &apos; let &apos;s play &apos; , a video genre , in which better known is the ( usually older ) play a role .
it is just that youtube is often called , but when you use twitch , you can see that the message you want youtube to use is that you want to buy something .
it is a mystery why the deal with yooutputsube did not come about , because the company reportedly was willing to pay as much as amazon .
all we are talking about at the moment is this statement by emmet shar , president of twitch : &apos; we have been committed to amazon .
another secret is , frankly , the incredible success of twitch .
for snobs like me who explain that they prefer to practice sports than watch , it is difficult to find the attraction .
it is one thing to tell a friend at 3 o &apos;clock in the morning , while they walk through resident evil , and they are something quite different , a spinning .
all these games could be viewed right now .
another problem is that many of the most popular games today are ego games , so you can only watch without your own control over the perspective .
i admit that the quickest possible procedures for the european union &apos;s roger bannisters are not being followed up by the rest of the games in record time .
but until a game or humorous game is present , it is not possible to use its twitch channel .
but what do sceptics like me know ?
twitch is supported by 55 million different visitors per month and is the fourth largest source of internet traffic tips .
and how exactly does amazon want to make money out of it ?
it is difficult to imagine that twitch is as elegant as amazon instant video .
but twitch has something that every company would like : thousands of young men who are advertising customers .
as the president of twitch , shar , said , amazon and twitch &quot; both believe in the future of gaming , &quot; and this medium shows no signs of a weak economy .
on the hüpfburg at the castle garden festival , things were going on saturday .
the concept of the organizer was right .
despite the strong rainfall on saturday evening , some 10,000 people came to the town to the open air festival .
at times , the entrance had to be stopped .
&quot; that was annoying , &quot; ron sem , one of the organizers said .
salwedell light and fun .
two spanish words have made maxim sachraj and ron sem the name amula .
the open air in the salwedeler burggarten is supposed to show brightness in the day and in the evening through various shows .
well , and the fun comes anyway from alone .
this was evident at the early saturday when the first visitors came to the open air .
a festival for all generations had the organizers promised .
and they have succeeded .
around the supply levels on the burggarten meadow , salwedeler and also guests from the near and further surroundings had a pleasant time .
they followed the first live performances in the world , they rocked with the foot in the clock , enjoyed cool drinks - in short : pure relaxation and enjoyment were the order of the day .
and the whole of the generations .
while some people are on blankets on the extra carroted white sand on the beach bar , others are on the beach in a quarter of wine in the labten vinotheque , the young man was raging on the hip .
but even when children ’ s make-up was made , the volunteers had , in the truest sense of the word , every hand to help the crowd get the chance to get the best out of their imagination .
the larger used the kickertables or took part in a skateboard workshop , which the goodfood-crew had taken out of salzwedel .
until the great rain came .
just before 5.30 p.m. , he proudly proudly prouded to visitors , especially families looking for the wide and dry .
but the attractiveness of the festival did not break it off .
&quot; more people came than expected , &quot; said ron sem , who was accompanied by a &quot; success on the whole line &quot; .
that is why i am not in favour of a repeat of the great party next year .
although the content and size of the event are still to be worked on , sem made a first record on sunday in comparison with the popular vote .
it is a bit annoying that in the meantime the entrance has been stopped .
obviously , the security firm was not booked with enough force .
the result : some who had already paid did not get back to the terrain .
the response is very good .
in a first cautious estimate , the saltwater co-organizer spoke of about 1200 visitors who were in the castle garden .
there were problems with the sound technology .
the salty wetter hip-hop band blocks`n`rox broke their appearance therefore unnervt .
the technicians were unable to produce a reasonably sensible sound .
the planned shisha lounges could not be built because the tents were not opened due to a tyre crash .
&quot; next year , however , you will be there , &quot; says the organizer .
the premiere of the amula-open-air was attended by the number of visitors more than succeeded .
and this in bad weather .
however , the organizers made some mistakes which were not corrected for the first time , but at the second edition the organizers have to be removed .
the social network facebook also has to criticise the organizers .
&quot; sorry , but for twelve euros you simply expected more , &quot; says the author melanie meier .
&quot; you &apos;ve got a little bit of it , &quot; says ele zimmermann at the same place .
others see the initial problems not as closely as they are .
i think it is very good that some people are not only stupid , but also really are trying to get something on their feet .
hats off ! &quot; , stephanie writes that to amula .
now the organizers have one year to make these criticisms .
new radom in berkum : watchberg &apos;s landmark is shrinking .
this is not as expected .
instead , the ready part is waiting for the distinctive construction to be used .
the action is in the context of a larger measure : almost 50 years after the establishment of the space observation radar tira , the case called radom is completely renewed .
the new radom is equipped with a diameter of 47.5 meters a little smaller than the old one .
the size is still world record , however .
the last step to complete the new envelope is the cappella exchange .
the upper area of the old shell is separated and covered with a crane .
after that , the last quarter of the new shell is set up .
if the weather is a part of the action , the action will be taken on stage at the beginning of this week .
participants at the ice bus stop in the city center will be able to take advantage of the opportunity to get to know the city and its surroundings .
isabelle roberts from the uk screamed so much as her ice-cold water was over her head .
these ice bucket challs are the most painful and painful of them .
a woman was taken to hospital after she was taken to the ice bucket-challenge .
isabelle roberts from the uk created the same thing as her ice-cold water was over the head .
&quot; the water was so cold that i shouted , and while i did , the water remained my jaw simply stand , &quot; she said to the mirror .
ice water is used over the 20 years .
isabelle roberts a few seconds before the accident , was killed in a car accident in the city of roberts .
i wanted to close my mouth , but that was not possible , the jaw was hated , and then i understood that something was not correct .
my mother and sister saw it and made their way to laughter almost into the pants , but i had to go to the emergency room .

the burgverein will soon be pulling together again ?
most recently there were repeated disputes between the two wolfratshauser burgvereine .
now the boards think about possible cooperation .
as a model for the reconstruction of the wolfratshauser castle , the late richard dichath , former president of the church of wolfratshauser burgfreunde , led the project in french guédelon .
a year ago , there was no good climate between the burgverein and the burgfreien wolfratshausen friends .
the two countries of the european union had to be very different from each other .
now the two camps are moving up : we are about to have talks on a common approach .
this is confirmed by the club &apos;s board torsten sjöberg ( burgverein ) and herbert piffl ( friends of the burgfreunde ) on request of our newspaper .
&quot; i have written to mr piffl and suggested that we should sit down together , &quot; says sjöberg .
he believes that all members of both clubs could in future be in the same position .
this allows for rapid visible success .
while the friends of the castle were fighting for the suddenly deceased richard dimbath until the last time , the castle at the mountain forest was being rebuilt , the burgverein um sjöberg is the &quot; experience and experience &quot; .
herbert piffl , the second chairman of the burgfreunde group , has been very pleased to receive the call , according to his own information .
since dimbathi &apos;s death he has been standing before the burgfriends .
a new chairman is due to be elected in a general meeting in mid-september .
at the moment , the association counts about 40 members according to the 74-year-old .
&quot; after the death of my friend richard dichath , we have the association activities in the form of respect .
according to piffl , the new chairman should then enter into the discussion with the burgverein .
until then , burghers could also download a current mood picture within their grouping .
to nominate a candidate for the presidency is not yet available , says piffl .
&quot; but i am confident that someone will find themselves &quot; , he himself does not want to stand because he has his residence in bad tölz .
the new chairman should be a wolfratshauser .
the tölzer wool on the project &quot; but very happy to continue working &quot; .
the different positions on reconstruction will be difficult to understand in the eyes of piffls .
he is a tribute to dimbath as a missionary , who has always believed in the reconstruction of the castle .
two similar , already well advanced projects in austria and france would show that the latter is not a buzzword .
the high turnout of the population and the voluntary help from all over the world make them a tourist attraction .
piffl : &quot; i too was at the beginning sceptical .
but over time i am more and more convinced that the european union is making sense of the project .
there are nothing else .
moreover , the project would be supported by eu grants , visitor tickets and potential sponsors .
&quot; the idea of reconstruction is something i personally do not want to throw out , &quot; he hopes that the burghers will be able to do something about this .
their aim , first documenting history , &quot; is important and good &quot; .
then we could go on .
clever ways to save money at uni-textbooks .
since the costs of uni-textbooks for many students exceed $ 1,000 a year , the university ’ s fast-second semester considered the costs of the university .
he invented a loan system for books of students of higher semesters and offered a nominal compensation to help them find their way back .
&quot; my mathematics book normally costs $ 180 , but i got it for $ 10 for a semester and a chip movie .
the time allocated for the last semester should have given him $ 430 , he said .
he gave $ 120 .
the college management shared the responsibility of the student in average of more than 1.200 $ per year for textbooks and study materials , that there is no need for different cost increases for the students .
online stores and creative approaches are the key to success .
renting textbooks is becoming more popular , and students can book a book semester long .
neebo inc , which has more than 250 university books , is one of the leading companies in the world for the rental of textbooks since 2011 .
polls in the industry show that around a quarter of the books in the college books are in circulation last spring .
less than half of all textbooks are published by the national association of colleges and colleges in campus bookshops .
here is the one-time bet for the best deals .
online shopping
some new books cost just one third of the price online , for which they are available in campus bookshop .
the ninth edition of &quot; calculus &quot; vno ron larwon , bruce edwards and robert hothetler cost almost 290 $ , but can be found at the specialized booksellers chegg.com .
used buy used buy
if you don &apos;t like the notes of other or normal usage tracks , you can use them for the first time .
&quot; calculus &quot; is used on chegg.com for 93.49 $ to have .
matt casday , 25 , graduate student at the brigham young university , uk , says that he is on amazon.com 42 cents .
the book has been sold for $ 48 .
academics like ingrid bracey , head of the university of massachusetts at the amherst college vienna , have been working on the new york times since the beginning of the 20th century .
sometimes the updates are not available for the seminar work .
in such cases , older spending can often be spent for a fraction of the cost of the latest issue .
except chegg and amazon , half.com is also available from ebay inc . , a popular alternative for used books .
rent a house in the algarve , spain .
renting textbooks is a consideration worth considering if you want to make it reasonably good , remember to use them back and you want to search the books after the course has been completed .
you can earn more than 80 percent of the cost of a new book .
a student could , for example , use &quot; calculus &quot; for a semester for about $ 20 .
find out more about the terms of business where you rent , even about the penalty fees , which may be applicable to writing tickets .
renters pay attention : if you don &apos;t want to return the book , the penalty fees may include the price of a new book .
e-books
e-books instead of conventional teaching books are also an option .
sometimes these books are de facto rented by electronic licenses for a certain period of time by wholesalers such as amazon.com , chegg and barnes &amp; noble inc. . .
at chegg you can choose &quot; calculus &quot; for 6 months for about $ 61 .
bracey says that students in literature courses often have the best offers , as many classical literature students are downloaded for free today , while scientific and engineering students are free to use the most expensive textbooks .
in any case , look around .
joe gault , 29 , who will soon be the pepperdine law school , will recommend that you take a look at the isbn number for the price determination of books , because you can be so sure of the right book .
and before ordering online , check how gault can be used to make sure the book is in stock .
this lesson was learned from the hard tour .
he bought a book that was four weeks delivery time and paid for the full price in the collectie bookshop .
why guardians of the galaxy ? no cashier ?
&quot; the expendables 3 &quot; by sylvester stallone played less than 30 million dollars of his $ 90 million budget in the us .

an article of the telegraph film critic robbie collin suggests that the film is not the same as the lack of quality in the films .
collin called 2014 &quot; the worst year &quot; so far for children &apos;s films , and described &quot; drachenzähmen made easy 2 &quot; as purely &quot; functional &quot; fantasy sequel .
in films for a slightly older target group , however , it seems that the quality of the films is not necessarily the problem .
in july , entertainment weekly compared the same number of people who had previously lived in cinemascores and metacritic for each summer movie start , which was filmed between the american memorial day and july 20 , 2013 .
the results are based on the opinion of the cinema visitors and film critics and indicate that the film is not going to be shown to the film hits of last year .
some commentators believe that developments are changing in the way we see and the growing popularity of web streaming services .
director jon favreau , who is currently working on disney ’ s upcoming jungle book film , is saying to the site hungelbuch .
we have to accept this and not try to follow the past .
unlike the current weak csf results , the hollywood productions have yielded a significant increase in revenue recently .
last summer , the director criticized steven spielberg for not having been able to make a huge impact on film productions by comics .
in the light of the current downturn , some commentators argue that its gloomy prophecy is a true core .
due to the global financial crisis that we expect in the summer of 2015 , including avengers : age of ultron , minions and jurassic world , other representatives of the film industry are more optimistic :
the producer of x-men , simon kinberg , described the decline in the cash outcomes recently as simple &quot; cyclical &quot; and said to hollywood records .
when the second table tennis tournament was held in the district of munich some years ago , for the tightening of the liga division , this is a step in the right direction .
now the german table tennis federation has an additional 3rd bundesliga .
the consequence : those who did not rise have dropped .
göttingen has , for example , set the highest class team torpedo in the oberliga release , but it is still playing a major role in the coming season .
fourthly , torpedo ladies remain , despite their grandiose march through the regional league .
the boys and girls of torpedo start in the lower saxony league , as well as the boys of the sc weenend .
sg lenglern and the torpedo reserve are in the new verbandsliga .
the ladies play the ttv geismar in the association league .
what is different from the composition is a better district class , now the new district class .
here tsv seulingen , vfb lödingsen , torpedo iii , geismar , ebeck , hammenstedt , bovender sv , langenholtensen , the fc .
the district sliga is a regional representative , and the city is a place where the sc weende plays , in the district class of ttc ii , red-white , bovender sv ii and the team of ttv geitv ii .
güntersen , the ttc and the ttv geismar ii are represented here with the game .
the district sliga is home to torpedo iii and sattenhausen / wöllmarshausen .
with nine teams each with nine teams each , the most recent is the last one with nine teams in nine .
the sc weende sends his girls to the small district sliga .
the district sliga staffel of the scw boys also starts there .
in a county class , hogismar , tuspo weende and bovender sv are going to the season .
in the first season of the newly established regional association , the first two gods start the first round with a nine team each .
in the west season , the red cross and white ii , bovender sv iii , laubach ii , torpedo iv and the v , mtv grone , dransfeld sc ii , mielhausen .
in the east season , the most important play is sadtenhausen / wöllmarshausen , nikolausberg and landolfshausen .
the ladies &apos; slide consists of saddenhausen / wöllmarshausen ii , bilshausen , hemeln , seulingen ii , tuspo weende and the sg rhume .
that is still better than in the osterode region , where it is not possible to have women teams at all on the itinerary level .
it is striking that none of the six 2nd classes should be reached , but the first step is to develop the innovative and exhilarating circle board .
nato summit : first protests in newport and cardiff

hütteldorfer after second season victory in place three of the table .
2 : 0 on grödig has been a bizarre week on sunday for rapide .
&quot; the victory is very liberating , &quot; said trainer zoran baric , whose team with the out in europe leader , on thursday a meeting in the middle of the race .
&quot; the success experience was unheeded , &quot; he confirmed .
schrammel-dreamtor brings rapid to siegerstraße rapid has started the second season victory the right response to the disappointment against helsinki and goes with a success goal .
&quot; we wanted to show a positive response , &quot; said outsider thomas schrammel , who with his splendid leadership volley of the sixteenth century was able to win the way to victory .
&quot; i thought i had a look at the frustration of thursday and i was getting a little bit of a bit of a rough chase &quot; , said the 26-year-old smile .
as a smash on the 13th novmember 2010 , for the last time in a bundesliga game , the result was still very good for ried .
the first championship meeting in the rapid-dress will be held in special memory .
&quot; for me , this is something very special , i am from the rapid newcomer &quot; , said schrammel .
due to the short term beck-blower of mario pavelic , schrammel moved from the left to the right defensive side and made the right side of the coin very good .
he has enough experience to take this position on a mirror-inverted basis .
the gate has earned it , he has already won several assists this year , &quot; praised barisic .
team shows character schrammel also provided the flank to 2 : 0 through court mansion after good one hour , which finally took the decision .
because we could have been writing to the guests before that .
&quot; thank god , we have been lucky today , &quot; he also noticed .
barisic even found that it was &quot; in many games before , better than it is today &quot; - against &quot; the strongest team , which is in the season at this stadium &quot; .
the first three-point limit since july 26 has therefore proved that the team &apos;s structure is the setback for the fight .
for him , it is no less pleasing : &apos; that we finally played again to zero &apos; .
a lot of work during the country break also the fact that with brian behrendt , mario pavelic , christian rosner and others , we are able to offer our services .
&quot; we must not forget this , &quot; baritas warned , who was in the last three days with behrendt and pavelic players .
the country break must be made sufficient to allow the country to &quot; wound &quot; and to stay in the physical area a little bit &quot; , explained baritas .
one of the reasons why the break is so important is that captain hofmann .
it is tearing up for the team , going beyond pain and pain .
it is precisely at this difficult stage that he has shown that he is a very important player for us , &quot; said barisic .
hofmann gave the game rapid before it was replaced in the 68th minute not only the structure but achieved a good result .
for the 33-year-old who has been to the 350 league , the team was able to win the first match from the game since 2 november 2013 ( 4 : 2 on the admira ) .
hofmann : &quot; may not believe that now everything is good &quot; &quot; we certainly also have a bit of luck , but eventually must be luck also to us .
it is now high time , &quot; said hofmann .
he warned , however , that we should continue to work in a concentrated way : &apos; we must not always see this in black and white &apos; .
we have seen no progress in recent weeks as badly as has been made .
however , we must not believe that everything is now good .
the importance of his role for the team was not disputed .
it is a very young team that i have been very helpful to me at the moment .
they are in some stages , but i think they are not .
grödig coach michael baur and his team had little to blame .
he regretted the rapid &quot; opposite &quot; from the category magician &quot; , as well as the regular gate of nutz at the 40th minute , which was taken over by referees collegiate unfairly .
the only accusation i have heard from the team is that we are heading towards the goal in some phases not concrete enough .
we have not achieved enough .
interior defender maximilian karner saw it similarly : &quot; it started badly , then we started to find in and even made a gateway .
by and large , it would have been more .
under this whirlpool , the rest reigns .
a powerful tribe we showed in our puzzle task of the summer series &quot; my play of the rhönner luck &quot; last friday .
several of these tree giants are still in the county , the illustrated copy is the &quot; spiritual scourge &quot; .
a bumpy walk leads up to the 600 years old eiger .
it goes past couples , basalt stones and the caves of basalt .
a little below the stone age from the farmer &apos;s mountain , one kilometre north of the road to weisbach , it stands there .
vital is the natural monument , it is a place of peace and quiet over the other trees of the surrounding area .
a small buddha on a tree-stump indicates that there are two different kinds of spiritual or mystical places .
but , despite intensive research , there were only indications of the name origin .
dr. wolfgang schneider has additionally visited the bishops ’ archive and has invited older people from unterweißenbrunn to learn what their family is doing with the scourge .
the result of his research was the rather sober explanation for the name .
so , by about 80 years ago , goat shepherds were supposed to feed their animals from underweißenbrunn to the laboriously rolled and cleared meadows .
at the foot of the tree , the vines covered by the rise should be used to rest .
meanwhile , the sector has regained its importance , as the pastures are in fact once again pastures of goats .
the area is also the core of the biosphere reserve of the biosphere reserve , schneider has further found out .
when entering the stone collections , you should be careful , however , to avoid the damage caused by the sun .
a hiking trail leads from unterweißenbrunn to the tree , which is hidden .
other routes are signposted , the direction of high-altitude is up and down to a vast plateau .
where is the water castle ?
a watercastle which will be built in our next task is in the height rather rare .
the reflection in the moat gives a good impression of the building , but we have some historical buildings in the county , including the building counterpart .
where is our &quot; piece of the rhönner luck &quot; ?

after weeks of tug-of-war , italy ’ s premier and president-in-office of the eu , matteo renzi , has protested against strong conservative opposition at last week ’ s eu special summit .
renzi sees the government as a daily newspaper la reputation , and the government is also looking at the vocation of his own people , who are also favored in the government team .
it also expects this to be a boost for its &apos; reform package &apos; in italy .
last but not least , renzi hopes that the recurrent opposition to him will also be able to remain calm .
the conservative representatives of president jean-claude juncker and the council president , who is elected as president of the council , will be called donald tusk , according to the prevailing opinion in rome , so that political balance can be achieved .
the chief diplomat of the eu will be deputy of the president of the commission , mr juncker .
the outstanding agreement of the european parliament is considered to be safe .
otherwise , president giorgio napolitano would have rejected the nomination of the 41th anniversary of the leader of the democratic party ( pd ) .
la repubblica spreads optimism that the reforms that have been taking place in leading party offices for almost two decades will be a mughal success for the &quot; enormous challenges &quot; that are known for their ambition .
the native romans are married and have two children .
her party career began with the doctorate of political scientist in 1996 at the youth organization of the then democratici di sinistra ( left-democrats ) , which was established in 2008 with the catholic center party .
in 1999 , mogherini was vice-president of the european community for three years of socialism and social development ( european youth socialist organisation ) .
with the 2001 election to the linksdemocrats ’ party council , it moved to the high party politics , worked in the foreign policy department , whose head it was soon appointed .
she occupied traditional focal points of italian foreign policy , such as the middle east , was replaced by studies on nato operations in afghanistan , where italy was stationed with a contingent of troops , and maintained contacts with social democrats in europe and elsewhere .
since 2008 she has been a member of the chamber of deputies , in which she is an expert on defence and european and international affairs .
when renzi was elected prime minister in february 2014 , he appointed mogherini as his foreign minister .
if the pd is to have a better relationship with the strong peace movement in the country today , which is one of the party &apos;s more than 40 % votes in may &apos;s eu elections , then , as in pd circles , it has remarked .
the commission is not aware of the accusations in brussels that the new eu foreign affairs agency has too little diplomatic experience , so there is no substance in the pd .
in brussels , the most important of these is the poles and the baltic members , who are suspiciously putting forward realistic priorities for mogherinis about the crisis in ukraine and are described as a &apos; pro-russia course &apos; .
it supports the efforts made by the russian company gazprom sowing stream , which is being discussed by the russian gas company in bypassing ukraine .
after renzi left office in july as eu president , he was ready to travel to the united states .
photos you can share with putin at shake-hands are now being taken in brussels with outrage , as are the fact that they have not yet been able to convince the kremlin chief to hold a milan economic summit .

the socialists in france should &apos; stop the mouth and let france get it right &apos; , said the main ally of francois hollande .
mr valls called for the deeply divided left to vote against the report .
the president deserves everyone &apos;s respect , he deserves our loyalty , he deserves our support .
&quot; it is our duty to stand shoulder to shoulder , &quot; he said with great applause .
as a appeasement , the prime minister insisted that his government should not allow the controversial 35-hour week in france , despite strong calls for a relaxation of the rules by emmanuel madeleine .
on saturday , mr hollande had urged his fellow socialists to &apos; unite &apos; with the government .
but christiane taubira , the minister for justice , is streaming sand into the gearbox , in which she is playing at a meeting of disguised socialist members .
marine le pen , which is far right in the national front , is mocked by the constant trench fighting of the socialists and said that she was unsure about the future of the new valls government .
francois hollande is the emperor without clothes , but prince manuel valls also has no , they are forced to build a new government , if the old one is not even over a summer .
&quot; and the new one will also not survive the autumn or winter , &quot; said mr. le pen in respect of supporters .
she repeated the call of her party for a dissolution of parliament and said she was confident that , in early elections , she would win .
the ruling party of france suffered a severe setback in the local elections .
a survey in sunday newspaper journal , du dimanche , showed that 76 percent of french people believe that the european union is the only way to protect their interests .
pascal perrineau , a political scientist at sciences po university , warned that the us would not be able to solve the patience quickly .
&quot; there is a small window for possibilities , but public opinion must feel quickly that the things change , &quot; warned him .
otherwise , the situation could deteriorate further .

putin is demanding kiev to include &quot; state and government talks &quot; with the east ukraine .
russian president vladimir putin demanded that russian media reports show that on sunday , the ukrainian government was going to stop fighting the separatists in the east of the country and immediately start negotiations on the &apos; statehood &apos; of the armament .
his spokesman dimitri peskov later made it clear that putin was not referring to the fact that the country was under the control of the separatist region of eastern ukraine .
putin ’ s call to the kiev government to negotiate on an equal footing with pro-russian insurgents , however , fits in with the view he has taken five months since the start of the riots five months ago : help for the iraqis .
in an interview with the state television channel eins , putin condemned the ukrainian government &apos;s military campaign to reconquer the region &apos;s occupied territories .
the kremlin and the separatists have recently adopted the land they have taken as &apos; novorosija &apos; or &apos; neussia &apos; , a term that is reminiscent of pre-revolutionary splendour of the russian empire .
putin pointed out that the whole of those who were arrested in the course of the ukrainian politicians ’ campaigns for the elections on 26 october , and while government groups were supporting civil communities in the separatists ’ areas , the government was not .
&quot; we need to start detailed discussions immediately , not only on technical issues , but also on the political organisation of society and the state status of south-east ukraine in order to protect the interests of the people living there , &quot; he said .
peskov said that putin ’ s reference to the state of the country in the context of greater autonomy would have to be seen , which has been ignored for months by kiev ’ s leadership to dispel fears in russian-speaking areas .
only the ukrainian government can help the eastern regions to achieve the necessary autonomy , peskov said .
this is not a question of negotiations between ukraine and russia , said peskov , &apos; because it is not a conflict between russia and ukraine , but a conflict between russia and ukraine &apos; .
the clarification of the kremlin &apos;s speaker to correct the &apos; misinterpretation &apos; of putin &apos;s regime of remarks underlined the leadership claim of russia in dealing with the separatist rebellion in the east , unlike the direct opposition .
moscow could have experienced far greater difficulties in getting the donetsk and luhansk regions in eastern ukraine .
the autonomy that russian diplomats claim at international fora is not going to give regional governments in ukraine full power .
the agreement that was annexed five months ago in the black sea is the home port of the european union for most of the russian navy and an important trading port and historic coastal region .
the regions between the rostov region in russia and the crimea are also rich in mines , factories and foundries , which are important components for the russian military .
the ukrainian president petro poroshenko proposed in his speech on january 7 , that the government should be able to apply ukrainian legislation - after new elections - on the constitution .
but his notion of autonomy seems to be in sharp contrast to that of the kremlin and the separatist rebels , whose armament and outburst are motivated by moscow .
putin ’ s last call to kiev to start separatist leaders on an equal footing is a response to the recent visit by the us to the rebels .
russia &apos;s separatists are now taking over the country in a handshake , which , according to the fears of ukrainian security officials , is the first step in a campaign to take over the strategic coastal region to crimea .
that is why massive civilian and military preparations are needed .
poroshenko spoke at a meeting of eu leaders in brussels on saturday and urged action to prevent another russian aggression .
&quot; we are on the verge of a point where there is no longer any backward , &quot; warned poroshenko .
thousands of foreign troops and hundreds of foreign tanks are now on the territory of ukraine .
the eu summit did not take any concrete action to demand leadership from the eu and the eu member states to impose further sanctions on russia , which would lead to an unspecified escalation of the ukrainian crisis .
ukrainian soldiers had to move away from their positions in ilowajsk after two russian tank colonies and 1,000-soldiers were killed in the donetsk region last week .
the first probably 63 ukrainian soldiers who were killed by the russian invasion of ilowajsk were sent to the russian army on sunday .
nude photo scandal around australian celebrities and gabi grecko .
geoffrey &apos;s finest hints were not so great as to hide his anger over hackers , who probably had the nude images of his promised gabi grecko and a who is the a-celebrities from hollywood .
the film city is in excitement after a series of clear photos of a naked jennifer lawrence in a hackingschandal around promilis in the internet .
the hawk responsible for this is probably having 60 nude photos of lawrence , star from &quot; the tribes of panem &quot; and of superstars .
the australian actresa palmer , emily browning , yvonne strahovski , and grecko from melbourne were also supposed to have taken private photos as a result of an icloud .
the list contains 101 celebrities .
the most noble who spent last month with grecko , said to conferiential : &quot; it &apos;s contradictory . &quot;
all private letters and images should remain private .
it is a shame that private information has been stolen and passed on to others .
grecko , currently in new york , reportedly said that a news website that the hack &quot; shameful &quot; and that the people affected &quot; injured &quot; .
the hacker probably has 30 images of palmer with her ex-friend scott speedman , including two shots in which she has been up without a pool .
the film works of palmers include &quot; love is invincible &quot; with liam hemsworth .
palmer , chuck-star strahovski and the actress browning from sucker punch were yesterday for comments on the hacked images not available .
a representative lawrence said to tmz : &quot; there is a waste of time and money in the private sphere . &quot;
actors seth rogen condemned the hacker in his tweet : &quot; hacked and uncaptured images from a mobile phone is nothing different from the sale of hhehlerware . &quot;
from a purely legal point of view , the redistribution of stolen images should not be tolerated .
cyclists , joggers and hikers were present at the 8th bike race on the big feldberg yesterday and thus won the &quot; help for cancer children &quot; association .
the tour , which is a tortur for some , was a lightweight training for others .
in one , however , everyone agreed that it was fun .
thomas studanski was probably well slept last night .
for the first time in his life , the head of the oberursel brewery was in the middle of yesterday with his bike on the feldberg .
for the good cause .
the small muscle coatings can be easily stuck away , especially as he is not allowed to participate in the 8th bike on the big feldberg in favour of the association &quot; help for cancer children &quot; ( frankfurt ) .
a great thing .
&quot; i now know that i can do this - great ! &quot;
small brush on the way in the apple-curve ?
nee , once i had stopped , would have been from .
as thomas studanski , who is responsible for the cdu in the upper ursel-urban parliament , is agonising many of the 718 participants yesterday in spring and came to the exhaustion close , but happy .
others , by contrast , found it easier to reach the 11-kilometre route between hohemark and feldberg .
norman dießner , for example .
the red , white , green and red green politician is the first to be elected in the european parliament .
he is also the route in a slide , as is nina kuhn , pressesprecher of the city of oberursel , who together with frank grüeisen started to do .
for the two triathletes the &quot; feldberg cycling &quot; was not necessarily a sporting challenge : &quot; here &apos;s the question of charity , because we are happy to be there - a way out would be already possible today .
on the way they had paul wenzel from oberreifenberg .
the young ( 12 ) was in the morning to oberursel to get back to the height immediately after that .
the frankfurt florian ornamental had a meeting at 9 a.m. at home in the morning .
i also had fun &quot; frittentoni &quot; .
for the head of the oberursel kultkiosk , cycling tours across the feldberg are just one of them .
he had a very good record with his 6,5 kilo racing bike .
a crazy event .
for this purpose - i am happy to be there &quot; , andreas balzke said .
the durable mainzer says of itself that the mainzer is an &quot; ambitious racing bike &quot; .
he must be , because he was not satisfied with the &quot; fixie wheel &quot; , which is not the same as racing bikes , but without a circuit ...
the fact that it is easy to go up without a wheel , not only the 20 hikers who climb the white wall and the foothills of the mountain climb up , but also a jogger who takes part in a cord .
mountain guard doctor professor volker lischke , the chief medical officer of the university of vienna , who is equipped with his team , with all-wheel bully and quad , said : &quot; the kenn &quot; i from frankfurt , trained .
the 718 participants - and with them as many as never before - were in groups on the track in the morning .
the hikers first arrive at 9.30 a.m.
the first cyclists and runners followed at 10 am .
five minutes later , the first mountain bikers started to go .
bent hansen , chairman of the association &quot; cycling on the big feldberg &quot; , gave the start commands and wished the participants a nice trip .
for next year , he hopes that it will succeed in turning the line up to feldberg to the safety of the participants .
