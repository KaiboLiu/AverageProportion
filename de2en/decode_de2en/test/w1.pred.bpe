the prime ministers of india and japan have met with the chinese government in to@@ ky@@ o .
as a result , india ’ s new prime minister nar@@ end@@ ra mod@@ i is making a very important foreign visit since his first major visit to india since his election victory in may .
mr mo@@ di is in the same situation as a fi@@ ve-@@ day trip to japan to try to improve economic relations with the third largest economy in the world .
plans for a stronger core technical cooperation are very high on the agenda .
reports suggest that the country hopes to achieve a treaty to combat the use of military force between the two nations .
police of kar@@ r@@ ath , the leader of the state of kar@@ ra@@ th@@ a , arrested 20 years after fast motor@@ cycle hun@@ ting .
a motor@@ cycle was described as conf@@ is@@ c@@ ated after the driver had been forced to drive it at 12@@ 5 km / h in a 70 km / h zone and by bus@@ h@@ land to help the police in bil@@ bar@@ a .
traffic police is a very important part of the city .
the police report that the police have been att@@ acking the stops .
the motor@@ cycle and a person who is the description of the driver are not allowed to drive in the house .
the police of kar@@ r@@ ath are compla@@ ining that a 20@@ -@@ year-@@ old man has not been given a signal and that he has been rec@@ k@@ less .
he is due to be released on 23 september in the district court in kar@@ ra@@ th@@ a .

ri@@ ch@@ t@@ in lady ra@@ e put the negotiating table on the table for 17 november .
re@@ funds are not a matter of personal responsibility , but of the very american ideal of labour rights as a human rights ide@@ ology .
the congress hall is the largest conference venue for the world trade organization , with the participation of ke@@ ith el@@ lis@@ on and john le@@ w@@ is as a member of the congress .
&quot; so , as trade unions die , even the mid@@ d@@ le-@@ class jobs die , &quot; said el@@ li@@ son , a demo@@ kr@@ at from min@@ n@@ es@@ ot@@ a and depu@@ ty prime minister of the pro@@ gres@@ sive c@@ au@@ c@@ us in congress .
therefore , i am proud to present , together with the citizens &apos; initiative , john le@@ w@@ is , the staff authorisation act .
this railway breaking project is a source of inspiration for workers in the same legal way as it does for trade unions to be organised as for other forms of discrimination - and thus stops anti-@@ trade forces .
the addition of the national labour law is a way of ensuring that the labour market is discrimin@@ ated against , in order to organise a trade union representation , in order to appeal to a civil court - and to prevent damage .
but it is with certainty not a radical initiative - at least not according to american standards .
indeed , the best way to address the problem of the global financial crisis is to understand what el@@ lis@@ on , le@@ w@@ is , and other spon@@ sors of their bill propose to link back to a very american idea .
despite the set@@ backs that the us trade unions have been facing in recent years - in vienna , in the united kingdom , mic@@ hi@@ gan and in other countries across the country - americans have once said that they are ready to work .
it was a time when the european union was turning millions of americans into a mon@@ ster , when it was trying to build democracy , freedom of speech , freedom of the press and freedom of association .
as the united states re@@ acted after world war ii , the us encouraged japan to use the term &quot; japan &quot; to promote its own interests .
in full awareness of what the european union is about , workers and their unions are very much in the process of creating a new japan , and they are using a language that explicitly recognised that &apos; the rights of workers to union and common negotiation and action &apos; .
as the united states re@@ acted after world war ii , germany pus@@ hed general d@@ wi@@ ght david e@@ is@@ en@@ ho@@ wer and his staff to build a constitution that would allow the country to become a “ fas@@ c@@ ism ” ad@@ ol@@ f hit@@ ler ’ s .
in recognition of the fact that the workers are going to have to organise themselves and their voice in the new nation , i added that the german@@ s added a clause that explicitly states that they would not be allowed to do so .
agreements that are not in line with this right or that aim to prevent it are not acceptable .
as the former soviet union &apos;s first lady ele@@ an@@ or roo@@ se@@ vel@@ t presid@@ ed over the international human rights commission , the eu was not a party to the universal declaration of human rights , as it was signed by the united nations in 194@@ 8 .
since generations we have been accepting the basic pre@@ mise that working rights are human rights .
as this country was depri@@ ved of its own resources , it was not allowed to take part in the elections .
after this rights have been vio@@ lated in america , the us has actually been very wise to ask itself the american ideal once again , so that the working world is the right to decide on the rights of its people and to live in a free and open society .
as mr pa@@ st@@ or martin lu@@ ther king j@@ r. fifteen years ago said , &apos; we are not a man , we are a man , we are a man , we are a man , we are a man . &apos;
the history is a great success story .
now we all know that the working class movement has the strength of the nation , but rather the strength of the nation .
by using the increase in the standard of living of millions of people , work has , in a mir@@ ac@@ ulous way , created a market for industry and made the whole nation un@@ imag@@ in@@ able levels of production .
those who are not in favour of the work forget these simple tru@@ ths , but history preser@@ ves them .
the history remin@@ ds us , and we should remember that .
the formal recognition of the working rights as human rights - and the extension of the protection of civil rights as a defence against discrimination in the creation of employee representatives - has long been over@@ due .
ke@@ ith el@@ lic@@ on and john le@@ w@@ is re@@ new the ideal , which america has in the past made great and which promises to build democracy .
jud@@ ges stop at temporary inter@@ ference , that all de@@ ten@@ tions clin@@ ics in l@@ ou@@ i@@ si@@ ana are to close .
a us federal judge sto@@ pp@@ te on sunday morning , for the time being , the implementation of a law in lou@@ i@@ si@@ ana , which lawyers say that it is likely to be necessary to close all five abor@@ tion clin@@ ics in the state .
this measure , which was adopted by bo@@ b@@ by j@@ in@@ dal , govern@@ or of the l@@ ou@@ i@@ si@@ ana district , in june , was adopted and adopted on 1 september .
the decision of the judge to take a decision , however , means that doctors will remain legally abor@@ ted for the time being , while they have such a right .
&quot; the k@@ ill@@ ers can be compli@@ ant with the law while they are seeking the re@@ alization of this rights .
within a month , the commission will be conduc@@ ting a hearing to examine the case for the law to be more permanent .
ab@@ duc@@ tion sup@@ porters welcomed the initiative to give the recent decision in a number of jud@@ gments against similar measures and said that doctors were so concerned about time@@ -@@ consum@@ ing treatment .
&quot; the current decision means that the commission &apos;s women will be able to give their lives to a dis@@ proportion@@ ate law that has depri@@ ved them of their health and rights , &quot; n@@ ancy nor@@ th@@ up said , president and chairman of the centre for re@@ productive rights .
it was not immediately clear what the outcome would be .
lo@@ u si@@ ana is one of 11 states that have similar laws .
key words of the law in tex@@ as , which covers most of the government ’ s clinical tri@@ als to close are the “ un@@ safe ” state .
ab@@ duc@@ tion sup@@ porters and the american college of the arts are now in a position to take part in the “ american college of o@@ stre@@ tr@@ ici@@ ans and gy@@ nec@@ o@@ logi@@ sts ” , as well as the american medical association .
ab@@ duc@@ tion oppon@@ ents are against that , because the measures are designed to protect women &apos;s health , even though some are not aware of the impact of closing hospit@@ als .
only a doctor who has been in lou@@ i@@ si@@ ana to treat abor@@ tions can be given patient information .
if all other doctors are in the state forced to pay no compensation for abor@@ tion , then the latter would be forced to leave the country for fear of their safety , the group said .
in your argument , you are not in favour of the judgment , but of the state of lou@@ i@@ si@@ ana , who said that you do not have doctors to pun@@ ish for the conduct of abor@@ tions , whereas their applications for patients &apos; in@@ junction were pending .
delays in the diagno@@ sis and lack of information are a major problem for the european union .
the company has been operating in the field of the development of the internet for over 30 years .
for women in the rural areas of australia , there is a higher risk of losing to e@@ gg@@ s cancer .
forums are currently under construction and are being updated .
the research group , su@@ san jor@@ dan , from q@@ im@@ r ber@@ g@@ ho@@ fer medical research institute , said that the most important thing for those who work in rural and remote areas of the state is the mort@@ ality rate .
small study : new medic@@ inal products could help to reduce l@@ ung and e@@ gg@@ s cancer .
the formula for the study was to identify the causes of the disease and to identify the causes of it .
dr. jor@@ dan said that the project &apos;s age is at the heart of the diagno@@ sis , the type of e@@ gg@@ s cancer , of existing pre@@ dis@@ positions and of social and economic status .
for older versions of the software , the use of the latest technology is a very important issue .
for those who are in rural and remote areas , the situation is not as bad as it was in the united states during the study .
although the study is not investig@@ ated why outside the city living animals are treated with higher prob@@ ability of ov@@ aries , it is not clear that the disease is likely to be transmitted late .
&quot; this disease is most likely caused by gy@@ na@@ eco@@ log@@ ically un@@ co@@ log@@ ically , and these are mostly in larger cities .
despite the improvement in telecommunications , the number of people who are di@@ stan@@ cing is still very high , and the number of people who are not in the service of the doctors who have arrived has increased .
dr. jor@@ dan said that the world health organization ’ s study was a poor one , regardless of geographical status .
the information provided by rio t@@ into ride to con@@ qu@@ er can@@ cer is not published today in the medical journal .
in march 2013 , the el@@ ish@@ a ne@@ a@@ ve , a young mother of 33 years old , was told that she had a aggres@@ sive , aggres@@ sive form of o@@ vari@@ an cancer .
garden and garden areas are a source of regret for the dec@@ lining number of house@@ holds .
the decline , along with increased competition , will have a significant impact on the number of home@@ owners under 35 , which may lead to tens of thousands of p@@ ounds per year if today &apos;s young consumers are left to choose their own garden after a study by the h@@ ta .
the report states that the commission &apos;s ten@@ ants are expected to pay an average of 55 % of the amount that people with their own homes can spend on their own homes .
the rise in people who have been living in highly urban areas is a consequence of the fact that they are not allowed to live in gardens , the popular procedure of using as@@ ph@@ alt for parking purposes and the dec@@ lining garden size are other factors threat@@ ening the industry .
in the greater london area , where over a period of 6 years of age the share of home@@ owners of 6@@ 1 to 43 % has fallen , the cost of the least spending on garden products per household is reported .
the h@@ ta and the royal hor@@ tic@@ ul@@ tur@@ al society of the united kingdom point out that the housing sector is the property of the owner or the owner of the property , not the land .
gu@@ y bar@@ ter , chief executive officer of the group for the r@@ h@@ s said : &quot; contain@@ er-@@ gar@@ den@@ ers are a very important part of the industry , for example , because they are able to take their plants with them when they move . &quot;
the h@@ ta report identi@@ fies the period between 1997 and 2005 as the &apos; golden age &apos; .
he is predic@@ ting that the global economy will continue to improve this year , owing to better weather conditions .

the station provided its operation for around 40 minutes .
at the same time , around 3@@ 000 demonstr@@ ators tried to return to prime minister na@@ wa@@ z sh@@ ari@@ f &apos;s residence .

the army of the country is ur@@ ging the government to find a political solution to the conflict , &apos; without time and without violence &apos; .
after a session in the headquarters of the company on sunday evening , the board of directors informed : &quot; the army remains in control of its role , the security of the state &quot; .
the military has a role to play in pakistan and has already played a more frequent role in the conflict .
the op@@ posi@@ tional state is be@@ having like a “ political party ” , im@@ ran kh@@ an , in which he was elected in may last year .
the pro@@ tests were most popular at the weekend , after k@@ h@@ an and q@@ ad@@ ri had their sup@@ porters forced to withdraw from the sh@@ aria ’ s residence .
the first three people were killed .
turkey is ordered to pay us diplom@@ at for es@@ pi@@ on@@ age .
the turkish parliament has been calling on the service provider to provide assistance to the country ’ s most senior us diplom@@ ats on american and british es@@ pi@@ on@@ age in turkey .
vice-president of the commission . - mr b@@ ü@@ l@@ ent said that the business secretary of the us emb@@ ass@@ y and turkish officials discussed the report on monday .
the german magazine &quot; the spi@@ e@@ gel &quot; and the online magazine the inter@@ cep@@ t reported that the german government &apos;s data provided by the former us analy@@ sts of the national security agency , ed@@ ward snow@@ den , show that turkey is a major activity .
after the turkish government says that the turkish government played a key role in the country ’ s development , according to the turkish news agency .
a former us secretary of state , mr president , said that the most important secret service in germany was also in touch with an@@ kar@@ a , created a much more an@@ gr@@ y response from the turkish government .
warning : the european union is not threat@@ ening to take action with regard to the p@@ end@@ ler .
the federal wide warning system for the use of the train drivers at the monday evening could also reduce passenger traffic in n@@ r@@ w .
the commissioner responsible for 18 to 21 o &apos;@@ clock is in charge of the entire transport companies across the country , including the long-@@ distance , regional and s-@@ bahn transport .

the german railway in n@@ r@@ w announced the launch of the new version of the n@@ r@@ w to minim@@ ize the impact .
the g@@ d@@ l has , however , not said where they are going to strike , so it is difficult to get the consequences into the concrete perspective .
poli@@ ze@@ ic@@ hn@@ if von mag@@ alu@@ f the corruption charges
the an@@ k@@ les of the trial showed the office of the prosecu@@ tor of mall@@ orca on friday to prove that they had been black@@ ma@@ iled by police officers and staff of the city of cal@@ vi@@ à .
the bo@@ ss of the police of cal@@ vi@@ à on the holiday island of mall@@ orca was arrested for corruption charges .
the main commissioner , jo@@ s@@ é ant@@ oni@@ o na@@ var@@ ro , was appointed after corruption charges against him by several business@@ men from pun@@ ta bal@@ ena , who was on the street in which most bars and night@@ clubs were open .
after the commission &apos;s online daily mall@@ orca dic@@ tionary , we have seen that the prosecu@@ tors have given the office of the public prosecu@@ tor a mandate to combat corruption in mall@@ orca on friday to make black@@ mail by police and officials of the city of cal@@ vi@@ va .
two other villages are located in the north of the island , and are known for their beautiful beaches .
the national spanish daily , ab@@ c , reported that the us had a growing sense of an@@ gr@@ y night clubs .
&quot; it is not just about money ear@@ ning , it is about survival , &quot; said one of the business@@ men to the court .

the island authorities have since made an attempt to improve the illegal behaviour of alcohol and tobacco producers .
the playa house club , located in the ro@@ cky beach of the playa de pal@@ ma , was designed for one year to close , while play@@ house and the k@@ nei@@ p@@ ent@@ our@@ age club were forced to close for one year .

the first spring day of the na@@ ked and cr@@ ash@@ ing weather .
the spring of the year has been a great winter experience for the whole family , with a lot of shows and a lot of fun .
on the evening until 9 p.m. , further 5@@ mm of rain fell on the city , after 6.@@ 6.@@ 6@@ mm , which was already in the night of sunday .
the last decline in the last decade was the result of a series of short stor@@ my sho@@ wers , including a cast that was just before 20 o &apos;@@ clock and was found for almost 4@@ mm ra@@ inf@@ all in about 10 minutes .
after the winter was over for a fru@@ it@@ ful do@@ se of spring last week , the first two months of the year were already over .
the evil de@@ mi@@ go@@ ds have probably caused the dev@@ a@@ station of the lan@@ ding of a vir@@ gin air@@ lin@@ er from mel@@ bour@@ ne to ade@@ la@@ ide .
the aircraft would have been scheduled to be in service shortly after 19@@ .@@ 30 , but was cancelled by a wh@@ ir@@ l@@ wind - a su@@ dden change in wind speed or direction over a short distance - and had to be taken .
wind@@ st@@ ö@@ ge reached a point at this time about 50 km / h on the ground at ade@@ la@@ ide airport .
the airlines &apos; data showed that the aircraft was also very successful in a second lan@@ ding .
the airlines &apos; flight delay caused a serious problem in the after@@ mat@@ h of some other flights , including an em@@ i@@ rates flight from du@@ ba@@ i and a qu@@ an@@ tu@@ m flight from sy@@ d@@ ney .
for ad@@ es@@ so , it is the first time that a maximum temperature of 16 ° c is predic@@ ted on tuesday , with possible sho@@ wers .
do you want to know more about the new version of the game ?
given the g@@ alo@@ pp@@ i@@ ent technical progress of which the european parliament has been a very pleasant home in high-@@ tech areas , i would like to say that we are not alone in having a good deal of money .
during my time here , i am remin@@ ded of the problem of the spir@@ al cable that has been used to connect the list@@ en@@ er to the phone , and i think that bo@@ ah , like re@@ tr@@ o , is that ?
but da@@ w@@ ning behind it is a thought : if the cable is not , the very short time it will be all the list@@ en@@ ers will be flying around the house , and that would be even more important re@@ tr@@ o .
in any case , the principle of subsidiarity applies at the ec@@ kel@@ tr@@ onic ( ec@@ kel@@ tr@@ onic ?
no , ti@@ pp@@ f@@ än@@ ger : electronic sector the rule that the world &apos;s nov@@ el@@ ty of today is the electric sc@@ ra@@ p of tomorrow , bought - out@@ dated .
and who , for example , is still a pi@@ pe television in the living room , says that the only thing he can do is to reject television .
why this consideration ?
because we are an@@ x@@ ious to push i@@ fa to the radio tower in the week , we are once again being completely in@@ competent in matters of electronics .
the laser is a very important part of the sound , which was once a washing machine and c@@ d-@@ player blind , today , not even the purpose of the devices that were equipped with an un@@ fa@@ i@@ th@@ ful expert spre@@ e in front of him : &quot; connect &quot; .
yes , is it possible to do it ?
what we are talking about with people who are apparently free to do so ?
in fact , it is a question of the european union &apos;s ability to act like a member of the european parliament for some 20 years .
this is why the yo@@ gh@@ ur@@ t itself is suitable for the purpose of making the fire alarm on your holiday in the mal@@ di@@ ves .
and would it not be wonderful if the european parliament &apos;s office could be able to count on our early arrival ... ?
yes , the pre@@ requisite for this is air conditioning .
but a dream will be certainly not come true soon : we will lift our arms and arm@@ our , say you l@@ oud &quot; s@@ our ! &quot; - and at home the d@@ ust collec@@ tor drives the lot .
ir@@ re .
all is on the contrary , and nothing less than a revolution : &apos; the borders between white and brown are not clear &apos; .
for the daily practice we know that the use of a new and modern device is necessary , and that it is guaranteed that the battery will be empty .
what a further reason for this is that the spi@@ ri@@ ted cable is on the phone also the next radio exhibitions will survive .
israeli leaders ’ children are returning home after the gaza war .
thousands of israel@@ is ’ children from the areas in the vicinity of gaza have been killed and in@@ ju@@ red in the schools on monday , after they had been killed in air space for the summer , while missi@@ le and missi@@ le attacks were being fi@@ red .
the school start brought the new school system , which was designed by ro@@ cket in@@ fil@@ tr@@ ation ho@@ les , to the south of israel , a sense of joy and expec@@ tation , but the signs of fighting are still fresh .
in the southern city of ash@@ do@@ d , the staff of the &quot; pas@@ ho@@ sh &quot; children &apos;s garden , who was accompanied by a ro@@ cket , were especially aware of the presence of the students gran@@ at@@ split from the walls .
&quot; we have a little bit of fear , but are ex@@ ci@@ ted to &quot; said ron@@ it b@@ art , an@@ in@@ hab@@ ited in the kit@@ bu@@ tte sa@@ ad and there are english teacher .

president re@@ u@@ ven ri@@ v@@ lin visited the country &apos;s ki@@ b@@ but@@ z near the border with gaza , to express his support .
until a ce@@ as@@ e@@ fire ends last week ’ s war , the thousands of armed re@@ be@@ ls and the entire population of the border communities , such as sa@@ ad , left their homes to live in sa@@ fer areas further away from gaza and to the missi@@ le .
many people in na@@ ha@@ l o@@ z , one of the municip@@ alities near the border to gaza , in the area where a 4-@@ year-@@ old boy was killed by a palestinian ass@@ ass@@ ination attempt , are hesit@@ ant to go to gaza .

israel and hamas are agreed that the palestinian authority should be allowed to withdraw from the gaza strip on tuesday .
the weapons are not only a problem for the palestinians , but also for the palestinians , important problems remain un@@ resolved , such as the hamas request for the lif@@ ting of the isra@@ eli@@ -@@ egyp@@ tian bloc@@ k@@ ade and the re@@ opening of air and sea operations .
israel is calling for dis@@ arm@@ ament by hamas and for the transfer of the cor@@ p@@ ses of two in the fighting .
a new round of indirect taxation talks will probably be needed in the coming months in egypt .
in the war , more than 2,@@ 100 palestinians were killed , and the three quarters of them civili@@ ans , and at least 4@@ 94 children , according to palestinians and the un estimates .
israel is den@@ ying this information and is es@@ tim@@ ating that it is at least half of the killed .
on the israeli side , 6@@ 6 soldiers and six civilian civili@@ ans , including a th@@ ai soldi@@ er , were killed .
ha@@ mas and other strugg@@ les in gaza have been fi@@ red at 4.@@ 5@@ 91 ro@@ c@@ kets and mur@@ der@@ ous bom@@ bs during the fighting on israeli territory .

during ten thousand years of persecu@@ tion , tens of thousands of people continue to live in the shel@@ ters and fighting , the education authorities have postpon@@ ed the start of the school year last week .
&quot; i hope that the school is soon back open , so that we can continue learning so as to make the children of the world and the jewish children , &quot; said mo@@ ham@@ ma@@ d am@@ ara , a 13@@ -@@ year-@@ old boy , who is currently in school .

96 refugees can be re@@ patri@@ ated in the three t@@ ents .
the reasons for the over@@ crow@@ ding in the first picture are the cr@@ ash of relief teams and the lack of support for the second .
many refugees remain in the european union for longer than the regular three months .
the skin care products have the strong@@ est winter growth in seven years , but they show a widely observed growth rate of more than 50 % .

the council , which is responsible for the access to the roads , must also be able to develop the narrow road up to the castle less dram@@ atically than the med@@ als fe@@ ared .
from a nine meter wide road , the road was not , and is not , talk .
it is still not a question of eur 5.@@ 50 meters , that is a metr@@ e wide than before , &quot; explains p@@ ö@@ tz@@ l .
the argument of med@@ usa is that the member states are free and competitive in their parking spaces .
ad@@ mit@@ tedly , there is no mention of it because it is the same as in other public parking areas .
the commission must be aware of the people living in the vicinity , and of the people living in the vicinity .
the children ’ s cri@@ b ber@@ g@@ w@@ ich@@ tel , which is located on the grounds and is situated on the front door of the park dec@@ k , was to be built according to the university president .
rather , it gives consideration to &apos; that there is no just a question of cri@@ me@@ a , but also of the an@@ ce@@ st@@ ors living in the vicinity of the entrance to the fried@@ rich@@ -@@ stri@@ b-@@ stra@@ ß@@ e and the 800 school students at the neighbouring real@@ sch@@ u@@ le .
it is not just a question of the parties involved , but of the interests of mr med@@ a@@ u , &quot; he says .
whether the criticism of the paren@@ tal leave is justified is not clear .
in early october , p@@ ö@@ tz@@ l , together with the state building office in b@@ am@@ berg , plans to inform the city authorities about the construction development of the university by 2020 &quot; and in this context to stress the importance of new development &quot; .
pe@@ er med is a game that has been played by the famous &apos; &apos; k@@ id &apos; &apos; , a game that has been played by the &apos; &apos; &apos; star trek &apos; &apos; &apos; &apos; star trek &apos; &apos; &apos; &apos; .
consequently , the commission &apos;s access to the new parking dec@@ k is not to be restricted to the camp@@ us and the fried@@ rich@@ -@@ stri@@ b-@@ stra@@ ß@@ e , but to the me@@ d@@ au@@ -@@ berg as it has been .
this would have to be the narrow road to be about one kil@@ ome@@ tre long .
according to the united states &apos; high-@@ b@@ ills , the traffic in the park of ho@@ hen@@ f@@ els castle would thus increase ten@@ fold .
from about 2000 vehicles daily , the issue is .
from the commission &apos;s side , it was not intended to be a statement on the project .
g@@ lan@@ or@@ f is from hand@@ ball leg@@ s , and is the only one who has ever been to the team of the hand@@ ball team .
hol@@ ger g@@ lan@@ tor@@ f will not be responsible for the dh@@ b team any@@ more .
the 3@@ 1-@@ year-@@ old from the bun@@ des@@ lig@@ a s@@ g fl@@ ens@@ bur@@ g-@@ han@@ de@@ wit@@ t introduced a new version of the first two new models , the &quot; k@@ ul@@ tur@@ plan@@ ner &quot; .
the decision is very difficult for me , but it is a matter of months .
it is important for me to refer to the signals from my body .
he goes on to work with a balance sheet of 16@@ 7 country games and 5@@ 76 goals for germany in the international reti@@ rement .
because the wor@@ m &apos;s ro@@ ot@@ -@@ and-@@ branch re@@ ar player is responsible for the champi@@ on league winner from fl@@ ens@@ burg .
with the is@@ land@@ ers , who were to be able to leave their own cat on tuesday for the country games against switzerland , g@@ land@@ or@@ f introduced a &quot; long and good con@@ vers@@ ation .
his ideas and approaches are of great interest to me as much as they are my many years of fellow players and my success@@ ors .
but for my club i would also like to be able to live in a healthy way over the next few years , for longer periods of recovery are necessary , which will reduce the current duplic@@ ation .
the lin@@ k@@ s@@ han@@ der had a total of 2@@ 40 seats in the european parliament after a distance inf@@ ection in 2012 .
because of ach@@ il@@ le@@ ess@@ he@@ he problems , he had been di@@ str@@ acted by team doctors from the german hand@@ ball association ( dh@@ b ) with a cor@@ tis@@ one injec@@ tion , which later became a strong infl@@ am@@ mation .
a no@@ tary operation and two other interven@@ tions followed .
then i was able to get a k@@ ill@@ er against the team doctor .
twelve years of professional and el@@ f years of national team career .
i have some health concerns about the building sites i do not ignore .
after the three informal tri@@ als of inf@@ ec@@ tious foot@@ prin@@ ts that took place in 2012 , the number of people affected by the disease has never been properly under control .
this is due to the fact that some other complaints relating to wear are not covered .
the first step of the year i noticed that the commission was not in favour of raising my head , but that it was not possible to dec@@ ei@@ ve my body , &quot; explained g@@ land@@ or@@ f in the interview to the magazine &quot; hand@@ ball time &quot; .
for a co@@ me@@ back , he would only be in absolute need .
&quot; if all stri@@ pes are ri@@ pped , i am always talking . &quot;
however , i cannot understand the years in which i still have to play hand@@ ball at one hand .
i must also say that i am still convinced , after my long stay in hospital in 2012 , that i have become quite hum@@ ili@@ ating as far as my health is concerned .
after my career as a journ@@ alist , i would like to go straight to the point .
in addition to the world cup title 2007 and the win of the champi@@ ons league 20@@ 14 , he won the 2008 h@@ s@@ g n@@ ord@@ hor@@ n and 2010 ( t@@ b@@ v le@@ m@@ go ) the e@@ h@@ f cup .

german economy in the spring at 0.@@ 2 % weak@@ ened , and the us economy dec@@ lined by 0.@@ 2 % .
the crises surrounding the euro are a cause for concern for the german economy in the second quarter .
the gross domestic product of the european union fell from april to the end of june 20@@ 14 , compared to the previous quarter by 0.@@ 2 % .
the partial result was that the federal statistical office did not publish the results of the survey .
in the past , consumption alone had a stag@@ ger@@ ing impact on the economy , while investment dec@@ lined .
the council of ministers has also been bra@@ king the economy .
thanks to the strong rise in the year , the company has a strong overall growth of 2.@@ 7 % for the first six months compared to the second half of 2013 .
hor@@ st@@ mar was the starting point and the goal of the &quot; m@@ ün@@ ster@@ land mo@@ o@@ i@@ ste &quot; , which was first mentioned by the bur@@ g@@ man@@ n@@ s@@ stadt on sunday .
the bur@@ gun@@ dian city of hor@@ st@@ mar experienced a great deal of inv@@ asion on sunday .
the biggest cycle sport association in the netherlands , n@@ t@@ f@@ u , organised the so-called &quot; munich bike week &quot; .
the company has a strong reputation for its excellent service and its excellent service .
the first edition of the international conference on the subject of the protection of the environment and the protection of the environment was held in munich .
the competition is being held in the german federal state of bad@@ en-@@ w@@ ür@@ t@@ tem@@ berg .
we shall come from the her@@ oes and we shall be at night to take part in this tour .
we would like to present the m@@ ün@@ ster@@ land to you as well &quot; , fre@@ u@@ d &apos;s cy@@ cli@@ sts were pleased with the route through the ste@@ in@@ furt , bor@@ ken and co@@ es@@ fel@@ d .
after the registration in the club home of the sch@@ ü@@ tz@@ en@@ bro@@ ther@@ schaft sta .
kat@@ har@@ ina went to the school of a small &quot; peace &quot; through the city over the wall , where the start was also made .
further , the ro@@ te , the most important for three different categories , led to the her@@ ren@@ hol@@ z via the sch@@ ö@@ pp@@ inger mountain towards co@@ es@@ fel@@ d and across ha@@ vi@@ x@@ bec@@ k and b@@ ill@@ er@@ bec@@ k .
on routes of 95 kilometres , with 1@@ 17@@ 5 elev@@ ation metres , 120 kilometres of 14@@ 75 metres of al@@ titude and 14@@ 5 kilometres of 17@@ 75 metres of al@@ titude , the cy@@ cli@@ sts have demonstrated their good condition .

the main organiz@@ er jo@@ s ter hu@@ er@@ ne and may@@ or of the town of he@@ in@@ z l@@ ö@@ l@@ fing@@ en showed themselves to be able to succeed in this cycling event .
we are satisfied and it was a nice experience for all concerned .
the organisation is based in the city of hamburg , germany , and there were no negative inci@@ dents &quot; , he dra@@ ws up a positive conclusion .
unfortunately , not so many participants came to the event as the organiz@@ er hoped .
&quot; we see ourselves in the year 20@@ 15 with hopefully beautiful weather on 30 august or during a different weekend . &quot; he promised to do a lot of work , but he promised to return to m@@ ün@@ ster@@ land and plan a new edition .
con@@ stan@@ t@@ ine w@@ ec@@ kers ’ gent@@ le , honest mem@@ o@@ irs are not the only ones to be seen .
it is actually more philosoph@@ ical than a the@@ ological testi@@ mony .
not chi , but the same , is the thought of the people who are thinking about the world .
and he is about to be careful .
the fact that the commission is not a party to the convention is also a sign of its own tolerance of its fellow human beings .
wide range of services are also available , but the more important is the fact that love , soul , ec@@ o , the word being in the now , spirit@@ u@@ ality - all of this he tries to go on the basis of very philosoph@@ ical , but also very philosoph@@ ical , but .
and he explained the reasons for his pacific spirit , his social identity critique , his political commitment - and also , as he did not only listen to music ( the opera ) .
the latter is not in the hab@@ it of con@@ stan@@ t@@ ine w@@ ec@@ ker , but of the as@@ c@@ es@@ tic mon@@ k who &quot; through sub@@ tr@@ action &quot; ar@@ ises , as he says , &quot; by doing everything unnecessary away &quot; .
between all the high-@@ min@@ ded views , there is also short approaches to the question of the “ earth ” : about the sle@@ eping of a man in a g@@ is frequ@@ ented loc@@ ally or a cra@@ zy world .
the commission is also quite careful about this .
len@@ ny hen@@ ry : my father has asked me never to enter the arm .
has never said &apos; i love you &apos; .
hen@@ ry was one of seven children of a family jam@@ a@@ ic@@ an immigrants in du@@ d@@ ley in the mid@@ lands .
his father , who died in the year hen@@ ry 19 , was working in a factory in which her relationship was limited .
hen@@ ry pro@@ b@@ bi@@ ed for a com@@ edy , ru@@ dy &apos;s r@@ are re@@ cor@@ d &apos;s , which was partly based on an imag@@ inary con@@ vers@@ ation with his father and was released on radio 4 .
the sound@@ track is a very mix@@ ture of reg@@ ga@@ e and ra@@ p , with lively me@@ lo@@ dies and a mix of rhy@@ th@@ ms .
but hen@@ ry had to be replaced by some difficult child@@ hood moments .
he attended the &quot; many &quot; therapy courses in the after@@ mat@@ h of the death of his mother , and hen@@ ry is con@@ tem@@ pl@@ ating his relationship with his father .
it was hard to get him to know .
it was never seen his face , he heard only his voice : &quot; hel@@ l with the cr@@ ack .
let us make your si@@ ster in peace .
be@@ we@@ gun@@ gen sie !
i do not want to see cr@@ ick@@ et .
my older bro@@ thers se@@ y@@ m@@ our and hil@@ ton - the old ones - have been living in the city since i was a child - went to the pu@@ b and spoke about things like the form of the beer glass .
i had never had such a con@@ vers@@ ation with him .
a large part of my life was dedicated to this serious type in the corner that the newspaper read .
recently opened the hen@@ ry a foun@@ dry , in dublin , where he has been working on better conditions than at the time of his father , has gained a reputation for his work .
it is now a little bri@@ ghter , but you are dark , dar@@ ker and more deep sty@@ lis@@ tic lab@@ y@@ r@@ in@@ ths with fl@@ ame re@@ tar@@ d@@ ants and smo@@ ke and much rus@@ h .
my father put his name down in the wall earlier and then i could not see him again , as he was sing@@ ing .
as i was there , i was very surprised that the commission was not able to do this for years , and that it was not possible to eat it .
nevertheless , the number of hen@@ ry &apos;s children grew without a lo@@ ving testi@@ mony of his parents .
my father moved to the new town , where he was never &quot; i love you &quot; .
only when the european parliament was able to vote against my mother &apos;s death did i start to say &quot; i love you , i love you , i love you &quot; .
by its own subsidiary , the company has been awarded da@@ wn fr@@ n@@ ch , and has been able to share the love that he had missing as a child .
could you please tell me what you think about the &quot; i love you &quot; ?
the room was very small and the bathroom was very small .
pa@@ pa , i am 22 !
with da@@ wn fr@@ rent , the new version of the game is available for download .
why should we not be friends ?
you are a great person , but you are not a mother .
it is always a problem with french .
d@@ wn is a good man .
why should we not be friends ?
you are a great person , but you are not a mother .
hen@@ ry &apos;s own mother was di@@ abe@@ tic and was a di@@ abe@@ tic .
the tr@@ um@@ pet of her death .
as i was very , very ex@@ ag@@ ger@@ ated and sympa@@ thetic to symp@@ t@@ oms of di@@ abe@@ tes , my doctor said , &quot; you must be radical .
so i pul@@ led this fitness through and had to take a dr@@ astic di@@ et , to get the symp@@ t@@ oms .
it is very difficult .
and it is ex@@ hau@@ sting .
no one eat a car@@ ot@@ ten .
hen@@ ry &apos;s career began in 197@@ 0 when he was a member of the group of the european people &apos;s party ( christian democrats ) and european democrats .
since he was elected by cri@@ tics of his ot@@ tom@@ an victory , he has been a great advoc@@ ate of theatre .
it followed a series of com@@ edy by the er@@ up@@ tions , and then f@@ ences from august wil@@ son .
the first is the fact that the si@@ t@@ com software is a very different experience from the sit@@ com@@ s and com@@ edy that has filled his working life .
he began with only 16 years , when he was in a factory , and was a member of the staff of the company .
a d@@ j discovered a buff@@ er over@@ flow on stage when he was im@@ it@@ ating and writing to new fas@@ es about him .
his television career began in the mid-@@ 197@@ 0s with the first television series , &quot; i was for a quite long time the only black im@@ it@@ ator / com@@ edi@@ an on television . &quot;
he lear@@ nt in his profes@@ sion .
i had to work not only in the eyes of the public , but also from 197@@ 5 to 198@@ 5 , to learn how to develop an efficient wit@@ z story machine .
len@@ ny 197@@ 5 at new fashion , new fashion , new york : the art of the year .
as his manager has the stage installation right to the bl@@ ack and white lounge , he is not only a member of the group but also a member of the group .
i have always been a very un@@ pleasant family .
i wish that some kind of thing would never happen .
it was a special event , un@@ pleasant , for me to be able to work on giant mountains .
but this &quot; millennium &quot; is not a good idea , because it is a very good one .
by using the new fi@@ gur@@ ines , which are the british black culture both ver@@ mo@@ lated and co@@ war@@ dly , hen@@ ry worked in the 198@@ 0s on a alternative com@@ edy film circle .
the first series of ste@@ ering wheel len@@ ny hen@@ ry show was broad@@ cast in 198@@ 4 and in the 199@@ 0s he was one of the most successful ch@@ efs of the group , gar@@ th black@@ lock .
advertising , docum@@ entary films , tv shows , and other films are the main characteristics of his next decade , but after his br@@ on@@ ze series len@@ ny@@ hen@@ ry@@ .@@ tv 2008 , he thought he was : &quot; what do you do next ?
after that , a docum@@ entary series for radio 4 came with the title : what &apos;s so great about ... ?
the first consequence was that the first part was about sha@@ kes@@ pe@@ are .
on sha@@ kes@@ pe@@ are , the first time i was aller@@ gic to sha@@ kes@@ pe@@ are was in the first place .
i had the opportunity to attend school , but i was not able to keep it up to date .
so i had great fear of it .
all who have been in favour of the show are invited to take part in the show , peter hall , tre@@ v@@ or n@@ un@@ n , adri@@ an lec@@ ter , ju@@ di den@@ ch said &quot; you should try it .
do not worry , we will be able to make a good deal of money .
ni@@ mm a few of the words in the mouth , and then you will be able to understand why we all have sha@@ kes@@ pe@@ are so lo@@ ving .
hen@@ ry led 20 lines of the ot@@ to lo@@ to last speech for the docum@@ entary on and he was enthusi@@ astic .
i had the feeling that the commission was able to do this .
it was almost as if the council had given me the head up properly .
&quot; that is what it is all about , it is a serious matter , take it seriously , learn your text , research , and make a little more sear@@ ch@@ able .
the pro@@ be was brut@@ al , and i read this piece monthly .
and it was a success .
you seemed to have a car accident , but you were not .
and soon he joined the band .
suddenly , the first time i was in the national theatre , i could hardly believe it .
as a result , there was a moment when i thought that &apos; o@@ h , you have changed you &apos; .
it was a technical error and hen@@ ry felt that the game was not working properly .
&quot; a small voice said to me &quot; you must now be 10 minutes brid@@ ging , while you are on the computer repair &quot; .
instead , the bush administration ’ s stage leader , mr president , announced that it would continue to do so as soon as the problem was resolved .
i went from the stage and ir@@ on@@ ically from the stage .
i am not in favour of this .
i can only say that to someone else .
&quot; you play in a theatre style , you play in a theatre , so stay in your role . &quot;
hen@@ ry in f@@ ences on du@@ ch@@ ess the@@ at@@ re , the first of the two , was a great writer and a great writer .
the text for windows is not a simple text .
p@@ ani@@ k is very good , the commission is very keen to do so .
the european parliament also came up well , so it is like a big shi@@ eld of the go@@ ds who tell me &apos; that is your determination &apos; .
he says so , of course , with a don@@ n@@ n@@ ous voice .
so i remain convinced that this is the case .
i love the really .
i love to be in a pro@@ be room , but i don &apos;t know what to do .
hen@@ ry has also always said that he is not a com@@ edi@@ an - our con@@ vers@@ ation is of hum@@ or@@ ous er@@ up@@ tions , while he keeps on im@@ it@@ ating people .
i have decided to not take stand ups , but i am sure that the commission will be able to do this type of immediate satisfaction .
if you want to do this fore@@ ver , you go on to a wall .
i am in favour of the use of the internet as a means of communication , but i am not in favour of it as much as i have done in the past .
i wonder whether he would agree with me if he ever had a stand@@ -@@ up com@@ edy tour .
the fun , the fun i have in a room with a director , is the same as the fun i have in the middle , the end of a journey .
is this a good thing , then , about the new inc@@ ar@@ nation ?
i think that is the case .
i am happy to be an actor .
it makes fun .
it is said that the history of the country is great .
i love stories , but i don &apos;t know what i am talking about .
the people love stories and stories .

after the commission &apos;s online edition of the y@@ em@@ en post , the dutch newspaper hu@@ tu had a very good chance to get a good deal of money on sunday evening .
hu@@ th@@ i dro@@ h@@ te was , according to the bu@@ ll , threatened to es@@ cal@@ ate the conflict , if his demands were not met .
the rail system in the shi@@ a hu@@ tus is fighting for more independence from the sun@@ ni rul@@ ed y@@ em@@ en and demanding the re@@ sign@@ ation of the government .

around 30@@ ,000 re@@ be@@ ls have pro@@ tested , and they have been killed by pro@@ tests on the major roads of san@@ a@@ a .
in the surrounding area , there are always bloo@@ dy batt@@ les with the y@@ em@@ en@@ i army .
ken@@ ya registered its civil serv@@ ants to &quot; viol@@ ate the g@@ host workers &quot; .
ken@@ ya has thus begun to use all government officials bi@@ ome@@ tric to register , and it is now time to register g@@ host workers from the country &apos;s pay lists .
employees who are committed to the development of the company in the next two weeks would no longer be paid , but a government communication was available .
the government is susp@@ ecting that thousands of people are still being held in prison after their departure .
president us@@ h@@ chen@@ ko knows that he is not going to be a man of the past when he takes office in 2013 .
in the event of an examination at the beginning of this year , it was found that at least 1 million $ ( 7@@ 00@@ ,000 £ ) per month in payments for g@@ host employees and other ab@@ u@@ sive financial practices were lost .
the government is susp@@ ecting that sal@@ aries are still paid on accounts that are not available .
all officials must now be able to work in the next two weeks at identification centres to ensure that they are able to keep their data on the bi@@ ome@@ tric regi@@ stra@@ tions , have been informed in a government message .
all who have done this without a credible and credible exc@@ use would be taken by the sal@@ ary list .
&quot; by this approach , much to ra@@ tion@@ alize public service , which is the real and the most effective number of officials , and also to reduce the pay list on both levels of government .

for this time , man@@ f@@ red rich@@ ter knows many re@@ vered pe@@ ter@@ sha@@ us@@ ers and collabor@@ ators from their time as students .
his methods were sometimes un@@ conventional , but he was always wor@@ n by his quest to be the pu@@ p@@ il of man .

jud@@ ges were born in 19@@ 30 in tr@@ au@@ ten@@ au / north bo@@ hem@@ ia , today tr@@ ut@@ no@@ v .
the first time he was interested in the subject of the study of the art of the arts , he was 14 .
a year later , the su@@ de@@ ten german@@ s were dis@@ missed .

after a few months in a camp , the war went to bav@@ aria in 194@@ 6 - the freight wag@@ on .
for example , the world &apos;s jud@@ ges hi@@ red the senior army &apos;s sen@@ k@@ endor@@ f .
the teachers &apos; training took place in b@@ am@@ berg .
this was due to the fact that man@@ f@@ red rich@@ ter had to return to the ne@@ arest station six times a week , to the next train station , three kilometres across the city , to school and in the evening back .
after two months of receiving man@@ f@@ red rich@@ ter in a red cross case , in bag@@ h@@ dad , he got a sle@@ eping opportunity : together with up to 15 students in a sle@@ eping room .
in 195@@ 1 he made his first and 195@@ 4 after three years of le@@ h@@ ram@@ t@@ san@@ w@@ ä@@ r@@ ter the second state exam@@ en .
as the first time in his life he had to work in the school , he was forced to leave for upper bav@@ aria and came to germany on november 1 , 195@@ 4 .
the &quot; f@@ ä@@ ul@@ in@@ en-@@ zim@@ mer &quot; was his first &quot; service flat &quot; in the school house .
in 195@@ 8 , he referred to the construction of a new teacher &apos;s house next to the school as a three-@@ room service flat .
this house bought the man@@ f@@ red rich@@ ter 1980 , after the school in k@@ ol@@ l@@ bach started dis@@ ban@@ ding in 196@@ 8 .
until then , there were no problems in the school association pe@@ ter@@ sburg , which had been in operation for three classes in pe@@ ter@@ sha@@ us@@ en .
from the school year 196@@ 8 / 68 , the children were born in pe@@ ter@@ sha@@ us@@ en in the present town hall .
as the school association in@@ der@@ s@@ dorf was founded , the school was only the foundation school in the village .
to join the back@@ gr@@ oun@@ ding in the now smaller school , the commission changed its name to the former rec@@ tor geor@@ g si@@ gl after kar@@ ls@@ fel@@ d - and man@@ f@@ red rich@@ ter was his success@@ or .
but pe@@ ter@@ s@@ haus@@ en grew up , and so we could not afford to pay off their teachers in september 198@@ 2 .

&quot; civil master g@@ ö@@ tz was very scho@@ ol@@ -@@ friendly &quot; , re@@ mem@@ bered jud@@ ges grateful .
in his entire career , he has worked with judge ben@@ jam@@ in si@@ sk@@ o to make the speech of a government representative who was on a school council meeting on justice and law .
&quot; you have to tell the children two things : roots and the w@@ ings &quot; , says the current 8@@ 4-@@ year-@@ old .
and he had to learn : &quot; this is not always possible &quot; , and whether he only has his students or his own six children , he is not quite clear .
in any case , richard ni@@ x@@ on &apos;s actions were sometimes un@@ conventional .
if students are looking for a job , they were given not a job , but a job .
on the cost of the municip@@ ality , jud@@ ges had two pa@@ irs of boo@@ ts and let the two con@@ tra@@ sting men face each other , even if they were a v@@ ile her@@ o .
for the sake of the school , jud@@ ges had been a good relationship with the then may@@ or lu@@ d@@ wi@@ g g@@ ö@@ tz ( c@@ su ) .
this moving and in@@ tu@@ i@@ tive judge after his reti@@ rement led to the idea of a european arrest warrant , at least as the last one on the c@@ su list in 1996 .

if cycling is to be a great experience on your tour in bad salzburg or scotland , you can also take a ride on the bike .
on friday , however , the number of r@@ as@@ te@@ ering impres@@ sions alone made the 700 participants of the hr@@ 4 cycle tour and accompan@@ ying tro@@ ss enjoy a break in the lower spa park of bad salzburg .
under the mo@@ tto &quot; ra@@ fting and celebr@@ ating on newly discovered paths between nic@@ o@@ sia and kin@@ zi@@ g &quot; , the participants had the chance to meet in bad vill@@ bel on thursday and to perform a concert of van ba@@ ker &amp; band .
on friday , it was taken seriously : the cy@@ cli@@ sts took the first stage , the 60 km over fl@@ or@@ stadt to bad salzburg and further to scotland in the process .
in bad salzburg you can find the sports enthusi@@ asts of the town of bad sal@@ haus@@ en , who was born in bad vil@@ bel with the bike .
a number of restaurants and bars are available for refres@@ h@@ ment .
&quot; such clu@@ m@@ ps can only be ba@@ ked agricultural women &quot; , p@@ raised a particip@@ ant from aus@@ en@@ di@@ e@@ bach , while he was a little more or@@ der@@ te .
on the drinks stand of the tur@@ n@@ club ge@@ i@@ ß@@ -@@ ni@@ d@@ da , cold sal@@ ads could be refres@@ hed .
the &quot; du@@ o br@@ av@@ o &quot; had the visitors with well-known mel@@ o@@ di@@ ans from opera , and music and the &quot; du@@ o br@@ av@@ o &quot; was a real treat .
the beautiful ambi@@ ence of the park has been relaxed .
a mr geno@@ ss over@@ came a head@@ -@@ massage from his partner : &quot; the woman he deserves , finally he has a great deal of jum@@ ps today .
der@@ we@@ il had to be the may@@ or and the executive director : they were arrested at the foun@@ tain in front of the drinking spa house of re@@ porter ra@@ iner jan@@ ke .
the hotel is also a perfect place for promo@@ tional ch@@ ef to@@ bi@@ as h@@ agen , who has been working as a tour manager since the first hr@@ 4 tour 2004 , to be brief , after all he had plenty of experience with the technology on site .
his pilot was a pilot of the &quot; k@@ ling@@ on defense &quot; , and he was able to use three tele@@ phones and a radio device with his staff and the 15@@ -@@ member motor@@ cycle squ@@ ad@@ ron of the police .
&quot; the majority of participants come from the rh@@ ine valley , &quot; says the german federal minister for economic affairs , &quot; but also from gi@@ e@@ ß@@ en or ful@@ da , from lau@@ ter@@ bach or the ta@@ un@@ us , and even from numerous cities in western germany .
the participating countries are based on a bit of a bit of the resources available for accommodation .
in category i , the participants will be accommo@@ dated in hotels , in category ii in class accommodation and in category 4 .
from the spa town , the cy@@ cli@@ sts had a good impression when they were able to return to their home after a half hours : &quot; t@@ sch@@ üs@@ s ! &quot;
&quot; it was nice to be in bad salzburg ! &quot; win@@ k@@ ler you to leave !
after the arrival in scotland , the british were allowed to leave a short snow@@ -@@ covered break .
but at night , the cy@@ cli@@ sts were in the id@@ yl@@ lic al@@ te@@ bur@@ g@@ park .
under the direction of the scot@@ tish government , the scot@@ tish tourism and urban marketing ( g@@ ts ) park had a beautiful festival programme .
civil rights minister su@@ z@@ anne sch@@ a@@ ab , g@@ ts managing director mar@@ k@@ us ho@@ ß@@ fel@@ d and m@@ sc@@ -@@ chairman wol@@ f@@ gan@@ g wag@@ ner s@@ ach@@ s , in his capacity as a board member of ad@@ ac h@@ ess@@ en-@@ thur@@ in@@ gia .
the three lines show themselves to be very pleased with the &quot; many farms in scotland &quot; .
d@@ j to@@ bi@@ as ha@@ gen announced that he will be performing on the dance stage .
the opportunity to celebrate the 50@@ th anniversary of the opening of the new exhibition , despite the sporting activities on the bike , was e@@ ag@@ erly used .
under the guests , the two guests were increasingly mixed up with citizens who were equally att@@ acked by the good mo@@ od as well as the great she@@ ep of cy@@ cli@@ sts .
on the second day , the cy@@ cli@@ sts were on the platforms bir@@ stein , w@@ ä@@ ch@@ ter@@ s@@ bach and bad or@@ b , including a concert with the tren@@ k@@ wal@@ der@@ n .
yesterday , after 18@@ 0 kilometres , the road to the city of li@@ gn@@ ano was once again the sports enthusi@@ ast .
du@@ t@@ ch-@@ speaking turkish troops have been killed for &apos; dis@@ appear@@ ances &apos; against the government .
overall 33 polic@@ em@@ en were arrested in turkey for the arrest of the turkish police on the grounds of the susp@@ ici@@ on of &quot; con@@ spir@@ acy against the government &quot; .
the police authorities gave no immediate evidence of the fact .
under the dev@@ ast@@ ating circumstances , 14 senior officials have been arrested , mel@@ ted by hur@@ ric@@ ane kat@@ r@@ ina and arrested .
some of you were interested in the corru@@ pt investigations against government officials who included four government ministers in the last december .
in july , a number of turkish polic@@ em@@ en were arrested , because they alle@@ ge@@ dly had organised criminal activity .
the turkish prime minister re@@ ce@@ p ta@@ yl@@ or has announced that he will be re-@@ elected as prime minister .
not all children in the ukraine are returning to school .
schools almost everywhere in the ukraine opened their doors on monday ( 1st september ) after the summer holidays .
this day is tradi@@ tionally a major day for families , and as thousands of other ukra@@ inian parents put prime minister ar@@ sen@@ i@@ j ja@@ z@@ en@@ ju@@ k to the streets of school .
there , the council informed waiting journalists that he had not met all the schools again , that he had decided to go back to the country for future generations : he was a man who was a man of the past .
the september issue of the death penalty has not been held in every school .
the sky is not everywhere above the ukraine peace .
we must ensure that the peace is created .
the entire ukraine , a huge power shared by ukraine , is now in a position to secure a peaceful sky .
ale@@ k@@ san pa@@ stu@@ k@@ how , shoes and other people &apos;s school in sla@@ v@@ jan@@ sk , the j@@ az@@ en@@ ju@@ k &apos;s daughter visits , spoke on russian .
we hope that the council will finally be able to re@@ sume peace here and that the children will be given an education that will be useful to them in the wider life .

the confidence is having a positive effect on two fron@@ ts : internal on the first guard of its own management hier@@ arch@@ y in the bb@@ c , but also exter@@ n@@ ally as the voice of public concern and an@@ xi@@ ety when things are wrong .
the result is a fast and un@@ ten@@ able du@@ o@@ po@@ ly , which is not possible after a complete reform .

the bse crisis has shown that the european union is not a single country , but a whole host of other countries are only 40 pen@@ ce per day .
and an@@ no@@ ying that the bar@@ bar@@ ic is rising on the popular scene , the bb@@ c is once again rising : 53 % support it today , compared to 31 % 10 years ago .

ber@@ ke@@ ley – the world ’ s largest private equity firm – once again explains the housing market for “ normal ” .
one of the most prominent figures in the construction industry in london is the fact that the construction sector is still very much in the south-@@ east of england .
property owners can also use the internet to access their computers .
ton@@ y pit@@ ts@@ burgh , the founder of the company and ceo of the top-@@ class construction company ber@@ k@@ ele@@ y , said on monday : &quot; since the beginning of the current financial year the market has returned to normal transaction levels .
the real estate market in london was a major source of income during the down@@ turn , as foreign bu@@ yers moved to the capital .
after information from the cat@@ aster@@ ide , the data are available in the city centre alone last year .
the average cost of sales is about $ 3@@ 50 , but the average sales price of ber@@ ke@@ ley ’ s private , cheap and student offers rose by around one-@@ fifth last year , and was around 4@@ 23@@ ,000 in late april .
a stronger europe of p@@ ounds has , however , been in property in london for foreign bu@@ yers in recent months - some of them are also threatened by the introduction of new housing taxes and political rhe@@ tor@@ ic .
the london summit of real estate agents is a unique opportunity to take a look at the recent financial crisis .

nevertheless , the desire for a separate home in the capital is not a good thing for ber@@ ke@@ ley , as the due amounts are too high for the selling of fu@@ tures to be more than € 2.@@ 2 billion .

in june , the commission reported on the fact that there were 3,@@ 7@@ 42 new homes in the year up to the end of april - almost a third more than the highest level in 2007 before the crisis .

kr@@ at@@ om brus@@ hes kan@@ n er .
he was a stal@@ em@@ ate , as in i@@ gel , yes .
the last victim of this stal@@ em@@ ate was a straight compan@@ ion of the soviet union , which was promising .

due to their own aggres@@ sive nature , son@@ gs of this kind were no longer released on the con@@ sole .
not for@@ bi@@ dden - nothing was so correctly prohibited - simply not played .

in the eu@@ ph@@ oria of the day , ke@@ ver@@ n began to create an imag@@ inary piano .
ai@@ lingu@@ a ver@@ wal@@ tun@@ g did not understand this .
&quot; the first time i was in the studio , i was in the studio and i was very happy with the result .
the result was that his father had always done to keep letter j .
it had been a game between him and his father , but when he was still small .
his father had it with his own father .
if you have a word with a j , you can do it without two fing@@ ers over your li@@ ps .
it was a very difficult subject to talk about at the time , and it was also not very fun@@ ny now .
he knew that the us military would do so , and he was right .
it had to explain what j@@ az@@ z was .
ai@@ lingu@@ a had a long tradition of teaching .
j@@ az@@ z was , even though he was not directly banned , not played .
the impressive performance of the d@@ j was not a lot more modern .
it was only space for a single room &quot; if &quot; in life .
the people wanted to be involved in the early part of a me@@ lo@@ dy , where they would end up .
similarly , the mind .
his un@@ predic@@ table nature made the people ner@@ vous .
and jac@@ ques and his music was musi@@ cally expressed in mind .
although he was ten years old , he was not a member of the team from sadd@@ y dav@@ is junior , he knew that he was a little bit more about jazz than the half-@@ secret collection of old c@@ ds of his father .
but at least we had to fight aids , not to say that f@@ ats knew w@@ all@@ er black .
in its age , she could probably not remember a time when she was a po@@ ps@@ än@@ ger not black , but a little bit of black .
once again , the idea was not to legis@@ late or impose constra@@ ints .
a con@@ form@@ ity society meant that the people of the region were grateful to the principle of group gi@@ fts .
people with a@@ fro@@ -@@ car@@ ies are often the victims of temper@@ ament and physical construction for under@@ water and sports .
people who have originally been driven by indian sub-@@ continent are now being treated as if they were by nature with electronic talent .
what is still required of the polish community is the fact that the polish government has taken care of the se@@ wage system , which is left by the gre@@ e@@ ks .
those from the gulf states and the le@@ v@@ ante , whose major parents are the country not to be quickly left than was the case when it was done , are now being forced to leave because of fear of hum@@ iliation .
each one according to his abilities .
as they only balance , they were not fit for the purpose of being a bal@@ la@@ d , and they were not able to understand the insul@@ ting words that ke@@ ver@@ n had just heard .
music was the expression of love .
&quot; the people are not really off@@ ended , but they said ke@@ ver@@ n .
in addition to perhaps people whose feet are too big , the world is not always ready .
my father has never ever seen anyone insul@@ ted , but he loved the game .
he represents the people who are the victims of the crime , and he is the only one who has the right to be treated as a human being .
nothing could be further from the sound insul@@ ation of the huge coal industry .
ai@@ lingu@@ a ver@@ wal@@ tun@@ g still does not understand .
why would your father have such a thing to love ?
he wanted to say that it is a ju@@ x , do not hesitate to write in your presence .
you thought that the commission had already thought that it would be somewhat strange .
&quot; it appeared to him lu@@ st@@ ful to &quot; said he instead .
you are sha@@ king the od@@ d and the wrong people .
it was a very good day for us all to see that your un@@ f@@ lin@@ ched race had been a success .
it was not a problem , but it was a problem .
&quot; if you don &apos;t like it , &quot; do not be convinced .
but that explains why the commission is not doing it to me .
you seemed to be honest with them .
are my feet ti@@ red ?
he saw a new way .
your feet are as direct not .
perhaps your k@@ ne@@ es are the best , a little bit ...
and you saw that the people of the world h@@ ate me because my an@@ k@@ les were too th@@ ick ?
you ha@@ ted ?
of course i h@@ ate you not .
the first thing that i would like to say is that this is just the fo@@ ol@@ ish song .
he would have been able to say &quot; i love you &quot; , but for that it was still too early .
&quot; your dis@@ ks are th@@ ick and the same as the reason why you have like me .
i am not a bit disappointed .
the k@@ lan@@ g was not right .
it had ko@@ mi@@ k@@ h to be .
if he tried to get ko@@ mi@@ k@@ h , he brought the other two to trouble , because he was like his father , not over the so@@ o@@ thing charm .
perhaps i wanted to have a cru@@ el father too .
perhaps i wanted to say ke@@ ver@@ n , that is .
despite its friendly eyes .
ai@@ lingu@@ a sol@@ om@@ on@@ s was born in the netherlands in the year 19@@ 45 and was born in the netherlands in 19@@ 45 .
hol@@ under@@ bl@@ ü@@ t@@ ten , so tr@@ un@@ ken@@ he@@ it was not an exc@@ use for him .
in its pa@@ th@@ ological exc@@ itation , it seemed to trem@@ ble , as pal@@ m@@ we@@ del in the stor@@ m .
&quot; and your dil@@ do , is exactly the reason why you have chosen me per@@ verse .
in addition to being a little un@@ happy with that .
you did it sor@@ row , both because of the unnecessary in@@ convenience of his words and the fear that he was in their eyes .
d@@ ach@@ t sie , d@@ ass er sie be@@ lan@@ gen ?
you had given him not the life on the cold planet to the north , but the life of the island was not so great .
the same huge amount of ice cre@@ am is found in the area of the island , as there is on the shore .

the latter would have given her a big f@@ ist if she had not packed up !
you only k@@ nu@@ t@@ sch@@ en - k@@ nu@@ t@@ sch@@ en was this most frequently used word for a ero@@ tic an@@ ch@@ or power between men and women , a counter@@ -@@ po@@ ison to the n@@ est of songs .
after k@@ ver@@ ns , the word was an unnecessary and un@@ necessarily re@@ fin@@ ing , because the cr@@ ut@@ ch itself had already been an act of violence .
ai@@ lingu@@ a sol@@ om@@ on@@ s announced to him by her body a sign to go .
he told us that he had been in the lo@@ ving chair as an old man .
you felt like a woman , and you could not imagine the force of her gri@@ ef .
the reason for this was not the end of the world .
you knew the idea of a new european union .
you saw him at the same time as he was dist@@ ant - as was from a room in the upper floor her compan@@ ion met him - a man who decided to take a shower through something he her@@ self .
a@@ ad@@ am leaves the garden , d@@ ared to .
you felt like a su@@ dden pain , for him and men in general , although some of your hands are raised against them .
a man turned to the police , and the police were pra@@ ying his back , and he was defe@@ ated , without fighting , without any means of re@@ pris@@ als , and so on .
as they were alone , they looked at the other side of the car , and they looked at the other side .
et@@ ching a number of years before the recent events in the united states , es@@ me n@@ us@@ s@@ bau@@ m worked , an intelligent and enthusi@@ astic 3@@ 2-@@ year-@@ old resear@@ cher on behalf of of@@ now , the non-@@ legislative surveillance officer .
&quot; it was already a lot of done , and much still needs to be done , &quot; wrote them , &quot; to make the in@@ n@@ ate aggres@@ si@@ veness of a people that has fought a thousand wars and destroyed most of them , especially in the wars .
but some features are not as un@@ balanced as the camera &apos;s image is .
the higher the cher@@ ry tower , the more it seems that the lower the passion for the church .
the population win@@ ds up when listening s@@ enti@@ mental bal@@ la@@ den , be@@ ats up on stories and is not surprised by the difficulties that exist .
&quot; you have a mis@@ fortun@@ e to be a super@@ power , &quot; he said .
i propose that we should not just talk about nov@@ els .
es@@ me nu@@ ss@@ bau@@ m sen@@ ds its head .
i must also ask : are you a@@ the@@ ist ?
&quot; i believe that the european union must not be a mere spec@@ t@@ ator , &quot; he rep@@ lied .
are you a les@@ bian ?
once again , the european union has been involved in the right to privacy and ref@@ usal to say anything .
fe@@ min@@ is@@ tin ?
once again , silence .
&quot; i wonder what i am saying , &quot; lu@@ ther r@@ ab@@ in@@ o@@ wit@@ z , after all , &quot; because i am against a@@ the@@ ism , les@@ bian or fem@@ in@@ ism .
the problem here is a pre@@ jud@@ ice , not a job .
we are a pre@@ jud@@ ice to the free society .
but certain types of hy@@ per sensi@@ tivity , which is in itself absolutely acceptable and comm@@ end@@ able , can be occa@@ sion@@ ally results , such as they have presented .
you yourself have clearly shown pre@@ jud@@ ice against the church , and these things that you consider to be &apos; ob@@ struc@@ tive &apos; and &apos; ro@@ h &apos; are likely to be taken as seriously by others as an expression of natural strength and vit@@ ality .
if you continue on the her@@ ring road , you will be able to see what has happened , when it happened , as if it were , yesterday .
es@@ me nu@@ ss@@ bau@@ m saw himself as a child , while r@@ ab@@ in@@ o@@ wit@@ z spoke .
behind his head , he repeated an led writer , in fl@@ am@@ ing@@ or@@ os@@ a , the advice that o@@ f@@ no@@ w gave to the country in the last quarter or more .
l@@ ä@@ u@@ len sie i@@ h@@ re neighb@@ our an , wer@@ den sie i@@ h@@ re partner , hear bal@@ la@@ den , visit musi@@ c@@ als , use your phone , speak , explain , listen to them , vote , exc@@ use me .
talk is better than silence .
&quot; i understand absolutely that the point you are looking for is &quot; answered es@@ me nu@@ ss@@ bau@@ m with a calm voice , as she was sure that the word she was her superior was to end , &quot; and i say nothing else , except that we should be .
my concern is that the commission is not prepared to take any action without warning .
this time , it is not the other , but the others that we are interested in .
lu@@ ther ra@@ bin@@ o@@ wit@@ z form@@ ulated a new form of py@@ ram@@ id with the hands .
to make a closer look at the situation , we need to be patient .
&quot; you go to far , &quot; said he , &quot; if you do acts as &quot; errors &quot; , he said that our grand@@ parents may or may not have committed .
you are also going too far in your assum@@ ing that the directive will have its &apos; an@@ ger &apos; and your &apos; mi@@ str@@ ust &apos; on &apos; other &apos; .
it should be no use to have someone in a position to be remin@@ ded that the european union is a community of values in terms of understanding the past and the present .
it was not a &apos; we &apos; and there was no &apos; other &apos; .
it was a time of uncertainty and i think that is all that we know .
&quot; from the one who we hon@@ est@@ ly say to ourselves , &quot; d@@ ared es@@ me to throw &quot; no part of society claim that the world is be@@ having well .
i k@@ iss no one in .
whether it is bad or good , the commission has done what it has done .
the reason was that .
this requires nothing more to be said - we are all agreed on that .
and that is exactly how no blame is to be assigned , and no blame must be ti@@ ed .
but at what point is the past served if we do not learn from it - and this is what we are learning from - and we are not learning from it - and we are not learning from it - that we are not learning from it - ?
the past serves to make the future more forgotten .
if i have something to say on this - and i am not going to say anything about it - i am not going to say anything about it - i am not going to say anything about it - i am not going to say anything about it - i am not about it .
lu@@ ther ra@@ bin@@ o@@ wit@@ z left his py@@ ram@@ id in the dark .
&quot; i will be supporting your report , &quot; he said , and leaving it .
on the next day , when you were as usual to work , the woman was killed by a motor@@ cy@@ c@@ list who , as pass@@ ang@@ ers have described , was in a kind of &apos; brut@@ al r@@ age &apos; .

les@@ o@@ th@@ o military member says that the country is not allowed to hold a cou@@ p ; prime minister remains in south africa , and prime minister remains in south africa .
official officials of the military in les@@ o@@ th@@ o argu@@ ed that the military had a cou@@ p to over@@ throw the government .
prime minister thomas th@@ ab@@ ane f@@ led from the country and told us that he was in the country &apos;s army and that he was going to be building government buildings in the capital of mas@@ er@@ u .
the premium service provided its family with the property , which is ad@@ jac@@ ent to south africa , after he had reported threats of attacks .
military spo@@ kes@@ men , major n@@ t@@ l@@ e@@ le n@@ to@@ i said that there was de fac@@ to no cou@@ p d &apos;@@ é@@ t@@ at , but that the military was prepared to respond to the threat posed by &quot; political fan@@ a@@ tics . &quot;
&quot; what is happening this morning is a very serious problem for the defence forces of les@@ o@@ th@@ o .
the south african government spo@@ kes@@ man , cla@@ y@@ son mon@@ y@@ ela , said that the military action has not given the impression of a stor@@ m .
&quot; even if no one has claimed that the government is acting by force , it is still the government that is all the reports that the activities of the defence forces in les@@ o@@ th@@ o have been indic@@ ative of a cou@@ p d &apos;@@ é@@ t@@ at . &quot;
speakers from the military have been in the region of les@@ o@@ th@@ o to say that the soldiers were in their ca@@ ke and that they were not allowed to get into the capital .
in the meantime , the council vice-president of the european parliament , mr mo@@ th@@ et@@ jo@@ ya met@@ sing , is in charge of government during th@@ ab@@ an@@ es ’ absence .
t@@ hab@@ ane told me that he had been convinced that he was being tor@@ tured for his attempt to combat corruption in the country .
in les@@ o@@ th@@ o there were many people who have been in the process since june , after th@@ ab@@ ane &apos;s parliamentary sessions have been closed because of the disputes in his single government .
he said that his actions had the government not signed up to , otherwise the people &apos;s acc@@ us@@ ations would have been un@@ founded .
production in the euro area on a 13@@ -@@ month low
the rise in the production of the euro area is slow@@ ing down in august to the lowest level in the last 13 months , so a very observed increase in the rate of inflation .
the final mark@@ er shopping manager entry is published on the website of the company .
a speci@@ fication over 50 gives an expan@@ sion .
new orders are expected to be placed and fac@@ tories have been experiencing break@@ down@@ s in a time of rising tension between the eu and russia over ukraine .
the figures are particularly worrying before the european central bank meeting ( ecb ) on thursday .
the markets expect the commission to take a clear plan for dealing with a tari@@ ff cut in the eurozone , and for the im@@ pending de@@ fl@@ ation of a rate of inflation of only 0.@@ 3 % .
it is spec@@ u@@ lative that the us dollar ’ s head , mari@@ o drag@@ hi , has been in the chair of the ecb this week to provide further information as to whether he wants to facilitate quanti@@ tative eas@@ ing for the eurozone , along with the united kingdom .
&quot; although a small growth is better than nothing , it is still the bra@@ king devices that have been driving the growth of the economic and geo@@ political un@@ certain@@ ties for manufacturers that have been made clear , &quot; said ro@@ b do@@ b@@ son , chief econom@@ ist .
the factory building was built in germany , the largest trading partner of russia in the eu , and was then re@@ built in the 11@@ th months with 5@@ 1.@@ 4 .
in the meantime , the number of cases of fraud in the second largest economy in the block , france , the p@@ mi , fell to 4@@ 6.@@ 9 .
france remains a sort of trou@@ ble@@ maker , as does the decline of italy from a solid ex@@ change@@ -@@ rate expansion to a stag@@ nation .
references to the fact that growth stimul@@ i in the key index are not necessarily a problem for germany and spain and the netherlands are not enough .
the decline in industry is fu@@ elling the fire of analy@@ sts , who continue to use monetary or fiscal stimul@@ us to stimul@@ ate .
a positive message came from the republic of ireland , where the p@@ mi has been reduced to 5@@ 7.@@ 3 , the highest level since the end of 1999 .
ho@@ ward ar@@ cher , chief executive officer of the united nations , said : “ we are not a party to the current crisis .
he added that the commission is not responsible for the &apos; producers in the euro area &apos; at present , as the current increased geo@@ political ten@@ sions - particularly in relation to russia and ukraine - are un@@ certain@@ ties in the still difficult conditions in many countries .
this increased investment in uncertainty is having a clear impact on the economy - especially as regards the confidence of consumers , and leads , perhaps , to some emerging markets being dela@@ yed or even cancelled .
he said that the only thing that is more and more likely is that the ecb will eventually be a kind of q@@ e .
the highlight of the decade of the survi@@ v@@ ors of bes@@ lan : ten years have passed since the terrible sie@@ ge of the school .
before the european union was founded , more than 1@@ ,000 people were killed by chec@@ hen mil@@ i@@ ti@@ as in a school in bes@@ lan in southern russia .
more than 3@@ 30 people , more than half of them children , were killed in the three-@@ day mar@@ ty@@ r@@ dom , that the world sho@@ c@@ ked .
we are still looking for bes@@ lan , where we have some of the victims .
that is exactly a decade after the app@@ alling sie@@ ge of the school of bes@@ lan , in which 3@@ 34 people were killed , including 18@@ 6 children , war@@ ned the her@@ o@@ ic trans@@ gres@@ sors of last night about a new apo@@ c@@ aly@@ p@@ tic .
as a fan@@ a@@ tical islam@@ ist terrorist , children and parents on 1 september 2004 , the beginning of a new school year , the country ’ s leaders took cap@@ tive and killed .
the tragedy of the tragedy uni@@ tes west and east in ab@@ hor@@ rent terms , and transformed itself into a surpris@@ ingly different world of action and hope for the future in the mid@@ st of the worst mis@@ ery .
ten years later , we are still in bes@@ lan , and we are now re@@ signing some of the victims who have died in the ab@@ om@@ ination in the class@@ room .
we found surpris@@ ingly young people who were re@@ luc@@ t@@ ant to resi@@ st , even though the memory of this terrorist hel@@ l was always tr@@ um@@ pe@@ ted .
your greatest hope ?
the fact that the war that has now struck ukraine - and in which children and young people are dying - is now coming to an end .
the girl who was killed in trying to get her hands on the cere@@ mony was a very young girl .
you have been invited by the russian star photograph@@ er di@@ mit@@ ri be@@ li@@ ak@@ ov .
it is quite conf@@ using that ai@@ da sought to her mother l@@ ari@@ s@@ sa , now 40 years old .
both were designed for dead and the two were over@@ lived .
&quot; a woman said to me , i should ask for my life , but i could not , &quot; said ai@@ da at the time .
my leg@@ s were bloo@@ d@@ stream , and i was not able to get them to sleep .
i was on and climbing , and i was back to the home after my mother .
a solar panel made it into safety .
after a number of operations , the group was held to be completely heal@@ ed , but yesterday said : &quot; three months ago , the pain returned .
i fear that the commission is not going to be able to do anything else .
some gran@@ at@@ split and other gran@@ at@@ orial sites are still in my k@@ ne@@ e .
your goal is to make the dental practice as easy as possible .
&quot; this tragedy is changing the life of my life , but it did not bro@@ ke me , &quot; she says combat flight .
&quot; the first time i was in the studio , i was told that i had to do this and i cannot change it .
once a year i go on a journey to the sport hall to get to know the people who live there .
my friends and i try to participate in other days not to talk about this .
the pain of this is too great .
my best friend , i am sure , and i will be back in the class d@@ zer@@ a ga@@ po@@ eva .
we played the game together when we were small , and dre@@ amed of being a little bit like a school .
&quot; i want to not mar@@ ry until i have completed my studies and my career is complete .
the hotel is located in the heart of the city , close to the main shopping street .
you say that the commission &apos;s sie@@ ge is always a part of it , although the memory of the event is somewhat weak each year .
i am glad that the commission has been able to count on many people in the world to remember our hor@@ r@@ ors and we are so grateful for the help we have received from people in britain and everywhere .
if i can order the photo of me online , how i can go back to school , i think i can do a lot of people to see it for the first time , understand our disaster and help to prevent this happening again .
the young , who was killed by the ball ho@@ ok , was in the opinion that his mother was dead .
it was his first school day ( ru@@ ins go with 7 years in the school ) and took over the school thir@@ ty-@@ three days .
as si@@ e@@ ben@@ -@@ year-@@ old he said : &quot; m@@ ama told me i should not be allowed to go if it was an explo@@ sion .
after a explo@@ sion , the ship thought it would die .
you said to him : &quot; run . &quot;
full of fear , you can be dead , fle@@ e to the city and saw the next win@@ e-@@ making inf@@ ant , taking it with the hand and fle@@ w through a ca@@ ke ham@@ mer .
his father knew that he had been a member of the family since the end of the 19th century .
he said : &apos; i could not see them save . &apos;
in reality , ta@@ mar@@ a was out there , but the people were not happy with le@@ g in@@ jur@@ ies in the hospital .
after your re@@ unification , she said : &apos; i we@@ pt with joy .
i could not do it .
he ran@@ ked her@@ in and surrounded the city of the city .
d@@ am@@ ir was later transferred to london to work with the british army , which has now been dis@@ solved .
&quot; this hor@@ ror is not only a s@@ cour@@ ge , but i would like to see it re@@ mem@@ bered that &quot; said he yesterday .
but i can say that i am not talking about the same thing in my memory .
i know that the commission is directly following this , and i will be presenting all my to@@ ys .
but now i can use computer games with sho@@ oting scenes .
&quot; i have no fear of being in the sports hall .
i remember the time when i was a child of the same family .
we say never that we want them to be killed or killed .
we say that we need to be able to offer you a wide range of sports and recre@@ ational activities .
i remember the time when i was in the united kingdom , especially when i was a game shop , where i was looking for everything .
but now the council is afraid of place like ukraine , where wars are the kind of un@@ happ@@ iness that can be fought and his friends suffered .
this hor@@ ror is a hor@@ ror that is taking you every day , but i would like to stop thinking about it .
&quot; it is a p@@ ity for me to all those who suffer from the ab@@ om@@ inations , &quot; said dam@@ ir , the last week as a volunte@@ er in a monaster@@ y .
i do not want to help that .
i do not want to go to the police one day and i hope that you will be able to attend the school school next year .
his mother t@@ am@@ ara , 48 , said : &quot; 37 children from our neighbourhood , were killed , and the children can be the ones to imagine .
i remember the time when the european union was so terri@@ bly bur@@ den@@ ed , there was simply no children who were calling and ro@@ aming .
you are remin@@ ded of the great journey you have made to london with dam@@ ir .
the people of london we@@ pt , when i saw our history , and they were all very happy .
i refer to the fact that people were looking for a way to help us to understand our feel@@ ings on the other side of the world .
you have been ch@@ eri@@ e bla@@ ir and your foundation grateful for the prize and the opportunity to work in london in the autumn of 2004 .
i wish that the commissioner could give a speech to ch@@ eri@@ e and simply tell her that 10 years have passed since i was in the chair .
i remember the time when i was in the middle of the day , when i was there , i was very an@@ x@@ ious to eat bor@@ sch@@ t@@ sch and to sm@@ ell them all over the local russian restaurants .
i remember the time when i was in k@@ ell@@ er@@ n with a restaurant , when i was in the middle of the night with his water pi@@ st@@ ol and they were playing with the pi@@ st@@ ol .
and that was just a month after the hor@@ ror of the earth@@ qua@@ ke .
i was surprised to hear that the british were so willing to accept our pain .
you said : &apos; i think always that the question of this world has been un@@ be@@ ar@@ able in these 10 years .
in the ukraine , the war is now continuing , and every day people die , and i believe that many children have been killed .
the first is the children of our children .
i think that the european union is a war for many .
i know that the commission is aware of what these people feel , the whole hor@@ ror .
and i can not agree that the european parliament is not .
nothing has changed .
d@@ am@@ ir was great and is a very gent@@ le and quiet man .
he is looking for not only for reven@@ ge , but for a better life .
i know that the council is not keen to recall that , but it has six close friends from the class and they are occa@@ sion@@ ally going to the sports hall and infl@@ am@@ mat@@ ory c@@ and@@ les there .
as he was smaller , he suffered from the fact - i remember the time when he was sometimes on the sof@@ a - that he had to face us .
not sle@@ eping , his eyes were open .
i remember the time when i was in the chair , he was all his weapons and other military to@@ ys , and he was now 17 , bigger than i , a gu@@ ine@@ a pi@@ g , intelligent and healthy .
i can hardly believe that the commission has spent a few hours so much on the safe side that it is dead and i have never seen it again .
as i was looking for a new home after the explo@@ sion and i was on my le@@ g , i was looking at the hel@@ l around me , with all the tor@@ ches around me .
i was absolutely certain that the commissioner was a little bit too hel@@ pl@@ ess to survive in this hel@@ l .
&quot; i remember the time when i was a little bit an@@ x@@ ious to him , &quot; he said .
but he has not heard it and he is a step away .
and so it goes on , in contrast to that of many others , for us .
george w. bush ’ s “ war on terror ” , 17 years after the fall of the berlin wall , was a popular election , was a popular election in the united states .
the young , whose terrible crime is to be found after the sie@@ ge , as a symbol of the ab@@ om@@ ination of bes@@ lan , is now being held in prison .
tro@@ ll : the be@@ loved of the king of the kingdom , the son of the king , was born in bes@@ lan , after the sie@@ ge in 2004 , and was sent to the right by geor@@ gi@@ j today .
his blood sur@@ ge was a sign of the fear that he was being att@@ acked for his life .
his image was one of the most sho@@ cking symb@@ ols of the bar@@ bar@@ ity of the be@@ sla@@ in people .
his mother fa@@ ti@@ ma , 5@@ 4 , a medical doctor , had asked him for his first day of school , before he was los rus@@ hed , to leave his older son v@@ la@@ di@@ mir to university .
&quot; i promise that i will leave the farm for about two minutes before the terrorists stor@@ med him , and so i stayed my little boy there for three terrible days alone , &quot; he re@@ members .
not quite alone , because there was a whole family of rela@@ tives of us , but they were all killed .
only my geor@@ gian country did manage to get the peace .
the closer this date is , the more difficult it is to find a way of thinking and thinking about it .
it is not a single day that the european union is not bound by this tragedy .
we think not , that it is long ago that i think we have been talking about it yesterday , but i think that it is now time to take a few moments to watch .
no one will ever forget that , the promise i give you .
the in@@ tru@@ sion : the image of geor@@ gi@@ j ( left ) was one of the most sho@@ cking of the attack and was seen as a stat@@ ue ( right ) e@@ ter@@ nal .
i remember the time when i was geor@@ gi@@ j , the president of the russian federation , was so keen to go to school that he said he would like to re@@ treat his teacher .
i knew that the commission was not going to live until i was in the house .
and now there is even this stat@@ ue of the we@@ in@@ en@@ de geor@@ gi@@ j in san mar@@ ino .
george w. bush sees the picture not like , and it is not with us at home in the book@@ shel@@ f .
i understand that , but i think that we should not forget the people of the world , thanks to this picture .
george w. bush says today : &quot; it is important to keep this something as it has never been done again .
&quot; i doubt that the commission will be able to make the truth .
the people are investig@@ ating such trag@@ e@@ dies time and again and never get the truth .
and now we are looking at the cr@@ ash of this bo@@ eing in ukraine .
will we ever be able to know what caused it ?
this world is becoming something terrible .
&quot; i can not understand why the system is possible , because if you do not ask people , no one wants to wage a war , so how is it ?
ten years have not been enough for such pain@@ . it is a very difficult task .
we need do@@ z@@ ens of years to make it a little bit forgotten .
it has my health and i have been feeling the pain of being in the air .
about three or four years of the commission , i had a few night@@ ma@@ res about the sie@@ ge , but then it became better .
i went later in 2006 to the school again and had every day wor@@ ried .
i thought that the answer was &apos; yes &apos; to my friends and class@@ mates who were killed .
that is why i always go into the sports hall when the first september comes closer .
i do not want to use my old child friends to get a chance to do so .
it is hard for me to be in the sports hall , but i am not going to do so .
i feel very much obliged to the rapporteur not to be a victim , but this story is now part of my past .
i will not repeat it , but i doubt it .
my life goes on .
i have raised this year the school and visited the school for medical education in wro@@ c@@ law .
i will be very happy to give you a warm sur@@ gery .
my first choice was a training in the army .
i wanted to have a soldi@@ er , but my health let that not be .
i wanted to say for my country , but that will not happen .
george w. bush ’ s latest report on the “ new economy ” of the united states , on the eve of the world economic crisis , in september 2008 , states that the us is the world ’ s largest economy .
the young , who survi@@ ved , was a little too far from the foot of a mur@@ der@@ ous terrorist .
a mir@@ acle : george clo@@ on@@ ey , the president of the russian federation , was present during the sie@@ ge to the feet of a mur@@ der@@ ous terrorist , but he managed to survive .
during the sie@@ ge , he was able to visit the sports hall and sa@@ iled alongside the bom@@ b , which was on the foot of a mur@@ der@@ ous terrorist .
it is really a mir@@ acle that the council is not killed .
&quot; we feel it , as if it were yesterday , that the world was not just a place for the secret services .
it is always a matter of concern to me that the commission is not doing anything .
i am now older than my age and people say that children are easily hit with bad experiences .
&quot; in 2006 i worked with psycho@@ logi@@ sts and felt very well after that .
and i would like to forget .
in 2005 , the company was the first company to introduce the new product line .
i refer to the fact that i have lost consci@@ ousness .
i will never again go there .
moreover , survi@@ v@@ ors : geor@@ gi@@ j fan@@ i@@ ye@@ v today , with a photo of himself in hospital after the sie@@ ge on the lap@@ top .
my pain is that i am not alone in having a good time .
my friends know that the commission is not keen on this or that i am asking you whether i am not at school .
physical , the way is good .
i should like to be careful with my in@@ ju@@ red k@@ ne@@ e , but i can now run well .
but because of my health i could not participate in the secret service academy of the f@@ s@@ b in saint pe@@ ter@@ sburg .
i have my documents , even the medical records , and you have spoken .
my second passion is to work with animals , so i went to the veter@@ inary institute .
i have a lot of experience there for two years .
he lear@@ ns the treatment of all animals &quot; from c@@ ats to kit@@ tens &quot; .
he said : &apos; i knew that the european union was not going to tell my children about my experiences .
in this respect , children should not be aware of this and they should not , of course , suffer .
his mother marina , 42 , said : &quot; this pain is not leaving me .
he is in my soul , worse than i am when the anniversary is ne@@ arer .
i will be returning to the celebra@@ tions to comm@@ em@@ or@@ ate .
i know that the president of georgia is not going to go .
it must be a little more he@@ f@@ ty for him because he is there and i am not .
i am waiting to see you at home and i could not help .
i am god so grateful that we have been able to return to it , and here in bes@@ lan all of them have been drawn .
it remains in us .
george w. bush is now a mature man who has been killed by a hor@@ ror .
it is hard to understand that .
he is a young , he li@@ kes sport , but he can be a little un@@ popular because of his k@@ ne@@ es .
he was arrested several times and sent@@ enced to death , but he cannot do any sport .
i would say that the report is a very good one for hor@@ ror .
this terrible tragedy has been brought to our attention .
many friends and neighbours have been killed in the sie@@ ge .
i have many people lost , who i have known well and who have been co@@ stly to me .
my son is with me , and that is the biggest gift i have ever received from god .
i know from families that have children who have been born that they have been born , but also from wi@@ do@@ ws who have never been married again .
it is hard to accept that the european union is going on , even if it is not going to .
i will never forget that i was my heart in me .
and now i see that the commission is doing what it is doing - wars in other regions .
what is the purpose of these people ?
why do we kill ?
the war is not a war for our country now , and i cannot believe it .
we were once a friendly and friendly country , how can it be that we are now fighting ?
people and children are suffering , i am sure that in the ukraine , many children have been killed already and still many have been killed .
if we only want to use all these re@@ be@@ ls and take them out - as far away as possible .

4 tips for your better accommodation in the best possible quality .
if you like to take photos or videos under water , there are a selection of devices .
the price of the option is a water th@@ ick@@ ness point plate .
i have taken these photos at a family party with several cameras , which are all part of the price of less than $ 3@@ 50 .
regardless of the equipment , there is a few rules for the best results .
check the availability of your equipment twice .
the fact that you can use a wat@@ er-@@ tight camera makes sure that you have a good battery .
imagine the world of your camera on the photos or videos you want to record .
some cameras and cam@@ cor@@ ders have a scen@@ ari@@ os and resolutions of up to 4@@ 00@@ x@@ 4@@ 80 pix@@ els .
and before you go into the water , check the water level in which the water level is functional .
some cameras are only available for up to 5 feet .
are you looking for a suitable partner for your business in our purchasing guide and for a digital camera for conventional and water@@ proof models .
make your own multiple rec@@ ord@@ ings - because many do not fold .
po@@ in@@ t-@@ an@@ d-@@ sho@@ ot@@ -@@ cameras have a high resolution l@@ cd , which allows you to com@@ pose images that are ac@@ tion-@@ c@@ am &apos;s normally not .
the fact that you have an l@@ cd is still difficult to understand .
so let us make many rec@@ ord@@ ings .
if your camera has a smooth operation , you can use it to capture a number of sho@@ ts with slightly modified exposure settings .
stay tun@@ ed for the best results .
the light is dr@@ as@@ tically worse , the further it moves away from the surface .
if possible , stay informed about the latest news and events on the web .
this will allow you to select more color to your photos ; the de@@ eper you go , the less color you will see .
go to di@@ stances between the objects and you will see the light blue sky .
the first is that it is a good advice on the ground , but it is all the more important because of the poor light conditions .
it is quite important that we have a proper and effective strategy to ensure that you have the most effective and most reliable power .
andre@@ w la@@ w@@ son was a man of the sor@@ te , whose character was changed when he was even in a gi@@ gan@@ tic organization like the n@@ h@@ s .
as a consult@@ ant , we offer a wide range of services for the field of an@@ aes@@ the@@ sia , both for the si@@ ck and for the patient .
under his patients , he rec@@ alls the first time in his life a mi@@ 6 employee was working with the dev@@ ast@@ ating effects of torture .
let us not forget that law@@ son was the only person who was diagno@@ sed and diagno@@ sed with disease , while the treated were mostly associated with something quite different .
one day in 2007 , the company was the one that was not yet able to take the pas@@ sions .
&quot; i have been not feeling that i am &quot; wrote the book in may this year .
i had difficulty in getting up and getting to gri@@ ps with it .
during the war with the fl@@ u similar symp@@ t@@ oms , he was aware that the disease was not only a problem for his wife ju@@ li@@ et , but also a problem for him .
&quot; i want to do everything immediately rather than later &quot; , he noted .
as a je@@ w for a week on a business trip , he felt that he was not alone .
ir@@ on@@ ically , the report was based on the air .
he asked for a colleague to make a x-@@ ray of the x-@@ ray of his bre@@ ast .
only a few weeks ago he was in the french alps for skiing .
the result of the x-@@ ray inspection is a very good one .
he suffered from a br@@ on@@ chi@@ al , a dis@@ cur@@ sive cancer that was not able to prevent bre@@ ast fur , that is , the lun@@ gs , from att@@ acking the lun@@ gs .
as with the majority of cancer cases , the disease is the most serious cause of death .
during the course of the day , some smo@@ kers are exposed to l@@ ung cancer , but not all of the l@@ ung cancer patients have previously been smo@@ kers .
but mes@@ o@@ the@@ li@@ om is different .
in almost all cases , the out@@ let is a as@@ be@@ sto@@ s load - contact with the fi@@ bre construction material once used as &quot; a mir@@ acle &quot; but has now been deemed fat@@ al .
for the majority of us , mes@@ o@@ the@@ li@@ om is a disease that , as easily ignored , can be treated .
as@@ be@@ sto@@ s is , after all , a product of the past .
the dangerous trend is to use as@@ be@@ sto@@ s in britain since the 19@@ 60 ’ s , when the us industry volun@@ tar@@ ily decided to use it .
the commission is also responsible for the implementation of the programme where it has been used .
as a company with an industrial risk from a different time , it seems to be almost more worrying today .
but this self-@@ satisfaction is un@@ timely .
britain , it seems , is experiencing a decline today .
it is more death than the number of people killed by mes@@ o@@ the@@ li@@ om@@ a here than in any other country in the world .
with a total of 2,@@ 500 deaths per year , twice as many people die from this disease as from road accidents .
annual reports on the mes@@ o@@ the@@ li@@ om@@ a deaths since 1980 and pre@@ sum@@ ably future deaths from the uk are a sign of the european union &apos;s solidarity with the united kingdom .
the reason why the european union &apos;s dead@@ ly effects are now being felt , even though as@@ be@@ sto@@ s has been illegal for years ( 1999 , all as@@ be@@ sto@@ s types were banned ) is that a mes@@ o@@ the@@ li@@ om is only developing after decades .
and the s@@ cour@@ ge of mes@@ o@@ the@@ li@@ om is not limited to former workers of the construction industry .
as@@ be@@ sto@@ s was and is often still , in the houses , in which we live , the offices , in which we work , the schools , in which we learn and the shops that we are in .
and so the br@@ ass o@@ the@@ li@@ om does not have class barriers , financial limits , profes@@ sions or old ones .
the privileged position of the bas@@ ti@@ l@@ le , surrounded by elegant department stores in london , and private schools , is not a protec@@ tive area .
the parliamentary buildings are as@@ be@@ sto@@ s contam@@ inated .
the commission has also made a great deal of progress in hospit@@ als where we are supposed to be healthy .
andre@@ w la@@ w@@ son was not old .
he was also not a pl@@ um@@ ber .
it was not easy to find the right solution .
then , he found it out .
&quot; it looks as if the commission is in the tun@@ nels , &quot; he said .
all - students , hospit@@ als , doctors , doctors and nur@@ ses are welcome to use the tuni@@ sian facilities .
it is not clear how many of my old friends are interested in the same disease .
this question was not , unfortunately , able to answer at least partially .
&quot; from the four doctors , who have been working on the gu@@ y &apos;s hospital , the four were the most successful in the last five years on mes@@ o@@ the@@ li@@ om . &quot;
as many of us will have to suffer , we have to be able to do this .
in andre@@ w la@@ w@@ son , mes@@ o@@ the@@ li@@ om was born at the age of 48 .
as he was elected to the european parliament on 17 february this year , he was 5@@ 5@@ 5@@ . he was a member of the committee on foreign affairs and human rights , and he was 5@@ 5@@ 5@@ . he was a member of the committee .
the reason for this was a very long time of life .
fif@@ ty per cent of all br@@ ass o@@ the@@ li@@ o@@ st@@ asis is dying in 8 months after diagno@@ sis .
the disease ends with fat@@ al diseases .
we cannot therefore vote for the report unless we have a clear answer to the question : &apos; how many of us will still be ill ? &apos;
the leading expert in britain , the british expert on mes@@ o@@ the@@ li@@ om@@ a , professor ju@@ lian pe@@ to , suggests that there was a short@@ age of br@@ on@@ ze between 18@@ 70 and 20@@ 50 when as@@ be@@ sto@@ s was expected to come to britain .
the majority of them have no access to the information they need at the moment .

a short look at the ac@@ t@@ res@@ ses of the courts , to which the people concerned often refer for claims for damages , shows how far the s@@ cour@@ ge of the mes@@ o@@ the@@ li@@ um is already spre@@ ading .
in june of this year , marks &amp; sp@@ enc@@ er announced , for example , that he would be prosecu@@ ted by jan@@ ice for all il@@ lic@@ it as@@ be@@ sto@@ s .
you worked nine years in the field of the chain , from 197@@ 8 to 198@@ 7 , and was responsible for the clothing department at two locations - one of them the flag@@ ship store in the netherlands .
mr. r@@ s. all was only 18 years old when she was working at m &amp; s .
now the commission has two children in the 19@@ 20@@ s .
&quot; before this thing , &quot; says she , &quot; had i never had heard of mes@@ o@@ the@@ li@@ om , i knew that she had not even heard anything about as@@ be@@ sto@@ s .
i would never have thought that i would have been interested in that .
it is only a few people who have a lot to say about as@@ be@@ sto@@ s .
the fact is that the term as@@ be@@ sto@@ s does not refer to a substance but to a group of six min@@ er@@ als .
the name r@@ ü@@ hr@@ t comes from the word &quot; as@@ be@@ sto@@ form &quot; , a description of the fi@@ bre structure that res@@ emb@@ les the fab@@ ric resi@@ li@@ ent and flexible .
three of the six were built in the construction industry .

it was designed for roof panels , floor tiles , ro@@ h@@ ris@@ ol@@ dings , bo@@ il@@ er@@ is@@ ers , even for bra@@ ke lin@@ ings in cars .
it is less dead@@ ly than other as@@ be@@ sto@@ s forms , but it is still being used by the eu and the who as &apos; great health risk &apos; with possible death .

j@@ ani@@ ce all has been working hard to be a typical mes@@ o@@ the@@ li@@ om@@ op@@ fer , but the work of ju@@ lian is still a bit of a bit of a bit of a history .
he has a study by the interested parties , in which he shows that &apos; a significant proportion of mes@@ o@@ the@@ li@@ um without known sus@@ pensions is generated by work or probably by as@@ be@@ sto@@ s contact in the environment &apos; .
a large part of these contacts are based on the &quot; normal use and aging of the products we produce .
it looks as if the commission can no longer assume that the european union will be safe .
a report by go@@ d@@ d@@ ard consulting on the implementation of the pal@@ ast of west@@ min@@ ster .
in 2009 , the govern@@ or of the united states reported that go@@ d@@ d@@ ard &apos;s service p@@ acks and pi@@ pes were falling behind parliament &apos;s committee rooms with as@@ be@@ sto@@ s , whose dead@@ ly fi@@ b@@ res were replaced by something as harm@@ less as &quot; strong air &quot; .
parliamentary members are often accused of being a victim of their own interests .
during the f@@ s@@ fe &apos;s director@@ ate for parliamentary work insi@@ sted that the west@@ min@@ ster palace was a &apos; clean health certificate &apos; , the commission is still not aware of the need to provide 1 billion £ of work over several years .
the govern@@ or of go@@ d@@ d@@ ard also pointed out that the &apos; european parliament &apos; has a greater presence in the world than the one that is currently being applied in the member states .
no one can know whether this mis@@ management will cost lives .
all that is needed is a political commitment to ensure that the process is completed .
a person who has not yet been able to contact as@@ be@@ sto@@ s is gra@@ ham ab@@ bot@@ t , a general practi@@ tion@@ er .
as andre@@ w lam@@ bert said , the council of 50 years ago , the us is likely to be a “ patient ” during his work in hospit@@ als .
&quot; i have been working in a hospital , in which as@@ be@@ sto@@ s complaints have been positive , &quot; he says .
it is so difficult to imagine the full range of places where the people of europe worked , and to remember the data .
what is he really interested in ?
he was 45 , and led just late in the evening an operation .
suddenly , the first sho@@ oting i had was .
it was quite suddenly that .
i felt that i was hor@@ ri@@ ble .
i thought that the commission &apos;s trip home was no longer possible .
as a doctor , i knew that ab@@ bot@@ t was the cause of the pain from the ch@@ est , the skin around his lun@@ gs .
but how j@@ ani@@ ce told everyone he had no reason to use a mes@@ o@@ the@@ li@@ om .
he went a month not to work .
the commission did not surprise me with x-@@ ra@@ ys , which were a source of pan@@ ic , and did not use pla@@ u@@ ra@@ kat@@ he@@ ther to extr@@ act flu@@ id from the lun@@ gs and test it in the laboratory .
his complaints remained un@@ resolved , however , without diagno@@ sis .
his health is better than that , and he returned to the place where he was .
from time to time , the us ’ s symp@@ t@@ oms have returned , often after sporting activity .
2011 saw a patient with a bot@@ t with similar symp@@ t@@ oms in his practice and was later treated with mes@@ o@@ the@@ li@@ om .
but the commission has also now combined this not with its own case .
finally , his patient was a few decades older than his father and had direct contact with as@@ be@@ sto@@ s .
the connection to the internet was clear .
in september 2011 , the situation deterior@@ ated in ab@@ bot@@ t ’ s state and his family doctor brought his c@@ t-@@ sc@@ ans and x-@@ ray images to an expert group .
in december 2011 , ex@@ cer@@ pt of the first world war , exactly two years after ab@@ bot@@ t was si@@ ck , a medical treatment facility equipped with a camera was put into the ca@@ ve between the ri@@ b and the ch@@ est .
i am a optim@@ ist .
i am concerned about the fact that the commission is not here .
frank@@ ly , i had not expected to be so much wor@@ ried .
but ra@@ kh@@ el , ladies and gentlemen , was wor@@ ried .
the result of the bi@@ op@@ sy was the same week between christmas and new year .
gra@@ ham ab@@ bot@@ t : diagno@@ sis of mes@@ o@@ the@@ li@@ om
suddenly , the commission had a meeting with the ma@@ z@@ mill@@ an government hospital in brussels , which was supposed to have met him .
only now did he con@@ cei@@ ve the extent of the ep@@ ide@@ mic .
&quot; it turned out that the first time as@@ be@@ sto@@ s was widespread , especially in large public buildings , where ro@@ h@@ s were often used with as@@ be@@ sto@@ s , &quot; he says .
the people who have been exposed to as@@ be@@ sto@@ s in these buildings are suffering from it .
and so it is mes@@ o@@ the@@ li@@ om that now meets younger people who are not in the typical profes@@ sions .
the most dangerous routes are the ones with as@@ be@@ sto@@ s soli@@ ds in hospit@@ als , which were below earth , so patients probably were not exposed to the substance .
but many employees , who are in pede@@ strian tun@@ nels , from a building to the other , ( as andre@@ w la@@ w@@ son ) or in underground areas , are not aware of the fact that they are working in the same way .
it shows that the european union has been a major player in the field of health care for patients for several decades after the war , but life@@ -@@ threat@@ ening to treat the doctors .
he will also be here today .
students were able to present their bun@@ sen@@ bren@@ ner on as@@ be@@ sto@@ s mat@@ s .
and it concerns not only hospit@@ als .
as@@ be@@ sto@@ s is a very popular choice for people who want to live in a peaceful environment .
the school is also a good place to start .
indeed , many people have probably seen the first contact with as@@ be@@ sto@@ s in the class@@ room .
everywhere in the country , in thousands of chemical companies , the authorities have their bun@@ sen@@ bur@@ ners on as@@ be@@ sto@@ s mat@@ s .
on websites , the subject of as@@ be@@ sto@@ s is now frequently raised in schools .
and the latter has so un@@ inno@@ cent items in our houses as foot@@ -@@ base plates or sc@@ al@@ p e@@ gg@@ s by default .
&quot; it is a industrial giant , a man who is in large parts of our property , &quot; he says .
in a case , the only contact that was one affected woman was the one who was ab@@ ri@@ g@@ ated by a garden s@@ na@@ p in the 197@@ 0s .
so please adjust to the way you want to protect your garden shoes .
the impact of diagno@@ sis , and this is something that we know is incur@@ able , is not known .
&quot; it takes a while to get it to work , &quot; says gra@@ ham ab@@ bot@@ t .
i went back to work and tried to get on .
i was two weeks in the practice .
then , i knew that the commission had to go and look after myself .
well , i &apos;m going to not give any more christmas party .
with the largest difficulty , the council &apos;s perspective was changed from the position of a doctor to that of a patient .
as i have heard many patients before him , he re@@ members how over@@ powered he is by all the information he has had to deal with .
&quot; it was very hard to get all this in , &quot; he says .
&quot; i asked the man who was going to be in the hospital for a long time &quot; .
and it was given me about 12 months .
i remember the time when i was in the middle of the day , i was not going to give a new christmas party .
the reason for this was that the commission was not prepared to accept the amendments . &quot;
mes@@ o@@ the@@ li@@ om is especially insi@@ di@@ ous , because it is our life saving mechanism - the at@@ ro@@ city itself - that it is not possible to prevent the dead@@ ly cancer .
the majority of cases of me@@ te@@ o@@ the@@ li@@ om are caused by as@@ be@@ sto@@ s contact .
as@@ be@@ sto@@ s consists of small@@ est fi@@ b@@ res .
if the as@@ be@@ sto@@ s is up@@ loaded and the fa@@ thers are in@@ hal@@ ed , we can rely on it in the ch@@ est , the skin around the lun@@ gs .
as@@ be@@ sto@@ s fi@@ bers ir@@ rit@@ ate the ch@@ est and can cause cell mu@@ tations .
&quot; the problem ar@@ ises with the in@@ hal@@ ed na@@ del@@ f@@ -@@ shaped as@@ be@@ sto@@ s fi@@ b@@ res , &quot; says professor tom tre@@ as@@ ure , a hear@@ t-@@ thro@@ at scienti@@ st , who was involved in the gu@@ y &apos;s hospital in 2001 .
that is precisely the hospital that we are talking about , mr law@@ son , that is supposed to have left him in as@@ be@@ sto@@ s , now is ir@@ on@@ ically , a leading centre for the treatment of mes@@ o@@ the@@ li@@ om@@ a .

from nature , it is of great importance to inv@@ a@@ sive from the very beginning .
the usual options for other cre@@ atures are : the use of br@@ ass o@@ ils , the use of a br@@ on@@ ze , the use of a br@@ on@@ ze , the use of a br@@ on@@ ze o@@ xide , the use of a br@@ on@@ ze .
the effectiveness of an operation is , for example , highly controversial .
some say that the commission has tried to make a difference .
choose the right fon@@ t for your needs .
&quot; you can &apos;t use the ch@@ est co@@ at , but you can &apos;t cut it .
you come with the k@@ ni@@ fe not around .

&quot; sometimes there are bor@@ ing long-term survi@@ v@@ ors , &quot; says tre@@ as@@ ure .
but at the end they all die .
fortunately , the majority of patients actually live long , much longer than expected .
the author ste@@ ph@@ en ja@@ y go@@ ould star@@ b died 20 years after diagno@@ sis .
two and a half years after his own diagno@@ sis , gra@@ ham ab@@ bot@@ t is still strugg@@ ling .
after having been a br@@ ass the@@ li@@ om , he came to the united states and was in contact with andre@@ w law@@ son , who was diagno@@ sed four years after his diagno@@ sis .
&quot; hel@@ lo , creativity and innovation center , &quot; he turned to an@@ no@@ tations of mer@@ ry .
&quot; he was very positive , &quot; says ab@@ bot@@ t .
he had his diagno@@ sis 4 years earlier .
originally , ab@@ bot@@ t had six chem@@ other@@ ap@@ y cy@@ cles , and the first two were in operation for four months .
&quot; i was cra@@ zy , i was &quot; he says .
i wanted to give up .
let us not forget that la@@ v@@ son managed to &quot; put things in a more positive light &quot; .
after the consultation of several doctors , the commission decided to extend the scope of its treatment with prof@@ . lo@@ ic lan@@ g-@@ la@@ z@@ dun@@ ski , car@@ di@@ ov@@ as@@ cu@@ lar specialist at the gu@@ y &apos;s hospital .
&quot; we had a advantage by having a lot of work done on the project , i called for a simple and easy way to get an appointment , &quot; says gra@@ ham .
a normal user can use the same file to transfer the money to the recipi@@ ent .
money is crucial to br@@ on@@ chi@@ o ’ s suff@@ e@@ rers to maintain the best available therap@@ ies .
but if these treatments are eventually un@@ avo@@ id@@ able , they will be a source of serious health problems for many people - over and above the future of families they leave .
and so we can contact you to the courts in the hope of compensation .
andre@@ w la@@ w@@ son cont@@ acted the gentoo linux kernel team about the problem .
&quot; it is since 18@@ 98 known that the as@@ be@@ sto@@ s is extremely dangerous for health , &quot; says mor@@ gan .
but what is happening in the 19@@ 60 ’ s is not a matter of re@@ alizing that even a very small number of people are at risk of health .
and here i started to compla@@ in that companies were not doing enough .
andre@@ w la@@ w@@ son and gu@@ y &apos;s are now in the team and they are looking for a solution .
after the investigation into his death , the council confirmed that he had not been able to make any changes to the as@@ be@@ sto@@ s fi@@ b@@ res in the bas@@ ement area concerned in the 199@@ 0s .
the reason for this was andre@@ w law@@ son &apos;s late arrival .
as as@@ be@@ sto@@ s can be removed , it is possible to remove as@@ be@@ sto@@ s without using the same method as as@@ be@@ sto@@ s .
indeed , it is a matter of urgency for mes@@ o@@ the@@ li@@ om@@ a patients seeking compensation to be able to obtain a huge problem , namely the fat@@ al contact of a company or a job .
many of their previous employers are sold or closed .
insurance documents can be lost .
and those who are not opposed to claims that are not being respected by the people who are fighting against them , but certainly not with the compla@@ in@@ ants .
as a result , there was a very clear new legislative initiative this year , which will allow mess@@ o@@ the@@ li@@ um patients to be better informed about compensation .
the law has a value of $ 1.@@ 7 billion promoted by the insurance industry .
in these cases , the classes of the pla@@ in@@ ti@@ ffs receive 80 % of what a court can do in a normal process of damage compensation - about 1@@ 20@@ ,000 £ .
about 300 successful drive applications for the programme will be submitted each year .
andre@@ w mor@@ gan thin@@ ks like so many mes@@ o@@ the@@ li@@ om@@ -@@ affected people that 3@@ 50 million £ a &quot; very good job &quot; of the insurance industry .
&quot; the first time i was in the world , i was in the united states , and i was very pleased with the results .
the same year , mi@@ ke pen@@ ning , the then working and reti@@ rement minister , also announced that the law &quot; does not perfect &quot; .
but both pen@@ ning and mor@@ gan gave too much to expect in the face of seven deaths .
&quot; the people suffer so much and need more help today , &quot; said pen@@ ning during the second hearing of the mes@@ o@@ the@@ li@@ um law in december last year .
the following year , gra@@ ham ab@@ bot@@ t was the first woman to be appointed professor of economics at the university of applied sciences in la@@ z@@ dun@@ ski .
after your first deliber@@ ations , the committee on legal affairs recommended that a sur@@ gery be carried out , which , unlike tom tre@@ ac@@ ur@@ e , was a positive operation .
this was confirmed by a radiation therapy that was conducted by a chem@@ other@@ ap@@ y - a tri@@ ple therapy .
ab@@ bot@@ t feels that he has been strengthened .
&quot; the first thing i want to say is that it is the most important thing , &quot; ab@@ bot@@ t says .
the situation is still very clear in patients .
it is a bit of a question for you to continue .
if you are interested in the music , you can get a bit worse .
gra@@ ham ab@@ bot@@ t signed the agreement in march 20@@ 12 , and the united nations security council ( un ) has been elected to the european parliament .
at the end of august he had the last of the six chem@@ other@@ ap@@ y cy@@ cles behind him .

then i had the opportunity to meet a sc@@ an in march 20@@ 14 .
it was a great day for us to have a good time .
i was just 50@@ th of a year old , and i was born in the town of k@@ is@@ sim@@ me@@ e , where i was born .
the first thing that is at stake is the fact that this is not a viable option .
the first step is to make sure that the children are able to live in a decent environment .
once again , the government of ab@@ bot@@ t under@@ took six chem@@ other@@ ap@@ y cy@@ cles .
now it is not a tr@@ ace of t@@ um@@ ours that is visible .
but the incident was not physi@@ cally and ment@@ ally correct .
you must be interested in practical things - about the money , if i am no longer , for example , or my wife show how the bo@@ il@@ er@@ ze@@ it@@ hal@@ t works .
if you are having bad news , you will be negative .
you must search for the future .

china ref@@ uses to grant hong kong the right to vote , demonstr@@ ators swe@@ ar to the re@@ tali@@ ation , and the chinese are threat@@ ening to re@@ tali@@ ate .
on sunday , the european parliament decided , despite the increased number of calls for democratic reforms , to vote against the nom@@ ination of candidates for the 20@@ 17 elections by the hong kong electoral authority .
this approach is a source of pre@@ sum@@ ably hum@@ ili@@ ating pro@@ tests in hong kong .
the decision of the chinese people ’ s congress allows the communist leaders to make a fundamental choice of all non-@@ pe@@ king candidates .
&quot; the only thing that comes out of the picture is that we are an@@ gr@@ y , &quot; said a legal expert , em@@ ily la@@ u , chairman of the democratic party .
the first thing i want to say is that it was not what beijing promised .
it has been called the inhabitants of hong kong , and it is a very good idea to have a good time .
and it is clear that the only way we can deal with an author@@ itarian regime is to have a government .
in his defense of china ’ s decision , li fe@@ i , vice secre@@ tar@@ y-@@ general of the standing committee of the national people ’ s congress , said that public nom@@ inations for hong kong ’ s government elections would be &apos; cha@@ otic &apos; .
since 1997 , when britain was under control of hong kong , china has been a country that has been losing control of hong kong .
the chinese leadership presented a new way of thinking about sunday ’ s decision , because it was a democratic break@@ through for hong kong ’ s citizens , but the decision makes no sense either .
after a new clause , the only candidates to be &quot; with love for the country and love for hong kong &quot; will be &quot; allowed &quot; .
the decision follows a summer , in which some of the largest and most popular sports events in the world are held in hong kong for several years .
behind the pro@@ democratic campaign in hong kong , there is a oc@@ cu@@ p@@ y central with lo@@ ve and peace movement .
on sunday evening , the members of the european parliament met in brussels in a few hours after the announcement .
in the demonstration , the leaders of the international monetary fund said that their movement needed a new stage of civil dis@@ o@@ be@@ di@@ ence and that they would pro@@ tests in the coming weeks .
you made it clear , however , that the commission had not requested any details , and that it was apparently trying to avoid problems with the authorities .
in a online communication , the members of the organis@@ ers stated that the &quot; the best way to fill the district was to call the district of the central district , a move that was only possible if the district was all dialo@@ gues .
it is a p@@ ity to say that the commission is now in the process of being se@@ ized by all the opportunities for dialogue and that the occupation of the central district will be defini@@ tively taking place .
the authorities in hong kong are already working hard to find a solution to beijing &apos;s announcement that it will be a good thing to have a referendum on the beijing declaration on sunday before the government building .
the un@@ rest in the region is exac@@ er@@ b@@ ated by the feeling of many in hong kong that they are slowly losing control of their city .
the competent authorities are responsible for the security of the data and the security of the data .
in addition , the fear of the us ’ s values being under@@ min@@ ed by democracy and freedom of speech is growing under the growing pressure of beijing .
some cri@@ tici@@ zed the demonstra@@ tions of oc@@ cul@@ p@@ y centr@@ al-@@ movement , because they were not able to stop business - the life see@@ ds of hong kong - .
&quot; the pro@@ tests that we are talking about are likely to have major economic damage , depending on how they are organised .
we want no fear of being forced to accept hong kong as a non-@@ state .
this impression is bad for investment .
the heads of state or government controlled china reported that the chinese government had recently reported on the country &apos;s democratic activi@@ sts as being threatened by western powers .
in this summer , the activi@@ sts organised an un@@ official referendum on the new elections in order to bring 7@@ 8@@ 0,000 people to power - more than a fifth of the voters in hong kong .
in july , tens of thousands took part in one of the largest democratic demonstra@@ tions in the region ’ s history .

a company profile is a key word for the company that no new book@@ ings have been made , since the service is only just being introduced , i added that the service was &quot; students who have already completed the service in the next few weeks &quot; .
the company participated in the first two years of the company ’ s study fees , which were around £ 9@@ ,000 per year .
students today are different in their expectations and demands .
the national student card is a cri@@ tici@@ zed service , however , as being removed .
me@@ gan dun@@ n , vice-president of the nu@@ s for high-@@ school education , said : &quot; this offer seems to be completely separate from the lives of the majority of students .
many students , who have been working with the study this month , are facing a crisis in the cost of living , because the available financial aid is being used in the form of loans and grants not with the shar@@ p@@ ly rising b@@ ills for the simpl@@ est living conditions .
fe@@ min@@ is@@ te@@ ens cri@@ tici@@ ze r@@ aci@@ al and polic@@ ing after fer@@ g@@ us@@ on
the un@@ armed conflict in te@@ en@@ ag@@ ers was declared a national reserve by a police officer in fer@@ g@@ us@@ on , mo@@ . the k@@ ill@@ ings were carried out at the beginning of this month .
the participants were able to put their hands in the air and san@@ g , &quot; hands high , not sho@@ ot , &quot; while they were in the waiting room .
after two weeks of work on the new version of the game , fer@@ g@@ us@@ on , mo , has been sho@@ c@@ ked by the un@@ armed te@@ en@@ ager michael brown .
after your experience , we@@ is@@ ses fem@@ in@@ ist comm@@ ent@@ ators use the gender to the race , if it is a matter of re@@ productive rights and income inequality .
during the ten@@ sions in the middle west , however , and throughout the country , the country saw pe@@ re@@ z as a threat to the responses of white women by 100 % to the race .
in comparison to the answers black and white women shortly after the sho@@ ts of 9 august , the personal es@@ says were filled with tit@@ les such as &quot; thoughts on fer@@ g@@ us@@ on of a white woman &quot; and &quot; fem@@ in@@ ism is not only concerned about the women .
but for per@@ e@@ z , the situation was an important change .
&quot; i believe not , that you can be in fem@@ in@@ ism many people who have the knowledge of this and are privileged in such high-@@ class places .
the people felt that they were being forced to do something about the events that took place .
it is characteristic that the european union is experiencing a crisis of which we are all aware , and because the situation in fer@@ g@@ us@@ on is so eth@@ n@@ ically that it must express it .
for english speaking students , the k@@ ori@@ th@@ a mit@@ ch@@ ell of the o@@ hi@@ o sta@@ te uni@@ ver@@ sit@@ y. fer@@ g@@ us@@ on brought out problems that black americans have to face every day , which are not considered as &apos; women &apos;s issues &apos; .
&quot; i can do something fun@@ ny on fac@@ e@@ book about me and my partner .
if i have something to say about how far@@ b@@ ic the images are in your own country , i am sure that the silence is e@@ ars an@@ aes@@ thetic .
&quot; how can it be for women to be assured publicly about a relationship that is not just about security in the public sphere ? &quot; he asked .
for black and white women and mit@@ ch@@ ell , who have a race , sex and sex@@ u@@ ality in the history of the usa , there is no den@@ se , but between r@@ aci@@ al and sexual orientation problems .
for them , black and white women have not the luxury of being able to clean up the themes ; they live every day in the combined world .
during the white women are now the subjects of race and gender in the fem@@ in@@ ist main@@ stream media , the issue of women is being discussed by ang@@ ela hat@@ ter@@ y , a professor of women and gender research at the george mas@@ on university .
&quot; between 18@@ 65 and 18@@ 90 , at least 10@@ ,000 black men were yellow women .
white and white women had to be involved in history to make the ly@@ n@@ ch@@ murder a justi@@ fication .
for hat@@ ter@@ y , the division between the white and black women came at the point where the white women fought .
&quot; you met the people of the world who are fighting for women &apos;s right to vote , and the right to vote for black should come later , &quot; said hat@@ ter@@ y .
if you look at such things , you will see that you are a man of the dark , why white women are not d@@ read@@ ful .
we have our job in the past , and we have done it well .
we have never seen black women help to make their hus@@ bands and s@@ ons pay for their lives .
the commission has also made a commitment to the principle of equal opportunities for women , even after they were given the right to vote in 19@@ 20 .
the group was founded almost 40 years after the original request for help from the black women , says mit@@ ch@@ ell .
for lunch and dinner , the river is white , and the white fem@@ in@@ ist re@@ actions to the events that fer@@ g@@ us@@ on raises - polic@@ ing , race discrimination - are a mirror of time , in which white women are the main characters .
&quot; would it not be great if the commission &apos;s activi@@ sts , who have such traditional fem@@ in@@ ist platforms , were to have the right to education for a child so seriously ?
fe@@ min@@ is@@ te@@ ers of the second generation who have started their career in the fight for re@@ productive rights and access to contrac@@ ep@@ tion are now being forced to leave their country .
the famous white town of fem@@ in@@ ist acti@@ vis@@ t gl@@ oria st@@ ä@@ m went to the university of vienna two weeks after the sho@@ oting of michael brown .
&quot; i hope that the women who have a different , but parallel , relationship with the world will be able to make a woman in@@ he@@ rent danger - and think about the reven@@ ge , which is held in public surve@@ ys .
although st@@ ony is a rather interactive , it is a very interesting and interesting subject .
christian : i am a member of the german association of american enterprise institu@@ tes and authors .
it is now hundreds of countries that have special programmes for girls and young women , but almost nothing for bo@@ ys .
but when the white house was recently a small program that my bro@@ thers &apos; , the people were not really aware of the vulner@@ abilities of young black and he@@ is@@ a@@ he men , there were an@@ no@@ ying re@@ actions from many fem@@ in@@ ist women , including myself .
the relationship between the police and the black community is not the only problem , that the police have to focus on main@@ stream fem@@ in@@ ism .
after the us border police have been working for nearly 6@@ 3@@ ,000 un@@ accompanied min@@ ors on the sou@@ th@@ west border of the country this year , the country &apos;s issue of immigration reform is again coming to the surface - this time as a women &apos;s issue .
andre@@ a mer@@ c@@ ado , co-@@ chairman of we bel@@ on@@ g to@@ ge@@ ther , one of the leading organisations for women in immigration reform , has been saying that the european union needs a new look at the issue as a major women &apos;s issue .
&quot; this is a good thing for themselves , &quot; said mer@@ c@@ ado .
if the big majority of the working vic@@ a were to be paid to male immigrants , they would be women who would ac@@ company them in a position that would be difficult to find for domestic violence and exploitation .
&quot; this stories are found in a sustainable manner in the women &apos;s organisations , &quot; she said .

the hotel is situated in the heart of the old town , in a quiet street , just a few minutes walk from the main square .
real estate agents , real estate agents , said that the pi@@ g on the photo is the pe@@ ts .

in the ex@@ pos@@ é of the house , con@@ nel@@ les described the former ver@@ sam@@ m@@ lun@@ gs@@ haus as a &quot; unique one-@@ family house with a bedroom . &quot;
although the maastricht treaty bro@@ ke the image , the bro@@ ker did not appear to be able to access advertising material .
the house sale sor@@ ted the last few years of interest in the social media , when some asked whether the pi@@ g was included in the purchase price .

a lo@@ t@@ tery player from har@@ ve@@ y is back in the month to play the game .
the search for a new mil@@ li@@ on@@ air@@ e in the sou@@ th@@ west of per@@ th takes a happy long time , with a happy winner from the lo@@ t@@ tery on saturday almost 1.@@ 1 million $ .

we thought that the european parliament would be able to make such a profit .
eight wat@@ t winners will have the chance to win in the first division of last month .
in the last week , a player from can@@ ning v@@ ale was one of the five mil@@ li@@ on@@ ai@@ res in august , after a couple from bel@@ mon@@ t had just been awarded the me@@ ga@@ -@@ gain of $ 7.@@ 5 million .
the si@@ eg@@ er couple had been living in the united states for twenty years and said that the profit allows them to travel around the world and buy a new home .

le@@ oni@@ das bas@@ s in the gl@@ ad@@ di@@ at@@ orial arena of the city of le@@ on@@ id@@ as .
not only the gl@@ ad@@ in@@ ators were standing on the an@@ k@@ le deep in the mat@@ sch at the first rh@@ ine bath day in the recre@@ ational park .
but the an@@ ch@@ or power of the event was strong enough to be heard well over 1000 yesterday .
it was a colour@@ ful hor@@ se@@ -@@ riding of shows , shows , games , exhi@@ bits , and a lot of information about the time of the roman@@ s and their importance to the rh@@ ine country .
the main attr@@ action of the day was undoubtedly the mar@@ ti@@ alist batt@@ les that took place from the gl@@ ad@@ in@@ at@@ orial school &quot; am@@ or mor@@ tis &quot; , which was founded every ra@@ in@@ break .
gl@@ ad@@ i@@ at@@ ori owners &quot; le@@ oni@@ das &quot; tell me that they were human beings .
first , the &quot; pro@@ voca@@ tive &quot; were involved in the series with rec@@ tan@@ gu@@ lar and short ho@@ les , and the leg@@ s on the left le@@ g and arm .
it followed a series of &quot; es@@ se@@ d@@ ari@@ i &quot; with ch@@ est sign , short s@@ word and sa@@ usage lan@@ ding as well as iron glass d@@ ash .
i am particularly impres@@ sed by the performance of the &quot; re@@ tin@@ ari@@ us &quot; , which was awarded with the lit@@ ter net , tri@@ ple and dol@@ ch against the &quot; sec@@ ut@@ or &quot; and was later awarded the bur@@ ial ground .
as kr@@ at@@ om ’ s s@@ words scr@@ at@@ ched one another , the shi@@ el@@ ds sh@@ ep@@ pe@@ red and the lit@@ ter lan@@ ces f@@ led sur@@ round the arc@@ tic , that a fear and ban@@ g will be around the health of the glass .
but , in the end , the imposing &quot; su@@ ms of gl@@ ory &quot; had been followed by the mus@@ cu@@ lar re@@ fe@@ ree , an always atten@@ tive eye .
&quot; we wanted to give the roman everyday life a new meaning and to promote the culture of the roman era .
after two years of preparation , the first building was built in the park for one day .
finally , the roman@@ s did not only war@@ fare and con@@ quest in our region , but also the roman culture and numerous buildings .
moreover , the remains of these were still visible during the roman day .
the front wing is a new generation of water and energy supply .
the commission also confir@@ ms the diplom@@ a survey engine@@ er r@@ alp@@ h he@@ ili@@ ger from the &quot; engineering team two &quot; from rhe@@ in@@ bach , who is responsible for measuring instruments of the roman@@ s such as ch@@ or@@ ob@@ at , gro@@ ma or di@@ op@@ tra .

impressive , the new foot@@ print of the new york times , published by wol@@ f and fu@@ ch@@ s two mill@@ en@@ nia ago .
2011 was the office for soil preser@@ vation , at the national association of the rh@@ ine region , with the remains of a roman villa in the business park nor@@ d in rhe@@ in@@ bach .
it was a f@@ encing wall of an economic building with a lo@@ an to dry .
the building i have probably converted to a villa rus@@ tic@@ a , an agricultural property , explains the history of the city .
a number of fine art objects are found in the area of the town of s@@ anti@@ ago de compos@@ te@@ la , a large glass tower , several fine works of glass and a number of or@@ nam@@ ental nec@@ kl@@ aces .
the villa has a lot of charm from the first to the fourth century .
in her team , the children also worked with the roman wind m@@ ill game , similar to the current m@@ ü@@ h@@ l@@ esp@@ i@@ el , or they wrote as the roman pu@@ pil@@ s once wrote their names with metal gri@@ ps on paper .
on the bo@@ oth of the roman thermal ba@@ ths z@@ ü@@ l@@ p@@ ich , the children could lay mo@@ sa@@ ics themselves , at the stand of the rhe@@ in@@ bach glass museum glass mo@@ sa@@ ics and at the state of the ei@@ fe@@ l natural centre .

the commission &apos;s proposal , for example , is to establish a roman legi@@ on on from its work at the upcoming wa@@ ch@@ t@@ berg , to serve as a living mon@@ ument from the roman era and to present a fun@@ ny lesson in international understanding .
the a@@ den@@ dor@@ fer gr@@ un@@ d@@ sch@@ u@@ le is dedicated to the topic of the roman theme within the framework of a project week .
with the roman army week , the numerous events that are often no longer on the horiz@@ on are to be seen at first gl@@ ance in w@@ ach@@ t@@ berg .
in the w@@ ach@@ t@@ ber@@ ger ra@@ th@@ aus , a small presentation is given to the fun@@ k of the ber@@ k@@ um mat@@ ron@@ en@@ heim sanc@@ tu@@ ary in 18@@ 7@@ 9 .
e@@ bol@@ a : the ep@@ ide@@ mic is bur@@ den@@ ed by west africa ’ s economy and by the global economy .
the e@@ bol@@ a ep@@ ide@@ mic in western africa is also a serious and serious b@@ low to the economy .
markets are vulnerable , and the commission has been doing so for many years .
the ver@@ tical sc@@ ales of the e@@ bol@@ a ep@@ ide@@ mic are making the economy of west africa a severe b@@ low .
the er@@ har@@ v@@ est is ro@@ lled on the fields , the min@@ ers are leaving and the markets are w@@ ash - that virus has destroyed the region .
the commission also has a number of international companies already taking a di@@ stan@@ ce. the commission is not in a position to do so .
&quot; the e@@ bol@@ a ep@@ ide@@ mic is not only a medical crisis , but also a economic &quot; , ur@@ ges the head of the african development bank , don@@ ald rum@@ s@@ fel@@ d , to do .
li@@ ber@@ ia is the hard@@ est hit , and the country is the most affected .
&quot; it is a total destruction of the earth , we lose a lot of money , &quot; says al@@ ha@@ ji b@@ am@@ o@@ go , who is on the second largest market in liber@@ ia &apos;s capital , mon@@ ro@@ via clothing .
on the market , only the ones who produce food or anything to dis@@ inf@@ ect embr@@ yo@@ s are marke@@ ted .
li@@ ber@@ ia is the hard@@ est hit by the virus , and it is already falling victim to the fe@@ ver here , with more than 600 people .
recently , the us health authorities stated that the disease was in every corner of the country .
the commission has also made a commitment to help gu@@ ine@@ a , sier@@ ra le@@ one and ni@@ geria to eradic@@ ate the virus .
overall , more than one million people died in the last few years , thousands more have gone to the hospital .
foreign companies prefer employees to work in the company .
everywhere in the resource centres , the rich countries use companies to operate .
foreign companies such as steel corporation , ar@@ cel@@ or mit@@ tal , are moving their employees away , and several international airlines are flying the affected regions no longer .
the commission &apos;s proposal to establish a european network of independent information centres is a step in the right direction .
in some areas in sier@@ ra le@@ one and li@@ ber@@ ia , which are under quar@@ ant@@ ine , the situation is getting worse , including the areas of the export sector .
the farmers d@@ are not to vote for the har@@ v@@ est at home .
food is scar@@ ce and the food is scar@@ ce .
&quot; the people will always be less and less travelling &quot; , says phil@@ li@@ pe de v@@ re@@ yer , paris expert for the economy of west africa .
the man to be a man usually on the market , for example , and selling his vegetables , remains at home .
the population is therefore given the consequences of the ep@@ ide@@ mic directly and urgently .
on the markets , the market is falling , and the food supply is falling .
at the same time , the highly in@@ deb@@ ted region of the world , which is highly dependent on international firms , is threat@@ ening to create an image with far-@@ reaching consequences .
the biggest danger is that the international companies will be able to use the area for a long time , as phili@@ ppe hu@@ g@@ on says , from the french think tan@@ k ir@@ is .
the key is how far and how long the system will continue to spread .
in the case of investors , it may seem that it is dangerous to invest in gu@@ ine@@ a , sier@@ ra le@@ one and liber@@ ia .

resistance to the plans is also expressed by the c@@ du national associations , which are based in bad@@ en-@@ w@@ ür@@ t@@ tem@@ berg and rhe@@ in@@ land@@ -@@ p@@ fal@@ z .

tax burden on business people in the washington area is rising with the economic recovery of the us economy .
a recovery in the economy means more customers , more sales and more new jobs .
you are also making higher taxes .
state and local authorities are not required to pay tax on domestic companies last year .
companies in the district , the mar@@ y@@ land and vir@@ g@@ ini@@ a paid together 2@@ 7.@@ 7 % of the total amount to government and local authorities in the 2013 financial year , an increase of 3.@@ 8 % compared to 20@@ 12 revenues .
the state and local government tax burden on companies increased by 10 % last year .
state taxes have increased more than the local taxes , and the government has increased by 4.@@ 3 % , according to the study carried out by the service agency .
more than half of the tax revenue of the district , 5@@ 6 % , comes from the corporate tax , while 36 % of revenues are from mar@@ y@@ land .
vir@@ g@@ ini@@ a achiev@@ es a tur@@ nover of 28 percent of the lowest tax revenue from companies .
a large part of the rise in the tax revenue is due to a recovery in real estate values for companies , say the researchers .
during a large part of these profits are from large countries such as california , new york , and tex@@ as , it seems that the process is also very difficult for washington .
companies in the district , mar@@ y@@ land and vir@@ g@@ ini@@ a paid together for over eur 10 billion in government and local real estate taxes last year , compared to the sum of eur 9.@@ 6 billion in 2012 - an increase over a year .
but the apparent weak@@ ness in the housing value is not so great in mar@@ y@@ land as in raising interest rates and loc@@ alities .
companies in vir@@ g@@ ini@@ a and d.@@ c. pay almost half their government and local tax .
&quot; in mar@@ y@@ land , the following happens : a large part of the real estate , especially in the tax area around d.@@ c. , is either owned by the government or by non-@@ profit organizations that do not pay real estate taxes , &quot; dou@@ gl@@ as dou@@ gl@@ as managing director dou@@ gl@@ as lin@@ d@@ ale lin@@ d@@ holm said .
mar@@ y@@ land is therefore forced to move to , for example , the income tax system , which is much more important than the tax on services other countries offer .
the recent recovery in the tax revenues from companies can no longer be attribu@@ ted solely to the recovery of the real estate market .
corporate governance and corporate governance also seem to be reco@@ vering , so the data .
companies in the region reported that the number of low-@@ income tax benefits among government organizations has ris@@ en from $ 2.@@ 3 billion in comparison to $ 2.@@ 1 billion in 2012 .
mar@@ y@@ land took 1 billion dollars to the company ’ s in@@ puts .
during the trend of the past years , the company has grown to become a global leader in the field of tax , not just in the three places .
the an@@ ch@@ or rate in the district was equal to the 4@@ ,@@ 3 percent increase in the national average , while the rise in mar@@ y@@ land was significantly higher , 4.@@ 9 percent .
only vir@@ g@@ ini@@ a reported a sub@@ average growth in tax revenue of 4@@ ,@@ 1 percent .
vir@@ g@@ ini@@ a has a population of 6 % in all three areas of office .
the company tax rate in mar@@ y@@ land is about 8@@ ,@@ 25 percent and in the district at relatively low rates .
a compar@@ ative study by the us chamber of commerce at the beginning of this year showed that vir@@ g@@ ini@@ a had lower government and local corporate taxes .
in the study , the district committee was not investig@@ ated .
despite the advantages , vir@@ g@@ ini@@ a is under pressure from its southern neighb@@ our .
nor@@ th car@@ ol@@ ina is a law on reducing its corporate tax rates in this year from 6.@@ 4 % to 6.@@ 9 % .
if the state continues to increase its income targets in the coming year , this law could reduce corporate in@@ comes by up to 20 % by 20@@ 17 .
in the meantime , the commission seems to be able to help small businesses in the washington area , and they are therefore paying more government and local taxes , as the recent study shows .
corporate taxes , which are seen as personal income taxes by small business@@ men , are not a transitional structure , according to which most small businesses are organised , in the district , mar@@ y@@ land and vir@@ g@@ ini@@ a , grew by more than 20 % last year .
the formula for the research is that the trend and the rise in the number of corporate taxes throughout the country is likely to continue this year , with an increase in general multi-@@ defence tax revenues for the state and local authorities .
nevertheless , the space of washington could be lag@@ ging behind if the prospects for spending cuts in the federal government were to focus on the labour market in the region .
partnerships with the german and european beer industry .
ho@@ ps and mal@@ t - also in china a popular bre@@ ed .
german law on beer has a high reputation in china .
frankfurt ’ s partner city in china wants to be a bre@@ w@@ ery and also hopes for an air direct connection between the two cities .
german law on beer , used for the production of beer in frankfurt ’ s partner city gu@@ ang@@ z@@ ho@@ u – this is the urgent desire of the official chinese .
&quot; we would be very pleased if you would like to have a german bre@@ w@@ ery located in our city , &quot; said the vice party secretary of the south china metro@@ polis , li y@@ iz@@ we@@ i , in this week at the visit of a sp@@ d .
whenever you have a question , the func@@ tion@@ alist of the ruling communist party of china has come to this point of view during the course of the discussion .
gu@@ ang@@ d@@ ong is a city in the west of the country , and is the capital of the united states .
therefore , the member states have the power to buy , to make a commitment to german beer .
the h@@ ess@@ en sp@@ d leader , thor@@ ste@@ n sch@@ ä@@ fer@@ -@@ g@@ ü@@ m@@ bel , who has supported the german political delegation , said to the host that he would be in germany after a possible partner for the project .
&quot; for bi@@ er needs a lot of beer : good water , gra@@ in and food joy &quot; , added the author of the &quot; mit@@ ta@@ de@@ e &quot; lunch .
this way of life is already be@@ ating mr li , s@@ mil@@ ing his heart and making his way to the host .
the commission then met with a great deal of criticism from gu@@ ang@@ z@@ ho@@ u , who was not allowed to take part in the debate , but with red wine , which was served at the meal .
the chinese brand t@@ sin@@ gh@@ ag@@ ta@@ o exp@@ ands to german bre@@ wing art .
t@@ sin@@ gh@@ ad@@ o-@@ bi@@ er is produced according to the german pur@@ ity law .
more business transactions and more business are needed .
a second wish of the chinese hosts would be an air direct connection between frankfurt and gu@@ ang@@ z@@ ho@@ u .
the air han@@ sa had the flight earlier than the one in 19@@ 45 , but for economic reasons it was cancelled .
&quot; it would be worth it again &quot; , showed himself the municip@@ al politici@@ an convinced .
&quot; the business is conducted between our two cities and the traffic is increasing &quot; .
at present , travellers would have to travel via chan@@ g@@ sh@@ a in the province of hun@@ an , compla@@ in li .
the commission &apos;s administration of gu@@ an@@ aca@@ ste also , whose capital is gu@@ ang@@ z@@ ho@@ u , is ho@@ ping for the airline link .
the vice-president of the commission , mr k@@ all@@ as , has been appointed to the board of directors of the province .
&quot; the first time i have had a good idea , &quot; he rep@@ lied , &quot; sch@@ ä@@ fer@@ -@@ g@@ ü@@ m@@ bel , chinese vice minister li j@@ in@@ ju@@ n , a german in@@ timate con@@ no@@ iss@@ eur , was no@@ d@@ ding .

li y@@ it@@ we@@ i was a member of the board of directors of the board of directors , but not yet in this role .
he came only in this year &apos;s office , after his pre@@ dec@@ essor was arrested for corruption charges .
the council of ministers of local political parties wan q@@ ing@@ lian also had to go .
the commission &apos;s approach to the civil serv@@ ants from gu@@ ang@@ z@@ ho@@ u is part of a national campaign against corruption in party and administration , supported by the head of state x@@ i j@@ in@@ ping with har@@ sh sanctions .
the new top politici@@ an li y@@ i@@ we@@ i recently had a very difficult job to do before his party career for an american company , which is very unusual in china ’ s communist party .
before joining the commission , he was responsible for the political and economic consequences of the war .
frankfurt is officially more than a do@@ zen cities in europe and the rest of the world .
the connection to the 9@@ 000 km long beach of gu@@ ang@@ z@@ ho@@ u is one of those that has been bloc@@ ked by both sides , for example by a student exchange .

amaz@@ on is buying t@@ wit@@ ch for 1.@@ 0@@ 4 billion $ .
amaz@@ on is a registered trademark of amaz@@ on .
the announcement of the release comes as a surprise , not because nobody wants to take over t@@ wit@@ ch , but because it is widely believed that you@@ tube is a tool that will be able to buy .
before three months , it looked as if the european council had been allowed to sell t@@ wit@@ ch to the video service of google for a cool bil@@ li@@ on-@@ dollar cause , and cooperation seemed to be a natural one .
t@@ wit@@ ter , the first internet site in the world , was launched three years ago , as a general stream of news and news .
instead , it was quickly transformed into a platform for players who want to share their bra@@ v@@ ura pieces in games , a &quot; you@@ tube &quot; for live games .
the t@@ wit@@ ch-@@ interface .
and &apos; let &apos;s go and see what &apos;s going on in the video game .
it is not the case that you@@ tube is a very popular video game when you use t@@ wit@@ ch .
it is a myster@@ y that the commission &apos;s dec@@ ree on yo@@ ta does not make sense .
all that is needed in the current context is a new statement by e@@ ma@@ re@@ t she@@ ar , president of t@@ wit@@ ch : &quot; we have been working for amaz@@ on .
a further secret of the hotel is , frank@@ ly , the incredible success of t@@ wit@@ ch .
for snow@@ boar@@ ders like me , who explain that they prefer sport , than to watch , the situation is difficult to understand .
it is a matter of giving a friend a free lunch at 3 a.m.
all these games could be played right now .
a different problem is that the commission has not yet received many of the most popular games today , so it can be seen without its own control over the perspective of the game .
i admit that the commission is not in a position to be very quick about the rapid pass@@ ages through which our electronic age is entering into full play in record time .
but as long as there is no game or hum@@ or@@ virtu@@ os@@ is , it is not possible to use its t@@ wit@@ ch channel as much as it is .
but what do ske@@ p@@ tics like me know about this ?
t@@ wit@@ ter is supported by 55 million different visitors per month .
and how exactly does am@@ az@@ on intend to make money from this ?
it is hard to imagine how the european union could be a great place to live in amaz@@ on .
but t@@ wit@@ ch has something that is worth every company .
as the chairman of t@@ wit@@ ch , s@@ he@@ ar , said , amaz@@ on is not a t@@ wit@@ ch .
on the hill , you can see the castle festival , the most important event of the year .
the concept of the organis@@ ers agreed .
despite the strong growth in the rain , the weather on saturday evening was estimated to have been 1@@ 200 music fans .
at times , the inv@@ it@@ ational had to be stopped .
&quot; the first time i had to wait for the next album , &quot; said ron se@@ m , one of the organis@@ ers .
sal@@ z@@ w@@ ö@@ l@@ den l lic@@ ht und fun .
for two spanish words , we have max@@ im sa@@ x@@ ra@@ j and ron s@@ em .
because the open air in the sal@@ tw@@ ater valley bur@@ g@@ gar@@ ten is meant to be a bri@@ ght@@ ness day and evening through various shows .
well , and the fun comes so@@ wi@@ es@@ o from alone .
the result was already clear at the early evening when the commission &apos;s first visitors were invited to the open air .
a festival for all generations had the organiz@@ ers promised to .
and that is not what you have succeeded in doing .
around the clock , the power stations on the bur@@ g@@ gar@@ ten me@@ ado@@ w had a lot of fun , but also guests from the surrounding and the surrounding area .
you pursued a policy of the first live performances in the uk , wi@@ ped the foot in the t@@ act , enjoyed cool air drinks - just in short : relaxation pure and pleasure were declared .
and that qu@@ er by the generations .
during the last few years , some have been looking for blan@@ kets on the extra white sand on the beach bar , while others have been on a quarter of wine in the vin@@ o@@ the@@ que lab@@ ten , while others have been killed on the hills .
but the same applies to the children ’ s sn@@ app@@ ing .
the larger commercial users used the k@@ ick@@ er@@ tables or participated in a sk@@ ate@@ board workshop .
until the great re@@ vol@@ t came .
in the early 17@@ th century , the city was bur@@ ned down by the visitors , especially families of the town .
but the attractive nature of the festival did this not leave a break@@ down .
&quot; it came more people than expected &quot; , said r@@ on s@@ em , who was led by a &quot; success all over the line &quot; .
that is why i am not in favour of a repeat of the great party next year .
although the commission has no intention of changing the content and size of the event , se@@ m has made a first assessment of sunday &apos;s performance against the popular vote .
as an an@@ no@@ ying note , he called that in the meantime the admission was sto@@ len .
obviously , the security firm was too little in the way of staff .
the result : some who are already paid , some who were not on the ground .
the re@@ son@@ ance is very good , but the sound is very good .
in a first preliminary cau@@ tious es@@ timate , the sal@@ tw@@ ater employee co-@@ organiz@@ er spoke of about 1@@ 200 visitors who had been in the bur@@ g@@ gar@@ ten .
problems occurred in the implementation of sound .
the sal@@ tw@@ ater re@@ ef hi@@ p-@@ hop band bloc@@ k@@ s@@ `@@ n@@ `@@ ro@@ x bro@@ ke up because it was un@@ ner@@ v@@ t .
the technical experts were not able to find the correct half-@@ way sensible compromise .
the planned measures for shi@@ sh@@ a loun@@ ges could not be built , because the t@@ ents were not equipped for ti@@ re loading because of a ty@@ re pan@@ e .
&quot; in the next year you will be there &quot; , says the organiz@@ er .
the premium edition of the am@@ u@@ la@@ -@@ open air@@ . the first was from the number of visitors .
and that is the case with bad weather .
however , the organis@@ ers have made some mistakes , which could be correc@@ ted for the first time , but in the second edition , the number of errors must be elimin@@ ated .
the european union is also a social network of fac@@ e@@ book , and the organiz@@ ers must be critical .
&quot; sorry , but i &apos;m not yet in the euro 12 ! &quot; , said the author of the album mel@@ ani@@ e me@@ i@@ er at the event page .
&quot; you have a lot of fun with me , &quot; says the e@@ le zim@@ mer@@ mann .
other people see the initial problems not quite as closely .
i think it is very good that some people are not just st@@ up@@ id , but that they are really trying to do something about their leg@@ s .
h@@ ats off ! &quot; , wri@@ tes ste@@ ph@@ ani@@ e jen@@ ß to the am@@ ula .
now , the organiz@@ ers have a year to decide on these critic@@ isms .
new discount for the rad@@ om in ber@@ k@@ um : wat@@ ch@@ t@@ berg ’ s land@@ mark shr@@ ink shr@@ ink your life .
the commission is expected to do this .
rather , the commission &apos;s ready part is waiting for the mar@@ gin of construction to be used .
the action is in the context of a major measure : almost 50 years after the launch of the space observ@@ atory , ti@@ ra , the shell , the so-called rad@@ om , is completely renewed .
the new rad@@ om will be equipped with a di@@ ameter of 4@@ 7.@@ 5 meters a little less than the old one .
the size remains the same , however , and the world record remains .
the last step to re@@ fine the directive is to complete the existing cap .
the top of the city ’ s old h@@ ul@@ l is separated and is covered with a cr@@ ane .
after that , the last quarter of the new shell is set up .
if the weather is playing , the hotel ’ s action should be on the stage at the beginning of this week .

dra@@ g the bur@@ gun@@ dian clubs to the table again soon ?
finally , there were repeated dis@@ agreements between the two cl@@ ou@@ ds ’ houses in bur@@ gun@@ dy .
now we think of the management board as a possible cooperation .
as a model for the reconstruction of the wol@@ fr@@ at@@ sha@@ us@@ en castle , the late richard wag@@ ner , who had died , led the former chairman of the wol@@ fr@@ at@@ sha@@ us@@ en bur@@ gun@@ dian friends , to the french gu@@ é@@ del@@ on project .
i was in the middle of a year ago , when the bur@@ g@@ vere@@ in and the bur@@ g@@ fre@@ un@@ de wol@@ fr@@ at@@ sha@@ us@@ en were not in a good climate .
the hotel is very different from the rest of the hotel , and the views of the wol@@ fr@@ at@@ sha@@ us@@ en castle and the possible reconstruction of the old town were to be appro@@ ached in a very different way .
now move to the two camps , and the two are supposed to be talking about a common approach soon .
the confirmation of the association &apos;s management board is tor@@ ste@@ n s@@ j@@ ö@@ berg ( bur@@ g@@ vere@@ in ) and her@@ bert pi@@ ff@@ l ( bur@@ g@@ fre@@ un@@ de ) on request of our newspaper .
&quot; i have already written to mr pi@@ ff@@ l and he has proposed that we get together once &quot; , he reports .
in his view , all members of both parties could in future return participate in the same race .
for example , faster visible succ@@ esses are to be recorded .
during the bur@@ gun@@ dian people around the su@@ dden death of the richard ni@@ x@@ on , the bur@@ gun@@ dian people were re@@ building the castle on the mountain forest until the last time , the bur@@ g@@ vere@@ in around s@@ j@@ ö@@ berg has a &quot; .
her@@ bert pi@@ ff@@ l , the second chairman of the bur@@ gun@@ dian friends , has , according to his own information on the call .
since di@@ mb@@ ath@@ s death , he has been standing in front of the bur@@ gun@@ dian friends .
a new chairman is due to be appointed in a general meeting in mid-@@ september .
at the moment , the association is one of the most important members of the 7@@ 4-@@ year-@@ old organisation .
&quot; after the death of my friend , richard , i was able to take part in the unification of the german and european union from respect . &quot;
according to pi@@ ff@@ l , the new chairman will then be invited to discuss with the bur@@ g@@ vere@@ in .
until then , we could have a situation where the bur@@ gun@@ dian friends could also have a current mo@@ od within their group .
a candidate for the presidency is available at the moment , but pic@@ ard says .
&quot; but i am confident that the next step will be someone who will find himself &quot; .
the new chairman should be a wol@@ fr@@ at@@ sha@@ us@@ er .
the t@@ ö@@ l@@ zer wo@@ ol is interested in the project &quot; but would like to continue working &quot; .
the different positions of the european union on reconstruction are being pic@@ ked up in the eyes of pi@@ ff@@ ls .
he acknowled@@ ges di@@ mb@@ at@@ h as &quot; mi@@ sion@@ ary &quot; , who always works on the reconstruction of the castle .
two similar , already well advanced , models are being developed in austria and france to show that these ideas are not a pi@@ pe dream .
by means of a high level of participation by the population and by volunte@@ er assistance from all over the world , you are a tourist mag@@ net .
pi@@ ff@@ l : &quot; also i was at the beginning s@@ cep@@ tical .
but in the course of time i am more and more convinced that the european union is useful to have the project moving forward &quot; .
here you can find some information about the different types of products .
moreover , the project would be financed by eu subsidies , visitor numbers , and potential don@@ ors .
&quot; the idea of re@@ building the country is something i personally do not want to take simply over@@ board , &quot; he hopes , &quot; he says , that the bur@@ g@@ vere@@ in may be moving a little on this point .
their aim , the history of the first time , was to &quot; be important and good &quot; .
after that , we could continue to see .

in fil@@ m@@ making for a slightly older target group , it seems that the target group is not the same as the quality of the films .
in july , the entertainment industry compared the two largest media companies in the world with the same record .
the results are based on the analysis of the child &apos;s opinion and the cri@@ tics of film , and indicate that the children of this year &apos;s films are similar to those of last year .

due to the climate changes that have been expected in the summer of 20@@ 15 , including a@@ ven@@ gers , age of ul@@ tr@@ on , mini@@ ons and je@@ al@@ assi@@ c world , other representatives of the film industry are more optim@@ istic , however :

as a few years ago , when the second table tennis district class was founded for the purpose of ti@@ ghten@@ ing the lift division , the first table tennis club was closed .

&quot; we wanted a positive response , &quot; says the secretary of state thomas sch@@ r@@ am@@ me@@ l , who , with his splendid leadership vol@@ ley of the six@@ teenth century , was in the 14@@ th minute on the road to victory .
&quot; i have looked at how to make a good job of it .
as a shr@@ ine , at the 13@@ th nov@@ m@@ ber 2010 , the first time in a bun@@ des@@ lig@@ a game , the team was still there for ri@@ ed .
the first championship course in the german racing team was held in the same building in the city of dres@@ den .
&quot; for me , the thing is very special , i am from the ra@@ pi@@ d after@@ market . &quot; , said sch@@ r@@ am@@ me@@ l .
due to the short-term exposure of the b@@ ore , the b@@ ore of mari@@ o pa@@ ve@@ lic , sch@@ ram@@ me@@ l , from the left , was turning to the right def@@ ensive side and made his case very well there .
he has had enough experience to work on this position in mirror .
the gate has been opened , but it has been closed this year for some assi@@ sts , &quot; p@@ raised bar@@ is@@ ic .
man@@ n@@ heim shows character sch@@ ram@@ me@@ l delivered the first f@@ lan@@ k to the 2 : 0 through ho@@ f@@ mann .
because before that , the commission ’ s guests could have been informed .
&quot; god be than@@ k@@ ful , we have had some lu@@ ck today &quot; , also sch@@ ram@@ me@@ l , who is thus respon@@ ding to the break@@ -up of performance and results over the past few weeks : &quot; the results have not been positive , but that was .
bar@@ il@@ o@@ che is a town in the north of the island , with a population of about 3@@ 5@@ ,000 .
the first three-@@ point plan since 26 july i therefore proved that the commission &apos;s team team fab@@ ric is the back@@ bone of the game , despite the set@@ backs : &quot; today my team has shown that it is in character &quot; .
for him not min@@ der , the fact that he has been able to return to zero once again is no good .
much work has been done during national p@@ ause , including the fact that the british team has won the first round of the world cup with bri@@ an beh@@ ren@@ dt , mari@@ o pa@@ ve@@ lic , chri@@ stop@@ her di@@ bon , den@@ i al@@ ar .
&quot; you can &apos;t do that &quot; , ma@@ h@@ mou@@ d bar@@ is@@ c war@@ ned , who has been working with armed forces over the past three days , and pa@@ ve@@ lic player lost &quot; the people who have been very stable recently &quot; .
the long@@ est part of the national break must therefore be sufficient to allow &quot; w@@ ounds to le@@ ak and to &quot; bre@@ a@@ the a little bit &quot; in the physical area , &quot; explained bar@@ i@@ sic , who has wa@@ ited five u@@ 2@@ 1 .
one , the other , who may be particularly interested in p@@ ause is captain ho@@ f@@ mann .
he is cr@@ ying out for the man@@ n@@ heim team , he goes over pain .
it is precisely in this difficult phase that he has shown that he is a very important player for us &quot; , kon@@ sta@@ ti@@ sed bar@@ is@@ c .
ho@@ f@@ mann gave the game r@@ ap@@ id &apos;s front door to his ex@@ change@@ -@@ over in the 6@@ 8@@ th minute , but also achieved the second goal .
for the 3@@ 3-@@ year old , who has lost his 3@@ 50@@ th national league game , he has been able to win the first h@@ its of the game since november 2 , 2013 ( 4 : 2 on the ad@@ mi@@ ra ) .
ho@@ f@@ mann : &quot; may not believe that the time has come to think that everything is good &quot; &quot; . we certainly have had a little lu@@ ck , but at some point the happ@@ iness also has to come back to us .
now it was high time &quot; , said ho@@ f@@ mann .
he makes a point of remin@@ ding us , however , that the work must not be allowed to be black and white .
we have seen in recent weeks not so bad played , as the honourable member has said .
we must not forget , however , that the time has come to do everything right now .
the importance of its role in the team was not dispu@@ ted .
it is quite a good idea to have a very young team at the moment .

the only thing that we can do is to blame the team .
as you know , we have too little accounts .
interior def@@ enders maxim@@ ili@@ an kar@@ ner saw it as though &quot; it has just been badly started , then we have purely found and even a gate made .
in general , the commission would have been more involved .
under this will , the eu is in a state of ru@@ h , and the country is in ru@@ h .

putin ’ s rise to power
in a interview with the president of the state television channel one , he condemned putin ’ s government for its military campaign to re@@ con@@ qu@@ er the country ’ s secret areas , which were kept by separ@@ ati@@ sts in the eastern regions of don@@ et@@ sk and lu@@ han@@ sk .
the kre@@ m@@ lin and the separ@@ ati@@ sts have recently demonstrated the in@@ tru@@ sion of the territory that has been taken .
putin is aware that the us is a country that has been a victim of the campaign of ukra@@ inian politicians for the elections on 29 october .
&quot; we must immediately provide detailed discussions , and not just on technical issues , but also on political organisation of society and the state status of the south-@@ east coast , in order to protect the interests of the people living there , &quot; he said .
p@@ es@@ k@@ ov said that the putin regime is failing to make reference to state@@ hood in the context of the greater autonomy that he has been advoc@@ ating for months .
only the ukra@@ ini@@ ans government can guarantee the eastern territories the necessary autonomy and ensure that the country is not left alone .
it is not a question of negotiations between ukraine and russia , he said pes@@ ko@@ v , &apos; because it is not a conflict between russia and the ukraine .
the clari@@ fication of the kre@@ m@@ lin spo@@ kes@@ man on correc@@ ting the &apos; false pre@@ tation &apos; of putin &apos;s regime &apos;s remarks under@@ lined the leadership of russia in dealing with the separ@@ ati@@ st re@@ bel@@ lion .
mo@@ sk@@ au could have done much more to help the regions of the danube and lu@@ han@@ sk in the eastern ukraine .
the autonomous region of the az@@ o@@ res , which is recognised by russian diplom@@ ats at international forums , would be depri@@ ved of the regional governments in ukraine of their own trade agreements and external relations , thus giving the kre@@ m@@ lin de fac@@ to control over a territory .
the recent decision to susp@@ end the use of the peninsula in the black sea , which was anne@@ xed five months ago , is the home port of most russian na@@ vy and an important commercial port and historical coastal region .

the ukra@@ inian presidency has been invited to visit the country , pe@@ tr@@ o por@@ o@@ sh@@ en@@ ko , in his speech on the in@@ aug@@ ur@@ ation of the new government on 7 june .
but his idea of autonomy is not in sharp contrast to the reality of the kre@@ m@@ lin and the separ@@ ati@@ st re@@ be@@ ls .
putin ’ s last call for russia to stop ki@@ e@@ v from using separ@@ ati@@ st leaders to keep up with the situation is now followed by a further incident in the country ’ s re@@ be@@ ls .
the information supplied by russia is a source of concern to the separ@@ ati@@ sts , who , according to ukra@@ inian security officials , are the first step in a campaign to take over the strategic coastal region up to cri@@ me@@ a .
for this reason , massive investment in civil and military preparations for the future is under way to prevent mari@@ u@@ po@@ le , a steel industry that is strugg@@ ling with 500 000 inhabitants .

because for the first time in his life , the head of the supreme pri@@ est bre@@ w@@ ery was killed yesterday by bike on the fel@@ d@@ berg .
for the good purpose .

other people , however , were more likely to be able to cross the el@@ f kil@@ ome@@ tre long route between ho@@ he@@ mark and fel@@ d@@ berg .
nor@@ man di@@ e@@ ß@@ ner , for example .

the dur@@ ch@@ t@@ ra@@ in@@ ite main@@ zer says : &quot; it &apos;s a &quot; ambitious &quot; man racing bike .
the commission must also be able to do so , because it was not in agreement with the &quot; fix@@ ie wheel &quot; , which is also a racing bike , but without a circuit ...
the fact that it can be loc@@ ked up even without a wheel is proven not only by the 20 hi@@ kers who cross the white wall and the fox bar , but also by the many other people who have been walking on the mountain .
mountain bike hire : you can find a lot of information about the mountain bike in the mountain bike rental section .
the 7@@ 18 participants - and therefore the number of participants who have never been here - were divided into groups in the morning .

ben@@ t han@@ sen , chairman of the association &quot; ra@@ de@@ en auf den gro@@ ß@@ en fel@@ d@@ berg &quot; , gave the start comm@@ ands and wanted the participants a nice trip .
