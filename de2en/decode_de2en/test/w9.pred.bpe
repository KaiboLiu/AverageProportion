a re@@ tro@@ spec@@ tive of the very american ideal of labour rights as human rights
congress m@@ ps ke@@ ith el@@ lis@@ on and john le@@ w@@ is have tabled a legislative proposal to promote trade union organization as a civil right .
&quot; just as unions die , so do mid@@ d@@ le-@@ class jobs , &quot; el@@ lis@@ on , a min@@ n@@ es@@ ot@@ a democr@@ at , and depu@@ ty chairman of the progressive c@@ au@@ c@@ us in congress .
i am therefore proud to be part of the staff council , together with the civil rights icon john le@@ w@@ is .
this gr@@ ound@@ breaking law gives workers the same legal opportunities in discrimination against the organization of trade unions as in other forms of discrimination - thus stop@@ ping anti-@@ union forces .
the addition of the national labour law act to provide a possibility for workers who are exposed to discrimination to organise trade union representation to be tried in a civil court for justice - and to demand compensation or penalty money - is also necessary .
but it is certainly not a radical initiative - at least not according to american standards .
indeed , the best way to understand what el@@ lis@@ on , le@@ w@@ is , and the other spon@@ sors of their legislative proposal suggest is to link back to a very american idea .
despite the set@@ backs that trade unions have suffered in recent years - in wis@@ con@@ s@@ in , mic@@ hi@@ gan and other states throughout the country - americans once welcomed countries around the world to exercise labor rights that are not .
there was a time when millions of americans re@@ mem@@ bered when that country was building democracy , freedom of speech , freedom of the press and the right of association in one bre@@ ath .
when the united states occupied japan after world war ii , general dou@@ gl@@ as mac ar@@ th@@ ur and his staff encouraged the country to adopt a constitution that would ensure that the mil@@ i@@ ti@@ ated auto@@ cr@@ acy he@@ ed@@ k@@ ra@@ e he@@ d@@ ged .
aware that workers and their unions have a role to play in creating a new japan , they used a language that explicitly fav@@ ors the “ new japan ” .
when the united states occupied germany after world war ii , general d@@ wi@@ ght ur@@ ged david e@@ is@@ en@@ ho@@ wer and his staff to write a constitution that would ensure that fas@@ c@@ ism was ad@@ ol@@ f hit@@ ler ’ s strong democracy .
recogn@@ izing the fact that workers need to organize themselves , and raise their vo@@ ices in the new nation , the german@@ s added a clause that explicitly states that : &quot; the right to un@@ ite .
agreements that restrict or aim to restrict this right are zero .
when the former first lady ele@@ an@@ or roo@@ se@@ vel@@ t presid@@ ed over the international commission on human rights , which issued the universal declaration of human rights , as it was adopted by the united nations in 194@@ 8 as a global agreement .
for generations , americans have accepted the basic pre@@ mise that labor rights are human rights .
when that country told other countries how to shape civil and democratic societies , americans declared that the right to establish a trade union - and to do so , that union would then be handed over to collective negotiations as an equal partner .
after these rights were under attack in america , it is indeed wise to re@@ consider the american ideal , which is that the working population has the right to choose and to live .
as pa@@ st@@ or martin lu@@ ther king j@@ r. said 50 years ago :
history is a great teacher .
now everyone knows that the labor movement did not limit the strength of the nation , but increased it .
raising the standard of living of millions of people mir@@ ac@@ ul@@ ously created a market for industry and in@@ adver@@ t@@ ently shi@@ fted the entire nation to un@@ imag@@ in@@ able levels of production .
those who attack the work forget these simple tru@@ ths , but history preser@@ ves them .
history re@@ members , and we should do so .
formal recognition of labour rights as human rights - and the extension of the protection of civil rights as a protection against discrimination in the creation of employee representatives - is long over@@ due .
ke@@ ith el@@ lis@@ on and john le@@ w@@ is re@@ new the ide@@ als that have made america big in the past and delivered on the promise of democracy .
judge tempor@@ arily stops the law that all abor@@ tion clin@@ ics in lou@@ i@@ si@@ ana could force to close down .
a us federal judge stopped the implementation of a law in lou@@ i@@ si@@ ana on sunday , from which lawyers say that it would probably lead to the closure of all five abor@@ tion clin@@ ics in the state .
this measure , which was supported by bo@@ b@@ by j@@ in@@ dal , govern@@ or of lou@@ i@@ si@@ ana , was adopted by the law in june and is due to enter into force on 1 september , would allow doctors who carry out abor@@ tions to be banned .
the judge &apos;s decision , however , means that for the time being doctors can continue to carry out legal abor@@ tions while requ@@ est@@ ing such a right .
&quot; the pla@@ in@@ ti@@ ffs can continue to work in accordance with the law , while they are stri@@ ving to obtain these rights , &quot; federal judge john de@@ gra@@ vel@@ les wrote in his judgment .
within a month , a hearing will be arranged for the judge to ensure that the law is made more permanent .
ad@@ voca@@ tes of abor@@ tion welcomed the decision to reject the latest in a series of jud@@ gments against similar measures , saying that doctors would have needed more time to obtain hospital permission .
&quot; today &apos;s decision means that women in lou@@ i@@ si@@ ana are es@@ cap@@ ing a dis@@ gu@@ sting law that wants to take their health and their rights , &quot; said n@@ ancy nor@@ th@@ up , president and chair of the centre for re@@ productive rights ,
it was not immediately clear whether the judgment would also apply to doctors from the two clin@@ ics who had been unable to join the compla@@ int and also have applications for authorisation .
lou@@ i@@ si@@ ana is one of 11 states that have adopted similar laws , with courts recently taking such measures in al@@ ab@@ ama and missi@@ ssi@@ pp@@ i for non-@@ constitutional purposes .
key points of a law in tex@@ as that covers most of the remaining clin@@ ics to close were covered by a federal judge on friday .
ad@@ voca@@ tes of abor@@ tion and the american college of o@@ stre@@ tr@@ ici@@ ans and gy@@ nec@@ o@@ logi@@ sts , as well as the american medical association , agree that author@@ ising rights of doctors are unnecessary .
oppon@@ ents of abor@@ tion are opposed to the measures being used to protect women &apos;s health , although some also consider the effects of closing down clin@@ ics .
only a doctor who has been carrying out abor@@ tions in lou@@ i@@ si@@ ana has the right to introduce patients , shared the centre for re@@ productive rights .
if all other doctors in the state are forced to stop carrying out abor@@ tions , this doctor would , for fear of his safety , no longer carry out the operation , the group said .
in its arguments against the judgment , representatives of the state of lou@@ i@@ si@@ ana said that they had not arrested doctors for carrying out abor@@ tions , while their applications for patient applications were not yet accepted .
dela@@ yed diagno@@ sis and lack of access to the best treatment methods lead to higher death rates from eg@@ g can@@ c@@ ers in rural areas .
angel@@ ina jo@@ lie and her brother james have a video hom@@ age for their mother online , which was sold to eg@@ g stock@@ pil@@ es in 2007 .
for women in australia ’ s rural areas , there is a greater risk of dying of eg@@ g can@@ c@@ ers than for women in cities .
researchers analy@@ zed the medical data of more than 1@@ 100 austr@@ ali@@ ans who had detec@@ ted eg@@ g stock@@ pil@@ es in 2005 , and found that only 25 % had been diagno@@ sed five years ago .
the research director sus@@ an j@@ ord@@ an of the q@@ im@@ r ber@@ g@@ ho@@ fer medical research institute said that for those who live in rural and remote regions of the state , the mort@@ ality risk during the study was 20 % higher .
small study : new medicines could be l@@ ung and eg@@ g thro@@ at cancer , and could slow down l@@ ung and eg@@ g stock@@ pil@@ es .
researchers investig@@ ated women &apos;s medical care for seven years .
dr j@@ ord@@ an said that the age of a woman in diagno@@ sis , the type of eg@@ g thro@@ at cancer , previous diseases and social and economic status also increase the chan@@ ces of survival .
for older women and those whose cancer has continued to be advanced at the time of diagno@@ sis , the survival rate was lowest .
for those who live in rural and remote areas of the state , mort@@ ality risk was higher during the study by 20 % than for those in urban areas .
although the study did not investigate why women living outside the city are more likely to suffer from eg@@ g can@@ c@@ ers , dr. j@@ ord@@ an susp@@ ects a late diagno@@ sis and lack of access to the best treatment centers .
&quot; this disease is best treated by gy@@ na@@ ecological on@@ co@@ log@@ ists , and these are mostly found in larger cities , &quot; she said .
despite the improvement in tele@@ medical services to counter di@@ stances , it proposed as a possible re@@ me@@ dy to strengthen the service of inter@@ cep@@ ted doctors to provide specialists with the opportunity to di@@ et women more closely in their homes .
dr j@@ ord@@ an said that the study , regardless of geographical status , had a poor long-term survival rate for women in eg@@ g can@@ c@@ ers , and under@@ lined the need for better treatment and prevention strategies .
the results of rio t@@ into ride to con@@ qu@@ er cancer are now published in the medical journal of australia .
in march 2013 , el@@ ish@@ a ne@@ a@@ ve , a young mother of 33 years from the gold coast , learned that she had developed an aggres@@ sive form of e@@ gg@@ -@@ stock@@ p@@ ile cancer .
garden centres regret dec@@ lining house ownership
the decline , together with an increase in the number of home@@ owners under 35 , could lead to garden centres losing tens of thousands of p@@ ounds a year when today ’ s young consumers , as in the financial sector , are reported to have done .
the report states that ten@@ ants spend an average of 55 percent of the amount that people have to spend on their gardens with their own homes .
the rise in people living in highly ur@@ ban@@ ised areas without gardens , the popular procedure of par@@ k-@@ using sub@@ ter@@ ran@@ ean gardens , and the dec@@ lining garden size are further factors that make the industry vulnerable .
in the greater london area , where over a period of 6 years the share of home@@ owners has fallen from 61 % to 43 % , the lowest expenditure on garden products per household is reported .
the h@@ ta and the royal hor@@ tic@@ ul@@ tural society point out that housing is not available for rent or small gardens means that people do not have to draw plants .
gu@@ y bar@@ ter , chief garden advis@@ er for the r@@ as said : &quot; contain@@ er gar@@ den@@ ers are very popular among ten@@ ants , for example , because they can take their plants with them when they move . &quot;
the h@@ ta report identified the period between 1997 and 2005 as the &quot; golden age &quot; of the retail garden market due to rising home@@ owners and economic prosperity from the late 198@@ 0s to the mid-@@ 199@@ 0s .
he also predic@@ ted improved market conditions for this year , due to the better weather conditions following un@@ friendly weather conditions in march and april last year .
the political and economic reforms initiated by opposition politici@@ an im@@ ran kh@@ an and the spiritual ta@@ h@@ ir@@ u@@ l q@@ ad@@ ri in pakistan are continuing .
around 1000 demonstr@@ ators have taken over the state television channel p@@ tv in the capital islam@@ ab@@ ad .
information minister per@@ v@@ ai@@ z r@@ as@@ hi@@ d said that soldiers had taken the prote@@ sters back out of p@@ tv .
the station set up its operation for about 40 minutes , but is now sending back .
at the same time , around 3@@ 000 demonstr@@ ators tried to become prime minister na@@ wa@@ z shar@@ if ’ s residence .
about a kil@@ ome@@ tre away , they were equipped with stic@@ ks and stones to cl@@ ash with security forces .
the police used te@@ ar gas .
the prote@@ sters demanded shar@@ if ’ s re@@ sign@@ ation , but he refused .
the country &apos;s army is meanwhile ur@@ ging a political solution to the conflict , &apos; without wa@@ sting time and using force &apos; .
after a meeting in the headquarters on sunday evening , the military said : &apos; the army remains committed to its role in ensuring the security of the state &apos; .

turkey orders us diplom@@ at for sp@@ ying report
the turkish foreign ministry has sent a message to the country ’ s lon@@ ge@@ st-@@ serving us diplom@@ at about a report on american and british es@@ pi@@ on@@ age in turkey .
vice-president b@@ ü@@ l@@ ent said that the us emb@@ ass@@ y and turkish official ’ s executive discussed the report on monday .
the german magazine der spi@@ e@@ gel and the online magazine the inter@@ cep@@ t reported that the data collected by the former us analy@@ st of the national security agency , ed@@ ward snow@@ den , show that turkey is a major activity for the us .
according to turkish news agencies , turkish president rec@@ ep ta@@ y@@ y@@ ip er@@ do@@ gan played the role of her@@ do@@ gan in the report and said that all the major countries should play mu@@ tually .
an earlier report that germany ’ s main intelligence service also targeted an@@ kar@@ a made it clear that it was re@@ acting more shar@@ p@@ ly .

the main thr@@ ust of the warning strike is freight transport .

mag@@ alu@@ f police chief accused of corruption
on friday , the prosecu@@ tors submitted a report to the office of the mall@@ orca public prosecu@@ tor to prove that police and officials were black@@ mail .
the head of the cal@@ vi@@ à police on the mall@@ orca holiday island was arrested for corruption by business@@ men and bar@@ ke@@ te@@ ers in the in@@ famous b@@ ing@@ e-@@ drin@@ king@@ -@@ hot@@ spot mag@@ alu@@ f .
chief commissioner jo@@ s@@ é ant@@ oni@@ o na@@ var@@ ro was arrested after acc@@ us@@ ations of corruption against him by several business@@ men from pun@@ ta b@@ all@@ ena , the street where most of mag@@ alu@@ f &apos;s bars and night@@ clubs are located .
according to the online daily mall@@ orca di@@ ario , the prosecu@@ tors submitted a report to the prosecu@@ tor &apos;s office for the fight against corruption in mall@@ orca on friday to prove police black@@ mail and city officials .
two other local police officers were arrested by the spanish guar@@ dia civil in connection with the corruption charges .
the spanish national daily ab@@ c reported that the an@@ gr@@ y night@@ club owners were saying that the ve@@ t@@ ter@@ n@@ ity of the authorities had serious implications for their business .
&quot; it is no longer a matter of mon@@ e@@ y-@@ making , it is a matter of survival , &quot; said one of the business@@ men to the court .
let our live@@ li@@ hood be lost .
we have nothing to lose .
this summer , mag@@ alu@@ f made a huge effort to make international head@@ lines , owing to a vir@@ al you@@ tube video , in which an 18@@ -@@ year-@@ old british tourist was shown who died on 24 men during a flo@@ od f@@ ell@@ ati@@ o .
the island authorities have since tried to stop the impro@@ per behaviour of alcoho@@ lic holi@@ day@@ makers in mag@@ alu@@ f by reducing the number of participants in the not@@ ori@@ ous alcoho@@ lic be@@ ver@@ ages .
the play@@ house club , where the f@@ ell@@ ati@@ o incident took place , was forced to close for one year , while play@@ house and the k@@ nei@@ pen@@ tour@@ -@@ organiz@@ er car@@ n@@ age jointly accepted a penalty of 5@@ 5@@ ,000 € .
mag@@ alu@@ f is a tourist resort that is popular with young british holi@@ day@@ makers and is also known for numerous accidents involving alcohol , including those involving tr@@ app@@ ing .
the first spring day with we@@ t and stor@@ my weather conditions affects flights from ade@@ la@@ ide airport .
the spring has left southern australia a winter surprise , with fi@@ er@@ ce sho@@ wers and strong win@@ ds that have been flying from ade@@ la@@ ide airport .
in the evening until 9 pm , another 5@@ mm of rain fell on the city , after 6.@@ 6@@ mm , which had already fallen to sunday at night .
the last ra@@ inf@@ all was the result of a series of short , stor@@ my sho@@ wers , including a cast that began just before 8 p.m. and was ready for almost 4@@ mm ra@@ inf@@ all in about 10 minutes .
after the winter was ready for early spring last week , the average temperature fell by about 10 degrees cel@@ si@@ us on monday .
the bad weather has probably caused the dela@@ yed lan@@ ding of a flight from vir@@ gin airlines from mel@@ bour@@ ne to ade@@ la@@ ide .
the plane would have lan@@ ded shortly after 7.@@ 30 p.m. , but was hit by a wind of out@@ bur@@ sts - a su@@ dden change in wind speed or direction over a short distance - and had to start .
at that time , wind b@@ lows reached about 50 km / h on the ground at ade@@ la@@ ide airport .
the flight data showed that the aircraft could also be started on a second flight and eventually extended to around 20@@ .@@ 40 .
the flight delay subsequently resulted in some other flights being dela@@ yed , including an em@@ i@@ rates flight from du@@ ba@@ i and a qu@@ ant@@ as flight from sy@@ d@@ ney .
for ade@@ la@@ ide , a maximum temperature of 16 ° c is predic@@ ted on tuesday , with possible sho@@ wers .
mat@@ th@@ ies says : it is high time to become a great net@@ working point for the future .
given the gal@@ lo@@ ping technical progress that has been made in high-@@ tech areas by our co@@ zy home , the company is now in a state of comfort .
as i write this here , my view of the spir@@ al cable that connec@@ ts the list@@ en@@ er to the phone , and i think : bo@@ ah , how re@@ tr@@ o is that ?
but there is a thought behind this : if the cable was not , all list@@ en@@ ers would be able to fly around in the house in the shor@@ test possible time , and that would be much more re@@ tr@@ o .
in any case , the ec@@ hel@@ tr@@ onic ( ec@@ kel@@ tr@@ onic ?
no , ty@@ po@@ s : electronic ) sector the rule that today &apos;s world nov@@ el@@ ty is the electro@@ sc@@ ra@@ p of tomorrow , bought - out@@ dated .
and if you still have a tube tv in the living room today , for example , you simply say that you are opposed to television in principle .
why these considerations ?
because the i@@ fa &apos;s ou@@ ting at the radio tower this week again gives us our absolute in@@ competence in electronics matters .
the la@@ ie , who used to be a washing machine and cd player blin@@ dly dominated , does not even understand the purpose of the devices that were used with un@@ believ@@ ably l@@ oud and un@@ believ@@ able experts in front of him : &quot; connect home &quot; .
yes , is it still possible ?
what are we to talk about with people who seem to be volun@@ tar@@ ily spre@@ ading such quar@@ k ?
in fact , for some 20 years now , the main issue has been the fact that we should be net@@ working our house with the utmost satisfaction .
to help the yo@@ gh@@ ur@@ t to get the fire detec@@ tor to us during the holiday in the mal@@ di@@ ves , we have to tell that it is burning in the working room .
and would it not be wonderful if we were to have air conditioning from the office on our early arrival ... ?
yes , however , it requires air conditioning .
but a dream will certainly come true soon : we lift our watch , say you &apos;re &quot; suc@@ king ! &quot; - and at home , the vacu@@ um gro@@ wer drives away .
wrong .
everything amounts to nothing less than a revolution : &apos; the borders between white and brown goods bl@@ ur@@ red &apos; , ra@@ un@@ t an industry expert , you can see the washing machine with a head@@ phone .
we also know from everyday practice that if a new and modern device is really needed urgently , the battery is guaranteed to be empty .
another reason is that the spir@@ al cable on the phone also survi@@ ves the next radio exhibitions .
israeli children are returning to their schools after the war in gaza .
thousands of israeli children from the territories near gaza , who returned to israel on monday , were killed by the israeli army in air traffic control rooms .
the start of school brought the war , marked by ro@@ cket in@@ fu@@ sions in southern israel , a sense of joy and expec@@ tation , but the signs of fighting are still fresh .
in the southern city of ash@@ do@@ d , the assi@@ stant of the &quot; pas@@ ho@@ sh &quot; nur@@ ser@@ y , who was hit by a ro@@ cket , before the pu@@ p@@ il arrived at sh@@ at@@ spl@@ it@@ ters of gran@@ ate from the walls and adm@@ ire .
&quot; we are a little afraid , but are ex@@ ci@@ ted , &quot; said ron@@ it b@@ art , resid@@ ent in ki@@ b@@ but@@ z sa@@ ad and english teacher there .
many children from our area urgently need a return to rout@@ ine .
her 1@@ 1-@@ year-@@ old daughter sh@@ ani b@@ art said it feels &quot; a bit fun@@ ny &quot; , suddenly back in the school .
&quot; these were difficult times , and we did not leave the house at all , &quot; she said .
president re@@ u@@ ven ri@@ v@@ lin visited ki@@ b@@ but@@ z near the gaza border to offer his support .
until a ce@@ as@@ e@@ fire bro@@ ke out last week , thousands of inhabitants of border communities like sa@@ ad stayed in their homes or left their homes to live in sa@@ fer areas further away from gaza and join the missi@@ le .
many na@@ h@@ al o@@ z residents , a municip@@ ality near the gaza border , who have a four-@@ year-@@ old boy killed by a palestinian bom@@ b , have been forced to hesitate to contact the government .
the ministry of education announced that about a do@@ zen families have not yet returned .
their children have been placed in other schools for the time being .
prime minister bin@@ y@@ am@@ in net@@ any@@ ah@@ u visited a school in s@@ der@@ ot , a border town with gaza that is badly hit by the palestinian fire .
he called on the children to learn a lot and said &quot; we will ensure that their knowledge is acquired and provide you with security &quot; .
israel and hamas agreed on an open-@@ ended peace agreement last tuesday .
the ce@@ as@@ e@@ fire brought about an immediate end to fighting ; however , important problems remain un@@ resolved , as hamas ’ s demand for the lif@@ ting of the isra@@ eli@@ -@@ egyp@@ tian bloc@@ k@@ ade of gaza and the re@@ opening of air and sea ports .
israel is calling for hamas to be dis@@ armed and for the bodies to be handed over from two israeli soldiers killed in the fighting .
a new round of indirect talks is expected to begin in egypt this month .
in the war , more than 2,@@ 100 palestinians were killed , three quarters of them civili@@ ans , and at least 4@@ 94 children were estimated to have been killed by palestinians and the un .
israel den@@ ies these claims and estimates that at least half of the killed are figh@@ ters , but never submitted any concrete evidence of these information .
on the israeli side , 66 soldiers and six civili@@ ans , including a th@@ ai work@@ er , have been killed .
hamas and other gaza figh@@ ters fi@@ red 4@@ ,@@ 5@@ 91 ro@@ c@@ kets and mor@@ tar sh@@ ell@@ s during the fighting on israeli cities , most of which were in the south of the country .
meanwhile , israel ’ s military has carried more than 5@@ ,000 air and other attacks .
israel ’ s attacks damaged or destroyed thousands of gaza ’ s homes , and about 2@@ 50@@ ,000 people sought refu@@ ge in more than 100 un schools that had been built in temporary shel@@ ters .
while tens of thousands of people continue to live in the shel@@ ter and continue the fighting , last week the educational authorities postpon@@ ed the start of the school year .
&quot; i hope the school is soon re@@ opened so that we can continue learning , as the children in the world and the jewish children , &quot; said mo@@ ham@@ ma@@ d am@@ ara , a 13@@ -@@ year-@@ old boy who is currently in gam@@ ara school .
at sa@@ x@@ ony &apos;s option , n@@ p@@ d-@@ ver@@ b@@ ally provides n@@ p@@ d prohibi@@ tion procedures .
given the loss of votes by the n@@ p@@ d in sa@@ x@@ ony , c@@ du bun@@ des@@ vi@@ ze thomas stro@@ b@@ l has argu@@ ed for an end to the ongoing n@@ p@@ d prohibi@@ tion proceedings before the federal constitutional court .
berlin - according to c@@ du bun@@ des@@ vi@@ ze thomas stro@@ b@@ l , the current prohibi@@ tion proceedings against the n@@ p@@ d should end in the federal constitutional court .
&quot; the n@@ p@@ d is doing worse than last time , &quot; said stro@@ b@@ l , who also served as the c@@ du country leader in bad@@ en-@@ w@@ ür@@ t@@ tem@@ berg , the &quot; le@@ ip@@ zi@@ g people &apos;s newspaper .
this is a welcome development in the right direction and a development that will allow me to conclude more that the n@@ p@@ d is being fought politically and not in the constitutional court .
the n@@ p@@ d was very close to the fi@@ ve-@@ percent hur@@ dle in the vote on sunday .
a first attempt to ban the extreme right party was a failure in 2003 , because constitutional protection was also a priority at the n@@ p@@ d ’ s top .
in december 2013 , the federal council submitted a new application in kar@@ ls@@ ru@@ he after long preparation .
the federal government and the bun@@ de@@ sta@@ g did not join .
har@@ burg : t@@ ents for new refugees
refugees are now being placed in t@@ ents in the new area .
the initial central reception for refugees in har@@ burg is bur@@ sting .
now the internal authority has three red cross t@@ ents in addition .
the district politicians were informed only shortly before - they are not very enthusi@@ astic .
&quot; these ha@@ ur@@ uck actions continue to raise citizens &apos; reservations and do not give district politicians the opportunity to participate construc@@ tively in the human@@ e accommo@@ dations of refugees , &quot; says brit@@ ta her@@ r@@ mann , the group leader of the greens , for example .
your party demands that the district administration of har@@ burg should now provide un@@ used accommodation facilities .
96 refugees can be accommo@@ dated in the three t@@ ents .
the reasons for the over@@ crow@@ ding in the first shot are the rus@@ h of people seeking help - and the fact that the authorities have not provided sufficient places in follow-up facilities .
many refugees therefore remain longer than the regular three months .
house prices have increased by seven years , showing a widely observed increase in the winter .
the r@@ p data co@@ re@@ lo@@ gic he@@ don@@ ic home value index for home in australia ’ s capital increased by 1.@@ 1 percent in august , so r@@ p data from monday .
this increase represents the overall increase in june , july and august at 4.@@ 2 percent , the biggest increase in the winter months since 2007 .
the annual price rise was 10.@@ 9 percent , more than twice the rise in the 12 months up to august 2013 , but the increases were not the same as the country .
the research director of r@@ p data , ti@@ m law@@ less , announced that sy@@ d@@ ney and mel@@ bour@@ ne had a two-@@ ti@@ er market .
r@@ p data shows that house prices in sy@@ d@@ ney last year were down by 16@@ .@@ 1 % , with mel@@ bour@@ ne rising by 1@@ 1.@@ 7 % .
the following markets are ade@@ la@@ ide , br@@ is@@ ban@@ e and dar@@ win , where prices are reduced by an average of five and six percent .
at the other end of the scale is can@@ ber@@ ra , which has been hit hard by cuts in government spending , and where prices have ris@@ en by just 1.@@ 4 % over the year .
mr law@@ less also said that the beginning of spring is now expected to increase in the number of properties on sale over the coming months , which would &apos; put the market under a real test &apos; .
&quot; if we consider the continuing high price of the au@@ ction , a generally fast sales rate and the continuing low prices , we are not sure that the prices will be the same .
in an opinion to the new press , it contradic@@ ts statements by the executive director pe@@ er med@@ au and acknowled@@ ges him that &quot; like a fel@@ d@@ her@@ r &quot; to position .
the university style is not that , it says in the communication .
the med@@ al family had already been informed or@@ ally about the request from the university in mid-@@ june .
the statement that the plans were only announced in july is definitely wrong , &quot; says p@@ ö@@ tz@@ l .
at the same time , it points out that the plans are not &apos; pre@@ determined or even decisions &apos; , but &apos; preferences &apos; .
the expansion of the narrow road to the castle which is necessary for the access to the castle is also less dramatic than the med@@ a fears .
from a nine metr@@ e long road , there was no mention of it .
as things stand at present , it is 5.@@ 50 metres wider than before , &apos; explains p@@ ö@@ tz@@ l .
the argument of the me@@ d@@ aul operators that their free and educational parking areas will only be used in future by students of the university wants p@@ ö@@ tz@@ l not to apply .
the hotel is not allowed at all because , like other public parking areas , it is now possible to solve this intellig@@ ently .
the people living near the border are thinking in terms of the people living in the countryside .
the children ’ s cri@@ b ber@@ g@@ w@@ ich@@ tel , located on the site , is open on the do@@ or@@ step of the park dec@@ k , according to the president of the higher education , &apos; should not be affected &apos; .
rather , he gives to consider &quot; that this is not just a children &apos;s na@@ tivity , but also a local population at the entrance to the fried@@ rich@@ -@@ stre@@ ib@@ -@@ stra@@ ß@@ e and the 800 students of the neighbouring real@@ sch@@ u@@ le .
so it is much more than just a question of individual interests of mr med@@ au , &quot; says p@@ ö@@ tz@@ l .
whether the parents ’ criticism of the children ’ s cri@@ b , with the extension of the road , would be a “ one of the few natural spots in co@@ burg ’ s lost ” is justified , “ the reader can decide for himself ” .
in early october , p@@ ö@@ tz@@ l , together with the state building authority b@@ am@@ berg , intends to inform the city counc@@ ils about the construction development of the university by 2020 &quot; and in this context address the importance of the new development &quot; .
pe@@ er med@@ au last week had the parents of the cr@@ è@@ che informed about the university &apos;s plans .
the new parking dec@@ k is not to be access@@ ed via the camp@@ us and the fried@@ rich@@ -@@ stre@@ i@@ b-@@ stra@@ ß@@ e , but via the me@@ d@@ aul .
this would mean that the narrow road would have to be extended on a two-@@ lan@@ e stre@@ tch of about one kil@@ ome@@ tre .
according to med@@ a &apos;s accounts , traffic in the park of ho@@ hen@@ f@@ els castle would increase ten@@ -@@ fold .
about 2000 vehicles are mentioned daily .
the city has not yet wanted to comment on the project .
gl@@ and@@ or@@ f ste@@ ers from hand@@ ball national team .
hol@@ ger gl@@ and@@ or@@ f will no longer play for the dh@@ b team .
the 3@@ 1-@@ year-@@ old from the bun@@ des@@ lig@@ ist s@@ g fl@@ ens@@ bur@@ g-@@ han@@ de@@ wit@@ t was responsible for this decision , mainly for health problems .
i did not find it easy to make a decision , it has mat@@ ured for several months .
it is time for me to listen to the signals of my body and to start my career in the national team , &quot; said the 2007 world champi@@ on at his fac@@ e@@ book page .
it therefore has a record of 16@@ 7 country games and 5@@ 76 goals for germany in international reti@@ rement .
because the ro@@ ck@@ -@@ and-@@ roll back@@ room player for the champi@@ ons league winner from fl@@ ens@@ burg will be on a to@@ re@@ j@@ ag@@ d for a few years to come , he is now on the new d@@ agu@@ r sign@@ age .
with the ic@@ el@@ and@@ ers who will be on tuesday his k@@ ad@@ er for the country games against switzerland , gl@@ and@@ or@@ f introduced a &quot; long and good con@@ vers@@ ation .
his ideas and approaches have en@@ thr@@ alled me just as much as they have en@@ thr@@ alled my long-@@ time fellow players and my success@@ ors .
but for my club i want to be healthy for the next years , and for that reason longer reg@@ ener@@ ation periods are necessary , which do not allow the current double load .
in 2012 , the left handed had to leave after a he@@ el inf@@ ection with his career .
due to ach@@ ill@@ es sp@@ ell problems , he had been hi@@ red by team doctors of the german hand@@ ball federation ( dh@@ b ) with a cor@@ tis@@ one injec@@ tion , which later elimin@@ ated a strong infl@@ am@@ mation .
an emergency operation and two other interven@@ tions followed .
then gl@@ and@@ or@@ f had announced a compla@@ int against the team doctor , the dispute ended with a comparison .
twelve years of professional and ele@@ ven years of national team career pass by no body without tr@@ ace .
i have some health building sites that i can no longer ignore .
after the three inf@@ ec@@ tion-@@ related foot operations , which took place in 2012 at short inter@@ vals , i never really got my blood pressure under control .
this includes some other wear and te@@ ar related complaints .
i noticed at the beginning of the year that i am ste@@ ering my head , but i can &apos;t dec@@ ei@@ ve my body , &quot; , g@@ land@@ or@@ f explained in the interview the magazine &quot; hand@@ ball time &quot; .
for a com@@ e@@ back , it would only be available in absolute emergency .
&quot; when all the ri@@ gs are te@@ aring , i am always ready to talk , &quot; explained the double father to the magazine .
however , i can &apos;t wait for years when i can still play hand@@ ball in one hand .
i must also say that after my long stay in hospital in 2012 , i also became quite hum@@ ili@@ ating in terms of my health .
after my career i want to at least go some way straight .
in addition to the 2007 world championship title and the winning of the champi@@ ons league 20@@ 14 , he won the 2008 ( h@@ s@@ g n@@ ord@@ hor@@ n ) and 2010 ( t@@ b@@ v le@@ m@@ go ) e@@ h@@ f cup .
in 2012 he also secured the european cup of the cup winner with fl@@ ens@@ burg .
german economy contrac@@ ted by 0.@@ 2 % in spring .
the crises around the world have hit the german economy in the second quarter .
gross domestic product fell from april to the end of june 20@@ 14 , compared to the prior quarter , by 0.@@ 2 % .
this was shared by the federal statistical office and confirmed preliminary calcu@@ lations .
consumption alone sti@@ mu@@ lated the economy in the spring , while investment dec@@ lined .
foreign trade also slow@@ ed the economy .
thanks to the strong beginning of the year , a total gdp increase of 0.@@ 8 % over the second half of 2013 will be achieved for the first six months .
hor@@ st@@ mar was the starting point and destination of the &quot; m@@ ün@@ ster@@ land mo@@ o@@ i@@ ste &quot; , which was first introduced on sunday through the city of bur@@ g@@ man@@ n@@ s@@ dorf .
the bur@@ g@@ man@@ n@@ stadt hor@@ st@@ mar experienced an inv@@ asion of dutch &quot; fi@@ et@@ z@@ en@@ fa@@ hr@@ ter &quot; on sunday .
the largest cycling association in the netherlands , n@@ t@@ f@@ u , organized the so-called &quot; m@@ ün@@ ster@@ lan@@ de mo@@ o@@ i@@ ste &quot; .
this is the largest cycling tour across the m@@ ün@@ ster@@ land , the cycling paradise near the netherlands .
over 1000 participants than@@ ked jo@@ s ter hu@@ er@@ ne for organiz@@ ing this tour through the m@@ ün@@ ster@@ land .
this tour was published in various trade magaz@@ ines and was offered to interested people .
we are coming from the her@@ oes and we went over@@ night to participate in this tour .
we would like to know the m@@ ün@@ ster@@ land in this way too , &quot; , cy@@ cli@@ sts were delighted to take the route through the districts of ste@@ in@@ furt , bor@@ ken and co@@ es@@ fel@@ d .
after regi@@ stering at the club of the protec@@ tive bro@@ ther@@ hood sta .
k@@ ath@@ ar@@ ina went on a small &quot; peace ride &quot; through the city over the wall , where the start was also made .
the route , which has been adver@@ ti@@ sed for three different categories , led towards her@@ ren@@ hol@@ z over the sch@@ ö@@ pp@@ inger berg in the direction of co@@ es@@ fel@@ d and across ha@@ vi@@ x@@ bec@@ k and b@@ ill@@ er@@ bec@@ k back to hor@@ st@@ mar .
on routes of 95 kilometres with 1@@ 17@@ 5 metres of al@@ titude , 120 kilometres of 14@@ 75 metres of al@@ titude and 14@@ 5 kilometres of 17@@ 75 metres of al@@ titude , cy@@ cli@@ sts have proved their good condition .
they were ca@@ red for on the way in ha@@ vi@@ x@@ bec@@ k and b@@ ill@@ er@@ bec@@ k .
main organiz@@ er jo@@ s ter hu@@ er@@ ne and may@@ or depu@@ ty he@@ in@@ z l@@ ö@@ l@@ fing showed themselves at the success of this cycling event .
we are satisfied and it was a great experience for all involved .
the organization was without problems and there were no negative inci@@ dents , &quot; he@@ in@@ z l@@ ö@@ l@@ fing dra@@ ws a positive conclusion to this event .
unfortunately , not as many participants as the organiz@@ er had hoped , which is probably due to the bad weather forec@@ asts and the morning rain .
&quot; we will be back in 20@@ 15 in hopefully nice weather on august 30 or during another weekend , &quot; the cy@@ cli@@ sts promised to return to m@@ ün@@ ster@@ land and the organiz@@ ers plan to re@@ new their tour .
kon@@ stan@@ tin w@@ ec@@ kers ru@@ th@@ lessly w@@ ills honest mem@@ o@@ irs
it is actually more philosoph@@ ical testi@@ mony than bio@@ graphy , which makes kon@@ stan@@ tin alarm , song@@ writer , paci@@ f@@ ist , poli@@ ti@@ co-@@ safe acti@@ vis@@ t , ex@@ -@@ prison@@ er , in &quot; mon@@ k and war@@ ri@@ or 8@@ 7 .
it is not chron@@ ological but rather more spiritual sc@@ ra@@ ps for thought sc@@ ra@@ ps that the author , born on 1 june 194@@ 7 , has defe@@ ated his mem@@ o@@ irs , each chapter initiated by a suitable song text .
and he is ru@@ th@@ lessly honest : from the on@@ ani@@ e as a gy@@ m@@ na@@ si@@ st to the sho@@ p@@ lif@@ ting and drug use he does not leave any human weak@@ ness .
also , to show how he himself toler@@ ates in dealing with his fellow human beings .
the broad spectrum of ab@@ str@@ act terms , but all the more important , is that love , soul , e@@ go , being in the now spirit@@ u@@ ality - all of which he tries to get to the bottom , in a very personal , but also philosoph@@ ical way .
and he also explains his paci@@ f@@ ism , his social criticism , his political commitment - and also how he has not only shaped music ( the opera lo@@ ver was named sou@@ l@@ - and rock musici@@ an ) , but also his political commitment .
the latter has named the le@@ be@@ mann kon@@ stan@@ tin w@@ ec@@ ker as close to the as@@ ce@@ tic mon@@ k , who &quot; emer@@ ges through sub@@ tr@@ action &quot; as he says , &quot; leaving everything unnecessary &quot; .
there is also a short an@@ ec@@ d@@ ote between all the highly spiritual views on earth : about be@@ at@@ ings in a region frequ@@ ented by g@@ is or a ma@@ d co@@ p ride , where the person is fron@@ t@@ line .
he is also ru@@ th@@ less in his hon@@ est@@ y .
len@@ ny hen@@ ry : my father never put me in the arm .
never said &quot; i love you !
hen@@ ry was one of seven children of a family of jam@@ a@@ ic@@ an immigrants in du@@ d@@ ley in the mid@@ lands in 195@@ 8 .
his father , who died when hen@@ ry 19 was working in a factory and her relationship was limited .
hen@@ ry pro@@ ves for a com@@ edy , ru@@ dy &apos;s rare records , which are partly based on an imag@@ inary con@@ vers@@ ation with his father and is released on radio 4 .
the sound@@ track is a mix@@ ture of reg@@ ga@@ e and ra@@ p , with lively me@@ lo@@ dies .
but hen@@ ry had to work through some difficult child@@ hood moments .
he attended &quot; many &quot; therap@@ ies after the death of his mother , and hen@@ ry is thinking about his relationship with his father .
it was difficult to know him .
you never saw his face , only heard his voice : &quot; listen to the cr@@ ash .
let your si@@ ster be in peace .
get away !
i want to look at cr@@ ick@@ et .
my older bro@@ thers se@@ y@@ m@@ our and hil@@ ton - who were already grown when i was a child - went with him to the pu@@ b and talked about things like the shape of beer glass or the beauty of a cr@@ ick@@ et .
i never had such a con@@ vers@@ ation with him .
for a large part of my life he was this serious gu@@ y in the corner of the newspaper .
recently hen@@ ry opened a foun@@ dry in du@@ d@@ ley , and although conditions are better than those of his father , he won an insight into how the life for him was .
it is now a bit bri@@ ghter , but they are dark , smo@@ ky , deep sty@@ lis@@ tic lab@@ y@@ r@@ in@@ th with fl@@ ame sho@@ cks and smo@@ ke and lots of so@@ ot .
my father used to sit in the tu@@ b and then one could hear him slowly , how he began to sing , because he was the foun@@ dry of himself .
when i went around there , i realized that he had done so for years to prepare the meal on the table , and i respect him .
however , hen@@ ry grew up as a child without the testi@@ mony of his parents &apos; love .
my father never hu@@ gged me , he never said &quot; i love you &quot; .
only when my mother was ill at the end of her life did we begin to &quot; i love you , i love you , i love you &quot; to say .
through his own daughter bil@@ li@@ ge , with da@@ wn french , he could share the love he l@@ acks as a child .
could you have a look at the &quot; i love you &quot; ?
stop hu@@ gging me !
dad , i am 22 !
with da@@ wn french .
why should we not be friends ?
she is a great mother .
it is still a friend of french , with whom he married for 25 years .
da@@ wn is a good man .
why should we not be friends ?
she is a great mother .
hen@@ ry &apos;s own mother was a di@@ abe@@ tic .
this contributed to their death .
so when i got very , very over@@ weight and had symp@@ t@@ oms of di@@ abe@@ tes , my doctor said &quot; you must be radical .
so i pul@@ led through this fitness and had to make a dr@@ astic di@@ et to reverse the symp@@ t@@ oms .
it is very difficult .
and it is ex@@ hau@@ sting .
no one li@@ kes eating car@@ ro@@ ts .
hen@@ ry &apos;s career change may be reflected in his elegant , short-@@ cut be@@ ard .
since he was nom@@ inated by cri@@ tics for his o@@ th@@ ell@@ o , he has been cap@@ tured by the theatre .
the com@@ edy of the mistakes followed , and then f@@ ences of august wil@@ son .
this is a different experience than the sit@@ com@@ s and com@@ edi@@ as who have completed their busy working life .
he began with only 16 years when he worked in a factory .
a d@@ j discovered him on stage when he im@@ it@@ ated and wrote to new faces about him .
his television career began in the mid-@@ 197@@ 0s . &quot; i was the only black ic@@ ons for a fairly long time in television . &quot;
he learned at work .
i had to be large not only in the eyes of the public , but also from 197@@ 5 to 198@@ 5 learn how to become an efficient jo@@ ke nar@@ ra@@ tive machine , while i was a star through television , and that was really difficult .
len@@ ny 197@@ 5 at new faces
as his manager had the right to stage at the black and white min@@ stre@@ l show , a light entertainment program , where he was able to &quot; black &quot; .
the hotel is very clean and the staff are very friendly .
i some@@ how wish it had never happened , but i do not regret that i did .
the hotel is very clean and the staff are very friendly .
but this &quot; year long awar@@ d-@@ winning light pillar of british television &quot; was also a &quot; gro@@ te@@ s@@ que par@@ o@@ dy of black people . &quot;
the introduction of figures representing british black culture both mo@@ c@@ ked and celebrated worked for hen@@ ry in the eigh@@ ties .
the first series of the len@@ ny hen@@ ry show was broad@@ cast in 198@@ 4 , and in the 199@@ 0s he was among other things as the ch@@ ef gare@@ th black@@ lock in the com@@ edy series ch@@ ef !
advertising , docum@@ entary films , tv series and film roles have been a feature of his next decade , but after his bb@@ c series len@@ ny@@ hen@@ ry@@ .@@ tv 2008 he thought : &quot; what are you doing next , because you are doing ?
after that came a docum@@ entary series for radio 4 entitled what &apos;s so great about ... ?
the first episode was about sha@@ kes@@ pe@@ are .
i was quite aller@@ gic to sha@@ kes@@ pe@@ are .
i never really learned anything about him at school and thought him to be a domain of the middle class , white in ti@@ ghts , and a com@@ b .
so i was very afraid of it .
all of us who inter@@ viewed for the show , peter hall , tre@@ v@@ or n@@ un@@ n , adri@@ an les@@ ter , ju@@ di den@@ ch said &quot; you should try it .
do not do it bad if you don &apos;t know what you are talking about .
take a few words in your mouth , and then you will understand why we all use sha@@ kes@@ pe@@ are so love .
hen@@ ry introduced 20 lines from o@@ th@@ el@@ los last speech for the docum@@ entary and he was thr@@ illed .
i felt that i could achieve this .
it was almost as if someone had put my head on to me .
&quot; that is what it is about , it is a serious matter , take it seriously , learn your text , search a bit .
the sam@@ ples were brut@@ al , and i read this piece for months before we did it .
and it was a success .
they seemed to expect a car accident , and that simply did not happen .
and soon he appeared in the com@@ edy of the f@@ all@@ acies .
suddenly i was in the national theatre and i could hardly believe it .
there was a moment when i thought , &quot; o@@ h , you changed you . &quot;
there was a technical error and hen@@ ry felt inst@@ inc@@ tive that he had to enter@@ tain the audience .
&quot; a little voice told me &quot; you have to bridge 10 minutes now while you repair the computer . &quot;
instead , the stage leader announced that the idea would continue as soon as the problem was resolved .
i went from stage and anything in me said &quot; o@@ h , thank god , &quot; .
i am not responsible for that .
i can leave that to someone else .
&quot; you play in a play , so stay in your role . &quot;
hen@@ ry in f@@ ences at the du@@ ch@@ ess theatre
learning the text for f@@ ences was challenging .
pan@@ ic is very good , it strength@@ ens long@@ ing .
that was also a good thing , so it is like a great shi@@ eld of the go@@ ds who tell me &quot; this is your dest@@ iny &quot; .
he says so , of course , with a th@@ under@@ ing voice .
so i will stick to that .
i really love that .
i love to be in a sample room .
hen@@ ry still has the head of a com@@ edi@@ an - our con@@ vers@@ ation has been accompanied by hum@@ or@@ ous out@@ breaks , while he im@@ it@@ ates people time and again .
i have decided not to make a stand@@ -up com@@ edy because i think this type of immediate satisfaction of one room full of str@@ ang@@ ers is some@@ how dangerous .
if you always look for it , you drive to a wall .
i sometimes appear live in apo@@ llo , if i feel like it , but overall i don &apos;t have as much as i used to .
i ask him whether he will ever again be on a stand@@ -up com@@ edy tour .
the fun i had in a room with a director that helps to make a start , a middle part and the end of a journey - i do not think i ever need to give up .
is this his new inc@@ ar@@ nation ?
i think so .
i am a very f@@ ond of acting .
it is fun .
you always tell a story , and that is great .
i love stories .
people love stories .
hu@@ th@@ i re@@ be@@ ls are bloc@@ king streets in y@@ em@@ en ’ s capital city
in the conflict between shi@@ ite hu@@ th@@ i re@@ be@@ ls and the y@@ em@@ en@@ i government , hu@@ th@@ is have led to civil dis@@ o@@ be@@ di@@ ence in the capital , san@@ a@@ a .
hu@@ th@@ i sup@@ porters would have been occup@@ ying central roads in san@@ a@@ a on monday , said a speaker of the hu@@ th@@ i party , &quot; ans@@ ar allah &quot; .
access to parliament has also been bloc@@ ked .
y@@ em@@ en@@ i media report a traffic cha@@ os in the capital .
according to the online edition of the newspaper &quot; y@@ em@@ en post &quot; , hu@@ th@@ i leader ab@@ dul@@ m@@ ali@@ k al-@@ hu@@ th@@ i had called on the measures on sunday evening .
according to the magazine hu@@ th@@ i threatened to es@@ cal@@ ate the conflict further if his demands were not met .
shi@@ a hu@@ th@@ is are fighting for greater independence from sun@@ ni rul@@ ed y@@ em@@ en , and are demanding the re@@ sign@@ ation of the government .
the hu@@ th@@ i people &apos;s tri@@ be has been be@@ sie@@ ging the y@@ em@@ en@@ i capital for almost two weeks .
around 30@@ ,000 re@@ be@@ ls have protest camps on the large access routes of san@@ a@@ a .
the surrounding area is constantly strugg@@ ling with the y@@ em@@ en@@ i army .
ken@@ ya regi@@ sters officials to recru@@ it &quot; g@@ host &quot; staff .
ken@@ ya has begun to bi@@ ome@@ tr@@ ically register all state officials to become &quot; g@@ host &quot; employees from the pay@@ roll of the government .
staff who are not registered in the next two weeks would not pay any more was a government communication .
the government susp@@ ects that thousands of people will be able to remain paid sal@@ aries even after they leave the public service .
president u@@ hur@@ u ken@@ y@@ att@@ a promised , when he took office in 2013 , to fight corruption in the public service .
at a review earlier this year , it was found that at least $ 1 million ( £ 7@@ 00@@ ,000 ) per month in payments for &quot; g@@ host &quot; employees and other ab@@ u@@ sive financial practices were lost .
the government susp@@ ects that sal@@ aries will continue to be paid on accounts after a person has died or has left the public service , reports wan@@ y@@ ama che@@ bu@@ si@@ ri for the bb@@ c in na@@ i@@ rob@@ i , the capital .
all officials will now have to appear at identification centres in the next two weeks to ensure that their data on bi@@ ome@@ tric registration is included , was notified in a government message .
all those who did not do so without a credible apo@@ logy would be removed from the sal@@ ary list , continued to be the communication .
&quot; this approach will make a significant contribution to ra@@ tion@@ alising public service by identi@@ fying the actual number of officials and also by improving the sal@@ ary list at both levels of government - the g@@ host workers will be elimin@@ ated .
the scand@@ al surrounding the art advis@@ er hel@@ ge ach@@ en@@ bach will be discussed in court for the first time on 11 november .
five he@@ irs of ber@@ th@@ old al@@ bre@@ cht , son of the al@@ di founder the@@ o al@@ bre@@ cht , claim in a civil trial at the d@@ üs@@ sel@@ dorf district court 19@@ .@@ 4 million euros compensation from ach@@ en@@ die and two companies .
a court spo@@ kes@@ person said this on monday .
the compla@@ int states that ach@@ en@@ bach did not have any rights when buying works of art and v@@ int@@ age cars and that ber@@ th@@ old al@@ bre@@ cht paid higher than the actual purchase prices .
this would also mean that the commission agreed was higher .
ach@@ en@@ bach has valu@@ ed valu@@ ables for al@@ bre@@ cht for eur 12@@ 1 million .

he was in school service for 44 years , 23 of them as head of school .
man@@ f@@ red rich@@ ter knows many of the pe@@ ter@@ sha@@ us@@ en@@ er and k@@ ol@@ l@@ b@@ ach@@ er who had been in the past as pu@@ pil@@ s .
his methods were sometimes un@@ conventional , but always inspired by his desire to see the human being in the pu@@ p@@ il .
the snow@@ k@@ op@@ pe is the most famous mountain of the giant mountains .
man@@ f@@ red rich@@ ter lo@@ ves the painting with the mo@@ ti@@ f from his home .
judge was born in 19@@ 30 in tr@@ au@@ ten@@ au / north bo@@ hem@@ ia , today tr@@ ut@@ no@@ v .
after four years of secondary school he was already interested in the profes@@ sion of teachers with 14 .
one year later , the su@@ de@@ ten german@@ s were ex@@ propri@@ ated .
within half an hour the family had to leave .
after a few months in one camp , in 194@@ 6 , he went to bav@@ aria - the freight car .
thus , jud@@ ges fell into the upper fran@@ con@@ ian sen@@ k@@ endor@@ f .
the teacher training took place in b@@ am@@ berg .
man@@ f@@ red rich@@ ter had to travel ten kilometres to the ne@@ arest train station six times a week , travel by train to b@@ am@@ berg , and go through school three kilometres across the city and return to school in the evening .
after two months , man@@ f@@ red rich@@ ter got a red cross home in b@@ am@@ berg with a sle@@ eping opportunity : together with up to 15 students in a dor@@ mit@@ ory .
in 195@@ 1 he made the first and in 195@@ 4 after three years of teaching candidate the second state exam@@ en .
he was a member of the german society for the study of the german language and the german language institute ( b@@ mb@@ f ) .
the &quot; miss room &quot; was his first &quot; service apartment &quot; in the school .
in 195@@ 8 , he joined the school in a newly built teacher &apos;s house next to the school .
this house bought man@@ f@@ red rich@@ ter in 1980 , after the school had been dis@@ solved in k@@ ol@@ l@@ bach in 196@@ 8 .
until then , there were no more than 100 students in k@@ ol@@ l@@ bach at the pe@@ ter@@ sha@@ us@@ en-@@ k@@ ol@@ l@@ bach school association and five in pe@@ ter@@ sha@@ us@@ en .
from the school year 196@@ 8 / 69 , these were published in pe@@ ter@@ sha@@ us@@ en in the town hall today .
when the school association in@@ der@@ s@@ dorf was founded , only primary school remained in the town .
in order to avoid a down@@ gr@@ ading in the now smaller school , the then rec@@ tor geor@@ g si@@ gl moved to kar@@ ls@@ fel@@ d - and man@@ f@@ red rich@@ ter became his success@@ or .
but pe@@ ter@@ sha@@ us@@ en grew , and so the children and their teachers could obtain the present building from september 198@@ 2 , which was extended in 1997 after judge &apos;s reti@@ rement .
man@@ f@@ red rich@@ ter pra@@ ises the un@@ complicated gener@@ os@@ ity of the then may@@ or lu@@ d@@ wi@@ g g@@ ö@@ tz , who also had a workshop at community cost and built cel@@ lar spaces during the 1997 enlargement , although this was not permitted by guidelines .
&quot; may@@ or g@@ ö@@ tz was very scho@@ ol@@ -@@ friendly , &quot; jud@@ ges re@@ mem@@ bered .
man@@ f@@ red rich@@ ter never gave a government representative &apos;s speech in his career , which was based on a lec@@ ture from a school council on justice and justice : &apos; you can never forget love &apos; .
&quot; we have to give children two things : roots and w@@ ings , &quot; says the 8@@ 4-@@ year-@@ old .
and he had to learn : &quot; this is not always successful &quot; .
in any case , jud@@ ges do sometimes was un@@ conventional .
when students be@@ aten , they did not receive criminal proceedings and were not allowed to sit down .
at the expense of the community judge had created two pair of bo@@ x@@ ing glo@@ ves and let the two counter@@ parties compete against each other , even though there should be a ve@@ il .
for the good of the school , jud@@ ges as rec@@ tor had a good relationship with the then may@@ or lu@@ d@@ wi@@ g g@@ ö@@ tz ( c@@ su ) .
he moved the par@@ tis@@ an judge after his reti@@ rement to be at least the last on the c@@ su list for the local council in 1996 .
but jud@@ ges were chosen in sixth place and joined the c@@ su .

hr@@ 4-@@ rad@@ tour 700 bi@@ kers set out in the bad salz@@ haus@@ en spa park and sco@@ ts sto@@ po@@ vers a good start to the day .
if cy@@ cli@@ sts are on their tour in bad salz@@ haus@@ en or scotland , that is nothing special in itself .
on friday , however , the number of re@@ sting impres@@ sions made : the 700 participants of the hr@@ 4 cycling tour and the accompan@@ ying tro@@ t enjoyed a break in the lower spa park of bad salz@@ haus@@ en and later a party under the sky in scotland .
the mo@@ tto &quot; cycling and celebr@@ ating on newly discovered paths between ni@@ d@@ da and kin@@ zi@@ g &quot; was that the participants met in bad vil@@ bel on thursday and had a concert by van ba@@ ker &amp; band there .
on friday it was serious : the cy@@ cli@@ sts took the first stage , 60 kilometres over fl@@ or@@ stadt to bad salz@@ haus@@ en and further to sco@@ ts .
in bad salz@@ haus@@ en , the sport@@ sm@@ en were invited by may@@ or han@@ s-@@ peter s@@ eu@@ m , who was also involved in bad vil@@ bel by bicycle , and the manager of the own factory bad salz@@ haus@@ en , pe@@ tra sch@@ w@@ ingen .
to refres@@ h body and mind , all kinds of good things had been prepared : the rural women from ran@@ stadt and ni@@ e@@ der@@ -@@ mo@@ ck@@ stadt had 85 sheets of apple , t@@ wi@@ gs , sc@@ at@@ ter cheese and cheese .
&quot; such ca@@ kes can only ba@@ ke rural women , &quot; p@@ raised an a@@ ul@@ len@@ di@@ e@@ bach particip@@ ant while or@@ dering another piece .
at the sport club &apos;s be@@ verage stand , the s@@ cour@@ -@@ ni@@ d@@ da was able to get cold refres@@ h@@ ments .
the &quot; du@@ o bra@@ vo &quot; enter@@ tained the visitors with famous me@@ lo@@ dies from o@@ pe@@ re@@ tt@@ as and musi@@ c@@ als and har@@ ves@@ ted enthusi@@ astic applause .
the park &apos;s beautiful surroundings were relaxing .
a lord also enjoyed a head massage from his partner : &quot; he deserves that , after all , he has already ski@@ pped bicycle cha@@ ins today rein@@ for@@ ced &quot; .
meanwhile , the may@@ or and the manager of the company had to work : they were at the foun@@ tain in front of re@@ porter ra@@ iner jan@@ ke &apos;s drinking cu@@ re@@ board and took the opportunity to listen on the radio for bad salz@@ haus@@ en .
also , the head of the promotion to@@ bi@@ as h@@ agen , since the first hr@@ 4 bike tour in 2004 , could only be short , but he had plenty of experience with the local technology .
his pic@@ k@@ up tr@@ uck , in which he was able to capture the sound of the music with three tele@@ phones and a radio unit with his staff and the 15@@ -@@ person motor@@ cycle rela@@ y of the police h@@ ess@@ en , was able .
&quot; the majority of participants are from the r@@ hin@@ e-@@ main region , &quot; he said , &quot; but also from gi@@ e@@ ß@@ en or ful@@ da , from lau@@ ter@@ bach or the ta@@ un@@ us and even from numerous cities in west@@ ph@@ alia .
the number of participants is a little determined by the available accommodation capacity .
in category i , participants are accommo@@ dated in hotels , in category ii in collective accommodation .
the cy@@ cli@@ sts had a good impression of the spa when they left after a hour and a half : &quot; t@@ sch@@ ü@@ ss ! &quot;
&quot; it was nice in bad salz@@ haus@@ en ! &quot; they w@@ av@@ ed to f@@ are@@ well .
after arriving in scotland , the group was allowed to take a short break .
but in the evening the cy@@ cli@@ sts were asked to ride in the id@@ yl@@ lic al@@ te@@ bur@@ g@@ park .
under the direction of the sch@@ ot@@ ten@@ er ges@@ ell@@ schaft für tour@@ is@@ m@@ us und stad@@ t@@ marketing ( g@@ ts ) , the park had received a beautiful celebr@@ ation and of course had been served delic@@ acies , such as fl@@ am@@ e-@@ ca@@ kes with a well cool@@ ed , with a well as a well-@@ cool@@ ed fea@@ ther white fea@@ ther spr@@ ings .
may@@ or sus@@ anne sch@@ a@@ ab , g@@ ts managing director mark@@ us ho@@ ß@@ fel@@ d and m@@ sc@@ -@@ chairman wol@@ f@@ gan@@ g wag@@ ner@@ -@@ s@@ ach@@ s in his role as a member of the board of directors of ad@@ ac h@@ ess@@ en-@@ thur@@ in@@ gia .
the three showed themselves to be pleased with the &quot; many operations in scotland &quot; .
d@@ j to@@ bi@@ as h@@ agen then released the dance stage .
the opportunity to move in the open air was not missed despite the athle@@ tic activities on the bike .
the guests were increasingly comp@@ as@@ sion@@ ate with citizens who were as impres@@ sed by the good mo@@ od as the great number of cy@@ cli@@ sts .
on the second day , the cy@@ cli@@ sts were able to use the bir@@ stein , w@@ ach@@ er@@ s@@ bach and bad or@@ b stations - including a concert with the tren@@ dy forests - on the programme .
yesterday , after 18@@ 0 kilometres of cycling , the athle@@ tes met again in bad vil@@ bel .
do@@ z@@ ens of turkish police for &quot; con@@ spir@@ acy &quot; against the government arrested and de@@ tained .
a total of 33 police officers were arrested in turkey for susp@@ ici@@ on of &quot; con@@ spir@@ acy against the government &quot; , reporting local media agencies .
the police authorities did not make an immediate comment .
among the ar@@ re@@ sts are 14 senior polic@@ em@@ en , reported hur@@ ri@@ yet daily news .
some of them were involved in the corruption investigations against government officials , including four government ministers last december .
in july , a number of turkish police officers were arrested for sup@@ pos@@ ed@@ ly setting up an organised criminal association and ta@@ pping phone numbers .
turkish president rec@@ ep ta@@ y@@ y@@ ip er@@ do@@ gan ( who was then prime minister ) described her actions as part of the activities that the islam@@ ist spiritual fe@@ thu@@ lla g@@ ü@@ l@@ len had against him and other people in power against him .
not all children in ukraine are returning to school
schools almost everywhere in ukraine opened on monday ( september 1 ) after the summer holidays .
this day is tradi@@ tionally an important day for families , and , like thousands of other ukra@@ inian parents , prime minister ar@@ sen@@ i@@ j jaz@@ en@@ ju@@ k brought his daughter to school .
there he told waiting journalists that not all schools had re@@ opened , but he was determined to open the country for future generations :
the september celebra@@ tions were not held in every school .
heav@@ en is not peaceful across ukraine .
we must fight for a peaceful sky .
the whole of ukraine , a huge common ukra@@ inian people &apos;s front , must fight for a peaceful sky .
ale@@ k@@ san pa@@ stu@@ k@@ how , head of school in sla@@ w@@ jan@@ sk , the jaz@@ en@@ ju@@ k daughter visited , spoke in russian .
we hope that peace will finally re@@ ign here and that children will be given education that will be useful to them in their lives .
the first day of the new school year is tradi@@ tionally celebrated , with children em@@ bro@@ ide@@ red shir@@ ts , bal@@ lo@@ ons in their hands and giving their teachers flowers .
with ron@@ a fair@@ head , the bb@@ c may have found the great director it needs .
she meets with a proud gl@@ ory from the banking world , media management and the inner circle of the tory party .
and it has its own fron@@ tal experience .
her career began with ba@@ in and co , a global management consulting firm , which she was looking for at mor@@ gan stan@@ ley , bom@@ ba@@ di@@ er , ic@@ i and pe@@ ar@@ s@@ ons ’ media world .
she was the executive director of the financial times for seven years and re@@ signed when the parent company pe@@ ar@@ son was transferred to a younger male member .
their compensation was supposed to be nearly £ 1 million .
your political ran@@ k@@ ings are also solid .
she was mur@@ dered by lord bro@@ wn@@ e , former b@@ p chairman david camer@@ on , when he was seeking more private economic knowledge in wh@@ ite@@ hall : she was sent to the cab@@ in council .
her hus@@ band is a former tory council member .
as early as may , i described the chair &apos;s task with a po@@ is@@ oned cup .
not only is the bb@@ c a vast and complex entity at the heart of public life , but there is also an internal par@@ ado@@ x in its structure .
trust works in two directions : in@@ ward to the first guard of its own management hier@@ arch@@ y in the bb@@ c , but also exter@@ n@@ ally as a voice of public concern and dis@@ quiet when things go wrong .
this provides for an almost un@@ sustainable du@@ o@@ po@@ ly , which demands a complete comprehensive reform .
but which new in@@ coming chair would risk taking on , going on and setting up an institution that is so complex as a chinese dy@@ na@@ sty , while he is not self-@@ sufficient ?
it is a difficult task .
and as if that were not enough , many people are also interested in reducing the bb@@ c - power , money , and status .
as competition moves closer and new technologies allow old , comfortable col@@ lateral to be threatened , the forthcoming negotiation of licence fees for the bb@@ c is en@@ tail@@ ed with particular risks .
for the modest sum of £ 14@@ 5.@@ 50 per year , the british public is buying into what is probably the world &apos;s largest media company .
the bb@@ c tells a good story : it says that it reach@@ es 96 % of all house@@ holds , and each of them costs only 40 p@@ ence a day .
and the bb@@ c seems to be rising on the popul@@ arity scale again : 53 % support them today , compared to 31 % before 10 years ago .
the visual and usage hab@@ its of the bb@@ c have changed : i get news head@@ lines today on my mobile phone and see packed news .
but it remains a very dear and no@@ table institution .
it needs a considerable chairman - i hope she has found him .
per@@ ry from tex@@ as says that low@@ ering t@@ we@@ et was not authorized .
a t@@ we@@ et from the official account of the republic@@ an govern@@ or of tex@@ as , ric@@ k per@@ ry , on sunday included a down@@ fall comment about the democratic district state prosecu@@ tor , who was at the center of a criminal prosecu@@ tion .
the t@@ we@@ et was later deleted and replaced by another per@@ ry account that re@@ vo@@ ked the previous step .
just is a t@@ we@@ et sent from my account , which is not authorized by me .
&quot; i don &apos;t approve the t@@ we@@ et and have deleted it , &quot; it was said in the later news .
per@@ ry staff did not respond immediately to requests for comments .
although per@@ ry &apos;s official user account was created , the t@@ wee@@ ts were not clear who was actually running the feed .
in the former t@@ we@@ et , an un@@ favourable image of the district prosecu@@ tor of trav@@ is county , ros@@ em@@ ary le@@ h@@ m@@ berg , was drawn , which was declared a &quot; national treas@@ ure &quot; in april 2013 .
per@@ ry ve@@ to@@ ed financial support for her office when she refused to go back , which led to an acc@@ us@@ ation against per@@ ry - who may have been president in 20@@ 16 .
the t@@ wee@@ ts text reads : &quot; i am not always dr@@ un@@ k with the tri@@ ple alcohol level ... but if i do , i can compla@@ in go@@ o@@ d-@@ nat@@ ured .
i am the dr@@ un@@ k democr@@ at in tex@@ as .
le@@ h@@ m@@ berg &apos;s office was not responsible for the investigation of the grand jury against per@@ ry .
this was done by michael mc@@ cr@@ um , a special prosecu@@ tor from san ant@@ oni@@ o , who was chosen by a republic@@ an judge .
per@@ ry ple@@ ads for not guil@@ ty and called the charge a political tr@@ ick .
his high@@ ly-@@ class team of legal advis@@ ors applied for a legal re@@ me@@ dy for the judge charged with the case , argu@@ ing that the law that vio@@ lates the service provider is not valid .
per@@ ry stopped $ 7.@@ 5 million of government funds from the public integrity unit of the state - which was set up in trav@@ is county .
this ve@@ to has caused a public compla@@ int from a lef@@ t-@@ wing wat@@ ch@@ dog group .
per@@ ry &apos;s official account is updated frequently - and sometimes famous .
after having been elected to the i@@ ow@@ a electoral assembly during his presidential candi@@ d@@ acy in 2012 , per@@ ry went on to spec@@ ulate that the country would stop .
ber@@ ke@@ ley once again decla@@ res the housing market &quot; normal &quot; .
one of the most prominent construction contrac@@ tors in london pointed out that the housing market in the south-@@ east of england has returned to normal levels .
home in the capital was ho@@ tly sought and the subject of huge price rises , which the bank of england has been unable to accept because of widespread fear of a credit bu@@ b@@ ble .
ton@@ y pi@@ d@@ g@@ ley , founder and ceo of the high-@@ class construction company ber@@ ke@@ ley said on monday : &quot; since the beginning of the current financial year , the market has returned to normal transaction levels since the peak of 2013 .
the london housing market was well posi@@ tioned during the down@@ turn , as foreign bu@@ yers pus@@ hed to the capital .
according to the register office , prices in the city area alone have jum@@ ped by 18@@ .@@ 5 % last year , far more than the average increase in england and wal@@ es in general .
the average sales prices at ber@@ ke@@ ley &apos;s private , cheap and student offers rose by about one-@@ fifth last year , reaching a year-@@ end of 4@@ 23@@ ,000 p@@ ounds .
a stronger p@@ ound , however , has in recent months made property in london less attractive to foreign bu@@ yers - some of them are also affected by the introduction of new property taxes and political rhe@@ tor@@ ic about a possible &quot; vill@@ en@@ tax &quot; in may .
london ’ s real estate agent fo@@ x@@ tons war@@ ned last week that the mort@@ gage market report for april , in which shar@@ per mort@@ gage credit markets were subject to a review , was not adopted in the second half of the year .
new data from the bank of england on monday show a decline in mort@@ gage authori@@ zation in july , which also indicates that the housing market is cooling .
h@@ amp@@ tions international , another real estate agency , correc@@ ted his forec@@ ast for the rise in london property prices for 20@@ 15 down to 3 % , based on an already weak@@ ening housing price .
the volume of transactions in london ’ s most expensive areas , such as ch@@ el@@ sea , may@@ fair , and ken@@ sing@@ ton , has now fallen by a quarter each year , according to the bro@@ ker wa ell@@ is .
yet the desire for a home in the capital is a bl@@ essing for ber@@ ke@@ ley , because the amounts due are not enough for fu@@ tures sales to exceed £ 2.@@ 2 billion .
mr pi@@ d@@ g@@ ley added : &apos; the demand for the right , well-@@ planned product at the best sites remained stable and as a result the short@@ ages of fu@@ tures have remained stable . &apos;
in june , the company reported that there were 3,@@ 7@@ 42 new homes in the year until the end of april - almost a third more than the pre-@@ crisis peak in 2007 .
the annual pre-@@ tax result rose by 40 percent to £ 2@@ 80 million , and sales increased by 18 percent to £ 1.@@ 6 billion .
in a communication on monday before the annual general meeting of the company , mr pi@@ d@@ g@@ ley said that revenue for ber@@ ke@@ ley is expected to be in line with current market expectations this year .
analy@@ sts agree that the annual pre-@@ tax result is 4@@ 50 million £ .
ber@@ ke@@ ley stocks were in the afternoon at 2@@ 3.@@ 96 £ in london trading .
nu@@ de photos from j@@ enni@@ fer law@@ rence published by h@@ ack@@ ers on the internet by h@@ ack@@ ers .
j@@ enni@@ fer law@@ rence performance at the 8@@ 5th os@@ car@@ -@@ award .
nu@@ de photos of the o@@ sc@@ ar prize winner j@@ enni@@ fer law@@ rence were shot online by a h@@ ack@@ er who claimed to have a &quot; master list &quot; of images of another 100 star@@ lets .
a representative of the star from &quot; the tribute of pan@@ em &quot; confirmed that the photos of law@@ rence really are real and compla@@ ined to the h@@ ack@@ er for &quot; bl@@ at@@ ant violation of privacy &quot; .
the authorities have been notified and will follow all those who have taken the sto@@ len photos of j@@ enni@@ fer law@@ rence .
the photos originally published on the photo sharing page 4@@ ch@@ an were alle@@ ge@@ dly replaced by a gap in the online storage system ic@@ l@@ oud by apple procurement .
it is not sure how many of the images are real , although win@@ ste@@ ad , star from &quot; scot@@ t pil@@ gri@@ m against the rest of the world &quot; on t@@ wit@@ ter also condemned the h@@ ack .
&quot; to those of you who look at photos that my hus@@ band and i took in the private environment of our house years ago - i hope you are really satisfied with you , &quot; win@@ ste@@ ad wrote on t@@ wit@@ ter .
victori@@ a justice from the n@@ ick@@ o@@ de@@ on series &quot; ic@@ arly &quot; and &quot; victori@@ ous &quot; , however , stopped by saying that the photos were pictures of her .
let us not go for the beginning . * wor@@ t@@ spi@@ el intended * .
bu@@ zz@@ feed reported on late sunday that a spo@@ kes@@ man of pop star ari@@ ana gran@@ de had confirmed the authentic@@ ity of the alleg@@ ed photos of her .
exclusive extr@@ act from ho@@ ward jac@@ ob@@ son &apos;s highly p@@ raised new novel about love and the letter &quot; j &quot; .
they were crus@@ hed , so the best way to describe them was to slowly dis@@ solve like a car@@ ton that was in the rain .
occa@@ sion@@ ally , a woman told him that he was too serious , ex@@ hau@@ sting , intense , di@@ stan@@ ced , and perhaps rather scr@@ at@@ ch@@ brus@@ hing .
and then sha@@ ken his hand .
he knew scr@@ at@@ ch brus@@ h .
he was st@@ acked , as in i@@ gel , yes .
the last victim of this st@@ up@@ id@@ ity was a recent aff@@ air that was more promising for alle@@ vi@@ ating the lon@@ ely bo@@ re@@ dom of his life than usual , and perhaps even a certain satisfaction for him .
a@@ il@@ in sol@@ om@@ on was a trem@@ bling ten@@ der beauty with un@@ t@@ amed hair and a fl@@ at@@ tering heart from a village on the north island , which was even more remote and r@@ ough than port report .
it had come with an older compan@@ ion to the south , which ke@@ ver@@ n held for her a@@ un@@ t , and which had a p@@ lot in a we@@ t but paradise valley with the appropriate name paradise valley .
for several years , no one had lived in the house .
the tu@@ bes were le@@ ak , in the bathrooms were still sp@@ id@@ ers , nu@@ de cu@@ ps had their trac@@ es left on all windows and believed they belong@@ ed to all of this , and the garden was with wee@@ ds .
it was like the house from a children &apos;s fair@@ y tal@@ e , both threat@@ ening and attractive , a garden full of secre@@ ts .
por@@ tra@@ it of the author : ho@@ ward jac@@ ob@@ son , whose novel &quot; j &quot; on the long@@ list for the man boo@@ ker prize 20@@ 14 .
the short@@ list will be published next week .
k@@ ess@@ en had been in charge of the broken song st@@ alls in the high gr@@ ass with ail@@ in and had an un@@ usually warm spring afternoon .
your feet are too big .
because of their own aggres@@ si@@ veness , songs of this kind were no longer played on the con@@ sole .
not for@@ bi@@ dden - nothing was really for@@ bi@@ dden - just not played .
it has been successfully ob@@ sole@@ te , as has the word ob@@ sole@@ te .
the general taste created what dec@@ ree and regulation would never have achieved , and how people in books could have used the vo@@ m tell@@ rec@@ it@@ or@@ y-@@ z@@ um mil@@ li@@ on@@ ai@@ res , cook@@ books and love nov@@ els .
in the eu@@ ph@@ oria of the day , ke@@ ver@@ n began playing an imag@@ inary piano and playing in a gro@@ b-@@ com@@ ic se@@ ren@@ ade of ail@@ in@@ ns great feet .
ail@@ in did not understand that .
&quot; this was a well-known song by a jazz pi@@ an@@ ist called f@@ ats w@@ all@@ er , &quot; he explained her and placed two fing@@ ers on his li@@ ps automatically .
his father had always done this to stop letter j before he left his mouth .
it had started as a game between him and his father when he was still small .
his father had played it with his own father , so he had told .
if you start a word with an j without having to put two fing@@ ers over your li@@ ps , it costs you a pen@@ ny .
it was not a very fun@@ ny game back then , and it was not very fun@@ ny now either .
he knew that he was expected to do so , that was all .
it had to explain what jazz was .
a@@ il@@ in had never heard of anyone .
jazz , even though it was not directly prohibited , was not played .
the impro@@ vis@@ ation was not modern any@@ more .
the room was very small and the bed was very comfortable .
at the beginning of a me@@ lo@@ dy , people wanted to be quite sure where they would end .
the same applies to the mind .
his un@@ predic@@ tability made people ner@@ vous .
and jazz was musi@@ cally expressed mind .
although he was 10 years old , without being heard by sam@@ my dav@@ is junior , ke@@ ver@@ n knew something about jazz from the half-@@ secret collection of old c@@ ds of his father .
but at least he did not have to explain to ail@@ in that f@@ ats w@@ all@@ er was black .
at her age she could probably not remember a time when pop sing@@ ers were not black .
again , no laws or constra@@ ints were applied .
a con@@ form@@ ist society meant that each element of this society than@@ k@@ fully endor@@ sed the principle of group talent - than@@ k@@ fully as that of dest@@ iny spa@@ red .
people of a@@ fro@@ -@@ caribbean origin were affected by temper@@ ament and body construction for entertainment and sports , so san@@ g and ran them .
people who were originally from the indian sub@@ continent were treated with electronic talent , as if by nature , and were faced with the task of ensuring that no family can be left without a working service telephone .
what was left of the polish community was concerned about se@@ wage treatment ; what was said by the gre@@ e@@ ks was broken down plates .
those from the gulf states and the lev@@ ante , whose grand@@ parents had not quickly left the country than what had happened when it had happened - out of fear , because of fire , to be accused of being accused , fe@@ ared .
each according to his abilities .
since she only heard b@@ all@@ ads , ail@@ in found it hard to understand how the off@@ ensive words that k@@ vers put her just now are .
music was an expression of love .
&quot; they are not really off@@ ensive , &quot; said ke@@ ver@@ n .
except perhaps for people whose feet are too large .
my father never insul@@ ted anyone , but he loved this song .
he talked too much , but the negl@@ ected garden gave him the dec@@ ep@@ tive sense of security .
nothing could have been the sound insul@@ ation of the huge co@@ al-@@ like leaves .
a@@ il@@ in still did not understand .
why should your father have loved this ?
he wanted to say that it was a ju@@ x , but hesit@@ ated to bring two fing@@ ers back to the li@@ ps in their present .
she thought that he was something strange anyway .
&quot; it seemed fun@@ ny to him , &quot; he said instead .
she sha@@ ken dis@@ belief and closed bis@@ cu@@ it ’ s sight .
there was nothing else to see around the world than to see her un@@ comb@@ ed r@@ ab@@ en@@ black hair .
there was nothing he would have liked to see .
&quot; if you say it , &quot; do you mean without convic@@ tion .
but that doesn &apos;t explain why you are telling me .
it seemed to be genuinely concerned .
are my feet too big ?
he looked back .
your feet so directly not .
maybe your an@@ k@@ les , a little bit of a ...
and tho@@ u sa@@ y@@ est h@@ ate me because my an@@ k@@ les are too th@@ ick ?
h@@ ate you ?
of course i h@@ ate you not .
that is just the sil@@ ly song .
he could have said &quot; i love you &quot; , but for that it was too early .
&quot; your th@@ ick an@@ k@@ les are the reason why you like me , &quot; he tried instead .
i am a bit per@@ verse .
that did not sound right .
it was fun@@ ny .
if he tried to be fun@@ ny , he often got into trouble because he , like his father , did not have the so@@ o@@ thing charm that was needed to get the money into jo@@ kes .
perhaps his father also wanted to be cru@@ el .
perhaps he wanted to be that , k@@ vere@@ n .
despite his kind eyes .
a@@ il@@ in sol@@ om@@ ons was red and raised from her dec@@ k chair , thre@@ w the con@@ sole and dis@@ posed of the ro@@ pe , the wine she had dr@@ un@@ k .
hol@@ under@@ bl@@ ü@@ t@@ te@@ we@@ in , so dr@@ un@@ ken@@ he@@ it was no exc@@ use for him .
in her ex@@ ci@@ tement she seemed to trem@@ ble as pal@@ m@@ we@@ del in stor@@ m .
&quot; and your th@@ ick@@ et head is precisely the reason why i felt per@@ ver@@ ted towards you , &quot; she said ...
except that i am not .
she was sorry , both for the unnecessary us@@ eless nature of his words and the fear that she showed when she spoke to him .
did she think that he would beat them ?
she had not told him of life on the cold northern archi@@ pel@@ ago , where she had grown up , but he had no doubt that it was essentially the same as here .
the same huge and ic@@ y ocean bro@@ ke out here as there on the shore .
the same conf@@ used men , with even th@@ ick@@ er skin and more vulnerable after what happened than it had their an@@ ce@@ st@@ ors as s@@ mu@@ gg@@ lers and beach rob@@ bers , attrac@@ ted from k@@ nei@@ pe to k@@ nei@@ pe to k@@ nei@@ pe .
th@@ ick@@ head ?
they would have shown her a big f@@ ist if she didn &apos;t care !
you just cr@@ un@@ ch - k@@ n@@ ut@@ sch@@ en was the most used word for an ero@@ tic attr@@ action between men and women , a counter@@ po@@ ison to the non@@ sense love s@@ ons .
ke@@ ver@@ n ’ s view was that this was unnecessary re@@ fin@@ ement , as cr@@ ut@@ ching itself was an act of violence .
a@@ il@@ in sol@@ om@@ ons gave him a sign to walk through her body .
he was raised from the dec@@ k-@@ chair like an old man .
she also felt ble@@ eding , but the balance of his sor@@ row surprised her .
that was not the end of the world .
they knew little .
she saw him as he depar@@ ted - as if from a room on the top floor her compan@@ ion wat@@ ched him - a man compla@@ ined about something he himself had been sum@@ mon@@ ed .
ad@@ am leaves the garden , thought it .
she felt a su@@ dden pain for him and men in general , although some had raised their hands against them .
one man turned away from her , wor@@ ried his back , ash@@ amed , defe@@ ated , without a spirit of struggle - why was this a sight that you seemed to know well when you were not at a single time .
when she was alone again , ail@@ in looked at sol@@ om@@ on &apos;s feet .
several years before the events that have just been told , es@@ me n@@ us@@ s@@ bau@@ m , an intelligent and enthusi@@ astic 3@@ 2-@@ year-@@ old resear@@ cher , worked on behalf of of@@ now , the non-@@ legislative supervisory body for the public sector .
&quot; a lot has been done and a lot still needs to be done , &quot; she wrote , &quot; to understand the in@@ n@@ ate aggres@@ si@@ veness of a people who have w@@ aged a thousand wars and won most of them , especially in the remote valle@@ ys .
but some characteristics turn out to be un@@ ext@@ inc@@ able .
the higher the church tower , it seems , the less the passion it continues to awa@@ ken .
the people are cr@@ ying in the hearing of s@@ enti@@ mental b@@ all@@ ads , am@@ a@@ zed by stories of overcome difficulties , and claim to be firmly attached to the virtu@@ es of marriage and family life , but not only does the former remain the same .
&quot; they have an unfortunate tend@@ ency to ex@@ ag@@ ger@@ ate , &quot; she meant when he read the whole report .
i suggest that you read less nov@@ els .
es@@ me wal@@ nu@@ t tree dro@@ pped her head .
i must also ask : are you a@@ the@@ ist ?
&quot; i do not think i need to say , &quot; es@@ me answered n@@ us@@ s@@ bau@@ m .
are you les@@ bian ?
es@@ me again invo@@ ked her right to privacy and ref@@ usal of the statement .
fem@@ in@@ ist ?
silence again .
&quot; i don &apos;t ask that , &quot; lu@@ ther r@@ ab@@ in@@ o@@ wit@@ z said , &quot; because i am against a@@ the@@ ism , les@@ bi@@ an@@ ism or fem@@ in@@ ism .
this is a job without pre@@ jud@@ ice .
we are serving a society free of pre@@ jud@@ ice .
but certain types of hyper@@ sensi@@ tivity that are in themselves absolutely acceptable and comm@@ end@@ able can occa@@ sion@@ ally produce results such as those you have presented .
they themselves seem to have pre@@ jud@@ ices against the church , and these things , which they call &apos; dis@@ gu@@ sting &apos; and &apos; raw &apos; , could be interpreted by others as an expression of natural strength and vit@@ ality .
if you continue to ride around what happened when it happened , as if it were , if it had happened , yesterday , then you would have given the country its essential vit@@ ality .
es@@ me wal@@ ked around , while r@@ ab@@ in@@ o@@ wit@@ z spoke .
behind his head , a led let@@ tering in fl@@ am@@ ing@@ or@@ os@@ a repeated the advice of@@ now gave to the country in the last quarter of a century or longer .
sm@@ ile at your neighb@@ ors , value your partner , listen to b@@ all@@ ads , visit musi@@ c@@ als , use your phone , talk , explain , listen to , agree , agree , exc@@ use yourself .
speaking is better than silence , the sound word is better than the written word , but nothing is better than love .
&quot; i understand absolutely what you want to go to , &quot; es@@ me n@@ us@@ s@@ bau@@ m answered with a calm voice when she was sure that her superior had spoken at the end , &quot; and i say nothing more than that we were heal@@ ed .
my concern is that we may be able to find ourselves , without warning , in the way we repeat the mistakes that have actually occurred in the first place , as to what happened when it happened .
this time , however , it is not the others that we are going to let out our an@@ ger and mi@@ str@@ ust .
lu@@ ther r@@ ab@@ in@@ o@@ wit@@ z formed a py@@ ram@@ id with his hands .
to be able to show an eng@@ el@@ s@@ pati@@ ence .
&quot; they go too far , &quot; he said , &quot; if they call actions &quot; mistakes &quot; that our grand@@ parents may or may not have committed .
they are also going too far when they say that they have their &apos; an@@ ger &apos; and their &apos; mi@@ str@@ ust &apos; of &apos; others &apos; .
it should not be necessary to remind someone in their position that we have been very careful in understanding the past and protecting the present , not of &apos; us &apos; and &apos; others &apos; .
there was no &quot; we &quot; and there was no &quot; other &quot; .
it was a time of dis@@ order , that is all we know .
&quot; from that , if we are honest to ourselves , &quot; d@@ ared to throw es@@ me , &quot; no part of society can claim to have beha@@ ved well .
i am not compla@@ ining to anyone .
whether it has been done badly or well , what has happened has happened .
that was then .
there is nothing more to say on this - we agree .
and just as no blame must be assigned , no guil@@ t must be re@@ paid if such re@@ payment is appropriate and if there is a way to re@@ pay it .
but what is the past for if we do not learn from it -
the past serves to forget them .
if i may say something about this , i would like to say something about it .
lu@@ ther r@@ ab@@ in@@ o@@ wit@@ z had his py@@ ram@@ id collap@@ sed .
&quot; i will consider your report , &quot; he said and dis@@ missed it .
the next day , when she went to work as usual , she was cros@@ sed by a motor@@ cy@@ c@@ list who , as pas@@ ser@@ s-@@ by described , was in a kind of &quot; brut@@ al r@@ age &quot; on the foot .
there are some coinci@@ dence .
les@@ o@@ th@@ o military member says that no cou@@ p is planned ; prime minister remains in south africa ; prime minister remains in south africa ; prime minister remains in south africa
military officials in les@@ o@@ th@@ o argu@@ ed that a cou@@ p d &apos;@@ é@@ t@@ at would over@@ throw the government , and said that it was going against polic@@ em@@ en who had been denied the arm@@ ing of political fan@@ a@@ tics .
prime minister thomas th@@ ab@@ ane f@@ led the country and announced that the country ’ s army had r@@ al@@ lied his dom@@ ic@@ ile and built government buildings in the capital , mas@@ er@@ u .
the premier brought his family to the ad@@ jac@@ ent south africa after being told of threats of attack .
military spo@@ kes@@ man major n@@ te@@ le n@@ to@@ i said that there was , in fact , no cou@@ p d &apos;@@ é@@ t@@ at , but that the military was respon@@ ding to the threat of &quot; political fan@@ a@@ tics &quot; , whose armed presence .
&quot; what happened this morning was that the staff of les@@ o@@ th@@ o &apos;s defense forces acted after he received several intelligence reports that within the police some elements could act that were actually some of the political , party political young fan@@ a@@ tics .
south african spo@@ kes@@ man cla@@ y@@ son mon@@ y@@ ela said that military action had the impression of a re@@ vers@@ al .
&quot; although no one has claimed that violence has tor@@ n the government itself , all reports are agreed that the activities of the les@@ ot@@ to defence forces have so far been indic@@ ative of a cou@@ p d &apos;@@ é@@ t@@ at , &quot; he said .
spo@@ kes@@ man for the les@@ o@@ th@@ o military announced on sunday that the soldiers had returned to their bar@@ r@@ acks and had to leave the capital in peace .
in the meantime , vice premier mo@@ the@@ t@@ jo@@ ya met@@ sing has taken over the governance of th@@ ab@@ ane ’ s absence .
th@@ ab@@ ane told him that he believed he was in@@ ju@@ red because of his attempt to combat corruption in the country .
in les@@ o@@ th@@ o , there have been major ten@@ sions since june , after th@@ ab@@ ane had suspended parliamentary meetings due to the dispute in his uni@@ fied government .
he said that his actions had not under@@ min@@ ed the government , and that he had not done so .
production in the eurozone at a 13 month low
the rise in eurozone production slow@@ ed to € 1.@@ 2 billion in august , with the eurozone ’ s lowest point in the last 13 months .
the final mark@@ it purchasing man@@ a index of the manufacturing industry ( p@@ mi ) fell to 5@@ 0.@@ 7 in august , after a bo@@ oth of 5@@ 1.@@ 8 in july .
a 50 number indicates an expansion .
new orders have been dec@@ lining and fac@@ tories have been falling at a time of rising ten@@ sions between the eu and russia over ukraine .
the figures are coming up before the european central bank ( ecb ) meeting on thursday .
markets expect the bank to draw up a clear plan for dealing with a re@@ luc@@ t@@ ant eurozone recovery and the threat of de@@ fl@@ ation at a rate of only 0.@@ 3 % .
there is spec@@ ulation that the head of the ecb , mari@@ o drag@@ hi , will be able to provide further information later this week as to whether he can provide quanti@@ tative eas@@ ing for the eurozone , in line with that of the us and the united kingdom .
&quot; although small growth is better than no growth , the slow@@ ing effects of increasing economic and geo@@ political un@@ certain@@ ties are more obvious to manufacturers , &quot; ro@@ b do@@ b@@ son , senior economic scienti@@ st , said .
the factory p@@ mi for germany , russia &apos;s largest trading partner in the eu , has fallen to its lowest level in 11 months with 5@@ 1.@@ 4 .
meanwhile , in the second largest economy of the blo@@ c , france , the p@@ mi fell to 4@@ 6.@@ 9 .
france remains a trou@@ b@@ led child , as is italy ’ s decline from solid expansion to stag@@ nation .
indic@@ ations that growth stimul@@ us is the key to germany and spain and the netherlands are no longer effective are also un@@ re@@ ass@@ uring , &quot; said mr do@@ b@@ son .
the decline in industry is likely to fuel the fire of analy@@ sts who seek further monetary or fiscal stimul@@ us .
a positive news came from the republic of ireland , where the p@@ mi increased to 5@@ 7.@@ 3 , the highest level since the end of 1999 .
ho@@ ward ar@@ cher , chief econom@@ ist at i@@ h@@ s global insight , said : &quot; the best thing you can do for the department store manager index is to get the most out of august .
he added : &apos; eurozone producers are obviously finding life quite difficult at the moment , as the current hei@@ ghten@@ ed geo@@ political ten@@ sions - particularly in relation to russia and ukraine - are causing uncertainty in the still difficult conditions in many countries .
these increased un@@ certain@@ ties have clearly affected the economy - particularly , and consumer confidence , and probably will lead to some orders being dela@@ yed or even cancelled , particularly large orders .
he said that it would be &apos; ever more likely &apos; that the ecb would eventually have to launch a kind of q@@ e &apos; although we susp@@ ect that this will be limited &apos; .
the hel@@ len@@ ic decade of bes@@ lan survi@@ v@@ ors : ten years have passed since the terrible sie@@ ge of the school , as the children who were involved are still suffering .
ten years ago , over 1 000 people were killed by chec@@ hen mil@@ i@@ ti@@ as in a school in bes@@ lan in southern russia .
more than 3@@ 30 people , more than half of them children , were killed in the three-@@ day mar@@ ty@@ r@@ dom that sho@@ c@@ ked the world .
we have returned to bes@@ lan to find some of the victims who died at the ab@@ om@@ ination in class .
exactly a decade after the app@@ alling sie@@ ge of the bes@@ lan school , which killed 3@@ 34 people , including 18@@ 6 children , the her@@ o@@ ic survi@@ v@@ ors war@@ ned of a new apo@@ cal@@ y@@ sis last night in ukraine .
as fan@@ a@@ tical islam@@ ist terrorists , children and parents on 1 september 2004 , the start of a new school year , were cap@@ tured and killed , it seemed like the worst of evil .
the tragedy un@@ iting west and east in ab@@ hor@@ rence , and then turned surpris@@ ingly into action and hope for the future in the mid@@ st of the worst mis@@ ery .
ten years later , we returned to bes@@ lan to find some of the victims who died at the ab@@ om@@ ination in class .
we found surprising young people who have overcome resistance , although the memory of this terrorist hel@@ l has been watching them fore@@ ver .
your greatest hope ?
the fact that the war that is now affecting ukraine - and in which children like them die - is now coming to an end .
the girl who was photograph@@ ed in an attempt to go into the sh@@ at@@ tered school gym was not allowed to clim@@ b back into the sh@@ at@@ tered school gym .
it was created by russian star photograph@@ er di@@ mit@@ ri beli@@ ak@@ ov and famous when she was only active in under@@ wear to get into the tor@@ n school sport hall .
a@@ id@@ a was looking for her mother lar@@ is@@ sa , now 40 years old .
both were considered dead , but they survi@@ ved .
&quot; a woman told me i should run for my life , but i could not , &quot; said a@@ id@@ a then .
my leg@@ s were bloo@@ d@@ sh@@ ed .
i stood up and clim@@ bed back into to look for my mother .
a soldi@@ er brought them into security .
after a series of operations , she thought she was completely heal@@ ed , but said yesterday : &quot; three months ago , the pain returned .
i fear that i have to be operated again .
some p@@ ome@@ gran@@ ate sh@@ ards are still in my k@@ ne@@ es .
your goal is to become a d@@ enti@@ st to help people as your doctor has helped you .
&quot; this tragedy changed my life , but it did not break me , &quot; she says camp@@ a@@ ur@@ us@@ ti@@ g .
&quot; that happened to me , and that is something that cannot be changed .
once a year i always go to the sports hall to remember those who stayed there .
my friends and i try not to talk about it on other days .
the pain is too great .
my best friend and future class@@ m@@ ate d@@ zer@@ a ga@@ po@@ eva was killed there .
we played together when we were small , dre@@ aming of going to school together .
&quot; i don &apos;t want to mar@@ ry until i finish my studies and start my career .
i am thinking of a family later .
she says that the sie@@ ge will always remain a part of it , even though the memory becomes a little weak@@ er every year .
i am glad that many people around the world still remember our hor@@ r@@ ors and we are so grateful for the help we receive from people in the uk and everywhere .
when i see the photo of me online how to go back to school , i think that many people will see it for the first time , understand our disaster and help to prevent this happening again .
the boy who f@@ led through the ball ha@@ il , in the opinion that his mother was dead , was killed .
it was his first day of school ( rus@@ sians go to school at the age of 7 ) and survi@@ ved the three-@@ day sie@@ ge in the arms of his mother tam@@ ara .
as a se@@ ven@@ -@@ year old , he said : &apos; m@@ ama told me i should lie down if there were an explo@@ sion and hold your hand &apos; .
after an explo@@ sion he thought she would die .
she said to him : &apos; run . &apos;
fear that it could be dead , he f@@ led and saw a cr@@ ying inf@@ ant on the way , se@@ ized it by hand , and f@@ led through a ball ha@@ il .
his father v@@ la@@ di@@ mir , who had his son in the arms outside , said : &apos; dam@@ ir told me that his mother had died .
he said : &apos; i could not save them &apos; .
in reality , tam@@ ara was st@@ um@@ bling outside and in@@ jur@@ ies in the hospital , for its part , assum@@ ing that its son had died .
after re@@ unification , she said : &apos; i we@@ pt with joy .
i could not believe it .
he ran in and hu@@ gged me .
dam@@ ir was later flo@@ wn to london ( news of the world ) , which was dis@@ solved in the meantime , to receive a response from former premier ton@@ y bla@@ ir and his wife ch@@ eri@@ e to a bar@@ nar@@ do &apos;s children .
&quot; this hor@@ ror follows you every day , but i wish i could stop re@@ member@@ ing , &quot; he said yesterday .
but i can say that it is getting pal@@ er in my memory .
i know that i will be able to remove all my to@@ y gun immediately afterwards .
but now i can play computer games with shot scenes and that is no problem for me .
&quot; i am not afraid to go back to the sports hall , but i don &apos;t think about myself .
i remember those children with whom i played in the court and who did not manage to go outside .
we never say that they have been killed or are dead .
we say that they have stayed in the sports hall .
i remember very well my trip to london , especially to the to@@ y store where i made a choice of everything i wanted to do and made the trip in an open car .
but now he is afraid of places like ukraine , where wars cause the kind of mis@@ fortun@@ e he and his friends suffered .
this hor@@ ror follows you every day , but i wish i could stop remin@@ ding me .
&quot; i am so sorry for all those who suffer from the ab@@ om@@ inations , &quot; said dam@@ ir , who was volunte@@ er in a monaster@@ y last week .
i am so happy to help .
one day i want to go to the police and hope that you will be able to take me to the school academy next year .
his mother tam@@ ara , 48 , said : &quot; 37 children from our neighbourhood were killed , you can imagine ?
i remember the terrible silence that followed the sie@@ ge , there were simply no children who sh@@ ou@@ ted and could walk around , and this silence las@@ ted many months .
she vi@@ vi@@ dly remin@@ ds her trip to london with dam@@ ir .
the people of london we@@ pt when i told our story .
i understood then how people on the other side of the world could understand our feel@@ ings and show their support .
she was grateful to ch@@ eri@@ e bla@@ ir and her foundation for the prize and the opportunity to travel to london in the autumn of 2004 .
i wish i could call ch@@ eri@@ e and simply tell her that 10 years have passed , but i still remember the meeting with her and her hus@@ band in london , and how that dam@@ ir and me helped .
i remember that dam@@ ir would like to eat bor@@ sch@@ ch and that she would call on all local russian restaurants .
i remember he was working with wai@@ ter in a restaurant , and dam@@ ir was sho@@ oting his water gun on her and running the way and playing with him .
and that was just one month after the hor@@ ror .
i was surprised that the british were so willing to share our pain and support us .
she said : &quot; i always think that this world has not improved in these 10 years .
in ukraine , the war is now continuing , and people are dying every day , and i believe that many children have been killed and are still being killed .
these are just as children as ours .
i think that for many , war is part of the news they hear when they are bo@@ red or pre@@ occupied with something else .
i simply know what these people feel , all the hor@@ ror .
and i can not stop feeling that .
nothing has changed , people still want to kill each other , and that is so sad .
dam@@ ir became big and is a very gent@@ le and quiet boy , he is not at all aggres@@ sive or an@@ gr@@ y .
for example , he is not seeking reven@@ ge , he is not overwhel@@ med by the past ab@@ om@@ inations .
i know that he does not like to remember it , but he has six close friends from the class and they occa@@ sion@@ ally go to the sports hall and ign@@ ite there c@@ and@@ les .
when he was smaller , he suffered - i remember how he sometimes referred to the sof@@ a , the face was turned away from us , for hours .
not sle@@ eping , his eyes were open .
i also remember how he used all his weapons and other military to@@ ys , and dam@@ ir is now 17 , larger than i am , in good looking , intelligent and healthy ways .
i can hardly believe that i was so sure for a few hours that he was dead and i would never see him again .
when i reco@@ vered after the explo@@ sion and came to my feet , i looked around and saw the hel@@ l around me , with all around the body parts .
i was absolutely sure that my little boy was unable to survive in this hel@@ l .
&quot; i remember that i told him , &quot; dam@@ ir , run , run away &quot; , but i was also so sure that he did not hear me .
but he heard it and he went away .
and thus life , unlike that of many others , goes on for us .
geor@@ gi@@ j il@@ y@@ in 17
the boy whose terrible image has become the symbol of the ab@@ om@@ inations of bes@@ lan after the sie@@ ge , the ab@@ om@@ ination of bes@@ lan was made symbol of the ab@@ om@@ inations .
con@@ sol@@ ation : the bes@@ lan survi@@ v@@ or geor@@ gi@@ j ly@@ in with his mother fa@@ tim@@ a after the sie@@ ge in 2004 , right a picture of geor@@ gi@@ j today is a picture of geor@@ gi@@ j today .
his bloo@@ d@@ sh@@ ed was characterized by fear when he ran for his life , while chec@@ hen terrorists had his class camer@@ am@@ en sho@@ ok .
his image was one of the most sho@@ cking symb@@ ols of bes@@ lan &apos;s bar@@ bar@@ ity .
his mother fa@@ tim@@ a , 54 , a doctor , had de@@ posed him for his first day of school before rus@@ hing to protect her older son v@@ la@@ di@@ mir .
&quot; i left the court about two minutes before the terrorists stor@@ med him , and so my little boy remained there for three terrible days alone , &quot; she re@@ members .
not quite alone , there was a whole family of rela@@ tives of us , but they were all killed .
only my geor@@ gi@@ j managed to survive .
the closer this date is , the har@@ der it is to think about it and talk about it .
there is not a single day when we do not remember this tragedy .
we do not think it is a long time ago , i think it would have happened yesterday , some scenes from these days are watching me fore@@ ver .
no one will ever forget that , i promise you .
insi@@ st@@ ently : the image of geor@@ gi@@ j ( left ) was one of the most sho@@ cking of the attack and was perpe@@ tu@@ ated as a stat@@ ue ( right ) .
i remember that geor@@ gi@@ j was so keen to go to school on that day , saying he wanted to hu@@ g his teacher .
i knew he was alive when i was watching him on television .
and now there is even this stat@@ ue of the we@@ eping geor@@ gi@@ j in san mar@@ ino .
geor@@ gi@@ j does not like the picture , and it is at home in our book@@ shel@@ f .
i understand that , but i also think that , thanks to this image , people around the world feel our pain .
geor@@ gi@@ j says today : &quot; it is important that this never happens again .
&quot; i doubt that we will ever know the truth .
people are constantly investig@@ ating such trag@@ e@@ dies and never knowing the truth .
and now you investigate the cr@@ ash of this bo@@ eing in ukraine .
will we ever know what caused it ?
this world is becoming a terrible thing .
&quot; i cannot understand how this is possible , because if you ask people , no one wants a war , so how is it happening ?
ten years is nothing at all with such pain .
we need do@@ z@@ ens of years to forget it a little .
it has att@@ acked my health and i still feel it .
for about three or four years i had some night@@ ma@@ res for the sie@@ ge , but then it became better .
i went back to school later in 2004 and was afraid every day .
i thought of my friends and class@@ mates who had been killed .
that is why i always go to the sports hall when the 1st of september approaches .
i want to pay tribute to my old child@@ hood friends .
it is difficult for me to go to the sports hall , but i have to do it .
i do not feel a victim , this story is now part of my past .
i will not forget it , but i do not regret it .
my life is continuing .
i finished school this year and i am visiting a medical college in v@@ la@@ di@@ ka@@ w@@ ka@@ z .
i will become a car@@ di@@ ac sur@@ ge@@ on .
my first choice was an education in the army .
i wanted to become a soldi@@ er , but my health did not allow it .
i wanted to fight for my country , but that will not happen .
geor@@ gi@@ j f@@ ani@@ ye@@ v 20
the boy who survi@@ ved , although he was at the feet of a mur@@ der@@ ous terrorist , was not a man of war .
a mir@@ acle : geor@@ gi@@ j f@@ ani@@ ye@@ v was on the sie@@ ge to the feet of a mur@@ der@@ ous terrorist , but he managed to survive .
during the sie@@ ge , he was cap@@ tured in the sports hall and sat beside the bom@@ b that was at the foot of a mur@@ der@@ ous terrorist .
it is a real mir@@ acle that he was not killed .
&quot; we feel it was yesterday , &quot; says geor@@ gi@@ j , who was a secret service officer to the f@@ s@@ b , but this is because of his health damage due to the sie@@ ge .
it is still with me , it is not something i left behind .
i am now older and people say that children can easily cope with bad experiences - i must say that is not true .
&quot; in 2006 i worked with psycho@@ logi@@ sts and felt a little better after that , but i can not forget .
and i would like to forget .
2005 - in the year after - was the first and only time that i went back to the sports hall .
i lost consci@@ ousness .
i will never return to that place again and please do not ask me to show you where i sat in this famous picture .
survi@@ v@@ ors : geor@@ gi@@ j f@@ ani@@ ye@@ v today , with a photo of himself in hospital after the sie@@ ge on the lap@@ top .
my pain is mon@@ strous and i carry it with me every day .
my friends know that i do not like thinking about it or talking about it and they never asked me for school .
physi@@ cally , i am doing well .
i should be careful with my in@@ ju@@ red k@@ ne@@ e , but i can now run well .
but because of my health i could not attend the f@@ s@@ b ’ s intelligence academy in st. pe@@ ter@@ sburg as i wanted .
i have sent my documents , including the medical ones , and you have rep@@ lied that it is not possible .
my second passion was the animals , so i went to the ve@@ t institute .
i have been there for two years .
he lear@@ ns the treatment of all animals &quot; from c@@ ats to co@@ ws &quot; .
he said : &apos; i knew i never told my children about my experiences .
children should not be aware of this and they should not suffer it , of course .
his mother marina , 42 , said : &quot; this pain never leaves me .
it is in my soul , worse when the anniversary approaches .
i will go to the celebra@@ tions to comm@@ em@@ or@@ ate .
i know that geor@@ gi@@ y will not go .
it must be even more violent for him , because he was there and i was not .
i wa@@ ited at home for him and could not help .
i am so grateful to god that he has been returned to me , and here in bes@@ lan all of them are drawn .
it remains in us .
geor@@ gi@@ j is now an adult , but this hor@@ ror is still in him .
it is difficult to accept that if something so unfair is encoun@@ tered .
he is a boy , he li@@ kes sport , but he cannot participate because of his k@@ ne@@ es .
it has been operated several times , it can run but it can not do sport .
i would say that he has overcome 50 % of hor@@ ror , but you can never completely overcome it and forget it .
this terrible experience will always follow us .
many friends and neighbours were killed during the sie@@ ge , and that only rein@@ forces my pain .
i lost many people i knew well and who were expensive .
my son is with me , and this is the biggest gift that god could make me , but my heart cr@@ y for the killed .
i know of families where new children were born , but also of wi@@ do@@ ws who were never married again .
it is difficult to accept that life continues , even if you do not want it .
i will never forget how my heart jum@@ ped in me when i saw him in hospital .
and now i see what is happening in the world - wars in other regions .
what are these people fighting for ?
why are they killing each other ?
the war is now very close to our country and i almost cannot believe it .
we used to be a friendly country , how can we fight now ?
people and children suffer , i am sure that many children have already been killed in ukraine and many are still being killed .
if we only take all these re@@ be@@ ls and throw them out - as far as possible .

4 tips for better under@@ water photos and videos
if you would like to make photos or videos under water , there is a selection of devices available .
the che@@ apest option is a water@@ proof point and sho@@ ot , like the ni@@ kon cool@@ pi@@ x aw@@ 120 or an action sho@@ ot .
i took these photos at a family party with several cameras , all at a price of under $ 3@@ 50 .
regardless of the equipment , there are some rules for the best results .
check your equipment twice .
even if you have a water@@ proof camera , make sure that the battery com@@ part@@ ment and other com@@ part@@ ments are closed ti@@ gh@@ tly .
also put your camera on the photos or videos you want to record .
some cameras and cam@@ c@@ order have scene and recording modes that allow for the exposure time for the insul@@ ation of the under@@ water conditions .
and before you jum@@ p in , check to what depth your equipment is working .
some cameras are only allowed for up to 5 feet , others up to 50 or 60 feet .
search our shopping guide and review for digital cameras for conventional and water@@ proof models .
do multiple rec@@ ord@@ ings - because many will not fall .
poin@@ t-@@ and-@@ sho@@ ot cameras have an l@@ cd to comp@@ ile images with , ac@@ tion@@ -@@ c@@ am usually not .
even if you have an l@@ cd , it is difficult to see this under water , and the correct image setting is a fortun@@ e .
so you take a lot of pictures .
if your camera has a row mode that allows you to capture a series of pictures with slightly changed exposure settings , use it .
stay close to the surface .
the worse the light , the further you move away from the surface .
if possible , they stay close to the surface when sho@@ oting in a pool , a lake or the sea .
this will also allow you to add more color to your photos ; the de@@ eper you go , the less color you will see .
go close to the objects .
this is also a good advice on land , but it is all the more important in the light of the poor light conditions .
it is particularly important to have an action c@@ am : these devices often have a fixed wide@@ -@@ angle lens , which means that they can be ti@@ ghter to your objects .
andre@@ w law@@ son was a man of the sort whose character changed things , even in such a gi@@ gan@@ tic organization as the n@@ h@@ s .
as a consult@@ ant an@@ aes@@ the@@ ti@@ st , he devoted his career to the task of providing the si@@ ck with both ag@@ ony of the disease and pain of treatment .
among his patients , his wife re@@ members , was a mi@@ 6 employee who was familiar with the dev@@ ast@@ ating effects of torture .
law@@ son knew that doctors had to be given the diagno@@ sis and disease , while the treated were mostly treated with something quite different : pain .
one day in 2007 , however , he was the one whose path of suffering began .
&quot; i didn &apos;t feel , &quot; he wrote in may this year .
i had difficulty getting up .
while he is fighting with the symp@@ t@@ oms of fl@@ u , he re@@ marked that he was im@@ patient in acc@@ using his wife ju@@ li@@ et .
&quot; i want to do everything immediately rather than later , &quot; he noted .
when ju@@ li@@ et was on a business trip for a week , law@@ son felt un@@ usually and un@@ reason@@ ably wor@@ ried .
something was in the air .
he asked a colleague to carry out an x-@@ ray examination of his bre@@ ast .
only two weeks ago he was a ski run@@ ner in the french alps .
the result of the x-@@ ray inspection was available .
he suffered from mes@@ o@@ the@@ li@@ om , an incur@@ able cancer that could destroy the ch@@ est co@@ at , that is , the skin that over@@ dra@@ ws the lun@@ gs .
as with most can@@ c@@ ers , the exact tri@@ gger is usually difficult to determine .
for example , while some smo@@ kers suffer from l@@ ung cancer , not all l@@ ung cancer suff@@ e@@ rers used to smo@@ ke .
but mes@@ o@@ the@@ li@@ om is different .
in almost all cases , the tri@@ gger is an as@@ be@@ sto@@ s load - contact with the fi@@ bre which was once considered a &quot; mir@@ acle &quot; but has now been recognized as le@@ th@@ al .
for most of us mes@@ o@@ the@@ li@@ om is a disease that can easily ignore .
as@@ be@@ sto@@ s is , after all , a product of the past .
the most dangerous type of as@@ be@@ sto@@ s has not been used in britain since the 196@@ 0s , when industry volun@@ tar@@ ily committed itself to no longer using it .
even where it was still used , only people in certain sectors worked directly with the fab@@ ric - pl@@ um@@ bers , construction workers , car@@ pen@@ ters and shi@@ py@@ ard workers , for example .
as an industrial hazar@@ dous material from another era , it seems hardly worrying today .
but this com@@ plac@@ ency is in@@ appropriate .
britain , it seems , is today experiencing the cul@@ min@@ ation of a mes@@ o@@ the@@ li@@ om ep@@ ide@@ mic .
there are more deaths from mes@@ o@@ the@@ li@@ om here than in any other country in the world .
with a total of 2,@@ 500 deaths per year , twice as many people die of this disease as road accidents .
annual figures for mes@@ o@@ the@@ li@@ um deaths since 1980 and likely future deaths in the uk are expected to be in the uk .
the reason we are now experiencing the le@@ th@@ al effects , even though as@@ be@@ sto@@ s has been illegal for years ( in 1999 all types of as@@ be@@ sto@@ s were banned ) is that a mes@@ o@@ the@@ li@@ om only develops after decades .
and the s@@ cour@@ ge of mes@@ o@@ the@@ li@@ om is not con@@ fined to former construction workers .
as@@ be@@ sto@@ s was , and is still often , present in the houses where we live , the offices in which we work , the schools where we learn and the shops in which we shop .
and therefore mes@@ o@@ the@@ li@@ om knows no class barriers , financial limits , profes@@ sions or age .
the privileged bas@@ tions , surrounded by the elegant department stores in london and private schools , are not a shel@@ ter .
parliament &apos;s buildings are contam@@ inated by as@@ be@@ sto@@ s .
in the hospit@@ als where we are supposed to be healthy , we are already starting from this dead@@ ly car@@ cin@@ og@@ ens .
andre@@ w law@@ son was not old .
he was not a pl@@ um@@ ber either .
he was in fact hard to imagine where he could possibly be in contact with as@@ be@@ sto@@ s .
then he found it out .
&quot; it looks as though the tun@@ nels at gu@@ y &apos;s hospital , where i have spent six years in my training , are a lot of as@@ be@@ sto@@ s . &quot;
all - students , nur@@ ses , doctors and pat@@ r@@ ons - use the tun@@ nels .
one won@@ ders how many of my fellow citizens will suffer from the same disease ?
unfortunately , he was able to answer at least part of that question .
&quot; of the four doctors who attended gu@@ y &apos;s hospital , and the four doctors who have been working in mes@@ o@@ the@@ li@@ om for the last five years , &quot; he wrote in a letter in 2010 , &quot; am i the one ?
how many of us will suffer ?
in the case of andre@@ w law@@ son , mes@@ o@@ the@@ li@@ om was diagno@@ sed at the age of 48 .
when he died on 17 february this year , he was 55 .
this was an un@@ usually long period of survival .
fif@@ ty percent of mes@@ o@@ the@@ li@@ um diseases die within 8 months of diagno@@ sis .
the disease always ends in death .
we can therefore only repeat law@@ son &apos;s question : &apos; how many of us will be affected ? &apos;
britain ’ s leading expert on mes@@ o@@ the@@ li@@ om , professor ju@@ lian pe@@ to , assum@@ es that between 18@@ 70 and 20@@ 50 , when as@@ be@@ sto@@ s inf@@ ection is expected to st@@ all in britain , a total of 9@@ 0,000 will .
most of them have no idea that they will die in this way .
an as@@ be@@ sto@@ s mine in que@@ be@@ c , canada al@@ am@@ y
a quick look at the files of the courts , to which the persons concerned often turn for claims for damages , shows how far the s@@ cour@@ ge of the mes@@ o@@ the@@ li@@ om is already pre@@ valent .
in june of this year , marks &amp; sp@@ enc@@ er , for example , ad@@ mitted that jan@@ ice had been neglig@@ ently exposed to as@@ be@@ sto@@ s .
she worked for nine years for the chain , from 197@@ 8 to 198@@ 7 and was responsible for the clothing department at two locations - one of them the flag@@ ship store in ox@@ ford street .
m@@ r@@ s. allen was only 18 years when she started her activity at m &amp; s .
now she has two children in the tw@@ en@@ ties .
&quot; before this thing , &quot; she says , &quot; i had never heard of mes@@ o@@ the@@ li@@ om , i did not even know anything about as@@ be@@ sto@@ s .
i never thought that would affect me .
there are few people who know a lot about as@@ be@@ sto@@ s .
the fact is that the term as@@ be@@ sto@@ s is not a substance but a group of six min@@ er@@ als .
the name deri@@ ves from the word &quot; as@@ be@@ sto@@ ti@@ form &quot; , a description of the fi@@ bre structure that makes the fab@@ ric resistant and flexible .
three of the six were used in the construction industry .
ch@@ ry@@ so@@ tile , also known as white as@@ be@@ sto@@ s , is by far the most common as@@ be@@ sto@@ s found in buildings .
it was designed for roof panels , floor panels , pi@@ pe insul@@ ation , bo@@ il@@ ers insul@@ ation , even for bra@@ king co@@ ver@@ ings in cars .
it is less le@@ th@@ al than other forms of as@@ be@@ sto@@ s , but is still described by the eu and the who as a &apos; major health risk &apos; with possible death .
however , the brown as@@ be@@ sto@@ s ( am@@ os@@ ite ) and the blue as@@ be@@ sto@@ s ( k@@ ro@@ ky@@ do@@ lit@@ h ) are more dangerous .
britain was once the world ’ s largest im@@ porter of brown as@@ be@@ sto@@ s , and experts susp@@ ect that &apos; there are clear but indirect indic@@ ations that this is a major reason for the uni@@ qu@@ ely high mes@@ o@@ the@@ li@@ um rates &apos; .
a mark &amp; sp@@ enc@@ er employee was born in the flag@@ ship store on ox@@ ford street , london , as@@ be@@ sto@@ s exposed al@@ am@@ y to al@@ am@@ y .
jan@@ ice allen may not have proven to be a typical mes@@ o@@ the@@ li@@ om@@ op@@ per , but the work of ju@@ lian pe@@ to suggests that her story is not unusual .
he has presented a study of the people concerned , which states that &apos; a significant proportion of mes@@ o@@ the@@ li@@ omas can be found in as@@ be@@ sto@@ s in the environment without any known suspension from work or in the house &apos; .
he says that a large proportion of these contacts are based on the &apos; normal use and ag@@ eing &apos; of our buildings .
it looks as if no one can assume that they are safe .
a report by go@@ d@@ d@@ ard consulting , which describes the palace of west@@ min@@ ster , shows how people can live in the heart of the government , un@@ kno@@ w@@ ingly , as a result of the substance .
in 2009 , go@@ d@@ d@@ ard reported that service sha@@ fts and pi@@ pes were being built behind parliament &apos;s committee rooms with as@@ be@@ sto@@ s , whose dead@@ ly fi@@ b@@ res were replaced by something as harm@@ less as &quot; strong air movements &quot; .
members of parliament are often accused of looking after their own interests , but it seems that there is no such thing as the opposite .
while the parliamentary labour director@@ ate insi@@ sted that the west@@ min@@ ster palace should be a &apos; clean health certificate &apos; , it is now un@@ dispu@@ ted that eur 1 billion of work has gone into the works over several years .
the go@@ d@@ d@@ ard report also pointed out that &apos; the presence of as@@ be@@ sto@@ s cannot be managed in accordance with the relevant provisions &apos; .
no one can know whether this mis@@ management will cost lives .
all that can be done is wait .
a person who never had the ability to determine contact with as@@ be@@ sto@@ s is gra@@ ham ab@@ bot@@ t , a general practi@@ tion@@ er .
as andre@@ w law@@ son suggests , 50 year old ab@@ bot@@ t susp@@ ects that he would be exposed to as@@ be@@ sto@@ s while working in hospit@@ als .
&quot; i worked in a hospital where as@@ be@@ sto@@ s complaints were decided posi@@ tively , &quot; he says , &quot; but i can not prove it in my case .
it is so difficult to remember all the places where people have worked and the data .
what he still re@@ members is the day in early december 2009 , when he was given a kind of fe@@ ver .
he was 45 , and just late in the evening he carried out an operation .
suddenly i had ch@@ ills .
it came all of a su@@ dden .
i felt terrible .
i thought that the journey home was no longer possible .
as a doctor , ab@@ bot@@ t knew that the pain from the ch@@ est fur , the skin around his lun@@ gs had sti@@ r@@ red .
but , like jan@@ ice all , he had no reason to susp@@ ect a mes@@ o@@ the@@ li@@ om .
he did not go to work for a month .
the doctors were ast@@ on@@ ished by taking x-@@ ray pictures of his bre@@ ast and using ple@@ ur@@ ak@@ ath@@ ther to remove flu@@ id from the lun@@ gs and test it in the laboratory .
his complaints , however , remained without diagno@@ sis .
his health improved slowly , and he returned to his job .
from time to time , however , symp@@ t@@ oms have returned , often after exercise and intense bre@@ a@@ thing .
in 2011 , a patient came to ab@@ bot@@ t with similar symp@@ t@@ oms in his practice and was diagno@@ sed later with mes@@ o@@ the@@ li@@ om .
but ab@@ bot@@ t did not associ@@ ate this with his own case .
after all , his patient was a few decades older and had worked directly with as@@ be@@ sto@@ s .
the link in that case was clear .
in september 2011 , ab@@ bot@@ t ’ s condition deterior@@ ated , and his family doctor introduced his c@@ t sc@@ ans and x-@@ ray rec@@ ord@@ ings to a group of experts .
in december 2011 , exactly two years after ab@@ bot@@ t felt ill for the first time , a camera equipped son@@ de was inser@@ ted into the ca@@ ve between the ri@@ b and ch@@ est co@@ at .
i am an optim@@ ist .
i usually just continue , &quot; he says .
frank@@ ly , i had not been so concerned about so many things .
but rac@@ hel , my wife , was concerned .
the result of bi@@ op@@ sy was a year between christmas and new year &apos;s eve : &quot; i was told that it was mes@@ o@@ the@@ li@@ om . &quot;
gra@@ ham ab@@ bot@@ t : diagno@@ stic mes@@ o@@ the@@ li@@ om
suddenly , ab@@ bot@@ t had appoin@@ t@@ ments with mac@@ mill@@ an nur@@ ses , one of whom advis@@ ed him to seek a law@@ yer .
only now did he see the extent of the ep@@ ide@@ mic .
&quot; it turned out that as@@ be@@ sto@@ s was very widespread , especially in large public buildings where tu@@ bes are often isolated with as@@ be@@ sto@@ s , &quot; he says .
the people who were exposed to as@@ be@@ sto@@ s in these buildings are now suffering .
and thus , mes@@ o@@ the@@ li@@ om now h@@ its younger people who have not worked in the typical profes@@ sions .
the most dangerous tu@@ bes with as@@ be@@ sto@@ s soli@@ di@@ fication in hospit@@ als were below ground , so patients were probably not exposed to the substance .
but many employees who have been killed in pede@@ strian tun@@ nels from one building to another ( like andre@@ w law@@ son ) or in underground can@@ te@@ ens ( as it was gra@@ ham ab@@ bot@@ t often did ) have to be killed .
it is evident that , over several decades after the war , hospit@@ als may have saved patients life , but they are life@@ -@@ threat@@ ening for the tre@@ ating doctors .
it is still being removed today .
students put their bun@@ s on as@@ be@@ sto@@ s mat@@ s .
and it does not just concern hospit@@ als .
as@@ be@@ sto@@ s has been awarded the &quot; best &quot; quality award for its fab@@ ulous insul@@ ating and fl@@ am@@ e-@@ re@@ tar@@ dant properties .
schools , too , are involved .
indeed , many people may have had the first as@@ be@@ sto@@ s contact in the class@@ room .
everywhere in the country , in thousands of chem@@ i@@ stry lessons , students have their bun@@ s placed on as@@ be@@ sto@@ s mat@@ s .
the topic of as@@ be@@ sto@@ s in schools is now frequently addressed on websites .
meanwhile , inno@@ cent objects in our houses , such as floor panels or sc@@ al@@ p cu@@ ps , have as@@ be@@ sto@@ s by default .
&quot; it is an industrial po@@ ison that is contained in large parts of our real estate , &quot; notes andre@@ w mor@@ gan , the law@@ yer , the andre@@ w law@@ son in his trial against gu@@ y &apos;s hospital .
in one case , the only contact that struck an affected woman was the demo@@ lition of a sh@@ ed in the 197@@ 0s .
so watch out for the te@@ ar of your sh@@ ed .
the effects of diagno@@ sis , and the knowledge that the disease is incur@@ able , is immen@@ se .
&quot; it takes a while to process this , &quot; says gra@@ ham ab@@ bot@@ t .
i went back to work and tried to continue , but i realized that i did not concentrate on what i did .
i was in practice for two weeks .
then i knew i would go and take care of myself .
well , i will not be going to see another christmas .
the biggest difficulty was the change in perspective from a doctor &apos;s position to that of a patient .
like countless patients before him , he re@@ members how overwhel@@ med he was with all the information he was having to cope with .
&quot; it was very difficult to include all of this , &quot; he says .
&quot; i asked my doctor &quot; how long have i left ? &quot;
and they gave me about 12 months .
i remember that i thought &quot; well , i will not have another christmas .
that was &apos; s it . &apos;
mes@@ o@@ the@@ li@@ om is particularly insi@@ di@@ ous because it is our life@@ -@@ keeping mechanism - bre@@ a@@ thing itself - that causes the dead@@ ly cancer .
most cases of mes@@ o@@ the@@ li@@ om are caused by as@@ be@@ sto@@ s contact .
as@@ be@@ sto@@ s is made up of small@@ est fi@@ b@@ res .
if as@@ be@@ sto@@ s is ro@@ ta@@ ted and fi@@ b@@ res are in@@ hal@@ ed , they can be w@@ ound up in the ch@@ est co@@ at , the skin around the lun@@ gs .
as@@ be@@ sto@@ s fi@@ b@@ res ir@@ rit@@ ate the ch@@ est co@@ at and can cause cell mu@@ tations .
&quot; the problem ar@@ ises with the in@@ hal@@ ed con@@ i@@ fer@@ ous as@@ be@@ sto@@ s fi@@ b@@ res , &quot; says professor tom treas@@ ure , a heart thor@@ a@@ x doctor who passed to the gu@@ y &apos;s hospital in 2001 .
the hospital of andre@@ w law@@ son &apos;s susp@@ ici@@ on that he had been exposed to as@@ be@@ sto@@ s is now ir@@ on@@ ically a leading centre in the treatment of mes@@ o@@ the@@ li@@ om .
treas@@ ure knew law@@ son and treated some others who probably also had to be in hospital during their training .
once the as@@ be@@ sto@@ s nee@@ d@@ les reach the l@@ ung tissu@@ e , treas@@ ure says , &quot; they will be margin@@ alized by the bre@@ a@@ thing process where the skin is .
from the very beginning it is inv@@ a@@ sive .
the usual options for other can@@ c@@ ers do not work well in mes@@ o@@ the@@ li@@ om .
the effectiveness of an operation is , for example , highly controversial .
some people think it is worth trying .
treas@@ ure den@@ ies this .
&quot; you cannot cut the ch@@ est fur out , &quot; he says .
they do not get around with k@@ ni@@ fe .
meanwhile , cancer spe@@ aks &quot; on chem@@ other@@ ap@@ y not very well , &quot; the &quot; effect shows &quot; but does not cure .
&quot; sometimes there are long-@@ time survi@@ v@@ ors , &quot; says treas@@ ure .
but in the end they all die .
fortunately , some patients are actually living long , much longer than expected .
the author ste@@ ph@@ en j@@ ay g@@ ould died 20 years after the diagno@@ sis .
two and a half years after his own diagno@@ sis , gra@@ ham ab@@ bot@@ t is still fighting .
after cont@@ acting mes@@ o@@ the@@ li@@ om , ab@@ bot@@ t came into contact with andre@@ w law@@ son , who , four years after his diagno@@ sis , had developed a one-@@ man support and consulting office for people who had been affected .
&quot; hel@@ lo , cancer center , &quot; he stood che@@ er@@ fully on calls .
&quot; he was very positive , &quot; says ab@@ bot@@ t .
he had received his diagno@@ sis four years earlier and was still very active .
originally , ab@@ bot@@ t was offered six chem@@ other@@ ap@@ y cy@@ cles that las@@ ted four months and are expected to last for only one month .
&quot; i was desper@@ ate , &quot; he says .
i wanted to give up .
law@@ son , however , &quot; managed to do things in a more positive light &quot; .
after consulting several doctors , ab@@ bot@@ t decided to continue his treatment with prof@@ . lo@@ ic lan@@ g-@@ la@@ z@@ dun@@ ski , car@@ di@@ ac specialist at gu@@ y &apos;s .
&quot; we had an advantage because i had to be not re@@ directed , i just called and got a date , &quot; gra@@ ham ad@@ mits .
a normal patient would have to be given a re@@ ferr@@ al and wait for the treatment to be approved .
money is crucial to the patients with mes@@ o@@ the@@ li@@ om in order to be able to take the best available therap@@ ies .
but if these treatments inevitably fail , many people will be affected by a different financial concern - about the future of families they have left behind .
and so they turn to the courts in the hope of compensation .
andre@@ w law@@ son cont@@ acted andre@@ w mor@@ gan of field fish@@ er water@@ house ll@@ p .
&quot; it has been known since 18@@ 98 that as@@ be@@ sto@@ s is extremely dangerous to health , &quot; says mor@@ gan .
but what changed in the 196@@ 0s is that it was recognized that very small bur@@ dens were also a health risk .
and here , corporate neglig@@ ence began to play a role .
andre@@ w law@@ son and gu@@ y &apos;s hospital finally brought their case to light , but it was not what mor@@ gan called a &quot; full compensation . &quot;
after his death , a gu@@ y &apos;s spo@@ kes@@ man confirmed that &quot; as@@ be@@ sto@@ s fi@@ b@@ res in the cel@@ lar affected are not present in the 199@@ 0s . &quot;
this was too late for andre@@ w law@@ son .
how to remove as@@ be@@ sto@@ s
indeed , it is a very difficult time for mes@@ o@@ the@@ li@@ om suff@@ e@@ rers who seek compensation to solve an enormous problem , the dead@@ ly contact between as@@ be@@ sto@@ s and a work@@ place - usually decades after the incident .
many of their former employers have been sold or closed .
insurance documents may be lost .
and those who oppose claims know that the time is for them , but certainly not with the pla@@ in@@ ti@@ ffs .
in response , there have been clear new legislation this year that will make it easier for people affected by mes@@ o@@ the@@ li@@ om to claim compensation , even though their former employers are no longer found .
the law has a fund spon@@ so@@ red by the insurance industry of £ 3@@ 50 million for all those diagno@@ sed after july 2012 , detec@@ ting contact with the insurance industry , but not being able to su@@ e anyone .
in such cases , the pla@@ in@@ ti@@ ffs receive 80 % of what a court would have been able to grant them in a normal compensation process - about £ 1@@ 20@@ ,000 .
about 300 successful applications are expected per year .
andre@@ w mor@@ gan thin@@ ks like so many mes@@ o@@ the@@ li@@ om suff@@ e@@ rers that £ 3@@ 50 million is a &quot; very good job &quot; of the insurance industry .
&quot; this is a deal of insu@@ rers for insu@@ rers , &quot; he says , and suggests that this sum is a quarter of what the insu@@ rers would have to pay if the time was not running out .
mi@@ ke pen@@ ning , then minister of labour and pension , also ad@@ mitted that the law was &apos; not perfect &apos; .
but both pen@@ ning and mor@@ gan ad@@ mitted that , with seven deaths a day , rapid action is needed .
&quot; people are suffering so much and need help today , &quot; said pen@@ ning during the second hearing of the mes@@ o@@ the@@ li@@ om law in december last year .
at that time , gra@@ ham ab@@ bot@@ t has been in the hands of prof@@ . lo@@ ic lan@@ g-@@ la@@ z@@ dun@@ ski for 19 months .
after their first deliber@@ ations , lan@@ g-@@ la@@ z@@ dun@@ ski recommended an operation , which , unlike tom treas@@ ure , was expected to have a positive effect .
this was accompanied by radiation therapy and chem@@ other@@ ap@@ y - a three-@@ fold therapy that enables long-@@ lam@@ ination of the skin .
ab@@ bot@@ t felt stronger .
&quot; that &apos;s the most important thing , &quot; says ab@@ bot@@ t .
this is something that is seen time and again in patients .
there is something that allows you to continue .
if you give up , you will get worse .
gra@@ ham ab@@ bot@@ t under@@ went operation in march 2012 .
at the end of august he had the last of the six chem@@ other@@ ap@@ y cy@@ cles behind him .
after@@ -@@ care scan@@ ning showed no signs of the disease .
then i had a s@@ can in march 20@@ 14 .
there were several cancer spots around my ch@@ est .
i have just been 50 .
this is not life@@ -@@ threat@@ ening .
that is a life@@ -@@ long process .
ab@@ bot@@ t again under@@ went six chem@@ other@@ ap@@ y cy@@ cles .
now there is no tr@@ ace of t@@ um@@ ors .
but the process is physi@@ cally and psycho@@ log@@ ically very demanding .
they must think about practical things - about money if i am no longer , for example , or my wife , show how the bo@@ iler &apos;s time setting works .
if they receive bad news , they will be negative .
they must look forward .
as father of el@@ lie , 16 , and tam@@ s@@ in , 14 , this is not always easy .
&quot; for parents , this is difficult , &quot; he says .
it is difficult to know what to say and how much .
when i received my first diagno@@ sis , i told my girl that i had a disease that i would not be old with .
they respon@@ ded very differently .
tam@@ s@@ in is very soci@@ able and in@@ convenient .
she told her to her friends and we got a lot of calls soon .
el@@ lie was more re@@ luc@@ t@@ ant .
she did not say much .
such talks are something that all cancer patients must go through .
but for mes@@ o@@ the@@ li@@ o@@ logic agents , such talks are not conducted with hope , not with a tr@@ ace of hope for survival .
the disease ( as in the end also for ste@@ ph@@ en j@@ ay g@@ ould ) provides gri@@ m security .
as andre@@ w mor@@ gan says , &quot; mes@@ o@@ the@@ li@@ om is not life@@ -@@ threat@@ ening .

china ref@@ uses hong kong to have the right to vote in government , demonstr@@ ators swe@@ ar in re@@ tali@@ ation , and prote@@ sters swe@@ ar in re@@ tali@@ ation .
on sunday , despite the increasing calls for democratic reforms , the chinese parliament decided against nom@@ in@@ ating candidates for the 20@@ 17 elections by the hong kong elec@@ tor@@ ate .
this is probably the reason for the long-@@ announced pro@@ tests in hong kong ’ s business district , while activi@@ sts are making planning and mobili@@ zing for it within hours of the announcement .
the decision of the chinese people ’ s congress basically allows communist leaders to dis@@ miss all non-@@ pe@@ king@@ -@@ loy@@ al candidates .
&quot; this is not un@@ expected , but it makes us an@@ gr@@ y , &quot; said legal expert em@@ ily la@@ u , chairman of the democratic party .
that is not what beijing had promised .
the people of hong kong have been bl@@ amed .
and it is clear that we are dealing with an author@@ itarian regime .
in defending china ’ s decision , li fe@@ i , depu@@ ty secre@@ tar@@ y-@@ general of the standing committee of the national people ’ s congress , said that allowing public nom@@ inations in hong kong ’ s election would be a “ cha@@ otic ” government .
since 1997 , when britain had reg@@ a@@ ined control of hong kong , beijing has promised to protect its inhabitants from 20@@ 17 .
china ’ s leaders presented sunday ’ s decision as a democratic break@@ through , because they offered hong kong citizens a direct right to vote , but the decision also shows that china ’ s leaders need to keep a close watch on the process through a beijing mini@@ ster@@ ial hand .
under a new clause , only candidates are to be nom@@ inated &quot; with love for the country and love for hong kong &quot; .
the decision follows a summer in which some of the largest and most effective pro@@ tests in hong kong have been held for several years .
behind the pro-@@ democratic campaign in hong kong is the occup@@ y central movement with love and peace , whose organiz@@ ers have been threatened with losing the financial district .
on sunday evening , within a few hours of the announcement , hundreds of occup@@ y-@@ centr@@ al-@@ app@@ end@@ ices in the rain had been thro@@ wn out in front of the hong kong government headquarters .
at the demonstration , the organiz@@ ers said that their movement would create a new level of civil dis@@ o@@ be@@ di@@ ence , and that they would plan protest waves in the coming weeks .
they did not provide any further details , apparently in order to avoid problems with the authorities .
in an online communication the organiz@@ ers announced that the movement &quot; the occupation of the central district is only considered as a last means to be an action that can only take place if all dialogue opportunities are exhaus@@ ted .
we are sorry to say that today all the opportunities for dialogue have been exhaus@@ ted and that the occupation of the central district will definitely take place .
the hong kong authorities have agreed days ago on beijing &apos;s announcement and there were no more than four days before the government building .
the un@@ rest is caused by the feeling of many in hong kong that they are slowly losing control of their city .
the influ@@ x of people from main@@ land increases competition for products and services .
there is also growing fear that hong kong &apos;s values of democracy and freedom of speech will be reduced to cr@@ um@@ bling under growing pressure from beijing .
some cri@@ tici@@ zed the occup@@ y-@@ centre movement ’ s demonstra@@ tions , because they had made business – the li@@ fel@@ ine of hong kong – dangerous .
&quot; the pro@@ tests that you talk about could cause great economic damage , depending on how many are involved and how long they last , &quot; said legal expert re@@ gin@@ e i@@ p , who has been the movement for a long time .
we do not want to raise fears that hong kong will get out of control .
this impression is bad for investment .
china ’ s state@@ -@@ controlled media recently reported about democracy activi@@ sts in hong kong as being “ ho@@ sti@@ le to democracy ” by western powers .
this summer , activi@@ sts organised an un@@ official referendum on the electoral rights , involving 7@@ 8@@ 0,000 people - more than a fifth of the hong kong elec@@ tor@@ ate .
in july , tens of thousands of people took part in one of the largest democratic demonstra@@ tions in the region ’ s history .

to achieve a particularly impressive appearance at the university , the company also offers transport options such as private aircraft , roll@@ s-@@ roy@@ ce ph@@ an@@ tom , ast@@ on mar@@ ten or m@@ cla@@ ren p@@ 1 .
mr ste@@ w@@ art also stated that the service has a security section .
this service is an ideal alternative for students who would otherwise have their habit@@ ats in a danger@@ ously over@@ loaded car to take the country .
together with our new vi@@ f-@@ options , we look forward to ensuring that students reach the university with a minimum of effort and maximum of knowledge of luxury this year .
one company spo@@ kes@@ man said that no new book@@ ings have been made , as the service has just been introduced , but added that &quot; students can use the service in the coming weeks &quot; .
the company also announced that despite the tu@@ ition fees it has a market for this offer of £ 9@@ ,000 per year .
students today differ greatly in their expectations and demands from students 10 , 20 , 30 or 40 years ago - it is more important than ever to make a great first impression , and with vi@@ f you can do exactly that .
the national student union , however , cri@@ tici@@ zed the service as being removed .
me@@ gan dun@@ n , vice president of the n@@ us for higher education said : &quot; this offer seems to be completely separate from the life of the majority of students .
many students who begin stu@@ dying this month face a crisis in living costs , as the available financial assistance is available in the form of loans and grants not compatible with the shar@@ p@@ ly rising b@@ ills for the simpl@@ est live@@ li@@ ho@@ ods .
fem@@ ini@@ sts cri@@ tici@@ ze r@@ aci@@ al and police behavior after fer@@ g@@ us@@ on
the un@@ armed te@@ en@@ ager was killed by a police officer in fer@@ g@@ us@@ on , mo , earlier this month .
the participants raised their hands in the air and san@@ g , &quot; hands up , not sho@@ ot , &quot; while they wa@@ ited before the fun@@ eral .
after two weeks of pro@@ tests in fer@@ g@@ us@@ on , mo , because of the sho@@ oting of the un@@ armed te@@ en@@ ager michael brown , the blo@@ gger mi@@ ri@@ am zo@@ il@@ a pe@@ re@@ z noticed a change in the way .
according to their experience , white fem@@ in@@ ist comm@@ ent@@ ators put gender before race when it comes to re@@ productive law and income inequality .
but , while ten@@ sions in the middle west increased and received attention throughout the country , pe@@ re@@ z saw that the responses of white women turned 100 % around the race .
compared to the responses black women shortly after the sho@@ ts of 9 august , the personal es@@ says with tit@@ les such as &quot; thoughts to fer@@ g@@ us@@ on of a white woman &quot; and &quot; fem@@ in@@ ism is not just about the female propor@@ tional question .
but for pe@@ re@@ z , this meant an important change .
&quot; i do not think that fem@@ in@@ ism can find many people who are above the knowledge and who have privile@@ ges in such a high-@@ class way , &quot; she said .
people felt comp@@ elled to comment on the inci@@ dents .
it is characteristic of the crisis we are in and because the situation in fer@@ g@@ us@@ on is so eth@@ n@@ ically that you have to express that .
for english professor k@@ ori@@ th@@ a mit@@ ch@@ ell of the o@@ hi@@ o state university , fer@@ g@@ us@@ on highlighted problems that black americans had to face every day , but that are not considered &apos; women &apos;s issues &apos; .
&quot; i can do something fun@@ ny on fac@@ e@@ book about me and my partner and get 150 li@@ kes from everywhere , &quot; said mit@@ ch@@ ell .
if i post something about how col@@ oured people are under sie@@ ge in their own country , the silence is an@@ a@@ them@@ a .
&quot; how can it be safe for women to talk publicly about a relationship , but not about security in public space ? &quot; she asked .
for black women like mit@@ ch@@ ell , race , sex and sex@@ u@@ ality in us history , there are no di@@ al@@ ects .
for them , black women did not have the luxury of cle@@ aring up the issues ; they live in combined reality every day .
while white women now discuss race and gender in fem@@ in@@ ist main@@ stream cir@@ cles , ang@@ ela hat@@ ter@@ y says , professor of gender and gender , &quot; women are the women &apos;s and women &apos;s science at george mas@@ on university .
&quot; between 18@@ 65 and 18@@ 90 , at least 10@@ ,000 black men were killed and the ra@@ pe of a white woman , &quot; said h@@ at@@ tery .
white women had to be involved in history to justify the ly@@ n@@ ch murder .
for h@@ at@@ tery , the division between white and black women came at the point where white figh@@ ters fought for women ’ s voting rights like sus@@ an b@@ . an@@ th@@ ony in the late 19@@ th-@@ century , analy@@ zed , and re@@ viewed the country .
&quot; they decided to op@@ t for women &apos;s voting rights and to use the right to vote for black people later , &quot; said h@@ at@@ tery .
when you remember such things , you are aware with power why colour@@ ful women do not trust white women .
we did not do our job well .
we have never helped black women to protect their hus@@ bands and s@@ ons .
even after women were given the right to vote in 19@@ 20 , it took another decade for white women to resi@@ st the ly@@ n@@ ch in the association of southern woman for the presti@@ ge .
the group was created almost 40 years after the original request for help from black women , says mit@@ ch@@ ell .
for mit@@ ch@@ ell , the flo@@ od of white fem@@ in@@ ist re@@ actions to the issues raised by fer@@ g@@ us@@ on - police behaviour , r@@ aci@@ al discrimination - is a mirror of the time when white fem@@ ini@@ sts are cat@@ ching &quot; .
&quot; would it not be great if the activi@@ sts who have been using such traditional fem@@ in@@ ist platforms had the right to educ@@ ate a child as seriously as they did with the right to be recep@@ tive ? &quot;
secon@@ d-@@ generation fem@@ ini@@ sts who have lost their care@@ ers in the fight for re@@ productive rights and access to contrac@@ ep@@ tive means are now trying to understand what that means .
the famous white fem@@ in@@ ist acti@@ vis@@ t gl@@ oria ste@@ iner went to the united states two weeks after the sho@@ oting of michael brown on fac@@ e@@ book and published a poin@@ ted article by re@@ bec@@ ca car@@ roll , a magazine published .
&quot; i hope that women who have another but parallel reason to use one in@@ he@@ rent in the body can understand - and opinions on the race , which are expressed in public opinion po@@ lls - will not see the changes .
although ste@@ iner is considered to be a rather inter@@ sec@@ tional fem@@ in@@ ism , where r@@ aci@@ al and gender issues are addressed , some of her comments on r@@ aci@@ al issues in america are ast@@ on@@ ishing .
christ@@ ina som@@ mers , resear@@ cher at the american enterprise institute and author of &quot; who st@@ o@@ le fem@@ in@@ ism ? &quot; said she the people , that young men in the united states , especially young farmers , are men , especially young in@@ ju@@ red .
there are now hundreds of special programmes for girls and young women , but almost nothing for bo@@ ys .
but when the white house recently launched a small program , my brother &apos;s ke@@ eper , to protect vulnerable young black and h@@ is@@ pan@@ ic men , there were an@@ gr@@ y re@@ actions from many fem@@ ini@@ sts who were in the middle of the night .
the police relations with the black community are not the only problem that has come to the fore of main@@ stream fem@@ in@@ ism .
after nearly 6@@ 3@@ ,000 un@@ accompanied min@@ ors were on the country ’ s sou@@ th@@ west border this year , the us border police also raised the issue of immigration reform – this time as a women ’ s issue .
andre@@ a mer@@ c@@ ado , co-@@ chairman of we bel@@ ong together , an organization that provides women with the means to reform immigration , said that a re@@ consideration of the issue would be an essential women &apos;s issue .
&quot; they speak for themselves , &quot; said mer@@ c@@ ado .
if the vast majority of working vis@@ as go to male immigrants , the women who ac@@ company them are in a position where they are responsible for domestic violence and exploitation .
&quot; these stories are found in women &apos;s organisations in a sustainable way , &quot; she said .
&quot; pi@@ g@@ gy house &quot; in ip@@ sw@@ ich is for sale in the uk .
the image of a house for sale was removed by property bro@@ kers when it became clear that it showed a big pi@@ g that made it comfortable in the living room .
the de@@ t@@ ached house has one bedroom , is located on a private road in ip@@ sw@@ ich and is offered for 1@@ 20@@ ,000 £ .
details included a picture of the living room - which also includes a pi@@ g , that had his head on a sof@@ a bed .
real estate agents conn@@ ell@@ s said that the pi@@ g on the photo was the owner &apos;s pet .
&quot; the photo was published in error and has now been removed &quot; said a spo@@ kes@@ woman of the company .
in the exposure of the house , conn@@ ell@@ s described the former assembly house as a &quot; unique one-@@ family house with one bedroom &quot; .
although the bro@@ ker has removed the image from the website , it still appears on advertising material .
the house sale has attrac@@ ted interest in the social media when some asked whether the pi@@ g was included in the purchase price .
the town of s@@ w har@@ ve@@ y has a new mil@@ li@@ on@@ air@@ e after lo@@ t@@ tery win .
a har@@ ve@@ y lo@@ t@@ tery player is on the move this month .
the search for a new mil@@ li@@ on@@ air@@ e in the sou@@ th@@ west of per@@ th continues , with a happy winner who has been drawn from the lo@@ t@@ tery on saturday almost $ 1.@@ 1 million .
a newspaper ki@@ os@@ k in har@@ ve@@ y attrac@@ ted the jack@@ pot in the drawing for the second time in five years , after 1 million $ in november 2009 .
the lu@@ cky winner will have to report .
the sho@@ p@@ ke@@ eper ste@@ ve forward said that the profit provides for the talk in the small town in the sou@@ th@@ west of per@@ th .
the city talks about nothing else , and all are quite ex@@ ci@@ ted .
we thought that such a gain could come .
eight wa winners made pri@@ zes in the first division last month , a quali@@ fying deal for a few happy weeks for the players in the state .
last week , a player from can@@ ning val@@ e was one of the five mil@@ li@@ on@@ ai@@ res in august , after a couple from bel@@ mon@@ t just a few weeks earlier had achieved the me@@ ga gain of $ 7.@@ 5 million .
the winning couple had been playing for twenty years and said that the profit allows them the possibility of a world trip and the purchase of a new house .
the mil@@ li@@ on@@ air@@ e from har@@ ve@@ y is the 5@@ 9@@ th winner of the first division in the wa this year , with a total of almost $ 85 million .
leon@@ id@@ as asked the gla@@ di@@ at@@ ore arena for a visit to the city of gl@@ ad@@ es@@ h .
not only the gla@@ di@@ ators were standing an@@ k@@ le deep in the mat@@ sch at the first r@@ hin@@ eb@@ ach@@ er r@@ ö@@ mer@@ tag in the am@@ us@@ ement park .
but the attr@@ action of the event was strong enough to attract more than 1000 visitors yesterday who were able to see the ra@@ in@@ sho@@ wers and the autumn cold and to feel the historical spectac@@ le .
there was a color@@ ful series of representa@@ tions , performances , games , exhi@@ bits and information about the times of the roman@@ s and their importance to the r@@ hin@@ eland .
the main attr@@ action of the day was undoubtedly the mar@@ ti@@ alistic figh@@ ter force from the gla@@ di@@ ator school &quot; am@@ or mor@@ tis &quot; , which had every ra@@ in@@ break to play in the soft sand .
gla@@ di@@ ator owner &quot; leon@@ id@@ as &quot; proved to be a hum@@ or@@ ous and expert pres@@ enter and sent one after another his men to the ring of her@@ o@@ ic double fight in various gla@@ di@@ ator en@@ sem@@ b@@ les .
first , the &quot; pro@@ voca@@ te@@ urs &quot; were on the row with rec@@ tan@@ gu@@ lar shi@@ eld and short s@@ word as well as le@@ g rail on the left le@@ g and arm@@ rail on the right arm .
the es@@ se@@ d@@ ari@@ i followed with a bre@@ ast shi@@ eld , short s@@ word and a lit@@ ter l@@ ance and iron gla@@ di@@ ator hel@@ met , le@@ g and arm protection .
the appearance of the &quot; re@@ ti@@ ari@@ us &quot; , which was made with a network of thro@@ ats , tri@@ z@@ ack and dol@@ ch against the &quot; sec@@ ut@@ or &quot; , was particularly impressive and after a short fight the bo@@ ys came to the ground .
the s@@ words are me@@ tal@@ lic , the shi@@ el@@ ds of she@@ ph@@ er@@ ds and the lit@@ ter lan@@ ces fle@@ w through the arena that a fear and ban@@ g would be able to be around the health of gla@@ at@@ orial people .
but on them had the imposing &quot; sum@@ ma ru@@ d@@ is &quot; , the mus@@ cu@@ lar re@@ fe@@ ree , a constantly atten@@ tive eye .
&quot; we wanted to revi@@ ve the everyday life of rome and experience the culture of the roman era , &quot; explains lo@@ ren@@ z e@@ us@@ kir@@ chen , chairman of the organiz@@ er &quot; fre@@ un@@ desk@@ re@@ is r@@ ö@@ ten@@ tion r@@ ö@@ ten@@ channel &quot; , the channel .
after two years of preparation , the theme park was turned into a &quot; op@@ pi@@ dum roman@@ um &quot; , a roman city , as vice may@@ or cla@@ us we@@ h@@ age in his gre@@ e@@ ting .
after all , the roman@@ s have not only brought war and con@@ quest in our region , but also the roman culture and numerous buildings that we adm@@ ire today .
the remains of these were also to be ad@@ mi@@ red at the roman day , such as &quot; aqu@@ educ@@ t mar@@ ble &quot; from the ele@@ ven meter high and 14@@ 00 meter long roman canal bridge , which was used by lu@@ f@@ tel@@ berg .
the fron@@ tin@@ us society once and now confron@@ ted the water and energy supply , and ceo pe@@ tra fr@@ ic@@ ke knew : &quot; we are still taking advantage of the knowledge of those days &quot; .
this is confirmed by diplom@@ -@@ surve@@ ying engine@@ er r@@ alp@@ h he@@ ili@@ ger from the &quot; team team two engineers &quot; from rhe@@ in@@ bach , the tools of surve@@ ying the roman@@ s such as ch@@ or@@ ob@@ at , gro@@ ma or di@@ op@@ tra .
the roman villa in blan@@ ken@@ heim presented s@@ ket@@ ches and models from the exc@@ av@@ ations of an@@ no 18@@ 94 and br@@ ick stones from the original hypo@@ cau@@ tious , the hot air he@@ iz@@ er , which once used to heat the m@@ r@@ ö@@ te .
the foot@@ prin@@ ts that were taken by wol@@ f and fox two mill@@ en@@ nia ago in the foot@@ steps of cla@@ y were impressive , before they were bur@@ ned .
in 2011 , the land@@ es@@ ver@@ band rhe@@ in@@ land office for the conservation of the land@@ es@@ ver@@ band r@@ hin@@ eland had issued the remains of a roman villa in the north industrial park in rhe@@ in@@ bach .
the walls of an economic building with a dar@@ re were used to dry gra@@ in and to m@@ ill .
the building probably had to be a villa rus@@ tic@@ a , an agricultural estate , explained the archae@@ o@@ log@@ ist dr. j@@ enni@@ fer mor@@ sch@@ is@@ er .
a number of finds from these exc@@ av@@ ations dep@@ ic@@ ted them in a glass cab@@ in@@ et , including a large plate , several fine glass vessels and parts of a small nec@@ kl@@ ace .
the villa was probably built from the first to the fourth century ad , until the arrival of german@@ s in the then roman r@@ hin@@ eland , mor@@ sch@@ is@@ er susp@@ ects .
it also involved the children with the roman wind@@ m@@ ill game , similar to today &apos;s m@@ ill game , or they wrote the same as the roman students used to write their names with wa@@ x metal hand@@ les .
at the stand of the r@@ ö@@ mer@@ ther@@ men z@@ ü@@ l@@ p@@ ich , the children were allowed to lay mo@@ sa@@ ics themselves , at the stand of the glass museum rhe@@ in@@ bach glass mo@@ sa@@ ics and to build a new building at the ei@@ fe@@ l we@@ iz@@ h@@ le we@@ iz@@ m@@ ü@@ h@@ le we@@ iz@@ en@@ heim .
the ch@@ ill of the original , drawn by two col@@ d-@@ bl@@ ü@@ t@@ ters , was re@@ produced in the same way , and visitors were able to travel through the am@@ us@@ ement park and also pass the impressive bo@@ oth of the city gy@@ m@@ na@@ si@@ um &quot; .
the roman@@ s ’ week , which will take place from 13@@ th to 21st september , will also take place in the r@@ hin@@ el@@ and-@@ wide r@@ hin@@ el@@ and-@@ pal@@ at@@ in@@ ate in 20@@ 14 , which is to remind of the death of emper@@ or au@@ gu@@ st@@ us 2000 .
together with the local and historical associations and the w@@ ach@@ t@@ berg hiking association , the association of partners and the entertainment society of the am@@ ate@@ ur ob@@ er@@ b@@ ac@@ he@@ m , them@@ atic hi@@ kes , lec@@ tures , cooking even@@ ings and other activities are offered .
for example , a roman legi@@ on@@ na@@ ire is exemp@@ ted from his work on the nearby w@@ ach@@ t@@ berg , tre@@ ating plants as living monuments from the roman era and teaching a wit@@ ty lesson in international understanding .
the ad@@ endor@@ f primary school is dedicated to the roman theme as part of a project week .
the roman@@ s &apos; week is intended to bring together the numerous , but often no longer visible , trac@@ es of the roman@@ s in w@@ ach@@ t@@ berg .

e@@ bol@@ a : the ep@@ ide@@ mic is bur@@ d@@ ening west africa ’ s economy
the e@@ bol@@ a ep@@ ide@@ mic in west africa is also a serious b@@ low to the economy .
markets are or@@ ph@@ an@@ ed - and international companies are di@@ stan@@ cing themselves .
the dev@@ ast@@ ating e@@ bol@@ a ep@@ ide@@ mic is causing a serious b@@ low to the economy of west africa .
the har@@ v@@ est is ro@@ tting in the fields that are abandoned and the markets are or@@ ph@@ an@@ ed - the virus has seriously inf@@ lic@@ ted on the region .
some international companies are already moving away .
&quot; the e@@ bol@@ a ep@@ ide@@ mic is not only a medical crisis , but also an economic one , &quot; the head of the african development bank , don@@ ald k@@ ab@@ er@@ u@@ ka , jud@@ ges .
liber@@ ia is hard@@ est hit
&quot; it is a total disaster , we are losing a great deal of money , &quot; says al@@ ha@@ ji b@@ am@@ o@@ go , who is on the second largest market in liber@@ ia &apos;s capital , mon@@ ro@@ via clothing .
only those who produce food or dis@@ inf@@ ection with e@@ bol@@ a will come onto the market .
liber@@ ia has been hit hard@@ est by the virus , alone here has fallen the fe@@ ver more than 600 people .
recently , health authorities declared that the disease had pen@@ etr@@ ated every corner of the country .
in gu@@ ine@@ a , sier@@ ra le@@ one and ni@@ geria , the virus has spread .
in total , more than 15@@ 00 people died , thousands more died .
foreign companies are recru@@ iting employees from abroad
throughout res@@ our@@ ce-@@ rich countries , firms are running out .
foreign companies such as the steel group ar@@ cel@@ or mit@@ tal are with@@ drawing their employees , several international airlines are no longer flying to the affected regions .
local deal@@ ers and farmers also respond : few merchan@@ ts still leave their homes to buy supplies .
in some areas of sier@@ ra le@@ one and liber@@ ia , which are under@@ going quar@@ ant@@ ine , the costs of export of c@@ aca@@ o and coffee are becoming ext@@ inc@@ t on the fields , among other things .
farmers d@@ are not d@@ are to leave their homes for har@@ ve@@ sting .
food is scar@@ ce ;
&quot; people will travel less and less &quot; , says phil@@ li@@ pe de v@@ re@@ yer , paris expert for west africa &apos;s economy .
for example , the man who normally goes to the market and sel@@ ls his vegetables remains at home .
the population therefore receives the consequences of the ep@@ ide@@ mic directly and urgently : food is becoming scar@@ ce .
in the markets , stocks of basic food@@ stuffs such as rice are d@@ wind@@ ling .
at the same time , the region heavily dependent on international firms is threat@@ ening to damage its image , with far-@@ reaching consequences .
the greatest danger is that international companies will , in principle , avoid the area for a long time , says phili@@ ppe hu@@ g@@ on of the french think tan@@ k ir@@ is .
the decisive factor is how far and how long the virus will spread .
investors might get the impression that &apos; it is dangerous to have a market in gu@@ ine@@ a , sier@@ ra le@@ one and liber@@ ia and thus to invest &apos; , hu@@ g@@ on war@@ ns .
the disease also bur@@ dens the har@@ d-@@ pressed state budgets of states
the disease also bur@@ dens the already har@@ d-@@ pressed state budgets of the states concerned .
the rating agency mo@@ o@@ dy &apos;s fears that its budgets will be heavily dependent on the high spending on the health system and , in addition , on the wor@@ sen@@ ing economy .
the african development bank has already promised to provide eur 60 million ( 45 million ) to the health systems of the countries concerned .
the effects are also being felt in ni@@ geria , where so far few e@@ bol@@ a cases have been diagno@@ sed .
although the o@@ il@@ -@@ rich region in the southern ni@@ ger del@@ ta has not yet been affected .
but elsewhere , many people are already left at home for fear of cont@@ ag@@ ion .
reservations in hotels are also falling shar@@ p@@ ly .
protect your 50@@ th anniversary celebr@@ ation
the swiss federation of the &quot; t@@ ann@@ en@@ wal@@ d &quot; bern@@ ga@@ u celebra@@ tes its 50@@ th anniversary from 12 to 14 september .
the sch@@ ü@@ t@@ ten@@ vere@@ in t@@ ann@@ en@@ wal@@ d is on top of the list of the preparations for the 50@@ -@@ year anniversary of the founding of the festival from 12 to 14 september .
the plan is to hold a big evening of entertainment with the group &quot; dor@@ fro@@ ck@@ er &quot; on friday , september 12 .
on saturday at 6 p.m. the big b@@ ö@@ ll@@ er@@ sho@@ oting is taking place .
the large party is followed by the &quot; sto@@ ap@@ fal@@ zer sp@@ it@@ z@@ bu@@ am &quot; .
br@@ as@@ k@@ ap@@ elle provides music and the music
highlights on sunday are the festival service and 9.@@ 30 am in the par@@ ish church and the large fe@@ ast at 2 pm .
in the afternoon , the distribution of the prize for the federal and ga@@ us@@ e-@@ sho@@ oting is also possible .
a particularly beautiful sight will be the 25 ladies with their dir@@ n@@ d@@ l@@ n .
the cha@@ pel is the br@@ as@@ c@@ ap@@ elle bern@@ ga@@ u .
the pat@@ ron@@ age has been given to may@@ or wol@@ f@@ gan@@ g wild and secretary of state al@@ bert fü@@ r@@ ack@@ er .
the original term &quot; sch@@ ü@@ tz@@ en@@ ges@@ ell@@ schaft t@@ ann@@ en@@ wal@@ d bern@@ ga@@ u &quot; dates from 19@@ 07 , when the association was invited to &quot; social entertainment by means of exercise in car@@ pen@@ try and small cali@@ ber sho@@ oting &quot; on march 21 .
the na@@ zi regime had led the dis@@ solution of the association in 19@@ 37 .
only in 196@@ 4 did 19 young men find themselves again , who on april 30 in the gu@@ es@@ thouse lu@@ k@@ as found the &quot; new &quot; sho@@ ot@@ ing-@@ club &quot; t@@ ann@@ en@@ wal@@ d &quot; bern@@ ga@@ u from b@@ ap@@ tism .
kar@@ l march and ad@@ ol@@ f ried lead the association as a protec@@ tor through a difficult early period in which it was primarily a matter of establishing a club and of supporting the sho@@ oting operation .
the sch@@ ü@@ tz@@ en@@ vere@@ in started its activities in the &quot; le@@ in@@ inger &quot; inn in autumn 196@@ 5 with two teams in the run@@ de competi@@ tions .
in the following years , the s@@ ni@@ p@@ ers , who were now organized in seven teams , established themselves in all classes , right up to the 1st gau@@ lig@@ a .
the club records are held every year and the mag@@ ical border of 3@@ 80 r@@ ings was first docum@@ ented by ru@@ di me@@ i@@ er in 1980 .
just as the performance of active sho@@ ot@@ ers has increased , the number of members has also improved .
after the club &apos;s &quot; le@@ in@@ inger &quot; no longer meets the demands of a modern sho@@ ot@@ ers club , the former board of directors has decided to re@@ new their efforts under the leadership of jo@@ han@@ n r@@ inn .
after a work of 27@@ 00 hours , g@@ ary granted a grant of € 5@@ ,@@ 00@@ 0,000 for the new protec@@ tive rooms on 8 may 198@@ 8 .
one of the great highlights in the history of the club was certainly the 4@@ 4th ga@@ us@@ ti@@ e@@ ß@@ en , combined with the sole@@ m@@ n con@@ sec@@ r@@ ation of the new sho@@ ot@@ ers &apos; flag in july 1991 .
on 23 and 24 april 1994 , the sho@@ o@@ ter association celebrated its 30@@ th anniversary .
in 1995 a group of b@@ ö@@ ll@@ ers was founded .
jo@@ se@@ f sch@@ mal@@ z@@ l was b@@ ö@@ ll@@ er@@ re@@ ber ’ s re@@ fe@@ ree .
a big challenge for the &quot; more b@@ ö@@ ll@@ ere &quot; and for the association as a whole was the orientation of the bav@@ arian b@@ ö@@ ll@@ er@@ tre@@ ff@@ en 2005 .
in many hours of volunte@@ ering , the club members last year set up the rooms and the sho@@ oting facility at the bern@@ ga@@ u hof , thus up@@ dating the latest state of the art .
ele@@ ven teams in roun@@ d@@ mat@@ ches
the sport performance of the sch@@ ü@@ tz@@ en@@ vere@@ in can also be seen .
al@@ together , ele@@ ven teams are currently compe@@ ting in the round competi@@ tions : six ri@@ f@@ le teams , one air gun team , one sports gun k@@ k@@ 1 , one youth and two ah@@ -@@ h teams .
the 1st team with lars ell@@ rich , k@@ ath@@ ar@@ ina ell@@ rich , ste@@ ff@@ i gra@@ d and ker@@ sti@@ n k@@ ell@@ er@@ mann was defe@@ ated by the gau@@ ob@@ er@@ lig@@ a in round 2013 / 14 ( highest league ) in the sch@@ ü@@ tz@@ eng@@ au .
the second team with ve@@ ren@@ a mo@@ os@@ bur@@ ger alex@@ and@@ ra me@@ i@@ er , eva sch@@ u@@ h@@ mann and to@@ bi@@ as gram@@ l was transferred from the gau@@ lig@@ a nor@@ d to the gau@@ ob@@ er@@ lig@@ a .
besides sho@@ oting , events such as bo@@ ck@@ -@@ b@@ alls , car@@ ni@@ val and royal ball , club ou@@ ting and christmas party have a long tradition .
the sho@@ ot@@ ers are also present at the festi@@ vals in par@@ ish and par@@ ish .
ton@@ y ste@@ w@@ art suff@@ ers accident when returning to the race track .
ton@@ y ste@@ war@@ t &apos;s return to the race track ended about half way through his race on the atlan@@ ta motor spe@@ ed@@ way .
ste@@ w@@ art was going against the wall for the second time after his right front ti@@ re bur@@ st into round 17@@ 2 and finished his evening .
ste@@ w@@ art dro@@ ve his damaged car into the garage and left it without talking to journalists .
his team leader ch@@ ad jo@@ hn@@ ston said his 1@@ 4-@@ member team was disappointed , concentrated on the new team and the team will be in rich@@ mon@@ d , vir@@ g@@ ini@@ a next weekend .
&quot; i wish we had a better commitment and a better result for him , &quot; jo@@ hn@@ ston said .
we are going to rich@@ mon@@ d and hope we can do better there .
ste@@ w@@ art already dro@@ ve earlier in the race on sunday evening after a col@@ li@@ sion with ky@@ le bus@@ ch into a wall and had to repair the right side of his car .
&quot; i have good hopes for a good result today , &quot; jo@@ hn@@ ston and added , &quot; i am not afraid .
not long after the second accident , ste@@ war@@ t &apos;s car was loaded into the tra@@ iler and the team had packed and ready to leave .
ste@@ w@@ art had three nas@@ car spr@@ int cup rac@@ es to finish after his car had taken another driver in an ash@@ tr@@ ay race in the north of the state of new york and killed .
he decided to return this week and to return either to atlan@@ ta or at the next race in rich@@ mon@@ d to find a place in the persecu@@ tion .
he returned to his job , while an investigation into the tragic incident that led to the death of k@@ ev@@ in ward j@@ r. was investig@@ ated , which had been on the road during a race to be ste@@ w@@ art .
on friday , the authorities announced that the investigation into the cause of the accident would continue for at least two weeks .
no decision has yet been taken as to whether ste@@ w@@ art should face charges .
the tri@@ ple champi@@ on was received with great applause when he was presented before the race .
after starting at 12@@ th position , ste@@ w@@ art had been in the first 10 shortly afterwards and was tempor@@ arily placed in fourth place .
after a re@@ start in round 12@@ 2 , bus@@ ch and his team moved to the top of the league in round 12@@ 2 , bus@@ ch and bus@@ ch hit the ball .
take no . 18 out of control after the exit from cur@@ ve 2 and col@@ li@@ ded with ste@@ w@@ art , both cars dro@@ ve against the wall .
ste@@ w@@ art continued , but fell to number 21 .
young d@@ anc@@ ers are looking for a new d@@ ancing talent .
just try out : la@@ ura , len@@ a , lis@@ a , mari@@ e , bet@@ t@@ ina , em@@ ma and director lis@@ a nit@@ z@@ el ( from left ) are looking forward to your fellow cont@@ enders .
like many other clubs , jazz groups are also the main focus of the full-@@ time classes at secondary schools .

bulg@@ arian prison guards are pro@@ testing nation@@ ally
hundreds of prison officers from all over bulgaria have been arrested before the ministry of justice in the capital city of so@@ fi@@ a .
in the peaceful demonstration , they repeated their demands for the restoration of their old working conditions , which have recently been changed .
even higher sal@@ aries are on a demand list that is compatible with the interim justice minister h@@ ris@@ to i@@ van@@ ov .
officials have been pro@@ testing symb@@ ol@@ ically against the new working hours for a month and are demanding a return to the former 24-hour shi@@ fts .

nato does not want to break agreements with russia
nato is being under@@ min@@ ed by the planned sta@@ tioning in eastern europe following the ukra@@ inian crisis .
nato secretary general and@@ ers fo@@ gh r@@ as@@ mus@@ sen said in brussels on monday that nato is following the nato &apos;s founding agreement of the 1997 nato russia council .
nato ’ s chief , however , accused russia of &quot; a gross breach &quot; of the agreement .
&quot; today we have to face up to reality that russia does not regard nato as a partner , &quot; r@@ as@@ mus@@ sen said .
documents and statements from the russian side suggest that &apos; you see us as oppon@@ ents &apos; .
stronger nato presence
r@@ as@@ mus@@ sen also announced that nato &apos;s presence in eastern europe would be strengthened .
one decision to be taken at the nato summit in wal@@ es on read@@ iness action plan will ensure that &apos; we have more visible nato presence in the east , as long as that is necessary &apos; , r@@ as@@ mus@@ sen said on monday .
ki@@ e@@ v and moscow are agreed on new gas talks
russia and ukraine have officially agreed to new talks to set@@ tle their gas dispute .
the negotiations are scheduled for next saturday , said russian energy minister alexander no@@ wa@@ k on monday .
there is still a wait for a decision by the european union to be taken by a representative to the talks .
because of the dispute over the gas price , ukraine has been getting no fuel from russia for weeks .
last but not least , eu energy commissioner g@@ ün@@ ther o@@ et@@ t@@ inger had medi@@ ated between both sides .
ukraine had war@@ ned that russia could also cut off gas supplies for europe .
europe is responsible for about one third of its gas coming from russian sources , much of which flows through ukraine .
mer@@ kel spe@@ aks of power : tol@@ l will come &quot; clearly &quot;
now the chancell@@ or is once again clearly committed to this .
a licence for all the complicated details is not .
persi@@ stent c@@ du mis@@ gi@@ v@@ ings about car tol@@ ls have been on the c@@ su ’ s side .
chancell@@ or ang@@ ela mer@@ kel has asked the council to withdraw from its c@@ du , following persi@@ stent resistance , a word of power , for the introduction of a tol@@ l on cars .
&quot; to put it quite clearly , it is in the coalition agreement and it will come , &quot; said the party leader on monday after meetings of the c@@ du top bodies in berlin .
mer@@ kel , however , did not commit to a detailed model for the time being .
the black@@ -@@ red government programme calls for &apos; specific parameters &apos; .
federal minister of transport alexander do@@ br@@ in@@ dt ( c@@ su ) has made a proposal and is now working on it &apos; .
the n@@ r@@ w-@@ c@@ du , however , insi@@ sts on its &apos; no &apos; to a tol@@ l equal to all roads .
mer@@ kel emphasi@@ zed that finance minister wol@@ f@@ gan@@ g sch@@ ä@@ u@@ ble ( c@@ du ) also contributed construc@@ tively to the deliber@@ ations on a bill .
beyond the issue , he has also talked with do@@ br@@ in@@ dt about other ways of enabling more private capital for infrastructure investment , for example in broad@@ band expansion .
&quot; there &apos;s nothing special about it &quot; .
c@@ su ch@@ ef hor@@ st see@@ ho@@ fer war@@ ned against being in the cab@@ in@@ et of tol@@ l concepts against the minister responsible .
c@@ du bun@@ des@@ vi@@ ze arm@@ in las@@ ch@@ et re@@ affir@@ med his objec@@ tions .
&quot; the coalition treaty never assumed that all county and federal roads would be char@@ tered , &quot; said the north r@@ hin@@ e-@@ west@@ ph@@ ali@@ an c@@ du country leader .
in this respect , it would be an important signal that sea ho@@ fer has now announced that it will be discussing the issue again .
resistance to the plans is also being expressed by the german federal government associations bad@@ en-@@ w@@ ür@@ t@@ tem@@ berg and r@@ hin@@ el@@ and-@@ pal@@ at@@ in@@ ate .
the background is fears that a tol@@ l would affect small border traffic to neighbouring countries .
the sea ho@@ fer had been forced to leave the c@@ du coalition fi@@ del@@ ity because of tol@@ l criticism .
the left sees the plans as weak@@ ened in the light of the dispute in the union .
&quot; the mur@@ k@@ s-@@ tol@@ l is dead , &quot; said party leader ber@@ nd ri@@ e@@ x@@ inger of the &quot; new os@@ n@@ ab@@ r@@ ü@@ ck@@ er ze@@ it@@ ung &quot; ( monday ) .
&quot; the minister &apos;s tol@@ l fails &quot; . do@@ br@@ in@@ dt wants to impose a vig@@ net@@ te duty on all german roads , which is due to start in 20@@ 16 .
domestic car owners , however , are not to be charged any additional charges under the coalition agreement .
therefore , they should be able to make full compensation for tol@@ ls through the car tax .
the model , however , must not discrimin@@ ate against foreign drivers on account of their nation@@ ality , in accordance with eu law .
genetic dis@@ order often mis@@ diagno@@ sed
a british says she thought she had been diagno@@ sed for many years as dying .
kar@@ in ro@@ d@@ gers lived almost all her youth in the belief that she only had a few years to live after diagno@@ sing another disease .
it was in fact suffering from the char@@ co@@ t mari@@ e to@@ oth disease ( c@@ mt ) - a group of in@@ h@@ eri@@ ted dis@@ orders that caused ner@@ ves outside the brain and sp@@ inal cor@@ d .
char@@ ity c@@ mt uk announced that mis@@ diagno@@ ses are a common problem for people with c@@ mt because so little is known about this disease .
some 23@@ ,000 people in britain are likely to suffer from c@@ mt , which can cause motor dis@@ orders such as mus@@ cle weak@@ ness , an un@@ certain course , and cr@@ um@@ b@@ led to@@ es .
suff@@ e@@ rers also suffer from tau@@ b@@ sen@@ ess or pain .
when ro@@ d@@ gers was 13 , she believed that she had been involved in fried@@ rich at@@ a@@ xi@@ e ( fa ) - a disease with very poor survival chan@@ ces .
ro@@ d@@ gers thought she would be in a whe@@ el@@ chair before she would be 18 , and die before her 30@@ th birth@@ day .
the mother of two children , who is 51 today , said : &quot; as a child i knew i could not do the same as the other .
i was constantly falling and everything took longer .
i could never have sco@@ red with other children roll@@ er sk@@ ate@@ board or roll@@ er sk@@ ate@@ board and was often in school because of my way to go and walk .
ro@@ d@@ gers said that at the age of 13 , after several operations to reli@@ eve their ach@@ ill@@ es and stre@@ tch their feet , they took on a medical mission when their doctor left the room and read that they had gone to the hospital .
&quot; i felt guil@@ ty because i was cur@@ ious , so i did not blame anyone .
when i received an answer , i was sho@@ c@@ ked and terri@@ bly pan@@ ic@@ ked .
i thought i was going to be in a whe@@ el@@ chair with 18 and die at 25 , and in between all my abilities would slowly lose .
i did all this with me alone and planned my own fun@@ eral .
she said when she became 17 , she realized that her skills had not decreas@@ ed as much as she had imag@@ ined and asked her doctor .
he stood up and hu@@ gged me and said , &quot; my love , i do not think you have that , otherwise you are already in a whe@@ el@@ chair . &quot;
i think you have something far less life@@ -@@ threat@@ ening .
after some genetic tests , c@@ mt was detec@@ ted .
&quot; when he explained to me what c@@ mt was , i felt as if i were a winner , &quot; she said .
char@@ ity c@@ mt uk has a c@@ m@@ t-@@ awareness month to work on this disease .
stab@@ s@@ fel@@ d@@ we@@ bel a. d. ber@@ ni di@@ e@@ ther has been working since the closure of the former tro@@ op training place as a fire@@ figh@@ ter since the closure of the former training place as a fire@@ figh@@ ter .
for almost ten years , the former military training center in m@@ ün@@ sing@@ en has been closed for sho@@ oting .
yet , every month , am@@ m@@ uni@@ tion still appears in the heart of the bio@@ sphere region sw@@ ab@@ ian al@@ b .
the g@@ ren@@ ades are sometimes so dangerous that they have to be blo@@ wn up on the ground .
an ear@@ -@@ stu@@ n boy is the perfect hal@@ lo@@ ween for the explo@@ sions over the heart of the bio@@ sphere .
in december 2004 , the last sharp shot on the tro@@ op training site of munich fell , which ended in 2005 after 1@@ 10 years of military operation .
since that time , the 6@@ 500 hec@@ tares of land has been the core of the sw@@ ab@@ ian bio@@ sphere region , which has been extended to 13 designated trails for hi@@ kers and cy@@ cli@@ sts .
tax burden on business people in the washington area increases with the economic recovery
economic recovery means more customers , more sales and new jobs .
it also means higher taxes .
government and local tax recei@@ p@@ ts for companies in the country increased slightly last year , while economic recovery acceler@@ ated , according to a newly published study last week , and firms in the washington area were no exception .
companies in the district , mar@@ y@@ land and vir@@ g@@ ini@@ a have paid $ 27@@ ,@@ 6 billion to government and local authorities in the financial year 2013 , an increase of 3.@@ 8 percent over the 2012 revenue of $ 2@@ 6.@@ 6 billion .
the state and local tax burden of companies increased by 4.@@ 3 % last year to $ 6@@ 71 billion , compared to 3.@@ 9 % a year earlier , and it was the third con@@ secu@@ tive year of growth following the several years of de fac@@ to decline .
government taxes increased more than local taxes , by 4.@@ 3 % , according to the study published by the service agency .
more than half of the district ’ s tax revenues , 56 percent , are corporate taxes , while 36 percent of mar@@ y@@ land ’ s revenues come from businesses .
vir@@ g@@ ini@@ a gener@@ ates the lowest tax revenue from companies at 28 percent .
much of the increase in tax revenues is due to a recovery in corporate real estate values , say the researchers , which leads to an increase in property taxes of 3.@@ 7 % this year after the three succ@@ essive years of growth rates of 1 % with growth .
while much of these gains come from large states , such as california , new york , and tex@@ as , the process also appears to be true for the washington area .
companies in the district , mar@@ y@@ land and vir@@ g@@ ini@@ a jointly paid more than $ 10 billion in government and local property taxes last year , compared to $ 9.@@ 6 billion in 2012 – an increase of 4.@@ 2 % over the course of a year .
but the apparent recovery in property values is not so effective in mar@@ y@@ land in raising government and local tax revenues , as housing taxes are close to more than a fifth of the tax revenues of companies .
companies in vir@@ g@@ ini@@ a and d.@@ c. pay almost half of their state and local taxes in the form of property taxes .
&quot; in mar@@ y@@ land , the following happens : a large proportion of the real estate , especially in the tax area around the d.@@ c. , is owned either by the government or non-@@ profit organizations that do not pay property taxes , &quot; said dou@@ gl@@ as lin@@ d@@ m lin@@ d@@ holm .
mar@@ y@@ land is therefore forced to focus much more on income taxes , for example , in order to be able to provide the same services that other states offer .
the recent recovery in corporate tax revenues cannot be attribu@@ ted solely to the recovery of the housing market .
corporate revenues also seem to be reco@@ vering , according to data .
companies in the region reported income taxes to state organizations of $ 2.@@ 3 billion , compared to $ 2.@@ 1 billion in 2012 .
mar@@ y@@ land took $ 1 billion in corporate income taxes , the highest amount in the region .
while the trend is moving in the same direction , the local tax burden on companies is not increasing even@@ ly in all three places .
the district ’ s growth rate was 4.@@ 3 % , up from the national average , while mar@@ y@@ land ’ s rise was significantly higher , reaching 4.@@ 9 % .
only vir@@ g@@ ini@@ a reported an under@@ -@@ average tax revenue of 4.@@ 1 percent .
vir@@ g@@ ini@@ a has a significantly lower corporate income , accounting for 6 % in all three areas of government ( all three have firm corporate tax rates ) .
mar@@ y@@ land &apos;s corporate tax rate is 8.@@ 25 percent and the district is relatively high at 9.@@ 9@@ 75 percent .
a comparable study by the us chamber of commerce at the beginning of this year showed that lower government and local corporate taxes are required in vir@@ g@@ ini@@ a , and overall there is a better tax climate than in mar@@ y@@ land .
the study did not examine the district .
despite the advantages vir@@ g@@ ini@@ a is under pressure from its southern neighb@@ our .
north car@@ ol@@ ina has laws to reduce its corporate tax rates this year from 6.@@ 9 % to 6 % , the same rate as vir@@ g@@ ini@@ a , and the rate will rise to 5 % next year .
if the state continues to achieve its income targets in the coming year , this law could raise the state ’ s corporate income tax rate to 3 % by 20@@ 17 .
meanwhile , small businesses in the washington area seem to be doing better , and they therefore pay more state and local taxes , according to the recent study .
corporate taxes , which are paid as personal income taxes by small business@@ men - a transitional structure that organiz@@ es most small enterprises - in the district , mar@@ y@@ land , and vir@@ g@@ ini@@ a increased by 20 % last year by $ 2.@@ 4 billion , down .
researchers say that the trend and rise in corporate taxes is likely to be higher throughout the country this year , with an increase in the general revenue from the national and national multi-@@ defense taxes increasing by 6.@@ 2 % .
yet the washington area could la@@ g behind if the federal government ’ s spending cut had had an impact on the region ’ s labor market .
partner city : german beer for gu@@ ang@@ z@@ ho@@ u
ho@@ ps and mal@@ t - also a popular combination in china .
german beer has an excellent reputation in china .
frankfurt ’ s partner city in china now wants a bre@@ w@@ ery and also hopes for direct flight connections between the two cities .
german beer , bre@@ wed in frankfurt ’ s partner city of gu@@ ang@@ z@@ ho@@ u - that is the urgent wish of the officials in china .
&quot; we would be delighted if a german bre@@ w@@ ery would set@@ tle in our city , &quot; said the vice-@@ party secretary of the south china metro@@ polis , li yi@@ we@@ i , this week , when visiting a sp@@ d delegation .
time and again , the chinese communist party ’ s official came to this concern of the 12@@ -@@ million metr@@ e metro@@ polis during the con@@ vers@@ ation .
gu@@ ang@@ z@@ ho@@ u , also known as can@@ ton in germany , is one of china &apos;s rich@@ est cities , war@@ ned li .
that is why people also had the purchasing power to afford german beer .
the german socialist party , thor@@ ste@@ n sch@@ ä@@ fer@@ -@@ g@@ ü@@ m@@ bel , who led the german political delegation , has told the host that he will look for a possible partner for the project in germany .
&quot; for beer , it doesn &apos;t take much : good water , gra@@ in and joy of life , &quot; he added at lunch with the party top in gu@@ ang@@ z@@ ho@@ u .
mr li is already ex@@ ci@@ ted about this joy of life , and he fl@@ at@@ ters the host .
the func@@ tion@@ alist from gu@@ ang@@ z@@ ho@@ u then came up with sch@@ ä@@ fer g@@ ü@@ m@@ bel - albeit with red wine , which was served to the food .
the chinese brand t@@ sing@@ ta@@ o is based on german bre@@ wing art .
t@@ sing@@ ta@@ o beer is produced according to the german pur@@ ity law .
more business
a second wish of china ’ s hosts would be a direct flight connection between frankfurt and gu@@ ang@@ z@@ ho@@ u , said vice party leader li .
lu@@ f@@ than@@ sa had offered the flight earlier , but in 2012 , for economic reasons , it was cancelled .
&quot; it would be worth it again , &quot; the local politici@@ an showed himself convinced .
&quot; business traffic between our two cities is growing . &quot;
currently , travellers would have to travel the way across chan@@ g@@ sh@@ a in hun@@ an province , li compla@@ ined .
the gu@@ ang@@ d@@ ong province &apos;s administration , the capital of which is gu@@ ang@@ z@@ ho@@ u , also hopes for the flight connection .
the vice-@@ govern@@ or of the province , chen y@@ un@@ xi@@ an , expressed this wish in his con@@ vers@@ ation with the social democrats .
&quot; this is a very good idea , &quot; said sch@@ ä@@ fer@@ -@@ gu@@ m@@ bel - chinese vice minister li j@@ in@@ ju@@ n , an in@@ timate german expert , no@@ d@@ ded in agreement .
well-@@ maintained partnership
the li@@ k@@ ened vice-@@ leader of gu@@ ang@@ z@@ ho@@ u hopes that he will be able to make frankfurt a partnership meeting next year .
li yi@@ we@@ i was already in the main , but not yet in this function .
he came into office only this year after his pre@@ dec@@ essor was exp@@ elled from office for charges of corruption .
the local leader wan q@@ ing@@ lian had to go .
the action against gu@@ ang@@ z@@ ho@@ u officials is part of a nation@@ wide campaign against corruption in the party and administration , led by the leader of x@@ i j@@ in@@ ping .
the new leader li yi@@ we@@ i had argu@@ ed for an american company before his party career , which is highly unusual in the chinese communist party .
before taking office in gu@@ ang@@ z@@ ho@@ u , he was a leading official in fu@@ j@@ ian , where the car manufacturer v@@ w had built a large factory .
frankfurt is officially more than a do@@ zen town@@ -@@ tw@@ in@@ ning partnerships .
the connection to the 9@@ 000 km distance of gu@@ ang@@ z@@ ho@@ u is one of those who are maintained by both sides , for example with a student exchange .
last year , the 2@@ 5-@@ year anniversary of the german@@ -@@ chinese connection was celebrated .
the south china metro@@ polis on the per@@ l river is almost as strong as the whole of h@@ ess@@ en with its economic power .
next year , it intends to generate a gross domestic product of eur 250 billion , li reported .

amaz@@ on bu@@ ys t@@ wit@@ ch for $ 1.@@ 04 billion
amaz@@ on just confirmed what information had reported on monday morning : the online re@@ tail@@ er - and video producer , and a lot of other things - bu@@ ys the video stre@@ aming service t@@ wit@@ ch for $ 1.@@ 04 billion ( $ 9@@ 70 billion ) .
the announcement comes as a surprise , not because no one expected to take t@@ wit@@ ch , but because it was widely believed that you@@ tube would acquire the company .
three months ago , it seemed that selling t@@ wit@@ ch to the google video service for a cool billion was decided .
t@@ wit@@ ch , who only three years ago was founded as ju@@ st@@ in@@ .@@ tv , was launched as a general stre@@ aming service - a live version of you@@ tube .
instead , it quickly became a platform for players who released their bra@@ v@@ ura pieces in games , a &quot; you@@ tube for live games &quot; , so an in@@ sid@@ er .
the t@@ wit@@ ch interface .
and &quot; let &apos;s play &quot; , a video gen@@ re in which better knowledge can be used to play a paint of myster@@ y theory theatre .
it is the case that you@@ tube is often called when you describe t@@ wit@@ ch , so the message that you@@ tube is using t@@ wit@@ ch was written in the language .
it is a myster@@ y why the deal with you@@ tube did not come about , because the company was re@@ porte@@ dly ready to pay as much as amaz@@ on .
all we know about this at the moment is that statement by em@@ met she@@ ar , president of t@@ wit@@ ch : &quot; we have chosen amaz@@ on because you believe in our community , you share our values and long-term vision .
another myster@@ y , to be honest , is the incredible success of t@@ wit@@ ch .
for s@@ no@@ bs like me who explain that they prefer to do sports than watch it , it is difficult to understand the attr@@ action that assum@@ es to be watching others while playing , rather than even watching the con@@ sole .
it is one thing to tell a friend about his shoul@@ der at 3 a.m. while resid@@ ent evil sch@@ le@@ ic@@ ht , and something quite different , a sp@@ inner .
all these games you could watch right now .
another problem is that many of the most popular games are e@@ go games today , so watching can be done without having control of the perspective , a really good reci@@ pe for head@@ ache .
i admit that the rapid transit routes in which ro@@ ger ban@@ n@@ ister of our electronic age plays whole games in record time are not going to be enter@@ taining .
but until a game or hum@@ or virtu@@ os@@ is is included , its t@@ wit@@ ch channel is probably not so interesting .
but what do ske@@ p@@ tics like me know about it ?
t@@ wit@@ ch is called by 55 million different visitors per month and is the fourth largest source of internet traffic pe@@ aks .
and how exactly does amaz@@ on want to make money out of it ?
it is hard to imagine that t@@ wit@@ ch is so elegant in amaz@@ on inst@@ ant video , as you@@ tube t@@ wit@@ ch simply would have s@@ wal@@ low@@ ed .
but t@@ wit@@ ch has something every company would like : thousands of young men who adver@@ tise as advertising customers .
as the chairman of t@@ wit@@ ch , she@@ ar , said , amaz@@ on and t@@ wit@@ ch &quot; both believe in the future of gaming , &quot; and the medium shows no signs of shr@@ in@@ king , not even even - even if not .
at the h@@ ü@@ p@@ f@@ burg at the bur@@ g@@ gar@@ ten@@ fest , there was a lot of fun on saturday .
the organis@@ er ’ s concept was right .
despite the heavy rain casting on saturday evening , an estimated 1@@ 200 music fans came to the open-@@ air festival in the bur@@ g@@ gar@@ ten .
at times , the entrance had to be stopped .
&quot; that was an@@ no@@ ying , &quot; said ron se@@ m , one of the organiz@@ ers .
sal@@ we@@ del l light and fun .
ma@@ xi@@ m sa@@ x@@ ra@@ j and ron se@@ m have taken the name am@@ ula from two spanish words .
the open air in the sal@@ t@@ we@@ del@@ er bur@@ g@@ gar@@ ten is intended to provide a bright day and evening through various shows .
well , and the fun comes from your own .
this was evident early on saturday when the first visitors to the open air .
the organiz@@ ers promised a party for all generations .
and they have succeeded .
around the supply stands on the bur@@ g@@ gar@@ ten@@ wi@@ ese it had become sal@@ tw@@ ater , but also guests from the nearby and other surroundings .
they followed the first live performances , wi@@ ped with the foot in the clock , enjoyed cool drinks - in short : pure relaxation and enjoy@@ ment were the order of the day .
and the way through the generations .
while some people are sitting on the blan@@ kets on the extra car@@ ved white sand at the beach bar , others are enjoying a quarter of wine in the vin@@ o@@ the@@ que , the young were r@@ aging on the h@@ ü@@ p@@ f@@ burg .
but even when it comes to children &apos;s ma@@ k@@ eu@@ p , volunte@@ ers have had to do their best to meet the needs of the children and to get creative cre@@ ations into the small faces .
the larger ones used the k@@ ick@@ er tables or participated in a sk@@ ate@@ board workshop that the good@@ foot crew of sal@@ zu@@ fle@@ del arranged .
until the big rain came .
just before 5.@@ 30 p.m. he cr@@ acked down on the visitors , mainly families looking for the wide and dry .
but the attr@@ acti@@ veness of the festival did not break away .
&quot; more people came than expected , &quot; ron se@@ m said , who talks of a &quot; success all along the line &quot; .
that is why we are not in any way opposed to a repeat of the great party next year .
although the content and size of the event still have to be worked out , se@@ m made a first record of sunday in front of the popular vote .
he was an@@ no@@ ying to say that in the meantime the admission had to be stopped .
obviously , the security company had been booked with too little power .
the consequence : some who had already paid did not get on the ground .
the res@@ on@@ ance was very good .
in a first cau@@ tious es@@ timate , the sal@@ zu@@ fle@@ del@@ er co-@@ organiz@@ er spoke of about 1@@ 200 visitors who had their time in the castle garden .
there were problems with sound technology .
the sal@@ tw@@ ater hi@@ p hop band bloc@@ k@@ s@@ `@@ n@@ `@@ ro@@ x bro@@ ke their performance with ner@@ ve .
the techn@@ ici@@ ans were unable to produce a reason@@ ably reasonable sound .
the planned sh@@ ish@@ a loun@@ ges could not be built because the t@@ ents were not ready to go to sal@@ ve@@ del due to a ti@@ re p@@ an .
&quot; next year you will be there &quot; , says the organiz@@ er .
the premi@@ ere of the am@@ u@@ la@@ -@@ open-@@ air was more than successful from the number of visitors .
and that in bad weather .
however , the organis@@ ers made some mistakes which will be dela@@ yed the first time , but in the second edition they will have to be elimin@@ ated .
also in the social network fac@@ e@@ book the organiz@@ ers must include criticism .
&quot; sorry , but for twelve euros you just expected more , &quot; says mel@@ ani@@ e me@@ i@@ er on the event page .
&quot; you &apos;ve taken over a bit , &quot; says e@@ le zim@@ mer@@ mann in the same place .
others do not see the initial problems as closely as they were .
i think it is very good that some people are not just st@@ up@@ id , but are actually trying to put something on their feet .
hu@@ t off ! &quot; , ste@@ ph@@ ani@@ e jen@@ ß wri@@ tes to am@@ ula .
now the organis@@ ers have one year to clear up these critic@@ isms .
new rad@@ om in ber@@ k@@ um : w@@ ach@@ t@@ berg ’ s land@@ mark is shr@@ in@@ king .
that is not what we expect .
instead , the part is waiting to be put into the distinc@@ tive structure .
the action is in the context of a larger measure : almost 50 years after the establishment of the ti@@ ra space observation rad@@ ar , the cover , the so-called rad@@ om , is completely renewed .
the new rad@@ om is equipped with a di@@ ameter of 4@@ 7.@@ 5 meters a little smaller than the old one .
the size remains a world record , however .
the last step to complete the new cover is cap@@ ping sharing .
the upper quarter of the old h@@ ul@@ l is separated and taken with a cr@@ ane .
the last quarter of the new cover will be added .
if the weather is included , the action will take place at the beginning of this week .

a woman was brought to the hospital after she had been taken to the ice bu@@ cket challenge so much that she had to face the ja@@ w .
is@@ ab@@ elle ro@@ ber@@ ts from the uk made a com@@ e@@ back when her cold water was p@@ oured over her head , that she had to change her face structure .
&quot; the water was so cold that i sh@@ ou@@ ted , and while i did , my ja@@ w remained simply standing , &quot; she said to the mirror .

i wanted to close my mouth , but that did not go , the ja@@ w was ha@@ ted , and then i understood that something was wrong .
my mother and si@@ ster saw this as well and made lau@@ gh@@ ing almost into their p@@ ants , but i had to go into the emergency .
the 20@@ -@@ year-@@ old from britain was brought to the hospital to get the ja@@ w back after taking part in the vir@@ al trend on tuesday .

the castle clubs will soon be pul@@ ling together again ?
finally , there was a constant dispute between the two wol@@ fr@@ at@@ sha@@ us@@ en bur@@ g@@ vere@@ ines .
now the boards are thinking about possible cooperation .
as a model for the reconstruction of the wol@@ fr@@ at@@ sha@@ user castle , the late richard di@@ mb@@ ath , former chairman of the wol@@ fr@@ at@@ sha@@ user bur@@ g@@ fre@@ un@@ de , led the project in the french gu@@ é@@ del@@ on .
a year ago , the bur@@ g@@ vere@@ in and the friends of bur@@ gun@@ dy had no good climate .
the positions on how history of the wol@@ fr@@ at@@ sha@@ user castle and a possible reconstruction have seemed to be very different .
now the two camps are moving towards one another : talks are to be held soon on a common approach .
the association ’ s board of directors tor@@ ste@@ n s@@ j@@ ö@@ berg ( bur@@ g@@ vere@@ in ) and her@@ bert pi@@ ff@@ l ( friends of bur@@ gun@@ dy ) confirm this on the request of our newspaper .
&quot; i called mr pi@@ ff@@ l and suggested that we could sit down together once , &quot; says s@@ j@@ ö@@ berg .
he said that all members of both clubs could now be in the same ve@@ in again .
this is a quick and visible achievement .
while the friends of the castle are concerned about richard di@@ mb@@ ath , who died suddenly , until the very last reconstruction of the castle at the mountain forest , the castle club around s@@ j@@ ö@@ berg stands for &quot; the discovery and experience of the bar@@ ge &quot; .
her@@ bert pi@@ ff@@ l , second chairman of bur@@ g@@ fre@@ un@@ de , has been delighted with the call according to his own information .
since di@@ mb@@ ad &apos;s death , he has been a front for his friends in the castle .
a new chairman is to be found in a members &apos; meeting in mid-@@ september .
at the moment , according to the 7@@ 4-@@ year-@@ old , the association counts about 40 members .
&quot; after the death of my friend richard di@@ mb@@ ath , we have taken over the association &apos;s activities out of respect first &quot; , which &quot; period of reflection &quot; was necessary to &quot; consider &quot; how to proceed .
according to pi@@ ff@@ l , the new chairman is to enter into talks with the bur@@ g@@ vere@@ in .
until then , friends of the castle could also have a picture of the mo@@ od within their group .
there is not yet a candidate for the presidency , says pi@@ ff@@ l .
&quot; but i &apos;m confident that someone will find themselves &quot; , he does not want to stand for himself because he is resid@@ ent in bad t@@ ö@@ l@@ z .
the new leader should be a wol@@ fr@@ at@@ sha@@ user .
the t@@ ö@@ l@@ zer want to participate in the project &quot; but very happy to continue working &quot; .
the different positions on reconstruction are likely to be seen in pi@@ ff@@ ls in the near future .
he recogn@@ ises di@@ mb@@ ath as a mis@@ sion@@ ary who has always believed in the reconstruction of the castle .
two similar projects , already well advanced in austria and france , would show that this idea is not a pi@@ pe dream .
through a high level of participation by the population and volunte@@ ers from all over the world , they are a tourist mag@@ net .
pi@@ ff@@ l : &quot; i too was s@@ cep@@ tical at the beginning .
but over time i have become more and more convinced that it is useful to move the project forward &quot; , which could be a &quot; stand@@ -@@ alone &quot; feature for the flu@@ ff@@ y city .
there is nothing else .
moreover , the project would be supported by eu grants , visitor tickets and potential spon@@ sors , pi@@ ff@@ l believes .
&quot; i personally do not want to throw away the idea of reconstruction , &quot; he hopes that the bur@@ g@@ vere@@ in will perhaps move in this respect .
their goal of docum@@ enting history is important and good .
we could then look further .
cle@@ ver ways to save with university tex@@ t@@ books
since the cost of university tex@@ t@@ books for many students is more than $ 1@@ ,000 per year , the second sem@@ ester student has considered mat@@ t sch@@ ro@@ e@@ der a cle@@ ver sp@@ ari@@ de idea .
he inven@@ ted a lo@@ an system for books of higher sem@@ ester students and offered nom@@ inal compensation to help the res@@ ale .
&quot; my mathem@@ a@@ tics book usually costs $ 18@@ 0 , but i got it for $ 10 for a sem@@ ester and a ch@@ ick@@ -@@ fil@@ -@@ a-@@ ke@@ ks , &quot; said sch@@ ro@@ e@@ der , 19 , who put the co@@ ven@@ ant .
the books needed for the last sem@@ ester would have cost him $ 4@@ 30 , he said .
he gave $ 120 .
the college was informed that the students had more than 1,@@ 200 $ per year for tex@@ t@@ books and study material , and that they had no choice but to pay various costs for the students .
online shops and creative approaches such as the sch@@ ro@@ ed@@ ers are increasingly the solution for students .
the rental of tex@@ t@@ books is becoming more popular , and students can use a book for a sem@@ ester , often at a much cheaper price than buying .
ne@@ e@@ bo inc , which has more than 250 university book@@ shops , announced that the rental of text books is not a matter of doubt since 2011 .
po@@ lls in the industry show that about a quarter of books are published in college book@@ shops in the last spring sem@@ ester , said ne@@ e@@ bo@@ s vice president te@@ v@@ or me@@ yer .
less than half of all tex@@ t@@ books are published according to the trade association national association of college stores in camp@@ us book@@ shops .
here is the one-@@ time deal for the best deals .
buy online
some new books cost online only one-@@ third of the price you have at the camp@@ us book@@ shop .
the n@@ in@@ th issue of &quot; cal@@ cul@@ us &quot; v@@ no ron lar@@ won , bru@@ ce ed@@ wards and robert hoste@@ t@@ ler costs nearly $ 2@@ 90 , but can be ordered from the specialized tex@@ t@@ book re@@ tail@@ er , che@@ gg@@ .com .
used buy
if you need to read the notes of other or normal usage tracks , you can find used books as a good option .
&quot; cal@@ cul@@ us &quot; is used on che@@ gg@@ .com for $ 9@@ 3.@@ 49 .
mat@@ t cas@@ ag@@ ay , 25 , gradu@@ ate student at bri@@ g@@ ham young university , says that he is 42 cen@@ time@@ ters on amaz@@ on@@ .com for a used issue of &quot; strategic media dec@@ is &quot; .
the book was sold for $ 48 .
aca@@ dem@@ ics such as ing@@ rid br@@ ac@@ ey , head of the university of mass@@ ach@@ us@@ et@@ ts at am@@ her@@ st college without walls recommended students to study at their prof@@ ess@@ ors who are not familiar with past edi@@ tions .
sometimes the updates for the seminar work are not relevant .
in such cases , older expenses can often be spent for a fr@@ action of the cost of the latest issue .
apart from che@@ g@@ g and amaz@@ on , hal@@ f@@ .com is a popular alternative for used books .
rent a car , rent a car , rent a car , rent a car , rent a car , rent a car , rent a car , rent a car , rent a car , rent a car , rent a car , rent a car , ...
the rental of tex@@ t@@ books is worth considering if you can treat them fairly well , remember to return them and you can read the books after comple@@ ting the course .
you can pay more than 80 percent of the costs of a newly purchased book .
a student could , for example , &quot; cal@@ cul@@ us &quot; for a sem@@ ester of about $ 20 .
find out about the terms and conditions of the business you rent , including the penalty fees that may apply to writing notes , sub@@ missions , etc .
be@@ ware of ten@@ ants : if you do not return the book , the penalty fees may even exceed the price of a new book .
e-@@ books
e-@@ books , rather than conventional tex@@ t@@ books , are also an option .
sometimes these books are ren@@ ted de fac@@ to by providing an electronic licence for a certain period of time by whol@@ es@@ al@@ ers such as amaz@@ on@@ .com , che@@ g@@ g and bar@@ nes &amp; no@@ ble inc@@ .
at che@@ g@@ g you can buy &quot; cal@@ cul@@ us &quot; for 6 months for about $ 61 .
br@@ ac@@ ey says that students in liter@@ ary courses often find the best offers , since many classi@@ cs can be downloaded for free nowadays , while scientific and engineering tex@@ t@@ books can be very expensive .
take a look around .
jo@@ e ga@@ ult , 29 , who will soon be the pe@@ pper law school , recomm@@ ends the is@@ b@@ n number for the price determination of b@@ ills that are not so safe .
and before or@@ dering online , ga@@ ult would like to check whether the book is actually in stock .
he learned this lesson on the hard tour .
he bought a book that had four weeks delivery time and finally paid the full price in the college book@@ shop .
why &quot; guar@@ di@@ ans of the gal@@ ax@@ y &quot; no one has been called a po@@ ll .
&quot; the exten@@ ables 3 &quot; by sy@@ l@@ ves@@ ter st@@ all@@ one played less than 30 million dollars of his 90 million us budget , while &quot; si@@ n city : a da@@ ad to k@@ ill for &quot; was only $ 12 million .
the camera di@@ a@@ z movie &quot; sex tape &quot; played the opening night at the opening weekend only 14@@ .@@ 6 million dollars , while children &apos;s films like &quot; drag@@ on@@ f@@ ä@@ h@@ men made easy 2 &quot; also on revenue .
an article by ro@@ bin@@ son , a te@@ leg@@ raph film cri@@ tic , suggests that children &apos;s films are not sufficiently well suited to the lack of quality in the films themselves .
col@@ lin called 20@@ 14 &quot; the worst year &quot; for children &apos;s films and described &quot; drag@@ on beds made easy 2 &quot; as a purely &quot; functional &quot; fant@@ as@@ y sequ@@ el .
in films for a somewhat older target group , however , it seems that the quality of the films is not necessarily the problem .
in july , entertainment weekly compared the average cinem@@ as@@ co@@ res and met@@ ac@@ ri@@ tic rating for each summer movie start , the one between the american mem@@ orial .
the results are based on the opinion of cinema visitors and film cri@@ tics and indicate that this year &apos;s film h@@ its are similar to those of the previous year .
some comm@@ ent@@ ators say that the evolution is due to changing visual hab@@ its and the growing popul@@ arity of web stre@@ aming services such as net@@ f@@ li@@ x .
director j@@ on fav@@ re@@ au , who is currently working on dis@@ ney &apos;s upcoming jun@@ g@@ le book film , said to the ho@@ ll@@ y@@ wood report about the website : &quot; i think the times are changing . &quot;
we must accept this and not try to follow the past .
unlike today ’ s weak cash results of ho@@ ll@@ y@@ wood produc@@ tions , net@@ f@@ li@@ x has recently generated sales of stre@@ am@@ lined products .
last summer , the director ste@@ ven spi@@ el@@ berg cri@@ tici@@ zed film studios for focusing too much on film scre@@ ens by com@@ ics and pro@@ p@@ he@@ si@@ ed a &quot; core mel@@ t &quot; .
in the light of the current slow@@ down , some comm@@ ent@@ ators argue that his glo@@ om@@ y pro@@ ph@@ ec@@ y could well contain a true core .
the potential for ca@@ usal losses in the summer of 20@@ 15 , including av@@ eng@@ ers : age of ul@@ tr@@ on , mini@@ ons and jur@@ as@@ sic world , will mean that other representatives of the film industry are more optim@@ istic :
the producer of x-@@ men , sim@@ on kin@@ berg , described the decline in cash out@@ comes recently as simply &quot; cy@@ clic@@ al &quot; and said to ho@@ ll@@ y@@ wood re@@ porter : &quot; next summer will be the biggest summer in the world .
when the second table tennis district class was closed for stre@@ am@@ lining the li@@ gen division a few years ago , this was a step in the right direction .
now the german table tennis federation has added an additional 3rd bun@@ des@@ lig@@ a to the program .
the consequence : those who have not ris@@ en have gone up .
for example , g@@ ö@@ tt@@ ingen &apos;s highest class team tor@@ pe@@ do has won the ab@@ sc@@ ess in the ob@@ er@@ lig@@ a release , but will play only fifth in the coming season .
the fourth classic of tor@@ pe@@ do &apos;s ladies , despite their gran@@ di@@ ose mar@@ gin in the regional league .
the bo@@ ys and girls of tor@@ pe@@ do start in the lower sa@@ x@@ ony league , as do the bo@@ ys of the s@@ c we@@ en@@ de .
the s@@ g len@@ gl@@ ers and the tor@@ pe@@ do reserve are taking place in the new league of associations , in the national league there are no g@@ ö@@ tt@@ ingen clubs .
the tt@@ v ge@@ is@@ mar plays at the ladies in the association league , the tor@@ pe@@ do second in the national league .
what is the composition of the district is a better district class , now the new district so@@ ber@@ lig@@ a south .
here t@@ sv s@@ eu@@ ling@@ en , v@@ f@@ b l@@ ö@@ d@@ ing@@ sen , tor@@ pe@@ do iii , ge@@ is@@ mar , e@@ ing@@ ec@@ k , ham@@ en@@ ste@@ dt , bo@@ ven@@ der sv , lan@@ gen@@ hol@@ ten@@ sen , the f@@ c .
the regional representatives d@@ ran@@ s@@ fel@@ d and s@@ c we@@ en@@ de are playing in the district league , in the district class of the tt@@ c ii , ro@@ t-@@ wei@@ ß , the bo@@ ven@@ der sv ii and the teams of the tt@@ v .
g@@ ün@@ ter@@ sen , the tt@@ c and the tt@@ v ge@@ is@@ mar ii are here with from the game .
tor@@ pe@@ do iii and sa@@ it@@ en@@ haus@@ en / w@@ ö@@ ll@@ mar@@ sha@@ us@@ en start in the district sli@@ ga .
with nine teams each ,
the swe@@ eping s@@ c sen@@ ds its girls to the small district sli@@ ga .
the district sli@@ ga rela@@ y of the sc@@ w bo@@ ys - there still starts tor@@ pe@@ do ii - is not complete .
in a district class , ge@@ is@@ mar , tus@@ po we@@ en@@ de and bo@@ ven@@ der sv go into the season .
in the first season of the newly founded regional association the two g@@ ö@@ tt@@ inger districts start with nine teams each .
in the west season , the red and white ii , bo@@ ven@@ der sv iii , lau@@ bach ii , tor@@ pe@@ do iv and v , m@@ tv gr@@ one , d@@ ran@@ s@@ fel@@ der s@@ c ii , mi@@ el@@ en@@ haus@@ en are .
in the east season , among others , s@@ att@@ ten@@ haus@@ en / w@@ ö@@ ll@@ mar@@ sha@@ us@@ en , ni@@ ko@@ la@@ us@@ berg and land@@ ol@@ f@@ sha@@ us@@ en are playing .
the ladies kre@@ is@@ sli@@ ga consists of sat@@ ten@@ haus@@ en / w@@ ö@@ ll@@ mar@@ sha@@ us@@ en ii , bil@@ sha@@ us@@ en , hem@@ el@@ n , si@@ ul@@ ingen ii , tus@@ po we@@ en@@ de and s@@ g r@@ hu@@ me .
that is still better than in the o@@ ster@@ o@@ de county , where there are no more women teams at all at cir@@ cles .
it is striking that none of the six 2.@@ circu@@ lar classes reach@@ es target th@@ ick@@ ness , here the innovative and re@@ vol@@ ving district board will have to think about it .
nato summit : first pro@@ tests in new@@ port and car@@ di@@ ff
at the weekend , there were pro@@ tests from oppon@@ ents of the nato summit in new@@ port .
on saturday , hundreds of people gathered in the centre of new@@ port to an anti-@@ nato march .
on sunday , about 150 people arrived in car@@ di@@ ff in front of the town hall to hold a so-called counter@@ -@@ summit .
ste@@ ph@@ en fair@@ cl@@ ough has followed developments for us this weekend and has spoken to demonstr@@ ators who have travell@@ ed from britain to belgium .
te@@ en@@ ag@@ ers flo@@ wn out of the blue mountains
two young bus@@ h@@ hi@@ kers were brought into safety with the ro@@ pe win@@ ch after they had spent the night in the blue mountains in n@@ s@@ w .
the 16@@ -@@ year-@@ old girl and the 19@@ -@@ year-@@ old man bro@@ ke into go@@ ve@@ ts lea@@ p in black@@ he@@ ath shortly after sunday lun@@ ch@@ time .
concerned rela@@ tives called the police at about 8 p.m. when the two did not return home .
a search team from local police and rescue services bro@@ ke up and the couple was arrested at about 23 o &apos;@@ clock near the brid@@ al ve@@ il water@@ falls .
the girl had w@@ oun@@ ded her k@@ ne@@ e and the man had fallen and had turned his head .
rescue workers stayed with the couple over@@ night and they were flo@@ wn out on monday morning .
they were kept in stable condition with a am@@ bul@@ ance in the blue mountains hospital .
anti-@@ government pro@@ tests in pakistan es@@ cal@@ ate
the approximately 1000 demonstr@@ ators were killed by soldiers from the p@@ tv building , said information minister per@@ v@@ ai@@ z r@@ as@@ hi@@ d .
the station has broad@@ cast the broad@@ cast after half an hour .
p@@ tv director a@@ th@@ ar far@@ o@@ o@@ q said that the demonstr@@ ators equipped with stic@@ ks had equipment damaged in the ed@@ it@@ orial .
dead or in@@ ju@@ red were not reported .
the demonstr@@ ators are calling for the re@@ sign@@ ation of the prime minister , who is accused of electoral fraud .
the police told us about one kil@@ ome@@ tre from the residence of prime minister na@@ wa@@ z shar@@ if , it was possible to meet again on monday about 3@@ 000 demonstr@@ ators with security forces .
according to hospital information , a polic@@ em@@ an was in@@ ju@@ red .
at least three people were killed and more than 500 in@@ ju@@ red at the weekend when prote@@ sters tried to come to shar@@ if ’ s residence .
you are calling for the re@@ sign@@ ation of the prime minister .
the powerful military had to leave the army on sunday evening after a meeting in the army headquarters to find a political solution to the conflict , &apos; without wa@@ sting time and using force &apos; .
the communication also said that &apos; the army remains committed to its role in ensuring the security of the state &apos; .
es@@ cal@@ ating violence is wor@@ ried about military intervention that could be used in the past more often than not .
the political and economic reforms initiated by opposition politici@@ an im@@ ran kh@@ an and the pre@@ ach@@ er ta@@ h@@ ir@@ u@@ l q@@ ad@@ ri have been going on since independence day on 14 august .
shar@@ if ref@@ uses to re@@ vo@@ ke the agreement .
kh@@ an and q@@ ad@@ ri had called their sup@@ porters on sunday to stay .
&quot; we will not go back without forcing shar@@ if to resi@@ gn , &quot; kh@@ an said .
q@@ ad@@ ri expressed a similar view .
kh@@ an acc@@ uses shar@@ if of holding the may last year parliamentary election through fraud .
q@@ ad@@ ri calls for the re@@ sign@@ ation of central and provin@@ cial governments .
then a transitional government will reform the electoral system and call new elections .
more than 40 000 security forces are in operation to protect the government quarter .
the prote@@ sters had initially been able to walk out peace@@ fully in front of parliament until kh@@ an and q@@ ad@@ ri called on them to return to shar@@ if ’ s residence at the weekend .
h@@ ü@@ t@@ tel@@ dor@@ fer finished second season &apos;s victory at third place of the table .
with the 2 : 0 on val gar@@ den@@ a has a bit@@ ter week for rapi@@ d on sunday a reconc@@ ili@@ able end .
&quot; victory is very liber@@ ating , &quot; said tra@@ iner z@@ or@@ an bar@@ i@@ sic , whose team with the out in the euro@@ pa league on thursday had reached an intermedi@@ ate low .
&quot; the success experience was incredi@@ bly important , &quot; captain said , &quot; the captain and go@@ al@@ ke@@ eper ste@@ ff@@ en ho@@ f@@ mann , who was in the third place with green@@ -@@ white .
sch@@ ram@@ mel@@ -@@ dre@@ am@@ tor will quickly take you to sie@@ ger@@ stra@@ ß@@ e rapi@@ d , the second season &apos;s victory , and has shown the right response to the dis@@ appointment at hel@@ sin@@ ki and will go to the country with a success .
&quot; we wanted to show a positive reaction , &quot; said foreign def@@ en@@ der thomas sch@@ ram@@ me@@ l , who , with his splendid leadership vol@@ ley of the six@@ teenth corner , set the course for victory in the 14@@ th minute .
&quot; i thought i had to have all the fru@@ stration of thursday and i was able to s@@ na@@ p it under the bar , &quot; said the 2@@ 6-@@ year-@@ old s@@ mil@@ ing .
when sch@@ ram@@ me@@ l was on the 13@@ th nov@@ em@@ ber 2010 for the last time in a bun@@ des@@ lig@@ a match , that was still for ried .
the first championship match in the rapid d@@ ress will be re@@ mem@@ bered .
&quot; for me this is something very special , i am from the rapid growth of the new generation , &quot; said sch@@ ram@@ me@@ l .
due to the short term bec@@ k-@@ b@@ led course by mari@@ o pa@@ ve@@ lic , the cr@@ am@@ ble from the left turned to the right def@@ ensive side and made his thing very good there too .
he has had enough experience of being able to exercise this position in a mir@@ ac@@ ulous way .
he has earned the goal , he has already done some assi@@ sts this year , &quot; p@@ raised bar@@ i@@ sic .
team shows character sch@@ ram@@ me@@ l also delivered the f@@ lan@@ k at 2 : 0 by ho@@ f@@ mann after a little over an hour that finally brought the decision .
the fact is that the guests could have been cont@@ acted before that .
&quot; thank god we have had some lu@@ ck today , &quot; also said sch@@ ram@@ me@@ l , who was poin@@ ting out the gap between performance and results in recent weeks : &quot; the results did not vote , but the game was always good .
b@@ ari@@ sic even found that &quot; in many games before you had been better than today &quot; - against &quot; the strong@@ est team that will be in this sta@@ dium this season &quot; .
the first tri@@ angle since 26 july has therefore proved that the team structure is capable of with@@ drawing the set@@ backs in spite of : &quot; today my team has shown that it is a character &quot; .
no less pleas@@ ing to him : &apos; we have finally played back to zero &apos; .
a lot of work during the national break also the fact that bri@@ an beh@@ ren@@ dt , mari@@ o pa@@ ve@@ lic , chri@@ stop@@ her di@@ bon , den@@ i al@@ ar and michael sch@@ imp@@ el@@ s@@ ber@@ ger have made several fail@@ ures .
&apos;@@ we must not forget that &apos; , bar@@ i@@ sic war@@ ned , who has been working with great enthusiasm and pa@@ ve@@ lic for the past three days , &apos; which has been very stable recently &apos; .
the national break must therefore be used to &quot; clear the w@@ ounds and to avoid a bit of physical damage &quot; , explained bar@@ i &apos;s statement that the country had five u@@ 21 choices .
one of those who are probably particularly interested in the break is captain ho@@ f@@ mann .
he is te@@ aring up for the team , going beyond pain .
it is precisely at this difficult stage that he has shown that he is a very important player for us , &quot; stated bar@@ i@@ sic .
ho@@ f@@ mann gave the game rapi@@ ds before its replacement in the 6@@ 8@@ th minute not only the structure , but also achieved the second goal .
for the 3@@ 3-@@ year-@@ old who has completed his 3@@ 50@@ th bun@@ des@@ lig@@ a game , it was the first hit from the game since november 2 , 2013 ( 4 : 2 on the ad@@ mir@@ a ) .
ho@@ f@@ mann : &quot; must not believe that now everything is good &quot; &quot; we certainly also had a bit of lu@@ ck , but at some point the lu@@ ck must come back to us .
now it was high time , &quot; said ho@@ f@@ mann .
he ad@@ mitted that he would continue to work in a focused manner : &apos; you cannot always see this in black and white .
we have not played as badly in recent weeks as we have heard .
we must not , however , believe that everything is good now .
he could not deny the importance of his role for the team .
it is a very young team , and i can help them very much at the moment .
they are keeping to me at certain stages , &quot; said ho@@ f@@ mann .
gr@@ ö@@ di@@ g-@@ co@@ ach michael bau@@ r had little to blame himself and his team .
he regre@@ t@@ ted the quick match &quot; from the sor@@ ce@@ rer &apos;s gate &quot; and the regular goal of nu@@ tz in the 40@@ th minute , which was chosen by re@@ fe@@ ree colle@@ gi@@ um un@@ fairly .
the only criticism i can make of the team is that we are heading for tor in some stages not being concrete enough .
we have had too few qualifications .
internal def@@ en@@ der maxim@@ ili@@ an kar@@ ner saw it as similar : &quot; it started badly , but then we found it in and even made a goal .
by and large , it would have been more in the pipel@@ ine .
under this wh@@ ist@@ le there is ru@@ h
we showed a powerful tri@@ be in our pu@@ zz@@ ling task of the summer series &quot; my piece of rh@@ ö@@ ner lu@@ ck &quot; last friday .
several of these tree gi@@ ants are still in the county , the illustra@@ ted copy is the &quot; s@@ cour@@ ge &quot; above the under@@ -@@ wel@@ t@@ brun@@ n .
a woo@@ dy foot@@ path leads up to the approximately 600 years old o@@ ak .
it passes by cou@@ ples , bas@@ alt clu@@ sters and bas@@ alt stone seas .
a piece below the quar@@ ry of the bau@@ er@@ s@@ berg , one kil@@ ome@@ tre north of the stra@@ ß@@ e to we@@ is@@ bach , it stands .
vital looks like a natural mon@@ ument , it rises over the other trees in the area and remin@@ ds with a volume of more than eight meters of an american m@@ am@@ mo@@ th tree .
a small bud@@ d@@ ha on a tree sw@@ amp indicates that it is a spiritual or my@@ s@@ tical place .
but , despite intensive research , there were only indic@@ ations of the origin of the name .

after weeks of tu@@ g of tu@@ g , italy &apos;s premier and eu current president , mat@@ te@@ o ren@@ zi , has voted against strong conservative resistance at last week &apos;s eu special summit to nom@@ in@@ ate his foreign minister , feder@@ ica mo@@ gh@@ u@@ g@@ u .
ren@@ zi looks at how the govern@@ ment@@ -@@ close daily la re@@ pub@@ b@@ lic@@ a re@@ states the voc@@ ation of his also in the government team as a fav@@ ori@@ ti@@ st as strengthening the position of the social democrats and his own .
he also exp@@ ects a boost to his &quot; reform package &quot; in italy .
last but not least , ren@@ zi hopes that the ever@@ -@@ increasing left party base will be put in a position of calm , because mo@@ gh@@ er@@ ini will not be able to support this - albeit in a more moderate way .
i have a great deal to say to the conservative representatives of the commission , mr jun@@ ck@@ er , and to the poland nom@@ inated as president of the council , don@@ ald tus@@ k , so the prevail@@ ing opinion in rome , so that political balance can be achieved .
the eu &apos;s chief diplom@@ at will be the depu@@ ty prime minister of the commission , mr jun@@ ck@@ er .
the remaining agreement of the european parliament is considered certain .
otherwise , president gi@@ or@@ gio na@@ polit@@ ano would have preferred the nom@@ ination of the 4@@ 1@@ th year politici@@ an of the ruling democratic party ( p@@ d ) to have little &apos; important recognition &apos; of italy &apos;s role in the eu .
la re@@ pub@@ b@@ lic@@ a is spre@@ ading optim@@ ism that the political parties , which have been tried and tr@@ usted for almost two decades in leading party offices and which are known for their ambition , will be able to rise to the &apos; enormous challenges &apos; .
the native roman is married and has two dau@@ gh@@ ters .
her party career began with a political scienti@@ st in 1996 in the youth organization of the then democratic di sin@@ ist@@ ra ( lin@@ k@@ s@@ democrats ) , who was in 2008 engaged with the catho@@ lic center party mar@@ c .
in 1999 , mo@@ gh@@ er@@ ini was elected vice-president of the european community organization of youth ( european youth ) for three years .
the election of 2001 to the lef@@ t-@@ wing democrats led to the high party politics , worked in the foreign affairs department , whose leader she soon became .
it occupied traditional fo@@ cal points of italian foreign policy , such as the middle east , was supple@@ mented by studies of nato ’ s operation in afghanistan , in which italy is involved with a tro@@ op cont@@ ingent , maintained contacts with the social democrats in europe and europe .
since 2008 she has been a member of the chamber of depu@@ ties , in which she is an expert in defence and european and international affairs .
when ren@@ zi became premier in february 20@@ 14 , he told mo@@ gh@@ er@@ ini to become his foreign minister .
if the p@@ d is to get better relations with the country ’ s strong peace movement , which is one of the party ’ s more than 40 % votes in the may eu elections , then , as p@@ d cir@@ cles have noted , i have .
i do not agree with the re@@ pro@@ aches in brussels that the new eu foreign affairs representative has too little diplomatic experience , and therefore l@@ acks substance .
in brussels , particularly by poland and the baltic members , realistic acc@@ ents are being mo@@ gh@@ er@@ in@@ is , mi@@ stru@@ st@@ fully , on the crisis in ukraine and described as &apos; pro-@@ russian course &apos; .
it supports the russian company ga@@ z@@ pro@@ m pipel@@ ine south stream , which is being discussed by russian gas in by@@ passing ukraine , directly to southern europe .
after ren@@ zi re@@ signed in july as eu president , mo@@ gh@@ er@@ ini travel@@ ed to her first state visit to moscow .
photos you took with putin at sha@@ ke@@ -@@ hands were taken in brussels with ou@@ tr@@ age , and also that you had to leave the kre@@ m@@ lin head for october to a milan economic summit .

the french socialists should &apos; keep their mou@@ ths open and put france in order &apos; , said fran@@ co@@ is hol@@ lan@@ de &apos;s main ally .
mr v@@ alls called on the deeply divided left to &apos; love &apos; for the controversial issue of the socialist president .
the president deserves respect for everyone , deserves our loy@@ alty , he deserves our support .
&quot; it is our duty to remain at his side , &quot; he said with great applause .
the prime minister made a re@@ ass@@ uring ge@@ st@@ ure that his government would not accept the controversial 3@@ 5-@@ hour week in france despite strong calls for eas@@ ing the regime by em@@ manu@@ el mac@@ ron , the new prime minister of economics .
on saturday , mr hol@@ lan@@ de ur@@ ged his fellow socialists to &apos; un@@ ite &apos; with the government .
but christi@@ ane tau@@ bir@@ a , the minister for justice , has been putting sand into the whe@@ els of meeting with the de@@ vil at a meeting of the socialist member and the socialist party in favour of the idea of a european parliament .
marine le pen , the far right leader of the national front , mo@@ c@@ ked the socialist fun@@ eral stri@@ kes and said that they could not imagine that the new v@@ all@@ s government would last longer than a few months .
fran@@ co@@ is hol@@ lan@@ de is the emper@@ or without clothes , but prin@@ ce manu@@ el v@@ alls has no clothes , they are forced to form a new government if the old one does not even survive a summer .
&quot; and the new will also not survive the autumn or winter , &quot; said miss le pen to support .
she repeated her party &apos;s call for parliament to be dis@@ solved and said that she was confident that she would win in early elections and that she was ready to gover@@ n .
the french ruling party suffered a defe@@ at in the local elections in march and the right-@@ wing national front was at the eu elections in may .
a survey published in the sunday newspaper journal du di@@ man@@ che showed that 76 % of french people believe that the socialists and the french are at risk of being threatened with death before the end of hol@@ land &apos;s term in 20@@ 17 .
pas@@ cal per@@ r@@ in@@ ea@@ u , a political scienti@@ st at sciences po university , war@@ ned that the french would quickly lose pati@@ ence , if the new socialist regime had no improvement in the economy and re@@ kor@@ ds .
&quot; there is a small window of opportunity , but public opinion must feel fast that things change , &quot; he war@@ ned .
otherwise , the situation could deterior@@ ate further .

pro-@@ hong kong activi@@ sts condemn china the day after the election .
a pe@@ king@@ -@@ loy@@ al group was close to the chinese flag .
the standing committee of the national people ’ s congress adopted a framework law on sunday , which only nom@@ inated two or three candidates for the hong kong leadership in 20@@ 17 .
all candidates must first have the majority support of a nom@@ ination committee , which is expected to work with pe@@ king@@ -@@ loy@@ al members .
this decision will almost make it impossible for opposition democrats to be allowed to vote and promp@@ ted pro-@@ democracy activi@@ sts to vote in favour of their threat .
political reform has long been a controversial issue in hong kong , and china ’ s party leaders fear that calls for democracy will spread to other cities .
after the publication of a beijing white paper in june , which confirmed china &apos;s domin@@ ance over hong kong , democratic activi@@ sts held an un@@ official referendum .

putin demands ki@@ e@@ v to open &quot; state@@ hood talks &quot; with eastern ukraine .
russian president v@@ la@@ di@@ mir putin demanded russian media reports that on sunday ukra@@ inian government should not be allowed to continue fighting the separ@@ ati@@ sts in the east of the country and start negotiations immediately on the &quot; state@@ hood &quot; of the russian government .
his spo@@ kes@@ man , di@@ mit@@ ri pes@@ ko@@ v , later made it clear that putin did not mean that this would be the region of east russia under the control of the separ@@ ati@@ sts , but that his status vis@@ -@@ à@@ -@@ vis ukraine should be re@@ defined .
putin ’ s appeal to the ki@@ e@@ v government to negotiate on an equal foot@@ ing with pro-@@ russian insur@@ g@@ ents , however , f@@ its in with the policy that he has apparently pursued since the ri@@ ots began five months ago : help for separ@@ ati@@ st regions
in an interview with the state television channel one , putin condemned the ukra@@ inian military campaign for the re@@ con@@ quest of the land held by separ@@ ati@@ sts in the eastern regions of don@@ et@@ sk and lu@@ han@@ sk , which took place in march .
the kre@@ m@@ lin and the separ@@ ati@@ sts have recently described the area taken as a &apos; nov@@ vor@@ os@@ si@@ ya &apos; or &apos; ne@@ us@@ russia &apos; , a term that is remin@@ is@@ cent of the pre-@@ revolutionary period of russian empire .
putin pointed out that all those who have been in ukraine ’ s campaign for the elections on 26 october , and those who have been in power in government groups , have been using civilian communities in the areas held by separ@@ ati@@ sts , are att@@ acking their peace .
&quot; we need to start detailed discussions immediately , not only on technical issues , but also on the political organisation of society and the state status of south-@@ east ukraine , in order to safeguard the interests of the people who live there , &quot; he said .
pes@@ ko@@ v said that putin ’ s reference to state@@ hood in the context of greater autonomy must be seen , which has been supported for months by ki@@ e@@ v ’ s leadership , to address concerns in rus@@ si@@ an-@@ speaking areas .
only the ukra@@ inian government can give the eastern territories the necessary autonomy , said pes@@ ko@@ v .
this is not about negotiations between ukraine and russia , pes@@ ko@@ v said , &apos; because there is no conflict between russia and ukraine , but about an internal conflict in ukraine &apos; .
the kre@@ m@@ lin speaker &apos;s clari@@ fication of the &apos; mis@@ interpretation &apos; of putin &apos;s remarks under@@ lined the leadership claim of russia in dealing with the separ@@ ati@@ st re@@ bel@@ lion in the east , unlike the way russia handled it directly .
moscow would have far greater difficulty in getting the regions of don@@ et@@ sk and lu@@ han@@ sk to anne@@ xed to eastern ukraine , as most of the 6.@@ 5 million inhabitants are not rus@@ sians and po@@ lls from the pre-@@ conflict era are still a major source .
the autonomy enjoyed by russian diplom@@ ats in international for@@ a would be a great help to regional governments in ukraine to negotiate their own trade agreements and external relations , and thus to the kre@@ m@@ lin de fac@@ to control an area .
the peninsula anne@@ xed five months ago in the black sea is the home port for most of russia &apos;s na@@ vy and an important trading port and historical coastal region .
the regions between the ro@@ sto@@ v region in russia and cri@@ me@@ a are also rich in mines , fac@@ tories and foun@@ dri@@ es , which are important components for the russian military .
ukra@@ inian president pe@@ tr@@ o por@@ o@@ sh@@ en@@ ko proposed , in his in@@ aug@@ ur@@ ation speech on 7 june , that ukra@@ inian legislation - after new elections - should consider constitutional addi@@ tions that would allow the territories greater control over their finances .
but his idea of autonomy seems to be in sharp contrast to that of the kre@@ m@@ lin and the separ@@ ati@@ st re@@ be@@ ls , whose arm@@ ament and inci@@ tement to moscow is accused .
putin ’ s last call to ki@@ e@@ v to negotiate with separ@@ ati@@ st leaders at an equal level followed another pre-@@ em@@ in@@ ence in the re@@ be@@ ls last week , after russian troops and pan@@ thers bro@@ ke the rules .
the separ@@ ati@@ sts , supported by russia , took over in the hand , which , according to fears of ukra@@ inian security officials , was the first step in a campaign to take over the strategic coastal region to cri@@ me@@ a , control of no@@ vo@@ os@@ ov .
that is why massive civilian and military preparations have begun to bring mari@@ u@@ pol , a steel industry port , with 5@@ 00@@ ,000 inhabitants .
por@@ o@@ sh@@ en@@ ko spoke to the european union at a meeting of eu leaders in brussels on saturday and ur@@ ged action to prevent another russian aggres@@ sion against ukraine , a former soviet republic that has been independent for 23 years .
&quot; we are on the br@@ ink of a point where there is no return , &quot; war@@ ned por@@ o@@ sh@@ en@@ ko .
thousands of foreign troops and hundreds of foreign tan@@ ks are now on the territory of ukraine .
the eu summit did not decide on concrete actions , the leadership demanded further sanctions against russia , which would be put in place in the event of an un@@ specified es@@ cal@@ ation of the ukra@@ inian crisis .
ukra@@ inian soldiers had to move away from their positions in il@@ o@@ wa@@ j@@ sk after two russian tan@@ k colum@@ ns and 1@@ ,000 soldiers entered the don@@ et@@ sk region last week to secure the sie@@ ge of separ@@ ati@@ sts .
the first probably 63 ukra@@ inian soldiers who were killed by the russian inv@@ asion in il@@ o@@ wa@@ j@@ sk were killed on sunday against 10 russian par@@ ach@@ uti@@ sts , who were killed a week ago in ukra@@ inian territory .

the film city is in ex@@ ci@@ tement after a series of unique photos of a na@@ ked j@@ enni@@ fer law@@ rence in a h@@ ack@@ ings scand@@ al around cele@@ bri@@ ties on the internet .
the h@@ ack@@ er responsible for this probably has 60 nu@@ de photos of law@@ rence , star from &quot; the tribute of pan@@ em &quot; and super@@ stars , including the model .

there are 10@@ 1 cele@@ bri@@ ties on the list .
no@@ ble , who got p@@ raised with g@@ rec@@ o last month , said to confi@@ d@@ ential : &quot; it &apos;s dis@@ gu@@ sting . &quot;
all private letters and pictures should remain private .
it is a sh@@ ame that private information has been sto@@ len and passed on to others .
g@@ rec@@ ko , currently in new york , said re@@ porte@@ dly a news site that the h@@ ack is &quot; dis@@ gr@@ ac@@ eful &quot; and that the people affected felt &quot; hur@@ t .
the h@@ ack@@ er probably has 30 images of pal@@ mer with her ex@@ -@@ friend scot@@ t spe@@ ed@@ man , including two pictures in which she is above without a pool .
pal@@ mer &apos;s film works include &quot; love is un@@ be@@ at@@ able &quot; with li@@ am hem@@ s@@ worth .
pal@@ mer , ch@@ uc@@ k-@@ star stra@@ ho@@ v@@ ski and the ac@@ tress brow@@ ning from suc@@ ker pun@@ ch were yesterday in favour of comments on the ch@@ op@@ ped pictures .

cy@@ cli@@ sts , jo@@ gg@@ ers and hi@@ kers were on the big fel@@ d@@ berg yesterday on the 8@@ th bike and have thus joined the association &quot; help for cancer children &quot; .
the tour , which was a tor@@ tu@@ ous one , was a light training for the others .
however , there was one thing on which everyone agreed : it was fun .
thomas stu@@ dan@@ ski will have sle@@ pt well last night .
for the first time in his life , the head of the ob@@ er@@ ur@@ sel@@ er bre@@ w@@ ery was riding a bike on the fel@@ d@@ berg yesterday .
for the good purpose .
he can easily get away from the little mus@@ cle ca@@ ke , especially as he is not allowed to take part in the 8@@ th cycle on the great fel@@ d@@ berg in favour of the association &quot; help for cancer children &quot; ( frankfurt ) .
a great thing .
&quot; i know now that i can do that - great ! &quot;
small pic@@ king up in the ap@@ pl@@ la@@ us@@ kur@@ ve ?
n@@ ye , if i had ever stopped , it was about to be ...
as thomas stu@@ dan@@ ski , who is responsible for the c@@ du in the ob@@ er@@ ur@@ sel@@ er stad@@ t@@ m@@ r@@ ü@@ ck@@ en , yesterday , many of the 7@@ 18 participants were tor@@ tured in the spring and came close to exhaus@@ tion pla@@ te@@ au , but happy .
others , by contrast , had a easier ride on the 11 km long stre@@ tch between the ho@@ he@@ mark and fel@@ d@@ berg .
nor@@ man di@@ ess@@ ner , for example .
the green politici@@ an from the kre@@ m@@ lin , who appears in red , has a red d@@ ress , a red bike , made a little more on under@@ statement ( &quot; lots of professionals , there is arrive the destination ! &quot; ) !
he too is driving the course in a sli@@ de , as did n@@ ina ku@@ hn , press spo@@ kes@@ person for the city of ob@@ er@@ ur@@ sel , who , together with frank gr@@ ün@@ e@@ is@@ en , had set out on the way .
for the two tri@@ athle@@ tes , the &quot; fel@@ d@@ berg bike &quot; was not necessarily a sporting challenge : &quot; this is about char@@ ity , we are happy to be there - we would have had an exit anyway today &quot; , &quot; he said .
on the way , they met paul w@@ en@@ z@@ el from ob@@ er@@ re@@ i@@ f@@ en@@ berg .
the boy ( 12 ) was des@@ c@@ ended in the morning to ob@@ er@@ ur@@ sel to get straight on to the top .
the frankfurt fl@@ ori@@ an or@@ der@@ z had settled in the sat@@ tel at 9 a.m. , &quot; made &quot; the field mountain two times , to then go with fun home .
the fun was also &quot; fr@@ it@@ ten@@ -@@ ton@@ i &quot; .
for the head of the ob@@ er@@ ur@@ sel@@ er k@@ ul@@ t@@ ki@@ os@@ k , bike tours over the fel@@ d@@ berg are just part of the package .
he had a hard time driving his 6.@@ 5 kil@@ o racing bike 40 minutes .
a cra@@ zy event .
for this purpose - i am happy to be there &quot; , andre@@ as bal@@ z@@ ke said .
the thir@@ ty trained main@@ zer says that he is an &quot; ambitious rac@@ e@@ cy@@ c@@ list &quot; .
he must be , because he was not very happy with the &quot; fixed wheel &quot; , but he was also on the road , although rac@@ e@@ bi@@ kes are not ...
the room was very clean and comfortable .
ber@@ g@@ w@@ ach@@ t doctor professor vol@@ ker lis@@ ch@@ ke , who with his team , equipped with all@@ rad@@ -@@ bul@@ ly and qu@@ ad , provided for safety , said : &quot; the ken@@ n &quot; i from frankfurt , the train station .
the 7@@ 18 participants - and with them as many as ever - were sent to groups in the morning .
the hi@@ kers first at 9.@@ 30 a.m.
the first cy@@ cli@@ sts and run@@ ners followed at 10 am .
five minutes later the first mountain bi@@ kers set off .
b@@ ent han@@ sen , chairman of the association &quot; rad@@ in@@ en auf den gro@@ ß@@ en fel@@ d@@ berg &quot; , gave the start comm@@ ands and w@@ ished the participants a nice trip .
for next year , he hope that he will be able to make the route to fel@@ d@@ berg to the safety of the participants .
