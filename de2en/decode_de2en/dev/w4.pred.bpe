opinion : even more security for pede@@ stri@@ ans !
they are not 100 metres away : on tuesday the first day of the week in gu@@ t@@ ach is the new b 3@@ 3-@@ pede@@ strian traffic light at the village car park - in sight of the older town hall lights .
two plants as close to each other : intention or tur@@ tle b@@ ür@@ ger ?
this issue has been raised by gu@@ t@@ ach@@ s may@@ or yesterday in a clear manner .
&quot; the town hall atmosphere is then installed .
the k@@ lu@@ ser traffic lights safe both cy@@ cli@@ sts and bus passengers and the mountain inhabitants .
the new version of the system , which was officially launched yesterday , is important for the sul@@ z@@ b@@ ach@@ we@@ g / kir@@ ch@@ stra@@ ß@@ e cros@@ s@@ roads .
we have the museum , two churches , kur@@ park , the bus stop , a doctor and a bank as well as the flow of traffic from the residential area › gru@@ b ‘ .
&quot; the high traffic and pede@@ strian u@@ ph@@ ill had to be secured by another traffic light &quot; , says ec@@ ker@@ t .
peter mar@@ n@@ old also confir@@ ms this from the district council of off@@ enburg .
&quot; according to current measure@@ ments , the b 33 is passing through the municip@@ ality of gu@@ t@@ ach every day , about 10 percent of which is heavy goods traffic , &quot; says ar@@ no@@ ld .
therefore , the construction of another traffic light is more than necessary : &quot; safety is just before us &quot; , he says .
in total , four traffic surve@@ ys have been carried out , and a roun@@ d@@ about has also been planned , but due to the narrow inter@@ section between sul@@ z@@ b@@ ach@@ we@@ g and kir@@ ch@@ stra@@ ß@@ e .
it was named after ar@@ no@@ ld in the choice of location of the traffic light m@@ ast before : &quot; by means of an extra for us with particularly long tr@@ un@@ ks of lo@@ gging trans@@ ports we have tested whether these vehicles are from sul@@ fur .
the approximately 15 000 euro expensive traffic light system itself is the &quot; most modern , which is currently available on the market &quot; , explained ar@@ n@@ old .
the complex is equipped with col@@ oured le@@ ds that are so bright and bright that the light is from the car lan@@ ding , for example , also at low sun .
and it is also econom@@ ical : the older lighting systems use about 100 wat@@ ts , the new ones just eight wat@@ ts .
there are three lights for each direction of travel .
ar@@ no@@ ld explained the technique of the new plant : this is equipped with two rad@@ ar sen@@ sors .
press the pede@@ strian to the traffic lights , test the upper part of the rad@@ ar and test the traffic situation .
the road is free , immediately green for the pede@@ strian , if not , it takes about 15 seconds .
another rad@@ ar sensor checks if the green phase is suitable for pede@@ stri@@ ans .
&quot; if a group or disabled people should be taken over the road , the green phase will be extended , so everyone will come safe@@ ly over the track &quot; , explained ar@@ no@@ ld .
of course , the driver must be involved in this as a partner and observe the track .
this was not the case yesterday : hardly showed the traffic lights for pede@@ stri@@ ans green , r@@ ough@@ ed a upper class vehicle through - at le@@ u@@ ch@@ ten@@ de red .
jo@@ se@@ f win@@ k@@ ler has been writing for more than 30 years the needs of his child@@ hood and youth from the soul .
the disasters of his catho@@ lic village child@@ hood - the language absence , the inc@@ lin@@ ation to raw violence and bl@@ un@@ t sexual orientation - are the close and jo@@ y@@ ful .
the p@@ and@@ ora prize winner is known for his pro@@ se author , theatre texts are available in his work ra@@ r .

the theatre maker combines elements from the automotive sector , for example , with the novel &quot; the le@@ i@@ be@@ i@@ gen@@ e &quot; ( 198@@ 7 ) with pro@@ sam@@ ines from &quot; le@@ ic@@ ht@@ nam , his family lau@@ gh@@ ing &quot; ( 2003 ) .
the largely empty chamber can be seen as an important part of the new stage : a cr@@ um@@ pled sound with a large screen and a large screen .
director of the film &quot; the man in the street &quot; , says the author of the book .
the 7@@ 0-@@ minute performance exce@@ eds the expectations of the original with a wealth of regi@@ stry entries .
the ac@@ t@@ res@@ ses in particular are used in the sometimes somewhat question@@ able scen@@ ic trans@@ forma@@ tions .
they are har@@ d-@@ hit , with their head b@@ ent under water , with their evening pi@@ pes to the wall ta@@ pped .
in the cel@@ lo@@ ph@@ an or in the bo@@ d@@ y. in the cor@@ rid@@ ors , they st@@ ack on danger@@ ously high stic@@ ks , either mono@@ lo@@ gies them lou@@ dly or are completely mu@@ ted on the stage .
the text is conve@@ yed in this way , however , hardly in this way .
the best moments have the evening when sung will - the band will be spread from deep p@@ ur@@ p@@ le to the fol@@ k cost@@ umes .
only towards the end will the crow@@ ded performance be a little quiet , and win@@ k@@ ler ’ s down@@ right absur@@ d hum@@ or is b@@ low@@ ing up .
a black@@ box in the car ?
american road plan@@ ner are looking for a way to find a source of money to finance the falling high@@ way system .
the devices that carry any kil@@ ome@@ tre travell@@ ed and send the information to the authorities are the core of a controversial experim@@ ent by washington .
the normally bor@@ ing area of road planning suddenly has a more intensive debate with bun@@ ches of al@@ li@@ ances .
liber@@ tari@@ ans have been al@@ lied with environmental groups and advoc@@ ate that the government should protect the small boxes to record the p@@ lots of kilometres – and possibly even to where they are dangerous – that they should use the information for the calcul@@ ation .
the tea party is app@@ alled .
the american civil rights association ( ac@@ l@@ u ) is also deeply concerned and ut@@ ter@@ ly un@@ concerned about data protection .
but , while congress is not agreed on a course of action , several states are no longer waiting .
they are currently exam@@ ining how they can be implemented over the next ten years into a system where drivers are required to pay for each mil@@ e@@ age they have travell@@ ed .
thousands of mo@@ tori@@ sts have used the tac@@ ho@@ graph@@ s , some of which are equipped with g@@ ps monitoring , to check .
this is really a must for our country .
“ it is nothing we can only use , ” said h@@ as@@ an i@@ kh@@ ra@@ ta , managing director of so@@ k@@ ra , a company that is based in the south california state of california .
the way in which we use these taxes will change .
the technology is there .
the initiative comes at a time when the highway trust fund is being used to fund the money from the taxes that americans pay at the ti@@ er of the fuel cell .
but america is no longer b@@ ail@@ ed out as much as it did before .
cars use less petro@@ l .
the state tax on min@@ eral oil of 18@@ .@@ 4 c@@ ents per gall@@ on ( less than 4 euro@@ c@@ ents per lit@@ re ) has not been increased for 20 years .
politicians d@@ are to take a look at the tax at high prices , even by a cent .
“ the tax on petro@@ l is simply not sustainable , ” says le@@ e mun@@ n@@ ich , an expert on transport legislation at the university of min@@ n@@ es@@ ot@@ a .
his state has recently built 500 vehicles with tac@@ ho@@ graph@@ s , with which a mil@@ est@@ one based management system can be tested .
“ this represents the most sensible alternative in the long term , ” he said .
bureaucr@@ ats call it mil@@ est@@ ones .
not surpris@@ ingly , the idea of urban liber@@ als is found in fav@@ or of a tax that could be used , for example , to change driving behaviour in such a way that cong@@ es@@ tion and cli@@ ma@@ te-@@ dam@@ aging ex@@ ha@@ ust emissions are reduced .
the california pl@@ ann@@ ers rely on the system in drawing up strategies to help the most ambitious and ambitious legislative and economic objectives of the federal state .
but republic@@ an bill sh@@ us@@ ter of pen@@ n@@ sy@@ l@@ v@@ ania has been chairman of the house transportation committee for the last three years .
the free marke@@ ters of the reason foundation are also excluded from the idea that drivers should be able to search for a route that has been re@@ trac@@ ted .
“ this is not a tax that is placed in a black hole ” , explains adri@@ an mo@@ ore , vice president of the reach and b@@ c@@ p guidelines .
people pay directly for what they get .
the movement is also supported by two former us transport ministers , who were in a report in 2011 to invite congress to take part in the process of mil@@ est@@ one based accounting .
the us sen@@ ate approved a new 90 million dollars of expensive pipel@@ ine project last year , which cost 10 000 cars .
but the majority in the house of representatives prevented the move and respon@@ ded to the concerns of mr le@@ hne , the rural depu@@ ties , who represent people who are often in the hab@@ it of travelling many miles on the way to work or to the city .
several states and major cities are nevertheless moving towards the eu .
the most committed is o@@ reg@@ on , which currently has 5@@ ,000 drivers for the largest experim@@ ent in the country .
these drivers will soon be paying mil@@ e@@ age instead of the oil tax to the state .
ne@@ v@@ ada has already launched a pilot project .
new york city is also considering such a move .
il@@ lin@@ o@@ is tests it in limited measure with l@@ k@@ ws .
and the i-@@ 95 coalition , which includes the transport ministers , has been invited by 17 states on the east coast ( including mar@@ y@@ land , pen@@ n@@ sy@@ l@@ v@@ ania , vir@@ g@@ ini@@ a and fl@@ ori@@ da ) .
the concept is not a universal hit .
in ne@@ v@@ ada , where recently 50 volunte@@ ers were equipped with the equipment , drivers were s@@ cep@@ tical about the idea of the government having to follow any of their movements .
“ concern about big brother and such things were a big problem , ” explains al@@ aud@@ din kh@@ an , head of the strategic and industrial development team at the united states department of transport .
people did not want it .
when the test was completed , the ac@@ l@@ u war@@ ned ne@@ v@@ ada that it was on its website : “ it would be relatively easy to use the tac@@ ho@@ graph in full-@@ grown monitoring devices . ”
there is no need to create a huge , bul@@ ky technology world .
ne@@ v@@ ada is part of a number of states that are now seeking affordable technology .
so , kh@@ an said , the public would also be more reas@@ su@@ red .
the hun@@ t for this technology has led some authorities to a small star@@ tup company called true mil@@ e@@ age in california .
the company was not originally established to provide assistance to states in the taxation of car drivers .
rather , it was their aim to create a competitive environment in an emerging market for car insurance , where the drivers are required to pay for their driving lic@@ ences on the basis of the miles they have travell@@ ed .
but the information she has tested is also useful for road pl@@ ann@@ ers , because they do not work with g@@ ps and only provide limited information that is regularly sent via mode@@ m .
“ people are more willing to remember , but they are not willing to share their speed and locations ” , said ry@@ an mor@@ r@@ ison , managing director of tru@@ e mis@@ sour@@ i .
in some of these public pilot programmes , big mistakes were made .
there are much cheaper and less in@@ tru@@ sive ways to implement this .
o@@ reg@@ on is a place where the plan@@ ner experim@@ ents to find a number of choices for mo@@ tori@@ sts .
you can register for a device with or without g@@ ps .
or you don &apos;t choose any device at all and instead pay a flat fee based on the average of all residents of the state .
others hope to see the concept of a susp@@ icious public sold , by using the devices with more functions .
in new york city , transport officials want to develop a tax device that will also cover parking charges , a insurance scheme for paid passengers and a system for paying for speed miles .
“ drivers would be more than satisfied with the added value of the system .
some transport pl@@ ann@@ ers , however , wonder whether all the talk about paying per m@@ ile is not just a huge di@@ str@@ action exercise .
the metro@@ politan transport system is based on the metro@@ politan transport commission for the san francis@@ co bay area , and the congress is able to resolve the problem of bank@@ rup@@ t@@ cy highway trust fund .
an additional one-@@ time fee or an annual lev@@ y could be a driving licence for hy@@ bri@@ d vehicles or other vehicles that use little petro@@ l .
“ there is no reason for an operation if an asp@@ ir@@ in is sufficient , ” explains the ran@@ dy r@@ ent@@ sch@@ ler , the head of legislation and public affairs of the commission .
if we do that , hundreds of millions of car drivers are wor@@ ried about their privacy and many other things .

the voluntary fire service ir@@ ri@@ g@@ ated its autumn break in the city despite sta@@ ff@@ ing short@@ ages .
only 11 men took part in the exercise .
department comm@@ ander h@@ ans k@@ amer@@ er had already been involved in the training in his as@@ sumption of practice in the castle church of bur@@ g@@ ber@@ ger stras@@ se .
the sa@@ wing process is to be short .
the resulting fire and the smo@@ ke development have created two people who are in@@ ju@@ red , one of whom could still send an emergency call .
two bre@@ a@@ thing protection carri@@ ers of the armed forces made themselves into the hands of the police after the first check of the situation by h@@ ans kam@@ me@@ rer .
after a short time , the first person was able to find and enter the open .
the second person had to be wor@@ n .
this was not so easy , because close sta@@ irs were also to be overcome .
the building , a workshop with integrated st@@ all@@ ing-@@ room for two horses , was not easy to secure .
it stored a lot of wood and stra@@ w bal@@ es in it .
there were also electrical machines for wo@@ od@@ working .
the first dele@@ tion attack was made via the tan@@ k in the vehicle .
another management was carried out by an over@@ flow hy@@ dr@@ ant in about 100 meters distance .
now three ran@@ dom attacks have been made .
the new building was also used for the use of a hol@@ low be@@ am pi@@ pe .
h@@ ans kam@@ me@@ rer was the practice also to show how to make a difference with little available resources .
in case of emergency , support is provided via the kö@@ ni@@ gs@@ fel@@ d daily operations group .
the comm@@ ander was satisfied with the course of the exercise .
net@@ working of universities and companies important
on his visit to the district of bre@@ is@@ ga@@ u high black forest , the country president gui@@ do wol@@ f also visited ti@@ ti@@ ti@@ se@@ e-@@ neu@@ stadt to find out where the work@@ force of tomorrow will come from .
the ho@@ ch@@ sch@@ war@@ z@@ wal@@ d funding centre , together with the managing directors of vocational schools and the district gy@@ m@@ na@@ si@@ um and the parents &apos; advisory board , went on to this important issue .
&quot; education is an important factor in location &quot; , under@@ lined cla@@ u@@ dia ste@@ h@@ le , director of the han@@ s-@@ th@@ om@@ a school , which has developed the net@@ worked school education center ho@@ ch@@ sch@@ war@@ z@@ wal@@ d .
wol@@ f was impres@@ sed by the model projects for training .
since 2011 , the forest town has been home to a successful cooperation between the support centre , the district gy@@ m@@ na@@ si@@ um and the vocational school centre .
he also p@@ raised the family-@@ friendly character of the district .
&quot; it is important not only to keep the family phase in mind , but also to take a look at the period of care for the care of family members , &quot; wol@@ f said .
he also said that more and more people are looking after care and care for their families .
&quot; without the support of employers , the resulting increase in the burden on employees can lead to an end to the employment relationship , &quot; said wol@@ f .
but no one can afford to let skilled workers lose their jobs , he said .
another particularly important factor is the net@@ working of high-@@ level and enterprise .
&quot; for who@@ ever has been the mer@@ its of the region during his studies , remains with his acquired knowledge and experience .
only if there are sufficient training places can we ensure that the skilled workers &apos; needs are met .
he believes that the location advantage of the district is its advant@@ ageous location in the sou@@ th@@ west of germany , in the immediate vicinity of france and switzerland .
he also had a lot of fun on his train journey from ti@@ ti@@ se@@ e-@@ neu@@ stadt to fre@@ i@@ burg , and the efforts already made to expand public transport .
&quot; stay firm and continue to be a matter of urgency for the public to be better . &quot;

the more than 100 years old natural stone wall , the front line of the pre-@@ reconstruction old school yard , is a church road , which is to be re@@ built with a view to the renov@@ ation costs of the city of br@@ ä@@ un@@ ling@@ en .
in the days before kil@@ big , the first works of the renov@@ ation of the front school yard were followed by a small corner wall , to stabil@@ ise and sta@@ tic relief of the more than a hundred years old stone wall with bal@@ u@@ str@@ ade .
the next step is to , according to alexander mis@@ ok of the br@@ ä@@ un@@ ling@@ er city building office , the national mon@@ ument office , be included in the planning and to establish a re@@ hab@@ ilitation concept for the old wall .
after that , the experts will make a cost calcul@@ ation , which will then be made available to the local council for the decision and for the definition of the further action .
a decision on this is expected next year .
after the renov@@ ation , pav@@ ing and plan@@ ting of the old school building , the building was completed in the two sides of the building built in 19@@ 12 .
the historic , one-@@ hundred year old border wall of the old school court to the church road , is mainly marked by water and fro@@ st damage , as no dr@@ ying is present .
deep cr@@ acks in individual stones bear witness to weather damage , but the wall is not currently cr@@ um@@ bling .
a stead@@ y wall is a pre@@ requisite for a school yard used by students , which is guaranteed by the current for@@ ti@@ fications .
originally , the school court renov@@ ation was already in 2008 / 2009 planned , but high accidents were caused by the lack of planning .
an important word in the historical school wall renov@@ ation , which is even used for film sho@@ ts , is the national mon@@ ument office .
if the specifications are met from this site , the city hopes to be able to obtain grants from the monuments of the city .
the br@@ ä@@ un@@ ling@@ er primary school students , who have now returned to a well restored old school building with new a@@ ula , are now able to take advantage of the old school yard .
ö@@ z@@ dem@@ ir wants to offer jazz training in stutt@@ gart .
in the ongoing discussions on the future of music universities in bad@@ en-@@ w@@ ür@@ t@@ tem@@ berg , the focus has now also been on ce@@ m ö@@ z@@ dem@@ ir , the federal chairman of the greens .
&quot; i think it is wrong to take ho@@ lis@@ tic education in the stutt@@ gart university of music . &quot;
jazz and classical music are just part of the jazz scene in stutt@@ gart .
this is contrary to the view expressed by ö@@ z@@ dem@@ ir , who was in stutt@@ gart a fav@@ ou@@ ri@@ te for a direct mandate at the bun@@ de@@ sta@@ g elections on 22 september , of the green red state government .
this is pus@@ hing the european union forward on the basis of an expert study .
this will include the study program jazz and pop music by the musi@@ k@@ ho@@ ch@@ sch@@ u@@ le stutt@@ gart .
us border : &quot; super tunnel &quot; to s@@ mu@@ gg@@ ling drugs disco@@ vers that the police have been using the internet for the purpose of s@@ mu@@ gg@@ ling drugs .
on the border between mexico and the us , investig@@ ators have found a super@@ -@@ tunnel to s@@ mu@@ gg@@ le drugs and have closed down .
as the us customs authorities have said , the more than 500 metres long tube was between ti@@ ju@@ ana and san di@@ e@@ go with electricity .
three susp@@ ects have therefore been arrested , eight tonnes of mari@@ ju@@ ana and almost 150 kilometres of co@@ ca@@ ine have been conf@@ is@@ c@@ ated .
the tunnel was , according to the data , not yet used .
&quot; this car@@ te@@ ls are st@@ up@@ id when they think they could be under the rad@@ ar . &quot;
drug gan@@ gs are insu@@ red by du@@ ff@@ y : &quot; if you continue to use such tun@@ nels and try to use them , we are determined to do so at a huge waste of your dir@@ ty money .
both the us authorities and mex@@ ic@@ an security forces are in a permanent state of conflict with drug car@@ te@@ ls .
since 2006 , mexico has received more than 7@@ 7@@ ,000 people in connection with drug crime .
designed by experts , the company is designed by experts and built by experts .
due to the complex equipment of the tunnel , the investig@@ ators assume that the tunnel is being built by architec@@ ts and engineers .
the track system was equipped to allow electrical and electronic control of the vehicle .
on the mex@@ ic@@ an side , access is in a building that is 80 meters from the border .
according to the authorities , a lad@@ der leads 20 meters down to the actual tunnel entrance .
the tunnel has a cross-@@ section of 1.@@ 20 meters height and 90 cen@@ time@@ ters width .
it would have been a good way of combating illegal immigration to the united states .
two susp@@ ects were arrested in connection with the co@@ ca@@ ine fund .
the third , a mex@@ ic@@ an , was arrested for conf@@ is@@ c@@ ating mari@@ ju@@ ana .
all three are in danger of being sent@@ enced to life imprison@@ ment as a maximum penalty , as officials have said .
since 2006 , eight such tun@@ nels have been discovered , and it was stated at the press conference in san di@@ e@@ go .
but it was the first time that in such a tunnel construction ko@@ k@@ ain was found .
co@@ ca@@ ine is usually produced in smaller quantities and not through tun@@ nels .
this shows the &quot; des@@ pair &quot; of drug gan@@ gs , whose traditional routes have now been cut off , bill clin@@ ton said .
they would do everything they can to get to the us .
the de@@ tain@@ e@@ es were not given details , at least one is mex@@ ic@@ an , as they were .
they must be pun@@ ished with prison sent@@ ences of up to ten years .
20@@ 14 , ge@@ is@@ inger festival is celebrated in the year 20@@ 14 .
the anniversary of the city of ge@@ is@@ ingen on the occasion of the 12@@ 50 .
return of the first docum@@ entary mention is still closer .
if in just over eight weeks the year is over , the anniversary year will be upon us .
ho@@ lis@@ tic and church house@@ holds were founded in 7@@ 94 for the first time .
a church was built in churches , in which both places are mentioned .
on 15 march , there will be an official start to the anniversary year , and as ho@@ stages are currently unable to hold , the conference will take place in the centre of the city .
in the course of the anniversary , several events are organised both in ge@@ is@@ ingen and in kir@@ ch@@ en-@@ haus@@ en .
church house@@ holds are held in july at a festival weekend from 18 to 20 july , the 12@@ 50 .
celebr@@ ating the return of the past .
on friday with a cere@@ mony , saturday and sunday with a celebr@@ ation around the church par@@ ish hall .
on this weekend of the festival there is also the church church of the house .
city music director ru@@ dol@@ f bar@@ th has written for the city on the occasion of the anniversary a composition of orders that is distributed to three dates .
on 21 june , together with the son@@ n@@ w@@ end@@ fe@@ i@@ er des sch@@ war@@ z@@ wal@@ d@@ vere@@ in , on 12 july in the arena with fire@@ works and on 13 december as the first concert of city music in the new fe@@ st@@ hal@@ le .
this will be presented in the anniversary year and will be celebrated in the official date of last september .
on the occasion of the ge@@ is@@ sing@@ er city anniversary , a new chron@@ ic@@ le is also being published .
&quot; but it should be a chron@@ ic@@ le not only of the spir@@ its themselves , but also of a printed work about the intellectual of today , which just for the sake of ho@@ stages , church house@@ holds , le@@ ip@@ zi@@ g , a@@ ul@@ s .

ge@@ is@@ ingen city was founded in a gift certificate , which was owned by the monaster@@ y of st. g@@ allen , in 7@@ 64 .
the document was written in churches ( haus@@ en ) , which was then a court place .
both communities are therefore in the same document .
the reason 20@@ 14 this 12@@ 50 year old celebr@@ ation , in addition , is also the local form 40 years ago .
council takes track systems into consideration .
should the rail pass be &apos; am h@@ ir@@ sch@@ en &apos; re@@ constructed in order to improve road safety ?
yes , the local counc@@ ils have decided .
sch@@ il@@ t@@ ach must pay eur 2@@ 20 000 for this .
deutsche bahn wants to be the k@@ ine@@ ti@@ sch@@ er bahn ( german railways ) for the coming year .
in particular , safety at rail cros@@ s@@ ings should be increased - regularly there are col@@ li@@ sions of trains across germany with other vehicles .
do the municip@@ alities agree to the conversion measures , they must pay one-@@ third of the costs , share the rest and pay the public rail and co@@ ven@@ ant .
sch@@ ill@@ ach city buil@@ der ro@@ land gri@@ e@@ ß@@ hab@@ er explained to the municip@@ al council the specific@@ ities of the ba@@ h@@ ü@@ ber@@ gan@@ g &quot; am h@@ ir@@ sch@@ en &quot; .
the city plans to build a new building in the same area as the tun@@ nel@@ mun@@ d , to the west of the railway track .
there are also large vehicles , such as those that transport long tim@@ ber , which could be in the case of counter@@ -@@ traffic without having to block the tracks .
gre@@ e@@ ks therefore proposed to create a necessary support wall so that the eu can be a source of energy for the next street in due course .
this was confirmed in the local council controversial , as some counc@@ ils have stressed the need for road traffic : thomas k@@ ip@@ p brought the public ’ s mo@@ od into question by saying that &apos; must we be held responsible for so few vehicles ?
may@@ or thomas ha@@ as opposed : the rail crossing &quot; h@@ ir@@ sch@@ en &quot; is regularly used for long-@@ tim@@ ber transport .
even wood from the field &quot; ku@@ h@@ bach &quot; is partially trans@@ ported over this route , because the up to 20 meters long vehicles will take the route at the h@@ ä@@ ber@@ les@@ br@@ ü@@ c@@ ke , because they are not turning into the main road .
in addition , the route serves as a re@@ rou@@ ting for those vehicles that do not have the option of using the tunnel if the main road is closed down , ha@@ as argu@@ ed .
it is clear that kir@@ ch@@ berg and sch@@ los@@ s@@ berg tun@@ nels will be re@@ built and refurb@@ ished , as is the case in wol@@ ver@@ h@@ ä@@ tte , the railway transition could be &quot; on the h@@ ir@@ sch@@ en &quot; for a longer period .
the counc@@ ils agreed to allow the commission to study the costs of the proposed broad@@ ening of the roads .
despite this , the reconstruction of the railway crossing was approved by a majority with the aim of ensuring that the necessary support wall was built in such a way that the city would be the next road towards &quot; ba@@ hn@@ ho@@ f@@ stras@@ se &quot; for encounter traffic if necessary .
the reconstruction of the railway crossing at the ger@@ be@@ re@@ i tr@@ aut@@ we@@ in could , on the other hand , lead to a quite different problem , which could affect access to the heavily increasing &quot; ger@@ ol@@ tz@@ h@@ ä@@ user &apos;s way &quot; .
the administration had completed the renov@@ ation plans of the railway from the engineering office bre@@ in@@ ling@@ er , as it had doubts as to whether the planned connection of the ger@@ ol@@ tz@@ h@@ ä@@ user was still possible without any problems .
the study concluded that the cost of the re@@ fund of the n@@ in@@ e-@@ fold costs of the road could be un@@ de@@ res@@ ti@@ mated .
the responsibility for this lies with the city as road building load carrier .
the reconstruction could therefore be a way of avoiding liability disputes .
since both the wood waste and the ben@@ ding in the current expansion state work , the new tim@@ ber should be given a special attention .
i would also like to mention the risk of a col@@ li@@ sion of the turn with a vehicle standing on the transition rather less than at other railway cros@@ s@@ ings , because the stop is located right next to the middle , which is a good connection .
even trains from the main station would have to stop at this point .
the majority of the population were in favour of the transition to this railway , as the city of sch@@ il@@ t@@ ach had to deal with the problem of se@@ ating vehicles , as the counc@@ ils said , since the railway was in a state of decline .
the fact that the committee considers the renov@@ ations to the railway cros@@ s@@ ings to be un@@ proble@@ matic is that they are carried out in front of the ku@@ h@@ bach railway , for which the agreements have already been reached with the railways .

dist@@ ant plan@@ ets , gra@@ vit@@ ational waves , or black ho@@ les - experts from the european space agency must be aware of two major projects .
30 proposals were selected , five were still in the race .
far worl@@ ds .
more than 1000 plan@@ ets in other stars have already found a@@ stronom@@ ers .
whether it is at least on some of these lives , nobody knows .
the choice is difficult : if you want to search for gra@@ vit@@ ational waves ?
or rather the origin of the co@@ smo@@ s ?
or according to ge@@ other@@ mal plan@@ ets , and perhaps ali@@ ens , discover life outside ?
these questions are being asked by those responsible for the european space agency es@@ a .
for your program &quot; co@@ sm@@ ic vision &quot; you are looking for ideas for two major space projects that make a decisive contribution to research .
the budget for such &apos; l missions &apos; is approximately eur 1 billion each .
the start is expected to be 20@@ 28 and 20@@ 34 .
in early september , the elite of the european world space research , meeting in paris to present proposals for such missions .
30 ideas were discussed , five of them are now in the closer vote .
many bodies have assess@@ ed the proposals to remove ho@@ ok in the researchers .
in the next few days , a final decision will be taken by the scientific program committee .
in total , four major issues have been selected by the es@@ a , to which the missions of the co@@ sm@@ ic vision programme , which was launched in 2007 , are to be found .
what are the conditions for the formation of plan@@ ets and life ?
the exact procedures for the formation of ster@@ ns from large gas cl@@ ou@@ ds - and thus also the emerg@@ ence of plan@@ ets that these stars circle .
a large infra@@ red tel@@ es@@ cope in the space could be this dark pen@@ etr@@ ation .
and when a star has a planet , under what circumstances can life arise there ?
to address this issue , 20@@ 17 will be the space tel@@ es@@ cope &quot; che@@ ops &quot; .
the possibilities are limited , however , che@@ ops is a small mission with a budget of eur 150 million .
with greater instruments , a@@ stronom@@ ers could explore plan@@ ets similar to the earth , and even the composition of their atmo@@ sp@@ he@@ res could be sear@@ ched for &quot; bi@@ om@@ ar@@ kers &quot; : g@@ ases that act as an indication of biological activity .
how does the solar system work ?
this issue , too , should ultimately be clari@@ fied as to what the pre@@ requi@@ sites are for life to develop .
the role of magnetic fields in a star &apos;s magnetic activity and the interaction of its magnetic field and the magnetic field it produces play an important role .
in our solar system these processes can be ex@@ em@@ pl@@ ary examined .
the &quot; solar or@@ bi@@ ter &quot; is the first step in the es@@ a mission in the m class ( there the budget is about half a billion euros ) for this issue .
the pro@@ be will start in 20@@ 17 and the sun &apos;s surface and activity will be closely monitored .
of great interest to researchers are also j@@ up@@ i@@ ter and its mo@@ ons .
you want to find out what role the giant planet plays in the development of the solar system .
the es@@ a provides for the first of the three l missions of the &quot; co@@ sm@@ ic vision &quot; programme .
the pro@@ be &quot; ju@@ ice &quot; ( j@@ up@@ i@@ ter ic@@ y mo@@ ons explorer ) begins your journey probably 20@@ 22 .
eight years later , j@@ up@@ i@@ ter was to capture the atmosphere of the planet and the ic@@ y mo@@ ons of europe , k@@ all@@ is@@ to and gan@@ y@@ med .
what are the basic physical laws of the universe ?
the space offers many possibilities to see matter in extreme conditions .
perhaps there are also differences that could affect physi@@ ci@@ sts ’ path to a new theory that includes the notion of “ the universe ” .
how is the universe evol@@ ved and what is it ?
before 13@@ .@@ 7 billion years ago , our co@@ smo@@ s was created by the big ban@@ g .
in addition to the material we are familiar with , from the stars , plan@@ ets and living beings as we do , there are dark matter , the gra@@ vity of which is gal@@ ax@@ ies and gal@@ ax@@ ies .
so far , researchers have not been aware of the physical laws that were in the first fr@@ action of a second of the big ban@@ g , nor of the dark matter that resulted from dark matter and dark energy .
with &quot; eu@@ c@@ id &quot; , es@@ a has already developed an m mission here , whose launch is expected to start in 2020 .
with a special tel@@ es@@ cope the pro@@ be is to determine the distribution of the matter in the universe for the first time in the sky , thus drawing conclusions about the nature of dark matter .
if you could go on the race , you can also try out the race .
of the 30 proposals , at the end of the selection procedure , only two will remain .
the best chan@@ ces of being granted as a l mission are , according to many experts , &quot; e-@@ lis@@ a &quot; , a sophisticated concept for demonstr@@ ating gra@@ vit@@ ational waves .
physi@@ ci@@ sts understand changes in the structure of space time that al@@ bert e@@ inste@@ in described almost 100 years ago .
they were proven to date .
el@@ is@@ a could do that , the scientists hope behind the project .
the mission sees a two-@@ way or three-@@ way detec@@ tor that can be used in space .
unlike the plants on the earth , it could also be gra@@ vit@@ ational waves , which are visible in the big ban@@ g , and thus create new insi@@ ghts on the emerg@@ ence of the co@@ smo@@ s .
four other proposals still compete for the second l mission : a large x-@@ ray tube , a large x-@@ ray tube called &quot; ath@@ ena &quot; , which is black sol@@ es , among other things , &quot; ic@@ y planet &quot; .
already reti@@ red are among other proposals for the sample re@@ transport from mar@@ s , for the research of mon@@ d , ven@@ us and as@@ ster@@ o@@ ids .
snow@@ den is ready to work with germany in terms of us surveillance .
ed@@ ward snow@@ den , the wh@@ ist@@ le@@ b@@ lower of the us secret service , has said that he is ready to go to berlin and to go to the german parliament .
german member han@@ s-@@ christian str@@ ö@@ be@@ le met s@@ no@@ w@@ den on thursday in russia , where he received asylum .
in a letter from snow@@ den , which was sent on friday from str@@ ö@@ be@@ le to the media in berlin , he wrote : “ even if the result of my efforts is demonstr@@ ably positive , my government is tre@@ ating a dis@@ sent as fa@@ i@@ th@@ ful opinion .
to tell the truth is not a crime .
the letter says that snow@@ den , who is convinced that the european union &apos;s support for the international community will convince the american government to stop the charge of him .
the us department of justice ’ s acc@@ us@@ ation includes sp@@ ying and the@@ ft of personal data .
the german minister for the interior , han@@ s-@@ peter fried@@ rich , said to time online : “ if mr snow@@ den is willing to speak to german representatives , we will find ways to make that possible . ”
relations between the us and germany have been shaped by the asser@@ tions that the n@@ sa has not taken the mobile phone from chancell@@ or ang@@ ela mer@@ kel .
thomas op@@ per@@ mann , the member who has been the secre@@ tar@@ y-@@ general &apos;s parliamentary committee , said that the opportunity should be taken to bring snow@@ den to bear as a witness if possible .
str@@ ö@@ be@@ le , a green member , published an image of himself and snow@@ den in his t@@ wit@@ ter feed .
he was arrested on his visit to russia by two german journalists .
str@@ ö@@ be@@ le explained that according to the law@@ yer of the former n@@ sa employee snow@@ den was not returned to russia , if he had left the country .
if snow@@ den in germany says , then he needs a re@@ assurance that he will be “ safe ” there , he says .
snow@@ den explains in his letter that he is committed to “ serious and continuing education . ”
however , it is affected by the global response to “ my act of political expression . ”
citizens around the world and high-@@ level politicians – including the united states – have been calling for the rev@@ el@@ ations of un@@ controlled systems of comprehensive surveillance as a failure to take account of the general public .
in his letter , snow@@ den made it clear to the german authorities that ‘ if the difficulties surrounding the humanitarian situation are resolved ’ .
fronti@@ er airlines charges a fee for hand luggage .
fronti@@ er airlines plans to provide up to $ 100 from passengers travelling to the us .
fronti@@ er airlines intends to provide up to $ 100 for a piece of hand bag@@ gage and $ 2 for coffee or lim@@ on@@ ade , even if in the announcement the aircraft will be delivered on wednesday .
the new fee applies to hand luggage in the luggage com@@ part@@ ment above the seat , small bags under the seat are still free of charge .
fronti@@ er explained that it is calculated to cost $ 25 when the fee is paid in advance and $ 100 in travellers who arrive only at the airport .
front speaker ka@@ i o &apos;@@ m@@ alle@@ y said that the fee of 100 us dollars targets is to make travellers who travel by car or by car .
“ we do not want to calcul@@ ate this amount ” , she explained .
airlines started to use the same system for the first and second checked bag@@ gage in 2008 .
passengers who tried to take them around are not entitled to any additional charges .
fees are one way of encouraging passengers to pay less for on@@ board .
o &apos;@@ mal@@ ley said that the new fee is not really about making money .
it is about the most loy@@ al customers of fronti@@ er , who have clearly expressed their concern about the growing difficulty of finding a place in the field above the seat .
passengers who wish to book their tickets on the airline ’ s website do not have to pay .
this means that a passenger on the boarding gate will be able to obtain a bag@@ gage at no charge , which is the next person but will pay $ 100 for a similar piece of bag@@ gage .
o &apos;@@ mal@@ ley explained that the website of fronti@@ er and the check-in procedures would be changed so that passengers could have access to the fee that they had to pay before they could get to the gate .
the new bag@@ gage fee from fron@@ ti@@ er will not enter into force until the summer , and there is no exact date yet .
passengers are often s@@ mil@@ ing about bag@@ gage supple@@ ments and other charges , but airlines like to resort to them .
they argue that the transport of luggage is money co@@ sting and passengers are paying for it .
many people on wall street view the new bag@@ gage allow@@ ance as a sign that the airlines have enough money to pay after years of losses to cover the cost of air travel .
most of them have , however , so far left their fing@@ ers on hand bag@@ gage charges .
spirit airlines inc@@ . has asked for a new contract to be signed three years ago for hand luggage and then alleg@@ ed air , again a cheap ticket .
the only other airline with such a charge is the hungarian wi@@ z@@ z air , explained the airline operator .
he estimated in a december 2011 report that the hand@@ bag@@ gage fee was $ 50 million ann@@ ually , and that it was $ 50 million a year .
so@@ ren@@ sen , who form@@ erly held a leadership position at mid@@ west airlines , was the first to be appointed to spirit .
“ the boarding process was one of the smo@@ o@@ thly running processes that i have been able to achieve in my career in aviation ” , said he .
i expected to be gn@@ ash@@ ing te@@ eth and hand@@ some discussions at the gate .
“ the plane was full , ” he explained , “ and the boarding was done as smo@@ o@@ thly . ”
fronti@@ er follows spirit also in the 2 dollars spent on coffee , tea , lim@@ on@@ ade or ju@@ ice .
the company stated that passengers travelling by lim@@ on@@ ade or ju@@ ice should be entitled to take the whole do@@ se and eat coffee free of charge .
water is still free .
us air@@ ways had a short time in 2008 to try to get money for soft drinks , but did not do so seven months later .
fron@@ ti@@ ers step , fees for hand bag@@ gage , if passengers are not travelling directly at the airline , is a step in the most recent direction to help customers to access their own website .
airlines pay online travel agencies such as or@@ bit@@ z between $ 10 and $ 25 per ticket sold .
this provides an incentive for all companies to make passengers buy directly from them instead of via an online travel agency .
fronti@@ er is , however , the most advanced in this area .
in september , the company started to offer a full range of services when booking online travel agencies , only half of the number of frequent fl@@ yer miles .
on wednesday , the miles were re@@ credited to 25 percent of the route .
a third party company ’ s flight number is charged with fronti@@ er over 1000 miles and provides customers with only 250 miles .
passengers can also travel to the airport only when they purchase directly on the fron@@ ti@@ er plat@@ z@@ . the ticket price is € 10 .
fronti@@ er has a loy@@ al customer base at its headquarters in den@@ ver , but the business is shr@@ in@@ king and the company is losing money .
the proce@@ eds went up by 9 % and flight capacity fell by 10 % .
republic has tried to make a lot of money available for the company &apos;s sale .
pro@@ ver@@ bs come from the bi@@ ble .
more than 40 women attended the last women &apos;s breakfast this year in the ev@@ angel@@ ical church community of bis@@ ingen .
theme of the day in the municip@@ al house were &quot; pro@@ ver@@ bs from the bi@@ ble &quot; and &quot; phr@@ ases from the middle ages &quot; .
z@@ ita kö@@ h@@ ler , the chairman of the church council , went to the church in a lec@@ ture on the bi@@ b@@ lic@@ al pro@@ ver@@ bs after the breakfast .
&quot; pro@@ ver@@ bs contain wis@@ dom , rules or war@@ nings &quot; , she explained .
she compared several pro@@ ver@@ bs with the corresponding bi@@ ble sites and explained the meaning .
she called pro@@ ver@@ bs such as : hol@@ z@@ au@@ ge be vig@@ il@@ ant , like sc@@ ales fall from the eyes , cast an eye on someone who gives his &apos;s the lord in sleep , his hands in inno@@ c@@ ence .
the reference number for the speaker was several times also advis@@ ed by the speaker to read the pro@@ ver@@ b .
the phrase from the middle ages was used by the church community council .
she explained the meaning and origin of the phr@@ ases she called &apos; brid@@ ges to the past &apos; .
finally , a ra@@ ff@@ le was lo@@ wered .
the prices were conce@@ aled on a table and were hum@@ or@@ ously re@@ written before they were handed over to the winners .
among the visitors of the breakfast round , the ci@@ vic candidates also mixed up with the may@@ or candidate roman wai@@ z@@ en@@ e@@ gger .
learning instead of unemployed : pilot project for un@@ skilled in tourism
at the mec@@ k@@ len@@ bur@@ g@@ is@@ che see pla@@ te@@ au , a pilot project was launched for the tourism industry .
under the leadership of the federal employment agency , 49 women and men who have already been recognised as un@@ skilled in the sector are to be trained to work for hotels and restaurants over three winter years .
&quot; what is new is that the six@@ -@@ month courses with degrees are ending &quot; , said car@@ men wi@@ ec@@ her@@ t of the working agency .
the benefits are varied : participants would not be unemployed , the companies would be given a training place , and the workers would be increasingly integrated into hotels and restaurants .
the project also includes the industrial and commercial chamber of new industries in neu@@ brand@@ enburg and the german hotel and restaurant association .
n@@ sa explains that an “ internal error ” and not h@@ ack@@ ers are to blame for the cr@@ ash of the site .
the shadow national security agency has said on the subject of the late friday that a mistake has made your public website for a few hours and not h@@ ack@@ ers , as was claimed online .
“ n@@ sa@@ .@@ go@@ v was a few hours away ton@@ ight , because during a planned update an internal error was occur@@ ring ” , explains the debian developer .
the problem will be fixed this evening .
the claim that the failure was caused by a distributed thought out in the form of a den@@ ial of service attack ( d@@ dos ) is not true .
in the early evening hours , online server tracking was listed .
previously , a n@@ sa spo@@ kes@@ man had declared to ab@@ c news that the sensitive internal network of the authority was “ in no way com@@ promised . ”
secret information is not in danger , according to the speaker .
at least one group of h@@ ack@@ ti@@ sts took up the claim to be the n@@ sa website with a d@@ dos attack .
such attacks are the target site with page views .
cy@@ ber@@ tac@@ tics are relatively simple and the attacks are not designed to prevent the internal network of the target system .
the former super@@ secret n@@ sa , whose n@@ ick@@ name was once no search agency ( no such authority ) , was found in the n@@ sa , which is now in the light of the public and is still known in recent months .
the growing contro@@ vers@@ y over the secret service promp@@ ted initial spec@@ ulation about whether the c@@ ess@@ ation today is the result of a targeted cy@@ per@@ -@@ operation .
slightly dec@@ lined , the number of people without jobs fell by 22 in october to 1,@@ 30@@ 7 .
although the 3.@@ 1 % quota is better than last year and the figure is better than it was in september , &apos; but we would have hoped for more &apos; , says mon@@ i@@ ka fel@@ der@@ -@@ bau@@ er , depu@@ ty managing director of the agency .
many companies respon@@ ded be@@ have in recru@@ it@@ ment .
one reason for this is according to fel@@ der@@ -@@ bau@@ er : &quot; we have hardly any skilled workers in the cra@@ fts , health and care of the elderly &quot; .
the hotel is located in the heart of the city , close to the main train station and the old town .
in mid-@@ december the winter season begins .

profit loss in bom@@ bar@@ di@@ er following a fall in supply and orders was a major problem .
the can@@ a@@ dian aircraft and railway manufacturer bom@@ bar@@ di@@ er inc mel@@ ted down the record 15@@ -@@ percent of the aircraft in the year 2008 .
bom@@ bar@@ di@@ er based in mon@@ tre@@ al also published no flight test data for his br@@ and-@@ new aircraft of the c@@ series and awarded no new aircraft .
on the ma@@ ide@@ n flight of the test aircraft a year and a half ago , only three more star@@ ters followed , which makes it question@@ able whether the test phase will be as planned .
the results were not as good as the forec@@ asts and led to a fall in the price of over 8 % on the tor@@ onto stock exchange .
camer@@ on do@@ er@@ k@@ sen , analy@@ st at national bank financial , reduced the amount of money he had received on thursday from the “ out@@ perform ” rating of “ sector perform ” in order to ensure that the share will be held in the next one to two quarters .
“ while weak@@ er delivery numbers for aircraft have been largely expected , the us economy has not bene@@ fi@@ ted from the development of margin@@ s in the transport sector , ” said do@@ er@@ k@@ sen in a customer letter .
we believe that bom@@ bing and the use of weapons to place new orders for the c@@ series will be re@@ sumed when the aircraft test programme is progres@@ sing .
if , however , no new orders are announced in the coming months , we expect the market to be more s@@ cep@@ tical about the program .
bom@@ bar@@ di@@ er hopes that the aircraft will be able to fly the company in the lower end of the market kat@@ ap@@ ul@@ ti@@ . he will be responsible for the aircraft &apos;s take@@ over .
the first test aircraft was delivered to the public in march and fle@@ w to the united states for the first time in september after months of delays .
but binding orders for the c@@ seri@@ es with 17@@ 7 moder@@ ately , as potential customers are based on the results of flight tests and see if they can make the alleg@@ ations of the company regarding fuel efficiency and cost savings .
there are currently 4@@ 03 orders and commitments from 15 customers and companies .
the ceo pi@@ er@@ re beau@@ do@@ in is confident that he will be able to complete his mission of 300 binding orders .
the management of the company assured analy@@ sts and media on thursday that the program would be included in the schedule .
“ the test aircraft is no longer on the ground than expected , ” said beau@@ do@@ in at a telephone conference and added , while the service life of the aircraft was ground testing .
each manufacturer is planning differently .
we have decided to fly the first flight and then to carry out a review period , which we have done .
this is happening throughout the flight programme .
the second of five test aircraft is expected to be delivered in the next few weeks , the remaining one shortly afterwards , as it was said from the company side .
yet analy@@ sts remain s@@ cep@@ tical about whether twelve months after the ma@@ ide@@ n flight the first customer will be a c@@ series aircraft .
bom@@ bar@@ di@@ er declared that it re@@ viewed the planning for the commission@@ ing ( ice ) and will carry it out in the coming months .
“ the slow progress of the flight test – even if it appears to have been inter@@ fer@@ ing with internal planning bom@@ bar@@ di@@ ers – rein@@ forces our view that commission@@ ing is limited to the first quarter of 20@@ 15 , ” said do@@ er@@ k@@ sen .
in the third quarter , with the end of september 30 , bom@@ bar@@ di@@ er ’ s net gain fell to $ 14@@ 7 million , or $ 8 per share , from $ 17@@ 2 million , or $ 9 per share , a year earlier .
the adjusted profit per share is un@@ changed at 9 c@@ ents .
sales were slightly down on the pri@@ or-@@ year period , from 4.@@ 2 to 4.@@ 1 billion dollars .
analy@@ sts had a profit of 10 c@@ ents per share and a tur@@ nover of 4.@@ 56 billion dollars , so th@@ om@@ son re@@ u@@ ters i / b / e / s .
the world ’ s fourth largest aircraft manufacturer states that it has already achieved 45 aircraft in this quarter , a drop of 57 in the last year .
net orders fell from 8@@ 3 aircraft to 8@@ 3 .
the order book in the aero@@ space division was € 1.@@ 2 billion on 30 september .
“ in the field of aero@@ space , the results were within the scope of our specifications , but the low order in@@ take and overall market conditions were dis@@ appoin@@ ting , ” said beau@@ do@@ in .
sales in the aero@@ space industry increased by € 1.@@ 2 billion to € 2.@@ 4 billion .
bom@@ bar@@ di@@ er , the world ’ s largest railway manufacturer , announced that sales in this sector fell by just under 11 % to € 2.@@ 1 billion .
the order book in the transport sector was € 3@@ 2.@@ 6 billion on 30 september , and was thus down slightly from 31 december .
the profit mar@@ gin in the transport sector was reduced by processing problems for some major contracts .
according to corporate governance , it will be a new target for the fourth quarter .
in the afternoon trading on thursday , the bom@@ bar@@ di@@ er share dro@@ pped by 8.@@ 5 percent and was 4.@@ 8@@ 3 k@@ w@@ h ( 4@@ ,@@ 8@@ 3 can@@ a@@ dian dollars ) , after it was announced that pat@@ ric@@ k pic@@ he@@ tte was on .
the braz@@ ili@@ an embr@@ a sa , the world &apos;s third largest commercial aircraft manufacturer and bom@@ bing company , is a major airline in the region .
usa : sho@@ ts at los angel@@ es airport in los angel@@ es
an unknown person took part in the meeting on friday morning ( local time ) at la@@ x airport sch@@ üs@@ se .
while the airport management is informed about short message services t@@ wit@@ ter , the commission &apos;s cont@@ en@@ der is in de@@ tention , he reported that the &quot; los angel@@ es times &quot; , the man is dead .
a security man has also been killed .
media also reported about several in@@ ju@@ red .
us president bar@@ ack obama will keep up the news of the situation , said the spo@@ kes@@ man of the white house , j@@ ay car@@ ney .
the incident occurred in termin@@ al 3 .
a travel@@ er told the channel c@@ n@@ n , many people had been pan@@ ic@@ king protection , and the news was that the internet was not working .
travellers would have sh@@ ed and children would have been we@@ pt .
among the waiting , pan@@ ic er@@ up@@ ted , many would have been hi@@ ding behind chairs for fear .
he has heard two sho@@ ts , says a travel@@ er of the &quot; los angel@@ es times &quot; .
a security agency staff member , t@@ sa , has committed a shot at the foot .
the scene is &quot; as in a movie &quot; .
after that he himself was brought into a security area , the man reported .
the sho@@ ts should be placed near a safety control area .
airport buildings ev@@ ac@@ u@@ ated
the hotel is very clean and the staff are very friendly .
hundreds of people were taken from the building in safety .
users published on t@@ wit@@ ter photos of a special command and a program on the ground .
as the airport management via t@@ wit@@ ter announced , the preliminary incident began at 9.@@ 30 am . ( or@@ t@@ ze@@ it ) .
the access roads have been closed , which has led to a rise in the back@@ log of the car .
except for land@@ ings , air traffic has been tempor@@ arily stopped , and that is what it was .
however , on c@@ n@@ n several plan@@ es were also observed at the start .
terminal 3 will be used by smaller us airlines , especially in the united states .
the la@@ x airport of los angel@@ es is one of the largest in the us .
co@@ ca@@ ine ad@@ dic@@ t who is a drug bo@@ ss in front of police investigation , must go to prison .
bas@@ har@@ at d@@ it@@ ta , 42 , gave information on sub-@@ world size ne@@ il scar@@ bor@@ ough further .
the law@@ yer was afraid to reve@@ al his secret drug ad@@ diction , and he could see his secret drug ad@@ diction brought to light .
he was arrested by the li@@ ver@@ pool cro@@ wn court to three years in prison .
a well-known criminal def@@ en@@ der who has a drug bar@@ on in front of a large police investigation because he is afraid that his secret police force will be lif@@ ted .
bas@@ har@@ at d@@ it@@ ta , 42 , supplied sub@@ world size ne@@ il scar@@ bor@@ ough with sensitive data .
the war , which crimin@@ alists call “ first-@@ class ” , is a very good example of how to protect the rights of the child in 2011 .
officials wat@@ ched the s@@ cru@@ b@@ bing of scar@@ bor@@ ough ( 32 ) three bags co@@ ca@@ ine at the house of the law@@ yer in black@@ bur@@ n , lan@@ cas@@ hire , ab@@ sent , while this with colleagues at a dinner .
the investigation brought to light the fact that d@@ it@@ ta regularly uses class a drugs .
over a period of eight months between january and august 2011 , he tried to dis@@ semin@@ ate un@@ law@@ ful information on the arrest of two men on behalf of scar@@ bor@@ ough and one of his partners .
all four susp@@ ects were arrested at that time by the police in the context of a major investigation into the her@@ o@@ in and co@@ ca@@ ine trade in lan@@ cas@@ hire , cum@@ bri@@ a , mer@@ se@@ y@@ side , ber@@ k@@ sh@@ ire and west .
together with 32 other people , they were arrested later , after the police had been arrested in a number of house sear@@ ches , her@@ o@@ in and co@@ ca@@ ine worth £ 1.5 million , and £ 200@@ ,000 in cash .
d@@ it@@ ta , 42 , gave information to the crimin@@ als because he was afraid that his drug ad@@ diction could be public@@ ized .
d@@ it@@ ta , who is responsible for the law firm for@@ bes sol@@ ic@@ itors in black@@ bur@@ n , was elected to the li@@ ver@@ pool cro@@ wn court in a three-@@ week term .
he gave a very good account of the co@@ ca@@ ine ownership during a previous survey .
the law@@ yer was transferred after the police had been informed in their investigations against scar@@ bor@@ ough .
two investig@@ ators followed the example of the susp@@ ect and saw that the susp@@ ect had become d@@ it@@ ta &apos;s house and had to take drugs with a pur@@ ity of 60 % in a black g@@ love under his gar@@ b@@ age .
shortly after he was dis@@ pat@@ ched , he tele@@ ph@@ oned scar@@ bor@@ ough regularly with d@@ it@@ ta , who was at dinner in the football sta@@ dium of black@@ bur@@ n ro@@ vers in e@@ wo@@ od park .
the law@@ yer returned home and he was returned to the hospital and then he was given nine communications between the two .
it was announced in court that d@@ it@@ ta was a “ regular consumer ” of co@@ ca@@ ine , after a test had been performed on class a drugs in his hair , his wal@@ let and on his credit card .
d@@ it@@ ta was later arrested , but refused to allow co@@ ca@@ ine to be taken and said that he had been in contact with the alleg@@ ed deal@@ er because he had lost his mandate .
during his arrest , d@@ it@@ ta sent his wal@@ let and tried to find a number of credit cards , including a few of the bank ’ s cards , and he was taken from a hair ’ s trial .
in police inter@@ ro@@ gation , he said that he was operating under his private address as well as in the work@@ place an office and clients would be prosecu@@ ted at home for legal matters .
it was announced in court that he was key players in the drug trade , some of which he had previously represented , following significant ar@@ re@@ sts and informed that what the results of the investigations had known about them .
prosecu@@ tor anne wy@@ te said : “ a criminal prosecu@@ tor is a criminal better than any other . ”
d@@ it@@ ta is accused of ab@@ using his position as a criminal def@@ en@@ der , as he has been too concerned with certain clients .
the relationship in question is not simply that of a drug deal@@ er , but of a drug deal@@ er who is a law@@ yer who is sup@@ plying drugs to his law@@ yer .
part of his communications was undoubtedly legitimate , because he was the law@@ yer of these people .
but that went well beyond the limits of a normal relationship between law@@ yer and client .
he was involved in police investigations to the extent that he could be allowed to continue to carry out criminal activities .
mr d@@ it@@ ta has now brought his profes@@ sion into dis@@ repu@@ te .
he was a member of the board of directors of the german bun@@ des@@ bank of the german federal republic .
d@@ it@@ ta pointed out any mis@@ conduct and claimed : “ if i were a corru@@ pt law@@ yer , i would be a corru@@ pt law@@ yer , and information to scar@@ bor@@ ough passed on to him , i would not spend 15 hours .

revolutionary work of the church music
to end the celebra@@ tions on the occasion of its 16@@ 0-@@ year anniversary , the song cr@@ ane dun@@ n@@ ingen will perform two services of wor@@ ship with the &quot; deutsch@@ en mes@@ se &quot; by fran@@ z sch@@ u@@ bert .
after the great success of the musi@@ c@@ als &quot; rock my life &quot; , which attrac@@ ted the spec@@ t@@ ators in the spring of this year , the song cr@@ ane will be ready for the end of the anniversary year .
on saturday , 26 october , this extraordinary exhibition will be held from 19 during the evening show in st. mar@@ tin@@ sk@@ ir@@ che dun@@ n@@ ingen and on sunday , october 27 , 2010 from 10@@ th to 15@@ th at the service in the city .
the so-called deutsche mes@@ se , with the original title &quot; sing@@ ing to celebrate the holy opera sacrif@@ ice of the fair &quot; , d 8@@ 72 , is a spiritual musical work of the compos@@ er fran@@ z sch@@ u@@ bert from the year 18@@ 26 .
the exhibition will be held in the framework of the services of wor@@ ship , as the or@@ dering party jo@@ han@@ n phili@@ p@@ p neu@@ mann thought .
under the direction of her@@ mann sch@@ nei@@ der , the cho@@ ir is run by the br@@ ass group of the musi@@ k@@ vere@@ in fr@@ h@@ ro@@ sen@@ sin@@ n ten@@ n@@ en@@ br@@ on@@ n and no@@ em@@ i lo@@ ko@@ di at the or@@ gan .
has@@ l@@ ach : ske@@ p@@ tic@@ ism is increasingly turning into confidence .
with the elections to the par@@ ish council in 20@@ 15 , for example , the sou@@ l@@ ward unity of has@@ l@@ ach ( se ) will change fundament@@ ally .
there is only one common par@@ ish common interest , which is the same for all six par@@ ishes .
in a joint meeting on saturday , the bodies of h@@ as@@ l@@ ach , ho@@ f@@ ste@@ t@@ ten , m@@ ü@@ h@@ len@@ bach , fis@@ cher@@ bach , ste@@ in@@ ach and wel@@ sch@@ en@@ ste@@ in@@ ach prepared themselves for the changes .
the fundamental decisions taken by the di@@ oc@@ ese are nothing more to be changed and it is up to the par@@ ish counc@@ ils to decide on them as satisfac@@ tor@@ ily as possible .
during the day it was particularly clear : the s@@ cep@@ tic@@ ism about the new is hesit@@ ant but increasingly so of a confidence .
the ideas and expectations of the innovations in 20@@ 15 , as well as concrete proposals on the future composition and size of the par@@ ish council , were not enough to satisfy the most constructive discussions of the six bodies with the main members of the sa@@ il@@ ors .
regional de@@ an geor@@ g sch@@ mit@@ t explained , on the basis of a presentation , the new guidelines for sou@@ l@@ ward units in the arch@@ di@@ oc@@ ese of fre@@ i@@ burg .
the se has@@ l@@ ach is then a church community of the holy see , which is to be incorporated into the rights and duties of the six individual church communities to date .
there will only be a common par@@ ish council and a public prosecu@@ tor &apos;s council , in which the par@@ ish council is represented by the pri@@ est .
from every par@@ ish , at least two elected members should be represented , in the six par@@ ish counc@@ ils , so called community counc@@ ils are formed .
it will be up to them in future to make life in the church easier .
when it comes to the finances of the individual par@@ ish , there was a considerable need for discussion .
the new features provide that collected data will be used in the p@@ far@@ re@@ i@@ en for specific purposes .
the li@@ abilities are based on the entire community .
it is precisely with regard to the major investments planned , whose obligation would then be met by all par@@ ishes , that there was great concern .
&quot; in the past , too , only investments were made in projects that were supported by the individual par@@ ishes alone .
practical experience with a joint body for five par@@ ish pri@@ ests described b@@ é@@ ar@@ n rit@@ ter , the chairman of the board in the se@@ af@@ aring unit of rub@@ ble forest ne@@ ur@@ ie .
they had committed themselves to &quot; one shall be five , &quot; in 2006 , and they have found that this is not so easy .
the h@@ as@@ l@@ ach@@ er se@@ al unit bodies then made a commitment to answer the questions about the future composition and size of the common par@@ ish council and the practical work of the local teams .
the work is carried out in further meetings and in a further joint meeting of all six bodies in the coming spring .
in the end , the par@@ ish council of michael sch@@ ö@@ ner from ste@@ in@@ ach presented the new logo of the sou@@ l@@ ward se@@ al unit , which was approved by a clear majority .
in p@@ f@@ ul@@ l@@ endor@@ f , the electricity is more expensive than the electricity produced by the city .
the citizens p@@ f@@ ul@@ l@@ endor@@ f must rely on higher electricity costs .
as the managing director of the stad@@ tw@@ er@@ ke , j@@ ör@@ g-@@ ar@@ ne bi@@ as , confirmed to the south cou@@ ri@@ er , a four-@@ head@@ ed nur@@ se is coming up with a family of 70 to 90 euros extra costs per year .
the main reason for the upcoming price increase is the increase in the so-called ec lev@@ y of 5.@@ 2@@ 7.@@ 1 million tonnes , which is the equivalent of 5.@@ 2@@ 77 c@@ ents per kil@@ ow@@ att@@ -@@ hour .
this lev@@ y is calculated every october by the four operators of the major power routes .
these figures show that the energy turn brings them a lot of extra costs , which they will have to pay by means of a lev@@ y on electricity prices .
the city &apos;s p@@ f@@ ul@@ l@@ endor@@ f municip@@ alities are the last link in this chain .
the supervisory board of the energy company was not even convinced in its forec@@ asts of a higher lev@@ y , as j@@ ör@@ g-@@ ar@@ ne bi@@ as reports .
now the specific figures would have to be calculated before the city works begin to inform their customers about the exact price increase next week .
&quot; we are moving from an increase of 1 cent plus x , &quot; bi@@ as says , with the number more likely to be near the 2 cent .
traffic lights on permanent red : on waiting time , keep an eye on the traffic lights .
sometimes a traffic light is simply not green .
the contact loo@@ p in the street does not react , or the light sign is broken .
what should be done then - driving in red ?
if a long enough person has been interested in a red light and the crossing is free , the person can continue to speak , explains the stutt@@ gart legal advis@@ or .
the waiting time must be &apos; reasonable &apos; , which is a matter of course different from one case to the next .
bec@@ ker advis@@ es to wait at least five minutes before starting a dy@@ s@@ function of the lights .
if you want to make the trip despite red lights , you have to be aware that the journey is not necessary for a loss of time .
if you want to wait less than five minutes , you may not wait long enough to hear bec@@ ker and refer to a decision of the supreme court of ham@@ m .
the negotiated case has had a driver who , after about three minutes , had to ignore the lights permanently red and had to pay for a neglig@@ ent red light off@@ ence .
the traffic lights were not broken , but rather jum@@ ped little later on green .
a driving ban remained un@@ changed due to the particular situation - the fine was not .
the municip@@ al council is pleased with sound budget and the commission is pleased with sound budget .
whenever there is a par@@ ade in the council , it is the may@@ or of r@@ alp@@ h ger@@ ster who lau@@ gh@@ s well .
the par@@ ish bag in her@@ d@@ wan@@ gen@@ -@@ sch@@ ö@@ n@@ n@@ ach is well filled and debt has been un@@ aware of the administration since 2005 .
the 2012 budget year can also be seen as a complete success in this respect .
this was not taken into account when the annual accounts for 2012 were presented .
as andre@@ a ro@@ th@@ mun@@ d explained , the administrative budget is the lowest in the eu , with around eur 7.@@ 6 million .
the sur@@ plus of the administrative budget would also be around 1.@@ 8 million euros , which would be about eur 1 million .
it is thanks to the sur@@ plus , above all , to higher commercial tax revenues and the local share of income tax .
the asset budget was again significantly higher than planned .
instead of the eur 1.5 million envis@@ aged last year , it was eur 2.5 million .
&quot; this is essentially due to the higher feed from the administrative budget &quot; , says ro@@ th@@ mun@@ d .
as the 2012 budget year requires less investment than planned , the financial perspective is also less important .
overall , the overall reserve was reduced by around eur 2.@@ 1 million to a total of eur 4.@@ 9 million .
may@@ or r@@ alp@@ h ger@@ ster than@@ ked ro@@ th@@ m@@ und and her team for the good work they did .
&quot; such a work sha@@ kes not just out of the sle@@ eve , &quot; p@@ raised ger@@ ster with regard to the annual accounts .
he and the local counc@@ ils were obviously delighted with the good figures .
it may sound par@@ ado@@ x@@ ical , but it is precisely these good figures that could soon cost the public a lot of money .
the good financial situation has enabled the community to respond to high he@@ dge rates in the past .
this , in turn , has caused the ger@@ ster to receive subsidies from the country on many occasions .
the commission has already received eur 1.@@ 2 billion for these subsidies from various compens@@ atory po@@ c@@ kets .
among other things , the cities and municip@@ alities that apply for grants must be given certain le@@ verage .
&quot; the subject of ho@@ ists we have to look at , because in the coming years there will be investment for which we would like to have grants &quot; , ger@@ ster announced in this context .
n@@ ag@@ old : hu@@ go wer@@ m@@ ter has been working in the cho@@ ir for 60 years in the n@@ ag@@ old cho@@ ir for 60 years now in the cho@@ ir of the cho@@ ir of the cho@@ ir of the cho@@ ir .
at the age of 60 , hu@@ bert wer@@ m@@ ter ’ s story is very well known at the men ’ s sing@@ ing association ca@@ ec@@ ili@@ a for almost twice as long as that of the autumn festival , in which he was hon@@ ored .
hu@@ bert wer@@ m@@ ter was in the colours of his male sing@@ er as usual .
even after 60 years , he is still able to sing with the now more than ever be@@ loved cho@@ ir .
in the association wer@@ m@@ ter was also active , including for 28 years as a member of the committee .
for his commitment and uni@@ form@@ ity he received several awards : j@@ ör@@ g ko@@ hr , pa@@ stor@@ al@@ re@@ fe@@ rent on behalf of the ca@@ ec@@ ili@@ en@@ ver@@ band ro@@ t@@ ten@@ bur@@ g-@@ stutt@@ gart .
his sing@@ ers over@@ came him with the certificate of german cho@@ ir association ( d@@ f@@ g ) and a eng@@ ra@@ ved tin plate .
besides the hon@@ or , the 3@@ 1st autumn festival was held in familiar courses : with the m@@ g@@ v be@@ tra , the song cr@@ ane salz@@ stra@@ ten , the s@@ än@@ ger@@ ab@@ il@@ ty ba@@ is@@ ingen and the local music club .
the m@@ g@@ v ful@@ l@@ mar@@ ingen opened with atmo@@ sp@@ her@@ ic songs like &quot; im we@@ in@@ par@@ a@@ dies &quot; and &quot; fun@@ ny , her bre@@ thre@@ n &quot; .
her hon@@ or@@ ary sing@@ er hu@@ bert wer@@ m@@ ter was awarded the prize for a small stand - wol@@ f@@ gan@@ g am@@ ade@@ us moz@@ art &apos;s &quot; bun@@ des@@ lied &quot; .
the male sing@@ er association be@@ tra san@@ g also classical cho@@ ir sing@@ ing songs like &quot; j@@ ä@@ ger@@ wer@@ ben &quot; by ju@@ li@@ us w@@ eng@@ t , &quot; far , far away &quot; by hu@@ bert go@@ is@@ er@@ n and the fol@@ k song .
the song cr@@ ane salz@@ ste@@ t@@ ten created a new kind of music with its mixed cho@@ ir and its women &apos;s group - the imp@@ ul@@ se ch@@ or@@ us - for the women &apos;s quota of the festival .
the mixed cho@@ ir kid@@ n@@ app@@ ed the young and old with the ne@@ apo@@ lit@@ an fol@@ k &quot; santa lu@@ cia &quot; and &quot; evi@@ va esp@@ ana &quot; by an@@ tos g@@ us to foreign countries , while the &quot; imp@@ ul@@ se &quot; also took place .
the sing@@ er department of the ba@@ is@@ inger sport@@ vere@@ in came up with &quot; what the sw@@ o@@ b ? &quot; by h@@ ans s@@ ü@@ s@@ mu@@ th and robert pap@@ per@@ ts &quot; beer song &quot; .
for the children there was a small side program - &quot; grand@@ ma h@@ anne &quot; ali@@ as h@@ ann@@ el@@ ore st@@ ol@@ ste@@ im@@ er led a kas@@ per@@ l@@ theater and read a few stories about the children who had to do good at noon .
children ’ s dreams become true
the kin@@ der@@ gar@@ tens and day care centres in the z@@ ol@@ ler@@ n group are getting post these days .
the black forest wanted to create a new space for the building and the spar@@ kas@@ se z@@ ol@@ ler@@ al@@ b in cooperation with bau@@ haus and spar@@ kas@@ se z@@ ol@@ ler@@ al@@ b .

a jury composed of representatives of black forests bo@@ te , bau@@ haus and spar@@ kas@@ se z@@ ol@@ ler@@ al@@ b , choo@@ ses from all the entries three wishes .
what are the requirements for participation ?
the wish should be met with construction material worth a maximum of 2000 euro and at a ( action ) day .
furthermore , the winner must be responsible for many hard@@ working construction workers .
what about the day of action and the aid workers ?
bau@@ haus , with the support of the spar@@ kas@@ se z@@ ol@@ ler@@ al@@ b , makes the material available .
it will be in the children &apos;s garden on the agreed day and will be delivered directly by the help@@ ers .
help@@ ers can help parents , grand@@ parents , friends , clubs and , of course , educ@@ ators and children themselves .
ken@@ y@@ an press ou@@ tr@@ ages contro@@ vers@@ y about the media law .
“ we are in a fri@@ ghten@@ ing situation and we cannot afford to be mista@@ ken : what is parliament &apos;s position on this , and what is its intention , tomorrow , to simply abol@@ ish judicial independence ? ” the newspaper that published the draft law did not .
“ the law is dr@@ ac@@ on@@ ian and very criminal and we reject it , ” cy@@ r@@ us kam@@ au , managing director of the capital group , said .
he said that the new media tri@@ bun@@ al “ will always be pre@@ ju@@ dic@@ ed , because it is an extended arm of the government , ” and restrictions on content and advertising would be ken@@ ya ’ s position in the global economy .
&quot; i hope the president stops listening to us and we appeal to him to respect this bill .
according to the newspaper the star , the government is taking the initiative by means of the new law , ‘ the media effectively in a str@@ ang@@ le@@ hold ’ , whereas the standard , democracy and freedom of speech in ken@@ ya would have suffered ‘ a heavy b@@ low ’ and had dr@@ ama .
the adoption of the law is part of a series of measures aimed at improving national security following the attacks on the civilian population by armed islam@@ ists .
the ken@@ y@@ an media brought the an@@ ger of the authorities to light , because they were publishing rec@@ ord@@ ings of security cameras on which they saw the sho@@ ts of the police sent to the scene alle@@ ge@@ dly sho@@ oting the luxury shopping centre .
police chief david k@@ im@@ i@@ y@@ o re@@ acted with the in@@ scri@@ ption of two journalists and a leading media representative to negotiate .
under the new law , media houses may be subject to a penalty of up to 20 million ken@@ y@@ an sch@@ ill@@ ings and individual journalists may be prosecu@@ ted with up to one million , as well as the further risk of losing their professional recognition or being excluded from an official press release .
the tri@@ bun@@ al also has the right to refuse the pos@@ session of those affected if a penalty is not paid .
according to daily nation , “ one pun@@ ishment alone can kill most radio stations in bank@@ rup@@ t@@ cy . ”
moreover , the newspaper considers that these measures could have a dev@@ ast@@ ating effect on the situation described in her report as “ lively blo@@ go@@ sphere ” in ken@@ ya .
if you want to silence the media , you could be a politici@@ an with imp@@ unity whatever you want .
&quot; nobody will ever know , &quot; he wrote , &quot; mu@@ t@@ um@@ a ma@@ thi@@ u , journ@@ alist at the nation who was the ken@@ y@@ an media &apos;s decisive control factor in public life .
“ if politicians leave their own hands , they run the country into bank@@ rup@@ t@@ cy and us back to the hun@@ ters ’ and collec@@ tors ’ times , ” he comm@@ ented .
the ken@@ y@@ an legisl@@ ators have already , in the past , been making public an@@ ger .
in may they agreed to remove the restrictions imposed by the national compensation commission .

the importance for the city and the b@@ all@@ room was also lost by the official opening cere@@ mony for the kun@@ stra@@ ß@@ e sports grounds despite the cold weather and the rain .
a more pleasant celebr@@ ation had been held last saturday , and i think everyone would have liked peter to be part of it .
for example , all those who were unable to travel without a um@@ bre@@ lla or who had such a thing for some reason could not hold it .
this was the case for the musicians who had fr@@ amed the fe@@ st@@ act , just as many speakers did .
we@@ t was therefore also the f@@ c chairman al@@ bre@@ cht sch@@ len@@ ker , who was convinced of the ful@@ f@@ ill@@ ment of a dream .
his thanks were due first and foremost to may@@ or wal@@ ter k@@ lu@@ mp@@ p , who was responsible for the implementation of the project , the municip@@ al council , the companies involved and members of the association who took part .
here , in particular lo@@ th@@ ar her@@ o , paul we@@ iz@@ en@@ e@@ gger , he@@ iner ga@@ il and peter gra@@ f .
the ru@@ sty pen@@ sion@@ ers moved 400 square meters of pav@@ ing stones for the new paths .
this remarkable hon@@ or@@ ary commitment was also appreciated by the land@@ tag member kar@@ l ro@@ mb@@ ach .
further gre@@ e@@ ting words were also on behalf of the municip@@ al sports committee hu@@ bert ba@@ i@@ er , the district chairman of the south ba@@ i@@ er football association , kun@@ o k@@ ay@@ an , and fried@@ rich k@@ nor@@ r from the planning office .
may@@ or k@@ lu@@ mp@@ p remin@@ ded us that rec@@ ur@@ ring weather conditions are causing the climate to change in the spring and autumn .
as long as 15 years ago , the first consideration was given to resol@@ ving the problem when a third place was being built at the football club premises or at the real school at the sal@@ in@@ en@@ see .
both were rejected again .
six years ago , thoughts came to the creation of an artificial gr@@ ass sports site , which is generally regarded as the ultimate solution .
concrete plans were put in place two years ago , when the f@@ c opened the ch@@ ab@@ el room in pa@@ ste , and a cost share of eur 100 000 for the construction of the square was agreed and the country received funding of eur 10@@ 4 000 .
the council decided to set up a new administrative board in october 2012 .
the construction of the 68 times 10@@ 8 meters artificial gr@@ ass square began in the 4th of june .
during the three months of negotiations , the building of the building was completed by 3@@ 000 cu@@ b@@ ic meters of earth , half of which was used for the creation of a dir@@ t bike route .
union and sp@@ d have re@@ opened their coalition negotiations with the issues of justice and home affairs .
the competent working group on the subject came to this in the morning in berlin .
among other things , it is about direct democracy , members &apos; bri@@ ber@@ y and the federal police .
in the morning , the migration and integration working group also wanted to continue its work .
among other things , it should be a question of dual citizenship , which is a matter of oppos@@ ing views on both sides .

vienna airport creates passenger calls from / to vienna .
mr max ma@@ i@@ er , please come to gate 24 .
tell how this will happen in future at vienna airport .
most of the speakers are not connected to the key@@ board , but the noise level is to be lo@@ wered so clearly .
a more relaxed atmosphere , is the aim of this innovation .
like air@@ port@@ -@@ spo@@ kes@@ men peter kle@@ em@@ ann , the german radio vienna airport is the location of transit traffic in vienna , which affects individuals , an international trend .
for example , the airports in copenhagen , frankfurt or dublin already do not have the noise pollution caused by the air traffic .
by elimin@@ ating these ver@@ dic@@ ts - on average , the sound of the sun will be around 200 personal calls per day - the lou@@ d@@ speaker will be more quiet at the airport .
&quot; it has also proved itself in experience that these individual fail@@ ures are relatively un@@ noticed , at the same time as all other information on changed flight paths or depar@@ tures .

on the way to their host families in we@@ y@@ mouth , mass@@ ach@@ us@@ et@@ ts , they learned to live in the black forest gy@@ m@@ na@@ si@@ um .
after eight hours of flight , we went straight to the bro@@ ok@@ ly@@ n bridge , which is a walk through the heart of the city , man@@ h@@ att@@ an .
the first step was to find a way to get to know the city , to see the world famous sky@@ line , which in the evening is a special attr@@ action .
the time shift has meant that the students had to wait almost 24 hours , but in accordance with the mo@@ tto &quot; the city does not sleep &quot; the day on times square was decided .
despite shut@@ down , the second day was the release of the stat@@ ue of liber@@ ty with a fer@@ ry and on foot .
then the financial centre was about wall street to be comm@@ em@@ or@@ ated on september 11 , 2001 .
on the third day , the students could enjoy the 3@@ 73 meters high view platform of the emp@@ ire@@ -@@ sta@@ te-@@ building .
after that , the hec@@ tic activity of the new york streets went over the ro@@ c@@ ke@@ f@@ ell@@ er center to central park , which is an ideal opportunity to stay short in the autumn sun .
after a short flight from new york to bo@@ ston , students are now in their host families and experience the atmosphere of the we@@ y@@ mouth high school .
this year , the name day of the holy hu@@ ber@@ tus will be celebrated in the par@@ ish church of st. mar@@ i@@ en on the h@@ ul@@ s@@ ber@@ g@@ stras@@ se .
st. hu@@ ber@@ tus was the s@@ aga of a rather ru@@ th@@ less hun@@ ter who was driven by a vision and later turned into the bis@@ hop of li@@ è@@ ge .
the j@@ ag@@ dh@@ ur@@ n group of hun@@ ters west@@ ph@@ alia , head@@ ed by bri@@ g@@ it@@ te k@@ lu@@ th , plays on par@@ for@@ ce@@ hor@@ n ( natural hor@@ ns in the mo@@ od it ) according to old french me@@ lo@@ dies .

the f@@ es@@ tive fair takes place on sunday , november 3 , at 11.@@ 30 a.m.
the newly designed g@@ los@@ sy cover with a new café .
one thing that is essential for staying and coming back .
one that has the name to make the program .
when dé@@ j@@ à v@@ u is the name of a psycho@@ log@@ ist , according to the le@@ x@@ icon , it is expressed in the feeling that a new situation has already been experienced or seen .
in the case of the visit of the café on the opera in the district town of kle@@ ve in si@@ gh@@ t-@@ seeing to the rhe@@ in-@@ wa@@ al university , there is no need for the pure dé@@ j@@ à v@@ u feeling .
after all , the café has exactly the same purpose : to make a real stay not only in thought , but also in hand , always repe@@ ating it .
because it &apos;s fun and just beautiful .
a look into the interior of the opera 8 gives the vie@@ wer a gli@@ mp@@ se of the city .
the ul@@ tra-@@ modern , but not cool , café atmosphere looks like a place to feel good .
the team will spo@@ il you with the foun@@ ders mir@@ j@@ am van der st@@ el@@ t and dani@@ el b@@ ü@@ tt@@ ner at the top with a wide range of coffee and cock@@ tail vari@@ ations .
there are also delicious ca@@ kes or individually stoc@@ ked fresh ba@@ ked bag@@ u@@ et@@ tes .
the owners , both 33 years old , have already established themselves before the opening of the lovely café at the opera , as a gastronom@@ ic name : in k@@ ran@@ enburg they conducted the &quot; art lounge &quot; .
from moving to kle@@ ve at the op@@ sch@@ la@@ g , the sympa@@ thetic caf@@ é@@ -@@ lovers are ho@@ ping for more audi@@ ences .
not least because of the university .
&quot; we don &apos;t have a specific target group , &quot; says dani@@ el b@@ ü@@ tt@@ ner .
instead , the two young students here want to address just as much as senior students and all ages in between .
speaking of caf@@ é@@ -@@ lovers .
the friendly in@@ hab@@ ited couple is behind the coffee house and the pleasure of the coffee .
enjoy the frag@@ rant hot b@@ low@@ ing in the various sp@@ ices of the house .
express software is a software company that speci@@ ali@@ zes in the development of the internet and the use of the internet .
dani@@ el b@@ ü@@ tt@@ ner is more likely to be the expres@@ so fan and mir@@ j@@ am van der st@@ el@@ t the cap@@ pu@@ c@@ c@@ ino drin@@ ker .
&quot; to do this , a bag@@ u@@ ette is my thing &quot; , she tells the n@@ r@@ z .
two events were also held in the bright café .
better said , one .
the ha@@ f@@ en@@ fest took place more outside - the café dé@@ j@@ à v@@ u bene@@ fi@@ ted from it .
but there was also the r@@ ing@@ el@@ nat@@ z@@ ab@@ end .
&quot; beautiful , successful and fun@@ ny &quot; , the two 3@@ 3-@@ year-@@ ol@@ ds found .
but not everyone else &apos;s business .
perhaps dani@@ el b@@ ü@@ tt@@ ner is not a very good fan of ev@@ ent@@ -@@ ab@@ en@@ den : &quot; you can &apos;t be sure to get all right .
and with an event i speak only the ones that are also interested in the special event .
therefore events will be the exception for us .
&quot; we want to keep the normal operation as little as possible &quot; .
in other words , dé@@ j@@ à v@@ u also stands for reliability .
as regards the quality of the products that are offered here , as well as the team and the beautiful surroundings at the op@@ sch@@ la@@ g in kle@@ ve .
the road , which is becoming more and more a gastronom@@ ic m@@ ile .
to the deli@@ ght of many kle@@ e , the guests from near and far and the students who will enjoy the ga@@ stro@@ m@@ ile and also the café dé@@ j@@ à v@@ u for themselves .

a day of thanks to m@@ g@@ v in din@@ ker .
it was the 16@@ 5th foundation festival to which the m@@ g@@ v &quot; fried@@ rich wil@@ hel@@ m din@@ ker &quot; was celebrated this year .
the club of the restaurant &quot; wi@@ do@@ w &quot; is located in din@@ ker geno@@ a , and all the guests enjoyed the harmon@@ ious atmosphere of the restaurant .
tradi@@ tionally , the festival of foundations is also the appropriate festival , to be hon@@ ored .
the special award &quot; sing@@ er of the year &quot; was also very pleased this time by the secretary ro@@ l@@ f wag@@ en@@ er .
&quot; you don &apos;t just have written a lot for us , but you have also won some la@@ ps for us , for which we thank you &quot; , says the chairman of the cho@@ ir er@@ ich sch@@ lo@@ t@@ mann .
the awards for participation in the performances of the cho@@ ir pro@@ ves by means of activity sh@@ ru@@ bs were awarded in this year to the cho@@ ir director di@@ e@@ ter schul@@ ze with 44 participants , followed by the hon@@ or@@ ary chairman hor@@ st pi@@ ert pi@@ bert pi@@ er@@ st pi@@ er@@ st pi@@ er@@ st pi@@ er@@ st pi@@ er@@ st pi@@ er@@ st pi@@ er@@ st pi@@ er@@ st pi@@ er@@ st pi@@ er@@ st pi@@ er@@ ner pi@@ er@@ st pi@@ er@@ ner pi@@ er@@ st pi@@ er@@ ner pi@@ er@@ st

a special thanks was given to the management board to the team of vere@@ ini@@ sw@@ ir@@ tin ange pi@@ er-@@ ri@@ b@@ bert , who once again created a menu of the extra class and passed to ger@@ da pi@@ er-@@ ri@@ b@@ bert for the table decor@@ ation .
the m@@ g@@ v &quot; fried@@ rich@@ -@@ wil@@ hel@@ m &quot; meets with its regular ch@@ oral re@@ hear@@ s@@ als every tuesday at 7.@@ 45 p.m. in the club lounge .
&quot; new s@@ wee@@ the@@ art vo@@ ices are welcome at any time &quot; , says sch@@ lo@@ t@@ mann .
un proc@@ laim@@ s new goals in poverty reduction .
the united nations is now starting to draw up a series of new objectives to meet the commitments announced twelve years ago .
in the run@@ -up to the un summit on sustainable development , which will take place in rio de jan@@ e@@ iro in the evening , austr@@ ali@@ an diplom@@ ats played a key role in pus@@ hing “ sustainable development goals ” that would em@@ ulate the 20@@ 15 .
they were included in the final draft of the document which was drawn up by world leaders , including mrs g@@ ill@@ ard , at the summit .
un secre@@ tar@@ y-@@ general ban ki@@ -@@ moon said at the summit that the time has come to “ talk about national interests . ”
“ i am pleased that the member states have agreed to reduce the burden of a process that is not only a matter of universal , sustainable development goals .
“ these goals are based on our progress from the millennium development goals .
i will spare no effort to resolve this issue , which i have been given by the member states , to re@@ affir@@ m our vision of sustainable development objectives , which are based on the success of the millennium goals . ”
even if the s@@ g achi@@ m / ba@@ den has been playing for four days without victory , the hand@@ ball ob@@ er@@ lig@@ ist still enjoys a good atmosphere .
this is where tra@@ iner tom@@ as@@ z mal@@ mon leaves no doubt at all .
all are still fully motivated to work on the matter .
nevertheless , i hope that we will finally win again .
&quot; because i know not even any@@ more how such a victory tas@@ tes &quot; , he exp@@ ects mal@@ mon to be a successful experience of his team .
even if the third league reserve is made up of fre@@ den@@ bec@@ k , there are no trees at the moment , mal@@ m@@ on is highligh@@ ting war@@ nings in advance of the index fing@@ er .
many players have left in the a-@@ ju@@ g@@ end .
therefore , you will be against your ex@@ -@@ co@@ ach especially motivated .
&quot; it is also important to see whether further rein@@ for@@ cement can be achieved from the first one , &quot; explains the s@@ g-@@ co@@ ach .
to finally get back to the track of success , the european parliament must be able to compete with the united states in comparison with previous appear@@ ances .
above all , in the coverage work and swit@@ ching game ha@@ per@@ te it finally took a huge amount of time .
the use of opportunities must definitely be improved .
i therefore hope that my players will be able to play their heads free during the short break .
safety concerns in moz@@ ambi@@ que are growing in the face of cl@@ ash@@ es between influ@@ ential figures and politicians who are influ@@ ential in the world .
thousands of people gathered in the centre of ma@@ pu@@ to under the wat@@ ch@@ ful eyes of the stat@@ ue of sam@@ ora mach@@ el , the founder of state and first president of moz@@ ambi@@ que to attend a rare public demonstration of peace calls .
“ we want peace again , we want stability , ” said van@@ ess@@ a de s@@ ous@@ a , managing director of an investment company .
for fear of the country ’ s future , it has replaced its business clothes with a t-@@ shir@@ t with the in@@ scri@@ ption “ we are calling for security ” in portuguese and has moved to the independence square of the capital on thursday .
for two weeks , there have been almost daily reports of cl@@ ash@@ es between government forces and ren@@ am@@ o , which have been one of the worst batt@@ les since the peace agreement more than 20 years ago .
ren@@ am@@ o was once a not@@ ori@@ ous re@@ bel movement , which initially was driven by white regimes .
after the 1992 peace treaty , it became an opposition party .
analy@@ sts believe that it is unlikely that the country will return to a full-@@ blo@@ wn conflict , but the recent events have left foreign investors and domestic residents wor@@ ried .
for the fa@@ st-@@ growing economy , there is a lot at stake , because the discovery of huge gas depos@@ its off the coast and coal depos@@ its in the nor@@ th@@ west could lead to investment of more than $ 50 billion by companies like rio t@@ into asia in the next few years .
the ruling fre@@ li@@ mo party , since 197@@ 5 the dominant force , and ren@@ am@@ o give themselves the opportunity to blame for the ten@@ sions .
ren@@ am@@ o claims that the government has not followed recent cl@@ ash@@ es by ref@@ using to sign up to its members in so@@ fal@@ a , a traditional high castle , on 17 october .
the attacks on the former re@@ be@@ ls es@@ cal@@ ated when government troops ren@@ amed ren@@ am@@ o bases in ath@@ ens .
the government gives ren@@ am@@ o the blame for the cl@@ ash@@ es and acc@@ uses the organization of att@@ acking soldiers .
president ar@@ man@@ do gu@@ e@@ bu@@ za has tried to raise concerns about inst@@ ability .
in comparison to af@@ p , the french news agency , he said on wednesday that d@@ h@@ la@@ k@@ ama had proven to be a “ lo@@ ser ” who “ lost all his remaining assets ” .
both fre@@ lim@@ o and ren@@ am@@ o stress that they have to avoid war .
but the concerns have increased since ma@@ z@@ ang@@ a began to speak with the words , ren@@ am@@ o is giving the peace agreement of 1992 .
the f@@ t-@@ t said that he meant that the fre@@ li@@ mo would not have been respected .
“ our vision is to re@@ start negotiations , and to do so seriously , ” said ma@@ z@@ ang@@ a .
earlier talks between the parties have done little to resolve the ten@@ sions that have ar@@ is@@ en as a result of a series of cl@@ ash@@ es this year .
“ we have two adult men here ( gu@@ e@@ bu@@ za and dh@@ la@@ k@@ ama ) who have the heads together . ”
none of them are good at negotiating , and none is prepared to make the necessary conc@@ essions .
ren@@ am@@ o , which is pressing for electoral reform , has already said that it will not be able to bo@@ y@@ cot@@ t the local elections in november .
presidential and parliamentary elections are planned for next year .
some comm@@ ent@@ ators have suggested the use of violence as an attempt to impose an ail@@ ing movement , but have not yet made conc@@ essions and financial conc@@ essions from the government .
ren@@ am@@ o ’ s electoral success has been shr@@ in@@ king since 1992 , while a ne@@ wer party , led by a former ren@@ am@@ o member , is demo@@ cr@@ á@@ tic@@ o de mo@@ ç@@ ambi@@ que ( m@@ d@@ m ) , pre@@ sum@@ ably improving .
ma@@ z@@ ang@@ a claims that gu@@ e@@ bu@@ za – whose re@@ sign@@ ation is due to begin when his second term ends next year – is the country ’ s democracy to destroy .
&quot; he does not want multi-@@ party democracy , he does not want transparent elections , he does not want peace , because he does not give up the presidency , &quot; says ma@@ z@@ ang@@ a .
it is un@@ clear what capacity ren@@ am@@ o has , but it has un@@ rest leading attacks on police stations and vehicles on a major north american highway .
most of the batt@@ les took place in the province of so@@ fal@@ a , which is a few hundred kilometres north of ma@@ pu@@ to , but in which be@@ ira is located , the port , the mining company like rio t@@ into and the city .
in june , rio inter@@ rup@@ ted the use of the railways for a month after ren@@ am@@ o launched an attack on the track .
ma@@ z@@ ang@@ a respon@@ ded cau@@ ti@@ ously to the question of whether ren@@ am@@ o would repeat this threat .
ren@@ am@@ o wanted to “ war@@ n the international community that things were going well in moz@@ ambi@@ que , ” ma@@ z@@ an@@ ga said .
the inst@@ ability has increased fru@@ stration with the government .
“ people think that the government and president are responsible for the country ’ s future and are the one who should be responsible for finding solutions to the problems , ” he explains .
om@@ ar sul@@ tan@@ e , a prote@@ stant , said that people simply wanted stability .
“ no one is interested in ren@@ am@@ o and fre@@ lim@@ o , they just want peace again and us@@ able roads , ” he explained .
children should be able to use my@@ ths and leg@@ ends as “ models for life ” , says a author .
the stories of th@@ or showed that “ gross violations of power do not stand a chance against cle@@ ver tr@@ ic@@ ks , ” and the ar@@ tus leg@@ end demonstrated that the power of the two is important .
many of the my@@ ths , however , are “ far too wild , too off@@ ensive , and in some cases dir@@ ty . ”
“ i find it wonderful that in america my@@ ths and torture are being used as part of education , ” said he .
i have been saying this for twenty years now as a plan .
he added that in authors and teachers , the authors of “ excessive di@@ d@@ ac@@ tic ” are not likely to “ complete ” children .
cros@@ s@@ le@@ y-@@ hol@@ land , the be@@ ow@@ ul@@ f from the ang@@ lo@@ -@@ sa@@ x@@ on language and author of the pen@@ gu@@ in book of nor@@ se my@@ ths and the british fol@@ k tal@@ es , explained : “ man kan@@ n man kan@@ n man kan@@ n man kan@@ n man man man kan@@ n man man man kan@@ n man n@@ u man man kan@@ n man n@@ u man n@@ u man n@@ u man n@@ u man n@@ u man n@@ u man n@@ u man n@@ u man n@@
perhaps the greatest difference between an adult author who is writing for adults and a author who is responsible for children is the author .
not everything needs to be simplified or added to the happy end , but there is an im@@ man@@ ent sense of good and evil .
the latter must be under@@ lined , by the history revealed , and must not be explained .
that is the old story of showing instead of telling .
han@@ s@@ j@@ ak@@ o@@ b is once again moving to fre@@ i@@ hof .
100 years ago , he@@ in@@ rich han@@ s@@ j@@ ak@@ o@@ b reti@@ red from his reti@@ rement in has@@ l@@ ach , and his last years were celebrated in the &quot; fre@@ i@@ hof &quot; on sunday .
the many spec@@ t@@ ators were impres@@ sed by the extremely lively scene game .
from the arrival to the award of honour citizenship , to his death , he had written a script and han@@ s@@ j@@ ak@@ ob@@ au@@ r alo@@ is kra@@ f@@ tz@@ cy@@ k .
mar@@ c@@ us z@@ ag@@ er@@ mann took the audience with him as spo@@ kes@@ man through the ten different scenes , explained inter@@ relationships and brid@@ ged jum@@ ps from youth to the near pen@@ sion@@ ation .
on october 22 , 19@@ 13 han@@ s@@ j@@ ak@@ o@@ b heim arri@@ ves in his children &apos;s heav@@ en , in his fre@@ i@@ hof .
and then the scene game began , in which alo@@ is kra@@ f@@ cz@@ y@@ k once again in his par@@ ad@@ er@@ ol@@ le as great son of the city sh@@ one .
sti@@ lec@@ h continued with the two-@@ whe@@ el@@ er and &quot; black forests fo@@ xes &quot; of er@@ ich bec@@ he@@ rer from m@@ ü@@ h@@ len@@ bach .
it was not only the audience with a lot of applause , but also his si@@ ster phili@@ pp@@ ine was welcome .
bil@@ ly sum her@@ mann understood that it was incredi@@ bly good to get involved in the role of the si@@ ster and he was a part of mil@@ ly sm@@ ith and ge@@ st@@ ure .
there are two different scenes of the game : the m@@ ü@@ h@@ len@@ b@@ ach@@ er farm@@ er &apos;s cha@@ pel played mat@@ ching music pieces and thus roun@@ ded off the performance .
the hon@@ or@@ ary citizenship was then given to has@@ l@@ ach ’ s may@@ or he@@ in@@ z win@@ k@@ ler , who was elected to the post of the then inc@@ um@@ b@@ ent , together with a part of the council .
their up@@ keep made the tri@@ -@@ king sing@@ ers , the han@@ s@@ j@@ ak@@ o@@ b , the tri@@ be of the new du@@ ke : &quot; o@@ h how beautiful , youth mem@@ ories are being restored to my own three-@@ king time &quot; .
with her song &quot; o jes@@ u@@ le@@ in &quot; they enjoyed the audience in the fre@@ i@@ hof as well as the stor@@ ch@@ ent@@ ag@@ sk@@ in@@ der with her l@@ oud &quot; out , out &quot; .
his criticism of the official church had been directed by han@@ s@@ j@@ ak@@ o@@ b at the time , as was his concern about the exc@@ esses in agriculture , the consequences of industri@@ alisation or the effects of war .
in the home , behind his gr@@ ab@@ bing cha@@ pel on the fire near ho@@ f@@ ste@@ t@@ ten , he found his rest .
&quot; an un@@ settled spirit finally had found its rest and was home fore@@ ver &quot; , said the author of the book .
i would like to congratulate and p@@ raise the audience for the performance .

if there is a wil@@ d@@ card procedure , there is no guarantee for the nec@@ k@@ ar gi@@ ants that they will be compe@@ ting less .
the bas@@ ket@@ ball project hamburg to@@ wers is not responsible for any application for a possible follow-up job .
&quot; we will not participate in the wil@@ d@@ card process , &quot; said former national player pas@@ cal s@@ coo@@ ter , who has been developing the concept for a professional club in the han@@ se@@ atic city since 2012 .
a first bre@@ a@@ thing was in lu@@ d@@ wi@@ gs@@ burg , however , not to be heard .
&quot; we did not deal with the wil@@ d@@ card procedure until we were clear that d@@ üs@@ sel@@ dorf was not granted a licence , &quot; said nec@@ kar@@ -@@ giant bo@@ ss alex@@ ander re@@ il of our newspaper .
until 23 may , au@@ c@@ tion@@ e@@ ers and au@@ c@@ tion@@ e@@ ers of d@@ üs@@ sel@@ dorf bas@@ ket can still submit documents to the arbitr@@ ation court and prove their economic su@@ it@@ ability .
so far , the r@@ hin@@ eland has been denied the license twice .

ha@@ i@@ ger@@ lo@@ ch : evening meal ca@@ ke is coming to the spo@@ t@@ light .
as a contribution to the 15@@ 0-@@ year anniversary of the ev@@ angel@@ ical church in ha@@ i@@ ger@@ lo@@ ch , the cultural and tourism office of the city de@@ votes the last of its public them@@ atic tours on sunday , 27 october , the evening meal .
after the visit of the nuclear cel@@ lar museum , the ha@@ i@@ ger@@ lo@@ cher period is to be considered after 18@@ 50 , as a ha@@ i@@ ger@@ lo@@ ch under pr@@ us@@ sian rule .
the crow@@ ning end is a visit to the evening meal .
the leaders of the country will get the story of the construction of the church and gain insight into the development of the go@@ spe@@ l community in a thoroughly and cul@@ tur@@ ally catho@@ lic area .
last but not least , the church also has a view of the church of the church , supported by wal@@ ter kr@@ ö@@ ll and geor@@ g hal@@ brit@@ ter .
it is a native language of the region of the famous milan pres@@ en@@ te@@ le of leon@@ ardo .
meeting point to the second half hour of guided tour is 15 : 00 at the nuclear cel@@ lar museum .
tickets are available at the ticket office of the nuclear museum .

representatives of the federal public prosecu@@ tor &apos;s office could either ask questions in writing or personally send questions to the 30@@ -@@ year-@@ old in russia .
this was reported by the inter@@ fax agency on the basis of un@@ named cir@@ cles , which were not familiar with the situation .
this is an issue that could be resolved at intergovernmental level , as it was .
a snow@@ den exit from russia is virtually impossible .
&quot; in this case , he lo@@ ses his refugee status , &quot; the agency quo@@ ted its source .
because germany is an ally of the us , snow@@ den threatened to withdraw from the country , saying that it would continue to be a member of the united states .

in a new ze@@ al@@ and town bur@@ t mur@@ o is considered a charming town .
bur@@ t is a her@@ bal , despite a heart failure .
with its savings , a few don@@ ations and a mort@@ gage on its old workshop facilities , the company is continuing to invest by ship to los angel@@ es .
after the film there is coffee , tea and ca@@ ke .
the sh@@ iny pi@@ ep@@ ses do not distur@@ b residents and residents of the area .
r@@ hen@@ us mid@@ g@@ ard also worked on land , and he was the first to do so .
they distribute the information coming from the ships on the half of the p@@ ile .
the company has several ei@@ gs at the site in the fire .
besides the coal import , r@@ hen@@ us mi@@ dr@@ as also uses the new win@@ dy drive system , which is also used in the production of wind tur@@ b@@ ines .
black sh@@ imm@@ ers the coal on the storage place in front of the di@@ ke .
two huge blue ti@@ ts of the ti@@ ts and the re@@ char@@ ge@@ able units distribute or re@@ load the coal here as needed .
every movement of the trans@@ shi@@ pment devices sounds a sh@@ iny warning sound .
&quot; the signals serve to provide security and are prescri@@ bed by law , &quot; says mat@@ thi@@ as sch@@ re@@ ll , managing director of r@@ hen@@ us mid@@ g@@ ard in wil@@ hel@@ m@@ sha@@ ven .
in case of un@@ favourable win@@ ds , this is unfortunately widely heard - and so there were already some complaints from people from the north of the city .
he takes the complaints very seriously and therefore i have cont@@ acted the people concerned , says the 4@@ 0-@@ year-@@ old .
in close consultation with the authorities , we are now in the process of drawing up the warning signals with technical measures more qui@@ e@@ tly .
i am also coun@@ ting on open dialogue with our neighbours in the future .
mat@@ thi@@ as sch@@ re@@ ll has a lot to do before the site .
with the expansion of the lower sa@@ x@@ ony bridge , r@@ hen@@ us mid@@ g@@ ard continues to rely on coal imports for power stations and is a major player in this sector in europe .
thanks to the 18@@ .@@ 5 meter deep@@ ened tan@@ k in front terminal , the c@@ aves can be used for long time now .
&quot; this year we want to be the 3 million dollar tur@@ nover in the en@@ velo@@ pe &quot; , says sch@@ re@@ ll .
in addition to the on-@@ site e@@ on power plant , import coal is going to power stations in the in@@ land region .
if the g@@ d@@ f su@@ e@@ z power plant is connected to the network , over 5 million tonnes of coal are imported per year in a realistic way .
the three ship lo@@ ad@@ ers on the bridge and the second transport band could transport up to 10 million .
bay@@ er@@ n bas@@ ket@@ b@@ all@@ er despite his first defe@@ at , optim@@ istic yet optim@@ istic , the german bas@@ ket@@ ball team won the first place .
even the first defe@@ at in the euro@@ league was won by the bas@@ ket@@ ball players of the f@@ c bay@@ er@@ n munich .
&quot; no one can for@@ bid us to believe that we are also against the best team in europe over the past two years , &quot; bay@@ ern@@ -@@ co@@ ach s@@ ve@@ tis@@ la@@ v pe@@ sic reported on the unfortunate 8@@ 3 : 8@@ 8@@ 8 .
we have sent the message : even in munich , bas@@ ket@@ ball exists !
when she first appeared in the european royal class , she sold her co@@ ins for a long time , and in the decisive stages of the show , they simply didn &apos;t have a clear answer .
the guests first created the piece of art , a 15@@ -@@ point back@@ log , 13 minutes before the end , and then transformed into a guided tour before pi@@ ra@@ eu@@ s could once again turn the game into a turning point .
&quot; we have been incredi@@ bly re@@ war@@ ded against the two-@@ time euro@@ league champi@@ on in the first place , but then again with a s@@ light mistake &quot; , said bay@@ ern@@ -@@ prof@@ i y@@ ass@@ in id@@ bi@@ h@@ i .
we are proud of our performance , but we want to win any game .

ben green@@ man : ten years of new york com@@ edy festival : the new york city com@@ edy festival : the new yor@@ ker
one might say that new york city is the birth@@ place of stand@@ -up cou@@ ples .
over the years , fa@@ ys innovation has been developed , as was the latest in the new york com@@ edy festival .
the foundation of the company is the foundation of the company &apos;s philosophy .
“ most of these head@@ lin@@ ers began to work with car@@ ol@@ ines and were then increasingly successful until they were released at some point , to be in a club . ”
we have designed this festival so that we can continue working with you .
at this year &apos;s event there are performances by w@@ anda sy@@ kes , k@@ ath@@ y gri@@ ff@@ in and bill ma@@ her as well as by &quot; stand up for her@@ oes &quot; , an annual music and com@@ edy show .
the festival also marks the world of com@@ edy .
a number of com@@ edi@@ ans who this year will be participating in the festival are about rather un@@ conventional ways to learn , such as broad@@ ca@@ sts on smaller tv channels such as com@@ edy central , f@@ x and spi@@ ke .
n@@ ick k@@ roll was born with a sit@@ com on cable tv ( the ir@@ onic sli@@ p of fant@@ as@@ y fo@@ ot@@ ball ) .
jen@@ ny s@@ late was at both saturday night live and the show at “ parks and recre@@ ation ” .
both k@@ roll and sla@@ ve and other young com@@ edi@@ ans with characteristic vo@@ ices ( the sur@@ real pes@@ si@@ mis@@ tic an@@ th@@ ony jes@@ el@@ nik , the ir@@ ony of the earth , based on r@@ aci@@ al themes w. ka@@ um@@ as@@ en@@ th@@ y@@ u ) are .
the largest mag@@ net of visitors to the festival is an interview : david ste@@ in@@ berg talks with lar@@ ry david .
ste@@ in@@ berg started as a stand@@ -up com@@ edi@@ an , but has become a respected tv and film director .
from 2005 to 2007 he held a television programme with the title “ sit down and watch ” .
the meeting takes place in town hall in the middle of man@@ h@@ att@@ an .
“ the city is definitely in the com@@ edy d@@ na of lar@@ r@@ ys gan@@ g ar@@ beit ” , said ste@@ in@@ berg .
he told me that if he is here , i go to see the gas stations between two buildings and think of : he@@ y , if i have to pay all my money , then live me .
iran happy with process of nuclear negotiations
iran is showing itself a week before the next nuclear meeting with the five un ve@@ to powers and germany is satisfied with the negotiating process .
&quot; after years , i have reached agreement with the international atom@@ ic energy agency to reduce the differences between the last few years . &quot; he wrote , &quot; the international atom@@ ic energy agency , mo@@ ham@@ med j@@ aw@@ ad s@@ ar@@ if .
it would be a long way to go , but the nuclear negoti@@ ator was not satisfied with the negotiation process and was also optim@@ istic that both sides would eventually reach a solution .
dr@@ ama in ur@@ u@@ gu@@ ay : young k@@ ills play@@ kam@@ der@@ a@@ den with mac@@ he@@ te and ma@@ che@@ te .
two children have died in ur@@ u@@ gu@@ ay of the murder of a 1@@ 1-@@ year-@@ old .
the two 14 and 12 year-@@ old bo@@ ys had invited their victims to meet them in bird hun@@ ting .
with mac@@ he@@ tes and k@@ ni@@ ves , the k@@ ni@@ ves armed the 1@@ 1-@@ year-@@ old and thre@@ w the cor@@ pse into the ground .
then they would have been in a work@@ ing-@@ class quarter playing football in front of their homes .
the cor@@ pse was used in the night after the village of cer@@ ro pel@@ ado , 15 kilometres north of the exclusive village of cer@@ ro pel@@ ado .
as an ali@@ bi , a fi@@ ve-@@ year half-@@ si@@ ster of the younger , who had taken her with her , should say that she was sex@@ ually att@@ acked by the young .
but when the girl was exposed to the police without men@@ tioning a attack , she was not able to give up her .
the reason the older one called , among other things , a ri@@ val@@ ry in the football match .
it was initially transformed into a psy@@ chi@@ at@@ ric youth institute .
p@@ im@@ ps must be put in prison
because of explo@@ it@@ ative trafficking in human beings , p@@ im@@ ps , threats , insul@@ ts and dangerous physical in@@ jury , the kon@@ stan@@ z district court has appointed a 3@@ 3-@@ year-@@ old man from st. geor@@ gen to three and a half years &apos; imprison@@ ment .
the former german military soldi@@ er who was killed in afghanistan after two operations was a turkish figh@@ ter , laid the foundations for a united front within the framework of a process agreement .
so he has made women more aware of internet or telephone contacts in five cases , which he has not yet received after a few weeks against her will .
he was resi@@ sted by violence and threats to break .
women &apos;s income , which is partly due to him for years , is still very low .
conf@@ is@@ c@@ ation of mobile phones and si@@ m cards is a way to sub@@ ver@@ t women ’ s contacts to the outside world .
together with a colleague who has conve@@ yed the women , he brought them to various bro@@ th@@ els in the sou@@ th@@ west .
he was a member of the na@@ zi party , and was responsible for the war .
in court , the def@@ end@@ ant initially claimed that he was suffering from a serious tra@@ um@@ a after colleagues in afghanistan had been killed next to him in an explo@@ sion .
after a psy@@ chi@@ at@@ ric expert has had serious doubts about the psycho@@ logical constra@@ int and thus about a limited liability , the court of justice placed the 3@@ 3-@@ year-@@ old in a position to make a comprehensive conf@@ ession .
the court did not have to pay any more women who were in@@ ju@@ red .
like a cri@@ tic , the commission has been able to make a decision after a first call through telephone surveillance measures .
the inter@@ views were of high aggres@@ sion , and the council was not prepared to accept them .
in later inter@@ ro@@ gation , the in@@ ju@@ red parties would have confirmed their mar@@ ty@@ r@@ dom .
another witness , in which one of the women is blue on the whole body , was found up to now , not to say .
it is about &apos; a completely broken world of person@@ ality &apos; , which is condem@@ ning violence and exploitation in this profes@@ sion as normal .
the def@@ end@@ ant regre@@ t@@ ted his behaviour yesterday .
&quot; he has made himself out of these cir@@ cles and wants to be a normal life after the de@@ tention , &quot; he said .
oil prices continue to fall to $ 96 per bar@@ re@@ l .
the price of oil is still falling on friday , after concerns about a high supply cast a shadow over a report that says that the ener@@ g@@ y-@@ hun@@ gr@@ y manufacturing sector in china is growing .
the reference cru@@ de variety for deli@@ veries in december was available at the end of the morning in europe in electronic commerce at the new york mer@@ can@@ tile exchange by 14 c@@ ents to 9@@ 6.@@ 24 usd .
the treaty fell by 39 c@@ ents on thursday , which resulted in a price drop of 5.@@ 8 percent in october .
the large oil supply has the prices in the last few weeks .
the us department of energy announced on wednesday that the us supply had been increased by 4.@@ 1 million bar@@ re@@ ls last week .
over the course of five weeks , the offer was reduced by 25 million bar@@ re@@ ls .
but on friday there were indic@@ ations of increased demand by two reports on an increase in activity in chinese manufacturing .
this indicates a continued need for recovery in china ’ s economy , whose growth has been set to 7.@@ 8 % in the third quarter , after the previous year ’ s growth was at its lowest since two decades .

court blocks decision to stop the trial .
a federal court of appeal in the united states bloc@@ ked the order of a judge on thursday who had made changes to the stop and free@@ ze fund programme .
the second us court of appeal declared that the decisions of judge sh@@ ira apparently were not respected , until more than a appeal of the city was made .
the judge had a meeting in august , which was a for@@ tress in which the city was viol@@ ating the constitution and the way in which the programme for holding and inter@@ viewing people was implemented .
the city appe@@ aled against its assessment and the sub@@ ordin@@ ate re@@ medi@@ es that included the decision to establish a surveillance office to monitor the situation .
the court of appeal heard on tuesday the arguments for the requested suspension of the proceedings .
the appeal report stated that the judge must be informed of the case .
the judge had jud@@ ged that police officers should be in@@ ju@@ red in the civil rights of tens of thousands of people because they were being in@@ adequ@@ ately targeted black and latin american men with the st@@ alling code .
she appointed an external body to monitor the implementation of major changes , including reforms of directives , training and services .
in august , the city of new york agreed to extend the practice of stor@@ ing names and addresses of people who are still in the process of being re-@@ ex@@ tradi@@ ted after police control .
an oral negotiation to appeal to the city is not possible after march 14 , 20@@ 14 .
the stop and free@@ ze shops are a good example of this .
such controls have been in place for decades in various forms , but the number of checks recorded during the term of the party &apos;s may@@ or , michael blo@@ om@@ berg , has increased to an all-@@ time high of 6@@ 8@@ 4.@@ 3@@ 30 in 2011 , the number of latin america in 2011 .
in 2004 , four men representing all minorities were arrested and sent@@ enced to death .
ad@@ voca@@ tes of stop b@@ ail@@ outs should be encouraged to use the n@@ y@@ p@@ d ’ s stop@@ -@@ and-@@ fr@@ is@@ k program to stop un@@ fair practices and to build a more tru@@ st@@ worthy and effective police force , as well as the way of governing the way of the bureau .
oppon@@ ents believe that the changes will undermine the mor@@ ality of the police , but not crimin@@ ality ; nor would money be was@@ ted and the broader problem of a police force that is not resolved after thousands of police have dis@@ appeared in the last decade .
the judge has pointed out that the court of justice has not yet ratified the stop and fr@@ is@@ k practice , which is constitu@@ tionally based , but only the type of implementation of controls by the n@@ y@@ p@@ d .

with this be@@ dou@@ in wis@@ dom , the first chairman wol@@ f@@ gan@@ g hen@@ ne described the history and fas@@ c@@ ination of the association &quot; helping hands &quot; .
on saturday afternoon the 10@@ th birth@@ day of the club was celebrated .
the first chairman hen@@ ne reported in detail about the work of the association .
he was a member of the board of tr@@ us@@ tees of the european parliament in 2004 .
in the following years , further cooperation developed , and gy@@ na@@ eco@@ log@@ ist hen@@ ne led the field on several trips through numerous operations .
during the speeches , pictures of the operations were taken on a big screen , so that the guests of the ju@@ bil@@ ee event of the a@@ fore@@ mentioned actions can see themselves .
the deser@@ t vehicle of the association has also been shown .
it is a former parliament , which was built on the border .
ra@@ iner pre@@ w@@ o , the former o@@ b von n@@ ag@@ old , had proposed that this vehicle be equipped with photo@@ vol@@ ta@@ ic systems and plans to use the new photo@@ vol@@ ta@@ ic system according to hen@@ ne .
in 2008 , the zim@@ mer@@ e@@ i sch@@ le@@ e@@ h from ba@@ i@@ er@@ s@@ br@@ on@@ n received a total of € 3@@ 50 million in the record time of just under a week .
hen@@ ne also mentioned a new mo@@ ther@@ -@@ child hospital in n@@ ou@@ ak@@ ch@@ ot@@ t .
especially interesting in times when the world &apos;s birth@@ place clin@@ ic we@@ gra@@ tion@@ alis@@ es its birth .
you learn a lot in africa as a medical practi@@ tion@@ er , so hen@@ ne , for example , against bur@@ n-@@ out .
the political un@@ rest in the country has not allowed us to travel as many as planned , but many medical professionals came to germany to work here in various areas .
furthermore , contain@@ ers are regularly sent to africa with material , so in march this year medical equipment , medicines , associations material , health care beds and bri@@ g@@ ades .
the new album &quot; the best of the year &quot; is available in english and german .
as his personal mo@@ tives , he called his work in the field of aud@@ iting as a young member .
when he realized how much money was going to be lost , he decided to leave the african people with the task of controlling a budget by the people .
furthermore , fu@@ ch@@ tel stressed that global economics also includes global love for human beings .
it should not be forgotten that africa is closer than man@@ kind , either .
from gran can@@ aria it is not far to africa .
cou@@ l@@ son used phone h@@ acking for checking a tim@@ ing .
the former news of the word editor an@@ dy co@@ ul@@ son put the spo@@ t@@ light on “ telephone h@@ acking , surveillance , and confron@@ tation ” in an attempt to get a false tip about an aff@@ air of the former minister of the interior .
prosecu@@ tor andre@@ w ed@@ is q@@ c declared to the court in the old b@@ ail@@ ey , news of the world in may 2005 a false rum@@ or that the court would have rul@@ ed that clar@@ ke had a relationship with his “ attractive special advis@@ er . ”
the newspaper commission@@ ed the private detec@@ tive gl@@ en@@ n mul@@ ca@@ ire to investigate pa@@ w@@ l@@ b@@ ys vo@@ ic@@ em@@ ail@@ s .
“ the prosecu@@ tor ’ s office believes that cou@@ l@@ son , now the editor of the no@@ tary , is not a person who is in front of the house of people and hopes to bring them to life with fresh de@@ eds , but rather a person .
he said that no@@ th@@ w uses three methods to tell stories investi@@ ga@@ tive .
the publish@@ er is personally involved in the third method .
he obviously knows about the second , the monitoring , otherwise it cannot be .
what about the first ?
does he know about the telephone h@@ acking ?
he is argu@@ ing this , but we say , ‘ and whether he knew of it ’ .
rum@@ ors about an aff@@ air clar@@ ke were first published by the feature review .
a band with vo@@ ic@@ em@@ ail@@ s from your phone of at least three occasions was released in august 2006 in mul@@ ca@@ i@@ res apartment .
the investig@@ ators also found entries on the computer of the detec@@ tive , on which pa@@ w@@ l@@ by and their si@@ ster were called “ projects ” .
in the time when research was being carried out , the scientists received a lot of money from pa@@ w@@ l@@ by .
meanwhile , the us president , former chief editor ne@@ vi@@ il@@ le thur@@ l@@ be@@ k , and former chief executive officer of the united states , supervis@@ ed the surveillance of movements of pa@@ w@@ l@@ by .
on 18 june 2005 , cou@@ l@@ son left her a vo@@ ic@@ email with the following content : “ i have a story that we will release tomorrow .
e@@ is explained that cou@@ l@@ son &apos;s activities in this story followed the same pattern as in other important person@@ alities , such as the former interior minister david bl@@ un@@ ket@@ t .
the s@@ wor@@ n heard on thursday that cou@@ l@@ son bl@@ un@@ ket@@ t was being arrested for an aff@@ air with a married woman .
cou@@ l@@ son and bro@@ o@@ ks dis@@ agree with other con@@ spir@@ acies .

in protest against the planned re@@ ich@@ -@@ tax , the french football is indeed the first strike since 197@@ 2 .
a panel of experts will be working on the results of an arbitr@@ ation meeting .
in the conflict over the re@@ ich tax , the government and the professional football have been looking for a failed euro .
president fran@@ ç@@ o@@ is hol@@ lan@@ de received a hearing in the paris é@@ ly@@ s@@ ée palace on thursday , but he was not a member of the association and the association .
he refused to accept the mer@@ cen@@ ary football , and the planned 7@@ 5-@@ percent strategy was not accepted .
the opposite side , too , remained tough .
the commission &apos;s proposal for a strike to be announced at the end of november was also accepted , and the chief association of professional clubs ( uc@@ p@@ f ) , je@@ an-@@ pi@@ er@@ re lou@@ vel , announced .
the agreement reached between 29 november and 2 december is a major step forward in the li@@ gue 1 and li@@ gue 2 .
ge@@ ch@@ ingen : no absolute protection possible !
&quot; we want to inform the inhabitants of the planning process early on , &quot; may@@ or j@@ ens h@@ ä@@ e@@ ß@@ ler opened the citizens &apos; information event on the flo@@ od protection concept in ge@@ ch@@ ingen .
around 80 participants were involved in the municip@@ al hall to view the planned measures .
h@@ ä@@ ß@@ ler made it clear : &quot; the ultimate decisions shall be taken by the members of the municip@@ al council &quot; .
the floo@@ ds , the po@@ c@@ kets , which hit the island on 15 may 2009 , were a serious event .
a river bas@@ in study was linked to the neighbouring municip@@ ality of a@@ id@@ ling@@ en , which is now the basis for the flo@@ od protection concept in ge@@ ch@@ ingen .
&quot; protecting the largest number of buildings built is the goal &quot; , says ste@@ u@@ ß@@ ler .
the planning of the protection against a german weather law is based on statistics of every 100 years to expected floo@@ ds .
climate change is caused by a 15 % increase in the price .
in specialist cir@@ cles , this is done with &quot; h@@ q 100@@ ak@@ li@@ ma &quot; .
the water mass@@ es that were installed in ge@@ ch@@ ingen in 2009 caused considerable damage were in line with a 10@@ 00@@ -@@ year floo@@ ding .
&quot; absolute protection is not available , but a relative improvement can be achieved &quot; , says ste@@ in@@ ler .
to protect h@@ q 100@@ ak@@ li@@ ma protection , you must have a valid pass@@ port in g@@ ec@@ hen@@ gen , with the municip@@ ality having a national subsid@@ y of around eur 70 per cent .
h@@ ä@@ ß@@ ler pointed out , however , that it only gives support if a total concept is implemented .
the town is also interested in the participation of the citizens .
a complex and sophisticated planning and approval process is necessary to ensure that the necessary information is available .
at best , 20@@ 16 could start implementing it .
among other things , the protection concept , which was adopted in the municip@@ al council last week ( we reported ) , provides for local measures in the influ@@ x of ir@@ m river from the home of the tri@@ bal .
following the presentation of the flo@@ od protection concept , the participants took the opportunity to discuss their concerns .
among other things , it has been ques@@ tioned why more dam@@ s and re@@ stra@@ int pools were planned to protect the site .
gre@@ g@@ or k@@ ü@@ hn , the engine@@ er of the commission@@ ed engineering office forest and cor@@ be from h@@ ü@@ gel@@ sh@@ ei@@ m , who presented the concept , stressed that it was the interaction of all presented measures to be in the sum .
moreover , it is necessary to consider the most econom@@ ical solution , jo@@ achi@@ m wal@@ d and cor@@ be .
dis@@ pleasure was felt in the area of the al@@ t@@ tor , which was still very popular even in normal stor@@ ms .
the problem is known to the administration and the first measures have already been taken .
h@@ ä@@ ß@@ ler , however , pointed out that the guidelines for channel systems are different from those for flo@@ od protection and not to be conf@@ used .
the community is obliged to use the channel network in such a way that two to three years of reg@@ ener@@ ation can be comp@@ en@@ sa@@ ted .
the se@@ wage channels larger to dimen@@ sion@@ ing would dis@@ gu@@ ise millions .
the most serious in@@ ju@@ red following col@@ li@@ sion
on friday afternoon , the national road will take you to the village of rev@@ ens@@ dorf , 44 , where two drivers are seriously in@@ ju@@ red during a fron@@ tal col@@ li@@ sion .
the police sh@@ ut the street off immediately completely , but could be forced to leave little to the accident .
however , there are various testi@@ mon@@ ies that have only been evalu@@ ated .
it is clear that the 19@@ -@@ year-@@ old leader of a v@@ w golf is heading towards rev@@ ens@@ dorf and the 3@@ 8-@@ year-@@ old man from ge@@ tt@@ or@@ f is with her hy@@ un@@ da@@ i .
both vehicles had a cl@@ ash , with the woman being so hard hit that the fire bri@@ g@@ ade was bare@@ ly half an hour needed to get her out of the vehicle w@@ rec@@ k .
the actual cause of the accident was initially un@@ clear .
both failed to arrive in nearby hospit@@ als .
the track remained in full sw@@ ing for about two hours .
it could be called the do@@ sto@@ je@@ w@@ ski of the united states .
phili@@ p k. dic@@ k was a go@@ d@@ father , a me@@ ta@@ physi@@ c@@ ist , his nov@@ els and nar@@ ra@@ tives also have something ser@@ ial .
ast@@ on@@ ishing the kin@@ ship in the ou@@ ter : the g@@ lit@@ tering eyes , the be@@ ard , the high fore@@ head .
and so , as f@@ jo@@ d@@ or m. do@@ sto@@ je@@ w@@ ski with his massive o@@ eu@@ vre as founder and ap@@ po@@ logi@@ e of the russian soul , to understand , one reads phili@@ p k. di@@ ck as american pro@@ ph@@ et .

dic@@ k had wor@@ shi@@ pped on the subject of god &apos;s experiences , his late books read like a mix@@ ture of rev@@ el@@ ation of john and a computer manual .
perhaps he was cra@@ zy , drugs had left his brain .
he has cap@@ tured early on that the machines div@@ ini@@ ties are .
he wrote a the@@ ology of the computer and asked what a person would think of a machine that would be the cre@@ ator of his creature .
this is the bl@@ ade run@@ ner problem .

a master of science fic@@ tion .
a fantastic writer .
his stories have fil@@ m@@ directors such as rid@@ ley scot@@ t , paul ver@@ ho@@ ev@@ en and ste@@ ven spi@@ el@@ berg inspired .
this story is now particularly significant .
the &apos; minority report &apos; is from the year 195@@ 6 , it deals with the problems of the european union &apos;s cold war and the mc@@ car@@ thy crisis .
the principle of &apos; pre@@ -@@ crime &apos; is being developed here , &apos; pre-@@ crime &apos; , that is , what has now become more or less official doc@@ tr@@ ine of the white house .
in dic@@ ks , who are the most app@@ alling in the world , mu@@ t@@ ants look to the future - and the police are interven@@ ing .
&quot; we collect individuals who viol@@ ate no law whatsoever , &quot; said the author of the book .
&quot; we &apos;re happy to welcome you to our new website , even before you can commit a violent crime .
and : &quot; in our society there are no serious crimin@@ als , we have a criminal off@@ en@@ der full of pes@@ u@@ do@@ -@@ crimin@@ als &quot; , who read time flows .
they assume that the worst happens , and prevent the rest of the criminal idea from being put into practice .
dic@@ k ’ s nar@@ ra@@ tive looks like the blue@@ print for the anti-@@ terrorist laws and the inter@@ ro@@ gation of the n@@ sa .
anti@@ ci@@ pa@@ tion. the attack was not working like that , but obama ’ s dr@@ one philosophy and practice .
but th@@ ick ’ s story is not over yet .
the chief of police compla@@ ins that there is no separation of powers .

the system is turning .
it is perfect , but it lies .

the system creates the danger that it is fighting .
phili@@ p k. dic@@ k read is the word that is repeatedly being used to explain the truth .
late ca@@ th@@ ol@@ ics in russia testi@@ fy to mer@@ kel ’ s statements in russia that he has made statements in russia that he has not yet made statements in russia .
the former us intelligence ex@@ porter , ed@@ ward s@@ no@@ w@@ den , could be arrested in the us late opera for chancell@@ or ang@@ ela mer@@ kel .
representatives of the german federal bar could either ask questions in writing or answer the 30@@ -@@ year-@@ old personally in russia , the agency inter@@ fax reported .
previously , the green federal government member h@@ ans christian ha@@ hn had a job in the first german politici@@ an snow@@ den in moscow yesterday .
n@@ sa rev@@ el@@ ations strengthen corporate par@@ an@@ o@@ ia because of state surveillance .
the hotel is situated in the heart of the city , close to the train station and the train station .
at the federal office of the constitutional protection and counter@@ -@@ terrorism ( b@@ v@@ t ) , the german interior secre@@ tari@@ at , he should sign the um@@ bre@@ lla of the us out@@ post , which is less than 5 km away from the european central bank .
according to the german media , the b@@ v@@ t wanted to prevent the presence of surveillance an@@ ten@@ n@@ as and the action led to a change of words between the us and the german foreign ministry in berlin .
james cla@@ pper , u.s. director of the national intelligence agency , insi@@ sted in september that the us government should not allow for the foreign gaming industry to be sp@@ run@@ g . “ in order to keep the business secre@@ ts of foreign companies on behalf of us companies .
but since ed@@ ward snow@@ den , who has been a wh@@ ist@@ le@@ b@@ lower , he has been working with the publication of his hor@@ n of surveillance officers in the us .
reports that the american national security agency has called on the braz@@ ili@@ an oil company petro@@ b@@ as to take over the us security agency are being dis@@ missed .
the bar@@ re@@ l of over@@ flow brought the rev@@ el@@ ation that chancell@@ or ang@@ ela mer@@ kel ’ s phone was tw@@ isted , perhaps for ten years .
if the most powerful person in europe is targeted , then the most powerful people are certainly those who are in the process of achieving potential goals .
snow@@ den has been involved in intensive cooperation between us secret services and companies in a transparent manner .
i believe it is possible that this data could be used for mutual benefit .
“ germany must wake up , ” explains oli@@ ver green , president of bit@@ mi , the small and medium-sized it companies in germany .
german companies believe that the us has now been at almost the same risk as china in industrial es@@ pi@@ on@@ age and data the@@ ft .
in the snow@@ den mountains , the snow le@@ ak@@ ed documents have not yet shown that the european union is the world ’ s business secre@@ ts of foreign companies .
politicians have expressed concern that the eu ’ s policies are being followed by certain it and internet options and that they are reducing their dependence on the us .
companies are s@@ cep@@ tical about this .
in the bun@@ de@@ sta@@ g , it was proposed that we should build a german google .
i can only close my eyes and slowly open them again ...
“ that is not how it works ” , says h@@ as@@ so pl@@ att@@ ner , chairman of the german software manufacturer sap .
if we want a strong european it industry , then we would have no choice but to exclu@@ de it 20 years ago .
all in germany is subsid@@ ised , from coal to gas and from oil to agriculture .
everything except the it industry .
nevertheless , the scope and technical re@@ fin@@ ement of the s@@ no@@ ws ’ rev@@ el@@ ations have been un@@ covered by the snow@@ den rev@@ el@@ ations .
cl@@ oud compu@@ ting has a big change , because european business leaders are now more aware of how the global economy is changing .
according to a survey conducted by the cl@@ oud security alliance , a trading institution that conducted a survey on the security of the united states , the un@@ ve@@ iling of the us data mines caused a total of 200 000 deaths .
j@@ im sn@@ ab@@ e , depu@@ ty managing director of sa@@ p , says : “ we see a new question from customers who are looking for a year ago .
many german business leaders believe that the latest reports simply confirm that the company is doing what it already knew .
the fact that economic es@@ pi@@ on@@ age is taking place is no surprise .

parents of a te@@ en@@ ager from georgia who was born in tragic in@@ stances , were not convinced of murder , but of the murder of a child .
the parents of the te@@ en@@ ager , whose cor@@ pse was ro@@ lled in a r@@ ing@@ er@@ m@@ at in the gym of his high school , are also convinced that the child is mur@@ dered .
k@@ end@@ ric@@ k jo@@ hn@@ son from val@@ do@@ sta in the us state of georgia was arrested in a prison camp on 11 january .
the european parliament &apos;s investig@@ ating officers from the sh@@ eri@@ ff of low@@ n@@ des county concluded that the joint investigation of the situation in the country was a tragic one , which the family of the 17@@ -@@ year-@@ old had doubts about .
“ they are convinced that their son was mur@@ dered , ” said ben@@ jam@@ in cr@@ um@@ p , the law@@ yer of ken@@ ne@@ th and j@@ acqu@@ ard .
they would never have believed that he had died as he was .
&quot; they believe that it is possible to escape any logic , to fight against the laws of physi@@ cs as well as against common sense .
they are more convinced that the truth will be covered up to dis@@ gu@@ ise the person or person responsible for the death of their son .
&quot; her son went to school to learn and came to the body bag &quot; , comm@@ ented on .
us prosecu@@ tor michael mo@@ ore said on thursday that there will be a formal investigation into jo@@ hn@@ son ’ s death , because a number of important questions remain un@@ resolved .
what was the cause of death ?
is his death due to a crime ?
mo@@ ore declared at a press conference on thursday afternoon .
i follow the facts in which you are heading .
my aim is to find out the truth .
“ i take the view that a sufficient number of people should be provided with a formal basis , ” he said .
mo@@ ore told re@@ porters who were initially auto@@ pl@@ ating that the government would not be able to stop the war .
a second au@@ top@@ sy , however , has led to another cause of death , mo@@ ore argu@@ es .
“ there are a number of questions that need to be answered or confirmed , ” he said .
mo@@ ore added , if there are sufficient evidence for a criminal prosecu@@ tion or civil prosecu@@ tion , to the death of jo@@ hn@@ son .
a representative of the county sh@@ eri@@ ff@@ s authority was on our request on thursday .
a court in southern georgia ordered the death of the president on wednesday .
the parents of the te@@ en@@ ager said they hoped that the video recording would give evidence that the children had been caught .
c@@ dc publish aller@@ gen@@ ic guidelines for schools and schools .
on wednesday , the c@@ s@@ rs for education and training published a report on the progress of the european union in the field of health and safety .
these are the first such directives that the us government has issued .
one in 20 children in the united states has now become aller@@ gic to food .
the spread of food aller@@ gies among children has increased by 20 % between 1997 and 2007 , according to the c@@ dc .
the guidelines contain information for schools that are registered with the teacher and the staff for awareness of food aller@@ gies and how to deal with children .
it is also recommended that schools use ep@@ in@@ ep@@ hr@@ ine in advance – the auto invent@@ ory is a major part of the ep@@ ide@@ mic ’ s car injec@@ tion – to escape a potentially dead@@ ly over-@@ sensi@@ tivity reaction .
the legisl@@ ators in the federal states have recently changed the rules so that schools can use ep@@ ine@@ ph@@ r@@ in more easily .
the report also lists typical symp@@ t@@ oms , which are not understood by children , who have an aller@@ gic reaction .
children may say : “ it feels like it is something on my ton@@ gue . ”
parents of inter@@ sexual children can be ‘ gender un@@ determined ’ .
germany is the first european nation in which a third gender is responsible for children , who are living with un@@ clear gen@@ ital mu@@ ti@@ lation .
new@@ born children are no longer inf@@ ected with rigi@@ d male or female .
under the new law , parents no longer need to declare sex for such children , but can “ be un@@ defined ” or “ not defined ” on the birth certificate .
the aim of the law is to reduce pressure on parents to avoid sur@@ plus children .
an inter@@ sexual person said , according to bb@@ c years later , “ i am neither man nor woman . ”
i stay the pat@@ ch@@ work that is being carried out by doctors , but i am not being fo@@ ol@@ ed and full of sc@@ ars .
it is estimated that one in 2 000 children die each year , neither as a young nor as a girl .
they are among the inter@@ sexual , a group that is under the diagno@@ sis of ‘ sexual differenti@@ ation dis@@ order ’ ( ds@@ d ) , a collective body that is intended for people with at@@ y@@ pical ch@@ ro@@ mo@@ som@@ es , ger@@ ms and others .
val@@ ais simp@@ son was probably inter@@ sex@@ ually .
understanding the gender identification is even more important than understanding the gender dimension , but most experts in the us suggest that we should not forget the best available information on gender equality .
the new york psy@@ chi@@ at@@ ris@@ t dr. j@@ ack dres@@ cher , who has been focusing on the problem of gender identification , said that the new german law “ bl@@ ade after a good cause ” .
inter@@ sexual children are an ethical dil@@ em@@ ma .
“ some people have life@@ -@@ threat@@ ening diseases that cause a sur@@ g@@ ical intervention .
you can use gender as@@ sign@@ ment without sur@@ gery and then wait to see how the identity develops .
the scientific data on how a child can actually improve its gender identity is not very accurate .
no one knows why it is happening .
it is like the secret why people are hom@@ os@@ ex@@ ual .
in a report to the european commission in 2011 , it says that inter@@ sexual people are affected by trans@@ sexual violence or trans@@ gen@@ ic trafficking .
these characteristics were reflected in secondary sexual and psycho@@ logical characteristics such as mus@@ cle mass , male hair , and bre@@ asts .
the report also provides an overview of discrimination , which is becoming a reality in both inter@@ sexual and trans@@ gender people in professional life and the extent of har@@ ass@@ ment , violence and pre@@ jud@@ ice .
it is not the gender dimension that mat@@ ches the young .
in the meantime , it is available in australia and ne@@ pal for adults to work on official documents male , female or “ third gender ” .
in june , austr@@ ali@@ an nor@@ ri@@ e ma@@ y-@@ wel@@ by ( 52 ) was the first “ g@@ end@@ less ” person worldwide to be recognized after a court rul@@ ed that li@@ fel@@ ong re@@ tention of a “ un@@ defined ” gender status .
german cards have a number of different names in the future , in addition to m and w , x for inter@@ sex@@ u@@ ally , so the ministry of the interior .
in neighbouring france , gender issues are still a controversial issue .
in 2011 , do@@ z@@ ens of french members of the strictly catho@@ lic country signed a peti@@ tion calling for the “ gender theory ” to be removed from school books .
the us website catho@@ lic online has also opposed the german law .
the mother of a new@@ born mar@@ y@@ land said to baby zone , she caught the baby .
“ the parent is a child without any further restrictions .
children need stability and security .
histor@@ ically , children who have been treated with both male and female im@@ mun@@ e diseases have been treated as victims of her@@ ma@@ ph@@ ro@@ di@@ tes , after which attractive and attractive greek god , both sex@@ es had .
ten years ago , the medical community regarded the gender as something that could be wi@@ ped out and then re@@ built .
but the ethical foundations of an operation are now being ques@@ tioned , as it is now known how complex gender identity is , and that doctors are also being mis@@ led , because they are un@@ aware of how the child is performing .
“ in the middle of the 20th century , one called psy@@ chi@@ at@@ ric emergency , ” said dr. dres@@ cher .
if such a child was born , then one did not call the psy@@ chi@@ at@@ ris@@ t , but the sur@@ ge@@ on .
the prevail@@ ing theory about the treatment of children with un@@ clear gen@@ ital tissu@@ es is based on dr. john money of the jo@@ hn@@ s ho@@ p@@ k@@ ins university , who argu@@ ed that the problem of gender is formal .
he used the term “ gender identity ” and argu@@ ed that the social and environmental impact of gender violence was not the same as that of parents .
but in a document entitled “ john / jo@@ an ” , the european union ’ s foreign policy was not fully implemented .
he advis@@ ed the parents of a young boy whose pen@@ is was taken to a bot@@ ched cur@@ tail@@ ment .
“ money presented this case as a successful example of a transformation of the economy , which he was not , ” says dres@@ cher .
when the boy was about 15 , he changed back to the male gender and married the girl .
38 but he did commit su@@ ici@@ de .
according to dres@@ cher , there are still doctors who practice this model .
but in the 1990 ’ s , with the internet ’ s , survi@@ v@@ ors of these gender oper@@ atives were bound to the public , who “ did not feel happy with the outcome . ”
for example , at j@@ im bru@@ ce , a 36 year-@@ old writer from mon@@ tan@@ a who was born with x@@ y-@@ male ch@@ ro@@ mo@@ som@@ es , but ambigu@@ ous gen@@ ital gen@@ itali@@ a .
the doctors were un@@ clear about whether he would have a big c@@ att@@ or@@ is or a small pen@@ is , and were convinced that he could never have a “ satisfactory life ” as a man .
so his external body and the high level of the te@@ eth were quickly removed from the sur@@ gery shortly after the birth in 197@@ 6 , and he was raised as a girl .
at the age of 12 he was given female hor@@ mon@@ es .
“ i knew that i was not a girl , ” he told ab@@ c@@ new@@ s@@ .com that i was a girl .
i was un@@ happy , but it was really difficult to ask questions .
at the age of 18 , he was supposed to receive a v@@ ag@@ inal plas@@ tics .
but , as he was de@@ pressed and knew that he was not voting , he was@@ n ’ t asking for his medical records .
what he found was sho@@ cking .
i was born in ster@@ ili@@ zed – and nobody told me .
bru@@ ce was played by actor john mc@@ co@@ y .
after learning the truth , he changed his mind to the male identity , received te@@ sto@@ ster@@ on-@@ in@@ je@@ k@@ tion@@ en and settled his bre@@ asts .
the sur@@ gery has made it inf@@ er@@ tile .
today he is fighting for others in an organization called interface project to make inter@@ sex@@ u@@ als a nor@@ m .
but anne tam@@ ar@@ -@@ mat@@ tis , managing director of the california institute of technology , has been a major contribu@@ tor to the global information network .
“ many activi@@ sts are concerned that the german decision would encourage parents to make quick decisions and to give the child a , not fixed , “ he said .
we fear that this will favour intervention .
we think it would be better to leave the male or female gender in the same way and then wait for it to happen .
but we do not yet know how the law will affect , so we can only spec@@ ulate .
tam@@ ar@@ -@@ mat@@ tis said that her organisation supports the austr@@ ali@@ an law , because “ it allows adults to be recognised as a third gender . ”
“ adults should be able to make their own decisions about their legal gender . ”
the german law is about the allocation of funds to the birth .
this is not a battle to be won by small children at this time .
if you are grown up , you can decide for yourself on your body .
but dr. ar@@ len@@ e bar@@ at@@ z , a bru@@ stra@@ di@@ o@@ log@@ ist from pit@@ ts@@ burg , who was a daughter with a sexual differenti@@ ation dis@@ order and who had hundreds of others in a self-@@ help group , says that german law .
k@@ ati@@ e , the daughter of bar@@ at@@ z , was born with male ch@@ ro@@ mo@@ som@@ es , has a history of ds@@ d called complete and@@ ro@@ id resistance .
due to the reci@@ pe def@@ ect of the target cells for te@@ sto@@ ster@@ one , k@@ ati@@ e developed female characteristics .
it has a v@@ ag@@ ina , but not a u@@ ter@@ us and no ov@@ aries .
today k@@ ati@@ e 29 and married in 18@@ 48 .
it is inf@@ er@@ tile , but it hopes to be able to grow up in the future by adopting or a sur@@ ro@@ gate mother .
“ the law gives parents room , which means that they do not have to make ha@@ sty decisions , ” bar@@ at@@ z said .
it gives you the time to test different tests and to clarify things and gives you time to do them “ mal@@ es ” .
in this way , everything is fine – you pul@@ l the child big and lo@@ ves it .
the hotel is very close to the train station and the train station .
and you don ’ t have to do an operation too quickly that doesn ’ t go un@@ done any@@ more .
“ this includes the children in the decision and elimin@@ ates the fear that parents might be ex@@ ag@@ ger@@ ated because they believe that they are not doing the right thing , ” explains the children .
ultimately , the child deci@@ des on the gender that is better suited to it – and that is wonderful .
this will enable children to learn the decision themselves .
unknown are in@@ j@@ uring girls by shot from car .
unknown persons have no right to a twelve hour period in sa@@ x@@ on@@ y-@@ an@@ hal@@ t in case of sho@@ ts from a car .
the perpe@@ tr@@ ators had a chance to meet the police on thursday evening in gen@@ gh@@ in with an air pressure gun on a group of children .
this was reported by the police in burg .
the girl is easily left w@@ ade , and the woman is still in the street .
rescue forces brought the girl to hospital .
the shot came from a small car that was att@@ acked on a group of six children and suddenly was shot .
wit@@ nesses saw two people sitting in the car .
the perpe@@ tr@@ ators also shot at a bus stop .
a dis@@ c collap@@ sed .
then they moved .
the criminal police are investig@@ ating , it was said on friday .
until now , police inspec@@ tions at k@@ emp@@ ten have been able to access a quiet hal@@ lo@@ ween night .
officials were only sent@@ enced to eg@@ g children twice , who were forced to take them against house fac@@ ades .
since home@@ owners have recognized this in time and the iron cra@@ tes of the same distance , no material damage should have occurred .
furthermore , in the city area , some sy@@ l@@ ve@@ ster@@ b@@ ö@@ ller were ign@@ ited , but here too there is no material damage .
a living person in the bis@@ hop friendly village path reported that the village was closed with a monaster@@ y paper .
until the police arrived , the man took his whe@@ el@@ chair ap@@ er@@ tures in the immediate vicinity , however , all re@@ discovered them , so the police did not have to continue acting .
living with future prospects
wal@@ tr@@ au@@ d ries actually lives in a dre@@ am@@ like way .
your house is located in a quiet residential area of stutt@@ gart with lots of green , an old tree stock , nice neighbours and also not too much traffic .
the city is only a few minutes away by public transport .
&quot; i hope you will not be afraid of sp@@ id@@ ers ? &quot; asked wal@@ tr@@ au@@ d ries and shows on a f@@ at spi@@ der on the door frame .
i have been looking for a new apartment for my hus@@ band and myself for some time .
but you know how difficult this is in stutt@@ gart .
the reason is not sp@@ her@@ ical pho@@ bia , but the concern to be able to see the many steps to the house and the apartment at old age , explains her .
moreover , since a men@@ is@@ c@@ us operation , the mit@@ t@@ fif@@ ti@@ eth woman has had to learn what it means to deal with handic@@ app@@ ed people from the floor .
recently , a book was published by her on the subject of &apos; happy living in old age - what form of living is the best for me ? &apos; .
&apos;@@ our apartment is the best example of what is not possible in old age &apos; , begins to tell you .
when you were in the process of being in milan with your hus@@ band over 20 years ago , it was just a nice apartment in the middle of the green .
today , with the middle of fif@@ ty , wal@@ tr@@ au@@ d ries thin@@ ks differently about it .
but she also knows that she is one of the few people who has ever been involved in the subject of &apos; living in old age &apos; .
most people are dis@@ placing it as long as it goes .
the only old people are always &apos; , says she s@@ miles .
only when the pressure of suffering is really great will we be concerned .
&quot; then it can be too late , &quot; says richard wag@@ ner .
in her book , the interior architec@@ t presents 17 models of living for a self-@@ determined age .
&apos;@@ whatever accommodation you choose , however , is always an individual choice &apos; , explains it .
d i e solution there are not for age .
even those who have taken the reti@@ rement home in tus@@ c@@ any or brit@@ t@@ any can afford to pay more attention to the fact that they are also able to become ill .
and &apos; without good knowledge of the language , the agreement can also be reached in dol@@ ce vit@@ a , &apos; the specialist book@@ seller shall dis@@ continue the use of the language .
among their models , classic care@@ rs are available , alternative forms of living or the often quo@@ ted reti@@ rement w@@ g .
at age , everyone has their tic@@ ks and mac@@ es .
&apos;@@ for me , such a community would be nothing &apos; , she says with a win@@ k .
even less than in a student who is with a common bathroom and a kitchen .
&quot; in old age , you just need to have your re@@ treat rooms &quot; , ries says .
the fact that a senior community of residents can work , however , is something that the author does not want to exclu@@ de .
that should be done differently from what we have in the classical student world cup .
and sometimes you just want to have your rest , &quot; she believes .
this is the view that it has taken , at least in the capital of the country .
&apos;@@ most of the old people in stutt@@ gart want to stay in their own home as long as they go , &apos; is also the experience of the@@ res@@ a r@@ ü@@ t@@ ten , the head of the public service living at the age of the capital .
your service advis@@ es people around the topic of &apos; older people &apos; .
that is why it is the elderly who would often be exposed to in@@ convenience and restrictions , just to be able to stay in their usual environment , and that is also the experience of the wa@@ ren@@ test foundation .
there are many ways to make the house or apartment accessible today .
ries recomm@@ ends that all those who are concerned with the ag@@ e-@@ appropriate renov@@ ation of their home or apartment be aware of the fact that they are not the first to offer their cra@@ ft@@ sm@@ en a thorough job .
today , there are also plans for the ag@@ e-@@ appropriate reconstruction of the building .
even in the rental apartment , let one or other realize that and if it is only the toilet facilities .
but it is not always possible to use the existing flat to suit the age of the individual , and therefore to create the barri@@ er free of charge , even if it is still so beautiful .
wal@@ tr@@ au@@ d ries had to experience it .
although there is a tre@@ e-@@ li@@ fts in the apartment , which can be fitted with sta@@ irs , which can be pav@@ ed with sta@@ irs , it would be far more difficult to get around .
it will continue to search until you find the ideal object for yourself and your hus@@ band .
before moving gra@@ y it gra@@ y more than before the sp@@ in@@ ning on your home door .
the us wants to continue to prosecu@@ te snow@@ den .
the us has changed its stance on former us intelligence officer ed@@ ward snow@@ den .
he is still accused of being un@@ authorised to dis@@ close secret information .
therefore , in the us , he must face a criminal trial , as the us secretary of state , jen@@ ni@@ fer pr@@ ou@@ dly said , in washington .
the recent statements by snow@@ den would also be un@@ changed .
previously , the german green politici@@ an han@@ s-@@ christian str@@ ö@@ be@@ le had a meeting with snow@@ den in moscow after a meeting with the us to call on him not to continue to thre@@ aten him with pun@@ ishment .
p@@ sa@@ ki stressed that this is a flow of energy , which is a parliamentary expression .
intelligence rev@@ el@@ ers ed@@ ward snow@@ den is to be con@@ vers@@ ated with german authorities .
first , however , he wants to know his situation .
the report submitted by the united states has shown this to the former n@@ sa staff in a letter that was not addressed , which the green politici@@ an han@@ s-@@ christian str@@ ö@@ be@@ le sent on friday after a meeting with snow@@ den .
the letter has been written after a popular translation : the german word &quot; the english word &quot; .
i would like to ask the competent authorities to look at the relevant authorities in the member states and to see whether they can give them a clear answer .
i have been asked to give you a reply regarding your inquiry into mass surveillance .
i am a friend of ed@@ ward joseph snow@@ den and used to be a contractual partner or a direct employee as a technical expert at the national security agency .
in my employment in these institutions , i have witn@@ essed systematic violations of the law by my government , which , on a moral obligation , promp@@ ted me to act .
as a result of the publication of these concerns , i have been faced with a serious and persi@@ stent heat that forced me to leave my family and my home country .
i live in ex@@ ile at the moment and enjoy temporary work in the european union , which the russian federation has granted me under international law .
i am encouraged by the res@@ on@@ ance with regard to my political action , both in the united states and elsewhere .
citizens around the world and also high officials - including the united states - have been using the rev@@ el@@ ations to create a system of all-@@ en@@ comp@@ ass@@ ing surveillance that does not hold anyone accoun@@ table .
this sp@@ y rev@@ el@@ ation has attrac@@ ted many suggestions for new laws and policies .
the benefits for society from these acquired findings are not only being made clearer ; at the same time , the risks taken have been significantly reduced .
although the result of my efforts has been demonstr@@ ably positive , my government continues to be dis@@ s@@ ens as a loy@@ al and seeks to change political opinions .
nevertheless , to speak the truth is not a crime .
i am confident that the government of the united states , with the support of the international community , will aband@@ on this harmful attitude .
i hope that when the difficulties of this humanitarian situation are resolved , i will be able to support the european union &apos;s responsible efforts to clarify the facts relating to the humanitarian aid provided .
i look forward to talking to you in your country as soon as the situation is clari@@ fied and thank you for your efforts to respect international law , which we all have to protect .

report : obama campaign considered bi@@ den to be replaced by h@@ ill@@ ary clin@@ ton .
the clo@@ s@@ est advis@@ ors to president bar@@ ack obama have been thinking in secret , vice president jo@@ e bi@@ den in 2012 ’ s election campaign by h@@ ill@@ ary clin@@ ton , as the new york times put it .
the un@@ ve@@ iling is the most remarkable and most important surprise of the long-@@ awa@@ ited work by mark hal@@ per@@ in and john he@@ ile@@ mann on the campaign 20@@ 12 , “ dou@@ ble down ” .
times is an example of the dem@@ o of the upcoming release of the book and it reported that the first edition of the book was published on thursday evening .
according to jon@@ a@@ than martin , the national political correspon@@ dent of times , the book is thoroughly docum@@ enting the history of efforts by leading employees of the campaign and the white house , notably the former wh@@ ite@@ house ch@@ ile .
the potential change was a strictly guar@@ ded and un@@ restricted secret within the campaign infrastructure in chi@@ ap@@ as and the east coast of the o@@ val office .
only half a do@@ zen of the clo@@ s@@ est advis@@ ors to the president – including dal@@ ey , the former obama campaign leader , j@@ im mess@@ ina , and former chief advis@@ er to the white house , david ax@@ el@@ ro@@ d , and david p@@ lo@@ d .
in double down , the term “ dam@@ i@@ er ” is said to have led dal@@ ey in efforts to keep bi@@ den alive despite her “ close personal relationship . ”
in an interview with martin , d@@ al@@ ey confirmed that the government was indeed considering how to use bi@@ den by clin@@ ton .
“ i expressed a whole series of things that could be considered .
we must remember that the treaty of lisbon was a terrible b@@ low to the president at the time , so we thought : ‘ for god ’ s sake , what are we doing ? ’
while dal@@ ey described the investigations as “ due care ” , he said : “ we are not alone in the face of an@@ der@@ son co@@ op@@ er from c@@ n@@ n , that there was a considerable amount of effort during the re-@@ election campaign to find out if there was a result .
“ in campaigns , not so much money is spent on surve@@ ys and focus groups when you don ’ t seriously think about something , ” martin explained on ac@@ 3@@ 60 .
it is not clear , however , whether obama knew that his team would have an exchange in mind .
martin said to c@@ n@@ n that he asked dal@@ ey if his then colleague , the bo@@ ss , was concerned about the potential change .
although dal@@ ey said that he does not believe that the president of the possible change is “ aware ” , the former prime minister of the republic ad@@ mitted that it was “ possible ” for obama to have known about it .
martin added that “ dou@@ bl@@ ec@@ lic@@ k ” is not a defini@@ tive answer to the question of whether the political pro@@ vis@@ os of obama ’ s desk had reached .
co@@ op@@ er asked martin if he seriously thought obama had nothing to learn from the research that he had done to save bi@@ den in the elections .
“ possible ” , martin rep@@ lied .
what happens on the way with my email ?
e-mail is actually called electronic letter .
was the design of the internet service e-mail similar to the traditional post techn@@ ically the secret of letters ?
the design of early internet services focused on the need to make communication possible .
that is why the basic technical proto@@ col@@ s have not been designed to provide a stable foundation for a hear@@ ing-@@ safe exchange of letters .
therefore , a conventional e-mail correspon@@ ds more to an open post@@ card than a se@@ aled letter .
if user &quot; anna &quot; an &quot; to &quot; ben@@ ni &quot; sen@@ ds an email , the machines of the two are then directly connected ?
the email program or the browser of anna sen@@ ds a message to the user in the first step .
for example , if you have a g@@ mail account , google would be .
this mail server sen@@ ds the content to the provider you have requested , and the service provider ben@@ ni uses .
on the route , the mail can be sent via several other servers on the internet .
ben@@ ni@@ e can then search the content of the website for the content of the website .
are traditional e-@@ ma@@ ils being sent through the network ?
most ma@@ ils are sent by software robo@@ ts on the way .
the provider of the sen@@ der will usually check that the address is a ch@@ est of mal@@ icious files attached to the mail .
the recei@@ ver system also uses a virus scan@@ ner to check the data .
furthermore , the providers check whether they are a trou@@ bl@@ es@@ ome and un@@ wanted sp@@ am mail , which is deleted immediately or at least sent to a sp@@ am folder .
have the robo@@ ts yet another task ?
for systems like g@@ mail , the robo@@ t also determin@@ es the information that google uses to place context advertising .
if anna and ben@@ ni are notified via g@@ mail about their upcoming holiday , google may provide links to holiday offers .
read also unknown people who send e-@@ ma@@ ils ?
the prob@@ ability that un@@ authorized persons will receive a message is extremely low .
in theory , however , this is possible .
in companies , administr@@ ators often have the option of reading electronic mail .
law enforcement agencies and secret services have also provided legal opportunities to send e-@@ ma@@ ils or to take note of them .
in addition , there are possible illegal s@@ cour@@ ge actions .
is it possible to send e-@@ ma@@ ils against reading ?
encry@@ ption by open@@ p@@ g@@ p standard allows a mail to be effectively protected against read .
with a high technical effort it is also possible to re@@ tri@@ eve the met@@ ad@@ ata of an e-mail communication , so that not even can be easily identified who is communic@@ ating with whom .
how important are y@@ a@@ ho@@ o and google on the email market in germany ?
in the mostly priv@@ ately used mail@@ boxes , y@@ a@@ ho@@ o and google , according to a study conducted by con@@ vi@@ os consulting in august 2013 , only a sub@@ ordin@@ ate role .
while the shares of y@@ a@@ ho@@ o mail were down most recently , g@@ mail could be significantly increased by google .
mother dis@@ appeared in the forest and pension is cas@@ hed out .
when his be@@ ta@@ -@@ mother died , he for@@ ged a man from wol@@ f@@ sburg to make a plan .
he bur@@ ied the dead in a forest - and cas@@ hed out their pensions .
to continue to pay pensions and care money , the european union has set up a 6@@ 7-@@ year-@@ old wol@@ f@@ sburg to pay his mother &apos;s death after an investigation by the police in the forest .
first , he condemned the death of the 8@@ 9-@@ year-@@ old , then he spent more than a year and a half .
now the 67 year-@@ old has to be held responsible for fraud , as a spo@@ kes@@ man said on friday .
so the council &apos;s position hi@@ d the woman in a forest near hel@@ m@@ ste@@ dt .
susp@@ ected of being a man , he was arrested in may : at that time , the care@@ rs were denied access to medicines .
investig@@ ators told us that the pen@@ sion@@ er had been forced to go to spain .
because officials are cur@@ ious about this , they found that they could continue .
it was discovered that the two had been working in a joint apartment for more than 15 years and he kept them for the last time .
the 6@@ 7-@@ year-@@ old has finally recorded the death of his mother .
a ob@@ duc@@ tion was not reported by the police as a reason for capital crime .
want to eat ice cre@@ am , which is sh@@ ining in the dark ?
a british entreprene@@ ur has the first in the dark sh@@ ining ice .
char@@ lie franc@@ is made the flight to the city of florence by the flu@@ o@@ res@@ cent properties of sea animals and created a ligh@@ thouse .
the idea came to him after he completed a research on j@@ ell@@ y@@ fish and persu@@ aded chinese scientists to use the lu@@ min@@ ous prote@@ in arti@@ fici@@ ally .
the ice cre@@ am re@@ acts with the ton@@ gue when consum@@ ed , which reduces the ph value in the prote@@ in and the lu@@ min@@ air@@ e is tri@@ g@@ ge@@ red .
chr@@ is explains that the ice cre@@ am re@@ acts to the heat in the mouth and sh@@ ines – depending on the amount of lic@@ k , the bri@@ ghter it becomes .
char@@ lie , founder of the e@@ is@@ cre@@ me company , “ lic@@ k me i &apos;m delicious ” , says : “ the product is incredi@@ bly un@@ believ@@ able , but still in a very early production phase , and so you get two gram@@ s of it .
the ice cre@@ am used in the ice cre@@ am respon@@ ds with the ton@@ gue in a neutral ph value ph .
if the mouth is the prote@@ in war@@ ms , the ph@@ -@@ value increases and the ice sh@@ ines .
we have seen it in recent months and it seemed that we were ideally able to test it on hal@@ lo@@ ween .
it is probably the most expensive ice cre@@ am i ever made , because the qu@@ ell is the most expensive one .
each ball costs me about 1@@ 40 p@@ ounds .
but for this it tas@@ tes delicious .
char@@ lies experim@@ ental company based in bri@@ st@@ ol is famous for its innovative products and services .
but his latest creation is to be even more ambitious .
he says , ‘ i would like to see an invi@@ sible ice cre@@ am ’ .
that is in itself impossible because of the light re@@ fr@@ action caused by the ice cryst@@ als .
the ice cre@@ am uses the flu@@ o@@ res@@ cent properties of a j@@ ell@@ y@@ fish which is arti@@ fici@@ ally produced by chinese scientists .
the t@@ sv mor@@ sum has been released after six days of play , and is still in the hand ball league .
it is precisely now that the team of ing@@ o e@@ h@@ lers is coming to the der@@ by against the ts@@ v da@@ ver@@ den , which was on his first victory last weekend .
with this game the season begins new for us .
&quot; i hope that we finally have a head free &quot; , says e@@ h@@ lers behavior optim@@ istic .
he has finally started to play the game , with the exception of the permanent in@@ ju@@ red h@@ end@@ ri@@ k blo@@ h@@ me .
da@@ ver@@ den , like us , is rel@@ ying on speed games .
we must therefore reduce our error rate .
first and foremost , however , we must cover up , which is last anything but a safe impression .
the more relaxed way to get away from da@@ ver@@ dens co@@ ach thomas pan@@ it@@ z after the first season victory against n@@ ord@@ hor@@ n .
the game was of course a house number .
but that is why we are far from the fav@@ ou@@ ri@@ tes , because everything can happen at der@@ by .
however , pan@@ it@@ z wants to lay down in mor@@ sum to prepare a series .
the lack of jan@@ -@@ mal@@ t j@@ ad@@ at .
the a-@@ ju@@ g@@ end@@ lic@@ he jo@@ o@@ st wind@@ ß@@ u@@ ß , who is awarded the a-@@ youth league twice as a member of the german youth league , h@@ c bre@@ men , is celebr@@ ating its season de@@ but .
if you are not hot in such a game , you should stay at home .
hal@@ lo@@ ween 2013 : in figures for the 2009 financial year , in figures for the 2009 financial year , in figures for the 2009 financial year , in figures for the following year , in figures : in figures : in figures : € 2.@@ 4 billion .
when i was small , hal@@ lo@@ ween had some mag@@ ical things to do .
my si@@ ster and i were allowed to eat s@@ wee@@ ts late and stay late and we were proc@@ laim@@ ed for the neighbor@@ hood .
today i am more like the hal@@ lo@@ ween mu@@ ff@@ le .
over the last two years , i have not agreed to move from my apartment from s@@ wee@@ ts .
but , according to statistics , i am a black she@@ ep , which is a hal@@ lo@@ ween issue .
the majority of americans – 15@@ 8 million to be precise – celebrate this year hal@@ lo@@ ween and give their total 6@@ ,@@ 9 billion us dollars for south korea ’ s s@@ wee@@ ts , cost@@ umes , and decor@@ ations , according to the us secretary .
one thing i would like to focus on every hal@@ lo@@ ween is the fact that the trend values are .
the cost@@ umes are sold at about 1.@@ 2 billion of the 6.@@ 9 billion us dollars spent , according to the n@@ r@@ f .
this year , exciting new features are available .
women no longer need to be dres@@ sed in sex@@ y clothes , they can now also eat se@@ duc@@ tive food such as piz@@ za , ham@@ bur@@ gers or car@@ ro@@ ts .
as for men , i expect a lot of z@@ om@@ b@@ ies thanks to the walking dead , and i bet that the d@@ af@@ t pun@@ k space m@@ än@@ ner will be this year in the in@@ state test .
according to google , the most sought cost@@ umes are z@@ om@@ b@@ ies , bat@@ man , pi@@ rates and h@@ ex@@ en .
i susp@@ ect that there is nothing wrong with tradition .
we discussed our dogs last year .
indeed , americans spend $ 3@@ 30 million this year on cost@@ umes for their pe@@ ts , the n@@ r@@ f argu@@ es .
these are a lot of hot dogs .
as for s@@ wee@@ ts , we are not c@@ and@@ y .
americans will be paying $ 1.@@ 9 billion this year , the ni@@ el@@ sen company says .
this is about 2@@ 70 million kil@@ o@@ gram@@ s of chocolate , lu@@ t@@ ters , bon@@ b@@ ons and rubber b@@ alls .
so good news for the us department of commerce , which has 41 million people who are entitled to s@@ wee@@ ts or sau@@ res through the neighbor@@ ho@@ ods .
indeed , we will have over 40 million kil@@ o@@ gram@@ s of chocolate for hal@@ lo@@ ween and – let us not dec@@ ei@@ ve ourselves – we will eat .
the only thing we do not want to con@@ sume is the sweet c@@ and@@ y cor@@ n , yet 15 million kil@@ o@@ gram@@ s of it are sold around hal@@ lo@@ ween , the national association of conf@@ ec@@ tion@@ ery manufacturers .
that is about nine billion ma@@ ize gra@@ ins .
it is a myster@@ y that i have not yet been able to resolve .
nothing is more part of hal@@ lo@@ ween than houses where there are sp@@ ic@@ ed .
they have great names such as ‘ terror beh@@ ind the wall@@ s ’ ( which inci@@ dentally is in a real prison ) , ‘ ho@@ w@@ l ’ screen ’ and ‘ ho@@ w@@ l-@@ o-@@ scre@@ am ’ .
there are , in fact , 1,@@ 200 officially recognised sp@@ uk@@ k@@ houses in the united states , which have achieved $ 500 million in revenue , according to america ha@@ un@@ ts , and that includes the wonderful photos on which we have just been caught in pin@@ k .
but let us finally move on to the shor@@ ten@@ ed ones .
char@@ lie brown made us happy with the big k@@ ran@@ b@@ is when we were children , and cutting a shor@@ bis@@ hop &apos;s lan@@ ter@@ n is like decor@@ ating christmas tree .
fortunately , the “ baby began to grow in the pum@@ p@@ k@@ in trend only last year thanks to p@@ inte@@ st , so most of us grew up to take the pum@@ p@@ k@@ in back and not to be there .
this year , americans will spend about $ 10@@ 6 million on shor@@ ter spending , the us cen@@ sus bureau .
the pum@@ p@@ k@@ in lan@@ ter@@ n , which slowly ro@@ ta@@ tes in the front garden , is probably from il@@ lin@@ o@@ is , where this year 24@@ 5 million kil@@ o@@ gram@@ s of pum@@ p@@ k@@ in were har@@ ves@@ ted .
if you want to make a good point , call ti@@ m and sus@@ an ma@@ th@@ is@@ don in nap@@ a , california and car@@ ve something pretty .
residential fire in hel@@ mb@@ re@@ cht : rescue forces mountains hide ver@@ ko@@ h@@ l@@ te cor@@ pse .
the fire bri@@ g@@ ade had to be killed in hel@@ mb@@ re@@ cht on thursday evening .
a three-@@ family house in the district of hof begins at night to the friday fire .
the rescue forces are a source of coal light , and the people of the village are still living there .
rescue forces have a vital role to play in a fire in hel@@ mb@@ re@@ cht .
whether it is a resid@@ ent or a resid@@ ent , it is still un@@ clear how a spo@@ kes@@ man for the police in bay@@ re@@ u@@ th said .
on late thursday evening , it had a nice view of the old town of the hotel .
when the fire bri@@ g@@ ade arrived , the flag@@ s were already sm@@ ash@@ ing from a window .
the forces of intervention went into the apartment and found the cor@@ pse in a room .
this and another room completely bur@@ ned out .
the entire ground floor has been damaged .
all other inhabitants were killed during the fire .
the building was no longer in@@ hab@@ itable for the time being .
the exact cause of the fire was initially un@@ clear .
germany &apos;s largest national church has an off@@ ensive started , to fight for the profes@@ sion of pa@@ st@@ or .
the background is a possible par@@ ish short@@ age : the go@@ spe@@ l lu@@ ther@@ an church of st. han@@ no@@ ver is coun@@ ting on the fact that the number of its currently 1,@@ 800 pa@@ stor@@ alists is increasing .
for young people today , the profes@@ sion is very attractive and offers good prospects for the future , said pa@@ st@@ or ma@@ this bur@@ fi@@ en ( 43 ) in con@@ vers@@ ation with the ev@@ angel@@ ical press service .
it is attractive to increase the working and day@@ -to-@@ day flow itself .
bur@@ fi@@ a is the country church for the first time .
at present , fewer and fewer young people are op@@ ting for a university degree .
bur@@ fi@@ a is pus@@ hing this towards the process of dec@@ on@@ struc@@ tion : &quot; god &apos;s voice is quiet , the world is l@@ oud &quot; .
the profes@@ sion is of great freedom and diversity .
i am mr of my schedule and can &apos;t find my priorities there , where i think it is important .
pa@@ st@@ ors could be a sou@@ l@@ man very close to the people .
they earned so much as teachers and could well live from it .
i am sure that in the free economy more is paid , but the@@ o@@ logi@@ ans would have a safe employ@@ er .
this will help today &apos;s young people who are not only concerned with career , but also with a min@@ d-@@ filled job .
according to the national church , which is located in the region of three quarters of lower sa@@ x@@ ony , about 60 pa@@ st@@ ors are reti@@ red every year .
at the same time , about 40 gradu@@ ates from a the@@ ological college start their vi@@ k@@ ari@@ at .
in spar@@ sely popu@@ lated periph@@ eral areas , such as the res@@ in , the em@@ s@@ land or the w@@ end@@ land , it may be difficult to fill jobs in the future .
bur@@ fi@@ a wants to organise , among other things , student days for young people and also to invite prominent people to study the@@ ology .
the the@@ ology course offers a broad education .
it is even possible to become president of the federal republic .
land ro@@ ver r@@ ally series announced
the interior features rac@@ e@@ seats and six@@ -@@ point tables .
the options range from increased bra@@ kes , a service package with care for bow@@ ler drivers , and a service package with a full range of services .
dre@@ w bow@@ ler , managing director of bow@@ ler motor@@ sport , explains : “ the r@@ ally customers , who are becoming bow@@ ler , are now in a different situation . ”
they are not all experienced racing drivers , but people who are looking for exciting and exciting rac@@ es .
we are pleased to support this approach in partnership with land ro@@ ver and the m@@ sa and believe that the project format will open up new possibilities that will allow the various r@@ ally discipl@@ ines in the uk and abroad to experience and become new@@ com@@ ers .
we really enjoyed playing the def@@ en@@ der challenge in the car .
there are also a number of additional options for the def@@ en@@ der challenge : training and testing in february , as well as the option to participate in deser@@ t rac@@ es in north africa and the middle east .
fire bri@@ g@@ ade to save a bit@@ ch called , the 15 meters above the ground on a dangerous ground .
co@@ ck@@ er@@ sp@@ ani@@ el@@ -@@ bit@@ ch ru@@ by was born in the netherlands after a minor traffic accident .
three days later , she was accompanied by a wal@@ ker in the quar@@ ry in her un@@ favourable location .
fire@@ figh@@ ters ro@@ lled on ro@@ cky walls and saved the land from the fire .
the fire bri@@ g@@ ade succeeded in building a female in safety .
the nine months old co@@ ck@@ er@@ sp@@ ani@@ el bit@@ ch ru@@ by was born after a road accident on sunday afternoon .
scot@@ t al@@ der@@ son , 25 , and his gir@@ l@@ friend bec@@ ky hall , 20 , to whom the dog belongs , came to the quar@@ ry fla@@ pp@@ it in den@@ hol@@ me , west yor@@ k@@ sh@@ ire to make ru@@ by again .
they had desper@@ ately asked for their missing bit@@ ch .
about 14 : 15 pm on wednesday i saw a walk in the park , which was a bit of a bit of str@@ an@@ ded ru@@ by on the 15@@ -@@ metr@@ e high section .
the technical rescue team of cle@@ ck@@ he@@ at@@ on fire gmbh will be happy to assist you in finding the right solution for your problem .
and@@ y cla@@ y@@ ton , specialist in the technical rescue team , has said : “ you have been in a dangerous position .
it was in the middle of the cli@@ ff wall – 15 meters from the top and the bottom .
she did not move mus@@ cle during her rescue – she was like sti@@ ff@@ -@@ fro@@ zen .
but now she is doing well .
it then took a few dog ca@@ kes and she was very happy .
that was a rather unusual effort .
the fact that the dog was discovered is incredible .
peter la@@ u , specialist in the technical rescue team , has said : “ ru@@ by had a giant ship , but it is still a long way from being able to get it . ”
there was a possibility that they were very seriously in@@ ju@@ red or worse .
ru@@ by was elected veter@@ in@@ arian who was not allowed to take part in the research , but was not able to determine anything apart from exhaus@@ tion and de@@ hy@@ dr@@ ation .
bec@@ ky hall from h@@ ali@@ fax , west yor@@ k@@ sh@@ ire , said : “ at re@@ de@@ mp@@ tion , be@@ ware of the fear . ”
i could not believe that they were really up there .
it was wonderful to see you back in the arms .
the veter@@ in@@ arian said that , if exhaus@@ tion became too great and they had collap@@ sed , it would probably have fallen .
the fire figh@@ ters have done a great job .
it was really cour@@ ageous what you did .
we are simply so grateful and each of them was absolutely incredible .
scot@@ t al@@ der@@ son from ke@@ i@@ th@@ ley added : “ we had fear that the next time they would fall , but they remained on top . ”
the fire figh@@ ters were great .
i can hardly believe where it was .
mic@@ k j@@ ag@@ ger says he has kat@@ y per@@ ry never ad@@ mitted when she was 18 .
in an interview with an austr@@ ali@@ an radio station this week , the pop star said that she had been working as background sing@@ er at hun@@ ters song .
per@@ ry explained that she had been working with the al@@ tro@@ ck@@ er and that “ he had asked me to go to the hospital when i was 18 . ”
she added : “ this is a long time ago and he was very kind to me . ”
in a statement , a representative j@@ ag@@ ger , 70 , said on thursday that he was ‘ categ@@ or@@ ically denied that he had ever tried to seek rap@@ pro@@ ch@@ ement with kat@@ y per@@ ry ’ .

george ke@@ rev@@ an : european un@@ bun@@ d@@ ling gives the sco@@ ts the choice .
a new day , a new hor@@ ror story about independence .
this time we are war@@ ned that an independent scot@@ tish country is needed to protect the schengen area .
this provides the key word for stories about pass@@ port controls in ber@@ w@@ ick and a story written with bar@@ bed wire .
indeed , the road map shows that the council has not taken any account of the possible economic benefits of making travel more free with the rest of europe , but this has been , as expected , a key factor in the head@@ lines .
nor did anyone mention that eu member states often have to ab@@ ide by their strict rules , if there is any more favourable way for them .
as scotland is not currently a member of the schengen area , the continued non-@@ compliance with brussels would be a small conc@@ ession .
so really no story .
and one that has already been in the years that you already have a fo@@ ssi@@ l like : the first time i have seen the “ independence means pass@@ port controls ” -@@ duc@@ k at least 40 years ago .
an interesting point is the constant repe@@ ti@@ tion of this ancient story .
why should we expect an independent scotland to be a member of the european pi@@ pe ?
why the london yo@@ ke against the brussels embar@@ go ?
these are the real european news : the great , after the war , plan to un@@ ite europe has st@@ alled .
the euro crisis has brought the european project to an official stand@@ still .
across the eu , parties that are not anti-@@ eu gain .
even in germany , euro@@ s@@ cep@@ tic party could not support alternative for germany – only this year – just five million votes at the federal elections in september .
there have always been domestic opposition to the plan to create a federal europe .
the current economic crisis , however , is turning into a turning point .
due to the financial and economic sanctions imposed by berlin and the european central bank , in conjunction with the stra@@ it@@ jack@@ et , into which the national economy is bound by maintaining the single currency , the euro has left many people in the view .
the crisis in the euro has little to do with the fact that national governments are causing excessive budget deficits – that was only the case in greece .
instead , the euro@@ system has limited its members to exchange rates that are too high for german ex@@ porters .
without the possibility of de@@ valu@@ ing the local currency , southern europe will find itself in a buil@@ t-@@ in productivity dis@@ advantage compared to germany .
the only way to achieve this is to increase wages and public spending – encouraged by berlin .
behind the current budget and monetary problems , the problem is de@@ eper .
as a result of the ‘ green ’ energy policies prescri@@ bed by brussels – a code for subsid@@ ising energy from france and germany – the eu is not going to pay for the energy industry .
this is a cri@@ p@@ pling cost , as we have already seen in gran@@ em@@ ou@@ th .
all wage fix@@ ing in the world protec@@ ts the european petro@@ chemical industry from being hit by cheap american sh@@ ale gas in the corner .
as a result , a re@@ vol@@ t is rising , especially in france , the former che@@ er@@ leader of the eu .
after the war , the french political elite saw the eu as a vehicle for the eu to take over germany in sha@@ k@@ eu@@ p and to take paris on an equal foot@@ ing with washington .
but berlin does not need more than a ga@@ te@@ way to political legitim@@ ation , and has put europe on its own economic policy , which is the struggle of the french economy that is being w@@ oun@@ ded .
the result : marine le pen &apos;s right-@@ wing , eu-@@ ho@@ sti@@ le front national has just won a decisive election .
the national front is now the most popular party in france with 24 % of the elec@@ tor@@ ate – a timely warning for the british labour government .
what makes le pen with its newly won popul@@ arity among the white french of the workers class ?
it wants to hold next year &apos;s eu elections to an anti-@@ eu , anti-@@ community currency blo@@ c in the european parliament .
if anti-@@ eu parties were to be well represented in these elections – and that is very possible – then the first such blo@@ c could be the european parliament .
this is the point i want to make : in the not too dist@@ ant future , the growing res@@ ent@@ ment against the eu and the single currency will be the result of the abolition of the euro .
the eu will not dis@@ appear , but it will be more like the “ europe of ( sovereign ) nations . ”
germany and some of its satellite economies may hold fast to the euro , but france and southern europe will be among their own curren@@ cies .
i expect the uk to move away from this project in the hope of being able to join the us .
washington ’ s growing interest in the pacific is , however , sugge@@ sting that britain alone in the atlantic rain is likely to be on the way .
where is scotland in all this ?
we can decide to create a region of ( la@@ st-@@ minute ) small england .
or we can protect our own economic interests – including , indeed , berlin and brussels – which they themselves have to hide .
i susp@@ ect that scotland could be a loo@@ ser european union .
cooperation with other similarly min@@ ded countries is very important in a non-@@ federal europe of nations .
otherwise , we should consider allowing norway to do the same and to retain our economic independence .
the sn@@ p government in scotland is – remark@@ ably enough – a good example of the most successful political movement against the au@@ ster@@ ity policies in europe , and in 2011 it won a spectacular majority because of the rejection of the proposed ( and implemented ) cuts .
it would be ri@@ dic@@ ulous for scotland to op@@ t for independence now , only to be able to benefit from berlin and brussels from au@@ ster@@ ity policies .
early pub@@ er@@ ty : grow faster than the average age of the pu@@ ber@@ ty : grow faster , the number of children is growing faster .
a@@ fro@@ -@@ american and h@@ is@@ pan@@ ic girls tend to reach pub@@ er@@ ty rather than their white counter@@ parts , as investigations show .
physical changes do not mean the pub@@ er@@ ty of the body .
there is no evidence that hor@@ mon@@ es or other chemicals are safe .
experts believe that the ep@@ ide@@ mic ob@@ es@@ ity is an tri@@ gger of early pub@@ er@@ ty .
the trend towards early pub@@ er@@ ty is less pron@@ oun@@ ced in young people than in young adults .
the former c@@ n@@ n correspon@@ dent pa@@ at et@@ ther@@ i@@ dge is a journ@@ alist who was a member of the c@@ n@@ n group for children &apos;s health and family issues .
if a mother is wor@@ ried , if her daughter is already seven or eight years old , bre@@ asts and sh@@ am@@ ha@@ irs grow ?
at the annual conference of the pa@@ edi@@ at@@ r@@ ici@@ an association of pa@@ edi@@ at@@ r@@ ici@@ ans , the american academy of pedi@@ at@@ ric@@ s this week in or@@ lan@@ do , fl@@ ori@@ da , the pa@@ edi@@ at@@ ric en@@ do@@ cr@@ in@@ o@@ log@@ ist said that dr. paul k@@ ap@@ lo@@ gue is relatively early .
“ i spend a lot of time teaching parents to calm down – normally this is not a sign that they are now quickly getting the pub@@ er@@ ty going , ” explains k@@ ap@@ lo@@ wit@@ z .
obvious ads of development , such as growing bre@@ asts , ch@@ am@@ bo@@ o and ar@@ row hair , and bo@@ d@@ ily od@@ or , are seen in girls earlier .
however , there was only a s@@ light shift in the age of the men@@ ar@@ che ( appearance of the first regular ble@@ eding ) in the last 40 years .
in the united states , the average age is 12@@ ,@@ 5 years , slightly less than 12.@@ 75 years in 197@@ 0 .
“ if the development of bre@@ asts begins , it takes at least two to three years to reach the men@@ ar@@ che , ” said k@@ ap@@ lo@@ wit@@ z , also author of the book “ early pub@@ er@@ ty in girls : the essential advis@@ or .
time is the most accurate test , as the pub@@ er@@ ty progres@@ ses .
it is controversial as to what actually marks the beginning of pub@@ er@@ ty , but it is important to be “ early ” when the bre@@ ast enlargement of a growth ch@@ est is expected to take place eight years ago .
in most cases , the rate of growth is slow@@ ing or stag@@ n@@ ating – something that a pedi@@ at@@ r@@ ici@@ an can monitor closely .
if the progress is made more quickly , tests could be carried out by an en@@ di@@ k@@ ron@@ o@@ log@@ ist , so that serious problems such as t@@ um@@ ors or cy@@ sts can be excluded .
there are treatments for dela@@ ying early men@@ str@@ ual and chr@@ onic de@@ pression .
the recommendations for a medic@@ inal or hor@@ mon@@ al therapy are based on the age of the child , the development speed , the growth rate and the emo@@ tional balance of the patient .
psycho@@ social aspects are also important .
k@@ ap@@ lo@@ wit@@ z is re@@ stra@@ ined about medicines , but he does acknowledge that “ the signing of the buff@@ er is not acceptable . ”
the other major problem is understand@@ able : parents simply do not want their very young dau@@ gh@@ ters to have the period .
“ they are wor@@ ried about the risk of pregn@@ ancy or about how they can reduce hygi@@ ene .
“ it was a sho@@ ck , ” a woman re@@ members , whose daughter , with ten her days , had .
although the first signs have been there and we are talking about men@@ str@@ ual , it was not emo@@ tionally prepared .
she was fri@@ ghten@@ ed and ex@@ ci@@ ted by the school home , because she had the first in her gir@@ l@@ friend circle .
there are many widely published the@@ ories about the causes of early inf@@ ec@@ tions .
but there is no conclu@@ sive evidence that the us has a strong presence in milk or other food .
bo@@ ys come in a similar way to girls in the past .
k@@ ap@@ lo@@ wit@@ z believes that the most convinc@@ ing pre@@ mise is the ep@@ ide@@ mic of f@@ at mort@@ ality .
he supported the conduct of a study in 2001 on girls aged six to nine .
other studies support this conclusion , but there is a lot of other factors that have a role to play .
in this country , afric@@ an-@@ american and h@@ is@@ pan@@ ic girls tend to reach pub@@ er@@ ty rather than their white colleagues .
there are different explanations for this .
glob@@ ally , an early pub@@ er@@ ty seems to have been influenced by all kinds of things , from economic conditions , to climate , to gen@@ es .
another myster@@ y : although bo@@ ys are the face and sh@@ am@@ po@@ o hair earlier , the hair is still growing .
other doctors on the a@@ ap conference stressed the complexity of the problem and the need for a more comprehensive approach .
the appearance of ac@@ ne and sh@@ am@@ ha@@ ar is even common in bab@@ ies and inf@@ ants .
“ we must be careful how we understand the real beginning of pub@@ er@@ ty ” , said dr. lam@@ bert .
parents should not hesitate to let their pedi@@ at@@ r@@ ici@@ an advise you how to treat your child .
“ this can mean that you can get in touch with someone earlier than expected , ” re@@ it k@@ ap@@ lo@@ wit@@ z .
if you remain calm , the child usually re@@ acts well .

jum@@ bo manufacturer argue in the face of large orders over seat width .
there is a clear link between leading aircraft manufacturers about the broad range of seats in the tourist class at long-@@ hau@@ l flights .
the dispute is about the seats and the length of the seats , passengers on long flights in the tourist class are offered – not always those who are to worry about airlines .
airbus has requested a fire service standard in the industry this week that would allow a seat width of at least 46 cm ( 18 in@@ ches ) in the tourist class , but the us arch@@ bis@@ hop has not yet signed up to this .
the argument comes at a time when the aircraft industry is concerned about the need to reduce the number of aircraft in its tw@@ in-@@ engine long-@@ range fleet .
like the back part of the aircraft , the aircraft is designed , especially if it is ro@@ ws with nine or ten seats , it is crucial for the economic results indicated that the new mini-@@ j@@ um@@ bo will deliver .
bo@@ eing claims that his modern@@ ised “ 7@@ 7@@ 7@@ x ” f@@ its 4@@ 06 people at seats in the tourist class , which has more than 17 in@@ ches wide and thus makes ten per row .
airbus decla@@ res that the compe@@ ting version of the a3@@ 50 will carry 3@@ 50 passengers in 18 in@@ ches .
air@@ plane gi@@ ants often share the same opinion about technical details via advertising in the specialist press .
now airbus is appe@@ aling to the du@@ ba@@ i air@@ show , where the 7@@ 7@@ 7@@ x will be delivered with more than 100 orders , directly to the public .
recently , the company issued a notification indic@@ ating the start of a new ad war and providing funds to a picture .
“ bo@@ eing proposes long hau@@ l flights in seats that are closer than regional tur@@ bo@@ -@@ pro@@ ps ” , says airbus ceo lu@@ f@@ than@@ sa .
in view of the changing di@@ etary hab@@ its , people will be th@@ ick@@ er , but aircraft seats have not changed rad@@ ically .
between the early 197@@ 0 ’ s , when bo@@ eing 7@@ 47 launched the modern long-@@ distance journey , and the end of the century , the weight of the male average passenger has increased by between 40 and 49 years .
the wa@@ ist range of the male average american is about 2@@ 1@@ ,000 cm ( 2@@ ,000 feet ) , according to us health statistics .
airbus says its ri@@ val is not com@@ plying with a se@@ ating concept from the 195@@ 0s when the average body size of the fres@@ h@@ ly b@@ ap@@ tiz@@ ed jet set shr@@ in@@ ks .
i was told that the commission had carried out investigations into the fact that an additional customs duty ( eur 2.@@ 54 cm ) per seat would reduce the quality of the sle@@ eping by 53 % .
bo@@ eing den@@ ies the numbers of airbus at the se@@ ating and says that it is not in the discre@@ tion of the manufacturer to decide how airlines will carry out the balance between flights and the establishment .
the company also states that according to studies , the experience on the aircraft depends on more than the seat width .
“ it really is about giving airlines flexibility , but it is not about giving them the flexibility they think they need to do in order to succeed ” , explains the airline ’ s cab@@ in expert ken@@ t cr@@ a@@ ver .
you do not want us to dict@@ ate what you are prof@@ itable .
you know your business better than anyone else .
passengers are concerned with more el@@ bo@@ w freedom , but for manufacturers , it will increasingly be a problem .
behind the argument is a race for aircraft orders with an estimated volume of at least 700 billion us dollars to list prices in the coming decades , which is likely to have a lasting impact on the us or europe &apos;s export performance .
as re@@ u@@ ters first reported in july , the seat is not available in the main engine .
both airbus and bo@@ eing claim 20 percent more efficiency per seat at their latest branches in the tw@@ in-@@ engine long-@@ range design and the market leader in this segment .
the statements bo@@ eing made on the results depend in part on the 7@@ 7@@ 7@@ x being equipped with ten seats per row with the original design of nine seats in the 7@@ 77 .
the increased costs per unit are still lower than in the current machines with ten seats per row .
“ bo@@ eing qu@@ et@@ ches more seats in his plane , so he can become more competitive with our products . ”
on the other hand , analy@@ sts say that full cab@@ ins with ten seats per row , with existing 7@@ 7@@ 7@@ s , indicated that many passengers were in favour of the nar@@ ro@@ wer arrangement , which would involve cheaper fa@@ res .
&quot; eigh@@ teen customs are se@@ ated in a great way for passengers who are travelling , but the reality is that , from an economic point of view , the airbus offer is threatened by the 7@@ 77 threat .
airbus and bo@@ eing do not offer seats that are not available , but a catalogue of suppliers from which the airlines can choose .
the world travel@@ er jet sel@@ lers even wear band@@ width , to make the equipment work in competition .
even if you are looking for comfort , all manufacturers offer je@@ ts with high performance compres@@ sors .
airbus offers an a3@@ 50 with ten@@ -@@ seat series , but , according to its own statement , has not yet sold it .
until recently , airbus under@@ lined the importance of greater adap@@ tability for cab@@ ins and for some je@@ ts of wide seats on the cor@@ rid@@ ors .
without the support of the only other manufacturer of large modern je@@ ts , experts say that the call for a new industry standard is likely to be vo@@ la@@ tile , but from the wave of 7@@ 7@@ 7@@ x sales could di@@ str@@ act .
new anti-@@ nic@@ ot@@ ine vacc@@ ine could be a great help to smo@@ ke .
scientists have developed an anti-@@ nic@@ ot@@ ine vacc@@ ine that will have fun smoking .
a single do@@ se of the vacc@@ ine could prevent m@@ ice from being used for a life@@ time .
before testing on humans , further experim@@ ents are needed , which can take a few years , but professor ron@@ ald crystal is convinced of the we@@ ill cor@@ n@@ ell medical college in new york .
“ we are very hope@@ ful that this type of vacc@@ ination strategy will once again kill millions of smo@@ kers who have tried to stop smoking while all the products available on the market are tested .
the new vacc@@ ine contains a harm@@ less virus that is modified to prevent the disease from being transmitted to the human body .
the virus is selec@@ tively inf@@ ecting li@@ ver cells , which then generate a constant flow of anti@@ bodies .
the anti@@ bodies hun@@ t the nic@@ ot@@ ine mo@@ lec@@ ules in the blood and neu@@ ro@@ der@@ ma@@ ti@@ tis before they reach the brain .
in experim@@ ents , vacc@@ inated m@@ ice , which were not permitted to nic@@ ot@@ ine , kept their normal level of activity .
m@@ ice without vacc@@ ination , on the other hand , would have been a “ time off , ” stated researchers , a sign that nic@@ ot@@ ine could have reached her brain .
the experim@@ ents are published in the science translation media journal .
earlier tobacco vacc@@ ines proposed mis@@ use of the vacc@@ ines against anti@@ bodies .
vacc@@ ination had to be used to maintain the anti@@ body level .
but the cost of the new vacc@@ ine is probably much lower , because it trans@@ forms li@@ ver cells into anti@@ bodies .
as professor crystal said , the european union could be a vacc@@ ine for people who have been exposed to it , if it is safe , before they are put in the temp@@ tation to use a ci@@ gare@@ tte .
but it is more likely that smo@@ kers will use it to stop .
&quot; you then know : if you start smoking again , you will feel a little bit more like smoking because of the nic@@ ot@@ ine vacc@@ ine .
british scientists said that the results were interesting , but they also war@@ ned that there is a need for further research .
tri@@ po@@ di den@@ ies that he is influenced by o@@ be@@ id .
the former labour minister , mr jo@@ e tr@@ ich@@ et , from new south wal@@ es , is being charged with a state corruption investigation .
the former n@@ s@@ w minister den@@ ies that the rules on maritime pollution packaging are being amended at the request of his political ment@@ or , ed@@ die o@@ be@@ id , who has been conce@@ aled in three bases .
the independent european commission is a member of the european parliament .
now , due to the acc@@ us@@ ation , tri@@ po@@ di has been taken over by ob@@ id@@ id interest in the properties .
in years of discussions , which began in 2005 , the government had to rely on public calls for ten@@ der for le@@ ase contracts .
the po@@ ets were opposed to this and also wanted longer mat@@ ur@@ ities .
in 2009 , le@@ asing contracts were awarded to companies at the circu@@ lar qu@@ ay , which is awarded to the o@@ be@@ ids every year , without any public ten@@ der .
tri@@ po@@ di , which was launched from february 2006 to november 2009 , had originally op@@ ted for public calls for ten@@ der .
but he denied that the changes were at o@@ be@@ id ’ s request , which , as tri@@ po@@ di confirmed , was not based on a re@@ design of the le@@ asing arrangements of the government .
one of the ic@@ ac &apos;s telephone records showed talks from august and september 2007 between o@@ be@@ id , tr@@ i@@ po@@ di and ste@@ ve dun@@ n , a senior civil serv@@ ant who was sent to the port ministry .
“ was that what was discussed in these telephone conver@@ sa@@ tions was the development of the commercial packaging regulations ? ” he asked .
“ no , ” tri@@ po@@ di rep@@ lied .

israeli figh@@ ter plan@@ es attack target in syria , and the israeli army is not yet officially deplo@@ yed .
israeli hun@@ ting plan@@ es could have been a destination in the sy@@ ri@@ an port of lat@@ ak@@ ia on thursday night , confirmed by a senior government official to fox news .
the official explained not how the system was intended , but he said that it was at least one .
according to associated press , this was a target of russian sa@@ -@@ 12@@ 5-@@ r@@ m missi@@ les .
at least twice this year , israel has already committed air stri@@ kes against missi@@ le supplies in syria .
foreign workers with 4@@ 57 vis@@ as could be “ real test ” if they were to be able to take the real test .
the government is thinking about the possibility of a “ real money test ” for foreign workers with 4@@ 5@@ 7-@@ visa as part of an extended policy .
if the test were to be introduced , it would have a criteri@@ on that would prevent the european parliament from adopting the 4@@ 57 as an un@@ qualified work@@ force or as a back@@ door to immigration from family and friends to australia .
today , a proposal for discussion was made by the government after the former labour government member , mat@@ thi@@ as mac@@ don@@ ald , signed the comments of the government on the foreign workers .
“ l@@ oud statements such as that foreign@@ ers should sit back and , in austr@@ ali@@ ans , first stop , ” are a very un@@ pleasant back@@ l@@ ash in times when trade unions are a protected labour market . ” he said .
histor@@ ically , the word was that white labor is protected , and that the country ’ s leaders , if any , would respond to this historic arti@@ fact .
the discussion proposal out@@ lines twelve measures which were once implemented by the former immigration minister , chr@@ is bow@@ en .
immigration minister bren@@ dan o &apos;@@ con@@ nor , who was invited yesterday to talk about human trafficking in s@@ ri lan@@ ka , has said that there are five of the proposed changes , which are being discussed .
if the “ authentic@@ ity criteri@@ on ” is accepted , then someone who has a visa could be granted a visa to veri@@ fy that the visa is valid .
firms could also be obliged to provide accounts for the number of 4@@ 57 visa holders who have been granted vis@@ as in the past , after companies that initially had only a small number of workers were finally able to emplo@@ y hundreds .
meanwhile , a 3@@ 5-@@ year-@@ old s@@ ri lan@@ k@@ an asylum see@@ ker probably died from a heart attack .

the british government has announced a study to assess the benefits of h@@ s@@ 2 for scotland .
in the work of h@@ s@@ 2 ltd it is proposed to start from phase 1 in 20@@ 26 high-@@ speed internet connections between scotland and ireland .
transport minister bar@@ on@@ ess k@@ ram@@ er said that the ‘ will britain bring us closer together ’ project .
the scot@@ tish transport minister ke@@ ith brown said that he was very pleased to work with the british government on this plan .
phase 1 consists of a new high-@@ speed rail link between london and the west mid@@ lands .
after phase 2 has been completed , there will be connections to man@@ ch@@ ester and le@@ eds .
in june , the government correc@@ ted the estimated cost of building the high-@@ speed rail link between london and n@@ ord@@ eng@@ land from eur 3@@ 2.@@ 7 billion to £ 4@@ 2.@@ 6 billion .
the british government , which is engaged in talks with transport scotland , has proposed h@@ s@@ 2 ltd to seek further stress tests on track capacity and travel time improvements for n@@ ord@@ en@@ gl@@ and scotland .
this includes the possibility of a journey time of three hours or less from gl@@ as@@ go@@ w and ed@@ in@@ burgh to london .
bar@@ on@@ ess k@@ ram@@ er said : “ our goal for h@@ s@@ 2 is a truly national network that britain and its cities are closer together . ”
we are going ahead with h@@ s@@ 2 because it offers enormous advantages .
without it , we are facing a capacity crisis in our rail network .
but it is also a question of lin@@ king 18 british cities , including gl@@ as@@ go@@ w and ed@@ in@@ burgh , which have been improved thanks to h@@ s@@ 2 .
the scot@@ tish secretary of state , ali@@ sta@@ ir car@@ michael , comm@@ ented : “ today ’ s announcement is good news for scotland . ”
on behalf of the scot@@ tish government , ke@@ ith brown called for car@@ michael to be “ un@@ equi@@ vo@@ cal ” in favour of scot@@ tish integration into the h@@ s@@ 2 network .
brown said : “ the high-@@ speed rail link is a risk of enormous potential economic benefits for scotland .
we are therefore pleased to be able to work as a partner to the british government and to discuss the options for a high-@@ speed rail link in scotland , which will bring benefits for all and will facilitate the connection between gl@@ as@@ go@@ w-@@ ed@@ in@@ burgh and the scot@@ tish government .
i look forward to receiving the report of inquiry with the british ministers next year .
regulations on electronic equipment in aircraft remain in force in australia for the time being .
austr@@ ali@@ an air passengers must continue to carry tab@@ lets and smar@@ t@@ phones at the start and lan@@ ding , despite efforts in the us , which have made it easier to relax the rules on such equipment .
the us federal aviation administration has issued a new proposal for a us airline to carry out its duties in order to allow passengers to fly on their equipment during critical flight ph@@ ases .
for most of the flight , pas@@ se@@ i@@ g de gr@@ à@@ cia is already allowed , but many people find it an@@ no@@ ying that they are unable to leave their e-@@ books when they start and lan@@ ding .
austr@@ ali@@ an companies are watching the decision to implement the us airlines un@@ w@@ ary of work .
the air traffic control agency casa also stated that it would take a look at the announcement , but stressed that the restrictions on the use of electronic equipment in critical air flight ph@@ ases in australia are still valid .
“ the casa has no specific regulations on the use of electronic devices in aircraft at the moment , ” said the company .
the subject is subject to provisions whereby airlines are entitled to maintain safety at any time and passengers are required to carry out the security instructions given by cab@@ in crew .
vir@@ gin has already started the casa talks about an extension of its wi-fi network .
“ we would like to see a review of the authorisation of electronic equipment by casa , because we are convinced that this will improve the customer experience after we have ( wireless ) a lot of experience during the flight .
q@@ ant@@ as explained that , for the time being , we will remain with the current rules .
“ our current guidelines provide that electronic equipment will be used at the start and lan@@ ding stage , and we currently have no plans to do so . ” said the company .
the fa@@ a rules apply to us airlines .
however , we are always interested in developments in regulations that benefit passengers , and we will be looking at the fa@@ a decision and the reasons behind it .
the decision has a negative impact on us companies , depending on the age of the fleet .
they must prove that their aircraft are capable of preventing radio distur@@ ban@@ ces from being detec@@ ted by mobile devices , and manu@@ als , training materials , hand bag@@ gage programs and customer instruc@@ tion are being changed .
“ after an airline has confirmed the tolerance of its fleet , it can offer passengers the use of port@@ able , ligh@@ ter electronic devices such as tab@@ lets , e-@@ book reading devices and smart phones .
in rare cases of bad vision , the crew will not be able to instruc@@ t the passengers while lan@@ ding .
the group also recommended that he@@ avi@@ er devices be used at star@@ t-@@ up and lan@@ ding safe@@ ly under the seat or in the subjects above the seat .

bor@@ us@@ sia dor@@ t@@ mun@@ d announced that he would continue to take tough action .
before the friday match of the football league in the face of the v@@ f@@ b stutt@@ gart reader , the german u@@ 3 re@@ acted with a silence - first .
it was an un@@ familiar , almost spec@@ u@@ lative ac@@ ous@@ tics that was dedicated to the vie@@ wer until just before the beginning of the bun@@ des@@ lig@@ a game between the german vice-president bor@@ us@@ sia bor@@ us@@ sia dor@@ t@@ mun@@ d and the v@@ da .
the majority of the guests were listening to their songs .
the south grand@@ stand , on the other hand , where the fa@@ i@@ th@@ ful - and lou@@ dest - b@@ v@@ b fans stand , was initially presented with excep@@ tionally quiet : no songs , no batt@@ les .
the po@@ dium of cap@@ o , who would otherwise have the joint mo@@ ist@@ ure , remained un@@ used .

when his team colleagues followed , there were strong vo@@ ices and vo@@ ices calling out .
in the central blocks 12 and 13 of the south grand@@ stand , the crow@@ d was not pro@@ vo@@ king .

only five minutes before the start of the game the cap@@ o kno@@ c@@ ked his po@@ dium - and the up to that point with his hands .
finally , as always , the southern grand@@ stand was on the line - and finally there was a lot of noise again .
and at the latest when with the p@@ f@@ and@@ brief from the south grand@@ stand the l@@ oud call &quot; der@@ by@@ sie@@ ger stands on &quot; came , again everything was as usual .
the silence before was probably a response to what happened in the last few days .

although they receive 3@@ ,000 sing@@ apor@@ e dollars each month ( about 1,@@ 7@@ 30 euros ) as an administrative employee , and their hus@@ band also works , they do not pay the monthly family income , explains the difference .

that is why millions of people in the region are turning to p@@ f@@ and@@ h@@ ä@@ user , after families have been put under pressure from rising cost of living and increasing household and consumer debt .
after five years of robust growth since the global financial crisis and cheap loans from a lo@@ ose fiscal policy in the advanced economies , families with low income and low income look for p@@ f@@ and@@ houses to help in st@@ ot@@ ter@@ n@@ ach economics .
this week , the credit rating agency standard &amp; poor &apos;s called the growing budget debt of the european union , mainly due to rising mort@@ g@@ ages .

mal@@ ay@@ sia is the world &apos;s largest economy , accounting for 80 % of gdp , while the country is growing at 60 % in 2008 .
econom@@ ists are also concerned about the high consumer debt in thailand , which is causing a b@@ low this week from a technical recession .
on thursday , the data showed a continuing export weak@@ ness and a decline in consumer demand .
“ in the end , this means that , with rising costs , people in the middle to lower segment ( the income side ) are more likely to try to increase their in@@ comes , wherever the possible . ”

rescue package on 3@@ 25 million austr@@ ali@@ an dollars for tac@@ is .
the austr@@ ali@@ an government insi@@ sts on the tough conditions imposed by the rescue package .
federal minister of health t@@ any@@ a p@@ liber@@ se@@ k announced that the comm@@ on@@ wealth will be “ immediate action ” to prevent the spread of a crisis that has been exac@@ er@@ b@@ ated by an ag@@ eing population of the island state , a higher rate of ill@@ ness .
the funding for a four-@@ year period was increased after intergovernmental discussions with the independent tas@@ man@@ ian member andre@@ w wil@@ ki@@ e .
“ the government has issued an emergency rescue package , ” says the president of the european central bank .
the 3@@ 2@@ 5-@@ million dollar dollar ban@@ g package comprises 31 million dollars of emergency aid for electoral services .
the other 26@@ 00 operations , including or@@ th@@ op@@ a@@ edi@@ c operations and treatments for gra@@ y star , are intended to remove resi@@ du@@ es .
there is also money for day clin@@ ics in ho@@ b@@ art and laun@@ ce@@ ston , better after@@ care after hospital treatment , and more for patients .
“ these investments are in line with the ideas that affected me in clinical staff have told me that they are the best way to achieve the tas@@ man@@ ian health system , ” said t@@ any@@ a p@@ liber@@ se@@ k .
the minister insi@@ sted on a strict reporting and accountability policy , which was the responsibility of the tas@@ man@@ ian government .
the federal state must provide the current level of funding to finance money from the comm@@ on@@ wealth .
a three-@@ head@@ ed commission will be set up to ensure that the federal government provides health services as effectively and efficiently as possible .
like wil@@ ki@@ e said today , the 3@@ 25 million dollars would be of little use if “ they were not accompanied by real reforms that would undermine the public tas@@ man@@ ian health system in a more sustainable way . ”
nevertheless , he p@@ raised the government for insi@@ sting on its request for urgent aid .
“ i am confident that the federal aid will make a major contribution to the promotion of public health systems in the state from the sor@@ g@@ ent list , ” said wil@@ ki@@ e .
according to the government of the state , these electoral benefits will largely reflect the recent cuts .
but the public health spo@@ kes@@ man on the federal government , peter du@@ tt@@ on , is of the opinion that today &apos;s announcement is only a “ pav@@ ing ” solution .
“ we are therefore in the position today because the laboratory state government has 4@@ 30 million dollars from the health system .
it is not acceptable that a government of state should pay almost half a billion dollars out of the system and that the comm@@ on@@ wealth should pay 300 million .
du@@ tt@@ on called for p@@ liber@@ se@@ k to guarantee that not a single dollar of the rescue package would be used for additional bureaucracy .

the announcement by the organisation for the prohibi@@ tion of chemical weapons ( op@@ c@@ w ) came a day before the deadline on 1 january .
1 november , which the united nations security council in the h@@ ague called dam@@ as@@ c@@ us to remove all the facilities for the production of chemical weapons .
the conclusion of this process , which is basically the first stage of destruction , is an important mil@@ est@@ one in an ambitious timetable for the future of the european union .
the destruction of facilities means that syria does not need new chemical weapons .
dam@@ as@@ c@@ us , however , still needs to begin to use the weapons and supplies that exist .
it is believed that there are about 1@@ ,000 tonnes of chemicals and weapons in the country , including mu@@ st@@ ard gas and the ner@@ vous gas sar@@ in .
the announcement came at a time when the thursday fight was in the city of sa@@ fir@@ a , from the experts say that the time was ri@@ pe for the production of chemical weapons and storage facilities .
the acti@@ vis@@ t group that has a network of activi@@ sts in syria increasing the number of dead , declared on thursday , 1@@ 20@@ .@@ 2@@ 96 people were dead .
of these , 6@@ 1,@@ 0@@ 67 civili@@ ans , including 6@@ ,@@ 3@@ 65 children .
the government has had 2@@ 9@@ ,@@ 9@@ 54 of them in the army of president bas@@ ha@@ r as@@ sad , 18@@ ,@@ 6@@ 78 of them are pro-@@ government figh@@ ters and 18@@ 7 leban@@ ese hi@@ z@@ bol@@ lah mil@@ i@@ ti@@ as .
also among the dead are 2.@@ 20@@ 2 deser@@ ted army soldiers &apos; soldiers and 5@@ ,@@ 3@@ 75 figh@@ ters of the opposition , many of them foreign@@ ers .
on 25 july , the un estimated the number of deaths in this conflict since march 2011 to 10@@ 0,000 .
this figure has not been updated .
the conflict has affected about two million people to fle@@ e the country .
as@@ sad ’ s troops have been fighting for the re@@ bel@@ lion in sa@@ fir@@ a for weeks , many of which have links to al-@@ q@@ a@@ ed@@ a groups .
the observ@@ atory said that on thursday losses were incur@@ red on both sides , but it did not mention details .
the fighting under@@ lines the danger posed by the chemical weapons inspec@@ tors , because their mission to liber@@ ate syria is a very important one .
according to the op@@ c@@ w , which is closely linked to the united nations , the team is “ now convinced that it will all be able to implement all the major production and mix@@ ing / filling facilities named by syria and see their destruction . ”
that ’ s why no more inspection activities are planned . ”
earlier this week , the inspec@@ tors said they had completed the first round of inspec@@ tions and 21 out of 23 of the inspec@@ tions announced by dam@@ as@@ c@@ us .
because of security concerns , visit two facilities was not possible , the inspec@@ tors said .
on thursday , op@@ wc , the two sites were named after sy@@ ri@@ an “ abandoned . ”
it was not immediately clear whether the site in sa@@ fir@@ a was one of the two institutions that the op@@ c@@ w inspec@@ tors did not visit .
syria has a plan for the complete destruction of its chemical weapons , which will be adopted next month by the executive committee of the op@@ wc .
&quot; i prefer to w@@ ash my hands of bra@@ very and courage , &quot; said the president of the european commission .
for three years now , the mainly sun@@ ni muslim re@@ be@@ ls have been fighting in this civil war against as@@ sad ’ s government and its security forces , which have been a source of support for many al@@ a@@ wi@@ tes .
with a view to further developments , the head of the observ@@ atory , ram@@ i ab@@ dur@@ ra@@ h@@ man , said that there was a strong explo@@ sion on wednesday in an air defence facility in the sy@@ ri@@ an coastal province of lat@@ ak@@ ia .
the cause of the explo@@ sion is not known , he explained .
an@@ ger at jud@@ g@@ ement for bom@@ bers in bal@@ i
survi@@ v@@ ors and rela@@ tives of the 20@@ 2 people who died in the bom@@ b attack in bal@@ i in 2002 are now re@@ acting to the an@@ ger felt by the people of the last attack on the in@@ sti@@ g@@ ator .
pa@@ te@@ k , who is almost ten years old as one of the most sought after people in south-@@ east asia , has been arrested yesterday for his role in building sp@@ ren@@ gl@@ ers .
the suspension could be lif@@ ted after 15 years .
the 45 year-@@ old was accused of mass murder .
a claim was also made in a number of terrorist cases .
the public prosecu@@ tor had a life sentence imposed on him , even if he was a prison@@ er of con@@ science for the man who had been a master bom@@ b buil@@ der for his reputation .
the decision has caused pain@@ ful mem@@ ories at june cor@@ te@@ en .
with te@@ ars , he said that pa@@ te@@ k had the death of being a prison@@ er .
i really do think that he should be in the foot@@ steps of the other gu@@ ys .
“ it is important to protect him from a sho@@ oting command , ” said cor@@ te@@ en to a@@ ap .
i have to live with it every day , that i will not get any more grand@@ children and i will never see my dau@@ gh@@ ters again .
the sar@@ i club was built on the ground when the first world war was launched shortly after 11 p.m. on 12 october 2002 in a small car .
peter hu@@ gh@@ es was in pad@@ dy &apos;s bar where only 20 seconds earlier a self-@@ mor@@ tal strike took place .
he fell after the attack a month ago .
hu@@ gh@@ es said pa@@ te@@ k had the same fate as the three other members of the y@@ em@@ a@@ ah islamic terrorist cell .
really , this type should be the death penalty above all others .
to keep it alive – no , there is no reason to keep it alive .
20 years after he was born 20@@ 2 people , and many hundreds of in@@ ju@@ red , is not much .
pa@@ te@@ k is the last of the bal@@ i bom@@ bers to be brought to justice .
he almost es@@ cap@@ ed the for@@ tress for a decade , but was eventually arrested in january 2011 in the pa@@ ki@@ stan@@ i city of ab@@ bot@@ tab@@ ad , where us forces were arrested bare@@ ly four months later , al-@@ q@@ a@@ ed@@ a leader .
during the negotiations , a f@@ bi agent from the united states said that intelligence reports in@@ h@@ eri@@ ted the fact that pa@@ te@@ k had been in pakistan to be b@@ in la@@ den with the aim of establishing the link between south-@@ east asian terrorist groups .
&quot; he has not stood up , &quot; said cor@@ te@@ en .
until recently , he has not shown any re@@ mor@@ se for the suffering he has inf@@ lic@@ ted on other people .
the judgment was made before the ten@@ -@@ year anniversary of the attack this year , which was accompanied by comm@@ em@@ or@@ ations in bal@@ i and australia .
&quot; this year there will be many te@@ ars , &quot; said cor@@ te@@ en .
pa@@ te@@ k may still re@@ vo@@ ke his judgment .
fa@@ a : passengers can now use electronic equipment in aircraft ( but not mobile phones ) .
air passengers can now travel from departure to lan@@ ding with their electronic devices for reading , working , playing , listening to music and viewing films .
but passengers should not expect the latter to be implemented immediately .
how quickly it would be implemented depends on the airline in question , explained fa@@ a staff michael hu@@ er@@ ta on a press conference .
airlines must be subject to fa@@ a to veri@@ fy that aircraft comply with the new directives and that they comply with the training manu@@ als of the air crew and with the rules governing the sto@@ wage of the equipment in accordance with the new rules .
the fa@@ a stated that it has already received plans from some airlines that will allow port@@ able electronic devices to be used in aircraft .
these airlines also included del@@ ta and j@@ et@@ blue .
“ depending on the state of the plan , we could support the extended use of electronic devices very soon , ” the fa@@ a announced in a statement that it would be using the electronic devices .
at the moment , passengers must be able to use smar@@ t@@ phones , tab@@ lets and other devices if the aircraft doors are closed .
they may not start again until the aircraft has reached a height of three kilometres .
when entering the lan@@ ding flight , passengers must take them off again and not leave them off again before the aircraft is lan@@ ded .
under the new directives , airlines whose aircraft are protected from electronic dis@@ rup@@ tions could be offered a way to provide their passengers with the equipment even when it is launched , lan@@ ding and on the field .
most new commercial aircraft and other plan@@ es flying for the use of wi@@ -@@ fi in larger hei@@ ghts are now available in the uk .
la@@ ura gl@@ ad@@ er , president of the professional association of professional flight att@@ end@@ ants , welcomed the changes .
“ if the new regulation is implemented safe@@ ly – and we are working closely with the airline in this regard – both sides will benefit from it , ” comm@@ ented gl@@ ad@@ ing .
we are frank@@ ly ti@@ red of being like a fo@@ ol on this issue .
nevertheless , internet connections to sur@@ f , exchange e-@@ ma@@ ils , text messages or download data remained under three kilometres long .
passengers are asked to use smar@@ t@@ phones , tab@@ lets and other devices in the flight mode .
so still no “ words with friends ” .
and he@@ avi@@ er devices like lap@@ top@@ s must continue to be sto@@ wed , as this is a risk of in@@ jury if they are sto@@ len by the cab@@ in .
mobile phone calls during the flight will also remain prohibited .
the regulatory competence for telephone calls lies with the federal communications agency ( f@@ s@@ f ) .
fa@@ a may lift the ban on certain electronic devices at the start and lan@@ ding of certain electronic devices on the start and lan@@ ding of certain electronic devices on the same drive when the vehicle is in use and lan@@ ding .
last month mark ro@@ sen@@ ker said of road safety authority national transport safety agency that the transport safety board should be responsible for national transport .
“ mobile phones are really a problem , not only because they potentially cause distur@@ ban@@ ces in navigation devices , but because we are dependent on the f@@ cc to know that the transmission from the air also trans@@ mits transmission ma@@ sts ” , says .
a advisory committee of the industry , led by the fa@@ a to study this issue , will be able to recommend the adoption of a new directive on the protection of intellectual property rights in the field of electronic communications last month .
in recent years , pressure on the fac@@ t-@@ finding mission has increased , restrictions on use have been lo@@ wered .
cri@@ tics such as the democratic sen@@ ator cla@@ ire mc@@ cas@@ k@@ ill from mis@@ sour@@ i represent the view that there is no valid legal security reasons for the ban .
the restrictions are also increasingly heavy .
some studies have mentioned that the system can be used up to one third of passengers to switch off the equipment .
the fa@@ a began in 196@@ 6 to promote the use of electronic devices by air passengers , after reports of distur@@ ban@@ ces in navigation and communication equipment were submitted by passengers .
new aircraft are much more dependent on electrical systems than previous generations of air vehicles , but they are also so constructive that they can be used by the fa@@ a to provide electronic inter@@ ference .
airlines offer passengers a wide range of services for several years now , if the flight is reached .
the wi-fi connection is available in the public areas of the hotel .
the vast majority of passenger aircraft should be used for the greater use of electronic equipment in accordance with the new directives , said hu@@ er@@ ta .
today &apos;s electronic devices generally give much less radiation than the previous ones .
e-@@ reader , for example , only gives minimal radiation if you are using f@@ li@@ p sheets .
but downloading or sending data is not the same as downloading data .
the ad@@ voca@@ tes of eas@@ ing restrictions on the use of devices are the united states , canada , the united states , japan , and the united states .
in 2011 , corporate employees invited a passenger plane full of kin@@ dle e-@@ reader and made a test flight to avoid problems .
members of the fa@@ a advisory committee are expressing concern about the situation in the region .
dou@@ gl@@ as kid@@ d from the passenger association national association of airline pa@@ irs , said that he was the opinion that the dis@@ ru@@ ption caused by the equipment was real , even if the risk was minimal .
other committees have said that there is no more than a few reports from pi@@ rates who have been responsible for a dis@@ ru@@ ption of aircraft systems by the devices .
the committee recommended that the fa@@ a should not allow the pilot to fly to the united states for instrument lan@@ ding .
a group from the travel industry welcomed the changes and called them &quot; reasonable &quot; .
“ we are pleased that the fa@@ a recogn@@ ises that a pleasant passenger experience is not at od@@ ds with safety , ” said ro@@ ger do@@ w , ceo of the u.s. travel services association .
by air rescue service from north sea coast , the island of ge@@ re@@ t@@ te@@ ter vo@@ gel is released again .
a car park is available at the coast , which is also available for rent .
the water pur@@ se was filled last month with a helicop@@ ter after ab@@ er@@ de@@ en .
col@@ in se@@ d@@ don , head of the centre , said : “ this water pur@@ se was probably a winter dra@@ u@@ ght from northern europe , which was replaced by the strong win@@ ds over the north sea . ”
it seems that the exhaus@@ ted vo@@ gel sought refu@@ ge on the bo@@ re@@ hole .
he added : “ he could not continue flying , so we have to stop asking for help .
when she was released , the water pur@@ se was again fit and healthy .
is europe ’ s elite prepared to do business with britain ?
business for britain was founded in april with the intention of expanding the economy to include the united states and the united states , with a view to defining what those who provide wealth and work in britain want to change our relations with the eu .
to this end , we have the largest and most comprehensive survey among british economic leaders .
you@@ go@@ v asked about 1.@@ 000 leaders in the world economy , who were about to take over the uk ’ s corporate sizes , sectors , and regions .
the results of the survey will surprise many .
we have found that the vast majority of the companies are now outside europe .
you want the government leaders to take new trade links with countries like china , india , and brazil .
in your opinion , when asked about certain subjects regulated by law – from anti@@ trust law to product legislation – the majority of economic leaders believe that the control of these key competences should be transferred to west@@ min@@ ster .
there was general dis@@ satisfaction with the internal market , as the companies said that the costs of the brussels rules have now exce@@ eded the benefits that would be part of europe &apos;s trade area – even 40 % of the large companies voted .
finally , and probably most importantly , it is our inter@@ vie@@ we@@ es of economic leaders that have shown that a clear majority would like to see britain move on the path towards changing the agreement and a relationship with the eu based on trade , not politics .
this re@@ alization , which has been proven by companies of all sizes and leading groups , shows that the economy is heading for “ meaning@@ ful change , ” which is the theme of action .
it is a question of a lot – a change to the agreement and better conditions for britain would lead to a 16 % change of opinion in favour of remaining in the eu in a referendum .
the prime minister should have no doubt : this survey shows that the british economy is behind its plan for re@@ negotiating british conditions for eu membership .
it also shows that companies are benef@@ iting from re@@ negotiation and that the power relations are being shi@@ fted back to britain .
a better deal for the british economy is possible and increasingly necessary .
priority must be given to jobs and growth in britain , as the result of our survey shows what greater growth is for businesses in trade and a fundamental role for the bro@@ ther@@ hood in the approach to legislation in brussels .
alex@@ e@@ i mill@@ er of ga@@ z@@ pro@@ m is a pipel@@ ine in bulgaria that marks the beginning of a new gas era in the gas era in bulgaria .
the construction of the south stream pipel@@ ine is now under@@ way in bulgaria .
“ today ’ s event is a mil@@ est@@ one : construction work on the bulg@@ arian section of the south stream gas pipel@@ ine , the largest and most important project in europe , has begun , ” said the ceo .
the project is a key element in the energy security of the entire european continent .
south stream is to provide more diversity in russia ’ s export routes through europe .

mill@@ er said that the direct link to bulgaria , a member of the european union , means that the border cros@@ s@@ ings linked to transit countries are “ responsible for the long run . ”
bulg@@ arian consumers receive gas from south stream to be dis@@ coun@@ ted prices if the entire project is to be put into operation in 20@@ 15 .
according to ga@@ z@@ pro@@ m , construction work in other sub@@ ordin@@ ate countries should be carried out on the planned route at the end of the year .
the pipel@@ ine is limited to an annual capacity of 6@@ 2.@@ 3 billion cu@@ b@@ ic metres of natural gas .

consultation before the royal commission : two y@@ m@@ ca employees before the acc@@ us@@ ations against jon@@ a@@ than lor@@ d for sexual abuse and for the murder of a child .
two y@@ m@@ ca employees from new south wal@@ es ( n@@ s@@ w ) are arrested for sexual off@@ ences in connection with children .
but the opening statement before the commission had not given the y@@ m@@ ca a statement that ‘ in the organisation never had a incident of sexual abuse ’ .
managing director phil@@ li@@ p h@@ are was informed of a case in which a y@@ m@@ ca employee was arrested for off@@ ences involving child por@@ no@@ graphy .
ha@@ res said ga@@ il fur@@ ness , one of the commission assi@@ sted law@@ yer , that he was not convinced of the first case , the second but not the second .
he ad@@ mitted that the opening statement of the y@@ m@@ ca to the commission was also in@@ accurate in asser@@ ting that the commission had not received external aud@@ its .
evidence before the commission shows that the y@@ m@@ ca is aware that the commission is not taking the second lowest in the assessment of four possible measures in a quality audit of the department of education .
ha@@ res , who was playing at the y@@ m@@ ca with 21 , ad@@ mitted that the management had “ heard from me down@@ wards ” at the setting of lor@@ d ver@@ st and not ensured that he had been there .
lord was a member of the un security council at the beginning of the year for sexual off@@ ences against twelve bo@@ ys .
he was sent@@ enced to at least six years in prison .
h@@ are , however , said that the y@@ m@@ ca is a cultural problem that affects employees .
the staff said they had committed violations and they were not aware of any such off@@ ences , amongst other things , that lord was alone with children , that he was priv@@ ately responsible for bab@@ y@@ sit@@ ter , she sat on his la@@ p , saying that he was children .
dani@@ elle oc@@ k@@ well , whose chief lord of the r@@ ings , was asked to attend a child protection training course because she was not a child because of his behaviour , said that he would not be able to attend the child services .
the managing director stated that he would not accept statements by employees that they would not d@@ are to give their superi@@ ors notice that they had been sent .
instead , he said , it was their friend@@ ship with lord that made their jud@@ g@@ ement less , which is why they had not reported it .
ha@@ res explained that he had submitted a report to the y@@ m@@ ca n@@ s@@ w board that the le@@ ak@@ age that the organization had learned from the jon@@ a@@ than protocol was not the same .
ha@@ res said that the decision to force employees to sign confid@@ enti@@ ality obligations shortly after the acc@@ us@@ ations were made was taken by the managing director of the children &apos;s services of y@@ m@@ ca , li@@ am wh@@ it@@ ley .
he said that this should prevent contam@@ ination of the evidence that was being produced , but that was &apos; over@@ ze@@ al@@ ous &apos; and badly implemented .
the y@@ m@@ ca n@@ s@@ w was in the time when jon@@ a@@ than lord was appointed between 2009 and 2011 .
he explained that there are “ serious problems ” in the recru@@ it@@ ment , review , inclusion , training and management of the system .
the hearing was held until 20 december .
ton@@ y bla@@ ir said that he would se@@ ize the chance to return as british prime minister – but ad@@ mits that a com@@ e@@ back is unlikely .
in an interview this evening on the occasion of the fifth anniversary of his reti@@ rement from office , the european council &apos;s 5@@ 9-@@ year-@@ old proc@@ laim@@ ed his views on various domestic issues .
since his re@@ sign@@ ation in june 2007 , after a decade as head of state , bla@@ ir has largely avoided bri@@ bing himself to british politics , and his comments have mostly been directed at foreign policy and his role as en@@ vo@@ y of the quar@@ tet .
when asked whether he would like to be elected prime minister , he was not asked to do so by the evening standard .
when the hor@@ se@@ -@@ show experts met in car@@ di@@ ff , they were able to see the horse of the year and they were not aware of the need for a tough competition .
but no one was prepared for the three year old f@@ ent@@ on kir@@ k@@ land .
the k@@ n@@ ir@@ ps that has not even been in the kin@@ der@@ gar@@ ten and only a few months ago took its first steps , and its sh@@ et@@ land@@ -@@ pon@@ y to@@ ff@@ ee tr@@ app@@ ed loc@@ kers through the three roun@@ ds and hol@@ ded .

f@@ ent@@ on was founded by the jud@@ ges for his natural abilities in handling the pon@@ y .

f@@ ent@@ on had visited to@@ ff@@ ee last march as a gift to his third birth@@ day and since then he has been working with the sh@@ et@@ land pon@@ y every day .
his mother , don@@ na , 30 , said : “ f@@ ent@@ on and to@@ ff@@ ee are a great sp@@ an . ”
they had to fight against the entire particip@@ ant field and are equipped with gold cup and ro@@ set@@ te .
it was only the second time that he was with to@@ ff@@ ee participating in a competition , and we were all delighted that he was won .
completely str@@ an@@ ded in the arena thought it was so phenomen@@ al that it was not able to take photographs with him .
the little boy from the village of nan@@ ty@@ gl@@ o near eb@@ b@@ w v@@ ale , so@@ u@@ th wal@@ es , follows the foot@@ steps of his tan@@ te shar@@ on ho@@ well@@ s , who has been in the horses for over ten years .
ho@@ well &apos;s told us : &quot; the whole audience was like elec@@ tri@@ fied and everyone fu@@ elled him and lam@@ ented him . &quot;
he ran on sand all the length of the arena and although he was so tiny , he was not able to make fantastic work .
f@@ ent@@ on is cra@@ zy about animals – he lo@@ ves horses , trac@@ tors and farms .
as it starts , the system will not be very long before it is launched on the “ horse of the year ” show – and i am sure that it will be well cut .
a spo@@ kes@@ man for the annual horse show said : “ f@@ ent@@ on is only three , but he knows how to use his pon@@ y . ”
together they are a great team .
the jury evalu@@ ated f@@ ent@@ on and to@@ ff@@ ee after , how well they did .
they are looking for good cooperation between pon@@ y and leader – and here f@@ ent@@ on and to@@ ff@@ ee were the best in the ring .
i am sure that f@@ ent@@ on &apos;s sweet clothes will do their part to make the fit@@ ting really perfect to occasion .

the “ rec@@ ti@@ fication order ” was issued by the food and drug administration .
preliminary investigations are carried out to show that the new express , the new y@@ an@@ gh@@ chen@@ g e@@ ven@@ ing news group , is between september 20@@ 12 and august 2013 subject to several in@@ accurate reports about the stock exchange .
“ the ed@@ it@@ orial management of the new express was dis@@ organised , ” the regulatory authority issued a statement .

in addition , the y@@ ang@@ chen@@ g ev@@ ening news group has been instruc@@ ted to provide a complete rec@@ ti@@ fication of the new express and recommended that the relevant people in the new express be identified and immediately become the leader .
chen had several articles for the new express , in which he talked about alleg@@ ed financial ir@@ regul@@ arities in a manufacturer of construction machinery called zo@@ om@@ lion .
after being arrested , he published a report on two calls for his release .

dro@@ gen@@ tunnel with own railway between the usa and mexico disco@@ vers the area around the island .
one of the most sophisticated tun@@ nels for the s@@ mu@@ gg@@ ling of drugs between the us and mexico , which is fully equipped with lighting , v@@ enti@@ lation and electric railway .
the us authorities described the 120 times 90 cen@@ time@@ ters measuring tunnel as a major source of sophisticated information about the use of the tunnel .
the tunnel , which is located in the zi@@ g@@ z@@ ag pattern over a length of just under six football fields , connec@@ ts ware@@ houses near ti@@ ju@@ ana , mexico , and san di@@ e@@ go , usa .
there are numerous places of un@@ char@@ ted storage in the area , making it easier to use drugs .
the tunnel has been closed before drugs have been trans@@ ported un@@ recognized , and the united states authorities have declared that they are not .
in the discovery of the tunnel , eight and a half tonnes of mari@@ ju@@ ana and 14@@ 8 kil@@ o@@ gram@@ s of co@@ ca@@ ine were secured , the court records were .
three men who , according to the authorities , worked as drivers were arrested for having the right to travel and for the intended sale of mari@@ ju@@ ana and co@@ ca@@ ine .
they are threatened with a sentence of imprison@@ ment if they are sent@@ enced to ten years in prison .

the tunnel is the eigh@@ th large pass@@ age , which has been in san di@@ e@@ go since 2006 .
some of the largest tun@@ nels were built after the mari@@ ju@@ ana har@@ v@@ est in central mexico in october , which has made drug car@@ te@@ ls face the challenge of how to sell their product to consumers quickly .

ve@@ gan@@ ism is a popular form of vege@@ tari@@ an@@ ism , according to le@@ x@@ icon , but it is different from vege@@ tari@@ an@@ ism in a very significant way .
because , while vege@@ tari@@ ans are committed to the consumption of see@@ ds , e@@ is or a powerful fruit , they are not allowed to eat them .
milk , cheese , eg@@ g , besides the wai@@ ver of meat and fish , the ve@@ gan leaves the ve@@ gan from all consumption of animal products - even dogs and c@@ ats are denied .
what remains , one might wonder , but , looking at the situation , the ve@@ gan@@ e di@@ et is characterized by a considerable influ@@ x of ideas .
&quot; bread co@@ ating is very popular &quot; , explains ute hen@@ kel@@ mann , who is the owner of the local bread re@@ forming house , who has a wide range of special products for ve@@ g@@ ans .
re@@ u@@ ben proc@@ tor also visits the store in the dom@@ gas@@ se .
for 13 years , the native new ze@@ al@@ and has lived in ve@@ gan , lam@@ per@@ the@@ im ( almost ) all of what he calls life .
at the turn of the century , the next step was taken and i became ve@@ gan .
&quot; the convic@@ tion came not only because of nutri@@ tion , but because of the choice of shoes , &quot; proc@@ tor says , the artificial leather of normal leather pre@@ fers .
he realized that there are also problems in other everyday matters without animal products .
first and foremost , ve@@ gan is an eth@@ ic .
&quot; i do not want animals to die for me , &quot; says proc@@ tor the ma@@ xi@@ m of ve@@ g@@ ans who are on the whole consumer behaviour .
instead of bur@@ gers , sti@@ r@@ rers or rubber bears , the company is now in the process of becoming a ve@@ gan .
&quot; it is a double bonus , &quot; says proc@@ tor today , &quot; indeed , ve@@ gan does not give up , no as@@ c@@ end@@ ants , but it is an en@@ rich@@ ment &quot; .
and it is precisely these conditions that left some still so well inten@@ tioned attempts to fail .
&quot; the ad@@ diction factor is a very important factor that can give many people up quickly , similar to smoking , &quot; pro@@ k@@ tor presents a comparison .
and applies one : &quot; certain tas@@ tes are not fixed on the animal &quot; .
it is often the sp@@ ices or the type of preparation that are used to make the taste .
&quot; however , you can also use the same effect in other ways , &quot; the ve@@ gan is a clear illu@@ stration .
the bar@@ bec@@ ue festival is a celebr@@ ation of the celebr@@ ation of the au@@ ber@@ gin@@ es , mus@@ h@@ rooms and a few ve@@ gan sa@@ us@@ ages .
it takes care of a balanced , varied di@@ et , in which there is a certain def@@ ensive effect .
of course , there is a desire to have something between the te@@ eth , that is legitimate .
&quot; it should taste but the most important thing is not only animal food .
damage to health , including eating dis@@ orders , another widespread as@@ sumption , he did not suffer .
for me , the change@@ over had a positive aspect .
i take no other cho@@ le@@ ster@@ ol and i have an increased vit@@ am@@ in content .
there are high-@@ performance shops , restaurants , and shops that are exclusively fed by ve@@ gan .
&quot; my blood values are excellent , i am often checked .
in particular , the lack of vit@@ am@@ in b@@ 12 war@@ ns many ve@@ gan cri@@ tics .
&quot; since animals are gene@@ tically fed , the eu should not be allowed to gra@@ ze on the pa@@ st@@ ure , it is doub@@ t@@ ful whether the meat that is ea@@ ten in the cold ch@@ est is the vit@@ am@@ in b@@ 12 proportion .
for ve@@ g@@ ans , there is also the possibility of using the co@@ en@@ zy@@ me in the form of tab@@ lets .
&quot; my b@@ 12 values are fine &quot; , he explains .
we must be a great champi@@ on in food procurement .
there are basic food@@ stuffs , after all , everywhere and every super@@ market has so@@ ya milk and other products .
all i need is a little bit of a place .
only occa@@ sion@@ ally i buy something special .
&quot; many people over@@ look that it is only the finished products that are expensive , but that is how it is with &quot; ordinary &quot; finished products , as we know , &quot; he said .
anyway , the preparation of vege@@ t@@ arian dishes is much cheaper than the preparation of a ve@@ gan dish .
&quot; in the house kitchen there is much to discover , with a few small tr@@ ic@@ ks you can enjoy good if not partially better results , &quot; says proc@@ tor .
mar@@ gar@@ ine instead of but@@ ter , a little more ba@@ king pow@@ der and carbon ac@@ id instead of eg@@ g , with its ve@@ gan cheese ca@@ ke , proc@@ tor could also am@@ a@@ ze his s@@ wor@@ n parents .
family celebra@@ tions give ve@@ gan a new sp@@ ice .
this has mom@@ ent@@ um when you co@@ ok together , it has a new value .
&quot; the situations that can arise are so different as the people themselves &quot; , says pro@@ k@@ tor .
of course , he has already been s@@ cep@@ tical .
taste my food not like any@@ more ?
&quot; should i feel bad now , because i drink milk ? &quot; - at sol@@ cher@@ le@@ i , i have to ask as a ve@@ gan with fing@@ er@@ prin@@ ts .
&quot; i reject people not , but i am part of this society , &quot; i want proc@@ tor not to be an enc@@ la@@ ve .
and , more precisely , the everyday world does not seem so ali@@ en as it seems - and the ve@@ gan does not appear as in everyday life as in the general sense .
fast food is also allowed .
pom@@ mes is everywhere !
&quot; many don@@ ors offer false profits , but they are not .
in a piz@@ zer@@ ia , it de@@ vi@@ ates from pa@@ sta dishes or orders a piz@@ za without cheese .
the restaurants are so slowly coming up with it .
&quot; when i started 13 years ago , i was ve@@ gan .
&quot; if enough demand comes , they may be inc@@ lined to accept the food card .
ve@@ gan restaurants develop , such as the com@@ b &apos;s in man@@ n@@ heim or the café vo@@ gel@@ fre@@ i .
proc@@ tor wants to make sure that other restaurants can at least have a ve@@ gan dish on the menu .
basically , ve@@ g@@ ans are dishes for all .
everyone can eat them , so they are the opposite of exclusive .
&quot; meat dishes are exclusive , however , and in the tru@@ est sense of the word , because they exclu@@ de others &quot; , proc@@ tor notes .
&quot; if you want to avoid food scand@@ als , ve@@ gan@@ ism is a safe way to treat the vast majority of the food from the outset . &quot;
the purchase of ve@@ gan products can be something difficult at the beginning .
especially when you learn to understand that this is also used in pe@@ an@@ u@@ ts animal addi@@ tives as a color gi@@ ver , you seem to be satisfied with the eth@@ ics of so many hur@@ d@@ les and fall quickly of courage .
not only because of this , re@@ u@@ ben proc@@ tor and lars th@@ om@@ sen wrote a book : &quot; ve@@ gan@@ is@@ sim@@ o - animal ingredients and their alternatives &quot; explains the many ingredients that are used in food and also in cleaning .
&quot; gradually , a scan@@ ner looks and knows how to look at the signs and lo@@ gos .
ve@@ gan@@ ism , he is an important moral fing@@ er , and he is poin@@ ting to awareness .
perhaps he is not quite able to change his hab@@ its , but at least he can tell the consumer what he is doing to keep his hab@@ its critical .
the exchange operator nas@@ da@@ q om@@ x keeps its customers in a@@ te@@ m .
trade at nas@@ da@@ q options market is now open on friday afternoon .
in a communication the operator made technical problems responsible .
the other 11 us option markets , including two of the nas@@ da@@ q om@@ x , continued their business un@@ impe@@ ded .
the recent incident involves a whole series of small and larger break@@ down@@ s in the stock market operator .
only on tuesday , the in@@ d@@ ices of nas@@ da@@ q were closed due to errors in data transport .
in august of this year , in a week alone , there were two break@@ down@@ s .
first , the us investment bank gol@@ d@@ man s@@ ach@@ s had been hit by bul@@ k bu@@ gs in the options markets due to technical problems .
the first time that the stock market operators had to pay the price of the order was almost a day .
two days later , half of the total share trading in the us came to an end due to a computer cr@@ ash at the nas@@ da@@ q exchange for several hours .
the first of these was the stock market opening of fa@@ ç@@ e@@ book last year .
the nas@@ da@@ q systems were the flo@@ od of purchasing and sales forces in the united states .

tax on foreign real estate owners against london ’ s spec@@ u@@ lative bu@@ b@@ ble

co@@ ok said : “ after the increases in st@@ amp tax on high-@@ price investment , the government is now introducing the associated legislation against a circum@@ vention .
“ but this move could dis@@ courage some foreign investors , which could make buying real estate in london , or owners of it .
first class real estate – the top five to ten percent of the housing market by price – in the weal@@ thy south west west of london , the most distinguished of full london ’ s west bel@@ t .

scientists have been able to sh@@ ed more light on the context in which the pregn@@ ancy of a dog is related to its mo@@ od .
previous research has shown that happ@@ iness is a problem with pregn@@ ant dogs rather than the co@@ ck .
but now scientists say that other dogs will not have these sub@@ tle differences and respond to them .
professor geor@@ gio v@@ all@@ or@@ ti@@ gar@@ a , a neu@@ ros@@ ci@@ enti@@ sts at the university of tren@@ to , said : “ man knows well that the left and right bra@@ ins are different on sti@@ m@@ ulation .
we have tried to do this for other species .
he also noticed that in dogs , like in humans , the rights of the brain half are important for the movement of the left side and vice vers@@ a , and that the two h@@ emis@@ p@@ he@@ res have different roles in emo@@ tions .
to learn more about how dogs are placed on the side of the tail of their bre@@ ed , please read the section on the side of the dog .
they measure the heart rate of the four-@@ leg@@ ged and analy@@ zed the behavior .
we will probably soon understand why pregn@@ ancy is so hot and so on .
professor v@@ all@@ or@@ ti@@ gar@@ a said : “ we have the dogs movies with dogs that we have shown – either a true version of nature or a sil@@ hou@@ ette to see di@@ str@@ acting other aspects .
if the animals saw a otherwise ext@@ inc@@ t man , the dog would have to turn the tail to the right ( from the perspective of the we@@ aring dog ) .
but was the mo@@ od pre@@ domin@@ antly left ( again from the perspective of the dog , the weather , the dog ) so the rise of your heart rate and you saw un@@ quiet .
professor mar@@ t@@ ine@@ z believes that the european union is communic@@ ating not ab@@ rup@@ tly with each other through these movements .
it is convinced that the dogs from experience have learned to play in the movements they have wor@@ ried about and when not .
he said : ‘ if you have different encoun@@ ters with other dogs and you want to we@@ dge with your tail in one direction rather with friendly behavior , and the rights side is more of a less friendly behavior , then you ’ ll react on basis .
researchers say that the findings of h@@ oun@@ de@@ be@@ are@@ rs , veter@@ in@@ arians and tra@@ in@@ ers will help to understand the emo@@ tions of their animal .
john br@@ ad@@ sha@@ w , expert on dog behavior and hospitality , has been working on the fac@@ ul@@ ty of animal heal@@ ing at the university of bri@@ st@@ ol to explain that this is not the first study to be studied .
last year , a team of the university of l@@ inc@@ ol@@ n found that dogs had left their head , when they had an aggres@@ sive dog .
in another research project at the university of victori@@ a in canada , the following article was : “ dogs tend to go to a robo@@ t dog when their dog is not hun@@ ted .
he says that the differences could arise because the h@@ ats in the different studies are not the animals in the films or the robo@@ ts .
a study of how dogs can be re@@ acted to real dogs could help , he explained .
“ although there are considerable evidence for many different m@@ am@@ m@@ als that the two bra@@ ins are not responsible for different purposes , they are still required to be examined .
as their behaviour is simply recorded , they will be used for a long time .

po@@ pe franc@@ is appointed president of the european parliament in february .
po@@ pe franc@@ is will attend the meeting of the new car@@ din@@ als of the catho@@ lic church on 22 february , as the v@@ ati@@ can announced on thursday .
car@@ din@@ als are the highest cl@@ er@@ ics in the catal@@ an language .
there are currently 20@@ 1 car@@ din@@ als .
however , a car@@ din@@ al who has an age of 80 years cannot be interested in the po@@ pe &apos;s election – that is one of the 120 “ election privile@@ ges ” in a group of car@@ din@@ als .
in a statement in which the news was announced , pat@@ er federal reserve said : &quot; the world is not yet a single person , but a single person .
po@@ pe franc@@ is
j@@ ack val@@ ero of catho@@ lic vo@@ ices said that the european union &apos;s number of eligible voters is about 20 % below the number of car@@ din@@ als .
he explained that a po@@ pe appointed a man as many car@@ din@@ als as necessary , so that the number of eligible voters could be reduced .
the consistency story next year is therefore important .
at the moment , there is a certain over@@ han@@ g on europe &apos;s side , and particularly on italy &apos;s .
“ it will be interesting to see if the new po@@ pe kar@@ din@@ ä@@ le from the rest of the world will ap@@ point to restore the balance , ” he said .
for@@ ty per cent of ca@@ th@@ ol@@ ics live in south america , but they have only a tiny number of car@@ din@@ als .
the car@@ din@@ als will also be the first to be established since the formation of the church , founded by franc@@ is , in the car@@ din@@ als , a group of eight car@@ din@@ als .
in the past , the po@@ pe decided everything alone .
“ now franc@@ is has won these eight car@@ din@@ als , which he can help , ” he said .
he said that it is “ well possible ” that franc@@ is would have to leave the car@@ din@@ als for advice .
but we have not been in this position – and this is all new .
val@@ ero said that typically the most bi@@ g@@ ge@@ d-@@ sized bis@@ ho@@ ps were car@@ din@@ als .

for this reason , they do not comply with the federal guidelines for vehicle safety on head@@ rest .
“ when from the back of the vehicle , the car can be moved to the front re@@ stra@@ int .
the re@@ tri@@ ev@@ ed models were re@@ viewed between 1 august and 10 september .
the delivery of g@@ m tr@@ uc@@ ks began in june and is the most important model launch of the leading us car manufacturer since the in@@ solv@@ ency related restructuring in 2009 .
g@@ m informed vehicle owners in the first october session of more than 50 % of the vehicle &apos;s weight .
the n@@ h@@ t@@ sa was unable to reach a compromise on the basis of the 16@@ -@@ day government shut@@ down , which had a negative impact on car sales .
the sale of sil@@ ver@@ ado and sier@@ ra tr@@ uc@@ ks , which are planned for the 20@@ 14 model , is in the first ten months of the year at 20 % .

des@@ pair of an obama constitu@@ ent
i have asked president obama twice to meet the united states in the hope that change will be possible .
he says obama has comm@@ end@@ able efforts to improve the situation affected by the bloc@@ k@@ ade detail of republic@@ ans .
the policy of bloc@@ k@@ ade does not exc@@ use the website problems of ob@@ am@@ ac@@ are , the dr@@ one attacks and the use of dr@@ one attacks on the internet .
obama ’ s mem@@ o@@ irs of the 2008 election campaign are a sad remin@@ der of what is possible .
na@@ than@@ i@@ el p. mor@@ r@@ is is a student in the second year of har@@ v@@ ard medical school in new york .
i am reading a terrible sad story at the moment .
it is a book i have believed would be a book of my life during the dark period of the second year of my medical studies .
it is called “ the aud@@ acity to win ” ( courage to win ) and describes the mem@@ o@@ irs of bar@@ ack obama ’ s presidential election .
when i am in the evening with my patient records and go to bed , i get a little bit of a time when i was a polic@@ y@@ maker who inspired millions and gave a speech a little bit of a smo@@ ke .
the election was a lands@@ li@@ de victory and news spo@@ kes@@ man held .
my class@@ mates we@@ pt for joy and my parents collected all the newspapers , which they could find .
a young team of vi@@ sion@@ aries was on the way to the white house and the nation was ready for change .
when obama took office in 2008 , he had agreed to the us $ 82 % mar@@ gin of approval .
and then i close the book .
re@@ swit@@ ching to the present is a bad awa@@ k@@ ening , as if you were driven out of a dream .
it is difficult to stick to these optim@@ istic times – they seem to be a v@@ ague memory , a sad memory , a v@@ ague memory of missed opportunities .
in the years since i first voted , i have been able to change something .
but it is simply nothing i would have imag@@ ined .
i appreciate the great and varied things that have been done by obama , from the adoption of the aff@@ iliation to the creation of a new united states health insurance agency .
i agree that the european union &apos;s party political bloc@@ k@@ ade should be too much of an effort to be made to resolve our nation &apos;s problems .
but , having heard the obama administration repeatedly to colleagues and well-known representatives , i am convinced that the eu ’ s failure to explain itself is a sign of the end .
i have one point of political des@@ pair .
the republic@@ an bloc@@ k@@ ade policy cannot explain why it is not possible to prevent the inter@@ cep@@ tion of foreign leaders or to stop the killing of inno@@ cent children by dr@@ ones in over@@ seas .
it cannot explain why the national security agency has not provided data on the private life of americans .
it cannot explain why an@@ war al-@@ aw@@ la@@ ki , a us american politici@@ an , was without trial .
it does not justify the results of a report which says that efforts by the white house to calm down the media are the ‘ aggres@@ sive ’ media .
and , most recently , it cannot exc@@ use the in@@ ability to work in the more than three years since the adoption of the affir@@ m@@ able care act .
i do not know if that is what i would have expected .
whether i would have understood with 18 that government work would have made the political campaigns that prece@@ ded it contradic@@ t what it was .
obviously , the members &apos; office is not a predic@@ table course , as an opposition party and ran@@ dom events such as the new@@ town@@ -@@ mass@@ ac@@ re have made public discussion a thing of the past .
but if i look at the examples above , it seems to be largely the government itself that has chosen them .
and that bo@@ thers me most .
i have re-@@ elected obama in 2012 , not because i am concerned about his candi@@ d@@ acy .
mit@@ t ro@@ m@@ ney was a conf@@ using and un@@ balanced statement .
i had the impression that i had a second term for obama , free from the pressure of future elections , that would fulfil the hope we have been hearing about for so long .
but , with the decline in the approval rat@@ ings for obama to less than 45 % this week , the return to 2008 is all the more severe by this book .
it awa@@ k@@ ens in me the desire for the many promises that have been made that have dis@@ appeared into the air .
this week i read a section in the book descri@@ bing how obama can avoid a serious loss against clin@@ ton in the pre-@@ election campaign in pen@@ n@@ sy@@ l@@ v@@ ania .
in a meeting with the election help@@ ers following the decision , he told his staff that they had to get back on course and follow the purpose of their cause .
“ i want us to keep our magic back , ” he said .
we must remember who we are .
five years later , mr. pre@@ sid@@ ent , and i could tell you no more .

cli@@ ve pal@@ mer claims prime minister ton@@ y ab@@ bot@@ t has been in conflict with interests in paren@@ tal leave .
the bil@@ li@@ on@@ air@@ e and me@@ p cli@@ ve pal@@ mer says that prime minister ton@@ y ab@@ bot@@ t is in a conflict of interest in his plans for paren@@ tal leave because his dau@@ gh@@ ters are pregn@@ ant and could therefore benefit from it .
the mining mag@@ n@@ at that is located in a judicial dispute over the payment of 6 million dollars to co2 taxes is a major challenge to the claim that the mining mag@@ n@@ at was wi@@ ping out questions about whether it is in conflict .
the pal@@ mer united party could hold up to four votes in the sen@@ ate , which is important for the decision whether the co2 and other mining industries will be abol@@ ished or cut .
but pal@@ mer claimed that only ministers had conflicts of interest and that the subsidi@@ aries of ab@@ bot@@ t had been personally benef@@ iting from the laws .
&quot; he is in a major conflict of interest when it comes to paid paren@@ tal leave .
two months after the election , the pal@@ mer election commission declared that it would be possible to reach a majority of the votes by 53 votes in advance after the re@@ count .
pal@@ mer called for a review of the voting process , which would allow it to proceed more quickly .
ton@@ y ab@@ bot@@ t ’ s dau@@ gh@@ ters fran@@ ces and brid@@ get .
if these elections were to take place two months after the end of the vote ?
“ we need a better system , ” he said .
why should we not have a system where you can inv@@ ent , which would send the data to a computer , immediately choose and then ask for 6 : 30 in the evening ?
pal@@ mer also cri@@ tici@@ zed the use of p@@ enc@@ ils when marking the bal@@ lot papers .
if you use them , because you can er@@ ase the results if you don &apos;t like them ?
nowadays , to coordinate with p@@ enc@@ ils is incredible .
the electoral commission has carefully examined the options for electronic voting and recently adopted a joint legislative proposal with new ze@@ al@@ and .
pal@@ mer , 59 , explained that to his policy an international airport for sun@@ sh@@ ine coast is needed .
a public office is about the service of the public .
“ we are not seeking re@@ ward other than that of history , namely that we are in a critical time of this community , ” he said .
r@@ bs sus@@ pen@@ ds two fore@@ x trad@@ ers
the royal bank of scotland has two deal@@ ers in its foreign exchange department .
some of the world ’ s largest banks , including u@@ bs , bar@@ cla@@ ys , deutsche bank , and r@@ bs , confirmed that they had been in contact with the authorities in the world ’ s largest financial market , where 5.@@ 3 tr@@ il@@ lion dollars are tr@@ il@@ lion dollars a day .
the two deal@@ ers would be the first r@@ bs employees to be employed in the expanding investigation .
the bank , which has not comm@@ ented on the suspension , has confirmed that the bank is not in a position to receive information from authorities .
“ our investigation into this subject goes on and we cooperate fully with the f@@ ca and other regulatory bodies . ”
last month , the situation gave close people the message that r@@ bs would not read the records of e-@@ ma@@ ils and inst@@ ant messages sent from and to a former distribu@@ tor .
this deal@@ er , richard us@@ her , had the r@@ bs 2010 leave and is now expected to leave from its current position as european head of fore@@ x spot trading at j@@ p@@ mor@@ gan .
ro@@ h@@ an ram@@ ch@@ and@@ ani , head of the european spot trading company cit@@ i , was arrested this week and ma@@ iled to mat@@ t gar@@ din@@ er , form@@ erly chief currency trad@@ er at bar@@ cla@@ ys and u@@ bs .
none of these trad@@ ers has been accused of any mis@@ conduct .
inst@@ ant mess@@ aging group of us@@ her included ban@@ kers among bar@@ cla@@ ys and the ci@@ ti@@ group , they said the situation was close .
u@@ bs announced this week that they are taking steps against some of their employees after the swiss regulatory authority fin@@ ma declared that they would be a cour@@ ageous person to man@@ ip@@ ulate the fore@@ x market in a number of swiss banks .
at least six authorities worldwide – the european commission , fin@@ ma , the swiss competition authority we@@ ko , the f@@ ca , the us ministry of justice , and the hong kong monetary authority – have been dealing with this issue .
h@@ s@@ bc , ci@@ ti@@ group , j@@ p@@ mor@@ gan and credit su@@ is@@ se have also conducted internal investigations or in@@ qui@@ ries for information from authorities , said with the situation familiar persons .
banks get in touch with inst@@ ant messages and e-@@ ma@@ ils from several years of searching for cases of mal@@ practice .
the news of these investigations has been dis@@ semin@@ ated to the trad@@ ers in an area that has been growing at a rate of profit in recent years .
some ban@@ kers have tried to down@@ play the aff@@ air and said that there is almost no way of stop@@ ping the extensive and highly acc@@ laim@@ ed liqui@@ dity of the foreign exchange market that is being sold to leading trad@@ ers .
a leading trad@@ er noticed that despite the enormous daily volume in the fore@@ x trading , the frag@@ ment@@ ation of the liqui@@ dity between the various trading platforms was not yet fully understood and the increasing use of their own internal platforms by banks .
the news came out the same day , when credit su@@ is@@ se announced that it had announced this week to a deal@@ er in their london exchange tr@@ aded funds office .
the bank promp@@ tly informed the competent authorities and co@@ operated with them .
“ we are sure that the deal@@ er has acted alone and that the matter will be contained , ” said cred@@ it su@@ is@@ se .
the building f@@ ence on the bec@@ h@@ le p@@ lot pain@@ ts the wooden p@@ lot .
a group of citizens &apos; initiative &quot; swiss me@@ ado@@ ws &quot; has been bloc@@ king the bau@@ z@@ au@@ n on the bec@@ ht@@ le p@@ lot at the spa promen@@ ade in bad her@@ ren@@ al@@ b .
moreover , the us government clean@@ ed and wi@@ den@@ ed the foot@@ path , as it says in a press release .
the planned coverage of the dec@@ ay@@ ing house in the re@@ ar part of the property was not possible for security reasons , because the site is threatened with sli@@ de .
al@@ f@@ red ab@@ el , who currently man@@ ages the property , had the beauti@@ fication action with his colleague rein@@ hard p@@ ou@@ ch@@ ner from the bi .
before the bi ’ s action , a transparent message was sent out with the message &apos; we are in favour &apos; .
this bo@@ thered the 20 or so members of the citizens &apos; initiative little in their action .
your mo@@ tto on the big pos@@ ter was &quot; we are against building rus@@ h &quot; .
it was intended to respond to the threat of even greater ru@@ ins on the swiss me@@ ado@@ w - should the giant project one day fail .
in the con@@ vers@@ ation with many pas@@ ser@@ s-@@ by in front of the building site it became clear that some citizens believe that the implementation of the city project will improve many , although many ask the same questions to the dimension of the presented project .
but they are beginning to re@@ sign because the city has to go further in respon@@ ding to these questions , it is on the bi ’ s side .
as was heard , the effects of public statements by the may@@ or are also evident .
may had a special meeting of the local counc@@ ill@@ ors , which was to be the reason for his fear of the thermal bath , should the population vote against the plans for a bathing and wellness complex on the swiss me@@ ado@@ w .
some seem to be quite fri@@ ghten@@ ed because others are s@@ cep@@ tical of &quot; cru@@ de behaviour &quot; .

ran@@ king sli@@ pped for ch@@ ir@@ is : man@@ e no ro@@ d , no s@@ wal@@ low king , no s@@ wal@@ low king .
however satisfied ran@@ k@@ ings , the ran@@ king is with the current high shape of bun@@ des@@ lig@@ a table leader red bu@@ ll salzburg , so dis@@ appoin@@ ting was the sports director of the &quot; bu@@ lls &quot; from the re@@ fe@@ re@@ es .
&quot; there is currently a dangerous trend for man@@ e and al@@ an to be included in the category of sh@@ wal@@ ben@@ k@@ ings , &quot; he took the two off@@ ensive wi@@ res .
the latest occasion for ran@@ king criticism was that yellow was for man@@ e at the 3 : 0 against gr@@ ö@@ di@@ g last sunday , at which the sen@@ eg@@ al@@ ese was given a supposed ac@@ t@@ ing-@@ show - the release .
&quot; a bl@@ at@@ ant mis@@ decision , &quot; ran@@ gn@@ ick said , the re@@ fe@@ ree har@@ k@@ am as &quot; completely over@@ loaded &quot; .
har@@ k@@ am would also have &quot; his part &quot; to es@@ cal@@ ate between salzburg co@@ ach ro@@ ger sch@@ mid@@ t and gr@@ ö@@ di@@ g-@@ tra@@ iner ad@@ i h@@ ü@@ t@@ ter after the match .
his german comp@@ at@@ ri@@ ot was def@@ ended deci@@ sively : &apos; i would have liked to have beha@@ ved in the same way in every situation as ro@@ ger sch@@ mid@@ t &apos; .
sch@@ mid@@ t himself wants to be a member of the german association of the german federal republic after the sch@@ mid@@ t sch@@ mid@@ t sch@@ mid@@ t himself has had no contact with his colleague after the sch@@ arm@@ mu@@ t@@ zer with his h@@ ü@@ t@@ ter .
i do not know why .
&quot; for i am the one who insul@@ ts , &quot; he stressed .
given the success of the event , ran@@ k@@ ings agreed to a comm@@ end@@ ation of the event .
&quot; there are only two words for this : good , &quot; he said .
there is not much to be dis@@ missed .
the way in which the commission &apos;s team plays , in particular , is impressive .
this should continue .
changes in the ve@@ ins in winter transfer time will hardly be possible .
there are no great reasons to change anything .
&quot; except a player jo@@ ins with the desire that he or she wants to leave the club , &quot; ran@@ gn@@ ick made clear .
superior court confir@@ ms obama ’ s health law
it is a great victory for the obama administration : the us supreme court has decided to hold a referendum on the constitution , closely linked to bar@@ ack obama .
with five votes to four , the jud@@ ges rul@@ ed that the individual mandate of the patient protection and aff@@ ord@@ able care act was not a matter for us jud@@ ges to decide by 20@@ 14 whether to take out health insurance or impose a penalty .
the chief judge john ro@@ ber@@ ts suggested that the united states should be on the side of the four more liberal members of the chamber , while jud@@ ges sc@@ alia , thomas , ali@@ to and ken@@ ne@@ dy chose to vote against .
the court also confirmed the remaining provisions of the code of 27@@ 00 pages .
the case against the law was fil@@ ed by 26 states and the national federation of independent states .
the law was signed by all leading republic@@ an presidential candidates , including the ultimate challeng@@ er .

due to the low level of sun@@ light , the ve@@ st@@ f@@ j@@ ord@@ -@@ valley is a little bit s@@ lower from autumn to spring .

some tal@@ ented people turned on sun@@ chairs , others continued to use them safe@@ ly .
until now , sun@@ -@@ hun@@ gr@@ y people had to go to a nearby summit with a cable car in winter .
ten years ago , the local artist martin an@@ der@@ sen presented the proposal to create mir@@ r@@ ors for the valley .
these basic ideas were not present for the first time since 19@@ 13 .
after several years of debate , the city council finally had the 5 million cro@@ wn@@ s ( around 6@@ 15 000 euros ) expensive project adopted .
a similar construction has been providing the italian alpine resort of vi@@ gan@@ ella with winter sun@@ shine for several years .
mail leaves scar@@ ce@@ ly any more on sun@@ days
&quot; many citizens will not notice it yet , the red points for the sunday night .
a request from the f@@ dp confirmed this .
on sun@@ days and holidays , only before the post office in the ern@@ st-@@ lu@@ d@@ wi@@ g street 36 and in the j@@ ak@@ o@@ b m@@ ü@@ ll@@ er-@@ stras@@ se 1 in h@@ ü@@ t@@ ten@@ fel@@ d .
whether in ho@@ f@@ heim and ros@@ eng@@ ar@@ ten , there is also sunday empty , the answer to the question from the f@@ dp is not answered .
social and youth policy spo@@ kes@@ man of the f@@ dp , fr@@ it@@ z ro@@ h@@ ren@@ bec@@ k , wants to re@@ me@@ dy this .
the de@@ vo@@ tion to sun@@ days is an important postal service , especially for termin@@ post .

thomas bit@@ t@@ ner , group and city association of the german liberal , democr@@ at and reform party , supports his group colleague : &apos; what an@@ no@@ ys me is the fact that there is a secret le@@ tting time being changed or changed here . &apos;
the hotel is close to the citizens and is a miles away from the post office .
&quot; at least the post boxes in the districts of neu@@ sch@@ lo@@ ß and ros@@ eng@@ ar@@ ten must be empty again on sun@@ days &quot; , says bit@@ t@@ ner and tu@@ e@@ ren@@ bec@@ k un@@ is@@ on@@ o .
there are also plans for the nuclear city , especially not mobile citizens , to have a mail@@ box with a sunday empty , even in the meantime .
tu@@ bes bec@@ k asked in the city parliament whether the city administration had had discussions with the post about this matter .
may@@ or er@@ ich ma@@ i@@ er rep@@ lied that the post did not work with lam@@ per@@ the@@ im .
to his knowledge , however , there are no translations available in ho@@ f@@ heim .

&quot; then decisions are taken elsewhere , &quot; said ma@@ i@@ er .
the hotel is located in the centre of frankfurt , close to the main train station and the city centre .
parking in frankfurt could soon be more expensive than parking in the city .
the mag@@ i@@ str@@ ate of the city is discussing a proposal for transport decentr@@ alisation this morning .
the parking charges are therefore to be increased by 50 % .
but this is not to raise prices , but to increase time inter@@ val between parking c@@ loc@@ ks and parking ticket machines from 30 to 20 minutes .
in december , the city council regulation will have to decide .
the european parliament &apos;s committee on retail trade believes that this is not a good idea .
the hotel is very close to the train station and the train station .
the transport club germany believes that a 20 % increase in the form of a two-@@ dec@@ ade@@ -@@ long increase is &apos; quite appropriate and long over@@ due &apos; .
public transport will also be more expensive .

the el@@ ders were faced with an experienced team , but they were not .
the first of these was the &quot; k@@ ol@@ ac@@ ny &quot; ( &quot; the first &quot; ) , which was the first of the two , and the first of the two , which was the first of the three , which was the first of its kind .
with the hard and placed supple@@ ments , the european union ’ s spon@@ sors took a very heavy step .
repeatedly , they missed the opportunity offered by sim@@ on sch@@ en@@ k and e@@ du@@ ard schul@@ z to clean the gri@@ d ’ s pass@@ ports and attacks and were not very helpful in bloc@@ king .
two high first pri@@ zes clearly expressed the superi@@ ority of the fre@@ u@@ den@@ stadt in all matters .
in the face of this crus@@ hing and gam@@ bling achievement , the third sentence was then somewhat la@@ x and l@@ ous@@ y to the 3 : 0 final ( 25 : 13 , 25 : 14 , 25 : 22 ) .

in the b class , the mur@@ g@@ tal@@ hal@@ le in ba@@ i@@ er@@ s@@ br@@ on@@ n had the second teams from ba@@ i@@ er@@ s@@ br@@ on@@ n and fre@@ u@@ den@@ stadt .
they delivered a har@@ d-@@ fought second life , a two-@@ hour match .
ner@@ v@@ ousness on both sides caused , in particular , the ball &apos;s as@@ sumption of mistakes and points gi@@ fts ; the pass@@ ports were also very precise at times .
in this highly balanced performance , the team agreed on a new set of training courses in the t@@ v-@@ team of mar@@ c@@ us bl@@ as@@ u@@ tto and a strong team of young and old .

he than@@ ked the present for their willingness to cooperate and stressed that the care service should be a day of good work , and that the connection between people and nature should be strengthened .
he offers every citizen the opportunity to live in nature and to develop his own personal profile .
the hotel is situated in the centre of the city , near the beach and the town centre .
this ecological aspect was explained by fri@@ e@@ deri@@ ke tri@@ bu@@ ka@@ it from the department of nature conservation of the government bureau fre@@ i@@ burg following the gre@@ e@@ ting by the ti@@ l@@ man bol@@ l@@ ach@@ er council , which is the pat@@ ron .
the tourist destination of the wide view is , according to tri@@ bu@@ ka@@ it , the aim , which has become a mu@@ ch-@@ growing old all@@ m@@ end@@ we@@ id@@ fel@@ d with its specific protected habit@@ at types , to be preserved by opening and connecting existing pa@@ st@@ ures .
certain species , such as rare but@@ ter@@ f@@ lies and gr@@ ass@@ lands , can break down barriers in the form of forest areas .
you need these free connections to biodiversity .
tri@@ bu@@ ka@@ it said she wanted to do it here .

in 2011 , google announced an initial bid for more than 9@@ 00 million dollars for nor@@ tel patents .
google increased its offer several times and offered a last 4.@@ 4 billion us dollars .
after the nor@@ tel pat@@ ent@@ ability of ro@@ ck@@ star has been out@@ bid , ro@@ ck@@ star acquired mobil@@ it@@ y-@@ 12@@ ,@@ 5 billion us dollars , a business that also contributed to some of motor@@ ola ’ s library of patents .

mo@@ ham@@ med mor@@ si is putting the o@@ ath of office down , but his day of tri@@ um@@ ph will not be the end of political disputes in egypt .
the islam@@ ist mo@@ ham@@ med mor@@ si promised a “ new egypt ” to be the first to be elected president of the country .
with his in@@ aug@@ ur@@ ation before the supreme constitutional court , mor@@ si was also elected the first freely elected islam@@ ist president of the arab world and egypt ’ s fifth head of state since the fall of the mon@@ arch@@ y around 60 years ago .
he put the o@@ ath before the 18 in black ro@@ bes , and he was brought to the court , which was based on the n@@ ile and was an ancient egyp@@ tian temple .
“ we strive for a better future , a new egypt and a second republic , ” said mor@@ si at the cere@@ mony , the president ’ s live state television cere@@ mony .
“ today , the egyp@@ tian people have laid the foundation for a new life – absolute freedom , a true democracy , and stability , ” said mur@@ si , a six@@ ty year-@@ old american , a us engine@@ er and member of the muslim bro@@ ther@@ hood .
hundreds of soldiers and police officers guar@@ ded the building when mur@@ si was killed shortly after 11 a.m.
just a few hundred sup@@ porters had been arrested in the court to give the new president a chance to re@@ jo@@ ice , and contrary to the presidential pr@@ un@@ k from the mu@@ bar@@ ak era , transport was only stopped for a short time , so the car maker .
as an un@@ char@@ is@@ matic &quot; spare wheel &quot; of the bro@@ ther@@ hood , his personal pres@@ ent-@@ day presti@@ ge has been mo@@ cking since his victory and a friday speech in which he has not only been a candidate for islam@@ ists , but also all .
“ egypt is today a civil , national , constitutional , and modern state , ” the president of the republic of egypt declared in a blue suit with a red ti@@ e .
later , mor@@ si dro@@ ve to the university of ca@@ iro , where he delivered his in@@ aug@@ ural speech .
it was officially signed by an army cha@@ pel , which was the national an@@ them , to which he was appointed in a position of pos@@ session .
the military leader , fel@@ d@@ mar@@ sh@@ al hus@@ sein tan@@ ta@@ w@@ i , was present .
on his arrival he was att@@ acked by hundreds of people in the largest aud@@ it@@ ori@@ um of the university with vo@@ ices from “ the army and the people are a hand ” .
the hotel was built in 19@@ 08 as bas@@ tion of sec@@ ular education and is situated in the heart of the city in the 197@@ 0s .
mor@@ si put a symbo@@ lic o@@ ath on the ta@@ h@@ ir@@ -@@ square on friday , the birth@@ place of the u@@ pris@@ ing , which last year ended the author@@ itarian rule of mu@@ bar@@ ak .
but , with the dis@@ appearance of official o@@ ath in the court , not , as usual , in parliament , he is bo@@ wing to the military ’ s will , which indicates that the power struggle will continue .

rap@@ es in south africa : twice life imprison@@ ment
nine months after the brut@@ al ra@@ pe and mu@@ ti@@ lation of a 17@@ -@@ year-@@ old girl , in south africa , the perpe@@ tr@@ ator has been sent@@ enced to twice life on friday .
this was reported by the channel sab@@ c .
the victim was later caught up in the consequences of serious in@@ jur@@ ies .
joh@@ ann@@ es k@@ ana was already in prison at the beginning of the week of crime .
the act had been dis@@ gr@@ ac@@ eful nation@@ wide .
the then 2@@ 1-@@ year-@@ old had an@@ ene boo@@ y@@ sen in february in an industrial site in bre@@ d@@ as@@ dor@@ p near cape town .
14 hours were the doctors fighting for the survival of the victim , but in v@@ ain .
the sight of the young was so hor@@ ri@@ ble that the care@@ rs and si@@ sters were given psycho@@ logical assistance .
k@@ ana had agreed during the trial that the tat@@ n@@ ach@@ t was going to bo@@ y@@ sen in a bar .
he also conf@@ essed that they were be@@ aten and rap@@ ed , but he denied that he was responsible for the death of the girl .
the police were initially be@@ aten by several off@@ enders , but dis@@ missed two susp@@ ects from de@@ tention , because the evidence against them was not sufficient .
the public prosecu@@ tor also stressed during the trial that it was convinced that k@@ ana had been a criminal at the time of the attack alone .
ra@@ pe is a crime in south africa , and it is estimated that around 64 000 cases of sexual violence are reported ann@@ ually .
this is almost ten times the amount in germany , but it is the same with 82 million people as south africa ( 50 million ) .
police and women &apos;s organisations in south africa appreciate the dark number of sexual violence , but the 10-@@ 2@@ 5-@@ fold number .
jum@@ bo visits the black forests ham and the ham@@ lets of the black forest .
jum@@ bo looking for the &quot; best ro@@ as@@ ted ham of the world &quot; : for the tv show &quot; galile@@ o &quot; , he visited the pro@@ 7-@@ star bon@@ n@@ dorf .
the speaker is right at the outset in making it clear that the most important thing for the ham is the pi@@ g , tur@@ bom@@ ast , not a good condition .
can ham , which can be found in any super@@ market , i.e. a quality product ?
ul@@ i , the chief of the great ham factory in the black forest , explains jum@@ bo the way the company works .
&quot; germany &apos;s favorite ham &quot; , as jum@@ bo the black forest sch@@ in@@ ken announced , is a popular dish .
only with hair protection and kit@@ tel he comes into the interior of the factory .
jum@@ bo also has to start to dis@@ inf@@ ect the hands before he can go to the micro@@ phone .
jum@@ bo to strengthen with speed lim@@ b .
&quot; here i get hor@@ ny amounts of work &quot; , the tv ma@@ st@@ ors , the black forests ham as mass product .
16@@ ,000 k@@ eu@@ ps a week speak for themselves .
weight , f@@ at content , colour : ul@@ i explains what it is all about .
most pi@@ gs are treated with six months .
television at a level ?
details such as the ph value of the meat also play a role .
the dar@@ ker the meat , the higher the ph value .
&quot; i am cur@@ ious to hear your ro@@ ber@@ to blan@@ co say that you can see what happens then , &quot; says jum@@ bo cy@@ n@@ ical .
this is where the level of private television is presented in pure culture .
but watching is still worth it .
the spec@@ t@@ ator sees that the dis@@ integration of the ch@@ as@@ ti@@ ty bel@@ t is still hand work .
for the black forest ham is tradi@@ tionally without b@@ ones in shel@@ ves .
the secret of ham is the fact that the sp@@ ices are mixed with salt .
the tower and the smo@@ ke mo@@ ist@@ ure remind jum@@ bo vis@@ ually of a &quot; sub@@ marine &quot; .
the tr@@ ick : f@@ ir branches here in the smo@@ ke provide for the special taste of the black forest ham .
20 days in the smo@@ ke make the ham finally almost black .
&quot; now the di@@ ameter of the dis@@ c dis@@ appears &quot; , he announ@@ ces the test fe@@ eding of the dis@@ c .
&quot; he &apos;s really delicious &quot; , says the conclusion of the tv star .
this will allow all parties to live .
they thought travel agencies were among the past thanks to internet ?
flight centre seems to be moving in the opposite direction .
the company has increased its ear@@ nings prospects for the whole year and exp@@ ects record income from holi@@ day@@ makers in australia and the uk .
the travel company is now moving from a adjusted annual profit before taxes between 3@@ 25 and 3@@ 40 million dollars , compared with $ 30@@ 5 to 3@@ 15 million in its previous forec@@ ast .
if the current target values are achieved , then that means growth of between 12 and 17 % compared to the record profit of 2@@ 9@@ 0.@@ 4 million dollars in the period 2011 / 12 .
as managing director gra@@ ham tur@@ ner announced , f@@ light centre achieved a profit of eur 8 % in the first half of the year and had a strong start in the second half , especially in austr@@ ali@@ an and british private business .
“ since the beginning of the year , our ten countries have been prof@@ itable , and some of them are on the way to record annual income before interest and tax , ” he said .
these include australia and the united kingdom , which are typically among our strong@@ est benefici@@ aries .
in australia , the leisure industry has changed significantly in the second half of the year , which has created a slightly weak@@ er market for business trips .
the same good was for the leisure business of flight centre in the uk , while here too business customers spend less .
the us business reco@@ vered from the year 2008 to the weak@@ er year , so that the third year in a row ear@@ nings for the whole year are expected .
the shares of flight centre rose by 3 c@@ ents yesterday to 3@@ 8.@@ 20 dollars .
schools are becoming more focused on mathem@@ a@@ tics , legal and political science .
in courses on english literature , students must in future learn at least one piece of sha@@ kes@@ pe@@ are , a novel of the 19th century , romantic ly@@ ric@@ s and contemporary british nov@@ els from 19@@ 14 on@@ wards .
the test also includes “ un@@ seen texts ” , to see broad coverage of the subject .
the combined course of english literature and language is completed .
from 20@@ 15 , students must have an independent g@@ c@@ se examination for language , with strong incentives to learn english language .
the ministry of education will tomorrow present the new cur@@ ricul@@ um for english and mathem@@ a@@ tics – the first subjects that have been rad@@ ically re@@ designed .
other core subjects will be changed next year .
in a separate initiative , of@@ qua@@ al , the supervisory authority for aud@@ its , will undertake a re@@ organization of g@@ c@@ se structures , including a new ben@@ ding system and less cur@@ ricul@@ um work .
in a speech in the summer , education minister michael go@@ ve said that there is a “ broad consensus that we need to reform our audit system to restore public confidence . ”
studies show that in english schools , there is less time for mathem@@ a@@ tics – 1@@ 16 hours per year or three hours per week per school year – than in most other countries .
on the other hand , austr@@ ali@@ an schools te@@ ach on average 14@@ 3 hours a year and students in sing@@ apor@@ e receive 13@@ 8 hours .
there will be no formal requirement to make a full list of available lessons for mathem@@ a@@ tics , but the lessons will be difficult for coalition members to understand .
the cur@@ ricul@@ um focuses more on “ problems arising from the right life ” , including financial mathem@@ a@@ tics .

sal@@ em : joh@@ anna ra@@ h@@ ner at the ec@@ um@@ en@@ ical forum of talks in ec@@ um@@ en@@ ical con@@ vers@@ ation in ec@@ um@@ en@@ ical con@@ vers@@ ation in ec@@ um@@ en@@ ical con@@ vers@@ ation in ec@@ um@@ en@@ ical dialogue .
the next ec@@ um@@ en@@ ical forum on monday , 21 october in the new museum of the castle is about the topic &quot; on the hel@@ l with hel@@ l - the@@ ological considerations on today &apos;s handling of the last things &quot; .
the lec@@ ture@@ r is professor joh@@ anna ra@@ h@@ ner .
the ec@@ um@@ en@@ ical forum of talks is an initiative of the catho@@ lic and ev@@ angel@@ ical church communities of sal@@ em , the sal@@ em castle and the cultural centre of the lake con@@ stance .
joh@@ anna ra@@ h@@ ner wants to look into the question in the forum of how people today can see the &quot; last things &quot; after death .
if people had been able to benefit too much from this in the past centuries , and had to wait for the images of heav@@ en and hel@@ l that have &quot; shaped our ideas to this day &quot; , the contemporary pro@@ ph@@ ec@@ y doc@@ tr@@ ine is derived from the full .
&quot; the greater hope is christian , through the religious tradition of the church of jesus christ .
she has &quot; helped us with so many question marks that the interpretation of the declaration marks is not available to us . &quot;
joh@@ anna ra@@ h@@ ner goes on to say , &apos; but the crucial challenge remains the an@@ ger of death &apos; .
this brings to mind the question of the long@@ ing &quot; which dreams of being on the end all being good .
joh@@ anna ra@@ h@@ ner , born in 196@@ 2 in bad@@ en-@@ ba@@ den , studied at the university of bad@@ en-@@ ba@@ den from 198@@ 2 to 1989 and studied catho@@ lic the@@ ology and bio@@ logy .
she gradu@@ ated in 1997 from the university of applied sciences in fre@@ i@@ burg .
the hab@@ ilitation of fundamental the@@ ology and ec@@ um@@ en@@ ical the@@ ology was followed in 2003 at the west@@ ph@@ ali@@ an wil@@ hel@@ ms university .
since 2010 , joh@@ anna ra@@ h@@ ner has held a chair for systematic the@@ ology at the institute of catho@@ lic the@@ ology of the university of kas@@ sel .
ge@@ is@@ ling@@ en : more than 100 young ca@@ th@@ ol@@ ics from the small heu@@ berg re@@ affir@@ m their faith in the church at the fir@@ m@@ ness .
in two services of god 10@@ 1 15 and 16@@ -@@ year-@@ old te@@ en@@ ag@@ ers of the sou@@ l@@ ward unit are fir@@ med at the small heu@@ berg .
the church service was accompanied by the group lau@@ da ’ s si@@ te. in the afternoon of the youth cho@@ ir the spirit .
the reception of the fir@@ m@@ sac@@ ram@@ ent meant that the young said yes to their b@@ ap@@ tism and asked the power of the holy spirit .
the fir@@ m@@ l@@ ings had changed over the past few months , under the direction of di@@ ak@@ on rein@@ er stre@@ iner and the help of numerous community members on the great fe@@ ast day .
in different projects they learned various tasks of christian community .
ill@@ men@@ see : second mountain bike trail in the alps .
in fine weather 2@@ 14 bicycle ri@@ ders came to ill@@ men@@ see to enjoy the round course over the hills .
that shares ul@@ rich kno@@ bel of the organiz@@ ing sports association ill@@ men@@ see .
among the participants , especially at the short distance over 15 kilometres and 300 metres above sea level , there were also numerous people who were interested in their ho@@ b@@ by once in competi@@ tions .
two junior drivers from the german top class were in this competition as well : fe@@ li@@ x ba@@ der from bad wal@@ d@@ see and pas@@ cal tre@@ u@@ bel from as@@ ch@@ -@@ lin@@ z came with the recommendation to good ran@@ k@@ ings with the german champi@@ ons .
these two could set themselves apart , as expected .
as in the previous year , fe@@ li@@ x bad@@ er was able to achieve a small advance in time to the finish and def@@ ended his title as overall winner of the short distance .
in second place , pas@@ cal tre@@ u@@ bel was able to place himself again .
the ladies were there@@ sa du@@ ell@@ i from the team al@@ b@@ tr@@ au@@ m , who had placed it at the top of the race .
in second and third , anne ade@@ l from ill@@ men@@ see and le@@ oni@@ e came together from o@@ win@@ gen .
a pleasant development is the increasing number of road drivers , who are in the community or who work .
not only in terms of performance , the whole range of sports enthusi@@ asts was represented .
the age structure also ran@@ ged from ten years for the youn@@ g@@ est to over 70 years for the oldest star@@ ters .
in the main race there were even more absolute top@@ a@@ ths at the start this year .
four drivers were able to distingu@@ ish themselves from the regional leaders .
phili@@ p@@ p pan@@ ger@@ l , a mountain bike half-@@ pro , was born in the black tus@@ k racing team in the netherlands .
pan@@ ger@@ l was a team member and was already world champi@@ on twice in the 12@@ -@@ hour driving .
this year he was elected european champi@@ on in this special discipline .
with ro@@ land b@@ aller@@ ste@@ dt , who has already won two german championship tit@@ les in the du@@ ath@@ l@@ on , he also won the title .
after 45 kilometres and 9@@ 00 metres of al@@ titude , a win@@ ding stor@@ m came in the finish line before the three-@@ hour race .
pan@@ ger@@ l was the first to go beyond the finish line .
only one second behind this was the rout@@ ine of b@@ aller@@ ste@@ dt ’ s second place in the overall rating .
at the same time , her@@ mann and war@@ th@@ mann joined the team as the third of the overall rating .
in the ladies &apos; ran@@ king , christian co@@ h@@ s@@ mann was the fas@@ test time in the main race .
the second place was the are@@ ane bl@@ er@@ sch from b@@ ing@@ e before nat@@ as@@ ch@@ a wer@@ ner from stutt@@ gart .
athle@@ tes and help@@ ers were very satisfied with the smooth running and well-@@ organised operation of the event .
on the way through mu@@ d , rivers and jun@@ g@@ les for free medical care .
dr. geor@@ ges b@@ wel@@ le provides free medical assistance in remote villages in camer@@ o@@ on , the netherlands , and in remote villages .
b@@ wel@@ le and his team spend almost every weekend trying to save hundreds of patients .
in the west african country there are not many doctors , only one for 5@@ ,000 people .
vote here or with your mobile device .
dr. geor@@ ges b@@ wel@@ le is one of the top 10 of the c@@ n@@ n her@@ oes of 2013 .
you can choose for him or any other her@@ o in the top 10 to see him as the “ c@@ n@@ n her@@ o of the year ” .
the winner will receive $ 2@@ 50@@ ,000 to continue his exceptional work .
for 21 years , geor@@ ges b@@ wel@@ le saw his si@@ ck father repeatedly thro@@ wn into consci@@ ousness and turned into hospit@@ als .
j@@ ame@@ f b@@ wel@@ le was born in 198@@ 1 in a car accident near y@@ a@@ oun@@ d@@ é , capital camer@@ o@@ on .
he was first only a broken arm , but then he was formed a dis@@ en@@ fran@@ ch@@ ised , which was based on his brain .
&quot; there was no neu@@ ro@@ sur@@ ge@@ on in camer@@ o@@ on , &quot; says geor@@ ges b@@ wel@@ le .
we could have removed it from camer@@ o@@ on if we had the money .
instead , b@@ wa@@ al spent years re@@ ass@@ uring his father in over@@ crow@@ ded clin@@ ics and hospit@@ als .
“ it is not easy , ” comments b@@ wel@@ le .
you can walk to the house at five o &apos;@@ clock in the morning and race to the hospital to be the first , and is not the first .
there are a great many patients .
some people even die because they have to wait .
the situation has hardly changed since b@@ well &apos;s father died in 2002 .
in camer@@ o@@ on , there is only one doctor for each 5@@ ,000 people , the world health organization says .
on the other hand , the relationship in the united states is with a doctor for 4@@ 13 people .
but even if there is a doctor for you , the majority of camer@@ o@@ ons could not afford to visit .
two out of five people in the country live below the poverty line and nearly three-@@ quarters of health spending in the country are private .
“ the only problem you have is the poverty , ” says bar@@ b@@ ary .
and poverty makes it impossible to save life .
his father and so many of his comp@@ at@@ ri@@ ots suffered in b@@ wel@@ le decided to do something about it .
dr. geor@@ ges b@@ wel@@ le and his volunte@@ er team have spent 700 free operations last year .
he became a doctor and worked as a v@@ as@@ cu@@ lar sur@@ ge@@ on in central hospital in y@@ a@@ oun@@ d@@ é .
he also founded a non-@@ profit organization called as@@ co@@ vi@@ me , which is open to rural residents at week@@ ends and is offering free medical care .
since 2008 , he and his voluntary group have contributed almost 3@@ 2@@ ,000 people .
almost every friday , he and up to 30 people were forced to take a mini@@ bus and drive with the medical equipment that was provided on the roof over un@@ ti@@ ed ter@@ rain into the villages where the help was needed .
not always everything runs smo@@ o@@ thly .
more than once , they had to drive the vehicles through rivers and mu@@ d .
but if you arrive , you will be gre@@ e@@ ted as her@@ oes : a fe@@ ast , sing@@ ing and dance and the best accommodation that the place has to offer .
in these villages , there is a real need for celebr@@ ation and b@@ ust free of charge , with its wide sm@@ ile and unlimited energy , to be part of the che@@ er@@ ful celebr@@ ation .
the next morning the team starts the investigation of hundreds of patients .
“ we treat 500 people per journey ” , says b@@ wel@@ le .
they come from a radi@@ us of 60 kilometres around the village – and on foot .
each of these weekend clin@@ ics offers medical care in a number of areas .
many people are being arrested for mal@@ aria , tu@@ ber@@ cu@@ lo@@ sis , mal@@ nutri@@ tion , di@@ abe@@ tes , par@@ a@@ sites and sex@@ ually transmitted diseases .
others get cr@@ ut@@ ches , don@@ ated gl@@ asses or free birth certific@@ ates – a document that is relevant to school , but is worth many poor families .
in the evening , the team conduc@@ ts simple operations with local an@@ aes@@ the@@ sia .
the operations usually take place in a school , the town hall or an apartment ; after the operation , the patients are on and go to the recre@@ ation area to take up space for the next one .
the lighting for the op and the dis@@ inf@@ ection equipment is provided by the gener@@ ator of the group and thus work b@@ wel@@ le and its volunte@@ ers to the early morning hours .
it is a stren@@ u@@ ous thing , but the vill@@ ag@@ ers usually help to make the team motiv@@ ate .
&quot; they dr@@ um@@ ble all night so we wake up and our work continues . &quot;
on sunday the team will then drive back to the city , ti@@ red but proud of the work done .
the group – a mix@@ ture of camer@@ o@@ on doctors and foreign medical students – has spent 700 free sur@@ ger@@ ies last year and knows that they are doing an enormous difference to people .
a man explained that the free operation of a break@@ down of a service he received was now able to provide him with work again .
“ that changes the future of my family , ” said the man .
besides the weekend clin@@ ics and his work as a sur@@ ge@@ on in the hospital , b@@ wel@@ le also works at night in private clin@@ ics in y@@ a@@ oun@@ d@@ é .
with this second job he finan@@ cially finance 60 % of his non-@@ profit activities , so b@@ wel@@ le ; the rest came from private don@@ ations .
“ i really do not know when he sle@@ eps , ” says k@@ ati@@ e o &apos;@@ mal@@ ley , who was in the dres@@ den school for the second year in phil@@ ade@@ l@@ phi@@ a medicine and has volunte@@ ered to be in b@@ wel@@ les .
it is always available in hospital or tried to pay money for the organization so that it can respond to these campaigns .
medical and health care products are available for students with a medical background such as o &apos;@@ mal@@ ley , who come from the usa and europe and support b@@ wel@@ le .
“ we can help with operations where we can help to save blood .
that would be a medical student in america in the second year .
students pay for their trip to camer@@ o@@ on themselves and often carry out rec@@ our@@ se to the san@@ itation equipment .
but once you have arrived in y@@ a@@ oun@@ d@@ é , b@@ wel@@ le will take over the accommodation , transport and instructions .
“ he is without doubt a her@@ o , ” says o &apos;@@ mal@@ ley .
he de@@ votes his life to this organisation and his desire to help the camer@@ o@@ on people knows no b@@ ounds .
for b@@ wel@@ le , the almost continuous work is not a burden .
to others to a happ@@ i@@ er life and thus to make a promise that he gave to his father , prepa@@ res him great joy .
“ i am so happy when i do this work ” , says the author of b@@ wel@@ le .
i am thinking of my father .
i hope he will see what i do .
i do it to help people to lau@@ gh again and to make the pain felt .

the role of s@@ anti@@ ago , the old man in hem@@ ing@@ ways no@@ v@@ elle &quot; the old man and the sea &quot; , is hor@@ st jan@@ son on the body of a human being .
jan@@ son was a her@@ self in the same ve@@ in as the ac@@ tress .
the old man s@@ anti@@ ago cannot be denied any protection in fishing .
the two are simply great comple@@ ments each other .
it is almost believed that the fol@@ ds in the nec@@ k of the old man , of whom the fisher@@ man man@@ olo spe@@ aks , can be seen .
if s@@ anti@@ ago is ti@@ red of life bu@@ b@@ bling on the chair , it is not so much at jan@@ son .
in addition , the role of the old fisher@@ man is fully a character that jan@@ son has done excell@@ ently .
hem@@ ing@@ way told the story of a figh@@ ter , a bra@@ ve man , who was not given up and who ultimately died through his knowledge and also his will .
jan@@ son is widely known as alone actor on the stage .
he man@@ ages to attract the audience &apos;s attention .
his efforts to finally get the fish to the surface of the water are so real that it is not difficult for spec@@ t@@ ators to forget that the sea is only lit from blue water bott@@ les .
director j@@ ens has@@ sel@@ mann makes the old man in the boat in front of the fishing village .
during the performance he sets the active scene into the light : the hu@@ t of s@@ anti@@ ago , the bar of the sing@@ er , mari@@ e-@@ lu@@ is@@ e g@@ un@@ st , the bar with her songs and her wonderful voice that makes life .
the four musicians play cuba &apos;s rhy@@ th@@ m to this end and are also guests of the bar .
tourism : des@@ cent to the roman@@ s
at about 120 metres in length is below cologne a se@@ wage channel from the roman period is preserved .
if you visit cologne , you will not pass the cathedral .
the town of k@@ ap@@ run is about 15@@ 7 metres above sea level and makes it the second highest church in europe .
but few visitors who visit the two f@@ ili@@ gre@@ es church to@@ wers are able to see the church &apos;s original appearance .
ra@@ iner schul@@ ze is an expert in the field of cologne underground .
meeting point for his guided tours is the service center of cologne tourism , right at the dom .
the tour starts in a very un@@ spectacular way : &quot; we start in the underground garage &quot; , says schul@@ ze .
in the 197@@ 0s , the city &apos;s fa@@ thers wanted to build a car@@ -@@ fair city , and that is why the remains of the old city wall remained only what was not too big .
most users of the park are therefore also rus@@ hing to the roman remains .
but those who look more closely will find that the d@@ 2 par@@ k@@ dec@@ k is covered by metal bars .
the exhibition is about five meters high , with ru@@ ins of hand@@ leg@@ -@@ sized stones .
&quot; there are remains of roman city wall that were built in the second half of the first century after christ .
before it returns to day@@ light , scho@@ ol@@ ing leaves participants on the upper parking level even a look at a fin@@ sty , un@@ touched , 15@@ -@@ metr@@ e deep sha@@ ft .
that is the foun@@ tain of the old cathedral , which unfortunately hardly is per@@ ceived .
the next stop of the tour is the pr@@ ä@@ tori@@ um , and here the participants des@@ cen@@ d down again into the dep@@ ths .
we are witn@@ essing the seat of the once most powerful man north of the alps , the pre@@ tor of the c@@ ca@@ a .
as for c@@ ca@@ a , it is important to know a visitor .
&quot; the ab@@ bre@@ vi@@ ation stands for &quot; col@@ onia cla@@ u@@ dia ara ag@@ ri@@ pp@@ in@@ en@@ si@@ um &quot; , which means in good english as &quot; city of roman law and city of ag@@ ri@@ pp@@ ine .
and at the pr@@ ä@@ tori@@ um , it is the former sta@@ at@@ holder palace , the center of power of the roman empire on the rh@@ ine .
from the entrance hall of the exhibition , access to the roman se@@ wage canal , which is located here at about 120 metres length .
&quot; you can relax a bit along the so-called clo@@ ac@@ a maxim@@ a .
one surprise has schul@@ ze yet .
after he was at the cash desk pic@@ ked the key , he leads the group to a 16 meter deep , wal@@ k@@ able sha@@ ft .
&quot; we are now in the mi@@ k@@ we , a rit@@ ual jewish bath &quot; , he explains .
the jewish community built its bathroom deep into the ground to take part in the gr@@ ound@@ water that was used for rit@@ ual washing .
to date , the lower end of the mi@@ k@@ we , whose origin@@ s date back to the eigh@@ th century , have been marked by var@@ ying levels of water in the rh@@ ine .
mi@@ k@@ we will be part of an archae@@ ological zone on the town hall square , for which the construction work will begin shortly .
until completion , however , a few years will be left .
the le@@ g is almost ch@@ op@@ ped : new edition of ro@@ ck@@ er process .
a bloo@@ dy attack in the ro@@ ck@@ er@@ mil@@ eu will be carried out after more than four years .
a trial for attemp@@ ted death , dangerous physical in@@ jury and damage to property against two 30@@ -@@ year-@@ ol@@ ds has taken place in the district court frankfurt ( oder ) .
it is accompanied by strict security measures .
the def@@ end@@ ants remained silent for the start .
they are to be active in the ro@@ ck@@ er scene and at the time they were among the band@@ di@@ dos .
the public prosecu@@ tor acc@@ uses them of having been arrested in june 2009 , together with unknown accompl@@ ices in fin@@ ow@@ furt , in a car .
all victims were seriously in@@ ju@@ red , a man almost lost his le@@ g .
victims are to be brought to the compe@@ ting fac@@ tion of hel@@ ls ang@@ els .
one is to be a high-@@ level member from berlin .
the previous approach was apparently a persecu@@ tion hun@@ t with several cars .
the indic@@ tment was about the re@@ vi@@ er@@ k@@ amp@@ f and a demonstration of power .
the two def@@ end@@ ants were in a first trial in early 2012 .
a court spo@@ kes@@ man said at the time that it was impossible to prove that the men were in the bloo@@ dy f@@ eu@@ d .
the perpe@@ tr@@ ators had mas@@ ks wor@@ n and were not recognized .
the federal court of justice lif@@ ted the judgment after the review of the public prosecu@@ tor &apos;s office and re@@ tri@@ ev@@ ed it to the court .
one of the def@@ end@@ ants is currently in prison for another off@@ ence in the open .
the first step was to focus on the reconstruction of the processes in the facts night .
as a witness , the then determined commissioner was charged .
the center focused on mobile phone calls from the def@@ end@@ ants and other people who had left the police .
it is difficult for ro@@ ck@@ ers to get to court almost always to get to a law that is not for them - and not to make statements .
this also applies to the victims .
in the first process , only one of the victims had been packed .
prosecu@@ tor ste@@ fan gol@@ fi@@ er of the public prosecu@@ tor &apos;s office frankfurt ( oder ) said on request that there were no new sp@@ he@@ res since the last trial .
the process requires 11 more negotiating days .
the dispos@@ able company does not think of the dispos@@ able company as a whole .
the night was long , the music l@@ oud and the mo@@ od good , but eventually it goes home .
but in the trees of people on the fron@@ t-@@ passenger and re@@ ar seat , the hun@@ ger is notic@@ eable .
of course , one or two cock@@ tails or se@@ kt may be responsible for this !
what could be more obvious than ch@@ illed to the next drive in ?
i admit that i am happy to be part of it when it is late at night or early in the morning .
a few pom@@ mes , a col@@ a , a bur@@ ger - and then ni@@ x like home and into bed !
but on the way home , the obvious differences between me and others are star@@ ving dis@@ co go@@ ers .
what is the point of a lack of constant regular maintenance of your fa@@ st@@ food products ?
especially on week@@ ends there are sc@@ ra@@ pped paper bags .
&quot; why ? &quot; i wonder .
are people to do@@ of to the bags with to home ?
it is not just that the paper industry is the landscape that is being squ@@ an@@ dered .
bags have also already used transport facilities such as guide plan@@ ks and thus caused accidents .
what is this saying about &quot; dispos@@ able society &quot; but not after , pre@@ sum@@ ably she does not even know what this word actually means .
if you are travelling more often in the evening , especially with several people in the car , you know how to get a back@@ ben@@ ch after celebrated nights : br@@ ac@@ kets , fl@@ yers and other things .
a few bags would be more or less n@@ au@@ gh@@ ty - in contrast to the street where nobody is on the food shel@@ f of other rum@@ ps .
i can see the day when the council and the municip@@ alities will be able to see the way through .
obama ’ s back@@ sli@@ ding in health policy
after intense criticism , president obama made a back@@ ward move yesterday in his frequent , clear and un@@ ambigu@@ ous promise : “ if your health insurance is convenient , you can keep it . ”
after hundreds of thousands of people have been given a letter of notice from their insu@@ rer , republic@@ ans have accused the president of having been in the public domain in recent days .
yesterday , obama rela@@ ti@@ sed his original promise .
“ the vast majority of citizens who want a functioning hospital insurance are not able to keep them , ” he said at a speech in bo@@ ston .
in response to the numerous media reports on redun@@ dan@@ cies , obama called on those americans who received such communications to sign up to the free market after a new insurance policy .
most citizens could thus obtain a better , more comprehensive health insurance for the same price or cheaper than forec@@ ast .
“ you come to a better offer , ” he said .
the government called it little surprising that the us government has been able to re@@ treat from the five percent of the population that have taken out insurance .
“ i want to tell these americans directly : they have earned better , ” said se@@ beli@@ us at a hearing in front of the energy and trade committee of the house of representatives in washington .
se@@ beli@@ us , who is responsible for the implementation of the affir@@ ma@@ tive care act , explained that the code &apos;s launch is not yet complete since october .
“ i am equally fru@@ stra@@ ted and an@@ gr@@ y as anyone else , ” she said .
i am determined to reg@@ ain their confidence .
this is a statement of an ex@@ ci@@ ted se@@ beli@@ us to a man behind her sitting advis@@ or at yesterday &apos;s hearing in the house of representatives , after a dispute with the republic@@ an member , mr bil@@ ly long , from mis@@ sour@@ i .
after more than three hours of consultation , long se@@ be@@ li@@ us repeatedly stressed the question of why the “ architec@@ t ” was not a member of the affir@@ ma@@ tive care act .
government in jerusal@@ em confir@@ ms attack on sy@@ ri@@ an air force base not only on the sy@@ ri@@ an air force base , but also on the sy@@ ri@@ an air force base , not on the israeli air force base .
an american government official who was anonymous , said that he was not here on thursday .
the aim is to &apos; missi@@ les and related equipment &apos; , of which the israeli government fe@@ ared that the israeli government would be responsible for the leban@@ ese he@@ z@@ bol@@ lah , he@@ z@@ bol@@ lah said it was &apos; .
sy@@ ri@@ an and leban@@ ese media , as well as the arab channel al-@@ arab@@ i@@ ya , had previously reported that the port city of lat@@ ak@@ ia in the night was closed from wednesday to thursday .
israeli television channel 2 is showing satellite images of the support base in the region of lat@@ ak@@ ia , on which russian def@@ en@@ ses were deplo@@ yed in the s-@@ 12@@ 5 ne@@ wa type and a battery of sa@@ -@@ 3 missi@@ les .
un@@ certain of the government in jerusal@@ em has not officially confirmed the attack .
however , the news agency re@@ u@@ ters quo@@ tes an equally anonymous israeli government official with the words that he believes that the israeli state is carrying out the attack , but is not sure .
a speaker from the israeli ministry of defence said , &apos; we are not comm@@ enting on these reports &apos; .
the journ@@ alist ron ben@@ -@@ y@@ ish@@ ai stressed that the european union &apos;s role in the world &apos;s economic crisis was to be strengthened by the sy@@ ri@@ an regime earlier , partly successfully .
the israeli government has repeatedly war@@ ned that it would be impossible to ignore syria ’ s attempts to isol@@ ate he@@ z@@ bol@@ lah from chemical or other dangerous weapons .
john ker@@ ry explains in an unprecedented interview that the us government is not a good example of how to avoid the sp@@ y .
john ker@@ ry suggested with an un@@ expected admission that the us would be weak@@ ening the def@@ ensive stance of the us on the future of its surveillance programs , by imposing a “ new ” sp@@ ying .
the foreign minister also ad@@ mitted that he was wrong with bar@@ ack obama to take responsibility for the fact that “ auto@@ pi@@ on@@ te ” was swit@@ ched on when the explo@@ sive nuclear escape was launched .
the le@@ ak@@ ed information makes the us government in a diplomatic process .
a video connection is required to use the open government website at the open government conference in london : “ without question , the president and i , as well as others in government , have learned of some of the things that are almost automatic .
he then became the first high-@@ ran@@ king member of the us government to admit that the us sp@@ y is a border that has been under@@ lined , but also stressed that no rights are being ab@@ used .
he said : ‘ in some cases this is in@@ appropriate too far ’ .
the president is determined to clarify matters and therefore introduc@@ es a thorough investigation , so that no one feels that the issue is being ab@@ used .
i assure you that the rights of inno@@ cent people in this process are not affected .
ker@@ ry , however , insi@@ sted that the n@@ sa be a force of good , and that its surveillance processes save many lives .
he added : “ we are dealing with a new world . ”
there is a radical extre@@ mis@@ m in the world that has been ob@@ s@@ essed with killing people .
so what if you are able to do what you want and to stop ?
we have actually seen aircraft cr@@ ash@@ es , attacks on buildings and the murder of people , because we were not able to prevent them in the run@@ -up to such plans .
meanwhile , us legisl@@ ators are going to europe to raise concerns about the alleg@@ ed american es@@ pi@@ on@@ age .
sen@@ ator chr@@ is mur@@ ph@@ y from connec@@ tic@@ ut said he had been working with representatives of the european parliament and other people this week and was concerned about their threats to get involved in the debate because of fru@@ stration at national security .
“ it is very important for the national security interests of the us that europeans should be more consistent with our joint efforts against terrorism .
i also go to europe to make it clear that we are in the fight against terrorism and that we must continue to cooperate , regardless of their an@@ ger over the n@@ sa programmes .
media reports that the n@@ sa has collected millions of telephone data in europe have shown the relationship with some us allies .
other rev@@ el@@ ations ci@@ ted from snow@@ den ’ s continued documents , according to which the n@@ sa had hi@@ red the mobile phone from chancell@@ or ang@@ ela mer@@ kel and up to 34 other heads of state around the world .
the head of the national intelligence services , james cla@@ pper , def@@ ended the es@@ pi@@ on@@ age among allies as necessary , and said that this was common on both sides .
in all the tur@@ mo@@ il , mur@@ ph@@ y said that his authority was preparing the congress ’ s journey , which will take place this year , and hoped that the delegation would be members of both parties and cham@@ bers .
the names of the other members who took part should be published in the coming days .
he said that the exact route will be extended .
while mur@@ ph@@ y stressed that the purpose of the trip was to improve relations , he also spoke of the need to avoid some “ serious words . ”
he said that european governments should be honest with their people about the kind of es@@ pi@@ on@@ age programmes they themselves have been using for years .
“ although we can use our surveillance programs to change the rights of europeans , we need to change the way we monitor our security .
meanwhile , john ker@@ ry is on the weekend for a trip to the middle east and poland to meet there with the gro@@ ll over the us administration ’ s strategy in syria , egypt , and iran , as well as the us surveillance activities .
a persi@@ stent violation of the jum@@ p joint is threat@@ ening to use force of nic@@ ola@@ i .
main@@ z is committed to a commitment by nic@@ ola@@ i m@@ ü@@ ller .
tomorrow , he will try to work with the team .
