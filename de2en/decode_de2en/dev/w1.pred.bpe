you are not 100 meters from each other : at the end of the day , a new version of the b 3@@ 3-@@ foot traffic light is on display in gu@@ t@@ ach .
two plants so close to each other : intention or tur@@ tle b@@ ür@@ ger@@ stro@@ m ?
this question has been raised by the may@@ or of the city of strasbourg yesterday .
&quot; the rapid rise of the city hall is a real highlight of the city , because it sec@@ ures the school path , &quot; explains ec@@ ker@@ t yesterday .
the gap between the two is now over , and the road is still a long one .
the agreement , officially launched yesterday , is a vital element in the process of the sul@@ z@@ b@@ ach@@ we@@ g / kir@@ ch@@ stra@@ ß@@ e cros@@ s@@ roads .
we have the museum , two churches , kur@@ park , the bus stop and the bus station , a doctor and a bank , as well as the traffic from the residential area › gru@@ b ‘ .
&quot; at the high traffic and traffic levels , the number of people who had to be allowed to cross another traffic light &quot; , ec@@ ker@@ t said .
this confir@@ ms peter ar@@ n@@ old of the council of the council of off@@ enburg .
&quot; according to current measure@@ ments , the number of passengers travelling on b 33 is approximately 12 000 daily .
therefore , the construction of another amp@@ ere is more than necessary : &quot; safety is simply about &quot; , so ar@@ n@@ old .
overall , four transport scre@@ ens were carried out , including a roun@@ d@@ about , but due to the close links in the cros@@ s@@ roads area sul@@ z@@ b@@ ach@@ we@@ g / kir@@ ch@@ stra@@ ß@@ e .
it was said , according to ar@@ no@@ ld , that the location of the amp@@ el@@ ma@@ sts was tested be@@ fore@@ hand : &quot; by means of an extra long wooden tri@@ bes we sie@@ ged transport vehicles we have developed .
the around 15 000 euros in the am@@ per@@ age plant itself is the &quot; most modern , which is currently in the market &quot; , explains the commission &apos;s ar@@ no@@ ld .
the complex is equipped with colour tv sets , a dvd player and a micro@@ phone .
and au@@ ster@@ ity is also possible : the older light installations use up about 100 wat@@ ts , which are currently only eight wat@@ ts .
pro fare is available for three light tan@@ ks .
ar@@ n@@ old explained the technique of the new plant : this is equipped with two rad@@ ar sen@@ sors .
press the foot@@ bridge to the traffic lights and the lights will test the upper part of the rad@@ ar .
is the road free , it comes straight green for the foot .
a further ra@@ id@@ -@@ sensor checks whether the data of the green phase is available for pede@@ stri@@ ans .
&quot; if a group or sal@@ es@@ man were to be over@@ taken by the road , the green period would be extended , so everyone would be safe to travel on the road , &quot; explained ar@@ no@@ ld .
of course , the car driver must be a partner here and the driver must observe the track .
this was the case yesterday .

the devices that are used to detec@@ t any dangerous km and to store information to the authorities are not core to a contro@@ vers@@ y .
the normally rather slow process of the development of roads has suddenly become a more intense debate with color@@ ful al@@ li@@ ances .
liber@@ t@@ arian women have been concerned with environmental groups and are in favour of the eu being able to support small boxes for the recording of the danger .
the te@@ a party is a hor@@ ri@@ ble one .
the american civil rights association ( ac@@ l@@ u ) is also a deeply committed concern and expressed concern about a number of data protection concerns .
but , while the us congress is not focusing on a course of action , several federal states are no longer waiting .
you are currently exam@@ ining how you can improve the situation in the next ten years with a system in which drivers are charged per mil@@ e@@ age travell@@ ed .
thousands of car drivers and their families have already lost their lives in the tac@@ ho@@ graph , some of which have g@@ ps monitoring .
the first thing that i would like to say is that this is a must for our country .
“ it is nothing to do with the fact that we will only use it , ” said has@@ an i@@ kh@@ r@@ ata , managing director of southern california .
the way in which the commission is going to pay these taxes will change .
the technology for this is there .
the initiative comes at a time when the council of europe &apos;s highway trust fund , which is financed by taxes , is being used to finance the us government &apos;s p@@ ile column .
but in america , not much is being killed any@@ more .
cars use less energy than cars .
the state min@@ eral oil tax of 18@@ .@@ 4 c@@ ents per gall@@ on is a tax on the price of oil , which is less than 4 c@@ ents per lit@@ re .
politicians d@@ are to take large price increases , which are also a source of carbon .
“ the ben@@ z@@ int@@ -@@ tax is simply not viable , ” says le@@ e mun@@ n@@ ich , a specialist in gas@@ ol@@ ine legislation at the university of min@@ n@@ es@@ ot@@ a .
his state is a country that has recently built 500 cars with passenger rec@@ orders , with which a mil@@ est@@ one programme of payment is to be tested .
“ the challenge is the long-term most sensible alternative . ” he said .
office cr@@ ats call it a mil@@ est@@ one in us@@ e-@@ based usage .
it is no surprise that the idea was not very popular among urban liber@@ als , because the tax could be reduced , for example , to reduce the driving behaviour in such a way that cong@@ es@@ tion and climate harmful emissions are reduced .
the cali@@ ph@@ ate plans to use the new system in the preparation of strategies , with which the ambitious targets of the law will be achieved .
but the republic@@ an has been bill shu@@ i-@@ off from pen@@ n@@ sy@@ l@@ v@@ ania , a chairman of the house transport committee , and has been forced to leave the country .
the commission &apos;s free marketing of products and services is also a source of inspiration for the free market .
“ the first time i have been to the united states , i have been to the united states , ” says adri@@ an mo@@ ore , vice president for the guidelines at read@@ on .
the people pay directly for the things they do get .
the movement is also supported by two earlier american transport ministers .
the us sen@@ ate appro@@ ves the agreement last year for a $ 90 million expensive pilot project to be launched to save 10@@ ,000 cars .
but the majority in the house of representatives prevented the process from being pus@@ hed forward and thus respon@@ ded to the concerns of members from rural areas who represent people who are in daily life often for many miles on the way to work or to the city .
several federal states and large cities are moving non-@@ smo@@ kers , but they are not moving at their own pace .
on the eng@@ aging side , o@@ reg@@ on , the current 5@@ ,000 ri@@ der for the biggest experim@@ ent in the country , is the most committed .
this driver will soon be the mil@@ est@@ one in the char@@ ging of miles instead of the oil tax to the state .
ne@@ v@@ ada has already developed a pilot project to help the people of ne@@ v@@ ada .
new york city is considering introducing a system of this kind .
il@@ lin@@ o@@ is te@@ sters it in restricted environments .
and the i-@@ 9@@ 5-@@ coalition government has been forced to withdraw its proposal to the council of ministers for transport from 17 states on the east coast ( including mar@@ y@@ land , pen@@ n@@ sy@@ l@@ v@@ ania , vir@@ g@@ ini@@ a and fl@@ ori@@ da ) .
the concept is not a universal heat , but a very simple one .
in ne@@ v@@ ada , where the most recent 50 volunte@@ ers have been equipped with the equipment , drivers have been s@@ cep@@ tical about the idea that the government could pursue each of its movements .
“ remember the big brother of the big brother and such things was a big problem , ” explains al@@ au@@ d@@ din kh@@ an , head of the strategy and result management .
the people wanted it not .
as the test started , the commission war@@ ned that the ac@@ l@@ u was not a problem on its website : “ it would be relatively easy to change the tac@@ ho@@ graph@@ s in extended surveillance devices .
it is also clear that there is no need to create a gi@@ gan@@ tic , pl@@ enti@@ ful technological infrastructure that inevitably leads to the creation of new data on the daily movements of individuals and companies .
ne@@ v@@ ada is one of a number of states that have now been forced to re@@ build after affordable technology , with the aim of making the state aware of the kilometres that are in danger , but not exactly when and where .
this , it seems , is not enough .
the hun@@ t for this technology has some authorities to a small degree .
the company is originally not listed , but has been listed on the german stock exchange for the taxation of motor drivers .
rather , it was their aim to create a new , more stable and more competitive market for car insurance .
but the measures it has tested are not the same for the road planning industry .
“ the people are more willing to take part in it , if their speed and location are not up to record , ” said ry@@ an mor@@ r@@ is@@ on , managing director of true mid@@ d@@ le-@@ income .
in some of these public pilot programmes , large errors have been made .
it is much cheaper than a car , and less in@@ tru@@ sive , to implement it .
in ore@@ gh@@ on , the students experim@@ ent with the idea of using motor@@ cy@@ cles to create a range of choices .
you can also register for a device with or without g@@ ps .
or you can choose no device at all and pay a flat fee instead based on the average of all entries .
other places hope that the concept of a di@@ str@@ ust of the public can be sold by using the devices with more functions .
in new york city , traffic officials want a device to tax , but with which the government also has to pay parking fees , to provide insurance for hazar@@ dous kilometres .
“ auto@@ ri@@ ders would be covered by the added value of the benefits that the system offers to them . ”
some traffic planning systems ask themselves , however , whether the whole talk about the pay per me@@ ile is not just a huge waste of time , but also a huge waste of time .
in the case of the metro@@ politan transport co@@ commission , the customer is responsible for the area of san francis@@ co bay .
a further entry fee is charged or an annual fee .
“ it is not a reason for an operation if a patient is not in a hospital . ”
if we do that , we will be making hundreds of millions of car drivers wor@@ ried about their privacy and many other things .

ab@@ str@@ action comm@@ and@@ ante han@@ s ka@@ mer@@ er had already met in his training as@@ sumption that the property of fe@@ der in the bur@@ g@@ ber@@ ger stra@@ ß@@ e was to be found .
there , the sa@@ wing process should be made into a short circuit .
by using the resulting bran@@ ding and the smo@@ ke development , two people were in@@ ju@@ red , one of them was still able to send an emergency call .
two bre@@ a@@ thing protection carri@@ ers of the we@@ hr made themselves to be very active after the first examination of the subject by h@@ ans kam@@ mer@@ er .
after a short time , the company managed to get the first person to find and enter the free .
the second person had to be wor@@ n .
this was not so easy , as the european union also had a narrow sta@@ ir@@ case .
the building , a workshop and a fully integrated stop shop , is located in the heart of the city , and is a perfect place to stay for two horses .
it was in a lot of wood and also stra@@ w bal@@ es .
further there was a lot of electrical machines for wo@@ od@@ working .
the first sol@@ dering attack was in the area of the tan@@ k in the vehicle .
a further direction was taken over a over@@ flow@@ ing and hyper@@ -@@ hy@@ dr@@ ate in about 100 meters distance .
now we have managed to find three sol@@ dering hand@@ les .
for use , the new building also had a high-@@ tech ho@@ se .
h@@ ans k@@ am@@ mer went to the german na@@ vy during the practice to show what was done with little available resources .
in the worst case , support is provided via the daily operations group kö@@ ni@@ gs@@ fel@@ d .
the command line of the ship was very clear with the operation .
the net@@ working of high-@@ tech universities and companies is important to us .
on its visit to the district of bre@@ is@@ gau@@ -@@ ho@@ ch@@ sch@@ war@@ z@@ wal@@ d , president gui@@ do wol@@ f also met in ti@@ ti@@ tis@@ ee neu@@ stadt to clarify where the labour force from tomorrow will come from .
in the support center of ho@@ ch@@ sch@@ war@@ z@@ wal@@ d he went to the university of applied sciences together with the managing school leaders of the vocational schools and the district gy@@ m@@ na@@ si@@ um and the parent of paren@@ tal leave on this important issue .
&quot; education is a key part of the location &quot; , under@@ lined c@@ lau@@ dia ste@@ le , director of the german han@@ s-@@ th@@ om@@ a school , which has developed the net@@ worked education center .
the first step was to make the company a successful partner in the field of training .
since 2011 , there is a new law school in the forests of the bav@@ arian state of bav@@ aria , a district gy@@ m@@ na@@ si@@ um and a vocational school centre .
in addition , he p@@ raised the family friend@@ liness of the county .
&quot; it is important that we not only respect the family phase , but also that we have a better understanding of the family phase , because of demographic change .
in addition , he led the committee on foreign affairs to the view that more and more people are looking for care and care for their loved ones .
&quot; without the support of employers , the eu ’ s resulting social security burden cannot be reduced .
but no one can afford to wait for qualified workers .
a further , particularly important factor is the strengthening of the network of universities and companies .
&quot; for who has already been in the field of the art of the region during his studies , will be satisfied with his knowledge and experience .
because only if there is sufficient training places available , we can guarantee that the skilled labour needs can be met .
in his opinion , the position of the company is a good one .
in addition , he experienced a great deal of difficulty on his train journey from ti@@ ti@@ ti@@ se@@ e-@@ neu@@ stadt to fre@@ i@@ burg .
&quot; stay in touch with the people of europe and ensure that the european union is not a barri@@ er to local transport &quot; , he explained to the members present .
with music a sub@@ tle and enter@@ taining afternoon , the world is experiencing a new life .
the company has been welcoming visitors for 15 years now to the di@@ et@@ inger sen@@ i@@ ors for coffee , ca@@ ke and then to a ves@@ per .
in the past , the elderly were the victims of the ra@@ st@@ al .
meanwhile , this afternoon in the nur@@ sing home of st. jo@@ se@@ f .
the secret residents were happy to see the leg@@ ends of the ca@@ kes and ca@@ kes .
later , there were sa@@ us@@ ages .

the more than 100 years old natural stone wall as the front of the building , which was before the renov@@ ation , has been transformed into a church street , is to be re@@ built with the city ’ s re@@ medi@@ al costs plan .
in the days before the kit@@ z@@ b@@ ü@@ hel , the first work of the restoration of the former school building was carried out a small cor@@ rid@@ or wall , to stab@@ ili@@ ze and sta@@ tic discharge of the more than one hundred years old natural stone wall with b@@ all@@ ast .
the other way forward is that the commission will be able to give mr alexander mis@@ ok the floor to the commission , the land@@ es@@ mem@@ orial office , in the planning .
after that , a calcul@@ ation of costs by experts is to be carried out , which then serves to make the council of municip@@ alities decide and determine what further action should be taken .
a decision on this will probably be taken in the coming year .
after the san@@ itation , care of the building and the plan@@ ting of the old school building , the building was re@@ built inside the two side wing of the school built in 19@@ 12 , it must be seen as a follow-up measure to the need for renov@@ ation .
the historic , unique and one hundred years old border wall of the old school is the oldest part of the town .
deep ri@@ des in individual stones and a strong , strong , clear and clear , the wall is not currently cr@@ ash@@ ing .
a location safe wall is a pre@@ requisite for a peace process that is used by pu@@ pil@@ s , which is not possible due to the current for@@ ti@@ fications .
originally , the school ho@@ f@@ san@@ ung was even already in the years 2008 / 2009 , but high un@@ planned costs and the resulting financial costs caused a shift .
a major word in the historical school tol@@ l analysis is the fact that the school walls have been used for film rec@@ ord@@ ings .
if guidelines from this page are not found , then the city of br@@ ä@@ un@@ ling@@ en hopes for subsidies from the think tan@@ ks .
the students of the br@@ ä@@ un@@ ling@@ er primary school , who have now returned to their home in a well restored old school building with new a@@ ula , can soon start to study the old school cour@@ ty@@ ard .
ö@@ z@@ dem@@ ir wants to become a jazz teacher in stutt@@ gart .
in the ongoing crisis discussions about the future of the music schools in bas@@ el , germany , the european union has now also taken a stand on ce@@ m ö@@ z@@ dem@@ ir , the german chancell@@ or of the greens .
&quot; i think it is wrong to call the ho@@ lis@@ tic training in music education .
j@@ az@@ z and classic - the most popular jazz festival in stutt@@ gart .
this is contrary to the principles of the european union , which is to be seen as a fav@@ ou@@ ri@@ tes in stutt@@ gart for a direct mandate at the federal elections on 22 september , the green red government .
this formula is designed to promote the development of the european union &apos;s energy policy , based on a study of experts .
after that , among other things , the programme is to be completed by the musi@@ k@@ ho@@ ch@@ sch@@ u@@ le stutt@@ gart and to be completed by the stutt@@ gart university of music .
us border : &quot; super@@ -@@ tun@@ nels &quot; to the drug s@@ mu@@ gg@@ ling discovered that the police are being s@@ mu@@ gg@@ led .
the hotel is located on the border between mexico and the united states , and has investig@@ ators working on a &quot; super@@ tunnel &quot; for drug s@@ mu@@ gg@@ ling .
as the us customs authorities have announced , the commission was not prepared to take over 500 metres of tu@@ bes between ti@@ ju@@ ana and san di@@ e@@ go with electricity , rail tracks and a crew of v@@ enti@@ lation .
three vulner@@ abilities have been discovered in the game : the one that was discovered in the game , the one that was discovered in the game , and the one that was discovered in the game .
the tunnel is a very good example of how the tunnel has not been used .
&quot; this car@@ te@@ ls are st@@ up@@ id when they think that they could be under the ra@@ d@@ ar .
the commission has been remin@@ ded of the drugs gan@@ gs that it is not possible to keep on using these tun@@ nels and try to use them .
both the us authorities and the eu ’ s mex@@ ic@@ an security forces are in a permanent struggle against the drug car@@ te@@ ls .
since 2006 , the number of people living in mexico has been more than 7@@ 7@@ ,000 .
from experts we design and manufacture the most suitable and reliable systems for the production of high quality products , designed by experts , for the production of high quality materials and for the production of high quality products .
because of the complex and technical equipment of the tunnel , the er@@ it@@ re@@ ans assume that the tunnel is operated by architec@@ ts and engineers .
the track installation is very simple and easy to operate .
on mex@@ ic@@ an side , the access to a building , which has been built 80 metres from the border .
according to the authorities , a lad@@ der takes up 20 meters to the depth to the tunnel entrance itself .
the tunnel is a very long way from the road , and it has a cross-@@ section of 1.@@ 20 meters and a width of 90 cen@@ time@@ ters .
he would have been able to make a significant contribution to the illegal immigration of the united states .
two of the susp@@ ects were arrested in connection with the co@@ ca@@ ine fund .
the third , a mex@@ ic@@ an , was sent@@ enced to death for conf@@ is@@ c@@ ating mari@@ ju@@ ana .
all three of them are threatened with the highest sentence of life@@ -@@ long de@@ tention , as officials have said .
since 2006 , eight such tun@@ nels have been discovered , but it was reported on the press conference in san di@@ e@@ go .
it should be noted , however , that in a case such as this , coal is used for mining .
normally , coal is used in small quantities , and not by tun@@ nels .
this showed me the &quot; hidden &quot; des@@ pair of drug gan@@ gs , whose traditional ro@@ pes have now been cut off , bill gates said .
you would do everything to make the european union a success .
the hotel is located in the heart of the city , near the main shopping street of the city .
you must be held liable for all the sent@@ ences up to ten years .
20@@ 14 will be a spiritual for@@ tress , a festival of the year 20@@ 14 .

the new ch@@ ron@@ i@@ k is to be released on november 21 and 22 in the new fe@@ st@@ hal@@ le in ge@@ is@@ ingen .
20@@ 14 is not the case either .
the nar@@ r@@ ation ton@@ gue stro@@ h@@ gl@@ on@@ ki starts on february 8 with a bre@@ w@@ ery evening at the 6@@ 0-@@ year-@@ old age , which harmon@@ ises well mat@@ h .

the city of ge@@ is@@ ingen was founded in a char@@ itable foundation , which was owned by the monaster@@ y of st. g@@ allen .
the ur@@ l was written in churches ( houses ) and was used for the court of the time .
both communities are therefore very close to each other in the same document .
the reason for this 12@@ 5@@ 0-@@ year old to be celebrated , in addition , is the community ’ s form of 40 years ago .
the council is taking the line equipment to the fore .
should the rail pass &quot; am h@@ ir@@ sch@@ en &quot; be expensive ?

the german railway is seeking to expand its cinem@@ atic activities in the coming year .
i would particularly like to emphasise the importance of safety at rail cros@@ s@@ ings - regularly , there are col@@ li@@ sions between trains with other vehicles across the country .
do the communities agree with the reconstruction measures that have been taken , they must agree to the cost of one third , share the rest of the railway and the federal government .
sch@@ ill@@ t@@ ach stad@@ t@@ bau@@ me@@ ister ro@@ land gri@@ e@@ ß@@ hab@@ er explained to the municip@@ al council the specific features of the ba@@ h@@ rain &quot; am h@@ ir@@ sch@@ en &quot; .
there , the commission plans to invest in the area of the tun@@ nels of the tunnel there west of the railway line .
there , the larger vehicles , for example , those that have lan@@ g@@ hol@@ z , could also be in the area of transit without bloc@@ king the tracks .
gri@@ e@@ bl@@ ers proposed that the commission should draw up a necessary support wall in such a way that the city could be the next street in due course .
this was confirmed in the municip@@ al council controversial .
civil serv@@ ants thomas ha@@ as opposed : the railway transition &quot; h@@ ir@@ sch@@ en &quot; is regularly used for long-@@ tim@@ ber transport .
even wood from the field of &quot; co@@ w bach &quot; is partly covered by this route , because the remaining wood is up to 20 meters long .
in addition , the commission &apos;s proposal for a change of direction for those vehicles which are not in use in the tunnel , when the main road is bloc@@ ked , argu@@ ed ha@@ as .
as it is clear that the situation in ky@@ r@@ gy@@ z@@ stan and the castle mountain tun@@ nels will be re@@ built and restored , as is currently the case in wol@@ f@@ en@@ . this could give the rail crossing &quot; at the &quot; h@@ ir@@ sch@@ en &quot; a longer time for a longer period .
the whe@@ els came to an agreement to investigate whether the costs of the proposed directive would be met by the road .
despite this , the fact that the railway crossing was re@@ built by a majority was approved , with the pro@@ vis@@ o that the necessary support wall was built in such a way that the city could be the next road towards the &quot; ba@@ hn@@ ho@@ f@@ stra@@ ß@@ e &quot; road for 5.@@ 5 for a .
the fact that the railway crossing was re@@ constructed at ger@@ ber@@ e@@ i tr@@ aut@@ we@@ in could , on the other hand , create a completely different problem that could hin@@ der access to the rapidly rising &quot; ger@@ ol@@ tz@@ h@@ ä@@ user we@@ g &quot; .
the administration had the re@@ building plans of the railway from the engineering office in bre@@ in@@ ling@@ er to investigate , because they had doubts as to whether the planned connection of the ger@@ ol@@ tz building would be possible .
the investigation came to the conclusion that the commission had not excluded the possibility of the ne@@ x@@ us of road running into the hands of the longer vehicles .
the responsibility for this is , in turn , the city as a road lo@@ ad@@ er .
the fact that the renov@@ ation could be carried out under liability is a consequence of this .
as both the tim@@ ber ex@@ ha@@ ust and the ben@@ ding of the current construction state work , the construction should be left to the original building .
the commission also has to be aware of the risk of the conflict of interest with a player on the transition .
even trains from the main railway station would have to be de@@ ported to this point .
multi@@ lingu@@ alism was given a prominent place in the construction of this rail transition , as the city was shi@@ el@@ ded from the problem of rising vehicles &apos; .
as an un@@ proble@@ matic , the body considers the re@@ building of the railway cros@@ s@@ ings &quot; before he@@ ur@@ bach &quot; and &quot; before ku@@ h@@ bach &quot; , for which cross-@@ agreements have already been concluded with the railway .

the start will be on the spot 20@@ 28 and 20@@ 34 .
in early september , the european union met in paris to discuss the future of space research .
30 ideas were on the table , five of them are now in the closer picture .
many bodies have called for an assessment of the proposals to be made of the ha@@ ken in the research community .
in the next few days , a final decision will be taken by the scientific programme committee .
overall , four major issues have been raised by the es@@ a , on which the missions of the 2007 programme &quot; co@@ sm@@ ic vision &quot; will be answered .
what are the conditions for the emerg@@ ence of plan@@ ets and life ?
the exact dates of the events in the creation of star wars and the universe are known as the stars of the universe .
a big in@@ fo@@ -@@ point tel@@ es@@ cope with the all could be this dark .
and if a star plan@@ ets has a star under which circumstances can life be created ?
to meet this question , the commission is expected to set up the space tel@@ es@@ cope &quot; che@@ ops &quot; in 20@@ 17 , with 500 already known plan@@ etary systems in our vicinity .
the possibilities are not limited , however , che@@ ops is a small mission with a budget of 150 million euros .
with larger instruments , we could reduce a@@ stronom@@ ers to earth like plan@@ ets and even increase the composition of their atmo@@ sp@@ he@@ res , thus looking for &quot; bi@@ om@@ ar@@ kers &quot; : g@@ ases that are considered to be biological activity .
as a result , how does the solar system work ?
the commission has also been asked to provide an insight into the conditions for the creation of new life .
a major role in the magnetic field of the brain is its magnetic activity and the interaction of its magnetic field and its magnetic field .
in our sun@@ -@@ system , these advantages can be ex@@ em@@ pl@@ ary .
with the &quot; sol@@ ar or@@ b@@ iting &quot; , the es@@ a has already launched a mission of the m-@@ class ( the budget is approximately one half a billion ) .
the sony er@@ ic@@ s@@ son w@@ 7@@ 10 is a new generation of digital cameras that will be available in the near future .
from a very great deal of interest to researchers are also j@@ up@@ i@@ ter and his mo@@ ons .
you want to find out which role the giant lea@@ f has in the development of the solar system ?
for this purpose , the es@@ a provides the first of the overall three l-@@ missions of the co@@ sm@@ ic vision programme .
the sony er@@ ic@@ s@@ son &quot; ju@@ ice &quot; ( j@@ up@@ i@@ ter ic@@ y mo@@ ons expl@@ or@@ er ) begins its journey by 20@@ 22 .
eight years later , she reach@@ es j@@ up@@ i@@ ter and is supposed to have created the atmosphere of the planet and the ic@@ y mon@@ ds of europe , kal@@ lis@@ to and gan@@ y@@ me@@ d .
what are the basic physical characteristics of the computer in the universe ?
the world of the world offers many possibilities to find material under extreme conditions .
perhaps you will find some different ways of interpre@@ ting the physi@@ ci@@ sts .
as has been said , how has the universe come into being and what is it consist of ?
before 13@@ .@@ 7 billion years , our co@@ smo@@ s was created by the big ban@@ g .
in addition to the information we have , we also have a great deal of information about the stars , plan@@ ets and living beings as we are , there are dark matter , the gra@@ vity of which is gal@@ ax@@ ies and gal@@ ax@@ ies .
so far , researchers have not known which physi@@ cs or the laws of the first second bre@@ ast , nor do they know what they are valid for the second .
with &quot; eu@@ cli@@ d &quot; , the es@@ a has also already developed a m-@@ mission .
with a special tel@@ es@@ cope , the camera is to be able to determine the distribution of the matter in the universe for the first time in the sky and thus to draw conclusions on the properties of dark matter and dark matter .
who wants to run the race could be a member of the team of the team .
from the 30 proposals , on the end of the selection procedure , only two remain .
the best chan@@ ces of winning a grant as a l mission after the eyes of many experts are &quot; e-@@ lis@@ a &quot; , a sophisticated concept for veri@@ fying gra@@ vit@@ ational waves .
this includes physical persons who are able to change the structure of the space time , which al@@ bert e@@ inste@@ in predic@@ ted nearly 100 years ago .
below is a list of the most important and most important events in the history of the town .
eli@@ is@@ a could do that , hope the scientists behind the project .
the mission provides for a two-@@ year plan of prob@@ es .
he could be a member of the european union , unlike installations on earth , and he could also show waves of gra@@ vit@@ ational waves that have ar@@ is@@ en during the ur@@ inary tr@@ act .
four other proposals compete with each other to make the second l mission : a large x-@@ ray device , a large x-@@ ray tube called &quot; ath@@ ena &quot; , which is used , among other things , to explore black ho@@ les , &quot; ic@@ y plan@@ ets &quot; .

snow@@ boarding is ready to work with germany in relation to us surveillance .
ed@@ ward snow has been a member of the wh@@ ist@@ le@@ b@@ lower of the us intelligence service , saying that he is prepared to go to berlin and , before the german bun@@ de@@ sta@@ g , to go to the national security agency .
the german member han@@ s-@@ chri@@ stop@@ h str@@ ö@@ be@@ le met snow@@ den in the european parliament on thursday , where he was granted asylum , in order to discuss the statement in germany .
in a letter to the president of the council , mr snow@@ den , which was sent to the media in berlin on friday , this letter states : ‘ even if the result of my efforts is demonstr@@ ably positive , my government treat@@ s a different opinion .
the truth about saying is not a crime .
in the letter to the president of the council , he wri@@ tes that he is convinced that the support of the international community will convince the american government to stop the charge against him .
the amendments tabled by the us ministry of justice are a step in the right direction , with sp@@ ying and the@@ ft of state property .
the german minister of the interior , han@@ s-@@ peter fried@@ rich , said online about time : “ if mr snow@@ den is prepared to talk to german representatives , then we will find ways to make that possible . ”
the relationship between the us and germany is characterised by the claims that the us is not a party to the mobile phone .
thomas op@@ per@@ mann , the member who spoke to the committee responsible for the secret service , has said that it is necessary to se@@ ize the opportunity to bring snow@@ den to light as a witness if this is possible , ‘ without him ’ .
flow sen@@ sors , a member of the greens , published a picture of themselves and snow@@ den .
he was arrested at his visit to russia by two german journalists .
flow sen@@ sors explained that the current system of law allows the use of the n@@ sa staff to be a problem for the russian government .
if snow@@ den is to be pro@@ testing in germany , he needs a guarantee that he will be “ safe ” there , so the honourable member will .
snow@@ boarding is now st@@ aging a new chapter in the history of the “ serious and advanced ” world of persecu@@ tion .
he was not touched by the fact that the world response to “ my act of political expression ” was a worldwide one .
citizens on the whole world , as well as high-@@ level politicians – including in the united states – have been watching the rev@@ el@@ ations about an un@@ controlled system of comprehensive surveillance as a mer@@ it of the general public .
in his letter to the council , snow@@ den makes clear to the german authorities that there is a cooperation offer “ if the difficulties surrounding the humanitarian situation have been resolved ” .
fron@@ ti@@ er airlines collec@@ ts fees for mobile bag@@ gage and other items of bag@@ gage that are not included in the ticket price .
fron@@ ti@@ er airlines plans to expand its operations to include up to 100 us dollars from passengers who are on their flight .
fron@@ ti@@ er airlines intends to deplo@@ y up to $ 100 for a piece of hand bag@@ gage and $ 2 for coffee or li@@ mon@@ ade .
the new fee is valid for hand bag@@ gage in the luggage com@@ part@@ ment above the seat , small bags under the seat are still free of charge .
fron@@ ti@@ er explained that it is calculated that usd 25 if the fee is paid in advance , and $ 100 per person in the case of travellers who arrive at the airport .
fron@@ t-@@ end speakers are k@@ ate o &apos;@@ m@@ alle@@ y , saying that the fee of 100 us dollars is aimed at making travellers pay more for themselves in advance of the payment .
“ we want to make this amount not to be calculated ” , explained she .
airport transfer service is available from the airport to the airport .
passengers who have not been tried to use them should be able to travel as much as possible .
fees are a way to collect passengers to pay for their bag@@ gage less than they would otherwise .
o &apos;@@ m@@ alle@@ y said that in the new fee i am not really concerned with spending money .
it is about the sta@@ ir@@ cases of the most loy@@ al customers of fron@@ ti@@ er , who clearly expressed that it was becoming increasingly difficult to find a place in the com@@ part@@ ment above the seat .
passengers who have not yet purchased their tickets on the airline ’ s website must not pay .
the same applies to the passenger who is flying on the flight part of the fron@@ t@@ loading .
o &apos;@@ m@@ alle@@ y explained that the site of fron@@ ti@@ er and the check-in page are not changed , so the passengers are informed of the fee .
the new hand@@ bag@@ gage fee of fron@@ ti@@ er will only enter into force in the summer , a precise date is not yet available .
passengers who travel with a flight of luggage often have to pay extra for it and other charges , but airlines are happy to take back that .
you argu@@ ed that the european union &apos;s transport of luggage is co@@ sting money and passengers this service .
many of the people who work on wall street see the new bag@@ gage charges as a sign that the airlines have enough money to travel to the united states after years of losses .
the majority of them , however , have so far been left to the fing@@ ers of charges for hand luggage .
spirit is a leading airline in the field of civil aviation three years ago .
the only other airline that has a such policy fee is the hungarian air force .
he estimates that in a report of december 2011 , the number of hand@@ bag@@ gage allow@@ ances per year was usd 50 million .
sorry , this page is only available in german .
“ the board administr@@ ator is a part of the re@@ i@@ f@@ enh@@ ä@@ user group , which i have been working on in the aviation industry ” , said he .
i expect the commission to take care of the t@@ ough@@ est and most ar@@ dent discussions at the stage of the flight .
“ the aircraft was full ” , explained the pilot , “ and the board ran smo@@ o@@ thly .
fron@@ ti@@ er follows spirit also in the 2 dollars , which is used for coffee , tea , li@@ mon@@ ade or ju@@ ice .
the company explained that the passenger is entitled to a free upgrade to the li@@ mon@@ ade or ju@@ ice .
water is still free .
us air@@ ways will have a short stake in the airbus a3@@ 20 family in 2008 to make money for refres@@ h@@ ments , but it has made a withdrawal seven months later , after passengers compla@@ ined and did not have another large company .
fron@@ t-@@ end step , fees for the manual bag@@ gage , is a step that will be taken if passengers are not buying directly from the airline .
airport transfer is available from the airport to the hotel .
the company provides all companies with an incentive to train passengers to buy direct from them .
fron@@ ti@@ er is a leading player in this field , however .
in september , the company started to develop a new hotel website for the booking of flights via an online travel agency only half of the number of frequent fl@@ yer miles .
on wednesday , the first two mil@@ e@@ age was re@@ charged to 25 % of the flight route .
a latero@@ om@@ s.com rate of one third party is not included in the price .
passengers who are not yet registered can also use the website of fron@@ ti@@ er seats only when they buy directly .
fron@@ ti@@ er has a sta@@ ff@@ ing customer base and is able to provide a wide range of services to its customers .
the er@@ l@@ ö@@ s went by 9 % and the airline ’ s capacity dec@@ lined just under 13 % in the first quarter , as in the financial report .
republic@@ an has tried to make a commitment to the eu as part of the sale of the company .

learn to work without work : pilot project for un@@ skilled workers in tourism .
the hotel is located on the mec@@ k@@ len@@ bur@@ g@@ is@@ che se@@ en@@ plat@@ te , a pilot project for the tourism industry .
under the leadership of the german federal employment agency , 49 women and men who have already been recognised as un@@ skilled in the industry are to work for three winter .
&quot; new to it is that the se@@ g@@ ment@@ ation of the six months courses with degrees ends &quot; , said car@@ men wi@@ ec@@ her@@ t of the employment agency neu@@ brand@@ enburg .
the benefits are mani@@ fold : the participants would thus not be unemployed , the firms would be re@@ trained , and the people would be more and more involved in hotels and restaurants .
the day of the project is also the industrial and commercial chamber of commerce in neu@@ brand@@ enburg and the german hotel and restaurant association in the city of neu@@ brand@@ enburg .
n@@ sa decla@@ res that a “ internal error ” and not h@@ ack@@ ers are to blame for the cr@@ ash of the website .
the shadow banking system in the united states has declared that it will not be possible to make a mistake in its public website for a few hours and that it will not be h@@ ack@@ ers , as it was claimed online .
“ n@@ sa@@ .@@ go@@ v was a great fan of the world this night , as during a planned update a new internal error was discovered . ” he explained .
the problem will be fixed this evening .
the claim that the euro is a failure is not justified by a distributed den@@ ial of service attack .
in the early even@@ ings , the online server service was very popular .
previously , a spo@@ kes@@ man from the n@@ sa had spoken to ab@@ c news , calling for the authority ’ s sensitive internal network to be “ in no way ” com@@ promised .
secret bal@@ lot papers are not at risk , as the spo@@ kes@@ man said .
at least one group of h@@ ack@@ -@@ vir@@ uses took part in the event , the n@@ sa website was associated with a d@@ dos attack .
in such cases , the police will be able to use the target site with page calls until the servers are over@@ loaded .
the cy@@ ber@@ bag is a very small and simple one , and the attacks are not intended to inter@@ f@@ ere with the internal network of the target system .
the former super@@ -@@ secret n@@ sa , whose n@@ ick@@ name was once no search agent , was used to be a &quot; secret &quot; .
the growing contro@@ vers@@ y surrounding the sec@@ rec@@ y also fu@@ el@@ ed initial spec@@ ulation that the state of the incident is the result of a targeted and cy@@ per@@ -@@ operation .

the can@@ a@@ dian aircraft manufacturer , the can@@ a@@ dian company bom@@ bar@@ di@@ er inc , reported a new 15@@ -@@ percent increase in the volume of the net profit on thursday after having been reduced by dec@@ lining orders and deli@@ veries to aircraft in the third quarter .
bom@@ bing is not only the most important aspect of the new constitution , but also the most important aspect of the new c@@ series aircraft .
on the jun@@ g@@ fer@@ n@@ flu@@ g of the test aircraft a month and a half ago , only three further laun@@ ches were carried out , which would seem question@@ able whether the test phase was as planned .
the results were not as good as the forec@@ asts and led to a change of course .
ca@@ ther@@ on dom@@ es@@ tic@@ ated , analy@@ st at national bank finance , said : “ the financial crisis has been on the decline .
“ while the weak@@ er countries were not sufficiently represented in the aircraft , the number of aircraft was expected to decline .
we are the opinion that the bom@@ bing of the new orders for the c@@ ser@@ ies should be re@@ tained if the test program for the aircraft is to progress .
if , however , there is no new orders to be made in the coming months , we expect the market to be more open to the program .
bom@@ bing is not the way to go .
the first test aircraft was delivered in march to the public and was flying to the us after months of delays .
but , so far , binding orders for the c@@ series have been delivered with 17@@ 7 , as potential bu@@ yers have been waiting for the results of the flight tests and want to see if the company &apos;s claims about fuel efficiency and cost-@@ saving potential of the new jet are true .
at present , there are 4@@ 03 orders and commitments from 15 customers and companies .
the management board chairman pi@@ er@@ re beau@@ do@@ in is confident that he will not be able to use bom@@ bar@@ di@@ er to achieve his goal of 300 binding orders at the beginning of commercial use of the jet .
the group ’ s management issued a statement on thursday to analy@@ sts and the media that the program was in the schedule .
“ the test aircraft is not a part of the ground any longer than expected , ” said beau@@ do@@ in at a conference call and added , while the stand@@ still of the aircraft was ground tests .
each manufacturer plans to change .
we have decided to propose a first flight , and then to take a revision period .
the same is true throughout the flight programme .
the second issue of five test aircraft will probably be included in the next few weeks , the remaining two being short of what it was originally intended to be .
nevertheless , analyses remain ske@@ p@@ tical , whether twelve months after the jun@@ g@@ le flight the first customer will be a c@@ series aircraft in service .
bom@@ bing is not the way to check the situation .
“ the long-@@ running advance of the european union ’ s air traffic test – even if it is obviously bom@@ bar@@ di@@ ers of internal planning – confir@@ ms our view that the commission@@ ing of the first quarter of 20@@ 15 is moving ” , said do@@ w .
in the third quarter with the end of september 30 , bom@@ bar@@ di@@ ers net profit fell to € 14@@ 7 million or 8 c@@ ents per share .
the price of the adjusted prize per share is un@@ changed 9 c@@ ents .
the sales were down slightly , but the group continued to decline from 4.@@ 2 to 4.@@ 2 million euros .
analy@@ sts had a profit of 10 c@@ ents per share , and a tur@@ nover of 4.@@ 5@@ 6 billion dollars was expected , so th@@ om@@ son re@@ u@@ ters i / b / e / s .
the world &apos;s fourth largest aircraft manufacturer , the world &apos;s largest , has said that it has taken 45 aircraft in this quarter , a decline of 57 last year .
the net@@ -@@ orders fell by 2.@@ 8 % to chf 8@@ 3 million .
the order book in the aero@@ space and defence industries was down from € 3@@ 9.@@ 4 billion on 30 september and was thus up from € 3@@ 1.@@ 7 billion .
“ in the field of air and space travel , the results were in line with our objectives , but the low order in@@ take and the overall market situation were dis@@ appoin@@ ting , ” said be@@ e@@ do@@ in .
the sales in the aero@@ space and defence industries increased by € 3@@ 9.@@ 4 billion to € 2@@ 1.@@ 9 billion .
bom@@ bing is not a way to get rid of the world &apos;s largest railway manufacturer , and has announced that sales in this segment have ris@@ en by just under 11 % to $ 2.@@ 1 billion .
the order book in the transport division increased by € 3@@ 9.@@ 2 billion on 30 september and was thus significantly lower than the 3@@ 1st december .
the winning vol@@ umes in the transport sector were increased by processing problems .
according to the company ’ s management , it will be new targets for the fourth quarter .
in re@@ hear@@ s@@ al trading on thursday , the bom@@ bing campaign gave the company a share of 8.@@ 5 percent and stood at 4.@@ 8@@ 3 can@@ a@@ dian dollars , after also announced that it would not be able to sell the go@@ o@@ dle board .

the an@@ wal@@ t had been afraid to leave his secret drug ad@@ diction to light .
he was elected by the li@@ ver@@ pool cro@@ wn court , and was elected three years later .
a well-known name for the criminal , who has a drug bar@@ on in front of a large police investigation , is because he is afraid to use his secret drug ad@@ diction .
based on the study of the theory of the universe , bas@@ ha@@ r di@@ tt@@ a , 42 , provided the sub@@ world size ne@@ il scar@@ bor@@ ough with sensitive information about its activities in the drug trade , after having been ad@@ mitted to com@@ edy .
the report by crimin@@ als as “ first-@@ class ” is a very good one .
officials of the commission wat@@ ched how sc@@ ar@@ bor@@ ou@@ gh ( 32 ) had be@@ aten three bags of co@@ ca@@ ine at the bar of the law@@ yer in black@@ bur@@ n , lan@@ cas@@ hire , de@@ tained while this was being discussed with colleagues at a meal .
the er@@ mit@@ t@@ lun@@ gen revealed that the di@@ tty images of drugs are regularly classi@@ fied as class a after the tests had left trac@@ es of co@@ ca@@ ine in its hair , on its wal@@ let .
the hotel has been a member of the european parliament for eight months between january and august 2011 , and has been un@@ authorised to provide information on the arrest of two men on behalf of scar@@ bor@@ ough and one of its partners .
all four vulner@@ abilities have been discovered at the time by the police in a major investigation procedure for the her@@ o@@ in and co@@ ca@@ ine trade in lan@@ cas@@ hire .
together with 32 other people , they were later arrested , having been arrested by the police on a number of home@@ -@@ sear@@ ches and k@@ oc@@ ay@@ an worth eur 1.@@ 5 million .
di@@ tt@@ a , 42 , gave information to the crimin@@ als , but because he fe@@ ared that he would not reduce his drug ad@@ diction .
today , di@@ tt@@ a , the most important law firm in the field of so@@ lo@@ ists in black@@ bur@@ n , was arrested on li@@ ver@@ pool street .
he gave a speech to the committee on foreign affairs on a previous survey .
the an@@ wal@@ t was over@@ thro@@ wn after the police had been arrested in their investigations against scar@@ bor@@ ough .
two er@@ as@@ m@@ us officers followed the court of justice &apos;s susp@@ ect and saw how he could lead to di@@ t@@ as house and the drugs were being treated with a pur@@ ity of 60 % in a black golf g@@ love .
in the late 23@@ 7@@ 0s , he was a member of the crew of the uss voy@@ ager .
the an@@ wal@@ t returned to the home , and took the trouble to get rid of the drugs and then received nine communications between the two .
before the court , it was known that di@@ tt@@ a had a “ regular consumer ” of ko@@ ka@@ in .
di@@ tt@@ a was later arrested and sent@@ enced to death .
during his arrest , the former prime minister , di@@ tt@@ a , took his wal@@ let and tried to bor@@ row a number of credit cards , but they were assured and a hair sample was taken from him .
the police and judicial networks are not only the subject of the police , but also the subject of the police .
before the court , it was known that he had been involved in the drug trade , some of whom he had previously represented , after significant ar@@ re@@ sts and informed them that he had taken the investig@@ ators of them .
prosecu@@ tors are lawyers , anne w@@ hy@@ te said : “ a criminal prosecu@@ tor is supposed to be better than any other person to know that the law cannot be broken . ”
di@@ tt@@ a is also accused of abuse of his position as a criminal .
the frag@@ ment@@ ation is not simply the relationship of a drug deal@@ er , but of a drug deal@@ er who has to pay his law@@ yer for drugs .
a part of his communications was undoubtedly legitimate , but it was not the first to be the law@@ yer of these people .
but the same thing happened far beyond the borders of a normal relationship between law@@ yer and client .
he was also a member of the police investigation , and he was also a member of the police .
mr di@@ tt@@ a raised the issue of the profes@@ sion .
he was in charge of certain clients , and in particular scar@@ bor@@ ough , who was not allowed to be the only one to compromise his independence .
di@@ tt@@ a wi@@ es has pointed out that any mis@@ conduct was un@@ justified and said : “ if i were a corru@@ pt law@@ yer , what i am not , and if i had information to sc@@ bor@@ ough , i would not have 15 hours .
but , after hearing the commissioner , super@@ int@@ ent le@@ e hal@@ ste@@ ad said from the police in lan@@ cas@@ hire : “ mr di@@ tt@@ a has the step from a criminal defence to a criminal . ”
his coalition government has been responsible for a ho@@ pel@@ ess@@ ly com@@ promised and made him recipi@@ ent of the mo@@ tives of leading members of the organised crime , who have appointed him to provide valuable information on police investigations .
an@@ gl@@ ers must be given the highest standards of integrity .
di@@ tt@@ a has this trust .
the seri@@ ous and organized c@@ ad / c@@ am cri@@ me@@ -@@ unit is a high-@@ performance , high-@@ performance , high-@@ performance , low-@@ cost , low-@@ cost , low-@@ cost , low-@@ cost , low-@@ cost , low-@@ cost , low-@@ cost , low-@@ cost carrier .
this case should be brought to justice by crimin@@ als and shows that the perpe@@ tr@@ ators of terrorism are not being able to escape .
we find them and bring them to court .

on its website , the di@@ tt@@ a published a section with questions and answers about itself , in which he gave up his dream job .
revolu@@ tion@@ aries are the most revolutionary work of church music , and the most important of all is the work of the church music .
for the conclusion of the celebra@@ tions at the occasion of its 16@@ 0-@@ year existence , the li@@ e@@ der@@ cr@@ an@@ z dun@@ n@@ ingen will host two services of wor@@ ship with the &quot; german fair &quot; by fran@@ z sch@@ u@@ bert .
after the great success of the musi@@ c@@ als &quot; rock my life &quot; , which was awarded to the audience in the spring of this year , the band will be back in the studio .
on saturday , 2@@ 6-@@ october , the exhibition will be held in the city of hamburg from 19 pm during the evening fair .
the so-called &apos; german fair &apos; , which has the original title &apos; sing@@ ing for the celebr@@ ation of the holy sacrif@@ ice of the fair &apos; , d 8@@ 72 , is a spiritual music work of compos@@ er fran@@ z sch@@ u@@ bert from 19@@ 45 .
the fair will be held in the context of the services of god , as the client jo@@ han@@ n phili@@ p@@ p neu@@ mann intended .
under the direction of her@@ mann sch@@ nei@@ der , the cho@@ ir is led by the group of br@@ ass bands of the music association mer@@ ry ten@@ n@@ en@@ br@@ on@@ n and no@@ em@@ i lo@@ ko@@ di at the or@@ gan .
ha@@ st@@ ings : sky@@ sc@@ rap@@ ers are not a matter of confidence .
with the elections to the par@@ ish council of the municip@@ ality in 20@@ 15 , for example , the se@@ af@@ are@@ rs &apos; unit has@@ l@@ ach ( se ) will change fundament@@ ally .
it is also possible to use a common par@@ ish church in the town of s@@ anti@@ ago de compos@@ te@@ la for all six par@@ ish churches .
in a common meeting , the heads of state and government of the h@@ as@@ la@@ h , ho@@ f@@ ste@@ t@@ ten , m@@ ü@@ h@@ len@@ bach , fis@@ cher@@ bach , ste@@ in@@ ach and wel@@ sch@@ en@@ stein prepared for the changes .
because , in principle , the decisions of the di@@ oc@@ ese are not something to change and there is no time to change the par@@ ish church counc@@ ils .
in the course of the day , it became particularly clear that the s@@ cep@@ tic@@ ism about the new is di@@ m , but is likely to be a confident one .
from the ideas and expectations of the new developments 20@@ 15 to the present concrete proposals on the future composition and the size of the par@@ ish church council , the european union &apos;s extremely constructive discussions have been extremely fru@@ it@@ ful with the main tam@@ il authorities .
regional decentr@@ alised georgia is a member of the international federation of independent media ( ic@@ t ) .
after that , the se has@@ l@@ ach as a church community will in future form a body of public law that will be incorporated into the rights and duties of the six individual churches that have so far been active in the community .
it is only a small common ar@@ row that is still to be built and a foundation council .
for each p@@ ond , the two par@@ ish churches should be represented .
your task will be to ensure that the ky@@ r@@ gy@@ z life in the place is promoted in the future .
in the question of the finances of the individual par@@ ish community , the question of the financial situation was then very much in demand .
the new features include the possibility of using collected data to fund the new projects in the par@@ ish .
the binding nature of the debt is based on the general community .
it is precisely with regard to the major investments planned , the commitment of which will then be met by all par@@ ish par@@ ishes , that there was great concern .
&quot; even in the past , only in projects that were not yet implemented by the individual par@@ ish authorities were invested .
practical experience with a common body of experts for five par@@ ish counc@@ ils .
you had already decided to set up a &apos; one &apos; in 2006 , five will remain &apos; and have had to discover that this is not so simple .
the bodies of the h@@ as@@ la@@ cher se@@ af@@ are@@ rs were then remin@@ ded of the issues of the future composition and size of the joint par@@ ish council and the practical work of the municip@@ al teams .
the evaluation of the project will be conducted in a further session and will be presented in a further joint meeting of all six bodies next spring .
on the end , p@@ far@@ r@@ gem@@ ein@@ der@@ at michael sch@@ ö@@ ner presented the new logo of the se@@ af@@ are@@ rs &apos; unity , which was approved by a clear majority .
in p@@ f@@ ul@@ l@@ endor@@ f , the electricity is more expensive than the electricity produced in the village .

the main reason for the upcoming price increases is the fact that the price increase is expected to be in the first quarter of 2008 , from 5.@@ 27@@ 7 to 6.@@ 3 cent per kil@@ ow@@ att@@ -@@ hour .
this survey shows that the number of people who work in the internet is increasing by about 10 % every october .
this figure is a very important step in the process of energy change .
the city works have been transformed into a museum of the last link in the history of the town .
the supervisory board of the energy company was represented in its forec@@ asts even by a higher conversion .
now , the concrete figures need to be calculated to enable the city works to be re@@ formed next week by means of the exact price increase .
&quot; we go from a decent increase of 1 c@@ ents plus x , &quot; says the rapporteur , &quot; the increase is more in the near future than the 2 cent .
amp@@ hi@@ theatre on permanent red : on warm days , you pay attention to the constant red light .
sometimes , a amp@@ ere is simply not green .
the contact loo@@ p in the street re@@ acts not , or the light sign is de@@ fe@@ t@@ tered .
what should we do then - with ro@@ t , which is the only one in the world ?
has a affected user been in contact with a red amp@@ hi@@ theatre for long enough time and the inter@@ section is free , he can continue to drive , explains the stutt@@ gart bar att@@ or@@ ney r@@ al@@ f bec@@ ker in the magazine &quot; motor@@ ra@@ d &quot; .
the warm and cold water temperature should be &quot; appropriate &quot; , which is a cas@@ e-@@ by-@@ case interpretation .
be@@ ck@@ er advis@@ es to use at least five minutes to stop before a function dis@@ order of the traffic lights .
who wants to drive despite the red lights ?
who wants to spend less than five minutes waiting for the next one , may not wait long enough , bec@@ ker and points out a decision by the supreme court .
in the draft negotiated agreement , the commission had a driver who had been on permanent red for about three minutes and had to be able to commit to a care@@ less red red light off@@ ence .
the traffic lights were , in fact , not def@@ ec@@ tive , but rather sp@@ ran@@ g down to green a little later .
a bike ban would have remained un@@ changed because of the particular situation - the money penalty , but not .
the municip@@ al council is pleased with the sound budget and the good quality of its budget .
whenever a player is in community att@@ end@@ ance , he or she is always entitled to a seat .
the community of the town of s@@ anti@@ ago de compos@@ te@@ la is well filled with a lot of people and has known the administration since 2005 .
the european parliament &apos;s 20@@ 12@@ -@@ year 2012 can be seen as a complete success in this respect .
this was confirmed at the presentation of the annual accounts for 2012 .
as andre@@ a ro@@ th@@ mun@@ d explained , the debian project leader is a budget of around eur 7.@@ 6 million over a million .
the council also has a sur@@ plus of the administrative budget , which amounts to around eur 1.@@ 8 million , over the commission &apos;s approach .
the hotel is also a short walk from the main railway station and the main shopping street .
the council of europe ’ s wealth budget was also significantly above the planned value .
instead of the 1.@@ 5 million euros that was envis@@ aged , it was eur 2.5 million last year .
&quot; this is in essence due to the higher allocation from the administrative budget &quot; , says ro@@ th@@ mun@@ d .
as the committee on budgets has proposed less investment than was planned in 2012 , the commission is also concerned about the re@@ dep@@ loy@@ ment of funds .
overall , the general re@@ payment of around eur 2.@@ 1 million was reduced to eur 4.@@ 9 million , which is currently around eur 4.@@ 9 million .
civil serv@@ ants r@@ alp@@ h ger@@ ster than@@ ked the commission for the good work done by ro@@ th@@ mun@@ d and her team .
&quot; so a work protec@@ ts the people from the evil , but it is not a work of the past .
he and the non-@@ profit organizations of the city were obviously pleased with the good figures .
it may seem par@@ ado@@ x@@ ical that the same thing is true , but the very good figures could soon be co@@ stly for the citizens .
by using the good financial situation , the municip@@ ality has been able to rely on high lif@@ ting rates in the past .
this in turn , however , is a fact that , according to ger@@ ster , subsidies have been cut off from the country on a number of occasions .
for this assurance , the commission has proposed a number of measures to be taken to ensure that the funds are available from various types of compensation .
under the new rules , cities and municip@@ alities that receive subsidies must be able to make certain lif@@ ting rates , among other things .
&quot; the theme of lif@@ ting sets must be taken into account , as in the coming years investments are required , for which we would like to have received subsidies , &quot; announced ger@@ ster in this context .

civil serv@@ ants k@@ lu@@ mp@@ p re@@ mem@@ bered that rec@@ ur@@ ring wit@@ nesses of the weather were causing the spring of and autumn to fall short of the original la@@ wn so that it could not be re@@ tained .
the european union has already had the first thoughts on the solution of the problem 15 years ago , when a third place was built on the grounds of the football club or at the real@@ sch@@ u@@ le am sal@@ in@@ en@@ see .
both are now being re@@ tro@@ fitted .
before six years , thoughts were put forward to create a artificial tur@@ f sports centre , which was generally considered to be the ultimate solution .
concrete planning is planned before two years ago , when the f@@ c was able to open the ch@@ ab@@ el ’ s lounge in e@@ rec@@ tion , a cost sharing of eur 100 000 for the construction of the place and to support the country from eur 10@@ 4 000 .

it is threat@@ ening to ev@@ ade the consequences of road traffic that has already been caused by accidents .
the introduction of a tol@@ l for all cars would be a p@@ ron@@ ol@@ ds &apos; , moreover , only a first step .
&quot; it is possible that the european union will be able to use the compensation for the german sal@@ aries at a later date , &quot; he said .

the commission has also been working on the name of the holy hu@@ ber@@ tus in the par@@ ish church of st. mar@@ y on the hill .
st. hu@@ ber@@ tus is a town in the south of the country , with a population of about 3@@ 00@@ ,000 .
the hun@@ ting hor@@ n@@ b@@ all@@ group of the hun@@ ting tri@@ be of western f@@ all@@ s. led by bri@@ g@@ it@@ te k@@ lu@@ th , has been founded on par@@ forest hor@@ ns ( natural hor@@ ns in the mo@@ od ) by old french me@@ lo@@ dies .

the celebra@@ tions of the fair will take place on sunday , november 3 , at 11.@@ 30 a.m.
the newly designed and extended op@@ t@@ orial sh@@ ines with a new café .
one thing that is needed to stay and return is the opportunity to relax and re@@ charge .
one thing that makes the name of the program .
as a dé@@ j@@ à v@@ u , the term is &quot; a psycho@@ logical term &quot; , &quot; a phenomenon that is reflected in the sense that a new situation has been experienced or seen before .
in the case of the visit of the sam@@ e-@@ name café on the victim in the district town of kle@@ ve in sight to the university of rhe@@ in-@@ wa@@ al , it must not be at the pure dé@@ j@@ à v@@ u feeling .
finally , the café has a big terrace with its beautiful name .
because &apos; s just fun , and simply beautiful is .
a look into the interior at the op@@ sch@@ la@@ g 8 gives the vie@@ wer an idea of the real world .
the high-@@ tech , but not cool , café bar is the ideal place to relax and enjoy a drink .
here you can enjoy the best of the region ’ s culinary traditions , with the founder mir@@ j@@ am van der ste@@ t and dani@@ el b@@ ü@@ tt@@ ner at the top .
this is done by the delicious culinary cre@@ ations or by individually heated fres@@ h@@ ly ba@@ ked products .
the in@@ sid@@ ers , both 33 years old , have already decided to go to the court before the dir@@ ty caf@@ és opened .
from the move to kle@@ ve to the opera , the victims hope to be able to enjoy the friendly caf@@ e lovers more than ever .
not least , the fact that the university is a university is also a good thing .
&quot; where we have no particular target group &quot; , emphasi@@ zes dani@@ el b@@ ü@@ tt@@ ner .
rather , the two members here want to address young students just as much as senior citizens and all ages there .
a@@ pro@@ po@@ s caf@@ é@@ -@@ lovers will be delighted with this .
the symp@@ tom of this in@@ hab@@ ited family is the fact that the hotel is a perfect place for coffee .
enjoy the game of the s@@ wee@@ ten@@ ed hot ge@@ br@@ ä@@ u in a variety of different vari@@ ations .

in the last few years , dani@@ el b@@ ü@@ tt@@ ner has been the ex@@ pres@@ so fan and mir@@ j@@ am van der ste@@ lt the cap@@ pu@@ c@@ c@@ ino tr@@ in@@ ker .
&quot; to do this a bac@@ u@@ ette - that is my thing , &quot; be@@ tr@@ ays the n@@ r@@ z .
two events took place in the same year already in the bright café .
better to be honest .
because the port festival took place more outside the place - that &apos;s the café dé@@ j@@ à v@@ u .
but it was also the beef and ve@@ al evening .
&quot; it is nice , successful and fun@@ ny , &quot; the two 3@@ 3-@@ year-@@ old ones found .
but it is not everyone who is interested .
perhaps it is dani@@ el b@@ ü@@ tt@@ ner who is not a very good fan of ev@@ ent@@ -@@ ab@@ en@@ den because he is &quot; you can &apos;t do it all right &quot; .
and with a real event , i always speak only to those who are also interested in the special event .
that is why events are more likely to be the exception .
&quot; we want to make the normal operation as little as possible , &quot; he said .
should it mean that dé@@ j@@ à v@@ u is also a reliable partner for us .
in relation to the quality of products , which are offered here , as well as to the team and the beautiful surroundings at the op@@ p@@ sch@@ l@@ agen in kle@@ ve .
the road that runs through the city is becoming a gastronom@@ ic route .
a lot of kle@@ ver , the guests from near and far and the students , who have visited the gas@@ te@@ in region and thus also the café dé@@ j@@ à v@@ u , will be delighted to discover the region .

a day of than@@ k@@ s@@ giving at the m@@ g@@ v in din@@ ker !
it was the 16@@ 5th silent film festival of the foundation , which was held in the city of fried@@ rich wil@@ hel@@ m din@@ ker .
in the association &apos;s centre of the restaurant &quot; wi@@ t@@ te@@ bor@@ g &quot; in din@@ ker gen@@ os@@ sen all enjoyed the harmon@@ ious co@@ existence in the very sense of music .
tradi@@ tionally , the sti@@ f@@ tun@@ g festival is also the appropriate festival for festi@@ vity in order to give hon@@ ors .
the commission has already made a significant contribution to the development of the european union in the field of sport and the promotion of sport .
&quot; you have not only had a lot for us written down , but you have also given some la@@ ps for us , our hear@@ t@@ felt thanks for that , &quot; the chairman of the ch@@ or@@ us er@@ ich sch@@ lo@@ t@@ mann .
the evaluation of the new programme is a very important one .
the five best teams in the world , ar@@ tu@@ r br@@ ü@@ ck@@ ner , won the race .
a particularly than@@ k@@ ful to the rapporteur , mr van den berg , was sent to the team of ve@@ ren@@ sw@@ ir@@ tin ange , who once again presented a menu of the extra class and sent it to ger@@ da pi@@ er-@@ ri@@ b@@ bert for the table .

a ver@@ itable book of new goals in the fight against poverty .
the united nations is beginning to act as a global response to a number of new objectives , with the aim of reducing the millennium development goals announced twelve years ago .
in the run@@ -up to the un summit on sustainable development , which will be held in rio de jan@@ e@@ iro in the evening , austr@@ ali@@ an diplom@@ ats played a key role in the drive for “ sustainable development goals ” that could be implemented in 20@@ 15 .
you have been elected to the european parliament &apos;s final draft .
un secre@@ tar@@ y-@@ general ban ki@@ -@@ moon declared in the evening at the summit that the time has come to talk about “ national interests . ”
“ i am delighted that the european union ’ s member states have agreed to provide a process in which the eu can work together to establish universal , sustainable development goals .
“ this is what we are trying to achieve in the millennium development goals .
i will not ti@@ re of wan@@ ting to repeat this issue that was put to me by the member states , in order to re@@ define our vision of sustainable development goals , which are based on the success of the millennium goals . ”
the fact that the s@@ g achi@@ m / ba@@ den has been in the team for four days without a victory is still a bit of a bit of a bit of a bit of a bit of a bit of a bit of a bit of lu@@ ck .
this is why tra@@ in@@ ers tom@@ as@@ z mal@@ mon can &apos;t be in any doubt .
all are still fully motivated and willing to work with each other .
nevertheless , i hope that we can finally get back to it .
&quot; for i know that i am not even sure how so a victory sch@@ me@@ ck@@ t &quot; , he exp@@ ects a success .
the fact that the third lig@@ a reserves are to be financed from fre@@ den@@ bec@@ k currently does not make it possible to cover the costs of the project in advance .
many players have already made a deposit in the a-@@ ju@@ g@@ end .
from this point of view , they are being vio@@ lated against their ex@@ -@@ co@@ ach .
&quot; in addition , we must wait for the next two years to see if further strengthening is possible &quot; , explains the s@@ g-@@ co@@ ach .
to finally return to the success story , the commission has been forced to focus on the issue of the european union &apos;s external policy , which has been somewhat improved in comparison with previous appear@@ ances .
before all , in the cover area , and in the swit@@ ching of ha@@ per@@ te , it was finally enormous .
the commission also considers the use of opportunities to be a defin@@ ite improvement .
therefore , i hope that my players will be able to play at last during the short break .
security concerns in moscow are not a problem in the face of cl@@ ash@@ es between powerful person@@ alities and the opposition .
thousands of people gathered in the village centre of ma@@ pu@@ to to to observe the animals and the stat@@ ue of sam@@ ora mach@@ el , the state founder of the city and first president moz@@ ambi@@ que , to help with a rare public demonstration of peace .
“ we want to restore peace , we want stability , ” said van@@ ess@@ a de s@@ ous@@ a , managing director of an investment company .
for fear of the future of the country , it has changed its business clothes against a t-@@ shir@@ t with the “ we demand security ” label on portuguese .
since two weeks there is almost daily reports of break@@ down@@ s between government forces and ren@@ am@@ o , which have been one of the worst batt@@ les since the peace agreement more than 20 years ago .
ren@@ am@@ o was a member of the famous american film series , which was originally a not@@ ori@@ ous re@@ bel movement , and was initially governed by the r@@ ho@@ desi@@ a regime , and later by south africa &apos;s apar@@ tho@@ te@@ ls .
after the peace treaty of 1992 , it was transformed into an opposition party .
analy@@ sts keep it as un@@ likely that the country will return to a full-@@ blo@@ wn conflict , with the us and japan ’ s recent events have left foreign investors and loc@@ als wor@@ ried .
for the fast growing economy , much is at stake , because the discovery of huge reserves of gas is a challenge for the european union and for the coal industry in the north west could be a huge source of investment of more than usd 50 billion in the coming years from companies such as brazil .
the regi@@ stering freedom party is not a party that has been in power since 197@@ 5 , and ren@@ am@@ o is a mu@@ tually im@@ mor@@ tal blame for the ten@@ sions .
ren@@ am@@ o claims that the government has not yet taken into account the recent cl@@ ash@@ es by making a statement on 17 october to its members in the province of so@@ fal@@ a , a traditional rena@@ issance strong@@ hold .
the overwhel@@ ming majority of the population of the country is now living in the camps .
the government sp@@ ends ren@@ am@@ o the blame for the cl@@ ash@@ es and acc@@ uses the organization of killing soldiers .
president ar@@ man@@ do gu@@ e@@ bu@@ za has tried to raise concerns about an inst@@ ability that has been caused by the crisis .
opposite af@@ p , the french post-@@ war news agency , he said on wednesday that he had been arrested for using d@@ h@@ la@@ k@@ ama as a “ lo@@ ser ” who was “ all his remaining sup@@ porters . ”
both fre@@ li@@ mo and the rena@@ ult team stress that the time has come to avoid war .
but the concerns have been growing , since maastricht and amsterdam were linked to the words &apos; the euro is a currency of the future &apos; .
opposite the ft , he explained that i have meant that the debian project has been using fre@@ li@@ mo to dis@@ regard the agreement .
“ our vision is to be back in negotiations and to do so seriously , ” said ma@@ z@@ ang@@ a .
previous versions of the talks between the parties have had little to do with resol@@ ving the ten@@ sions that have been caused by a series of cl@@ ash@@ es this year .
“ we have a two-@@ adult man here ( gu@@ e@@ bu@@ za and dh@@ la@@ k@@ ama ) , who is the heads of the two “ , says the jo@@ se@@ ph@@ h h@@ ann@@ on , lec@@ ture@@ r at the open university and moz@@ art .
none of them is good in the negotiations and none is prepared to accept the necessary conc@@ essions .
ren@@ am@@ o , the world &apos;s most important electoral reform , has already stated that it will not take the local elections in november bo@@ y@@ cot@@ t .
presidential elections and elections are not a matter of time for next year .
some comm@@ ent@@ ators have suggested using g@@ end@@ er-@@ based violence as an attempt to prevent a we@@ ar@@ -@@ ri@@ dden movement from making conc@@ essions and financial conc@@ essions from the government .
ren@@ aming a new version of the game , ren@@ am@@ os has been shr@@ in@@ king since 1992 , while a ne@@ wer party , led by a former ren@@ am@@ o member , has been running out of office .
do you want to know more about the history of gu@@ e@@ bu@@ za ?
“ he wants no more multi-@@ party democracy , he wants no transparent elections , he wants a free peace , because he wants to hold the presidency .
it is un@@ clear whether the member states have the capacity to provide ren@@ am@@ o , but it has caused un@@ rest on the police stations and vehicles on an important north-@@ south connection .
the majority of the batt@@ les took place in the province of so@@ fal@@ a , which was a few hundred kilometres north of ma@@ pu@@ to , in which the two parties are still in the port , the mountain building industry and the rio t@@ into .
in june , the us under@@ went a month of rio ’ s use of the railways , after ren@@ am@@ o had att@@ acked the track .
do you want to know more about the history of ma@@ z@@ ang@@ a ?
ren@@ am@@ o wanted to “ strengthen the international community , war@@ n that things are going wrong in moz@@ ambi@@ que , ” he said .
the in@@ stability has caused the fru@@ stration of the government even more .
“ the people think that the world ’ s government and president are responsible for the country ’ s future , and that they should be the ones who provide solutions to the problems , ” he explains .
o@@ mar sul@@ tan@@ e , a prote@@ stant , was saying that the people wanted to be just stability .
“ no interested in ren@@ am@@ o and fre@@ li@@ mo , they want to just go back to peace and us@@ able roads , ” he explained .
children should be my@@ ths and leg@@ ends as “ pre@@ cur@@ sors for life ” .
the stories of the th@@ or showed that the two “ brut@@ al power ” did not have a chance to fight cle@@ ver tr@@ ic@@ ks , ” and the ar@@ tus leg@@ end demonstrated how important it was to create a dream .
many of the my@@ ths are not “ at all ” .
“ i find it wonderful that the european union is now using my@@ ths and fol@@ kl@@ ore as part of education , ” said he .
i have the feeling that this has been a plan for twenty years .
he added that the commission is not a party to the rules of the game , and that is why he has been so keen to make the game a reality .
cros@@ s@@ level support is a very popular sport in the netherlands , with the be@@ ow@@ ul@@ f translated from ang@@ lo@@ -@@ sa@@ x@@ on and author of the pen@@ gu@@ in book of nor@@ se my@@ ths and the british fol@@ k tal@@ es .
the perhaps biggest difference between a adult and a child is that he wri@@ tes for adult and an author who is responsible for children .
not everything has to be simplified or , in order to be able to end , but there is an im@@ man@@ ent sense of good and evil .
this must be signed and signed .
the first is the old story of showing instead of telling .
h@@ ls@@ j@@ ak@@ o@@ b is once again moving to fre@@ i@@ hof .
before 100 years , h@@ ine@@ in@@ rich han@@ s@@ j@@ ak@@ o@@ b has been in the company of his reti@@ rement in has@@ l@@ ach , and on sunday his last years were living in the &quot; fre@@ i@@ hof &quot; .
the many satisfied spec@@ t@@ ators were impres@@ sed by the extremely short scen@@ ic performance .
from the arrival through the rental of the hon@@ or@@ ary citizenship to the end of his death , fil@@ m@@ maker and han@@ s@@ j@@ ak@@ o@@ b actor alo@@ is kra@@ f@@ tz@@ cy@@ k had a fun piece of work , which was released under the direction .
mar@@ cel ’ s z@@ ag@@ er@@ mann received the audience as a speaker with the ten different scenes , explained summary of the inter@@ actions and brid@@ ged tempor@@ al le@@ aps from the youth to the close pen@@ sion@@ ers .
on 22 october 19@@ 13 , han@@ s@@ j@@ ak@@ o@@ b home was born in his children &apos;s sk@@ ies , in his fre@@ i@@ hof .
and then began the scenario of the game , in which alo@@ is kra@@ f@@ cz@@ y@@ k once again played in his par@@ ad@@ er@@ ol@@ l as the great son of the city .
sti@@ ll@@ ness dro@@ ve him to the two-@@ sid@@ ed and &quot; black forest &quot; fo@@ xes .
he was not only elected by the audience with great applause , but also his si@@ ster phili@@ pp@@ ine hi@@ e@@ ß called him welcome .
bi@@ ble is a game of bil@@ ly sum , and he was incredi@@ bly good at inter@@ acting with the si@@ ster .
between the different players , the game was played by the m@@ ill farm cha@@ pel , which was selected for the music and therefore roun@@ ded off the performance .
a number of other important issues are the issue of the right to vote in the elections .
your orders will be delivered to the tri@@ angle and sing@@ er , who played han@@ s@@ j@@ ak@@ o@@ b at the call for the release of &quot; ah how beautiful , you will be able to get youth in@@ duc@@ ements to my own three-@@ year old &quot; .
with its lo@@ ving song &quot; o jes@@ ul@@ in &quot; , the young girl was able to enjoy the outdoor pati@@ o and the stor@@ ch@@ ent@@ ag@@ sk@@ in@@ der with their l@@ oud &quot; out &quot; .
his criticism of the government church had been made by han@@ s@@ j@@ ak@@ o@@ b , just as his concerns about the exc@@ esses in the agricultural sector that have affected the consequences of industri@@ alisation or the effects of war .
in the hot summer season , the sun is sh@@ ining behind its grave cha@@ pel on the fire near ho@@ f@@ ste@@ t@@ ten .
&quot; a non-@@ calm place , i finally had his peace and was ready for ever . &quot; he said .
much applause for the work that has been done , and many p@@ raise for the audience .

the opportunities for the li@@ ga@@ -@@ remaining of the sport@@ y di@@ stan@@ ced lu@@ d@@ wi@@ gs@@ bur@@ ger bun@@ des@@ lig@@ a bas@@ ket@@ b@@ all@@ er have increased .
because if it were a wil@@ d@@ card procedure , it would be possible for the nec@@ k@@ ar gi@@ ants to have a competitors less .
the bas@@ que country football team is a team of young musicians from the german bas@@ ket@@ ball association ( b@@ as@@ ket@@ ball association ) .
&quot; we will not be on the wil@@ d@@ card procedure &quot; , said ex@@ -@@ national player pas@@ cal ro@@ ller , who has been in the concept of a professional club in the h@@ ann@@ es@@ stadt since 2012 .
a first call for a new era was made from lu@@ d@@ wi@@ gs@@ burg , however .
&quot; we employed a lot of the wil@@ d@@ card process , so long as we did not realize that d@@ üs@@ sel@@ dorf was not granted a licence , &quot; said nec@@ k@@ ar ri@@ es@@ en-@@ bo@@ ss alexander re@@ il of our newspaper .
until the 23@@ rd of may , clim@@ bers of d@@ üs@@ sel@@ dorf bas@@ ket@@ ts can still obtain documents from the arbitr@@ ation court and have their economic federal li@@ ga@@ -@@ su@@ it@@ ability proven .

after the visit of the nuclear kel@@ ly museum in the year 2000 , the ha@@ i@@ ger@@ lo@@ cher was to be seen as ha@@ i@@ ger@@ lo@@ ch , under the pre@@ us@@ sian rule .
kr@@ one &apos;s conclusion is that the european union &apos;s foreign policy is a visit to the church of the ab@@ end@@ -@@ ma@@ h@@ l@@ sk@@ ir@@ che .
there you will get the leaders of the company &apos;s history from the construction of the church and gain insight into the history of the ev@@ angel@@ ical community in a world which is by and through catho@@ lic .
not least , the resolution of the death of the king of the holy roman empire , which was supported by wal@@ ter kr@@ ö@@ ll and geor@@ g hal@@ brit@@ ter , is also a feature of the church .

ken@@ dri@@ ck jo@@ hn@@ son from val@@ do@@ sta in the us state of george washington , was born on january 11 in a re@@ vol@@ t ma@@ te-@@ found mat@@ te , behind the grand@@ stand in the school tower .
the commission &apos;s investig@@ ating officers at sh@@ eri@@ ff from l@@ ough ed@@ in@@ burgh have come to the conclusion that the jo@@ hn@@ son case was not a problem in a tragic accident , which led to the family of the 17@@ -@@ year-@@ old .
“ you are convinced that the future of your son is mur@@ dered , ” ben@@ jam@@ in c@@ rum@@ p said , the law@@ yer of ken@@ ne@@ th and j@@ acqu@@ el@@ ine , “ yes , you are wrong to fo@@ x@@ new@@ s.@@ com@@ .

“ you are the opinion that the time is right for any logic to be against which the laws of physi@@ cs and the law of common sense are being vio@@ lated . ”
rather , they are convinced that the truth will be hidden , to make the person or person who is not responsible for the death of their son .
“ your son went to study in the school and came in the l@@ add@@ ers . ” , comm@@ ented the author .
us treas@@ ury secretary michael mo@@ ore said on thursday that it will be a formal investigation into the death of jo@@ hn@@ son .
what was the death cause ?
is his death on a crime ?
the stated mo@@ ore at a press conference on thursday afternoon was a good example of this .
i follow the facts .
my aim is to make the truth and to do so .
“ i represent the world ’ s most important economic power to support the development of the country ’ s economy , ” he said .
mo@@ ore explained to re@@ porters that he had initially been a auto@@ ph@@ er that he had been a jo@@ hn@@ son .
a second car line is in the direction of another death .
“ it is a series of questions that are answered or confirmed , ” says the author .

c@@ d@@ c publish a wide range of aller@@ gic lines for schools and hospit@@ als in the european union .
on wednesday , the commission and the council published a report on the implementation of the european union &apos;s common foreign and security policy .
this is the first such measures .
one of 20 children in the united states has now lost a food aller@@ gy .
the spread of food aller@@ gies among children has , according to the c@@ dc , increased by 18 % between 1997 and 2007 .
the guidelines contain information for schools , which is not available to the teaching body and the staff for food aller@@ gies .
it is also recommended to use schools of ep@@ in@@ ep@@ hr@@ in to prepare the children for the school .
the legal authorities in the federal states have recently adopted the rules that allow schools to be ep@@ in@@ ep@@ hr@@ in easier to maintain .
in the report , there is also a list of typical symp@@ t@@ oms that are mentioned by children who have aller@@ gic reaction .
children say , perhaps , ‘ it feels like a child is being born on my ton@@ gue . ’
parents of inter@@ sexual children are free to use “ gender un@@ defined ” to make their children suffer from sexual violence .
germany is the first european nation to have a single european country .
new ze@@ al@@ and is not given star@@ t@@ l@@ ingly male or female birth any@@ more .
after the new law , parents must not be sex@@ es for such children , but can “ un@@ regulated ” or “ un@@ regulated ” on the birth rate .
the aim of the law is to increase pressure from parents to protect children from the excessive use of force .
a more inter@@ sexual person said , according to b@@ bc , that “ i am neither man nor woman . ”
i remain convinced that the f@@ lic@@ k@@ work that doctors have created is not the same as the one that has been created by doctors .
it is estimated that the number of people living in poverty is not the same as young or girls every year .
you are one of the inter@@ sexual , a group that is suffering from the diagno@@ sis of “ sexual differenti@@ ation dis@@ order ” ( ds@@ d ) .
wal@@ lit@@ i ’ s simp@@ son may have been inter@@ sexual .
the understanding of gender equality is a key element in the development of the european union , but most experts in the us are advis@@ ing that we should have the best available information on gender al@@ locations , if there is no provision for it .
the new york artist psy@@ chi@@ at@@ ris@@ t dr. j@@ ack dre@@ cher , who speci@@ ali@@ zes in the issue of gender identification , said that the new german law “ k@@ ling@@ e after a good cause ” .
inter@@ sexual relations are a problem of ethical concern .
“ some people have lost life threat@@ ening diseases , others have a chr@@ onic ill@@ ness .
it is possible to have sex as@@ sign@@ ment without sur@@ gery and then see how the situation develops .
the scientific data on how the system works is , of course , very important .
no one knows why it is happening .
it is like the secret of being able to kill hom@@ os@@ ex@@ u@@ als .
in a report to the european commission from the year 2011 , it says that inter@@ sexual people are excluded from trans@@ sexual services .
this feature showed that the new version of the game was a little more complex than the previous one , and was not so easy to use .
the report gives a clear overview of the discrimination that exists in the field of inter@@ sexual and trans@@ gen@@ ic persons in the work@@ place and of the extent of the har@@ ass@@ ment , violence and pre@@ jud@@ ice that women suffer .
not with the gender aspect , but with the fact that the young have a special camp .
meanwhile , it is in australia and ne@@ pal for adults to access official documents of male and female origin .
in june , austr@@ ali@@ an nor@@ r@@ ie ma@@ y-@@ wel@@ by ( 52 ) was appointed the first “ g@@ end@@ er-@@ free ” person in the world after a court had declared the life@@ time maintenance of a “ un@@ defined ” gender status .
german foreign pass@@ ports have a valid pass@@ port number for the same number of persons , for x for inter@@ sex@@ u@@ ell , the ministry of the interior .
in the neighbouring country of france , gender issues are still a controversial issue .
2011 the united states and the european union signed a series of agreements with the united states , which were signed by do@@ z@@ ens of french catho@@ lic members of the strictly catho@@ lic country .
the us government website cat@@ holiday is a new website , which is being developed by the german government , with the justi@@ fication that “ if the world is to be broken up into a new state where the sex is a decision to take sexual activity , but not then we will not take another two . ”
the mother of a new@@ born child from mar@@ y@@ land explained to bab@@ y zone that she cat@@ ches it better , if bab@@ ies were to be born a sex@@ y .
“ the mis@@ ery of paren@@ tal leave is still a problem , even without further restrictions .
children need stability and security .
histor@@ ically , the children who were born with both male and female children were not given the opportunity to participate in the education system .
i was just ten years ago , when medicine looked at the gender as something that could be elimin@@ ated and then re@@ built .
but now , the ethical and political foundations of an operation are being ques@@ tioned , after it is now known how complex the gender identity is , and that doctors are also wrong .
“ in the mid-@@ 20th century , the word “ one ” was called psy@@ chi@@ at@@ ric emergency , ” says dres@@ cher .
if a system of this kind was born , then it was not the psy@@ chi@@ at@@ ris@@ t who was called , but the sur@@ ge@@ on .
the ruling elite theory of the treatment of children with un@@ clear sexual gen@@ ital conditions is based on dr. john money of the jo@@ hn@@ s hope foundation .
he also played the term “ gender ste@@ re@@ ot@@ y@@ pe ” and argu@@ ed that social and environmental factors are in@@ he@@ ren@@ tly in@@ compatible with the way parents draw a child .
but in a country that is known as john / jo@@ an , the us government has been able to impose a ban on its the@@ ories .
he called for the parents of a young boy whose pen@@ is was killed by a food chain .
“ mon@@ ey presented the new case as a successful example of a re@@ vers@@ al that was not possible , ” he said .
as the young boy was about 15 , he changed back to the male boy , and was married to a woman who had been married .
with 38 but i did begin self-@@ murder .
according to the dres@@ cher , there are still doctors who have not yet practi@@ sed this model .
but in the 1990 ’ s , with the collapse of the internet , the vast majority of survi@@ v@@ ors of these gender operations were directed to the public , who “ were not happy with the result . ”
for example , in j@@ im bru@@ ce , a 36 year old author from mon@@ tan@@ a , who was working with x@@ y-@@ male ch@@ ro@@ mo@@ som@@ es , he was two months old , but ambigu@@ ous gen@@ itali@@ a .
the doctors are not sure whether they would be able to make a big cli@@ mat@@ or@@ is or a small pen@@ is , and they were convinced that they could never have a “ satis@@ fying life ” as a man .
so , his external budget was not adequ@@ ately represented , and the ho@@ den were not even ch@@ ir@@ urg@@ ically removed shortly after birth in 197@@ 6 , and he was cap@@ tured as a girl .
in the age of 12 , he was given female hor@@ mon@@ es .
“ i knew that i was a good friend , ” he said .
i was un@@ happy with the result , but it was really difficult to ask questions .
in the age of 18 he should have a v@@ ag@@ inal plastic .
but , as he is de@@ pressed , and he knew that he was doing something wrong , he was demanding that he be treated as a medical act .
what he points out is that it was sho@@ cking .
i was born in the netherlands and was born in germany .
bru@@ ce was played by a ds@@ d , which made his body un@@ heard of .
after having been telling the truth , he moved to the university of man@@ ch@@ ester , where he received a master &apos;s degree in economics from te@@ sto@@ ster@@ on-@@ injec@@ tions .
by using the operation , it is inf@@ er@@ tile .
today , the country is strugg@@ ling for others in an organisation called interface project to make inter@@ sexual relations a reality .
but , anne ta@@ mar@@ -@@ mat@@ tis , managing director of the company that was established in california , was not able to identify the problem .
“ many activi@@ sts are concerned that the government of germany is encouraging parents to take quick decisions .
we fear that the european union will be favour@@ ably dis@@ advant@@ aged by interven@@ tions .
we think that it would be better to have the male or female right to be treated .
but even more we do not know how the law will affect , so we cannot do anything other than spec@@ ulate .
ta@@ mar@@ -@@ mat@@ tis said that her organization supports the austr@@ ali@@ an law , because “ it allows adults to take the recognition as the third sex ” .
“ adult should be able to learn to use their own decisions on their legal sex . ”
in the german law , the issue is the allocation of the birth of the child .
the first is not a fight that can be fought by small children at this time .
if you are growing up , you can choose to have your own body .
but dr ar@@ len@@ e bar@@ at@@ z , a brother of the si@@ ster of pi@@ th@@ en@@ ian , was not able to get a daughter with a sexual differenti@@ ation dis@@ order and was able to take hundreds of others to help .
k@@ ati@@ e , the daughter of k@@ are@@ l got@@ t , was born with male cho@@ irs , and was a member of the family of ds@@ d .
because of the reci@@ pe def@@ ect of the target cells for te@@ sto@@ ster@@ one , k@@ ati@@ e fem@@ in@@ ine characteristic has been developed .
you have a v@@ ag@@ ina , but no u@@ ter@@ us and no e@@ gg@@ s .
today , k@@ ati@@ e 29 and ver@@ he@@ ira@@ ted ; she works on the university of california , and she is a member of the staff of the university of pen@@ n@@ sy@@ l@@ v@@ ania .
while the commission is inf@@ er@@ tile , it hopes that the adoption of children or the temporary mother will bring a child .
“ the law gives parents room to make their children un@@ hur@@ ried .
it is a powerful tool that allows you to perform various tests and to clarify things and give you time to test them .
on this basis , everything is in order – you are not taking the child seriously and lo@@ ving it .
it has a wonderful feeling of being a baby and enjoys the paren@@ tal happ@@ iness .
and it must not be ha@@ sty to take an operation that is not restricted to the last one .
“ the company includes children in the decision .
finally , the european union will decide on the sex , which is better suited to it – and that is wonderful .
this will help children to be able to develop the choice themselves .
un@@ familiar publish@@ ers in@@ j@@ ure girls by shot from car , and the police are now destro@@ ying them .
un@@ familiar people have a lot of fun with sho@@ ts from a car in sa@@ x@@ on@@ y-@@ an@@ hal@@ t .
the perpe@@ tr@@ ators had a very good chance to get their hands on the ti@@ de in g@@ ent on thursday evening with an air force .
the partial result was that the police in burg shared that .
the girl is easy to get on the left w@@ ade .
re@@ tt@@ on forces bro@@ ke the girl into hospital , and the girl was killed .
the sho@@ ot came from a small car , which was on a group of six children .
wit@@ nesses saw two people in the car sitting .
the perpe@@ tr@@ ators were also sho@@ c@@ ked by a bus stop .
a disk is dis@@ solved and the wall was broken .
then the two men dro@@ ve from the house .
the crimin@@ als are now investig@@ ating , saying that they were told on friday .
until the present time , the police inspec@@ tions can only stop k@@ emp@@ ten in a calm hal@@ lo@@ ween night .
the officials were merely twice as much in the o@@ a@@ ths of the children who were forced to take them out of their homes .
as the house owners are not going to recognize this in time and the o@@ a@@ sters are just as dist@@ ant , no material damage has been caused .
furthermore , the report also contains a number of sy@@ l@@ ves@@ ter floors .
a fixed price for a single room is $ 2@@ 5.@@ 00 per night .
until the first flight of police , the man has not yet finished his sle@@ d@@ ge@@ ham@@ mer , however , in the immediate vicinity of everyone , so the police have not had to take any further action .
this hotel is situated in the heart of the city , close to the main shopping area and the main shopping street .
in fact , wal@@ tr@@ au@@ d ries lives in a dream .
your house is located in a quiet residential area of stutt@@ gart , with plenty of green , a old tree house , ne@@ at neighbours and also not too much traffic .
in the city are the only few minutes by public transport .
&quot; you have hopefully no fear of sp@@ id@@ ers ? &quot; as@@ ks wal@@ tr@@ au@@ d ries and shows in a f@@ at sp@@ in@@ ne@@ e at the door frame .
i am looking for a new version of the apartment for my hus@@ band and myself for some time .
but they know that the commission is difficult to do so in stutt@@ gart .
the reason is that there is no spi@@ der pho@@ bia , but rather a concern to get the many sta@@ ir@@ case steps to the house and the apartment in old age to be unable to cope with .
moreover , since a men@@ i@@ k@@ us operation , the middle fif@@ ties have been on her own body .
before the first world war , a book was published by her on the theme of &apos; happy living in old age - what kind of living is the best for me ? &apos; .
&apos;@@ our apartment is the best example of how we can make a living in the age of 18 &apos; , begins to tell you .
as they were in the european union more than 20 years ago with their hus@@ band , they were not able to get a nice apartment in the middle of the green .
today , in the mid-@@ fif@@ ties , wal@@ tr@@ au@@ d ries thin@@ ks differently about this .
you know , however , that you have been one of the few people who have ever looked at the subject of &apos; living in the age &apos; .
the majority of them are ex@@ porting it until it is done .
old are still only the other &apos; , says she wrote .
only when the passion for the moment really is great will i be able to think about it .
&apos;@@ then i can &apos;t wait for a long time &apos; , says richard wag@@ ner .
in its book , the interior architec@@ ts , 17 residential models , are designed for a self-@@ determined living in old age .
&apos;@@ what kind of accommodation can you choose , &apos; he said .
d i e solution i give it not for the age .
even if you look at the age of reti@@ rement in tus@@ c@@ any or bre@@ tag@@ ne , you will find that you are always well aware that you are also becoming ill .
and : &apos; without good knowledge of the national language , the european union also uni@@ tes the languages of the world in dol@@ ce vit@@ a , &apos; says the specialist book@@ maker of those willing to ex@@ ile .
under your models , you will find classic support services such as alternative housing , or the often ci@@ ted prof@@ it@@ ability w@@ g .
in the age of the age of 18 , everyone has their own tips and tr@@ ic@@ ks and make their own pieces .
&apos;@@ for me , it would be a community of living but nothing &apos; , says she with a eye cat@@ cher .
the european union is not , as in a student w@@ g with a shared bathroom and a kitchen .
&apos;@@ in the old age , you just need to get back your rooms &apos; , says ries .
the fact that senior citizens &apos; resid@@ ency is still able to function is something that the book author does not want to rule out .
the problem must be solved differently .
and sometimes i want to be just a little quiet , &apos; believes it .
with this opinion , it is at least in the capital of the state .
&apos;@@ the majority of old people in stutt@@ gart are keen to work for as long as they are in their own home &apos; , is also the experience of there@@ a r@@ ü@@ t@@ ten , the head of the civil service life at the age of the capital .
your services will advise you on the subject of the &quot; elderly &quot; , the &quot; old &quot; and the &quot; new &quot; .
that is why older people in particular would often be un@@ comfortable and restrictions on their freedom to use the internet .
the first is that there are many ways to get the house or apartment accessible .
ri@@ es recomm@@ ends that all those who are interested in the age fair use of their house or apartment should contact the hotel before they can make a reservation .
today , there are also many new member states for the renov@@ ation of existing buildings .
even in the rental apartment lam@@ p the water is one or two .
but not always can be the existing apartment be adapted to the age and thus accessible .
this experience had to be shared by wal@@ tr@@ au@@ d ries .
while the commission could be expected to make a sta@@ ir@@ lift inside the apartment , which is also covered with sta@@ irs , it could be used as a living room .
you will be able to continue your search until you have the ideal object for yourself and your hus@@ band .
before the conversion , gra@@ y it was more than a week before the sp@@ in@@ ning at your living room .
usa wants to ban snow@@ den further from prosecu@@ ting .
the us has its attitude to the former us intelligence officer ed@@ ward snow , who was not present .
he will continue to be accused of being un@@ authorised to pass on secret information .
therefore , we must be able to rely on a criminal trial in the united states , said the us secretary of state , jen@@ ni@@ fer p@@ sa@@ ki , in washington .
the commission &apos;s recent statements on the situation in the russian federation would not change that either .
previously , the german founder of the company , han@@ s-@@ christian str@@ ö@@ be@@ le , had a meeting with snow@@ den in moscow to discuss the usa .
p@@ sa is a very important part of the project , and it is a very important part of the process of the process .
secret services are the key to the success of ed@@ ward snow &apos;s secret service development .
first of all , however , he wants to know his situation .
the result of the work of the united states former n@@ sa commission staff in a non-@@ ad@@ min@@ istered letter made this clear , which was not submitted to the green politici@@ an han@@ s-@@ christian str@@ ö@@ be@@ le on friday after a meeting with snow@@ den .
the letter has , after a stre@@ am@@ lined and more complex translation , been translated :
the commission &apos;s competent authorities must be informed of the relevant decisions and the relevant decisions of the council .
i was asked to give you a detailed answer on your inquiry into mass surveillance .
i welcome the ed@@ ward jo@@ se@@ ph@@ h snow@@ den and i was previously a contrac@@ tor or a direct employee as a technical expert at the national security agency .
in the course of my work in these institutions , i witn@@ essed systematic legislative violations in my government , which led me to vote against the report on moral obligation .
as a result of the publication of these concerns , i was faced with a serious and persi@@ stent he@@ dge which forced me to leave my family and my home .
i live in the middle east , and i enjoy the temporary work of the police and the police .
i am encouraged to hear from the res@@ on@@ ance to my political action , both in the united states and elsewhere .
citizens on the whole world and also high official figures are the ones who are the victims of the de@@ eds .
this spir@@ al of violence is a source of concern to many of the proposals for new laws and directives , which are based on the previously hidden agenda abuse of public confidence .
the benefits for the society from these experiences are not limited to the benefits of the new technologies , but at the same time , the risks that have been bought have been clearly reduced .
although the result of my efforts has been demonstr@@ ably positive , my government is tre@@ ating dis@@ sent as a fa@@ i@@ th@@ ful and is seeking to prevent political expression .
nevertheless , the truth is not enough .
i am confident that the european union &apos;s government will be able to make a positive contribution to this harmful attitude with the support of the international community .
i hope that the commission will , if the difficulties of this humanitarian situation are resolved , be able to provide the necessary assistance to me in the proper investigation of the facts concerning the cases in which the media have been made , particularly with regard to truth and authentic@@ ity .
i am pleased to see you in the future .

report : ob@@ am@@ a-@@ campaign considered how to make bi@@ ds accessible through h@@ ill@@ ary clin@@ ton .
the en@@ demic consult@@ ants of president bar@@ ack obama have been in the secret of thinking , vice-president jo@@ e bi@@ den , in the 20@@ 12 election campaign , replaced by h@@ ill@@ ary clin@@ ton , with the new york times .
the dec@@ ou@@ pling of the situation is the most significant achievement of the european parliament &apos;s long-@@ awa@@ ited work by mark hal@@ per@@ in and john he@@ il@@ em@@ ann on the 20@@ 12 election campaign , &quot; double down : ga@@ me chan@@ ge 2012 .
the ti@@ mes is a former ex@@ porter of the upcoming tim@@ es@@ he@@ et , which is now being reported to the press on thursday evening , that the dead are being killed by president ’ s top advis@@ ers .
according to jon@@ a@@ than martin , national political correspon@@ dence , the british national press , the country ’ s book is thoroughly drawing on the history of the efforts of leading officials in the campaign and the white house , in particular the former white house chief of staff .
the potential benefits of the change were a strictly guar@@ ded and secret .
only a half-@@ century later , the us economy ’ s clo@@ s@@ est advis@@ ers – including dal@@ ey , the former campaign leader , j@@ im mes@@ sing@@ a , and the former chief executive , of the white house , david ax@@ el@@ ro@@ d , and david .
in “ doub@@ le-@@ down ” , the claim is that d@@ ac@@ ey has led the effort to make the bi@@ den a world leader despite its “ close , personal relationship . ”
in a interview with the martin , he confirmed that the european union is not really concerned about how to make bi@@ ds accessible through clin@@ ton .
“ i am not expressing a whole series of things that can be considered , but i am not doing so .
it is important to remember that the european council president , at the time , was terri@@ bly question@@ able , so we thought : “ for god ’ s sake , what do we do ? ”
during dav@@ y &apos;s investigations were described as &quot; a necessary care &quot; , the company said that he was not responsible for the in@@ qui@@ ries to an@@ der@@ son co@@ op@@ er from c@@ n@@ n .
“ in campaigns , the focus is not so much money on surve@@ ys and focus groups as on the “ more serious ” issue .
it is , however , not clear whether obama knew that the us congress team had a share of it .
martin said to c@@ n@@ n that he had thought of d@@ all@@ y if his then leader was the bo@@ ss over the potential change .
although the commission has not explained that it does not believe that the european parliament &apos;s president will be “ aware of the change that may occur ” , the former chief of staff announced that it was “ possible ” to prevent obama from doing so .
martin added that the debian project is not a double down , but a single , global response to the question of whether the political songs are in obama ’ s desk .
co@@ op@@ er won@@ dered martin , if he would seriously think obama has nothing of the investigations about how to use the new version of bi@@ den in the elections .
“ possible ” , the response was by martin .
what happens when i am on the road ?
e-mail is not really an electronic letter , as it is .
was the design of the internet service a similar e-mail as with the traditional mail .
in the design of the early internet services , the focus was on providing communication .
therefore , the commission &apos;s basic technical proto@@ col@@ s did not take into account the need to establish a stable foundation for consultation with the public .
therefore , a her@@ o@@ ic e-mail is more like an open post@@ card than a se@@ aled letter .
if users are &quot; an@@ na &quot; interested in &quot; ben@@ ni &quot; send an email , they are not registered with the same e-mail address ?
the e-mail program or the browser of an@@ na sch@@ ick@@ t will send the mail to the mail@@ -@@ server of your service provider in the first step .
if you are looking for a g@@ mail account , you might want to use google .
this magic sp@@ ell server sen@@ ds the content to the provider , the ben@@ ni uses .
on the route you can send the mail via a number of other servers on the internet .
ben@@ ni@@ e can change the content in his provider .
will her@@ bal medicines be used on your way ?
the majority of ma@@ ils are sent multiple times by software robo@@ ts .
the commission has a problem with the sen@@ der &apos;s provider .
on the recipi@@ ent pages , the user is also provided with a virus check .
in addition , the providers who provide the service check whether it is a ti@@ ring and un@@ wanted sp@@ am mail .

the prob@@ ability of a single person being killed by un@@ authorized persons is very high .
in theory , the problem is possible .
in companies , the administration often has the opportunity to send electronic mail .
the commission also has a responsibility to the law enforcement authorities and the secret services to send e-@@ ma@@ ils or to take note of them .
this is accompanied by possible illegal se@@ gre@@ gation actions .
is it possible to send e-@@ ma@@ ils against reading ?
with a encry@@ ption after the open@@ p@@ g@@ p standard , a mail can effectively be read against mit@@ reading .
with a high technical effort , it is also possible to use met@@ ad@@ ata of an e-mail communication .

mother in the forest dis@@ appeared and ren@@ ted ka@@ si@@ ert .
as his crew was killed , he was killed by a group of men who had been killed by a plan from wol@@ f@@ sburg .
he was also a member of the united nations security council , and was a member of the un security council .
to continue ren@@ ting and care services , we need to have a european public health fund ( e@@ ba ) , a 6@@ 7-@@ year-@@ old wol@@ f@@ sburg , which has lost its dead mother after investigation of the police in the forest .
first of all , he condemned the death of the 8@@ 9-@@ year-@@ old , then he had lost the money more than a year and a half .
now , the council of 67 years must be allowed to be responsible for fraud , as a spo@@ kes@@ man said on friday .
consequently , the commission hi@@ d the man and hi@@ d the woman in a forest near hel@@ m@@ ste@@ dt .
the susp@@ ects are not allowed to be arrested in may : at that time , they were already being held responsible for the need for care .
the er@@ mit@@ t@@ ler@@ in@@ nen told the pen@@ sion@@ ers to leave his mother to spain .
because the officials have been cur@@ ious about this , they told me that they had to go on .
the first step was to find out that the two had been in a common flat for more than 15 years and they had recently been ca@@ red for .
the 6@@ 7-@@ year-@@ old finally got the death of his mother .
a hom@@ o@@ gene@@ ous period of time , according to the police , did not show any evidence of a capital crime .

the hotel is located in the ei@@ is@@ cre@@ me , and re@@ acts with the ton@@ gue in a neutral ph@@ -@@ value .
if the mouse is not the prote@@ in , the sound is rising .
we have managed to achieve a great deal in recent months and it seems to us ideal to use it on hal@@ lo@@ ween on the market .
it is probably the most expensive ice cre@@ am , which i have ever made , because the qu@@ all@@ en@@ lights are not the same as four times more expensive than gold .
each cu@@ b@@ ic co@@ il costs me about 1@@ 40 p@@ ounds .
but that is what the people of the world are looking for .
char@@ lie ’ s experim@@ ental company with headquarters in bri@@ st@@ ol is famous for its innovative and innovative products .
but his latest version of the story is to be more ambitious .
he says : ‘ i want to have an invi@@ sible eg@@ g cre@@ am . ’

the commission has finally taken the initiative , with the exception of the permanent in@@ ju@@ red h@@ end@@ ri@@ k blo@@ h@@ me , to make its complete body available .
the hotel is also a perfect base for exploring the city .
therefore , we must re@@ double our error rate .

the commission , however , wants to look into this in mor@@ sum , to find a series of things .
if there is a missing j@@ an-@@ mal@@ te jo@@ d@@ at .
for this , the a-@@ ju@@ g@@ end@@ lic@@ he jo@@ o@@ st wind@@ ß@@ u@@ ß , who has been awarded double the a-@@ ju@@ g@@ end@@ g@@ ä@@ u@@ fi@@ ge h@@ c bre@@ men prize , celebra@@ tes his seas@@ onal de@@ but .

in the last two years i have been unable to explain why i am speaking from my home in s@@ wee@@ ts .

according to google , most of the sear@@ ches are cost@@ umes zo@@ om@@ bi@@ es , bat@@ man , pi@@ rates and h@@ ex@@ en .
i susp@@ ect that it is not a bad thing to have tradition .
we have seen last year our dogs and we have seen the dogs in the gallery .

the first is that the first thing you can do is to have a good time with your friends .
what southern africa is not about is the fact that we are not s@@ wee@@ ts .
americans will not be able to spend $ 1.@@ 9 billion this year , so the ni@@ el@@ sen company .
the first two years of the war were marked by a series of changes in the structure of the economy , and the number of people living in the country increased by about 2@@ 70 million .
so good news for the according us trade ministry 41 million people , who are in the &quot; south american &quot; or &quot; sau@@ res &quot; with the s@@ wee@@ ts or sau@@ res &quot; .
indeed , we will have more than 40 million kil@@ o@@ gram@@ s of chocolate for hal@@ lo@@ ween and , let us not be fo@@ ol@@ ed , eat it .
the only thing that we do not con@@ sume is to eat sugar .
the first two years of the war were marked by a massive increase in the number of people living in the country .
it is a myster@@ y that the commission is not yet able to resolve .
nothing is more part of hal@@ lo@@ ween than houses , in which there are sp@@ ur@@ ious .
you have done a great job , such as “ terror , ” and you have a great deal of work to do in a real prison , “ hope , ” and “ the need to fight terrorism . ”
it is true that there are 1,@@ 200 officially recognised sp@@ uk@@ h houses in the united states , which provide $ 500 million in revenue , so america ha@@ un@@ ts , and that includes the wonderful examples of photos that we have been able to take .
but let us finally come to the shor@@ ter ones .
char@@ lie chap@@ lin , in his report , gave us the great impression that we were children , and that was how we cut a shor@@ ter b@@ ite is like a s@@ mu@@ gg@@ ling of christmas tree – something that we have been able to do from small .
fortunately , the war began in the united states in the shor@@ b@@ is , only last year thanks to p@@ inte@@ st , so most of us could be grown up with it to make the shor@@ test possible cuts and not to be in it .
this year , americans will spend about $ 10@@ 6 million on cu@@ t@@ backs , so the us cen@@ sus bureau has said .
the reduction in the number of people slowly moving forward in the front garden is a result of the il@@ lin@@ o@@ is , where this year 24@@ 5 million kilometres of shor@@ ter cuts have been har@@ ves@@ ted .

on the late thursday afternoon , the commission had a meeting with the president of the european parliament on the ground floor .
as the fire bro@@ ke , the police were s@@ wal@@ low@@ ing up the fire from a window .
the application forces went into the apartment and found the light bul@@ b in a room .
this and a further room bran@@ ded completely , and the hotel was completely renovated .
the entire earth@@ qua@@ ke was damaged and the building was destroyed .
all other residents were killed during the fire , and the fire was declared a for@@ tress .
the building is pre@@ domin@@ antly un@@ occupied , but it is a little bit like a hotel .
the exact cause of the fire was initially not clear .
germany ’ s largest national church has a more off@@ ensive culture .

for young people from today , the profes@@ sion is very attractive and offers a good future prospects .
it is attractive to have the labour and social day of the day in place .
with bur@@ fi@@ en , the country ’ s church has for the first time built a pa@@ st@@ or on a full place , providing young people with a degree of theore@@ tical knowledge .
at present , more and more young people are choosing to work after the ab@@ it@@ ur , the@@ ology .
bur@@ fi@@ a is leading this to the process of dec@@ ar@@ bon@@ isation : &quot; god &apos;s voice is quiet , the world is l@@ oud &quot; .

you have subsequently made a few dogs and you can see that the whole thing is very good .
the reason for this was quite unusual .
the fact that the council has not discovered the dog is incredible .
peter l@@ au , specialist in the technical re@@ tro@@ fit@@ ting team , has said : “ ru@@ by had a giant problem with the rescue . ”
it was the possibility of the commission being very seriously in@@ ju@@ red or worse .

george w. bush ’ s “ european enthusiasm ”
a new day , a new terrible tragedy , to independence .
this time , we will be war@@ ned that a more independent scotland will be required to join the euro zone .
the company provides the key word for sk@@ ill about pass@@ port controls in ber@@ w@@ ick and a statement about the pass@@ port controls in the ber@@ w@@ ick region .
in the meantime , the commission &apos;s stra@@ th@@ cl@@ y@@ de proposal refers to the potential economic benefits that more travel freedom could bring in the rest of europe .
the commission has not mentioned that the european union &apos;s member states are often in breach of their strict rules , when it comes to making it cheaper for them .
as scotland is a member of the schengen area at present , it would be pre@@ mature to continue to ignore brussels .
so in fact no story .
and a , the one that has been so in the years that you have already given a fo@@ ssi@@ l : the first time i have seen the “ independence means pass@@ port controls ” duc@@ k at least 40 years ago .
the issue is one of interest in the constant repe@@ ti@@ tion of this ancient history .
why should we talk about an independent scotland ?
why is the london summit of the 19@@ 30 ’ s against the europe of brussels , especially now ?
the first is the real european news .
with the euro@@ crisis , the project for europe has officially died .
everywhere in the eu , parties are gaining ground , eu enem@@ ies are being att@@ acked or the euro is being thro@@ wn over@@ board as a single currency .
even in germany , the euro@@ s@@ cep@@ tic party could find alternative for germany – only this year – bare@@ ly five million votes in the federal elections .
it was already a hot spot for the european union to launch a feder@@ alist project .
the current economic crisis is , however , a turning point .
because of the berlin and the european central bank &apos;s sanctions , the ecb has been forced to make a very strict au@@ ster@@ ity policy , in conjunction with the stra@@ it@@ jack@@ et in which the national economy is forced to bur@@ y its single currency .
the crisis in the euro has little to do with the fact that national governments have imposed excessive budget deficits – that was only the case in greece .
instead , the euro@@ system has reduced its members to exchange rates , and the ecb has been responsible for german ex@@ porters .
without the possibility of a de@@ preci@@ ation of the local currency , southern europe will find itself with a buil@@ t-@@ in productivity dis@@ advantage over germany .
the only way to do this is to pay wages and public spending , which is sti@@ mu@@ lated by berlin .
behind the current et@@ at@@ - and monetary problems , the european central bank is deeply ent@@ ren@@ ched in productivity problems .
as a result of the decisions taken by brussels , the ‘ green ’ energy lines – a code for the subsid@@ ising of french producers and german energy companies on the expense of consumers – the european industry is paying a very high price compared with the united states .
the first step is to make the system work more efficiently .
all wage re@@ stra@@ ints on the world protect the european petro@@ chemical industry not from being hit by cheap american petro@@ l .
as a result , a re@@ vol@@ t is drag@@ ging on , especially in france , the former chief executive of the eu .
after the war , the political elite saw france as a threat to the eu .
but berlin needs paris not only to be a ga@@ te@@ way to political legitimacy , and europe has put its own economic policy on the map , which is a cont@@ ag@@ ious french economy .
the result : mar@@ ine le pen &apos;s legal person@@ ality is a european enemy .
the front national is now the most popular party in france with 24 % of the elec@@ tor@@ ate – a timely warning that the french government is not prepared to accept the new constitution .
what makes le pen a unique brand of popular music ?
you want to strengthen the eu elections next year to make a fight against the eu , anti-@@ community monetary blo@@ c in the european parliament .
if the anti-@@ eu parties are not present in these elections , as they are , and this is very well possible , then a new block of this kind could domin@@ ate the european parliament for the first time .
this is the point that i would like to make : in not too dist@@ ant future , the growing res@@ ent@@ ment of the eu and the common currency will become a source of the abolition of the euro .
the eu will not dis@@ appear if it does not have the same kind of ‘ europe of the ( sovereign ) nations ’ .
germany and a few of its satellite economies are perhaps the most stable in the euro , but france and southern europe are becoming their own curren@@ cies .
i expect the commission to take a stand on this project , in the hope that it will be able to get involved with the united states .
however , washington is now setting a new standard for the pacific , with the us and japan alone having a two-@@ ti@@ er system .
where is scotland ?
we cannot decide whether to build a region of ( in the final consequence ) small england .
or we can use our own economic interests – for which we also have to defend berlin and brussels , what they are doing where they are .
i susp@@ ect that scotland will be able to do so in a more loc@@ k@@ able european union , provided that we have our own currency .
the cooperation with other , similar thinking groups is essential in a non-@@ federal europe .
otherwise , we should consider whether it is norway &apos;s equal to the others and our economic independence .
the s@@ n@@ p government in scotland has been very active – remarkable for its efforts – in the area of political freedom , security and justice .
it would be a great pleasure for scotland to have a say in the independence of the country now , only to be able to make a policy of au@@ ster@@ ity imposed on the countries of berlin and brussels .
early child@@ hood pu@@ ber@@ ness : faster growth is achieved by increasing the number of young people who are able to grow faster .
af@@ ro@@ american and hi@@ spanish girls reach ten@@ aci@@ ously higher levels of pub@@ er@@ ty than their white age co@@ oper@@ atives , as studies show .
physical and mental changes are not yet directly the pu@@ ber@@ cy of the body .
it is not a sign that the european union is not prepared to take any action to prevent hor@@ mon@@ es or other chemicals .
experts believe that the ep@@ ide@@ mic f@@ at glu@@ co@@ se is a tri@@ gger for di@@ abe@@ tes disease early in the year .
the trend towards the early pur@@ i@@ fication is less pron@@ oun@@ ced in young children , but more in young adults .
the former commission c@@ n@@ n correspon@@ dent , who was a member of the c@@ n@@ n , is a journ@@ alist who has been working on child health and family issues .
if a mother is wor@@ ried when her daughter is already in the age of seven or eight , she will be able to bre@@ a@@ the and sh@@ am@@ ha@@ irs ?
in the annual conference of the nur@@ ser@@ y association of the american academy of sciences in washington , dc , the european commission adopted a resolution on the situation in the middle east .
“ i spent a lot of time on the idea of re@@ ass@@ uring parents – usually this is not a sign that the children are now quickly getting up to the pu@@ zz@@ le , ” explains k@@ ap@@ lo@@ wit@@ z .
rev@@ el@@ ation of the development , as for example growing bro@@ thers , damage to the sh@@ ame and the under@@ carri@@ age , and body sm@@ ell , are seen earlier in girls .
nevertheless , there were only a s@@ light shift in the age of the men@@ ar@@ che ( oc@@ curren@@ ce of the first regular ble@@ eding ) over the last 40 years .
in the united states , the average age of the population is 12@@ ,@@ 5 years , a little less than 12.@@ 75 in 197@@ 0 .
“ if the development of the bre@@ asts begins , it takes at least two to three years to get to the men@@ ar@@ che ” , says k@@ ap@@ lo@@ wit@@ z , author of the book “ early pu@@ ber@@ ty among girls : the essential advice .
time is the exact moment .
it is controversial that the european union should have started to put its pu@@ ber@@ cy in place , but it is important to be “ early ” if the bre@@ ast enlargement is to be accompanied by growth s@@ lu@@ mp before an age of eight .
in the majority of cases , the number of cases is slow@@ ing or stag@@ n@@ ating – something that a child doctor can monitor closely .
in the case of rapid progress , we could have tests carried out by a en@@ dic@@ r@@ ous o@@ log@@ ist , so that serious problems such as t@@ um@@ ors or cy@@ sts can be avoided .
it is a treatment method for dela@@ ying a early men@@ stru@@ ation and for the sc@@ aling of another sequ@@ ence : the early men@@ stru@@ ation of bone .
the recommendations for a medic@@ ation solution are not yet in force .
psycho@@ therapy , psycho@@ logical aspects are also important .
k@@ ap@@ lo@@ wit@@ z is re@@ luc@@ t@@ ant about medic@@ ation , but he acknowled@@ ges that the “ risk of sup@@ pression of the pub@@ er@@ ty can cause behavi@@ oral problems and the feel@@ ings of girls , unlike their age com@@ r@@ ades . ”
the other major problem is understand@@ able : parents simply do not want their very young dau@@ gh@@ ters to have the period .
“ you are wor@@ ried about the pregn@@ ancy risk , or about the way you treat the hygi@@ ene issue .
“ it was a sho@@ ck , ” rec@@ alls a woman who was killed by a ten year-@@ old daughter .
the fact that there are initial signs and we are talking about men@@ stru@@ ation is a sign of emo@@ tional un@@ prepared .
you came to fear and to be afraid .
it is a very good idea to have a good idea of the causes of early pub@@ er@@ ty .
but it is not clear whether the eu is capable of providing a sufficient level of protection for hor@@ mon@@ es in milk or other foods , chemicals in the environment or sexual messages .
young people are coming to the european union in the same way as girls .
k@@ ap@@ lo@@ wit@@ z is the view that the most convinc@@ ing pre@@ mise is the ep@@ ide@@ mic of f@@ at le@@ uk@@ a@@ em@@ ia .
he supported the idea of a study in 2008 , which included girls aged between six and nine , and was able to establish a link between body f@@ at and the entry into pub@@ er@@ ty .
other studies support this conclusion .
in this country , af@@ ro@@ american and hi@@ spanish girls tend to reach the pu@@ ber@@ ty rather than their white age co@@ oper@@ atives .
it is clear that there are different explanations .
global appears to be an early pu@@ ber@@ ty of all possible things .
a further myster@@ y is that , although young people are not aware of the face and sh@@ am@@ po@@ o hair , the trend is to increase the total number of earlier pu@@ ber@@ cy .
other doctors have been on the a@@ ap conference to stress the complexity of the problem .
the rise of new ac@@ ne and sh@@ am@@ ha@@ ar is even possible with bab@@ ies and small children .
“ we need to be careful , as we can see the real beginning of pu@@ ber@@ ity , ” he said .
parents should not hesitate to use the internet to get away from their children , as they have done with their child .

j@@ um@@ bo@@ -@@ manufacturer stri@@ kes in the face of big orders over seats width and height .
between leading aircraft manufacturers and the market , it is becoming a dispute about the broad range of seats in the tourist class at long-@@ hau@@ l flights .
the dispute over the rules of procedure is about the width of the seat , the passengers are not allowed to travel long flights in the tourist class – not always those who are concerned with the airlines most , but this bal@@ ancing act is a political key .
airbus is demanding a reduction in the size of its fleet this week , and it is expected that it will have a se@@ ating width of at least 46 cm ( 18 in@@ ches ) in the tourist class , but the us arch@@ -@@ american arch@@ ery says it should do .
the debate on the subject is coming at a time when the aircraft buil@@ ders are bet@@ ting on whether to make even larger versions of their two-@@ engine long-@@ hau@@ l aircraft .
as the re@@ ar part of the aircraft is designed , the aircraft is designed to be a series of nine or ten seats , and is crucial for the specified economic results , which the new “ minim@@ a ” system can deliver .
bo@@ eing 7@@ 47 was the first to launch a new bo@@ eing 7@@ 7@@ 7@@ x bo@@ eing 7@@ 7@@ x bo@@ eing 7@@ 7@@ x bo@@ eing 7@@ 6@@ . it was the first to be equipped with a new generation of 7@@ 7@@ 7@@ 7@@ 7@@ 7@@ 7@@ x .
airbus is committed to maintaining the competitive position of the a3@@ 50 , which is 3@@ 50 people in 18 seats .
aircraft manufacturers and suppliers are now sharing heat with the world ’ s largest aircraft manufacturers .
now i appeal to airbus to the du@@ ba@@ i airbus show to take the 7@@ 7@@ 7@@ x with over 100 orders .
recently , the company introduced an ad that was the beginning of a new ad war .
“ bo@@ eing ” is a long-@@ hau@@ l flight in seats that is closer to the regional tur@@ bo@@ -@@ pro@@ ps ” , says airbus president and ceo tom enders .
given the changing nature of food , the food prices will be more th@@ ick , but aircraft seats will have more radical effects .
between the early 197@@ 0s and the early 197@@ 0s , when bo@@ eing 7@@ 47 was the modern long-@@ hau@@ l voy@@ age , and the end of the century , the weight of the male average man has increased from 40 to 49 years .
the tai@@ w@@ anese manufacturer &apos;s wai@@ st@@ co@@ at size is about 20 cm in the 21st century , according to us health statistics .
airbus is telling us that its ri@@ val is in line with a se@@ ating concept of the 195@@ 0s , when the average body size of the newly tr@@ aded aircraft was “ jet set ” .
it was , i said , airbus that carried out investigations that showed that the aircraft had an additional customs duty ( 2.@@ 5@@ 4 cm ) per seat .
bo@@ eing 7@@ 47 is a new generation of its airbus fleet , with a total of 2@@ 40 aircraft being sold in the united states .
the company decla@@ res that it is also aware of the experience on the aircraft from more than the se@@ ating width .
“ it runs really well to make flight book@@ ings more flexible , so that they can do what they want to do .
you want to be able to use dis@@ clo@@ sures that you can make prof@@ itable .
you know your business better than any other .
for airlines , the issue is more el@@ bo@@ w sh@@ ell@@ s , but for manufacturers it will increasingly be a problem for the airlines .
behind the confron@@ tation is a race for aircraft engines , with a estimated 2@@ ,000 tons of aircraft .
as re@@ u@@ ters announced in july , the us government is now in a position to increase the number of seats available in the us .
both airbus and the euro@@ cop@@ ter have claimed 20 percent more efficiency per seat than in its latest two-@@ engine aircraft .
the statements offered by bo@@ eing on the results are partly dependent on the fact that the 7@@ 7@@ 7@@ x is sitting in the same row with its original design of nine seats in the 7@@ 77 .
the ge@@ st@@ ures of the cost per unit are still lower than the current machines with ten seats per row .
“ bo@@ eing ” is a very popular product , and the company is also a major player in the global aero@@ space industry .
on the other hand , analy@@ sts say that full cab@@ ins with ten seats per row can be used with 7@@ 7@@ 7@@ s indicated that many passengers would be interested in closer align@@ ment , which would be possible with cheaper air fa@@ res .
“ ax@@ is of the z@@ ol@@ l se@@ ating width would be great for passengers , but the reality is : from a commercial point of view , the airbus a3@@ 20 offer is very different from the threat posed by the 7@@ 77 . ” , says mar@@ y mar@@ y .
airbus is a major player in the global market .
the world order of je@@ t-@@ ver@@ k@@ au@@ f@@ s@@ pro@@ du@@ k@@ tion is even making itself a be@@ ac@@ on in order to measure the equipment at the competition .
even if you have the comfort to pay , we offer all manufacturers the same je@@ ts with high compres@@ sion co@@ ating .
airbus is offering a a3@@ 50 with ten seats , which will be delivered in the near future , according to its own statement .
until recently , the airbus has stressed that the european union must be more adap@@ table to the needs of some je@@ ts and that it must have broad seats on its cor@@ ners .
without the support of the only other manufacturer of large modern jet , experts say that the reputation for a new brand name is probably a pu@@ pp@@ y that will be pur@@ ged , but from the wave of 7@@ 7@@ 7@@ x sales .
new anti-@@ nit@@ ro@@ gen o@@ xide vacc@@ ine could help the pleasure of smoking to keep the skin smo@@ ke .
scientists have a anti-@@ nit@@ ro@@ gen test that is based on the latest scientific findings .
a single domain is a do@@ se of vacc@@ ine that could cause m@@ ice to be used for life .
before testing on humans , many other tests are needed , which may take some years to come , but professor ron@@ ald c@@ ry@@ sta@@ l of the whe@@ at cor@@ n@@ ell medical college is in new york .
“ we are very hope@@ ful that the next generation of this kind of vacc@@ ine strategy will be able to help millions of smo@@ kers who have tried to stop smoking while keeping all the methods available on the market .
the new import ban on vacc@@ ines contains a harm@@ less virus that is modified to prevent the spread of gene@@ tically modified information .
the virus inf@@ ected the system selec@@ tively , but it does not have a permanent stream of inf@@ ec@@ tions .
the an@@ tics of the jack@@ et hun@@ t the nic@@ ot@@ ine mo@@ lec@@ ules in the blood and neutr@@ alize the ner@@ vous system before they reach the brain .
in attempts to do so , vacc@@ inated m@@ ice had been kept in place to prevent the spread of their normal activities .
m@@ ice , without vacc@@ ination , would have a “ break out ” that would have explained the researchers who had a sign that the disease was not caused by the nic@@ ot@@ ine .
the experim@@ ents are in the fac@@ sim@@ ile science trans@@ la@@ tional medicine ( fac@@ h@@ bl@@ at@@ t ) .
previous versions of tobacco vacc@@ ines suggested that there was no risk of inf@@ ection with anti@@ bodies .
the import of vacc@@ ines had to be carried out in order to maintain the anti@@ body pe@@ el .
but the cost of the new vacc@@ ine is not likely to be much lower , because it trans@@ forms li@@ ver cells into anti@@ bodies .
as professor her@@ man said , the european union could be a future im@@ mun@@ e to human beings if it is safe .
more likely , however , is that smo@@ kers will use it to stop smoking .
“ you know then : if you are going to start smoking again , you feel the pain of smoking because of the nic@@ ot@@ ine vacc@@ ine .
british scientists said that the results were interesting , but war@@ ned at the same time that there was still a need for further research .
tri@@ po@@ di is den@@ ying that it is not a matter of influence on the part of o@@ be@@ id , but of the fact that it has been influenced by o@@ be@@ id .
the commission has not yet been able to take any action against the former minister of labour party jo@@ e tri@@ po@@ di from new south wal@@ es .
the former n@@ s@@ w minister , however , den@@ ies that the rules on maritime surveillance have been extended to cover maritime shipping at the request of his political ment@@ or ed@@ die o@@ be@@ id , who has been involved in three main sites at state@@ -@@ controlled level .
the in@@ dem@@ n@@ ity of the commission is a member of the european parliament .
now , because of the acc@@ us@@ ation that the tri@@ po@@ di has been ab@@ duc@@ ted by o@@ be@@ id &apos;s hidden interest in the property , the tri@@ po@@ di is now being investig@@ ated .
in years of experience , i have had a lot of discussions in 2005 , the government has respon@@ ded to calls for ten@@ der for ten@@ der contracts .
the pass@@ ports were , however , opposed and wanted to be longer .
in 2009 , the le@@ ase contracts for the companies at the cir@@ cu@@ lar qu@@ ay , which were awarded the above mentioned 2.5 million dollars a year , were suspended without any public ten@@ der .
tri@@ po@@ di , the most important european producer of high quality , has been awarded the title of &quot; best ship of the year &quot; by the ministry of the port from february 2006 to november 2009 .
but he would not be able to make changes at the request of o@@ be@@ id .
a key issue in ic@@ ac is that the commission has been able to make a phone call from august to september 2007 between o@@ be@@ id , tri@@ po@@ di and ste@@ ve dun@@ n , a senior official who has been transferred to the port ministry .
“ was the same in these telephone conver@@ sa@@ tions ?
“ no , ” he rep@@ lied , “ tri@@ po@@ di .
i can only apo@@ log@@ ise for what was discussed , but that was what was definitely not .

israeli leaders are now in a position to attack the goal in syria .
israeli leaders hun@@ ting aircraft would have been allowed to leave on thursday night in the sy@@ ri@@ an port of lac@@ ak@@ ia , but confirmed a leading government official to fo@@ x news .
the official of the commission explained not that it was intended to be a member of the commission , but said that it was at least one .
according to associ@@ ates press , the number of the press was about russian sa@@ -@@ 12@@ 5-@@ r@@ aci@@ al ro@@ c@@ kets .
at least twice a year , israel has already made air stri@@ kes on missi@@ le supplies in syria .
foreign workers with 4@@ 5.@@ 7 visa are likely to be “ real ” testing .
the government is thinking about extending the scope of a “ real ” fund to cover all the foreign workers with 4@@ 5@@ 7-@@ vis@@ as .
if the test is to be introduced , it would have a criteri@@ on for using the same criteria , which would prevent the 4@@ 57 being used to occup@@ y un@@ qualified jobs or as a back@@ door for the influ@@ x of family and friends to australia .
today , a discussion forum was held in which the government had announced that the former labour government member , mr ma@@ xi@@ ine m@@ ck@@ en@@ e@@ v , had taken note of the government &apos;s comments on foreign workers because they were not accepted by austr@@ ali@@ ans .
“ lou@@ dly declarations like that , foreign@@ ers should be able to stand up at the back ” and , if austr@@ ali@@ ans are to stop at the front , a very un@@ pleasant re@@ treat in times when trade unions demanded a protected labour market ” .
histor@@ ically , hi@@ st@@ ori@@ ans have said that white workers are protected , and that is when some in the region have a reaction to this historic ar@@ te@@ fact , they are not .
the draft discussion is about the future of the european union and about the future of europe .
immigrants are not bur@@ dan o &apos;@@ con@@ nor , who is here yesterday for talks on trafficking in human beings in s@@ ri lan@@ ka , but the european union has five of the proposed amendments , which other people will have to consider .
if the “ e@@ tw@@ in@@ ning criteri@@ on ” is taken over , then someone who has a visa could be able to apply for it to see whether the “ real ” application is in the case where the visa is issued .
companies could also be obliged to provide an account of the number of 4@@ 5@@ 7-@@ vis@@ as holders who have been issued in the past , when companies that initially had only a small number of workers were forced to give their support .

from the british government , a study has been announced that will assess the benefits of h@@ s@@ 2 rail for scotland .
in the work of h@@ s@@ 2 ltd . , it is proposed to start work on the new h@@ s@@ 2 standard by 20@@ 26 .
traffic mini@@ ster@@ ial bar@@ on@@ ess k@@ ram@@ er said that the project “ will bring great britain closer together ” .
the scot@@ tish transport minister , ke@@ ith brown , stated that he was very pleased to be able to participate in this plan with the british government .
phase 1 consists of a new high-@@ speed line , which is between london and the west mid@@ lands .
after the completion of phase 2 , there will be connections to man@@ ch@@ ester and le@@ eds .
in june , the commission correc@@ ted the estimated cost of the war in iraq , which was estimated to be about $ 1 billion .
the british government , which has been in talks with transport scot@@ land , has been using h@@ s@@ 2 ltd to develop a new line for the transport of scot@@ land .
this includes the possibility of a travel time of at least three hours or less from gl@@ as@@ go@@ w and ed@@ in@@ burgh to london .
bar@@ on@@ ess kra@@ mer said : ‘ our goal for dogs is to be a truly national product .
we are going to the new h@@ s@@ 2 because it is a huge advantage .
without it , we face a capacity crisis .
but it is also about the link between 18 british cities , including gl@@ as@@ go@@ w and ed@@ in@@ burgh , which , thanks to h@@ s@@ 2 , will be improved .
the scot@@ tish state secretary , mr al@@ st@@ air car@@ michael , comm@@ ented : “ today &apos;s announcement is a good news for scotland &apos;s future . ”
in the name of the scot@@ tish government , ke@@ ith brown car@@ michael called on the eu to be ‘ un@@ equi@@ vo@@ cal ’ in favour of scot@@ tish integration into the h@@ s@@ 2 network .
brown is said : “ the wedding of the high-@@ speed rail link carri@@ es the potential of enormous economic benefits for scotland .
that is why we are pleased to be able to be a partner of the british government and to make the options for a high-@@ speed rail link in scotland available , which will bring benefits to everyone and facilitate the connection between gl@@ as@@ go@@ w ed@@ in@@ burgh , the government .
i am pleased to see that the committee of inquiry is in place with the british ministers next year and that it is going to decide together what next steps are to be taken .
regulations on electronic equipment in aircraft and the rules on the electronic equipment remain in force in australia for the time being .
austr@@ ali@@ an airlines fly to australia from the united states to australia , and must continue to use tab@@ lets and smar@@ t@@ phones when the flight is started and lan@@ ded , despite efforts in the us to relax the rules on such equipment .
the us government has been using the us air force ( fa@@ a ) to provide us airlines with their requirements .
during the great part of the flight , pass@@ age is not already allowed , but you will find it an@@ no@@ ying that the passenger is allowed to travel on the start and lan@@ ding .
austr@@ ali@@ an companies are watching the decision to sell their products to us airlines .
the airlines are responsible for the safety of their passengers , as well as for the fact that they are going to look at the announcement , but they have stressed that restrictions on the use of electronic equipment in critical flight ph@@ ases in australia are still valid .
“ the ca@@ fe@@ ter@@ ia has no specific regulations on the use of electronic equipment in the aircraft at the moment , ” said the president .
the issue of the subject is subject to rules that airlines must always maintain safety and that passengers must comply with the rules laid down by the cab@@ in crew .
vir@@ gin has already started to use the casa conver@@ sa@@ tions about extending its wi-fi network to include the internet .
“ we would like to see a review of the authorisation of electronic devices by casa , because we are convinced that the latter is the customer ’ s experience , after we have now ( wireless ) been able to access the data during the flight . ” said .
q@@ an@@ t@@ as explained that it will be possible to stay in the current rules until further notice .
“ our current policies provide for the commission to use electronic devices when the start and lan@@ ding are not used , and we currently have no plans to do so . ” he stated .
the facts of the fa@@ a are valid for us airlines .
we are , however , always interested in developments in regulations that affect passengers .
the decision has a negative impact on us companies depending on the age of the fleet .
you must veri@@ fy that you have been able to detec@@ t the wireless inter@@ ference from mobile devices and that you have received manu@@ als , training materials , hand luggage programmes and customer instruc@@ tion .
“ after a flight company has reduced tolerance of its fleet , we can now offer passengers a free use of port@@ able , electronic and electronic equipment such as tab@@ lets , e-@@ books and other devices .
in rare cases , the patient may be treated with a di@@ et of the same size as the passenger is lan@@ ded .
the group recomm@@ ends that the commission should be able to detec@@ t more heavy equipment at the start and lan@@ ding safe@@ ly under the seat or in the subjects over the seats .
before the re@@ treat , you can take a walk along the river and take a boat to the nearby town of sch@@ al@@ ke .

nevertheless , the european parliament has p@@ raised the government for having respon@@ ded to its request for urgent aid , which it initially sent to the prime minister at the beginning of may .
“ i am confident that the new generation of german aid will make a major contribution to improving public health systems in the federal state from the point of view of concern , ” said wil@@ ki@@ e .
according to the government of the state , these bal@@ lot payments are largely financed by the cuts that have been made recently .

the hotel is also announced on thursday that a sy@@ ri@@ an group of activi@@ sts announced that more than 1@@ 20@@ ,000 people have died since the civil war began three years ago .
the announcement of the organization for the ban@@ ning of chemical weapons ( op@@ c@@ w ) came a day before the date on 1 january .
1. november , the first day of the conference of the parties to the h@@ ague , the dam@@ as@@ c@@ us , was set up to provide all the facilities for the manufacture of chemical weapons or to prevent &quot; in@@ operative &quot; , including all the machinery for the mix@@ ing of f@@ ti chemicals .
the conclusion of this process , which is essentially a matter of the first stage of destruction , is an important mil@@ est@@ one in an ambitious era of the tim@@ esc@@ ale that aims to destroy all chemical weapons .
the destruction of the facilities means that syria is not new chemical weapons .
d@@ am@@ as@@ c@@ us , however , still needs to begin to use the existing weapons and supplies to destroy them .
an@@ ec@@ d@@ ot@@ al as@@ sump@@ tions are that there are about 1@@ ,000 tonnes of chemicals and weapons in the country , including sen@@ f@@ gas and ner@@ vous sar@@ in .
the announcement of the release came at a time when the fight was being fought in the city of sa@@ fir@@ a , from which experts say that there was a production facility for chemical weapons .
the acti@@ vis@@ t group , which has a network of activi@@ sts in syria , has reduced the number of deaths , declared on thursday , 1@@ 20@@ .@@ 2@@ 96 people were dead .
this is expected to be 6@@ 1.@@ 0@@ 67 civili@@ ans , including 6@@ ,@@ 3@@ 65 children .
on the part of the government , 2@@ 9.@@ 9@@ 54 of them were members of the army of president bas@@ ha@@ r as@@ sad , 18@@ ,@@ 6@@ 78 were govern@@ ment@@ -@@ friendly figh@@ ters and 18@@ 7 leban@@ ese he@@ z@@ bol@@ lah mil@@ i@@ ti@@ as .
the commission also has a number of wor@@ ries about the future of the military , including the fact that the military has been forced to close down the country .
on 25 july , the us estimated the number of deaths in the country , from march 2011 , to 10@@ 0,000 .
this figure was not even updated .
the conflict has caused about two million people to fle@@ e the country .
as@@ sa@@ ds ’ troops have been fighting for weeks in sa@@ fir@@ a against the re@@ be@@ ls , many of which have links with al-@@ q@@ a@@ ed@@ a groups .
the observation mission is said to be having a very serious losses on both sides on thursday , but no details were mentioned .
the fighting has under@@ lined the danger of the chemical industry becoming a source of conflict , because its mission to liber@@ ate syria is a very important one .
after the commission &apos;s statement on the o@@ ec@@ d , which is closely co@@ operating with the united nations , the team “ now convinced that it will all be able to achieve the important production and mix@@ ing facilities mentioned by syria and to destroy them . ”
that is why “ no further inspec@@ tions are currently planned ” .
in the beginning of the week , the inspec@@ tors stated that they had signed the first round of checks and that 21 out of 23 of the inspec@@ tors were visiting dam@@ as@@ c@@ us .
because of security concerns , the visit of two institutions is not possible , the inspec@@ tors said .
on thursday , the opposition declared that the two sites had been closed down according to sy@@ ri@@ an saying , “ and the sites there were of the chemical weapons program . ”
it was not immediately clear what the commission &apos;s place was in sa@@ fir@@ a , one of the two institutions that had the op@@ c@@ w inspec@@ tors .
sy@@ ri@@ an society has developed a plan for the complete destruction of its chemical weapons , which will be approved by the executive committee of the op@@ wc next month .
“ i quote : “ i prefer the hat before the bra@@ very and courage to the courage that you all have shown in ful@@ filling the most challenging mission ever undertaken by this organisation .

fa@@ a : airport passengers can now use electronic devices in aircraft .
flu@@ c@@ tu@@ ates in the range of 30 to 60 km .
but we should not allow passengers to expect that they will be implemented immediately .
as soon as you implement it , you will be left to the airline concerned , mr fa@@ a said , michael hu@@ er@@ ta , at a press conference .
the airlines are obliged to comply with the fa@@ a , that aircraft comply with the new directives and that they comply with the training manu@@ als of the flight personnel and the rules for the du@@ sting of equipment in accordance with the new rules .
the facts of the fa@@ a stated that it has already received plans from some airlines that are proposing to use sustainable electronic equipment in aircraft .
under these airlines , the airlines were also del@@ ta and j@@ et@@ blue .
“ the number of participants is limited , depending on the state of the plan .
at present , passengers must be able to use smart phones , tab@@ lets and other devices to switch off when the aircraft doors are closed .
you may not use them again until you have the aircraft in your hand at a height of three kilometres and the captain has been given the green light .
the entrance to the national park is free of charge for passengers .
after the new directives , airlines could be allowed to fly in the event of electronic dis@@ rup@@ tions .
the majority of new transport aircraft and other aircraft are now in service with a cost of up to eur 1 million .
lau@@ ra gla@@ ding , president of the association of professional photograph@@ ers , is a member of the international association of professional aviation compan@@ i@@ es. he welcomed the changes .
“ if the new regulation is implemented safe@@ ly – and we are working closely with the airline in this respect – both sides will benefit from it , ” comm@@ ented gl@@ ad@@ ing .
we are the honest ones who are ti@@ red of being divided on this issue .
nevertheless , the internet connections to the internet remained un@@ changed , the exchange of e-@@ ma@@ ils , text messages or the downloading of data under three kilometres continued , explained the authority .
passengers who are required to use smart phones or smar@@ t@@ phones , tab@@ lets and other devices in flight mode .
so always have no “ word ” with friends .
and , more difficult devices such as lap@@ top@@ s must continue to be du@@ sty , as there is a vulner@@ ability here , if they are caused by the cab@@ in .
hand@@ ys@@ wa@@ p calls are free of charge .
the regul@@ ators &apos; competence in telephone calls is the federal government .
fa@@ a he@@ ats the risk of a ban on certain electronic devices when the vehicle is started and lan@@ ded .
last month , mark ro@@ sen@@ ker of the transport safety agency said that he was going to be a safety board , safety experts for national transport .
“ hand@@ y are really a problem , not only because they are potentially dangerous , but also because they are not really a problem for mobile phones .
a consulting firm with a view to the future of the company is the first step towards the study of this issue .
in the last few years , the pressure on the facts of the fa@@ a has increased , restrictions on the use of force have been lo@@ wered .
cri@@ tics like the democratic sen@@ ate party , cla@@ ire mc@@ ca@@ ke , have been accused of being a &quot; non-@@ state &quot; .
the restrictions on the use of the internet are becoming increasingly difficult to implement , because the use of equipment has become a reality .
in some studies , it is said that the european union has a population of up to one third of passengers who are po@@ is@@ oning or ign@@ oring the equipment .
the facts of the fa@@ a were published in 196@@ 6 , and the number of people who were travelling by air has been reported to have been reported to the fa@@ a on the inter@@ ference of navigation and communication equipment .
new aircraft are much more dependent on the electric and electronic systems than previous generations of air vehicles , but they are also so constructive that they are dependent on the fa@@ a to be able to offer electronic inter@@ ference .
airport airlines offer passengers a choice of services for a number of years , such as wi-fi , when the flight height is reached .
the countries that have joined wi-fi systems are now able to operate in a variety of ways , including the inter@@ fer@@ ons .
the overwhel@@ ming majority of the passengers in the aircraft should be responsible for the greater use of electronic equipment under the new directives , said hu@@ er@@ ta .
the current electronic devices give in general much less radio radi@@ ance than the previous ones .
e-@@ reader is a tool that allows you to easily create and edit your own documents .
but the download or send of data is not the transmission values .
the hotel is also a great place for those who advoc@@ ate a relaxation of restrictions on device use by passengers .
2011 , the company ’ s employees invited a passenger aircraft full of kin@@ dle e-@@ read@@ ers and made a test flight to test the problems that could be detec@@ ted , but were unable to find out .
members of the fa@@ a advisory committee are responsible for the information and consultation on the issue of the safety of the workers .
dou@@ gl@@ as kid@@ d from the passenger association national association of air transport ( n@@ ab@@ uc@@ co ) said he was the only person who felt that the dis@@ ru@@ ption was real , even if the risk was minimal .
other co@@ sm@@ ic com@@ ics said that there was no more than a few reports from pi@@ lo@@ tes , which were designed to prevent the aircraft from being damaged by the equipment .
the committee is responsible for the implementation of the fa@@ a , however , and recomm@@ ends that pil@@ ots be allowed to take part in the event of an instrument lan@@ ding under bad vi@@ sibility .
a group of people from the travel industry welcomed the changes and re@@ marked them as a reasonable adaptation to travellers , who are now more familiar with technology .
“ we are pleased to have the fa@@ a recogn@@ iz@@ es that a pleasant passenger transport experience is not in contradic@@ tion to safety , ” said ro@@ ger do@@ w , ceo of the u.s. travel agency .

is europe ’ s elite prepared to negotiate with britain ?
business for british air@@ ways was founded in april with the intention to develop the economy to a table .
the following amendments have been tabled to this effect , and we have the largest and most comprehensive survey among british econom@@ ists and asked them what they think of britain , the economy and the eu .
you@@ f@@ on is a free software application that allows you to create and manage your own projects .
the results of the survey will show many surpris@@ es .
we have found that the commission has not yet taken the view that the vast majority of companies are ex@@ porting outside europe and are concentrated on countries that are modern@@ ising and growing , while the states in the eu are stag@@ n@@ ating .
you want to see the commission &apos;s leaders take on new trade links with countries like china , india and brazil .
what is required in your view of certain legally regulated issues – from the car@@ tel law to the product legislation – is the majority of economic leaders of the opinion that control of these key competences should be transferred to west@@ min@@ ster .
it was clear that the commission was not prepared to accept the proposal for a directive on the internal market because companies said that the costs of the rules in brussels would now out@@ wei@@ gh the benefits .
finally , and this is probably the most important thing to say , our survey of economic leaders gave a clear indication that a clear majority was opposed by the united kingdom to a change in the agreement and a relationship with the eu based on trade .
this is a recognition that has been widely shared by companies of all sizes and by all major groups that the economy is moving towards a “ sensible change . ”
it is about much – a change in the agreement and better conditions for britain in terms of 16 % – to change their mind in favour of staying in the eu in a referendum .
the prime minister should be in no doubt : this survey shows that the british economy is lag@@ ging behind his plan for the new british conditions for eu membership .
you can also see that the companies are affected by a re@@ negotiation .
a better way to deal with the british economy is to make it possible and increasingly necessary to do so after the eurozone has moved towards closer integration of the economy and the fiscal union .
the priority must be jobs and growth in britain , as the result of our survey shows , what is good for businesses and what is good for the economy .

business leaders phil@@ li@@ p har@@ e was informed of a case that was not mentioned by a y@@ m@@ ca employee because of a breach of children &apos;s por@@ no@@ graphy .
har@@ ry said ga@@ il fur@@ ness , a leading european union assi@@ stant to the commission , said that he was not affected by the first case , which was the second .
he ad@@ mitted that the commission ’ s opening statement was not a good one to the commission .
be@@ ware of the commission , however , that the y@@ m@@ ca has been informed of the fact that it has been the second lowest assessment of four possible in a quality audit of the department .
har@@ ry , the author of the y@@ m@@ ca , started with 21 , acknowledged that the world ’ s management has “ been working on down@@ wards ” with the recru@@ it@@ ment of lord .
lord be@@ th@@ ell was a member of the united states army at the beginning of the year for sexual off@@ ences against 12 bo@@ ys during his two-@@ year career .
he was sent@@ enced to at least six years in prison .
har@@ ry stone is also a great place to start the y@@ m@@ ca .
the staff said from the outset that they had observed violations , including the fact that lor@@ d alone had to deal with children , they were priv@@ ately treated as bab@@ y@@ sit@@ ters , they were on his sho@@ ot , and they said that he was .
in the following years dani@@ elle oc@@ k@@ well , whose head lord was and was around a school , was a member of the united states &apos; association for the protection of children , because she was concerned about his behaviour .
the division ’ s managing director stated that he would not accept statements from employees that would not be d@@ ared to change their management report .
instead , it said , the commission has its friend@@ ship with lord their great@@ ness .
har@@ ry explained that he has given the board of directors of the y@@ m@@ ca n@@ s@@ w his opinion that the le@@ verage that is the organization &apos;s primary goal is to create a new business model .
har@@ ry said that the decision to make employees pay to sign contracts is a decision that is not taken soon after the acc@@ us@@ ations have been made .
he said that it should be used to prevent contam@@ ination of the evidence , which is ‘ excessive ’ .
the y@@ m@@ ca n@@ s@@ w is available in the time when j@@ ong@@ -@@ ath@@ an lord was elected to the parliament between 2009 and 2011 .

mil@@ d , cold and hot , cold and hot , but also cold , and the taste of the ve@@ gan is a deli@@ ght for all the eating of animal products .
what remains is the fact that the european union is not yet ready to take a closer look at the situation .
&quot; bro@@ t@@ au@@ stri@@ che &quot; are very popular &quot; , explains ute hen@@ kel@@ mann , who is a owner of the local bre@@ ed house , who has a variety of special products for ve@@ gan .
the re@@ u@@ ben are also visiting the shop in the do@@ ck@@ yard .
since 13 years , the ge@@ b@@ r has lived in new ze@@ al@@ and , in lam@@ pe@@ re@@ the@@ im , he finds ( almost ) everything he needs to live . &quot; 1997 , i put my di@@ et around and was vege@@ tari@@ ans &quot; .
to instantly trans@@ form the turn of the century , the next step was taken and i was ve@@ gan .
&quot; the convic@@ tion came not only because of the di@@ et , but because of the choice of shoes , &quot; says pro@@ c@@ tor , the plastic leather normal leather .
he recognized that the problem is also in other everyday situations .
in the first place , ve@@ gan is an eth@@ ics .
&quot; i want to not see animals being sold to me &quot; , says pro@@ c@@ tor &apos;s ma@@ xi@@ m of ve@@ gan , which is based on the entire consumption behavior .
instead of bur@@ gers , sti@@ r@@ ring e@@ gg@@ s or rubber bu@@ bb@@ les , they are now being sold to the ve@@ gan quickly .
&quot; it is a double success bonus &quot; , says pro@@ c@@ tor today , &quot; indeed , ve@@ gan does not make his wai@@ ver , no as@@ c@@ ese , but it is a en@@ rich@@ ment &quot; .
and that is precisely the condition that has been imposed on some people .
&quot; the su@@ ch@@ t@@ factor is a very important factor , which many people can quickly aband@@ on , similar to smoking &quot; , says pro@@ c@@ tor .
and turn a : &quot; certain failed &quot; cre@@ atures are not interested in the animal .
often , it is the sp@@ ices or the kind of ingredients that are used to produce the flav@@ our .
&quot; you can also use the other way to get the same effect &quot; , explains the author .
the hotel is situated in the heart of the city , near the famous champ@@ ag@@ ne and the famous champ@@ ag@@ ne market .
he respects the need for a balanced , varied and nutri@@ tious di@@ et , which is also a dis@@ crete di@@ et .
of course , there is a desire to have something between the te@@ eth .
&quot; it should be tas@@ teful , but the thing is not only on animal food .
health problems are still a problem , including eating dis@@ orders , further widespread as@@ sumption .
for me , the um@@ bre@@ lla organisation was a positive aspect of the change@@ over .
i take no str@@ an@@ ger ch@@ ol@@ era , but i have a higher risk of vit@@ am@@ in .
it is highly competitive , and it is not just a question of vege@@ t@@ arian food .
&quot; my blood values are beyond me , i leave them to be che@@ ated &quot; , ver@@ r@@ ä@@ t proc@@ tor .
in particular , against the lack of vit@@ am@@ in b@@ 12 , many ve@@ gan sim@@ ulation cri@@ tics war@@ n .
&quot; since animals are fed with feed@@ ing@@ stuffs , we must not be afraid of the pa@@ st@@ ure , &quot; he asked .
for vege@@ tari@@ ans , i have also seen the possibility of using the co@@ en@@ zy@@ me in the form of tab@@ lets .
&quot; my leg@@ o b@@ 12 values are ok &quot; , explains dr. j@@ . h@@ . h@@ . h@@ . h@@ . h@@ . h@@ . h@@ . h@@ . h@@ . h@@ . h@@ . h@@ . h@@ . h@@ . h@@ . h@@ . h@@ .
wide paths should be taken by pro@@ c@@ tor to obtain food .
the main food is available in all parts of the world , and every super@@ market has now grown to include so@@ ya milk and other products .
all that is missing is a simple , simple and in@@ tu@@ i@@ tive interface .
only from time to time do i buy something special .
&quot; many people think that the only way to achieve this is to pay for the finished products , but that is the case with &quot; ordinary &quot; finished products .
in any case , the allocation of the vege@@ table prote@@ ins is far more favourable and less time@@ -@@ consum@@ ing than the common practice .
&quot; in the house kitchen there are lots to discover , with a few small cu@@ t@@ l@@ ery you can enjoy good , if not some better , results &quot; says prof@@ tor .
mar@@ gare@@ ine instead of but@@ ter , a little more ba@@ king pow@@ der and carbon ac@@ id instead of eg@@ g , with its ve@@ gan cheese ca@@ ke , proc@@ tor could also have sold his si@@ ster parents to ast@@ on@@ ish .
family celebra@@ tions give the ve@@ gan a special atmosphere .
the result is dynamic , if you co@@ ok together , the bo@@ il has a new value .
&quot; the situations that we are creating are not necessarily so different from the people themselves &quot; , says pro@@ c@@ tor .
of course , he was already s@@ cep@@ tical about the matter .
sch@@ me@@ hl sie di@@ r me@@ in ess@@ en nicht me@@ ine ess@@ en ?
&quot; should i register now badly ?
&quot; i reject the idea of people not being able to do anything about it , &quot; i would like to say to mr pro@@ c@@ tor that there is no deadline for en@@ ac@@ tment .
and , more specifically , the daily world appears to be less vege@@ t@@ arian than the pre@@ sumed – and the vege@@ t@@ arian is not as much in everyday life as common .
the city of al@@ ic@@ ante is also a popular destination for outdoor activities .
po@@ m@@ mes is also a place where you can find everything you need !
&quot; many d@@ ö@@ ner &apos;s shops offer false food and are not allowed to buy a vege@@ t@@ arian y@@ u@@ f@@ ka , &quot; says prof@@ tor .
in a pi@@ zz@@ ling piz@@ zer@@ ia , he is on pa@@ sta dishes , or orders a small piz@@ za without cheese .
the restaurants are located in the area , so slowly .
&quot; when i was in the company 13 years ago , i was a ve@@ gan , i was still a lot more difficult , &quot; he said .
&quot; if enough evidence of en@@ qui@@ ries come , they may be inc@@ lined to consider the menu .
ve@@ gan@@ e restaurants develop into a real paradise for the lovers of the com@@ b in man@@ n@@ heim or the bird café .
pro@@ c@@ tor has the desire to make the same thing happen to other restaurants as well .
in fact , the vege@@ table prote@@ ins are the same for everyone .
each can be ea@@ ten , they are therefore exactly the opposite of exclusive .
&quot; meat dishes are , however , exclusive and not in the tru@@ est sense of the word , because they exclu@@ de others , &quot; pro@@ c@@ tor states .
&quot; if you want to avoid food scand@@ als , you have to be ve@@ gan .
the purch@@ aser will be able to buy ve@@ gan products at the beginning .
in particular , if we learn to understand the meaning of the word &quot; animal &quot; in stra@@ w@@ ber@@ ries , it is not clear that the use of these addi@@ tives is not compatible with the ethical principles of so many hur@@ d@@ les and quickly falls .
not only because of this , re@@ u@@ ben proc@@ tor and lars th@@ om@@ sen have written a book : &quot; ve@@ gan@@ is@@ sim@@ o - animal ingredients - animal ingredients and their alternatives &quot; explains the many ingredients that are food and animal products .
&quot; after and after , one develops a scan@@ ner look and knows where the characters and lo@@ gos are to be respected &quot; it is sometimes better to take small steps than to ste@@ al .
the ve@@ gan lifestyle , it is a major moral and spiritual fing@@ er , and it is based on awareness .
perhaps the council will not be able to make its hab@@ its clear .

first i had the us investment bank gol@@ d@@ man s@@ ach@@ s because of technical problems with the purchase of goods that had been largely fla@@ wed to the options markets .
the commission then needed a clear statement from the stock exchange operators almost a whole day to make the order brow@@ se and delete it .
two days later , the half of the total stock trading in the us came to the end of the year because of a computer cr@@ ash on the nas@@ da@@ q stock exchange .

tax on foreign real estate owners against london &apos;s spec@@ u@@ lative bu@@ b@@ ble
the financial ministry has provided provi@@ sional information on the c@@ g@@ t measure .
the commission is already exce@@ eding the revenue from the st@@ amp tax on housing property in the districts of west@@ min@@ ster and ken@@ sing@@ ton &amp; ch@@ el@@ sea , which is to be increased by eur 1 billion in tax year 2012 / 13 .
co@@ ok said : “ after the increases , the commission is now at the point of raising the rate of high-@@ value housing and the introduction of the associated legislation against a le@@ ak@@ age , high-quality real estate is too low . ”
“ yet this step could take some foreign investors more cau@@ tious , which would make the purchase of property in london , or the owner of it .
first-@@ class properties – the top property companies in the world are five to ten percent of the housing market at the price of the weal@@ thy sou@@ th@@ west bel@@ t , which is surrounded by ful@@ ham to w@@ im@@ ble@@ don .

you are taking the heart rate of the four-@@ leg@@ ged and analy@@ zed the behavior .
it is likely that we will soon understand why the co@@ ck is getting into one , sometimes in the other .
professor of the university of applied sciences , professor v@@ all@@ or@@ ti@@ gar@@ a said : “ we have shown dogs – either a natural , a healthy version or a sil@@ hou@@ ette to be di@@ str@@ acting other aspects .
if the animals are watching , how a otherwise explo@@ ited animal is being killed by a man who is not able to take the co@@ ck ( from the perspective of the we@@ aring dog ) , the animals remained completely relaxed .
was it the pregn@@ ancy of the woman that was mainly left ( again from the perspective of the dog , the weather ) ?
after the commission has presented its opinion , professor v@@ all@@ or@@ ti@@ gar@@ a is not inter@@ fer@@ ing inten@@ tionally with each other through these movements .
he is , on the contrary , convinced that the dogs have learned from experience , in which movements they have to worry and when they are not .
he said : “ if you want to meet different people in different ways and the weather is good , you can have a di@@ p in one direction rather than a friendly one and you have to have a less friendly attitude on the right side .
the formula for the research is that the findings are hun@@ de@@ wo@@ h@@ ner , veter@@ in@@ arians and tra@@ in@@ ers that will help to improve the understanding of the emo@@ tions of your animal .
john br@@ ad@@ sha@@ w , expert in the field of dog behavior and host bre@@ eding , has been working on the fac@@ ul@@ ty of animal health at the university of bri@@ st@@ ol .
the last year , a team of the university of l@@ inc@@ ol@@ n found that dogs had to leave their head to the left when they had an aggres@@ sive dog .
in a different research work on the university of vic@@ tre@@ oria in canada , the following was : “ dogs go more towards a robo@@ t dog than a dog when his dog is pregn@@ ant . ”
according to him , the differences could therefore arise because the us government ’ s dogs were not allowed to eat animals in the films or the robo@@ ts ’ dogs .
a study that was carried out on how dogs were to react to real dogs could help .
“ while there are considerable differences in the number of different m@@ am@@ m@@ als that the two have been affected , the two brain hal@@ ves are not yet known to many of the details .
as the country &apos;s behavior is simply emerging , it is likely that the country will not be long before we understand why the war on the co@@ ck sometimes turns into one , sometimes into the other .

pa@@ p@@ st fran@@ z@@ is@@ k@@ us appointed the president of the republic of croatia in february .
pa@@ p@@ st fran@@ z@@ is@@ k@@ us will be in the new car@@ din@@ al rooms of the catho@@ lic church for the first time on february 22 , as the v@@ ati@@ can announced on thursday .
kar@@ din@@ a@@ o@@ ke are the most important mon@@ astic mon@@ ks in the catho@@ lic church after the po@@ pe .
at present , there are 20@@ 1 car@@ din@@ als .
however , a car@@ din@@ al , who is an old 80 years old , can not be returned to the po@@ pe &apos;s election – that is , a group of 120 “ elec@@ tor@@ ate eligible car@@ din@@ als ” .
in a statement issued by the commission on 11 september , the president of the european parliament , pat@@ er feder@@ ico l@@ om@@ bar@@ di , said that the united states is going to meet all the car@@ din@@ als .
“ pas@@ cal lam@@ bert ” is a great leader in the history of the church of st. john , and his decision to conven@@ e the con@@ si@@ st@@ ori@@ um in february to make it known to other meetings that would facilitate the participation of car@@ din@@ als from all over the world .
j@@ ack val@@ er@@ o of cat@@ ho@@ lic vo@@ ip is saying that the most important thing is that the number of people entitled to vote is probably falling by february .
he explained that a package of the nom@@ ine@@ es normally ap@@ points as many car@@ din@@ als as necessary to ensure that the number of eligible voters is reduced .
the con@@ si@@ st@@ ori@@ um next year is therefore important .
at the moment , there is a certain over@@ la@@ p on the part of europe and , in particular , italy .
“ it will be interesting to see how the market is growing faster than the new po@@ pe ’ s car@@ din@@ als from the rest of the world .
four@@ ty per cent of ca@@ th@@ ol@@ ics live in south america , but they have only a tiny minority .
the car@@ din@@ als of the car@@ din@@ als will be the first to be held since the formation of the church founded by francis@@ co .
in the past , the council of europe ’ s po@@ pe decided everything alone .
“ now the french have a great deal of experience in the eight car@@ din@@ als that help him , ” said val@@ er@@ o .
he explained that there is “ good possibility ” that the french and the dutch would not be able to get advice .
but , so far , we have not been able – all of this is new .
val@@ er@@ o said that the typical use of the bi@@ ble is that of large places , and that the bis@@ ho@@ ps are called to car@@ din@@ als , but fran@@ z@@ is@@ c@@ us is “ full of surpris@@ es – we do not know who he is appointed . ”

in some of the cars , there may be a def@@ ect in the mechanism for with@@ drawing the front seat back@@ rest .
for this reason , they do not meet the federal guidelines for vehicle safety for head@@ re@@ sts .
“ if we talk about the problem of the car from the back , it is possible that the head re@@ stra@@ int will not affect the passengers correctly , so that an increased risk of in@@ jury is present ” , was reported on the website of the national police .

the des@@ pair of the people of the us is a des@@ pair of a obama elec@@ tor@@ ate .
i have listened carefully to president obama twice in the hope that the change will be possible .
he says that obama has lost p@@ raise for his efforts to improve the security of the us government ’ s bloc@@ k@@ ade tac@@ tics .
the bloc@@ king policy exc@@ use not the web@@ si@@ te-@@ problems of ob@@ am@@ ac@@ are , which threat@@ ens to attack the web .
obama ’ s mem@@ o@@ irs of the election campaign in 2008 were a sad remin@@ der of the things that can have been done .
na@@ than@@ a@@ el ner@@ o@@ sa , the founder of the university of min@@ n@@ es@@ ot@@ a , was a student at har@@ v@@ ard medical school in the second year of the year .
i read the report that there is a terrible s@@ ad@@ ness .
it is a book that i know from .
it is called the author of the book “ the aud@@ acity to win ” .
if i am in the evening with my patient &apos;s sign@@ atures and i am going to bed , then i am going back to a time when the politics of inspir@@ ing millions and giving a speech a bre@@ ath of bre@@ ath .
the choice was made at a lands@@ li@@ de victory and news cen@@ sor@@ ship .
my piano lessons are not only we@@ aring joy and my parents collec@@ tively gathered all the newspapers that they find .
a young and dynamic team of vi@@ sion@@ aries was on the way to the white house and the nation was ready for change .
as a result of that , when obama took office in 2008 , he had received approval rat@@ ings of 82 % .
and then i join the house of comm@@ ons .
once again , switch to the present is a evil .
it is hard to imagine the same optim@@ istic times .
in the years that have passed since i first voted , i have seen a real change .
but it is simply nothing to do with the fact that the commission is not in a position to do anything .
i recognise that the great efforts made by the european parliament have been great and varied , but i would like to say that the adoption of the &apos; adult care act &apos; is a step in the right direction , from the point of view of the iraqi people .
the commission is also of the opinion that the party political bloc@@ k@@ ade tac@@ tics are too many to be abandoned .
but , having spent countless times on the obama administration ’ s colleagues and acqu@@ a@@ int@@ ances , i am very satisfied with my explanation attempts .
i have received one point of political des@@ pair .
the republic@@ an bloc@@ k@@ ade can no longer explain why it should be possible to stop the inter@@ ro@@ gation of foreign heads of state or to stop the killing of inno@@ cent children by dr@@ ones in over@@ seas .
it can not explain why the commission has not yet adopted the national security agency data on private life of americans .
it can not explain why the commission has not been allowed to visit an@@ war al-@@ aw@@ la@@ ki , an american citizen , without trial , and why the public funding and development funds are being cut during the presidential election .
it justi@@ fies not the results of a report which states that the european union &apos;s efforts to combat climate change are being under@@ min@@ ed by the &apos; aggres@@ sive &apos; ... since the ni@@ x@@ on government .
and , more recently , it cannot be the inc@@ ap@@ acity to live in the more than three years since the adoption of the aff@@ or@@ d@@ able care act .
i know not , but i am sure that the commissioner will be able to do so .
whether i am at 18 , i would have been able to understand that government work is not going to contradic@@ t your previous political campaigns .
obviously , the statute of members is not a predic@@ table course , as an opposition party is not a party and inci@@ dental events like the new@@ to@@ w@@ n mass@@ ac@@ re have pre@@ cip@@ it@@ ated public debate .
but if i look at the above examples , i see that the two are largely separated from the government itself .
and that does not bo@@ ther me most .
i have 20@@ 12 again obama , but not because i am talking about his candi@@ d@@ acy , but because i am a president .
lunch is served from 12 : 00 to 14 : 00 .
i had the impression that a second term of office for obama , free of pressure from future elections , would give hope that he would be able to continue to use his term .
but , with the fall in the approval rat@@ ings for obama on less than 45 % this week , the return to 2008 has been replaced by this book even more severe .
it is a source of hope for me that the european union will be able to deliver on the many promises it has made .
this week i read a section in the book that explains how to use the term obama has lost a serious loss to clin@@ ton in the pre-@@ election in pen@@ n@@ sy@@ l@@ v@@ ania .
in a meeting with the election workers , following the decision , he said to his staff that they would have to go back to the course and follow the purpose of their cause .
“ i want you to be able to enjoy our magic ” , said he .
we must be remin@@ ded that who we are .
it is five years later , mr president , that we have to make a decision .

the travel company exp@@ ects to be able to profit from a adjusted annual profit from the tax between 3@@ 25 and 3@@ 40 million dollars , compared to $ 30@@ 5 to 3@@ 15 million in its previous forec@@ ast .
if the current target values are to be achieved , that means growth of 12 to 17 % in comparison with the record level of the 2@@ 9@@ 0.@@ 4 million dollars in the period 2011 / 12 .
as business leaders gra@@ ham tur@@ ner are aware , the group achieved a record level of sales of eight percent in the first half of the year and recorded a strong start in the second half , especially in austr@@ ali@@ an and british private operations .
“ since the beginning of the year , our ten countries have been prof@@ itable and some are in a good position to go down record year income before interest and taxes , ” he stated .
this includes australia and britain , which typically have a large share of the ear@@ nings .

joh@@ anna ra@@ hn@@ er wants to be present in the forum of the question as to how people today can see the &quot; last things &quot; after death .
if the people of the last few centuries had been too much of it and had been waiting for the images of heav@@ en and hel@@ l that were &quot; our ideas to date &quot; , then i draw on the contemporary art of pro@@ ph@@ es@@ y .

meanwhile , the world ’ s largest and most important trade fair for the food industry , the international trade fair for the food and be@@ verage industry , will be held in the city from june to september .
dr. geor@@ ges b@@ wel@@ le brings free medical assistance to remote areas .
b@@ wel@@ le and his team spend almost every weekend in making hundreds of patients .
in the western african country , there are not many doctors who are only one for 5@@ ,000 people .
do you agree , or do you agree with your mobile device ?
dr. geor@@ ges b@@ wel@@ le is one of the top 10 of the &quot; c@@ n@@ n her@@ oes of 2013 &quot; .
you can use the same name for him or any of the other her@@ oes in the top 10 to make him a &quot; c@@ n@@ n her@@ o of the year &quot; .
the winner of the prize is $ 25@@ 0,000 to continue his extraordinary work .
21 years of the world saw geor@@ ges b@@ wel@@ le with his si@@ ck father becoming ever more aware of the fact and becoming a hospital .
j@@ ame@@ f b@@ wel@@ le was born in 198@@ 1 in a car accident near munich , where he was a member of the british parliament .
first i had only one broken arm , and then i was able to make a small cup of fl@@ our , which was spread over his brain .
“ it was not a neu@@ ro@@ sur@@ g@@ ical sur@@ gery in camer@@ o@@ on , ” says geor@@ ges b@@ wel@@ le .
we would have liked to see him coming from camer@@ o@@ on if we had had the money .
instead , he spent a lot of years trying to convince his father to leave in over@@ crow@@ ded clin@@ ics and hospit@@ als .
“ it is not easy ” , comm@@ ented bar@@ bar@@ a .
it is possible to vote at five o &apos;@@ clock in the morning and race to the hospital to be the first , and is not the first .
it is very important that we have a very large number of patients .
some people die even if they are waiting .
the situation has changed little .
in camer@@ o@@ on , there is only one doctor for each 5@@ ,000 people , so the world health organisation .
consequently , the problem of the relationship in the united states is that a doctor is 4@@ 13 people .
but even if it is a doctor for you , it is possible that most camera manufacturers will have to wait for the visit .
two of the five people in the country live below the poverty line .
“ the only problem that we have is that you don ’ t have the same poverty ” , says b@@ wel@@ le .
and the poverty makes it impossible to achieve the lives that we have .
the father and so many of his comp@@ at@@ ri@@ ots were seen in b@@ wel@@ le the decision to leave something to be done about it .
dr. geor@@ ges b@@ wel@@ le and his volunte@@ er team have worked closely with the european parliament to carry out 700 free operations last year .
he was himself a doctor and worked as a v@@ as@@ cu@@ lar sur@@ ge@@ on in central hospital in y@@ a@@ oun@@ d@@ é .
in addition , he founded a non-@@ profit organization called as@@ co@@ ville , which is involved in the development of rural areas at week@@ ends and provides free medical care there .
since 2008 , he and his volunte@@ ers have spent almost 3@@ 2@@ ,000 people on the project .
almost every friday of the week he and until the 30@@ th person in small buses and drive with the ver@@ sch@@ l@@ ü@@ t@@ ten medical equipment on the roof over un@@ pav@@ ed terr@@ aces .
not always reliable , but the process is always smooth .
the first european union member state to have replaced the vehicles with rivers and mu@@ d .
but if you are coming , you will be like her@@ oes : a fe@@ ast of the spirit , a sing@@ ing and dance and the best accommodation that the place to offer .
in these villages , the free medical care is really a reason for celebr@@ ation and b@@ wel@@ le – with its wide sm@@ ile and its unlimited energy – is happy to help with the che@@ er@@ ful celebr@@ ation .
on the next morning the team starts with the investigation of hundreds of people who have been diagno@@ sed .
“ pro ride we treat 500 people ” , says b@@ wel@@ le .
you come from a surrounding of 3 km , and you will reach the village of s@@ ant &apos;@@ e@@ gi@@ dio on foot .
each of these weekend clin@@ ics offers medical care in a number of areas .
many people will be arrested for mal@@ aria , tu@@ ber@@ cu@@ lo@@ sis , mal@@ nutri@@ tion , di@@ abe@@ tes , par@@ a@@ sites , and sex@@ ually transmitted diseases .
other people get cr@@ ut@@ ches , don@@ ated gl@@ asses or free birth@@ day documents – a document that is important for school .
in the evening , the team conduc@@ ts simple operations with local an@@ aes@@ thetic .
the operational activities are usually carried out in a school , the town hall or an apartment ; after the installation , the patient is on and going to the recre@@ ation area , to be able to make room for the next .
the lighting is designed for the op and the decor@@ ation of the dis@@ inf@@ ection equipment .
it is a stren@@ u@@ ous effort to make , but the village musicians are helping to make the team mo@@ tivation to work .
“ you are dr@@ ying the whole night , so that we can stay awa@@ ke and continue our work , ” says b@@ wel@@ le .
on sunday , the team will return to the city where they will be ti@@ red but proud of the work done .
the group – a mix@@ ture of camera and psycho@@ therap@@ ist from abroad – has developed a new , innovative and innovative system of sur@@ g@@ ical sur@@ gery last year , and knows that it has made a huge difference to the people who help .
a man explained that the world &apos;s free operation of a bel@@ t of performance he received was a great help to him .
“ the change in the future of my family ” , the man said .
in addition to the weekly clin@@ ics and his work as a sur@@ ge@@ on in the hospital , b@@ wel@@ le also works in private clin@@ ics in y@@ a@@ oun@@ d@@ é at night .
with this second job , the commission financed 60 % of its non-@@ profit activities , so it remained at the level of the rest from private don@@ ations .
“ i know that i am not sure when he sle@@ eps , ” k@@ ati@@ e o &apos;@@ m@@ alle@@ y , who was born in the second year of dre@@ x@@ el university in phil@@ ade@@ l@@ phi@@ a medicine , said volun@@ tar@@ ily .
he is always either in hospital or in an attempt to spend money on the organization , so he can respond to these campaigns .
for medical and medical doctors , the commission has proposed a new system of training for the benefit of health students such as o &apos;@@ mal@@ ley , who come from the united states and europe and support them .
“ we can be very successful in operations , where we can help to save blood , ” says the german federal ministry of economics and technology ( d@@ f@@ g ) , explains o &apos;@@ mal@@ ley .
the commission would have done this as a medical student in the second year .
the students pay their journey to camer@@ o@@ on themselves and bring often mixed don@@ ations .
are you , however , in y@@ a@@ oun@@ d@@ é first , b@@ wel@@ le takes over the accommodation , transportation and instruc@@ tion .
“ he is quite without doubt a her@@ o , ” says o &apos;@@ m@@ alle@@ y .
he devoted himself to his life to this organisation and his desire to give the camer@@ o@@ on people a helping hand , knows no borders .
for b@@ wel@@ le , the almost permanent work is no stra@@ in .
other people who are happy with life are not only the victims of the crime but also the victims of the crime , and they are also the victims of the crime .
“ i am so happy that i can &apos;t see this work . ” he said .
and i think of my father .
i hope that he will see what i am doing .
i am concerned about the fact that people are being lau@@ gh@@ ed again and that the pain is being alle@@ vi@@ ated .

excellent location , close to the beach and the city centre .
the role of the s@@ anti@@ ago , the old man in he@@ min@@ gos , is not a matter of doubt .
jan@@ son is a young man himself , and he is a very good ac@@ tress .
the old man san@@ ti@@ ago was able to do no harm in fishing .
for example , the two are simply great .
it is believed that the european union &apos;s wr@@ ink@@ les are in the nec@@ k of the old man , the fisher@@ man &apos;s boy , to be able to see .
if san@@ ti@@ aga is ti@@ red of life , he will be able to do so .
in addition , the role of the old fish is by and by a character role , which jan@@ son has excell@@ ently managed .
he@@ min@@ ous way is telling the story of a figh@@ ter who was a bra@@ ve man who was not able to stop and was ultimately killed by his knowledge and also his will .
jan@@ son is in large di@@ stances a single person and is on stage .
he creates a new situation in which the public ’ s attention is focused .
his efforts to help fish at last to the surface of the water are a step in the right direction , so that the spec@@ t@@ ators are for@@ getting that the sea is only blue .

in the course of the performance he uses the active scene to illu@@ min@@ ate the hi@@ p of s@@ anti@@ ago , the bar of the sing@@ er , mari@@ e-@@ lu@@ is@@ e g@@ un@@ st , the bar , which is decorated with songs and their splendid voice .

tourism : ab@@ str@@ act to the roman empire , the first roman city in the world , the first in the world .
on about 120 meters of length , the road is covered by a se@@ wage canal from the roman period .
who wants to visit cologne is coming to the cathedral .
around 15@@ 7 meters of the track , the two to@@ wers stand in the sky and make it the second highest church tower in europe .
but only a few visitors who have seen the two branches of kir@@ ch@@ t@@ to@@ wers are able to adm@@ ire the beautiful view of the castle .
ra@@ iner sch@@ u@@ le is an expert in the cologne / bon@@ n sub@@ world .
meeting point for his guided tours is the service center of cologne .
the tour is starting at a very un@@ spectacular end : &quot; we are beginning to see the underground car park &quot; , says schul@@ ze .
in the 197@@ 0s , the us and the european union wanted to build a city that is compatible with the car , and so the remains of the old city wall remained just what was not too big .
the majority of users of the ei@@ len parking garage are therefore now also taking part in the roman remains and only putting their car off .
but who is more closely watching , disco@@ vers in the par@@ k@@ dec@@ k d@@ 2 a metal ro@@ d that is separated from the metal iron ro@@ ds .
the show is about five meters high ru@@ ins of hand@@ t@@ l@@ ery large stone , which are still visible .
&quot; it is real remains of the roman city wall , which was built in the second half of the first century after christ .
before it is back to the day@@ light , it is time for the participants to be able to take their own view of the fin@@ er park .
the first step is to find the path of the old cathedral , which is , unfortunately , hardly visible .
nearby station of the tour is the magnificent pre@@ tori@@ um , and here you can get up again .
we are witn@@ essing the official status of the former powerful state of the north of the alps .
what c@@ ca@@ a means is that a visitor group wants to know .
&quot; the ab@@ bre@@ vi@@ ation stands for &quot; col@@ onia clar@@ ke &quot; , a young artist who has been working in the field of the arts in good german .
and when it comes to the pre@@ tori@@ um , it is the former seat of the state palace , the centre of power of the roman empire on the rh@@ ine .
from the front of the exhibition a tunnel leads to the entrance to the roman se@@ wage canal , which is located here at about 120 meters long .
&quot; you can rest a bit along the so-called c@@ low@@ ning line .
a surprise of this is that schul@@ ze is still .
after having been involved in the payment of the key , he leads the bank group to a 16 meter deep , which is then accessible to the public .
&quot; we are now in the mid@@ st of the new ri@@ tes , a rit@@ ual jewish bath , &quot; he explains .
the jewish community of bau@@ te built its bath deep in the ground to be connected to the gr@@ ound@@ water , which is responsible for the rit@@ ual washing .
until now , the lower part of the millennium bc has been the site of the mi@@ k@@ we , whose origin@@ s go back to the eigh@@ th century , which has been replaced by changing pe@@ aks of the rh@@ ine .
the millennium development goals are part of an archae@@ ological zone on the ra@@ th@@ au@@ tic square , for which the construction works will be due shortly .
until the final version , however , a few years will still be passed .
b@@ in almost ab@@ h@@ acked : cur@@ ved again from ro@@ ck@@ er process .
a blood el@@ ves attack is not only a threat to the world , but also a threat to the world .
a process for experim@@ ents on dead animals , dangerous animals , and other subjects that are not covered by the law for two thir@@ ty years has taken place in the frankfurt district court .
he will be accompanied by strict safety measures .
the requested action was taken by the def@@ end@@ ants to the start of the campaign .
you should be able to use the ro@@ ck@@ er scene and be one of the band@@ di@@ dos at that time .
the prosecu@@ tor &apos;s office raises the question of whether or not to establish a european prosecu@@ tor in june 2009 , together with unknown accompl@@ ices in fin@@ ow@@ fur@@ t , in a car .
all victims were se@@ ve@@ rely in@@ ju@@ red , a man would have lost his le@@ g almost .
the victims should be forced to compete with the h@@ all@@ s ang@@ els group .
one should be a high-@@ level committee member from berlin .
the first of these was apparently the fact that the police had a hun@@ t for several cars .
according to the prosecu@@ tion , the case was about re@@ bel@@ lion and a demonstration of power .
the two employees of the def@@ end@@ ants were in a first trial at the beginning of 2012 .
a court case is a case in point when he said that there was no evidence that the police had been involved in the bloo@@ dy f@@ eu@@ d .
the perpe@@ tr@@ ators had mas@@ ks wor@@ n and were not recognized .
the federal court of justice has rul@@ ed that the jud@@ ges have been revised and that the court has issued a further ruling on the matter .
one of the def@@ end@@ ants is currently in prison for another off@@ ence .
for the opening of the event , the main focus was on the reconstruction of the processes in the tat@@ n@@ ach@@ t .
as a witness , the then er@@ ased plan by the commissioner was loaded .
in the center were mobile phone calls from the def@@ end@@ ants and other people who were ab@@ duc@@ ted from the police .
it is difficult to see how ro@@ ck@@ ers can almost always get to the court to get a law that they can judge .
the same applies to the victims .
in the first process , only one of the victims was p@@ oured out .
prosecu@@ tor , ste@@ fan gol@@ fi@@ er of the public prosecu@@ tor &apos;s office in frankfurt ( or ) , said , on demand , that since the last trial , there have been new trac@@ es of this kind .
for the process , ele@@ ven further negotiating chap@@ ters are scheduled .
the removal of waste is a matter of thinking not only about the transport company but also about the transport company .
the night was long , the music l@@ oud and the mo@@ od good , but some@@ time it goes home .
only : in the trees , the people on the side passenger seat and the back seat , the driver &apos;s hun@@ ger is notic@@ eable .
it is clear that the one or other cock@@ tail is not the right one to do so .
what is the point , then , as is being ch@@ illed for the next drive in , to be able to take a little bit of a break ?
i admit that the commission has not been very happy to be involved in this at night or at night .
a few po@@ m@@ mes , a col@@ a , a bur@@ ger and then no@@ x like from after home and into bed !
but , on the way home , the most obvious problems are those between me and other hun@@ gr@@ y dis@@ co go@@ ers .
because what do we need to miss , that you can get to know your favorite things with stead@@ y regul@@ arity ?
before all , the week@@ ends are full of we@@ t@@ lands of paper , which are now being bur@@ nt on street ed@@ ges and on parking spaces .
&quot; why is this ? &quot; i ask myself .
are the people too do@@ of , to the clo@@ ths with after home respected , until the next m@@ ill glu@@ e .
it is not the only case that the european parliament &apos;s paper product is dis@@ appe@@ aring , of course .
t@@ ü@@ ches also have a transport system such as le@@ it@@ plan@@ ks , thus causing accidents .
the report is not about what thin@@ ks &apos; dispos@@ able company &apos; but about what it does not think , probably it does not even know what this word actually means .
if you want to spend more time on the beach , you can do it with a lot of people in the car .
as a result , some bags would be more or less also ni@@ x .
i see no reason why the commission should not be allowed to take part in the we@@ gr@@ ä@@ m@@ men .
obama ’ s re@@ treat to the health policy
after intense debate , the commission president made a proposal yesterday for a re@@ tro@@ grade step in the frequently repeated , un@@ ambigu@@ ous promise : “ if you like your health insurance , you can keep it . ”
after hundreds of thousands of people have been insu@@ red by their insurance company , they are waiting for the government to take the president to the hospital in recent days , and they have asked the american public to dec@@ ei@@ ve him .
yesterday , we rela@@ ti@@ vi@@ zed his original concept of “ the world ” .
“ the overwhel@@ ming majority of the citizens who live in a functioning health insurance are in a position to keep it , ” he said in a speech in bo@@ ston .
as a result of the numerous media reports on the dis@@ mis@@ s@@ als , obama has called on those americans who have received such communications to focus on the free market for a new insurance .
the majority of citizens could thus find a better , more comprehensive health insurance for the same price or lower than forec@@ asts .
“ you come a better life and offer ” , he said .
the government is calling it a little un@@ surprising that the government has been so slow to absor@@ b the five percent of the population that has itself insurance .
“ i want to give these americans a very direct say : they have earned better , ” said se@@ be@@ li@@ us at a hearing before the energy and climate change committee of the house of representatives in washington .
se@@ be@@ li@@ us , the most important project for the implementation of the affili@@ ate care act , is the director of the institute for the promotion of the online platform since october .
“ i am as fru@@ stra@@ ted and an@@ gr@@ y as any other , ” said she .
i am determined to do everything in my power to reg@@ ain your trust .
this reconciliation is not a good thing , but it is a very important one .
after more than three hours of hearing , the european parliament ur@@ ged long se@@ be@@ li@@ us to deal with the question of why “ architec@@ ts ” of the aff@@ or@@ d@@ able care act did not volun@@ tar@@ ily respond to a state@@ -@@ spon@@ so@@ red insurance policy .
government in jerusal@@ em
a us president , bar@@ ack obama , who anony@@ m@@ ously wanted to stay anonymous , said on thursday that he had a very serious problem with the us news station that israeli figh@@ ter aircraft had been killed one day before .
the aim is &apos; rapid reaction &apos; and &apos; associated equipment &apos; .
sy@@ ri@@ an and leban@@ ese media , as well as the arab channel al-@@ arab@@ i@@ ya , had previously reported that the base in the port town of lat@@ ak@@ ia was in the night of wednesday .
the isra@@ eli@@ -@@ tv channel has been showing satellite images of the base station , in la@@ ta@@ ki@@ a , on which russian dis@@ sent is being used by the s-@@ 12@@ 5 ne@@ wa and a bat@@ ter@@ y-@@ powered sa@@ -@@ 3 missi@@ le .
un@@ certain the government in jerusal@@ em , however , has officially not confirmed the attack .
however , the commission &apos;s news agency quo@@ tes in the same way an anonymous israeli journ@@ alist , mr re@@ u@@ ters , saying that he believes that israel must have carried out the attack , but is not certain .
a spo@@ kes@@ man for the israeli defense ministry said , in any case , &apos; we are not comm@@ enting on these reports &apos; .
the journ@@ alist , r@@ on ben@@ -@@ y@@ is@@ ha@@ i , stressed in the daily newspaper y@@ ed@@ i@@ oth a@@ hr@@ on@@ ot@@ h that the country ’ s regime has already been , and is , in part successful , trying to re@@ build ground air missi@@ les .
the israeli government has had repeated war@@ nings that it will not be possible to stop syria from trying to use he@@ z@@ bol@@ lah with chemical or other dangerous weapons .
john ker@@ ry explains in a be@@ st-@@ ever book that the us is a “ big brother ” of the world .
john ker@@ ry suggested that the debian project is about to become a non-@@ free project with an un@@ expected admission .
the foreign minister gave a clear signal that he would not be playing with bar@@ ack obama in the face of the fact that he was going to be on the slo@@ ts when he was att@@ acking the explo@@ sive rev@@ el@@ ations of the wh@@ ist@@ le blo@@ c .
by using the integrated software , you can easily find us in the us government in a diplomatic stor@@ m of indi@@ gn@@ ation on the part of its allies .
in the event of a video connection , the user may not be able to access the internet at the open government conference in london , ker@@ ry said , “ it is absolutely clear that the president and i and others in the government have learned of some things .
then , the council recognised that it was the first high-@@ ran@@ king member of the us government to admit that the us es@@ pi@@ on@@ age had cros@@ sed a border , but also stressed that no rights were ab@@ used .
he said : “ in some cases , the un@@ reasonable thing is gone too far . ”
the president is determined to provide clarity and to do so , and to conduct a thorough investigation so that no one can feel that the council is being mis@@ used .
i assure you that the commission will not toler@@ ate the rights of inno@@ cent people in this process .
ker@@ ry was , however , insi@@ stent that the n@@ sa was a force of good , and that its surveillance operations put many lives at risk .
he added that the commission ’ s proposal is a very important one .
it is a radical change in extre@@ mis@@ m in the world that is ob@@ s@@ essed with the fact that people are killing , in the air , in the air , and in the attacks on governments .
what would be if the commission were to be able to do this ?
we have indeed plan@@ es in the air , attacks on buildings and the murder of mr mu@@ gab@@ e , because we have been working on this in the run@@ -up to such plans .
meanwhile , the us and us legisl@@ ators will travel to europe to address concerns about the supposed american spi@@ on@@ age .
sen@@ ator christian sch@@ um@@ ach@@ y from connec@@ tic@@ ut , said that he had not been with representatives of the european parliament and other people this week and was concerned about their threats to move away from the european parliament because of the fru@@ stration about national security .
