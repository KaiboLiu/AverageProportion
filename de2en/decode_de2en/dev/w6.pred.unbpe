expert advice : more safety for pedestrians
they are not 100 meters from each other : on tuesday , the new b 33-footbridge is opened in gutach at the village parking lot - in sight of the older ramparts .
two plants so close together : intention or turtle ?
this question has been made clear by the committee of the mayors yesterday .
&quot; the city hall light was installed at that time because it was the school way , &quot; explained eckert yesterday .
the kluser-light safe both cyclists and bus passengers and the mountain residents .
the commission &apos;s official plant , which was officially launched yesterday , is important for the sulzbachweg / kirchstraße crossroads .
we have the museum , two churches , kurpark , the bus stop , a doctor and a bank as well as the traffic flow from the residential area › grub ‹ .
&quot; the high traffic and pedestrian traffic has had to be accompanied by another traffic light to ensure their safety &quot; , says eckert .
this is confirmed by peter arnold of the offenburg country council .
&quot; according to current measurements , on the b 33 daily about 12 000 vehicles pass the municipality of gutach , of which about 10 percent are heavy goods traffic , &quot; says arnold .
therefore , the construction of another traffic light is more than necessary : &apos; safety is just going ahead &apos; , arnold says .
four transport inspections have been carried out in total , but a circle has also been planned , but because of the narrow area in the sulzbachweg / kirchstraße crossroads .
according to arnold , the choice of location of the traffic lights was first tested : &quot; by means of an extra for us with particularly long wooden tribes , transport vehicles were extended .
the eur 15 000 million traffic light system itself is the most modern , which is currently available on the market , and the arnold explained .
the plant is equipped with coloured leds that illuminate so strongly that the lights are from the drivers , for example , even at low sun .
and it is also economical : the older lighting systems use about 100 watts , the new ones just eight watts .
there are three lighting systems per direction of travel .
arnold explained the technique of the new plant : it is equipped with two radar sensors .
if the pedestrian press the traffic light button , the upper radar sensor tests the traffic situation .
if the road is free , the pedestrian will get straight green , if not , it will take about 15 seconds .
another radar sensor checks whether the green phase for the pedestrian is finished .
&quot; should a group or people with handicaps go through the streets , the green period will be extended , so everyone will be able to get around safely on the road , &quot; said arnold .
of course , the drivers must think along here as partners and observe the track .
this was not the case yesterday : the traffic light for pedestrians showed green , noise a ceiling beam , and the traffic light was not working .
josef winkler has been writing the necessary documents for his childhood for more than 30 years .
the catastrophes of his catholic village childhood - the lack of speech , the tendency to raw violence and blunt sexuality , the close and unjoyful nature - have diminished the carinthian poet .
the büchner laureate is known mainly as a prosaauthor , theatre texts are in his work rar .
collage from prosatextes gerhard fresacher presents for his performance &quot; weather lights on the tongue &quot; , which is now available in the garage x on the st. peter &apos;s square .
the theatre makers combine elements from the autobiographical style of the novel &quot; der leibeigene &quot; ( 1987 ) with prosamines from &quot; leichnam , his family laughing &quot; ( 2003 ) .
on the largely empty stage - important requirements for the future : a broken stage , a new stage , a new stage , which is apparently being played .
director fresacher seems to have little faith in the text .
the 70-minute performance overcomes the original with a plethora of director &apos;s injuries known from the repertoire of postdramatic works .
the actors in particular are often somewhat more fragile in the scenic transformations that sometimes seem to be unclear .
they are being hard-pressed , exchanged with their heads under water , with their evening robes pushed to the wall .
the cellophane is a small , small , medium , and very large , and is made of a thick , solid , static , or static material .
the text is conceived in this hard-hitting way , however .
the best moments of the evening when sung is sung - the bandwidth ranges from deep purple to popular music .
only towards the end comes the overturned performance to a certain degree of calm , and winkler ’ s downright absurd humor is now gazing on .
a black box in the car ?
american road planners are looking for a source of money to finance the declining highway system .
the devices that drive every kilometre and pass the information to the authorities are at the heart of a controversial attempt by washington to make the planned nuclear plant more efficient .
the normally rather boring area of road planning suddenly has an intensive debate with colorful alliances .
libertarians have joined forces with environmental groups and are arguing for the government to keep the small boxes in place to record the kilometres that are driven – and possibly also where they have been driven – and then use the information for calculation .
the tea party is appalled .
the american civil rights association ( aclu ) is also deeply concerned and expresses a number of concerns about data protection .
but , while congress has not agreed on an approach , several states are no longer waiting .
they are currently examining how they can contribute to a system over the next ten years whereby drivers can be reimbursed for dangerous mile .
thousands of drivers have used the tachograph , some of which have been equipped with gps surveillance , and they have already tested it .
this really is a must for our country .
“ it is nothing we will only use , ” said hasan ikhrata , managing director of southern clalia , who is the only one in the world to have a record of the dangerous events .
the way in which we pay these taxes will change .
the technology is there .
the initiative comes at a time when the highway trust fund , which is the source of tax revenue , is handing over to the us at the fuel exchange rate , is bankrupt .
but america is no longer danced as much as it once did .
cars consume less petrol .
the state tax on mineral oil of 18.4 cents per gallon ( less than 4 euro cents per litre ) has not risen for 20 years .
politicians dare not take the tax at high prices , even to raise a penny .
“ the tax on petrol is simply not sustainable , ” says lee munnich , an expert on transport legislation at the university of minnesota .
its state has recently sold 500 cars with tachographs that allow a mileage of paid taxes .
“ this represents the most viable alternative in the long run , ” he said .
bureaucrats call it miley-based usage .
it is not surprising that the idea of urban liberals is popular , because the tax could be used to increase the driving behaviour , for example , in such a way that congestion and emissions that are harmful to the climate are reduced .
california planners rely on the system to develop strategies to help the world ’ s ambitious , legally enshrined goals .
but bill shuster from pennsylvania , the republican chairman of house transportation committee , has not yet said that he will be able to make the most viable long-term alternative .
the free marketers of the reason foundation are also convinced that the idea of driving drivers to the end of the distance they have travelled is a good one .
“ this is not a tax that is disappearing in a black hole , ” explains adrian moore , vice president of reason ’ s policy .
people pay directly for what they get .
the movement is also supported by two former us transport ministers , who were presented with congress in a report in 2011 , in order to move towards mileage based accounting .
the us senate approved a 90 million dollars expensive pipeline project last year , which would cost 10,000 cars .
but the majority in the house of representatives prevented the move and responded to the concerns of members from rural areas who wanted to represent people who were in the daily routine often bulk on the road to work or to the city .
several states and major cities are nevertheless moving in the direction of their own accord .
the most committed one is oregon , which currently employs 5,000 drivers for the country ’ s largest experiment .
these drivers will soon be paying mileage charges instead of the fuel tax to the federal state .
nevada has already completed a pilot project .
new york city is also considering such a thing .
illinois tests it to a limited extent with lorries .
and the i-95 coalition , to which the transport ministries of 17 states on the east coast belong ( including maryland , pennsylvania , virginia , and florida ) , is currently investigating changes .
the concept is not a universal hit .
in nevada , where recently 50 volunteers were equipped with the equipment , drivers were sceptical about the idea that the government could track each of their movements .
“ concerns about big brother and such things were a big problem , ” says alauddin khan , head of the strategy and result management in the ministry of transport of nevada .
people did not want it .
when the test was launched , the aclu from nevada warned on their website , “ it would be relatively easy to use the tachographs in full-size surveillance devices . ”
there is no need to create a gigantic , bulky technological infrastructure that will inevitably be used to create jobs and to create jobs .
nevada is a state in the world that is now seeking affordable technology .
in the process , khan argued , the public would be more reassured .
the hunt for this technology has led some authorities to a small start-up company called true mileage in california .
the company was not originally registered to assist states in the taxation of drivers .
rather , it was their aim to create a market for motor insurance in an emerging market , where drivers would be able to make their own decisions on the basis of the mileage they had taken .
but the devices it has tested are also useful to road planners , because they do not work with gps and provide only limited information that is regularly transmitted via modem .
“ people are more willing to participate if their speed and location are not recorded , ” says the president of ryan morrison , managing director of true mile .
in some of these public pilot programmes , major mistakes have been made .
there are much cheaper and less intrusive ways of doing this .
in oregon , the planners experiment with driving drivers using a range of choices .
you can register for a device with or without gps .
or you don &apos;t choose any device at all and pay a flat rate based on the average of the prices that are paid by all residents of the state .
others hope to see the concept of a suspicious public , by using the equipment with more functions , and by using at least one .
in new york city , transport officials want to develop a tax device that can also pay parking fees , pay insurance only for dangerous kilometres .
“ drivers would be more protected by the added value of the system ’ s benefits , ” says dr. hans schröder , a planning document from the city .
some transport planners , however , wonder whether all the talk of paying per mile is not just a huge distraction .
the metropolitan transport commission is responsible for the transportation of san francisco bay area .
an additional one-off fee or annual levy could be imposed on drivers with hybrid vehicles or other vehicles that use little petrol .
“ there is no reason for an operation when an aspirin is sufficient , ” explains randy rentschler , head of legislation and public affairs at the commission .
if we do that , hundreds of millions of drivers will worry about their privacy and many other things .
königsfeld : small team beats wacker to the ground .
the voluntary fire brigade managed its autumn main probe despite personnel shortages , with a bravour .
only 11 men took part in the exercise .
the commander of the department , hans kammerer , had taken over the property pen in the burgberger straße in his practice .
the sawing should be done with a short circuit .
the resulting fire and smoke development have left two people injured , one of whom could still send an emergency call .
two breathing carriers of the armed forces made their way through hans kammer after the first examination of the situation .
after a short time , the first person was found and released , and he was led into the open .
the second person had to be carried .
this was not so easy , as a narrow staircase was to overcome .
the building , a workshop with integrated stall for two horses , was not easy to secure .
it stored a lot of wood and also straw bales in it .
there were also electric machines for woodworking .
the first attack was carried out on the tank in the vehicle .
another line was built by an overfloor hydrate in about 100 meters distance .
now three fire attacks have been made .
the building also used a hollow beam tube .
hans kammerer was also involved in the exercise in showing what is possible with little available staff .
in case of serious problems , support is provided via the königsfeld daily operations group .
the commander was shown as the exercise proceeded .
networking of universities and companies is important .
during his visit to the district of breisgau-hochblack forest , president guido wolf also visited tititisee-neustadt to find out where the workforce of tomorrow comes from .
in the hochschwarzwald funding centre , he joined the managing directors of the professional schools and the district gymnasium and the chairmen of the parents &apos; advisory council on this important issue .
&quot; education is an important factor in the location of the company &quot; , underlined claudia stelle , director of the hans-thoma school , who has developed the networked school project hochschwarzwald .
wolf was impressed by the model projects for training .
since 2011 , the forest city has been cooperating successfully between the förderzentrum , kreisgymnasium and the vocational school centre .
he also praised the family-friendly nature of the district .
&quot; it is important not only to look at the family phase , but also to look at the phase around the care of the care of relatives , &quot; wolf said .
he also said that more and more employees are concerned about the care and care of their relatives .
&quot; without the support of employers , the resulting burden of labour can lead to an end to the working relationship &quot; , said wolf .
but no one can afford to hire skilled workers , he said .
another particularly important factor is the networking of universities and companies .
&quot; those who have already been able to experience the advantages of the region during their studies will continue to enjoy the benefits of their knowledge and skills in the regional economy , which will help to strengthen the region , &quot; said the president of the country .
only if there are sufficient training places available can the skilled person &apos;s needs be met .
in his opinion , the local advantage is its advantage .
he also experienced a lot of problems during his train journey from titisee-neustadt to freiburg , and the efforts already made to develop local public transport .

the more than 100 years old stone wall as the front of the pre-renovation old school house of the kirchstraße is to be reopened with new buildings on the city &apos;s renovation cost plan .
in the days before kilbig , the first works of the renovation of the front school court were made a small wall of wall , stabilization and static relief of the more than one hundred years old stone wall with balustrade .
the next step , alexander misok said , is to remove the bräunlinger stadtbaumamt , the landesdenkmalamt , in the planning and to develop a rehabilitation concept for the old wall .
after that , a cost calculation will be carried out by experts who will then be submitted to the local council for deciding and defining the further action .
a decision on this will probably be made next year .
after renovation , paving and planting of the old school yard , within the two sides of the church of st. paul built in 1912 , the new school must be opened in the foreseeable future as a follow-up measure that requires renovation .
the historic , one hundred year old wall of the old school court to kirchstraße is famous for its water and frost damage , as no drainage is present , renovation is needed and has a archery .
deep cracks in individual stones bear witness to weather damage , but the wall is not currently in danger of collapse .
a steady wall is a prerequisite for a school courtyard used by students , which is the result of the current fastening works .
originally , the school yard was already in the year 2008 / 2009 , but high unscheduled expenses also brought a shift in the budget .
an important word in the historical school wall renovation , which has already been used for film shots , is the national heritage office .
if you do not receive any information from this site , the city of bräunlingen hopes to receive grants from the monument protection organizations .
the students of the bräunlinger primary school , which has now returned to a well refurbished old school building with new aula , can soon visit the old school courtyard .
özdemir wants to train jazz in stuttgart .
the ongoing discussions on the future of music colleges in baden-württemberg have now included cem özdemir , federal chairman of the greens .
&quot; i think it is wrong to include holistic education in the stuttgart music academy &quot; , said özdemir the &quot; stuttgart state opera &quot; .
jazz and classical music are just part of the stuttgart jazz scene .
this is contrary to what özdemir , who was the favourite in stuttgart for a direct mandate at the federal election on 22 september , is proposing to the green / red state government .
this is pushing forward on the basis of an expert study , a reorganization of the five music colleges in baden-württemberg .
the programme will then include the study programme jazz and pop from the musikhochschule stuttgart to the musikhochschule mannheim .
u.s. border : &quot; super tunnel &quot; to drug smuggling discovered
on the border between mexico and the us , investigators have built a &quot; super tunnel &quot; to smuggle drugs and have closed it down .
as the us customs have said , the more than 500 metres long tube between tijuana and san diego was equipped with electricity , rail tracks and a beventilation system .
three suspects were therefore arrested , eight tonnes of marijuana and almost 150 kilograms of cocaine were seized .
the tunnel was not , according to the data , in use .
&quot; these cartels are stupid if they think they could be dispersed under the radar , &quot; said the attorney general of the us district southern california .
the drug gangs were insured duffy : &quot; if you continue to build such tunnels and try to use them , we are determined to make this a huge waste of your dirty money .
both the us authorities and the mexican security forces are in a permanent struggle against drug cartels .
since 2006 , more than 77,000 people have been killed in mexico in connection with drug crime .
built by experts
due to the extensive equipment of the tunnel , the investigators assume that he is being used by architects and engineers .
the track was equipped to produce electric and electronic cars .
on the mexican side , access is in a building 80 meters from the border .
according to the authorities , a ladder leads 20 meters to the depth of the tunnel entrance itself .
the tunnel has a cross-section of 1.20 meters of height and 90 centimetres wide .
he would have been able to move illegal immigration towards the united states .
two of the suspects were arrested in connection with the cocaine fund .
the third , a mexican , was arrested for the confiscated marihuana .
all three are threatened with life imprisonment for the maximum punishment , as officials have said .
since 2006 , eight such tunnels have been discovered , said at the press conference in san diego .
but this is the first time that in such a tunnel construction cocaine has been found .
cocaine is normally produced in smaller quantities , not through tunnel .
this shows the &quot; desperation &quot; of drug gangs , whose traditional routes have now been cut off , bill sherman said of the drug hunt dea in san diego .
they would do everything to get to the us .
no details have been given of the detainees , at least one of them being mexicans .
they must be accompanied by prison sentences of up to ten years .
in 2014 , geissinger will be celebrating the year 2014 , geissinger festjahr
the city &apos;s anniversary of geisingen on the occasion of the 1250 .
the first written mention of the town is getting closer .
if in more than eight weeks the year ends , the anniversary year is on .
hostages and church houses were built in 794 for the first time together .
in churches was a document produced in which both places were mentioned .
on 15 march , there will be an official start to the anniversary year , and since hostages are not in the hall at the moment , this opening event will take place in the place where it was first mentioned 1250 years ago , in france .
in the context of the anniversary , several events have been held in the field of geisingen as well as in kirchen-hausen .
kirchen-hausen will be performing on a festival weekend from july 18th to 20th in 1250 .
remembrance celebrates .
on friday with a party , on saturday and sunday with a party around the kirchtal hall .
this weekend &apos;s party also features the church house of st. peter .
city music director rudolf barth has created a new album for the city on the occasion of the anniversary , which will be shown at three dates .
on 21 june , together with the sunday celebration of the black forest association , on 12 july in the arena with fireworks and on 13 december as the first concert of city music in the new festhalle .
this is celebrated in the anniversary year and is celebrated , the official date is last september .
on the occasion of the geisinger city anniversary , a new chronicle is also released .
&quot; however , a chronicle should not only be of hostages themselves , but also a printed work about the hostility of today , which is just from geissingen , kirchen-hausen , leipferdingen .
and the hostility of today celebrates 2014 birthday , and in 1974 the present space was extended with the communities. the new building was built in the same way as the new town hall .
the new chronicle will be published on 21 or 22 november in the new festhalle in geisingen .
but 2014 is also a year with many anniversary .
the foolish guild strohglonki begins on 8 february with a customs evening on the occasion of its 60-year existence , the harmony gutmadingen is 90 years and has the festbanquet on 29 march and has .
the altenwerk leipferdingen is 40 years old , the geisinger schule has been in the new location for 50 years and celebrates it on 10 may , the musikverein polyhymnia leipferdingen is 150 years old and celebrates it .
the city of geisingen was founded in a gift certificate owned by the monastery of st. gallen in 764 for the first time .
the document was published in churches ( hausen ) , which was then court place .
both communities are thus in the same document .
reason 2014 this 1250 year old to celebrate accordingly , additionally there is the local councillor &apos;s reform 40 years ago .
the council is targeting rail systems
if the railway crossing is to be &quot; laborious &quot; , it is to be reconstructed to increase road safety ?
yes , have local councils decided .
schiltach has to pay 220 000 euros for this .
deutsche bahn wants to support the kinzigtal railway line in the coming year .
in particular , safety at railway crossings should be increased - regularly there are collisions between trains and other vehicles throughout the country .
if the communities agree to the reconstruction measures , they must participate with a third of the costs , the rest share the railways and the federal government .
schiltach ’ s city builder roland grießhaber explained to the municipal council the specificity of the bahrain transition .
there , the city plans to build a new building in the area , in the height of the tunnel to the west of the railway track .
there , too , larger vehicles , such as those transporting long-timber , could be in the off-road position without blocking the track .
greeks therefore proposed to create a necessary support wall in order to prevent the city from closing the next street at the appropriate time .
this was discussed in a controversial manner in the municipal council , as some councils questioned the need for road traffic to be spread : thomas kipp expressed the sentiment of critics : &apos; do we have to spend so much money on so few vehicles ? &apos;
mayor thomas haas disagreed : the railway transition &quot; hirschen &quot; is regularly used for long-wood transports .
even wood from the &quot; kuhbach &quot; area is partly transported over this route , because the vehicles up to 20 meters long make the line at the häberlesbrücke impossible because they are not able to turn into the main road .
the route also served as a rerouting for those vehicles that did not have the tunnel to use when the main road is closed , argued hague .
as kirchberg- and schlossbergtunnel is being rebuilt and reconstructed , as is currently the case in wolfach , the railway crossing can be &quot; on &quot; hirschen &quot; for a longer period of traffic .
the councils agreed to allow the costs of the planned spread of the disease to be investigated .
nevertheless , the rebuilding of the railway transition was approved by a majority , with the provision that the necessary support wall would be built to allow the city to carry out the subsequent road towards bahnhofstrasse , if necessary for encounter traffic 5.5 .
the transformation of the railway crossing at the gerberi trautwein could , on the other hand , lead to a quite different problem , which would make access to the soaring &quot; geroltzhäuser weg &quot; easier .
the administration had to redesign the railway plans from the engineering office in breinlinger , since it had doubts as to whether the planned connection of the geroltzhaus to the railway was possible without further ado .
the investigation concluded that there was no possibility that the ngos would not be able to increase the proportion of the road &apos;s inclination .
the responsibility for this lies with the city as the road load carrier .
the reconstruction could therefore cause liabilities that arise .
since both deforestation and bending are not included in the current state of construction , the conversion should be preceded by the change of railway crossing , hague argued .
i would also like to mention here the risk of a collision of the train with a vehicle standing on the transition considerably lower than at other railway crossings , because the stop is right next to the center , to which a good connection is made .
even trains from the central station would have to be braked to the point that no collision could occur .
the majority of the members of the committee refused to accept the reorganisation of this railway transition , as the city of schiltach had to &quot; bathe out &quot; with floating vehicles , according to the councils , since the railways withdrew from the work .
the board considers the rebuilding of the railway bridges as unproblematic &quot; before heubach &quot; and &quot; before kuhbach &quot; , for which agreements with the railway have already been made .
esa decides on major space missions : missions for billions of euros and billions of euros of world space missions : missions for billions of euros and billions of euros .
far planets , gravitational waves or black holes - experts from the european space agency must be able to agree on two major projects that they will be able to launch in the coming years .
thirty proposals were on the table , five are still in the race .
far off worlds .
more than 1000 planets in other stars have already found astronomers .
whether it is life on some of them , at least , is not known .
the choice is difficult : should you search for gravitational waves ?
or rather the origin of the cosmos explore ?
or after earth like planets , and perhaps alien life ?
these questions are being asked by those responsible for the european space agency esa .
for your &quot; cosmic vision &quot; program , you are looking for ideas for two major space projects that will make a decisive contribution to research .
the budget for such &apos; l missions &apos; is approximately eur 1 billion each .
the start is expected to be 2028 and 2034 .
in early september , the elite of the european space research group met in paris to make proposals for such missions .
thirty ideas were on the table , five of which have now been put to the narrow vote .
numerous bodies are examining proposals to make hooks on researchers .
in the next few days , a final decision will be taken by the scientific programme committee .
in total , the esa selected four major issues to which the missions of the cosmos programme , launched in 2007 , are to be answered .
what are the conditions for the emergence of planets and life ?
the exact processes of the creation of stars from large gas clouds - and thus the formation of planets that have these stars encircled - are still in the proverbial darkness .
a large infrared telescope in all could be able to penetrate this dark .
and if a star has a planet , what circumstances can life be created there ?
to address this issue , the space telescope is to be launched in 2017 , with the launch of 500 already known planetary systems in our nearer environment .
however , the possibilities are limited , cheops is a small mission with a budget of eur 150 million .
with larger instruments , astronomers could depict earth similar planets , and even analyze the composition of their atmospheres , and thus search for &quot; biomarkers &quot; : gases that are considered as evidence of biological activity .
how does the solar system work ?
this issue , too , should ultimately give an indication of the conditions for the creation of life .
magnetic activity of a star and the interaction of its magnetic field play an important role in the development of the particle radiation with the planetarium system .
in our solar system , these processes can be investigated as an example .
the &quot; solar orbiter &quot; is the first esa mission to be awarded the m class ( which is where the budget is about half a billion euros ) for this issue .
the probe is scheduled to start in 2017 and observe the surface and activity of the sun closely .
of great interest to the researchers are also jupiter and his moons .
they want to find out what the giant planet &apos;s role in the development of the solar system has been .
this is the first of the three l missions of the cosmic vision project , which is to be implemented .
the probe &quot; juice &quot; ( jupiter icy moons explorer ) begins your journey probably 2022 .
eight years later , jupiter was supposed to reach the planet &apos;s atmosphere and icy moons , europe , kallisto , and ganymed .
what are the basic physical laws of the universe ?
space offers many possibilities to find material under extreme conditions .
perhaps there are also deviations that could pave the way for physicists to develop a new theory under which all known natural laws can be united .
how did the universe come into being and what is it all about ?
13.7 billion years ago , our cosmos emerged through the big bang .
in addition to the matter we are familiar with , from the stars , planets and living beings such as we exist , there are dark matter whose gravity is galaxies and galaxies .
until now , researchers have neither known what physical laws were adopted in the first fraction of the big bang , nor have any knowledge of what dark laws were valid .
with &quot; euclid &quot; , esa has already conducted an m mission in this area , which is scheduled to start in 2020 .
with a special telescope the probe is intended to control the distribution of the matter in the universe for the first time in the entire sky , thus enabling conclusions to be drawn about the nature of dark matter and dark energy .
those who could race
of the 30 proposals , at the end of the selection procedure , only two remain .
the best chances of being granted as an l mission are , in the opinion of many experts , &quot; e-lisa &quot; , has a sophisticated concept for proving gravitational waves .
by this , physicists understand changes in the structure of space time that albert einstein predicted almost 100 years ago .
they have not been proven to date .
elisa could do this , the scientists hope behind the project .
the mission sees a two-thirds detector in place , which is located in space .
it could , in contrast to installations on earth , also produce gravitational waves that could be used to build the big bang , thus creating new insights into the emergence of the cosmos .
four other proposals are still competing for the second l mission : a large x-ray escope called &quot; athena &quot; , which is , among other things , investigating black holes , &quot; icy planets &quot; , another one .
already left are suggestions for prototyping , retrieval , retrieval and retrieval of venus and asteroid .
snowden prepared to cooperate with germany in terms of us surveillance .
edward snowden , the whistleblower of the us secret service , has said that he is prepared to travel to berlin and to speak to the german bundestag when the american national security agency and its president are in office .
german mep hans-christian ströbele met snowden in russia on thursday , where this asylum was received to deal with him the statement in germany .
in a letter from snowden , which was sent on friday from ströbele to the media in berlin , he writes : “ although the result of my efforts has been demonstrably positive , my government is still treating a dissent as a view as a continuing view .
but telling the truth is not a crime .
in the letter , snowden writes that he believes that support for the international community will strengthen the american government to strengthen the indictment against him .
the data collected by the us department of justice includes espionage and theft of state-owned property .
the german minister for the interior , hans-peter friedrich , said online : “ if mr snowden is prepared to talk to german representatives , then we will find ways to make this possible . ”
relations between the us and germany are strained by the claims that nsa has blocked chancellor merkel ’ s cell phone .
thomas oppermann , the member who has appointed the parliamentary committee responsible for the secret services , said that we should seize the opportunity to witness snowden as a witness if possible , ‘ without him ’ .
ströbele , a member of the greens , published a picture of himself and snowden in his twitter feed .
he was arrested by two german journalists when he was visiting russia .
ströbele explained that according to the lawyer of the former nsa employee snowden did not return to russia if he had left the country .
if snowden says in germany , he needs an assurance that he will be “ safe ” there , so the honourable member says .
snowden states in his letter that he is committed to a “ serious and ongoing ” campaign of persecution that is killing him out of his homeland .
however , it is affected by the global response to “ my act of political expression . ”
citizens around the world , as well as high-level politicians – including those in the united states – have been deeply shocked by the revelations about an uncontrolled system of comprehensive surveillance .
in his letter , snowden is making an offer to the german authorities to cooperate , “ if the humanitarian problems have been resolved ” .
frontier airlines charges hand baggage fees for hand baggage .
frontier airlines plans to deploy up to $ 100 from passengers travelling by air or sea .
frontier airlines intends to provide up to $ 100 for a piece of hand baggage and $ 2 for coffee or lemonade , even if the announcement on wednesday morning does not read .
the new fee applies to hand baggage in the baggage compartment above the seat , small bags under the seat remain free .
frontier said that they are charging usd 25 if the fee is paid in advance and usd 100 for travellers who have only arrived at the gate .
frontier speaker kate o &apos;malley said that the fee of $ 100 targets to make travellers move , to move in advance around the payment .
“ we do not want to calculate this amount , ” she explained .
airlines began to set up a new a380 programme for the first and second baggage checked in in 2008 .
passengers who tried to bypass them have therefore to pay as much as possible in their hand luggage .
fees are a way of encouraging passengers to travel less on board .
o &apos;malley said that the new fee is not really about spending money .
it is about the most loyal customers of frontier , who would have clearly stated that it would be increasingly difficult to find a place in the field above the seat .
passengers who book their tickets on the airline ’ s website do not have to pay .
this means that a passenger on the gate of frontier may have to carry a piece of baggage free of charge , but the next person can pay 100 dollars for a similar piece of baggage .
o &apos;malley explained that the site of frontier and the check-in procedures would be changed so that passengers would be informed about the fee before they are to travel to the gate .
the new hand baggage charge from frontier will only enter into force in the summer , and there is no exact date yet .
passengers often chase over baggage allowances and other charges , but airlines like to use it .
they argue that the transport of luggage is costing money and passengers this service should pay if they use it .
many on wall street view the new baggage charges as a sign that airlines are taking enough money to carry out their own luggage after years of loss .
most , however , have so far been fingers of charges for hand luggage .
spirit airlines inc. requested three years ago to pay the first hand baggage fees and later to follow allegant air , also a low-cost flight .
the only other airline with such a charge is the hungarian wizz air , explained the airline consultant jay sorensen , who has paid the extra fees attentively .
in a december 2011 report , he estimated that the hand baggage fee spirit will cost usd 50 million annually .
sorensen , who used to be a leader in midwest airlines , has been a member of the spirit group recently .
“ the boarding process was one of the smooth running , the most difficult of my career in the aviation industry .
i expected to be teeny and handy discussions at the gate .
“ the plane was full , ” he explained , “ and boarding went like lucky . ”
frontier also follows spirit in the 2 dollars spent on coffee , tea , lemonade or juice .
the company stated that passengers who use the lemonade or juice bought the whole can .
water remains free .
in 2008 , us airways had temporarily tried to make money for soft drinks , but made it seven months later to recover , after the passenger had recovered .
frontiers step , charges for hand luggage , if passengers are not directly involved in the airline , is not the latest initiative to deal with customers on the basis of their own website .
airlines pay online travel agencies such as orbitz 10 to 25 usd per ticket sold .
this gives all companies an incentive to buy passengers directly from them rather than through an online travel agency .
frontier is , however , the most advanced in this area .
in september , the company began to make reservations via an online travel agency only half the number of frequent flyer miles .
on wednesday , the miles were redistributed to 25 % of the route .
a third party booking is not valid for a flight with a frontier of more than 1000 miles .
passengers can also buy directly from the frontier website .
frontier has a loyal customer base at its headquarters in denver , but the business is shrinking and the company loses money .
the proceeds were reduced by 9 % and the flight capacity was down by just under 13 % in the first quarter , as reported in the financial report published on wednesday of the parent company .
republics has tried to provide a service to the public for the financial control of frontier .
proverbs come from the bible
more than 40 women visited the last women &apos;s breakfast this year in the protestant church community of bisingen .
the theme of the day in the municipal house were &quot; proverbs from the bible &quot; and &quot; phrases from the middle ages &quot; .
zita köhler , the chairman of the council of the church , went to a talk after breakfast , which included the biblical proverb .
&quot; proverbs contain lifestyles , regulations or warnings , &quot; she explained .
she compared several words with the corresponding bible places and explained the meaning .
she called proverbs like : holzauge is vigilant , like scales fall from the eyes , cast an eye at someone who gives his the lord in sleep , his hands in innocence .
the speaker had her audience several times , even advising the audience to know what the proverb was .
the words of the middle ages were taken from the church parish councillor christel dehner : all good things are three , making blue , something to cook .
it explained the importance and origin of the speeches that you have called &apos; bridges to the past &apos; .
a raffle was awarded to the end of the race .
prices were on a table covered up and were humorously rewritten before they were sent to the winners .
among the visitors of the breakfast round was also the mayor roman wailen ’ s candidate .
learning rather than unemployed : pilot project for unskilled tourism in the tourism industry
the mecklenburg lake plate is the first building on the lake shore of the lake .
under the leadership of the federal employment agency , 49 women and men who have already been regarded as unskilled in the industry are to be trained as professionals for hotels and restaurants for three winter periods .
&quot; what is new is that the six-month courses with qualifications end , &quot; said carmen wiechert of the employment agency , neubrandenburg .
the benefits are many : they would not make participants unemployed , the companies would be trained , the public would be more and more involved in hotels and restaurants , and the agency would have to avoid financing unemployment .
the project also involves industrial and commercial chambers in neubrandenburg and the deutsche hotel- und gasstättenverband ( dehoga ) mecklenburg-vorpommern .
nsa explains that an “ internal error ” and not hackers are guilty of the crash of the site &apos;s crash and not hackers are guilty of the site crash .
the shadow national security agency declared on the late friday that an error had caused its public website to be paralysed for a few hours and not hackers , as was claimed online .
&quot; nsa.gov was not reachable for a few hours this night , as an internal error occurred during a planned update , &quot; said the spy team .
the problem will be fixed this evening .
the claim that failure is caused by a distributed denial of service call is not valid .
in the early evening , online server trackers had noticed that the nsa website had at least six hours of unreachable and this was not possible for some users .
previously , a nsa spokesman had declared to abc news that the authority ’ s sensitive internal network was “ in no way ” compromised .
secret information is not in danger , so the speaker said .
at least one group of hacktivists claimed to have reached the nsa website with a ddos attack .
in such attacks , the target site is overloaded with page views until the servers are overloaded and the site is broken .
cybertactics are relatively simple , and the attacks are not designed to interfere with the target system &apos;s internal network .
the former super-secret nsa , whose nickname was once no such agency , was a non-governmental organization , and is now in the light of the public eye , looking for the problems that have been revealed over the last few months .
the growing controversy surrounding the secret service fuelled initial speculation about the incident being a major outcome of a targeted attack on cyber operations .
slightly lower is the number of people without jobs in october by 22 to 1,307 .
although the rate was higher than last year at 3.1 % , and also better than in september , &quot; we would have hoped for more , &quot; says monika felder-bauer , deputy managing director of the agency .
many companies have been reacting to attitudes so far .
one reason for this is the felder-bauer : &quot; we have hardly any skilled craftsmen , health care and care for the elderly &quot; .
since september , the annual season has seen a new job offer for staff in the hotel and restaurant sectors .
in the middle of december the winter season begins there .

the loss of profits of bombardier following the decline in supply and orders and the loss of orders for the aircraft , the loss of orders and the loss of orders , are the result of a drop in the number of orders and delivery .
the canadian aircraft and railway manufacturer bombardier inc reported on thursday a 15-percent increase in the net profit of the aircraft and the railway industry after a decline in its order and delivery .
bombardier , based in montreal , did not publish flight test data for its brand new cseries aircraft and did not give any new information about whether the aircraft was being operated in accordance with the ambitious timetable for september next year .
on the jungfernfernflug of the test aircraft a month and a half ago , only three more start-ups were followed , which leaves it questionable whether the test phase is proceeding as planned .
the results were not as good as those forecasts , and led to a fall in the price of more than 8 % on the toronto stock exchange .
cameron doerksen , analyst at national bank financial , lowered his assessment of “ outperform ” on thursday to “ sector performance ” in view of the fact that shares were in the next year to two .
“ while weaker delivery rates on aircraft were expected to be as much as possible , the margins in transport are clearly disappointing , ” doerksen said in a customer letter .
we believe that bombardier is creating new orders for the cseries when the test program for the aircraft is progressing .
but if no new orders are announced in the coming months , we expect the market to be more sceptical about the programme .
bombardier hopes that the aviation crew of the cseries will be able to integrate the company into the lower market segment , which is currently being used by boeing and airbus .
the first test aircraft was presented to the public in march and flew to the united states for the first time in september after months of delay .
however , binding orders for the cseries have been moderated with 177 , as potential buyers are not yet ready to see the results of flight tests and whether the company ’ s claims regarding fuel efficiency and cost savings potential of the new jet are accurate .
currently there are 403 orders and commitments from 15 customers and companies .
board chairman pierre beaudoin is confident that bombardier will achieve its goal of 300 binding orders at the beginning of the commercial use of jet .
on thursday , the company management assured analysts and media that the program would be on schedule .
“ the test aircraft has not remained on the ground any longer than expected , ” said beaudoin at a telephone conference , adding that during the service of the aircraft ground tests and software updates were scheduled .
every manufacturer is planning differently .
we decided to take a first flight and then to renew the period , which we have done .
this is done throughout the entire flight programme .
the second of five test aircraft is expected to start in the next few weeks , the remaining shortly thereafter , it was said by the company side .
yet analysts remain skeptical as to whether 12 months after the maiden flight , the first customer will be able to start operating a cseries aircraft .
bombardier said that it would review the planning for the commissioning of the plant ( ice ) and will update it in the coming months .
“ the slow progress of the flight test – even though it seems to have been bombardier ’ s internal planning – reinforces our view that the commissioning period should be limited to the first quarter of 2015 , ” doersen said .
in the third quarter , with the end of september 30 , bombardier ’ s net profit fell to $ 147 million , or 8 cents per share of $ 172 million , or 9 cents per share , in the previous year .
the adjusted earnings per share is unchanged at 9 cents .
sales were slightly lower and the turnover fell from 4.2 to 4.1 billion dollars .
analysts had a profit of 10 cents per share and a turnover of $ 4.56 billion , so thomson reuters i / b / e / s .
the world &apos;s fourth largest aircraft manufacturer says that it has achieved 45 aircraft in this quarter , a drop of 57 in the last year .
net orders fell from 83 aircraft to 26 .
the order book in the aerospace division was expanded on 30 september 32.9 billion dollars , and was therefore up from 31 december .
“ in the aerospace sector , the results were within the limits of our specifications , but the low intake and market conditions as a whole were disappointing , ” said beaudoin .
sales in the aerospace sector of the aircraft industry fell by 13 percent to two billion dollars .
bombardier , the world &apos;s largest rail manufacturer , announced that sales in this sector were up by just under 11 % to $ 2.1 billion .
the order book in the transport division was 32.6 billion dollars on 30 september , representing a slight increase compared to 31 december .
the profit margin in the transport sector was increased by settlement problems in some major contracts .
according to corporate governance , the fourth quarter will have new benchmarks .
in the afternoon trading on thursday , the bombardier share increased by 8.5 % and was 4.83 canadian dollars after the announcement was made that the goodwill share was up to patrick picchette .
the brazilian embraer sa , the world &apos;s third largest commercial aircraft manufacturer and bombardier &apos;s closest rival , reported a 10 % increase in the quarterly profit on thursday .

coca-dependent lawyer , the drug boss , before police investigation , must be put in prison .
basharat ditta , 42 , gave information on subworld size neil scarborough further .
the lawyer was afraid of losing his secret drug addiction .
he was awarded the prize of the liverpool crown court for three years in prison .
a well-known criminal defender who has accused a drug baron of a major police investigation because he was afraid of losing his secret drug addiction .
basharat ditta , 42 , supplied subworld size neil scarborough with sensitive information on investigating the site &apos;s activities in drug trafficking , after being dissolved by his own cocaine addiction .
the “ first-class ” approach , praised by criminalists as “ first-class ” , with the nickname “ bash ” , was arrested in his house in 2011 , after the police had supervised scarborough , the drug advocate in a former drug department .
officials watched how scarborough ( 32 ) was able to cococaine three bags at the attorney &apos;s house in blackburn , lancashire , delivered to them during the meeting with colleagues on a meal of the bar .
the investigations revealed that ditta regularly uses drugs of class a .
over a period of eight months between january and august 2011 , he tried to disseminate unlawfully information on the arrest of two men on behalf of scarborough and one of his partners .
all four suspects were then taken over by the police in a major investigation into the heroin and cocaine trade in lancashire , cumbria , merseyside , berkshire and west .
together with 32 other people , they were arrested later , after the police had been arrested in a series of house searches , heroin and cocaine worth gbp 1.5 million and gbp 200,000 in cash .
ditta , 42 , gave information to the criminals because he feared that his drug addiction could become public .
today ditta , who is responsible for forbes solicitors law firm in blackburn , was born at liverpool crown court after a three-week period .
he made a previous survey of the cocaine .
the lawyer was transferred after the police had been involved in their investigations against scarborough .
two investigators followed the suspect and saddled him with the charges of ditta &apos;s house and the drugs with a pure purity of 60 % in a black golf glove under the carpet .
shortly after he had delivered the drugs , scarborough telephoned with ditta , who had been in the football stadium for dinner at blackburn rovers in ewood park .
the lawyer returned home , took his job and took the drugs and then received nine communications between the two .
it was known in court that ditta was a “ regular consumer ” of cocaine , after drugs of the class a were found in his hair , his stamp and on his credit cards at tests of class a .
ditta was later arrested , but withdrew from taking cocaine and said that he had been working with the alleged dealer because he had lost his client , and claimed that he had lost his discussion .
during his arrest , ditta took his wallet and tried to find a number of credit cards , but they were secured and he was given a sample of the hair .
in police interrogation , he stated that he was operating under his private address as well as in the workplace , and that clients would be prosecuting him at home for legal matters .
it was known in court that he was an important drug trader , some of whom he had previously represented , after significant arrests and informed what the results of the investigations were .
prosecutor anne whyte said : “ a criminal prosecutor should be better off than anyone else to know that the law is not broken . ”
ditta is accused of abusing his position as a criminal defender , because he is too concerned with certain clients .
the relationship in question is not simply that of a drug dealer , but of a drug dealer who has his lawyer with drugs .
part of his communications was undoubtedly legitimate , because he was the advocate of these people .
but that went far beyond the limits of a normal relationship between lawyer and client .
he was the first to investigate the police , so that they could continue to be subject to criminal activity .
mr ditta has thus discredited his profession .
he was too close to certain clients , especially scarborough , and he made it possible for his independence to be compromised .
ditta denounced any misconduct and claimed , “ if i was a corrupt lawyer , what i am not , and information to scarborough would be passed on , then i would not spend 15 hours waiting to do so . ”
but after the hearing , superintent lee halstead said from the police in lancashire : “ mr ditta took the step from a criminal defender to a criminal at the moment he started to attack .
his cocaine dependence led to a hopeless compromising and made him susceptible to the motives of leading members of organised crime who entrusted him with providing valuable information on police investigations .
lawyers must have the highest standards of integrity and be able to win public confidence and confidence .
ditta has lost this trust and has tried to hide behind the façade of his profession .
the serious and organized crime unit of lancashire leveraged the investigation of the disorder of ditta , which also led to a sentence in three cases for the possession of cocaine and disability of justice .
this case should be a warning to criminals and shows that no one is escape the arm of the law .
we find them and bring them to justice .
scarborough himself was sentenced to 14 years in prison after he had committed himself to the conspiracy of heroin , cocaine and cannabis .
thirty-five more people involved in the drug trade have been sentenced to overall fines of 153 years for drug offences .
ditta published on its website a section with questions and answers about itself , in which he indicated his dream job was to be considered a lawyer .
revolutionary work of church music
to finish the celebration on the occasion of its 160-year anniversary , dunningen ’ s song crane will perform two services with the &quot; german fair &quot; by franz schubert .
after the great success of the music &quot; rock my life &quot; , which attracted the audience this spring , the festival was held in the city of berlin .
on saturday , 26 october , this extraordinary exhibition will be held from 19 during the evening fair at st. martinskirche dunningen and on sunday 27 october , from 10th to 15th at the mass in the church of st. john .
the so-called deutsche messe with the original title &quot; singing for the celebration of the holy sacrifice of the fair &quot; , d 872 , is a spiritual music work of the composer franz schubert from 1826 .
the fair will be held in the context of the services of god , as the client johann philipp neumann intended .
under the direction of hermann schneider , the choir is performed by the group of the brass band of the musikverein freudenbronn and noemi lokodi at the organ .
haslach : skepticism is increasingly diminishing confidence .
the parish church council elections in 2015 will , for example , bring about a change in the haslach ( se ) ministry .
there is only one common parish council for all six parish travellers .
at a joint meeting on saturday , the bodies of haslach , hofstetten , mühlenbach , fischerbach , steinach and welschenstein prepared for the changes .
the fact is that the fundamental decisions of the diocese are no longer to be changed and the parish church councils are required to make them as satisfactory as possible .
during the day , it became particularly clear that the scepticism about the new is tentative , but increasingly tenuous .
from the ideas and expectations of the innovations in 2015 to concrete proposals on the future composition and size of the parish council , the new and extremely constructive discussions of the six bodies were sufficient with the main representatives of the saegre .
regional dean georg schmitt explained the new location of the devised guidelines for seafarers in the archdiocese of freiburg .
after that , the se haslach as a parish of the church will form a public body which will be incorporated into the rights and obligations of the six churches in the past .
there will only be a common parish council and a foundation council .
from each parish , at least two elected members should be represented , in the six parishes are represented locally so-called local teams .
their task will be to make church life in the place more visible .
on the question of the finances of the individual parish , there was a great need for discussion .
the innovations provide that collected data will be used in the parish and will be used for the purpose .
liabilities , on the other hand , extend to the entire community .
it is precisely in view of the major investments planned , the obligation of which then all parish people was met , that there was great concern .
&quot; even in the past , only projects that were supported by the individual parish people were invested .
practical experience with a joint body for five parish priests illustrated barbara ritter , the chairman of the board in the ministry of waste forest development .
in 2006 , they had set themselves the task of &apos; becoming one , remaining five &apos; and found that it was not so easy .
the bodies of haslach soulsorge then began to ask questions about the future composition and size of the common parish council and the practical work of the municipal teams .
the papers will be given in further meetings and will be presented at another joint meeting of all six bodies next spring .
in the end , the parish council michael schöner presented the new logo of the sailors &apos; association , which was approved by a clear majority .
in pfullendorf , the flow of expensive electricity is becoming more expensive .
the citizens of pfullendorf must adapt to higher electricity costs .
as the managing director of the stadtwerke , jörg-arne bias , confirmed to the south courier , a four-headed plumbing village family of 70 to 90 euros will incur additional costs per year .
the main reason for the upcoming price increase is the rise in the so-called eec levy of 5.277 to 6.3 cents per kilowatt-hour .
this levy is paid every october by the four operators of the large electricity routes .
these figures are the figures given to them by the energy change , which they will be able to bear through a charge on the electricity price .
the stadtwerke pfullendorf are the last link in this chain .
the supervisory board of the energy company was even affected by a higher levy in its forecasts , as jörg-arne bias reported .
now the actual figures would have to be calculated before the municipal plants next week inform their customers about the exact price increase .
&quot; we are starting from an increase of 1 cent plus x , &quot; says bias , with the number more near the 2 cent .
traffic lights on permanent red : on waiting time , please keep a close eye on the traffic lights .
sometimes a light is simply not green .
the contact loop in the street does not react , or the light sign is broken .
what should we do then - drive red ?
if a person concerned has worked long enough at a red light and the crossing is free , he can continue , the stop is explained .
the waiting time must be &apos; appropriate &apos; , which is a matter of different interpretation on a case-by-case basis .
becker advises that at least five minutes should be left out before any traffic light disturbs the system .
if you want to continue the journey despite red lights , you have to be aware that it is not responsible for an accident caused by it .
if you are less than five minutes away , you might not wait long enough , warn becker and point out a decision of the supreme court hamm .
in the case negotiated , a driver had to carry a permanent red light after about three minutes and had to choose a careless red light blast .
the traffic lights were not defective , but jumped to green a little later .
he was not allowed to drive because of the special situation - but the fine was not .
the municipal council is pleased with its sound budget and its support for the budget .
whenever there is a community meeting about the budget , civil servant ralph gerster has good laughter .
the municipal bag in herdwangen-schönnach is well filled and debt has not been known by the administration since 2005 .
the 2012 financial year can also be seen as a complete success in this respect .
this was confirmed when the annual accounts for 2012 were presented .
as andrea rothmund explained , the administrative budget is the largest in the european union , with around eur 7.6 million .
the administrative budget &apos;s surplus is also around eur 1.8 million , which is about eur 1 million above the level of the approach .
the surplus of the us , especially higher industrial tax revenues , and the municipal share of income tax , is to be owe this surplus .
the asset budget was also well above the planned values .
instead of the eur 1.5 million that was envisaged , it was eur 2.5 million last year .
&quot; this is mainly due to the higher level of the administrative budget &quot; , says rothmund .
since the 2012 financial year saw less investment than planned , it is also necessary to increase the reserve .
overall , the overall reserve was increased by around eur 2.1 million to a total of eur 4.9 million .
mayor ralph gerster thanked rothmund and her team for the good work they have done .
&quot; this is a work that you don &apos;t just shake out of the sleeve , &quot; gerster praised the annual accounts .
he and the local councils were obviously pleased with the good figures .
it may sound paradoxical , but it is these very good figures that could soon cost the public dearly .
the good financial situation has enabled the municipality to rely on high levels of liabilities .
but this in turn has often caused subsidies to the country , according to gerster .
the commission has proposed a new budget for these subsidies from various compensatory sticks .
among other things , the cities and municipalities that apply for subsidies must apply certain levies .
&quot; the subject of leverage we have to look at , as in the coming years there will be investment that we would like to have subsidies for , &quot; gerster announced in this context .
nagold : hugo wermter has been a singer for 60 years in the choir ’ s choir at the choral music hall of the german choir “ hugo wermter ” since 60 years .
at 60 years as a singer , hubert werter ’ s story is at the male vocalist cäcilia almost twice as long as that of the autumn festival , during which he was honoured .
hubert wermter was as usual in the colours of his male vocalist on stage .
after 60 years of singing with the now more than ever beloved chorus , he still enjoys it .
in the association wermter was also active , among others for 28 years as a member of the committee .
for his commitment and his loyalty , he received several awards : jörg kohr , pastoral referee on behalf of the cäcilia association rottenburg-stuttgart , handed over the award to him .
his singers presented him with the certificate of the german choral association and a gradual master of the tin plate .
in addition to the honor , the 31st autumn festival took place in the usual railway tracks : with the mgv betra , the song ring salzstetten , the singer department baisingen and the local music club .
the mgv vollmaringen opened its doors with atmospheric songs such as &quot; in the wine paradise &quot; and &quot; funny , your brethren &quot; .
your honorary singer hubert wermter prepared a small stand for your honour - wolfgang amadeus mozart &apos;s &quot; bundeslied &quot; .
the male singing club betra sang also classical choral songs like &quot; jägerwerben &quot; by julius wengert , &quot; far , far away &quot; by hubert goisern and the folk song &quot; .
the song ring salzstetten caused a lot of emotion with its mixed choir and its women &apos;s group - the impulse group - for the women &apos;s quota of the festival .
the mixed choir took the neapolitan folk song &quot; santa lucia &quot; and &quot; eviva españa &quot; by antos gus in foreign countries , while the &quot; impulse &quot; was also on the island .
the singers ’ department of the baisinger sportverein came with &quot; what isch der schwob ? &quot; by hans süssmuth and robert papperts &quot; beer song &quot; back into home movies .
for the children there was a small adjoining program - &quot; grandma hanne &quot; alias hannelore stolsteimer performed a kaspersky theatre and read a few stories that the children read about well at lunchtime .

kenyan press outraged at controversial media law
“ we are in a frightening situation and we must ask ourselves : what does parliament think of being simply going to judge the independence of the judiciary tomorrow ? ” , said the newspaper , which is violating the draft law .
“ the law is draconian and very punishable , and we reject it , ” said cyrus kamau , managing director of the capital group , to whom capital funds belong .
he said that the new media tribunal “ is always prejudiced , because it is an extended arm of government , ” and restrictions on content and advertising would be kenya ’ s position in the global economy .
“ i hope the president listens to us and we appeal to him to reject this draft law and to return to parliament , ” he said .
according to the star newspaper , the government is taking the media effectively into a stranglehold by means of the new law , whereas the standard , democracy , and freedom of speech in kenya would have suffered “ a heavy blow , ” and title .
the adoption of the law is one of a number of measures which will ensure national security in the wake of the attacks by armed islamists on the west gate shopping mall in september .
the kenyan media have been following the anger of the authorities for taking photographs of safety cameras that were supposed to be showing how the people who were kidnapped were supposed to be using the luxury shopping centre .
polizeichef david kimiyo responded by ordering two journalists and one leading media representative .
under the new law , media houses can be sold with a penalty of up to 20 million kenyan schillings and individual journalists can be charged with up to one million and the further risk of losing their professional recognition or being taken off from an official press release .
the tribunal also has the right to decide the possession of the persons concerned if a penalty is not paid .
according to daily nation , “ one punishment can kill most radio stations . ”
in addition , the newspaper believes that these measures could have a devastating effect on what they describe as “ lively blogosphere ” kenya .
if you silence the media , you could unleash politicians with impunity whatever you want .
“ no one will ever know , ” mutuma mathiu , journalist at the nation , wrote , who has been calling the kenyan media a decisive factor in public control .
“ if politicians are left to themselves , they are leading the country into bankruptcy and we are back to the hunters and collectors ’ era , ” he commented .
kenyan legislators have already in the past brought public anger .
in may , they voted to remove the costs imposed by the national compensation commission .

mayor klumpp reminded us that recurring weather conditions have caused the floods in the spring and autumn .
15 years ago , we had the first thoughts on solving the problem , when we were thinking about building a third place at the football club grounds or at the real school on the salinensee .
both of these have been dismissed .
six years ago , thoughts were put forward about creating an artificial turf , which is generally regarded as the ultimate solution .
concrete plans were made two years ago when the fc launched the schabelstube in lease , a cost contribution of eur 100 000 for the construction of the site and the country was funded by eur 104 000 .
the local council decided to open the new regional development cooperation agreement in october 2012 .

during the three-month construction phase , 3000 cubic meters of ground were deducted , half of which was used to build a dirt bike mile .

the threat was that the roads would be evaded on land roads , which are already the main areas of concern .
the introduction of a toll for all cars would be a very bad thing from the perspective of pronolds .
&quot; there is a danger that at a later stage compensation for german gm will be deleted , &quot; he said .

vienna airport makes passenger calls from the airport .
mr maier , please come to gate 24 .
how this will be done in future will be impossible at vienna &apos;s schwechat airport .
most of the loudspeaker failures are therefore gone - noise levels should be reduced so much .
a more relaxed atmosphere is the aim of this innovation .
as airport spokesman peter kleemann announced to radio wien , vienna airport is following with the suspension of cancellations affecting individuals , an international trend .
among other things , airports in copenhagen , frankfurt or dubai have already abandoned the noisy calls .
the elimination of these cuts - on average , at one day , around 200 personal calls from the loudspeakers - is intended to make it quieter at the airport in the future .
&quot; it has also been shown in experience that these individual failures are relatively little noticed , but at the same time all other information on changed flight paths or departure times has been a little underway here &quot; , says kleemann in .

sleepless in new york
on the way to their host families in weymouth , massachusetts , the students of the black forest school learned to live the american great city of new york .
after eight hours of flight , we went straight to brooklyn bridge , which was the heart of the city , manhattan , on foot .
there was already a fascinating view of the world famous skyline , which was built in the evening light and which attracted a special attraction .
the time shift has meant that students have been on their feet for almost 24 hours , but in true terms to the motto &quot; the city does not sleep &quot; , the day was decided on at times square .
despite shutdown , the release of the statue of liberty was reached on the second day by a ferry and climbed on foot .
then there was the financial center around wall street , where the 11th september memorial was held .
on the third day , the students were able to watch the 373 meters high observation platform of the empire-state building .
after that , the rush of new york ’ s streets went over the rockefeller center to central park , which was an ideal opportunity to stay for a while in the autumn sun .
after a short flight from new york to boston , students have now arrived in their host families and are living at the weymouth high school .
this year , the new year ’ s naming day of the holy hubertus will be held in the parish church of st. marien on hülsbergstraße .
st. hubertus was a pretty ruthless hunter , who was forced to live in a new state of affairs by a vision and later became the bishop of liège .
the hunting horn group of the hunting triple westphalia under the direction of brigitte kluth musiks on parforcehorns ( natural horns in the mood it ) according to old , originally french melodies .
the leaves wear riding clothes because they are mainly riders , horses and dogs .
the festive fair takes place on sunday , november 3rd , at 11.30 a.m.
the newly designed opschlag features a new cafe .
one that is suitable for a stay and to come back .
one that makes the name a program .
when déjà vu is called a psychologist phenomenon , it is the term that refers to the feeling that a new situation has already been experienced or seen .
in the case of the visit of the café of the same name at the opschlag in the district town of kleve in sight of the rhein-waal university , it does not have to remain a mere feeling of déjà vu .
finally , the café has the very purpose of this name : not only to make a real stay , but also to keep it alive , and to make it a real experience .
because it &apos;s fun and simply beautiful .
a look into the inner life at opschlag 8 gives the viewer a good feeling at first .
the state-of-the-art , but not cool , café ambience looks like a place to feel good .
here the team spoils with the founders mirjam van der stelt and daniel büttner at the top with various coffee and tea specialities .
there are delicious cakes or individually cooked fresh baguettes .
the owners , both 33 years old , have already registered themselves before the opening of the beautiful cafe at the opschlag as a gastronomic : in kranenburg they performed the &quot; art lounge &quot; .
from moving to kleve to opschlag , the friendly café-lovers hope to attract more audience .
the university of applied sciences is also the main focus of the project .
&quot; we don &apos;t have a specific target group , &quot; says daniel büttner .
rather , the two here young students want to address themselves in the same way as senior citizens and all ages in between .
speaking of cafe lovers .
the friendly owner couple is behind the coffee house .
enjoy the smell of hot browns in a variety of variations .
expresso
daniel büttner is more the expresso fan and mirjam van der stellt the cappuccino drinker .
&quot; in addition , a baguette - that is my thing &quot; , reveals it to the nod .
two events were also held in the bright café .
better said one .
the port festival took place outside - the café déjà vu profited from it .
but there was also the ringelnatzevening .
&quot; beautiful , successful and funny &quot; , the two 33-year-olds found .
but it is not everyone &apos;s business .
perhaps daniel büttner is not a big fan of event-abendas : &quot; you can &apos;t do it now !
and with an event i always speak only to those who are also interested in the special event .
therefore , events will be the exception .
&quot; we want to keep the normal operation as little as possible &quot; .
should it be said : déjà vu also stands for reliability .
as regards the quality of the products offered here , as well as the team and the beautiful surroundings at the opschlag in kleve .
the road that is becoming more and more a gastronomic mile .
to the delight of many klever , the guests from near and far and the students who want to visit the restaurant and hence the café déjà vu for themselves .
anke gellert helpenstein
a day of thanks at the mgv in dinker .
it was the 165th anniversary of the foundation of the &quot; friedrich wilhelm dinker &quot; mgv , which was held this year and attracted 52 guests , active singers and their wives .
the restaurant is located in the club lounge of witteborg in dinker , and all of them enjoyed the harmonious coexistence in the name of music .
traditionally , the foundation festival is also the right festival to be honoured .
the special award &quot; singer of the year &quot; was a great pleasure for rolf wagener this time .
&quot; you have not only written a lot for us , but also have had some rounds for us , and we thank you very much for that , &quot; says the chairman of the choir erich schlotmann .
the awards for participation in the performances and choir samples by means of activity programmes are received in this year .
the first time in the world , the world cup was held in the united states .
a particularly thankful note was sent by the board to the team of vereinswirtin ange ange pier-ribbert , who once again had enchanted a menu of extra class and sent to gerda pier-ribbert for table decoration .
the mgv &quot; friedrich-wilhelm &quot; meets on its regular choral samples every tuesday at 19.45 in the association hall .
&quot; new sounding voices are welcome at any time &quot; , schlotmann said .
un announces new objectives in the fight against poverty .
the united nations is starting to draw up a series of new objectives , which will be able to achieve the millennium development goals announced 12 years ago to combat poverty .
in the run-up to the un summit on sustainable development , which was held in rio de janeiro in the evening , australian diplomats played a key role in pushing for “ sustainable development goals ” that will end the millennium goals in 2015 .
they were included in the final draft of the document prepared by world leaders , including mrs gillard , at the summit .
un secretary-general ban ki-moon said in the evening at the summit that the time has come to think “ beyond national interests . ”
“ i am pleased that the member states have agreed to adopt a process that will enable us to achieve universal standards of sustainable development .
“ these goals are based on our progress in the millennium development goals and will form an integral part of the framework for the post-2012 development .
i will spare no effort to make this proposal , which i have been given by the member states , a reality to support our vision of sustainable development objectives , which are based on the success of the millennium goals . ”
even though sg achim / baden has been without victory for four days , the handball upper league continues to be in good mood .
this is where the coach tomasz malmon leaves no doubt about this .
all of them are still fully motivated .
however , i hope that we will finally win again .
&quot; i don &apos;t know how to make a victory anymore &quot; , says malmon , a successful candidate for the european union &apos;s team in the vfl fredenbeck ii .
even though the third liga reserve of fredenbeck is not currently producing trees , it is still a fact that malmon is raising warning beforehand about the pointing finger .
i have a lot of players i have trained in a youth .
they will therefore vote against their ex-coach in particular .
&quot; it is also important to see whether there is any strengthening from the first one , &quot; the sg-coach illustrates .
in order to finally return to the mire of success , the malmon team must be very careful in comparison with previous performances .
above all , in the area of cover work and switching , the last thing that happened was enormous .
the exploitation of opportunities must also definitely be improved .
i hope that my players will be able to keep their heads free during the short break .
security concerns in mozambique are growing in the face of clashes between influential figures and political leaders .
thousands of people gathered in the centre of maputo under the watchful eyes of the statue of samora machel , the founder and first president of mozambique , to speak with one voice in a rare public demonstration .
“ we want peace again , we want stability , ” said vanessa de sousa , managing director of an investment company .
fearful of the country ’ s future , she has tied her business clothes against a t-shirt with the label “ we demand safety ” in portuguese and joined the crowd on thursday on the independence square of the capital .
for two weeks now , there have been almost daily reports of clashes between government forces and renamo , which have been one of the worst battles since the peace agreement more than 20 years ago .
renamo was once a notorious rebel movement , initially led by white rulers of rhodesia and later by apartheid government in south africa .
after the 1992 peace treaty , it became an opposition party .
analysts think it unlikely that the country will return to a full-blown conflict , but the recent events have left foreign investors and domestic residents worried .
for the rapidly growing economy , there is a lot at stake , because the discovery of huge gas deposits off the coast and coal deposits in the northwest could lead to investment of more than $ 50 billion from companies like rio tinto .
the ruling frelimo-party , since 1975 the dominant force , and renamo are giving each other the blame for tensions .
renamo claims that the government has provoked recent clashes by sending its members to the province of sofala , a traditional stronghold of renamos , on 17 october .
the attacks on the former rebels escalated as government troops renamo bases , and the attacks on the former rebels escalated .
the government blames renamo for the clashes and accuses the organization of attacking soldiers .
president armando guebuza has tried to reduce concerns about instability .
compared to afp , the french news agency , he said on wednesday that dhlakama is a “ loser . ”
both frelimo and renamo emphasize that they want to avoid war .
but concerns have increased since mazanga began to quote words that renamo was not the peace agreement of 1992 .
in order to achieve this , he said to the ft that frelimo had no longer respected the agreement .
“ our vision is to restart negotiations , and to do so seriously , ” said mazanga .
earlier discussions between the parties have done little to resolve the tensions caused by a series of clashes this year .
“ we have two adult men ( guebuza and dhlakama ) here who have gathered together the heads , ” says joseph smith hanlon , dozent at the open university and mosambik university .
none of them are good negotiators and none are prepared to make the necessary concessions .
renamo , who is pressing for electoral reforms , has already stated that it will boycott the november local elections .
presidential and parliamentary elections are scheduled for next year .
some commentators have mentioned the use of force as an attempt by a ailing movement to make concessions and financial concessions from the government .
renamos electoral success has been shrinking since 1992 , while a newer party , led by a former renamo member , has been a party that has been running the democratic movement of moçambique ( mdm ) .
mazanga claims that guebuza – the resignation of his second term in office ends next year – is the destruction of the country ’ s democracy .
“ he does not want a multi-party democracy , he does not want transparent elections , he does not want peace , because he does not want to give up the presidency , ” mazanga says .
it is unclear what capacity renamo has , but it has caused anxiety attacks on police stations and vehicles on an important north-south link .
most of the battles took place in the province of sofala , which was a few hundred kilometres north of maputo , but which is located in beira , the port , the mining companies such as rio tinto and vvi .
in june rio interrupted the use of the railways for a month after renamo launched an attack on the track .
mazanga responded cautiously to the question of whether renamo would repeat this threat .
renamo wanted to warn the international community that things are going wrong in mozambique , ” said mazanga .
instability has fuelled frustration with the government , says fernando lima , head of mediacoop , a independent media company , because many people are anxious about the corruption that has occurred .
“ people think that the government and the president are crucial to the country ’ s future and that he should be the one who can find solutions to the problems , ” he explains .
omar sultane , a demonstrator , said that people simply wanted stability .
“ no one is interested in renamo and frelimo , they simply want to rebuild peace and usable streets , ” he said .
children should learn myths and legends as “ models for life . ” they say , “ an author .
the stories of thor showed that “ brutal force has no chance of defeating clever tricks , ” and the artus legend demonstrates how important it is to have a dream .
many of the myths , however , are “ far too wild , too offensive , and in some cases too dirty to be taught in schools . ”
“ i find it wonderful that in america myths and folklore are already part of education , ” he said .
i have been calling for this as a plan for twenty years .
he added that the authors and teachers who “ know too didactically ” are not interested in children being “ completely disconnected , ” because in entertaining stories , the bottle of “ underscored ” would be conveyed .
crossley holland , the beowulf from the anglo-saxon language and author of the penguin book of northern myths and the british folk tales is , explained : “ you can &apos;t do it .
perhaps the biggest difference between an adult author writing for adults and a writer who is responsible for children is that he is not a child .
not everything needs to be simplified or lead to the happy end , but there is an immanent sense of good and evil .
this must be undermined , through history revealed , and not explained .
this is the old story of showing rather than telling .

his criticism of the church of the assumption was also expressed at the time by hansjakob , as was his concern about the excesses of agriculture , the consequences of industrialization or the effects of war .
in the home garden , behind its tomb chapel on fire near hofstetten , he found his retirement .
&quot; a restless spirit had finally found its peace and had gone home forever , &quot; he said at the end of the scene game .
many applause and many laudable words were heard from the audience for the performance .

in addition to the eon power plant on the ground , the import coal goes to power plants in the inland .
if you add the gdf-suez power station to the network , a good 5 million tonnes of coal imports per year are realistic .
the three ship loaders on the bridge and the second transport belt could create up to 10 million .

ben greenman : ten years new york comedy festival : the new yorker festival : the new york comedy festival : the new yorker
one could say that new york city was the birthplace of stand-up comedy in america : a few hundred years ago , the variegated artist frank fay began to work as a conférencier in the palace .
over the years , fay &apos;s innovation has been developed , as was the case at the new york comedy festival .
founded and directed by caroline hirsch , founder of the stand-up institution carolines , feierte is celebrating its 10th anniversary this year .
“ most of these headliners began to work with carolines and became more and more successful until they eventually became known to be in a club . ” he said .
we have designed this festival so that we can continue working with you .
this year &apos;s event will be accompanied by performances by wanda sykes , kathy griffin and bill maher , as well as by the stand up for heroes , an annual music and comedy show .
the festival also brings the world of comedy to life .
a number of the comedians who will be attending the festival this year are known about unconventional ways , such as broadcasts on smaller television channels such as comedy central , fx and spike .
nick kroll was awarded a sitcom on cable television ( the ironic-keypadded fantasy football series “ the leader ” ) on fxx .
jenny slate was a member of the “ saturday night live ” and of “ parks and recreation ” .
both kroll and slate and other young comedians with characteristic voices ( the surreal pessimistic anthony jeselnik , the ironic , on racial issues ) .
the biggest visitors to the festival include a interactive exhibition : david steinberg talks with larry david .

&quot; after years , an agreement has been reached with the international atomic energy agency to resolve the differences of the last few years , &quot; said foreign minister mohammed jawad sharif .

drama in uruguay : young kill playchambers with machete and the other children .
two children have died in uruguay from the murder of a 11-year-old .
the two 14 and 12 year-old boys invited their victim to come to the camp with them .
with machetes and knives , they invade the 11th anniversary of the battle on tuesday and threw the corpse into a well , reporting the newspaper &quot; el país &quot; on thursday .
they should have been able to walk football in front of their homes in a working-class district .
the corpse was thrown into the village of cerro pelado , 15 kilometres north of the exclusive resort of cerro pelado , 15 kilometres north of the beach .
as an alibi , a five-year half-sister of the younger one , who took her with her , should say that she was sexually attacked by the young .
but when the girl was beaten up in front of the police without mentioning an attack on her , the two boys gave the deliberate killing of the 11-year-old .
the older man , among other reasons , called a rivalry in football .
it was provisionally converted into a psychiatric youth institution .
pimps must be put in prison
because of exploitative human trafficking , pimps , threats , insults and dangerous bodily injury , the district court of konstanz has sentenced a 33-year-old man from st. georgen to three and a half years in prison .
the former german armed soldier who was killed after two operations in afghanistan was still in prison as part of a process agreement .
so in five cases he has informed women about internet or telephone contacts , who he has had to fight against their will in the end after a few weeks .
he used force and threats to break resistance .
the income of women who have been earning money for some years for him has been maintained .
confiscation of mobile phones and sim cards undercut female contacts to the outside world .
together with a colleague who sent women , he brought them to various borders. in the south-west , he was a member of the committee on women &apos;s rights and equal opportunities .
there he had some monitoring of them to control their revenue .
the accused claimed in court that he was suffering from a severe trauma after colleagues in afghanistan had been killed beside him in an explosion .
after a psychiatric expert had serious doubts about the mental constraint and thus about a limited liability , he was able to find out that the 33-year-old had made a comprehensive confession .
the court did not have to hear any of the women who were injured .
as a cripo official reported , after a first ad by telephone surveillance agencies , at least four more cases of exploitative trafficking were recorded .
the tapped talks were of great aggression .
in subsequent interrogations , the injured parties would have confirmed their martyrdom .
another witness in which one of the women in the whole body has discovered blue spots has still not heard a statement .
it is a &apos; totally broken personality &apos; , which is a crime against violence and exploitation in this animal as normal .
the accused regretted his behaviour yesterday .
&quot; he has been dissolved from these circles and wants to be a normal life after imprisonment , &quot; he said .
oil prices continue to drop to $ 96 per barrel .
the price of oil continued to fall on friday , after worries about a high supply overshadowed a report that says that china ’ s energy-hungry manufacturing sector is growing .
the reference crude oil variety for deliveries in december was in europe in the late morning in electronic trading at the new york mercantile exchange at 14 cents on 96.24 usd .
the contract fell by 39 cents on thursday , causing a price drop of 5.8 percent in october .
the large supply of crude oil has increased prices in recent weeks .
the us department of energy stated on wednesday that the us supply rose by 4.1 million barrels last week .
over the course of five weeks , the offer has risen by 25 million barrels .
but on friday there was evidence of greater demand through two reports of an increase in activity in chinese manufacturing .
this suggests a continued recovery in china ’ s economy , whose growth is expected to be 7.8 % in the third quarter , after the previous year ’ s growth in the lowest level since two decades .
crude oil from brent , a reference value for international crude oil , which is also used by us refineries .
court blocks decision to stop and frisk the nypd &apos;s directive .
a federal appeals court in the united states blocked the order of a judge to make changes to the stop order on thursday .
the 2nd us court of appeal stated that the decisions of judge shira schaldlin were suspended until a court of appeal had been made .
the judge ordered the death sentence in august , but the city was not allowed to do so by the way the programme for the anhalting and questioning of persons was implemented .
the city appealed against its assessment and the ordered remedies , including the decision to establish a supervisory authority .
the court of appeal heard the arguments on tuesday about the request for suspension .
the appeal report stated that judge jimmy was to be exempt from the case because she had not adopted the code of conduct for us judges , specifying that a judge would appear to be partisan ;
the judge had judged that police officers were injured in the civil rights of tens of thousands of people because they were inappropriately targeted at black and latin american men with the stop call .
she appointed an external monitoring body to monitor the implementation of major changes , including reforms of directives , training and service supervision , and ordered a pilot programme with the body to be carried cameras .
in august , new york city agreed to reconsider the practice of storing names and addresses of people who were seeking control by the police .
an oral hearing on the vocation of the city is scheduled after 14 march 2014 .
the stop and frisk tactic has been adopted by a number of civil rights defenders .
such controls have been in place for decades in various forms , but the number of checks recorded during the term of office of the biased mayor michael bloomberg rose to an all-time high of 684.330 in 2011 , most of which was in 2011 ,
in 2004 , four men from all minorities were brought to the court , who committed themselves to a collective action .
advocates of changes to the stop and frisk program say that the changes will be unfair , and that the change will lead to a more trustworthy and effective police force , as well as influence the way other police officers are treated .
opponents believe that the changes would undermine the police ’ s morality , but not criminality ; nor would money be wasted and the broader problem of a police force that is forced to take over after thousands of jobs have been dropped over the last decade .
the judge pointed out that she had failed to complete the stop and hairdressing practice .

coulson continued telephone hacking to check a tip .
the previous news of the word editor andy coulson allegedly put “ telephone hacking , monitoring , and confrontation ” on the attempt to get a wrong tip about an affair of the then minister of the interior .
prosecutor andrew edis qc told the court in the old bailey that news of the world had a false rumour in may 2005 that the clarke was a relationship with his “ attractive special advisor . ”
the newspaper commissioned the private detective glenn mulcaire to investigate pawlby &apos;s voicemails , and persecuted them , but colosson ripped them too .
“ the public prosecutor believes that coulson , who is now the editor of the notw , is no one who stands in front of the home of people and hopes to seize it in a fresh way , but one who is the people .
he said notw uses three methods to make stories investigative .
the publisher is personally involved in the third method .
he is obviously aware of the second , of monitoring , otherwise it cannot be .
what about the first ?
does he know about telephone hacking ?
he is denying that , but we say , “ and whether he knew about it . ”
rumors of a clarke affair were first published by the feature editorial team of notw , as a source of sexual abuse to pawlby .
a band with voicemails from your phone of at least three occasions was released in august 2006 in mulcaires apartment .
the investigators also found entries on the detective &apos;s computer , on which pawlby and her sister were described as “ projects . ”
at the time when the research was going , the large parents were given a new life as a gift to pawlby , where they were asked for information about them .
meanwhile , former chief secretary general zemat neville thurlbek and the former chief editor of the united states supervised the operation of the united states ’ movements .
on 18 june 2005 , coulson left her a voicemail with the following content : “ i have a story that we will release tomorrow , about which i would like to talk with charles . ”
edis explained that coulson ’ s activities in this story followed the same pattern as other important personalities , such as former interior minister david blunkett .
the sworn heard on thursday that coulson blunkett had to wait for an affair with a married woman when he himself was dealing with the co-defendant rebekah brooks .
coulson and brooks argue that they should be consigned to others , between 3 october 2000 and 9 august 2006 , and that they should hack phones .
mulcaire , thurlbeck and weatherup have the telephone hacking system admitted .
in protest against the proposed reich tax , the french football will indeed be the first strike since 1972 .
a conciliation meeting will have no effect .
in the conflict over the wealth tax , the government and the professional football in france have been following a failed shame .
president françois hollande received a visit to the paris élysée palace on thursday , but he was not heard of it .
he refused to accept the football of the planned world cup 75-percent .
the other side , too , remained hard .
the plan for the strike announced at the end of november will now be carried out , as the head of association of professional clubs ( ucpf ) , jean-pierre louvel , has announced .
the conference of presidents , scheduled for 29 november and 2 december , in ligue 1 and ligue 2 , will therefore be closed .
gechinen : no absolute protection possible .
&quot; we want to involve the inhabitants in planning early on , &quot; mayor jens häusler opened the civic information event on the flood protection concept in gechingen .
around 80 participants were present in the municipal hall to view the planned measures , ask questions and ask questions .
häßler made it clear : &quot; the ultimate decisions are made by the members of the municipal council &quot; .
the floods that hit the country on 15 may 2009 , unprepared , were a serious and tragic event , which caused the question of protection measures for the future .
a river basin investigation was conducted with the neighbouring aidlingen municipality , which is now the basis of the flood protection concept in gechingen .
&quot; the protection of as many built-in plots as possible is the goal , &quot; says häusler .
the basis of this is the planning of the protection against any 100 years of forecasts expected by the german weather service .
climate change is being offset by a 15-percent surcharge .
this is described in professional circles as &quot; hq 100aklima &quot; .
the water masses that were to be found in gechingen in 2009 were a 1000-year-old flood .
&quot; there is no absolute protection , but a relative improvement we can achieve &quot; , says häßler .
to protect the hq 100aklima , you must have a minimum of four million euros invested in chefs , with the municipality receiving state aid of around eur 70 per cent .
but he pointed out that there is a need to promote only if a total concept is implemented .
to this end , the community must be dependent on the participation of the citizens .
a complex planning and approval process is not enough .
in the best case scenario , the implementation could start in 2016 .
among other things , the protection concept , which was already discussed last week in the municipal council ( we reported ) , provides for local measures in the influx of the irm from the valley of the river irm .
following the presentation of the flood protection concept , participants took the opportunity to submit their concerns .
among other things , it has been questioned as to why more dams and restraint systems were not planned to protect the site .
gregor kühn , technical planner of the commissioned engineering office wald and corbe from hügelsheim , who presented the concept , stressed that it needs the interaction of all the presented measures to achieve the desired sum .
furthermore , it is necessary to find the most economic solution , according to joachim wald von wald and corbe .
discontent was felt in altort ’ s anchors , who were still in trouble , even in normal storm conditions , with the channel network being overloaded .
the problem is known about the administration and initial measures have already been taken .
but he pointed out that the directives on canalsystems are different , but they are not applicable to flood protection and they are not to be mixed .
the municipality is obliged to interpret the channel network in such a way that two-to three-year regeneration events could be enforced .
the sewage channels greater than the amount of waste would swallow millions .
the most serious injured after collision
in the early friday afternoon , 44 people were killed on provincial road 44 near revensdorf , in a frontal collision .
the police immediately closed the road completely , but could not help the accident .
however , there are various testimonies that need to be evaluated first .
it is clear that the 19 year-old handleman of a vw golf was driving towards revensdorf and the 38-year-old gettorf man was watching her with his hyundai .
both vehicles clashed , with the woman so hard to hold up that the fire department almost half a hour .
the actual cause of the accident was initially left unclear .
both of these were injured in nearby hospitals .
the route remained full for about two hours .
it could be called the dostoevsky of the united states .
philip k. dick was a godviewfinder , a metaphysicist , his novels and stories also have something serial .
amazingly the relativity in the outer world : the axial eyes , beard , high forehead .
and as fjodor m. dostojewski , with his massive oeuvre as a founder and apologeist of the russian soul , reads the philip k. dieck as an american prophet .
some titles are published in heyne verlag , the haffmans cassette with the 118 stories distributes two-thousandths .
dick explains america - the realm of breathtaking technological progress , coupled with paranoia , security delusion , and the belief that he is chosen .
dick had worship experiences , his late books read like a mixture of revelation of john and a computer manual .
perhaps he was crazy , drugs had added to his brain .
he has captured , early on , that the computers are divinity .
he wrote a theology of the computer and asked what a person would be different from a machine that creator would be from his creature .
this is the &quot; blade runner &quot; problem .
killing them .
a master of science fiction .
a fantastic writer .
his stories have attracted film directors such as ridley scott , paul verhoeven and steven spielberg .
this story is now particularly significant .
the &apos; minority report &apos; comes from 1956 , and it is a report of the smell of the cold war and the mccarthy tribunal .
the principle of &apos; pre-crime &apos; is being developed here , &apos; pre-crime &apos; , that is , what has more or less become official doctrine of the white house .
in dick &apos;s world , which resembles our own frighteningly , mutants look to the future - and the police are cracking .
&quot; we collect individuals who violate no law at all , &quot; says the head of the authority .
&quot; we snapshot you before you commit a violent crime &quot; .
and : &quot; in our society there are no serious criminals , for which we have a punisher full of pesudo-criminals &quot; , they read time flows .
they assume that the worst is happening and prevent the criminal from being brought into the real world .
dick &apos;s narration works like the blueprint for the anti-terrorism laws and the eavesdropping of the nsa .
anticipation of attack : this is how obama ’ s drown philosophy and practice works .
but dick &apos;s story is not over yet .
the chief of police complains that there is no separation of powers .
then the monitor itself is monitored and a future crime is committed .
the system is turning .
it is perfect , but it is lying .
it is inventing its own preconditions .
if errors and victims are not only accepted , but are based on them .
the system creates the danger it is fighting .
philip k. dick read is saying , time and again , to get closer to the truth .
late office at merkel in russia
the former us intelligence expert edward snowden has the potential to be the most effective in the us post-haffarist around chancellor angela merkel in his russian asylum .
representatives of the german federal attorney could either ask questions in writing or personally send questions to the 30-year-old in russia , the agency reported interfax .
previously , the federal green mep , hans-christian ströbele , was the first german politician to introduce snowden in moscow yesterday to discuss the affair with him .
nsa revelations strengthen corporate paranoia for government surveillance and control .
on a mild day at the end of august , a german police helicopter flew deep across the us consulate in frankfurt am main , germany ’ s financial capital .
at the request of the federal office for constitutional protection and counter-terrorism ( bvt ) , the german internal security service , he should be the roof of the us foreign post , which is less than 5 km away from the european central bank .
according to the german media , the bvt wanted to ban the presence of surveillance antennas and the action led to a change of words between the usa and the german foreign ministry in berlin .
james clapper , us director of national intelligence , insisted on the need to reconsider the us in september ’ s ability to estimate its foreign spying “ to curb foreign companies ’ business secrets on american orders . ”
but since edward snowden , who was a whistleblower , the former worker , with the publication of his corpse to us surveillance secrets , we have been aware of european governments and business leaders .
reports that the us national security agency has been supporting brazilian oil company petrobas spying out and collecting data from american cloud operators , including google and yahoo .
the bottle was disclosed , the animal was dissolved and the woman was given a telephone call .
if the most powerful person in europe can target , then surely the business leaders will also be potential targets .
snowden has been working hard with us intelligence agencies and companies .
i believe it is conceivable that this data could be used for mutual benefit .
“ germany must wake up , ” explains oliver grün , president of the bitmi , who is a german company representing small and medium-sized it companies .
german companies believe that the us has now taken almost as much risk as china in terms of industrial espionage and data theft as it has done in the us in july .
in the snowden leaked documents , however , there has been no evidence so far that the us has not yet fully recognised the business secrets of foreign companies to its own companies .
politicians have expressed concern that the eu is deprived of certain it and internet facilities and that they are reducing their dependence on the us .
companies are sceptical about this .
the bundestag has proposed that we should build a german google .
i can only close my eyes and reopen them slowly ...
“ that ’ s not working , ” says hasso plattner , chairman of the german software manufacturer sap .
if you want a strong european it industry , you would not have expected it 20 years ago .
everything in germany is subsidised , coal , cars and oil are subsidised .
everything except the it industry .
nevertheless , reach and technical refinement of the snowden designs have not changed the way the us spies revealed .
cloud computing has undergone a major change because european company leaders are now more aware that in the us stored data of local companies are not being subject to their jurisdiction and are therefore potentially at risk .
according to a statement published by the cloud security alliance , a trading institution , the commission has warned that the risk of fraud was being committed following the revelations of us data mining activities .
jim snabe , deputy managing director of sap , says : “ we see a new issue for customers who want to have it a year ago – they are : where are my data stored and can they guarantee it ?
many german corporate leaders believe that the latest reports simply confirm what they are anyway .
the fact that economic espionage is taking place is no surprise .
that has always been the case .
“ it was a topic for many years and has not fundamentally changed through the current discussion , ” says kurt bock , chairman of the chemical company basf .
the americans are spying on us at commercial and industrial level , as we are doing , because it is not in the national interest to defend our companies .
the company ’ s management usually does not boast of the countermeasures that have been taken , because that gives an advantage to attackers .
in large companies , employees have been involved for a long time , and the use of a free usb stick on a trade show or unguarded deck of a laptop in the hotel room is not advisable , to say the least .
ulrich hackenberk , member of the executive board of audi , says that for years it has been a standard practice to be the handset before a board meeting , so that it does not become a tapping device .
the german bvt advises managers to use simple prepaid phones to make use of the phone when travelling abroad , because smartphones may be compromised .
the prepaid phones will be discarded afterwards .
there is , however , concern that small and medium-sized enterprises may be vulnerable to hacking and surveillance .
in germany , many of these companies are global market leaders in their respective niches .
“ small and medium-sized enterprises often lack the experience , the staff and financial resources to effectively combat business secrets against unauthorised access , ” says the bvt in a report .
the us warns its own companies about espionage by other countries .
according to washington post , the us national intelligence estimate in february sent france , russia , and israel to second place behind china , with the countries that joined the us to obtain economic data for the hacking .
a member of the board of directors of a german blue chip company agreed to the commission &apos;s proposal when it comes to espionage , then “ the french are the worst . ”
bernard squarcini , former head of the french civil service dcrl , was arrested this month in an interview with zitiert : “ the secret services know very well that all countries , even if they are fighting .

parents of a georgian teenager who was born in a tragic accident were to believe in murder and murder .
the teenagers ’ parents , whose body is in a rolled ringermat in the gym of his high school , are convinced that the body is being murdered , explained the angel .
kendrick johnson from valdosta in the state of georgia was born in a upright maat on january 11 , which was held behind the grandstand in the school gym .
the sheriff ’ s investigators at lowndes county came to the conclusion that johnson was not able to do anything in the event of a tragic accident , which was not the case for the 17-year-old family .
“ they are convinced that their son was murdered , ” benjamin crump , the lawyer of kenneth and jacquelyn johnson , said to foxnews.com.
they would never have believed that he had died as the sherirff had .
“ they believe that it is devoid of logic to violate the laws of physics as well as common sense .
rather , they are convinced that the truth is being concealed to protect the person or person who is responsible for the death of their son .
&quot; her son went to school to learn and came to the hospital , &quot; commented .
us prosecutor michael moore said on thursday that there will be a formal investigation into johnson &apos;s death , because a number of important questions remain unresolved .
what was the cause of death ?
is his death due to a crime ?
this is what moore said at a press conference on thursday afternoon .
i follow the facts of the direction in which they are heading .
my aim is to find out the truth .
“ i believe that a sufficient number of member states have a basis for a formal investigation , ” he said .
moore explained to reporters that the initial autopsy suggests that the first thing he was doing is to work on the consequences of a “ position-related depression . ”
a second autopsy , however , has caused another death cause , moore said .
“ there are a number of questions that need to be answered or confirmed , ” he said .
moore added , if there is sufficient evidence of criminal prosecution or civil prosecution , that he was dead .
a representative of the county sheriffs was waiting for our request on thursday to be able to comment immediately .
a dish in southern georgia ordered the death of the king of georgia on wednesday .
the teenagers ’ parents said they hoped that the video recordings contained evidence of how he died .
cdc publish allergic guidelines for schools and other institutions .
on wednesday , the centers for diabetes control and control ( csr ) published a review of the european union &apos;s policy on the treatment of food allergies in schools .
these are the first such directives that the us government has issued , as the number of compulsory schoolchildren is growing with food allergies .
one in 20 children in the united states has a food allergy .
the spread of food allergies among children has increased by more than 18 % between 1997 and 2007 , according to the cdc .
the guidelines contain information for schools that are not yet aware of food allergies in the teaching body and the staff and how to deal with children who suffer from allergic reactions .
it is also recommended that schools epinephrin have in stock – the auto injection of the brand epipen is most commonly used – to avoid a potentially deadly oversensitivity trap .
the legislators in the states have recently amended the rules so that schools epinephrin can keep them in a more simple way .
the report also lists typical symptoms that have been mentioned by children who have a allergic reaction .
children may say , “ it feels as if something had been written on my tongue , ” “ my tongue feels at home , as if a hair is on it ” or “ my tongue is cribbing ” .
parents of intersexual children can “ get undetermined ” sex .
germany is the first european nation to have a third sex for children , who are living with unclear genitals .
newborn children will no longer be stardly male or female .
under the new law , parents no longer have to declare sex for such children , but can be “ vague ” or “ not fixed ” on the birth certificate .
the aim of the law is to take the pressure of parents so that they do not have to take hasty decisions regarding sexual access operations in new births .
an intersexual person said , according to bbc years later , “ i am neither man nor woman . ”
i remain the patchwork that has been created by doctors , mutilated and full of scars .
it is estimated that one in two thousand children every year do not come to the world either as young or as girls .
they are intersexual , a group that is diagnosed with the ‘ sexual differential disorder ’ ( dsd ) .
valais simpson was perhaps intersexual .
understanding gender identification is still not very good developed , but we do not believe that most experts in the us should be allowed to use the best available information on gender allocation , if a provision is not possible , and not on the basis of gender .
the new york psychiatrist dr. jack drescher , who focuses on the problem of gender identification , said that the new german law “ klinge after a good thing ” .
intersexual children are an ethical dilemma .
“ some people have life-threatening diseases that require surgical intervention , but they are not enough for most children . ”
you can not assign a gender without surgery and then wait for the identity to develop .
the scientific data on how a child can actually develop its gender identity are not very accurate .
no one knows why it is happening .
it is like the secret , why people are homosexual .
in a report to the european commission in 2011 , it is stated that intersexual people are excluded from transsexual or transgender persons .
these characteristics were reflected in secondary sexual characteristics .
the report also gives an overview of the discrimination that intersexual and transgender persons face in their professional lives and about the extent of the harassment they suffer , violence and prejudice .
not in line with the gender picture , boys now have a special camp .
meanwhile , australia and nepal allow adults to access official documents by male , female , or “ third ” .
in june , australian norrie may-welby ( 52 ) was the first “ sexless ” person in the world to be recognized after a court ruled that a “ undefined ” gender status should be maintained for life .
german passports will have a third assignment , x for intersexuals , in addition to m and w , so the ministry of the interior .
in neighbouring france , gender issues are still controversial .
in 2011 , dozens of french members of the strictly catholic country signed a petition that “ gender theory ” was made out of school books .
the us website catholic online has also spoken out against the german law , on the grounds that “ if the world is in a new state , where gender is a choice , sexual orientation is a decision , but not sexual activity , then ”
the mother of a newborn from maryland declared to baby zone that she would be better off if babies were to be a sex at birth .
&quot; being parents is also a necessity without further restrictions .
children need stability and security .
historically , children who had been treated with both male and female sexual subjects were often deprived of their right to education and to study in the same way as attractive greek god who had both sexes .
ten years ago , medicine regarded gender as something that was not seen as a threat to the future and could then be rebuilt .
but now the ethical foundations of an operation are being called into question , as we know how complex the gender identity is , and that doctors are also being misled because they do not know how to treat the child when it grows up with the child .
“ in the middle of the 20th century , one was called the psychiatric emergency , ” says drescher .
when such a child was born , it was not the psychiatrist , but the surgeon .
the prevailing theory of the treatment of children with unclear genital status dates back to dr. john money of johns hopkins university , who has argued that the gender of the child is formable .
he defined the term “ gender identity ” and argued that social and environmental issues are not the only causes of the problem – as parents raise a child .
but , in a report entitled “ john / joan ” from the year 1966 , his theories were controversial .
he called the parents of a boy whose penis is not allowed to drink when they are pledged , but he told them to castrate the child and to keep his teeth out and then to teach him up as girls .
&quot; money presented this case as a successful example of a transformation , which he did not have , &quot; says dresser .
when the boy was about 15 , he moved back to the male sex and married a woman .
with 38 but he did commit suicide .
according to drescher , there are still doctors who would practice this model .
but in the 1990 ’ s , with the internet coming in , survivors of these gender operations were made public , who “ did not feel happy with the result . ”
for example , jim bruce , a 36-year-old writer from montana who was born with xy-male chromosomes , but ambiguous genitalians .
doctors were unaware of whether he had a big climatori or a small penis , and were convinced that he could never become a “ satisfactory life . ”
so its external body and the pest were rebuilt shortly after the birth of 1976 , and it was called a girl .
at the age of 12 , he received female hormones .
“ i knew i was not a girl , ” he said to abcnews.com that he was a good friend of abcnews.com .
i was unfortunate , but it was really difficult to ask questions .
at the age of 18 he was supposed to get a vaginal plastic .
but , since he was depressed , he knew that something was wrong , he demanded that his medical action be taken .
what he found was shocking .
i was sterilized at my birth – and no one ever told me .
bruce was born with a dsd , which did not testosterone enough to develop genitals .
after knowing the truth , he returned to the male identity , received testosterone injektions and settled down his breasts .
the surgery has made it infertile .
today , he is fighting for others in an organization called interface project for intersexual people to be perceived as normal .
but anne tamar-mattis , managing director of the american company based in california , advocates , has been a member of the international community for the protection of human rights .
“ many activists are concerned that the german decision could encourage parents to take quick decisions and give the child a , not fixed , ” said the german government .
we fear that this will favour intervention .
we think it would be better to have male or female sex , but to have them wait .
but we do not yet know how the law will impact , so we can only speculate .
tamar-mattis said that her organization supported the australian law , because “ it allows adults to be recognised as a third sex ” .
“ adults should be able to make their own decisions about their legal sex , ” she explained .
the german law is about the allocation of birth .
this is not a battle to which small children should be forced at this time .
when they are grown up , they can decide for themselves on their bodies .
but arlene baratz , a brustradologist from pittsburg , who was a daughter with a sexual disorder , and who had hundreds of others in a self-help group , says that the law does not .
katie , the daughter of baratz , was born with male chromosomes , but has a dsd called complete andro-resistance .
the receptor &apos;s defect of target cells for testosterone caused katie to develop female characteristics .
she has a vagina but no uterus and no ovaries .
today katie 29 is married ; she works on the university of pennsylvania .
it is infertile , but hopes to be able to achieve a better future through adoption or surrogate mother .
&quot; the law gives parents room , which does not make them rush to make decisions , &quot; baratz said .
it gives you the time to test and to clarify things and gives you time to do it .
in this way everything is fine – you pull the child and love it .
we have a wonderful baby and enjoy the parents luck .
and you do not have to rush to carry out an operation that cannot be reversed .
&quot; this includes children in the decision and eliminates the fear that parents are exaggerating because they believe that they are not the right thing to do , &quot; said the children .
in the end , the child decides on the sex that fits better with him – and that is wonderful .
this will enable children to make the decision themselves .
unknown injure girls by shot from car
unknown people have died in shots from a car in saxony-anhalt .
the perpetrators had to be arrested in geneva on thursday evening with a gun of air pressure on a group of children .
that was what the police told us in burg .
the girl is easily wounded on the left wade .
rescue forces brought the girl to hospital .
the shot came from a small car that was attached to a group of six children and suddenly stopped .
witnesses saw two people sitting in the car .
the perpetrators also shot at a bus stop .
a disc broke .
they then moved on .
the criminal police are investigating , they said on friday .
until now , the police inspection has been able to kempten to a quiet halloween night .
officials were only invited to attend school twice , which had been forced to work against house facades .
since the homeowners recognized this in time and the eggs were removed immediately , no damage should have arisen .
in addition , some sylvesterboeglers were lit in the city area , but no damage was caused here .
a resident in the bischof freighter way reported that his car was stolen with a knob and his wheel trim was stolen .
until the police arrived , the man has to remove his wheel decorative blinds in the immediate vicinity , so the police are not obliged to continue to act .
living with a future perspective
waltraud ries really lives in a dream .
your house is located in a quiet residential area of stuttgart with lots of green , an old tree stock , nice neighbors and also not too much traffic .
the city is only a few minutes away by public transport .
&quot; hopefully you are not afraid of spiders ? &quot; says waltraud ries , and points to a fat spider on the door frame .
i have been looking for a new home for my husband and myself for some time .
but you know how difficult that is in stuttgart .
the reason is not a spider phobia , but the concern to keep the many steps to the house and apartment at old age out of control , she explains .
moreover , since the meniskus operation , the mittel50 has experienced in her own bodies what it means to deal with handicap from stockholm .
recently , a book of her appeared on the subject of &quot; happy living in old - what kind of housing is the best for me ? &quot; .
&apos;our apartment is the best example of what is not possible at age &apos; , it begins to tell .
when they started their husband in the maisonette apartment more than 20 years ago , it was simply a beautiful apartment in the middle of the green .
today with the middle of fifty waltraud ries thinks differently about this .
however , she also knows that she is one of the few people who even deals with the issue of &apos; old age &apos; .
most people are squeezing it as long as it goes .
only the other people are getting old , &quot; she says .
only when the suffering is really great will we consider it .
&apos;then it can be too late &apos; , says ries .
in its book , interior architect presents 17 models of living for self-determined living in old age .
&apos;which type of accommodation you choose , however , is always an individual decision &apos; , she explains .
d i e solution does not exist for the age .
even those who take the retirement home in tuscany or brittany should be aware of the fact that they are also sick .
and : &apos; without good knowledge of the language , you can also work in the dolce vita , &apos; gives the author of the book a chance to relocate .
among their models are classic care models , alternative forms of living , or the often quoted rent-a-car wg .
at age , everyone has their ticks and corners so much that they can get their hands on their necks and necks .
&apos;for me , such a community of flats would be nothing , &apos; she says with a wink .
not as in a student wg with a shared bathroom and kitchen .
&quot; in old age , you simply need your retreat rooms , &quot; says ries .
the fact that a senior residence community can still function is something that the book author does not want to rule out .
but that should be different from the classic student debate .
and sometimes you just want to be calm , &apos; she believes .
with this view , it is not alone , at least in the capital of the country .
&apos;most old people in stuttgart want to stay in their own flat for as long as possible &apos; is also the experience of theresa rütten , the head of civil service living in the age of the state capital .
your department advises people on the subject of &apos; getting older &apos; .
that is why it is particularly elderly people who would often buy inconvenience and restrictions just to be able to stay in their habitual environment , and that is also the experience of the foundation warentest .
there are many ways of getting to know the house or apartment without barriers .
ries recommends to all those who are concerned with the renovation of their home or apartment in a suitable way , to get a thorough insight into the situation and not to try the first best craftsman .
today , there are also a number of specialists for the rebuilding that is appropriate for the age .
even in the apartment , one or two things can be realized , and if it only has the toilet seat increase , the interior designer clarifies the situation .
but the existing apartment cannot always be adapted to the age and therefore accessible , even if it is still so beautiful .
waltraud ries had to do this .
the apartment is very small and the room is very small .
it will continue to search until it becomes the ideal object for itself and your husband .
before moving , she greets her more than before the spider at her home .
the us wants to continue prosecuting snowden
the us has changed its stance on the former us intelligence officer edward snowden .
he is still accused of using unauthorised secret information .
therefore , he must be subject to criminal proceedings in the united states , said us secretary of state jennifer psaki , in washington .
the recent statements by snowden would not change this either .
previously , german green politician hans-christian ströbele had a meeting with snowden in moscow .
psaki stressed that currents are strong , but not the ones of a parliamentarian .
edward snowden , the secret service provider , is basically invited to talk to german authorities .
first , however , he wants to know his situation .
this has not helped the former nsa staff in a non-address country that the us sought , which is the green politician hans-christian fernsehle , on friday , after a meeting with snowden , and sent to the government .
the letter has been written in a translation of ströbele :
to the competent authorities
i have been asked to give you a reply regarding your inquiry on mass surveillance .
my name is edward joseph snowden and was previously contracted or directly connected to the technical expert .
in the course of my work in these institutions , i have witnessed systematic breaches of the law of my government , which have led me to act on moral grounds .
as a result of the publication of these concerns , i was faced with a serious and persistent rash that forced me to leave my family and my homeland .
i am currently living in exile and i enjoy temporary asylum , which is the request of the russian federation under international law .
i am encouraged by the response to my political action , both in the us and elsewhere .
citizens around the world , as well as senior officials - including the united states - have been watching the revelations into a system of all-encompassing surveillance that is not accountable to anyone as a public service .
this spy revelations brought many proposals for new laws and directives .
the benefits for society from these findings are not being made clearer ; at the same time , the risks that have been taken have been visibly diminished .
although the result of my efforts has been demonstrably positive , my government continues to treat dissent as a violation of its loyalty and seek to criminalise political expression and prosecute it .
nevertheless , telling the truth is not a crime .
i am confident that the united states government , with the support of the international community , will put an end to this unacceptable attitude .
i hope that , when the difficulties of this humanitarian situation have been resolved , i will be able to participate in the responsible enlightenment of the facts regarding the actions taken in the media , particularly with regard to truth and authenticity .
i look forward to talking to you in your country as soon as the situation is clarified and thank you for your efforts to respect international law , which protects us all .
edward snowden testifies to hans christian ströbele ’ s work on the subject of the “ new world ” .
kindergarten has found a private buyer for children ’ s garden .
&quot; the building is in good hands , &quot; says winterlingen mayor michael maier .
the former kindergarten in the garden street has sold the commune to a private person .
the local council voted in its most recent meeting in the non-public sector for the sale .
the building changed its owner to a &quot; reasonable &quot; price .
&quot; the community is satisfied , &quot; says maier .
eur 100 000 was set in the budget .
it is not yet clear how the new owner will use the former kindergarten .
the mayor is right that winterlingen is responsible for the building before the winter to someone else and therefore no longer responsible for the maintenance of the house .
&quot; this effort is now gone , &quot; maier is pleased .

report : obama campaign considered bidding through hillary clinton , but the bush administration has not yet done anything to change the way the world works .
president barack obama ’ s closest advisers , in secret , have considered that vice-president joe biden should be replaced by hillary clinton in the 2012 election campaign , according to the new york times .
the revelation is the most notable surprise of the long-awaited work of mark halperin and john heilemann on the 2012 election campaign , “ double down : game-change 2012 . ”
the times is a copy of the upcoming release of the new book , and it reported on thursday , december 9 , that the dead of the book will be “ extensive group meetings and surveys at the end of 2011 ” to find out .
according to jonathan martin , national political correspondent of the times , the book thoroughly records the history of the efforts of leading campaign and white house staff to help , especially the former white house .
the potential change was a strictly guarded secret within the campaigns .
only half a dozen of the president ’ s closest advisers – including daley , obama ’ s former campaign leader , jim messina , and the former white house ’ s senior adviser , david axelrod , and david david axelrod , and david .
in double down , it is claimed that daley was at the forefront of efforts to keep bids in the hands of the jews , despite their “ close , personal relationship . ” before they eventually came to an end .
in an interview with martin , daley confirmed that the government really thought about using bids through clinton .
“ i made a whole series of things that could be considered , and that was one of them , ” said dley , the magazine .
we must remember that the president was terrifying at the time of the poll , so we thought : “ for god ’ s sake , what do we do ? ”
while daley was the &quot; due diligence &quot; of the investigations , martin said to anderson cooper of cnn that , during the re-election campaign , considerable effort had been made to find out whether a new one could be .
“ campaigns do not spend as much money on surveys and focus groups when they do not think seriously about something , ” said martin on ac360 .
it is not clear , however , whether obama knew that his team would think about an exchange .
martin said to cnn , he asked daley if his then boss had the potential to change .
although daley said he did not believe that the president would be aware of the possible change , the former president of the stable admitted that it was “ possible . ”
martin added that “ double down ” is not a definitive answer to the question that the us political songs are not “ enough to make ” obama ’ s writing desk .
cooper asked martin if he seriously thought obama had heard nothing of the investigation about how he could be bidding in the elections .
“ possible , ” martin replied .
what happens on the way with my email ?
e-mail is actually an electronic letter .
was in the design of the internet service email similar to the conventional post technically the secret of letter ?
the concept of early internet services focused on making communication possible .
that is why the basic technical protocols have not taken care to establish a stable basis for a hearing safe correspondence .
therefore , a conventional e-mail corresponds to an open postcard rather than a sealed letter .
if the user &quot; anna &quot; is sent to &quot; benni &quot; an e-mail , the two computers are then directly connected ?
the email program or the browser of anna sends the mail to the mail server of your service provider in the first step .
for example , if you have a gmail account , google would .
this mail server sends the content to the provider , which uses benni .
on the track , the mail can be accessed via a number of other servers on the internet .
bennie can then request the content from its provider .
if traditional e-mails are sent to your mobile through the network ?
most of the emails are sent by software robots several times .
the sender provider uses a verification to check that the mail contains a malicious program as an attachment .
on the receiver systems , a virus check is also carried out .
in addition , providers check whether it is an inconvenient and unwanted spam mail , which is deleted immediately or at least is sent to a spam folder .
if the robots have another task ?
for systems like gmail , the robot also determines the information google provides for context advertising .
if anna and benni are informed by gmail about their coming holiday trip , google can provide links to holiday offers .
do you read unfamiliar people ?
the probability that unauthorized persons will read an email is extremely low .
in theory , however , this is possible .
in companies administrators often have the possibility to read electronic mail .
the law enforcement authorities and the secret services also have legal means of intercepting or noting e-mails .
there are also possible illegal displacement measures .
is it possible to send e-mails against reading ?
using encryption according to the openpgp standard , an e-mail can be effectively encrypted against read .
with a lot of technical effort it is also possible to use the metadata of an e-mail communication , so that it is not even easy to identify who communicates with whom .
how important are yahoo and google on the email market in germany ?
the most commonly used private mailboxes are yahoo and google , according to an investigation by convios consulting of august 2013 , only a minor role .
while yahoo-mail ’ s shares were last down , gmail was able to increase significantly from google .
mother in the forest disappears and retires .
when his betazed mother died , a man from wolfsburg forged a plan .
he buried the dead in a forest - and continued to collect their pensions and carers .
to continue with pensions and care , you must have a professional insurance company that has been in charge of the death of wolfsburg after an investigation by the police in the forest .
first , he commented the death of the 89 year olds , then he wasted the money for more than a year and a half .
now the 67 year old must be responsible for fraud , as a speaker said on friday .
so the man hid the woman in a forest near helmstedt .
the man was suspected in may : at that time , it was discovered that there was no provision for nursing mothers .
the investigators told the pensioners that his mother had travelled to spain .
because officials are curious about this , they continued to identify it .
it was discovered that the two had been living in a shared flat for more than 15 years and that he had recently maintained them .
the 67 year-old finally died , his mother .
an obsession with the police revealed no evidence of a capital crime .
want to get ice cream that glows in the dark ?
a british entrepreneur has the first in the dark ice-cream developed – using torment .
charlie francis made the fluorescent properties of the sea creatures .
the idea came to him after he had completed a research on torment and persuaded chinese scientists to accept the shining protein artificially .
the ice cream reacts with tongue when consuming , which reduces the ph value in protein and reduces the luminosity .
chris explains that the ice cream responds to the heat in the mouth and glow – the more you lick , the brighter it becomes .
charlie , founder of the ice cream company , “ lick me &apos;s delicious ” , says : “ the product is incredibly , but still in a very early production phase , and so gets a two grams of it for you . ”
the ice cream protein reacts with the tongue at a neutral tonic and has a positive effect on the skin .
when the mouth is warming up the protein , the ph value and ice rise .
we have had it tested in recent months and it seemed to us ideal to have it on halloween on the market because it was this wonderful illumination effect that we had .
it is probably the most expensive ice cream i ever made , because the torrent light is the fourth time tougher than gold .
each ball costs me about 140 pounds .
but it tastes delicious for that .
charlie &apos;s experimental company , based in bristol , is famous for its unusual flavours , including bier , cheese , cheese , beef and other black meat .
but his latest creation is to become even more ambitious .
he says , ‘ i would like to see an invisible ice cream ’ .
that is impossible in itself because of the breakdown in light caused by the ice crystals , from which ice cream is made ; but i suspect we will find a way to do it .
the ice cream uses the fluorescent properties of a torment artificially produced by chinese scientists .
the tsv morsum is still in operation after six days of play without any point in the handball league .
it is now of all times that the team of ingo ehlers will be coming to the derby tomorrow against the tsv daverden , who celebrated his first victory last weekend .
the season begins with this game for us .
&quot; i hope that we can finally get our head free &quot; , ehler &apos;s behavior is optimistic .
he finally got the chance to see the world of the world &apos;s most famous and famous hendrik blohme .
daverden , like us , is also committed to speed .
we must therefore keep our error rate low .
first and foremost , however , we need to increase the coverage , which is , in the last analysis , anything but certain .
the room was very clean and the staff were friendly .
the game was of course a house number .
but that is why we are far from being the favourite , because everything can always happen in the derby .
however , panitz now wants to prove in morsum to start a series .
jan-malte jadat is missing .
for this purpose , the a young joost windßuss , who has been awarded double game rights in the a-youth bundesliga hc bremen , celebrates his seasonal debut .
if you don &apos;t like this game , you should stay at home .
halloween 2013 : in figures
when i was a little bit small , halloween had something magical .
my sister and i were allowed to eat sweets , stay late and take us to the neighborhood .
today i am more interested in the halloween muffle .
in the last two years , i have not agreed to move from my home to sweets , and i am sure that i will not do so this year either .
but according to statistics , i am a black sheep , as far as halloween is concerned .
the majority of americans – 158 million to be exact – are celebrating halloween this year , spending a total of us $ 6.9 billion on candy , costumes , and decorations , according to the us president .
one thing i can rely on every halloween then again is the trendsetting .
the costumes will be about 1.2 billion of the us $ 6.9 billion spent , according to the nrf .
this year , exciting unanimated items are the last cry .
women no longer need to wear sexy clothes , they can now also wear seductive food , such as pizza , hamburgers or carrots .
as far as men are concerned , i expect a lot of zombies thanks to the walking dead , and i bet that the daft-punk space men will be able to put it into the instagram feeds this year .
according to google , the most sought-after costumes are zombies , batman , pirates and witches .
i suspect that there is nothing wrong with tradition .
last year we were dressed up our dogs and were astonished not to be alone .
indeed , americans spend $ 330 million this year on pet costumes , according to the nrf .
these are a lot of “ hot dogs ” .
as regards sweets , we are not cunning .
americans will spend $ 1.9 billion this year , the nielsen company said .
this is about 270 million kilograms of chocolate , lutches , candy and rubber bearings .
so good news for the us department of commerce , according to 41 million people who are trapped with the slogan “ sweet or acidic ” .
in fact , we will have to pay more than 40 million kilograms of chocolate for halloween and – let us not fool ourselves – eat .
the only thing we do not want to consume is the sweet candy corn ; yet 15 million kilograms of it are sold around halloween , according to the national association of confectionery manufacturers .
that is about nine billion maize grains .
it is a mystery that i have not yet been able to solve .
nothing is part of halloween more than houses where it spills .
they have great names like “ terror behind the walls ” ( which is , incidentally , a real prison ) , “ howl-o-scream ” and “ the house of shock ” .
there are indeed 1,200 officially recognised spukshäuser in the united states , which has earned $ 500 million , according to america haunts , and that includes the wonderful photos that the us has just taken .
but let us finally get to the pumpkins .
charlie brown made us with the big pumpkin when we were children , and carving a pumpkin lantern is like decorating christmas tree .
fortunately , the “ baby in the pumpkin ” trend began only last year thanks to pintest , so most of us have grown up with the pumpkin and not , in it .
this year , americans will spend about $ 106 million on pumpkin , say the us census bureau .
the pump lantern , which is slowly rotating in the front garden , is probably from illinois , where this year it cut 245 million kilograms .
if you want to score correctly , call tim and susan mathisdon in napa , california , and carve something nice and beautiful out of their 921 kilo pumpkin .
housing fire in helmbrecht : rescue forces are burning coal in the corridor .
the fire service had to be closed in helmbright at the end of thursday evening .
a three-family house in the district of hof begins fire during the night to friday .
the rescue services have a coaly corpse from the house .
rescue forces have been killed in a fire in helmbrecht .
whether it is a occupant handle is still unclear how a spokesman of the police in bayreuth said .
on late thursday evening , there was a room on the ground floor of the house .
when the fire brigade arrived , the flames swept out of a window .
the staff went to the apartment and found the corpse in a room .
this and another room completely burned out .
the entire ground floor was damaged .
all other residents were not at home during the fire , the police speaker continued .
the building was not inhabitable for the time being .
the exact cause of the fire was not clear at first .
germany &apos;s largest national church has an offensive to promote the profession of pastoral life .
background is a possible parish deficiency : the gospeled-lutheran church hanover retains the right to a life of its present approximately 1800 pastoralists .
for today &apos;s young people , the profession is very attractive and offers good prospects , said pastor mathis burfien ( 43 ) in conversation with the evangelical press service .
it is attractive to have a look at the workflow and the daily routine .
with burfia , the regional church has for the first time a pastor in a full place in which to prepare young people for theology studies .
at present , fewer and fewer young people are choosing to study theology after graduation .
burfia is leading this towards the process of secularisation : &quot; god &apos;s voice is quiet , the world is loud &quot; .
the profession of great freedom and diversity is a factor .
i am mr of my calendar and i can set my priorities where i feel it is important .
pastors could be very close to the people as a sorcery .
they earned as much as teachers and could well live on it .
certainly , in the free economy , more money is being paid , but theologians would have a safe employer for that .
this is something that i am able to meet today &apos;s young people , who are not only concerned with career but also with a job that is a job that is a lot of work in a spirit of deeds .
according to the national church , which has three quarters of lower saxony , around 60 pest patients in the ruhem are currently retiring every year .
at the same time , some 40 graduates of a theology studies start their vikariat .
in sparsely populated peripheral areas such as resin , emsland or wendland , it may be difficult in future to fill jobs .
burfia wants to organise , among other things , study days for young people and also to invite prominent people to study theology .
the theology studies offer a broad education .
it can even become the president of the federal republic .
land rover rally series announced : land rover rally series announced .
the interior features race seats and six-point gore belts as well as a hands-free system .
the options range from stepped brakes , a service package with support for bowler works-mechanics and logistics systems to the complete service package .
drew bowler , managing director of bowler motorsport , explains : “ the rally customers who are part of bowler have decided to change . ”
they are not all experienced racing drivers , but people who are looking for excitement and adventure , and who are looking for an accessible path to world-class events .
we are pleased to be able to continue this path in partnership with land rover and msa and believe that the format opens up new possibilities to explore the various rally disciplines in the uk and abroad and to meet new friends .
we really enjoyed the defender challenge car .
in addition , defender challenge has a training program for the defender challenge in february , as well as the option to participate in desert races in north africa and the middle east .
fire brigade to save a bitch that has been thrown 15 meters above the ground on a dangerous rock edge in a stone quarry .
cockerspaniel bitch ruby was a member of the german police after a minor traffic accident .
three days later , she was taken by a walker in the quarry in her predicament position discovered by a stonebreak walker in her predicament .
firefighters rolled on rocks and saved the hooded dog from the safe death of the human being .
the fire service managed to get a dog in safety .
the nine months old cockerspaniel bitch ruby was born after a traffic accident on sunday afternoon and survived three days alone , before she was on wednesday .
scott alderson , 25 , and his girlfriend becky hall , 20 to whom the dog belongs , came to the quarry flappit in denholme , west yorkshire , to ruby again .
they desperately lost their lost bitch , and they were forced to cry for help in social networks when they were looking for the small road accident in the quarry .
around 2 : 15 pm on wednesday , a walking man , who had his dog , saw the dog that was stranded ruby on the 15m high paragraph in the quarry .
the technical rescue team at cleckheaton fire station eilte zur stelte and rope to rescue rubys from the ground up .
andy clayton , specialist in the technical rescue team , said : “ she was in a dangerous situation .
it was in the middle of the rock wall – 15 meters from the top and the bottom .
she did not move muscles during her rescue – she was like stiff frozen .
but now it is doing well .
she then took a few dog cakes .
this was a rather unusual effort .
the fact that the dog was discovered is incredible .
peter lau , specialist in the technical rescue team , said : “ ruby had a giant slash . ”
there was a possibility that she was seriously injured or worse .
ruby was brought to the examination of the veterinary surgeon , who had no knowledge of anything except exhaustion and dehydration .
becky hall from halifax , west yorkshire , said : “ in rescuing , watching was frightening . ”
i could not believe that they really were up there .
it was wonderful to see them back in the poor .
the veterinarian explained that if exhaustion became too big and it had collapsed , it would probably have crashed .
the firefighters have done a great job .
it was really courageous what you did .
we are simply so grateful and each of them was absolutely incredible .
scott alderson from keighley added : “ we were afraid that they would fall , but they were still up . ”
the firefighters were great .
i can hardly believe where it was .
mick jagger explains that he never stopped kity perry when she was 18 .
in an interview with an australian radio station this week , the pop star said that she had been working as a background singer at jaggers song “ old habits the hard ” from 2004 .
perry said she had to deal with the altrocker to evening , and that “ he took me down when i was 18 . ”
she added : “ this has been a long time ago and he was very kind to me . ”
in a statement , a representative jaggers said on thursday that he was “ categorically opposed to ever approaching the european union with katy perry . ”
the representative added : “ perhaps she has compared him with someone else . ”
perry was one of the singers who played the role in the rolling-stones-tour this year .
her new album „ prism “ landed on the first place in the week .
george kerevan : european unbundling gives scots the choice of a choice between europe and the scots .
a new day , a new story of terror about independence .
this time we are warned that an independent scotland is needed to be able to join the schengen area as a condition for eu membership .
this is the key word for stories about passport controls in berwick and a story about the “ tiger ” border , secured with barbed wire .
indeed , the strathclyde proposal referred to the possible economic benefits that more freedom of movement could bring to the rest of europe , but this was – as expected – a major factor in the headlines .
nor did anyone mention that eu member states often fail to comply with their strict rules when it comes to making it more favourable .
as scotland is not part of the schengen area at the moment , continued non-compliance for brussels would be a small concession in return for the things that we really expect of the scots .
so , really not a story .
and one that had already come in such a way that they already had a fossil like : the first time i had the “ independence means passport control ” -duck was heard at least 40 years ago .
one interesting point in this connection is the constant repetition of this ancient history .
why should we talk about an independent scotland , when the european pipe is used ?
why the london yoke against the brussels system is , especially now ?
these are the real european news : the great post-war peace plan to unite europe has stalled .
with the euro crisis , the european project has officially died .
across the eu , parties are gaining ground that are hostile to the eu or that want to throw the euro out as a common currency .
even in germany , the eurosceptic party could not establish alternative for germany – only this year – for almost five million votes in the german federal election in september , and thus effectively support free democrats ( the equivalent ) .
there has always been domestic opposition to the plan to create a federal europe .
the current economic crisis , however , is turning out to be a turning point .
the berlin and european central bank imposed strict austerity policies , combined with the straitjacket that the government of the individual national economy is forced to invest in by sticking to the single currency , oblige many people to believe that the project .
the euro crisis has little to do with national governments ’ excessive fiscal deficits – the result of only greece ’ s .
instead , the eurosystem has set its members on exchange rates that are too high for german exporters – and we would like german politicians to leave that to be the case .
without the possibility of devaluing the local currency , southern europe will find itself with a built-in productivity disadvantage compared to germany .
the only way to do this is to cut wages and public spending , spurred on by berlin .
behind the current budget and monetary problems lies a deeper problem in european productivity growth .
as a result of the “ green ” energy directives – a code for the subventionalisation of french and german energy companies on the expense of consumers – the european industry pays a price compared to the united states .
this is a crippling cost disadvantage , as we have already seen in granmanouth .
all the world &apos;s wage fixing systems protect the european petrochemical industry from being subjected to cheap american shale gas .
as a result , a revolt is coming up , particularly in france , the former cheerleader of the eu .
after the war , the french political elite saw the eu as a vehicle for bringing about a change in germany .
but berlin no longer needs paris as a gateway to political legitimacy and has pushed europe into its own economic policy , which is the blow of the french economy .
the result : marine le pen &apos;s right-wing , anti-eu front national has just launched a decisive election .
the national front is now the most popular party in france with 24 % of the electorate – a timely warning to the british labour party that it will not assume that the election will be a rift in the right spectrum would automatically benefit .
what makes le pen so popular with the white frances ?
it wants to use next year &apos;s eu elections to create an anti-eu , anti-community monetary bloc in the european parliament .
if the anti-eu parties do well in these elections – and this is very possible – then the first such bloc could be the european parliament .
this is the point i want to make : in the not too distant future , the growing resentment against the eu and the single currency will unite to abolish the euro .
the eu will not disappear , but it will be more like the “ europe of ( sovereign ) nations , ” the general de gaulle favored .
germany and some of its satellite economies may be stuck with the euro , but france and southern europe are becoming their own currencies .
i expect britain to distance itself from this project in the hope of becoming a member of the united states .
but washington ’ s growing interest in the pacific region suggests that britain alone could not achieve a “ real ” outcome .
where is scotland in all this ?
we can decide to create a region of ( ultimately ) small england .
or we can defend our own economic interests – including berlin and brussels – that is what they are trying to do .
i suspect that scotland could be in a looser european union .
cooperation with other similar thinking countries is essential in a non-federal europe of nations .
otherwise , we should consider equating it with norway and maintaining our economic independence .
the snp government in scotland is – remarkably – a leader in the most successful political movement against austerity in europe , and has played a spectacular majority in 2011 , owing to the rejection of the proposed ( and made ) cuts .
it would be ridiculous for scotland to opt for independence now just to be excluded from berlin and brussels .
early puberty : more rapid growth will be achieved .
afro-american and hispanic girls tend to reach puberty rather than their white contemporaries , as studies show .
physical changes do not mean the puberty of the human being .
there is no evidence that hormones or other chemicals are responsible .
experts believe that the epidemic of obesity is a catalyst of early puberty .
the trend towards early puberty is less pronounced among young people than in young people .
the former cnn correspondent pat etheridge is a journalist who has specialized in child health and family issues .
if a mother is concerned if her daughter is already a child at the age of seven or eight , she may grow breasts and shampoos ?
at the annual conference of the paediatric medical association american academy of pediatrics this week in orlando , florida , the paediatric endocrine scientist dr. paul kaplowitz said that paul kakar kaka .
“ i spend a lot of time reassuring parents – usually this is not a sign that now a new puberity is emerging , ” explains dr. kaplowitz .
obvious indications of development , such as growing breasts , shaman and armpit hair , and body smell , are early on in girls .
nevertheless , there was only a slight shift in the age of menarche ( the first bleeding occurred ) in the last 40 years .
in the united states , the average age is 12.5 years , slightly less than 12.75 in 1970 .
“ when breasts develop , it takes at least two to three years to reach the menark , ” said kaplowitz , also author of the book “ early puberty in girls : the essential counselor to this .
time is the most exact test of how puberty progresses .
it is controversial about what actually means the beginning of puberty , but it is about “ early-harvest ” when breast enlargement is accompanied by a growth surge of eight years old .
in most cases , the process or stagnation is slowing , something that is a pediatrician .
if we move faster , tests could be replaced by endikronologists so that serious problems like tumours or cysts can be ruled out .
there are methods of treatment for delaying an early menstruation and preventing another consequence : the premature aging of the bone , the premature aging of the bone , and the ultimately inhibiting growth and therefore small body growth in the cases .
the recommendations for a medicinal or hormonal therapy are based on the age of the child , the development speed , the growth rate and the emotional maturity .
psychosocial aspects are also important .
kaplowitz is reluctant about medication , but he admits : “ suppressing puberty can cause behavioral problems and the feelings of girls , unlike their age comrades .
the other major problem is understandable : parents simply do not want their very young daughters to have the period .
&quot; they worry about the risk of pregnancy or how to reduce hygiene , &quot; said the president of the european commission .
“ it was a shock , ” a woman remembers , whose daughter gets ten days of her life .
although there were initial signs and we were talking about menstruation , it was not emotionally prepared .
she was frightened and excited from school to home because she was the first in her friend &apos;s circle .
there are many widely published theories about the causes of early puberty .
but there is no conclusive evidence that hormones are in milk or other food .
boys , like girls , enter puberty earlier .
kaplowitz believes that the most convincing premise is the epidemic of obesity .
he supported the implementation of a study in 2001 on girls aged six to nine , who had a connection between body fat and entry into the puberty .
other studies support this conclusion , but there are many other factors that could play a role .
in this country , african-american and hispanic girls tend to reach puberty rather than their white contemporaries .
there are different explanations for this .
global , early puberty seems to be influenced by all sorts of things , from economic conditions to climate to genes .
another puzzle : although boys are the face and shaman hair earlier , the trend is too high to become a full former pub .
other aap conferences have highlighted the complexity of the problem of the issue .
the appearance of acne and shamhair is even common in babies and infants .
“ we must be careful how we can prevent the true beginning of puberty , ” said dr. lawrence silverman , a paediatric grandfather of the american medical profession .
parents should not hesitate to contact their pediatrician for advice on how to talk to their child .
“ this can mean that you can have to talk earlier than expected , ” said kaplowitz .
if you are calm , the child usually reacts well .
girls who bloom early need insurance , which the process is a normal part of life , even if it used to be thought .
jumbo manufacturers argue against the need for a seat width of the seat in the face of large orders , with large orders over seat width and height .
there is no need for a dispute between leading aircraft manufacturers about the width of seats in the tourist class for long-haul flights , which is a good example of a bitter clash on the dubai airshow this month .
the dispute revolves around the seat width , the passengers on long flights in the tourist class offered is – not always those who are trying to get the airlines to the best , but this is the area that is shown to be the key to them .
airbus requested a branch standard this week which includes a seating width of at least 46 cm ( 18 inches ) in the tourist class .
the dispute comes at a time when the aircraft builders are struggling to make even larger versions of their two-engine long haul fins .
like the rear part of the aircraft , especially if it is rows with nine or ten seats , the crucial factor is the economic results indicated , which the new “ mini job ” will bring .
boeing claims that its modernized “ 777x ” fassa is 406 people in tourist class seats over 17 inches wide .
airbus says that the competing version of the a350 carries 350 passengers in 18 inches wide seats in the tourist class , with nine in each row .
aircraft giants often share a technical detail through advertising in the specialized press from the industry .
now airbus is appealing to the dubai airshow , where the 777x will be the race with more than 100 orders , and will be directly to the public .
recently , the company presented an advertisement that marks the start of a new ad war and which could give donors a picture of three people being squandered in a restaurant that is not mentioned in the title : “ would you accept the system ? ”
&quot; boeing proposes long-haul flights in seats that are closer than regional turbo props , &quot; says airbus president .
with a change in diet , people become thick , but aircraft seats have not radically changed .
between the early 1970 ’ s , when the boeing 747 launched the modern long-distance journey , and the end of the century , the weight of the male average american between 40 and 49 years has increased by 10 % .
the waist range of the male average american in the 21st century is about 10 % , according to us health statistics .
airbus says that its rival is in line with a concept of seating from the 1950s , when the average body size of the newly baptized “ jet set ” was narrower .
according to airbus , research has been carried out which showed that an additional customs duty ( 2.54cm ) per seat would reduce the sleep quality by 53 % .
boeing denies the figures from airbus to the seating capacity and says that it is not at the discretion of manufacturers to decide how airlines should balance the airline ’ s fares and arrangements .
the company also says that according to studies the experience in the aircraft is from more than the seat width .
“ it really is about giving airlines flexibility to make the right decisions , ” says stephen schmidt , president of the commission .
they do not want us to dictate to them what they are making profitable .
you know your business better than anyone else .
passengers are concerned about more elbows , but for manufacturers it will increasingly be difficult to find a solution to the problem of sales .
behind the argument stands a race for aircraft orders with an estimated volume of at least $ 700 billion , based on list prices , in the coming decades , which has a lasting impact on the us or europe ’ s export balance .
as reuters reported in july for the first time , the seat layout is the driving force behind the debate about the new jets .
both airbus and boeing hold 20 percent more efficiency per seat at their latest two-engine long-range aircraft design .
boeing ’ s statements about the results depend in part on the 777x having its ten seats per row matched the original design of nine seats in the 777 .
the increased cost per unit is still lower than that of currently used machines with ten seats per row .
&quot; boeing therefore squeezes more seats in its aircraft to make it more competitive to our products &quot; , says kevin keniston , head of passenger services .
on the other hand , analysts say that full cabins with ten seats per row in existing 77s indicate that many passengers are in favour of closer arrangement , which would mean cheaper fares .
“ eighteen inch seat width would be great for passengers , but the reality is that from an economic point of view , the airbus a320 family is dependent on the threat from the 777 . ”
airbus and boeing do not offer seats , but a catalogue of suppliers , from which the airline companies can choose .
the world travelers jet vendors even carry a bandwidth to make the establishment competitive .
even if you are a guest of comfort , all manufacturers offer jets with high compacting capacity .
airbus has an a350 with ten-seater rows , but has not yet sold them .
until recently , airbus stressed the importance of making cabins more adaptable and providing a wide range of seats for some jets .
without the support of the only other manufacturer of large modern jets , experts say that the call for a new industry standard is likely to be reversed , but the wave of 77x sales could distract .
new anti-nicotine vaccine could give the pleasure of smoking a gait .
scientists have developed an anti-nicotine vaccine that is a good way to spoil the fun of smoking .
a single dose of the vaccine could save mice from nicotine addiction for a lifetime .
before testing on humans , further experiments are needed , which can take several years , but professor ronald crystal of the weill cornell medical college in london will be saying that the first results are good .
“ we are very hopeful that this type of vaccination strategy will once help millions of smokers who have tried to stop smoking , while keeping all the methods available on the market tried to do so , but we have seen that their nicotine .
the new vaccine contains a harmless virus that has been modified to prevent the genetic information on the production of nicotine insects .
the virus selectively infects liver cells , which then generate a constant stream of antibodies .
the antibodies hunt the nicotine molecules in the blood and neutralize them , before they can destroy the brain .
in experiments , vaccinated mice , which nicotine was administered , kept their normal level of activity .
mice without vaccination , on the other hand , would have taken a “ time-out , ” the researchers said , a sign that nicotine has reached its brain .
the experiments are available in the factual journal science translational medicine .
earlier tobacco vaccines failed to produce a vaccine that was designed to contain antibodies .
vaccinations had to be used to maintain the antibody level as often as possible , and were expensive and unpractical .
but the cost of the new vaccine is probably much lower , because it transforms liver cells into antibody factories .
as professor crystal said , a future european immune vaccine , if it is perfectly certain that children are being administered before they are tempted to use a cigarette , could be a source of death .
more likely , however , smokers would use it to stop .
“ you then know : if you start smoking again , you feel the same as you do , because of the nicotine vaccine , and that helps you to change the habit ” , explains alfred .
british scientists said that the results were interesting , but at the same time warned that further research was needed .
tripodi denies , influenced by obeid , that he was influenced by obeid , and that he was a member of the tripodi family .
the former minister of the labour party , joe tripodi , from new south wales , is being accused of a investigation by the state &apos;s corruption inspectorate .
the former minister of the nsw denies that the rules on maritime leasing were amended at the request of his political mentor eddie obeid , who was in charge of concealed investments in three controlled land on state-owned land .
the independent commission has been working on the new project for the international financial services industry since 2001 .
now , the accusation is being made that tripodi has been used by obeid &apos;s hidden interest in the land after tripody &apos;s earlier death .
in many years of talks that began in 2005 , the government had responded to public tenders for leasing contracts .
the peers were opposed to this and also wanted longer maturities .
in 2009 , leasing contracts were awarded to companies at the circular quay , which annually awarded the obeids 2.5 million dollars without any public tendering .
tripodi , who was a port minister from february 2006 to november 2009 , had originally spoken out in favour of public tenders .
but he withdrew from making the changes at the request of obeid , who , as tripodi confirmed , insisted on reforming the leasing arrangements of the government .
one of the icac ’ s written telephone letters showed discussions from august and september 2007 between obeid , tripodi and steve dunn , a senior official who was sent to the port ministry after he was under oath .
&quot; was this the subject discussed in these telephone conversations the development of commercial packaging regulations ? &quot; he asked the deputy commissioner .
“ no , ” tripodi replied .
i cannot remember what was discussed , but that was definitely the case .
definitely not between me and mr obeid .
israeli fighter planes attack targets in syria , as official sources suggest , and the us military sources say , “ the military is the official source of the war . ”
israeli hunting planes would have a destination in the syrian port of latakia on thursday night , confirmed a senior government official in relation to fox news .
the official did not explain what the objective was , but said that it was at least one .
according to the associated press , the aim was russian sa-125 missiles .
at least twice this year , israel has already triggered bombings on missile deliveries in syria .
foreign workers with 457 visas could be “ tested for authenticity ” .
the government is thinking about a “ real ” test in the context of extended measures for foreign workers with 457 visas .
if the test is introduced , it would have a criterion that would prevent the member states from taking the 457 to the post of unskilled jobs or as a back door to the entry of family and friends to australia .
today , a government proposal for discussion has been published after the previous labour meps , maxine mckechev , had read the government &apos;s comments on foreign workers .
“ loud statements like , foreigners should sit back and , australians first set , ” are a very unpleasant setback in times when the trade unions have a protected labor market . ”
historically , this meant that white workers were protected , and that if some in the region were to receive an echo of this historic artefact , it would be a mistake to me .
the proposal for a debate outlines twelve measures that were formerly proposed by former minister for immigration , chris bowen .
immigration minister brendan o &apos;connor , who yesterday called for talks on human smuggling in sri lanka , has accepted five of the recommended amendments that other will be reconsidered .
if the ‘ authenticity ’ criterion is adopted , then someone who has a visa could be able to apply for it to be checked whether ‘ the application is valid in cases where it is not possible for the applicant to comply with the visa ’ .
companies could also be obliged to account for the number of 457 visa holders .
meanwhile , a 35-year-old sri lankan asylum seeker probably died at a heart attack after he had been killed this week with a refugee boat on christmas island .
the disturbed nine-year-old son of the man who came to australia with him has been a victim since his father died on wednesday .
australian authorities took the man to christmas island hospital. he was starving .
the british government has announced a study which will examine the benefits of the hs2 rail project for scotland .
in the work of hs2 ltd is proposed to start from the beginning of phase 1 in 2026 high-speed connections between scotland and the north of england .
minister of transport , baroness kramer , said that the project “ will bring britain closer together ” .
the scottish minister for transport , keith brown , said that he was very pleased to work with the british government on this plan .
phase 1 consists of a new high-speed rail link between london and the west midlands .
after phase 2 , there will be connections to manchester and leeds .
in june , the government corrected the estimated costs of building high-speed road between london and nordengland from 32.7 billion pounds to 42.6 billion pounds .
the british government , which in talks with transport scotland , has hs2 ltd charged hs2 ltd with seeking further capacity and travel time improvements for nordengland and scotland .
this includes the possibility of a travel time of at least three hours or less from glasgow and edinburgh to london .
baroness kramer said : “ our goal for hs2 is a truly national network of routes that brings britain and its cities closer together . ”
we use hs2 to move forward because it brings enormous advantages .
without it , we are facing a capacity crisis in our rail network .
but it is also about the link between 18 british cities , including glasgow and edinburgh , which is being improved thanks to hs2 .
the scottish secretary of state , alistair carmichael , said : “ today ’ s announcement is good news for scotland . ”
on behalf of the scottish government , keith brown carmichael called for “ unambiguous ” commitment to the scottish integration into hs2 networks .
brown said : “ the high-speed railway link carries enormous potential for economic benefits for scotland . ” at the same time , the economic power of scotland is an argument for fast rail links across the uk . ”
we are therefore pleased to be able to work as a partner of the british government and to discuss the options for a high-speed rail link in scotland which will bring benefits to all and strengthen the glasgow-edinburgh link , which will strengthen scotland .
i look forward to the report being examined with the british ministers next year and to working together to take the next steps .
regulations on electronic equipment in aircraft remain in force in australia for the time being .
australian passengers must continue to use tablets and smartphones at start and landing , despite efforts in the us to make the rules for such devices more relaxed .
the us federal aviation administration ( faa ) enables us airlines to carry out their requirements , so that passengers can access the aircraft during critical flight phases e-boats .
during most of the flight , passengers are already permitted to do so , but many people find it annoying that they are not allowed to use their e-books when they start and land .
australian societies are watching the decision that the us airlines are trying to implement in a huge amount of work , but have no immediate plans to change their rules .
the aviation safety authority casa also stated that the announcement of a new aircraft was being made , but stressed that the restrictions on the use of electronic equipment in critical flight phases in australia remain valid .
“ casa has no specific regulations regarding the use of electronic equipment on board aircraft , ” said the president .
this subject is subject to provisions that companies can maintain and protect safety at any time and passengers who are not covered by the safety instructions given by cabin crew .
virgin has already started with casa talks about extending its wi-fi network to include the use of flights , and has declared that it is open to change , this would have to be approved by the legislator .
“ we would like to see a review of the licensing of electronic devices by casa , because we are convinced that this would improve customer experience after we have ( wireless ) been able to use the internet during the flight , ” said a member .
qantas said that for the time being , they will remain in the current rules .
“ our current guidelines provide that electronic devices may be used during start-up and landing , and we currently have no plans to change this , ” said the company .
the faa rules apply to us airlines .
we are , however , always interested in developments in regulations that can benefit passengers and we will be aware of the faa decision and the reasons behind it .
the decision has a negative impact on us companies depending on the age of the fleet .
they must prove that their aircraft have detected the radio disturbances caused by mobile devices , and manuals , training materials , hand baggage programmes and customer training .
“ after an airline has confirmed the tolerance of its fleet , it can allow passengers to use portable , light electronic equipment such as tablets , e-book booklets and smart card reader .
in rare cases , when the crew is in a bad position , the passengers are instructed to take off the equipment while landing .
the group also recommended that heavier devices be safely placed under the seat or in the subjects on start and landing , either under the seat or in the subjects .
in front of the revierderby against schalke had travelled bvb trailers with light missiles for ugly scenes in the veltins arena .
borussia dortmund announced that harsh consequences would be felt .
before the friday game of the bundesliga football league against the vfb stuttgart , the ultras responded with a silence - first .
it was an unfamiliar , almost ghostly acoustics that turned to the viewer until just before the beginning of the bundesliga game between the german vice champion borussia dortmund and the vfl .
the audience was mostly fans of the guest with their singing .
the southern gallery , on the other hand , where the faithful - and loudest - bvb fans stand , initially presented themselves with exceptionally quiet : no singing , no slaughter calls .
the podesty of the capo , who otherwise coordinates the joint infusion , remained unoccupied .
and at the front of the grandstand , a large flank of solitary whistled , calling it &quot; the prohibition of stadium &quot; .
only as goalkeeper roman weidenfeller , as always , was the first bvb player to enter the place , burned short jubilation .
when his team members followed , there were vocal voices and vocal shales - but far from everywhere .
in the central blocks 12 and 13 of the southern gallery , nothing was bothered .
the fact that stadium spokesmen norbert dickel once again reaffirmed the positive experiences of the last few days - derby victory , victory over arsenal , extension of contract by trainer jürgen klopp - did not make a holiday .
only five minutes before the initial attack , the capo knocked his podium - and the hitherto almost with hands tangible claims .
the last thing that was said was that the southern gallery was the turn - and at last , as usual , it was the loudest place in the stadium .
and at the latest when the south tribune had the loudly calling &quot; derbysieger is standing &quot; , the new album was again as usual .
the silence before was probably a reaction to what happened in the last few days .
just before revierderby at fc schalke 04 , some of the coach trailers had been carrying light missiles into the viewers ’ ranks and onto the square - almost torhuts .
the game was played due to the chaotic scenes belatedly .
bvb-boss hans joachim watzke had the tips of the dortmund ultras in his office - and believes he is watzke &apos;s words , was this for the fan representatives rather a problem .
&quot; it will be massive for the entire ultra-movement , &quot; says the president of the bvb boss on thursday evening at a podium meeting .
as an emergency measure , watzke banned the ultras from a choreography for the home match against the vfb stuttgart .
&quot; i forbidden that , &quot; he said .
the zero tolerance policy on pyrotechnics is not something we can give up .
in addition , the ultras have been shown various ways of punishing - they now have time to decide on one by tuesday .
otherwise , watzke argues , the bvb will be a soft power by the end of next week .
&quot; this is going to be very serious &quot; , assured watzke .
we can look forward to seeing how the reactions in the southern gallery will then be .
pfandhaus booming in singapore , as the middle class crisis has arrived , and the crisis has been growing in the middle class .
in a pfandhouse in the bendeceer shopping centre in singapore , janani amirthalinga is exchanging a golden armreif , ring and a few earrings to pay the school fees .
“ my husband and i have just bought a house , and my money is in it , ” says amirthalinga .
although they receive 3,000 singapore dollars ( ca 1,730 euros ) each month as an administrative employee and their husband also work , the monthly salary of the family does not suffice , she explains .
indeed , in parts of south-east asia – where debt is lower – demand for capital is so great that valu ’ s government , where it is forced to exchange , has not reached the third loan this week .
the pledging of jewellery is not only a quick way to get money – 1,300 singapore dollars in the case of janani amirthalinga – but also almost as favorable as a foreign exchange .
typically , pfandhaus in singapore require an effective annual rate of 17 % , which is just above the 15.4 % that unveiled the united overseas bank demands .
however , pfandhäuser offers the advantage that no review of creditworthiness or income evidence is required , which is why loans are possible faster than banks .
that is why millions of people in the region are turning to pfandals , after families have been able to cope with the pressure of rising cost of living and increasing household and consumer debt .
after five years of robust growth since the global financial crisis and cheap credit from loose fiscal policies in advanced economies , families with low income and poor people are looking for pfandals to be used for start-up economies .
this week , the rating agency called standard &amp; poor &apos;s growing budget debt , which mainly reflects rising inflation , and the rise in the risk of a crisis in the lending of asian banks .
malaysia , thailand , and singapore , according to the agency , have the highest levels of household debt in asia relative to gross domestic product .
malaysia stands at 80 % of gdp , a rise of 60 % , still in 2008 .
economists are also concerned about the high level of consumer debt in thailand , which is just about to come out of a technical recession this week .
on thursday , the data showed a continuing export weakness and a reduction in consumer demand .
“ in the end , this means that , with rising costs , middle-segments ( the income gap between the rich and the poor ) will try to supplement their income wherever possible . ” says song seng seng .
historic gold prices peaks in the last two years have increased the trend of pledging personal items .
in singapore , about 70 % of the pledged items are in the city ’ s 200 deposit houses of gold .
people say , “ gold is a good thing , let us have grandmother ’ s gold chain , and let us return next month . ”
the largest thai pfandhaus operator , easymoney , has established a 20-percent increase in customer loyalty in its branches in recent months .
growth in the pond business is so strong that valuemax , the operator of the bendeceuer branch and 15 others in singapore , is not only investing in neighbouring malaysia – where it is – where .
the company finances the company &apos;s 60 percent of the 66 million singapore dollars it has paid with the stock market in singapore this week .
while some lenders are forced to crash because of high interest rates , yeah says that pfandhaus is not only paying cheaper interest than other lenders , but also not directly paying the debt .
&quot; customers borrow items they already own , and the liquefied personal valuables do not increase household indebtedness , &quot; she explains .
the pfandbrief lending business is increasingly seen as short-term , secured financing .
nor are not all people who use mortgage lending in financial difficulties .
rich people from singapore also come to valuemax ’ s stores to sell gold bars and rolex watches .
we are the place for customers from all social backgrounds .
“ these include wealthy people who have a short-term interest in a business or investment , or small businesses that are exposed to bottlenecks in the cash flow , ” says yeah .
sometimes you just need money very quickly .
nsa collects data from google and yahoo - snowden wants to help you to improve your online experience .
the intelligence revealed edward snowden has , in principle , an interest in helping germany to enlighten the increasingly volatile nsa later on in the world .
after the presentation of the green bundestag mep hans-christian ströbele , his surprising meeting with snowden in russia was about the conditions under which the ex-secret services were to be prosecuted by a german public prosecutor or by a german public prosecutor .
snowden has drawn attention to his complex legal situation , said ströbele to the ard magazine &quot; panorama &quot; .
rescue package of over 325 million australian dollars for tasmanian health care .
the australian government insists on the hard conditions that the bailout of over $ 325 million of australian dollars has imposed on the tasmanian health system to ensure that the government of the state does not lose the money .
the federal minister of health , tanya plibersek , has announced that the commonwealth will take “ immediate action ” to avert a crisis caused by an aging population of the island state , a higher quota to health .
the funding for a four-year period was agreed after intergovernmental consultations with the independent tasmanian mep andrew wilkie .
“ the government has announced an emergency rescue package , ” says stephen , who , in our view , is addressing the unique challenges facing the federal state . ” plibersek explained today .
the 325 million dollar bill is a package of $ 31 million in emergency aid for electoral services .
the new system will be able to operate more efficiently and effectively through a further 2600 operations , including orthopedic operations and treatments for grey star .
there is also money for day-clinics in hobart and launceston , better post-hospital care , and more efficient care for patients .
“ these investments correspond to the ideas that i was told by clinicians that they were the best way to get the tasmanian health system to improve , ” said tanya plibersek .
the minister insisted on a strict reporting and accountability policy of the tasmanian government .
the state must maintain the current level of funding to finance commonwealth funds .
a three-member commission will be set up to ensure that the federal state provides healthcare services as effectively and efficiently as possible .
as wilkie said today , the $ 325 million would do little if “ they were not accompanied by real reforms that would undermine the public tasmanian health system to a more sustainable course . ”
nevertheless , he praised the government for responding to its request for urgent assistance , which he first made to the prime minister at the beginning of may .
“ i am confident that federal aid will make a major contribution to improving public health systems in the federal state from the list of concerns , ” said wilkie .
according to the government of the state , these electoral benefits will largely offset the recent cuts .
but the eu ’ s opposition spokesman on health policy at federal level , peter dutton , believes that today ’ s announcement is just a “ paving solution . ”
“ we are therefore in a position today because the laboratory government has made $ 430 million out of the health system , ” he said to abc tv .
it is unacceptable for a state government to spend almost half a billion dollars out of the system and give the commonwealth $ 300 million .
dutton called on plibersek to guarantee that not a single dollar of the bailout package would be spent on additional bureaucracy .
guillaume nicloux &apos; adaptation of the novel by denis diderot impresses with its exceptional production facilities and contemporary details , but is also more difficult to eat than necessary .
the french version of the 1760s was a story of the seductive history of suzanne , a young noble who was born in the monastery by her family .
when she rebelled , she was confronted with the extreme cruelty of an extremely sadistic upper and became the object of erotic fascination of another .
the film never slides away into vagina or sensationalism – and that is his problem .
the solemn seriousness with which the film is told also makes it a quaestor for the public .
syria has made its ability to produce chemical weapons , so a monitoring group has said , and the un monitoring group has said so .
syria has important chemical and chemical weapons manufacturing facilities .
on thursday , too , a syrian activist group announced that more than 120,000 people have been killed in the middle east since the civil war began .
the announcement by the organisation for the ban on chemical weapons ( opcw ) came a day before the date of the date of the day before the date of the date of the day before the date of the day on 9 february .
1 november , which the hague based organization daimaskus set , to take all the facilities for the manufacture of chemical weapons .
the conclusion of this process , which is basically the first stage of destruction , is an important milestone in an ambitious timetable , which is aimed at destroying all chemical weapons in syria .
the destruction of the facilities means that syria will no longer be able to produce new chemical weapons .
damascus , however , still needs to start using the existing weapons and stocks .
it is estimated that there are approximately 1,000 tonnes of chemicals and weapons in the country , including mud gas and nervous gas sarin .
the announcement came at a time when fighting was going on thursday in the city of safira , from the experts say that there is a production facility for chemical weapons and storage facilities .
the group of activists who have a network of activists in syria to track the number of deaths declared on thursday , 120.296 people dead .
of these , 61,067 civilians , including 6,365 children .
on the government side , 29.954 of them were president bashar assad ’ s army , 18,678 of which were pro-government fighters and 187 lebanese hezbollah militias .
among the dead , also 2.202 deserted army soldiers and 5,375 soldiers of the opposition , many of them foreigners .
on 25 july , the un estimated the number of deaths in this conflict since march 2011 to be 100,000 .
this number has not been updated yet .
the conflict has led to the evasion of some two million people .
assad ’ s troops have been fighting for weeks in safira against the rebels , many of whom have links with al-qaeda groups .
the centre said that it had suffered losses on both sides on thursday , but did not mention details .
the fighting underlines the danger posed by the chemical weapons inspectors , because their mission to liberate syria from its huge poisonous arsenal is a race against time in the midst of a deadly civil war .
according to the opcw , which cooperates closely with the united nations , the team is “ now convinced that it will support all the important production and mixing / filling facilities mentioned by syria and mitigate their destruction . ”
therefore , “ no further inspection activities are planned at this time . ”
earlier this week , the inspectors said they had completed the first round of checks and 21 out of 23 of the 23 inspectors listed by damascus .
due to security concerns , two institutions were not allowed to visit , the inspectors said .
on thursday , the opwc stated that the two sites were “ abandoned ” according to syrian saying , and the chemical weapons program ’ s objects there were transferred to other aforementioned facilities , which were inspected . ”
it was not immediately clear whether the site in safira was one of the two institutions that had asked the opcw inspectors to visit .
syria has a plan for the complete destruction of its chemical weapons , which will be adopted by the executive committee of the opwc next month .
“ i prefer to take care of bravery and courage , which you all have to show in fulfilling the most challenging mission ever undertaken by this organisation .
for three years now , the muslim rebels , mainly sunni , have been fighting assad ’ s government and security forces in this civil war , which has afflicted many members of the alawites , a secession of shiite islamic law .
in view of further developments , the head of the observation group , rami abdurrahman , said that there was a strong explosion in an air defence facility in the syrian coastal province of latakia on wednesday .
the cause of the explosion is not known , he explained .
anger at bombing of bali
survivors and relatives of the 202 people killed in 2002 in the bomb attack in bali were reacting to the anger of the ruling on the last of the instigators who came to justice .
patek , who was almost ten years old as one of the most southeast asian people on the run , was yesterday rewarded for his role in building explosive bodies for the bombing .
with a suspension , it could be released after 15 years .
the 45-year-old was accused of mass murder for the attack on the island of two night clubs in the popular tourist district of kuta , where the city was home to 202 people , including 88 australians .
a guilty claim was also made in a series of terrorist charges , which included a wave of spam and a number of other terrorist attacks on churches in indonesia .
the public prosecutor had a lifetime sentence , even if it was not sufficient for the man who was sentenced to death for his reputation as a master-bomber .
the decision has painful memories at june corteen .
the first of her works was in the early 1930s , when she was a member of the national library of music .
i really believe that he should be in the footsteps of the other guys .
&quot; you should protect him from a shooting command , &quot; corteen said to aap .
i have to live every day with my being unmarried and i mean my daughters .
the sari club was ground level when the first world war was held on 12 october 2002 , shortly after 11 p.m. , in a small loader , which was in front of the night club .
peter hughes was in paddy &apos;s bar , where only 20 seconds earlier a suicide bomber used a bomb with explosive force .
he fell a month after the attack and was “ starved ” three times , while he was working on a life conservation system .
hughes said patek deserves the same fate as the three other members of the jemaah islamiah terrorist cell – amrozi , mukhlas , and imam samudra – who are fighting for it .
really , this type should have the death penalty above all else .
to keep it alive – no , there is no reason to keep it alive .
after 20 years of having killed 202 people and many hundreds of injured , is not much .
patek is the last of the bali bombers to be tried .
he escaped almost a decade of arrest , but was eventually released in january 2011 in the pakistani city of abbottabad , where us forces were deploying the former al-qaeda chief , samoa , barely four months later .
during the negotiation , a fbi agent said that intelligence reports would make the evidence that the government had not changed its mind in pakistan .
“ he did not stand up , ” corteen said .
until recently , he has shown no remorse for the suffering he has inflicted on other people .
the ruling was made before the tenth anniversary of the attack this year , which was marked by commemorations in bali and australia .
“ this year , there will be many tears , ” said corteen .
patek can appeal against his judgment .
faa : passengers can now buy electronic equipment on aircraft ( but no mobile phone calls ) .
passengers can now travel from the departure to the landing using their electronic devices for reading , working , playing , listening to music and using the image of films , but not telephoning with the mobile phone , according to the new guidelines that will be published on thursday by federal aviation on thursday .
but passengers should not expect these changes to be implemented immediately .
how quickly they would be implemented depends on the airline concerned , faa explained huerta on a press conference .
the airlines must prove to the faa that aircraft comply with the new guidelines and that they have read the flight crew training manuals and the rules on stowing equipment in accordance with the new rules .
the faa said that it has already received plans from some airlines to ban the use of portable electronic equipment in aircraft .
among these airlines were delta and jetblue .
“ depending on the state of the plan , we could use the extended use of electronic devices very soon , ” said the faa in a statement .
currently , passengers must use smart phones , tablets and other devices when the aircraft is not closed .
they are not allowed to restart them until the plane reaches a height of three kilometres and the captain has the green light .
when you enter the landing , you must reactivate your flight and not restart it before the aircraft landed .
under the new directives , airlines whose aircraft are protected against electronic disruptions could allow their passengers to use the equipment at start-up , landing and on the roll-out field , declared the faa .
most new commercial aircraft and other aircraft that are intended for the use of wi-fi in larger heights are now in the market .
laura glading , president of professional flight attendants , welcomed the changes .
“ if the new regulation is safely implemented – and we are working closely with the airline on this – both sides will benefit , ” commented gladding .
we are frankly tired of being treated like a patron on this issue .
nevertheless , internet connections to surf , exchange emails , text messages or download data below three kilometres remained prohibited , explained the question of the authority .
passengers are requested to use smart phones , tablets and other devices in flight mode .
so still no &quot; words with friends &quot; that scraps the word with friends .
and heavier devices like laptops must continue to be stored , as there is a risk of injury if they are flying through the cabin .
mobile calls during the flight remain prohibited .
the regulatory competence for telephone calls is with the federal communications commission ( fp7 ) .
faa may lift the ban on certain electronic devices when they are launched and landed .
last month , mark rosenker said from the national transport safety authority that the safety board was a safety expert for national transport issues on cbs news , mobile phones are still considered a risk .
“ mobile phones are really a problem , not only because they potentially cause disruption to navigation equipment , but because we are being told by the fcc that transferring from the air is also causing transmission masts ” , says roger .
a consultative committee of the industry , which was appointed by the faa to investigate this issue , recommended that the commission should take action on this subject last month .
in recent years , the pressure on the faa has increased , restrictions have been imposed on use .
critics such as the democratic senator claire mccaskill of missouri argue that there is no valid solution to security problems in the country .
the restrictions are also increasingly difficult to enforce , because the use of the equipment has become ubiquitous .
some studies have mentioned that up to a third of passengers are unable to switch off the equipment .
the faa began in 1966 to ban the use of electronic devices by air passengers after reports of malfunctions of navigation and communications equipment were replaced by passports .
new aircraft are much more dependent on electric systems than previous generations of aircraft , but they are also as designed and built by the faa .
airlines already offer passengers a wide range of wi-fi services , if the flight is at an altitude of only a few years .
the software that is customized to wi-fi systems is also insensitive to the interfering .
the vast majority of passenger aircraft should be used for the greater use of electronic equipment under the new directives , said huerta .
today &apos;s electronic devices generally give much less radio radiation than previous generations .
e-readers , for example , only give off minimal radiation when they are scraped .
but when downloading or sending data , the transmission values are stronger .
advocates of easing restrictions on equipment use are those who advocate the use of equipment .
in 2011 , corporate employees invited a passenger plane full of kindle e-reader and made a test flight to identify problems , but could not find out .
members of the faa advisory committee expressed mixed opinions about the need for a more effective and more efficient use of equipment .
douglas kidd from the passenger association national association of airline passengers passenger airlines passenger said that he thought the interference by the equipment was eager to be true , even if the risk was minimal .
other committee members said that there is only a few reports from pilots , which are not responsible for any disturbance of aircraft systems by the equipment , and most of them are very old .
the committee recommended that the faa should not allow pilots to fly in instruments-landing under bad visibility .
a group from the travel industry welcomed the changes and called them reasonable adjustment for travellers , who are now well equipped with technology .
“ we are pleased that the faa recognises that a pleasant passenger experience does not conflict with safety , ” said roger dow , ceo of the u.s. carrier .
the hotel is located in the heart of the old town of nordsee , in the middle of the old town of südbahnhof .
a car park , which is connected to the coast by air rescue service , is exhausted on a north sea drilling island .
the water ral was closed last month with a helicopter to aberdeen , where it was taken from the scottish animal welfare organization spca in their rescue centre in alloa .
colin seddon , head of the center , said : “ this water ral was probably a winter bird of migration from northern europe , which was driven by the strong winds over the north sea . ”
it seems that the exhausted bird was looking for refuge on the drilling island .
he added : “ he could not continue flying , so we did not agree with the request for help . ”
when she was released , the water purses were again fit and healthy .
is europe ’ s elite prepared to do business with britain ?
business for britain was founded in april with the intention of adapting the economy to the same level and defining what those who work for prosperity and work in britain want to do in our relations with the eu .
to this end , we have developed the largest and most comprehensive survey conducted by british economic leaders and asked them what they think about britain , the economy and the eu .
yougov asked about more than 1,000 business executives who , in some cases , had the british business sizes , sectors , and regions .
the results of the survey will surprise many .
we have found that the vast majority of companies now operate outside europe and are specialized in countries that are modernising and growing , while the member states are not static .
they want to see new trade links with countries like china , india and brazil being favoured by government , rather than being confronted with the long and exhausting process that obscure eu institutions are to reform .
asked for your opinion on certain legally regulated topics – from the antitrust right to product legislation – the majority of economic leaders believe that the control of this key competences should be transferred to westminster .
there was general dissatisfaction about the internal market , because according to companies , the costs of brussels regulations have now been outweighed by the advantages of being part of europe ’ s trading area – even 40 % of large companies agreed to it .
finally , and this is probably the most important point , our survey of economic leaders showed that a clear majority was moving away from britain towards a change in the agreement and a relationship with the eu that is based on trade , not politics .
this realization , which is shared by companies of all sizes and leading groups , shows that the economy is heading for “ meaningful change , ” which will make the booklet of action return to britain .
it is a matter of a lot – a change in the agreement and better conditions for britain , 16 % would lead to a change of opinion in favour of keeping the eu in a referendum .
the prime minister should have no doubt : this survey shows that the british economy is lagging behind its plan for renegotiations of the british conditions for eu membership .
it also shows that companies are excluded from renegotiating a significant shift in power relations back to britain .
a better deal for the british economy is possible and increasingly necessary , after the eurozone has now entered into a closer economic and monetary union .
the priority must be jobs and growth in britain , as the result of our survey shows , what an increased focus on trade and economic fundamentalism for businesses is for the brussels approach to regulation .
alexei miller of gazprom calls pipeline in bulgaria the beginning of a new gas era in the new era of the european union .
the construction of the south stream pipeline in bulgaria is the start of one of the largest european energy projects , explained the gazprom board .
“ today ’ s event is a milestone : the construction of the bulgarian section of the south stream gas pipeline , the largest and most important project in europe , has begun , ” said the ceo of gazprom .
the project is a key element in the energy security of the entire european continent .
south stream is supposed to ensure more diversity in russia ’ s export routes through europe .
a dispute between gazprom and its counterparts in ukraine , where the majority of the russian gas is for europe , is a serious concern for a greater security of supply for conventional gas .
miller said that the direct link to bulgaria , a member of the european union , means that the countries linked to transit countries are not “ responsible for ever . ”
bulgarian consumers receive gas from south stream at reduced rates , when the entire project is completed in 2015 .
according to gazprom , construction work in other subordinate countries is to be completed on the planned route at the end of the year .
the pipeline is limited to an annual capacity of 62.3 billion cubic metres of natural gas .
for national and international investors , there is no way to get past germany as a real estate location .
the economic framework data is correct , and the funding possibilities are excellent .
this is the tenor of the 9th real estate day of the stock exchange newspaper .
german real estate markets benefit from the economic strength and the good economic conditions in the country , which are good in europe .
christian ulbrich , ceo of europe , has already referred to this by jones lang lasalle , on the 9th real estate day of the stock exchange newspaper .
how did german commercial real estate search work , show the view of the transaction volume , so ulbrich .
in the first three quarters of this year , it was a record 31 % , compared to the previous year &apos;s section .
in the uk , the plus was only 6 % , in france it was 19 % .
&quot; real estate investments offer an attractive interest rate , &quot; said ulbrich .
the yield gap between real estate and federal bonds is set at a historically high level .

hearing before the royal commission : two ymca employees before allegations against jonathan lord for sexual abuse .
two ymca employees from new south wales ( nsw ) are charged with sexual offences related to children .
but the first statement before the commission was made by the ymca that ‘ the organisation has never had to deal with an incident of sexual child abuse ’ .
managing director phillip hare was questioned about a case in which a ymca employee was accused of crimes with child pornography .
hare said gail furness , one of the commission assisting lawyers , that he was caught up in the first case , but he did not know the second .
he admitted that the opening statement of the ymca to the commission was also inaccurate in stating that ‘ it had external reviews , but it was not .
evidence before the commission shows , rather , that the ymca has been informed that it has the second lowest rating of four possible in a quality audit of the department of education .
hares , who won the ymca with 21 , admitted that the management had “ let me take it down ” with the recruitment of lord .
lord was at the beginning of the year accused of sexual offences against twelve boys during his two years of work for the ymca .
he was sentenced to at least six years in prison .
but hare dropped that the ymca was a cultural problem that would prevent employees from using lords .
the staff said they had observed violations , including the fact that lord was alone with children , they were private as babysitters .
danielle ockwell , whose superior lord was and who was trying to train for child protection , was not able to attend the school because of his behavior , said that he was not .
the managing director said that he would not accept statements from employees that they were not dared to meet their superior notification .
instead , he said , they had rather lost their friendship with lord their judgment , which is why they did not have to report him .
hare explained that he has sent a letter to the board of directors of ymca nsw that the lesson the organization learned from the “ jonathan lords interim incident ” is not a lesson .
hare said the decision to force employees to sign confidentiality obligations shortly after the allegations were made was taken by the managing director of the ymca child services , liam whitley .
he said that this should prevent the evidence from being contaminated , but that is ‘ too zealous ’ and poorly implemented .
the ymca nsw was in the time when jonathan lord was in the area between 2009 and 2011 , no organization safe for children , professor stephen smallbone of the griffith group explained .
he explained that there are “ serious problems ” in the recruitment , verification , registration , training and supervision of employees .
the hearing was postponed until 20 december .
tony blair said he would miss the chance of returning as british prime minister – but admits that a comeback is unlikely .
in an interview this evening on the fifth anniversary of his departure , the european union announced that he would be able to make a statement on various domestic issues .
since its resignation in june 2007 , after a decade of government administration , blair has largely avoided becoming a british politician , and his comments have mostly been focused on foreign policy and its role as the quartet ’ s envoy .
when asked whether he would like to be appointed prime minister , he was blamed by the evening standard for london with the words of the prime minister , “ yes , yes , but it is unlikely that the outcome will be ... ”
when the horse show experts were in droves in cardiff to try out the horse of the year , the horse-shock was aware that a tough competition was imminent .
but none of them had been on the three year-old fenton kirkland .
the knirps , which has not even been in the kindergarten and only took its first steps a few months ago , and its shetland pony toffee were ringing around the three rounds and catching the ball .
the inseparable pair , both equal , were forced to leave their home because of their occurrence , behavior , and style in the annual competition organised by sunnybank equestrian centre in rudry .
when he entered competition with men and women with elegant melons , he had lost his beanie in a fat angle and led the two years old daughter of a rope .
fenton was awarded the prize by the judges for his natural skills in handling the pony , which was much above his age .
and toffee received bestmarks for his appearance and personality .
fenton had made toffee a gift last march for his third birthday and since then has been working with the shetland pony every day .
his mother , donna , 30 , said : “ fenton and toffee are a great gem . ”
they had to compete against the whole of the participant field and are equipped with gold cup and rosette .
it was only the second time that he had been competing with toffee and we were all delighted to see him win .

chinese newspaper is to be “ reformed ” after call .
a chinese newspaper , which is on the front page demanding the release of a reporter who has been arrested for defamation , has been accused of being reformed .
the peace process that is based in guangzhou had a rare public call to release the guangzhou journalist , chen yongzhou .
but chen later admitted on television that he had taken bribes to report a partial government firm that had been falsified .
now the new express will be subjected to “ comprehensive rectification , ” explained the regulator .
the “ rectification order ” was issued by the press and publications authority , radio , film and television in guangdong .
preliminary investigations have shown that the new export express , the one leading to the yangcheng evening news group , is between september 2012 and december 2012 .
“ the editorial management of the new express was disordered , ” said the regulator in a statement .
she said that she decided to “ impose an administrative punishment for chen yongzhou and to give him his reporter license . ”
in addition , the yangcheng evening news group was instructed to provide a full rectification of the new express and recommended that the relevant officials be present at the new express and immediately take over the management team of the new express .
chen had published several articles for the new express , in which he reported alleged financial irregularities at a construction machinery manufacturer called zoomlion .
after being arrested , the newspaper published two calls for his release .
but then chen appeared on state television , admitting that he was sending out false reports against payment .
“ in this case i have damaged zoomlion as well as the entire news industry and its ability to restore public confidence . ” he said .
i have done so primarily because i am waiting for money and glory .
i realise that i have acted wrongly .
following chen ’ s apology , the new express issued an apology on the front page , saying that it was failing to provide the reports correctly .

drug tunnel with its own railway between the us and mexico has been discovering the effects of the war on the country &apos;s economy .
one of the most sophisticated tunnels for drug smuggling between the us and mexico , which is completely covered by lighting , ventilation and electric railway .
the us authorities described the 120 times 90 centimeters tunnel as one of the most sophisticated fitting passages they have ever found .
the tunnel that is in the zigzag pattern for almost six football fields is a combination of warehouses in the vicinity of tijuana , mexico , and san diego , usa .
there are countless unbelievable warehouses in the area , making it easier to use drugs lkws .
the tunnel was closed before drugs were transported undetected , and the authorities declared .
when discovering the tunnel , eight and a half tonnes of marijuana and 148 kilograms of cocaine were guaranteed , so the court &apos;s records .
three men who , according to the authorities , were working as drivers were sentenced to death for having and selling marijuana and cocaine .
they face a threat of prison sentences between ten and ten years of imprisonment .
in nogales , arizona , smugglers rely on an extensive underground network of entwicklungscanlen .
the tunnel is the eighth large passage that has been going on in san diego since 2006 .
some of the largest tunnels were built after the marijuana harvest in central mexico in october , which brought the drug cartels to the challenge of quickly transforming their product to the consumer .
in 2010 , authorities took a passage of almost 640 metres long , with rails that were moved from a kitchen in a residential house in tijuana to two warehouses in san diego .

according to the lexicon , veganism is subjected to vegetarianism , but it differs in a very significant way from it .
for while vegetarians can afford to eat sahnetorte , ice or a strong egg , they can also be found in the restaurants .
milk , cheese , egg , besides the renunciation of meat and fish , the vegans refuses to eat any animal products - even honey is denied .
what remains , one might wonder , but when we look at it more closely , the vegan food world is characterised by a considerable ingenuity .
&quot; bread spreads are very popular &quot; , explains ute henkelmann , the owner of the local brewing house , who has a variety of special products for vegans .
also , reuben proctor visits the shop at the domgasse .
for 13 years now , the native new zealand country vegan has lived , in lampertheim he finds ( almost ) everything he needs to live on . &quot; in 1997 i reorganized my diet and became vegetarians &quot; .
at the turn of the century , the next step was taken and i became vegans .
&quot; the conviction came not only because of nutrition but also because of the choice of shoes , &quot; says proctor , the artificial leather prefers normal leather .
he realized that there are also problems in other everyday issues without animal products .
vegan is primarily an ethic .
&quot; i do not want animals to die for me , &quot; proctor speaks the maxim of vegans who are focused on all consumption behaviour .
instead of burgers , stirring eggs or rubber bears , the vegan has quickly become a brand new product that inspires enthusiasm .
&quot; it &apos;s a double bonus , &quot; says proctor today , &quot; in fact vegan does not make his renunciation , not an ascesis , but it &apos;s an enrichment &quot; .
and it is these conditions that have made some people still so well-intentioned attempts to fail .
&quot; the addiction factor is a very important factor that leaves many to give up quickly , similar to smoking , &quot; proctor makes a comparison .
and applies : &quot; certain tastes are not bound by the animal &quot; .
often it is the spices or the type of preparation that will satisfy the taste .
&quot; you can also use the same effect in other ways , &quot; the vegans illustrate .
the barbecue festival is held in the city of proctor , where aubergins , mushrooms and a few vegan sausages are also served .
it is a balanced , varied diet , with a very good diet .
of course , you want to have something between the teeth , that is legitimate .
&quot; it should taste , but this is not only due to animal food , &quot; says proctor .
health damage , including eating disorders , another widespread assumption , has not been suffered .
for me , the changeover was a positive aspect .
i don &apos;t take a foreign cholesterol and have an increased vitamin content .
there are high-performance vehicles that are exclusively vegetable based on vegan .
&quot; my blood values are good , i let myself check often , &quot; reveals proctor .
in particular , the lack of vitamin b12 warns many vegansics .
&quot; since animals are fed with feed rather than on the pasture , the animal is questionable whether the animal is fed in the meat that is stored in the chest that is vitamin b12-50 .
for vegans , there is also the possibility to change the coenzyme in the form of tablets .
&quot; my b12 values are fine , &quot; he explains .
proctor must be used for food procurement in large distances .
after all , basic food is available everywhere , and every supermarket has now got soya milk and other products .
all i need is a local experience .
only occasionally i buy something special .
&quot; many people overlook that only the finished products are expensive , but that is how things are with &quot; ordinary &quot; finished products .
in any case , the preparation of vegan dishes is much cheaper and less time-consuming than usually assumed .
&quot; in the kitchen there is a lot to discover with a few small snacks you can find good , if not better results , &quot; says proctor .
margarine instead of butter , a little more baking powder and carbon dioxide instead of egg , with its vegan cheese cake , proctor was able to astonish his sling-in-law .
family celebrations give the vegans a new spice .
this is dynamic when you cook together , it has a new meaning .
&quot; the situations that can arise in this are as different as the people themselves , &quot; says proctor .
of course , he has already been sceptical .
taste my food no longer ?
&quot; should i feel bad now because i drink milk ? &quot; - with such empty milk i ask .
&quot; i do not reject people , i am part of this society , &quot; proctor does not want to be an enclave deadlines .
and , more precisely , the everyday world does not seem as vegan-like as it would have been imagined - and the vegans are not so restricted in their daily lives as they are generally believed .
fast food is also permitted .
there are pommes everywhere !
&quot; many dozen shops offer falafel , or even a vegetarian yufka , &quot; says proctor .
in a pizzeria he is a pasta dish , or ordered a pizza without cheese .
the restaurants are getting ready for it .
&quot; when i started to work for vegan 13 years ago , everything was still much more difficult &quot; , the new zealand country can predict a development : &quot; you have to deal with people who are preparing to do so . &quot;
&quot; if there are enough requests , you might be inclined to change the menu &quot; , hoping he will .
vegane restaurants are developing , such as the mannheim combustion house or the vogelfrei café .
proctor wants to make other restaurants at least a vegan dish on the menu .
in fact , vegan dishes are available to everyone .
everyone can eat them , so they are exactly the opposite of exclusive .
&quot; meat dishes are exclusive , however , and in the truest sense of the word , because they exclude others , &quot; says proctor .
&quot; when we want to avoid food scandals , veganism is a safe way to treat the vast majority of the food from the outset &quot; says proctor .
vegan purchases can be a little difficult at the beginning .
especially when you learn to understand that is also used in peanuts animal additives as a color encoder , you seem to be satisfied with the ethics of so many obstacles and fall quickly of courage .
this is not the only reason why reuben proctor and lars thomsen have written a book : &quot; veganissimo - animal ingredients and their alternatives &quot; explains the many ingredients that produce food and also cleaning agents .
&quot; gradually , a scanning view is developed and we know which characters and logos you have to pay attention to &quot; it is sometimes better to do small steps than to stand standing or stumble &quot; , proctor knows .
veganism , it is an important moral fingertip , which is aimed at consciousness .
perhaps he does not quite manage to change his habits , but at least he can teach consumers to change their habits critically .

tax on foreign property owners against london ’ s speculative bubble
the treasury has provisionally adopted the cgt measure , but is still waiting for the final decision of schatzkeller george osborne to be taken in the 2012 budget .
already , the income from the stamp tax on housing in the districts of westminster and kensington &amp; chelsea , which is already higher than in the fiscal year 2012 / 13 , at £ 708 million , is higher than that was paid .
cook said : “ after the increases in stamp tax on high-price housing and housing , and the introduction of the associated legislation against a circumstance , it is hard to say that high-quality properties are too low , regardless of the impact of allocations .
“ but this move could make some foreign investors more reluctant to buy property in london , or to prevent owners from selling , ” he added .
first-class properties – the top five to ten percent of the housing market at price – in the wealthy southwest belt of london , which is surrounded by the rich southwest belt of fulham to wimbledon .
prices in central london were at an even level of 5.6 % annually , but were forecast to rise by an emerging “ domestic market . ”
scientists have been able to give more light to the context in which the tail dizziness of a dog is related to its mood .
previous research showed that happy dogs are not allowed to cook more right with the tail ( from the point of view of the dog ) , while nervous dogs are more likely to get the left side .
but scientists now say that other dogs do not perceive these subtle differences and can react to them .
professor georgio vallortigara , a neuroscientist of the university of trento , said : “ in man , it is well known that the left and right brain half react differently to stimuli , which is positive or negative .
here we have tried to do this with other species .
he also noted that dogs , like humans , have the right brain half for the movement of the left side .
to learn more about how dogs are placed on the side swings of their species , please visit the site of the breeders who watch the animals while those films are directed by other dogs .
they measure the heart rate of the four-legged and analyzed the behavior .
we will probably soon understand why the tail is in one place , sometimes in the other .
professor vallortigara said : “ we have given the dogs movies – either a natural gesture version or a silver version – to show off the deflective other aspects .
when the animals saw how an otherwise unexpressive dog could get the tail to the right ( from the perspective of the weaving dog from the perspective of ) , they remained completely relaxed .
but was the tail inclination mainly left ( again from the perspective of the dog , the wedge ) , so their heart rate rose and they sawed uncalmly .
professor vallortigara believes that the dogs do not intentionally communicate with each other through these movements .
rather , he is convinced that the dogs should have learned from experience , at which movements they should worry and when not .
he said , ‘ if you have different encounters with other dogs and you want to wedge your cock in one direction rather than friendly behavior , and the right side is more of a less friendly behavior , you react to the base .
researchers say that the findings are dog owners , who have been diagnosed with the disease , and vets and trainers have improved their emotions .
john bradshaw , expert on dog behaviour and guest scholarship at the faculty of animal medicine of the university of bristol , said that this is not the first study that we are studying whether this is true .
last year , a team of lincoln university found that dogs head to the left , when they have an aggressive dog .
in another research at the university of victoria in canada , the following was : “ dogs are more likely to go to a robot dog if their tail is left wedelt and not right , rather than uncalmly .
he said that the differences could result from the fact that the dogs in the various studies are the animals in the films or the robot dogs are not interpreted as dogs .
a study on how dogs react to real dogs could help , he explained .
“ although there is considerable evidence of many different mammals that the two brain halves are used for various purposes , they need to be more precise than many details – and dogs are not an exception , ” says bradsson .
however , as their behaviour is easy to record , it will probably not take long for us to understand why the tail is sometimes in one , sometimes in the other , direction .

pope francis appoints the first cardinal to be appointed in february .
pope francis will be the first to receive new cardinals from the catholic church on 22 february , as the vatican announced on thursday .
the cardinals are the highest clerics in the catholic church after the pope and they are also the ones who have a pope , so that francis is can be the first group of men to appoint .
there are currently 201 cardinals .
however , a cardinal who is 80 years old cannot be brought to the pope &apos;s election – the result of a group of 120 “ electorate cardinals ” .
in a statement in which the news was announced , father federico loombardi said that he was speaking to the vatican , that there would be a meeting of all cardinals before the ceremonies were held .
&quot; pope francis decided to change his decision to convene the convention , &quot; he said in advance .
jack valero of catholic voices said that the number of eligible cardinals was rising by february .
he said that a pope normally appoint as many cardinals as necessary to keep the number of eligible polls in the top half of the country , and so many cardinals about 80 , as he would like .
the consistency story next year is important because the us is the first since the election of franciscan monarch in march .
at the moment there is a certain overhang on the part of europe and , in particular , italy .
“ it will be interesting to see if the new pope , cardinals from the rest of the world , will be appointed to restore balance , ” he said .
forty per cent of catholics live in south america , but they have only a tiny number of cardinals .
the cardinals will also be the first to have been held since the formation of the franziskus council of cardinals , a group of eight cardinals from the whole world , the council of europe .
in the past , the pope decided everything alone .
“ now francis has taken this eight cardinals to help him , ” he said .
he said that it was “ possible ” that francis would not have the cardinals for advice .
but we have not been in this situation – that is all very new .
valero said that typically the bishops are from large places to cardinals .

desperate cry from an obama electorate
i have elected president obama twice in the hope that change is possible , and i have asked him to do so twice in the hope that change is possible .
he says obama has made laudable efforts to address the challenges posed by blockading republicans .
the blockade policy does not excuse the website problems of obamacare , the drone attacks on the internet , the drone attacks on the internet , the drone attacks on the internet , the attacks on the internet , and the internet .
obama ’ s memoirs of the 2008 election campaign are a sad reminder of what might have been possible .
nathaniel p. morris is a student of the harvard medical university in the second year .
i am currently reading a terrible book .
it is a book that i thought it would make me feel more at home during the miserable second year of my medical studies .
it is called the audacity to win ( courage to win ) and describes the memoirs barack obama and his wife , barack obama , for the 2008 presidential election .
when i talk to my patients &apos; records in the evening and go to bed , the book will take me back to a time when politics inspired millions and gave a speech the breath .
the election became a landslide victory and news spokesman , in order to demonstrate the historic importance of this hour .
my classmates wept with joy and my parents gathered all the newspapers they could find .
a young team of visionaries was on their way to the white house and the nation was ready for change .
when obama came into office in 2008 , he had received 82 % approval ratings .
and then i close the book .
switch back to the present is a bad awakening , as if you were torn out of a dream .
it is difficult to remember these optimistic times – they seem to be a vague memory , a sad mourning of lost expectations , and a sad reminder of the past .
in the years since i first voted , the european parliament has actually changed .
but it is just nothing i could have imagined .
i recognise the great and versatile things obama has achieved , from the adoption of the affordable care act to the health insurance act to the military withdrawal from the iraq war .
i agree that the party political blockade tactic is too much to be desired .
but after having read the obama administration to colleagues and acquaintances countless times , i am not satisfied with my attempts to explain .
i have one point of political despair .
the republican blockade policy cannot explain why intercepting foreign state leaders is not allowed .
it cannot explain why the national security agency has to collect data on the private lives of americans and why whistleblowers are punished , which are causing public misconduct .
it cannot explain why anwar al-awlaki , an american statesman , was unable to be murdered without trial , nor why the public funding and spending limits were not abolished during the presidential elections .
it does not justify the results of a report which says that the white house &apos;s efforts to calm the media are the “ aggressive and ... the most aggressive since the nixon government . ”
and , more recently , it cannot excuse the inability to make a difference in the more than three years since the adoption of the affirmative care act .
i do not know whether it is what i should have expected .
whether i should have understood at 18 , that the government work is not in line with the previous political campaigns .
obviously , the mep ’ s office is not a predictable course , as an opposition party and accidental events such as the newtown-massacre shape public debate .
but when i look at the examples mentioned above , they seem to be largely elected by the government itself .
and that bothers me the most .
i re-elected obama in 2012 , not because i was enthusiastic about his candidacy .
mitt romney has presented a confusing and undeveloped alternative , but he seemed to be moving in direction and positions .
i had the impression that a second term for obama , free of the pressure of future elections , would fulfil the hope that we have heard for so long .
but , with the fall in approval values for obama to below 45 % this week , returning to 2008 has been reduced by the harder .
it awakens in me the longing for the many promises that have disappeared into thin air .
this week i read a section in the book describing how obama could prevent a severe loss against clinton in the pennsylvania pre-election .
in a meeting with the electoral aides after the decision , he said to his staff that they had to get back on track and follow the purpose of their cause .
“ i want us to find our magic , ” he said .
we must remember who we are .
five years later , mr president , and i could give you more support .
the message expressed in this comment is exclusively the opinion expressed by nathaniel morris .
clive palmer claims that prime minister tony abbott has had a conflict of interests over parental leave .
the billionaire and member of parliament , clive palmer , says that prime minister tony abbott would be in conflict with his plans for parental leave because his daughters are becoming pregnant and could benefit from it .
the mining magnat , which is in a court dispute over the payment of $ 6 million in carbon tax , was the claim of the mining company asking questions .
the palmer united party could win up to four votes in the senate , which are important for deciding whether the co2 and mining taxes should be abolished or reduced .
but palmer claimed that only ministers could have conflicts of interest , and that abbott ’ s daughters would personally benefit from the laws .
“ he is in a major conflict of interest when it comes to paid parental leave , because if one of his daughters becomes pregnant , he has a direct interest in whether or not she gets a holiday , ” said palmer .
two months after the election , the palmer election commission announced 53 votes ahead after the recount officially declared winner of the sunshine day .
palmer called for a revision of the voting count process to allow it to proceed more quickly .
tony abbott ’ s daughters , frances and bridget .
if these elections were to take place two months after the vote was over , then i would ask you to consider the matter .
“ we need a better system , ” he said .
why should we not have a system where we invade , collect data in a computer , and then choose the system that is needed at 6 : 30 a.m.
palmer also criticized the use of pencils when marking ballot papers .
if you use them , because you can erase the results if you do not like them ?
nowadays , voting with pencils is incredible .
the electoral commission has made a check on the options for electronic voting and recently adopted a joint legislative proposal with new zealand .
palmer , 59 , explained that to his policy an international airport for the sunshine coast belonged and that he had his new office “ very serious ” .
a public office is about serving the public .
“ we don ’ t seek rewards other than those of history , namely that we are serving at a critical time of this community , ” he said .
rbs suspends two currency vendors
the royal bank of scotland has two dealers from its forex department suspended , so two people who are familiar with the situation ; this is another indicator of how the world economy is being held up by the mutters .
some of the world ’ s largest banks , including ubs , barclays , deutsche bank , and rbs , confirmed that they had been working with the authorities in the world ’ s largest financial market , where 5.3 trillion dollars are spent daily .
the two vendors would be the first rbs employees to be listed in the expanding investigation that the scandal of the libor-interbank business has brought about .
the bank , which does not comment on the suspension , confirmed that the bank had not given a response to information requests from authorities this month .
“ our investigations into this subject continue and we cooperate fully with the fca and other regulatory authorities , ” said the bank before two weeks ago .
last month , the situation was reported to close people that the rbs had not read the records of emails and instant messages sent to and from a former merchant to the uk supervisory authority , the financial congress .

rohan ramchandani , head of the european spot trading company at citi , was leave this week and matt gardiner , formerly the leading currency trader at barclays and ubs , was awarded the standard this week .
none of these traders has been accused of any kind of misconduct .
instant messaging group of usher included bankers at barclays and the citigroup , said the situation ’ s close friends .
ubs announced this week that they are taking steps against some of their employees after the swiss regulatory authority finma declared that they had a suspected breach of the law on forex when it was a number of swiss banks .
at least six authorities worldwide – the european commission , finma , the swiss competition authority weko , the fca , the us justice department , and hong kong monetary authority – have been working on this .
hsbc , citigroup , jpmorgan and credit suisse have also initiated internal investigations or have received information requests from authorities , said with the situation familiar persons .
banks crack through instant messages and emails from several years in search of cases of misconduct .
the news of these investigations has been of great concern to dealers in an area which has been a major source of profit in recent years .
some bankers have tried to play down the affair and said that it is almost impossible to stop the extended and high-level liabilities of foreign exchange .
a leading trader noted that despite the enormous daily volume in forex trading , the fragmentation of liquidity between the various trading platforms has not been eliminated and the increasing use of its own internal platforms has led to the creation of “ .
the news came out the same day as credit suisse announced that she had sent a retailer of her london exchange traded funds office this week .
the bank immediately informed the competent authorities and cooperates with them .
“ we are sure that the dealer has acted alone and that the matter is being contained , ” said credit suisse .

the planned covering of the decaying house in the rear part of the property was not allowed for safety reasons , because the site is in danger of slipping off .
alfred abel , who currently manages the plot , had the embellishment action with his colleague reinhard domke of the bi .
before the bi ’ s action , a transparent message was sent out , saying &apos; we are in favour &apos; .
this disturbed the 20 or so members of the citizens &apos; initiative little about their action .
your motto on the big poster was &quot; we are against building ruins &quot; .
in so doing , it wanted to respond to the danger of even greater ruins on the swiss meadow - should the giant project fail one day .
in conversation with many passers-by before the &quot; construction site &quot; it became clear that some citizens believe that the city ’ s project will be better for many , although not many will have the same questions about the dimension of the presented project .
but they are beginning to resign because the city wants to delay these responses further , it is said by the bi .
as we have heard , public statements by the mayor also have an impact .
may had a meeting of the local council saying that he would do the same for the thermal bath if the population were to be against the plans for a bathing and spa bath complex at the civic decision .
some seem to be therefore quite frightened , others find it &quot; crude &quot; .
the bi thanked the donors for the color and all helpers .
rangnick shells for schiris : mane is not a swallow king , but a king of swallows .
so satisfied ralf rangnick with the current high shape of bundesliga table leader red bull salzburg is , so disappointed showed his first appearance in the &quot; bulls &quot; of the shooting teams .
&quot; there is a dangerous trend now that mane and alan are being placed in the category of swallow kings , &quot; he took the two offensive wigglers on thursday at a press conference in salzburg .
the latest occasion for rangnick ’ s critique was yellow for mane at the 3-0 against grödig last sunday , when the senegalese was accused of acting as a crime - the free time .
&quot; a blatant misdecision , &quot; rangnick said , the referee harkam was called &quot; completely overloaded &quot; .
harkam would also have contributed &quot; his part &quot; to the escalation between salzburg coach roger schmidt and grödig trainer adi hütter after the match .
his german compatriot , he defended : &quot; i would have been behaving like roger schmidt &quot; in every single situation .
schmidt himself wants to be named after the hut with the hütter .
i do not know why .
&quot; for i am the one who was insulted , &quot; the 46-year-old stressed .
given the success rate , rangnick agreed to a praise .
&quot; there are only two words for this : really good , &quot; he said .
there is not much to be said about .
in particular , the way in which the team plays is impressive .
that is the way it should continue .
kader changes in the winter transfer time will hardly be possible .
there are no great reasons to change anything .
&quot; except a player asks for his or her leave , &quot; he said .
supreme court confirms obama ’ s health law
it is a great victory for the obama administration : the us supreme court decided today to reconsider the issue closely with barack obama .
by five to four votes , judges ruled that the patient ’ s individual mandate was insufficient to protect and affordable care act – it forces us officials to take action by 2014 .
chief judge john roberts suggested that the us should be divided into four more liberal members , while the judges were scuba , thomas , alito , and kennedy .
the court also confirmed the remaining sections of the 2700 pages of the law and also represented the view that the provision of health law , according to which states may have to meet either the access requirements for medicaid or all other state health regulations .
the legal proceedings against the law were conducted by 26 states and the national federation of independent states .
the law was signed by all the leading republican presidential candidates , including the ultimate challenger mitt romney , in the 2012 pre-election campaign , strongly opposed .
norway : norway is a place where giant mirrors of light and light are reflected .
with huge mirrors , the inhabitants of a norwegian village have shed light on their dark valley .
because of the low solar level , the solar system in vestfjord valley is sinking from autumn to spring .
with three gigantic reflectors at 45 meters height , a space of centuries was realized on wednesday .
&quot; finally ! &quot; , mayor steinar bergland shattered at the start ceremony in the tv2 channel .
some talented people turned sunchairs , others set safety standards for sunglasses .
so far , sun-hungry people have had to go to a nearby summit with a cable car in the winter .
ten years ago , the local artist martin andersen presented the proposal to convert the rays into the valley with mirrors .
this basic idea has been in existence since 1913 .
after several years of debate , the city council finally had the 5 million kroner ( about 615 000 euros ) expensive project .
a similar construction has been giving the italian alpine village viganella a winter sunshine for several years .
post barely empties on sunday
&quot; many citizens will not have noticed yet the red points for the sunday leg are in the middle of various letters boxes .
a fdp request confirmed this .
on sundays and holidays , only before the post office building in ernst-ludwig-straße 36 and in the jakob müller-strasse 1 in hüttenfeld are emptied .
whether in hofheim and rosengarten , there is still sunday to be emptied , the answer to the fdp ’ s question will not be answered .
the social and youth political spokesman of the fdp , fritz rohrenbeck , wants to make up the minds here .
sunday empty is particularly important for terminals .
&quot; this company is thin on the ground despite the price increase for letters in january 2013 , despite the radical and unreasonable increase in the price . &quot;
thomas bittner , fratern- and stadtverbund der liberals , supports his group colleagues : &quot; what annoys me is the fact that klamm secretly uses the letting times to change or even delete .
from the point of view of the public , the post office is a long way from here .
&quot; at least the mailboxes in the districts of neuschloß and rosengarten must be emptied again on sunday &quot; , says bittner and röhrenbeck unisono .
the city of applied , especially not mobile citizens , would also have to have a box with sunday empty on foot .
rohrenbeck asked in the city parliament whether the city council had discussions with the post on this matter .
mayor erich maier answered that the post office did not communicate with lampertheim .
to his knowledge , however , there are also a sunday lunch in hofheim .
your party has advocated privatisation .
&quot; then decisions are made elsewhere , &quot; said maier .
frankfurt parking charges should increase sharply .
parking in frankfurt could be very expensive .
the city of magistrate this morning is discussing the submission of traffic deceptive stefan majer ( green ) .
therefore , parking charges are to be increased by 50 % .
however , this is not to raise prices , but to increase the interval of time between parking and parking ticket machines from 30 to 20 minutes .
in december , the city ’ s governing council will have to decide .
the ihk frankfurt retail committee considers that &quot; not a good idea &quot; .
the parking facility just before the shop is &quot; a not to be underestimated advantage for smaller retailers &quot; .
the transport club germany believes that an increase after two decades is &quot; perfectly reasonable and long overdue &quot; .
public transport will also be more expensive .
freudenstadt : fast actions are overwhelming hosts of the event .
with a narrow veil , messrs i of the tsv freudenstadt had to be in the schiller school gym in reutlingen against the tg gniningen from the swabian alb .
the elders were confronted with an experienced team on the other side of the net .
but soon it became apparent that she was able to cope with the rapid actions of the freudenstädter , also due to age factors .
with the hard and placed surcharges , the patricians did extremely hard .
repeatedly , they missed the promises made by simon schenk and eduard schulz over the network center and attacks and were at the standstill when it came to block defense .
two high first sentence profits clearly demonstrated the superiority of the freudenstädter in all aspects .
in the face of this crushing and gambling achievement , the third sentence was then slightly lax and lackluster at the 3 : 0-end ( 25 : 13 , 25 : 14 , 25 : 22 ) .
on 2 november , the tv baiersbronn , located in nagold , will be a much more powerful opponent in the field .
tsv freudenstadt i : dominik bäuerle , yannik büchle , sebastian dölker , felix pälchen , stefan räller , simon schenk and eduard schulz .
in the b class , the murgtalhalle in baiersbronn had the second teams from baiersbronn and freudenstadt .
they delivered a highly competitive two-hour match , and the result was a good one .
nervousness on both sides caused a lot of trouble and puncture gifts , especially during the balloon ; the accuracy of passports was sometimes flawed and in some critical scenes prevented the superficial movement from taking a look .
in this high-performance , very balanced meeting , the tsv team of marcus blasutto consistently agreed the great physical effort and a strong sense of commitment of both teams .
care day at the small englander hut in the england-hut
the fifth day of care in the aftermath of natura 2000 project on upper hotzenwald was attended by a group of dedicated participants at the small english-hut in ibach .
on the basis of popular suggestions , the first step was to take a look at the valley in the area of the hut , said mayor helmut kaiser .
many hikers , kaiser said , described this area as the glamour of the gorge , on which the landscape is the ideal setting for wonderful views of the valley .
he thanked the attendant for their willingness to cooperate and stressed that the day of care is a suitable tool for making the connection between man and nature stronger .
it gives every citizen the opportunity to become accents themselves in nature .
at the same time , the tourism aspect could also be taken into account in terms of the environment .
this ecological aspect was explained by friederike tribukait of the department of natural protection of the regional bureau of freiburg following the welcome by the landrat tilman bollacher , who took over the patronage .
the tourist destination of wide-angle is , according to tribukait , the aim of the now heavily grown old allmendweidfeld with its specific protected habitat types to be preserved by opening and connecting to the still existing .
certain species , such as rare butterflies and grass pans , can break down barriers in the form of forest land .
you need these free connections to conservation .
tribukait said that she wanted to not miss it here , to take a lance to break for the planned biosphere area .
in this planning , the current measure not only seamlessly adds to it .
a biosphere reserve also offers the chance to achieve sustainable economic and environmental development .
having said that , christoph wehle and life-project manager told us that they were going to be the helper in groups .
the larger trees were already beaten in advance , the forest trawler was available , if necessary .
a group of helpers should be concerned about exempting school-and-children from the use of a dry-stone belt .
the goal was to have a clear view at the viewpoint .

google , samsung , huawei because of nortel patents , has been sued for nortel patents .
the group , which had received thousands of previous nortel patents , made a lawsuit of class action on thursday .
rockstar , the consortium that holds the nortel patents for $ 4.5 billion , has been suing samsung electronics for a new product , the samsung electronics co ltd . , huawei and the company .
rockstar is a joint ownership of apple , microsoft , blackberry , ericsson and sony .
google is used in seven cases of patent infringement .
patents do not cover technology that is used to identify search terms on the internet with relevant advertising , so the complaint that they place at the heart of google &apos;s search engine business .
samsung , huawei , htc and rockstar representatives were not directly accessible .
samsung , huawei and htc are making cell phones that are compatible with google &apos;s android operating system , which is in sharp competition with mobile products from apple and microsoft .
in 2011 , google announced an initial bid for more than $ 900 million for the nortel patents .
google increased its offer several times and last offered 4.4 billion dollars .
after the nortel patents were rejected by rockstar , the company acquired a new license for motorola mobility for 12.5 billion dollars , a business that also contributed to the development of motorola &apos;s library .
“ although google failed in its attempt to make the patent pending , it was not able to do so .
rockstar claims a high compensation from google , because it claims to have committed google &apos;s patent infringement deliberately , so the accusation .
egypt is sworn by first freely-elected presidents
mohammed morsi is the oath of authority , but his day of triumph is not likely to be the end of political disputes in egypt .
islamist mohammed morsi promised a “ new egypt , ” when he was the first freely elected president of the country to be sworn in , and thus the successor of husni mubarak , who had lived 16 months earlier .
in its inauguration to the supreme constitutional court , morsi became the first freely elected arab president and egyptian fifth president of the arab world since the fall of the monarchy .
he put the oath before the 18 men dressed in black robes of the court , which had its seat on the nile and an ancient egyptian temple .
“ we strive for a better future , a new egypt and a second republic , ” morsi said at the ceremony that took place live on state television .
“ today , the egyptian people have laid the foundation for a new life – absolute freedom , real democracy and stability , ” said the 60-year-old morsi , a us-trained engineer and a muslim brotherhood member .
hundreds of soldiers and policemen guarded the building when morsi was attacked in a hospital in a small car convoy shortly after 11 a.m.
only a few hundred supporters had gathered in the court to give the new president a remembrance , and , unlike the presidential prunk from the mubarak era , the traffic was only stopped for a short time , so the president was stopped .
as an uncharismatic “ spare wheel ” of the brotherhood , his personal prestige has been mocked since his victory and a friday speech , in which he has not only shown himself to be a candidate of islamists , but all .
“ egypt is now a civilian , national , constitutional , and modern state , ” said the president of the united states , who has been dressed in a blue suit with red tie .
morsi later went to cairo university , where he began his inaugural speech .
he was officially supported by a army band that had the national anthem , who he had been in possession of .
military leader feldmarshal hussein tantawi was present .
on his arrival he was welcomed by hundreds of present in the largest auditorium of the university with speakers of “ the army and the people are a hand . ”
the first bastion of the city of vienna in 1908 , built as a bastion of secular education , was established in the 1970s as a stronghold of islamist student groups .
morsi presented a symbolic oath on friday ’ s tahir square , the birthplace of the uprising that was held at the end of authoritarian rule in mubarak last year , and he praised it .
but , with the removal of official oath to the court , not as usual in parliament , he is bowing to the military ’ s will , which indicates that the power struggle will continue .
morsi ’ s speech at tahir square was full of dramatic populist gestures .
falkenberger discothek provides two great evenings for two nights .
the new season in the falkenberger discothek &quot; blue velvet &quot; has started .

rapist in south africa : two lifelong detention
nine months after the brutal rape and mutilation of a 17-year-old girl in south africa , the culprit was sentenced to two life on friday .
the station sabc reported this .
the victim was later involved in the consequences of serious injuries .
johannes kana was already responsible for the crime earlier this week .
the act had caused horror nationwide .
the then 21 year-old had been anene booysen in february in an industrial site in bredasdorp near cape town .
14 hours of the doctors struggled to survive the victim , but in vain .
the sight of the young people was so horrible that the carers and sisters needed psychological assistance .
kana admitted during the trial that he was on the night of the night with booysen in a bar .
he also confessed that they were beaten and raped , but he denied that he was responsible for the death of the girl .
the police were initially run by several offenders , but released two suspects from prison , because the occupying forces were not able to prove them .
the public prosecutor also stressed during the procedure that it was convinced that kana was not ready at the time of the attack .
rape has been almost an everyday occurrence in south africa : there are approximately 64 000 indictments annually for sexual violence .
that is almost ten times the amount in germany , but it is still much more populated than south africa ( 50 million ) , with 82 million people .
police and women ’ s associations in south africa estimate the number of cases of sexual violence to be 10-25 times higher .

the darker the meat , the higher the ph value .
&quot; i am curious to see your roberto blanco measure what happens then &quot; , says jumbo zynisch .
this is where the level of private television is presented in pure culture .

they thought that travel agencies were a thing of the past thanks to the internet ?
flight centre seems to be resisting the trend .
the company has increased its earnings prospects for the whole year and expects record revenues from holiday makers in australia and the uk .
the travel company is now starting to profit from adjusted earnings before taxes between 325 and 340 million dollars , compared to 305 to 315 million dollars in its previous forecast .
if the current target values are achieved , then this means growth of 12 to 17 % compared to the record profit of 290.4 million dollars in the period 2011 / 12 .
as managing director graham turner announced , flight centre achieved a record 8 % profit in the first half of the year and had a strong start in the second half , especially in australian and british private business .
“ since the beginning of the year , our ten countries have been profitable , and some of them are well on track to record annual earnings before interest and taxes , ” he said .
these include australia and the uk , which are typically among our strongest beneficiaries .
in australia , the leisure industry has recovered in the second half of the year , which has created a slightly weaker market for business travel .
it was also similar for flightcentre &apos;s leisure activities in the uk , while business customers were also spending less here .
the us business recovered from the weaker first half of the year , with seasonal deflation , making a profit for the full year expected .
flight centre shares rose by 3 cents yesterday to 38.20 dollars .
schools are becoming more focused on mathematics , spelling and grammar .
in courses on english literature , students must in future receive at least one piece of shakespeare , a 19th century novel , romantic lyrics and contemporary british novels .
the test also includes “ unseen texts ” to help broader understanding of reading .
the combined course of english literature and language will be abolished .
from 2015 , students must undertake an independent gcse examination of language , with strong incentives to learn english literature as a separate quality .
the ministry of education will be presenting the new english and mathematics curricula tomorrow – the first subjects that have been radically redesigned .
other core subjects will be changed next year .
a separate initiative will be devoted to ofpain , the supervisory authority for audits , a reorganization of gcse structures , including a new bending system and fewer exchange rates .
in a summer speech , minister for education , michael gove , said that there is “ a broad consensus that we need to reform our audit system to restore public confidence , ” emphasising that the gcses would “ challenge . ”
studies show that in english schools , less time is spent on mathematics – 116 hours a year or three hours a week per school year – than in most other countries .
in contrast , australian schools teach an average of 143 hours a year , and students in singapore receive 138 hours .
although there will be no formal requirement to set up more time for mathematics in the timetable , it is not possible to use coalition groups to make full mathematics – combined with a stronger weight .
the curriculum focuses more on “ problems from the right life ” , including financial mathematics .

salem : johanna rahner at the ecumenical forum of talks in the ecumenical forum of talks in the czech republic .
the next ecumenical forum on monday , 21 october , at the new museum of the castle , is about the topic &quot; hell with hell - theological considerations on the way the last things are handled today &quot; .
lecturer is professor johanna rahner .
the ecumenical forum for discussion is an initiative of the catholic and protestant church communities of salem , the castle of salem and the cultural centre of lake constance .
johanna rahner wants to look at the forum of how people can now understand the &quot; last things &quot; after death .
if people had been convinced over the past centuries that this was too much , and if they had been put on those images of heaven and hell , &quot; which characterise our ideas to this day , &quot; the contemporary prophecy teaching of the lord is of the perfect .
&quot; the greater hope is for christians through the critique of religion .
she has &quot; given us so many question marks that the exclamation marks are hanging over us &quot; .
johanna rahner says further : &quot; but the crucial challenge remains the anger of death &quot; .
this raises the question of the desire to &quot; bear the dreams of the end of the day &quot; .
johanna rahner , born in baden-baden in 1962 , studied katholiche theology and biology at the albert-ludwigs-universität freiburg from 1982 to 1989 .
she received her phd in 1997 as a phd student , also in freiburg .
the habilitation of fundamental theology and ecumenical theology followed in 2003 at the westfalian wilhelms-universität .
since 2010 johanna rahner has been teaching systematic theology at the institute of catholic theology of the university of kassel .

illmensee : second mountain bike race enthusiasts with participants in the biking race .
in fine weather 214 cyclists came to illmensee to take the tour of the hills and mountains around the lake .
this is what ulrich knobel tells of the organising sports club illmensee .
among the participants were , in particular , on the short distance of 15 kilometres and 300 metres of altitude , numerous cyclists who had their hobby in competition .
two junior drivers of the german top class were also present at the start of this competition : felix bader from bad waldsee and pascal treubel from aach-linz came up with the recommendation of good rankings .
these two could , as expected , withstand the field .
as in the previous year , felix bader could have a small advance in the time to the finish and defended his title as the overall winner of short distance .
in second place , pascal treubel was once again able to place himself in the position of the third place .
the staff were very friendly and helpful .
in second place , anne adel from illmensee and leonie driver from the owingen took the place of three .
a welcome development is the increasing number of drivers who are in the municipality or who work in it .
not only in terms of performance , the entire range of athletes was represented .
the age structure was also ranked among the top ten in the top 70 in the top ten of the top ten .
in the main race this year were even more absolute top athletes .
four drivers were able to take off from the regional top drivers .
among them philipp pangerl , a mountainbike semi-professional from the black tusk racing team .
pangerl was a team member twice in the twelve-hour race .
this year he became european champion in this special discipline .
with roland ballerstedt , who has won two german championships in the duathlon , he is also a member of the german team .
after 45 kilometres and 900 metres of altitude , a whirlwind came to the finish in the finish before the three-lake halle .
pangerl was the first to hit the finish line .
only a second behind it could the routine ballerstedt get second place in the overall rating .
at the same time hermann and warthmann came to the finish as the third in the overall rating .
in the ladies &apos; ranking , christian cohsmann was the fastest in the main race .
the second place was won by areane blersch from binding forces before natascha werner from stuttgart .
athletes and helpers were very pleased with the smooth and well-organized process of the event .
on the way through mud , rivers and jungles for free medical care
dr. georges bwelle provides free medical assistance in remote villages in cameroon .
bwelle and his team spend nearly every weekend trying to treat hundreds of patients .
in the west african country , there are not many doctors , only one for 5,000 people , only one for 5,000 people .
do you agree with your mobile phone here or with your mobile device ?
dr. georges bwelle is one of the top 10 of the “ cnn heroes of 2013 ” .
you can choose for him or any of the other heroes in the top 10 to make him the “ cnn hero of the year . ”
the winner gets $ 250,000 to continue his exceptional work .
for 21 years , georges bwelle looked at how his sick father kept losing consciousness and becoming hospitals , which were not connected with the means to prevent him .
jamef bwelle was born in 1981 in a car accident near yaoundé , the capital cameroon .
first he had only a broken arm , but then the first was formed a inflammation that was based on his brain .
“ there was no neurosurgeon in cameroon , ” says georges bwelle .
we should have brought it out of cameroon if we had had the money .
instead , bwelle spent years trying to get his father into overcrowded clinics and hospitals to be there to help .
“ it ’ s not easy , ” comments bwelle .
you can enjoy the view of the lake and the mountains .
there are a great many patients .
some people even die because they have to wait .
the situation has hardly changed since bwell &apos;s father died in 2002 .
in cameroon , there is only one doctor per 5,000 people , according to the world health organization .
on the other hand , the relationship in the united states is with a doctor for 413 people .
but even if there was a doctor for them , most cameroons could not afford to visit .
two out of five people in the country live below the poverty line and nearly three-quarters of health spending in the country is private .
“ the only problem you have is poverty , ” says bwelle .
and poverty makes it impossible to enjoy life .
his father and so many of his compatriots had to be seen in bwelle to take action against this .
dr. georges bwelle and his volunteer team have launched 700 free operations last year .
he became a doctor himself and works as a vascular surgeon in the central hospital in yaoundé .
he also founded a non-profit organization called ascovime , which was moved to rural areas at weekends and where free medical care is offered .
since 2008 , he and his volunteer group have helped nearly 32,000 people .
almost every friday he and up to 30 people are forced to travel in minibuses and ride with the snowed medical equipment on the roof over unsecured terrain .
not everything is always going smoothly .
they have had to cross the rivers and sludge more than once .
but when they arrive , they will receive as heroes : a feast , song , and dance , and the best accommodation the place to offer .
in these villages , free medical care is really a cause of celebration and blowing – with its broad smile and its boundless energy – is happy to be at the happy party .
the next morning the team starts to investigate hundreds of patients .
“ we treat 500 people per journey , ” said bwelle .
they come from a 60 km radius around the village – and that on foot .
each of these weekend clinics offers medical care in a number of areas .
many people are being held in prison for malaria , tuberculosis , malnutrition , diabetes , parasites and sexually transmitted diseases .
others get crutches , donated glasses or free birth certificates – a document that is required for school , but which is often simply not available to many poor families .
in the evening , the team carries out simple operations with local anaesthesia .
the operations are usually carried out in a school , town hall or apartment , and after the intervention patients are on the way and go to the recreation area to make room for the next one .
the lighting for the op and the disinfection equipment is provided by the generator of the group and so bwelle and its volunteers work up to the early morning hours on sunday .
it is a hard job , but the village musicians help to make the team motivation and to keep it motivated .
&quot; they are drumming all night so that we can stay awake and continue our work , &quot; says bwelle .
on sunday the team then goes back to the city , tired but proud of the work done .
the group – a mixture of cameroon doctors and foreign medical students – has launched 700 free surgeries last year , and knows that their work makes a huge difference to people who are helped .
one man explained that the free operation of a broken performance that he received was now able to allow him to work again .
“ this is changing the future of my family , ” said the man .
in addition to weekend clinics and his work as a surgeon in the hospital , bwelle also works at night in private clinics in yaoundé .
with this second job , he finances 60 % of his non-profit activity , so bwelle ; the rest of his private donations .
“ i really do not know when he sleeps , ” katie o &apos;malley says , who died in the second year at drexel university in philadelphia medicine and voluntarily in bwelles .
he is always either in hospital or trying to raise money for the organization so that he can go to these campaigns .
for medical and nursing students such as o &apos;malley , who come from the usa and europe and support bwelle , this is an opportunity to gain practical experience that will help them at home .
“ we can be in the process of operations where we help to purify blood or to use the instruments for dr. bwelle , ” explains o &apos;malley .
this would be a very difficult situation in america as a medical student in the second year .
students pay their journey to cameroon themselves , usually , and often bring together coca-coloured sanitary material .
but once you have arrived in yaoundé , bwelle will take care of accommodation , transport and instruction .
“ he is without a doubt a hero , ” says o &apos;malley .
he dedicates his life to this organisation and his desire to help the people of cameroon knows no borders .
for bwelle , almost permanent work is not a burden .
to make others happier is to make a promise that is not to be forgotten .
“ i am so happy when i do this work , ” says bwelle .
and i am thinking of my father .
i hope he sees what i do .
i do it to make people laugh again and to relieve the pain .
visit the site of ascovime and learn how to help .
excellent the fight managed the fight is the best .
the role of santiago , the old man in hemingway ’ s novel &quot; the old man and the sea &quot; , is horst janson on the body .
janson is an old hand in his butt , the art of acting .
the old man santiago cannot do anything to fool anyone when fishing .
the two simply complement each other wonderfully .
it is almost thought that the folds in the neck of the old man , of which the fishing boy manolo speaks .
if santiago is tired of life on the chair , he is the one with janson real .
in addition , the role of the old fisherman is through and through a character role that janson has excellently played .
hemingway told the story of a fighter , a courageous man who did not give up and eventually died through his knowledge and also his will to fight the fish .
janson is widely regarded as a single actor on stage .
it manages to attract the audience ’ s attention , and it is also able to maintain its monologues ’ attention for a moment .
his efforts to finally bring the fish to the surface of the water are so real that the spectators forget that the sea is only made of blue .
director jens hasselmann leaves the old man in the boat in front of the fishing village .
during the performance he continues the active scene : the hip of santiago de compostela , the bar of the singer marie-luise gunst , the bar with its songs and their magnificent voice the life .
the four musicians play cuban rhythm and are also guests of the bar .
tourism : descent to the romans
the lower part of cologne is about 120 metres long and a sewage canal from the roman era is preserved .
anyone visiting cologne does not get past the cathedral .
around 157 meters , the two towers rise to the sky and turn it into the second highest church building in europe .
but few visitors who visit the two filigree church towers will appreciate the fact that there are also many churches under the duomo .
rainer schulze is an expert in the underworld of cologne .
the meeting point for his guided tours is the service center of cologne tourism directly at the dom .
the tour starts in a very unspectacular way : &quot; we start in the underground car park &quot; , says schulze .
in the 1970s , the city fathers wanted to create a city that is suitable for cars , and therefore remained untouched by the remains of the old city wall .
most users of the multi-storey car park are therefore hurried by the roman remains today and only leave their car .
but those who look more closely will discover the new “ metal ” technology in the parkdeck d2 .
the view is about five meters high ruins of stone walls .
&quot; these are remains of the roman city wall , which was built in the second half of the first century after christ , &quot; schulze tells .
before returning to the daylight , schulze lets participants on the upper level still have a look at a finer , 15 meters deeper chess .
this is the well of the old cathedral , which unfortunately is hardly noticed .
the nearest station of the tour is the pretorium , and here the participants are again descending down into the depths .
we are witnessing the seat of the once most powerful man north of the alps , the world ’ s ccaa precursor .
what ccaa means is to know a visitor .
&quot; the abbreviation stands for &quot; colonia claudia ara agrippinensium &quot; , which means in good german as &quot; city of roman law and city of agrippine , founded under emperor laudius .
and the pretorium is the former hall of fame , which was the centre of power of the roman empire on the rhine .
from the entrance hall of the exhibition , a tunnel access to the roman sewage channel , which is here preserved at about 120 metres in length .
&quot; you can easily walk a bit along the so-called cloaca maxima if you want &quot; , joyfully schulze is encouraging guests .
schulze has yet to come up with a surprise .
after he has collected the key at the checkout , he leads the group to a 16 meter deep , walkable shaft .
&quot; we are now in the mikwe , a ritual jewish bath , &quot; he explains .
the jewish community built its bath deep into the ground to get to the groundwater , which is used for the ritual washing .
to this day , the lower end of the mikwe , whose origins date back to the eighth century , has been replaced by different water levels by varying levels of the rhine .
the mikwe are part of an archaeological area on the town hall square , for which the construction work is to begin shortly .
however , some years will pass by before completion .
leg almost cut : rerun of rocker process .
a bloody attack in the rockermileu will be rekindled after more than four years .
a trial for attempted suicide , dangerous injury to the body and damage to the object of two thirds has been initiated before the district court of frankfurt ( oder ) .
it is governed by strict security measures .
the accused remained silent at the start .
they are supposed to have been active in the rocker scene and then belonged to the banddidos .
the public prosecutor accuses them of having to deal with unknown accomplices in finowfurt in june 2009 on three men in a car and of being induced .
all the victims were severely injured , a man would almost have lost his leg .
victims should become the competing grouping of hells angels .
one is to be a high-ranking member from berlin .
it seems that the first of these was a multi-car chase .
the charge was made of the battle of the area and a demonstration of power .
the two accused were in a first trial at the beginning of 2012 .
a court spokesman said at the time that it could not be proven that men were involved in the bloody feud .
the perpetrators had carried masks and had not been recognized .
the federal court of justice revoked the judgment after the public prosecutor ’ s review and called it to the district court again for further negotiations .
one of the accused is currently imprisoned for another crime .
the first of these was the reconstruction of the processes in the facade night .
as a witness , the commissioner who was then identified was loaded .
the focus was on the defendant ’ s mobile phone calls and other people who had heard the police .
it is difficult for rockers to get to court almost always in accordance with a law that they regard as their own - and not to make statements .
this also applies to the victims .
in the first process , only one of the victims had been disbursed .
prosecutor stefan golfier of the public prosecutor &apos;s office frankfurt ( or ) said on request that since the last procedure , new traces have appeared .
eleven other negotiating meetings are scheduled for the process .
the disposing society does not think
the night was long , the music loud and the mood good , but eventually it goes home .
but in the trees of people on the front-passenger and rear seat , hunger is noticeable .
of course , one cocktail or two champagne may be responsible for this !
what would be more appropriate than chilled for the next drive in order to get a little bit of luck ?
i admit that i am happy to be there when it comes to late night or early morning .
a few pommes , a cola , a burger - and then nix as from home and into bed !
but , on their way home , the obvious differences between me and others hungry disco goers are noticeable .
because what is missing is the constant regular maintenance of your fast-food products ?
the most important thing is that the paper cloths are thrown away at the weekend and on parking spaces .
&quot; why ? &quot; i wonder .
are people too doof to carry the bags home with respect until the next mill .
it is not only the case that the paper product shifts the landscape .
bags have already been used by transport facilities such as conductor planks and have therefore caused accidents .
what does that mean , &quot; disposing society &quot; , but not , presumably , it does not even know what that word actually means .
the hotel is very close to the city centre and the metro station is just a few minutes away .
there would be a few bags , more or less , even nox - unlike the street where no one is on the food remnants of other rumtramples .
i see the day when the cities and the municipalities will be able to cross the path .
obama ’ s backlash in health policy
after severe criticism , president obama made a backward step in his frequently repeated , unambiguous promise yesterday : “ if you like your health insurance , you can keep it . ”
after hundreds of thousands of their insurers have received a letter of notice , the republicans have thrown a spade on the president in recent days , calling on the american public to deceive him .
yesterday obama relatised his original promise .
“ the vast majority of citizens who want a functioning health insurance can be retained , ” he said at a speech in boston .
in response to the numerous media reports on the dismissals , obama called on those americans who received such communications to engage in free market reinsurance .
most citizens could thus expect a better , more comprehensive health insurance for the same price or less than forecast .
“ you are coming up with a better offer , ” he said .
the government said it was not surprising that the five percent of the population that had insurance themselves would not be able to move to another tariff , because their contract was not based on the new standards set by the adverdable care act .
“ i want to say to these americans quite directly : they deserve better , ” said sebelius at a hearing before the energy and trade committee of the representative house in washington .
sebelius , the world ’ s leading financial institution , is the most important financial institution in the world .
“ i am as frustrated and angry as everyone else , ” she said .
i am determined to regain their trust .
this statement of an exaggerated sebelius to a consultant behind her at yesterday &apos;s hearing in the representative office of the house of representatives was rejected after a dispute with the republican mep , billy long from missouri .
after more than three hours of hearing , long sebelius repeatedly pressed for the question of why the “ architect ” of the affordable care act was not released voluntarily on a state-sponsored insurance policy .
government in jerusalem confirms attack on syrian air base not only does it not confirm the attack on syrian air base but it does not confirm the attack on syrian air base .
an american government official who remains anonymous is not in a position to make a statement to the us news channel , cnn , on thursday to the effect that israeli fighter planes had an air base in syrian lagoon a one day before .
the objective is &apos; missiles and related equipment &apos; , of which the israeli government feared that it would be responsible for the lebanese hezbollah .
syrian and lebanese media , as well as the arab al-arabiya station , had previously reported that the port city of latakia was closed at midnight on thursday .
the israeli television channel 2 showed satellite images of the base in latitude island in the north of the country , showing russian missiles of type s-125 newa and a battery .
uncertain the government in jerusalem has officially not confirmed the attack .
however , the news agency reuters quotes a equally anonymous israeli government official , saying that he believes that israel is not carrying out the attack , but is not sure .
a speaker from the israeli defense ministry said , in any case , &apos; we are not commenting on these reports &apos; .
the journalist ron ben-yishai stressed in the daily newspaper yedioth ahronoth that the country ’ s syrian regime had already , in some cases successfully , tried to create ground air missiles .
the israeli government has repeatedly warned that any attempt to bring about a return to hezbollah by means of chemical or other dangerous weapons would be contrary to the rule of law .
john kerry explains in an unprecedented confession that the us government ’ s espionage is “ inappropriate to gone too far ” .
john kerry suggested an unexpected admission that the us would be weakening its defensive stance .
the foreign minister also admitted that he was wrong with barack obama to take responsibility for ensuring “ autopiilot . ”
the leaked information makes the us government embroiled in a diplomatic storm of indignation from its allies .
when transferring a video to the open government conference in london , kerry said : “ without question we have the president and i , as well as others in the government , learned of some things that are almost automatic pilot .
he then admitted as the first high-ranking member of the us government that the us espionage had crossed a border , but also stressed that no rights were abused .
he said , ‘ in some cases , this has gone inappropriately too far . ’
the president is determined to clarify matters and is therefore carrying out a thorough investigation so that no one has to feel that abuse is taking place .
i assure you that the rights of innocent people will not be affected in this process .
kerry insisted , however , that the nsa be a force of good , and that its surveillance operations saved many lives .
he added : “ we are dealing with a new world in which people are ready to engage themselves in the air . ”
there is radical extremism in the world that is obsessed with killing people .
so what if you were able to do it and to stop it , before it happens ?
we have in fact aircraft crashes , attacks on buildings and the murder of people because we have been affected by such plans in the run-up to them .
meanwhile , us legislators will travel to europe to raise concerns about the alleged american espionage .
senator chris murphy from connecticut said that he met with representatives of the european parliament and other people this week and was concerned about their threats to engage in political dialogue because of frustration .
“ it is very important for national security interests in the us that europeans should be able to make a positive contribution to our joint efforts against terrorism , ” said murphy , who was a democrat for the first time in the senate and president .
i am also going to europe to make it clear that we are still working together in the fight against terrorism , regardless of their anger over the nsa programmes .
media reports that the nsa has received millions of telephone data in europe have strengthened relations with some us allies .
other revelations have quoted from snowden ’ s documents that the nsa has not used the bundesliga ’ s phone , and up to 34 other heads of state .
the head of the national secret services , james clapper , defended espionage among allies as necessary , and said that this was common on both sides .
in all this uproar , murphy said that his authority prepared the trip of congress , which will take place this year , and hoped that the delegation would welcome members from both parties and chambers .
the names of the other participating members are to be published in the coming days .
he said that the exact route will be elaborated .
while murphy stressed the purpose of the journey is to improve relations , he also said that there are some “ serious words ” that would be .
he said that european governments must be honest with their people about the kind of spy programmes they themselves have been planning for years .
“ although we can change our surveillance programs , thereby better protecting europeans ’ rights , they must also address the fact that the us is not the only ones to protect the spies . ”
meanwhile , john kerry has a weekend trip to the middle east and poland , to meet there with the grossly resentment about the us strategy in syria , egypt , and iran , and the us surveillance activities .

australian woman is appealing against prison sentence in thailand .
a 21-year-old sydney woman who was born in phuket for 15 days because she was wrongly claimed to have been taken by a taxi driver .
stevie rochelle bamford was initially convicted by a provincial court in phuket on 15 june to find a false statement .
later , however , the recordings of a video camera showed that she had arrived safely to her hotel after being separated from her australian friend .
the police in phuket interrogated bamford for two days until they had confessed to think about history .
until the trial , it was in police custody on the ground .
bamford became a 15-day prison sentence in a prison prison .
she is the daughter of peter tunks , a former player of the australian rubgy-league , who has been contacting the foreign ministry in canberra with a request for help for his daughter .
tunks said to the sunday telegraph in sydney that the whole family was “ extremely concerned ” about the welfare of his daughter and wanted to bring them back to australia .
“ we are naturally very concerned , but we hope that you will be back home as soon as possible , ” said tunks .
bamford has appealed against the judgment and is against a deposit of 50,000 baht on free foot .
australian reports have said that they have meanwhile been in krabi ’ s tourist resort in southern thailand .
the court has said that bamford is being replaced by a local lawyer in phuket and is being warned that the government will not be able to appeal to the authorities .
however , it is also possible that thailand will be reluctant to accept the new government following the recent murder of the travel agent michelle smith in phuket .
